# "CALL" SPEAKS AGAIN
## 
### 
The San Francisco Call has again brought forth its unfounded rumor
that Stanford is about to return to American football and made the an
nouncement through the medium of a streamer across the top of their
sporting page in last night's issue. The article, as Mr. John Connelly has
written, purports to have first-hand information that his dope came directly
from the office of the President, while as a matter of fact, it reads more
like a recapitulation of the same unfounded "facts" given out last year by
the same sheet. We sympathize with the Call in having to dig back into
their files of a year ago to find copy to fill up their sporting page.
Mr. Connelly advances the theory that the proper officials here are
merely waiting until we can get this year's schedule out of the way be
fore making this step. What an interesting bit of news. We flatter our
selves that if any such move were contemplated the student body would
have been advised of it before it was sent to any city paper. As news this
question was passed into the discard long ago. We quit discussing that
question a couple of years ago, but the Call, ever eager to give the very
latest news to its readers, is still on it.
Mr. Connelly in his fantasy also pictured Santa Clara as ready to make
the same move as soon as they got through with the session of boredom
with the Stanford Varsity on November 24. He concluded his article after
showing what a wonderful thing it would be to have all the colleges and
universities around the bay (also original dope), playing American foot
ball, with the statement that Stanford authorities are compelled to make
this move for financial reasons.
That Stanford has no intention of going back to the American game at
present is will known to everyone who knows anything at all about Uni
versity affairs. San Francisco papers in late years have been loathe to
give Stanford much support in its determined stand on Rugby, and we pre
sume this is merely another step in their efforts to bring us around to
their way of thinking. However, Stanfor will put a team on the field No
vember 24 to show the city papers and everyone else that Rugby is far from
dead.
