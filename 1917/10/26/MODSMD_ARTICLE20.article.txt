## 
### 
Three thousand musical scores and
books, the collection of Mrs. Leonard
W. Ely of Palo Alto, who died last
June, have become the property of
Stanford through a gift from Dr. Ely
to the University Trustees. The board
fomally accepted the gift at its month
ly meeting this afternoon in San Fran
cisco.
The collection has been placed in
the library where it is being sorted
and catalogues so that it will become
available for the use of musicians of
this community and students who are
interested in music.
Mr. Ely was well known on the
Peninsula for her sweet-toned voice,
which the public enjoyed at frequent
intervals in some light lyric or stately
church composition, and all the pieces
that she sang will be preserved.
Included in her library are French,
English, German, and sacred songs,
violi naccompaniments, piano num
bers, irtul oratorios, works of the
greatest composers. Especially valu
able are the notes and memoranda
which Mrs. Ely made in many of
these. Some of her best pieces were
presented to her by the composers.
The catalogue of the gift shows
2789 pieces of sheet music, 186 col
lections, 26 bound volumes, and 4
songs without music.
