# Football Dance, Friday, A.T.O.
## U. of C. Football Squad Give Up Training Table 
### 
With only ten before the "Big
Game" between the University of Cal
ifornia and the University of Wash
ington, the Bears have broken tradi
tion by failing to install a training
table for their football heroes, there
by showing that they, too, believe that
football can be played without special
"chow."
Gilmour Dobie, former Washington
coach, is a firm believer in plain eat
ing, and his doctrine has also been
adopted by eastern colleges this year.
