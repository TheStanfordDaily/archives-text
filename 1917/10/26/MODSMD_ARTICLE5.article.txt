## Four Nominated as Union Directors 
### 
Nominations for Directors of the
Stanford Union were opened the other
night at the Union smoker, and will
not be closed for several days yet.
Only four candidates have been nom
inated so far, but it is hoped that
through the medium of The Daily Palq
Alto more names will be added to the
ballot. The elections will probably
take place some time next week,
when three directors will be voted for.
Additional nominations are needed to
make the election more of a contest.
Added importance has been given to
the Union this year, since member
ship has been made compulsory. The
smoker the other evening is a. good
example of the Union's position in
Stanford activities, so this year posi
tions as Union directors arc more de
sirable than ever before. Those nom
inated are N. R. Allen, '18, F, W.
Weeks, '18, E. 11. Martin, '18, and J.
W. Gaffney, '10.
