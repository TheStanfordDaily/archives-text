# TAYLOR TELLS OF ACTIVITY IN BALKANS
## MAKE FINE RECORD Units Now in Albania Shelled by Germans But Advance With Armies 
### 
That Stanford's ambulance units are
taking an increasing part in the war
is indicated in dispatches received
from Albania, Saturday and Sunday.
F. J. Taylor, in a letter to the campus,
and correspondence of the Associated
Press, tell of advancing under fire and
similar feats. The letter from Taylor
follows:
This is the real sport, fighting back
at Joe Boche, as the enemy is unpop
ularly known among our gang. We've
been at it three days, after due prep
arations, and .loe Bosche has retired
from twenty to fifty miles all along
the sector. Such a gain in the west
ern front would be an amazing victory,
but down here it is just good sport.
Taking war as war comes, this is
the best place in the world to see
movements and follow successes after
battles. It is a kind of old-style war
fare, where men go out and take po
sitions without the butchery of
trenches and big guns. You can fol
low the whole works, just as you fol
low the plays in a big football game,
only this is on a much hugher scale, is
a bigger league sport.
We might as well go through the
last three days together. Friday night
