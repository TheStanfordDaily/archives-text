# TAYLOR TELLS OF ACTIVITY IN BALKANS
## MAKE FINE RECORD Units Now in Albania Shelled by Germans But Advance With Armies 
### 
That Stanford's ambulance units are
taking an increasing part in the war
is indicated in dispatches received
from Albania, Saturday and Sunday.
F. J. Taylor, in a letter to the campus,
and correspondence of the Associated
Press, tell of advancing under fire and
similar feats. The letter from Taylor
follows:
This is the real sport, fighting back
at Joe Boche, as the enemy is unpop
ularly known among our gang. We've
been at it three days, after due prep
arations, and .loe Bosche has retired
from twenty to fifty miles all along
the sector. Such a gain in the west
ern front would be an amazing victory,
but down here it is just good sport.
Taking war as war comes, this is
the best place in the world to see
movements and follow successes after
battles. It is a kind of old-style war
fare, where men go out and take po
sitions without the butchery of
trenches and big guns. You can fol
low the whole works, just as you fol
low the plays in a big football game,
only this is on a much hugher scale, is
a bigger league sport.
We might as well go through the
last three days together. Friday night
was the time set for the fireworks to
begin, we heard in a roundabout way,
and Carl Randan and I went out with
Harry Frantz, "Spot" Peek and Dun
can McLeish to establish a post near
one of the batteries. Our hunch proved
to be the correct one, for just as we
arrived at P the French batteries
there began thundering away at .foe
Hosche in the hills across the way.
That night we did not hear much,
but next morning we learned that tiie
enemy's positions were taken so easily
that it was not necessary to waste
shells.
The next morning proved to be our
"star" day. Early in the morning five
of us were honored with a shell apiece
from a big gun of Joe Hosche. We ap
preciate that honor now, though none
of us stayed to see the ceremony plan
ned for us entirely through. We re
treated unconditionally in squads of
one. The story of five fools runs as
follows:
Carl Randau, Bill Losh, "Dusty"
Honens, Harold Sayre and I went out
in the staff car to inspect the postes.
We stopped at the farther outpost and
went up 011 a hill to see the fight. It
was a wonderful vantage point we
chose, for from a fairly safe trench
we could see the guns of both sides
fire, and we could see the shells light
and explode after sizzling through the
air from one hill to the other. The
French batteries were back of us and
slightly to either side, so that the
shells went over our heads. The arm
ies were firing at each others' bat
teries.
Finally tiring of that view, we went
to another poste, and from there to a
hill directly in front of one of the
French batteries, though we did not
know we were doing so at the time.
We crawled through the bushes and
up to a hill, from which we had a view
almost too wonderful to be true. We
could see every position Joe Hosche
held perfectly, and could also see the
French shells lighting 011 his points
and slowly battering his trenches and
positions down.
Suddenly, while we lay there in the
bushes, a shell whirred over our heads
and exploded a considerable distance
behind us. Then another, and another,
each time sounding nearer. We began
to have apprehensions, and when the
fourth burst over our heads and
slightly to one side of us, we hastily
evacuated our positions in companies
of one. The fifth shot convinced us
that Joe Hosche had seen us, and was
honoring us with shrapnel, thinking
we might be officers taking observa
tions.
In the evening the Hosche retired
quietly and the French advanced. To
days we wandered over the fields
where yesterday our presence would
have meant certain death. Upon a
hill was the position Joe Hosche held
the day before, from whence he had
lired at us. We climbed into the
trenches, past the barbed-wire entan
glements and began prowling around.
Evidences were distinctly German.
There were match boxes with Ger
man printing on them, bits of German
papers, and a number of signs with
"Grantwerfer Zug 1" (grenade throw
er, section 1), and oilier directions on
them, which was quite conclusive
proof that we were opposing German
officers, at least.
In one of the front trenches we
found a dead Austrian. He was a
young man, with clean-cut features,
had evidently left in such a hurry they
shot through (lie neck. His comrades
could not. bury him.
That evening we advanced along
with the victorious French, even
ahead of our place. Will Rodgers of
San Francisco was the first to go out
of our advanced poste, and with the
lieutenant and Carl (Randau) he
passed ahead of the artillery and in
fantry, leaving only a small cavalry
troop between him and the evacuating
Hosche. According to Carl, it was one
of the proudest moments of his life
when he saw an American ambulance
passing everything en route to lie the
poste near the front.

the sector. Such a gain in the west
ern front would be an amazing victory,
but down here it is just good sport.
Taking war as war comes, this is
the best place in the world to see
movements and follow successes after
battles. It is a kind of old-style war
fare, where men go out and take po
sitions without the butchery of
trenches and big guns. You can fol
low the whole works, just as you fol
low the plays in a big football game,
only this is on a much hugher scale, is
a bigger league sport.
We might as well go through the
last three days together. Friday night
was the time set for the fireworks to
begin, we heard in a roundabout way,
and Carl Randan and I went out with
Harry Frantz, "Spot" Peek and Dun
can McLeish to establish a post near
one of the batteries. Our hunch proved
to be the correct one, for just as we
arrived at P the French batteries
there began thundering away at .foe
Hosche in the hills across the way.
That night we did not hear much,
but next morning we learned that tiie
enemy's positions were taken so easily
that it was not necessary to waste
shells.
The next morning proved to be our
"star" day. Early in the morning five
of us were honored with a shell apiece
from a big gun of Joe Hosche. We ap
preciate that honor now, though none
of us stayed to see the ceremony plan
ned for us entirely through. We re
treated unconditionally in squads of
one. The story of five fools runs as
follows:
Carl Randau, Bill Losh, "Dusty"
Honens, Harold Sayre and I went out
in the staff car to inspect the postes.
We stopped at the farther outpost and
went up 011 a hill to see the fight. It
was a wonderful vantage point we
chose, for from a fairly safe trench
we could see the guns of both sides
fire, and we could see the shells light
and explode after sizzling through the
air from one hill to the other. The
French batteries were back of us and
slightly to either side, so that the
shells went over our heads. The arm
ies were firing at each others' bat
teries.
Finally tiring of that view, we went
to another poste, and from there to a
hill directly in front of one of the
French batteries, though we did not
know we were doing so at the time.
We crawled through the bushes and
up to a hill, from which we had a view
almost too wonderful to be true. We
could see every position Joe Hosche
held perfectly, and could also see the
French shells lighting 011 his points
and slowly battering his trenches and
positions down.
Suddenly, while we lay there in the
bushes, a shell whirred over our heads
and exploded a considerable distance
behind us. Then another, and another,
each time sounding nearer. We began
to have apprehensions, and when the
fourth burst over our heads and
slightly to one side of us, we hastily
evacuated our positions in companies
of one. The fifth shot convinced us
that Joe Hosche had seen us, and was
honoring us with shrapnel, thinking
we might be officers taking observa
tions.
In the evening the Hosche retired
quietly and the French advanced. To
days we wandered over the fields
where yesterday our presence would
have meant certain death. Upon a
hill was the position Joe Hosche held
the day before, from whence he had
lired at us. We climbed into the
trenches, past the barbed-wire entan
glements and began prowling around.
Evidences were distinctly German.
There were match boxes with Ger
man printing on them, bits of German
papers, and a number of signs with
"Grantwerfer Zug 1" (grenade throw
er, section 1), and oilier directions on
them, which was quite conclusive
proof that we were opposing German
officers, at least.
In one of the front trenches we
found a dead Austrian. He was a
young man, with clean-cut features,
had evidently left in such a hurry they
shot through (lie neck. His comrades
could not. bury him.
That evening we advanced along
with the victorious French, even
ahead of our place. Will Rodgers of
San Francisco was the first to go out
of our advanced poste, and with the
lieutenant and Carl (Randau) he
passed ahead of the artillery and in
fantry, leaving only a small cavalry
troop between him and the evacuating
Hosche. According to Carl, it was one
of the proudest moments of his life
when he saw an American ambulance
passing everything en route to lie the
poste near the front.
That Stanford's ambulance units are
taking an increasing part in the war
is indicated in dispatches received
from Albania, Saturday and Sunday.
F. J. Taylor, in a letter to the campus,
and correspondence of the Associated
Press, tell of advancing under fire and
similar feats. The letter from Taylor
follows:

at Joe Boche, as the enemy is unpop

was the time set for the fireworks to
begin, we heard in a roundabout way,
and Carl Randan and I went out with
Harry Frantz, "Spot" Peek and Dun
can McLeish to establish a post near
one of the batteries. Our hunch proved
to be the correct one, for just as we
arrived at P the French batteries
there began thundering away at .foe
Hosche in the hills across the way.
That night we did not hear much,
but next morning we learned that tiie
enemy's positions were taken so easily
that it was not necessary to waste
shells.
The next morning proved to be our
"star" day. Early in the morning five
of us were honored with a shell apiece
from a big gun of Joe Hosche. We ap
preciate that honor now, though none
of us stayed to see the ceremony plan
ned for us entirely through. We re
treated unconditionally in squads of
one. The story of five fools runs as
follows:
Carl Randau, Bill Losh, "Dusty"
Honens, Harold Sayre and I went out
in the staff car to inspect the postes.
We stopped at the farther outpost and
went up 011 a hill to see the fight. It
was a wonderful vantage point we
chose, for from a fairly safe trench
we could see the guns of both sides
fire, and we could see the shells light
and explode after sizzling through the
air from one hill to the other. The
French batteries were back of us and
slightly to either side, so that the
shells went over our heads. The arm
ies were firing at each others' bat
teries.
Finally tiring of that view, we went
to another poste, and from there to a
hill directly in front of one of the
French batteries, though we did not
know we were doing so at the time.
We crawled through the bushes and
up to a hill, from which we had a view
almost too wonderful to be true. We
could see every position Joe Hosche
held perfectly, and could also see the
French shells lighting 011 his points
and slowly battering his trenches and
positions down.
Suddenly, while we lay there in the
bushes, a shell whirred over our heads
and exploded a considerable distance
behind us. Then another, and another,
each time sounding nearer. We began
to have apprehensions, and when the
fourth burst over our heads and
slightly to one side of us, we hastily
evacuated our positions in companies
of one. The fifth shot convinced us
that Joe Hosche had seen us, and was
honoring us with shrapnel, thinking
we might be officers taking observa
tions.
In the evening the Hosche retired
quietly and the French advanced. To
days we wandered over the fields
where yesterday our presence would
have meant certain death. Upon a
hill was the position Joe Hosche held
the day before, from whence he had
lired at us. We climbed into the
trenches, past the barbed-wire entan
glements and began prowling around.
Evidences were distinctly German.
There were match boxes with Ger
man printing on them, bits of German
papers, and a number of signs with
"Grantwerfer Zug 1" (grenade throw
er, section 1), and oilier directions on
them, which was quite conclusive
proof that we were opposing German
officers, at least.
In one of the front trenches we
found a dead Austrian. He was a
young man, with clean-cut features,
had evidently left in such a hurry they
shot through (lie neck. His comrades
could not. bury him.
That evening we advanced along
with the victorious French, even
ahead of our place. Will Rodgers of
San Francisco was the first to go out
of our advanced poste, and with the
lieutenant and Carl (Randau) he
passed ahead of the artillery and in
fantry, leaving only a small cavalry
troop between him and the evacuating
Hosche. According to Carl, it was one
of the proudest moments of his life
when he saw an American ambulance
passing everything en route to lie the
poste near the front.
That Stanford's ambulance units are
taking an increasing part in the war
is indicated in dispatches received
from Albania, Saturday and Sunday.
F. J. Taylor, in a letter to the campus,
and correspondence of the Associated
Press, tell of advancing under fire and
similar feats. The letter from Taylor
follows:
This is the real sport, fighting back
at Joe Boche, as the enemy is unpop
ularly known among our gang. We've
been at it three days, after due prep
arations, and .loe Bosche has retired
from twenty to fifty miles all along
the sector. Such a gain in the west
ern front would be an amazing victory,
but down here it is just good sport.
Taking war as war comes, this is
the best place in the world to see
movements and follow successes after
battles. It is a kind of old-style war
fare, where men go out and take po
sitions without the butchery of
trenches and big guns. You can fol
low the whole works, just as you fol
low the plays in a big football game,
only this is on a much hugher scale, is
a bigger league sport.
