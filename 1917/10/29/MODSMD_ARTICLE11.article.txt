## BABES BEAT LOWELL Cardinals Overwhelm Fifteens by Large Score. Second Varsity Loses 
### 
With team-work and individual play
developed to the highest degree, Stan
ford Varsity was returned winner
over the speedy Fort Mason fifteen on
the Cardinal lot, Saturday, by the
score of 27 to 0. From the first whistle
to the final gun the Varsity ruggers
showed a dash which boosted hopes
for a victory over Santa Clara one
hundred per cent, fn addition to the
Varsity win, freshmen defeated the
crack Lowell sqnad 47 to 0, and the
Second Varsity lost to tire Barbarian
Club.
Fort Mason fought hard but they
could not stop the passing rushes of
the Cardinal backfield nor the drib
bling rushes of the forwards. After
the first few minutes of play the game
became a question of the score. Af
ter the kick-off there was see-saw play
for several minutes, when Lilly broke
away on a pass from Hauser and ran
thirty-five yards for a try. Temple
ton converted in easy style. The next
count came as a result of a rush by
the backs, Lilly to Chandler to Heron,
who went over. Templeton failed a
difficult conversion on this one. After
the drop out the backfield came back
with another try, Hauser to Lilly to
Heron to VVark, who went over after
a pretty run. Templeton again failed
to convert.
Again after the drop out the Card
inals ran it back in a rush. Wark
picked the ball out of the ruck and
after a pretty run, passed to Winham,
who ran to the five-yard line and
passed to Barneson for a try. Tem
pleton converted this one. The last
score of the half came when Lilly
went over for his second try 011 a
pass from Hauser. Templeton con
verted. Count at the end of first
period 21 to 0.
During the second half the soldiers
I improved their game so much that the
Varsity was able to count but twice,
first, 011 a forty-yard drop kick from a
free kick by Templeton, and the sec
ond on a try, Winham to Harneson.
conversion failing. Score at end of
game 27 to 0.
The freshmen in the last difficult
game before the Santa Clara struggle
completely outclassed the fast, heavy
Lowell fifteen. There was a dash and
knowledge in their play which soon
took the smile off the face of Santa
Clara's coach, Von Monderscheid, who
was on the side lines. The first-year
men went over the line eleven times,
eight of which Doe converted. Most
of the scoring came 011 backfield
rushes but the forwards were there
to support the speedy backs at all
stages of the game. The whole team,
in fact, worked together in fine style.
The count at the end of the first half
was 21 to 0, but the "babes" boosted
it to 47 before the final gun.
