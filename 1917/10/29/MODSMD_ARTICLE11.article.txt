Fort Mason fought hard but they
could not stop the passing rushes of
the Cardinal backfield nor the drib
bling rushes of the forwards. After
the first few minutes of play the game
became a question of the score. Af
ter the kick-off there was see-saw play
for several minutes, when Lilly broke
away on a pass from Hauser and ran
thirty-five yards for a try. Temple
ton converted in easy style. The next
count came as a result of a rush by
the backs, Lilly to Chandler to Heron,
who went over. Templeton failed a
difficult conversion on this one. After
the drop out the backfield came back
with another try, Hauser to Lilly to
Heron to VVark, who went over after
a pretty run. Templeton again failed
to convert.
