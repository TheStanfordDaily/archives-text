# "ORIENTAL RELATIONS"
## 
### 
"Oriental Relations" is the subject Mr. S. S. McClure has chosen for his
lecture to be given in the Assembly Hall tomorrow night as the regular
Tuesday evening lecture attraction.
Mr, McClure is undoubtedly one of the biggest men in the country today
in the field of publications. His interests are so well known to the nation
at large as to make an enumeration of them unnecessary. McClure has re
cently returned from the Orient and this fact, coupled with his ability to
grasp national and international affairs, insures the Stanford community
of a most able presentation of the question.
Although the chief interest of the citizens of the United States at pres
ent naturally centers on the European battlefields we are not unmindful of
relations with other parts of the world. Because of its late development
and the enormity of trade relations with the eastern powers the Oriental
question is one of real importance. Opportunity to hear its presentation by
a man of such world-wide fame cannot be passed over lightly.
Believing residents in and around the University will avail themselves
in a very large measure of this opportunity those in charge of the Tuesday
evening lectures have changed the place of the lecture from the Little
Theater to the Assembly Hall. We believe they have made no mistake and
urge that Mr. McClure be welcomed with a crowded hall on the occasion
of his appearance at Stanford.
