Stanford Freshmen met their Water
loo at the hands of Lowell High
School last Saturday afternoon in En
cina pool, before a large, enthusiastic
crowd, by an overwhelming score of

into camp after the first event and
they were never headed after the start

clearly outclassed the first-year men.

spotlight for the "frosh," taking first
in the 100 yards, and second in the 50

the sensational hit of the season to

ing in comparison to what he has done
in previous aquatic carnivals.
