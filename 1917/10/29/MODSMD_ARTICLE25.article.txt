Saturday's Second Varsity game
marked tlie first serious injury of the
year when Debenhani and a Barbarian
player suffered broken less. Both
players are doing nicely at present.

The Varsity scrum worked in fine
shape against the soldiers. Swarts at j
lock showed up especially strong both
in offense and defense. The soldiers
'were poor tacklors and as a result
the forwards on the Cardinal fifteen
pushed the ball ahead for gains sev
eral times.

Coach Wylie will not cut the Rugby
squad down this year but will give
I every man a chance until the last
I game of the season. The complete
I roll is called every night, and unless a
I man reports consistently his chances
to get on are lessened.
The freshmen pulled off a pretty
i play when Patrick crossed to Sheldon
I who passed to Morse and Falk before
the Lowell men could find their breath.

Ken Lilly plays a nice game at first
I five. His one tendency seems to be to
I cut out the second five when he is
: running with the ball.
