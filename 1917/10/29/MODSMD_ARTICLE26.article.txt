# Miss Frazer Talks to Education Club
## 
### 
"Teaching as a Vocation" was the
I subject of Miss Anne G. Eraser's talk
before the Women's Educational Cluli
yesterday afternoon in the Women's
Club House. Miss Fraser, a graduate
of 1900, holds the distinction of being
the first woman Carnot debater at
Stanford, and she is now the vice-prin
cipal of the Oakland High School.
As a vocation, teaching is most de
sirable for women, according to Miss
Fraser. They received good pay in
this field, and the respect of the com
munity, as well as to lend their in
fluence in shaping the lives of the
future generations.
