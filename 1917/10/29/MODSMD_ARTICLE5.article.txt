# Dr. Palmer Delivers Sunday War Service
## 
### 
Prayers for the success of Amer
ica's arms, and for all persons en
gaged in the American and Allied
cause, were offered yesterday by Chap
lain Gardner, at a special service held
in the Memorial Church in accord
ance with President Wilson's procla
mation.
Professor Vernon L. Kellogg spoke
on "War and Food." after which the
Rev. Albert W. Palmer, chaplain at
the Presidio, preached the sermon.
Rev. Palmer pointed out that de
spite the terrible consequences of this
war, certain beneficial by-products
will come. Chief among these will be
a spirit of internationalism; a loyalty
to humanity in general rather than to
a particular nation; and a new atti
tude toward society, which will de
crease individual selfishness. The
wonderful treatment and care given to
the common soldier in this war will
help toward the same carefulness for
the common laboring man after the
war. Dr. Palmer hopes that the dis
graceful reconstruction of the Civil
War will not he repeated at the close
of this war, and cautioned against bit
terness of feeling.
Professor Kellogg told of the great
dependence of the Allies upon America
for food; how strenuously they are
saving their own limited supply; and
how easily each one in America, by
curtailing his own wastefulness, can
keep them from starving. By saving
one out of every four ounces of sugar,
citizens of the United States can more
than double the French supply.
About fifty of the Reserve Officers'
Training Corps attended in a body.
