# "GIVE TILL IT HURTS" IS PLEA FOR WAR PRISONERS
## 
### 
â€¢'Any person in this country, not
otherwise serving his government, who
doesn't dig down in his pocket and
give so it hurts is a slacker," said
Marshall Bartholomew, noted prison
camp worker, sounding an appeal to
Stanford students and faculty to aid
I in the relief work of the Y. M. C. A.
"The Association is in to go to the
limit," said Mr. Bartholomew, in pre
senting the great value of the Y. M. C.
A. work in the armies and prison
camps of the European war. His de
piction of the conditions in the Amer
ican training camps, in the European
trenches and prison camps was
graphically given in four group meet
ings, the faculty and the women of
j the University during the afternoon,
and the fraternity men at the Delta
I Upsilon house, and the Hall men at
| Encina during the evening.
"The most important thing in an
j army is its morale," said Mr. Barthol
omew, "and keeping up the morale of
the men in the trendies will be the
deciding factor in this war." That
the armies of Europe and America
realize this fact, the speaker showed
by mentioning the fact that the French
army has telegraphed to Washington
to come to the battle front immedi
for 500 more Y. M. C. A. secretaries
ately, that the Italian and English and
Russian armies have sent similar
! calls, and that General Scott, chief of
staff of the United States army, has
mentioned the work of the Association

as being absolutely essential in the
American forces.
The speaker told how the Y. M. C.
A.'s were established in every train
ing camp in the United States for the
purpose of taking care of the Amer
ican soldier during his leisure hours,
and provided him with places to re
lax, to hear music and entertainments,
and to read or write. He told how
the Y. M. C. A. followed the soldier to
France and up to the very front line
trenches and provided dugouts where
the men could rest and get warm and
secure a welcome cup of tea or smoke
when it meant everything to him. He
described what the Association had ac
complished in the prison camps,
where it had found hospitals without
mattresses and where such a thing as
medicine was never known, where
even the doctors lost their nerve and
refused to enter. By providing diver
sion for the men, the Y. M. C. A. has
saved thousands of prisoners from
going insane. "The Y. M. C. A. is
needed," he said, "to revitalize the
armies of Russia. From a purely mil
itary point of view, nothing can be of
greater help in winning the war than
this."
The Y. M. C. A.'s and the Y. W. C,
A.'s of the United States have com
bined in a big $35,000,000 campaign to
forward this most essential work.
Stanford's part in this will be the ef
fort to raise $6,000 during the time of
the campaign, which is from the lltli
to the 19th of November.
