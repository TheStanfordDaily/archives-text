### 
Just returned from a searching in
vestigation of Japan and China, S. S.
McClure, the well-known journalist
and founder of McClure's Magazine,
comes to Stanford tomorrow evening
as the biggest feature in October's
bill of Tuesday evening lectures. Pro
fessor L. E. Bassett has arranged for
Mr. McClure's lecture on the "Rela
tions Between Japan and the United
States," to be delivered in the Assem
bly Hall instead of the Little Theater
in order to accommodate the addition

al crowds that are expected to take
advantage of this opportunity.
During Mr. McClure's tour of Japan
and China he thoroughly investigated
the economic conditions, the plans for
a place in the future world, and the
policy and attitude of the common peo
ple toward the United States. His
years of experience as a journalist and
his power of keen discernment have
enabled him to get data and material
that will greatly enlighten the Amer
ican people on the affairs of the
Orient. The lecture is free and will
begin tomorrow at 7:30 p.m.
