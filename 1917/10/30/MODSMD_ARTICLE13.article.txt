# MEN IN ARMY PRAISE WORK OF Y. M. C. A.
## WRITE TO SECRETARY Soldiers in Camp Have the "Y" to Thank for Pleasures Furnished Them 
### 
Letters from Stanford men in the
service, heartily commending the work
of the army Y. M. C. A., are coming
in in numbers to A. E. Worthy, secre
tary of the local Association, as a re
sult of some 300 letters which were
sent from the campus to these men,
asking their opinion of the work, last
week. The writers are without ex
ception most enthusiastic in telling
the value of the work which the army
Association is carrying on, and in en
dorsing the campaign which Stanford
is to undertake on the Bth of Novem
ber to forward this work.
"For what the Y. M. C. A. has done
for me personally, I owe a real debt,"
writes Ed. Ford, '14, second lieuten
ant, 12th infantry. "Practically all
men in the service have only the 'Y'
to thank for their athletic pleasures.
J. T. Barton, ex-'l7, a sergeant at
the San Francisco Presidio, writes:
"The Y' here is the only place where
the men can have even a suggestion of
the comforts to which they are used.
I never was particularly interested in
the Y. M. C. A. before, and I am writ
ing this solely to do justice to an or
ganization which is doing a splendid
work."
Other writers are equally enthusi
astic in commending the work. There
has not been sufficient time to allow
for answers to come in from Ameri
can Lake, as yet, but a large number
are expected within the next two days,
and as it is known that the "Y" is
doing a great woiÂ«k in that camp, the
replies win uuauuuieaij ut
fying as those that are now pouring
in.
Great demands are being made on
the Young Men's and Young Women's
Christian Associations in this present
war. With the allied nations of
Europe wiring to Washington for sec
retaries to be sent in force to take up
work in the European armies at once,
and with the War Department of the
United States saying "You've got to
be with our men all the time," the
need for funds, equipments and volun
teers for "Y" work is urgent. The
combined national organizations of Y.
M. C. A. and Y. W. C. A.'s have insti
tuted a big $35,000,000 campaign
which will take place during the early
part of November. Stanford has
taken it upon herself to raise $6,000 as
her part, in the work. Active work in
the campaign will begin on November
Bth with a big University assembly,
for which several prominent speakers
will be secured. Forty captains
among the men students and twenty
among the women are to be appointed
to take charge of the raising of funds
among the various groups on the cam
pus.
