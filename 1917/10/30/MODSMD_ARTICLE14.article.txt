# Semester Shirts at 1920 Dance Friday
## Sophomore Jolly-Up to Be Held at Encina; Is First of Season 
### 
First of this season's jolly-ups will
take place Friday evening, when the
Sophomore Class will hold its infor
mal dance in the Encina Club Room.
Plans are now being laid by the com
mittee in charge to make the affair
exceptional among the so-called "se
mester shirt" dances. Admission
charge is to be fifty cents per head,
and entrance is to be limited to
Sophomore men and all of the "500."
The usual tags, "I a mso and so. Who
are you?" are to be distributed at the
doors. Music is to be provided by
D. E. McXamee, '20, and his jazz or
chestra.
Football men will not be permitted
to dance at the jolly-up, according to
a ruling made by Coach Wylie last
evening, who put dancing on the list
of forbidden pleasures.
