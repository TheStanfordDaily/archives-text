Freshman Rugby men are now on their last week of practice before the
annual game with Santa Clara. The Freshmen have been playing a fine
game so far this season and from the form shown to date should make a
good showing for themselves next Saturday afternoon.
The strength of the Santa Clara freshmen is an unknown quantity,
owing to their lack of games with teams which have competed here. Stan
ford Freshmen have played a heavy schedule and have shown steady im
provement throughout the season. The Freshmen have a light, fast team
which is fighting every minute of play. The scrum has easily held its
own against any pitted against it this year. The backfield is fast and has
shown some beautiful passing rushes, while the scrum has developed a re
markable ability in handling the ball from the lineouts.
Although the Freshmen season does not end with Saturday's contest, the
games scheduled for this week are by far the most important of the season.
Next to the Big Game, the Freshman contest should be the chief attraction
of the Stanford season and deserves the support of the entire student body.
Although there are other football attractions scheduled elsewhere for Sat
urday, they should not be allowed to interfere with the Freshman game.
