Dopesters who have seen both Santa
Clara and Stanford work out are con
ceding the Freshman game to the
Cardinal, but are uncertain about the
Varsity contest. The first-year men
after their battle against the crack
1 Lowell fifteen look to be one of the
best teams around the country and
should hand a defeat to the Saintly
I crew from Santa Clara. ♦
*******
The Varsity looks better in every
I game. Coach Wylie lias worked his
I forwards around *to where they look
fully as strong if not stronger than
last year's scrum. The backfield still
needs a little coaching. They seem
to play an individual game too much
I and seldom make a real passing rush,
j Most of the tries by the backs come
| from individual play.
* ******
The first-year contest will begin
promptly at 2:30, and fifty cents will
be required. .
