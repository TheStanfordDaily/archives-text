# Catalogue for Old Museum Finished
## Inaugural Medals of Presidents and Old Stanford Relics Among Additions 
### 
A complete Inventory Catalogue of
Stanford Museum, which has been in
preparation for the past year, is now
ready, and has been turned in to the
President's office. The preparation of
the catalogue was especially difficult
since every object had to be meas
ured by the metric system in three
licerent ways, but it is now finished,
and contains descriptions of some
25,000 objects.
Among some recent additions to the
Museum, Percy Morgan has contrib
uted a fine collection of twenty-nine
Inaugural Medals, done in bronze, in
cluding those of Lincoln, Roosevelt,
and Grant. Vanderlyn Stow has given
bas reliefs of old coins which are es
pecially rare. Some early Stanford
relics, also, have been secured from
the President's office.
A Synoptic Guide, by which tourists
will be enabled to pick out the impor
tant objects, is now in preparation,
and will add greatly to the ease of
finding certain exhibits of interest.
Of special interest to Egyptian stu
dents is the cast being made of the
Rosetta Stone, which is an exact re
production of the original in the Brit
ish Museum of London, and will soon
be completed.
