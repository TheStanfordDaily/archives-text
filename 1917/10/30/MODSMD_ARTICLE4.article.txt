# MYSTERY IN COMING COMEDY
## "CINDERELLA MAN" HAS HUMAN INTEREST 
### 
Some of the most pleasing scenes
of "The Cinderella Man," to be pro
sented by Sword and Sandals in the
Assembly Hall on the evening of No
vember 16, are between Marjorie
Caner and Anthony Quintard. Miss
Florence i Mason, 'IS, will interpret
the character of Marjorie Caner, and
L. L. Pickering, '20, has been cast for
the part of Anthony Quintard.

Marjorie conceals her real identity
from Tony Quintard for four acts of
"The Cinderella Man." Both charac
ters are so human the audience will
be with them from the rise of the cur
tain to the end, for Director Frank
h. Mathieu is giving particular atten
tion to the scenes between them and
promises the best bit of work that has


Miss Florence Mason, '18, as
Marjorle Caner, and L. L.
Pickering, '20, as Anthony
Quintard, in"The Cinder
ella Man."
