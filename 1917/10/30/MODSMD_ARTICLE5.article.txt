# NOTED JOURNALIST TO TELL JAPAN'S VIEWPOINT
## 
### 
Bringing a message that will greatly
enlighten the American people on the
affairs and problems of the Orient, S.
S. McClure, founder of McClure's
Magazine and noted journalist and
publicist, will lecture on "The Rela
tions Between the United States and
Japan," before a Stanford audience at
7::?l) tonight. This will undoubtedly
be the biggest attraction of the regu

larv Tuesday evening lecture series
for October, and in order to accom
modate the extra crowd, Professor L.
E. Hassett, chairman of the Committee
on Public Exercises, has arranged for
the address to be delivered in Assem
bly Hall instead of the Little Theater.
Mr. McClure has just returned from
a tour of China and Japan, where,
with the aid of the governments of
both countries, he made an exhaustive
study of the economic and social con
ditions. He visited the leading uni
versities and colleges of these coun
tries and delivered lectures through
an interpreter. His years of experi
ence as a journalist and his reputa
tion as one of our leading citizens
made it possible for him to make in
vestigations and secure facts that
would be denied to one less famous and
well known internationally.
As many of our statesmen have been
watching with growing concern the
development of the Orient, and as our
business men are beginning to turn
their attention toward the Pacific, Mr.
McClure's information on the eco
nomic conditions of the Far East, the
plans of each country for a place in
the world and the poicy and attitude
of the common people toward the
j United States, should be especially in
teresting to the people of this coun
i try and especially of California.
