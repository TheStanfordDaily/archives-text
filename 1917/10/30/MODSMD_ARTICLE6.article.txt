ing the past ten years." A total of

2,490 men will be- selected, giving
Stanford University 14 of the number.
The qualifications of the men from
the student group are that they must
be graduates or undergraduates of the
institution listed, between 21 and HI
years of age on January 5, and must
be men who have taken the course in
military training offered by the insti
tution. Letters of recommendation
are not wanted, but only the names
of three responsible citizens who
know the man best. Applicants may
be either married or unmarried, but
preference will be given to unmarried
men.
Application must be made through
Major Bugge accompanied with a phy
sical examination certificate tilled out
by a reputable physician, at the appli
cant's own expense.
