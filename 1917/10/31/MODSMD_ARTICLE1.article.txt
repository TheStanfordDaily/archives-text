# NO FAR EASTERN PROBLEM SAYS McCLURE
## ALSO DISCUSSES WAR Horrible Outrages by German Government Disclosed by Speaker 
### 
When Samuel S. McClure, publicist,
traveler, student of international af
fairs, and prominent American, told
an audience that packed Assembly
Hall last night, that the United States
had nothing to fear from .Japan, his
hearers were interested; when he said
"America is in this war to the finish,"
he was wildly applauded. Mr. Mc-
Clure was scheduled to deliver an ad
dress on "Our Relations With Japan."
and treated that subject during the
first part of his speech, but the latter
half of his two-hour lecture was on
the Great War and particularly the
German atrocities in France and Bel
gium.
Many otherwise well-informed
Americans, said Mr. McClure, have
the idea that we are in danger of
attack from Japan, but this belief has
no foundation in fact. Japan has a
population of 57,010,000 living on an
area about equal to 4 hat of California,
and only ore-sixth o* which is cap
able of cultivation. Her foreign com-
merce, though greatly increased, will,
this year, be but three-fourths that of
Belgium in 1913. She is poor in nat
ural resources, has no great indus
tries, and is absolutely dependent for
existence upon the freedom of the
seas. Her far-seeing statesmen real
ize that an alliance with a great naval
power is an absolute necessity, and
this is the keynote of the whole Jap
anese foreign policy. "Japan,* con
cluded the speaker, "is a negligible
factor in a modern war, and it is folly
to talk of her attacking us. There is
no Far-Eastern Question."
Speaking of China, Mr. McClure re
marked: "All the talk about exploit
ing the Chinese is idiotic. The best
service anyone can do for China is to
build a railroad there."
Turning to the European question,
Mr. McClure discussed the politics of
that continent during the last decade,
which culminated in a tentative agree
ment between England, Germany, and
France, concerning Asiatic Turkey,
which was drawn up in June, 1914,
just previous to the outbreak of the
catastrophe, when the Prussian war
party persuaded the Kaiser to plunge
Europe into war.
In regard to the unspeakable atroci
ties, the lecturer quoted mainly from
official German sources. These told
of Belgium devastated and robbed,
children starved, women outraged, vil
lages razed and decimated, wounded
soldiers slaughtered, and men, women,
and children mutilated and burned
alive. "The feeling aroused by the
German atrocities constitute the chief
obstacle to an early peace," he de
clared.
Mr. McClure expressed no doubt as
to the outcome of the war. "There
will be no peace conference. The
terms of peace will be made by Eng
land, France, and the United States.
1 have only been through the 'Pacific
states since my return from the East,
but from what I have observed, the
people are behind the war, and intend
to see it through to a finish. I am
prouder now than ever before to be
an American."
