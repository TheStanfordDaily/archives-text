## 
### 
Candidates for the new band of the
Stanford Reserve Officers' Training
Corps have been callcd by Major Jens
Bugge and rehearsals will begin as
soon as the cadets have completed thn
school of the soldier. The idea of
forming a military band in addition
to the nsual University Band, is a
new one, and though the system is
more than an experiment, the perm
manence of the organization rests en
tirely on the attitude of the band men i
of the school in enrolling in both j
bands.
The Military department is aiming
to build up a band of thirty pieces:
under the direction of P. S. Carter, |
'18, which will rehearse once a week j
and will take an active part in the j
activities of the corps. Musicians of j
the University who arc taking military |
training are expected to enroll in the
new organization and an urgent ap
peal is made to new band men to
come forward and assist in retaining
the reputation set by the Stanford |
musicians of past years. New candi- j
dates who have not reported are re-;
quested to hand their names to the
major in the next few days.
