# Women's Red Cross Starts Work To-day
## Bandages are Being Rolled and Christmas Packets are Now Under Way 
### 
Red Cross work began in earnest
today when the workers assembled in
tlie Women's Club House to cut and
roll bandages. The Club House is to
be open to women wishing to do Red
Cross work every afternoon of the
week from now on.
The campaign for funds for materi
als is now well under way. Receipt
books in the various houses on the
campus show that a good beginning
in the way of response is being made.
Delta Tau Delta heads the list with a
donation of $14. which has been col
lected in three days. The remainder
of the week remains, in which it is
hoped that all living groups will
"come across" with considerable con
tributions for the Red Cross.
Women's houses on the campus arr
going to be asked to serve tea in the
Women's Club House one day each
week while the Red Cross work is in
progress. A small charge will be
made and the proceeds will go to
wards the purchase of supplies for
the Stanford Auxiliary.
Christmas packets for soldiers and
sailors are now the important featim
of Red Cross work. Every woman 011
the campus should collect the neces
sary articles and send at least one
packet to help in giving Christmas
cheer. Suggestions for the contents
of the packets were made in the Mon
day issue of The Daily Palo Alto.
For preparing them the following
suggestions are made:
1. Nothing should go in them which
will not keep fresh from the time of
packing until Christmas.
2. Dried fruits and other food pro
ducts should be packed in small tin
or wooden boxes, one-quarter to one
half pound size.
3. Hard candy, including chocolate,
would probably be safe in tin foil or
heavy cardboard, but no soft choco
lates nor anything that could be pos
sibly crushed should be used, as other
contents of the package might be
spoiled thereby.
4. Several dainties packed in oblong
tin boxes, each holding a quarter of
a pound, will provide a better variety
for the packet than a larger quantity
of a single confection.
5. No liquids or articles packed in
glass should be placed in the package.
6. For wrapping the gifts use a
khaki-colored handkerchief, 27 inches
square, and form the base of the
packet by placing on the center of
the handkerchief a pad of writing
paper about 7 by 10 inches.
7. Select a variety of articles either
from the suggested list or according
to individual wishes to an amount not
exceeding one dollar and a half, and
arrange them on the pad of paper so
that the entire package shall be the
width of the pad and approximately
five or six inches high.
S. Wrap and tie with one-inch red
ribbon and place a Christmas card
under the ribbon. A card bearing the
greetings of the chapter would be de
sirable.
112Â». Wrap the parcel in heavy manila
paper, and tie securely.
