# "American Girl on Trial" Is Successful Y.W. Play
## 
### 
"The American Girl on Trial" was
successfully given by the Y. W. C. A.
in the Little Theater, yesterday after
noon, and showed how little the Amer
ican woman has done to aid her allies
in this war. Proof against the Amer
ican Girl was offered by girls from
France, Russia, and Armenia, and by
the Red Cross girl, who alone has
aided all countries. The American
girl, awakened to her responsibilities,
seriously promised to help.
