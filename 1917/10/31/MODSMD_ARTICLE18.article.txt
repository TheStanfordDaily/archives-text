# Free Kicks

Captain Pettingill showed in last
night's game that he has lost none of
his power as a forward. The big fel
low was in every play and lifted the
fast Freshmen forwards aronnd at
will. When Pettingill gets into ac
tion in the Santa Clara game fans
may expect better play than ever be
fore.

Reynolds tackles better than any of
the Freshmen. In the game last night
the fullback brought his men down in
great style, in addition to effective
kicks to touch.

"Dink" Templeton made enough
points to beat the Freshmen alone
last night. He was responsible for
two drop kicks for six points and ad
ded two more with a conversion of
Chandler's try.

The combination in the backfield
that Coach Wylie started for the
Freshmen last night looks better than
any he has putin before. The men
who lined up were Doe at half, Dever
eaux at first five, Parker at second
five, Morse at center three, and Falk
and Repath at wings, with Reynolds
completing the backs at full.
