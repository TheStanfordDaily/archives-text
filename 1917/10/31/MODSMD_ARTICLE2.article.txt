with the speedy aggregation of the
San Francisco Olympic Club, on Sat
urday next at 1:30 p.m., 011 the local
baseball lot. This game, which was

pearance of the season in a regular

The contest will be run off before
the Freshman same with Santa Clara,
in order that soccer fans may be able
to witness the bigger attraction. Al
though an almost entirely new team
will make its debut, the tussle should
not be without its thrills, for several
men have been showing up well in
the practices of late, and may be ex
pected to give a good account of
themselves, Saturday. Yewell, Drury,
and Roney are the veterans around
whom the new team must be built.
However, Say, Wing, and Wedell are
men of Second Varsity experience, and
may be expected to appear in Satur
day's lineup.
Prospects for a winning soccer ag
gregation in the big contest with Cali
fornia are considerably brightened by
the fact that freshmen will be eligible
for the Varsity. In the latest athletic
agreements with University of Cali
fornia the freshmen ruling was not
not made to include soccer. Fresh
man material is showing up to good
advantage in the practices, but more
1021 material is desired in order that
a strong aggregation may be sent to
meet the Berkeley babes.
The team to represent tne Cardinal
in Saturday's contest, will be picked
from the following men: Drury, Hean,
Esgen, Pillsbury, Roney, Say, Wing,
forwards; Newland, Brill, Yewell,
