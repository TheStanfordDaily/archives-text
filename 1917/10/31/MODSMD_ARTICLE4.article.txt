# Wilbur Addresses City Mass Meetings
## 
### 
Mass meetings in San Francisco to
day heard Dr. Wilbur outline the na
tional plan for l'ood conservation,
which is being pushed in the nation
wide campaign during the present
week.
President Wilbur, as chairman of
the committee which has charge of
the food-saving drive, placed before
the housekeepers of San Francisco
the absolute necessity of cutting down
consumption in America, of the ele
ments of food most necessary for the
armies of our allies, wheat, meat,
sugar, and fats. Following mass
meetings which outline the necessary
efforts on the part of American house
wives, personal canvass is made of all
homes, to secure signatures to a
pledge that the suggestions of the
Food Conservation Committee, work
ing under direction of Food Adminis
trator Hoover, will be as faithfully
adhered to as possible.
The San Francisco meeting this af
ternoon took place in the Lowell High
School building, at 1 o'clock, and at
the Polytechnic High School building
immediately following that.
