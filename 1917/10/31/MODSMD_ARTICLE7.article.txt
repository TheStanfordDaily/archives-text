that the Freshmen should win their
big game against the Santa Clara

: play the style of Rugby they know
how to put up. The Saintly crew from
down the bay is confident they can
1 wipe the ground with any team Stan
-1 ford ever turned out, but the men
I who have coached the Cardinal this
year think otherwise, and Saturday's
; game will furnish the first opportunity
to settle the question.
All is in readiness for the big con
test with the exception of announcing
| the teams. Coach Wylie will select
I his men after the Palo Alto High
I School game tonight, taking into con
