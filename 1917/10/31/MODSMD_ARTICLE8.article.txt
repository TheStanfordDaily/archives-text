### 
| Rolling up a score of 11 points, the
I Senior Class Rugby fifteen, with the
aid of "Dink" Templeton, defeated the
j Freshmen in the final interclass strug
gle. The Freshmen were allowed to
j collect a total of 5 points.
During the first half of pla.v, the
j Freshmen had everything their own
i way. All of the play was on the Sen
| ior 25-yard line, finally culminating
|in a score, Devereaux cross-kicking
to Morse, who made the try, Doe con-
I verting. The Seniors were unable to
; push the ball over the line until the
| second half, when Chandler counted
j on a passing rush, Hauser to Gianelli
j to Chandler.
Templeton dropped two kicks over
the bar, one of them being from a dif
! ficult. angle, and converted the try.
i His long touch boots and Doc's short
overhead kicks, were features of the
contest.
The baby scrum put it over the
sombrero pack, both in heeling the
pigskin out, and in general forward
work, but the Senior hackfleld worked
almost perfectly. The Freshmen backs
I were a little out of form both in of
\ tensive and defensive work.
Coach Wylie gave substitutes of
both teams a chance in the second
j half to get into the game.
Prior to the game, H. I'. Hauser
of the Varsity, was chosen leader
of the Seniors against Herb Morse,
j captain pro tem of the Freshmen.
