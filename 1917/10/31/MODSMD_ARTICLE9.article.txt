# Honor Societies Select New Men For Membership
## 
### 
Two of the most important Stan
' ford honor societies have selected the
members to be added to their ranks
this semester. Quadrangle Club, elec
tion to which is probably the greatest
recognition of prominence in college
[affairs that the University possesses.
I has added its usual quota of four new
members. I. C. Heron. '18, H. P.
Mauser, '18, W. L. Miller, r l7, and W.
D. Smalley, '18, are the men selected
this quarter.
Heron is the present president of
the student body, a former crew man,
a member of Encina Club, and an as
pirant for th football team this se
mester. Hauser is Graduate Manager
and prospective half-back on the Var
sity Rugby team; he is a member of
Encina Club. Miller is Student Ad
viser, weight man on the track team,
and a member of Delta Chi fraternity.
Smalley is editor of The Daily Palo
Alto and a member of Phi Gamma
Delta. Dr. Frank Angell, A. E. Wor
thy, '15, and N. S. Pettingill, '17, are
the three old members back in col
lege.
The new men were elected in ac
cordance with the principle of Quad
rangle Club, to chose their members
from men holding the most prominent |
and important positions in student af
fairs. The initiations will probably be
held this week.
Skull and Snakes, the larger of the
two honor societies, elected twelve
new members last evening, choosing
them, as is the custom, from the upper
classes. H. P. Hauser, '18, VV. L. Mil

semi-public initiation will be held.
