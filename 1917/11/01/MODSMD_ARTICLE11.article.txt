# January 9 Date for Opera Plots
## Committee Arangements Well Under Way for Musical Comedy 
### 
Naming January 9 as the final date
for submission of all manuscripts for
the Junior Opera was the principal
business attended to by the Junior
Opera Committee at the meeting at
the Delta Gamma house last evening.
It is understood that work is already
being started on several of these
manuscripts and so the committee ex
pects to have a good field to choose
from when the specified time arrives.
Negotiations are now being entered
into for the purpose of finding a suit
able director. Dick Morgan has
coached the last few Junior Operas,
but the committee has not yet heard
from him upon the question of coach
ing this year's musical production.
Suitable orchestration has always
been a problem in the past Junior
Operas, and so the committee has de
cided to obviate this difficulty, by
starting this quarter to training a com
petent orchestra. Should campus tal
ent prove insufficient or unwilling to
cope with the situation, the committee
plans going outside of the University
to secure its music.
To maintain the standard of former
operas and yet not to succumb to the
obstacles of the high cost of living
and raise the customary admission
prices, is a big problem that the com
mittee has to meet. However, it is
definitely announced that only in the
utmost emergency will the prices of
tickets be raised.
The Junior Opera will take place
in Junior Week as usual, towards the
end of the second quarter, which will
probably be some time late in March.
