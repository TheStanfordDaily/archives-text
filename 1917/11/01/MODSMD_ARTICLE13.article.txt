## Wylie Selects Best Fifteen in Years for Game TEAM FLAY WILL FEATURE CONTEST Santa Clarans Should Lose to Cardinals According to Dope Sheet 
### 
(Jl. (i. Sweiulsen, '20.)
Coaches Wylie and Von Monder
scheid, at the helm for Stanford and
; Santa Clara in football, have an
-1 nonnced the teams that will line ui)
for the big game Saturday afternoon
on the Cardinal turf. In the main the
combinations are the same as in the
last few games, but some changes
and surprises were sprung by the
two mentors.
FRESHMAN TEAM
IS POWERFUL
Coach Wylie has chosen probably the
strongest Freshmen fifteen that has
been together at the University for
several years. The babes have not
only been drilled until they are a sin
gle unit in play but stars of the first
magnitude added to the combination.
Taken as a whole, the team looks to
be an unbeatable combination against
the Mission Town ruggers.
SANTA CLARANS
HANDICAPPED
Von Monderscheid has chosen his
| men from their appearance against the
Varsity and has included several play
| ers who will be seen on the turf No
| vember 24. The Santa Clara fifteen
I will be under the handicap of being a
paper team, however, since there has
been no competition for the first-year
men this season.
At any rate the Stanford men have
shown fight both on the defense and
I offense that has been an object of won
der to the bleacher warmers. During
the early part of the season "dope
i sters" were of the opinion that the
j first-year men could not tackle, but
, the Lowell game and the Senior con
| test dispelled that illusion for the
, backs have been "getting their man''
|on every occasion while the scrum
seems impregnable.
FRONT RANK MEN
LOOK GOOD
In the front rank Coach Wylie has
chosen Henry and Dickey, a fightin.u
combination from the first whistle.
[Substituting for them will be Marx, a
player who is just a little behind the
< two regulars. These men assure more
than an equal chance for the backs.
At lock is Clark, a big fellow, and a
hard man for the opposition forwards.
At side rank the fails will see some
phenomenal play from Campbell and
Patrick. Campbell has worlds of
speed, in addition to his ability in fol
lowing the pigskin, while Patrick ha?
counted in every minute of play during
the season. Wallace and Adams, at
rear rank, complete the list of for
wards. These last two men put the
weight in the scrum and finish a unit
which looks good with any combina
tion Von Monderscheid may turn out.
