## Wylie Selects Best Fifteen in Years for Game TEAM FLAY WILL FEATURE CONTEST Santa Clarans Should Lose to Cardinals According to Dope Sheet 
### 
(Jl. (i. Sweiulsen, '20.)
Coaches Wylie and Von Monder
scheid, at the helm for Stanford and
; Santa Clara in football, have an
-1 nonnced the teams that will line ui)
for the big game Saturday afternoon
on the Cardinal turf. In the main the
combinations are the same as in the
last few games, but some changes
and surprises were sprung by the
two mentors.
FRESHMAN TEAM
IS POWERFUL
Coach Wylie has chosen probably the
strongest Freshmen fifteen that has
been together at the University for
several years. The babes have not
only been drilled until they are a sin
gle unit in play but stars of the first
magnitude added to the combination.
Taken as a whole, the team looks to
be an unbeatable combination against
the Mission Town ruggers.
SANTA CLARANS
HANDICAPPED
Von Monderscheid has chosen his
| men from their appearance against the
Varsity and has included several play
| ers who will be seen on the turf No
| vember 24. The Santa Clara fifteen
I will be under the handicap of being a
paper team, however, since there has
been no competition for the first-year
men this season.
At any rate the Stanford men have
shown fight both on the defense and
I offense that has been an object of won
der to the bleacher warmers. During
the early part of the season "dope
i sters" were of the opinion that the
j first-year men could not tackle, but
, the Lowell game and the Senior con
| test dispelled that illusion for the
, backs have been "getting their man''
|on every occasion while the scrum
seems impregnable.
FRONT RANK MEN
LOOK GOOD
In the front rank Coach Wylie has
chosen Henry and Dickey, a fightin.u
combination from the first whistle.
[Substituting for them will be Marx, a
player who is just a little behind the
< two regulars. These men assure more
than an equal chance for the backs.
At lock is Clark, a big fellow, and a
hard man for the opposition forwards.
At side rank the fails will see some
phenomenal play from Campbell and
Patrick. Campbell has worlds of
speed, in addition to his ability in fol
lowing the pigskin, while Patrick ha?
counted in every minute of play during
the season. Wallace and Adams, at
rear rank, complete the list of for
wards. These last two men put the
weight in the scrum and finish a unit
which looks good with any combina
tion Von Monderscheid may turn out.
Substituting among the forwards are
Marx at front rank Van Cliff at lock,
Hanson at side rank, and Wright at
rear rank, though any of these men
are good for other positions in the
scrum.
Scofleld, a product of the Palo Alto
High School, will hold the place of
wing-forward, a position which has
not been seen for a Stanford team in
a big game for some years. Scofield
is the hardest working man on the
Freshmen fifteen and will put up a
good contest both in smearing and
advancing the ball. Stolz will substi
tute at this position.
Doe at half will start the plays for
the backfield, in addition to handling
most of the kicking. Many people
think the little fellow is a star among
stars, and he can be looked to for
many phenomenal plays. Devereaux
will receive the passes at first five.
There are fe wmen who are more
dangerous on the offense than this
first five, while his extraordinary
speed allows him to tackle almost at
will. Sheldon will hold down the
second five position, and his rushes
should feature the game. Morse, an
other Palo Alto star, will play at cen
ter three-quarters. The little fellow
has earned his position through con
sistent gains all through the season.
At wings will be Falk and Repath.
Falk is perhaps the most dangerous
man among the Freshmen. He sel
dom misses a tackle, and is always
good for a try after he gets under
way, due to his great speed. Rey
nolds completes the backs at full back.
"Jimmy" is a tackling demon and a
very accurate kicker.
Substitutes for the backs are Nagel,
Parker, Templeton, and Dinkelspiel.
These men are good for practically
any position, although Nagel looks bet
ter at half or first five, with Parker
at second five or wing, Templeton at
center three or full, and Dinkelspiel
at wing.
Since only four substitutes are to
be allowed under the rules of the con
test ,the men who may go in are still
doubtful. It is a hard task to pick
the four best, men, however, and those
who do go in will be able to take up
the task in good shape.
Both fifteens will have only light
practices tomorrow and will be in
good shape by Saturday. Stanford
has no injured men out of the game
and will be in perfect condition.
George A. Faulkner, '10, will handle
the whistle in the game, which starts
at 2:30. Time of halves will be thirty
minutes.
In the preliminary game last night
the Freshmen won from Palo Alto 23
to 0. Coach Wylie used his second
string men with the exception of Doe,
Dickey, Reynolds, and Adams. Palo
Alto was not able to stop the backfield
rushes of the babes. Coach Wylie
picked his substitutes largely from
their showing last night.

the Freshmen won from Palo Alto 23
to 0. Coach Wylie used his second
string men with the exception of Doe,
Dickey, Reynolds, and Adams. Palo
Alto was not able to stop the backfield
rushes of the babes. Coach Wylie
picked his substitutes largely from
their showing last night.

for the big game Saturday afternoon
on the Cardinal turf. In the main the
combinations are the same as in the
last few games, but some changes
and surprises were sprung by the
two mentors.
FRESHMAN TEAM
IS POWERFUL
Coach Wylie has chosen probably the
strongest Freshmen fifteen that has
been together at the University for
several years. The babes have not
only been drilled until they are a sin
gle unit in play but stars of the first
magnitude added to the combination.
Taken as a whole, the team looks to
be an unbeatable combination against
the Mission Town ruggers.
SANTA CLARANS
HANDICAPPED
Von Monderscheid has chosen his
| men from their appearance against the
Varsity and has included several play
| ers who will be seen on the turf No
| vember 24. The Santa Clara fifteen
I will be under the handicap of being a
paper team, however, since there has
been no competition for the first-year
men this season.
At any rate the Stanford men have
shown fight both on the defense and
I offense that has been an object of won
der to the bleacher warmers. During
the early part of the season "dope
i sters" were of the opinion that the
j first-year men could not tackle, but
, the Lowell game and the Senior con
| test dispelled that illusion for the
, backs have been "getting their man''
|on every occasion while the scrum
seems impregnable.
FRONT RANK MEN
LOOK GOOD
In the front rank Coach Wylie has
chosen Henry and Dickey, a fightin.u
combination from the first whistle.
[Substituting for them will be Marx, a
player who is just a little behind the
< two regulars. These men assure more
than an equal chance for the backs.
At lock is Clark, a big fellow, and a
hard man for the opposition forwards.
At side rank the fails will see some
phenomenal play from Campbell and
Patrick. Campbell has worlds of
speed, in addition to his ability in fol
lowing the pigskin, while Patrick ha?
counted in every minute of play during
the season. Wallace and Adams, at
rear rank, complete the list of for
wards. These last two men put the
weight in the scrum and finish a unit
which looks good with any combina
tion Von Monderscheid may turn out.
Substituting among the forwards are
Marx at front rank Van Cliff at lock,
Hanson at side rank, and Wright at
rear rank, though any of these men
are good for other positions in the
scrum.
Scofleld, a product of the Palo Alto
High School, will hold the place of
wing-forward, a position which has
not been seen for a Stanford team in
a big game for some years. Scofield
is the hardest working man on the
Freshmen fifteen and will put up a
good contest both in smearing and
advancing the ball. Stolz will substi
tute at this position.
Doe at half will start the plays for
the backfield, in addition to handling
most of the kicking. Many people
think the little fellow is a star among
stars, and he can be looked to for
many phenomenal plays. Devereaux
will receive the passes at first five.
There are fe wmen who are more
dangerous on the offense than this
first five, while his extraordinary
speed allows him to tackle almost at
will. Sheldon will hold down the
second five position, and his rushes
should feature the game. Morse, an
other Palo Alto star, will play at cen
ter three-quarters. The little fellow
has earned his position through con
sistent gains all through the season.
At wings will be Falk and Repath.
Falk is perhaps the most dangerous
man among the Freshmen. He sel
dom misses a tackle, and is always
good for a try after he gets under
way, due to his great speed. Rey
nolds completes the backs at full back.
"Jimmy" is a tackling demon and a
very accurate kicker.
Substitutes for the backs are Nagel,
Parker, Templeton, and Dinkelspiel.
These men are good for practically
any position, although Nagel looks bet
ter at half or first five, with Parker
at second five or wing, Templeton at
center three or full, and Dinkelspiel
at wing.
Since only four substitutes are to
be allowed under the rules of the con
test ,the men who may go in are still
doubtful. It is a hard task to pick
the four best, men, however, and those
who do go in will be able to take up
the task in good shape.
Both fifteens will have only light
practices tomorrow and will be in
good shape by Saturday. Stanford
has no injured men out of the game
and will be in perfect condition.
George A. Faulkner, '10, will handle
the whistle in the game, which starts
at 2:30. Time of halves will be thirty
minutes.

the whistle in the game, which starts
at 2:30. Time of halves will be thirty
minutes.
In the preliminary game last night
the Freshmen won from Palo Alto 23
to 0. Coach Wylie used his second
string men with the exception of Doe,
Dickey, Reynolds, and Adams. Palo
Alto was not able to stop the backfield
rushes of the babes. Coach Wylie
picked his substitutes largely from
their showing last night.

Coaches Wylie and Von Monder
scheid, at the helm for Stanford and
; Santa Clara in football, have an
-1 nonnced the teams that will line ui)
for the big game Saturday afternoon
on the Cardinal turf. In the main the
combinations are the same as in the
last few games, but some changes
and surprises were sprung by the
two mentors.
FRESHMAN TEAM
IS POWERFUL
Coach Wylie has chosen probably the
strongest Freshmen fifteen that has
been together at the University for
several years. The babes have not
only been drilled until they are a sin
gle unit in play but stars of the first
magnitude added to the combination.
Taken as a whole, the team looks to
be an unbeatable combination against
the Mission Town ruggers.
SANTA CLARANS
HANDICAPPED
Von Monderscheid has chosen his
| men from their appearance against the
Varsity and has included several play
| ers who will be seen on the turf No
| vember 24. The Santa Clara fifteen
I will be under the handicap of being a
paper team, however, since there has
been no competition for the first-year
men this season.
At any rate the Stanford men have
shown fight both on the defense and
I offense that has been an object of won
der to the bleacher warmers. During
the early part of the season "dope
i sters" were of the opinion that the
j first-year men could not tackle, but
, the Lowell game and the Senior con
| test dispelled that illusion for the
, backs have been "getting their man''
|on every occasion while the scrum
seems impregnable.
FRONT RANK MEN
LOOK GOOD
In the front rank Coach Wylie has
chosen Henry and Dickey, a fightin.u
combination from the first whistle.
[Substituting for them will be Marx, a
player who is just a little behind the
< two regulars. These men assure more
than an equal chance for the backs.
At lock is Clark, a big fellow, and a
hard man for the opposition forwards.
At side rank the fails will see some
phenomenal play from Campbell and
Patrick. Campbell has worlds of
speed, in addition to his ability in fol
lowing the pigskin, while Patrick ha?
counted in every minute of play during
the season. Wallace and Adams, at
rear rank, complete the list of for
wards. These last two men put the
weight in the scrum and finish a unit
which looks good with any combina
tion Von Monderscheid may turn out.
Substituting among the forwards are
Marx at front rank Van Cliff at lock,
Hanson at side rank, and Wright at
rear rank, though any of these men
are good for other positions in the
scrum.
Scofleld, a product of the Palo Alto
High School, will hold the place of
wing-forward, a position which has
not been seen for a Stanford team in
a big game for some years. Scofield
is the hardest working man on the
Freshmen fifteen and will put up a
good contest both in smearing and
advancing the ball. Stolz will substi
tute at this position.
Doe at half will start the plays for
the backfield, in addition to handling
most of the kicking. Many people
think the little fellow is a star among
stars, and he can be looked to for
many phenomenal plays. Devereaux
will receive the passes at first five.
There are fe wmen who are more
dangerous on the offense than this
first five, while his extraordinary
speed allows him to tackle almost at
will. Sheldon will hold down the
second five position, and his rushes
should feature the game. Morse, an
other Palo Alto star, will play at cen
ter three-quarters. The little fellow
has earned his position through con
sistent gains all through the season.
At wings will be Falk and Repath.
Falk is perhaps the most dangerous
man among the Freshmen. He sel
dom misses a tackle, and is always
good for a try after he gets under
way, due to his great speed. Rey
nolds completes the backs at full back.
"Jimmy" is a tackling demon and a
very accurate kicker.
Substitutes for the backs are Nagel,
Parker, Templeton, and Dinkelspiel.
These men are good for practically
any position, although Nagel looks bet
ter at half or first five, with Parker
at second five or wing, Templeton at
center three or full, and Dinkelspiel
at wing.
Since only four substitutes are to
be allowed under the rules of the con
test ,the men who may go in are still
doubtful. It is a hard task to pick
the four best, men, however, and those
who do go in will be able to take up
the task in good shape.
Both fifteens will have only light
practices tomorrow and will be in
good shape by Saturday. Stanford
has no injured men out of the game
and will be in perfect condition.
George A. Faulkner, '10, will handle
the whistle in the game, which starts
at 2:30. Time of halves will be thirty
