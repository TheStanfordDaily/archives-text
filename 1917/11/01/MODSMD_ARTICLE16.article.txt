A few words can often make or save a peck of trouble. The heading at
the top of this column can be applied in this regard probably no place bet
ter than in discussing the affairs of a University such as Stanford. In
stances of this are arising constantly.
We recently commented editorially on an article which appeared in one
of the city papers to the effect that Stanford was about to return to Ameri
can football. The rumor was entirely unfounded and it later developed that
its origin was in a conversation the writer of the article had with a Stan
ford student. During the conversation the writer asked what students
thought in regard to returning to the American game. The student replied
to the effect that a change would likelySe made and this unfounded statement
given was the basis for the article.
The impression outsiders, unfamiliar with true conditions at Stanford,
receive, is entirely dependent on the residents of the Stanford community.
If students constantly give the impression that the University is lacking
in the attractiveness which formerly made its name famous throughout the
country, that is the idea they will have of us and will accept it as a govern
ing factor when considering Stanford. We do not wish to imply that stu
dents should deliberately convey information contrary to their personal be
liefs but we do believe it a fair exchange for them not to give out any
thing which could be falsely interpreted, especially if there is a possibility
of its going into print. A little thought in discussing University affairs
will go a long way toward dealing out the justice to the University, faculty,
and student body that they deserve.
