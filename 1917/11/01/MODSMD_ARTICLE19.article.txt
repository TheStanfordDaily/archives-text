# UNION ELECTION SET FOR TUESDAY
## 
### 
Executive Committee of the Board
of Directors of the Stanford Union
met yesterday and set the date for the
annual election of members to that
body for Tuesday, November 6. Polls
will be open at the Union on that day
between the hours of 11 a.m. and 2
p.m. Three men are to be named for
the executive committee and will be
chosen from the four nominated last
week at the Union smoker.
It was also decided to reserve the
room now being used for a reading
room, as a study and meeting cham
ber, realizing the need of such a place
in the Union. The popular magazines
and newspapers will be placed in the
main lounging room. The manager
will keep a calendar of meetings, so
that organizations may reserve dates
in advance for the use of the room.
