Campus food administration, al
though with many modifications from
the original plan, is now an estab
lished faet, following a meeting of
house managers last night at the Kap
pa Alpha house. Practically all of
the men's living groups have entered
the agreement. R. M. Jones, '20, the
food administrator, lias opened head
quarters in the Stanford Union, and is
collecting data for the most econom
ical purchase of supplies in large
quanties. Contracts for many staples
will be let in the near future, partly
in Palo Alto and partly in San Fran
cisco.
As originally proposed, the cooper
ative plan included a central system
of bookkeeping for the various houses,
but this part of the plan has not been
found feasible at the present time.
The present organization does not bind
the living groups in any way, and the
powers of the central administration
are largely advisory.
