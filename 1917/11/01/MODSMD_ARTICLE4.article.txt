# Jerome B. Landfield Speaks on Russia
## Predicts Revolution Against the Revolutionists Within Few Months 
### 
"It is safe to predict a counter-revo
lution in Russia, within the next two
or three months," states James Maker
Landfield, noted student and authority
on Russian history, in his address this
morning at the regular assembly, on
"Russia's Trial." "This revolution
will not be for a return of the old
rule," he continued, "but a revolution
against the revolutionists. Russia is
to suffer this winter, as never before.
Tens of thousands of her people will
die, and the new government will be
held responsible and be made to an
swer."
"The former government was a pure
ly mechanical system," said Mr. Land
field in a summary of tHo government
before the revolution, "ft strove to
crush all individualism and curb all
that and speech against it. German
influence was favored by the ruling
class because they saw the need of
stronger organization and guidance of
the people. The efficiency of Prussian
ism appealed to them. The outbreak
of the war diverted the inevitable rev
olution for the time being, but again
the two-sideness and inefficiency of
the government brought on the crisis."
"Although the revolution was a suc
cess, the government established is a
| failure. 1 tis fast becoming unpopular
with the bulk of the Russian people.
It, too, has proven inadequate and in
efficient for the needs of the people."
Mr. Landfield is a member of the
faculty of the University of California
and is known internationally as a fore
; most student and historian. He stud
j ied for a number of years in Russia
and is thoroughy lacquainted with the
situation. His wife is a Russian
.
princess.
