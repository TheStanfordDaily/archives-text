# Y.M.C.A. RELIEF WORK ORGANIZED
## 
### 
Organization for Stanford's share of
work in the big national $35,00,000
campaign for war relief from Novem
ber 11 to November 19, is well under
way, according to announcement from
the local Young Men's and Yonug
Women's Christian Associations, to
day. The executive committee, com
posed of officers of the two organiza
tions, and the faculty committee, with
Professor R. E. Swain of the Chem
istry department as chairman, is al
ready at work. Dean C. A. Huston of
the Law School will be the treasurer
of the local campaign.
That the work of the Y. M. C. A. and
the Y. W. C. A. in the armies of the
United States and the Allies, and
among the six millions of suffering
war prisoners of Europe, is invalu
able, is unquestionable. It is esti
mated by military authorities that a
revitalization of the Russian army
will save a million lives on the west
ern front. The "Y" is the only agency
through which such a revitalization
can be accomplished. Major-General
Hugh L. Scott, who was a member of
President Wilson's Commission to
Russia, says: "Every idea that reaches
i the Russian people now will bear
I
fruit —good or evil, according to what
lis sown —for many years to come. It
is for this reason that I am deeply
interested in the great effort which is
j being made to raise a large sum for
the prosecution of the work of the
; Young Men's Christian Association in
j Russia. It appeals to me as an Amer
ican, as a soldier, and as a Christian;
'it will hel]) the Russians and it will
! also help us."
| The budget which the national or
ganization has prepared includes $11,-
1 120,000 for work in the United States
army and navy at home, $11,994,000
j for work with the American army and
' navy overseas, $3,305,000 for work in
; the Russian army, $3,649,000 for work
|in the French and Italian armies, and
$1,000,000 for work in the prisons
j camps, making a total of $35,000,000.
Of this amount which die nation has
taken upon itself to raise, Stanford
will endeavor to gather together
$»i,OOO. The sum of $50,000 has been
allotted to California universities and
colleges, of which University of Cali
fornia will raise $25,000.
