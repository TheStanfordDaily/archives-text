# Moonlight Night Brings Out Encina Pajamarino
## 
### 
Encina Club's annual Pee-jama Pee
j rade held forth last night with the
I Hall men lined up, pajama-clad, in
; front of Encina at 7:30. Accompanied
by much noise produced by means of
I tin cans, cow bells, cat-calls, and what
jnot, the mob made a most successful
raid of the, campus, beginning with
Roble Hall, and singing through the
Quad to the Row, where, after num
erous visits to porches of sororities,
they lined up before the Beta Theta
Pi house. Newly elected cheer-pro-
Iducers appeared and led in yells for
I the Varsity.
