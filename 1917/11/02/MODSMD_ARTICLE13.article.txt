### 
Stanford rooters will occupy
bleachers opposite those used for
preliminary games. The kick-off
will come at 2:;]<), preceded by the
finish of the interclass cross-coun
try run. Admission is fifty cents.

Santa Clara and Stanford will
tangle in their first intercollegiate
contest of the 1917 season, when the
freshmen of the two universites line
up on the Cardinal turf tomorrow af
ternoon. Referee George A. Faulkner,
'10, will blow his whistle promptly at
2:30, and the game will be on. From
the lineups and preliminary dope on
the two teams, bleacher warmers can
sit back and be prepared for the best
Rugby battle of the present season.
Fifty Cents Admission.
As usual for the freshman big game
fifty cents will be required for admis
sion, this to include the varsity con
test also. Time of halves will be
thirty minutes each, and each coach
will be allowed four substitutes.
Graduate Manager Mauser hag com
pleted the arrangements for the con
test with the announcement that
"Bud" Larkin, ex-'2O, -will act as Stan
ford's linesman.
Stanford North Bleachers.
Stanford rooters will, as usual, take
[the north or sunny side of the bleach
ers, and Yell Leader G. H. Luhrs, '18,
will be 011 hand to liven the fans with
his two assistants, Antrim and Doron.
In addition the Stanford band will be
out to boost the occasion along.
Coach Von Monderschied put his
men through a hard scrimmage
against the varsity at Santa Clara,
then after a battle against San Jose
high school he picked his men for the
big show. Several varsity men are
included in the list but in general the
players are new to Stanford dopesters,
and are therefore an unknown quan
tity.
Manelli and Errario will hold down
the front rank positions, with Car
mella backing them up at lock. Dana
and Berg will push at side rank, while
Sheehy and Kerchoff complete the
scrum at rear rank. Wing forward
will be played by Heafey. Young at
half will start the passes and Garcia
will play first five. This little fellow
is perhaps the most dangerous man
on the offense, Santa Clara has.
O'Connor will receive the passes at
second five, while Merritt plays at
center three. Wings are Grace and
.Judge, with Larey completing the
| backs at full. The only substitutes
; named by the Santa Clara mentor are
Pipes, Davitt, and Bartona.
The Mission Town fans are coming
in force for the contest. A special
train will leave Santa Clara at 1
o'clock and will return immediately
after the varsity game is completed.
The dope sheet for the Santa Clara
freshmen shows that they have an
equal chance with the Stanford men,
but the games played were later in
the season than those by the Cardinal
fifteen. In the first contest Oakland
and the Missionites played a 0 to 0 tie,
the same score Stanford registered
against this team. San Jose fell be
fore Santa Clara 33 to 5. Stanford
has not met this combination. The
dope can give no real forecast of the
outcome, however. The fact remains
that if Santa Clara wins they will
have developed a team better than
those of recent years at the University
down the bay.

the front rank positions, with Car

and Berg will push at side rank, while
Sheehy and Kerchoff complete the

will be played by Heafey. Young at

on the offense, Santa Clara has.
O'Connor will receive the passes at
second five, while Merritt plays at
center three. Wings are Grace and
.Judge, with Larey completing the

The dope sheet for the Santa Clara
freshmen shows that they have an
equal chance with the Stanford men,
but the games played were later in
the season than those by the Cardinal
fifteen. In the first contest Oakland
and the Missionites played a 0 to 0 tie,
the same score Stanford registered
against this team. San Jose fell be
fore Santa Clara 33 to 5. Stanford
has not met this combination. The
dope can give no real forecast of the
outcome, however. The fact remains
that if Santa Clara wins they will
have developed a team better than
those of recent years at the University
down the bay.

Coach Von Monderschied put his
men through a hard scrimmage
