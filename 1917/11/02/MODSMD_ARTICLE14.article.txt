# Football "Chappie" Tackles Campus Wit
## Old-time Brush Wielders With New Talent Produce Clever Monthly Edition 
### 
Chaparral, arrayed in football togs
and oozing football from almost every
page, appears on the campus Monday
in its second issue of the quarter.
Managing Editor S. E. Briggs, *19, has
collected an assortment of graduate
and undergraduate contributions of
such a caliber that the coming issue
will in no way fall short of Chappie's
high standard, despite the unfortunate
vacancies upon the staff list. Art tal
ent lias been especially forthcoming
with the old reliable artists being ably
assisted by several '21 brush wielders.
"Mike" Oliver, Chappie Art editor in
1915, lias drawn the cover, which is
an appropriate one for the football
theme that runs throughout the issue.
"Monk" Antrim has a page devoted en
tirely to queeners, which is done in
this artist's inimitable style.
Niel Wilson, '12, contributes a semi
serious opening verse of the by-gone
days, while from France conies a con
tribution from a Chappie man in th<
service, "Hob" Donaldson, '17. with a
diary of events in the war zone. Edi
t.orially speaking, Chappie strongly
urges against sitting with one's fav
orite lady at the Santa Clara game,
rather than in the rooting section,
where husky voices belong.
To show that campus talent is re
sponding to the demands of Chaparral,
Editor Driggs points to the array of
non-staff contributors in this issue,
which includes Ceroid Robinson, '17,
Mel Levi, '18, Ceorge Kockcr, '19, M.
L. Levy, '19. A. S. Glikbarg, '19, "Yank"
