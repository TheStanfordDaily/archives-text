Freshman football holds the center of attraction for the week-end.
Coach Wylie has announced the pick of the first-year Rugby aspirants to
start the game against Santa Clara tomorrow. The Freshmen have devel
oped a wonderful machine despite the short season and the fact that many
of them are new at. the same.
Santa Clara will come up here with the best they can offer. In addi
tion to the players they can be counted upon to back their team with a
big rooting section. Their enthusiasm over this game is increased because
of last year's victory. This year they will find a different combination
facing them when they take the field and regardless of the outcome, which
we confidently believe will be a Stanford victory, both teams will know
that they have been through a battle.
The Freshmen have not received the support this year they hav <• de
served. They have been playing excellent Rugby all year and from their
performance in the last few games they are primed for their best exhibition
tomorrow. Whatever else may be said for them the chief attraction ot the
combination which will start the game tomorrow, is the fight they show.
They are on their toes every minute. To have a fighting team on the
field, with no support from the bleachers, is a sorry sight. Every Stanfoid
student should be out there tomorrow to back that freshman team. We owe
it to them. We owe it to Santa Clara to show them just how much we are
behind football this year and give them a taste of what sort ot bleacher
competition they can expect on November 24. ———————
