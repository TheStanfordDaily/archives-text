# Officers Will Not Train at Presidio
## 
### 
Stanford men successful in gaining
admission to the third officers' train
ing camp will probably be sent either
to American Lake or Linda Vista, ac
cording to information gained yester
day from Major .fens Bugge. These
two camps are the only training quar
ters in this district for men expecting
to become officers. This means that
no men will be sent to the Presidio at
San Francisco, as heretofore.
Those men from here, who pass tlie
entrance examination given by Major
Bugge, will be permitted to enter the
! camp directly from Stanford. They
will receive the pay of a first class
! private, $30 a month, plus food, cloth
| ing, and quarters. The successful
men who receive recommendations for
a commission, will he held in reserve
to fill vacancies as they occur in the
Regular Army, National Army, and
National Guards.
Application blanks must be filled out
and in the hands of Major Bugge on or
before December 1.
