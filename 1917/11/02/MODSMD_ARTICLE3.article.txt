# HONOR HOPKINS IN RENAMING MARINE SCHOOL
## 
### 
"Hopkins Marine Station of Leland
Stanford Junior University" is the of
ficial name given by the Trustees to
the new marine biological laboratory
just completed at Pacific Grove, Presi
dent Wilbur announced this afternoon.
The action was taken to honor Tim
othy Hopkins of Menlo Park, a life
Trustee of the University.
Mr. Hopkins was instrumental in
the establishing of the old marine sta
tion in the early days of Stanford, and
has always done much for the college.
"Without him," said Dr. Wilbur, "no
marine station would have been pos
sible when the old station was found
ed; and now that the fine new build
ings have been erected to replace the
outgrown structures, the Hoard of
Trustees considered it only proper ro
bestow Mr. Hopkins' name upon the
improved equipment."
The station is located on China
Point and controls a considerable ex
tent of the sea coast.
