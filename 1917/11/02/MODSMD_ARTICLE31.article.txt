For the information of football men,
E. R. Knollin, instructor in Physical
Training announces that they will lie
required to take either soccer or ap
paratus alter the end of the football
season, November iJ4th. He calls their
attention to the fact that here they
have been afforded a privilege not
given in most universities, namely,
that they have been permitted to sub
stitute participation in an athletic
sport for the regular gymnasium work
in working off that requirement of the
Cniversity. In the majority of schools
this requirement must be met irre
