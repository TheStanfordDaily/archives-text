# Chimes Will Bless Bears in Big Game
## 
### 
Ushered in by the pathetically sweet
strains of "Oh God, Our Help in Ages
Past," rung from the chimes of the
Berkeley Campanile, the California
gridiron artists will charge down the
field tomorrow filled with inspiration
in their annual big game with Wash
ington. It will be the first time that
the chimes have ever rung out in
touching melody, and Chimemaster
Gerge Clark, 'IS, has selected this
peculiarly appropriate little ditty, in
order, it seems, to fill the Rerkele.v
Hears with divine fervor in their big
contest.
