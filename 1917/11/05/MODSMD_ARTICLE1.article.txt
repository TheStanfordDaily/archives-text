## Cardinal Fight and Speed Overcome Superiority in Weight Possessed by Santa Clara Babes; Score Is 16-8 
### 
Stanford drew first blood in the
1917 Rugby season when the Cardinal
babes defeated the last Santa Clara
first-year men by the count of 16 to
8 on the Varsity turf last Saturday. :
A better exhibition of football has not
been seen this season nor last, and ;
Stanford only won after showing
Rugby that speaks worlds for the
coaching of Jim Wylie backed up by '
the individual ability of the players.
Referee George Faulkner, '10, blew
his whistle at 2:45, and Santa Clara
kicked off. The ball went outside on
the kick and the ball was scrummed
in the middle of the field. Then began
a rush by the Santa Clara forwards
that took the heart out of the Card
inals. On Stanford's ten-yard line the
Mission men were given a free kick j
and a field goal looked certain until
Clark, for the Freshmen, blocked the
kick, and then began a Stanford rush
to the Santa Clara goal.
After the Cardinal backs got under
way there was no stopping them, and
Stanford went over in short order,
only to be called back for being off
side. After the kick, Clark picked
the ball out of the ruck and started
the rush for the first try. The pass
went from Clark to Devereaux to
Sheldon to Morse to Repatli, who went
over and planted the ball squarely be
tween the posts. Doe converted the
try and the count was 5 to 0.
Stanford's first try seemed to put
more fight into the Santa Clara for

wards and they pushed the ball stead
ily into the Cardinal territory after
the kick-off, and after a line-out of the
ten-yard line, Garcia dove over on a
pass from Young. Larey converted a
difficult one and the score was tied.
After the kick-off the Freshmen took
the Santa Clara men off their feet, and
before the Mission babes could find
their breath the ball was out on the
five-yard line. Santa Clara fought
hard on the throw in, but after see
saw play, Devereaux grabbed the ball
and went over. Doe failed to convert,
vert.
The half ended with the ball in the
middle of the field, following the third
try, and with the count 8 to 5 in favor
of the Cardinal.
With the opening of the second half
both teams put up a harder fight and
some great football was displayed.
After five minutes of play in Santa
Clara territory, Doe passed to Repath
and the little fellow went over for his
second try. Doe failed on the con
version.
There was no more scoring until
the last ten minutes of play. Santa
Clara pushed the ball well ahead with
her forwards, but when the ball was
free Stanford advanced it every time.
Coach Wylie and Coach Von Monder
schied were both forced to use sub
stitutes during this period, and as a
result the play was speeded up con
siderably.
