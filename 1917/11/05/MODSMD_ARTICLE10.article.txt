# Appoint Committees to Control 21 Fire
## 
### 
Two committees from the student
body, one appointed by the president
of the Men's Conference and Council,
and the other by the Executive Com
mittee, will have general supervision
of the 1921 bonfire. They will work
in conjunction, in control of finances,
labor, material and methods, in the
construction of the pre-game pyre.
In view of the limited resources,
both financial and material, available
and allowed for this year's fire, the
step taken was deemed advisable. It
is to insure a preparation for the blaze
that will be free from the outside
criticism that has threatened to in
terfere with the traditional customs
; of the Big Game rally.
It. L. Templeton, '18, is chairman of
the joint committees. C. R. Swarts,
