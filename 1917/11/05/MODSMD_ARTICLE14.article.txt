# NICE WORK FROSH!

### 
That Rugby spirit is not dead by any means was shown last Saturday by
the crowd which witnessed the Freshman game. From the opening whistle
the crowd was on its feet with more "pep" than has been seen at any pre
vious game this season. Whether it was attributable to the tact that Stan
ford and Santa Clara were the contesting teams or whether it was the brand
of Rugby played or a combination of the two, we cannot say. The fact is
that it was there.
Uoth teams seemed to realize from the start of the game to the finish
that a lot depended on their showing and they fought for all they were
worth. Santa Clara looked to have much the heavier team, but that weight
did not make any apparent difference in the final outcome. The passing
of the Freshmen at times was wonderful and undoubtedly their superior
ability in handling the ball was responsible for the Cardinal victory.
The Freshman game should be one of the best boosts the Dig Game
could have. Saturday's game gave the most concrete evidence of the kind of
Rugby the two universities are playing this year and the spirit shown by
the bleachers last Saturday should go a long way toward giving the Big
Game its usual significance. Interest in the remaining pre-season games
should increase steadily so that the Stanford team will go into the tinal c
ontest backed by the best the student body can give in the way of bleacher
support.
