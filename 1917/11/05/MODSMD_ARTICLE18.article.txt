Advanee Expectations.
Fulfilling the prophecies that had
preceded it, the Sophomore Jolly-up,
jheld in the Encina Club Room last
Friday evening ,was declared to be one
j of the best of the informal dances of
the quarter. Well attended by Sopho
more men and a large per cent of the
"500," and with excellent music pro
vided by McNamee's jazz orchestra,
the event could not help but be a suc
cess. The admission fee was fifty
cents a person and a large net sum
was realized by the receipts at the
door. Few upperclassmen gained ad
mission to the jolly-up. The dance
was the first of the season from which
the football men were barred, train

California Wins Over
Washington 27-0.
Football reached the top mark of
the season at Berkeley, on Saturday,
when the Bears gave an overwhelming
defeat of 27 points to 0 to the Univer
sity of Washington team. This ari
umph for California was the first
break in Washington's nine-year
string o fvictories on the gridiron.
The game belonged to California ex
cept at the very start; superior team
work and experience gaining consist
ently against the Washington line
throughout the last three quarters.
The brand of football was not of
the highest, as competition was not
keen enough to force the Bears from
straight football.
California was expected to use tac
tics of the open game, but line-buck
ing proved so successful that the for
ward pass and wide runs were little
resorted to. Washington opened up
the attack in an endeavor to save
something from the crash, but could
not compete.
