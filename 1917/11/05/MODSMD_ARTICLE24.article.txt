# WAR MARKS INCREASE IN FRENCH COURSES
## 
### 
About 42 per cent more students are
majoring in French at Stanford this
year than last, and despite the de
crease in general enrollment at the
University the upper classes in the
Romanic Languages remain about the
same as in 1916-17.
Because of the war, the practical
courses in French are especially at
tractive. Beginning this afternoon,
some 130 students in the Reserve Of
ficers' Training Corps will take up
military-spoken French. There will
be seven sections, meeting once a week
from 4:15 to 6:15 p.m. The entire
Romanic Languages department, with
one exception, will give instruction,
and Major Jens Bugge of the Military
department will assist also.
Professor O. M. Johnston, head of
the Romanic Languages department,
points out that the number of men
majoring in that department is unus
ually large, as heretofore most of the
majors have been women.
The total number of majors in the
department is 94, an increase of 27
over the enrollment for the whole of
last year. The increase in French
majors is 16.
