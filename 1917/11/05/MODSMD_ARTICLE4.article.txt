# Students Must Raise Funds for Bandages
## 
### 
Red Cross work on the campus is to
be actively pressed this week, with
the appointment of a committee of
students to raise funds with which to
purchase material for making band
ages. The Stanford Students' Auxil
iary to the Palo Alto chapter of the
Red Cross has undertaken to furnish
gauze bandages, and money with which
to buy these must come from the stu
dents. A considerable amount is
necessary by Wednesday.
Following is the committee appoint
ed from the men's living groups of the
campus, to whom contributions are
payable: J. T. Wood, '18, Win. Gilroy,
