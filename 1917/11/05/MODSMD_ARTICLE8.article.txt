# DR. WILBUR ADVISES MEN TO REMAIN AT UNIVERSITY
## Men Need to Look Ahead Before Joining Service Says Wilbur Who Believes War Is to Last Many Months 
### 
Military events of the past week will
add a considerable period to the dura
tion of the war, but the Allies will win
in the end. For Stanford students
this condition of affairs demands a
long-sighted policy of working for the
greatest ultimate service to the na
tion through development of brain
power, personality, and ideals of good
citizenship. This is best accomplished
in the University, where all efforts are
now bent to that purpose.
The above, in effect, is the parting
advice of President Wilbur to the Stan
ford student body, for lie leaves tomor
row for lowa City, to attend the an
nual meeting of the Association of
American Universities, and will con
tinue east from there to resume his
work as chief of the Pood Conserva
tion Committee. Dr. Wilbur expects to
devote the remainder of this quarter
to work for the national committee, in
Washington, D. C., but will keep di
rectly in touch with Stanford affairs
from there.
It is in regard to the tendency to
jump from college work into some
branch of service where the individual
cannot be of great value, ultimately,
that President Wilbur now wishes to
warn the students. In this connec
tion lie refers to Secretary Baker's
communication to the public, issued
last summer, urging all men who can
do so, to continue their work in col
lege.
"This does not mean, however," said
Dr. Wilbur, "that if a man is called, I
do not expect him to do his full duty.
Hut until a specific call is made, there
is no necessity for man-power on the

part of the nation, that justifies sacri
fice of greater ability to undertake fu
ture responsibility, for what the aver
age student could do at the present
time, in the ranks."
In order to live up to what is ex
pected of students, however, an intelli
gent estimate of values of university
life is essential, according to the view
of President Wilbur. "This means
willingness to do real work, under
strain. It means the doing of what
ever course of study the student is
taking up, whether for immediate ap
plication, or for civil life after the
war. In addition, a spirit of good citi
zenship must be built up, wherein the
individual is willing to do more than
is actually demanded of him, for the
good of the public. This includes, as
no small factor, the military training
which is now offered by the Univer
sity."
There can be no doubt of President
Wilbur's firm belief that Stanford of
fers exceptional opportunities for the
type of man the nation is hoping to
develop, by keeping students in the
higher institutions during the period
that calls most strongly to the youth
of the nation.
The main [ioint Dr. Wilbur wishes
remembered by the students is that
mere remaining in the University will
not accompish the end desired. There
must be active preparation for a fu
ture part in what threatens to be a
long war. In view of America's posi
tion it is not immediately mobilized
man power that will win, but conser
vation and development of brain power
for future needs.
