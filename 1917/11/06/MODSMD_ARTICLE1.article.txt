### 
With three well-known speakers on
the bill for Thursday's assembly,
Stanford will start its big war relief
campaign with a rush. Chester H.
Rowell, editor of the Fresno Repub
lican; J. E. Sprunger, noted prison
camp worker, and Miss Grace South
wick, who is in charge of the Y. W.
C. A. war work in all the American
training camps of the Pacific coast,
are the attractions offered.
Mr. Rowell, who spoke here last
year, and made himself popular with
Stanford students, is one of the big
public men of California. As a jour
nalist and speaker of wide experi
ence, he should be a big attraction.
He will speak on the appeal of the re
lief work and the need of more ac
tivity among the boys at the front.
Just returned from a year's active
work in the allied prison camps of
Germany and Ausria, and on the west
ern front. J. E. Sprunger, state secre
tary of the Y. M. C. A. and general
campaign manager for California, will
be prepared to give Stanford first hand
information on the value and need of
the "Y" work in Europe. Mr. Sprung
er's experiences at the scene of battles
has been thrilling in the extreme. He
was the founder of the first Y. M. C.
A. building ever opened in the Aus
trian prison camps.
Miss Southwick will explain the part
that women can play in helping the
boys in the service. As director of
the Y. W. C. A. work in all the train
ing camps of the Pacific coast, she has
been active in forwarding this relief.
At Camps Lewis and Kearney she has
has erected hostess houses, which are
the only places in the camps that the
men can meet women. Mothers and
sisters of the boys in the service are
greatly aided in visiting them by this
agency. Miss Southwick will also de
scribe the women's work in Europe.
There the looking after the comforts
of the men is of prime importance, and
here is where the Young Women's
Christian Association can putin its
greatest service. Many women of note
are volunteering for this work. Mrs.
Vincent Astor is serving in one of the
"Y" buildings, and Mrs. Theodore
Roosevelt, Jr., is engaged as a night
clerk in a "Y" hotel.
Following the assembly, the com
bined committees of the Y. M. C. A.
and Y. W. C. A. will hold a luncheon
in the Union, Thursday noon. This
event will launch the campaign on the
Stanford campus. Mr. Sprunger will
address the committees. Stanford has
set as its minimum in this campaign,
the sum of $(1000. The committee hope
to easily raise the sum in two days,
Thursday and Friday, during which
time intensive work is planned.
Other schools and colleges are also
doing active work in connection with
the big national war relief campaign.
The University of Southern California
has set as its goal $10,000, and Uni
versity of California will endeavor to
raise $25,000. The San Jose State
Normal has already contributed $2,G00,
while the College of the Pacific, with
only 300 students, has raised $2,000.
