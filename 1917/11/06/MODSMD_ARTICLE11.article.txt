## 
### 
With Jack Kegley presiding at the
piano, the upperclass jolly-up Satur
day night in the Women's Club House
promises to be a real success. A
large crowd is anticipated in spite of
several house dances.
A real honest-to-goodness bar will
be erected in the Club House, and a
specially imported bartender will dis
pense the drinks, which will consist
of cider. Tag dances will predominate
as usual, with a few straight numbers
mixed in. True to jolly-up custom,
soft shirts will be the rule. The tra
ditional four-bit piece will be charged
for admission.
Pinal plans for the upperclass party
are being arranged by the joint Junior-
Senior committee, under the leader
ship of C. S. Kegley, 'IS, and A. C.
Robbins, '19.
