# USE THE BULLETIN BOARDS
## 
### 
A. recent University regulation rules against the announcing of campus
functions by writing on the walks and buildings of the University. Despite
this regulation many notices of that character have appeared announcing
recent affairs in such prominent places as the Engineering corner and the
Law steps.
Bulletin boards are provided by the University at given places on the
Quad, at the postoffice and other places. The chief advantage ot this medium
of advertising is that these boards are placed in conspicuous and conven
ient places and everyone knows where to find announcements if they are
limited to the bulletin boards exclusively.
From the comments made on the sidewalk ads they seem to be largel>
objects of ridicule. They certainly are no objects of beauty. One of the
most distracting features of them is that they not only advertise the event
for two or three days before it comes off but continue the advertisement
after it is over, until some other energetic organization comes along and
rubs it out in order to bring publicity to their own particular endeavor.
The bulletin boards are put up for the use of students and organiza
tions. They are expected to be used for that purpose and unless they are
used regularly their value is destroyed. The Daily Palo Alto is always
glad to give space to any organization, fostering student activities. We
have sufficient means of getting various functions before the student body
without defacing the walks and buildings. Let's use them.
