# Stevens Tells of Camp Lewis Life
## 
### 
Blaine Stevens, '18, captain-elect of
the Stanford baseball team, writes en
thusiastically from Camp Lewis,
American Lake, of camp and army life.
Apparently he is divided in his love
of the national pastime and the routine
army life, because in one sentence of
a letter received by Palo Alto friends
he speaks highly of martial drill, and
in the next phrase enthusiastically de
scribes the ball team that his partic
ular company possesses. It is the
pride of the regiment, according to
Stevens. Congenialty is one of the
keynotes of life at the camp, which is
made possible by the great number
of college men there.
