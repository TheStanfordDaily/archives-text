# BRIGHT QUESTIONS AND RAINY WEATHER

(EDITORIAL)
Despite the fact that the University has been in session nearly six
weeks and the date and place of the Big Game have been discusfced and
written up, there are still some students who inquire with a very intelli
gent look in their eyes, when and where the Big Game will be played. To
say the least such a bright question is somewhat discouraging. When the
date of the Big Game was first decided upon The Daily Palo Alto ran a
story to the effect that it would be played on November 24. Last week,
when the proper authorities decided to play the game at Stanford, that an
nouncement was made in a black-faced box. In addition to that the ques
tion has been discussed by dozens of small groups all over the campus.
And then to have someone kick through with a question like that.
Rainy weather seems to have put a kink in the football candidates.
Last night there were less than two squads out. There was a particularly
small turn out of the Freshmen, many of them men who had played in the
Santa Clara game last Saturday. Just because they got into that game is
no authority for them to fuit coming out for football. Their schedule is
not completed yet and they are expected to report until excused from fur
ther practice by the coach. If rainy weather was responsible for the fail
ure to turn out yesterday we are in a sorry state, for we will very likely
have a lot of weather like that from now on until the season is over. We
may as well get used to it now before it is too late.
