# FACULTY AXES SHARPENED FOR STUDENT HEADS
## 
### 
Grinding and sharpening of the fac
ulty axes, to catch the unwary stu
dents, can be heard as the middle of
the quarter approaches. Smoke-ups,
those advance signs and concrete bits
of evidence of faculty displeasure, will
be out some time towards the end of
next week, according to announce
ment made at the Registrar's office.
Results Already Seen.
Already students are walking about
the campus with faces on which dread
is the distinguishing feature, and al
ready the early season sports are con
templating transformation into ardent
grinds. After next week's reminders
appear in the postoffice boxes the
Library will replace Stick.v's as the
popular hang-out of the familiar cam
pus figures, study tables will supplant
the green of card and pool tables, and
the campus will be otherwise trans
formed.
