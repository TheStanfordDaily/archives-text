# Signal Corps Branch of Service Reopens
## Non – Flying Aviation Section Sends Out New Call for Recruits 
### 
With receipt at the Registrar's of
fice of a communication from the War
Department to the effect that the Non
flying Aviation Section of the Signal
Corps, closed to recruiting three weeks
ago, has been rc-opened, another op
portunity for Stanford men to enter
the service in a specialized branch has
been offered. The call this time is
primarily for men between the ages of
31 and 45, in other words, those be
yond the confines of the draft. How
ever, particularly strong qualifications
will admit men under 31 years, and it
is in this respect that Stanford men
will have an opportunity of entering
this branch of the service. The for
mer call, which included men from the
ages of 25 to 31, and specially qual
ified ones under the minimum age,
found four Stanfordites accepted. In
this list was Geroid Robinson, '17, who
was registered in the University this
quarter pending call, and who was
summoned into the service about a
week ago.
All who are interested in the ad
vantages which this branch of the
best of the Cohan productions, is a
screaming farce in three acts. It was
the hit of the season in New York two
years ago, and since that time has
toured the country under the original
eastern company. It is easy to pro
duce, without difficult changes of
scenery, and has a cast of only eight
male and four female characters.
However, several of these parts give
ample opportunity for acting of the
highest comedy type. The plot is mod
ern in every sense of the word. It is
a play of the business world, dealing
with the exaggerated importance
placed today on elaborate and indis
criminate advertisement. The usual
pleasant romance, characteristic of
Cohan comedies, runs throughout the
play, and terminates in the essential
happy ending.
A large turn out of Sophomores is
expected at the tryouts Wednesday
evening. To determine the ability of
the aspirants for parts, all the try
outees will be asked to read the follow
ing selection from Oliver Wendell
Holmes:
"All the World's a stage," as Shake
speare said one day—
"The stage a world was what he
meant to say.
Here suffering virtue ever finds relief,
And black-browed ruffians always come
to grief,
When the lorn damsel with a frantic
speech
And cheeks as hueless as a brandied
peach,
Cries, "Help! ky-ind Heaven," and
drops upon her knees,
On the green-baize beneath the (can
vas) trees,
See to her side avenging Valor fly,
"Ha! Villain! Draw! Now Ter
raytor, yield or die!"
When the poor hero flounders in de
spair,
Some dear-lost uncle turns up million
aire,
Clasps the young scape-grace with
paternal joy,
Sobs on his neck, "My boy! My boy—
MY BOY!"

See to her side avenging Valor fly,
"Ha! Villain! Draw! Now Ter
raytor, yield or die!"

spair,
Some dear-lost uncle turns up million

Clasps the young scape-grace with

With receipt at the Registrar's of
fice of a communication from the War
Department to the effect that the Non
flying Aviation Section of the Signal
Corps, closed to recruiting three weeks
ago, has been rc-opened, another op
portunity for Stanford men to enter
the service in a specialized branch has
been offered. The call this time is
primarily for men between the ages of
31 and 45, in other words, those be
yond the confines of the draft. How
ever, particularly strong qualifications
will admit men under 31 years, and it
is in this respect that Stanford men
will have an opportunity of entering
this branch of the service. The for
mer call, which included men from the
ages of 25 to 31, and specially qual
ified ones under the minimum age,
found four Stanfordites accepted. In
this list was Geroid Robinson, '17, who
was registered in the University this
quarter pending call, and who was
summoned into the service about a
week ago.
All who are interested in the ad
vantages which this branch of the
best of the Cohan productions, is a
screaming farce in three acts. It was
the hit of the season in New York two
years ago, and since that time has
toured the country under the original
eastern company. It is easy to pro
duce, without difficult changes of
scenery, and has a cast of only eight
male and four female characters.
However, several of these parts give
ample opportunity for acting of the
highest comedy type. The plot is mod
ern in every sense of the word. It is
a play of the business world, dealing
with the exaggerated importance
placed today on elaborate and indis
criminate advertisement. The usual
pleasant romance, characteristic of
Cohan comedies, runs throughout the
play, and terminates in the essential
happy ending.
A large turn out of Sophomores is
expected at the tryouts Wednesday
evening. To determine the ability of
the aspirants for parts, all the try
outees will be asked to read the follow
ing selection from Oliver Wendell
Holmes:
"All the World's a stage," as Shake
speare said one day—
"The stage a world was what he
meant to say.
Here suffering virtue ever finds relief,
And black-browed ruffians always come
to grief,
When the lorn damsel with a frantic
speech
And cheeks as hueless as a brandied
peach,
Cries, "Help! ky-ind Heaven," and
drops upon her knees,
On the green-baize beneath the (can
vas) trees,
See to her side avenging Valor fly,
"Ha! Villain! Draw! Now Ter
raytor, yield or die!"
