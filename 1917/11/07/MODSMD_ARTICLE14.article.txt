# JOIN Y.M.C.A. DRIVE
## 
### 
Tomorrow's assembly will officially open the Y. M. C. A. campaign tor
six thousand dollars to be used in connection with the contributions trom
all the other colleges and universities of the country in the prison camp
work in Europe. Excellent speakers have been secured for the assembly
and with their presentation of the question little difficulty should lie en
countered in raising the sum allotted to Stanford.
OMicers in the United States Army are enthusiastic over the work being
done all over the country in the training camps and word from General
pershing expresses his hearty approval of the work being done by the
American Y. M. C. A. in the European battle fields, especially in the prison
camps. That this approval is not limited to the United States alone is
shown by the fact that the French. Italian, and Russian governments have
all sent an urgent request to the American headquarters of the Y. M. C. A.
that they conduct the same work among their soldiers and prisoners.
The Y. M. C. A. is a thoroughly organized and efficient organization,
probably better able to carry this great humanitarian service than any other
organization engaged in war work outside the governments themselves.
They are asking t'nr thirty-five million dollars from the people of the United
States to make a continuation and expansion possible. Of that amount six
thousand is apportioned to the Stanford community. Compared to the value
of the service for which the money will be spent our share is a comparative
ly small one. It is our duty to get behind this proposition and raise the full
allotment, so that when the final reports go in, we can say "Stanford did
iin un."
