Weeks were yesterday elected mem

leading with a good margin.
With a membership this year in
cluding the entire student body, tin
Union is expected to prove more than
ever a meeting place for Stanford
men. Informal'smokers are to lie held
from time to time, and Union (lances
will be additional attractions through
the year. The policy will he to bring

quaintance, faculty, students, and
alumni, and the Union will strive in
every way possible to carry out this
idea.
