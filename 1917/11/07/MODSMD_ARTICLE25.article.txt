interest to college students.
"The War and Humanity," by James

with new material on the war intro
duced in a vivid way.
A set of bound volumes of the Mag
azine of Poetry, including issues from
April, 1916, to October, 1917, will be
of especial interest to English stu

of the best verse published by well
known poets during the past year.
William Ordway Partridge, noted
sculptor, has recently written a bio
graphical sketch of Nathan Hale, clone
after five years of study, and which

dents is a book of Prize Orations, a"
collection of speeches by college men
delivered during the last few years.
The collection is by A. Weston, and
comprises the best college orations of
American schools.
