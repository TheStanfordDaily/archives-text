Grace Southwick, and with Chester H. |
Rowell, editor of the "Fresno Repub- j
lican," and J. E. Sprunger, noted
prison camp worker, also on the bill,
tomorrow's assembly should be a
stellar attraction for Stanford stu
dents. These three big speakers come j
to Stanford tomorrow to emphasize j
the significance and importance of tho
Y. M. C. A. and Y. W. C. A. war relief
work for which the national $35,000,-
000 campaign is to be waged in the
next few days.
Colonel Smiley, who is in command [
at Camp Fremont, will address Stan- '
ford students on the value and need of J
the "Y" work from the standpoint ofj
the army. Having served many years
in the army, both in this country and !
the Philippines, he is well able to talk
upon this subject. In coming to Stan
ford tomorrow, he represents Major-
General Murray, commander of the l
Western Division.
Chester H. Rowell, one of the most J
noted and popular lecturers in the
state, will speak on the appeal of the â– 
relief work. As editor of the "Fresno
Republican," and as a journalist and j
public man of wide experience and j
prominence, he should prove a big;
drawing card.
First hand information regarding
(he work in the prison camps of
Europe will be given by J. E. Sprung- j
er, campaign manager i'or the state of
California, and state Y. M. C. A. sec- j
retarv. He has just returned from a !
year's work in tho allied prison camps
of Germany and Austria, and on the !

j western front, and his experiences
I have been thrilling in the extreme. He
| dedicated the first Y. M. C. A. build
ling ever opened in the Austrian
camps.
Miss Grace Southwick, who is in
charge of the women's work in the
Pacific coast training camps, was also
scheduled to speak on tomorrow's
(program, but because of the pressure
!of work she has sent word that she
will be unable to come.
All departments of the government
are behind the campaign. The Y. .\l.
C. A. has been designated as the of
ficial agency for the purpose of build
ing up the soldiers in body, mind, and
spirit. Its work has been so striking
in its effect, that Russia, France, and
Italy have asked for the same type
of service for their armies. Other evi
dence of the success and importance
of this work comes in thousands of
letters from soldiers in training camps,
naval stations and the front line
trenches.
Stanford's share in the great na
tional war relief campaign will be the
raising of $6,000. The campaign is
being waged throughout the country
from November 2 to 20, by the com
bined Y. M. C. A.'s and Y. W. C. A.'s
for the purpose of raisins the $35,-
jooo,ooo to be used for the maintenance
and extension of the war work.
Other schools and colleges are also
contributing to the appeal. The Uni
| versity of California will endeavor to
! raise $2.",000; the University of
Southern California, $10,000; the San
| Jose State Normal has already given
I $2,500, and the College of the Pacific,
