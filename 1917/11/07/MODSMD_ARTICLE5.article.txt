# Luther's Work Is Subject of Talk

### 
That to Luther we owe the most
cherished attainment of our modern
civilization, "The right of every man
to think for himself," was the mes
sage of Dr. David Henry Bauslin, Dean
of the Wittenberg School of Divinity,
in his lecture, "Martin Luther, the
Man, and his Work," delivered at the
Little Theater last night.
It was exactly 400 years ago that
Luther nailed his 95 theses on the
church door at Wittenberg, and thus
began the Reformation, a movement
the effects of which can only be com
pared with the Barbarian invasions,
the Crusades, and the French Revolu
tion. Previous to this Luther, ob
scurely born but well educated, had
been a professor in a newly-estab
lished college.
The Reformation, according to Dr.
Bauslin, started as purely a religious
movement with Luther as the prin
cipal leader. Owing to the liberal

views and the doctrines of the free
dom of the individual conscience pro
mulgated by its chief, it soon became
political in its scope as well. It was
Luther who tirst declared that govern
ments exist only for the benefit, of the
governed. "The real genesis of the
free institutions of which America is
so justly proud is to be found in the
doctrines of Luther and his fellow
reformers," said Dr. Bauslin. "In
some of his political theories he an
ticipated Abraham Lincoln."
The character of Luther, stated the
speaker, was singularly paradoxical.
He was introspective yet belligerent,
humble yet fearless, sympathetic in his
attitude toward the common people,
yet never in danger of becoming a
demagogue. He was loved and hated
as was no other man of his time, and
exerted an influence upon world
events greater than that of almost any
other historical character.
