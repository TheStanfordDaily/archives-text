# NEW ART FEATURES IN 1919 QUAD
## 
### 
Among other innovations, the 1919
Quad will contain an entirely new fea
ture in the art. work. Pedro Lemos,
ithe curator of the Museum, is prepar
ing hand-etched color prints of views
of the campus, and eight of these will
appear in the Quad. The paintings
arc not photographic reproductions, as
the prints in former Quads have been,
and are valued at between four and
five dollars each. Mr. Lemos is well
known for his art work at the Univer
sity of California.

Fraternity and sorority pictures for
the Quad are due now, and sittings
can be arranged at "Pop" Franklin's
studio. Positively all pictures must
be in before the end of the quarter,
and in order to save confusion in the
last few weeks it is urged that the
fraternities and sororities have the
work done as soon as possible. All
Juniors must have their pictures fin
ished by December 13th, and they can
be taken at any time on the presenta
tion of certificates.
