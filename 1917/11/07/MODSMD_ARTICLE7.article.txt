# Try-Outs for '20 Class Play to Be Held This Evening
## 
### 
Tryouts for the Sophomore Play will
be held in the Assembly flail tonight
at 7:30 and tomorrow afternoon at
1:30. Naming two days for the try
out period will undoubtedly asure a
better turn out of Sophomores, as
many find it difficult to abandon pre
vious work on one day's notice.
Frank L. Mathieu, who is directing the
Sword and Sandals presentation, will
take charge of the Sophomore Play
and will start in with the rehearsals
immediately after he has selected the
cast. His task is a difficult one, that
of molding inexperienced actors into
their parts in the short space of one
month.
The date of the presentation of the j
play is December S, so Mathieu will
have his hands full in the intervening t
time. However, he will probably be I
aided in the work by L. L. Pickering. |
'20, who is cast in one of the leading j
roles of "The Cinderella Man," and j
who has announced his intention of
trying out for one of the parts in the j
Sophomore production. Eight male |
characters must be filled, however,
and four female parts, so there is am
ple opportunity for 1920 Thespians to !
display their ability. The lines which !
tlie tryoutees must read in demon- j
strating their worth before the coach !
are taken from a poem by Oliver j
Wendell Holmes, and were printed in
last evening's Daily Palo Alto.
