The Cross-Country Run
will be Saturday in Berkeley.
Everybody will be there with both
feet —both the runners and the on
lookers. The runners will have
their feet in good condition, and
the witnesses should have theirs in
good shoes. The place to get them
is
"HOW ABOUT YOUR SHOES?"

"When You Jolly-Up
you get all warmed up," said Co-
Edna. "It is only a step across to
Wilson's, where you can get
Icy Drinks and Sundaes
to cool you off and help you enjoy
the jolly-up."
