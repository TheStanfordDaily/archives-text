# Varsity Soccerites Plan Tour to Japan
## Cardinals to Line Up Against Winged "0" Team Saturday at San Francisco 
### 
That Varsity soccer men may make
a tour of Japan during the coming'
summer, was announced today by
Coach Harry Maloney. Mr. I. Kami,
director of physical education in
Tokio, who visited the campus last
week, is very enthusiastic over the
project .and stated his intentions of
taking the matter up with the au
thorities in Japan immediately upon
his return. As soccer is the only
form of football played in Japan, there
would be plenty of keen competition
for the Varsity players. Mr. Kami is
at present making a tour of this coun
try inspecting American methods of
physical education, and he was very
much impressed with Stanford's gym
nasia and athletic facilities.
Stanford Varsity soccerites journey
to San Francisco on Saturday next to
take on the Olympic Club aggregation
for a return game. The Cardinal rep
resentatives were snowed under by
the score of 2 to 1 in last Saturday's
contest, but hopes are high for the
staging of a real come-back in the
coming game.
