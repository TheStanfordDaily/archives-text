Mr. James E. Sprunger and Mr. Chester H. Rowell putin the final out
side licks this morning in the Y. M. C. A. War Work campaign at the
student assembly. From now on the situation is up to the student body.
The general student committee which met at the Union showed a spirit in
their contributions which should be adopted by the entire student body in
making their pledges. The raising of $1800 by the committee is far above
the hopes of those in charge.
Mr. Sprunger, speaking from the standpoint of one who has seen ac
tive service in the Y. M. C. A. work in Europe, presented his subject in a
way that only one who has seen actual service could present it. He pic
tured conditions in the prison camps which were before unknown and em
phasized the improvement in these conditions since the Y. M. C. A. workers
entered the field.
The situation as viewed by an American at home was ably handled
by Mr. Chester H. Rowell, prominent publisher and politician of Fresno,
who emphasized the duty of Americans to give as much as possible for such
humanitarian services as the Y. M. C. A. is performing.
The $6,000 allotted to Stanford should be oversubscribed. Other col
leges and universities have oversubscribed the sum allotted to them. Stan
ford has always rallied to such calls in a fine spirit. She cannot fall down
on this one.

The only incident which marred the spirit of this morning's assembly
was the way in which students hurried out of the Assembly Hall before
the singing of "Hail, Stanford, Hail." The yell leader was all ready to
btart the song as soon as Acting-President Marx dismissed the assembly,
and there was no excuse for breaking away before the singing. If there is
anyone in the student body who doesn't know that the Stanford hymn is
sung at the close of every assembly we take this opportunity of advising
them of the fact.
