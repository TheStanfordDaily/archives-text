# Victory by Annihilation Not War Aim Says West

### 
"International peace—our real aim
in this war—can be accomplished with
out walking into Pottsdam and cut
ting off the Kaiser's head," Professor
Victor .1. West declared in a talk be
fore Wranglers last night. We must
defeat the purposes of the German
government, but this does not imply
that the German people should be an
nihilated, as many men of conse
quence would seem to have advo
cated. We are liable to forget the
true aim of this war in our desire to
crush Germany.
