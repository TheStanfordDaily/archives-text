# WOMEN TO LEARN ENGINE REPAIRING FOR WAR SERVICE
## 
### 
Forty women reported for the class
in auto-mechanics at the first meeting
held last night. Actual work will be
gin immediately, with one lecture a
week, on Wednesday from 7 to 8 p.m.,
and two hours laboratory. Hours for
the laboratory work are: Monday, 2
to 4 p.m., 4 to C p.m.; Tuesday, 4 to G
p.m.; Thursday, 4 to 6 p.m.
"The aim of the course," according
to Fred Hamilton, gr., who has charge
of the class, "due to the short time left
this quarter, is to teach the girls to
think in mechanical terms." For this
end, laboratory and lecture work will
be entirely practical, and so enable a
girl to repair an engine, to dissemble
and reconstruct a car. The novices
will practice on a Reo belonging to
Professor Durand of the Engineering
department.
This class is organized by the Y. W.
C. A., in connection with the War
Emergency Work for which Stanford
women registered. Elinor Eppich, *1 f>,
who has charge of the auto-mechanics,
wireless and Red Cross work, is en
couraged by the interest which the
women have shown, and is now mak
ing arrangements for a class in wire
less to be started soon.
