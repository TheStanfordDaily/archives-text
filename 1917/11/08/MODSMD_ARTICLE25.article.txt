## 
### 
The prospects of an interesting talk i
by Judge G. E. Crothers, '95, now a
member of the Supreme Court at San
Francisco, and remarks by Professor
A. M. Cathcart, Dean C. A. Huston, and
Professor C. G. Vernier, promise to
bring out a large attendance to the
Law smoker, to be held in the Union
tonight at 7:45. Judge Crothers is one
of the interesting men graduated in
Stanford's first class, and is the found- \
er of the Crothers Scholarship.
A decidedly "Hooverized" dinner!
will be served, including a number of j
appetizing dishes that Mr. Hoover was j
accustomed to when a Stanford stu- j
dent, the "before-the-war" kind, j
Smokes of all kinds, from stogies to j
pills, will be there to furnish a "smoke- !
lip festival" of a much different variety !
than the Registrar's offering to the j
barristers. The Legalites will eat,
smoke and be merry tonight.
