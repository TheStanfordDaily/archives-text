## Chester Rowell and James E. Sprunger Laud Camp War Work 
### 
To the Stanford Students and
Faculty:
I wish to emphasize the great
value of the work of the Young
Men's Christian Association in the
United States Army as I have ob
served it in Cuba, tiie Philippines,
and United States. The army of
ficials desire to co-operate in every
possible way in the carrying out
of its program. I regret very much
that an unexpected official appoint
ment keeps me from bringing the
message personally to you.

Stanford caught the visiion of the
bigness and importance of the work
the Y. M. C. A. is doing in keeping
up the morale of the Allied armies at
the front, this morning in Assembly
Hall, when the biggest crowd of any
Stanford meeting this year heard the
stirring messages of the Hon. Chester
H. Rowell and James E. Sprunger.
With this vision and realizing the
tremendousness of the war work,
Stanford men and women should reach
the $6,000 mark set for the Univer

sity s quota in the campus campaign,
and "go over the top" for several
thousand more. Further proof of this
came this noon when the Y. M. C. A.-
V. \V. C. A. workers met in rlie Union
for luncheon and raised $ISimi just "to
start the ball rolling."

Sprunger, coming almost directly
from the prison camps in England and
Germany, »ive a vividly human de
scription of the terrible conditions in
these camps and deeply moved his
hearers to a realization of the great
need that exists in them for just the
kind of work being done by the Y.
M. C. A. in them.
"The one great need in the prison
camps over there is to break the mon

occupied to keep them from going in
sane, for many of them are going in
sane,'' was one of Sprunger's early
sentences.
He said in part:
"Men in the prison camps are keep
ing up good cheer as best then can,
and it is our responsibility to help
them in this great task. The biggest
battle that is being fought in this war
is not the Battle of Flanders nor the
| Wattle of the Marne, but the 'Battle of
Paris.' Our men are heroes over there
and they will be heroes when they re
turn, but we want them to be clean
J heroes, and the part of the Y. M. C.
A. is to make this possible,
i"It behooves us here at home to do
I ( more than one bit or two, but it be -
hooves us to sacrifice."
: Howell's Words Terse.
In terse sentences and with great
intensity of feeling, Chester H. Howell
showed the crucial importance 01'
keeping up the morale of all the Al
lies, and brought home to his hearers
their responsibility in backing up the
Y. M. C. A. movement in aconiplish
ing this.
"We must see with our mind's eye
what a world we are living in now,"
he said.
"More men are under arms and in
trenches and camps today than there
are grown men in this country.
"This war will change the whole life
of every person now in the world and
for as many generations ahead as we
can see.
"Peace is here and the luxuries of
peace are here, but they are nowhere
else. Wars are won by soldiers, by
supplies, and by morale, and it is to
keep up this morale that the United
"States is going to raise thirty-five mil
lion dollars to pay for nine months'
service of the Y. M. C. A. 'over
j there.' "
Morale,. Rowell explained, consisted
of two things, negative morality and
j positive morality.
Morale Means Victory.
"Negative morality is harder and
I more necessary in the army than any
j where else. But morale means a great
j deal more than merely negative mor
ality, than merely not doing the
j things that destroy the soul and un
: fit the body. It is necessary to pro
jvide the hoys with something to do,
[something real, something living.
"Victory in war depends on which
i side keeps up its morale best and
jlonge&t. Pershing pleads, 'For God's
j sake, buck ii|> the French!' The time
| will come when insidious propagand
ists will try to get the United States
] to drop out of war with the old cry,
'Why should we fight?' The winning
of the war will then depend on the
morale of this country resisting such
influences.
"The better the morale we have be
hind the lines and rlear back to here,
the stronger our forces will be.
"There is something for each of us j
to do: to exercise patience, charity,
economy, and to give—to 'give till it \
hurts.' Every bit done now saves later I
for sooner or later we'll have to pay. j
Make War End Next oYar.
"The only way we can make this
war end next year and keep it from I
dragging on until we are too exhaust-1
ed and have lost our morale is to be
gin right now, 100 per cent hard, in j
time, emotion and money, to do all the j
things that ought to be done and cos- j
tinue to do. Or else we'll have to do [
it twice as long and twice as hard.

"Stanford University has done j
much; Stanford has done tremend-1
ously more than her share in the liel-!
gian Relief; Stanford has furnished !
the brains of this relief. America is |
a whole furnished an insignificant
and contemptible share, but this com- !
munity did its full share and more.
And Stanford will do her full share
and more in this supremely important
work."
Acting President C. D. Marx pre- j
sided and read a letter from Colonel
S. C. Smiley of Camp Fremont, re- !
gretting that he could not be present
and strongly endorsing the Y. M. C. A.
as the soldiers' best friend at the 1
i front and in the camps.
