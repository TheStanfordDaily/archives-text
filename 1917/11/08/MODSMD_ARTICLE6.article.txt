# Unusual Servants in Sword and Sandals Show
## 
### 
Did you ever see a
temperamental m a n
when he has lost his
head in anger? Tony
Quintard loses his head
when the Great-She-
Bear attacks his Fairy
Princess and insults
her with scathing
words.
You will agree that
Tony is right in calling
the landlady of his
boarding house"The-
Great-She-Bear" when
you see "The Cinder
ella Man" on Novem
ber 16.
Stage Director F. W.
Weeks has his crew
hard at work on the
scenery and properties
for the Sword and San
dals production, and
promises striking sot
tings for the four acts
of the play. Settings
used in the Alcazar pro
duction will be brought
to the campus for the
local show. A new

trap door is to he installed in the
Assembly Hall stage in order to pro
vide for the entrance in the second
and third acts. A special scene
painter il 1 he secured from the Al

cazar Theater in San Francisco to
paint the interiors necessary for"The
Cinderella Man."
The property plot is now complete
and properties are being assembled,
and include everything from a sau

sage tied with a red ribbon, to a
grand piano. A full course meal will
be served on the stage during the
play, and the author has made the sit
uations during the meal deliriously
funny.
