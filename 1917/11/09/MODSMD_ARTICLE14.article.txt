# Alumni Committees Will Inspect Campus
## 
### 
Members of the Alumni Advisory
Board and the Executive Committee of
the Alumni Association will visit the
campus next Thursday, on sort of a
general tour of inspection. About fif
teen will be in the party, and they will
visit the buildings and classes, at
tempting to get in touch with the stu
dents and their activities.
Under the constitution of the Alum
ni Association, at least one meeting a
year of that body must lie held on the
campus, and so it is planned to kill
two birds with one stone this time, by
visiting the University in session and
holding the meeting the same day.
This has been done only once before.
'Although nothing definite has been
decided yet, as to the way in which
the alumni members are to be greeted
and entertained, it is hoped that the
various student officers will seize this
opportunity of getting in touch with
their predecessors, and draw up a
program that will make the visit an
annal affair. The alumni hope to
meet the faculty and students on the
campus and hope to meet them with
out the formality of too much prear
ranged red tape. Informal visits of
this type will do much to bridge the
gap between alumni and students.
