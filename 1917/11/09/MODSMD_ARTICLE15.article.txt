### 
Stanford lias responded to the call
for service once again. In the open
ing day of the Y. M. C. A.-Y. W. C. A.
War Work drive $7771 has been
pledged, or $1771 over the minimum of
$(5000 set as Stanford's share in the
nation's total.
Particular credit must be given the
Stanford women for of this total the
women's share is $5557, with only 325
of the women heard from, or an aver
age of $17.40 per woman. With a re
turn such as this, the women will un
doubtedly "go over the top" with bet
ter than Stanford's minimum require
ment.
Up to noon today only 220 men had
been heard from and the returns from
these totaled $1614. Faculty returns
total $490, but only a few have been
heard from.
With four-fifths of the men yet to
be heard from, and also most of the
faculty, in addition to the 175 women,
prospects appear that Stanford will
more than double tin $COOO, and cam
paign workers have now set $15,000
as their goal.
Speakers were sent, last night to
each sorority house and to half of the
fraternities explaining the need of
the Y. M.-Y. W. C. A. for this War
Work funds. The rest of the fratern
ities and living groups were covered
at noon today by speakers. Practic
ally complete returns should be had
late tonight on Stanford's total,
though it may he several days before
all the faculty and commuters are
heard from.
Women issued a poster early this
morning urging the men to "come on
over the top" and bring Stanford's
total up to $15,000.
