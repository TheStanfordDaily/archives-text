# Fund of $27 Raised for Cross Country Team Fares
## 
### 
Twenty-seven dollars was raised by
Major Jens Bugge among military
men for the purpose of helping to pay
the fare of the cross-country team,
which goes to Berkeley Saturday, at
the drill yesterday. Major Tlugge
started the fund with a $1.00 contribu
tion, and small contributions were
raised from the rest. This will be
sufficient to cover the team's expenses.
