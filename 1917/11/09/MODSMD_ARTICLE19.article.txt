# CONGRATULATIONS TO THE WOMEN
## 
### 
We certainly have to hand it to Stanford women for the showing they
are making in the Y. W. C. A.-Y. M. C. A. drive. Three hundred and twenty
four of them alone subscribed with $311 of the amount allotted to the Stan
ford community. fill * * 5 > :
When their poster appeared on the campus this morning everybody
was dumbfounded. They had raised an almost inconceivable fund. After
they had done it they appreciated that it wasn't so hard after all, and so
they got back of, the thing to make the rest of the student body realize that
$6000 was not sufficient for the people in the Stanford community to raise.
We are glad they put out their posters. They did not merely say that
the women had come through and wanted everyone to know it. What they
really did was to challenge the rest of us to equal them, not from any
selfish motives, but because they believed it was Stanford's duty to make
the contribution from here more than the allotted sum.
That slogan, "give till it hurts," has been flung at us for some time, but
until this morning we never realized what it would really mean for Stan
ford students to try it. It is evident that in many cases women have
given until it hurts. Such a contribution as they have made will mean
cutting out a lot of new clothes, parties planned, and other things form
erly accepted in the ordinary run of college life. The sacrifice has been
made willingly and so again we want to congratulate the women for the
splendid contribution they have made. We hope that when the final reports
come in the men they will be as gratifying.
