# RULES DEFEAT CONCERTS
## 
### 
Announcement has been made on the campus of the concert to be given
next Tuesday night in San Jose. Special rates are to be given Stanford stu
dents. All of which is very line, but why do they rub it in?
Not many of the men around, the University care to attend such a con
cert alone but that is what it means. If the women want to go alone or
queen they must have a chaperone in order to stay out after 30:30. We ap
preciate the opportunity to hear such a concert but when it is nearly im
possible we would just a little rather not have it brought up at all.
We took occasion some time ago to comment 011 the women's rules and
we believe this is another case where they work to the injustice of the
students. As we said then, the rules were doubtless drawn up because in
a measure they were needed, but we believe they were drawn too rigidly.
The opportunity to hear such a singer as Alma Gluck is as much part of
a college education as the knowledge gained from books. If we are to have
rules which deprive the students from this opportunity, no other circum
stances hindering, then we believe those rules are not to the best interests
of the University.
