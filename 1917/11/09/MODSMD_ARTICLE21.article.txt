# Shortage of Supplies May Hamper Military Courses
## 
### 
Major .lens Bugge is having consid
erable difficulty in getting the neces
sary equipment for the local corps and
at present is confronted with the prob
lem or supplying ammunition to the
seven companies in training here. A
snflicient number of Craig model guns
has been allotted to the Stanford unit
but the government refuses to supply
ammunition and unless a purchasing
fund can be raised by the student body
or by the alumni all plans for target
practice on the range will have to bo
suspended for the present year.
