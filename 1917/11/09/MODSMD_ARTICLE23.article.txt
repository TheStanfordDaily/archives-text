in service there, according to a letter
received from Arthur L. Erb, '15, now
Lieutenant Erb of the U. S. N. A., by

to organize a Rugby team, two in fact,
from officers and enlisted men. There
are many stars here and we can put
up a good game as a curtain raiser
for the finals in the American sched
ule that is going on now. It would
be a great boost for Rugby to play a
real game before a good crowd up
here."
Erb is running a soccer schedule
at the camp now and states that the
main trouble is a shortage of athletic
equipment. liis regiment is a North
ern California one. He says "Ours is
a Northern California regiment and
includes many Stanford men, such as
•"Mush" Stevens, Sid Adams, Schnell,
Morris, Scotty (last year's break
away), Wheeler, and a few others.
Steven's is in my company, Headquar
ters company, 363 d infantry, and is our
company clerk. Tom Hickey is a cor
poral in the company and is working
I hard. Ed Kester, Smiley Harris, and I
are the Stanford men among the of
ficers of this regiment. Tom Driscoll,
of polo fame, is my captain."
Rapid progress in training is being
made, according to Erb.
