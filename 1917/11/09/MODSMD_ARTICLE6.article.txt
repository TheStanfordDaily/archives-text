### 
Tennis followers will witness the
first tournament of the season tomor
row at 10 o'clock, on the Encina
courts, when the Stanford Varsity and
Freshman aggregations cross racquets
with the Lowell High School men of
San Francisco.
Captain Catlin Wolford, '18, and W.
V. Burrill, Jr., '20, will wield the rac
quets for the Varsity, while A. C. Dev
lin and Lounsbury Fish will perform
for the babes, in the doubles matches.
In addition there will be four singles
contests.
The Cardinal is well represented all
around, and should have no difficulty
defeating the city players.
