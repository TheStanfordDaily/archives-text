# Varsity Soccerites to Oppose Olympics
## Date for California Game to be Advanced a Week Earlier Than Scheduled 
### 
Varsity soccer team will meet the |
last Olympic Club aggregation in their !
second game of the season tomorrow j
at Ewing Field. San Francisco. The
Cardinal was downed last Saturday by
the same team in a 2 to 1 scramble, j
but Captain Roney is confident that a 1
proper come-back will be staged in
tomorrow's contest and that the local
soccerites will triumph.
With but three veterans, Roney,
Yewell, and Drury, back on the job,
the soccer squad has been making an
exceptionally good appearance this
season. Pillsbury, Wedell, Wing,
Brill, Say, and several others are
showing Varsity form in the practice i
games.
Coach Maloney has written Gradu- j
ate Manager Stroud of University of |
California, in regard to the dates of
the soccer contests with the Berkeley
representatives, and now awaits an
answer. Stanford officials wish to
have the date of the first game changed
from Thanksgiving to the morning of I
training table in action with the Var
sity. Coach Wylie has picked two
fast men and one good scrum man and
will in all probability use others be
fore the end of the game.
The Olympics will have Danny Car
roll, "Bud" Larkin, Swigart, Fitzpat
rick, Hawkes, and Hanley, with a pos
sibility of Malloy in the backfleld,
while the scrum looks fully as strong
with Milligan, Guerin, Classen, Slater,
Flanagan, Postelwaite, Turkington,
Curt in, and Meyers.
The Varsity has been shifted com
pletely around with the addition of
Freshmen to the team. Winham will
hold his old position at wing-forward,
and the two front rankers, Curtice
and Barneson, are the same. Pettin
gill will be at lock for the first time,
however, with Schwarzenbek and
Flood at side rank. Swarts has been
moved to rear rank and will have as
his partner a Freshman, Clark.
Hauser will play half, Lilly has been
sent back to first five, Chandler will
be at second five, and since Heron is
out with injuries, .Morse will be at
center three. Falk, another Fresh
man, will be at wing, while Wark will
be at the other wing. Tompleton will
of course play full. Doe, Campbell,
and Reynolds are substituting on the
team.
The Freshmen will have a real job
on their hands when they meet Fre
mont High School of Oakland. The
bay championship was won by the
Oakland team Thursday and they will
be able to put up a hard battle against
the first-year men. With the sadly
depleted team the Freshmen may lose.
The Sodality Club team is made up
of former Santa Clara and San Jose
stars and will give the All-Blacks a
hard run.
The lineups are:
Second Varsity—K. Henry, wing
forward; Meese, Cowan, (Waldo),
front rank; Righter, lock; Williamson,
Watts, side rank; Pehl, (Layman),
Stewart, (Phillips), rear rank;
Wright, half; Levy, first five; Gibbs,
(Morris), second five; Weeks, (Bran
den), center three; Davis, Needham,
wings; Thomas, full.
Freshmen — Stolz, wing-forward;
Phelps, Marx, (Gillis), front rank;
Van Cliff, lock; Patrick, Hansen,
(Filley), side rank; Wallace, Wright,
(Sparks, Tisne), rear rank; Schofield,
(Cochrane), half; Devereaux, first
five; Parker, (W. Kinney), second
five; Templeton, (Simpson), center
three; Repath, (Sentous), Dinkelspiel,
(Harris), wings; P. Kinney, full.

be able to put up a hard battle against
the first-year men. With the sadly
depleted team the Freshmen may lose.
The Sodality Club team is made up
of former Santa Clara and San Jose
stars and will give the All-Blacks a
hard run.
The lineups are:
Second Varsity—K. Henry, wing
forward; Meese, Cowan, (Waldo),
front rank; Righter, lock; Williamson,
Watts, side rank; Pehl, (Layman),
Stewart, (Phillips), rear rank;
Wright, half; Levy, first five; Gibbs,
(Morris), second five; Weeks, (Bran
den), center three; Davis, Needham,

Varsity soccer team will meet the |
last Olympic Club aggregation in their !
second game of the season tomorrow j
at Ewing Field. San Francisco. The
Cardinal was downed last Saturday by
the same team in a 2 to 1 scramble, j
but Captain Roney is confident that a 1
proper come-back will be staged in
tomorrow's contest and that the local
soccerites will triumph.
With but three veterans, Roney,
Yewell, and Drury, back on the job,
the soccer squad has been making an
exceptionally good appearance this
season. Pillsbury, Wedell, Wing,
Brill, Say, and several others are
showing Varsity form in the practice i
games.
Coach Maloney has written Gradu- j
ate Manager Stroud of University of |
California, in regard to the dates of
the soccer contests with the Berkeley
representatives, and now awaits an
answer. Stanford officials wish to
have the date of the first game changed
from Thanksgiving to the morning of I
training table in action with the Var
sity. Coach Wylie has picked two
fast men and one good scrum man and
will in all probability use others be
fore the end of the game.
The Olympics will have Danny Car
roll, "Bud" Larkin, Swigart, Fitzpat
rick, Hawkes, and Hanley, with a pos
sibility of Malloy in the backfleld,
while the scrum looks fully as strong
with Milligan, Guerin, Classen, Slater,
Flanagan, Postelwaite, Turkington,
Curt in, and Meyers.
The Varsity has been shifted com
pletely around with the addition of
Freshmen to the team. Winham will
hold his old position at wing-forward,
and the two front rankers, Curtice
and Barneson, are the same. Pettin
gill will be at lock for the first time,
however, with Schwarzenbek and
Flood at side rank. Swarts has been
moved to rear rank and will have as
his partner a Freshman, Clark.
Hauser will play half, Lilly has been
sent back to first five, Chandler will
be at second five, and since Heron is
out with injuries, .Morse will be at
center three. Falk, another Fresh
man, will be at wing, while Wark will
be at the other wing. Tompleton will
of course play full. Doe, Campbell,
and Reynolds are substituting on the
team.
The Freshmen will have a real job
on their hands when they meet Fre
mont High School of Oakland. The
bay championship was won by the
Oakland team Thursday and they will
be able to put up a hard battle against
the first-year men. With the sadly
