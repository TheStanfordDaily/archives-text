# VARSITY DEFEATS OLYMPIC CLUB 17 TO 5
## HALF-TIME COUNT 6-0 Babes Victorious Over Fremont High—All-Blacks Beat Sodality Club 
### 
Stanford defeated the Olympic Club
17 to 5 on the Cardinal turf Saturday,
in what is perhaps the crucial same
of the season with the exception of
the Big Game. Santa Clara won from
the club men a week ago by the count
of 29 to 0, and a comparison of the
two scores does not improve the hopes
of Stanford supporters.
Coach Wylie used several Freshmen
Saturday and this may account for the
score, since these men are not worked
into the team as yet. The first-year
men showed to good advantage, how
ever, and they will make a hard bid
for places on the Varsity.
Stanford drew first blood when
Hauser went over from the ruck after
several minutes play. Templeton
failed on the conversion. The only
other scoring of the first period came
on a passing rush, in which the whole
backfield and most of the forwards
took part, Falk finally going over.
Templeton again failed to convert and
the half ended with the count 6 to 0
in favor of the Cardinal.
With the opening of the second
period the Olympics took a spurt and
Fitzpatrick soon went over for the
city team's only try. con
verted, making the score 6 to 5. Af
ter this try the Olympics were out of
the running.
The Cardinal forwards pushed the
ball down the field following the kick
off, and Reynolds, substituting at
wing, went over from the ruck for the
third try. Templeton failed to con
vert. Heartened by this score the
Varsity men came back stronger and
took the ball to striking distance and
Lilly went over, Templeton again faiN
ing on the conversion. The score was
now 12 5.
The last try came as a result of a
passing rush through the whole Olym
pic team in which practically the en
tire Cardinal fifteen took place.
Campbell finally went over and Tem
pleton converted.
Stanford threatened on the kick-off
from this try but the gun went off and
the Olympics kicked to touch on their
three-yard line. The final count was
17 to 5.
Although the score of Saturday's
game is not as high as fans hoped,
there are several reasons why the
dopesters feel confident. Templeton
was not going in his usual form, and
as a result several points were lost,
and there is no danger that the full
back will not be at his best on the
24th. The. Freshmen, Coach Wylie
used, although showing good football,
were not worked into the Varsity, and
one week's play will make great dif
ference. Taken as a whole the Var
sity looks better than comparative
scores would indicate.
In the curtain raiser of the carnival,
Fremont High School fell before the
Freshmen by the count of 11 to 3. The
three tries for the first-year men came
as a result of forward play although
the backs advanced the ball in good
shape on several occasions. The
Freshmen on the Varsity seriously
handicapped the babes.

Stanford defeated the Olympic Club
17 to 5 on the Cardinal turf Saturday,
in what is perhaps the crucial same
of the season with the exception of
the Big Game. Santa Clara won from
the club men a week ago by the count
of 29 to 0, and a comparison of the
two scores does not improve the hopes
of Stanford supporters.
Coach Wylie used several Freshmen
Saturday and this may account for the
score, since these men are not worked
into the team as yet. The first-year
men showed to good advantage, how
ever, and they will make a hard bid
for places on the Varsity.
Stanford drew first blood when
Hauser went over from the ruck after
several minutes play. Templeton
failed on the conversion. The only
other scoring of the first period came
on a passing rush, in which the whole
backfield and most of the forwards
took part, Falk finally going over.
Templeton again failed to convert and
the half ended with the count 6 to 0
in favor of the Cardinal.
With the opening of the second
period the Olympics took a spurt and
Fitzpatrick soon went over for the
city team's only try. con
verted, making the score 6 to 5. Af
ter this try the Olympics were out of
the running.
The Cardinal forwards pushed the
ball down the field following the kick
off, and Reynolds, substituting at
wing, went over from the ruck for the
third try. Templeton failed to con
vert. Heartened by this score the
Varsity men came back stronger and
took the ball to striking distance and
Lilly went over, Templeton again faiN
ing on the conversion. The score was
now 12 5.
The last try came as a result of a
passing rush through the whole Olym
pic team in which practically the en
tire Cardinal fifteen took place.
Campbell finally went over and Tem
pleton converted.
Stanford threatened on the kick-off
from this try but the gun went off and
the Olympics kicked to touch on their
three-yard line. The final count was
17 to 5.
Although the score of Saturday's
game is not as high as fans hoped,
there are several reasons why the
dopesters feel confident. Templeton
was not going in his usual form, and
as a result several points were lost,
and there is no danger that the full
back will not be at his best on the
24th. The. Freshmen, Coach Wylie
used, although showing good football,
were not worked into the Varsity, and
one week's play will make great dif
ference. Taken as a whole the Var
sity looks better than comparative
scores would indicate.
In the curtain raiser of the carnival,
Fremont High School fell before the
Freshmen by the count of 11 to 3. The
three tries for the first-year men came
as a result of forward play although
the backs advanced the ball in good
shape on several occasions. The
Freshmen on the Varsity seriously
handicapped the babes.

one week's play will make great dif
ference. Taken as a whole the Var
sity looks better than comparative
scores would indicate.
In the curtain raiser of the carnival,
Fremont High School fell before the
Freshmen by the count of 11 to 3. The
three tries for the first-year men came
as a result of forward play although
the backs advanced the ball in good
shape on several occasions. The
Freshmen on the Varsity seriously
handicapped the babes.

Stanford defeated the Olympic Club
17 to 5 on the Cardinal turf Saturday,
in what is perhaps the crucial same
of the season with the exception of
the Big Game. Santa Clara won from
the club men a week ago by the count
of 29 to 0, and a comparison of the
two scores does not improve the hopes
of Stanford supporters.
Coach Wylie used several Freshmen
Saturday and this may account for the
score, since these men are not worked
into the team as yet. The first-year
men showed to good advantage, how
ever, and they will make a hard bid
for places on the Varsity.
Stanford drew first blood when
Hauser went over from the ruck after
several minutes play. Templeton
failed on the conversion. The only
other scoring of the first period came
on a passing rush, in which the whole
backfield and most of the forwards
took part, Falk finally going over.
Templeton again failed to convert and
the half ended with the count 6 to 0
in favor of the Cardinal.
With the opening of the second
period the Olympics took a spurt and
Fitzpatrick soon went over for the
city team's only try. con
verted, making the score 6 to 5. Af
ter this try the Olympics were out of
the running.
The Cardinal forwards pushed the
ball down the field following the kick
off, and Reynolds, substituting at
wing, went over from the ruck for the
third try. Templeton failed to con
vert. Heartened by this score the
Varsity men came back stronger and
took the ball to striking distance and
Lilly went over, Templeton again faiN
ing on the conversion. The score was
now 12 5.
The last try came as a result of a
passing rush through the whole Olym
pic team in which practically the en
tire Cardinal fifteen took place.
Campbell finally went over and Tem
pleton converted.
Stanford threatened on the kick-off
from this try but the gun went off and
the Olympics kicked to touch on their
three-yard line. The final count was
17 to 5.
Although the score of Saturday's
game is not as high as fans hoped,
there are several reasons why the
dopesters feel confident. Templeton
was not going in his usual form, and
as a result several points were lost,
and there is no danger that the full
back will not be at his best on the
24th. The. Freshmen, Coach Wylie
used, although showing good football,
were not worked into the Varsity, and
one week's play will make great dif
ference. Taken as a whole the Var
sity looks better than comparative
