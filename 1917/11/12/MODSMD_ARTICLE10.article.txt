# $9556 RAISED IN Y.M.-Y.W. DRIVE TO DATE
## LAST REPORTS TODAY Women Out-Donate Men Students With $6300â€”Faculty Yet to Be Heard From 
### 
Catching the spirit of the great war
service movement, Stanford truly
"gave till it hurt" in the drive which
was waged on the campus last week.
Reports to date show that the sur
prising total of $9,556 was pledged
for Y. M. C. A. and Y. W. C. A. war
relief work, which overreaches the
i minimum amount of $0,000 by $3,556.
j With the closing reports to come in to
night at S o'clock, when the captains
of the various teams gather for a final
I meeting in the Stanford Union, it is
(easily to be expected that the goal
I originally set will be doubled.
Women Lead Men.
The women of the University still
lead the men in the drive with a total
of $6,300. Stanford men have thus
tar pledged the sura of $2,596, but this
sum represents only the contributions
of 347 men and final reports are still
to come from several of the houses
and groups on the campus. Faculty
totals reach $660, although this repre
sents the contributions of only six of
the teaching staff. Complete reports
will probably bring up their total to a
very much higher figure. The meet
ings which were held in nearly every
house Thursday. Friday, and Saturday
were addressed by members of the fac-
ulty or of the committee, and a great
amount of enthusiasm was created.
The national campaign proper, of
which Stanford's drive was a part, is
being launched today throughout the
country with a goal of $35,000,000.
While the United States government
estimates its cost at over fifty millions
a day, for the defense of the nation in
war, these millions are the estimated
amount which will be needed for the
defense of our warriors, through a
period of nine months. Over $11,000,-
000 of the entire amount will be used
for work among the army and navy
men in this country, $11,000,000 among
the American forces at the front, over
$6,000,000 has been apportioned to
work in the Russian, French, and
Italian armies, with a million dollars
to work in the prison camps.
What. Stanford Has Hone.
Stanford's contribution will enable
the Young Men's and Young Women's
Christian Associations to carry on
some important w;ork. The sum thus
far pledged will be sufficient to build
a standard camp building, to supply
a motor truck for supply transport
service in America or in France, to
save the lives of fifty prisoners of war,
to provide writing material enabling
thousands of men in a camp to keep
in touch with home, and to provide
comforts for fifty wounded soldiers.
The expenses for all of the above
things can be met with Stanford's to
tal contribution, and $1,031 will still
be left open for further relief work.
Of the men's pledges, reports from
Encina Hall show that 131 students
contributed $765.50, 206 men from the
fraternities and clubs of the campus
contributed $1,748.50, and Stanford
men in the service contributed $50.
Several of the fraternities and a part
of the Hall have not been heard from
as yet, so that the men's total will
probably be raised considerably by to
night.

totals reach $660, although this repre
sents the contributions of only six of
the teaching staff. Complete reports
will probably bring up their total to a
very much higher figure. The meet
ings which were held in nearly every
house Thursday. Friday, and Saturday
were addressed by members of the fac-
ulty or of the committee, and a great
amount of enthusiasm was created.
The national campaign proper, of
which Stanford's drive was a part, is
being launched today throughout the
country with a goal of $35,000,000.
While the United States government
estimates its cost at over fifty millions
a day, for the defense of the nation in
war, these millions are the estimated
amount which will be needed for the
defense of our warriors, through a
period of nine months. Over $11,000,-
000 of the entire amount will be used
for work among the army and navy
men in this country, $11,000,000 among
the American forces at the front, over
$6,000,000 has been apportioned to
work in the Russian, French, and
Italian armies, with a million dollars
to work in the prison camps.
What. Stanford Has Hone.
Stanford's contribution will enable
the Young Men's and Young Women's
Christian Associations to carry on
some important w;ork. The sum thus
far pledged will be sufficient to build
a standard camp building, to supply
a motor truck for supply transport
service in America or in France, to
save the lives of fifty prisoners of war,
to provide writing material enabling
thousands of men in a camp to keep
in touch with home, and to provide
comforts for fifty wounded soldiers.
The expenses for all of the above
things can be met with Stanford's to
tal contribution, and $1,031 will still
be left open for further relief work.
Of the men's pledges, reports from
Encina Hall show that 131 students
contributed $765.50, 206 men from the
fraternities and clubs of the campus
contributed $1,748.50, and Stanford
men in the service contributed $50.
Several of the fraternities and a part
of the Hall have not been heard from
as yet, so that the men's total will
probably be raised considerably by to
night.
Catching the spirit of the great war
service movement, Stanford truly
"gave till it hurt" in the drive which
was waged on the campus last week.
Reports to date show that the sur
prising total of $9,556 was pledged
for Y. M. C. A. and Y. W. C. A. war
relief work, which overreaches the
i minimum amount of $0,000 by $3,556.
j With the closing reports to come in to
night at S o'clock, when the captains
of the various teams gather for a final
I meeting in the Stanford Union, it is
(easily to be expected that the goal
I originally set will be doubled.
Women Lead Men.
The women of the University still
lead the men in the drive with a total
of $6,300. Stanford men have thus
tar pledged the sura of $2,596, but this
sum represents only the contributions
of 347 men and final reports are still
to come from several of the houses
and groups on the campus. Faculty
totals reach $660, although this repre
sents the contributions of only six of
the teaching staff. Complete reports
will probably bring up their total to a
