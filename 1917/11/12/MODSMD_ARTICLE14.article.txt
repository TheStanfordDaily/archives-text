# VARSITY WINS ANOTHER

Stanford ruggers met some of the hardest Rugby competition Saturday
they have been called upon to face, when they defeated the Olympic Club.
Although the Varsity had several new men in the lineup they played ex
cellent football.
The club men brought the best team down Saturday they have had this
year and from the opening whistle they kept the Varsity on the go. Despite
this fact the Varsity had the edge on them all the time. The new men who
appeared in the lineup showed to excellent advantage as a whole, and
from those who played Saturday several Varsity men will doubtless be de
veloped.
The Olympic Club furnished the Varsity with the kind of competition
they need for the Santa Clara game. The team is rounding into shape now,
and with another game against a strong team they should be in shape for
the final contest a week from Saturday. If preparations count for anything
the Big Game should be a success. Bonfire preparations are going forward
now, the committee is at work on the bleacher stunts, and the student body
is talking up the game. If everyone gets in with the right spirit on this
game Stanford should come through on the long end of the score.
