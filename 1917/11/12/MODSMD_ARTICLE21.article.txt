# Lowell High Tennis Tourney Postponed
## 
### 
Rain interfered with the first ten
nis tournament of the season between
Lowell High School and Stanford's
racquet wielders. The courts were
in poor condition and as a result the
two teams decided not to play the
matches.
Captain Catlin Wolford, '18, an
nounced that the tourney was only
postponed, however, and will be
played in the near future.
