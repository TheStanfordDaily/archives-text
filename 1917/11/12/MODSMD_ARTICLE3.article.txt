# War Is Here ... Doctors Fear .. Germans Near
##

The war isn't all fought "over
there" â€” or in the hot stove league.
Occasionally France and Germany
tangle in supposedly neutral bodies.
And occasionally the war breaks out
in these bodies.*
All of which precludes the state
ment that the conflict between the
French and the Germans has been car
ried to the Stanford campus in the
most violent form. At present the
hordes of Germans have France down
but the allies of the gallant ally are
fighting to stein the tide of the in
vader.
In other words, L. P. DeVries,
French professor, has the German
measles.
