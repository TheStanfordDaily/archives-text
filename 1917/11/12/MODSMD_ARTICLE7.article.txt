# STANFORD WINS LONG DISTANCE RACE
## SCORE STANDS 17-41 Westwick First With Captain McPherson and Samis in Next Two Places 
### 
Stepping off the four and a half
mile course in 20 minutes, 41 seconds,
A. G. Westwick, '18, won the cross
country race between Stanford and
California at Berkeley, Saturday.
Captain J. D. McPherson, 'IS, finished
second, and M. F. Samis, '20, crossed
the line third. The first California
runner to finish was Captain Hum
phreys, who landed the fourth place
berth.
Stanford runners gathered a total
of 17 points against 41 for the Blue
and Gold. First place counted one
point, second place two. and so on
down. Colglazier of Stanford was
fifth, Teitsworth (S) sixth, Reed (C)
seventh, Coles (C) eighth, Raisner
(C) ninth, Sturgeon (S) tenth, Car
lisle IS) eleventh, Cobb (C) twelfth,
and Musser (S) thirteenth. Lloyd, the
crack California two-miler, failed to
finish.
After the race. C. S. Teitsworth, '19,
was elected captain of next year's
Stanford team. Teitsworth finished
sixth in the race Saturday and fifth
last year, showing that he has done
consistent work. He won the mile in
his Freshman year against California.
He is a member of Alpha Delta Phi
fraternity and lives in Los Angeles.
When Walter Christie fired the
starting gun, the three Cardinal run
ners jumped to the front and held
their places to the finish, with Samis
setting the pace. The Bear runners
were encouraged by the crowd to be
lieve that the pace was too fast to be
kept ui), but the Stanford men held to
the gruelling pace to the finish.
Westwick, McPherson, and Samis led
Humphreys by a good margin until the
last quarter of a mile, which was the
scene of the sprint for first place,
Westwick winning out, and Hum
phreys coming in behind the trio.
The runners were required to run
five laps around a seven-eighths of a
mile track, and finish in front of the
stands at the Campanile.
A peculiar incident of the run was
that three of the men placed this year
the same as last: McPherson took
second, Humphreys fourth, and Rais
ner ninth. Captain-elect Teitsworth
of Stanford varied only one place
from his last year's race.
Westwick, McPherson, Samis, Col
glazier, and Teitsworth will receive
Circle S's for their performances,
probably of the first class, if a favor
able decision is given by the Circle S
Society. All of the men deserve this
honor by lowering the flag at Berke
ley, and bringing to Stanford the first
blood of the season from the ancient
enemy.
