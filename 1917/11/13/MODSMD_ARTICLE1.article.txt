### H.G. Swendsen, '20 
With less than two weeks remaining
before the varsities of Stanford and
Santa Clara clash, dopesters are be
ginning to sharpen their pencils to
figure the outcome of the struggle.
Taken as a whole results have been
practically even when the play of both
teams is considered, although any ex
isting advantage would lie given to the!
Red and White.
Comparative Scores l'lqual.
Comparative scores for the two fif
teens put the fans in the air, for they-j
seem contradictory. The only aggre-!
gations both teams have met are the
Palo Alto Athletic Club and the Olym
pic Club of San Francisco. The first
Pally game was the season opener for
Stanford and counted for little. How-j
ever, five weeks ago Santa Clara de
feated the Olympic Club 8 to 0 while j
the following Sunday the Cardinals
handed a beating to the San Francisco |
fifteen by the count of 12 to 3. Stan
ford rolled up a larger score than
Santa Clara but the Varsity's line had
been crossed.
Palo Alto Scores.
Then Santa Clara three weeks ago;
was returned victor over the Palo
Altatis by the count of 30 to 0. The
next Saturday the Varsity took the
same team down the line 49 to 0.
