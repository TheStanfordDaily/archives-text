# DOPE FAVORS SANTA CLARA BY A SHADE
## GAME WILL BE CLOSE Comparative Scores Give Red and White Team Slight Advantage 
### H.G. Swendsen, '20 
With less than two weeks remaining
before the varsities of Stanford and
Santa Clara clash, dopesters are be
ginning to sharpen their pencils to
figure the outcome of the struggle.
Taken as a whole results have been
practically even when the play of both
teams is considered, although any ex
isting advantage would lie given to the!
Red and White.
Comparative Scores l'lqual.
Comparative scores for the two fif
teens put the fans in the air, for they-j
seem contradictory. The only aggre-!
gations both teams have met are the
Palo Alto Athletic Club and the Olym
pic Club of San Francisco. The first
Pally game was the season opener for
Stanford and counted for little. How-j
ever, five weeks ago Santa Clara de
feated the Olympic Club 8 to 0 while j
the following Sunday the Cardinals
handed a beating to the San Francisco |
fifteen by the count of 12 to 3. Stan
ford rolled up a larger score than
Santa Clara but the Varsity's line had
been crossed.
Palo Alto Scores.
Then Santa Clara three weeks ago;
was returned victor over the Palo
Altatis by the count of 30 to 0. The
next Saturday the Varsity took the
same team down the line 49 to 0.
Thus the advantage was heavily in
favor of the Cardinal.
The last contests with the Olympics
pushed the pointer back to Santa
Clara, however. A week ago the
Olympics lost to the Red and White
29 to 0 while the Cardinal count
against the same team was 17 to r>.
Santa Clara's Sunday game ruins the
dope sheet again, however, for the
Palo Alto Club held the Mission fif
teen to a .'52 to 0 score after the 49 to
jO win by Stanford two weeks ago.
Thus as a whole the comparative
scores indicate the teams are prac
tically equal. The one fact that
| stands out, however, is that the Card
inal defense is weaker than that of
Santa Clara, since the Olympics have
j been able to cross the Varsity line
twice while they have not been able to
pass the Santa Clara players for a
counter.
Man for man, also, the teams look
j about the same. In the front rank
Santa Clara has the advantage. Man
jelli and Ferrerio, both freshmen, are
going strong, while the veteran How
ell is a star of the first rank. Also
Curtain may return to the Mission
I University. To oppose these inen
Stanford has Barneson, Betts, and
1 Curtice, none of whom have been in a
I big game.
At lock, John Muldoon and Pettin
! gill will probably fight it out. and
neither seems the stronger. Both
men are experienced and will be stars
j of the contest.
At side rank Santa Clara will prob
ably play Bill Muldoon and Don. To
i oppose them the Varsity has Schwar
• zenbek, Campbell, and Flood.
: Schwarzenbek is as good at present
j as either of the lied and White men,
but Campbell and Flood do not look as
fast as the Santa Clarans.
At rear rank Stanford looks to have
the advantage. Swarts is a real for
ward and will no doubt show better
than either Sheehy or Corte for Santa
Clara, while Kegley and Adams are
fully as good as either Mission player.
Winham, playing wing forward,
looms up about twice as strong as
Vicini for Santa Clara. Winham is a
veteran and in addition to his ability
is able to handle the ball well in pass
ing rushes.
At half the advantage is with Santa
Clara in the veteran Diaz, star of last
year's struggle. To oppose him are
Hauser and Doe.
The two five positions seem to be
for Stanford. Lilly and Chandler,
although they have not played a big
game, are more consistent scorers and
tacklers than Young. O'Connor, or Le
Berveau. It will be from these two
positions the backfield rushes will be
started and the Cardinal advantage
will be a large factor in the final
score.
At center three also. Heron looks
much better than Merritt. On the
wings Santa Clara tops the Cardinal.
"Ruddy" Seholz, and Garcia are both
experienced speed demons, and while
Wark, Falk, and Reynolds are fast,
they do not stack up with the Mission
men.
At full Stanford has the greatest
advantage of either team in Temple
ton. Cota will never outkick or out
guess the Cardinal full if past perform
ances are any criterion.

seem contradictory. The only aggre-!
gations both teams have met are the
Palo Alto Athletic Club and the Olym
pic Club of San Francisco. The first
Pally game was the season opener for
Stanford and counted for little. How-j
ever, five weeks ago Santa Clara de
feated the Olympic Club 8 to 0 while j
the following Sunday the Cardinals
handed a beating to the San Francisco |
fifteen by the count of 12 to 3. Stan
ford rolled up a larger score than
Santa Clara but the Varsity's line had
been crossed.
Palo Alto Scores.
Then Santa Clara three weeks ago;
was returned victor over the Palo
Altatis by the count of 30 to 0. The
next Saturday the Varsity took the
same team down the line 49 to 0.
Thus the advantage was heavily in
favor of the Cardinal.
The last contests with the Olympics
pushed the pointer back to Santa
Clara, however. A week ago the
Olympics lost to the Red and White
29 to 0 while the Cardinal count
against the same team was 17 to r>.
Santa Clara's Sunday game ruins the
dope sheet again, however, for the
Palo Alto Club held the Mission fif
teen to a .'52 to 0 score after the 49 to
jO win by Stanford two weeks ago.
Thus as a whole the comparative
scores indicate the teams are prac
tically equal. The one fact that
| stands out, however, is that the Card
inal defense is weaker than that of
Santa Clara, since the Olympics have
j been able to cross the Varsity line
twice while they have not been able to
pass the Santa Clara players for a
counter.
Man for man, also, the teams look
j about the same. In the front rank
Santa Clara has the advantage. Man
jelli and Ferrerio, both freshmen, are
going strong, while the veteran How
ell is a star of the first rank. Also
Curtain may return to the Mission
I University. To oppose these inen
Stanford has Barneson, Betts, and
1 Curtice, none of whom have been in a
I big game.
At lock, John Muldoon and Pettin
! gill will probably fight it out. and
neither seems the stronger. Both
men are experienced and will be stars
j of the contest.
At side rank Santa Clara will prob
ably play Bill Muldoon and Don. To
i oppose them the Varsity has Schwar
• zenbek, Campbell, and Flood.
: Schwarzenbek is as good at present
j as either of the lied and White men,
but Campbell and Flood do not look as
fast as the Santa Clarans.
At rear rank Stanford looks to have
the advantage. Swarts is a real for
ward and will no doubt show better
than either Sheehy or Corte for Santa
Clara, while Kegley and Adams are
fully as good as either Mission player.
Winham, playing wing forward,
looms up about twice as strong as
Vicini for Santa Clara. Winham is a
veteran and in addition to his ability
is able to handle the ball well in pass
ing rushes.
At half the advantage is with Santa
Clara in the veteran Diaz, star of last
year's struggle. To oppose him are
Hauser and Doe.
The two five positions seem to be
for Stanford. Lilly and Chandler,
although they have not played a big
game, are more consistent scorers and
tacklers than Young. O'Connor, or Le
Berveau. It will be from these two
positions the backfield rushes will be
started and the Cardinal advantage
will be a large factor in the final
score.
At center three also. Heron looks
much better than Merritt. On the
wings Santa Clara tops the Cardinal.
"Ruddy" Seholz, and Garcia are both
experienced speed demons, and while
Wark, Falk, and Reynolds are fast,
they do not stack up with the Mission
men.
At full Stanford has the greatest
advantage of either team in Temple
ton. Cota will never outkick or out
guess the Cardinal full if past perform
ances are any criterion.
With less than two weeks remaining
before the varsities of Stanford and
Santa Clara clash, dopesters are be
ginning to sharpen their pencils to
figure the outcome of the struggle.
Taken as a whole results have been
practically even when the play of both
teams is considered, although any ex
isting advantage would lie given to the!
Red and White.

Palo Alto Scores.
Then Santa Clara three weeks ago;
was returned victor over the Palo
Altatis by the count of 30 to 0. The
next Saturday the Varsity took the
same team down the line 49 to 0.
Thus the advantage was heavily in
favor of the Cardinal.
The last contests with the Olympics
pushed the pointer back to Santa
Clara, however. A week ago the
Olympics lost to the Red and White
29 to 0 while the Cardinal count
against the same team was 17 to r>.
Santa Clara's Sunday game ruins the
dope sheet again, however, for the
Palo Alto Club held the Mission fif
teen to a .'52 to 0 score after the 49 to
jO win by Stanford two weeks ago.
Thus as a whole the comparative
scores indicate the teams are prac
tically equal. The one fact that
| stands out, however, is that the Card
inal defense is weaker than that of
Santa Clara, since the Olympics have
j been able to cross the Varsity line
twice while they have not been able to
pass the Santa Clara players for a
counter.
Man for man, also, the teams look
j about the same. In the front rank
Santa Clara has the advantage. Man
jelli and Ferrerio, both freshmen, are
going strong, while the veteran How
ell is a star of the first rank. Also
Curtain may return to the Mission
I University. To oppose these inen
Stanford has Barneson, Betts, and
1 Curtice, none of whom have been in a
I big game.
At lock, John Muldoon and Pettin
! gill will probably fight it out. and
neither seems the stronger. Both
men are experienced and will be stars
j of the contest.
At side rank Santa Clara will prob
ably play Bill Muldoon and Don. To
i oppose them the Varsity has Schwar
• zenbek, Campbell, and Flood.
: Schwarzenbek is as good at present
j as either of the lied and White men,
but Campbell and Flood do not look as
fast as the Santa Clarans.
At rear rank Stanford looks to have
the advantage. Swarts is a real for
ward and will no doubt show better
than either Sheehy or Corte for Santa
Clara, while Kegley and Adams are
fully as good as either Mission player.
Winham, playing wing forward,
looms up about twice as strong as
Vicini for Santa Clara. Winham is a
veteran and in addition to his ability
is able to handle the ball well in pass
ing rushes.
At half the advantage is with Santa
Clara in the veteran Diaz, star of last
year's struggle. To oppose him are
Hauser and Doe.
The two five positions seem to be
for Stanford. Lilly and Chandler,
although they have not played a big
game, are more consistent scorers and
tacklers than Young. O'Connor, or Le
Berveau. It will be from these two
positions the backfield rushes will be
started and the Cardinal advantage
will be a large factor in the final
score.
At center three also. Heron looks
much better than Merritt. On the
wings Santa Clara tops the Cardinal.
"Ruddy" Seholz, and Garcia are both
experienced speed demons, and while
Wark, Falk, and Reynolds are fast,
they do not stack up with the Mission
men.
At full Stanford has the greatest
advantage of either team in Temple
ton. Cota will never outkick or out
guess the Cardinal full if past perform
ances are any criterion.
