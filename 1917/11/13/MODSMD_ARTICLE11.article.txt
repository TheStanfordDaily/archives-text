# CAMPUS DRIVE NETS $10,300 FOR FOR Y.M.C.A.
## MOKE REPORTS COME Stanford May Rank With First Universities of Country in Totals Pledged 
### 
That Stanford will undoubtedly rank
i among the four first universities of the
Ignited States in totals subscribed in
the big war work drive is the statement
Iliade bv .1. 1!. Watson, former secretary
of the local Y. M. C. A., last night.
With a total to date of $10,300 pledged
reports are still coining in in large
numbers from several of the houses,
the commuters and Palo Alto residents,
parts of Encina Hall, and members of
the faculty.
Women Do Big Work.
Women's reports are practically
complete, with a total of $6,300. The
efficient organization with which the
women of the University carried
through their drive was responsible
for this result. Their present total
exceeds the combined subscriptions of
the faculty and the men students to
date by $2,300. A large committee
j under the leadership of Miss Margaret
jShedd, '20, visited every organization
on the campus and the pledges re
ceived showed true sacrifice in many
| cases. One sorority house contrib
: uted $1,000, while two others pledged
over $500 each.
Men May Top $3,000 Mark.
The men's total, according to the
latest reports, stands at $2,800, but
the local Association is confident that
i the $3,000 mark will he left well be
-1 hind when final reports come in. A
large part of Encina Hall and sev
jeral fraternities and clubs are yet to
Ibe heard from. Difficulty is being ex
perienced in reaching Palo Alto and
! the commuters. Seven hundred
ninety-five dollars and fifty cents is
the amount which Encina Hall has
been credited with thus far, while the
fraternities and clubs have pledged
a total of $1,734.50. Letters from
Stanford men in the service stationed
at various camps and training sta
tions throughout the country have
brought in the sum of $50, showing
that the boys in the army and navy
realize the value of the Y. M. C. A.
work, and are with the University in
the movement.
Thirty men of Stanford's teaching
staff have pledged the sum of $1,200.
The faculty canvass is being carried
out on a different plan from that of
the students, and pledges are coming
in largely through the mail. This
total for the faculty, consequently,
represents not much more than a be
ginning of what might be expected in
the next day or two.
That the minimum of $0,000 which
the local organizations set at the be
ginning of the campaign will be eas
ily doubled by the time the last of the
reports have straggled in is the ex
pectation of the committees in
charge.

Men May Top $3,000 Mark.
The men's total, according to the
latest reports, stands at $2,800, but
the local Association is confident that
i the $3,000 mark will he left well be
-1 hind when final reports come in. A
large part of Encina Hall and sev
jeral fraternities and clubs are yet to
Ibe heard from. Difficulty is being ex
perienced in reaching Palo Alto and
! the commuters. Seven hundred
ninety-five dollars and fifty cents is
the amount which Encina Hall has
been credited with thus far, while the
fraternities and clubs have pledged
a total of $1,734.50. Letters from
Stanford men in the service stationed
at various camps and training sta
tions throughout the country have
brought in the sum of $50, showing
that the boys in the army and navy
realize the value of the Y. M. C. A.
work, and are with the University in
the movement.
Thirty men of Stanford's teaching
staff have pledged the sum of $1,200.
The faculty canvass is being carried
out on a different plan from that of
the students, and pledges are coming
in largely through the mail. This
total for the faculty, consequently,
represents not much more than a be
ginning of what might be expected in
the next day or two.
That the minimum of $0,000 which
the local organizations set at the be
ginning of the campaign will be eas
ily doubled by the time the last of the
reports have straggled in is the ex
pectation of the committees in
charge.
That Stanford will undoubtedly rank
i among the four first universities of the
Ignited States in totals subscribed in
the big war work drive is the statement
Iliade bv .1. 1!. Watson, former secretary
of the local Y. M. C. A., last night.
With a total to date of $10,300 pledged
reports are still coining in in large
numbers from several of the houses,
the commuters and Palo Alto residents,
parts of Encina Hall, and members of
the faculty.
Women Do Big Work.
Women's reports are practically
complete, with a total of $6,300. The
efficient organization with which the
women of the University carried
through their drive was responsible
for this result. Their present total
exceeds the combined subscriptions of
the faculty and the men students to
date by $2,300. A large committee
j under the leadership of Miss Margaret
jShedd, '20, visited every organization
on the campus and the pledges re
ceived showed true sacrifice in many
| cases. One sorority house contrib
: uted $1,000, while two others pledged
over $500 each.
