						REAL BONFIRE
## 
### 
From all indications the Freshmen are going to give us a real bonfire
this year. They are getting their time cards printed now and have already
gotten a line on available bonfire material spotted. With the upperclass
supervision which will control the bonfire, the Freshmen are working under
a plan which will minimize the using of available kindling wood. iheii
schedules for working on the bonfire are so arranged as not to interfere
with their studies.
Despite the outburst of opposition to the bonfire earlier in the year,
during which the bonfire was deemed a dark and dismal failure, the bonfire
rally should be the biggest booster of the year for the Santa Clara game.
From arrangements made the succcss of the bonfire itself is assured pro
vided of course the Freshmen carry them out. The old Stanford spirit is
rousing itself again and by November 24 should be in a white heat. No
body wants the Varsity that takes the field a week from Saturday to win
that game alone. A lot of jazz on the part of the student body will go a
long ways.
