Three names have been dropped from the Freshman football squad
since the Freshman game with Santa Clara. Such spirit is, to say the least,
discouraging. These men won their places in the Santa Clara contest be
cause of the showing they had made all during the season. They deserved
them because they showed the right kind of football ability and because
they showed the right kind of spirit. Although their big game was that with
Santa Clara they went into the season's training fully understandinfi that
training rules were to be in force until the schedule was completed and the
coach had given them permission to break. If he had not needed them or
wanted them longer he would have advised them of the fact. Men are need
ed out there for the remaining games of the Freshmen schedule and to form
part of the Second Varsity as a unit to give the Varsity the proper competi
tion for the Santa Clara game. Much of the success of the Varsity is de
pendent on what kind of competition they get in practice. The Freshmen
who arc out for football owe it to themselves and to the success of the
Varsitv to stay out until granted permission to leave by the coach.
