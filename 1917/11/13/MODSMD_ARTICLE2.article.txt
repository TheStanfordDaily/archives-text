# Advertising Will Feature 1920 Play
## Arrival of Manuscripts for "It Pays to Advertise" to Begin Tryouts 
### 
Publicity for "It Pays to Advertise,"
1920 selection for the Sophomore
Play, will be upon an unusual scale,
featuring many new and novel meth
ods in campus advertising. The pro
duction staff, consisting of A. T.
George. '20, business manager, and E.
I! Harper, '20, advertising manager,
has announced this fact, and asserts,
in addition, that one of the features,
now being considered by the Sopho
more Play Committee, is the abolition
of the paid advertising manager, thus
eliminating the expense of his cus
tomary publicity medium.
Tickets will cost fifty cents, sev
enty-five cents, and a dollar. The ad
visability of donating part or all of
the funds received above the expenses
of production to the American Red
Cross, or some war charity, is being
actively agitated by committee mem
bers. A decision on this subject will
undoubtedly lie reached by an open
discussion at the Sophomore Class
meeting Wednesday.
Only one hitch has been actively
encountered so far by Coach Frank
\i. Mathieu, and that is the non-arrival
of the manuscripts; the second try
outs cannot be held until the coach
can personally select his cast from
the tryoutees' interpretation of the
characters of the play, and their suit
ability to the parts. However, the
typewritten copies of the play are ex
pected by Thursday, with tryouts
scheduled probably for Friday.
