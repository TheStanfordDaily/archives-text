# ALUMNI TO VISIT UNIVERSITY TOMORROW
## WILL MEET ANNUALLY Plan Is to Have Alumni Return Each Year to Establish Closer Relations 
### 
Attempting to establish closer rela
tions between students, faculty, and
alumni by establishing the precedent
of an annual visit from representa
tives of the alumni, is the primary ob
ject of the alumni visitors, expected
on the campus Thursday at 10:30. A
side issue is the "killing of two birds
with one stone," since the members of
the Alumni Executive Committee can
hold their required annual campus
meeting on the same day that they are
being entertained by the University.
The party is to consist of members
from the Alumni Advisory Board and
the Executive Committee of the Alum
ni Association, and "will probably be
about fifteen in number. To aid them
in their work of inspection, investiga
tion, and co-operation, a complete
program has been provided for the
day. They will attend the Assembly
at 11 o'clock, and from there will go
to the President's home, where Mrs.
Ray Lyman Wilbur plans to entertain
them at lunch.
The committee will tour the cam
portunity of watching the military
drill.
The climax of the day will be
reached by the dinner, which is plan
ned for the Union at 7 o'clock. Lead
ers in student activities have been
asked to attend the banquet, so that
the alumni may see and talk with the
men who are taking their places in
student enterprise. Members of the
Men's and Women's conferences, the
Students' Executive Committee, presi
dents of the four classes, editors of
campus publications, and executive
heads of the faculty have been in
vited. and are expected to attend the
dinner. Informal discussion will
probably be a feature.
