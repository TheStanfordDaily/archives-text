Being the head of the Sf>n Fran
cisco business organization, Koster is
extremely well posted on the subject
of civic duty. Since San Francisco has
been the scene of various labor diffi
culties of late, the speak ir has been
given an insight into municipal prob
lems which should be of considerable
interest to students.

the Alumni Association will tomorrow
morning attend the assembly in a body,
following which they will lunch with
Mrs. Ray Lyman Wilbur.
