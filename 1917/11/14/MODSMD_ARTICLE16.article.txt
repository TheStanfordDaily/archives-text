# De Grassis' Please Stanford Audience
## Violinist and Singer With Able Accompanist Give Unusual Program 
### 
As an artist, -technician, and com
poser, Signor Antonio de Grassi, vio
linist. played his way into the hearts
of an enthusiastic Stanford audience
in the Assembly Hall last night. From
his opening number, Jean Marie Le
clair's "Sonata in D Major," Signor de
Grassi proved himself a musician of
unusual ability.
Madame de Grassi, who was Wini
fred June Morgan, '01, assisted her
husband with several songs, first, and
perhaps the best of which was the
"Mimi" aria from "La Boheme." Her
I
j voice was of a most pleasing quality,
particularly in the middle register. •
■ As an encore she sang "A Soldier's
i Prayer," a simple piece of the con
ventional dirge type, written by Signor
| do Grassi, who in this instance accom
panied her on the piano.
Signor de Grassi's second group of
pieces held an added interest, as three
ol them were of his own composition,
jOf these, the "Berceuse" was especi
ally beautiful. The "Tambourin
Chinois" by Kreisler gave the per-
I former ample opportunity to display
his skill in bowing. His encore was
; the "Liebesleid" of Kreisler.
In Madame de Grassi's last group
of songs, the one of especial interest
was "Barbara's Lullaby," written in
honor of Dr. Jordan's daughter Bar
bara. Her encore, "Mister Bear," by
Nora Blainey, was well received.
The final selection was the "Faust
Fantasy," by Wieniawski. Signor de
Grassi's handling of the difficult liar
monies in this piece was brilliant.
Not readily forgotten was the work
!of the accompanist, Mr. Frederick
Maurer. Jr. His accompaniments were
rendered in a thoroughly artistic and
most acceptable manner. He was at
all times in sympathy with the mood
of his principal, subordinating his
own individuality to that of the solo
ist, yet playing with force.
