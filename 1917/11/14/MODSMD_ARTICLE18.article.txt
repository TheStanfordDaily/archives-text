# SPILLED

The pep displayed by the crowd at the football rally last night was
certainly proof that Stanford spirit isnot entirely dead. The team should
have had this proof earlier in the season, but now that it is started and
they are reasonably assured that the student body is behind them, and not
willing to let them battle alone against Santa Clara, it is up to everyone
to dig in and continue that kind of encouragement from now until the
24th.
Everyone present, and that does not include the entire student body by
any means, was full of the right kind of spirit and they did not hesitate to
let it out. The men on the training table who braved the howling mob and
spoke at the rally expressed the greatest optimism, and every prediction ol'
a victory was greeted with a fresh burst of enthusiasm.
Stanford is going to win that Big Game, but as coach, captain, manager
and players emphasized last night, the team needs the support of the stu
dent body. There is only one more week-end contest before the final game.
Saturday games have not been attended as they should have been this
year. With only one more chance left to vindicate ourselves in the eyes of
the team, the alumni who think Stanford spirit is dead, and the ouside
world, every student in the University should be down in the bleachers Sat
urday afternoon giving the team the best they have in support.
