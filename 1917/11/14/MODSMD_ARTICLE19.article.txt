# WELCOME, ALUMNI!
## 
### 
Stanford will be host tomorrow to the Alumni Advisory Board on the
occasion of their annual visit to the campus. In late years this function
has not amounted to much but this year an effort will be made to make the
day more of an event. The board will visit classes, attend the assembly and
in the evening take dinner with the officers of the various student organ
izations and faculty representatives.
The alumni can do the University a lot of good if they are given the
opportunity to see just how things are at Stantord now, and we know ol
no better medium of showing them than through such a visit as they are
making tomorrow. Stanford has never had the reputation of being a mere
factory where men and women are turned out into the world equipped only
mentally. Men and women who form the alumni of Stanford are, in addi
tion to their book education, filled with Stanford spirit. They cannot be ex
pected to retain that spirit unless they keep in touch with the University.
The kind of reception we give them tomorrow will mean much toward de
termining their attitude toward the University in coming years, for the visit
of this board will be transmitted to the entire Alumni Association.
