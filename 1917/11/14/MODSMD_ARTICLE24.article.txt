# Engineer Classes Retarded by War
## Materials Not Available for Carrying Out Plans Made by Depaatments 
### 
The war has hit the Engineering de
partments harder, perhaps, than any
others in Stanford University. Not
only has the call to the colors taken
a large portion of the upperclassmen,
but also the demand for war materials
by the government has made it im
possible to get the necessary supplies
with which to carry out the many ex
periments that had been outlined for
the year.
The plans that have been drawn for
making and testing new kinds of
gears are idly awaiting the arrival of
the special machinery that is being
built for the work.
The experiments in the gravity flow
of oil that are to be conducted for the
government are being delayed for the
want of pipe and the other necessary
equipment.
Invetigationsin aerodynamics are
likewise being held up. However, an
important report embodying the re
sult of several experiments in aero
nautics has been submitted to the gov
ernment by Professor E. P. Lesley.
The departments have received a 1
little encouragement in the report j
that the enrollment in the lower 1
classes is larger than last year.
