■
Red clouds of fire burst into the sky
and dense, choking clouds of smoke
arose. Cries of "Fire'' disturbed the
midnight air and soon women were
running about in a garb meant only
for those who have retired. Men

freshman climbed the fire escape to
save the perishing members of the
"500."
The climax was reached when some
one cried "Wimen and Choldren
first.''
The whole tragedy turned out to be
red fire which had been placed under
the back porch of the Chi Omega house
and lighted. The plot was well laid,
however, for soon after the "fire"
started some fifty students were call
ing "fire" all around the ill-fated house
and the whole campus was soon dis
turbed,
