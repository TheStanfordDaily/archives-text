# STANFORD SPIRIT BLAZES FORTH IN RALLY
## EXPRESS CONFIDENCE Coach and Captain Sound Call for Support of Varsity Fifteen 
### 
Big Game enthusiasm and Stanford
spirit blazed forth in the first rally of
the football season, last night, when
Rugby supporters yelled, ran, sang,
and turned loose their full assortment
of noise-making schemes to show how
fully they are back of Stanford's fif
teen on November 24. The rally
started spontaneously but before it
had gone far, yell leaders and stu
dents were assembled in full force be
fore the Beta Theta Pi house, demand'
ing to see their hopefuls.
Last night's outburst was the first
real spirit seen this year, but in gen
eral noise and action it made up for
lost time. After marching and run
ning up and down the Row and around
Encina Hall, the enthusiasts finally
landed at the training house and
opened up another notch.
In answer to the fans Coach W.vlie
appeared and was answered by wild
enthusiasm. The Stanford mentor
opened up his heart to the men of the
Cardinal and thanked them for the
first support of the season. "If the
men will keep up the spirit shown to
night and add a little more 011 the
afternoon of the big game, I am con
fident they will see a victorious team,"
were the closing words of his talk.
Next, Captain Pettingill appeared on
the scene, and after a "skyrocket,"
criticised the small attendance at the
pre-season games and told the fans
what real support meant to the team.
"Men on the campus have the idea
that Santa Clara has the advantage in
the game on the 24th, but 1 believe
the advantage will be with Stanford,"
the skipper said.
Graduate Manager Hauser was the
cext speaker, followed by Heron,
Swarts, and Schwarzenbek, all of
whom reiterated the words of coach
and captain, with the statement that
support is the only factor lacking at
present for a winning combination.
Not satisfied with individual mem
bers of the Varsity the rooters called
for the whole squad and when they
appeared the noise was loud enough
to wake up Santa Clara's coach, down
the bay.
After additional yells, "Hail, Stan
ford, Hail," and a "Varsity" ended the
rally.
