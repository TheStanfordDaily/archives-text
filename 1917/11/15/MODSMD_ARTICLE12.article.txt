# VARSITY AND OLYMPICS IN LAST BATTLE
## IS CRUCIAL CONTEST Stockton and Lick Teams Play Curtain Raiser to Rugby Card at 2:00 
### 
Stanford's Varsity, in its crucial
game of the season with the exception
of Santa Clara, and two of the best, if
not the best, high chool trams in the
state, is the Rugby card to be handed
the fans on the Varsity turf Satur
day. The carnival will open when
Stockton High School and Lick-Wil
merding High School play at 2 p.m.
The Varsity struggle with the Olympic
Club will come immediately afterward.
Fans should be furnished a real
treat when Ifiie Varsity and the San
Francisco club fifteens tangle. Coach
Wylie has his players in the best pos
sible condition and in addition to this
fact the men who take part in the
contest will be fighting for their posi
tions on the team, which will be se
lected next week. As a result some
hard fight can be expected. The line
up that will be sent against the Olym
pics is still uncertain, but Coach Wylie
will pick his men tomorrow.
In contrast with two of the best
senior teams playing, the junior game
between the two high schools will
furnish some thrills. Stockton was
defeated by Lick early in the season
by the close margin of one point. The
Stockton fifteen was entirely inex
perienced this year, however, and they
have developed a real team since the
Lick loss.
The San Francisco combination de
feated Lowell and several other pow
erful teams and from indications has
a powerful, fast fifteen.
Saturday's high school game will de
cide, with the exception of Fremont
High Scliool of Oakland, the Rugby
championship of California.
