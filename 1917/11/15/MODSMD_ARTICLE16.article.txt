# LOOK PLEASANT PLEASE

Pictures for the 1919 Quad are coming in exceptionally slowly this
year. Those in charge of putting out the hook this year are very anxious
to get the material in as soon as possible in order that the hook may be
complete.
Figures from the Registrar's office show a constant falling off in the
registration, due to men leaving for duty in some branch of national ser
vice. There is a natural desire on the part of campus organizations to be
as well represented as possible in their particular department of the Quad
and to do this they must get their pictures taken at once in order to be
represented by a full quota.
The Quad is, to a certain extent, the history of the University for a
year. Tf the Quad is complete and does not represent the University
in full then it does not fulfill its function. Of course the major part of the
burden rests on the Quad management, but unless the individuals and organ
izations whose pictures should appear in the book do their part, then for
that deficiency the Quad staff cannot be blamed. We earnestly urge all or
ganizations and individuals to have their pictures taken at once so that the
Quad this year may be as before, a true representation of the University
life for the year 1917-1918.
