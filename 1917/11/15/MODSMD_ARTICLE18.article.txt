# GLOOM BURIED DEEP AT ECON GATHERING
## 
### 
Judging from the enthusiasm dis
play ed by those present the Econom
ics smoker held last night at the Union
was a decided success. The spirit of
the gathering, which went off with a
bang and plenty of smokes, was con
tinued throughout the entire evening,
and the congenial spirits of the crowd
was increased when several large
boxes of mountain apples made their
appearance on the scene, only to dis
appear with amazing rapidity.
Professor Wildman spoke to the
gathering early in tlx 1 evening and
emphasized the revival of economic
theory that was sure to follow the
close of the present war, and told of
the opportunities that would be open
to Economics men alter the war. Pro
fessor Whitaker entered into the role
of a comedian when he rehearsed to
the crowd his experiences in traveling
through Germany just after the Boer
War and being taken for an English
man.
