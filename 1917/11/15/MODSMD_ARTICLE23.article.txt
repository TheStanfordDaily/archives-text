# Plan Club to Back Policies of Wilson
## E. B. Krehbiel Heads Movement To Give Active Support To President 
### 
Unsatisfied with showing merely a
passive interest in the success and
outcome of the war and the support
I of the policies of President Wilson, a
group of live men on the campus,
headed by Professor E. 15. Krehbiel,
are contemplating the formation of a
club which would do real work along
that line. The origin of the idea was
in Professor Krehbiel's addresses to
the literary and debating organizations
on the campus, when he so vividly em
phasized the fact that many of the
American people are beginning to lose
faith in the President because they did
I not understand his policies.
The club, if successfully organized,
j will provide an opportunity for its
members to go from place to place
and address public meetings, explain
ing the real meaning of the Presi
dent's policies and speaking 011 the
necessity of getting the people behind
his policies in order to successfully
make the world free for democracy.
Professor Krehbiel, who is at the
I head of the movement, is probably one j
of the best informed men in the coun-
I
\ try on these questions. Previous to 1
the declaration of war against Ger
many he spent an entire year at,
Washington, devoting all his time to,
the study of the preparedness move
ment in this country, and since that
time has made a specialty of the
President's policies.
A meeting will lie called in the near
future, probably as early as Friday,,
for the purpose of organizing and put
ting the movement on a workable
basis. Notice of (he meeting will be
given through the columns of this
paper, and posted on the board at the j
corner of the History building. All,
men interested in the movement are
urged to attend the initial meeting,
and an opportunity to do some patri
otic service will be given each man.
