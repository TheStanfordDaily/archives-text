# Co-operative Buying Is Found Efficient
## Papers Issued by Food Bureau Proving Great Benefit to Houses 
### 
Cooperative buying is an institution
I that has evidently come to stay at
J Stanford, and the campus food admin
istration is now able to announce that
j tlie system is working smoothly in the
| field to which it is at present con
fining itself. All but two of the men's
| living groups have entered the agree
ment, and the women's houses are re
' ported to be about to do so.
| The purpose of the system as at
present organized, according to R. M.
Jones, '20, campus food administrator,
is to keep the various house managers
informed as to the condition of the
markets, and to enable them, by com-
J billing, to place their orders to best
advantage. In this connection bulle
tins have been issued on fuel, butter
and eggs, milk, meats, sugar, and veg
etables. Contracts have been let for
several staples for the combined
groups, and hundreds of dollars have
| been saved in this way. Supplies are
! to be purchased principally from the
j Palo Alto merchants.
| The campus food administration is
, working directly under the national
I food administration through Mr. Ralph
; Merritt, who is in charge of the work
in California. Numerous inquiries
j have been received from other col
leges concerning the work, and many
j individuals and groups off the cam
; pus have attempted to enter the agree
i ment. In this connection Mr. .Tones
states that only living groups on the
; campus will be admitted to the benefits
j of the arrangement.
