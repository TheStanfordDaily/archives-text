# DEBATERS ARGUE WAR PROFIT TAX
## 
### 
Arguing the affirmative of the ques
jtion, "Resolved, That the United States
j should levy a tax of 50 per cent or
|over on all excess war profits," C. O.
Fenlason, '19, and James Petrini, '21,
| won a unanimous decision last night
|at the Euphronia meeting. P. J. Erick
| son, '21, and B. W. Hartman, '20, spoke
on the negative side of the question
; and offered a very plausible substitute
!to the proposed plan in the form of
a graduated tax on excess profits
above five thousand dollars. After
the debate the critic, Miller L. Mc-
Clintock, '18, gave an instructive talk
on the merits of the arguments
I brought up by the speakers, and gave
jsome general advice on how to ac
; quire the faculty of self-criticism.
