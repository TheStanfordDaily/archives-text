# Wranglers In Favor Of Labor Conscription
## 
### 
"We must organize all our resources
—human and material —if we win this
war," stated Elizabeth Elliott,' 20, in a
talk before the Wranglers last night
on Conscriptive Labor. Our tirst line
of defense is the industrial army, and
as 50 per cent of the men called out
in the selective draft were rejected,
the next step to take would be to en
list them in the industrial army. A
plausible plan for conscriptive labor
was discussed by the club whereby all
industries that were scarce of labor
could be replenished by those not in
the regular army.
