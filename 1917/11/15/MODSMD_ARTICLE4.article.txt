### 
The new Art Gallery, donated by
Thomas Welton Stanford, eldest
brother of Leland Stanford, will be of
ficially opened to the public Decem
ber The building, designed by
Bakewell and Brown, is the finest and
most perfect art gallery in the west, —
the lighting and interior arrangement
being of especial note. The gallery
forms the keystone building of the new
quadrangle.
It is planned to bring traveling ex
hibits of paintings, sculpture, and
etchings out from the east, and the
lirst exhibition of this nature will be
on the opening day, when the Pennell
war lithographs will lie shown. The
primary purpose °l the gallery is, j
however, to house the Thomas Welton |
Stanford collection of oil paintings, j
about one hundred in number. The I
pictures were selected by Mr. Stan
ford, from time to time, from the best
things at the Melbourne Art Exhibit.
Mr. Stanford has a further collection
of some two hundred pictures, in Aus- j
tralia, which he will ship to the Uni
versity as soon as transportation
facilities will permit.
