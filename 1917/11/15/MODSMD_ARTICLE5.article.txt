the best means of the coordination of
human forces,"' said F. .1. Koster, pres

Mr. Koster emphasized the import
ance of the individual's civic duty.
"Let us make government 'for the
people, by the people, and of the peo
ple', a reality and not a catch phrase.
Let us do our share to preserve that
for which our country was created
and uphold those things which lie at
the base of humanity and civilization,
â€”individual liberty and self-expres
sion. It is our duty as Americans to
uphold the principle of the Stars and
Stripes and to take the leadership in
the world, and you as an individual
must realize this."
Mr. Koster sketched the organiza

groups and departments.
"Our aim," he said, "is to under

and to stress the sense of individual
public duty, and further the coordin
ization of human forces."
