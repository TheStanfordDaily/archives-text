# "Toy Shop" Will Be Given November 21
## 
### 
The program to be staged for Bel
gian relief in the Assembly Hall of
the I'niversity on November 21 will
consist of three parts, the whole to
be called "La Fete des Poupees."
The animated silhouettes which
iMiss Diaz is representing for the first
number, have never been given else
where, and are based on the Diefen
bach decorative panels of running and
leaping figures of children and ani
mals. Among the children taking
part in this number are Jean Kellogg,
Katrina Carruth, Christine Krehbiel.
and Rosamund Peirce.
â€¢The Toy-Shop," musical panto
mime, which forms the main feature
of the evening'- entertainment, is
based on an old pantomime known as
"Die Puppenfee." The whole story,
in the course of which the toy-shop
is brought to life at the touch of a
fairy, forms a pantasy that with the
acting should prove of a high order.
