Stanford's all-star aggregation of
swimmers face the hardest battle of
the season when they compete with a
similar combination of high school
stars from San Francisco, Saturday

Speed, class, and thrills await the
crowd that will storm the gallery. As
seating arrangements have been pro

tend the meet free of charge and seats
will be reserved for them.
The Cardinal swimmers are in prime
condition and from the dope sheet
should spring a surprise upon the
high school stars. Julien and Tait
should show to best advantage for the
city men but they will be ably assist
ed by a strong team unknown to Stan
ford fans.
