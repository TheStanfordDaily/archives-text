# GET OFF THE DIME, FROSH
## 
### 
Less than one week remains in which to complete the bonfire for the
annual football rally to be held next Thursday night. At the rate progress
is being made now the bonfire is not going to amount to a whole lot. The
bonlire is a Freshman function. Ever since its introduction as a rally
feature that part of the celebration has bee nentrusted to them. In former
years they have looked upon it as a real honor. As men of the older
classes look back over their college life they think of the bonfire as the
greatest thing they ever took part in for making friends.
Is the bonfire losing its importance as a part of Freshman duty?
Does the present first-year class think it is being imposed upon when it is
granted the opportunity of winning the approval of the upper classes if it
does its job well? Or is it, perhaps, bcause the members are getting no in
dividual credit, due to the fact that the cards are not out so that they can
have them punched? That is the answer given by a couple of Freshmen
this morning when asked why they were not working on the bonfire during
a vacant period. If all the bonfire means to the Freshmen is to have a
punched card showing how much time they have putin, we had better put
it in other hands.
Come on, Freshmen! Get off the dime and put that bonfire up. We're
betting on you and counting on you. You wont regret it, and when it's ail
over our opinion of you will be based on what kind of showing you make
between now and next Thursday.
