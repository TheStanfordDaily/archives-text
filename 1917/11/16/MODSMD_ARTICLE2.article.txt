Varsity soccer men mix with the
Camp Fremont soldiers in their third
game of the season tomorrow after
noon. The game will be called at 2
o'clock sharp, and thirty minute halves
will be played in order that Stanford

spite of handicaps in the way of lack
of equipment and playing facilities.

plenty of competition, and a live con
test is assured.
Stanford's latest acquisition in the
form of a goal keeper is a valuable
asset to the Varsity. Newland is
