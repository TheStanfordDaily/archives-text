# GRADUATES IN QUOTA OF MEN TO NEW CAMP
## 
### 
Stanford graduates now in the mili
tary service, either enlisted or drafted,
will be eligible to compete for posi
tions in the quota that will be sent
from this institution to the third
training camp at the Presidio.
Word of this new ruling was re
ceived by Major Jens Bugge yester
day and further stated that men who
j took advantage of the opportunity
j would not be called for personal or
physical examination. Regulations
were stated governing their transfer
from the Regular Army, National
Guard, or draft divisions, to the train
ing school.
Early in December the Major will
appoint fourteen men from here to
enter the Officers' Camp and the eli
gibility of enlisted graduates for the
positions will make the competition
much stronger than it was at first
