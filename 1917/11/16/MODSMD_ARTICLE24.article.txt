# Must Pay Quad Dues
## 
### 
Junior dues and pictures must be
in before December 10 if the publica
tion of the 1919 Quad is to go ahead.
Editor S. E. Briggs, '19, says that it
is imperative that all pictures be
taken this quarter and that assess
ments be paid so that some idea of
the finances to figure on will be
known. As the registration.this quar
ter is probably the largest of > the
year, that the book may be represent
ative of the Junior Class, pictures
should be taken at once at "Pop"
Franklin's.
All fraternity and sorority pictures,
as well as the Junior pictures, must I
also lie taken this quarter.
