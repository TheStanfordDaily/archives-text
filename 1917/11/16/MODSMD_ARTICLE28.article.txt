# Sophomore Play Tryouts Delayed
## Non-Arrival of Manuscripts Will Temporarily Hold Up the Production 
### 
With the manuscripts for"It Pays
|to Advertise" somewhere en route, it
is not known as yet when the rehear
sals for the Sophomore Play will be
gin. The final tryouts cannot be held
until the copies of the play arrive, but
members of the 1920 committee antici
pate, with as much certainty as can be
expected, considering the irregularity
of express and mail deliveries, the ar
rival of the manuscripts by Monday at
the latest, and hope to bold the final
competition for parts on that date.
Those whose names have appeared in
these columns as having successfully
completed the first elimination tests
are asked to watch for the announce
ment of the second tryouts and to hold
themselves in readiness.
In explanation of the cause for send
ing east for the manuscripts, it has
been brought to light that the Stan
ford production will probably be the
first amateur presentation of "It Pays
to Advertise" in this part of the coun
try. The play is not permitted by the
original George M. Cohan production
company to be published or printed,
without its special permission. This
is to keep the comedy off the open am
ateur play market. A royalty of $.">0
was paid by the IOL'O class for rights
of production, and typewritten manu
scripts are being loaned the coach and
actors for the rehearsing and presen
tation period, with an understanding
that they are to be returned.
