# Percy A. Martin in Important Research
## Stanford Professor Made Member of Commission to Study Mexican Conditions 
### 
j Professor Percy A. Martin of the |
History department has been chosen
as a member of the Edward L. Do
heny Research Foundation, a commis
sion made up mostly of professors
from American universities, to study
the sociological and economic condi
jtions of Mexico. This work is made
possible through a contribution of
$100,000 by Edward L. Doheny, oil
magnate of Los Angeles.
The men on the commission are
|convinced that a study of the under
lying geographical, historical, and
economic facts will be the means of
affording the American people a sym
pathetic knowledge of conditions in
Mexico. It is their purpose to try to
cultivate a community of interest be
tween the Mexicans and the people of
this country, and to draw the peoples
of both republics closer together.
Professor Martin says the commis
sion expects to study the Mexican
; problem from written articles, from
i holding conferences with men who
have lived and worked with the Mex
' ican people, from any other available
matter that can be had in this coun
try, and from field work In Mexico.
Before leaving for their field work,
members of the commission will carry
on a large part of their study in
j Washington, D. C.
The members of the commission
| from California, besides Professor
I Martin, are Professor Herbere E.
I Bolton, Professor Bernard Moses, Dr.
j Jessica Peixotto of the University of
j California, Miss Elizabeth Skeele, di-
J rector of outdoor recreation for San
j Mateo county, and Miss M. E. Palmer
of the Berkeley High School faculty.
| The others are Professor Richard T.
| Ely and Professor Chester L. Jones of
jthe University of Wisconsin, and
Charles W. Pepper, former commer
cial adviser of the Department of
State at Washington.
