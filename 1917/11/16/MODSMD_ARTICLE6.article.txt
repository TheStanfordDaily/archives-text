# Red Paint Feature of S.C. Night Raid
## 
### 
Drops of red paint upon the Santa
Clara campus last night spelt first
blood in the annual pre-game battles
between Santa Clara and Stanford.
An automobile load of Stanfordites
journeyed down to the Mission in
stitution, shortly before midnight, and
dabbed the fences and sidewalks with
the triumphant cardinal. Stanford
will constantly and prominently be
before the eyes of the Santa Clarans,
since every time that a Missionite
leaves the formitory, huge signs of
"Stanford'' and "Razz Santa Clara"
will confront him upon fence and
sidewalk.
Attempts were likewise made to
light the bonfire, but due to the fact
that there were no shavings handy,
the result was not what had been an
ticipated. The Santa Clara guard was
aroused and fired several shots at the
fast-disappearing, successful paint
daubers.
