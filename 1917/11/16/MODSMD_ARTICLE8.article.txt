# RELIEF FUND HAS EXCEEDED GOAL BY $5,390
## TOTAL NETS $11,390 National Drive is Strongly Supported by Stanford Women and Men 
### 
Stanford's quota iu the big national
war relief campaign now stands at the
surprising total of $11,390, nearly
double the sum which was originally
determined upon as a minimum goal.
There is little doubt but that the
$12,000 mark will be topped when the
last of the reports come in.
The sum of $:>.147 has been pledged
by the 420 men from whom cards have
been received, while from 400 women,
$6,300 has been subscribed. This
makes, in round numbers, an average
pledge for each woman of twice that
for each man, an example of sacrifice
and helpful spirit of which Stanford
women can well be proud. Every
group on the campus lias been heard
from except the El Camino Club,
whose report is expected tonight.
From the sixty members of the fac
ulty from whom cards have been re
ceived, $1,800 has been pledged. Fac
ulty reports are also incomplete.
Their subscriptions h*ve been coming
in largely through the mail thus far,
and a thorough canvass of the teach
ing staff has not been put through as
yet.
Cleaning up all relief work in one
great campaign, the University of Cali
fornia has topped the $40,000 mark to
date. Fifty per cenr of the subscrip
tions will go to the Y. M. C. A. in This
drive, so that IT.1 T . C. now boasts a $20,-
000 total for"V" work. Belgian re
lief, Red Cross, and all the other relief
movements are included in the drive,
for which the goal has been set at
$00,000.
