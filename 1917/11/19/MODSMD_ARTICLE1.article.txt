### 
Stanford Varsity took the Olympic
Club into camp, Saturday, 36 to 14, in
the final game before Santa Clara and
Stanford meet to decide the Rugby
supremacy. Coach Wylie gave every
man on the Varsity squad a chance to
show his wares, and will pick the fif
teen best men from their showing Sat
urday.
Perhaps the greatest find in Satur
day's play was big "Swede" Righter.
Although he has been out for football
all season Righter has not shown the
necessary fight before. At breakaway
Saturday, however, he proved he has
football ability and fight, which will
put up a great bid for a Varsity berth.
In addition to Righter, Lilly at first
five, Chandler at second five, and Tem
pleton at full put up a real game of
Rugby.
Stanford counted first when Temple
ton dropped it over from the forty
yard line on a free kick. Soon after,
Morse, playing for Heron, went over

Chandler to Morse. Templeton failed
to convert by inches. Adams scored
next from the ruck and Templeton
converted, making the count 11 to 0.
The backfield got into action again to
ward the end of the first period and
the result was a try, Hauser to Lilly
to Chandler. Templeton again con
verted. The score at half-time was
16 to 0.
At the beginning of the second half
Coach Wylie putin practically an en

Fitzpatrick to Smith. Larkin failed
to convert. The Varsity drew next
blood when Clark went over, Morse to
Kegley to Campbell to Clark. Tem
pleton put the ball between the posts

Larkin to Swigart, which Larkin con
verted. With the 31 to 11 Falk went

Stanford Varsity took the Olympic
Club into camp, Saturday, 36 to 14, in
the final game before Santa Clara and
Stanford meet to decide the Rugby
supremacy. Coach Wylie gave every
man on the Varsity squad a chance to
show his wares, and will pick the fif
teen best men from their showing Sat
urday.
Perhaps the greatest find in Satur
day's play was big "Swede" Righter.
Although he has been out for football
all season Righter has not shown the
necessary fight before. At breakaway
Saturday, however, he proved he has
football ability and fight, which will
put up a great bid for a Varsity berth.
In addition to Righter, Lilly at first
five, Chandler at second five, and Tem
pleton at full put up a real game of
Rugby.
Stanford counted first when Temple
ton dropped it over from the forty

on a sixty-yard passing rush, Lilly to
Chandler to Morse. Templeton failed
to convert by inches. Adams scored
next from the ruck and Templeton
converted, making the count 11 to 0.
The backfield got into action again to
ward the end of the first period and
the result was a try, Hauser to Lilly
to Chandler. Templeton again con
verted. The score at half-time was
16 to 0.
At the beginning of the second half
Coach Wylie putin practically an en
tire new team. The Varsity main
tained its supremacy, however, during
the first few minutes. After see-saw
play, Falk went over 011 a pretty rush,
Sheldon to Morse to Falk. Templeton
converted. 011 the kick-off Kegley se
cured the oval and started a rush for
a try. The ball passed from Kegley
to Flood to Campbell to Flood to
Prior. Templeton kept 11his average
by converting again, and the count
was 26 to 0.
This try evidently awakened the
Olympics for they came back in great
shape and Smith went over, Larkin to
Fitzpatrick to Smith. Larkin failed
to convert. The Varsity drew next
blood when Clark went over, Morse to
Kegley to Campbell to Clark. Tem
