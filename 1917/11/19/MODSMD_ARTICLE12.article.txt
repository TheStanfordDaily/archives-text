### 
The war hit Stanford from another
angle, last night, when Professor Ed
ward B. Krehbiel, of the History de
partment, and a well-known scholar
of international affairs, left for the
east to assume a position offered by
the United States government to do
research work in connection with the
war. The exact character of this
work is not known.
Professor Krehbiel's absence is not
permanent. He will return to Stan
ford in probably about two months.
During his absence, his family will
remain at their home on the campus.
Professor Jerome B. Landfield will
complete Professor Krehbiel's lecture
course in Modern and European His
tory this quarter. Professor Land
field is well known in San Francisco
as a lecturer and writer of European
politics. He was formerly an instruc
tor in Modern and European History
at the University of California. Later,
he spent several years as a traveler
and student in Russia and the Balkan
states. He delivered an address here
the first of the month on the Russian
Revolution, in which lie outlined the
faults of the former and present gov
ernments of Russia.
