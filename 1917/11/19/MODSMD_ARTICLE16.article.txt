# FIVE DAYS TO GO
## 
### 
We are now on the last week of preparation for the Big Game. The
Varsity has played its last preliminary game, the Freshmen have the bon
fire well under way, and the campus is beginning to talk, think, and act
in terms of Santa Clara and football.
Cardinal supporters have every reason to be proud of the way the Var
sity played in the game against the Olympic Club last Saturday. Practical
ly every man 011 the equad got into the game and the different combina
tions looked good for the greater part of the time. The team that will start
the game will not be picked until later in the week and until that time
the men will all be on their toes in a last effort to lie on the list. Al
though there are 110 games scheduled for this week the squad will be on
the field every afternoon. A little support from the bleachers would be a lot
of encouragement to the players during the practice period.
Preparations are practically completed for Thursday night's rally. The
whole student body will have to be there to fill the Assembly Hall, and
there is 110 excuse why the hall should not be filled not only with people
but also with more noise than it ever housed before. No other engage
ments should be considered for the evening. Santa Clara will take the
same evening to rouse pep for the game. We cannot let them over-shadow
us in this event.
There are only five remaining days of preparation. Get behind that
team and make the most of the remaining time.
