### 
Nathaniel S. Thomas, Bishop of Wy
oming, gave two addresses on the cam
pus yesterday; in the morning at the
Memorial Church, and to the members
of Encina Club last night. In his ser
mon, Sunday morning, he delivered a
stirring address which had an especial
appeal to students, emphasizing the
fact that "our destiny, not our origin,
vitally concerns us."
"Cowboy Life in Wyoming" was the
topic chosen for the talk to the gath
ering in Encina llall, last night. lie
reviewed mission work in Wyoming
in a realistic manner and his descrip
tion and portrayal of the work he bad
done in that state were oÂ£ a kind not
to lie easily forgotten.
