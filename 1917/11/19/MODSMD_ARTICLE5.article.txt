# SOCCERITES DOWN FREMONT ELEVEN
## 
### 
With one lone score to the Stanford
| Varsity's credit, ' Camp Fremont's
: picked soccerites went down before
the Cardinal in last Saturday's boot
| ing contest. The soldiers furnished a
! well-rounded soccer pack, made up for
a large part of former stars, in which
three Olympic Club men were in
cluded. Sergeant Connelly, as skipper
of the army aggregation, built up a
speedy team in spite of handicaps in
lack of facilities for practice. The
game, however, lagged somewhat in
the second half.
Captain Roney of the Varsity team
was responsible for the only goal al
lowed in the contest. Another goal
! which was kicked was ruled out on
account of off-side play. The Varsity
showed good form in both defensive
and offensive work.
The Varsity will meet the Camp Fre
mont team in a return game at the
encampment field tomorrow afternoon
at 4 o'clock.
The Varsity in Saturday's game lined
up as follows:
| Goal, Newiand; right forward,
YVidell; left forward, Elliott; right
half, Lifur; center half, Yewell, (Mc-
