# 'CINDERELLA MAN' BRINGS FORTH TALENT
## ACTING IS LIFE-LIKE Harry Buffum, Florence Mason, and L.L. Pickering Do Excellent Work 
### 
"The Cinderella Man" lifted a Stan
ford audience out of an atmosphere
worried with war and mid-semesters
into a fairyland in its up-to-date garb
last Friday evening. Sword and San
dals produced the fairies and Frank L.
Mathieu touched them with his magic
wand and made them flit about the
stage in a very life-like manner. No
doubt it was the magic wand that ef
fected the rapid change from day to
night. It is regretable that it did not
extend its influence to the screechy,
squeaky curtain, and the half-hour in
termissions.
Edward Childs Carpenter's latest
success was a happy change from the
usual type of Stanford productions,
but was not especially suited to cam
pus talent, it is generally felt.
Despite this fact, most of the parts
were well interpreted, and the cast
carried along the spirit of the play.
Harry Buffum, as Primrose, janitor
to the Great She-Bear, was easily the
otar laugh-producer, as well as the
best actor of the evening. lie gave
full comedy value to his role, though
not at the expense of character por
trayal. Primrose held his audience's
sympathy all the time.
Though Buffum has been seen num
erous times before in similar parts,
this in no way detracted from the
success of his characterization. Prim
rose's fear of the Great She-Bear and
his devotion to the Cinderella Man
will go down in the annuals of Stan
ford dramatics as one of the big suc
cesses.
R. G. Whealton was admirably cast
in his part as Walter Nichols, the
noble nonchalant fortune hunter. His
"But work is so vulgar'' was so nat
urally and spontaneously said that it
brought forth a storm of applause.
In the exceedingly difficult part of
Marjorie Caner, Miss Florence .Mason
did some fine work. Her part was
made duobly difficult by the fact that
she was not exactly suited to the type,
and especial credit is due her admir
able acting. She succeeded in making
her longing for romance convincingly
real, and her joy at finding it spon
taneous. That tears will mar a
woman's looks is true, even if it is
only make-up. Miss Mason read her
lines with a skill and charm thai is
hers alone. ,
The grouchy old father of Marjorie
Caner was excellently portrayed by
E. R. Martin. He growled to perfec
tion, and hobbled about the stage in a
fine piece of character work.
L. L. Pickering proved himself a
valuable .addition to Stanford dra
matics. He showed a very keen ap
preciation of his difficult role as the
ICnderella Man. The qualities of
voice and action he used were far
superior lo those generally found on
the amateur stage.
A. D. YVilkie was well suited to his
part as I). Romney Evans, and ae
quitted himself creditably, as did F.
W. Weeks, whose smooth, pink cheeks
were in delightful contrast to his old,
gray hairs. As the musician, Papa
Sewell, Lavoy H. Davis pleased his
audience with a song, while the Great
She-Bear, portrayed by Miss Alyssa
de Hernardi, proved a mirth-provok
ing factor of the play.

ICnderella Man. The qualities of
voice and action he used were far
superior lo those generally found on
the amateur stage.
A. D. YVilkie was well suited to his
part as I). Romney Evans, and ae
quitted himself creditably, as did F.
W. Weeks, whose smooth, pink cheeks
were in delightful contrast to his old,
gray hairs. As the musician, Papa
Sewell, Lavoy H. Davis pleased his
audience with a song, while the Great
She-Bear, portrayed by Miss Alyssa
de Hernardi, proved a mirth-provok
ing factor of the play.
"The Cinderella Man" lifted a Stan
ford audience out of an atmosphere
worried with war and mid-semesters
into a fairyland in its up-to-date garb
last Friday evening. Sword and San
dals produced the fairies and Frank L.
Mathieu touched them with his magic
wand and made them flit about the
stage in a very life-like manner. No
doubt it was the magic wand that ef
fected the rapid change from day to
night. It is regretable that it did not
extend its influence to the screechy,
squeaky curtain, and the half-hour in
termissions.
Edward Childs Carpenter's latest
success was a happy change from the
usual type of Stanford productions,
but was not especially suited to cam
pus talent, it is generally felt.
Despite this fact, most of the parts
were well interpreted, and the cast
carried along the spirit of the play.
Harry Buffum, as Primrose, janitor
to the Great She-Bear, was easily the
otar laugh-producer, as well as the
best actor of the evening. lie gave
full comedy value to his role, though
not at the expense of character por
trayal. Primrose held his audience's
sympathy all the time.
Though Buffum has been seen num
erous times before in similar parts,
this in no way detracted from the
success of his characterization. Prim
rose's fear of the Great She-Bear and
his devotion to the Cinderella Man
will go down in the annuals of Stan
ford dramatics as one of the big suc
cesses.
R. G. Whealton was admirably cast
in his part as Walter Nichols, the
noble nonchalant fortune hunter. His
"But work is so vulgar'' was so nat
urally and spontaneously said that it
brought forth a storm of applause.
In the exceedingly difficult part of
Marjorie Caner, Miss Florence .Mason
did some fine work. Her part was
made duobly difficult by the fact that
she was not exactly suited to the type,
and especial credit is due her admir
able acting. She succeeded in making
her longing for romance convincingly
real, and her joy at finding it spon
taneous. That tears will mar a
woman's looks is true, even if it is
only make-up. Miss Mason read her
lines with a skill and charm thai is
hers alone. ,
The grouchy old father of Marjorie
Caner was excellently portrayed by
E. R. Martin. He growled to perfec
tion, and hobbled about the stage in a
fine piece of character work.
L. L. Pickering proved himself a
valuable .addition to Stanford dra
matics. He showed a very keen ap
preciation of his difficult role as the
ICnderella Man. The qualities of
voice and action he used were far
superior lo those generally found on
the amateur stage.
