# Cardinal Freshmen Light Santa Clara Babes Rally Fire
## 
### 
Santa Clara's bonfire and campus
fell victims to three Stanford fresh
men last night, when the Mission pyre
was lighted and L. S. J. U was painted
on fences, posts, houses, and every
thing in general at the University
down the bay.
The three first-year men left the
campus about 10 o'clock last night,
and arrived in Santa Clara at 11. Af
ter crawling past the guards sur
rounding the fire and buildings around
the University, they got busy. Before
lighting the fire they painted every
thing which had not received a dose
on the first raid.
When the artist work was com
pleted, most of the Santa Clara men
were in bed, due to the fact that it
was about 3 in the morning. Taking
advantage of this, the Freshmen
touched off the lire, and before ade
quate fighting apparatus had arrived
on the scene, Santa Clara's pyre was
burning strongly.
The three "heroes," after starting
the fire, were forced to walk back to
Stanford, since they went down in a
jitney-bus. Coming after the success
ful raid of the Mission institution last
week Sunday's escapade puts the
Santa Clarites completely out of the
running so far as rallies are con
cerned.
