## MANUSCRIPT DELAYED Presentation of Cohen Comedy Abandoned Until Spring Quarter 
### 
Meeting adverse conditions from
all quarters, first in obtaining per
mission to present the play, and then
in procuring the manuscripts, the
1920 play committee yesterday aban
doned its plans for producing "It
Pays to Advertise" as the Sophomore
play this quarter. The presentation
of the Cohan comedy is only delayed
and not given up altogether, for ac
cording to plans bring definitely laid
by the committee, "It Pays to Adver
tise" will be shown before the campus
audience early in the spring quarter,
with a complete Sophomore cast. The
actual date of production has not
been definitely decided yet, and will
be selected at such a time that it will
not interfere with the Junior Opera
or other events of Junior week.
When confronted with the issue of
either producing an unfinished, poor
ly rehearsed, amateurish Sophomore
play this quarter or of waiting until
the spring, when a representative
presentation can be given the campus,
the 1920 committee decided upon the
latter course. Circumstances had
seemed to work against the plans from
the very outset, when a long delay
was experienced before the eastern
producing company granted amateur
rights of production to the Stanford
class. After these first difficulties of
obtaining permission to produce the
comedy had been overcome, addition
al troubles presented themselves in
the nonarrival of the manuscripts.
When the first of this \yeek came and
the manuscripts did not, the commit
tee hastened to its decision of not
producing the play this quarter.
