"The biggest thing that the women
students can do in this war is to stick
to their college work, so that they
can develop leadership," said Miss
Burner, national Y. \V. C. A. secre
tary, in a talk before a group of
women in the Women's Club House,
yesterday noon.

cation and leadership of the future
will probably rest on the shoulders

of self, and develop a broader out
look on the world than the limits our
own campus.
