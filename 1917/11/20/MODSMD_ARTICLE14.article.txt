# DOPE PUTS TEAMS EVEN FOR S.C. CONTEST
## HARD TO CHOOSE MEN Mission Scrum Stronger While Cardinal Backfield Is Faster 
### H.G. Swendsen '20 
"Heads you win and tails I lose."
That is about the circumstances in
regard to the football situation. All
the dope as to the victor next Satur
day points but one way. And this is
neither team has the advantage. And
all the dope in regard to the person
nel of tlie Stanford team points one
way. And this is no one knows.
Santa Clara has a good team. Stan
ford has a good team. Santa Clara's
scrum looks better than that of Stan
ford. The Cardinal's backs are going
better than those of the Mission lif
teen. There is the situation.
Comparative scores give the Red
and White a slight advantage, but
such scores must always be taken
with a strong dose of salt, especially
this year. Santa Clara goes into every
game lighting for a large score, ller
rooters demand action all the time
and are not satisfied without a de
cisive defeat. Stanford reaches her
best period just before the big game
and uses her club contests merely as
practice games. This is the trouble
with the comparative scores between
the two fifteens.
As regards the men who will start
against the Saintly Crew, there is only
one man knows, and he won't tell un
til Thursday. Jim Wylie has watched
and coached and pleaded and some
times went stronger, until he has fif
teen men who will fight and fight to
gether. Who these fifteen are the
Stanford coach alone knows. The
fact remains, however, that when the
team is picked they will put up a bat
tle that will do Stanford proud.
At front rank there are Barneson,
Meese, and Betts. Select the two by
lot and there is as much chance of
picking the two men who will start as
there is at present. Lock will prob
ably be taken care of by Swarts, with
Williamson fighting hard. There all
semblance of a scrum ends. Certain
ly Captain Pettingill will be in, prob
ably at rear rank, but at which side is
uncertain. Wylie has Campbell, Flood,
Schwarzenbek Righter, Adams, Keg
ley and possibly two or three other
men for three places. Who will go in
is uncertain.
In the backfleld, old man dope can
settle down somewhat. At half there
is Ilaiiser and Doe, both fast, hard
players. At first five there is little
doubt about Lilly, while Chandler at
second five seems certain. Heron and
Morse are still fighting for center
three, while Templeton lias the full
back job of course. Who will start at
wings is another question. Seely is
tackling better than any man on the
team at present. Falk is a fast man.
Reynolds is a star, while Les Wark is
a veteran. From these four men two
must be selected, and this is no easy
task in itself.
Coach Wylie put his men through a
hard practice this morning, but for the
remainder of the week light workouts
will probably be on the boards. The
team will be announced probably
Thursday, and after a little running
around Friday the men will be ready
for the battle Saturday.

lot and there is as much chance of
picking the two men who will start as
there is at present. Lock will prob
ably be taken care of by Swarts, with
Williamson fighting hard. There all
semblance of a scrum ends. Certain
ly Captain Pettingill will be in, prob
ably at rear rank, but at which side is
uncertain. Wylie has Campbell, Flood,
Schwarzenbek Righter, Adams, Keg
ley and possibly two or three other
men for three places. Who will go in
is uncertain.
In the backfleld, old man dope can
settle down somewhat. At half there
is Ilaiiser and Doe, both fast, hard
players. At first five there is little
doubt about Lilly, while Chandler at
second five seems certain. Heron and
Morse are still fighting for center
three, while Templeton lias the full
back job of course. Who will start at
wings is another question. Seely is
tackling better than any man on the
team at present. Falk is a fast man.
Reynolds is a star, while Les Wark is
a veteran. From these four men two
must be selected, and this is no easy
task in itself.
Coach Wylie put his men through a
hard practice this morning, but for the
remainder of the week light workouts
will probably be on the boards. The
team will be announced probably
Thursday, and after a little running
around Friday the men will be ready
for the battle Saturday.
"Heads you win and tails I lose."
That is about the circumstances in
regard to the football situation. All
the dope as to the victor next Satur
day points but one way. And this is
neither team has the advantage. And
all the dope in regard to the person
nel of tlie Stanford team points one
way. And this is no one knows.
Santa Clara has a good team. Stan
ford has a good team. Santa Clara's
scrum looks better than that of Stan
ford. The Cardinal's backs are going
better than those of the Mission lif
teen. There is the situation.
Comparative scores give the Red
and White a slight advantage, but
such scores must always be taken
with a strong dose of salt, especially
this year. Santa Clara goes into every
game lighting for a large score, ller
rooters demand action all the time
and are not satisfied without a de
cisive defeat. Stanford reaches her
best period just before the big game
and uses her club contests merely as
practice games. This is the trouble
with the comparative scores between
the two fifteens.
As regards the men who will start
against the Saintly Crew, there is only
one man knows, and he won't tell un
til Thursday. Jim Wylie has watched
and coached and pleaded and some
times went stronger, until he has fif
teen men who will fight and fight to
gether. Who these fifteen are the
Stanford coach alone knows. The
fact remains, however, that when the
team is picked they will put up a bat
tle that will do Stanford proud.
At front rank there are Barneson,
Meese, and Betts. Select the two by
lot and there is as much chance of
picking the two men who will start as
there is at present. Lock will prob
ably be taken care of by Swarts, with
Williamson fighting hard. There all
semblance of a scrum ends. Certain
