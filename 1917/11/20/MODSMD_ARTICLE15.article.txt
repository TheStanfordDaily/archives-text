# Cardinal Soccer Men to Meet U.C. Booters Saturday
## 
### 
Stanford varsity soccerites meet the
speedy pack from the University of
California in the first of the intercol
legiate soccer games next Saturday
morning on the local soccer field. The
game will be called promptly at 10:30,
and bleachers are to be carried over
to the field so that an admission of
twenty-five cents will be charged.
Under tbe leadership of Captain L.
H. Nuland the Berkeleyites have de
veloped a strong pack. Their team
this season is composed largely of vet
erans. Stanford's varsity, however,
through handicapped lack of time and
the fact that only three veterans are
011 hand, namely Honey, Drury and
Yewell, has shown plenty of speed in
all the preliminary games thus far
and a number of men have been
rounded out by Captain Roney and
Coach Maloney into first-class varsity
material. There is no question but
that Saturday's contest will be a live
one. The varsity journeys to Berkeley
on Thanksgiving day to meet the Hlue
and Gold in a return game.
As an eye-opener to the varsity
contest, a soccer game between two
picked teams from the boys' Saturday
morning classes under Mr. Maloney
will be staged. This tussle will be
called at a. m.
The California representatives will
be the guests of the Cardinal soccer
team for lunch Saturday, and will
probably be treated to the Rugby clas
sic with Santa Clara during the after
noon.
Stanford varsity stages its last prac
tice game this afternoon, when it
meets the Camp Fremont soldiers in
a return game at the encampment.
