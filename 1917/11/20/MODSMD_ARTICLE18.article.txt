As we think over the remaining clays of the present week there are
events and customs which should cause a little thought on the part of stu
dents. Thursday night we will get together for the big rally. The fresh
men have done excellent work 011 their bonfire, and they deserve some
reward for their labors. There are only two more uights left in which to
guard the bonfire. The freshmen who have worked at all have done their
work well. When it comes time for the rally Thursday night (.hey ought to
be excused from guard duty and their places taken by members of the oth
er classes. The freshmen have a right to feel that their labors make the
rally peculiarly their own, and it seems 110 more than proper that every
one of them should be given the opportunity of seeing the whole show.
Friday night Stanford and California meet in their annual debating con
test. The week is filled with footbali, that is true, but the debaters have
worked hard for this contest. It is a student activity, fostered by the stu
dents, and should be supported by the students.
Then Saturday we have that biggest event of the year. A glance over
the applications for seats for the Big Game shows remarkable and alarming
things. Organizations which should have every member at the game show
applications for as low as one third of their membership. The Big Game
should be attended by every student in the University without any excep
tion. Receipts from past contests show that this must have been the case
in former years. We cannot believp that the organization with so small a
proportion of its members contemplating attendance will stop where it is
now. We urge that every organization 011 the campus get busy and make
themselves responsible for the turnout of their entire membership.
