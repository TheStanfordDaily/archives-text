That the food-conservation move
ment has extended to the campus is
shown in the fact that at both the Uni
versity Cafeteria and the Union Cafe,
today was observed as a meatless day,
according to the ideas of the food
commission. Every Tuesday from
now on will be similarly observed,
while Wednesdays will be wheatless
days. Thursdays have been ice cream
less days for the past two weeks.
