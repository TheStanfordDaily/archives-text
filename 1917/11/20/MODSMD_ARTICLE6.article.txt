# Taylor Writes of Albanian "Hike"
## 
### 
Among the interesting tales sent
from the Stanford boys engaged in
war work across the Atlantic, is a bit
of description included in a letter
from Frank J. Taylor, ex-'lB, who is
serving with the Stanford Ambulance
unit in the Balkans. At this time of
year, when "hikes" are popular with
(he campus, it may be of interest to
hear of a "hike" in far-off Albania.
Taylor's rambles over the Albanian
terrain is best described by his own
words:
" 'Wully' Wohlford and i had an in
teresting trip day before yesterday,

when we set out early one morning I
for a cross-country hike. We armed
ourselves with revolvers and came
ras, not knowing which we would be
most likely to need, and set out. Af
ter passing the tall Senegalese guards
outside the town, we left the main
highway and plunged into cross-'
country territory.
"The first village we came to was a
tiny deserted affair, with only a few
scared women and children in sight,
and then only their heads sticking
out of doors and windows. The only
I human we could find to talk to was a |
I
j hunchback who knew a little French. J
He said the row of low mud and tile
huts were the homes of people now |
in the fields. A tall tower stood at,
one corner of the place, the relic of j
the days when a Turk overlord domi
nated the district. Another tower
apart from the town square, with
I
j thick walls, was a remnant of a Turk
! prison, we deduced. It had a hole
shot in the bottom.
"So we ambled onward, for new
scenes to conquer with our camera, j
Our second find was a larger village, i
the entrance of which was over a
puddle in which two or three water
buffalo were lazily soaking, nothing
but their noses sticking above the
. water.
"Before we found any other life
than slaving women and a few chil-
J dren we had gone the length of the j
j village. Here we paused when we
heard a shot fired, and a big Albanian J
dressed like a bandit came out from
j behind a building. He was armed |
with a big gun and loads of ammuni- j
tion, and wore the white skirts of a j
natural Albanian. He had white j
stockings, red shoes with a ball on |
each toe, a colored cape, a cruel-'
looking face, bleary eyes, and a little
cap with a feather in itâ€”something
j that you would expect to be made up
into a highlander.
"After trying French on the Alba- j
I nian and some of his companions,!
without success, English was tried, j
and after we were found to be Amer-;
ican our reception was cordial. One
of them had been in America, and the
other has a brother there.
"They scouted around and brought!
out three other Albanians who had;
American affiliations, two having]
lived there, and the other had a
brother in Massachusetts. One was
from Maine, and the other had run an
ice-wagon in Akron, Ohio.
'.'Thus our party was anything but
hostile, and needless to say we had
much more use for our cameras than
for our revolvers. Every man there
said he was going to America as soon
as the end of the war makes travel
possible. We find the same reception
everywhere. I don't know who is go
ing to live in Albania after the war.
"Several times, on the way back,
we spread ourselves on the ground
under shady trees to rest. Every
thing was quiet and calm, and noth
ing seemed to twang of war as long
as we stayed away from the main
highways. It is hard to believe that
I war can be so peaceful, or rather
that you can wander along a few
miles from the front with such safety
| and enjoy so many genuinely pleas-
I ant experiences."
