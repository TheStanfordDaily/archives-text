# VIGILANT BABES GUARD BONFIRE
## 
### 
Sleepless night, and days crammed
with classes and studies, has been the
program of '21 for the past three
days, and until the big Rally Pyre is
lighted Thursday night there will be
little rest for the Frosh.
Since actual work was begun on the
fire last Friday the babes have been
busy gathering boxes and brush to be
used in its construction and guarding
the bleachers, Quad and fire, night and
day. Each auto and pedestrian who
approaches the forbidden ground is
challenged and forced to give a legiti
mate excuse for trespassing. Squads
of men are posted at all roads, and

the guard will be doubled tonight.
Wood is now being secured to com
plete the construction work, and the
finishing touches will probably be
completed by tomorrow.
A complete and efficient time sys
tem has been inaugurated by the com
mittee, and at least forty men will be
kept on duty all day and twice that
number after dark. All men who
have putin work in the last few days
will be given credit for it.
The bonfire committee is planning
something unique in regard to the ob
ject to be placed on the summit of the
Rally fire, but at present will give no
publicity to its plan.
