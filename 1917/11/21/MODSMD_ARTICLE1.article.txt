# R. O. T. C. MEN TO GUARD CAMPUS TONIGHT
## MEET AT GYM AT 7:30 Major Bugge to Post Military Guard System to Protect 1921 Bonfire 
### 
Major Bugge lias requested that all ,
members of the Stanford Unit of the
Reserve Corps who can possibly do so,
will report at Encina Gymnasium at
7:30 this evening. Major Bugge plans
to form companies of those who voun
teer. and to establish military organi
zation in the guarding of the campus :
and freshman, bonfire tonight.
F-reslnnen who are especially as
signed to guard duty this evening will
not be present, but it is expected that j
all others will participate in the mili
tary work. The guard duty under- j
taken will be of great value in the j
military work of the Stanford Corps,
since Major Bugge will personally see
that it is conducted according to the
principles of the Service of Security.
He will be assisted in this by the
commissioned officers of the Corps.
The importance of the work tonight
in the course of training in military
science is especially urged, since the
circumstances surrounding the ex
pected attempt upon the bonfire by
Santa Clara will make vigilance by i
the outpmits and patrols imperative, !
and will afford the only opportunity
of this kind during the year.
