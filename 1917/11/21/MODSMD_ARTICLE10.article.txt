# Melting Pot Yawns for Gold and Silver
## Old Articles to Be Donated to San Francisco Blind Relief Association 
### 
Have you any old metallic articles
in your room?
No billy-goat has been imported to
the campus to consume these, but
'these is a "melting pot" yawning for
them in the oilice of Chaplain Gardner
in tlie vestry of Memorial Church,
i Mr. Gardner does not contemplate
<3
erecting a silver or golden calf, but is
assisting In a drive lo aid the good
work of the San Francisco Associa
' ion for the Blind.
The drive will begin tomorrow
J morning and end the evening before
i Thanksgiving. The association has
asked Stanford residents to assist by
giving old articles that are worthless,
perhaps, to the owner, but that can be
of material benefit to the blind.
The "melting pot" will collect old
silverware, thimbles, vases, table
ware, rings, opera glasses, watches,
and the like.
"full out of drawers and trunks old
pieces of silver and gold to help the
Mind help themselves," is the word
Chaplain Gardner is passing around.
