# ON GUARD
## 
### 
War and athletics have been linked together to a considerable extent
in the current quarter's life of the universities and colleges of the country,
and the relation they should bear to each other has been a much debated
question. On the one hand many of the. eastern universities have given up
football all together or have given up their former pretentious schedules
and resorted to informal contests. On the other hand we have the argu
ment that athletics, because of the invaluable physical training as a war
benefit, should be continued as nearly as possible according to last year's
program. â€¢>.
The hearty cooperation of military and athletic authorities at Stanford
this year has proved advantageous to both activities. The military depart
ment has tried to arrange the drill hours so as to give as many students as
possible the opportunity of participation in football and attending games.
The military corps will drill before the Big Game 011 Saturday afternoon.
Perhaps the most valuable bit of cooperation to the student body and mili
tary department, working to the mutual benefit of both, is the call which
comes from aMjor Bugge that all men in the Reserve Officers' Training
Corps who can possibly do so report for guard duty tonight. If Santa
Clara is going to bake any move to get at that bonfire, obviously tonight
will be the best time. But whether any danger develops or not the fact
that the campus in general and the bonfire in particular will have to be
guarded. While performing this work the military students will get an
opportunity to get a necessary part of their training in a most practical
manner. Major Bugge has had excellent cooperation from the corps in
every stage of the game this year, and with the double advantage to be de
rived we believe that the men will rally to this call. Its suggestion shows
a fine spirit of Stanford patriotism, and we hope te see it carried out in
the same manner.
