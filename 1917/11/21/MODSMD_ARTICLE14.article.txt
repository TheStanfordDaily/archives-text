# Compare Soccer Scores
## 
### 
A comparison of different scores
made against the Olympic's soccer
team by both Stanford and California
is especially interesting in view of the
coming game between the two univer
sities. Last Saturday California took
the Winged-0 men into camp by a
score of 4-2; and Stanford triumphed
over the Olympic Club 5-0. The game
next Saturday should be exceptionally
closely contested, as the opposing
teams stack up fairly even.
