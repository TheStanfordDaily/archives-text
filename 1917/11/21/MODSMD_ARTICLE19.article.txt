### 
That the English universities have
an atmosphere of their own, entirely
collegiate, unique in every respect,
i
I full of ancient traditions and customs,
but wholly different from the life of
an American university, was the gist
of the address deliverel last night at
the Little Theatre by the lit. Rev. Na
thaniel S. Thomas, Missionary Hisliop
of Wyoming.
"Oxford and Cambridge are now de
pleted," concluded Bishop Thomas,
"and such work as is being done in
them must be carried on in a spirit of
sadness. But it may be that out of
this war will come a new ideal of
learning, more earnest, more rever
ential, and less warped by the spirit
of materialism."
