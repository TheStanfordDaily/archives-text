# Frosh Says Sophs Have No Jazz
## 
### 
In the sophomore meeting held this
afternoon at 1 o'clock a few members
of the jazz-loss class straggled into
room 214 in time to hear President
Tauzer's appeal to the little group who
came together to start action and in
ntill a little pep into the members of
the yearling class who consider it un
necessary to come around.
Dues have been slow in coming in,
so far, and according to Treasurer W.
M. Stamp are greatly needed to carry
on the duties that have been proposed.
