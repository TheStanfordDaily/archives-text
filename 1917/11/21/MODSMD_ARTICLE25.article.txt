# Varsity Men Will Attend Big Jubilee
## 
### 
The football varsity will give up a
banquet in San Francisco in order to
attend the Football Jubilee Saturday
night for the benefit of the Associated
Students.
With the stars of the Big Game on
hand, the cabaret dance promises to
be a real football celebration. And all
records for eating will go when the
men break training on the delicious
refreshments promised by Ram's
Head. Each house and club on the
campus has promised to furnish a
cake for the occasion.
In order to satisfy the clamor of the
campus, the price of Jubilee tickets
is announced at $1.50 per couple plus
15 cents war tax. There will be 110
other charges.
The gymnasium floor will be in the
best of shape, and those who have
complained of the lack of smoothness
are promised the limit of non-friction.
