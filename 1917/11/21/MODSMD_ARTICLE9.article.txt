### 
Coach Wylie will announce the men
who will battle for the Cardinal
against the Red and White Saturday,

on the varsity turf tomor
row afternoon at 4:30. The
announcement by Stanford's
"man at the helm" will con
clude a light for positions
that has been the hardest
and closest of many years.
The fifteen men who are
finally chosen will represent
the best the University has
to offer her rival and will be
prepared to fight the Mission
men to the finish.
Some eleventh-hour shifts,
and possibly complete
changes, are expected from
Coach Wylie. There has been
no consistent team playing
together at all during the
lust few weeks of practice,
and dopesters are at a loss
to judge the team.
The Stanford varsity as it

the field promptly at 4:30.
Yell Leader Luhrs and his
assistants, Antrim and Dor
on, will be on hand to fur
nish tlie crowd an opportuni
ty to give final encourage
ment to -the team. A large

number of fans is expected from the
fact that there is so much uncertain
ty in regard to the personnel of the
varsity.
Coach Von Monderscheid is slated
to choose his team Thursday. The
men who start in the Big Game for
the Mission team are fairly well out
lined at present, although the back
field is still uncertain. The one big
difficulty seems to be at fullback, and
"Von" is studying hard for the best
man in that position.
Following the announcement of the
team tomorrow, there will be a light
workout for the team, and after a lit
tle running around on the field Fri
day the team will be ready for the big
mixup Saturday.
