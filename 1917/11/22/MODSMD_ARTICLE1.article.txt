# BIG PEP REVIVAL OF YEAR DUE TONIGHT
## BONFIRE NOW READY Well Known Rally Speakers Are Lined Up by Yell Leader, G.E. Luhrs, '18 
### 
In order to allow room for the
crowds around the freshman bon
fire tonight Farm Superintendent
Hewston has issued instructions as
to the parking of automobiles. The
serpentine from the Assembly Hall
will pass around the Quad and
down Alvarado row to the fire. For
this reason no cars will be allowed
on the north or south side of this
road near the freshman pyre. Also
the roads along which the parade
passes from the Quad must be kept
open when the students start their
march.

Tonight promptly at 7:30 red fire is
due to blaze up along the entire
length of the Row, and also in the di
rection of Encina, when rooters pour
forth and wend their way to the As
sembly Hall led by cow bells, tin pans,
drums, and noise-making devices of
every sort.
Each and every rooter must secure
a ticket of admission to the hall from
the Registrar's office during the day.
The office will be kept'open until 5
for distributing the pasteboards. The
balcony is reserved for the women of
the University, who are requested to
be in their seats when the crowd of
leather-lunged rooters pours in.
When the crowd has entered the
hall, the team will file in led by Coach
Wylie and will sit in the first two
rows, which will be reserved for them.
Yell Leader George Lulirs, '18, has
lined up rally speakers who will keep
the rooters standing in seats rather
than sitting. Chris Bradley, '99, is
well known on the campus as a
speaker and will probably lead off the
speechmaking of the evening. Leland
W. Cutler, president of the Stanford
Alumni Association, will follow. J. F.
English, '00, and R. W. Harrett, '01,
will conclude the list of visiting
speakers. Daddy Marx will preside.
Coach Jim Wylie will then speak
and will attempt to tell what he thinks
of Cardinal chances of victory. Fol
lowing this the yell leaders will lead
the serpentine through the inner
Quad as the class of 1921 touch off
the bonfire erected by them.
