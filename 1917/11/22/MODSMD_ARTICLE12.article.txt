# CONGRATULATIONS, VARSITY

### 
Tonight we will see just liow much uncorked jazz there is stowed away
in the lungs of the Stanford supporters. A small proportion of them have
already come through with part of the supply, but there is enough left toi
two more organized occasions. Tonight we know who will stait the game
for Stanford. We will see the coach, captain, players, and some well
known speakers. The array ought to be sufficient to do the lubrication for
about 2,000 lusty throats.
Dignity is a virtue on certain occasions. It is a virtue when its possessor
knows when to hold it and when to forget it. Tonight is certainly one of
the times when it should be forgotten. If some fellows who think they are
not acting right unless dignified will go down there tonight we guarantee
they will get over the idea before they have been there long, and won't re
gret it at that.
To the team we want to express our hearty congratulations. The choice
lias been made on merit alonÂ§. Whenthey get out there on the field Satur
day afternoon they will give the Cardinal the best they have. Ihe game
will be a hard one. We can depend on that. But regardless of the outcome,
and at present we can see nothing but a Stanford victory, we have the con
fidence that the men named both in the original lineup and the substitutes
are willing to give every ounce of strength and every grain of football
jsense for Stanford.
