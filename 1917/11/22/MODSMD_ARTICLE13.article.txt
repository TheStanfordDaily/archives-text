# Union to Hold Open House for Alumni
## 
### 
As a result of action taken by the
executive committee of the board of
directors of the Stanford Union the
clubhouse will hold open house both
Saturday and Sunday for alumni who
return to the farm for the big name.
Every effort will be made by the Union
management to insure entertainment
for all alumni.
In order to carry out this plan an
appeal has been made to all members
to be at the Uniop as much as possi
ble and show the alumni around. A
program committee has been appoint
ed, but they cannot take care of all
entertainment.
