# Pete Flannagan Picks S.C. Winner
## Olympic Club Captain Picks Red and White As Better Fifteen 
### Flanagan Captain of the Olympics 
I am writing you my opinion ,as re
quested, to the chances of both teams
on Saturday's Big Game. As a player
who has competed against both teams,
and refereed some of Santa Clara's
games, I have watched both teams
keenly and am of the opinion that this
year's game is going to be very close
hnd one that ought to give the fans
many thrills of real football. As re
gards the outcome of the game, I
think that Santa Clara will just about
win, for 1 think that they have the
shade in the forward division, in ex
perience and weight. The back di
visions of both teams are about equal
—when 1 say equal I mean as a col
lective back team —but I think as indi
vidual players Santa Clara has the
stars, namely Diaz, Scholtz, Lebou
vcau. With good weather it should
be a great game.
