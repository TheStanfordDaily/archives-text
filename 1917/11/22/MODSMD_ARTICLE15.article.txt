# OPEN UP PLAY IS LARKIN'S ADVICE
## 
### "Bud" Larkin 
The club games serve as no com
parison between Santa Clara and
Stanford. Fellows on the club teams
are in business, and Saturday night is
for their freedom as well as rising
late Sunday mornings. This lack of
sleep and ioggyness makes the condi
tion pretty poor on Sunday. Then
there is an atmosphere at Stanford
that makes a fellow want to play good
Rugby. The Olympic Club played 50
per cent better Rugby at Stanford
than at Santa Clara.
In the backfield I give Stanford a
decidcd advantage. They are better
on offense than Santa Clara, but their
main strength lies in their defense. It
is comparatively easy to break through
Santa Clara's backfield, but the ground
meets one hard if he tries to get
through Stanford's. Scholz and
Leßourveau are great men on the of
fense. Especially will Scholz have to
be watched. He runs well and is an
awful hard man to tackle.
Among the forwards it is hard to
say that Stanford's hard-hitting'' for
wards are not the best, but in Rugby
experience talks, so Santa Clara must
be given the choice. Stanford's for
wards are harder to play against than
Santa Clara's, but Santa Clara's
strength lies in the ability of the for
wards to be in the right place at the
right time. This can be learned only
from experience. Santa Clara's for
wards are responsible for their line
having not been crossed, because of
their always backing tip the backfield.
1 hope to see Stanford open up the
game and go down the field with
rushes in which every man will han
dle the ball unselfishly. If they will
do this they are capable of beating
Santa Clara at her own game.
