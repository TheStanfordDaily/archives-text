# Maloney States Stanford Prospects
## Athletic Man Says Stanford Will Win Saturday's Rugby Game With Santa Clara 
### H. Wilfred Maloney 
Here we are again on the eve of the
big Rugby game. The usual dope
sheets are in the air and the season's
scores are being gone over, serving as
an aid in helping the Rugby prophets
to decide who will be the winner of
the coming blue-ribbon Rugby game
for the year 1917.
Let us pass over the condition for
a few moments and run quickly over
the present Rugby season. First of
all, college did not open until October
Ist, which means that the Rugby sea
son has been a matter of six weeks.
Hut four veterans answered the roll
call at the first practice, the rest of
the Rugby material, or 90 per cent of
it, as far as Rugby was concerned was
jas green as the map of Ireland. The
j outlook was anything but promising.
I Anyone who witnessed the freshman
game with Santa Clara, also the var
sity in action last Saturday, feels that
something phenomenal has occurred
in Rugby circles at Stanford. This
has been due to two causes, first, the
unusual type of man that Stanford has
guiding the destinies of her Rugby
teams this season, namely, Coach Wy
| lie, a past master of the Rugby game
and a man so well versed in every de
partment of the game that his playing
"jcomes by instinct or intuition. In fact
he has developed a machine. 1 said
machine and I say this advisedly, for
such is the Stanford Rugby team at

j balanced team developed from prac
; tically nothing, a team that boasts no
stars, few veterans, and not even any
opportunists, still fifteen distinct indi-
I viduals working in almost perfect uni
son, a team that is strong both in at
j tack and defense, a backfield. though
; somewhat light, swift of foot, averag
ing probably twelve seconds. The for
wards combine well and are adepts at
dribbling, being able to keep the ball
at their toes when going through on
' a dribbling rush and not several feet
: ahead of them. Dink Templeton has
11 developed the art of tackling to a
! nicety, and we all feel tliat he will
j give his usual exhibition of touch
' finding and goal kicking, which is say
j ing a great deal.
The second reason why the writer
thinks that we are due for a victory is
the unusual healthy spirit that has
manifested itself this year, both with
the players on the field and the stu
dent body in general. This is the age
of organization and teamwork, with
out which we can accomplish but lit
tle.
What about Santa Clara? Coach
Charlie Austin and his successor,
Coach Von Monderschied, with untir
ing zeal and energy have succeeded in
rounding out a good Rugby team. Not
the well-balanced team of last season,
but a team that consists of individu
alists or opportunists, men who by
their experience are able to foresee,
make and take advantage of openings
in their opponents' defense, and it is
hard to keep such players from scor
ing.
What about the proviso spoken of
at the beginning of this article? It is
simply this: If the backs follow the
passes, as already mentioned; if
the team starts out from the first
crack of the whistle at top speed*and
keeps it up until the last blast of the
whistle, and the men in the bleachers
do their duty, they will be fully re
warded for their efforts by being priv
ileged to serpentine on Stanford's
green field.

What about Santa Clara? Coach
Charlie Austin and his successor,
Coach Von Monderschied, with untir

rounding out a good Rugby team. Not
the well-balanced team of last season,

alists or opportunists, men who by
their experience are able to foresee,
make and take advantage of openings
in their opponents' defense, and it is
hard to keep such players from scor

at the beginning of this article? It is
simply this: If the backs follow the
passes, as already mentioned; if
the team starts out from the first
crack of the whistle at top speed*and
keeps it up until the last blast of the
whistle, and the men in the bleachers
do their duty, they will be fully re

scores are being gone over, serving as
an aid in helping the Rugby prophets
to decide who will be the winner of
the coming blue-ribbon Rugby game
for the year 1917.

a few moments and run quickly over
the present Rugby season. First of
all, college did not open until October
