# Wilson Praises Wylie's Coaching
## 
### Russel Wilson 
1 have been much interested in
watching the Cardinal Ruggers during
the past few days as they have been
going through their last practices be-

their workouts, those things have
stood out â€”the careful attention to and
drilling in every detail of play by
Coach Wylie; the splendid physical
condition of the men; the spirit of
harmony within the squad; the fact
that there are two or more capable

tore the Santa Clara game.
Having never been in close touch
with the game of Rugby, there are
naturally many of the fiue points of
the game with which T am not famil
iar, but as I have watched the men in

men for almost every position; the de
termination of the men.
These are some of the factors which,
with every man of the team fighting
his hardest and every supporter doing
liis duty, will give Stanford the victory
in Saturday's game.
