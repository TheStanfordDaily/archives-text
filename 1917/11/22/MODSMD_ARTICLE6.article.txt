# Fighting Chance for Cardinals Is Carroll's Opinion
## 
### Danny Carroll 
The outlook for the Big Game this
year appears to nie to be very similar
to that which presented itself a few
days prior to the 1913 game with Cali
fornia, when Charlie Austin, "Pretty"
Lachmund and the writer were play
ing as freshmen on our first varsity—
Stanford has a fighting chance. Most
of the 1912 varsity men had graduated
at Stanford, while at California prac
tically the whole preceding varsity
registered for the 1913 game.
The San Francisco press and public
made California favorite, but the Car
dinal was victorious by 13-S on Stan
ford field.
There are on the Santa Clara team
five men who 1 do not think can be
duplicated (as a group) on the farm
this year. They form a line nucleus
for the Red and White varsity.
On the other hand Stanford has
some individual players who are as
good as, and perhaps better than, any
one in their positions on the opposing
team. It may be that their superiority
will offset Santa Clara's advantage in
veterans.
Captain Pettingill will be a tower of
strength where he will be most need
ed—in the forward division.
Playing, as lie always plays, strenu
ously and unselfishly, he will not be
second to any forward on the field—
no matter how brilliantly wing for
wards or siderankers perform.
If the Cardinal forwards hold their
u« 7 u I believe we will w.u. It can
nearly be stated axiomatically that a
team which is beaten forward is
beaten all the way through. Superior
forwards with inferior backs will win
nine times out of ten against inferior
forwards and superior backs. Bril
liant backs will occasionally pull a
game out of the fire —but only very
rarely.
I do not think the results of the
Olympic Cluy games with both varsi
ties can be taken as an absolute crite
rion. We have scored more readily at
Stanford, but the teams which came to
the "farm" were stronger than those
which played at Santa Clara.
The outstanding feature of the last
two games at Stanford has been the
spirit with which the Cardinal fought
a very powerful club side. After all,
this is what we want. It is this spirit
which causes the track man to make a
final effort at sprinting when he is
"all in" —and it is this spirit which
wins football games.
The Stanford varsity will go into
the game remembering, of course,
that the game, its improvement, and
its associations are worth more than
the actual result of this particular
contest, but at the same time it will
face Santa Clara, as every previous
varsity has gone into a Big Game,
feeling that it does not matter what
happens to its members individually—
there are plenty of players on the
sidelines —so long as the Cardinal is
victorious. Fortified with this Stan
ford spirit, the team has a good fight
ing chance.

victorious. Fortified with this Stan
ford spirit, the team has a good fight
ing chance.
The outlook for the Big Game this
year appears to nie to be very similar
to that which presented itself a few
days prior to the 1913 game with Cali
fornia, when Charlie Austin, "Pretty"
Lachmund and the writer were play
ing as freshmen on our first varsity—
Stanford has a fighting chance. Most
of the 1912 varsity men had graduated
at Stanford, while at California prac
tically the whole preceding varsity
registered for the 1913 game.
The San Francisco press and public
made California favorite, but the Car
dinal was victorious by 13-S on Stan
ford field.
There are on the Santa Clara team
five men who 1 do not think can be
duplicated (as a group) on the farm
this year. They form a line nucleus
for the Red and White varsity.
On the other hand Stanford has
some individual players who are as
good as, and perhaps better than, any
one in their positions on the opposing
team. It may be that their superiority
will offset Santa Clara's advantage in
veterans.
Captain Pettingill will be a tower of
strength where he will be most need
ed—in the forward division.
Playing, as lie always plays, strenu
ously and unselfishly, he will not be
second to any forward on the field—
no matter how brilliantly wing for
wards or siderankers perform.
If the Cardinal forwards hold their
u« 7 u I believe we will w.u. It can
nearly be stated axiomatically that a
team which is beaten forward is
beaten all the way through. Superior
forwards with inferior backs will win
nine times out of ten against inferior
forwards and superior backs. Bril
liant backs will occasionally pull a
game out of the fire —but only very
rarely.
I do not think the results of the
Olympic Cluy games with both varsi
ties can be taken as an absolute crite
rion. We have scored more readily at
Stanford, but the teams which came to
the "farm" were stronger than those
which played at Santa Clara.
The outstanding feature of the last
two games at Stanford has been the
spirit with which the Cardinal fought
a very powerful club side. After all,
this is what we want. It is this spirit
which causes the track man to make a
final effort at sprinting when he is
"all in" —and it is this spirit which
wins football games.
The Stanford varsity will go into
the game remembering, of course,
that the game, its improvement, and
its associations are worth more than
the actual result of this particular
contest, but at the same time it will
face Santa Clara, as every previous
varsity has gone into a Big Game,
feeling that it does not matter what
happens to its members individually—
there are plenty of players on the
sidelines —so long as the Cardinal is
victorious. Fortified with this Stan
ford spirit, the team has a good fight
ing chance.
