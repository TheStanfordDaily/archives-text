# Fighting Chance for Cardinals Is Carroll's Opinion
## 
### Danny Carroll 
The outlook for the Big Game this
year appears to nie to be very similar
to that which presented itself a few
days prior to the 1913 game with Cali
fornia, when Charlie Austin, "Pretty"
Lachmund and the writer were play
ing as freshmen on our first varsity—
Stanford has a fighting chance. Most
of the 1912 varsity men had graduated
at Stanford, while at California prac
tically the whole preceding varsity
registered for the 1913 game.
The San Francisco press and public
made California favorite, but the Car
dinal was victorious by 13-S on Stan
ford field.
There are on the Santa Clara team
five men who 1 do not think can be
duplicated (as a group) on the farm
this year. They form a line nucleus
for the Red and White varsity.
On the other hand Stanford has
some individual players who are as
good as, and perhaps better than, any
one in their positions on the opposing
team. It may be that their superiority
will offset Santa Clara's advantage in
veterans.
Captain Pettingill will be a tower of
strength where he will be most need
ed—in the forward division.
Playing, as lie always plays, strenu
ously and unselfishly, he will not be
second to any forward on the field—
no matter how brilliantly wing for
wards or siderankers perform.
If the Cardinal forwards hold their
u« 7 u I believe we will w.u. It can
nearly be stated axiomatically that a
team which is beaten forward is
beaten all the way through. Superior
forwards with inferior backs will win
