# Team Announced for Soccer Game
## 
### 
Stanford's big soccer game of the
year comes Saturday morning, when
the University of California soccerites
journey down from up-bay to meet the
varsity in their first intercollegiate
contest. The game will be called
promptly at 10:30 a. m. on the local
soccer field, in back of the Rugby
turf. Bleachers will be set up, and an
admission of 25 cents will be charged.
A return game is scheduled for
Thanksgiving day at California.
Coach Harry Maloney this morning
announced the lineup of men who
will represent the Cardinal. In Mew
land, Stanford has an efficient keeper
at the net. who may be expected to do
his share in keeping the ball out of
Stanford's goal. Yewell, Drury and
Captain Honey played in last year's
varsity, and will be the mainstays of
the team. Men who are making their
debut in an intercollegiate game are
Elliott, Widell, Lifur, Pillsbury, Say,
Esgen, and Wing, but these men have
shown up well in the preliminary sea
son games, and they may he expected
to produce the fighting spirit in Satur
day's contest.
California is sending down a team
composed largely of veterans under
the censorship of L. H. Huland. Com
parative scores in the practice games,
however, indicate that the Stanford
varsity lias an even break with the
Berkeley representatives.
The California team will be the
guests of the Cardinal varsity at
lunch Saturday noon, and will be
treated to the hig game with Santa
Clara during the afternoon.
