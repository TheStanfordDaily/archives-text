# STANFORD SPIRIT FLARES FORTH AT RALLY
## APPLAUSE FOR WYLIE Assembly Hall Kept in Uproar by Six Actual Dyed-in-Wool Orators 
### 
Six actual dyed-in-the-wool orators,
aided and abetted by three yell lead
ers, kept a packed Assembly Hall in
a continuous uproar for the best part
of an hour at the annual bonfire rally
last night. Shortly before 7:30 the
annual parades down the Row and
from Encina started to the Assembly
Hall, where the clans met and filed in
together; then putting the seats there
to a use other than that for which
they were built.
Stanford Spirit Alive.
Such a rally as the one last night
lias not been seen on the Stanford
campus for many a moon, the ones of
previous years not holding a candle
to it. It' the result of the game Satur
day could be prophesied from the
amount of noise raised last night San
ta Clara has a terrible defeat coming.
As Coach Jim Wylie expressed it.
"Stanford Spirit was a long ways
from dead."
Cutler Starts It.
Lcland W. Cutler, '06, president of
the Stanford Alumni Association, was
the first speaker of the evening, and
he emphasized the fact that Stanford
was coming through in this critical
year in a way that they never have be
for, and said that he expected the
Stanford fifteen would come through
the same way in the cohtest Saturday.
Bradley Follows.
Chris Bradley, '99, followed Cutler
and said that it was up to the Stanford
students to light to the last ditch be
hind the team Saturday. His advice
to the team was to "finish the game
with the same spirit, set jaws, and de
termination, and to dig as Stanford
men always have." He concluded his
remarks with the terse words, "Cut
deeper, fight harder, and student body,
you follow suit."
Coach Jim Wylie was the next
speaker, and pandemonium reighned
for five minutes when he took the plat
form. Wylie thanked the second team
men for sticking out through the sea
son and affording competition which
made the varsity possible. As to the
game Saturday. Wylie's words were,
"We're going to win." Captain Pettin
gill and Graduate Manager Mauser,
speaking for the varsity, said that
they hope to, and thought they could,
bring home the bacon Saturday.
Frank English, '01, was the con
cluding speaker of the evening, and
after wandering around through vari
ous topics wound up by expressing
| his opinion that the good old Stan
ford Spirit would return the Cardinal
varsity a winner.
Following this, led by the yell lead
ers and the Stanford Band, the rooters
I serpentined through the Inner Quad
|to the huge bonfire erected by the
[freshmen which was touched off and
the flames at once jumped to the top
'and cremated the Santa Clara spirit.
I After serpentining around the hot
pyre, "Hail, Stanford, Hail" wound up
the evening's rally.

previous years not holding a candle
to it. It' the result of the game Satur
day could be prophesied from the
amount of noise raised last night San
ta Clara has a terrible defeat coming.
As Coach Jim Wylie expressed it.
"Stanford Spirit was a long ways
from dead."
Cutler Starts It.
Lcland W. Cutler, '06, president of
the Stanford Alumni Association, was
the first speaker of the evening, and
he emphasized the fact that Stanford
was coming through in this critical
year in a way that they never have be
for, and said that he expected the
Stanford fifteen would come through
the same way in the cohtest Saturday.
Bradley Follows.
Chris Bradley, '99, followed Cutler
and said that it was up to the Stanford
students to light to the last ditch be
hind the team Saturday. His advice
to the team was to "finish the game
with the same spirit, set jaws, and de
termination, and to dig as Stanford
men always have." He concluded his
remarks with the terse words, "Cut
deeper, fight harder, and student body,
you follow suit."
Coach Jim Wylie was the next
speaker, and pandemonium reighned
for five minutes when he took the plat
form. Wylie thanked the second team
men for sticking out through the sea
son and affording competition which
made the varsity possible. As to the
game Saturday. Wylie's words were,
"We're going to win." Captain Pettin
gill and Graduate Manager Mauser,
speaking for the varsity, said that
they hope to, and thought they could,
bring home the bacon Saturday.
Frank English, '01, was the con
cluding speaker of the evening, and
after wandering around through vari
ous topics wound up by expressing
| his opinion that the good old Stan
ford Spirit would return the Cardinal
varsity a winner.
Following this, led by the yell lead
ers and the Stanford Band, the rooters
I serpentined through the Inner Quad
|to the huge bonfire erected by the
[freshmen which was touched off and
the flames at once jumped to the top
'and cremated the Santa Clara spirit.
I After serpentining around the hot
pyre, "Hail, Stanford, Hail" wound up
the evening's rally.
Six actual dyed-in-the-wool orators,
aided and abetted by three yell lead
ers, kept a packed Assembly Hall in
a continuous uproar for the best part
of an hour at the annual bonfire rally
last night. Shortly before 7:30 the
annual parades down the Row and
from Encina started to the Assembly
Hall, where the clans met and filed in
together; then putting the seats there
to a use other than that for which
they were built.
Stanford Spirit Alive.
Such a rally as the one last night
lias not been seen on the Stanford
campus for many a moon, the ones of
previous years not holding a candle
to it. It' the result of the game Satur
day could be prophesied from the
amount of noise raised last night San
ta Clara has a terrible defeat coming.
