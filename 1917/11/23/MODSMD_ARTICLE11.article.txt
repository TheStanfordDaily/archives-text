# A 						RESIGNATION
## 
### 
Accordington to the faculty regulation regarding the participation of
students on probation in student activities, I am compelled, with today's
issue of The Daily Palo Alto, to retire from the editorship. Scholastic
difficulties have piled up to such an extent as to make this move impera
tive. Although I am forced to lay aside this official connection I shall
continue work on the paper for the remainder of the quarter.
Owing to the fact that there are only fifteen more issues before the
close of the quarter, the Executive committee has decided not to fill the
vacancy by the appointment of a new editor-in-chief, but will leave the
control of the publication to an editing committee who will direct its
affairs through the remaining issues of the quarter. This committee will
consist of N. R. Allen, '18, Ruth Taylor, '19, and myself.
(Signed) Wm, O. Smallv, '18.
