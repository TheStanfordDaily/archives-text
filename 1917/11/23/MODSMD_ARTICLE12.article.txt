# STANFORD'S DAY
## 
### 
The stage is set for the Gig Game. Both teams are through with their
practice, the students have put forth their final preliminarry outbursts and
everything hinges on tomorrow.. Dopesters have been busy for some time
and a comparison of their respective efforts does not expound any definite
theory of the ultimate outcome except that all are agreed it is going to be
a close hard battle.
We are looking for and counting on a Cardinal victory. The fifteen
which takes the field tomorrow is one of the best fighting machines Stan
ford has ever sent against Santa Clara. The brunt of the game depends on
the forwards, for unless they can withstand the attack of the Santa Clara
scrum the backfield cannot do its work. We have the utmost confidence in
them to do their part. Go get 'cm, varsity. We're all with you, and when
the final whistle blows we will rise with uncovered heads and join you in
"Hail, Stanford, Hail."
