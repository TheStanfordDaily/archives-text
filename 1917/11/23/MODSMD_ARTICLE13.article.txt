# FOOTBALL JUBILEE INVITES DANCERS
## 
### 
One thing will be missing from the
Football Jubilee tomorrow. That is dis
appointment. There may have been
some snch thing at former dances, but
The Daily Palo Alto is positively as
sured by Ham's Head that it won't
have even a place at the rough's win
dow position.
The program in full isâ€”the most
jazziest jazz ever jazzed will howl
forth at exactly 8 p. m. In the musi
cians' circle will be Tommy Reynolds
of old-time fame, Jack Kegley, football
pianist, Swede Larsen, and Doug Mc-
Namee. And the best saxies, banjos
and drums to be found south of the
Palace won't be missing either.
Dances will last as long as anyone
wants to dance, and during intermis
sion there will be refreshments that
will refresh. There will be songs,
special music, and some snappy acts
which Ram's Head refuses to divulge
until Saturday night. The cafe will
be known as the Cabaret de Gratis,
since no charge whatever will be made
for this diversion.
The victorious Stanford varsity will
be the guests of honor of the occasion.
Those who lay down their dollar sixtv
five cents will do so on behalf of the
A. S. S. U., and again Ram's Head says
to whisper it, shout it, and shriek it,
that it's going to be the most joyful
benefit ever done on the campus.
