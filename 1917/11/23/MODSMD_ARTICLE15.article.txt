# Orators Meet California in Debate Today
## 
### 
While pre-game spirit is at its ebb
tonight awaiting the big events of the
morrow, the red fires of oratory will
blaze forth in the Assembly Hall,
when the ancient rivals of Stanford
and California engage in their annual
I intercollegiate forensic contest. De
baters do not receive as much credit
in the university world as do the foot
ball men, but their efforts are worthy
of some response, and so a large
crowd is expected to fill the Assembly
'Hall as soon as the doors open at 8
o'clock. No admission fee is being
charged.
Stanford debaters are in a fair line
for a win over their antagonists to
night, being thoroughly conversant in
all angles of the subject, and possess
ing the confidence of experience. G. .1.
Driscoll, '18, Margaret Shcdd, '20, and
W. I. Ames will represent the Cardi
nal on the negative, while Mildred
Little '19, W. U. Griffin, '19, and J. .1.
Posner, '19, will oppose them as de
fenders of the Blue and Gold on the
affirmative.
The subject is of national impor
tance, and one discussed from all an
gles throughout the country: "Re
solved, That in war time the federal
government should employ conscrip
tion of labor to insure the necessary
output of war materials." Each speak
er will talk for seventeen minutes, and
the affirmative will have an eight
minute rebuttal, while five minutes
will be allotted the negative.
