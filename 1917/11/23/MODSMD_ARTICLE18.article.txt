# GAME TO DEPEND ON FORWARD PLAY
## 
### H.G. Swendsen 
Dope has come in one way and an
other, hut still the question of who
will win the big splurge tomorrow is
in the air. One point remains. The
much-touted Stanford Spirit i: going
to play a large-part in this year's final
score. Last year dopes tors said the
same thing over and over. Santa Clara
didn't have any spirit. Stanford was
overflowing with it. The fact remains,

i however, that when the two varsities
I took the field Stanford fought as
though the Big Game was a practice
contest, with the Olympic Club as far
as real fighting spirit was concerned.
Conditions are changed this year,
however. At the beginning of the I!H7
season every writer around the bay
saw only deefta for the Cardinal. Then
the Spirit of Stanford, directed by Jim
AVylie, began to assert itself, and those
gool makers opened their eyes until
now even the most optimistic Santa
Clara man gives the Red and White
only an even break. And as Stanford
teams have fought in the past an even

break before the game means a victory
after the game.
There are several facts which stand
out in regard to this year's team.
Templeton is better than he ever has
been, and cannot be equaled or ap
proached on the Santa Clara varsity.
From pre-game indications bis boot to
touch will average some fifty yards,
while his conversions should average
high.
Probably the success, or a large
part of it, of the Stanford fifteen will
depend on how the Stanford orwards
hold the fighters from down the bay.
Don, the two Muldoons, and Korte, are

experienced heavy men and will give
the Stanford forwards a battle of their
lives. If Righter and Pettingill as a
main barrier, and Adams, Campbell
and Swarts to back them up. can stop
these three men the victory will be for
Stanford. There is little doubt that
Stanford's line of scoring backs can
go over once they get the ball on any
sort of an even break. There is no
backfleld man in tho world who can
make a try, however, if he doesn't get
the ball, and it is for this reason the
Cardinal forwards must battle the
Santa Clara pack to a standstill. All
that is required ip the scrum is an
even break.
