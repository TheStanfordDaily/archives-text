# Teams Are Equal Is Opinion of Bobs
## He Says Game Will Be Close. Fast Game of Football Will Be Seen Here. 
### "Bobs" Chronicle Football Writer 
When I consented to write a short
forecast of the Big Game for the
editor of the D. P. A. I scarcely real
ized how little 1 knew about the
team or my answer would have been
a polite declination. It is several
years since I used to accept this task
annually in a matter-of-fact way. But
in those days 1 was better posted, as I
visited each campus twice every week
of the (raining season, and the assign
ment was accordingly a snap.
But I will attempt to write some
thing that suggests itself to me. I
have seen the Santa Clara men twice
in action—once at the commence
ment of the season and last Sunday
against the Barbarians. In each game
it was a runaway affair for the Mis
sionites. And 1 have seen Stanford
in three games—once against I'alo
Alto Club a month ago and twice re
cently against the Olympic Club. From
my impressions in these contests I
will base the following:
The brand of Rugby played this
year is superior to anything I have
seen in California. Stars do not ap
pear to be as bright as they did in the
days of yore when the .Blue and Gold
and tlie Cardinal staged their annual
set-to, but the real reason for this is
that there are fewer dubs playing on
the teams in these days, and the con
trast is not so great. Any ol the
players left out of the elite fifteen by
the coach in tho final selection would
have been a godsend for Presley a few
years ago. What is the reason lor
this ?
The undergraduates of the "early
teens" learned all their Rugby in col
lege, and sometimes had to unlearn
considerable near-Rugby picked up
from the mouth of near-coaches in
their high school years. But here we
have boys who come to college with
more than an elementary knowledge
of the rudiments, and the present-day
coaches make use of this background
in building up their machine. Fum
bling is a rarety in comparison, and
accurate handling of the ball passes
today without even a thrill.
The Cardinals are "comers," while
their rivals of Santa Clara always
were good, when Austin took them in
hand at the commencement of the sea
son. If 1 wanted to wager on Stan
ford I would expect odds from the
Santa Clara rooters, but at any odds
I would consider it a good bet. Com
mercially speaking, the Santa Clara
outfit seems to have the edge, but for
a short-ender Stanford is a good buy.
One can never tell how fast "com
ers" aro coming, and that is the prob
lem for the dopester to work out to
morrow. The misslonites have many
experienced men in their lineup, and
overconfidence will not check their
progress against Stanford. They
learned this lesson against St. Mary s
in 1911, just as Stanford did with
California in the year 1900.
The Santa Clara pack looks to be
better than that of Stanford, and will
have an appreciable edge in the line
outs from touch. Here the two Mul
doons and Don are a tower of strength.
Pettingill and the new man Righter
will be their closest rivals on the
Stanford team.
In securing the ball for their backs
it looks to be a tossup. Howell, the
best hooker of the four, has been laid
up most of the season, and has scarce
ly had time to perfect teamwork with
Ferrario, while Curtice, who has been
a certainty since the Stanford squad
was organized, has partnered Betts.
the successful candidate, and Barne
son alternately all the year.
Winham looks to be better than Vl
cini, as Wylie has injected quite a lot
of his own football personality into
this man's work. Wylie was a won
der as a breakaway, but what would
he have been as a wing forward? In
impress me as being stronger, and
they carry more weight in the scrum.
the loose the Santa Clara forwards
Will this enable them to help their
hooker to the ball? These points will
probably decide the issue, as the San
ta Clara backs have nothing on Stan
jford behind the scrum, despite the ex
jtra experience.
Speaking of the individuals Temple-
Jton ranks higher than any man on
either team in his own position. He
is one of the greatest fullbacks ever
developed on the Pacific Coast —if not
actually the greatest. And this was
| not the case when the season com
menced. He is still learning, and
would do credit to any "all-star" team
iin the world. Scholz is, to my mind,
the best opportunist of the thirty, and,
given average chances, should carry
the hall over the line.
Chandler has justified Wylie by
making good as an occupant of the
backfield, and Lilly has forgotten
quite a lot of the old game in record
time. Garcia is not as good as he was,
but it may be a different, story against
Stanford. Falk was good when he
first made a place on the freshman
| team at wing, and he is bettor today.
'This baby will surely score if he gets
a respectable chance. Tacklers are
expected to do an ordinary day's work,
but no tackier is expected to chock
under way a Seholz, Chandler, Cota,
or Falk. You might as well attempt
to stop a railroad engine from the out
side. Just one wish —may the best
team win.
