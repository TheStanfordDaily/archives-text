# Captain Diaz Sees Hard Fight in Game
## Santa Clara Man Lauds Clean Sportsmanship of Cardinal in Article. 
### Captain Diaz of Santa Clara 
It is not for me to predict the out
come of Saturday's contest. We'll
leave that to the dopesters. Let then)
win the game or lose it from compara
tive scores of the preliminary season
and all that. All we have to do is to
get out and play for all we are worth;
and then let the best team win.
That the game is going to be one
royal battle, no one who lias seen
either team play thus far has the
slightest doubt. No two teams from
the present outlook have appeared
more evenly matched, on paper at
least, since Stanford fought that O-toO
tie in the mud on the California field.
Personally I would rather win from
Stanford than from any other college
in the country; for she has athletic
traditions equalled by no college in
the east or the west. And if we have
to lose, I would rather lose to Stan
ford than to any other team; for she
plays a good, clean, gentlemanly
game, and is a good sport, clean
through.
