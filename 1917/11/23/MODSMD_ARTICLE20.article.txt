# James Sees Chance in Cardinal Backs
## Examiner Expert Says Forward Advantage of S.C. to Be Offset by Kicking 
### Jack James

"Who will win this game?" I am
frank to say that I don"'l know. There
never has been a Rugby game in
which tlie outcome is so uncertain as
this year's. There is no "dope'' upon
which to compare the teams at all.
Stanford has practically a new team,
while Santa Clara is none to certain a
quantity.
There are a few tilings that stand
out in my mind, however, in regard to
the playing of the men on tlie two
teams. These are: Santa Clara has tlie
better scrum, while Stanford seems
superior in the backtiehl. Also, the
Cardinal is superior in the kicking de
partment.
When it comes to tlie fullback berth
Stanford has something which will off
set the advantage, in all probability,
Santa Clara lias in the forward di
vision. Temple ton looks good for at
least fifty-yard gains on bis kicks to
touch, while his conversions will aver
age high. In addition a field goal
seems certain it "Dink" gets the ball
within the thirty-yard line. This ma>
be only a hunch, but I believe this, one
man is going to mean a lot to Stanford
tomorrow.
In the backfiehl we dopesters have
several opportunities to spread our
selves. One thing stands out, how
ever. The combination of Lilly and
Chandler in.the five-eighths line will
run away from Young and Leberveau.

Young, especially, is not the man to
stop Lilly or get away from liini. This
is where many of the plays are started
and the decided advantage of the Car
dinal may count for a good deal. The
other live-eighths position seems to be
Stanford's also, with Chandler. At
center three Santa Clara has a weak
ness in Cota, but on the wings they
are at an advantage. Garcia and the
veteran Scliolz are both good men and
seem superior to Wark and Falk.
Taken as a whole both varsities
look good. I look for some fast Rng
j by, but on the whole I think neither .
! team can be given the advantage.
