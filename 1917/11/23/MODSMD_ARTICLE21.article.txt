# Hauser Says Fifteen To Excell in Fight
## 
### "Red" Hauser 
Making statements on football
games is a hopeless task at the best,
unless a person is prejudiced, a coach,
a manager, or a player. To the im
partial spectator or Rugby fan, tomor
row's game must be a hard one to at
tempt to pick a winner. However,
every Stanford player and every Stan
lord supporter has that feeling deep
down in his heart that Stanford will
win that game.
We are the underdog this year; we
are handicapped because of the few
experienced men on the team; we are
handicapped because of a shorter
period ol' training. However, these
handicaps will make up fight all the
harder. We have an even, well
valanced team, and are not depending
on one or two stars to win our game.
We are going to win on fight, team
work and the coaching we have had.
We are going to give all we have for
a Stanford victory.
