# Pettingill Looks to Scrum Men For Win
## 
### Captain "Swede" Pettingill 
It, is a fact that superior forwards
will win over a team with poor for
wards and good hacks. And it is upon
this fact that 1 believe Stanford will
jwin. In several instances in the past
Stanford has been given the short end
'of the betting odds because she had
gupposedly inferior forwards. Ihe
'scrum has always come through, how
ever, and won out for the Cardinal,
and I believe they will tomorrow.
Our backfield is fully as good as
those of former years and give further
Teason for expecting a victory.
Santa Clara has greater weight in
the scrum, but we will make up for
I that in light and knowledge of the
I game.
