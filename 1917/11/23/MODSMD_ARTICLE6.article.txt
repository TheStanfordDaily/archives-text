# Victory Depends on Scrum Says Bailey

### B.C. Baily 
Of the San Francisco Bulletin.
After observation of the fifteens of
Santa Clara and Stanford 1 have come
to one conclusion. If Stanford's for
wards can hold those of Santa Clara
the line of scoring backfiekl men on
the Cardinal fifteen will hang up a
victory. This is as far as 1 can say,
however. Whether the forwards will
be able to do Ibis I don't know. There
is plenty of spirit in the men at Stan
ford, but whether this spirit will evi
dence Itself enough to make up for
weight and experience I cannot say.
The Stanford backfleld men are
lightning fast, and in addition play
perfect teamwork. Their one draw
back seems to be a tendency to hang
onto the ball until they are brought
down.
