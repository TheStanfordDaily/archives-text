# COACH JIM WYLIE PROPHESIES WIN TO-MORROW
## GAME WILL BE TIGHT Varsity is in Prime Shape For The Supreme Conflict Of Year. 
### Jim Wylie 
The absence of stars this year makes
the Stanford team look less formida
ble than former teams. Therein lies
our strength, because we are not rely
ing on two or three individual players
to" bring home the bacon." Every one
of the fifteen that takes the field to
morrow knows just what is expected
of him and will do his bit faithfully.
The team is well balanced, having
11 its forward brigade four good ruck
ing forwards and four splendid play
ers in loose and open plays. Their
weight and height is equally divided
in the scrum and should give Santa
Clara a hot time when they come to
gether for a trial of strength. Much
has been published about the game
being a fight between the Stanford
backs and the Santa Clara forwards.
Our forwards have been underesti
mated and their showing tomorrow
will bear out my statement. They will
hold their own with the Santa Clara
veterans.
Coming to our backfield, I think we
have as good a set of backs as has
ever represented the University. Ad
mitting they have many faults, such
as running too much to the sideline
and giving high passes, they combine
well and back each other up so well
in attack and defense that such faults
are permissible at times. They are a
speedy lot and all good tacklers,
which Santa Clara will know to her
sorrow. If they will only play the
game as they have been playing of
ate I feel confident that some thrill
ing trys will be made by them tomor
row.
