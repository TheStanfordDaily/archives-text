G. J. Driscoll. '18, wad the first
speaker upon the negative, and he
presented Stanford's contentions in a
and straightforward fashion. He
pMceen<M to answer the strike argu
ment of the affirmative, by referring
to a recent ruling b> ihe Council of
National Defense, giving one of the
labor hoards compulsory powers to
regulate UU strikes. "Xolliing less

abroad will improve the condition of

the contention rrfstifitftifled by l?ie if
ttrniatiteu Tl;e practical ;Vlniinißtra
tion of the conscription plan was then
thoroughly discussed, by , Dr.iscoll.
W. X. Green, second California
speaker, answered the questions put
by the negative, and told how con
scription, which was. as he said, "lit
tle more than patriotic organization
of labor," was the oniy method that
could effectually transfer labor from
non-esse nial to essential industries.
"There is no question of strikes,
since that has been settled by the
Council of National Defense in Aug
ust of this year," said Miss Margaret
Shedd, 'JO, conclusively answering
one of the strongest arguments pre
sented by the affirmative. Miss
Shedd pointed out because it does
away with the necessary co-operation
between labor and capital. By re
solving the issue into: "Whether we
are to fight Germany with American
weapons or with a made in Germany
plan?" Miss Shedd concluded a very
forecful and impressive speech.
The debate was tending towards the
affirmative, when W. I. Ames, 'IS,
brought the arguments down to sheer
facts once more, and by terse and
concise statements carried the audi
ence back to the negative viewpoint.
"The demand of a people to be free
is superior to all argument 6r elo
quence," concluded Ames, in showing
that conscription was threatening the
free action of the laborers.
Driscoll answered affirmative argu
ments in the live minute rebuttal al
lotted him, and summed up the nega
tive case. Posner occupied his eight
minutes with a little destructive
work, and then presented the conten
tions of the affirmative as they had
been brought out in the debate.

G. J. Driscoll. '18, wad the first
speaker upon the negative, and he
presented Stanford's contentions in a
and straightforward fashion. He
pMceen<M to answer the strike argu
ment of the affirmative, by referring
to a recent ruling b> ihe Council of

labor hoards compulsory powers to
regulate UU strikes. "Xolliing less

W. X. Green, second California
speaker, answered the questions put
by the negative, and told how con
scription, which was. as he said, "lit
tle more than patriotic organization
of labor," was the oniy method that
could effectually transfer labor from
non-esse nial to essential industries.
"There is no question of strikes,
since that has been settled by the
Council of National Defense in Aug
ust of this year," said Miss Margaret
Shedd, 'JO, conclusively answering
one of the strongest arguments pre
sented by the affirmative. Miss
Shedd pointed out because it does
away with the necessary co-operation
between labor and capital. By re
solving the issue into: "Whether we
are to fight Germany with American
weapons or with a made in Germany
plan?" Miss Shedd concluded a very
forecful and impressive speech.
The debate was tending towards the
affirmative, when W. I. Ames, 'IS,
brought the arguments down to sheer
facts once more, and by terse and
concise statements carried the audi
ence back to the negative viewpoint.
"The demand of a people to be free
is superior to all argument 6r elo
quence," concluded Ames, in showing
that conscription was threatening the
free action of the laborers.
Driscoll answered affirmative argu
ments in the live minute rebuttal al
lotted him, and summed up the nega
tive case. Posner occupied his eight
minutes with a little destructive
work, and then presented the conten
tions of the affirmative as they had

that conscription was threatening the

W. X. Green, second California
speaker, answered the questions put
by the negative, and told how con
scription, which was. as he said, "lit
tle more than patriotic organization
of labor," was the oniy method that
could effectually transfer labor from
non-esse nial to essential industries.
"There is no question of strikes,
since that has been settled by the
Council of National Defense in Aug
ust of this year," said Miss Margaret
Shedd, 'JO, conclusively answering
one of the strongest arguments pre
sented by the affirmative. Miss
Shedd pointed out because it does
away with the necessary co-operation
between labor and capital. By re
solving the issue into: "Whether we
are to fight Germany with American
weapons or with a made in Germany
plan?" Miss Shedd concluded a very
forecful and impressive speech.
The debate was tending towards the
affirmative, when W. I. Ames, 'IS,
brought the arguments down to sheer
facts once more, and by terse and
concise statements carried the audi
ence back to the negative viewpoint.
