kicked off. Then after some minutes
of forward play, Lilly broke loose

a scrum, and Templeton gained fifty
yards and put the Varsity within
striking distance again. Lilly got the
Dal 1 again and went past Diaz and
O'Connor for fifty yards, but Angell
finally succeeded in stopping him to
save a try. Santa Clara resorted to
kicking to save her, but Doe marked

twenty-yard-line when the final gun
announced a Cardinal victory.
