# CONGRATULATIONS

Stanford fighting spirit came to the front Saturday in one of the most
magnificent exhibitions of Rugby ever seen on the Pacific coast, and the
inevitable outcome was victory for the Cardinal. Seldom if ever have
football fans been treated to such a full realization of what sheer determ
ination can do on the gridiron than the crowd which filled the bleachers
last Saturday afternoon. From their flashing start but few of the crowd
believed it a human possibility for the Stanford combination to overcome
Santa Clara's eleven-point lead until they really started on that incom
parable drive.

Captain Pettingill and every man who went into the came deserves
the congratulations of Stanford University. It has said of former
Stanford teams that some particular one was better- than any former team
but we cannot refrain from saying that the 101v Varsity had all others de
feated for fighting spirit. Coming to the front as they did from an almost
hopeless outlook at the beginning of the* year, their victory was marvelous.
Nor would it being doing justice to tho other men who were out for football
if we gave the letter-winners all f he credit. Without the right kind of
competition from the second Vprsity and Freshman teams, such a machine
would have been impossible.

In the matter of coaching Stanford also won the honors. To Jim Wylie
we all take off our ha'is. Confident to the last, he prophesied a victory
because he knew his men, knew what they were capable of, and above all,
kne\y Rugby and \ow to teach it. He had every man on his team in con
dition. Every one of them wanted a victory for Jim Wylie as well as for
the University. Xo one envied him his job at the opening of the season
and no one begrudged him the glory of Saturday's victory.

Congratulations are also in order to Captain-elect Templeton of the
1918 Varsity. Templeton has been a mainstay of the Stanford team in
three big games and the reward conies as a merited one. His playing Satur
day needs no rehashing to those who saw him play. We feel confident that
with Templeton at the helm, tlie 1918 Varsity will give an excellent ac
count of itself when next year's Big Game rolls around.
