# Dr. Thomas Delivers His First Sermon
## 
### 
"It is much easier to follow the
crowd," said Dr. Thomas in his final
sermon, delivered in the Memorial
Church yesterday."The University
.student especially has to guard
against this evil as the atmosphere of
a university tends toward mob rule."
Passive indifference is another evil
%
that confronts the student, and can
only he overcome by unselfish en
deavor.
Yesterday's sermon was the last oi
the series of sermons to be delivered
by Dr. Thomas, who is a bishop from
Wyoming.
