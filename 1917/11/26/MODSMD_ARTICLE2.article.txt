to ensure that the normal activiites

of too great a number of troops in
grounds or buildings at any time
would be executed by the military au
thorities.
No other limitations than these
were placed by the University upon
the presence of troops upon the cam
pus. On the contrary, the attitude of
the University authorties has been
thai the soldiers are entitled to and
should receive, in their individual ca
pacity, the same privileges as are ac
corded to any other citizens. It must
be understood that this does not ap
ply to ground leased to outside par- j
ties though owned by the University. I
