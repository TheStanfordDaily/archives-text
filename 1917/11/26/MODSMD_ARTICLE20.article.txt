former years, according to Q;. J.

This is to correct a rumor that has
been circulated to the effect that, pic
tures should be individual. All pic
tures must be taken this quarter, and
any organization failing to do so, will
be left out of the book. It is also an

be accepted by the editor, space in the
Quad must be paid for.
