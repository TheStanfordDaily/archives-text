# PRESIDENT WRITES OF CRISIS PASSED IN RECENT WEEKS
## WAR OUTLOOK IMPROVES Dr. Wilbur Optimistic in Face of Military and Food Troubles 
### 
President Wilbur writes a significant
letter to The Daily Palo Alto, con
cerning his observations of the inter
national situation as it appears at the
national capital. He says:
Situation Yet Critical.
"There has been a deep wave of de
pression passing over the country
lately because of the first wide real
ization of the seriousness of the war.
Although the situation is indeed crit
ical, and the food situation is most dif
ficult, we are now feeling somewhat
relieved and once more hopeful be
cause of the apparent partial failure
of the submarine campaign. Evi
dently, tlie persistent use of the var
ious methods of combatting the sub
marine has had a definite effect. This
is more likely to be the explanation
than that any particular solution has
been found. The depth bomb has ap
parently been effective.
Outlook Is Optimistic.
"If the submarine has been sup
pressed to any degree it clarifies the
war situation materially because it
means that we can bring to bear our
full weight at a much earlier period
than would otherwise be possi'"l»j. We
can see a future victory much more
clearly than we could two weeks ago."
Every line of the above is packed
with a significance that has hardly
been appreciated in the west, and the
last sentence is one that brings a
shock to all who have held the com
placent belief that nothing but vic
tory has been in sight for the Allies.
President Wilbur's words are opti
mistic in tone, and coming from the
center of the nation's war prepara
tion, bring cheer.
President Wilbur concludes that the
turn of the situation, although it has
heen quiet, has been far-reaching and
important.
