# COMMITTEE NAMED TO PLAN TRANSFER OF UNION TITLE
## TO DISCUSS FEASIBILITY Change to Bring Permanency by Making Trustees the Legal Title Holders 
### 
Transfer of the legal title of the
Stanford Union from the hands of the
Union organization itself to the trus
tees of the University is a plan now
contemplated by the Union Board of
Directors. A committe to investigate
the matter has been appointed by the
directors, and consists of W. L. Mil
ler, '17, Student Adviser, and Pro
fessor J. P. Mitchell of the Chemistry
department and chairman of the
Union Board.
The committee will examine every
angle and will thoroughly estimate
the feasibility of the plan; the result
will be presented to members of the
board, who will act upon the matter.
The underlying motive of the plan
is to establish permanency in the
Union, especially in view of the exist
ing conditions with the constant
change transpiring in the University.
If once established, this change in
the possession of the legal title will
in no way affect the management of
the Union, which is by students, fac
ulty and alumni.
An entertainment committee was
appointed by the Board of Directors
during the big game of last wek.
William Gilroy, '17, was named chair
man of this committee, and L. H. Da
vis. '18, and F. W. Weks, '18, were ap
pointed as the two members from the
Union Board on the oemmittee. Two
more men from the Union at large
will be added, and the committee will
be permanent.
