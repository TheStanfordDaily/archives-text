Names once prominent in the student life of tlie University are found
in the list of commissions announced of successful candidates at the sec
ond Reserve Officers' Training Camp which just closed at the Presidio.
These names will he added to the honor roll of Stanford men who have
gone into the service of their country.
While the loss of these men does not vitally affect present conditions
on the campus .their apopinment nevertheless reminds us, with all too
great force, of just what the war is meaning to Stanford. Men registered
for the quarter's work are leaving in almost unbelievable numbers for
military service. Some of them aesumomned by the draft, others have
enlisted before and are just receiving their calls, while others are now
making their first active orave toward joining the colors.
A degree of sentiment necessarily enters such wholesale departures.
Many of these men we have never seen. Others we have merely heard
about, but regardless of what our relations with them have been, there is
the one common tie of Stanford Spirit and traditions which link them to
us. We are sorry to see them go. Sorry because in many cases the sepa
ration will probably be a permanent one, and sorry too, because we are
not with them. They are answering a call which we will all have to heed
eventually. For their determination to make that answer early we have
only admiration. As they go to theirvariaus fields we extend to them the
best wishes of the present Stanford generation.
