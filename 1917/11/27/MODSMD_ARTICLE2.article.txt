day's contest that was matched
a.ai: s-t the Varsity last Saturday, sev
eral changes are to be made in the
Cardinal lineup. The same men will
represent Stanford, but their positions
are to he changed in a number of in
stances. The shifting of Captain
Honey to center half, and of Drury
to center forward, is perhaps the most
drastic alternation that Coach
Maloney will make. Pillsbury will
also move from the half-back line
into the forwards' position.

Berkeleyites last Saturday by . a 2 to
1 count, it was Stanford spirit that

Varsity, when it came to science and
knowledge of the finer points of the
game. But in Thursday's contest, the
Stanford men will have had the ex
perience of one game with California
already, and if they can bring the
fighting spirit into play once more,
they should triumph.

Although California will send the
same team onto the field in Thurs
day's contest that was matched
a.ai: s-t the Varsity last Saturday, sev
eral changes are to be made in the
Cardinal lineup. The same men will
represent Stanford, but their positions
are to he changed in a number of in
stances. The shifting of Captain
Honey to center half, and of Drury
to center forward, is perhaps the most
drastic alternation that Coach
Maloney will make. Pillsbury will
also move from the half-back line
into the forwards' position.
When Stanford snowed under the
Berkeleyites last Saturday by . a 2 to
1 count, it was Stanford spirit that
did it. The Californians showed per
haps a little the edge on the local
Varsity, when it came to science and
knowledge of the finer points of the
game. But in Thursday's contest, the
Stanford men will have had the ex
perience of one game with California
already, and if they can bring the
fighting spirit into play once more,
they should triumph.
The Mrs. Charles G. Lathrop
Memorial Trophy, in memory of her
husband, Mrs. Stanford's brother, is
up for competition in Thursday's
contest. This cup is to be given to
the winner of a majority of ten games
between Stanford and University of
California, two of which must be
played each year. If Stanford comes
home winner Thursday, the winning
of this cup will be nearly assured,
for out of five games played thus far,
1915, Stanford lias won four.
The C. Y. Williamson trophy, which
was formerly up before the two uni
versities, was won outright bv Stan
ford. The Cardinal soccer teams
have an enviable record to their
credit in the past half-decade. Out
of sixteen games with California since
1911, Stanford has won fifteen, and
lost but one.
The lineup for Stanford's Varsity in
Thursday's contest follows:
Xewland, goal; Widell, right back;
Elliott, (Stamp), left back; Lifur,
center half; Yewell, left half; Wing,
outside right; Esgen, inside right;
Drury, center forward; Pillsbury
