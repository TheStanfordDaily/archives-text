Letter of Thanks
Appreciation of Stanford's "great
| and valuable assistance" to the navy
in providing instruction to the newly
commissioned officers of the medical
corps is expressed in a letter to the
University faculty from Surgeon Gen
eral W. C. Braisted of the United
I States Navy.
"The courses given have been of
great benefit to all those who have
attended, and through them to the
medical department of the navy as a
whole," the surgeon general wrote.
These courses were given- by the
Medical School last summer.
No More Target
Practice
With the shipping today of the ri
fles assigned to the Stanford military
unit for target practice, came the an
nouncement by Sergeant August Bar
tels that all plans for practice by the
seven local companies on the rifle
' range, both with short and long-range
j rifles, have been abandoned. The
| government is experiencing a pro
i nounced scarcity in war supplies and
J has been forced to call in all available
material. According to the sergeant
it is quite possible that tlie2 Kraig
guns now at the gymnasium will be
recalled and he also stated that excel
: lent care of the arms must be taken
I in order to keep them here.

"Pep," as having gone over with a
