# Wireless Class for Women Will Not Be Formed Now
## 
### 
"Wire less telegraphy, as a war
time vocation for women, is imprac
tical." according to a statement of
Professor J.C. Clark of the Electrical
Engineering department, who has
been investigating the desirability of
a class in radio work for women.
During the war emergency registra
tio on the campus some time ago, the
women of the University signified
their interest in wireless work. In
vestigation as to the positions open
to women have shown that all radio
communication is in charge of the
navy and is generally on shipboard,
which precludes tshe possibility of
women holding such positions.
\\ ire telelgraphy offers many posi
tions for women, but Miss Bradford
urges all women to continue their
present college work.
