# STAGE SET FOR NEXT BOXING TOURNAMENT
## 
### 
Another amateur boxing tourna
ment will undoubtedly be staged by
the Olympic Club before the end of
the year, due to the success of the
Amateur Championships held in San
Francisco last week, when boxers
from every part o fthe United States
and Canada gathered for the fastest
performance of its kind in some time.
With the host of entries it required
expertness in management to hold all
the preliminary and finals in two
nights. This was done admirably, al
though there was some complaint
that certain fighters drew byes and
therefore were fresher in their final
matches than their opponents who
had to fight hard battles in the pre
liminaries. This situation operated
against Joe Murphy, Stanford's en
try, who defeated the champion wel
terweight of Southern California, but
gave too much in this effort to win
from Fred Murphy of the Olympic
Club, who later defeated the cham
pion and thereby gained the title.
Although it is not yet definitely
known who will enter from Stanford,
there is sure to be more in the next
tournament. Murphy is a certainty,
and if the little scrapper can reduce
enough to make the lightweight limit
he stands a very good chance of car
rying off the lightweight title. O. M.
Sullivan, '19, and D. Flint. grâ€ž are
other probable entrants.
