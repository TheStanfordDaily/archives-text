# MEN URGED NOT TO QUIT COLLEGE TO ENLIST NOW
## THREE WEEKS TO DECIDE Marx and Bugge Advice All Against Hasty Decisions: â€œThink It Over" 
### 
Rumors flying fast about the cam
pus today to the effect that all enlist
ments are soon to he closed to men
subject to tlie draft, have threatened
a general exodus from Stanford. Pro
fessor C. I). Marx, acting President of
the University, has, however, with the
co-operation of Major .Jens Bugge,
determined the exact situation, and
both urgently advise that 111011 now in
college take no hasty steps at tho
present time.
Major Bugge wired headquarters
today for information, and learned
that it is a positive decision that no
body who has been registered can en
list in the regular army after De
cember 15th. However, men who are
pretty well down on tne list may en
list in the Navy or Marine Corps after
December'loth. It will be seen from
the above, also, that the order does
not affect 111011 who have not yet reg
istered.
Major Bugge's advice is for delib
erate action, and urges that there is
plenty of time to enlist after Decem
ber 10th. lie wishes to go over the
whole situation with any man before
a decision is made to leave college.
Professor Marx says further:
1 There is ample time between now
and December 15 for a decision as
to the wisest course. We are now in
touch with Washington and hope to
get some information soon which will
enable the men now registered in the
University to finish their work. As
soon as any information is received
it will be published."
