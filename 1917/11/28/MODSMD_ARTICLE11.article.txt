# Third Campus Dance Will Be in Women's Club House
## 
### 
The Third Campus Dance of the
quarter will be held Friday night at
the Women's Club House, and unlike
its predecessors, is to be a 1 o'clock
affair. It will be strictly informal,
taxis and flowers being absolutely
under the ban. Those residents of
the campus who have not been over
come by too much study of Thanks
giving may begin the festivities at 8
o'clock for the $1.00 plus the usual
war tax of 10 per cent.
