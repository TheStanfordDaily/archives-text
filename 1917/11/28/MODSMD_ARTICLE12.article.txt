# BASKETBALL DOPE SAYS FIVE WILL BE STRONG TEAM
## CLASS PLAY NEXT WEEK Righter, Sullivan, Roney, and Schwarzenbek to Form Nucleus of Squad 
### 
\>ith lootball closed up for another
| year sport fans are already turning
; their attention to basketball as the
i next major athletic activity. In the
, indoor sport the outlook is much
j brighter than that at the first of the
! Rugby season, and considerable in
i terest is being taken in the game.
Wilson Hack.
Coach Russell Wilson, last year's
mentor in basketball, will handle the
ropes again this season. The man to
j skipper the Varsity five has not been
I selected as yet. lie will in all prob
ability be chosen from the throe vet
! erans who returned to the University
. this year. When this selection will
take place has not been decided but
1 it will probably be within the next
week or so.
[Class (initios Soon.
As a preliminary to the Varsity sea
son which comes after the Christmas
rccess, Coach Wilson will run the in
terelass contests off next week. A
complete schedule of the games will
| be out immediately after the Thanks
giving vacation and the teams will
begin practice next Monday.
From the present outlook the Jun
iors stand a good chance to win the
interclass title with Sullivan and
Righter as the backbone of their five
j and several good men to back them
up. The Sophomores would be in the
I running strong if it were not for the
fact that Debenham, last year's guard
j on the Freshman team, is out of the
! game for some time with a broken
leg. Hood, 1920 captain, Moulton,
and Bucklin will form the nucleus for
the second-year combination, how
ever, and should give the other classes
a hard battle.
The Seniors seem to be out of it.
Honey and Schwarzenbek are the
only veterans, while there are no
other very strong men. The Fresh
men are ol' course an unknown quan
tity but they may spring a surprise.
One mouth before the Varsity sea
son opens is much too long to dope
out the Varsity squad, but there are
several things certain even this early.
In Sullivan, Righter, Roney, Schwar
zenbek, Mood and two or three other
men Coach Wilson lias a squad at the
beginning which will put up a good
brand of ball. Roney and Hood are
strong forwards. Righter made the
Varsity at center last season, while
Sullivan, and possibly Schwarzenbek,
are guards who will show up well.
Coach Wilson is planning a basket
ball sign-up meeting in the near fu
ture when he will endeavor to get the
signature of every man interested-in
the court game. Following this, reg
ular practices for the Varsity will be
gin for the schedule being arranged
at present.
