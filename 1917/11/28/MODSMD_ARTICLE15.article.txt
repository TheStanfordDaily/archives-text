# "THE LAST TRENCHES"
## 
### 
"The Stanford Spirit" is a phrase that we are very apt to overwork,
but in the face of inroads upon the sudent body, made by the national sit
uation, it is a line of trenches to which we are forced.
The number of men in the University is decreasing every day. These
men who are leaving have been holding down the responsible positions in
undergraduate activity. The work they have been doing must be carried
on by Stanford men, but the situation demands that men comparatively
new to the duties throw themselves into the work. These men have not
the experience back of them that their predecessors had, under the older
methods, and must replace that spiritof "putting it through" with a de
termination to live up to the standard of the past.
It is not like Stanford to "quit" on anything at all. So long as men are
in college they are Stanford men and are worthy of carrying on the work
of Stanford men. We saw that most thoroughly last Saturday, when a
Varsity made up to an unusual extent of men new to the Block "S" did as
much honor to the Cardinal as any football team ever did. But football
is not all. There is a multitude of other openings in which to display that
same spirit which raises lack of experience to the level of the necessity
of the emergency. It means that every man in college is "Varsity" ma
terial in his line, and may be called upon at any time to shoulder the
whole responsibility.
We have had to change our old established methods to meet the war's
demands, but that old "Stanford Spirit" has sufficed in the past, and can
be counted on in the future to hold the last trenches.
