The carefree abandon of a schoolboy off on a summer vacation comes to
uk today as we give up all the worries and hardships of a college educa
tion and turn quickly and gladly to the celebration of Thanksgiving Day.
The days of relaxation hold for the Student Body varying ideas of enjoy
ment. Some have already gone home. Some see the Sophomore Cotillion
as the one bright spot of the vacation period. Others of us are content to
sit back and merely look forward to the coming days when we have noth
ing to do and in that comes our greatest enjoyment.
Regardless of what they undertake for consuming the time between
now and next Monday, The Daily Palo Alto wishes to extend to everyone
its best wishes for a heaping plate of turkey and days full of enjoyment.
