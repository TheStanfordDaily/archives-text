# ATTIC DRAMA GIVEN BY DOCTOR ALLINSON
## Aristophanes' "The Clouds" Subject of Lecture. Last Night 
### 
Stanford people were treated last
night to a reading of one of the mas
terpieces of ancient literature, and a
critical interpretation of it by one of
the highest authorities on the subject
now in the country, in the lecture and
reading of "The Clouds" of Aristo
phanes by Dr. F. G. Allinson, profes
sor of Greek at Brown University,
now holding the Sather lectureship at
the University of California. He first
lectured on Aristophanes and the At
tic drama, and then read parts of his
own translation of "The Clouds."
"Art for art's sake," said Dr. Allin
son, "was unknown among the ancient
Greeks, and all their pieces of liter
ature were written for a definite pur
pose. The purpose of Aristophanes,
who was a conservative, was to rid
icule and bring into disrepute the
fads and fallacies of his day. Hut he
was not merely a destructive critic.
He deserves to rank among the great
est names of literature on account of
two gifts which he possessed to a sur
passing degree,â€”his rapier-like wit.
and his lyrical genius. The main pur
pose of 'The Clouds,' so named be
cause the chorus was represented as
clouds, was to satirize Socrates and
his school of philosophy."
The speaker was introduced by Pro
fessor Murray, a schoolmate of Dr.
Allinson's at Haverford College.
