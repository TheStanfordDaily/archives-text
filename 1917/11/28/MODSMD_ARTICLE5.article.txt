Deeming it a patriotic duty to save
,the expenses of holding its annual
meeting, the Association of American
Law Schools, of which Stanford is a
member, will not convene in Chicago
at Christmas time this year, as here
tofore. Both Stanford and California
were among the thirty-two schools
voting to eliminate the meeting.
Dean C. A. Huston, who will leave
soon for war work at Washington,
was to have read a paper at the con
vention. He attended the meeting
last year and former Dean F. C.
Woodward the year before.
