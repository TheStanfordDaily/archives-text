# Cotillion Tonight Will Mark Climax of Season
## 
### 
Tonight the Sophomore Cotillion
marks the ligihest point of the fall in
the social life of the campus. Al
though the dress suit had a hard
fight of it, the outcome is to he an af
fair with all the outward signs of
formality. However, it is again urged
that, as in the past, (lowers and taxis
are taboo. It is a tradition on the
campus that local events do not call
for such luxuries, and the request is
made more urgent this year, in view
of war conditions.
At 8:4. r > this evening th emusic will
begin, at which time the grand march
will start.
