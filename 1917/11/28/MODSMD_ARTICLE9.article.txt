## 
### 
Stanford men now competing for
positions in the university's quotas
to the third and fourth training camps
will be interested in the following
suggestions written by Lieut. F. W.
Teschke of the Engineers' Officers'
Training Corps at Leavenworth, Kan.,
to Captain C. R. Swarts of the local
unit, the tips having been approved
by major Jens Bugge and highly com
mended by him:
"You cannot be too well prepared
before entering the camp. Have two
good uniforms made for yourself; one
for work and the other for inspection.
Always look neat and clean at every
formation.
"Do not buy cheap leggings, as they
break down too soon and do not look
well. Buy two good pairs of shoes and
let them be big enough, as your feet
will need room in hiking. Three olive
drab shirts are not too many—again
buy them a little large. Three suits
of light woolen underwear are enough.
Six pairs of light woolen socks should
do.
"Have a good Stetson hat and a
cap for good wear. A good pair of
slippers will rest your feet while
studying. You will need three'single
sheets and pillow oases. Don't be
stingy with the shoe polish.
"There are about eight to twelve
formations each day, and being late
at any one of them will count against
you. Every minute counts, and one
must pay strict attention all the time.
The fellow who can go full steam
| ahead, 110 matted liflw he feels, will
| come out ahead.
"Know infantry drill and be able to
drill anything, including a company.
Be able to receive and send messages
by semaphore and wigwag. Knowing
j French won't hurt you.
"Report in uniform, and be military
|by knocking before entering, and,
with hand at salute, report by saying,
i "Lieutenant reports for duty."
