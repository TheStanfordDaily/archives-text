# 1919 QUADS MUST BE PURCHASED BEFORE QUARTER ENDS
## RADICAL ACTION FORCED Acting President Marx Says Unstable Conditions Are Sufficient Cause 
### 
A radical departure in the method
of conducting Quad sales has been
made necessary by the extremely un
settled conditions of the year, with
the result that all who desire copies
of the 1918 Quad must purchase them
during the present quarter. The
prices of materials, engraving and
printing are so high that 110 more of
the year-books can be put out than
are known to be placed. This decis
ion was reached only after consider
ing all possible means of handling the
situation.
Professor C. D. Marx, acting Presi
dent of the University, considers the
above the wisest course. He says:
"To the students this year, who
wish copies of our year-book, the
Quad, I wish to say this: We must
avoid maste. To print more books
than we will use is careless waste
of valuable materials.
"I have every reason to believe the
1919 Quad will be a real Stanford
year-book, and hope all of the stu
dents will be able to have one. How
ever, it is absolutely necessary in
these strenuous times to know how
many books the students will want,
hence the staff will print only as
many as are purchased now."
The new plan does not mean a
Quad of lesser quality than has been
published heretofore, but only in
sures a book up to the standard, since
a concrete working basis will be es
tablished before January.
The "War Quad" promises a new
standard, if anything, according to
the estimate of the editor, through ex
ceptional art work and attention to
local interest in the photography.
Hand-painted inserts of well known
campus scenes make a new feature,
and it is claimed there will be a snap
shot of every person on the "Farm."
Purchases of the 1919 Quad may be
made during this quarter at the Book
store, Wideman's, The Regent, or
