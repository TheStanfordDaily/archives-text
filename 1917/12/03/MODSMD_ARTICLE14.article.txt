# BUY YOUR QUAD NOW.
## 
### 
The decision o fthe Quad staff that all purchases of the 1919 year book
must be made this quarter will not meet with universal approval. It is con
trary to the old custom of "catch-as-catch-can" distribution at the Law steps
in the spring.
But any word of criticism of the plan adopted would be rank disloyalty
to a Stanford institution. The Quad staff will be held at a standstill until a
dependable working basis can be reached. With the uncertainty of the pres
ent quarter, were, no constructive action can be taken, and what state of
affairs will exist by spring, no one can surmise.
After the financial support available for the coming year-book has been
ascertained, material can be adapted to the situation and there will be no
reason of rnot maintaining the standard of past Quads.
We may not like the idea of paying for our Quads in advance, but it is
one of the war emergencies that we are running up against every day.
Many of these war demands are personal. This one is not only personal,
but also affects a Stanford institution.
Every student must support this as a necessary measure. If the plan
will make a purchase by any student impossible the least that person who
loses can do is to bear it as a sacrifice and urge his neighbor to help make
the 1919 Quard possible.
This is no time for discussion. The decision has been made and has
the sanction of the Unievrsity authorities. Teh only course now is to maek
thebe st of the situation, give whole-hearted support to the Juniors who
have the responsibility, and boost for as good a Quad as any preceding one.
