"I am thankful that this war has
brought to us the fact of our sins,"
said Dr. Gardner in his sermon on
"The Sentiment of Thanksgiving" in
Memorial Church yesterday morning.
"The people of the United States
have been aroused to sense of sacri
fice and a clearer vision of their sel
fishness as they never were before."
The first service given for the sol
diers from Camp Fremont was con
ducted by Dr. Gardner in the after
noon.
