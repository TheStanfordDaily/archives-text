# NOVICE WRESTLERS TO COMPETE FRIDAY
## Entries at Various Weights To Hold Tournament in Encina Gymnasium 
### 
Opportunity for Stanford's embryo
wrestlers knocks next Friday after
noon, December 7, when the annual
Novice Wrestling Tournament is
staged in Encina Gym. The bouts
will be run off from 4 to 6 p.m.
Entries in all weights for this event
are desired and can be made by appli
cation to Coach D. C. Wise, '18, or
by signing up in the ante-room of the
gymnasium. Fifteen men have sig
nified their intention of participating
in the tournament to date, and most of
these entries are in classes under 165
pounds. The weights in which bouts
will be classed are: 105 pounds and
under, 115, 125, 135, 145, 158, 175, and
unlimited. Novices alone will be al
lowed to enter. This means only
those who have not taken wrestling
or wrestled in a meet at Stanford pre
vious to this season. An excellent
chance is therefore offered to men of
little or no experience in the game to
find out what they can do.
