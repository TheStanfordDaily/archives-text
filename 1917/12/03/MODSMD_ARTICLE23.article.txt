John Doe was not 21 on June 5,
1917. He is not registered for the
draft. Hut the older fellows are join
ing, enlisting for service in France.
John feels that he should go too. The
current sets strongly that way.
It is going to cost a lot, of course.
He must give up his degree, his
chance of a career. He stakes his life
and the happiness of others. But we
are not counting ourselves, except as
we can serve America. How can John
best serve the cause of America? As
soldier or as citizen-in-training? The
one duty is just as urgent, just as
patriotic as the other, it is up to
John to train himself, to be ready
when called for either.
We must not forget that the war is
a temporary crisis. Permanent peace
must follow. The great 'issues for
which we fight involve the future of
the World in the time of peace to
come and we must be ready to build
up, to reorganize America on a peace
basis, when the war shall have been
fought. It has been the fate of France
and England to exhaust their trained
men. They had to do so. But with
their losses and Europe's need to
warn us, it would be a crime for us
carelessly to do likewise. All who are
not called to fight must imperatively
be trained for the vaster work of
peace.
President Wilson says to John: Go
on with your studies. Secretary of
War Baker has just published a letter
deprecating the enlistment of men not
yet drafted. General Leonard Wood
says: College men should continue
their university training. Staff officers
say there is no lack of men. They
have all they can handle and are
training the soldiers as fast as they
can be shipped abroad. John is not
yet needed in the army.-
If the need comes, John will be
called to register under the amend
ment to the selective draft law which
will be passed by Congress this win
ter, and he will have ample oppor
tunity to ascertain the conditions of
service under which he will join the
army some time next summer. It is a
reasonable assumption that the oppor
tunities for enlistment in special regi
ments will be available to qualified
men in the second registration as they
have in the first, and the experience
which the army officers have had in
organizing the drafted men according
to the principle of the best use for
the best material will be applied to
the second army, to the decided ad
vantage of those who are competent
to lead or to render special service.
Thus if John should be wanted for
the fighting force, he will have the op
portunity to serve when and where
he can serve best. He will serve bet
ter, the better he is trained. It is John's
plain duty to dig in and hold on till
the call comes to go over the top.
