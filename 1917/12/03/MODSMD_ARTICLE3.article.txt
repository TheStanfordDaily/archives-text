# FORMAL ART GALLERY OPENING ON THURSDAY
## Invitations Have Been Sent Out for Event; Work Is Almost Completed 
### 
Formal invitations have been sent
out t othe opening of the Thomas Wel
ton Stanford Art Gallery to take place
on the evening M Thursday, December
G. Tickets are inclosed with the invi
tations and these are necessary for ad
mission, and must be presented at the
door. Work on the Art Gallery is about
completed with the exception of ex
terior garden and lawn work which
will follow the opening.
The main attraction will be the ex
hibition of lithographs by Mr. Joseph
Pennell of picturesque war-work as
authorized by the United States Gov
ernment. The collection of black and
white drawings arrived today from the
east and are now being hung. Paint
ings formally kept in the Museum have
been arranged in a separate room and
constitute an exhibit by themselves,
comprising some excellent work of the
last century, and several copies from
Titian and other old masters.
The interior of the new Art Gallery
is made up of two large rooms, both
of which are well lighted from above
by a large sky-light. This new light
ing arrangement is a great improve
ment over that of the museum, and
gives splendid light on all four walls,
allowing Visitors to easily inspect the
pictures. A modern color scheme has
been adopted, the wood-work being of
light brown, the walls of drab gray,
light enough to set off the exhibits,
and the ceiling and trimming of white.
The Pennell exhibit is composed of
two main groups, the work done in
America, of American factories and
munitions plants, and that done in
England, of warships, women muni
tion workers and docks. The first
room is devoted to older pictures, and
the other to the Pennell exhibit; on
the right wall of this room his Amer
ican prints will be placed, with the
English on the opposite side. Pen
nell's English work was done before
his American prints, and shows a
marked difference in treatment. If any
thing, the English prints reflect the
more conventional attitude of the Brit
ish toward art in their careful, detailed
teratment and conservative method.
The American prints, on the other
hand, show a greater freedom and en
ergy, and are inclined to impression
