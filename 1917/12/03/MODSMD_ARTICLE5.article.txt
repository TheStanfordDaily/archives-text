# BASKETBALL MEN WILL SIGN FOR SPORT IN ENCINA GYM
## CLASS GAMES COME SOON Both Varsity and First Year Aspirants to Report on Monday and Tuesday 
### 
Basketball enthusiasts will sign up
for the 1918 season at Encina Gym
nasium today and tomorrow accord
ing to an announcement made by
Coach Russell today. All men who
hope to try for either Freshman or
Varsity fives are urged to report at
the gym and hand in their names.
Class Games Soon.
Although definite practices for the
Varsity will not begin until the
Christmas recess is passed, Coach
Wilson will endeavor to get a line
on possibilities for the team by the
class games to be run off in the next
week or so. Following the sign-up
the coach will look over the men in
the different classes and select the
teams to compete in these contests.
Three Veterans Back.
With three veterans back to form
a nucleus of the five and several fast
men to fight for their positions,
Coach Wilson should have a bard
time picking a team this year. De
spite the fact that Captain-elect
Greve, a tower of strength to the
team last year, will not be back, such
men as Roney, Sullivan, Righter,
Schwarzenbek, and others should de
velop into good players. Sullivan,
especially, will add to the team's
strength at guard.
This year Stanford will travel in
the Pacific Coast Conference and for
this reason will meet a stronger team
than in other years. On the trip the
Varsity will battle such teams as
Washington State College, Oregon
Agricultural College, University of
Washington, and the University of
Oregon. In addition the schedule for
the Cardinal five includes games with
the University of California and other
fast California teams. Active play for
the Varsity will not begin until some
time in January, however.
