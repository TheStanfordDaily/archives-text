# BLUE AND GOLD WINS SECOND SOCCER GAME
## 2 to 1 is Score in Contest. Captain Roney Only Man To Shoot Goal 
### 
Stanford Varsity's second game
with the speedy California soccer
pack on the morning of Thanksgiving
Day left the 1917 series at a stand-off,
when the Blue and Gold downed the
local toe-artists by the score of 2 to
1. Although California played a much
better game and the Stanford men
were in good form, the Turkey-day
contest was a slower one than that
of the preceding Saturday, in which
the Cardinal triumphed by an equiv
alent score.
Not until the latter part of the sec
ond half did the Stanford team come
up to true form, and begin to threaten
a win over the Berkeleyites. Cali
fornia's two scores were made during
the first half, while Stanford's count
was put across by Captain Roney on
a penalty kick in the second period.
The fact that the grass was rather
long and wet on the Berkeley field
accounts largely for the lack of speed
in the early part of the game. It was
when Roney was moved from center
half to center forward in the latter
part of the second half that the for
ward pack really found themselves
and put over some speedy work.
Newland at the net played his usual
consistent and heady game.
This was the second out of the sev
enteen games since 1911 that Stan
ford has lost to the trans-bay univer
sity. The trophy given by Mrs.
Charles G. Lathrop in memory of her
husband, who was Mrs. Stanford's
brother, is now at stake and is to be
awarded to the winner of the majority
of ten intercollegiate games between
Stanford and California. Thursday's
game left the Cardinal with four
games to her credit out of the six
that have been played since 1915.
The C. Y. Williamson trophy, which
was up for competition before the
two universities prior to the present
one, was won outright by Stanford in
1914.
Thursday's lineup:
Newland, goal; Widell, right back;
Stamp, left back; Lifur, (Brill), right

Yewell, (Bates), left half; Say, out
side left; Pillsbury, inside left;
