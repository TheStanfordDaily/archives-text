"We have received orders to re
turn to France and expect to leave in
a few days. The instruction is to
travel light. We brought a great deal
of stuff down here, and now find it
necessary to get rid of it. For a
week a 'bazaar' has been in progress,
and the French soldiers and native
Albanians have purchased everything
from thermos bottles and kodaks to
flea powder and night shirts. We
won't be able to carry away many
souvenirs, either.
"Ten weeks' work here has proved
very interesting. We have driven on
the roads of Albania, Serbia, and
Macedonia. Have had plenty of work
to do, and each of us has had numer
ous adventures. War is as Mr. Sher
man said, yet one participating in it
can derive some profit from the ex
perience. Personally I have much en
joyed being among people of many
different nationalities.
"Had the opportunity to visit Mon
astir, in Serbia, early this week.
That city is the center of the greatest
activity on the Balkan front. W'hile
on the road near there I got a taste
of shell fire. About twenty big "obus"
dropped uncomfortably near, several
within 200 yards. Two big holes
were blown in the road shortly ahead
of us, and we saw a house blown up
half a kilometer away. Made the
trip by auto camion, supply wagon
and on foot. Walked most of the
night, crawling undera bush at 3 in
the morning for a little rest."
