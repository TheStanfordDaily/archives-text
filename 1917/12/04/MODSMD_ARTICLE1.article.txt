"The whole food situation is in
tensely grave at the present time, far
more serious than we thought it would
be early in the summer," writes Dr.
Wilbur to the Daily Palo Alto, of the
problem confronting the Food Admin
istration.
Dr. Wilbur says further that the
work of the department in which he
is engaged has become so large that
it has been necessary to decentralize
it into the different states in order to
get the maximum amount of food
saved in the shortest possible time.
In carrying out this purpose, Dr.
Wilbur is now touring a number of
the states of the middle west with the
view of emphasizing the importance
of food conservation work to the State
Food Administration, and the men as
sociated with them. A tour just com
pleted, to Maryland and North Caro
lina, was very successful.
Dr. Wilbur yesterday was in Colum
bus, Ohio, and following meetings to
day in Lansing, Michigan, will go to
Kentucky and continue west by way
of Indiana. Illinois, Wisconsin, lowa,
and Missouri. He plans returning to
Stanford shortly before Christmas.
According to plans of the Food Ad
ministration. Dr. Wilbur will continue
his personal work in the various
states next year, although he will un
doubtedly be here for the beginning
of the winter quarter.
