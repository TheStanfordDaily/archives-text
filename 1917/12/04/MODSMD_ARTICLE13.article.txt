# CONFERENCE ENDORSES USE OF FRESHMEN BY STANFORD
## CREW MAY BE DROPPED Coast Colleges Make Other Changes at Annual Meeting in City 
### 
Definite ruling that Stanford may
play Freshmen in the football game
with the University of Santa Clara and
that Sophomores coming into the
University from junior colleges, etc.,
may compete on Varsity teams but
not on Freshman, was made at the
first meeting of the Pacific Coast
Conference attended by Stanford
delegates in San Francisco yesterday.
In addition to the above formal
declarations of the Conference, senti
ment was expressed that there would
be no crew between Stanford and
University of California so long as
the present condition of finances ex
ists and there is a possibility there will
be no basketball between California
and northern universities. There was
no definite ruling to this effect, how
ever, and should conditions permit
there will be competition in these
events.
Boxing was added to the list of
sports under the jurisdiction of the
Conference. As a result there are six
sports which must be conducted
under Conference rules. These are
crew, basketball, baseball, intercol
legiate American football, track, and
wrestling. Soccer, swimming, boxing,
cross-country and Rugby will be con
ducted under agreements between
the contesting universities, however.
This allows Stanford and Santa
Clara to draw up whatever rules they
I wish for the conduct of the big game.
There will be no general Confer
; ence track meet this year according
to the ruling of the delegates but
should such a meet occur in the fu
ture it shall be conducted under the
rules of the I. C. A. A. A. A. Should
dual meets be held, however, between
members of the Conference, it was
formally decided that when contests
occur over rules they shall be settled
by the rules of the I. C. A. A. A. A.,
which means the University of Cali
fornia can not demand heats in track
| events since this is not allowed under
: these rules. Also in case a general
meet is held the judges and referees
shall be neutral.
California will not allow her
Freshmen to compete in the dual
meet with Stanford even though this
University agree to such a course of
action, according to opinions ex
pressed at the meeting. The dele
gates from Berkeley said they would
not have a track meet rather than
allow the first-year men to compete.
This statement came as a result of an
attempt by Dr. Angell to permit 1921
nient to be used in the big meet this
I year to offset the loss of men in the
j war and secure decent competition.
Those in attendance at the Confer
| ence were i)r. Frank Angell for Stan
ford, Professor 11. C. Howe of the
University of Oregon, Dean Priest of
the University of Washington, Pro
fessor S. Shedd of Washington State
College, Dr. M. C. Lynch of the Uni
versity of California Several other
men from the northern universities at
from the northern universities at
tended but did not take part in the
deliberations.
I At the conclusion of the meeting
Dr. M. C. Lynch of California was
elected president of the Conference
and Dr. A. B. Browne of Oregon Agri
cultural College was re-elected secre
tary.
