# GRAFT

Graft is a mean word. We don't like it, but from evidences shown in
campus politics, there are those who do. Politics at Stanford have always
been notoriously rotten, but this year they have passed beyond the pale of
indifference. The general laissez faire attitude the campus has always
assumed toward political questions which have a vital bearing on every
student in the University will have to be abandoned.
From the position of the onlooker it would appear that the few
"higher ups" are running a close second to Tammany Hall. Trades for
important offices in student affairs are managed with surprising ease.
Somebody gives the word and tricks are worked before the unseeing eyes
of our community ,and the weak protestations of a few fail to disturb the
slumbers of the sleeping student body.
We feel the time has come to act. Student body elections are sched
uled for the near future and important offices are to be filled by men most
able to act in undergraduate offices. It behooves every Stanford voter to
acquaint himself with candidates and issues when they shall arise, and not
drop interest in campus affairs because there is a scarcity of men who
have had experience in managing affairs for the student body.
When issues are so big outside our small, secluded circle, and when
millions of men are giving their lives for democracy, why should we ruin
what semblance of democracy we have here by stooping to petty grafting
politics? We have a chance now to give campus politics a thorough airing
and start out on a new basis with universal interest and equal opportun
ity as a foundation. How about it?
