Following is an extract from the
t
Buying American, which is published
by the New York American. In a re
cent editorial it says in part:
"Every man who wants to wear
woolen clothes next month should
buy them now, from present stocks,
at present prices. When these wool
stocks are exhausted it will not be a
questio nof price at all, but a question
of wool. Every extra or new all-wool
garment that you can haug now in
your clothes closet will pay for itself
As compared with the increased prices
that are now on the way; don't get
fussy over patterns—buy the wool.
Buy all the wool clothes you can
while you can—it's money in the
bank."
After Jan. 1 the government will
conserve the wool supply of the na
tion by enforcing the manufacture of
all cloth with a declared percentage
of cotton. This quotation is a valu
able warning to every man on the
campus.
