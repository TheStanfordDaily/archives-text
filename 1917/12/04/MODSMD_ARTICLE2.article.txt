# ILLUSTRATED REVIEW TO APPEAR TOMORROW
## "California and Football" by M.F. Samis To Explain Rugby Situation 
### 
Will California come back to Rugby
football? Does California really like
the American game? These and other
questions are answered in a timely
article appearing in the December is
sue of the Illustrated Review, which
will be on sale on the campus tomor
row. The writer, M. F. Samis, '20,
has studied the Rugby question from
all angles, and has done his best to
interpret the real sentiment of the
California campus, in his article, "Cal
ifornia and Football."
Were the author of the sensational
story about the women's place in the
college world, which startled the
campus from the pages of the Review
last year, in college this quarter, he
would find himself well answered in
the article by Miss Ruth Searcy, '20,
upon "Stanford Women's War Work.''
Frank Taylor, '.18, writes from Eu
rope of his trials and troubles along
the Mediterranean coast. This story
is of exceptional interest and is writ
ten in Taylor's characteristically
human style.
"The Big Game Review" serves
more to emphasize sidelights on the
game that have heretofore been neg
lected than to repeat the now familiar
story of the victory. Two pages of
football cuts, an illustrated page of
"Who's in the News," together with a
fac simile of the original copy of "Hail
Stanford, Hail," sent by the author,
Albert W. Smith, to J. E. McDowell,
enliven the pages of reading matter.
