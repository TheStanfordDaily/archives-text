Editor D. P. A.:
When passing the gate to the Uni
versity on the State Highway with
some visiting army men I was asked
if it was the entrance to Stanford Uni
versity. 1 replied that it was, with
merited pride, for the palm drive with
the red tile and the colored front of
the church with the brownstone made
a pleasant picture. One of the officers
agreed that the setting was wonderful,
but was puzzled by our attempt to spoil
it with such an unsightly entrance on
the highway.
The grounds around the entrance
can be changed and kept clean by
using a little of the time and labor
expended on the other side of the
stone wall. A few geraniums along
the wall would not be out of place,
either. Although it is really up to the
county authorities to help keep the
highway clean, this is no place to
stand on technicalities and there is
little excuse for delay on the part of
those in charge of the upkeeping of
the Stanford "Farm" in this matter.
A. B. JOHNSON.
