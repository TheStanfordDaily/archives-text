# QUAD YEAR BOOKS MUST BE BOUGHT NOW SAYS KNIGHT
## 
### 
Students leaving college this sem
ester should buy their 1919 Quads
now, and they will he mailed to any
address, Europe or America. Accord
ing to the management of the annual
on June 1, it is "straight dope" that
the present sale of Quads is not a
bluff. The increased price of publi
cation materials has made it neces
sary for the students working on the
Junior book to sell receipts this quar
ter which will on presentation entitle
the bearer to a copy of the Quad.
Contracts for paper, printing and
binding will be let by the Quad Man
ager this month, and the number con
tracted for will depend entirely on
the results of the present subscrip
tion campaign. A great many stu
dents who will wish a Quad next
spring are planning to "take a chance"
on there being extra copies printed.
However, this will be a fatal mistake,
for students actually desiring a Quad,
for no one can forecast conditions
even on our own campus next fall.
The Staff has promised a real year
i book featured with exceptional art
work, full representation of every ac
tivity, and an entirely new cover de
sign. Should but four hundred books
be purchased by the present student
body, a book will be urned out, but
the staff will not gamble on any more
than four hundred in view of war con
ditions. IF YOU WANT A QUAD GET
i IT NOW.
