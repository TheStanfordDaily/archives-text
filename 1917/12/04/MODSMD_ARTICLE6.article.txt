# CHRISTMAS PACKAGES REQUESTED BY MEN AT CAMP LEWIS
## NO HOLIDAY FURLOUGHS Former Stanford Man Asks That Student Body Send Gifts to Soldiers 
### 
Stanford has been asked to help
give the soldiers at Camp Lewis an
enjoyable Christmas, by sending
Christmas packages containing vari
ous little articles of comfort. The
request is made by Lieutenant Milton
C. Gunn, '16, who is in the supply of
fice of the 363 d Infantry, stationed at
Camp Lewis.
The request has been taken in hand
by Cap and Gown and so all contribu
tions will be made through this so
ciety. Lieutenant Gunn mentions in
his letter that there are several Stan
ford men in the camp, and they will
be assured of getting their packages
if the contributions are sent to the
"Christmas Committee," 363 d In
fantry, Camp Lewis, Washington.
There are 3660 enlisted men in
Gunn's regiment who must be pro
vided for by Northern California. The
Christmas Committee is making
every endeavor to provide for the
men, as no Christmas furloughs are
to be allowed. Christmas trees will
be set up in each regiment and the
presents for each man will be hung
on them.
Cigarettes, playing cards, pipes,
toilet articles, and eatables are what
should be included in the packages
I so that every soldier will be assured
of getting something and at the same
time a useful article.
The letter follows:
Supply Oilice, 363 d Infantry, Camp
Lewis, Wn., Nov. 27, 1917.
Mr. J. E. McDowell,
Asst. Registrar,
Stanford University, Cal.
Dear Mr. McDowell:
The Christmas Committee ol' the
regiment met yesterday and formu-!
lated plans for Christmas for the en
listed men of this command. In view
of the fact that the men will be un
able to get any furloughs, it is plan
ned to have Christmas trees in each
of the companies with presents for
each man.
A campaign is being waged
throughout the towns of Northern
California for individual packages
for men of this command. There are
3GGO enlisted men in this regiment
who will have to be provided for, all
of whom are from Northern Cali
fornia. At this time 1 do not know
the exact number from Stanford Uni
versity, but there are several, among
whom are "Mush" Stevens, "Schnick"
Snell, and several others whom I
have run across.
It has occurred that perhaps the
students of Stanford University,
more especially the women in the
various houses, would enjoy making
up some of these packages. As a
suggestion, if they think they want
to take this work up would advise
that such things as cigarettes, play-1
ing cards, pipes, toilet articles, and
eatables be included in these pack
ages. Due to the great number of
men to be cared for it will not be
feasible to address these to the men
personally, and while it may be that
the Stanford men will not get the
packages sent by Stanford students,
I can assure you that they will all
be provided for, and that such a con
tribution from Stanford would be very
geratly appreciated.
If you think there are any of the
students there who would care to
take up this work, I would appreciate
it. if you would let me know. These
packages will be addressed to the
"Christmas Committee, 363 d Infan
try, Camp Lewis, Washington."
Please accept my congratulations
on the outcome of the Santa Clara
game. Extend my best wishes to my
friends in the faculty and student
body.
Best wishes to you and Mrs. Mc-
Dowell.
Sincerely,
MILTON C. GUNN,
Second Lt., Supply Co., 363 d Infantry.
