# EXAMINATION JOYS
## 
### 
The joy of every student's heart, final examination schedules, are
with us. Many of us wake up to the sight of them with the sickening
feeling that they have come all too soon. Every semester the wail has
been heard and with the shortened quarter this year the student body
feels with added force, the blow of their appearance.
To many, the military question is one of indisputable importance.
They have worried over what they should do to the disadvantage of schol
astic activity. To others the schedules bring merely their customary
dread. Two weeks from today the first finals of the fall quarter will be a
thing of the past. That means just these two weeks for preparation. Re
gardless of the fear or confidence with which each individual student
enters on the home stretch they deserve his consideration. War decis
ions yet unmade should be dropped for the time. Other activities should
be shoved into the background. The result of final examination period de
termines to a large extent the success or failure of the present quarter's
work. Whether it is the student's last quarter in college or not he owes
it to himself to do the best he can. An education is a handy thing what
ever walk of life a student takes and the degree with which he applies
himself during his college days will show up before he has been thrust on
the unsuspecting world very long. It is up to every one of us to get in
and dig for the remainder of the semester and come out on top.
