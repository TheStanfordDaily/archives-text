# MAT ARTISTS SLATED FOR NOVICE TOURNEY
## Coach D.B. Wise Announces Meet With Olympics for Varsity 
### 
Novice wrestlers will come into
their own Friday afternoon, when the
annual tournament for the embryo
grapplers is staged from 4 to 6 p.m.
in Encina Gymnasium.
The bonts are to be between nov
ices exclusively, and this excludes all
who have participated in a meet or
taken wrestling at Stanford previous
to this season. Although most of the
bouts will be lacking to a consider
able extent in science, there is al
ways plenty of spirit shown by the
beginners, so that followers of the
sport will be treated to an interesting
afternoon. Entries are solicited in all
the weights, and prospective partici
pants can sign up with Coach I). C.
Wise, or in the ante-room of the gym
nasium-. Most of the entries to date
are under 165 pounds.
War conditions have made impos
sible all arrangements for tourna
ments with outside teams, thus far,
but Coach Wise hopes to have meets
with several aggregations, such as
the Olympic Club, and the San Fran
cisco Y. M. C. A., in the near future,
so that the Stanford Varsity grap
plers will have a busy season.
