# ART MUSEUM IS AT LAST BROUGHT TO COMPLETION
## 
### 
Thomas Welton Stanford's gift to
the University, the new $80,000 Art
Museum, is now completed, and the
formal opening will be held tomor
row night at 8 o'clock. The feature
of the opening will he the exhibition

of war lithographs by Joseph Pennell,
, done under authorization of the
; United States government. Music will

orchestra; otherwise no formal pro

opening on Encina walk, as no prep

use of the main stairway.
