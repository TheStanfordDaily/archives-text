# ART MUSEUM IS AT LAST BROUGHT TO COMPLETION
## 
### 
Thomas Welton Stanford's gift to
the University, the new $80,000 Art
Museum, is now completed, and the
formal opening will be held tomor
row night at 8 o'clock. The feature
of the opening will he the exhibition

of war lithographs by Joseph Pennell,
, done under authorization of the
; United States government. Music will
i he furnished by Jack Kegley and his
orchestra; otherwise no formal pro
| gram will be held. Tickets must be
! presented at the door, and visitors
; are asked to use the side entrance,
opening on Encina walk, as no prep
aration has yet been made for the
use of the main stairway.
Unlike any other museum recently
i built, with the exception of that of
Montreal, the new Art Gallery has an
interior completely finished in light
gray, against which prints, paintings
and all art works show to the greatest
| possible advantage. There is noth
ing about the rooms where exhibits
are placed to detract the eye from the
pictures themselves. Modernity is the
I keynote of the inside finishing, with
| an ample skylight to give the best
| possible lighting on all walls,
i Regarding the paintings and lith

ographs on exhibition tomorrow
night, P. J. Lenios, curator of the Mu
seum, said:
"The Thomas Welton Stanford Art
Museum is composed of four gal
leries; a main gallery, two smaller

galleries, and a large rear gallery. In
the main gallery and two smaller
ones are hung the Thomas Welton
Stanford collection of paintings for
which the gallery was primarily built.
In the rear gallery, which the trus
tees have planned for traveling and
loan exhibits, are placed the war lith
ographs by Joseph Pennell.
"On entering the last gallery the
visitor at first misses the color of the
other rooms. But Pennell has
achieved the value of color with only
black and white. He holds the dis
tinction of being America's leading
black and white artist. To work only
in a limited medium and to achieve
recognition from the world's greatest
art authorities and to have one's
work purchased by the governments
of Europe for their national galleries
is a rare distinction. Being a close
friend of Whistler and influenced by
his work, Pennell expresses the max


VIEW OF NEW ART Ml SKI lI FUOM THE
imum of subjects with the minimum
of means, as few other men are ca
pable of doing.
"This is shown in the print entitled
'The Larks,' where but a few lines
depict many aeroplanes on a sunlit
morning among rising clouds of mist.
"One cannot help being constantly
impressed with two facts in viewing
the war lithographs: that a great ac
tivity and vigor is throbbing through
the industries of the country, re
vealed to us by Pennell's permission
to work behind the scenes; and that
Pennell is an artist of prodigious ver
satility, producing in a year what
many artists fail to produce in a score
of years.
" 'Gun Testing Grounds' shows Pen
nell's rare ability of sacrificing parts
of the drawing and forcing the atten
tion to the center of interest â€”in this
instance a huge gun. 'Building Sub
marine Chasers' displays a mass of
detail and intricate mechanical por
tions artistically handled. 'Building
Destroyers' and 'In the Dry Docks'
are unusual compositions with a
marked Whistler influence and are
really among the best prints.
"Altogether it is a rare treat in
art that the University offers through
the munificence of Thomas Welton
Stanford
To make clear to lovers of graphic
art the art of lithography, Mr. Lemos
has added a case containing progres
sive steps in lithography besides a
brief synopsis of Pennell's life and
a list of his productions.
