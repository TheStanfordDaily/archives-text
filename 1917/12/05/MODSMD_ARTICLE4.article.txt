# Savannah Quartet Wins Music Lovers' Applause
## 
### 
A concert that merited better at
tendance that it obtained was given
by the Savannah String Quartet in
Assembly Hall last night. The tone
and finish of the organization were
excellent, and called forth hearty ap
plause from the audience. The pro
gram was in two parts, the classical
String Quartet, (1 major of Mozart,
and Antoni Dvorak's melodius
Quintet, Opus 81. It was the latter,
perhaps, which most strongly appeal
ed to the hearers.
The Savannah String Quartet,
which has been here on several past
occasions, is composed of Samuel
Savannah, first violin; Mrs. Samuel
Savannah, second violin; Eric
Weiler, viola, and Miss Dorothy Pas
more, 'cello. The work of Miss Pas
more was especially notable. In the
second number the quartet was as
sisted by Mrs. Maurice Kramer, pian
ist, to whom great credit is due for
her admirable accompaniment.
