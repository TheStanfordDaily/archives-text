# FIFTEEN DAYS LEFT TO PAY JUNIOR DUES
## 
### 
Fifteen more days are left in which
members of the Class of 11)19 may pay
their Quad clues, and have their pic
ture taken at Franklin's. So far this
semester the Juniors have not rallied
to the support of the annual as in
former years, but it is believed that
when the Xineteeners realize that the
fate of their publication is at present
hanging in the balance .they will make
it their business to get the six dollar
c heck in to the manager.
Out of a class of two hundred and
fifty students less than one hundred
â–  h the class have paid diito.
Every Junoir is urged to see that his
six dollars are pa d at once. Checks
should be mailed to the Quad Man
ager, Box i>2. Stanford Fniversity.
All fraternities, clubs, and honor
societies in the University are urged
to attend to the matter of Quad space
and picflires at once. A double spread
page with a picture will cost $20.00,
one page with or without picture
comes at* $12.50, while a half-page in
the year-book can be purchased for
$7.. r >o. In order to insure full repre
sentation of the different organiza
tions it is imperative that their pic
tures lie taken at once and their space
reserved. Officers of the different
clubs are asked to see G. J. Knight
at once in Room 406, Encina, con
cerning their Quad page.
