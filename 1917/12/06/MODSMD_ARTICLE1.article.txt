# PUBLICATION OF THE QUAD IS UP TO THE JUNIOR CLASS
## 1919 MEETING TO DECIDE Management Hopes to Print Volume Despite Adverse War Conditions 
### 
Whether the 1919 class will publish
a Quad this year will be decided at a
meeting o i'the Juniors called by Pres
ident Alfred Johannsen for next Tues
day at 1 o'clock in room 214. The
question is to be put directly to the
members of the class themselvesi,
since it is generally recognized that
only the Juniors can appreciate their
own sentiment upon the subject.
Campus opinion seems to favor the
publication of the Quad despite the
adverse conditions of the war. Ad
vocates of the year book point to the
action of the Stanford Junior class
in 1906, when the Quad was put out
despite the trying circumstances of
the ante-earthquake days.
The meeting of the 1919 class, it
is hoped by the Quad management,
will find a duplication of the former
"see it through" attitude. If every
one attends the ope nclass discussion,
it is their duty to either oppose the
Quad ourtright or determine to stand
behind the editor and manager. Their
rst duty, the management points out,
is to abide by the decision o fthe ma
jority; if the Quad is to be published
to pay their dues, and help make the
war edition successful, despite the
trying and extenuating circumstances.
