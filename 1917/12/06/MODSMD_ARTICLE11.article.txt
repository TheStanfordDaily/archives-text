# MANY EXAMINED FOR THIRD CAMP
## 
### 
Candidates for Stanford's quota of
fourteen men that will be sent to the
Third Officers' Training camp were
given physical examinations in En
cina Gymnasia myesterday afternoon.
A few men were unable to be pres
ent and have been requested to re
port Friday, as it is absolutely neces
sary that all applicants be examined
this week. Out of the forty-three men
who have applied for positions those
who are in a superior physical condi
tion will stand the best chance for
appointment. As the competition be
tween the men is unusually strong
a minor defect will no doubt eliminate
a man for the time being, although
he may be appointed as an alternate.
