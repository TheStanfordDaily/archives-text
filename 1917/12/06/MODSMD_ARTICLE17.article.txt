# NOMINATIONS
## 
### 
Two student body offices are to be filled on the Quad next Wednesday.
Owing to the scarcity of time left before the end of the quarter all nom
inations will be made through The Daily Palo Alto.
Although nominations do not close until Monday afternoon we urge
those who have candidates in mind for the respective positions to get the
names in at once so that the student body can know who are in the field.
