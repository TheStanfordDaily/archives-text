What with final examinations coming on. Red Cross and Y. M. C. A.
drives hardly over and every one demanding our time at once, there hard
ly seems room for anyone to make further requests But there is one re
quest that comes from all over this country and Europe which cannot be
ignored.
Men in the trenches and men in the training camps are asking for news
from home at Christmas time. For many of them it is the first Christmas
away from home and to all of them it is a day which will have new
significance this year. From those who have gone we have heard no com
plaint as to their lot. In fact most of them seem to like it and are en
tering into military work and life with almost inconceivable heartiness.
But when Christmas comes these men will be bound to feel the absence
of their close friends keenly. It isn't a request which will involve any
expense that they are making. It is simply that friends here remember
and remember them with a Christmas card. How about making out a list
right away of the old boys who are now in the service and drop them a
card?
