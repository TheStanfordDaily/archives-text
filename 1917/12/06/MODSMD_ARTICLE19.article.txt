Dear Mr. Editor:
[ don't wish to make any charges that you are henpecked or anything
like that, but it seems to me here is a mighty good groundwork for an edi
torial.
At last our campus has wakened up. A few little insignificant words
did the work. Investigation started and what deplorable conditions it did
expose. At first it looked as though the evidence was against the men, but
the further the investigation went the more deeply were the women in
volved. We never thought it of them.
Cold shoulders have been swung around here right and left while ring
ing the political towel. They have been the real power behind the gun. As
New York politicians would say, they are the higher-ups. It is indeed a
sad realization to those of us who have always respected the sincerity of
women kind to find that they would stoop to so much underhand work. A
sacred trust is placed on them for a day, and how do they return it?
They put some of the men in such a position that they go home to meals
only at the risk of their lives. They spar among themselves for the right
to been seen with our athletes, and fairly burst with pride when at last they
succeed in entering the sacred portals of one of Palo Alto's moving picture
emporiums with one of them, and tnen when these same men meet in
their official conferences the women yell graft. What's the answer? We'll
be the goat, what is? (Signed) Joe Stash.
