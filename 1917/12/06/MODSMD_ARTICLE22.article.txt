# JOHNSTON INTERPRETS DANTE'S MASTERPIECE
## "Divine Comedy" Name Result of Happy Conclusion to Sojourn in Hell 
### 
Eight (lays in hell would not be en
joyed by many moderns, but Dante
saw enough of inter/st there to keep
hi mwriting twenty-one years in an
attempt to describe it all, and then
he named the poem a comedy because
it had a happy ending.
Professor O. M. Johnston pointed
out these and many other interesting
facts concerning "The Divine Com
edy," when he lectured Tuesday
afternoon "in an attempt to shed
enough light on the comedy to lead
some of the people present to read it."
Professor Johnston said that vis
ions of the life hereafter were very
common during the middle ages, part
ly because all progrss in thought
seemed to have subsided but chiefly
because of the prevalent belief that
the end of the world would occur in
the year 1000. Dante, therefore, had
a wealth of material to draw from
when he wrote the comedy.
After outlining the story of the
poet's travels in the comedy, Pro
fessor Johnston compared the ac
counts of the other world as found in
the comedy with similar accounts
found in Egyptian and Greek litera
ture. He also described the stages of
purgatory as found in the comedy and
gave an exposition of the three
schools of interpretation that have
grown u pin criticism.
"There are three factors that make
Dante great," he said in conclusion.
"They are his style, his wonderful
personality that appears throughout
the poem, and the fact that he repre
sents his age."
