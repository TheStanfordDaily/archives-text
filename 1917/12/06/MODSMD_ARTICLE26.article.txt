# CLARENCE EDDY WILL PLAY HERE
## 
### 
Stanford's next Assembly is to be
the occasion for an organ concert by
Clarence Eddy, one of the world's
most famous musical names, and sur
passed by none as an organist. The
conecrt is to be held in Memorial
Church at the regular assembly hour
in order that all may have an oppor
tunity to hear.
Mr. Eddy, a native of Massachu
setts, has probably had a longer and
more extensive career than any other
living organist. Beginning his musi
cal education at the age of 11, he
studied first in this country and then
throughout Europe. Since his return
to America after a tour of the Old
World nations he has been located in
Chicago, where he acts as organist for
the First Presbyterian Church. By
reason of his work there and the
numerous recitals he has given, his
reputation has grown until he is
now known in every part of the mu
sical world. His pde-eminence as an
organist is evidenced b tyhe fact that
his services are in much demand as a
dedicator that he has opened more
new organs than any other living or
ganist.
The press of all nations is unani
mous in awarding ihm the highest
praise. From the "London Musical
News," which hails him as "One of
the graetest masters of the art of or
gan playing," to the Berlin "Kreuz
Zeitung," which says"He showed
himself as the chief of organists,"
every periodical exhauses the dic
tionary of favorable adjectives to pay
tribute to Mr. Eddy's technique, tone,
and wonderful musical genius.
