# Villanious Theft of Stanford Horses is Foiled by Natives of Antioch; Thief is Jailed
## 
### 
This is a story of mystery and
crime. In fact, it's a story of mys
terious crime. The initial incident in
this story occurred several weeks ago
and the denouement came today.
It was the night of the bonfire rally.
All was quiet in the neighborhood of
President Wilbur's new home and La
gunita. It was at tlii sauspicous mo
ment that the villain appeared, armed
with a saw. With clever and fiendish
ingenuity he sawed the bottom board
of the west gate of the Lagunita Field
and dropped the chain to the ground,
thereby making possible the opening
of the gate.
With the gate open, the villain
stealthily crept into the Lagunita
Feld and proceeded to steal two
horses belonging to the University, j
Clutching these firmly in either hand, 1
he proceeded to co\Â«*r up all traces
of his dastardly deed by replacing the i
chain and nailing up the board he had
sawed.
The scene changes and we next see
the cunning criminal among the coun
try estates of the rich, east of Menlo
Park. Here he adds a wagon stolen
from the James L. Flood place, a har
ness, two bales of hay and a sack of
grain from the Partee estate to his
collection of booty.
Proceeding with great alacrity to
Oakland, the villain, who may now be
technically termed a horsethief, sold
one of the horses and the wagon to a
sales stable there; rented a buggy
and hied him on In* way to Contra
Costa county. Arriving at Antioch,
he offered horse and buggy for sale for
$35. The natives became suspicious
at the price and the villain is arrested
on a vagrancy charge and held in the
county jail at Martinez.
Enter the University authorities in
the person of Farm Superintendent J.
E. Hewston. After considerable search
for the tw ostolen horses, Hewston
learns of the Antioch case, hastens to
Antioch and to Oakland and identi
fies the livestock.
Today the horses are due to be re
turned to Stanford and the Lagunita
Field (gate now repaired) and in a
few days the alleged "villain," who
boasts the German name of Con
O'Shea, will be brought up for trial at
Palo Alto.
