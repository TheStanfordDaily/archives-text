### 
Communication from Allentown,
I'a., where the various ambulance
units that have not been sent across
are in training, brought to light the
fact that E. R. Caughey, ex-'lB, is list
ed among men who will probably be
recommended to the third Reserve
Officers' Training Camp, to start soon
iu San Francisco.
Caughey has been east for some
time, having left Stanford with the
fourth ambulance unit. He was prom
inent in college activities of all sorts
while a student here and had been
elected to captain the 1918 varsity
track team before his departure. He
was a member of Encina Club, Skull
and Snakes and other college socie
ties.
