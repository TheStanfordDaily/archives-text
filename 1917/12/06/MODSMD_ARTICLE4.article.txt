# CHAPPIE PEDDLES CHRISTMAS HUMOR ON QUAD TOMORROW
## 
### 
Exuding Christmas clieer from its
brilliantly artistic cover and college
war ti emi'it from every page, Chap
arral will appear upon the compus to
morrow in its third edition of the
quarter. That this is the Yuletide
number is emphasized in the start
lingly feminine cover, drawn by Miss
Ruth Taylor, '19, and this is only one
of the art features that distinguish
the issue. A two-page drawing from
France, done in George Hall's inimi
table style, treats of the humorous
aspect of life with the ambulance
unit. George Kocher, '19, has sent a
full-page set of cartoons on "Things
the Men in the Service Miss Most."
Other art contributions are from
"Monk" Antrim, *19, R. C. Alexander,
'21, M. S. Bucanan, '21, H. K. Behn, '21,
L. C. Hall, '20, H. S. Jenkins, '19, and
W. G. Hall, '19.
The literary feature is by M. L.
Levy, '19, on "Doing His Bit," which
bears a war-time title, but tells of the
trials and tribulations of paying a
visit to the chaperon line at a campus
dance. Other humorous efforts have
been contributed by A. S. Glikbarg,
'19, M. D. Harris, '19, C. E. Randall,
'20, W. W. Wellman, '20, J. W. Gaff
ney, '20, and L. W. Dinkelspiel, '20.
Editorially Chappie sends his con
gratulations for the football victory,
and then by way of striking contrast
bemoans the fact that Stanford is
forced to compete with a team that
does not represent an educational in
stitution. Present methods of holding
Assemblies, and the woeful lack of at
tendance, is likewise struck by the
Chaparral Hammer.
