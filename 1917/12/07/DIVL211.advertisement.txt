Are YOU
Going to War?
You will be pretty glad to get the
1919 Quad when you are in camp,
or "over there." Pay your $3.50
today at the Bookstore and the Quad
will be mailed to you.
It's up to you, even if
you are going away,
to help the Quad.
This is your University and it should be
your pride that Stanford did not have to
give up her Quad this year. Every other
College in the country will have a year
book.
WILL WE?
