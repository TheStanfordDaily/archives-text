Dear Sir:
I am enclosing a copy of the pre
liminary report covering the receipts
and expenses for the games of the
Rugby season with the hope that you

as possible I will send you a final
statement of the total cost of the
Rugby season. In this connection I
wish to call your attention especially
to the gain of $187.75 on the prelim

the first time that the preliminary
games have paid for themselves. I
think this showing is especially cred
itable to the management this year,
and that Mr. Hauser and the members
of the team reserve full credit for this
record.
The whole showing is very satis
factroy and very creditable to this
year's management. Mr. Hauser,
backed by all the men in the football
squad, have demonstrated what can
be done with careful and judicious
management, and deserve the highest
praise for their successful efforts.
When the final figures for the total
cost of the Rugby season are avail
able, I feel sure they will be equally
satisfactory.
Very truly yours,

Rugby season. In this connection I
wish to call your attention especially
to the gain of $187.75 on the prelim
inary games. As far as 1 know, this is
the first time that the preliminary
games have paid for themselves. I
think this showing is especially cred
itable to the management this year,
and that Mr. Hauser and the members
of the team reserve full credit for this
record.
The whole showing is very satis
factroy and very creditable to this
year's management. Mr. Hauser,
backed by all the men in the football
squad, have demonstrated what can
be done with careful and judicious
management, and deserve the highest
praise for their successful efforts.
When the final figures for the total
cost of the Rugby season are avail
able, I feel sure they will be equally
satisfactory.
Very truly yours,
J. P. MITCHELL, Treasurer.

Receipts $1,017.60
Cost of games 829.85

From Stanford's share of the game
receipts there will be deducted $150
for advertising, about $">0 for repair
ing the bleachers and several other
minor sums which will leave a clear
gain of about $3000.
The total cost of the Rugby season
has not yet been determined, but it
will not exceed the $2,000 appropriat
ed for the purpose by the Board of
Athletic Control. As soon as all the
bills are received a final account cov
ering the whole Rugby season will
be published.
Approximately $3,000 net gain for
the football season is the preliminary
report submitted by the Board of Ath
letic Control. In addition, the report
shows that but $2,000 was used for
the expense of the complete season,
thus remaining within the appropria
tion of the Board of Control. This
cost for the complete season is the
lowest of several years at the same
time.
The preliminary games showed a
net gain, according to the report, of
$187.75 for the first time in the his
tory of the sport at the University.
According to the Board of Athletic
Control this showing is creditable to
"the management this year, and Mr.
Hauser and the members of the team
deserve full credit for this record."
