Dear Sir:
I am enclosing a copy of the pre
liminary report covering the receipts
and expenses for the games of the
Rugby season with the hope that you
will find room to publish it. As soon
as possible I will send you a final
statement of the total cost of the
Rugby season. In this connection I
wish to call your attention especially
to the gain of $187.75 on the prelim
inary games. As far as 1 know, this is
the first time that the preliminary
games have paid for themselves. I
think this showing is especially cred
itable to the management this year,
and that Mr. Hauser and the members
of the team reserve full credit for this
record.
The whole showing is very satis
factroy and very creditable to this
year's management. Mr. Hauser,
