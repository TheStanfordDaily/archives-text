# QUOTA FOR MILITARY CAMP MAY BE LARGER
## Major Bugge Wires Washington for increase of Stanford Number to Thirty 
### 
In an effort to enlarge Stanford's
quota to the third officers' training
camp, Major .Tens in the inter
ests of the military department, yester
day telegraphed the War Department
at Washington, D. C., asking permis
sion to appoint at least thirty men for
the training. The telegram read:
"Am informed that New Mexico Mil
itary Institute has secured quota of
forty-five and is having difficulty in
filling it on account of men being too
young. Have forty-four applicants
and over thirty that should make
good. Ts there some way our quota
can be raised in view of the fact that
we have over 400 under training?"
Major Bugge believes that Stanford
should have as largo a representation
at the camp as the N. M. I.and sim
lar institutions in the west and will
continue to work toward that end un
til some definite action is taken that
will give this university a proportional
quota, considering the large number
of men be is training.
