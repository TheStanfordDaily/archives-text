# SUGAR AND VINEGAR
## 
### 
The Stanford Illustrated Review in its last issue takes occasion to rap
Stanford men and women for the fact that they are not falling in with
the plan of food conservation as they should, but are continuing un
curbed their former social activities and functions, with refreshments as
they used to be.
We do not mean to say, by any means, that the students are sacrificing
at every turn, but it does seem that this criticism is unjust. Substi
tutes for sugar are being used in many cases at afternoon teas by the
women. The amount of sugar per person is being limited by many houses.
Dances and other social affairs have been neither so frequent nor so
elaborate as in former years. The Sophomore Cotillion, the biggest dance
of the quarter, was a model of war economy with no refreshments at all.
The attitude of the student body since the opening of the semester
has been one of economizing'. Whether they have done as much as they
could, we cannot sa/; but we do say that they deserve credit for what
they have done. The problem of conservation is for the whole country
to face. We venture the opinion that Stanford has more than done her
share and we want to see at least due credit given for it.
