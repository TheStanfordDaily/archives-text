# STARS IN OUR SERVICE FLAG

### 
Eight members of the faculty were today granted leaves of absence
from the University, by the Board of Trustees. In the majority of cases,
entrance into the service of the nation is the reason for the exodus, as it
may be termed, for it is the largest number ever to leave the University at
once.
While we view with pride, the part which has been played by Stan
ford students and ex-students in the war, we may also note the fact that
the national capital is drawing many Stanford men, mostly of the faculty,
for the important branches of executive administration which must be
carried on from that center.
The Law department is now giving its Dean, Professor C. A. Huston,
and Professor J. W. Bingham, to the war exports board, a request for
their services having been sent from Washington.
Professor Vernon L. Kellogg, of the Entomology department, will also
go to Washington to resume his work during the winter quarter with the
Belgian Relief Commission. Mrs. Kellogg, a Stanford graduate, will also
aid in the Belgian Relief Work.
The Medical department gives Dr. Tenney L. Davis and Dr. Norris F.
Hall to war service.
And while mentioning these who are leaving, a word of appreciation of
the work of Herbert Hoover and President Wilbur is not amiss.
Hoover's work is so great that all know of it. Dr. Wilbur's work in em
phasizing conservation is daily taking on greater proportions, as the food
situation is realized in its full gravity.
Stanford truly is no "slacker.'
