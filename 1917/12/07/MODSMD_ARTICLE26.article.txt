# Another Viewpoint
## 
### 
News Editor D. P. A.:
Since the writer of yesterday's
"Another Viewpoint" lias taken occa
sion to vent liis wrarli on the author
of a recent elitorial on "Graft," a
comeback, taken after his own pointed
style may not be out of the way.
The editorial he attacks as un
sound because it came from a woman, j
When the D. P. A. appeared in the j
P. O. boxes that night, comment went
forth to the effect that the paper was
at last waking up, was taking notice
of some live facts. The campus likes
live stuff; that editorial had new
vigor. It got by. For the first time
this year Stanford talked about the
D. P. A. and what it said. More, it
shook up those it was aimed at. They
came back, not with reason, but by
slinking behind the oldest arguments
in the world —a slam on the writer,
not because of what was said, oh, no
—but because a woman wrote it.
Cheap sarcasm, that, and needless to
say, it failed in its purpose.
Strangely enough, the name of Joe
Stash is not found in the bawl-out.
How should he know the editorial
was written by a woman? Since when
has it been the custom to place "An
other Viewpoint" just below the edi
torial? Was this transparent attempt
of such importance as to merit a
place below the editorial?
A woman has nerve enough to state
the truth, and some one comes back
at her with rather obvious sarcasm,
taking refuge, not in facts, but that
the writer of the thing he was peevd
at is a woman. The particular edi
torial he takes exception to is known
to be verified. "Joe Stash" was pos
sibly unaware of the facts of the case.
A SUBSCRIBER.
Dear Editing Board:
Camouflage is very valuable for
many purposes. At times these pur
poses are good and sometimes they
are not. However, there are evi
dences of late that there are some per
sons who use this term to hide an
unrevealed and perhaps undesirable
identity. Candidly, we believe that a
man should never be ashamed of his
convictions. Evidences or late have
shown that the women of the Uni
versity certainly are not.
But it appears that a certain Mr.
Joe Stash (name seemingly derived
from Powell street, San Francisco),
has become editorially communicative
ot late, and yet, modesty—or what —
compels him to make use of camou
flage?
If Mr. Stash really has anything to
say, he shouldn't be ashamed to ad
mit saying it. Although nothing was
said, someone tried to say something
and that somebody should have signed
his name.
We would suggest that fictitious,
bar-room names should be reserved
for the columns of "Chappie" or the
daily papers and not used in response
to an editorial from a member of the
"500."

—but because a woman wrote it.
Cheap sarcasm, that, and needless to
say, it failed in its purpose.
Strangely enough, the name of Joe
Stash is not found in the bawl-out.
How should he know the editorial
was written by a woman? Since when
has it been the custom to place "An
other Viewpoint" just below the edi
torial? Was this transparent attempt
of such importance as to merit a
place below the editorial?
A woman has nerve enough to state
the truth, and some one comes back
at her with rather obvious sarcasm,
taking refuge, not in facts, but that
the writer of the thing he was peevd
at is a woman. The particular edi
torial he takes exception to is known
to be verified. "Joe Stash" was pos
sibly unaware of the facts of the case.

Dear Editing Board:
Camouflage is very valuable for
many purposes. At times these pur
poses are good and sometimes they
are not. However, there are evi
dences of late that there are some per
sons who use this term to hide an
unrevealed and perhaps undesirable
identity. Candidly, we believe that a
man should never be ashamed of his
convictions. Evidences or late have
shown that the women of the Uni
versity certainly are not.
But it appears that a certain Mr.
Joe Stash (name seemingly derived
from Powell street, San Francisco),
has become editorially communicative
ot late, and yet, modesty—or what —
compels him to make use of camou
flage?
If Mr. Stash really has anything to
say, he shouldn't be ashamed to ad
mit saying it. Although nothing was
said, someone tried to say something
and that somebody should have signed
his name.
We would suggest that fictitious,
bar-room names should be reserved
for the columns of "Chappie" or the
daily papers and not used in response
to an editorial from a member of the
"500."
