# Daily Women to Disclose Their Ignorance in the "Pink Edition" Monday
## 
### 
Next Monday The Daily Palo Alto
will be published by the women of
the staff. It is the annual pink sheet,
in which the feminine journalists in
variably display how little they have
profited by the example set through
out the quarter by the men of the
staff.
Journalism students will study the
pink sheet with a view to detecting
ideals of journalism as they are not.
The public in general will probably
read it out of sheer curiosity, and the
real staff of The Daily Palo Alto, the
men, will bear it with inward writh
ings.
It is with no little trepidation that
this "sacred trust" is given to the
women. As they go "over the top,"
here's to them.
