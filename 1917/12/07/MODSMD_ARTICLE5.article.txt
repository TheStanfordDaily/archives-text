# BIG TREE PERISHING, HOLDOVERS RETRENCH
## 
### 
If the hold-overs ever relax their
vilgilant Big Game guard over the big
tree by the Southern Pacific track in
Palo Alto and the landmark falls into
the hands of the ruthless Santa
Clara vandals, or when it succumbs
to a natural death, the neighboring
municipality will not be permanently
without a family tree on which to
hand its honorable lineage. Out in
front of the David Starr Jordan
building in the oval, are growing a
whole flock of healthy little Palo
Altos, carefully tended to understudy
the famous redwood.
Competition is keen among the
of one was cut short by the cruel
of onewas cut short by the cruel
jaws of a power lawn mower, but
the others prosper in their new en
vironment.
Dr. G. J. Peirce of the Botany de
partment was the originator of the
idea of the University's growing its
own Palo Altos, and planted the seed
lings about two years ago. Dr. Peirce
says that the death knell of the big
tree has been sounded. The vibration
of passing trains, heavy concrete
walls which surround it, and lack of
moisture have ruined all chances of
longevity natural to the species.
