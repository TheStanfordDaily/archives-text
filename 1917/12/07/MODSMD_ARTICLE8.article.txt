# PENNELL LITHOGRAPHS FEATURE OPENING OF NEW ART MUSEUM
## LEMOS TO HAVE CHARGE This Art Museum Most Modern in Staleâ€”Will Be Open Daily to the Public PENNELL FEATURES IN ART MUSEUM OPENING 
### 
With a represetnative attendance
filling its large rooms to capacity, the
Thomas Welton Art Museum, recently
completed and corner-stone to the
new quadrangle, opened its doors for
the first time to the public last night.
Faculty members and a few favored
friends of the University were pres
ent, amongst whom mere Dr. Branney,
Mr. and Mrs. Vandcrlvnn Stow. Mr.
and Mrs. Percy Morgan, Acting Pres
ident Marx, Mr. and Mrs. Newhall and
Mr. and Mrs. Hewston.
War lithographs by Joseph Pennell
were the attraction of the evening,
consisting of an exhibit sent here
from the east, and done by permission
of the United States Government, and
exhibited by consent of the War and
Navy departments. A catalogue of
the Pennell lithographs was present
ed at the door, containing some inter
esting comments on various drawings
by the artist, and the number and
name of each picture.
Though two main exhibits werej
shown, the Pennell and a collection of
oil paintings given by Thomas Welton -
Stanford, interest centered about the
Pennell pictures, as these are here'
but for a short time, being a travel
ing exhibit. Pennell is considered the
foremost black and white artist in
America, and has done work for both.
the English and French governments. l
The present exhibit consists of Eng-'
lisli and American work, the English
being the earlier work, marked by a
greater care and finish than the later
American drawings. His work done;
in America takes or, a more impres
sionistic feeling. Several of these, too,
are marked by a Whistler influence,
which accounts for his change from
his older English method. Unlike
other black and white artists, Pennell
is able to subordinate the striking
and dramatic side of his subject to
a detailed mechanical perfection,
which make his sketches of value as
instructive prints, as well as artis
tically. It is an interesting note on
Pennell's work that the visitor must
stand back from a sketch to get the 1
full value of its subject and detail;
for on close inspection a drawing
often resolves itself into mere dark
and light dashes and spots.
In the English set of prints the ones
entitled "The Perambulator" and
"Evening in an Ammunition Factory"
show what a few "carefully careless",
lines will produce under a master's
hand. "Shops at Night" and 'Shot"
show Pennell at his best in strong
dark and light arrangements, portray
in dramatic conditions in England.
The English prints are in general less
satisfactory as decorative pieces, but
possibly of more value from a me
chanical standpoint. There is a con-!
ventional feeling in them not found
in the American set which is largelyj
freer with more attention given to
effect.
An interesting addition to the Pen
nell work was a set of progressive'
prints showing Pennell's emthod of
work.
A feature of the evening was music
by C. E. Kegley, D. C. Shepardson and
Otto Nagel. Greens and palms formed
a simple decorative arrangement; and
benches designed by J. P. Lemos, and
built in local campus wood shops,
added much to the setting.
Regarding the collection of oil
paintings, Mr. Lemos said:
"In the first room the Thomas Wel
ton Stanford collection is placed. En
tering either side of the main gallery
are two large paintings, one a scene
of the 'Digging of the Kiel Canal' with
a strikingly executed sky, with a fore-!
ground less happily produced, show
ing workmen primitively taking the 1
earth from the canal site._ The other!
picture is one of Jersey cows tres- j
passing through a growth of flowering:
shrubs; in this picture the best and
freest technique is shown. In fact,
the artist, Haywood Hardy, was ahead
of his fellow painters, breaking away
from tight and conventional presen- 1
tation of detail, using a breadth of,
handling and a cheerful key of color j
that makes this picture a refreshing
note in the collection.
"A large number of animal paint-:
ings are included in the collections,]
which undoubtedly show that the col-j
lection was particularly fond of an
imal subjects; among them are a 1
number of carefully detailed studies
showing much patience and labor."
Mr. Lemos will have full charge
of the new Art Museum which will
be open to the public free of charge
from 10 to 5 every day, including Sun
days. The Pennell exhibits will not
remain very long, but other exhibits
will take its place, and from time to
time new artists will be represented.
