# DUAL FOOTBALL GAMES HARDLY POSSIBLE SAYS ANGELL
## DIFFICULTIES ARE MANY San Francisco Alumni Are Making Efforts For Reconciliation 
### 
Regarding the newspaper contro
versy as to whether California and
Stanford will get together and play
both Rugby and American football,
Dr. Frank Angel 1 makes the follow
ing statement:
"Though I knew negotiations of
this kind to bring about reciprocal
gain to California and Stanford were
in progress, I was much surprised
when the transactions were pub
lished.
'it is doubtful whether such an ar
rangement of dual games can be
brought about, and if brought about
if they can be lasting. The difficulties
of maintaining two kinds of big foot
ball games on the same level, or ar
ranging schedules and giving em
blems would be considerable. But
my knowledge of this is drawn chiefly
from the newspapers."
Professor C. D. Marx said in re-
gard to the situation, that he knew
nothing about it.
San Francisco newspapers have
come forth with startling statements
that Stanford has advanced plans for
the dual arrangement of games, and
also that University of California au
thorities have rejected the plans.
Nothing has been done officially, and
according to Dr. Angell, nothing can
be done. Stanford alumni are very
anxious to put football competition
back on the old footing, and have di
rected their energies to this end.
Dick Barrett, president of the Stan
ford Alumni Association, and Leland
Cutler, member of the Stanford Ath
letic Board, both gave statements to
city papers to the effect that Stan
ford was willing to resume relations
on a fifty-fifty basis, if arrangements
could be made to play both games.
