# MERIT AND PRECEDENT
## 
### 
Merit deserves remuneration. Surely, you say, we all agree to that.
But when it comes to doling out the reward, we aren't always ready with
the goods.
We believe that the merit system in force on the staff of the Daily
Palo Alto is unquestionably the only way to adjust positions on the staff,
and that when a man, through diligence and ability has worked up
through all the successive stages to the top, he is entitled to the editor
ship. We realize that in a few cases there have been instances where two
men have worked up together, and the under man has felt justified in
competing for the position, but such instances have been only in cases
of excepional ability.
Group affiliations or popularity will not make a journalist, as they
make other student body officers. The editor of the Dally Palo Alto is
the only student body officer who gets his position on merit alone, and
this precedent should not be destroyed. If it is possible for any man in
the University to decide in his senior year to run for the editorship, and
be elected through a strong group pull, what incentive is there going to
be for a man to come out as a freshman and work three or four years on
the staff? For this reason, we protest against the injustice.
Hard work and merit are entitled to reward. No one of us wants to
be the one to withhold it. Let's al 1 get behind the right in this case
and make it might.
