# SOLDIERS DEFEATED IN THRILLING GAME
## First Basketball Contest of Season Played With Presidio Team 
### 
Did you hear about the basketball
game last Friday? It was awfully
exciting—l had a seat beside the best
looking man. Our team won, of
course, and they did look so cute
when they filed out, all in little cos
tumes just like bathing suits. I hated
to see the soldiers lose because they
came way down from the Presidio
in San Francisco. One was from
West Point —I wish I could meet him,
they are always the best dancers.
After awhile a whistle blew and
they all started throwing a big ball
around and every time that it went
through a net thing at either end the
men all yelled, "Basket —basket." It
was awfully odd. Then in the most
exciting place another whistle blew.
I asked the good looking man next to
me what it meant and he said it was
the end of the first half with 34 —5
in our favor. He was awfully nice.
When they came back there was a
new man with our team. I noticed
him right off, because he was so bow
legged. In the second half we made
3u points and the soldiers 3 points. I
I was awfully interested in one of the
defeated persons. My, he was big!
Some boy heard that I was report
ing the game and he gave me a list
with a lot of names and crosses. I
think it is silly, but r promised him I
would print it, so here it is. He said
the crosses meant a basket and the
L was a "try."
