# SAVE STAMPS TO AID BELGIAN BABY FUND
## 
### 
Save your stamps. The proceeds
from one thousand cancelled stamps
will feed a Belgian baby one month.
This is the new plea being made by
the French Relief Association. By a
chemical process dye manufacturers
in the east are able to extract the
dye from the stamps.
Miss Olga Myers of Menlo Park is
in charge of this fund for Belgian
babies.
