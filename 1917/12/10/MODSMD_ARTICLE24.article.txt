## Encina Gives Dance 
### 
Encina Club entertained tlie victo
rious Varsity football team at a one
o'clock dance last Friday evening.
Decorations were in ivy and many
statues of Winged Victory were in
evidence.
Among the guests were many of
the fairest co-eds and the most famed
Stanford men and politicians. One of
the latter was a former editor of the
Daily Palo Alto and he tried to look
so pleased when Marion said, "Who
ever wrote that Jere Stash stuff was
an awful boob, wasn't he?"
Another politician who is an aspir
ant to an important office on the
Daily Staff, took the president of the
Women's Conference. "Every little
bit helps."
