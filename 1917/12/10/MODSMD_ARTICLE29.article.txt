# Secret Scandal
## 
### 
Mr. Never Gossip whirled his fair
partner off to the rhythm -of "Over
There," and after offering the aston
ishing comments that the music was
fine, the decorations gorgeous, and
the weather O. K., s.uadenly bent to
ward her pearly ear and whispered,
"By the way, I'll tell you a little se
cret if you'l promise not to tell any
one—Betty Letter and Twistem
Fisigh were married yesterday. Yep
— they went to San Jose and —etc.,
etc., etc.
Never Gossip left his partner Avith
regret and swung o fl'his next victim.
"Did you hear that netty Letter, etc.,
etc. But don't tell anyone."
During the evening 100 were sworn
to secrecy, until one of the 100 for
got to request silence on the subject,
and so before the last light went out
o lithe campus that night there were
few who did not knww the details of
the existing marriage of Betty Letter
and Twistem Fisigh.
(P. S. —It was later found that the
story was fallacious.)
