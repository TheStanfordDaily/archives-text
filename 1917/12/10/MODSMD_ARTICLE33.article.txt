# Wartime Activities
## 
### 
War-time weddings and war bene
fits make up the round of social activ
ities, while farewell parties for men
who are called into service in the
National Army, have come to be an
almost daily occurrence. One of the
most recent surprises was the mar
riage of Lieutenant Kern, *13, to Miss
Dorothy Danforth of San Francisco.
Lieutenant Kern is at present with
the Field Artillery at the Presidio.
He was a member of Beta Theta Pi.
Another marriage of interest is that
of Miss Olive Cooley to Horace B.
Miller on December G. This wedding
was a break in the number of war
weddings, for there was no hint of the
military present.
