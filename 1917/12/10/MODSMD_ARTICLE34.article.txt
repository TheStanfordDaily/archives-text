Biff Quartz leaned out of the A. T.
O. window and yelled across the
"Yoo-hoo! Come on out, Cathy;
street.
there's another dance 011 the campus
tonight."
"Alright, Biff, I'll be ready 'bout
nine. Is there a good place to watch
it from?"
"Swell, Cath, â€”the den windows are
right near the ground, so we won't
have to stand 011 boxes this time."
Hymen's methods are varied.
