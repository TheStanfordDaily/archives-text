"To you we're very grateful," said Joe Stash, a young Phi G,
"You've helped us all; we thank you." He spoke editorially.
"And when the battle's over, and the fuss is settled down,
Success! You'll be rewarded with a star bright in your crown.
Pack up your grip cram full of tricks and run like anything.
If all goes well—and girls don't tell—then ulck the gods may briny."
But you never can tell!
