Juniors Strong.
The juniors should take the game
from the seniors tomorrow without
difficulty. Sullivan, Ilighter, Butts,
Starkey, Williamson, and Johannsen
form a combination that will take
their rivals down the lince since the
only veterans on the senior team are
Iloney and Scliwarzenbek. From early
season indications the real battle will
be between the sophomores and the
1919 men for the class championship
when the teams meet Thursday.
No Admission.
No admission is to be charged for
this game and the women especially
are urged to attend. Special arrange
ments have been made this year by
which the women may enter the
basketball court without going
through the gymnasium. The outside
gate opening on the drill grounds
back of the gymnasium is to be left
open and an inside door also. This
will eliminate the necessity of going
through the front entrance to the
building.
