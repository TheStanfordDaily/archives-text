# THE
						BEST MAN

### 
It is seldom that the Women's Edition demands comment in this col
umn, but such an exaggerated and Ã¼by yesterday's issue that I am calle
njust impression has been developed d upon to make a statement as to my
position in the present race for the editorship. If it were simply that I
had come out for one candidate my nomination of that candidate would
have been sufficient evidence of support, but the Women's Edition has
pictured me in the exceedingly embarrassing light of nominating one can
didate and supporting another There has never been any disposition on
my part to regret or withdraw the nomination I made in last Thursday's
issue. It has always devolved upon the editor to nominate the man he be
lieves best suited to be his successor. While I do not at present hold the
position of editor-iiwnief, the fact that I was the last to hold the position
led me to make the nomination thai I did. It is simply to make it clear
to the student body that 1 felt competent to make a nomination in ac
cordance with this precedent and am supporting my nominee and that it
is not any desire on my part to take advantage of my past or present
position to devote the editorial column to electioneering purposes, but
rather to clear up the false impressions created by yesterday's issue that
prompts me to make this statement.
