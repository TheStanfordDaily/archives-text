# FACTION OR MERIT

Difference in point of view is ex tant in the mind of a person only
when we come right down to the gist of the matter, the fssue is the same
fo rail. At this time there is much talk about what we call "Hall" and
"Row" differences. There should be 110 such thing, for, after all, we are,
or should be, all aiming at the same thing, which is now justice and right.
When the issue is clear as it is in a case like the present election for the
editorship of the Daily Palo Alto, no small extraneous issues, such as
factional differences, if there be any, should be allowed to enter in.
We feel that a man assumes a great deal when he runs on such a wob
bly foundation as the one that N. R Allen finds himself upon now. His
one excuse is that he is a member of the editing committee of the paper
at this time, and the justice of his position on that board is very question
able. The reason as given by the Executive Committee for placing Allen
on it was that if M. C. Hall were put 011, it might spoil the latt.er's chance
for being editor next semester. This seems wholly fallacious, for if this
were the case, why was not the next man below him on the staff given
the position? There were at that time two men ahead of Allen. It seems
highly probable that the move was made purely for political purposes.
Voters in the student body, it is time you show what you stand for.
It rests wholly with you to sway the balance for justice.
