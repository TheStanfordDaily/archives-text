Editor Daily Palo Alto:
We may as well be frank about the
issues involved in the election tomor
row for editor of the Daily Palo Alto.
Certain parties are trying to make it
a factional fight, whereas the only
issue should be one of merit. Politics
has no business in an election where
experience and faithful service count
for anything. Because of his ability
and his three and a half years as a
reporter, news editor and managing
editor of the daily, M. C. llall has
earned the honor to edit the paper.
If he is defeated it will be a sad com
mentary on our fair-mindedness and
much-vaunted democracy.

Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Sir: In regard to the coming elec
tion for Editor of The Daily Palo
Alto, supporters of one of the can
didates seem to be basing their claim
to consideration on what seems to me
painly ihe weakest argument which a
cnadidate for office could possibly
advance; â€”namely, the seniority or
so-called merit system which they as
sert has become a Stanford tradition.
It. is a peculiar fact that the self
appointed guardians of this particular
tradition seem to have a large per
centage of underclassmen in their
ranks and this may excuse them for
not remembering older cases where
men were elected for fitness alone.

Otis Castle, one of the best of past
Daily Editors, was so elected. Most
of our memories go back as far as the
selection of the recent editor, how
ever, and he also was put on out of
his "turn."
Choosing a man for any place by
seniority is hound to result in gen
; oral dissatisfaction. "Let the best
man win'' is the safer and more dem
ocratic method by which we have re
placed the older theories of divine
right and hereditary succession, and
we could listen with more rcspect to
sounder reasoning. If this is a ques
tion of seniority, why hold an elec
tion,
Yours turly,
KARL E LEIB.
Editor Daily Palo Alto.
Dear Sir: A communication ap
pearing in your issue of today calls
for several revisions. The instance
given of Otis Castle is in no way com
parable.
Castle was on the paper for three
war*, and was head of the staff until
I a half-year before the election, when,
due to political reasons, he was put
down. Castle then, in the eyes of the
1). P. v\. staff, deserved to run for the
position.
It may he well lo state that if tiie
"best" man is to win then llall cer
! tuiniy reserves the place, since no lia?
demonstrated this fact in a half-year
Lryout for first place. "Let the Ifcsl
.VI-,n Win."
