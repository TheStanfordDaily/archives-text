# TO TREAT SOLDIERS TO SOCCER CONTEST
## State Association to Send Two Picked Teams to Fremont Sunday 
### 
That interest may be aroused in
soccer at Camp Fremont, the Cali
fornia Soccer Association, of which
Coach Harry Maloney of Stanford is
chairman, is scheduled to send down
two picked teams from San Francisco
to stage an exhibition of the game
at the army camp, next Sunday after
noon. The 13th Infantry band will
give a concert in connection with the
game.
Considerable enthusiasm is being
manifested among the soldiers in the
English sport, and Sunday's contest
will give the men an added opportun
ity to learn the game. A soccer field
is now under process of construction
at the camp, and will be located near
the Y. M. C. A. building. Colonel
Smiley of Camp Fremont announces
that the public is invited to attend the
band concert and soccer contest. No
admission will be charged.
The California Soccer Association
is now entertaining plans for the
sending of a combined team of Stan
ford and University of California
stars to meet the soldiers at Camp
Fremont in the near future.
