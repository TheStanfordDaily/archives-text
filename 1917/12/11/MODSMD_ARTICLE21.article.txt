Brilliant, sparkling r<s page one,
Decked with "mugs" bright as the

Heads all punchy, none too long.
What few errors can be seen
Printers made —they won't be "clean."
Editorials full of pep,
Putting all the campus "hep"—
These embellish well page two
Where they ring out clear and true.
And besides such lofty views
Columns brim with lively news.

It would take a book to print
All its praises without stint.
