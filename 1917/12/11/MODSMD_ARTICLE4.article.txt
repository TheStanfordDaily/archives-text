# The
						Daily Palo Alto Staff Takes Stand for Justice And Merit In Election
## 
### 
To the Associated Students of Stan
ford University:
Since N. R. Allen, '18, lias been
nominated for the position of Editor
in-Chief of The Daily Palo Alto, we,
the undersigned members of the staff,
wish to take this opportunity of
placing our stand on this matter be
fore the student body and also the
facts which compel us to take this
stand.
Personally there is no animosity
between the undersigned and the
above mentioned nominee for the ed
itorship. It is merely a question of
principle and merit upon which we
base our arguments.
Following are the facts of the case:
M. C. Hall, '18, has served on the
paper for three and a half years, as
reporter, news editor and managing
editor, and according to all custom
and precedent is the sole candidate
for the position next quarter. In ad
dition, Hall was nominated by the re
tiring editor for the position, thus
making it plain that Hall is the right
ful candidate.
Allen came out for the D. P. A. in
the second half of his Sophomore
year and was given Freshman rank
ing on the staff. At the end of six
months he dropped work on the Daily
and has not reappeared on the paper
until the present quarter, thus doing
no work for a year. When he reap
peared this quarter he was given a
news editorship without havng worked
up to that position.
The merit system in force on The
Daily Palo Alto has always been the
basis upon which editors have been
chosen. If any degree of efficiency is
to be maintained this system must be
continued so that those who work up
to the position of editor and merit
this position cannot be ousted by po
litical machinations.
In view of the above facts the un:
dersigned feel that we, as members
of the staff, must take a determined
stand upon this matter. We cannot
support Allen in his campaign for
editor and call upon the student body
to decide the issue fairly upon the
facts presented.
