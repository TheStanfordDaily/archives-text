# THIRTEEN PAINTINGS GIVEN ART MUSEUM
## 
### 
Three new art acquisitions have
been placed in the Stanford Museum.
They are a collection of thirteen
paintings loaned by Mrs. Timothy
Hopkins, a painting loaned by Mrs.
Garcia Bassett of Palo Alto, and two
frame prints given by Encina Hall.
The Hopkins collection is a fine
group of pictures. Among them are
found the works of such artists as
Sir .Joshua Reynolds, Max Gaisser,
C. Jacquet, and Josef Israels.
The portrait of General William
Keppel is the work of Sir Joshua
Reynolds, P. R. A. This noted por
trait painter once said, when asked
why he charged so much for a por
trait which had taken him only an
hour or two to paint, "Madam, it has
taken a lifetime." He is also reported
as having said, when asked what it
was that he mixed with his paint to
produce such fine color, "Brains."
"Le Bibliophile" by Gaisser is par
ticularly noticeable for its perspec
tive. An art critic might say that it
had been done by a sculptor because
of the effect of roundness and com
pleteness of the figure which he has
been able to produce.
Many copies have been made from
Jacquet's painting "The Love Song,"
which is one of the collection.
Israel's "Pancake Day" is one of
a number of Dutch scenes which he
has painted and for which he is
noted. It is a good representative
piecc of work of this Dutch artist.
The quaint old English scenes in
the collection are those of "An
Autumn Evening, Worcestershire,','
by B. W. Leander, and "A Roadside
Inn," by Thomas Creswich.
T. S. Cooper's "Repose in the
Meadows," which was exhibited at "the
Royal Acadamy in 1851, was pur
chased by Mr. Hopkins on account of
