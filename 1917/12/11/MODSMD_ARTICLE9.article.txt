# THIRTEEN PAINTINGS GIVEN ART MUSEUM
## 
### 
Three new art acquisitions have
been placed in the Stanford Museum.
They are a collection of thirteen
paintings loaned by Mrs. Timothy
Hopkins, a painting loaned by Mrs.
Garcia Bassett of Palo Alto, and two
frame prints given by Encina Hall.
The Hopkins collection is a fine
group of pictures. Among them are
found the works of such artists as
Sir .Joshua Reynolds, Max Gaisser,
C. Jacquet, and Josef Israels.
The portrait of General William
Keppel is the work of Sir Joshua
Reynolds, P. R. A. This noted por
trait painter once said, when asked
why he charged so much for a por
trait which had taken him only an
hour or two to paint, "Madam, it has
taken a lifetime." He is also reported
as having said, when asked what it
was that he mixed with his paint to
produce such fine color, "Brains."
"Le Bibliophile" by Gaisser is par
ticularly noticeable for its perspec
tive. An art critic might say that it
had been done by a sculptor because
of the effect of roundness and com
pleteness of the figure which he has
been able to produce.
Many copies have been made from
Jacquet's painting "The Love Song,"
which is one of the collection.
Israel's "Pancake Day" is one of
a number of Dutch scenes which he
has painted and for which he is
noted. It is a good representative
piecc of work of this Dutch artist.
The quaint old English scenes in
the collection are those of "An
Autumn Evening, Worcestershire,','
by B. W. Leander, and "A Roadside
Inn," by Thomas Creswich.
T. S. Cooper's "Repose in the
Meadows," which was exhibited at "the
Royal Acadamy in 1851, was pur
chased by Mr. Hopkins on account of
the sky, but Pedro J. Lemos, curator,
says that had he himself been buying
it he would have taken it on account
of the cows, which Mr. Lemos con
siders to be very well done.
"The Sermon, the Interior of Se
ville Cathedral," by Sanchez Bar
budo, is an example of a great mass
of detail well handled. The main
figures are prominent while the unim
portant details are given a subordinate
place.
"Done Work" by H. W. B. Davis,
wliich was exhibited at the Royal
Academy in 1885, was etched by Fran
cois Flameng, whose painting "La
Fete de Mardi Gras, Venice," is also
aomng the collection.
"The Ferry o√üat,'* by James Stark;
"Storm at Sea," by C. Isabey ,and "A
Christian Martyr," by J. J. Henner,
which was exhibited at the salon 1885
fro mthe Chanchard collection, com
plete the collection. This exhibit is
on display on the south wall of the
art room at the Stanford Museum.
'Rinaldo and Armida," or "The
Enchantress and Her Lover," a paint
ing by Domenico Zampieri, has been
loaned to the museum by Mrs. Bas
sett. The only other copy in exist
ence is at present in the Louvre,
Paris. Zampieri lived the latter part
oi the fifteenth century and the first
part of the sixteenth, in the first half
of the nineteenth century his reputa
tion with- amateurs almost rivaled
that of Raphael.
Two framed prints of Sacramento,
one o ftlie city in the early fifties and
the other at the period of the flood,
are the gift of Encina Hall to the mu
seum. These lithographs have not
yet been placed on display, but Mr.
Lemos hopes to exhibit them soon in
a pioneer room whicli he is planning.
