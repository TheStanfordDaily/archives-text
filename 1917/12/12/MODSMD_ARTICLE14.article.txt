## J. E. Hewston is Donor of Interesting Collection to University 
### 
A collection of 606 European and
Colonial coins has been given to the
Stanford Museum by Farm Superin
tendent J. E. Hewston. They were
gathered from most of the European
countries, China, Arabia, Mexico, Can
ada, Nova Scotia and the United
States. Nearly all of the small king
doms of Europe are represented by
one or more coins.
Some of the most interesting pieces
are the papal coins. They are highly
decorative. One brass piece is ellip
tical in shape and has a full figure on
either side.
Most of the coins are of copper, and
some of the large ones that were
worth only a penny when they were
in circualtion, would make at least
two United States pennies. There are
a few silver pieces in the collection,
some from China and some from Mex
ico that were issued during the Span
ish rule.
The most interesting among the
American coins are the half-pennies
1 here are several dated 1807 and one
17S8. The most unusual ones are th"
alloy pennies of 1858, which resemble
a dime in size and a nickel in appear
ance.
Mr. Hewston's father was the owner
of the first mint in California and this
made it possible for him to assemble
(his large collection, which covers the
period of the eighteenth and nine
teenth centuries. The exhibit will be
placed on display in the "recent ac
quisitions" case in the Leland Stan
ford Junior Museum.
Replacas of twenty-four Grecian
coins also have been given to the mn
seum by Business Manager Vande -
lynn Stow. Each has some pleasing
design—either conventional, flower,
animal, or human—and they are all
beautiful. They offer a striking cor
trast to the other set of coins, whit h
are not nearly so artistic.
