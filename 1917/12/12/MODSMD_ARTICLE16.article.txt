# ALUMNI AND FOOTBALL

### 
The question of Stanford taking up the American game of football has
again been revived in the city paperswith statements of alumni as their
authority. The proposition as brought up is worthy of thorough consid
eration.
When the break with California first came up the chief difference was
011 the basis of the respective merits of the two games. That question has
long ago passed as a point of contention. Stanford students and alumni
hold to the belief that Rugby is the better game. They want to see it
played but they also want competition with California on the gridiron.
That both these desires may be carried into execution the alumni have
suggested playing both games. Their suggestion, we believe, has been dis
missed all too quickly. The arguments against it are that California will
not play both games, that they want to play American or not play Stanford
at all; the theory has also been advanced that it is not possible to play
both games and bring back the Big Game as it used to be; some have sug
gested that the Stanford authorities would not consider such a proposition.
Why not investigate this thing thoroughly and know whether it can be
carried through instead of letting it drop on some individual opinions? It
is too important a proposition to drop in this light manner and we cer
tainly want to see it decided and if there is no chance at all of getting it
through then dropping it once and for all.
