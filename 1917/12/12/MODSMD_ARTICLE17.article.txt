# UNETHICAL JOURNALISM
## 
### 
With the election over and the fial outcome decided, a statement is
necessary with regard to the use of the student publication for elec
tioneering purposes, as was the case yesterday. Unfair advantage was
taken by staff members without the consent of the editing committee in
answering a communication before it had reached the readers. Such use
is clearly a breach of journalism in student publications and was made
by the staff members 011 their own initiative and without the knowledge of
at. least the majority of the committee.
Under a statement signed by a member of the editing committee in
which it was clearly pointed out that there was no intention to use the edi
torial column for electioneering purposes there appeared matter in that
space which was very decidedly electioneering in character, which was
run through without the knowledge of any other member of the editing
committee.
As was stated in the signed statement there was 110 desire 011 the part
of the author to retract his position in the campaign, but we do feel that
this statement should be made in justice to the opposing candidate and
his supporters.
