# WOMEN ARE URGED TO AID RED CROSS WORK
## Local Auxiliary Needs More Help for Bandaging and Knitting Sweaters 
### 
Red Cross bandaging work on the
campus lias been greatly neglected
by Stanfor dwomen, according to
Miss Lucy Wizlizenus, '19, who has
charge of work done by the Stanford
Auxiliary. Few women who signed
up for the work during the war
emergency registration have come to
headquarters in the Women's Club
House to do their share. "Some af
ternoons no one has reported and sel
dom more than five are present," said
Miss Wizlizenus.
With only the present help, the
Stanford Auxiliary will be unable to
complete the work assigned to it by
the Palo Alto Chapter of the Red
Cross. If each one of the Five Hun
dred will give one hour of her time
until examinations begin, very much
of this work could be finished.
Yarn for sweaters has now arrived
and may be obtained at the headquar
ters. All who signed up for knitting
should get their wool at once, and
all women who wish to knit for the
lied Cross during the holidays may
also receive this free wool. Hereto
fore it has been necessary for each
girl to buy the yarn from the Red
Cross, but the recent donations which
were made to the organization have
made it possible for the wool to be
given out. free.
