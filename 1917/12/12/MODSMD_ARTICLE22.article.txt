# LIBRARY ADDS MANY VOLUMES THIS WEEK
## "The Latin At War" is by Will Irwin, a Former Editor of D.P.A. 
### 
"The Latin at War" is a new book
in the Library, just published by Will
Irwin, a former Stanford student, and
now a well-known war correspondent
on the western battle front. The book
was written during a recent visit to
the Italian theater of war, and gives
the contrast between the different
methods of warfare and the character
of the western and eastern contest.
Irwin was prominent in college jour
nalism when at Stanford, and has
since become known to the reading
public through the Saturday Evening
Post and other publications of like
character.
One of the most interesting volumes
added this week is a collection of car
toons by Raemaeker, famous Dutch
cartoonist, who has arawn for many
European publications and is now
working for the Hearst papers in the
United States. He is noted for both
the subject matter and the vivid char
acter of his sketches, which show not
so much a perfection of technique as
characterizaation and emotional por
trayal. The drawings are accompanied
by notes by well known writers.
"The Wives of Henry the Eighth"
will prove of interest to historical stu
dents. It is by the famous historian,
Martin Hume, and gives an entertain
ing account of that period of English
history.
