What kind of coal was used last
year?
What is the approximate amount
used last year?
What is the amount of coal which
the orderer has on hand?
Approximately how many days does
the one placing the order expect it
to last?
Has the orderer placed any other
orders with other dealers, and if so,
what is their size?
For each statement the truth of the
answers to the above questions must
be certified by the signature of either
the dealer or the orderer. Dealers
cannot sell more than thirty days'
supply, cannot take orders from those
having a supply on hand. Drivers
will return to dealers orders to places
where they find any supply on hand.
