# 1920 VICTORIOUS IN THE FIRST CONTEST OF CLASS SERIES
## FINAL COUNT IS 40-27 Sophomores to Meet Winner of Junior-Senior Game for Title 
### 
Nineteen-Twenty took the Nineteen-
Twenty-One basketers down the
line in the first game of the inter
class series on Encina Court last
night by the count of 40 to 27. A
combination of team-work anil ac
curate shooting enabled the Sopho
mores to overwhelm their opponents.
By their win last night the second
year team earned the right to meet
the winner of the Junior-Senior
struggle in the championship class
contest tomorrow night at 4:30.
The Freshman team held their op
ponents to a tie for the first half of
fhe first period but Captain Hood's
men found themselves with the score
7 to 8 in favor of the 1921 players
and rolled up to a 20 to 10 score in
the first half. Moulton for the Sopho
mores and Swanholm for the Fresh
men were the shining lights of this
haif.
With the opening of the second
period several new players were sent
in for the Freshmen and they speeded
up the play with a game comeback.
After the Imbes had shot four baskets,
however, the winners found them
selves again and rolled up enough
points to win by a large margin. Sea
man, at center for the Freshmen,
showed ni> particularly well during
this period, while the guarding of the
Sophomores was strong.
From the dope sheet the winners
last night will meet the Juniors for
the championship tomorrow. The
Seniors have no men to back up their
veterans and cannot, from present in
dications, put up a winning fight
against their rivals.
As usual no admission is to be
charged for the class championship
game tomorrow and for this reason a
large turn out is expected. Women,
especially, are urged to attend the
contest.
