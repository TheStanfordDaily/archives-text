# WONDERS OF HEAVENS CAMPBELL'S SUBJECT
## Formation of Solar System and Universe Theme of Tuesday Lecture 
### 
Something of the vastness of space,
somewhat of an idea of the immen
sity of the universe, was imparted to
the least imaginative of his hearers
last night by I)r. W. W. Campbell,
director of Lick Observatory, in his
lecture in the Little Theater, on "The
Earth's Position in the Universe.' 1 In
simple and non-technical style, he
told of the glories of the heavens and
the unsolved mysteries of the stellar
systems.
The earth, explained Dr. Campbell,
is one of the smallest and closest of
the eight major planets of our solar
system. Jupiter, the largest planet,
lis 1,000 times as large as tlie earth,
j but it only one one-thousandth
the bulk of the sun, which contains
over 99 per cent of the mass of the
solar system. Comets are attached to
the solar system, and revolve around
the sun in elliptical orbits.
According to the theory now gen
erally favored, the stellar system is
but one of tens of thousands of such
systems in existence throughout the
universe. These systems are seen
through the telescope as spiral
nebulae. They are each composed of
millions of stars like our sun, but
they are so far away that the individ
ual stars cannot he distinguished by
oven the most powerful reflector now
in use. On the lantern slides with
which the lecture was illustrated
these nebulae appeared as beautiful
spiral star-clouds of curious shapes.
The various stellar systems are prob
ably moving in specified orbits at a
speed of approximately 500 miles a
second.
Dr. Campbell spoke under the aus
pices of Sigma Xi, the scientific hon
orary fraternity. After the lecture,
a reception was held in his honor at
the Faculty Club House.
