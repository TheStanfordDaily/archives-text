### 
Word has been received from Presi
dent Wilbur that lie is now engaged
in the most strenuous campaign the
Food Administration has yet felt it
necessary to wage. Dr. Wilbur wrote
The Daily Palo Alto from Louisville,
Kentucky, where he has been in con
ference with the food administration
of that state. He is now in Chicago,
and to date has completed a tour of
Maryland, North Carolina, Ohio, Mich
igan, and Kentucky. The purpose of
the campaign has been to impress
more thoroughly the grave situation
confronting the United States and the
Allies.
In this regard Dr. Wilbur says:
"In general I find that the educated
people are aroused to the need of food
conservation, but I find that com
paratively few people actually realize
the position that this country is now
in with regard to the war. With the
Russian collapse and the Italian dis
aster, the most important thing be
fore us is to maintain France and
England in the fight until we can
train our armies and defeat Germany.
It is not a matter of our helping the
Allies, but it is keeping the Allies
fighting to help us. The principal
weapons we have now, while we are
training men and building ships, is to
see that there is a proper food supply
sent to the armies and people abroad,
in spite of the submarines.
"The food question is a far graver
one than we thought possible, now
that the harvest is all in. We can
only send what we save.
"There is a very important respon
sibility resting upon every educated
man and woman —to at once bring
about the most widespread food con
servation measures in order to keep
us from losing the war before we are
ready to win it."
