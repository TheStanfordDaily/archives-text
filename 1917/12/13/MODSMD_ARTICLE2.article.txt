# JUNIORS SECURE WIN OVER SENIORS BY 54 TO 17 COUNT
## 
### 
Juniors overran seniors for the
championship of the two upper classes
on Encina Court last night. Although
the 1918 men showed well in the first
half they were completely outclassed
in the second period and the game
ended with the count 54 to 17. By
the win last night the juniors earned
the right to meet the sophomores for
the championship of the four classes
tonight.
First Half Fast.
The game started with the two
teams evenly matched. The seniors
upset the dope by showing an exhi
bition of fight that surprised their
supporters. Toward the last part of
the period they weakened, however,
and the juniors were in the lead 18 to
13 when the whistle blew.
Captain Sullivan, Starkey and
Butts went in at the beginning of the
second half and the seniors were out
classed from this point. From the
playing of the juniors practically a
Varsity team can be chosen from their
ranks. Butts seems to be a standing
guard of exceptional ability, while
Sullivan should be the star of this
year's aggregation. At center Star
key and Williamson are both fast
men, while the forward positions
could be taken care of by Righter,
Starkey and Williamson.
With this combination the 1919 men
should have no particular trouble in
taking the sophomores down the line
tonight.
