The Editor of The Dally Palo Alto;
Dear Sir â€”To the "innocent by
stander" the position which various
members of the staff of the Daily Palo
Alto have taken in the present politi
cal situation seems, to say the least,
unfortunate. It would seem that the
editorial and news columns of the
daily paper of the campus should re
fect the sentiment of the campus pub
lic in general rather than the opinions
ol' any particular individuals or group
of individuals. Such sentiment can
only be correctly shown by the re
sults of the balloting on the Quad.
However today's election may turn
out, it is to be regretted that the
newspaper of the college-at-large
should be used as a political organ by
the over-enthusiastic members of any
faction. Irrespective of any one's per
sonal opinions in regard to the rela
tive merits of the candidates, it is
hardly in keeping with the dignity of
a college publication that the mem
bers of the staff should be permitted
to take advantage of their position
as such to comment upon or deny the
allegations set forth in a communica
tion by a member of ..tie student body
at large, when it is self-evident that
the writer of such communication can
have no opportunity of defending him
self until unavoidable prejudice has
been instilled in the minds of the
casual reader, it would seem at least
that the members of the staff should
consider themselves as bound by
newspaper ethics to place themselves
011 an equal basis with outside mem
bers of the student body.
Claims of "political machinations"
and "frame-ups" have a peculiarly dis
agreeable sound when introduced into
the columns of the supposedly impar
tial campus newspaper. Fair play
would seem to demand that such opin
ions should hardly be advanced under
cii cumstances where there can be no
"come back."
Very respectfully,
H. L. HEWS.
EDGAR R. DEAL.
J. S. FLINT.
Editor Daily Palo Alto.
Sir: It is both humorous and
pathetic to note the efforts of our
underclassmen, in their attempt to
steer the Student Body in the chan
nels of custom and precedent; to see
these youngsters, both "this year's"
and "last year's," the former who
have now completed nine full weeks
of college work and the latter who
have added to that one whole year,
guiding us by the lessons of the past.
With what abandon do they spread
their names across page one! How
plainly do they thereby display their
colossal ignorance of Stanford tradi
tion, as others have observed it!
Mr. Editor, the older students are
going fast. There still remain, how
ever. many who were here while the
present underclassmen graced Prep
school halls. Will you protect 11s,
therefore, from these neophytes, who,
with more ambition than wisdom,
will some day, by merely hanging
around, inherit the goal of their striv
ing?
Yours truly,
W. I. AMES, '18.
