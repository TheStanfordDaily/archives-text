# MORNING SERVICES TO BE DISCONTINUED
## 
### 
Daily morning prayer services
which have been held at 7:55 o'clock
in Memorial Church this quarter will
be discontinued during the winter
quarter, Chaplain Gardner has an
nounced. They are to be replaced by
daily vesper services at 4:15.
This arrangement has been made to
suit the convenience of students who
would find it hard to attend the early
morning service during the rainy
months.
The regular afternoon organ recital
will follow directly after the vesper
service, which will probably not last
more than ten or fifteen minutes.
