# Girls Cry As Stones Fly At Windows High
## 
### 
Primeval warfare has returned to
the campus in all its horrors. All
was still the other night as the chimes
pealed out dolefully the hour of mid
night, when suddenly the serenity of
late queeners and other transgressors
of the Conference regulations were
interrupted by the sudden crash of a
stone as it hurtled through a window
of one of the campus' most famous
sororities.
A woman's shriek was heard, fol
lowed by a rapid rain of stones upon
an exposed sleeping porch, where
were resting some of the campus'
most beautiful maidens. Incredible
as it may seein this ungallant and
cowardly attack was continued for
several minutes, until finally one of
the sisters recovered her presence of
mind sufficiently to reach for a flash
light (used usually for publicity pur
poses) and spotted it upon the un
friendly visitors.
A low line of gutteral oaths shocked
the ears of the girls upon the porch,
followed by the hasty scampering of
feet upon the grass. A fleeting vis
ion of the disappearing visitors
brought the only distinguishing fea
ture to light—they wore "cords."
