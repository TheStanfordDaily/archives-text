# EDDY APPEARS IN ORGAN RECITAL
## Exposition Player Pleases Hearers This Morning 
### 
The Memorial Church was crowd
ed this morning by students and Palo
Alto people attending the recital of
Clarence Eddy, the celebrated organ
ist from Chicago.
Mr. Eddy possesses the power of
throwing into his playmg all the depth
of his character and personality and
of inspiring his audience. He is a
complete master of the organ and his
performance was a revelation in tne
art of organ playing.
The new symphonic sketch, "Judith
of Bethulia," composed especially for
the organ and dedicated to Mr. Eddy
by R. S. Stoughton, was beautiful in
expression and was the most remark
able of the selections on the program.
It depicted episodes in the life of
Judith, the hour of prayer in the
Assyrian Camp, the dance of Judith
before Holofernes, the beheading of
Holofernes and the closing song of
triumph of the Israelites In their
March against the Assyrians, illustrat
ing throughout the wonderful tones
of the organ and the marvelous ren
dering ability of Mr. Eddy.
"Clair de Lune" Pmoonlight), by
Sigfrid Karg-Elert, was a very de
lightful "ultra-modern" organ compo
sition, being distinguished for its bar

monic design and skillful treatment
of the "whole-tone" scale.
The "Sonata Cromatica," the fourth
on the program, is ranked by the Oc
tober issue of the New York "Musical
America" as the greatest organ work
of our time. The composer, Pietro
A. Yon, a graduate of St. Cecilia Acad
emy in Rome, is now organist and
choirmaster of the Church of St.
Francis Xavier in New York.
Equally pleasing for its purity and
clearness of tone and execution was
the "Russian Boatmen's Song," by an
unknown composer, arranged by Mr.
Eddy.
The recital waas opened by Bach's
Prelude and Fugue in D major, a
brilliant and strikingly effective or
gan composition, and closed with
"Variations de Concert," dedicated to
Mr. Eddy by Joseph Bonnet. The
composer of this selection is a captain
in the French army, lately obtaining
a leave of absence in order to carry
on a series of organ recitals in this
country. He is now concertizing in
this country under the auspices of the
French-American Association for Mu
sical Art.
Mr. Eddy made a special trip to
Stanford from the east in order to
give the concert at this time.
