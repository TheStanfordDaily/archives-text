# WINTER'S FOOD SUPPLY IS TO DECIDE WAR STATES WILBUR
## LARGE SUPPLY NEEDED University President Touring East in Interests of Hoover Bureau 
### 
"This winter of 1918 is the period j
when it is to be tested in this great I
free country of ours whether or not I
our people are capable of voluntary j
sacrifice to save the world. That is I
the purpose of the organization of the 1
Food Administration —by voluntary i
effort to provide the food that the
world needs."
Such is the message from President
Wilbur, who is chairman of the foot!
conservation division of the Food Ad- J
ministration and who is now speaking
in the Middle West on conservation J
He has been in Washington anil is
thoroughly posted on the situation. As
a result he is pointing out the gravity
of the problem, which he declares is j
more serious than the Food Adminis
tration thought because of recent crit
ical developments in Europe. He:
writes:
"The whole idea in the Food Admin-,
istration was to get an organization
which would follow a common pro
gram so as to get results. Those who
say 'I cannot sign; I economize all I
can,' do not understand. It is a com
mon program, for a common purpose;
that purpose is to pile up at seaboard
wheat products, pork products, dairyj
products and sugar. It is not to use 1
these, but to use other things, so that j
our economizing means something—
we all ought to economize in war
times. But this is more than econ
omy: it is a common program; it is a
reduction in the use of things we
want to save, not pure economy.
"Serving food is a local problem for
each community, each person. Prices
and definite rules for everyone cannot
be formulated. It is a matter for each
one to eat only so much as is necessa
ry to maintain the human body
healthy and strong.
"Food has now taken a dominant po
sition in the war and the American
people must prepare themselves to
sacrifice far more than was at first
thought necessary. By the first of
December we had exported all of this
year's surplus of wheat.
"That means that the United States
can contribute to mix with the war
bread of our allies during this winter
only so much wheat as our people
save by reducing our consumption
month by month, and not one grain
more. There is just so much wheat
in the United States and Canada.
Every grain of it that is eaten here
cannot be shipped abroad. We have
to maintain enough food in this coun
try to keep our own people fed. If we
eat it all we cannot ship it. We have
to make up for our own boys any de
ficiency that this country makes be
cause it fails to save on this food ques
tion. We liave to make up with our
boys for it. You cannot get away from
the logic of that; and if we could get
that impressed 2 upon the American
people we could win this war in a
very short time, while it is almost
sure to take a. very long time to do it.
Food Waste Means Life Waste.
"Food means life; it means some
body's life. If you waste it you are
wasting a life —and you cannot escape
the responsibility. Everyone can sub
stitute other food stuffs for the few
vitals needed for export. We must
not overlook the fact that Russia col
lapsed, not because of the Germans on
her borders but because of the failure
to organize and feed her own citizen
ship. Russia had a large army and it
went to pieces, and its government
went to pieces, because the food prob
lem went to pieces. We must be
warned that if we are to emerge vic
torious from this war we cannot risk
the collapse of our allies from this
same cause."
