# WINTER'S FOOD SUPPLY IS TO DECIDE WAR STATES WILBUR
## LARGE SUPPLY NEEDED University President Touring East in Interests of Hoover Bureau 
### 
"This winter of 1918 is the period j
when it is to be tested in this great I
free country of ours whether or not I
our people are capable of voluntary j
sacrifice to save the world. That is I
the purpose of the organization of the 1
Food Administration —by voluntary i
effort to provide the food that the
world needs."
Such is the message from President
Wilbur, who is chairman of the foot!
conservation division of the Food Ad- J
ministration and who is now speaking
in the Middle West on conservation J
He has been in Washington anil is
thoroughly posted on the situation. As
a result he is pointing out the gravity
of the problem, which he declares is j
more serious than the Food Adminis
tration thought because of recent crit
ical developments in Europe. He:
writes:
"The whole idea in the Food Admin-,
istration was to get an organization
which would follow a common pro
gram so as to get results. Those who
say 'I cannot sign; I economize all I
can,' do not understand. It is a com
mon program, for a common purpose;
that purpose is to pile up at seaboard
wheat products, pork products, dairyj
products and sugar. It is not to use 1
these, but to use other things, so that j
our economizing means something—
we all ought to economize in war
times. But this is more than econ
omy: it is a common program; it is a
reduction in the use of things we
want to save, not pure economy.
"Serving food is a local problem for
each community, each person. Prices
and definite rules for everyone cannot
be formulated. It is a matter for each
one to eat only so much as is necessa
ry to maintain the human body
healthy and strong.
