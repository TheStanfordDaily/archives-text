Nineteen twenty upset the dope last
night in the finals of the interclass
series for the basketball champion
ship by taking the Juniors clown the
line for a 30-to2o defeat. The '19 men
with several varsity hopefuls in their
ranks could not stem the tide of the
Sophomores although they put up the
best battle seen in the class games so
far. Poor shooting and wild passing
was mainly responsible for the de
feat.
The Sophomores suffered from a
bad case of stage fright in the first
few minutes of play, but after the
Juniors had gained a six-point lead,
Ilood for the twenty men shot a foul
goal and this seemed to awaken the
second-year team. The Sophomores
shot enough baskets to even up the
score and the race was nip and luck
for several minutes, then the superi
or team work of the winners began to
tell and when the whistle blew to end
the half the score stood 1G to Sin fa
vor of the Sophomores.
At the end of the first half Sullivan
and Btets were sent in for the Junior
team, while Starkey went in al the
beginning of the second period These
men speeded up the play and fans
were treated to some hard playing
during this period. The Juniors
gained two baskets 011 their rivals in
the first few minutes when Righter
and Sullivan contributed to the score.
Not to be outdone, Hood and Moulton
for the Sophomores each rang up a
tally. The '19 men scored next, fol
lowed closely by another basket for
Moulton. The game went on this way
until the last two minutes of the
game, when the Sophomores took the
lead when Moulton and Hood each
made a basket.
When the last whistle blew the
count stood 30 to 20. The Juniors
made 12 points during the second half,
while the Sophomores came out with
14.
Rigliter was the only man who
counted consistently for the juniors,
while Sullivan starred at guard. For
the Sophomores, Hood and Moulton
were the shining lights,although Bran
don was not far behind, and the two
guards Swift and Parks showed well.
