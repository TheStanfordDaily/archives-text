# THE
						END

### 
Another volume of The Daily Palo Alto Is finished. The quarter has
been, in many respects, the worst the paper has ever had. Editorless at
the opening of school, it weathered the storm and then became editorless
again before the end of the quarter. To guide its destinies an editing com
mittee was appointed. This plan, which seemed very feasible at the time,
has not been satisfactory owing to circumstances which have arisen of
such a nature as to throw the policy of the paper into utter confusion and
with no one having sufficient power to avoid the confusion. However,
those circumstances are all over now and in turning the paper over to the
next editor we only wish him the best of luck and no such unfortunate cir
cumstances as confronted us this quarter.
Before saying the final word in this issue we want to make a last plea
for the maintenance of Stanford traditions. What registration will be
next quarter only Registration Day can tell. Indications are that among
the men it will be very light, and that most of those who do return will
be underclassmen. On them, as never before, will rest the responsibility
for the flourishing or decay of Stanford traditions. The upperclassmen
who return will necessarily have to lead in their preservation, and the job
is no small one. A fuller realization of just what these traditions mean to
the underclassmen would help them wonderfully in their part, and following
realization accordance with tliem is an added essential.
With the vacation period here and a small registration confronting us
Stanford students can do a wonderful good as they go to their respective
homes for the holidays. Advice from those in Washington who are in a po
sition to know is for men under the draft age to continue with their educa
tion. The desire to enlist is strong, and enlistment today in many cases
will mean regret tomorrow. We hope that where students find this feeling
they will do all in their power to discourage it.
In closing Volume 51, the staff of The Daily Palo Alto wishes its read
ers and the Stanford community a most happy holiday season.
