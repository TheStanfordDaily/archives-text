# CALIFORNIA LOSES JOHNNY STROUD AS GRADUATE MANAGER
## 
### 
Johnny Stroud has resigned from
the graduate managership of the Uni
versity of California and will accept a
position with a manufacturing concern
of San Francisco. Stroud has held the
office of graduate manager since his
election in 1913. He resigned from
this position several months ago, but
was persuaded to continue in office
until after the close of the football
season.
Stroud played Rugby for four years
at California, and was captain of the
1913 team, which fell before the Stan
for team with a score of 13-8. He was
also a member of the famous team
that included Dwiggins, Amos Elliott,
Sterling Peart, Lank Harris, and
Monte Morris.
There has never been a more com
petent man in the graduate manager's
office at California than Stroud. He
is said to have favored the proposition
of resumption of inter-collegiate re
lations with Stanford on the two
game basis, which has been recently
suggested unofficially.
