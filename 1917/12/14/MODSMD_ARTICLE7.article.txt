### 
Letters come frequently from Amer
ican boys in Europe, telling of adven
ture and thrilling experiences, but ;
one of the most intimate portrayals of
conditions where a number of Stan
ford men are now engaged is given in .
the letter following. Tbis was re
ceived by G. J. Levy, gr., from a
cousin serving in France, and speaks ;
of a number of men who only last j
year were figures on our campus.
The letter, written November 21, j

more for the general cause in a fac

in the trenches; for in actual warfare;
I chemical products count for as much j
