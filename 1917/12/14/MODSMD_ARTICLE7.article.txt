# LETTER FROM WESTERN FRONT TELLS OF GAS ATTACKS
## DESCRIBES EXPERIENCES Louis Levy of San Mateo Is in Ambulance Work With Men From Stanford 
### 
Letters come frequently from Amer
ican boys in Europe, telling of adven
ture and thrilling experiences, but ;
one of the most intimate portrayals of
conditions where a number of Stan
ford men are now engaged is given in .
the letter following. Tbis was re
ceived by G. J. Levy, gr., from a
cousin serving in France, and speaks ;
of a number of men who only last j
year were figures on our campus.
The letter, written November 21, j
follows:
•'1 wish to thank you for the cig- i
! arettes which you sent. 1 distributed i
, I
them amongst some "Poilus and they I
were delighted with them. Imagine, i
smoking American cigarettes! This i
do.es not occur every day, for they ,
ordinarily receive only the coarse j
French tobacco. They are so happy |
when they receive anything out of the
ordinary, and it is a real pleasure to:
.observe their delight on such occa-
I sions. Truly, the French Poilu is ;
i incomparable; no »oldier can equal
I him in his good his cheerful
ness, and iiis self ievial Vt his leis-i
I ure lie is the greatest child on earth;
j at the front he is a''hero. All that you j
; can read about him is but a bun- |
Idredth part of what he is in reality,
j The more one sees of him the more
one admires him. and it will never j
lie in our power to thank him sufTi- j
! ciently for what he has done for I
Fiance and for humanity.
| "G. doesn't seem to be to well sat
-lis lied in having to remain in the'
( United States. Hut he should set his '
.mind at ease, as he may be needed
more for the general cause in a fac
tory in the United States than lie re j
in the trenches; for in actual warfare;
I chemical products count for as much j
las cannons. The poison gases are the!
I best proof. I even think that in this |
; field we have still much to learn from,
the Germans. Recently—about two .
I months ago — I had an unusual expe-i
j rience with one of these Boche gases.
These gentlemen were in the "habit of,
I sending us daily waves of gas, which
the Poilus had named 'garlic gas,' j
i'chocolate gas' and 'mustard gas,' ac-i
cording to the odor which they pos
sessed.
"One day, being on rescue duty, I
was caught in a gas wave. It is true
that I had my mask on, but the wave
was so thick that little by little the
gas penetrated through the mask. For
tunately for me, this gas was of the
'garlic' variety. It had a very pro
nounced garlic odor and had no effect
at the time. But six hours later, the
membrane of my eyes became affect
ed so that I was obliged to keep my
eyes closed for forty-eight hours; and
worse still, four days later, 1 com
pletely lost my voice, and it was only
after a month's treatment that it re
turned. I am about well again now,
and have returned to my post. The
only treatment against this gas, in
ternal as well as external (i.e., for
the throat as well as for the eyes, is
bicarbonate of soda, or baking soda,
dissolved in water.
"The 'mustard' and 'chocolate'
gases are more dangerous. The first
of these, besides affecting the throat,
penetrates the clothing, and all moist
parts of the body become covered with
burns which cause horrible suffering.
As to the 'chocolate' ones, they are
the most dangerous of all, and unfor
tunate is he who happens to inhale
them. For it means /orty-eight hours
of agony, which is finally ended by
death.
"Pardon me if I have spoken at
length on this topic, but I thought
that it might be of interest to G.
"Since the above incident, I have
again been cited for bravery. This is
the second time, and I am especially
happy'for mother's sake, as it will
greatly please her.
"Our portion of the line is very
quiet at present; we have never had
so little to do. Our work is to take
the wounded from the rescue posts to
the ambulances, other sections being
on duty from tbX ambulances to the
hospitals. Amongst these latter are
several American sections, one of
which is No. 18. There are a number
of G.'s friends in this one. Since
their cantonment is quite far from
here, and they are in the habit of
leaving one of their ambulancs along
side of our cantonment, the conductor
of this car comes to our mess for his
meals. So far I have met Donaldson,
M. E. Tedford and H. S. Weler, all
of them most charming fellows.. Wel
ler says that he knows G. very well,
and had dinner with you before leav
ing. No doubt others will also come,
for it seems there are a dozen in the
section who come from Stanford.
Since they stop over here every three
days, and we are not yet ready to
leave, I shall probably see them all.
"I went home on leuve two weeks
ago. . , . Mother is very valiant and
very brave, and does not want us to
stop until we have retaken Alsace-
Lorraine. ... 1 saw George, who has
returned from the Orient, and also
Camille, who is on nts way to Italy.
"In spite of the latest news, which
is not very good, we remain very op
timistic. Italy, by her retreat, will
have given us a united comamnd,
which, we hope, will speed the victory.
More than ever we all repeat, 'On les
aura!' (We shall ge them.) It shall
certainly be hard, but victory is at
teh end of our efforts. Clemenceau,
who is now at the head of the govern
ment, has the confidener or all France.
With him, the Poilus will redouble
their ardor to give us new victories,
and these, we hope, shall be decisive.
"The Sammies have taken a part of
the front; very little, to be sure, but
I firmly believe that by next spring
they will lie at the height of their task,
and at that time we shall be able to
give the final blow to the Huns.
. n .'"I think I have said enough for
today. I shall be glad to hear from
you often, and would like to be re
membered to everyone
"LOUIS."
