# Asilomar Meeting Ends This Evening
## Stanford Delegation Falls Down in Point of Numbers 
### 
Stanford's representation at the an
nual Y. M. C. A. Conference at Asi
lomar during the Christmas vacation
was not as large as was expected last
quarter by the local association. Only
eight men attended the convention
from Stanford, but the week as a
whole at the "Y" camp was a decided
success. Practically all of the col
leges and universities of the state sent
delegates, and in addition, four men
journeyed up to the conference from
the University of Arizona ,and» some
thirty foreign students attended, mak
ing a total attendance of 150.
The purpose of the conference was
to train leaders for Y. M. C. A. work,
to bring the associations of the vari
ous colleges closer together and to
discuss programs of activity for the
coming year. Classes were conducted
by a number of noted Y. M. C. A.
workers, and addresses were given by
big men. A. E. Worthy, 'Ifi. secretary
of the local oflice, conducted a class in
Bible study, while W. D. Mcßae, coun
ty work secretary of the California
State Commission, treated the "Chal
lenge of the Rural Situation," and
Henry Nordahl, just returned from six
years of educational work in South
America, conducted a class in South
American problems.
The camp at Asilomar furnished a
delightful place for such a confer
ence, being situated on Moss Reach,
two miles from Pacific Grove. A new
dining room was' constructed to ac
commodate the delegates for this con
vention. Mornings were given over to
classes and study during the week,
while afternoons were taken up with
athletics.
