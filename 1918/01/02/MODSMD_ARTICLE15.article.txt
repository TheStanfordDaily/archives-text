# A 						DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE

### 
Tradition lias it that the editor's iirst duty on assuming ofiice is to sit
down at the official typewriter and grind out a more or loss lengthy state
ment of the policies lie intends to follow throughout his term.
During the present quarter the editorial policy will aim to be distinc
tive in but one fundamental respect. An independent position will be taken
whenever a question or situation of vital interest to the undergraduates or
the University community at large arises. There will be 110 attempt to muck
rake or to create discussion without justification. But when there s real
need lor criticism The Daily Palo Alto will not hesitate to voice the senti
ments—not of any group or faction on the campus—but of the student body
as a whole as fully and as sincerely as we can.
This straightforward honest expression of pinion may sometimes
wound personal feelings but the only other alternative the time-honored
method of straddling the fence and trying to please those on both sides of
it at the same time is morally impossible.
In the business of furnishing news to its readers —the essential pur
pose of the college paper—The Daily Palo Alto will try to represent in
creasingly every branch of University life and student activity in propor
tion to its relative importance. Co-operation of the campus public is at
all times appreciated in this respect.
Under the present printing contract the forms close at 3:30 in the af
ternoon and the Daily goes to press immediately afterwards, which means
that minor errors go uncorrected at the last minute. As far as possible,
however, all mistakes and imperfections will be remedied and a high
standard of accuracy will be maintained throughout the quarter.
