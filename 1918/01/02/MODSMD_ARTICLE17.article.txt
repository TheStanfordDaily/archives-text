# ENCINA HALL CLERK KILLED BY TRAIN
## 
### 
G. J. Groist who was clerk of En
cina Hall for the past two years, was
struck by a train and killed while
waiting for a friend at the Palo Alto
depot shortly before college closed.
Creist was somewhat deaf, and this is
given as the cause of his not receiving
warning of his danger. He is survived
by a wife and two children, one an
invalid girl.
