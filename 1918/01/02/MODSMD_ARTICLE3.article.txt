# Slaughter of . . . Innocents by . . . Faculty Axe
## 
### 
Reports from the front indicate that
the faculty axe has been as active
as in former years, and that fatalities
compare favorably with the list of
last semester. The "powers that be"
announce that 55 is the correct esti
mate of victims placed on probation;
58 the number presented with first
failures; and that 37 "flunked" —to
return no more. In proportion to the
number registered last quarter the
slaughter is as great as in previous
conflicts.
Stringent action was taken by the
Scholarship Committee in limiting
participation in student activities. The
reins were drawn tighter to shut out
of practically all student activities
and offices students who are on pro
bation.
This action conies as a result of
violations of the former more lenient
rule which prohibited students on pro
bation from holding sucli student body
offices as the editorship of The Daily
Palo Alto aud president of the stu
dent body.
15y special action of the committee
it was voted to amend the rule to the
extent that students on probation may
not officiate as student body officers,
as class officers, as members of stu
dent conferences, or as editors, man
agers or assistants of any student pub
lications. The ruling was further ex
tended to prevent students on proba
tion from participating in intercol
legiate debating contests, in athletic
contests with outside teams, or in
public performances with musical or
dramatic clubs.
Such action will affect a large num
ber of students registered in the Uni
versity, and was taken upon the rec
ommendation of the chairman of the
Scholarship Committee after explain
ing the regulation extant last sem
ester. «
