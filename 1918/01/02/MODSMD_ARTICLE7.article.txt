# RETURN OF VETERAN TRACK MEN MAKES FUTURE BRIGHT
## WAR CLAIMS ATHLETES Material Forthcoming from Freshman Class to Date Is Uncertain 
### 
Track conditions for 1918 are de
cidedly of an uncertain quantity. The
coach, the meets, the team, each pre
sents a problem demanding solution.
However, one thing appears certain
â€”there will be some sort of an inter
collegiate track meet early next
quarter, and a track team at Stanford
this quarter, since track, by its very
nature ,is a sport that suits itself to
condtions, and will remain in the col
leges when many other forms of ath
letics are declared either too expen
sive or too limited.
Prospects Not So Bad.
From the present uncertain view
point, Stanford appears better off than
might have been expected. The war
has made decided inroads, depriving
the team, amongst others, of its cap
tain, "Reg" Caughey, ex-'IS. How
ever, there are sevetal Varsity veter
ans back, and almost all of last year's
Freshman team, to make a strong bid
for a track championship. With the
registration of M. J. House, '19, to
day, all fears for the sprints and
hurdles have disappeared. To sup
port him in these events, Mel Levi,
'IS, A. S. Glikbarg, '19, W. B. Wells,
'20,. and E. L. Davis, '20, will be on
hand.
The middle distances ha ,r e a doubt
ful appearance. With H. R. Hertel,
'18, Varsity relay man, and M. T.
Maynard, '20, of last year's Freshman
learn, as the most promising candi
dates for honors.
Long distance men are numerous,
however, and these events should go
to Stanford, no matter what team
starts against the Cardinal. L. L.
Chapman, '18, three times winner of
the two-mile against California, will
again wear the spikes, and will un
doubtedly be hard pressed over all dis
tances by M. F. Samis, '20, last year's
Freshmen captain, A. F. Wilson, '18,
F. K. Colglazier, '20, mile record
holder for California-Stanford Fresh
man meet, and others. The field
events will probably be weak again,
but promising material ought to de
velop with W. L. Miller, '17, O. A.
Nagel, '20, G. K. Coonse, '20, 1). K.
Weaver, *20, and others to serve as a
nucleus.
What material will be torthcomint,
