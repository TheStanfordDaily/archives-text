NOTICE TO DEPOSITORS
As a 'depositor of this Bank you* are inter
ested, and entitled to know, the safeguards
we have adopted for tlie protection of your
funds.
First—We have been established for 1U
years, and are an incorporated State Savings
and Commercial Hank, operating under the
strongest State Hank Law of any State in
the United States, and arc subject to most
careful scrutiny and rigid examinations of
the State Hanking Department.
Sccond—The Stale Hank Law is incompar
ably stronger than the National Bank Law,
especially so far as Savings depositors are
concerned. It is a new law drawn by the
late Governor Johnson progressive legislature,
and modeled after the New York and Massa
chusetts Savings Hank Laws, with many safe
guards added. The public is not yet generally
aware of its protective features. Under its
rules, our Savings Bank must secure with
collateral, your deposits, when loaning its
funds, the law specifically defining the secur
ity we must take. No such provision exists
either in the National or Commercial Bank
laws. Thus the word Savings printed on our
advertising and stationery means Security to
you.
Third —All our Cash 011 hand is fully ln
suied against Hurglary and hold up, so that
this bank in case of Robbery could nut lose.
But in addition to this we carry two bottles
ot high powered chemicals in our safe, which
any explosion would break and the fumes
would prevent the criminals from securing
the money.
Fourth —Our Officers, who have the custody
o>" the Bank's funds, are all bonded in the
American Surety Co. of New York, so that
the Hank is protected against possible loss
both from within and without.
Fifth —Our building and fixtures are all
adequately protected against fire, and we also
carry Employers liability and compensation in
surance on our employes.
Sixth—Our vault is modern and fireproof,
and our money safe is equipped with the best
three clock time lock.
Seventh —Our loans are all approved by a
conservative Finance Committee before they
are made, and all Real Estate must be ap
praised at twice the value of the amount
loaned on same.
Eighth—A bank's real security to its depos
itors in its Capital and Surplus. Our bank has
greater capital and Surplus in proportion to
its deposit liability, than any other bank in
Santa Clara County.
Ninth —Being the only Bank in Mayfield,
and without competition, our management is
not tempted to take chances on loans; a sit
uation always likely to arise where two or
more rival Banks are fighting for business.
'I'enth—W'e are members of the American
Hankers Association and also the California
State Hankers Association which gives 11s ad
ditional protection, as well as the paid services
ot the Burns National Detective Agency to
run down any criminals operating against 11s.
Eleventh Any statement contained herein
car be verified by addressing the State Super
intendent of Banks, San Francisco, to whom
we respectfully refer.
Twelfth —All banks do not guard their de
positors with the same safeguards The May
field Bank does. Are you doing all your
business with us? Or part of it with some
bank which does not protect you so ade
quately? Your money on deposit with us is as
safe as though invested in a Government
Bond.
We make 110 charge on checking accounts.

NOTICE TO DEPOSITORS
As a 'depositor of this Bank you* are inter
ested, and entitled to know, the safeguards
we have adopted for tlie protection of your
funds.
First—We have been established for 1U
years, and are an incorporated State Savings
and Commercial Hank, operating under the
strongest State Hank Law of any State in
the United States, and arc subject to most
careful scrutiny and rigid examinations of
the State Hanking Department.
Sccond—The Stale Hank Law is incompar
ably stronger than the National Bank Law,
especially so far as Savings depositors are
concerned. It is a new law drawn by the
late Governor Johnson progressive legislature,
and modeled after the New York and Massa
chusetts Savings Hank Laws, with many safe
guards added. The public is not yet generally
aware of its protective features. Under its
rules, our Savings Bank must secure with
collateral, your deposits, when loaning its
funds, the law specifically defining the secur
ity we must take. No such provision exists
either in the National or Commercial Bank
laws. Thus the word Savings printed on our
advertising and stationery means Security to
you.
Third —All our Cash 011 hand is fully ln
suied against Hurglary and hold up, so that
this bank in case of Robbery could nut lose.
But in addition to this we carry two bottles
ot high powered chemicals in our safe, which
any explosion would break and the fumes
would prevent the criminals from securing
the money.
Fourth —Our Officers, who have the custody
o>" the Bank's funds, are all bonded in the
American Surety Co. of New York, so that
the Hank is protected against possible loss
both from within and without.
Fifth —Our building and fixtures are all
adequately protected against fire, and we also
carry Employers liability and compensation in
surance on our employes.
Sixth—Our vault is modern and fireproof,
and our money safe is equipped with the best
three clock time lock.
Seventh —Our loans are all approved by a
conservative Finance Committee before they
are made, and all Real Estate must be ap
praised at twice the value of the amount
loaned on same.
Eighth—A bank's real security to its depos
itors in its Capital and Surplus. Our bank has
greater capital and Surplus in proportion to
its deposit liability, than any other bank in
Santa Clara County.
Ninth —Being the only Bank in Mayfield,
and without competition, our management is
not tempted to take chances on loans; a sit
uation always likely to arise where two or
more rival Banks are fighting for business.
'I'enth—W'e are members of the American
Hankers Association and also the California
State Hankers Association which gives 11s ad
ditional protection, as well as the paid services
ot the Burns National Detective Agency to
run down any criminals operating against 11s.

ot high powered chemicals in our safe, which
any explosion would break and the fumes
would prevent the criminals from securing
the money.

o>" the Bank's funds, are all bonded in the
American Surety Co. of New York, so that
the Hank is protected against possible loss
both from within and without.

adequately protected against fire, and we also
carry Employers liability and compensation in
surance on our employes.

conservative Finance Committee before they

praised at twice the value of the amount
loaned on same.

itors in its Capital and Surplus. Our bank has
greater capital and Surplus in proportion to
its deposit liability, than any other bank in
Santa Clara County.

and without competition, our management is
not tempted to take chances on loans; a sit
uation always likely to arise where two or
more rival Banks are fighting for business.
