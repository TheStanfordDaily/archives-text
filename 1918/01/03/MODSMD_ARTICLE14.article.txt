# MANY COLLEGES EXCEED STANFORD IN WAR SPIRIT
## DR. WILBUR SCORES LACK OF INTEREST Stanford Not Aroused to Situation Says President 
### 
"That only one million of the one
hundred million people in the United
States are aroused to the real war sit
uation," was the startling statement
made by Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, who
expects to be at Stanford the greater
l art of this quarter, primarily to ar
range for the budget and make plans
for next year. The President further
Laid that Stanford is doing less than
many other colleges in the country to
fit its activities to war-time condi
tions.
"The most discouraging thing that
happened at Stanford last year," said
Dr. Wilbur, "was that the largest and
most important class meeting of the
year was held to discuss the wearing
cf formal dress, at the same time
that the few active ones who do real
ize the situation were going to lie
shot. The large majority of those who
stay behind do not take much inter
est,''
Dr. Wilbur lectured on his food
conservation tour in Meredith Col
lege, Ohio State University, Michigan
Agricultural College, University of
Wisconsin, University of lowa, the
State College at Ames, lowa, Univer
sity of Michigan, and the University
ol' Louisville. In all of these colleges
students have modified their social
activities, have simplified their col
lege publications, and have curtailed
intercollegiate athletic contests. Their
interest is being directed toward war
activities.
Dr. Wilbur believes that it is the
(■isattaclied attitude of the American
reople toward world responsibility
that is being felt here in Stanford.
Americans are brought up with the
idea that the country is large and
self-sufficient, and they therefore do
not develop an international sense.
"In such a program as the United
States has adopted toward food con
servation and other problems," the
President paid, "it is expected that the
intelligent communities will be the
first to act. If they don't, we will lose
the war. We have now had ten
months to grasp the situation, and
it' we haven't done it in that time, how
can we expect others to?"
From reports that have come to
Dr. Wilbur, he believes Stanford has
done well in conserving food, but has
not strained itself. "The Food Con
servation movement originated at
Stanford in Hoover, and has been car
i ! ed on by Stanford people, and
Stanford should be the first to com
ply with the movement. We must
realize that unless we feed Italy,
Fiance, and England from the 1017
crcps, they cannot maintain them
selves. The only way we can do it is
to conserve, if we eat as usual, we
can't do it.
"Flans for this year," said Dr.
Wilbur, "are simply to go ahead with
University work in the best manner
1 ossible, preparing all the time for
future useful service. The man or
tin woman who does not want to take
a contributory part in the great
human movements going on in the
world will have no place in Stanford
this year."
Dr. Wilbur is receiving letters from

Stanford men all over the world, in
all branches of service, and says that
il is remarkable how varied the
branches are.
As for material progress at Stan
ford this year, tlTe President says
that the buildings already started
v.ill be completed, but probably no
new construction will be begun until
after the war is over. Dr. Wilbur
commends the Stanford Hospital very
highly, saying that it is the best of its
kind that he has seen and that it is
up-to-date in every particular.

most important class meeting of the
year was held to discuss the wearing

stay behind do not take much inter

Dr. Wilbur lectured on his food
conservation tour in Meredith Col
lege, Ohio State University, Michigan
Agricultural College, University of
Wisconsin, University of lowa, the
State College at Ames, lowa, Univer
sity of Michigan, and the University
ol' Louisville. In all of these colleges
students have modified their social
activities, have simplified their col
lege publications, and have curtailed
intercollegiate athletic contests. Their
interest is being directed toward war
activities.
Dr. Wilbur believes that it is the
(■isattaclied attitude of the American
reople toward world responsibility
that is being felt here in Stanford.
Americans are brought up with the
idea that the country is large and
self-sufficient, and they therefore do
not develop an international sense.
"In such a program as the United
States has adopted toward food con
servation and other problems," the
President paid, "it is expected that the
intelligent communities will be the
first to act. If they don't, we will lose
the war. We have now had ten
months to grasp the situation, and
it' we haven't done it in that time, how
can we expect others to?"
From reports that have come to
Dr. Wilbur, he believes Stanford has
done well in conserving food, but has
not strained itself. "The Food Con
servation movement originated at
Stanford in Hoover, and has been car
i ! ed on by Stanford people, and
Stanford should be the first to com
ply with the movement. We must
realize that unless we feed Italy,
Fiance, and England from the 1017
crcps, they cannot maintain them
selves. The only way we can do it is
to conserve, if we eat as usual, we
can't do it.
"Flans for this year," said Dr.
Wilbur, "are simply to go ahead with
University work in the best manner
1 ossible, preparing all the time for
future useful service. The man or
tin woman who does not want to take
a contributory part in the great
human movements going on in the
world will have no place in Stanford
this year."
Dr. Wilbur is receiving letters from

Stanford men all over the world, in
all branches of service, and says that
il is remarkable how varied the
branches are.
As for material progress at Stan
ford this year, tlTe President says
that the buildings already started
v.ill be completed, but probably no
new construction will be begun until
after the war is over. Dr. Wilbur
commends the Stanford Hospital very
highly, saying that it is the best of its
kind that he has seen and that it is
up-to-date in every particular.
"That only one million of the one
hundred million people in the United
States are aroused to the real war sit
uation," was the startling statement
made by Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, who
expects to be at Stanford the greater
l art of this quarter, primarily to ar
range for the budget and make plans
for next year. The President further
Laid that Stanford is doing less than
many other colleges in the country to
fit its activities to war-time condi
tions.
"The most discouraging thing that
happened at Stanford last year," said
Dr. Wilbur, "was that the largest and
most important class meeting of the
year was held to discuss the wearing
cf formal dress, at the same time
