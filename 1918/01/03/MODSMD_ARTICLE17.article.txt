# WELCOME TO THE TASK
## 
### 
Many are the vacancies in the ranks of the returning collegians, hence
the word of welcome to the old students who came back to the campus yes
terday and today is heartier than ever before. This greeting also includes
those who arrived on the "Farm" for the first time to take up university
work. We are glad to have you with us, freshmen and other new students,
welcome!
The fact that there may now be fewer of us here and more of us "over
there" is however no excuse for those of us that still remain on the Quad
to fail to keep up the Stanford spirit at home or to neglect to pass cher
ished traditions on to the incoming graduates. As long as the University
remains open, and we hope the war will never necessitate its closing, and
at long as student activities continue, the undegraduates, individually and
as a body, must play the part of real Stanford men and women, and live up
to war-time responsibilities on the "Farm" just as much as Stanford people
in active service are living up to all that is expected of them.
Our teams in the various sports should be supported more than ever
before from now on. Every man that can possibly do so, and few can claim
exemption, should go out for some form of athletics or other student activ
ity. The test is not whether we win or lose games and meets this winter
and spring, but whether or not we still show the Cardinal fighting spirit.
If we do, victory will result just as surely as in the Rugby game with
Santa Clara, November 24.
It may mean that there will be fewer men in the bleachers and more on
the field or track, but this, after all, is the goal toward which the University
has long been striving. Its accomplishment will signify that Stanford spirit
is neither dying nor dead, but that it burns as brightly as in those "good
old days" about which we have heard so much. Perhaps, some day, it may
burn even a wee bit more brightly.
