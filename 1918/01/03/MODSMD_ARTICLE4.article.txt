# Beware! Staff Is Contaminated
## 
### 
Readers of The Daily Palo Alto, be
ware! Pestilence and disease has
started among prominent members of
the staff and as a result the news
runs the risk of being contaminated.
Yellow journalism has rarely ap
peared in the columns of the Daily,
but unfortunately disease stories have
made their appearance.
When H. G. Swendsen, '20, news
editor of The Daily Palo Alto, made
his way to the pesthouse this morn
ing, and was declared guilty of the
"chicken pox" (although no accusa
tion of queening is made), the editor
of The Daily Palo Alto, wishing to
preserve the reputation of the sheet
I for healthy news, declared Swendsen
jto be suspended from the staff, and
officially forebade his contributing to
the paper while he is in quarantine.
Such abridgmen of the right of free
speech is thought only a necessary
emergency precaution. However
Swendsen has made no statement
upon the matter, as the reporter
could not reach him.
Fraternity brothers of the disbarred
news editor were not as indignant as
might have been expected, due to
j knowledge that the disease with which
j Swendsen is afflicted is contagious.
Complainers, take heed! Those of
i you who did not receive your Daily
yesterday offer prayers of thankful
ness to the management for their
thoughtfulness in sparing you the
danger of contagion.
