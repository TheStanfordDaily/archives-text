# BLIND POET TO GIVE SEVERAL LECTURES
## 
### 
N. C. Hanks, blind "poet-philoso
pher," who attended classes in the
University in 1915, is again on the
campus. Mr. Hanks is planning to
give a series of lectures in near-by
towns, and these promise a great suc
cess, as the poet and his philosophy
are well known both on the ca'rnpus
and throughout the peninsula.
Mr. Hanks has been lecturing in
the middle western states during the
past year, since leaving this state. He
lias a remarkable ability for finding
his way about, and while on the cam
pus could go about alone with little
trouble.
