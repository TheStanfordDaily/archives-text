Beginning tonight The Daily
Palo Alto will bo delivered to the
addresses of its Palo Alto sub
scribers who live within the city
limits instead of going to them by
mail as during the last quarter.
The return to the carrier system
will bring their paper to them at
the same hour it reaches people
on the campus through the post
office.
All persons who did not turn in
their addresses when they bought
Associated Student tickets should
do so at once at the graduate man
ager's office if they wish to get the
Daily.
