# THREE VETERANS ARE NUCLEUS FOR BASKETBALL TEAM
## PROSPECTS ARE BRIGHT Russell Wilson WTill Not Return to Coach Squad For This Season 
### 
Although the team is without a
coach, prospects for a good basket
ball season are bright this year with
three veterans back on the job. Man
ager Sullivan has arranged enough
games to keep the interest of the fans
on edge, and fro mthe style of basket
ball dispensed in the past by the Stan
ford quintets the students should see
some fast play in Encina gymnasium
this season.
The first game will be played Mon
day night at 8 o'clock with the Bth In
fantry team, the best five operating
011 the Camp Fremont courts, accord
ing to advance reports. The game
will be played at the Y. M. C. A. Ar
mory in Palo Alto. The personnel of
the Stanford quintet will be chosen
this evening.
Graduate Manager Sullivan has ar
ranged for games to be played on the
Stanford court every Wednesday and
Friday evenings. In all probability a
dance will follow the Friday evening
games in order to encourage the at
tendance of co-eds at the contests.
This should prove an attractive fea
ture of the athletic season. Stanford
will have no Saturday evening games,
as the team will play away from
home on these dates.
Of last year's squad Rigliter, Moul
ton, Roney and Sullivan remain as a
nucleus for a team. Several promis
ing candidates arc making strong bids
for the team, among whom are Betts,
Johannesen and Moulton. The team
will be handicapped by the loss of
Russell Wilson, last year's coach, who
will not return this year. The squad
will be in the hands of the captain,
who will be chosen in the near fu
ture.
The freshmen will have a team in
the field, and from present indications
they should make a strong fight for
championship honors. Fairchild and
Devareaux have been showing fine
form in preliminary contests.
