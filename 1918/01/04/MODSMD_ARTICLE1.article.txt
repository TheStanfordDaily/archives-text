# TEAM WORK IS PLEA IN BUGGE'S MESSAGE TO R. O. T. C.
## ASKS MAINTAINANCE OF HIGH STANDARD Attempt Will Be Made to Secure Colonel Bolton to Conduct Corps 
### 
Voicing the sentiments which Major
I3ugge was unable to express in per
son, Lieutenant Colonel H. W. Ma
loney and Major R. O. Bullis, '18, of
the R. O. T. C., addressed the entire
officers' training corps in the Assem
by Hall yesterday afternoon. Colonel
Maloney told of the sudden arrival of
the telegram from General Pershing
in France summoning Major Bugge to
the front to become one of the mem
bers of General Pershing's personal
staff and advisory board, and empha
sized the necessity of team work and
a willing spirit on the part of every
member of the training corps if Stan
ford were to retain during the ab
sence of its leader, its position of dis
tinction among colleges giving mili
tary training. Major Bullis spoke for
a few minutes and emphasized the ne
cessity for every one pulling together
if Stanford's military reputation were
to be maintained.
Bugge Hoped for Appointment
"Appointment to the position on
General Pershing's staff," Colonel
Maloney said, "had been the hope of
Major Bugge ever since the beginning
of the war with Germany and he had
trained the student officers to handle
important positions in case of his call
into active service, without their
knowledge of the fact that he was
likely to be called. Great as is the
loss to Stanford and to the local R. O.
T. C., it must be borne cheerfully
with the realization that Major Bugge
will be doing a far greater service
across the Atlantic." Major Bugge
and General Pershing were lieuten
ant instructors together at West
Point.
Colonel Maloney urged every man
in the R. O. T. C. to do his part in
making things go until a successor to
Major Bugge could be secured. Pres
ident Wilbur has telegraphed Wash
ington asking for the appointment of
Colonel Bolton, retired, of the Bth In
fantry to the position of military in
structor here, but owing to the crowd
ed condition of affairs in the War De
partment, it may be some time before
official action can be taken.
Maloney is Temporary Head
Maloney and the student officers
will handle the training of the corps.
At the close of his talk, Maloney read
a letter written by Major Bugge to
the members of the R. O. T. C. It
reads as follows:
Dear Friends: —
If there is any regret connected
with my having received orders to go
to France, it is the circumstance that
prevents my seeing my boys once
more and talking to them instead of
putting what I have to say in writing.
It is very kind of so many of you
to think that no one can quite fill my
place at Stanford. 1 should be very
unusual were 1 not pleased over the
compliment, but if you will stop to
think, you will realize that it is not
going to make any difference, because
you are going to work so much harder
that the final result is going to be the
same anyway.
Team Work Necessary
for Efficiency
In military life we are constantly
losing one leader and acquiring an
other, hut if there exists the proper
team work, the machine will go on
with the same efficiency. This is just
what I have had in view all during the
first quarter because it has always
been a possibility that I might be
ordered away. That is why the men
who took the training last year have
done all the drilling and a good part
of the instruction. They must now do
more of it.
Where the proper spirit exists there
cannot be failure. We were in the
distinguished class last year and we
are going to be there this year, and
every one of you are going to have
his share in the result. Were we to
fail now, all my work will have been
for nothing, because the leader who
cannot form a better organization
than that it must fail when he is not
at the helm, has built very poorly.
High Compliment Paid
To tell me that I am highly indis
pensible is a high compliment, but
it you really want to do something
which will appeal to me much more,
you will make up your minds right
now that the 11. O. T. C. of Stanford
is going to do better than ever during
the next two quarters. You have done
well thus far, but there is always
room for improvement and a little
greater effort on the part of every
man will have a wonderful result in
the average, and it is the average that
really counts.
If you ever command men and you
get to a point where you feel a man
is indispensible, start training an
other man for the job at once.
Remember your motto: Honor,
Loyalty, Patriotism. Live up to it,
110 matter what the conditions. I feel
sure that you will give the same loyal
support to my successor. I expect
it, and I know you will give it.
Stanford demands the best you have
and if you are made of the stuff that
I imagine, you will not fall short.
Keep in mind that the greatest prob
lem of the ages is being solved 011 the
western front and rejoice with me in
my opportunity.
Boost for R. O. T. C.
Before saying "an revoir," let me
once more touch 011 my hobby—let
me remind you to be "boosters" for
Stanford, for the R. O. T. C. and for
anything else in which you take part.
It comes back with manifold interest.
Then, again, you keep in mind the
one great thing that all good citizens
must learn —that service to the many
is what really counts. Have ideals
and then do not be afraid to live up
to them. Moral courage is one of the
things needed in our present day
problems more than any other quality.
Cultivate it.
Before closing I want to say that
I thank you for the very pretty lov
ing cup presented to me. Both Mrs.
Bugge and myself shall treasure it
highly.
I hope that each and every one of
you will feel that you have a personal
friend in me. I shall be interested in
(lie success of every one of you and
the best I can wish is that you may
acquire that Stanford spirit which de
served success alone will satisfy.

a few minutes and emphasized the ne

if Stanford's military reputation were
to be maintained.
Bugge Hoped for Appointment
"Appointment to the position on
General Pershing's staff," Colonel
Maloney said, "had been the hope of
Major Bugge ever since the beginning
of the war with Germany and he had
trained the student officers to handle
important positions in case of his call
into active service, without their
knowledge of the fact that he was
likely to be called. Great as is the
loss to Stanford and to the local R. O.
T. C., it must be borne cheerfully
with the realization that Major Bugge
will be doing a far greater service
across the Atlantic." Major Bugge
and General Pershing were lieuten
ant instructors together at West
Point.
Colonel Maloney urged every man
in the R. O. T. C. to do his part in
making things go until a successor to
Major Bugge could be secured. Pres
ident Wilbur has telegraphed Wash
ington asking for the appointment of
Colonel Bolton, retired, of the Bth In
fantry to the position of military in
structor here, but owing to the crowd
ed condition of affairs in the War De
partment, it may be some time before
official action can be taken.
Maloney is Temporary Head
Maloney and the student officers
will handle the training of the corps.
At the close of his talk, Maloney read
a letter written by Major Bugge to
the members of the R. O. T. C. It
reads as follows:
Dear Friends: —
If there is any regret connected
with my having received orders to go
to France, it is the circumstance that
prevents my seeing my boys once
more and talking to them instead of
putting what I have to say in writing.
It is very kind of so many of you
to think that no one can quite fill my
place at Stanford. 1 should be very
unusual were 1 not pleased over the
compliment, but if you will stop to
think, you will realize that it is not
going to make any difference, because
you are going to work so much harder
that the final result is going to be the
same anyway.
Team Work Necessary
for Efficiency
In military life we are constantly
losing one leader and acquiring an
other, hut if there exists the proper
team work, the machine will go on
with the same efficiency. This is just
what I have had in view all during the
first quarter because it has always
been a possibility that I might be
ordered away. That is why the men
who took the training last year have
done all the drilling and a good part
of the instruction. They must now do
more of it.
Where the proper spirit exists there
cannot be failure. We were in the
distinguished class last year and we
are going to be there this year, and
every one of you are going to have
his share in the result. Were we to
fail now, all my work will have been
for nothing, because the leader who
cannot form a better organization
than that it must fail when he is not
at the helm, has built very poorly.
High Compliment Paid
To tell me that I am highly indis
pensible is a high compliment, but
it you really want to do something
which will appeal to me much more,
you will make up your minds right
now that the 11. O. T. C. of Stanford
is going to do better than ever during
the next two quarters. You have done
well thus far, but there is always
room for improvement and a little
greater effort on the part of every
man will have a wonderful result in
the average, and it is the average that
really counts.
If you ever command men and you
get to a point where you feel a man
is indispensible, start training an
other man for the job at once.
Remember your motto: Honor,
Loyalty, Patriotism. Live up to it,
110 matter what the conditions. I feel
sure that you will give the same loyal
support to my successor. I expect
it, and I know you will give it.
Stanford demands the best you have
and if you are made of the stuff that
I imagine, you will not fall short.
Keep in mind that the greatest prob
lem of the ages is being solved 011 the
western front and rejoice with me in
my opportunity.
Boost for R. O. T. C.
Before saying "an revoir," let me
once more touch 011 my hobby—let
me remind you to be "boosters" for
Stanford, for the R. O. T. C. and for
anything else in which you take part.
It comes back with manifold interest.
Then, again, you keep in mind the
one great thing that all good citizens
must learn —that service to the many
is what really counts. Have ideals
and then do not be afraid to live up
to them. Moral courage is one of the
things needed in our present day
problems more than any other quality.
Cultivate it.
Before closing I want to say that
I thank you for the very pretty lov
ing cup presented to me. Both Mrs.
Bugge and myself shall treasure it
highly.
I hope that each and every one of
you will feel that you have a personal
friend in me. I shall be interested in
(lie success of every one of you and
the best I can wish is that you may
acquire that Stanford spirit which de
served success alone will satisfy.

At the close of his talk, Maloney read
a letter written by Major Bugge to
the members of the R. O. T. C. It
reads as follows:
Dear Friends: —
If there is any regret connected
with my having received orders to go
to France, it is the circumstance that
prevents my seeing my boys once
more and talking to them instead of
putting what I have to say in writing.
It is very kind of so many of you
to think that no one can quite fill my
place at Stanford. 1 should be very
unusual were 1 not pleased over the
compliment, but if you will stop to
think, you will realize that it is not
going to make any difference, because
you are going to work so much harder
that the final result is going to be the
same anyway.
Team Work Necessary
for Efficiency
In military life we are constantly
losing one leader and acquiring an
other, hut if there exists the proper
team work, the machine will go on
with the same efficiency. This is just
what I have had in view all during the
first quarter because it has always
been a possibility that I might be
ordered away. That is why the men
who took the training last year have
done all the drilling and a good part
of the instruction. They must now do
more of it.
Where the proper spirit exists there
cannot be failure. We were in the
distinguished class last year and we
are going to be there this year, and
every one of you are going to have
his share in the result. Were we to
fail now, all my work will have been
for nothing, because the leader who
cannot form a better organization
than that it must fail when he is not
at the helm, has built very poorly.
High Compliment Paid
To tell me that I am highly indis
pensible is a high compliment, but
it you really want to do something
which will appeal to me much more,
you will make up your minds right
now that the 11. O. T. C. of Stanford
is going to do better than ever during
the next two quarters. You have done
well thus far, but there is always
room for improvement and a little
greater effort on the part of every
man will have a wonderful result in
the average, and it is the average that
really counts.
If you ever command men and you
get to a point where you feel a man
is indispensible, start training an
other man for the job at once.
Remember your motto: Honor,
Loyalty, Patriotism. Live up to it,
110 matter what the conditions. I feel
sure that you will give the same loyal
support to my successor. I expect
it, and I know you will give it.
Stanford demands the best you have
and if you are made of the stuff that
I imagine, you will not fall short.
Keep in mind that the greatest prob
lem of the ages is being solved 011 the
western front and rejoice with me in
my opportunity.
Boost for R. O. T. C.
Before saying "an revoir," let me
once more touch 011 my hobby—let
me remind you to be "boosters" for
Stanford, for the R. O. T. C. and for
anything else in which you take part.
It comes back with manifold interest.
Then, again, you keep in mind the
one great thing that all good citizens
must learn —that service to the many
is what really counts. Have ideals
and then do not be afraid to live up
to them. Moral courage is one of the
things needed in our present day
problems more than any other quality.
Cultivate it.
Before closing I want to say that
I thank you for the very pretty lov
ing cup presented to me. Both Mrs.
Bugge and myself shall treasure it
highly.
I hope that each and every one of
you will feel that you have a personal
friend in me. I shall be interested in
(lie success of every one of you and
the best I can wish is that you may
acquire that Stanford spirit which de
served success alone will satisfy.

At the close of his talk, Maloney read
a letter written by Major Bugge to
the members of the R. O. T. C. It
reads as follows:
Dear Friends: —
If there is any regret connected
with my having received orders to go
to France, it is the circumstance that
prevents my seeing my boys once
more and talking to them instead of
putting what I have to say in writing.
It is very kind of so many of you
to think that no one can quite fill my
place at Stanford. 1 should be very
unusual were 1 not pleased over the
compliment, but if you will stop to
think, you will realize that it is not
going to make any difference, because
you are going to work so much harder
that the final result is going to be the
same anyway.
Team Work Necessary
for Efficiency
In military life we are constantly
losing one leader and acquiring an
other, hut if there exists the proper
team work, the machine will go on
with the same efficiency. This is just
what I have had in view all during the
first quarter because it has always
been a possibility that I might be
ordered away. That is why the men
who took the training last year have
done all the drilling and a good part
of the instruction. They must now do
more of it.
Where the proper spirit exists there
cannot be failure. We were in the
distinguished class last year and we
are going to be there this year, and
every one of you are going to have
his share in the result. Were we to
fail now, all my work will have been
for nothing, because the leader who
cannot form a better organization
than that it must fail when he is not
at the helm, has built very poorly.
High Compliment Paid
To tell me that I am highly indis
pensible is a high compliment, but
it you really want to do something
which will appeal to me much more,
you will make up your minds right
now that the 11. O. T. C. of Stanford
is going to do better than ever during
the next two quarters. You have done
well thus far, but there is always
room for improvement and a little
greater effort on the part of every
man will have a wonderful result in
the average, and it is the average that
really counts.
If you ever command men and you
get to a point where you feel a man
is indispensible, start training an
other man for the job at once.
Remember your motto: Honor,
Loyalty, Patriotism. Live up to it,
110 matter what the conditions. I feel
sure that you will give the same loyal
support to my successor. I expect
it, and I know you will give it.
Stanford demands the best you have
and if you are made of the stuff that
I imagine, you will not fall short.
Keep in mind that the greatest prob
lem of the ages is being solved 011 the
western front and rejoice with me in
my opportunity.
Boost for R. O. T. C.
Before saying "an revoir," let me
once more touch 011 my hobby—let
me remind you to be "boosters" for
Stanford, for the R. O. T. C. and for
anything else in which you take part.
It comes back with manifold interest.
Then, again, you keep in mind the
one great thing that all good citizens
must learn —that service to the many
is what really counts. Have ideals
and then do not be afraid to live up
to them. Moral courage is one of the
things needed in our present day
problems more than any other quality.
Cultivate it.
Before closing I want to say that
I thank you for the very pretty lov
ing cup presented to me. Both Mrs.
Bugge and myself shall treasure it
highly.
I hope that each and every one of
you will feel that you have a personal
friend in me. I shall be interested in
(lie success of every one of you and
the best I can wish is that you may
acquire that Stanford spirit which de
served success alone will satisfy.
(Signed) JENS BUGGE.
