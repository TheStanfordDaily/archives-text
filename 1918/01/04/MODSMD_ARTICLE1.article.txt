# TEAM WORK IS PLEA IN BUGGE'S MESSAGE TO R. O. T. C.
## ASKS MAINTAINANCE OF HIGH STANDARD Attempt Will Be Made to Secure Colonel Bolton to Conduct Corps 
### 
Voicing the sentiments which Major
I3ugge was unable to express in per
son, Lieutenant Colonel H. W. Ma
loney and Major R. O. Bullis, '18, of
the R. O. T. C., addressed the entire
officers' training corps in the Assem
by Hall yesterday afternoon. Colonel
Maloney told of the sudden arrival of
the telegram from General Pershing
in France summoning Major Bugge to
the front to become one of the mem
bers of General Pershing's personal
staff and advisory board, and empha
sized the necessity of team work and
a willing spirit on the part of every
member of the training corps if Stan
ford were to retain during the ab
sence of its leader, its position of dis
tinction among colleges giving mili
tary training. Major Bullis spoke for
a few minutes and emphasized the ne
cessity for every one pulling together
if Stanford's military reputation were
to be maintained.
Bugge Hoped for Appointment
"Appointment to the position on
General Pershing's staff," Colonel
Maloney said, "had been the hope of
Major Bugge ever since the beginning
of the war with Germany and he had
trained the student officers to handle
important positions in case of his call
into active service, without their
knowledge of the fact that he was
likely to be called. Great as is the
loss to Stanford and to the local R. O.
T. C., it must be borne cheerfully
with the realization that Major Bugge
will be doing a far greater service
across the Atlantic." Major Bugge
and General Pershing were lieuten
ant instructors together at West
Point.
Colonel Maloney urged every man
in the R. O. T. C. to do his part in
making things go until a successor to
Major Bugge could be secured. Pres
ident Wilbur has telegraphed Wash
ington asking for the appointment of
Colonel Bolton, retired, of the Bth In
fantry to the position of military in
structor here, but owing to the crowd
ed condition of affairs in the War De
partment, it may be some time before
official action can be taken.
Maloney is Temporary Head
Maloney and the student officers
will handle the training of the corps.
At the close of his talk, Maloney read
a letter written by Major Bugge to
the members of the R. O. T. C. It
reads as follows:
