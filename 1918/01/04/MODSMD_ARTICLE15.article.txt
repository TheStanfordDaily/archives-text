# WAKE UP STANFORD!
## 
### 
President Wilbur's statement in last night's edition of The Daily Palo
Alto to the effect that Stanford is doing less in war-time activities than
many other universities came somewhat as a surprise to the majority of
students. We have all been inclined to think that Stanford was well up
toward the head of the procession in this respect.
Stanford has sent more of her men to join the colors than many uni
versities and President Wilbur realizes this. His criticism is not of the
men and women who are already in service but of those who remain at
home. He is right when he says that Stanford is not living up to war
time responsibilities right here on the campus. Stanford people just like
the "ninety-nine million" of whom Dr. Wilbur spoke are asleep. Few of
us belong to the "one million" who have awakened to the tremendous im
portance of the outcome of the battle now waging on the western front to
the lives of every person in this country.
Every man and woman in the University, therefore, should look ahead
and prepare himself now to be of the most service to his country. Mili
tary training will be the means for many, but mechanicians, engineers, doc
tors, nurses and university-trained specialists in many fields are needed for
war service just as much as soldiers by the government, both at the front
and here in our own country. The University stands ready to prepare men
and women in these branches and the part of the undergraduates is to de
cide where they can be of the most service and then to train accordingly.
There is no necessity to cut out any necessary student activity, and this
was not Dr. Wilbur's idea, but large expenditures of money and time cannot
be justified in view of the war-time necessity ol' Hooverizing both.
Wake up, Stanford!
