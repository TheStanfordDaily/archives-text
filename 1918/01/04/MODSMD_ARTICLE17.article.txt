# ENCINA COURTS ARE BEING PUT IN SHAPE
## 
### 
Encina tennis courts are to be im
proved by the erection of a set of. new
posts. The old posts were of wood
and have been torn up, to be replaced
by more modern ones which are soon
to be set. Since these posts from one
of the two courts have been taken out
the remaining courts have been too
small to accommodate all the players,
so that the new posts will be appre
ciated.
