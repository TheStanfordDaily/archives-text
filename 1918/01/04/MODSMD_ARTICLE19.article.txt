The registration of the Law School
shows a considerable decrease from
last quarter. There are now 44 law
majors and 35 registered in the pre
legal department. At the first of last
quarter there were 91 taking law and
70 pre-legal. As the registration is not
yet complete, the preesnt figures may
be increased somewhat.
