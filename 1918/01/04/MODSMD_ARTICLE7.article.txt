# STANFORD PSYCHOLOGY TESTS ADOPTED BY ARMY
## STANFORD PROFESSOR IS ORIGINATOR Professor Terman Is Author of New Mental Tests for U. S. Soldiers 
### 
Extension of psychological tests to
the entire army has been ordered by
the Secretary of War as a result of
extensive experiments by Associate
Professor Lewis M. Terman of the
Stanford School of Education. This
means that in the future every soldier
will be given a test of "general in
telligence" as an aid to the committee
en classification of personnel in as
signing him to tasks which fit his
abilities.
The system of tests in use is one
which Professor Terman helped to de
vise during the last summer, and is
based largely on an intelligence scale
worked out during the last two years
by Arthur S. Otis and Terman for
testing school children.
Trying Out the Tests.
During the past four months the
tests have been given a thorough trial
by their application in four national
army camps to 150,000 men of all
ranks. They have been of great value
not only in finding feeble-minded cases
and those of borderline intelligence,
but still more in locating men whose
superior intelligence made them suit
able material for commissioned of
ficers.
In view of the possible extension,
Professor Terman and his students
have been making investigations at
Stanford for some time. Six thousand
individuals have been given the test,
chiefly school children, in order to
establish age-standards of mental
ability, and to secure data for the fur
ther revision of the tests. Seven
hundred people were given the mili
tary test who had been previously
tested by the Stanford Revision of the
Binet-Simon intelligence scale. The
findings from the two methods were
largely identical.
Among those who are helping in
Ihe work are Kolis, Howard, Proctor,
Stockton, Dickson, Cowdrey, Barr,
Buckles, and Rockwell of the Depart
ment of Education, and Fearing of
the Psychological department. Nor
ton, Roberts, and Houser have been
serving in the army as psychological
examiners, and Otis is in charge of
the statistical work for the entire
undertaking.
