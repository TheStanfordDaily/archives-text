# "BATTALION, ATTENTION!"
## 
### 
An entire additional company is needed to complete the battalion of
the Stanford R. O. T. C. Without this company battalion drill cannot be
taught with maximum efficiency. Aside from this practical consideration
it would seem at the present critical moment in the nation's existence, in
spite of the reduction in the number of men in the University, that at least
enough men to make up one full battalion would show a desire to keep in
military training.
Certainly those who have never had any training before should con
sider it a real duty to prepare themselves through the drill and other in
struction of the R. 0. T. C. for whatever branch of service they may be
called upon to enter. This applies to upperclassmen no less than under
classmen and the matter of whether or not each individual taking military
can get academic credit for it is after all a pretty small matter when
the vital necessity for such training is considered.
Men out for athletics should not consider participation in sports an
excuse for not signing up for drill as provision is made for them in the
11 o'clock morning class.
When the command "Battalion, attention!" is given tomorrow, may
there be a full-sized battalion on hand to respond and not one that is shy
a company.
