first —We have been established for 13
years, and are an incorporated State Savings
and Commercial liank, operating under the
strongest State Bank Law of any State in
the United States, and are subject to most
careful scrutiny and rigid examinations of
the State Banking Department.
Second —The State Bank Law is incompar
ably stronger than the National Bank Law,
especially so far as Savings depositors are
concerned. It is a new law drawn by the
late Governor Johnson progressive legislature,
and modeled after the New York and Massa
chusetts Savings Bank Laws, with many safe
guards added. The public is not yet generally
aware of its protective features. Under its
rules, our Savings Bank must secure with
collateral, your deposits, when loaning its
funds, the law specifically defining the secur
ity we must take. No such provision exists
either in the National or Commercial Bank
laws. Thus the word Savings printed on out
advertising and stationery means Security to
y Third—All our Cash on hand is fully in
sured against liurglary and hold up, so that
this bank in case of Robbery could not lose.
But in addition to this we carry two bottles
ol hitfli powered chemicals in our safe, which
any explosion would break and the fumes
would prevent the criminals from securing
tiie money. .
Fourth —Our Officers, who have the custody
of the Bank's funds, are all bonded in the
American Surety Co. of New York, so that
the Hank is protected against possible loss
both from within and without.

conservative Finance Committee before they
are made, and all Real Estate must be ap
praised at twice the value of the amount
loaned on same.

itors in its Capital and Surplus. Our bank lias
greater capital and Surplus in proportion to
its deposit liability, than any other bank in
Santa Clara County. .
Ninth —Being the only Bank in Maytield,
and without competition, our management is
not tempted to take chances on loans; a sit
uation always likely to arise where two or
more rival Banks are fighting for business.

Bankers Association and also the California
State Bankers Association which gives us ad
ditional protection, as well as the paid services
of the Burns National Detective Agency to

safe as though invested in a Government
