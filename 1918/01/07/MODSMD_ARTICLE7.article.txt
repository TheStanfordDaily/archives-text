# Government Calls Professor Terman
## Noted Educator Leaves for Washington to Perfect His Army Test 
### 
As a result of the adoption of psy
chological tests by the United States
army, Professor Lewis M. Terman of
the Stanford School of Education has
been summoned to Washington by a
telegram from the War Department.
He left for San Francisco at noon to
day on way to the East.
Professor Terman is not yet sure
of the nature of the work he will be
required to do there, nut said today
that he expected it to be along the
line of a further revision of the tests
to suit the needs of tne army. The
tests were largely worked out by Pro
fessor Otis and others of the Stan
ford School of Education, but to Pro
fessor Terman is due credit for the
experiments which made possible the
application of the tests on so large
a scale. The adoption of the tests to
the entire army is a huge undertak
ing which will require a large admin
istrative force. Their application will
be a great help to army officials in de
termining the kind of work that each
individual soldier is mentally fitted
to undertake. Professor Terman will
remain in Washington only long
enough to get the movement started
and expects to return to his duties at
Stanford some time next month.
