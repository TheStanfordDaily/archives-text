NOTICE TO DEPOSITORS
As a depositor of this Bank you' are inter
ested, and entitled to know, the safeguards
we have adopted for the protection of your
funds.
First —We have been established for 13
years, and are an incorporated State Savings
and Commercial Bank, operating under the
strongest State Bank Law of any State in
the United States, and are subject to most
careful scrutiny and rigid examinations of
the State Banking Department.
Second —The State Bank Law is incompar
ably stronger than the National Bank Law,
especially so far as Savings depositors arc
concerned. It is a new law drawn by the
late Governor Tohnson progressive legislature,
and modeled after the New York and Massa
chusetts Savings Bank Laws, with many safe
guards added. The public is not yet generally
aware of its protective features. Under its
rules, our Savings Bank must secure with
collateral, your deposits, when loaning its
funds, tlie law specifically defining the secur
ity we mu'st take. No such provision exists
either in the National or Commercial Bank
laws. Thus the word Savings printed on our
advertising and stationery means Security to
you. , , , ...
Third —All our Cash on hand is fully in
sured against Burglary and hold up, so that
this bank in case of Robbery could not lose.
But in addition to this we carry two bottles
oi high powered chemicals in our safe, which
any explosion would break and the fumes
would prevent the criminals from securing
the money. ... t
Fourth —Our Officers, who have the custody
of the Bank's funds, are all bonded m the
American Surety Co. of New York, so that
the Bank is protected against possible loss
both from within and without.
Fifth—Our building and fixtures are all
adequately protected against fire, and we also
carry Employers liability and compensation in
surance on our employes.
Sixth—Our vault is modern and fireproof,
and our money safe is equipped with the best
three clock time lock.
Seventh —Our loans arc all approved by r>
conservative Finance Committee before they
arc made, and all Real Instate must be ap
praised at twice the value of the amount
loaned on same. ,
Eighth—A bunk's real security to its depos
itors in its Capital and Surplus. Our bank has
greater capital and Surplus in proportion to
its deposit liability, than any other bank in
Santa Clara County. ,
Ninth —Being the only Bank 111 Maynela,
arid without competition, our management is
not tempted to take chances on loans; a sit
uation always likelv to arise where two or
more rival Banks are fighting for business.
Tenth —We arc members of the American
Bankers Association rind also the California
State Bankers Association which gives us ad
ditional protection, as well as the paid services
of the Burns National Detective Agency to
run down any criminals operating against us.
Eleventh —Any statement contained herein
can be verified by addressing the State Super
intendent of Banks, San Francisco, to whom
we respectfully refer. .
Twelfth—All -banks do not guard their de
positors with the same safeguards Ihe May
field Bank does. Are you doing all your
business with us? Or part of it with some
bank which docs not protect you so ade
quately? Your money on deposit with us is as
safe as though invested in a Government
Bond. .
We make no charge on checking accounts.
