forwards in team work, but fell down
at goal throwing.

ford vinning only in the last five
minutes of play.
The score at half-time stood 12 to
12. with both fives displaying excel

passing of the army men was partic

ball up the court several times, tak
ing it right from under the Cardinal
basket. The Stanford men displayed
a good deal of fight, but were a little
weak on goal throwing in the first
half. Hood at forward was the best
shot on the floor up until half-time,
with two field goals and two free
goals to his credit. Moulton, playing
the other forward position, tossed two
baskets, and Sullivan, at running
guard, threw one. In the second half
Moulton was the star performer,
throwing four field goals and one
foul, bringing his total up to six field
and two free goals. Sullivan added
another basket and Schwarzenbek,
who replaced Carver at center, drop
ped in two shots for his account.
Russell and Davis, forwards on th?
array quintet, excelled the Stanford
forwards in team work, but fell down
at goal throwing.
The Stanford team was minus the
services of "Swede" Righter, who has
left college. Carver and Scbwarzen
bek are the two most prominent can
didates for his position as center.
The army team was composed of
men who have been in the service for
some time, and who have lately re
turned from the Philippine Islands.
They were champions of the Islands,
and under the leadership of Captain
Connelley, playing guard, won many
victories. Wifield at running guard
is the only man on the team with
university experience. He played for
two years at the University of Wash
