# TRACK SEASON TO OPEN WITH SIGN-UP RALLY
## NO COACH NAMED YET Success of Track Depends Upon Support Given by Student Body 
### 
When the red fire ol' Thursday's
sign-up rally clears away, the cam
pus will get its first perspective of
what athletics will be at Stanford
this year. Baseball and track men
are to sign up Thursday eevning and
will start their active work Friday.
Although the military fever right*
fully holds the campus in its grip, it
is pointed out that athletics still have
a place in the college world.
Track men especially will find am
ple opportunity to attend the military
(•lasses and train for their favorite
event as well. Any time of the day
will do for track training, although
the majority of the candidates will
probably be on hand late each after
noon. R. L. Templeton, '18, has vol
unteered his services as coach until
he is called into the aviation service.
Present prospects are uncertain,
but the nucleus of a good team is in
college, an da victory against the Blue
and Gold ought to result, providing
the team gets its deserved suppcrt.

what athletics will be at Stanford
this year. Baseball and track men

a place in the college world.
Track men especially will find am
ple opportunity to attend the military
(•lasses and train for their favorite
event as well. Any time of the day

probably be on hand late each after
noon. R. L. Templeton, '18, has vol
unteered his services as coach until

pus will get its first perspective of

this year. Baseball and track men
are to sign up Thursday eevning and

fully holds the campus in its grip, it
is pointed out that athletics still have
a place in the college world.
Track men especially will find am
ple opportunity to attend the military
(•lasses and train for their favorite
event as well. Any time of the day
will do for track training, although
