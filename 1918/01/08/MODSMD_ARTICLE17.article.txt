# HOOVERIZING JUNIOR WEEK
## 
### 
Juniors are to be congratulated on their modified plans ror a war-time
Junior Week. No one wants to see any essential part of the annual spring
time festivities done away with entirely, and the only difficulty has been
to know just where to draw the line.
There will be little regret at the elimination of the fireworks on the
lake. These cost a great deal and in our opinion have never justified the
expenditure. By all means keep the aquatic sports on Lagunita. These cost
practically nothing and make up one of the most interesting and charac
teristic features of the Junior Week program. Even if the powers that be
fail to grant the usual Junior Day holiday, provision can be made for
them in connection with Founders' Day, which comes the clay after the
Prom.
Both Prom and opera have been wisely retained, but are to be put
on a war-time basis. Decorations should be minimized even to the point
of doing away with them entirely. Refreshments and fancy programs can
also go by the boards without loss, which leaves music the only necessary
evil. The question of dress suits is not a vital consideration, as no sane
collegian will buy full dress for this one party.
A light opera minus expensive sets and costumes would not fail to
prove popular and would come within the limits of Hooverization. Pro
fessional coaching could be dispensed with and a student-written, student
directed opera could be presented at a much more reasonable cost than
those of former years.
