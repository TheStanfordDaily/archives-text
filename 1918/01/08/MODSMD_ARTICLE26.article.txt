# FREMONT OFFICERS TO LIVE IN ENCINA HALL
## 
### 
By almost unanimous acclamation
the Encina Club voted last night to
allow the management to rent vacant
rooms in the Hall to army officers of
Camp Fremont. No distinction is to
be made in the rank of the officers.
Array officers at the camp are hav
ing difficulty in finding accommoda
tions in Palo Alto and at Menlo
Park. A large number have stated
their desire to live in the University
community, and already have rented
one of the vacated fraternity houses
on the campus.
Members of Kappa Sigma have
rented their chapter nouse to twenty
six officers, since most of their mem
bers have entered we service. The
house will be closed ror at least the
remainder of this quarter. The re
maining seven members of the house
in the University are making their
temporary residence at. the Kappa
Alpha house.
