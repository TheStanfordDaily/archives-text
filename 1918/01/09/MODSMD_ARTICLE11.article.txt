' The entrance of our country into
this groat war, catastrophe though it
is, may yet prove a blessing in dis
guise, in awakening our national con
sciousness to our shortcomings and
failures. We have lost our sense of
honor; the war will bring it back to
us." This was the message of Rev.
Father Joseph M, Gleason of the St.
Thomas Aquinas Catholic church of
Palo Alto, in his lecture, "Some Mod
ern Problems," last night in the Lit
tle Theater.
Efficiency and success have been
the guiding motives of the past half
century, the speaker told his audi
ence, and Americans have felt tnf
blighting influence'.) of forgetting the
h glier things of life. The.l .l
States has been going the roa.' of

many great nations of the past, which
has led them to l heir downfall. The
sacredness of the family has to a
great extent been lost sight of, as is
shown by the prevalence of divorce,
particularly in the west. Lying has
become a line art, and the worship of
success has dulled our sense of com
mon honesty. "The greatest crime
consists in being caught," he said.
Turning to the political side of our
national life, Father Gleason con
demned the apathy of the "respect
able element," which, he said, is re
sponsible for the prevalent corruption
in politics. Much of our legal sys
tem is a hundred years behind the
times, and our naturalization laws are
a farce. The speaker denounced our
countenance of anarchy, and con
demned those in San Francisco who
have attempted to defend the per
petrators of the preparedness parade
bomb outrage. "We have lost our
respect for authority, morally, intel
lectually, politically, and nationally.'
was his statement.
"Democracy has never yet won a
war, nor carried a nation through a
great crisis," Father Gleason said, so
we rightfully delegate to the Presi
dent powers greater than have ever
before been exercised by a ruler in
this history of the world. But when
the crisis is past, we should see *o
it that these powers are not retained
Aroused by the shock of war from
our moral sleep, we are face to facÂ°
with these problems, greater than have
ever before been faced by a nation.
Upon every thinking man rests tin:
individual responsibility for their
solution. "If a man lets religion and
sincerity take possession of him, he
will be able to solve any problem
which may arise."
