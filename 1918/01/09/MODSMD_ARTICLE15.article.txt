# SEVEN COMPANIES ARE FORMED IN MILITARY
## BATTALION DRILL TO BE HELD MORNING ANO AFTERNOON 
### R.O.T.C. MEN 
Since the call for more men in the
R. O. T. C. was made last Monday, ap
proximately 70 new men have signed
for military bringing tlie lotal number
in the corps up to 355 men at noon to
day. This is only a few less than were
registered for military last quarter
and it will now be possible to have mil
itary as planned.
Colonel Maloney is well pleased
with the spirit shown by the men and
announces that there will be seven
companies this quarter, the same as
last. He asks that a few more men
come out for the morning companies
or transfer, if possible, from the after
noon section to the morning section,
so that there will be two full com
panies in the morning battalion. Bat
talion drill will be carried out in both
sections and almost enough men are
now signed in the eleven o'clock sec
tion to make two full companies.
The silver loving cup which the R.
O. T. C. purchased for presentation to
Major Bugge will arrive at the Gym
nasium tonight or tomorrow and will
be unpacked and put on exhibition in
time to be seen by the men taking
military in the afternoon companies.
