Another action taken by the Executive Committee yesterday evening
will meet with equal approval on the part of the University community at
large. This is the decision to put the election of members to till vacancies
in the Executive Committee up to the Student Body, thus abandoning the
closed corporation tendency of last quarter. Although technically the com
mittee has.a right to fill vacancies in its ranks, the present situation where
gaps occur frequently makes last night's action the only one consistent
with the Stanford ideal of student self-government.
