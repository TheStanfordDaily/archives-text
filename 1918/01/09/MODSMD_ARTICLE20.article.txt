H. V. Aupperle, ex-'l7, last year's
track captain, is in the Balkans at
present on Red Cross work. This in
formation was gained from a letter
written by him in Rome and received
here yesterday. "Aup" lets out the
usual dismal wail that is heard from
"over there" concerning the wretch
edness of French tobacco. He classi
fies it among the horrors of war.
Aupperle has already seen service in
Servia, but during the last month
he has been in France.
