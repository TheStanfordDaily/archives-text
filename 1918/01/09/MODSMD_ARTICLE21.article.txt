People of Stanford will be inter
ested in a hook, "Letters from a
Chasseur a Pied,"' by the late Pro
fessor Robert E. Pellissier, which has
recently been published. It is com
piled by the author's sister, Adeline
Pellissier, professor of French at
Smith College.
The book consists of the collected
letters of M. Pellissier from the time
when he gave up his assistant pro
fessorship of French at Stanford and
sailed for France to fight for his
country, until his death in active ser
vice in the Battle of the Somme.
There is also a preface by Mile.
Pellissier which tells of the high
ideals and the love of country, later
brought out by the letters themselves,
which Professor Pellissier lived and
died for with cheerful bravery.
As a personal record of the war
the book also has interest and value.
