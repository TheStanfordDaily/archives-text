# Searsville Galore for 1922 Freshmen

### 
Farm Superintendent J. E. Hewston
is farseeing as well as being an over
seer. He is already making plans
for the next Freshman rush. This
being a dry season there has been a
shortage of water from the Searsville
region and Mr. Hewston has determ
ined to alleviate the difficulty before
the new stock of "babes" make their
appearance upon the campus.
At present there is no water in the
Searsville dam and several men are
engaged in digging mud from the
overflow pipes. Mr. Hewston predicts
that when the great amount of sedi
ment now clogging the pipes is re
moved and the rains replenish the
lake there will be a greater amount
of water from the dam than the cam
pus or the Freshmen have heretofore
enjoyed.
In case the Searsville "aqua" does
not provide enough of the ablutionary
liquid, the Farm superintendent is
having some dry wells excavated.
The wells are at the bottom of a pit
which is now covered by a brick well
curb near the county road bridge, and
tradition has it that they were once
fine sixty-foot wells sparkling with
clear water.
