## STANFORD FIVE ANNEXES GAME, 31-26 Sullivan and Moulton Are Stars of Cardinal Goal Shooters 
### 
With but five points to spare, the
Stanford Varsity basketball team de
feated the Oakland Y. \I. C. A.
"Golds" at Encina Gymnasium last
night, by the score of 31 to 20.
Moulton and Captain Sullivan starred
for the Varsity, annexing 23 points
between them.
The Stanford five started out with
the idea of winning and piled up a
total of 12 points in the first half
against 9 made by the "Golds." Olaf

hard ones. His height enabled him
to prevent a good many shots, al
though the dexterity displayed by
Sullivan and Moulton counteracted
this to a large extent.
Captain Sullivan's team displayed
good form in passing and in team
