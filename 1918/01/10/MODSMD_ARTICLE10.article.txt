# VARSITY WINS CONTEST FROM OAKLAND Y.M.C.A.
## STANFORD FIVE ANNEXES GAME, 31-26 Sullivan and Moulton Are Stars of Cardinal Goal Shooters 
### 
With but five points to spare, the
Stanford Varsity basketball team de
feated the Oakland Y. \I. C. A.
"Golds" at Encina Gymnasium last
night, by the score of 31 to 20.
Moulton and Captain Sullivan starred
for the Varsity, annexing 23 points
between them.
The Stanford five started out with
the idea of winning and piled up a
total of 12 points in the first half
against 9 made by the "Golds." Olaf
son, forward for the visitors, was the
chief offender in the matter of point
gathering for the "Golds," as he drop
ped in the majority of shots for Oak
land, some of them being particularly
hard ones. His height enabled him
to prevent a good many shots, al
though the dexterity displayed by
Sullivan and Moulton counteracted
this to a large extent.
Captain Sullivan's team displayed
good form in passing and in team
work. Williamson and Schwarzenbek
worked out at center, with Carver
held in reserve. Hood was a little
out of form last night, since his ef
forts only resulted in one field goal
during the game, but he was always
evident in the passing rushes down
the court. Sullivan was the partic
ular thorn that the visitors ran
against, his agility in securing the
ball in mix-ups and pivoting out of
the reach of his opponents being par
ticularly noticeable.
Of the total number of field goals
made by Stanford, Captain Sullivan
and Moulton each shot six, with Hood,
Schwarzenbek, and Williamson each
securing one. Hood made one free
goal.
Olafson Scores for Visitors.
Olafson dropped four field goals in
for the "Golds," and two free goals.
Spencer annexed one, Eggleston two,
Brown two, and Captain Waddell se
cured three.
