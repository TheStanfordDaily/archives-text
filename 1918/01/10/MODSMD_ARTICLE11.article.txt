# Wilbur Denounces Hoover's Enemies
## Food Administrator Unjustly Attacked, He Claims; Taft Is Quoted 
### 
President Wilbur today came pub
licly to the defense of Herbert Hoover
against the attacks recently made on
him by the Senate subcommittee
headed by Senator Reed. Dr. Wilbur's
action took the form of comment on
and approval of a strong editorial
written by former President William
Howard Taft and published in the
Philadelphia Public Ledger, January
3, under the headline "Hoover a Vic
tim of Unjust Prejudice."
"I wish everyone could see and real
Mr. Taft's article, for it explains the
situation so clearly and so strongly
that it is noteworthy," said President
Wilbur. "I heartily approve it. It
is right along the lines which we have
been trying to set forth to the people
everywhere in the interest of food
conservation."
Kditorinl By Taft.
In the course of the editorial Mr.
Taft said:
"Herbert Hoover was certainly the
best equipped American for the task
of food conservation. . . . Mr. Hoover
has sought by all possible means to
bring home to the American people
the fact that if the food issue alone
cannot win the war it may lose it for
us. We must fight the war first with
money, then with food, and then with
bullets and shells. We are giving our
allies the money. That we have. We
can only give them the food they need
if we restrain our own appetites in
consuming wheat, meat, sugar, and
fats. Mr. Hoover is the man whose
word should be law with our people
in making these minor sacrifices.''
Subcommittee RefiiNes to ('nil Hoover.
Then the former President points
out how the subcommittee investi
gating the sugar shortage refused to
call Hoover as a witness but sum
moned a "witness deeply interested in
a selfish way in the refining and sale
of sugar," who "frames an indict
ment as sensational and as full of
appeal to popular prejudice as ho can
make it." The subcommittee refuses
to permit Hoover then to answer. Mr.
Hoover then sends to the committee
a defense in writing, which the com
mittee refuses to publish, though re
quested to do so by the President.
The President then publishes it him
self.
"Why was it necessary to treat
Mr. Hoover worse than a criminal un
der indictment? The reason seems
to lie the enmity against Mr. Hoover
felt by the chairman of the subcom
mittee. The chairman had attacked
Mr. Hoover personally and unjustly
when his name was sent by the Presi
dent to the Senate. The French say
that it takes a great man who baa
once done a consciously unjust tliinu,
to another ever to forgive that other.
This seems a ease in point. It is
fortunate for Mr. Hoover and 11 â– *?
country that the spirit of fairness <>l
the American people will make harm
less any adverse report coming fro u
a source apparently so prejudiced."
