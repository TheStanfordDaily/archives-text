# TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT!
## 
### 
Tonight's the big night! Spring sports will be off to a flying start if
the rally in Encina Hall this evening is attended the way it should be and
if the men of the University sign up for the various squads in propor
tionate numbers. Old-time "grads" will be on hand to liven up the Stan
ford spirit and brand-new captains will outline plans for a successful sea
son in their respective sports. The yell leaders will lie on hand to play
their part in directing the "pep" festival.
There is no excuse for a single man registered in the University to fail
to be present tonight. Make it a real Stanford rally, but do more than
merely be present and yell. Every man should sign up and go out for one
of the teams. Success in track and baseball depends almost altogether on
the number of men, new and old, who go to the rally tonight and sign up.
Tonight's the night!
