# Jordan Completes "Autobiography"
## Work of University's First President to Be Out After the War 
### 
Dr. Jordan's "Autobiography" lias
been completed and is awaiting re
vision, though it will not be pub
lished until after the war. The
World Hook Co. in New York will get
it out. The work will be published
in two large volumes, one dealing
with science and public work, and the
other with Dr. Jordan's twenty-six
years of activity in Stanford Univer
sity, the whole covering his life of G7
years.
Dr. Jordan's relations with Senator
and Mrs. Leland Stanford, as well as
his connection with the early tradi
tions of the University will make it
a valuable addition to Stanford his
tory, and of particular interest to the
Stanford community. Interesting ma
terial about the early days of the Uni
versity which has long been un
known or forgotten will appear in
the Autobiography.
"Democracy and World Relations,''
Dr. Jordan's most recent book, has
also been finished, and will be pub
lished in the spring by the World
Book Co., whose owner is a Stanford
alumnus, Caspar W. Hodgson, '9G.
