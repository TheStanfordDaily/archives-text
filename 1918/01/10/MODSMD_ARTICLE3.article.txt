# PEP, SPIRIT, AND JAZZ WILL PREDOMINATE AT SPRING SPORTS RALLY
## 
### 
From the opening "Hooray" for the
gathering of the crowd until the final
'Varsity* is yelled, pep and spirit prom
ise to overflow the Encina Club room
and to spread the contagion to the
rest of. the campus. The occasion is
the annual spring sign-up rally for the
purpose of sending the Cardinal teams
on their way to athletic victories. The
time is announced as 7:30 and the
speakers as the captains of the spring
teams, Harry Maloney, prominent
members of the alumni and others.
This is the first real appearance of
athletics so far this winter quarter,
and tlie large crowd expected to at
tend the rally will have explained to
them the relative importance of mili
tary training and athletics, and the
place for both in the college world.
Maloney probably will emphasize this
in his talk.
Opportunity to See New Captains.
The campus will have the first op
portunity of seeing the new captains
in their official capacities. "Ken"
Lilly, leader of the nine for the com

ing season, will talk and urge the men
to sign up for baseball. 'Art" Wilson
will tell the men of the track pros
pects and the duty of the student body
in this respect.
The alumni speakers have not been
announced yet, but it is probable that
J. F. English, '01, and F. E. Knox,
'95, will be the "old grad' orators.
English's speech at the last football
rally will be remembered for many
days by all who were there. Other
speakers probably will be on hand.
Sullivan Not to Talk.
Graduate Manager O. M. Sullivan,
'19, is unable to attend the rally be
cause of the California-Nevada Basket
ball League meeting, and will not
speak, as announced.
George Luhrs, '18, cheer leader, will
again stimulate the husky throats to
greater efforts. During the rally and
afterwards, the A. S. S. U. campaign
will be caried on, in the hopes of aug
menting the student body member
ship. Arrangements will be made for
the men to sign up for spring athletics
after the rally.
