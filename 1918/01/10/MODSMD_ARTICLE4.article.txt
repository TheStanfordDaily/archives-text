# "Balkan Unit Scattered to Winds"
## 
### 
"The bunch of ambulance men that
came back from the Balkans went
with the winds," to use the words of
Frank Taylor in a recent letter from
Paris. When the United States gov
ernment took over the American A m
bulance Service, the men in the Bal
kans were recalled to France, where
they separated and went into various
branches of service.
Carl Randau and Bill Losh were
appointed to the officers' training
school at Meaux. Aviation attracted
eight of those who went over with the
First and Second Stanford Ambulance
Units. They are Jimmy Patten, Ben
Curler, Spot Peck, Fauna Ferris, Ver
non Caughell, Harold Sayre, Mac Mc-
Leish, and Neil Petree. Some of the
men wished to see the western front
immediately, and went out to it while
still in the ambulance service. These
were Wully Wohlford, Walt Bruns,
Bill Rogers, Dusty Honens and Toad
Strong. Phil Davis secured a place in
the purchasing department, and Hal

Blote and Lee Skelton -returned to the
United States to get into some branch
of service here. Those remaining, Ed
Kneass, Harold Aupperle, and Harry
Frantz went back to Salonika in Red
Cross work for the Seib3.
