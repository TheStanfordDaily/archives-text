# "Balkan Unit Scattered to Winds"
## 
### 
"The bunch of ambulance men that
came back from the Balkans went
with the winds," to use the words of
Frank Taylor in a recent letter from
Paris. When the United States gov
ernment took over the American A m
bulance Service, the men in the Bal
kans were recalled to France, where
they separated and went into various
branches of service.
Carl Randau and Bill Losh were
appointed to the officers' training
school at Meaux. Aviation attracted
eight of those who went over with the
First and Second Stanford Ambulance
Units. They are Jimmy Patten, Ben
Curler, Spot Peck, Fauna Ferris, Ver
non Caughell, Harold Sayre, Mac Mc-
Leish, and Neil Petree. Some of the
men wished to see the western front
immediately, and went out to it while
still in the ambulance service. These
were Wully Wohlford, Walt Bruns,
Bill Rogers, Dusty Honens and Toad
Strong. Phil Davis secured a place in
the purchasing department, and Hal

Blote and Lee Skelton -returned to the
United States to get into some branch
of service here. Those remaining, Ed
Kneass, Harold Aupperle, and Harry
Frantz went back to Salonika in Red
Cross work for the Seib3.
Taylor to Remain in Paris
Prank Taylor was appointed to
write a history of American Field Serv
ice, and will remain in Paris for about
two months while completing it. He
writes:
"I am getting material ready for the
American Field Service history they
are going to put out, and will he busy
here for a couple months at the job.
[ figured on going out in a section 011
the French front until Major Andrews
hailed me for this work. Now I'll go
out as soon as the job is done. My
office is a room down in the Chalet in
the garden at 21 Rue Raynouard, a
j funny little Swiss building put up in
j 1825, and with a lot of coats of arms
i of all kinds 011 the outside. I under
stand that the place here is famous
historically, and was where Benjamin
Franklin and Rousseau and a lot of
others used to philosophize in the
days gone by. I haven't dug out the
history yet.
"The work won't be very hard, and
will give me some time to read and
study, but I'd hate to stay in Paris
permanently in war time. The nearer
the front you are, as a general thing,
the better you are off these days, be
lieve I."
Taylor writes that it is very lone
some in Paris, the Stanford group
having been so much together since
the time they left this side. He was
therefore very surprised and delight
ed when the night before he wrote
this letter Franklin Skeele and Wal
ter Humphries of Stanford burst in
upon him. He says, "Then, being as
how I hadn't seen them for six months
and they hadn't been in civilization
for four months, I hauled out my box
of Co-eds from my Christmas box,
which came yesterday, much early,
and they about cleaned 'em up. They
felt kind of repentant and hauled me
along to a big feed, the first one in
Paris on permission. Also I saw
"Madame Butterfly" the other night
at, the Opera, with Frank Arthur Kim
ber, who had just finished his avia
tion school course, and threw a big
party. T guess he couldn't find any
one el ;c so be took me.'

immediately, and went out to it while
still in the ambulance service. These
were Wully Wohlford, Walt Bruns,
Bill Rogers, Dusty Honens and Toad
Strong. Phil Davis secured a place in
the purchasing department, and Hal

Blote and Lee Skelton -returned to the
United States to get into some branch
of service here. Those remaining, Ed
Kneass, Harold Aupperle, and Harry
Frantz went back to Salonika in Red
Cross work for the Seib3.
Taylor to Remain in Paris
Prank Taylor was appointed to
write a history of American Field Serv
ice, and will remain in Paris for about
two months while completing it. He
writes:
"I am getting material ready for the
American Field Service history they
are going to put out, and will he busy
here for a couple months at the job.
[ figured on going out in a section 011
the French front until Major Andrews
hailed me for this work. Now I'll go
out as soon as the job is done. My
office is a room down in the Chalet in
the garden at 21 Rue Raynouard, a
j funny little Swiss building put up in
j 1825, and with a lot of coats of arms
i of all kinds 011 the outside. I under
stand that the place here is famous
historically, and was where Benjamin
Franklin and Rousseau and a lot of
others used to philosophize in the
days gone by. I haven't dug out the
history yet.
"The work won't be very hard, and
will give me some time to read and
study, but I'd hate to stay in Paris
permanently in war time. The nearer
the front you are, as a general thing,
the better you are off these days, be
lieve I."
Taylor writes that it is very lone
some in Paris, the Stanford group
having been so much together since
the time they left this side. He was
therefore very surprised and delight
ed when the night before he wrote
this letter Franklin Skeele and Wal
ter Humphries of Stanford burst in
upon him. He says, "Then, being as
how I hadn't seen them for six months
and they hadn't been in civilization
for four months, I hauled out my box
of Co-eds from my Christmas box,
which came yesterday, much early,
and they about cleaned 'em up. They
felt kind of repentant and hauled me
along to a big feed, the first one in
Paris on permission. Also I saw
"Madame Butterfly" the other night
at, the Opera, with Frank Arthur Kim
ber, who had just finished his avia
tion school course, and threw a big
party. T guess he couldn't find any
one el ;c so be took me.'
"The bunch of ambulance men that
came back from the Balkans went
with the winds," to use the words of
Frank Taylor in a recent letter from
Paris. When the United States gov
ernment took over the American A m
bulance Service, the men in the Bal
kans were recalled to France, where
they separated and went into various
branches of service.
Carl Randau and Bill Losh were
appointed to the officers' training
school at Meaux. Aviation attracted
eight of those who went over with the
First and Second Stanford Ambulance
Units. They are Jimmy Patten, Ben
Curler, Spot Peck, Fauna Ferris, Ver
non Caughell, Harold Sayre, Mac Mc-
Leish, and Neil Petree. Some of the
