# TRYOUTS FOR 1920 QUAD BEGIN
## 
### 
Editor S. E. Briggs of the 1919
Quad has announced that tryouts for
the 1920 year-book have commenced,
and that Sophomore tryoutees should
communicate with him any evening
this week between 7 and 8 o'clock, in
Room 40G, Encina. Preliminary as
signments are ready for the candi
dates for the editorship, and it is
urged that all who can show up do
so, to enlarge the field of choice and
lessen the work of each tryoutee.

For the benefit of those who are
doubting the possibility of a Quad
next, year, the present management
points out that as long as Stanford
keeps open its doors, tradition and
custom, as well as necessity, demand
some sort of a review of the year's
activities, and the Quad meets this
demand, hi other words, as long as
Stanford remains open there will be
a Quad published.
