## 
###

against 16 per cent in 191.5-16.
"On the other hand, the retrograde
movement among women students,
which was noted in 1915-10," says the
report, "has continued, the percent
age of failures among them for 1916-
17 being 3.2 as against 2.3 for 1915-16."
It will be noted, however, that the
percentage of women failing is small
as compared with that of the men.
