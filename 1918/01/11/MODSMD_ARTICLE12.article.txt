"It is better to work for $75 a
month at something in which yon are
contented than to work for $150 at
something you do not care for," de
clared Mrs. Elizabeth Snell, the Ap
pointment Secretary, in a talk before
the Educational Club on "Vocations,"
yesterday afternoon in the Women's
Club House.
The principal objection to women
entering into vocational fields is that
they do not put the same degree of
interest into their work as the men.
They generally do not consider their
profession as a permanent asset.
Properly trained, efficient women are
in great demand now to fill the posi
tions left by the men in service. This
is a golden opportunity for women to
prove their true worth and compe
tence in the business world.
