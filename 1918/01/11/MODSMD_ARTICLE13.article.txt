# Bananas to be Given Poor in Maryland
## 
### 
Due to delay to the steamship Vika
of the United Fruit Company, caused
by ice in Chesapeake Hay, the 18,000
bunches of bananas it carried have
become unsaleable through regular
channels and have been offered to the
Maryland food administration by a
telegram sent to Herbert E. Hoover,
National Food Administrator, last
Monday. The fruit offered is too ripe
for sale on the market, and hence the
2,00(1,000 bananas will be distributed
among the poor in Maryland.
