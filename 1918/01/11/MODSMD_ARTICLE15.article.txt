# CHANGE IN COLLEGES TO RESULT FROM WAR
## Wilbur Says Men Will Come Back With Demands for New Courses 
### 
Universities, after the war, will very
likely have to readjust their methods
and courses considerably as a result
of changed opinions formed by the
young men of the nation as to certain
phases of the American educational
system, is the opinion of President
Wilbur as expressed in his forthcom
ing annual report to the Board of
1 rustees.
Stanford has no barriers to prevent
its development to meet these needs
of the times. Dr. Wilbur points out.
"The changes that accompany and will
follow this war will present many op
portunities for a constructive educa
tional work of the greatest value to
our country," he says.
Meet Needs of Times.
Under the subject of "War and Ed
ucation," Dr. Wilbur writes:
"One of the striking experiences
associated with the beginning of the
war and the introduction of intensive
military training lias been the analysis
which thousands of young men have
been led to make of their previous ed
ucational work when stirred by a de
sire to render effective service to their
country. Interviews with hundreds of
students brought out the fact that
many of them had previously paid
comparatively little attention to the
significance ot' the work which they
were doing in the Univeristy. Some
of them were stunned when they
m
found out that after years of prepara
tion they were not in a position to
offer any service to their country be
yond that of enlisting as private sol
diers. In other cases the preliminary
studies in engineering, bacteriology,
chemistry, medicine, etc., made it pos
sible to render superior service to the
country in a number of directions.
"Just what result this will have
upon education throughout the United
States is difficult to foresee, but one
can hardly escape the fact that many
of four young men have formed drastic
opinions upon certain phases of our
educational system, and these opin
ions will be felt when they return
again to university circles. It will be
more than ever desirable for the uni
versities to stand for those subjects
and that type of education which are
vital to the best of mental growth and
community and national development.
The intense practicality of war and its
needs must not throw our universities
out of balance."
