# WANTED ---A QUAD EDITOR
## 
### 
Prospective 1920 Quad editors begin trying out this week under the su
pervision of 1019 Editor Briggs. As was pointed out in yesterday's news
columns, as long as Stanford remaiis open, and there is no prospect of
its going to close, a record of undergraduate activities and accomplish
ments such as that furnished by the Junior yearbook is a vital necessity.
The value of an accurate, complete and well-written record of this kind
ton not be measured in dollars and cents, hence the most able man avail
able should be secured for the Quad editor each year. The most effec
tive way of justly determining who this person is, is the tryout scheme
now in effect, hence candidates should not delay a day in making up their
minds and coming out for the competition.
