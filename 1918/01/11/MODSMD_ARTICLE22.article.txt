# Pittsburg Abolishes Intercollegiate Baseball
## 
### 
Intercollegiate baseball has been
discontinued at the University of
Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, on account
of the interference with military drill
and because of the general lack of
interest. Intercollegiate wrestling
has been discontinued for a similar
reason.
