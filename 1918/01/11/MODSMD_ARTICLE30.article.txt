### 
President Wilbur said today, in
regard to the suit for $50,000 dam
ages brought aaginst the Los An
geles Times by Professor W. A.
Cooper:
"Professor Cooper has the sym
pathy of the University authori
ties in taking this method of clear
ing up the injustice done him."

Professor W. A. Cooper of the Ger
man department has filed a $" 0,000
libel suit against the Los Angeles
Times in answer to charges made in
that paper that Professor Cooper's
speech on December 19 before the
German section of the Teachers' In
stitute at Los Angeles.
The Times in its report of Cooper's
talk made charges of pro-Germanism
and un-Americanism, alleging that
Cooper's statements lauding German
institutions was unpatriotic.
The suit filed by Professor Cooper
is the first answer which has been
made to the almost nation-wide
storm which has gone up against him
and as a result of his remarks pub
lished in the Los Angeles papers. In
the charges, which were filed in the
Superior Court of San Francisco, Pro
fessor Cooper alleges that his reputa
tion and standing as an educator
have been damaged to the extent of
$50,000 by the reports of the Times,
which he asserts are untrue, and asks
for damages to that amount.
Interesting developments have fol
lowed the agitation due to Professor
Cooper's speech and comments when
German was abolished from the sec
ondary schools of Los Angeles.
