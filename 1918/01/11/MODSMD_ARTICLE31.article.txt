Dear Mr. Editor: It would seem
that after serving as lie lias for these
first few years, so faithfully and well, ;
President Wilbur should not be j
forced from office by the representa- â– 
tions of a stranger such as described
in The Daily Palo Alto last night. A
man representing himself to be the
descendant of Leland Stanford 1
Junior, is likely to be either a falsifier
of facts, or insane. Leland Stanford,
Junior, died years before this man
was born, and bis statement seems
to at least merit a thorough looking
into before any definite action is
taken regarding the resignation of
President Wilbur.
The man in question says he is G.i
years of age and was born in '66, so
that here also is something radically
wrong. A story of this kind, while
not absolutely impossible, is highly j
improbable, and must be verified at j
once. Hasty action is undesirable in '
such serious matters; and it is to be
hoped that President Wilbur will con- !
sider the matter at length before re
signing to a possbile charlatan as
this man may easily turn out to be.
It is up to the students as a body ,
to protest against drastic steps being !
taken, even, as seems improbable,!
were the stranger a real descendant;
with a legal claim on university af
fairs. President Wilbur is just get
ting his hand on the wheel of ac
tions here at Stanford, and should be
allowed to carry out the plans lie has
prepared. As a person vitally inter
ested and connected with student af
fairs and life, I hereby request that
no radical measures be taken until
this claim is fully investigated.
