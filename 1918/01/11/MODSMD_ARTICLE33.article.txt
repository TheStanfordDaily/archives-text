# LARGE NUMBER OF BAND POSITIONS OPEN THIS YEAR
## 
### 
In spite of the disturbing effects of
i the war, prospects for a good Stan
i ford band are brighter than they were
, last quarter. The weak sections of
: last quarter have been reinforced by
I new men of ability. But one man
! played the trombone then, but now
' this number has been increased to
I the proper strength of live. Cornets
now number six. There still remain
a considerable deficiency in the wood
wind instrument lists. At present
there are only three clarionets, while
six at least arc necessary to make a
well-balanced band. Players of the
| clarionet, flute, or piccolo are asked
ito communicate with student leader
j P. S. Carter, or with Manager F. W.
j Bergstrom, immediately. The position
I of bass drummer is vacant at present.
I Any man with a small reading knowl-
I edge of music is urged to try out for
I this part.
| Rehearsals ar eheld Monday and
Wednesday afternoons at 4:15 in the
Band Room, on thetop floor of tin.'
