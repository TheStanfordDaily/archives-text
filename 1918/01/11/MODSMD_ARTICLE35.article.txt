# SPANISH DEPARTMENT SHOWS BIG INCREASE
## 
### 
There are forty Spanish majors this
quarter, the largest number in the
history of the department, according
to Professor Espinosa. Only a few
years ago there were but three.
The most important reason he gives
for this rapid growth of interest in
Spanish is the increased commerce
with South America, tine to the Pan
ama Canal and its resulting southern
interests. This has made the knowl
edge of Spanish almost a business
necessity.
One result of this increasing im
portance of the Spanish language is
that a larger number of teachers
must lÂ»e fitted out to meet it. To fill
this demand, Stanford now has ad
vanced courses in the language and
literature of Spain and also teachers'
training courses.
