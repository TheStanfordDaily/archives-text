The letters of Robert E. Pellissier,
Stanford assistant professor in Ro
manic Languages, who was killed at
the Somme on August 29, 1916, while
in the service of his country, France,
were read and discussed at a meet
ing of Wranglers last night. His let
ters gave a personal idea of the war
at that time, and reflect his optimism
as to its outcome.
Mary Sprout, '20, was elected secre
tary of the club.
