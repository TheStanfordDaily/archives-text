# SPRING SPORTS GIVEN STRONG SENDOFF AT RALLY
## MALONEY TELLS OF NEED OF TEAMWORK Captains, Alumni, and Yell Leaders Combine to Uncork Jazz 
### 
Captain, alumni and yell leaders
pulled the jazz bottle cork at the
spring sports rally last night and the
result was a sign-up for baseball and
track that augurs well for the success
of these sports. The spirit of the
rally was expressed by Harry Ma
le ney, the first speaker, when he said:
"If teamwork was ever necessary in
the University it is today. We have
many problems to solve and the way
to solve them is by working to
gether." The rally seemed to get this
spirit and the result was an excess of
jazz and a large sign-up. Ninety-four
men signified their intention of trying
for track, while baseball drew 51.
Following Maloney, Track Captain
Wilson called for men to come out
for that sport and called tlie attention
of hopefuls to the fact that track
stars may be developed in a short
while.
The alumni were represented by R.
J Glendenning, Frank A. Scofield. and
Pr. C. Schaup, who nil urged Stanford
to keep up the fighting spirit dis
played already this year and success
would be certain.
Baseball Captain Lilly explained
the baseball situation to the fans and
urged especially that all men who
have ever played the national pastime
turn out since there are only three
veterans to build the team around.

called out the men listed below:
