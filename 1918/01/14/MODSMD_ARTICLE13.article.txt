# Tracksters Hold Initial Workout
## Aching Thighs and Calves Witnesses of First Practice 
### 
Aching thighs and sore calves are
excellent witnesses to the fact that
the track squad had its first official
workout on the cinder path Friday.
The greater part of the eighty candi
dates that aspire to track fame were
on hand some time during the day to
go through a light preliminary prac
tice. Temporary coach R. L. Temple
ton, 'IS, watched the men go through
their paces and announced himself
well pleased with their first work,
but urged the men to come out in
greater numbers.
No definite time has been set for
track practice, but the majority of
the men find it more convenient to
do their work late in the afternoon.
Men taking Military Training find
that this time interferes with drill,
and so arrangements have been made
to have some one on hand to coach
and instruct them at all hours of the
day. Track practice will be held in
the future every day in the week, at
any time most convenient to the men.
Preliminary meets have not been
definitely settled yet, although it is
expected that several meets will be
had with men from Camp Fremont,
and maybe other army camps. The
Stanford-California meet, which is 10
be held at Stanford this year, is to
take place on April 20. The Fresh
men meet the Mine and Gold speed
sters on March 30. A good three and
a half months' training is promised
the Varsity, but candidates are urged
to start light work immediately, so
that seme tort of a line on the ma
terial may be had. Early condition is
desiraUe since weather conditions
may at any time make training un
certain.
