# HELLO!
## 
### 
One of the most treasured traditions of Stanford democracy appears
to he ignored by a large percentage of students this year. There was a
time when every student spoke to every other student in passing. Never
during the past four years at least has there been a time when this cus
tom has been neglected to such an extent as now.
Perhaps the reason for this lies in the fact that a far greater per
centage of the student body is new to Stanford and to Stanford traditions
than in previous terms, but even some of the men who have been on the
campus two or three years seems to have forgotten the "Hello" habit.
Some of the old men and some of the freshmen are making an hon
est attempt to keep up the old custom, but there is little wonder some of
them are becoming discouraged when their hearty greeting is answered
by a vacant stare, or a half-hearted "How-do-you-do," which sounds more
like "Who the deuce are you?"
All Stanford traditions are having a hard fight to survive, this year.
Here is one that we can not permit to die out. The "Hello" custom is the
most vital outward sign of the democracy of the University. "Without the
democratic attitude Stanford would not be Stanford," to quote the late
Frederick C. Hamilton, '15, former Daily Palo Alto editor.
For the sake of Stanford democracy and good fellowship, then, ac
quire the "Hello" habit and cultivate it.
