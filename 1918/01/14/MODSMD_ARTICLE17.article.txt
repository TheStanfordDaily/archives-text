# THOUGHTS CONTROL ACTIONS SAYS REV. PATTON IN SERMON
## 
### 
'Our thoughts control our actions
and form our character; if we think
about wrong things we are all
wrong, and if we think about right
things we are all right," declared
Rev. Dr. C. S. Patton yesterday in his
sermon at Memorial Church.
"Man prides himself on being a
clear thinker, and this is the key to
the moral and spiritual self of man.
The good thinker thinks to the paint,
and lias a definite purpose in view,
and no obstacle is too great to over
come if a man makes up his mind
to it."
Dr. Patton is pastor of the First
Congregational Church of Los An
geles. He is accustomed to address
ing a university audience as he was
pastor of the First Congregational
Church at Ann Arbor, Michigan, for
ten years.
