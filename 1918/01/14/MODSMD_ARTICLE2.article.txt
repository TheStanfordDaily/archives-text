### 
Chancellor Emeritus Jordan, sneak
ing tomorrow night before a Univer
sity audience, will have a message
which will be received with great in
terest as representing his views on
the underlying causes of the present
catastrophe. "The Dynastic System—•
Tap Root o-' War" is the title of his
address, and in it he will dwell par- j
ticularly upon the historical causes!
for the present attitude of Germany. J
The idea of the Dynastic System,
in the opinion of Dr. Jordan, is the j
central part of the philosophy by
which Germany has been preverted.,
This system gives rise to three castes, 1
the military, the aristocratic, and the |
plutocratic. The philosophy rests o.i j
three bases, the idea of the supreme
state, the supreme discipline, and the |
supreme duty of conquest. These per
verted ideas are only possible through
the existence of the Dynastic System, j
which is dying out. in all other parts
of the world, but. which has become
strengthened in recent years in the
i •
German empire.
Tomorrw will be the first time in ;
months that Dr. Jordan lias spoiccn
to the University. lie returned from
his speaking tour only last month,
and since been engaged in finishing
his "Autobiogrphy." The lecture will
be in the Little Theater, and will he
gin at 7:.'50.
