# "Causes of War” Dr. Jordan's Topic
## Reasons for Perversion ot Germany to be Told Tomorrow Night 
### 
Chancellor Emeritus Jordan, sneak
ing tomorrow night before a Univer
sity audience, will have a message
which will be received with great in
terest as representing his views on
the underlying causes of the present
catastrophe. "The Dynastic System—•
Tap Root o-' War" is the title of his
address, and in it he will dwell par- j
ticularly upon the historical causes!
for the present attitude of Germany. J
The idea of the Dynastic System,
in the opinion of Dr. Jordan, is the j
central part of the philosophy by
which Germany has been preverted.,
This system gives rise to three castes, 1
the military, the aristocratic, and the |
plutocratic. The philosophy rests o.i j
three bases, the idea of the supreme
state, the supreme discipline, and the |
supreme duty of conquest. These per
verted ideas are only possible through
the existence of the Dynastic System, j
which is dying out. in all other parts
of the world, but. which has become
strengthened in recent years in the
i •
German empire.
Tomorrw will be the first time in ;
months that Dr. Jordan lias spoiccn
to the University. lie returned from
his speaking tour only last month,
and since been engaged in finishing
his "Autobiogrphy." The lecture will
be in the Little Theater, and will he
gin at 7:.'50.

Spirit's Book By Dr. Coover
Acts As a Ghostlike Soother.
Spooky Band Is A La Hoover

Ghosts, spiritualism, telepathy, or
thought transference, are discussed in
a book on psychical research, just off
the Stanford Press, the work of As
sistant Professor John Edgar Coover
of the Department of Psychology. In
it he gives the results of thousands of
experiments conducted here with stu
dents of psychology and of other ex
periments wtih "mediums" in San
Francisco.
The volume, entitled, Experiments
in Psychical Research at Leland Stan
ford Junior University," is monograph
No. 1 in psychical research. It con
tains 641 pages.
Dr. Coover is a fellow in psychical
research under the endowment of
Thomas Welton Stanford of Mel
bourne, Australia, who in 1912 placed
at the disposal of the University $50,-
000, the interest of which is applied
to investigations in the field of spir
itualism and psychical research. The
experiments reported on in the mono
graph have been in progress since
that time.
Dr. Jordan, Chancellor Emeritus
and a deep scientific scholar, con
tributes a brief foreword to the work,
and Dr. Frank Angell, head of the
Psychology department, has written
an introduction in which lie explains
the acceptance of the gift by the de
partment and the carrying out of the
terms of it. It was only after the de
partment was assured that it would
not be hampered in its investigations
by religious complications, he says,
that it agreed to take up the matter
purely as a scientific investigation.
Mr. Stanford, "whose house in Mel
bourne has long been the home of
spiritualistic seances," to quote Dr.
Angell, gave the endowment "wholly
unconditioned and there were no lim
its as regards time and no sugges
tions as regards problems or results."
In addition to the $50,000 endow
ment, Mr. Stanford placed about $500
a year at the disposal of the Univer
sity for the purchase of books on
psychical research, and finally added
to these donations the large collec
tion of "apports" produced in the
seances at his home in Melbourne.
Dr. Lillien Martin, professor emer
itus of psychology, has contributed to
the volume an account of experiments
which she conducted.
In the author's preface, Dr. Coover
sets forth that he gives "no brief
either for or against the general
phenomena in this field" and that
"the research is undertaken with a
zeal lor Truth." He explains also
that the less technical portions will
interest the layman as the technical
will the scientists." Summarizing
the contents of the work, Dr. Coover
says:
"Herein will be found (1) a statis
tical method of experiment in psy
chical research which, it is believed,
will be acceptable to science and
prove adequate for resolving doubt
and controversy concerning the al
leged supernatural acquisition of
knowledge (telepathy, lucidity or
clairvoyance, or communication from
discarnate intelligences capable of
apprehending facts in our world);
and (2) the results of the first appli
cations of this method."
The author dedicates the book to
Mr. Stanford, "whose wisdom in pro
viding opportunities for scientific in
vestigation has anticipated the great
est need of psychical research."
