## 
### 
An exhibit of etchings by well
known California artists has been ar
ranged by Pedro J. Lemos, curator of
the Stanford Museum, and will shortly
take the place of the present exhibit
of Pennell Lithographs. The new ex
hibit will be sent from southern Cali
fornia where it is now being shown,
and will be placed in the Art Gallery
within the next few days. All meth
ods of making prints have been used
for etchings to be shown. About one
hundred etchings will be hung,
among them several by artists who
formerly studied art at Stanford and
have since become known in the art
world.
H. Harshie, once instructor of arc
at Stanford, now assistant curator of
the Carnegie Institute at Pittsburg,
and Howell C. Brown, Stanford
alumni, will be represented. Among
others, Arthur Dodge, Benjamin C.
Brown, Harry Bailey, J. Winkler,
William C. Rice, and Hanna Thomp
son, the last of whom is a former
Stanford student, will have prints in
the coming exhibit. Another contrib
utor is Pedro J. Lemos, who has
charge of the Art Gallery.
Mr. Lemos expected to have a par
tial exhibit of Ramaeker cartoons
from San Francisco, but this is now
impossible, as that exhibit is sched
uled for Los Angeles. The Pennell
Lithographs will be sent from here to
Sacramento and the northern part of
the state.
