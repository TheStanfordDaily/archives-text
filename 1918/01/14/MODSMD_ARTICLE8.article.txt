# RETURN TO CARRIER SYSTEM ON CAMPUS
## 
### 
Beginning tomorrow afternoon
The Daily Palo Alto will be deliv
ered by carrier to all campus sub
scribers as well as to those within
the Palo Alto city limits. It is felt
that the improved service made
possible by a return to the carrier
delivery system justifies the pos
sible additional expense. All who
have not yet bought student body
cards or subscribed to the paper
should do so at once and any sub
scriber who fails to get his paper
should notify The Daily Palo Alto
office or the Graduate Manager's
office at once.
