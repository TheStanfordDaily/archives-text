# SOPHOMORE PLAY WILL BE STAGED ON FEBRUARY 15
## "IT PAYS TO ADVERTISE IS SELECTED Coach Mathieu Will Hold Tryouts Thursday for the Entire Cast 
### 
That the sophomore play will be
given on February 15 is the decision
ol the 1920 play committee arrived at
yesterday evening. Tryouts are to be
held Thursday and rehearsals will be
gin immediately after their comple
tion.
"It pays to Advertise," by Edward
Charles Carpenter, is the play select
en for presentation. Frank L. Ma
thieu, despite his new duties as di
rector of the San Francisco Little
Theatre, has consented to act as
coach.
It was feared for a time that, owing
to war conditions and conflicting
dates, the second-year class would be
unable to put on their usual show this
year. However, Ram's Head has
given up its closed date for February
15, and the play committee, believing
that the tradition of a sophomore play
should not be dropped, secured it im
mediately.
"It Pays to Advertise' 'is one of the
most popular farces on the stage to
day. It has enjoyed a two-season run
in New York ,aiul has gained a re
l iarkable success on the road. This
play by Edward Charles Carpenter
should be of unusual interest to the
campus audience, as it will be the
first college production of it in the
West.
Mathieu thoroughly believes in the
possibilities of the play, having recom
mended it to the sophomore commit
tee from the outset, He says that the
play is exceptionally well adapted to
a college cast ,and expects to have no
trouble in selecting the proper types
for the parts if a sufficient number of
sophomores take part in the tryouts.
The tryouts will be held in Assem
bly Hall on Thursday afternoon at 5,
and again at 7:30 in the evening All
those who were selected from the try
outs held last quarter will be eligible
to take part in this, together with
other sophomores who have not com
peted before. The Sophomore Play
Committee expects all who were not
eliminated last quarter, and all other
fophomores who feel that they have
?,ny dramatic talent to be present
Thursday, as the success of the play
depends upon the selection of a good
c<) st.
