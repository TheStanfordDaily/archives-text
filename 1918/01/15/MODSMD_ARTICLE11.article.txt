"Conservation without added pro
duction will never win the war. We
must not only greatly decrease the
consumption of luxuries, but also in
crease the production of necessities
to a marked degree if we would bring
the war to a successful termination."
These were the words of Professor
Jones to his class in Economics, yes
terday.
"Most people are imbued with the
wrong idea of conservation. Many
suppose that the mere saving of
money is real conservation. We con
stantly find cases of men giving
thousands of dollars to war charities,
and still retaining a large retinue of
nine or ten servants. All this is a
criminal waste of labor, and, in fact,
such people are actually bidding
against the government to hold these
men in their personal service. So far
as the money is concerned, that can
be taken by the government, through
the means of increased income taxes,
etc. .
"The world war is being waged
over one principle," Jones added. "It
rests on the assumption that the de
grees of civilization of a nation is
relative to the number of her wants.
Thus the savage has comparatively
few wants, in comparison to the man
of our modern world. Therefore
Germany feels that as her wants in
crease in number, the more civilized
she becomes, even if she must sacri
fice the property of others to satiate
those desires. Of course, this is all
fallacious, since it is not in the num
ber of wants that the civilization of
a nation rests on, but their nature.
Thus because modern man learns to
desire drink, this does not mean he
is evincing a higher type of civiliza
tion than the savage who does not
drink."
