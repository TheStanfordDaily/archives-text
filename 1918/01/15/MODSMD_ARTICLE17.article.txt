# BACK TO THE OLD SYSTEM
## 
### 
This edition marks the return oil The Daily Palo Alto to the old sys
tem of delivering the paper by carrier. Last quarter, when the mailing
plan was first installed, it appeared that its adoption would save a con
siderable sum of money, a necessary consideration daring the present
year. But on careful examination of actual costs under the two methods
it now seems evident that the carrier system is even more economical than
the postoftice plan.
Even if this were not the case the additional expense of carrier deliv
ery would be justified, we believe, by the greater convenience to subscrib
ers. A greater percentage of readers would be able to get the Daily early
than under the mailing system.
During the first few days of the change back to the old way some
mistakes may be made, but these will be rectified promptly if parties who
fail to receive the Daily notify this office or the Graduate Manager. In
many cases these mistakes will be found to be due to the carelessness of
the individual in failing to state his address at the time of purchasing his
A. S. S. U. ticket.
