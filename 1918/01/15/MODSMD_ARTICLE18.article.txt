						WORD OF WELCOME

### 
A word of welcome to Major Volkmar, new head of the Stanford Mili
tary department, is in order at this time. To his predecessor, Major
Bugge, is due most of the credit for putting Stanford on the military
map. The far from easy task of keeping Stanford in the distinguished
class of ten universities accomplishing the most in the line of war train
ing, now falls to Major Volkmar. May lie have the cooperation of the men
of the University just as fully as did Major Bugge before him, and may he
be equally successful in maintaining and improving the high standard of
the Stanford It. O. T. C.
