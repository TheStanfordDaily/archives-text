# NO VACANT CHAIRS
## 
### 
Chancellor Emeritus David Starr Jordan addresses the University
community at 7:30 this evening in the Little Theater. He is to outline the
real causes of the present world war and to deal with the part America
has to play in it. This is his first appearance before a Stanford audience
for a number of months. There should be no vacant chairs in the Little
Theater tonight.
