# NEW SYSTEM HITS FACULTY VACATIONS
## 
### 
A now phase of tLe four-quarter sys
tem is being experienced by the fac
ulty and goes to prove that the only
martyrdom accompanying this Stan
ford innovation is not that felt by
the students in suffering over five
hour courses and a diminished amount
of time to study in.
This new angle is the relay system
v hereby a professor, instead of his
xegular summer vacation, may be held
for any three of the four quarters, so
that, instead of balmy summer breezes
to lull his tired brain, his vacation
may happen upon him in January.
Thus he may be forced, as several
faculty members are at present, to
seek refuge in his accustomed haunts,
allowing habit to waft him along un
til it is time to take up his duties
again.
