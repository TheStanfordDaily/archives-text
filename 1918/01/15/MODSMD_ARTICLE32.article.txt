# ASK ALL TEACHERS TO REGISTER NOW
## THE 						GOVERNMENT EMPLOYMENT AGENCY WILL PROVIDE POSITIONS FOR APPLICANTS 
### 
In order to prevent duplication of
appointments for teaching positions,
the United States Employment Ser
vice has asked that all candidates for
teaching positions in the 1918-19 ap
pointment season, register immediate
ly, before the actual opening of the
season. Last year Dr. D. B. Prenti3,
acting director of employment for
Illinois, under whose jurisdiction this
division is operated, reports that dur
ing the past year it was impossible
to find enough teachers for many at
tract ive* positions, and that in some
cases, immediately after a place had
been filled by other sources, a suit
able candidate would register, and it
would be too late to nominate him for
that particular position.
Since the appointment season opens
in April or May, Dr. Prentis asks
that application be made now for reg
istration blanks. If this is done, rec
ords may be completed, and head
quarters will be able to make nom
inations readily and according to
special preferences.
The national government operates
eighty-five free public employment
offices throughout the United States,
and the section at Chicago is the
Teachers' and Engineering Agency.
Positions are found for professional
engineers, including draftsmen, civil,
machanical, and electrical engineers,
chemists and metallurgists, as well
as toachers. Appointments in the en
gineering section are not made until
October.
In connection with this Dr. Prentis
writes, "If you are dissatisfied with
I your present position, write for a
! registration blank. The division has
some attractive positions listed."
Communications to the office should
be addressed: "Teachers and Profes
sional Service Division, U. S. Em
ployment Service, 845 South Wabash
Ave., Chicago, 111." Applications
should indicate the branch of ser
vice desired, and a stamped, self-ad
dressed envelope will be a great con
venience to the division.
