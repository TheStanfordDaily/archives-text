# Students Arrested!
## Look Out For Dog! 
### 
Robbery and crime have cast their
withering blight on the Stanford com
munity and two prominent members
of the student body, whose names ar>
withheld from publicity until further
investigation has taken place, have
become implicated in a heinous of
fense. The dastardly deed occurred
one night last week and so successful
has been the attempt to suppress the
facts that only today the real situa
tion became generally known on the
campus.
Selecting Palo Alto as the base for
their operations the would-be robbers
set out to accomplish their ends,
heavily armed with a hammer and pair
of scissors. Creeping up under cover
of the darkness of the unllghted
streets of our neighboring city, the
thieves worked cpiietly and quickly
and the deed was almost accomplished
when a wakeful bulldog slipped his
chain and put the maurauders to
hasty flight.
The Thick Plottens.
Undauted by the failure of their
first attempt, they crept back to see
if the coast was clear, and were
espied by the night police, who was
faithfully patrolling his beat. This
sleuth surprised the young villains,
and flourished an automatic re
volver in their faces. After consider
able argument the young villains
craftily persuaded the officer that
their mission was a peaceful one and
so eluded the trap set for them.
No sooner had the suspects van
ished from sight than the military
authorities from Camp Fremont ar
rived on the scene and exacting from
the city officer the details of his re-
cent experience they decided that the
suspects were the very ones who had,
less than fifteen minutes before,
broken the lock on the door of one of
the well known stores of Palo Alto
and stolen a number of bicycles from
the place. The officers pursued the
young adventurers, and hand-cuffed
them. Cunningness again assisted the
robbers in disposing of the only di
rect evidence against them, their tools
of destruction, the hammer and scis
sors. They craftily disposed of these
by throwing them from the auto
which bore them back to the Palo
Alto police court. Arraigned before
the local police court they were di
rectly accused of the crime with
which they were charged. After many
.staunch denials they were released,
on condition that they would appear
the following morning and properly
explain their presence in the vicinity
of the robbery.
After spending the night in sleep
less torment the evil-doers decided to
clear their consciences by making a
clean breast of the affair and con
fessing their plot to the court to re
ceive whatever punishment was meted
out for them. As a result of this de
cision they humbly confessed to the
judge that they were the principals in
a plot to steal, not bicycles, but a
sign: Look out for the Itulhlog. He
Bites!
Case dismissed.
