# JORDAN TO SPEAK ON CAUSES OF WAR TONIGHT AT 7:30
## 
### 
Stanford people will tonight have
an opportunity to hoar Dr. Jordan
for the first time this year. The
Chancellor Emeritus is to speak on
"The Dynastic System—the Tap Root
of War," and in his lecture will give
his views as to the fundamental
cause of the present war, which he
believes is to be found in the adher
ence of Germany to the dynastic sys
tem, and its three accompanying
castes —military, aristocratic, and
plutocratic.
Dr. Jordan's address will be one of
the regular series of Tuesday evening
meetings, and will be held in the Lit
tle Theater at 7:30.
