Regular baseball practices will be

sity diamond for both Freshman and

Will Hay Fraternity Gaines.
The fraternity-club series has been
postponed until next week and thÂ«
games will be run off as a part of the
regular practices under the supervis
ion of Captain Lilly. In order to have
all groups represented it is planned
to combine houses which haven't
enuogh ball players to form a team.
Houses which are planning entering
the series are requested to report to
Captain Lilly at once, since the sched
ule of games is to be made out this
week and a full list is necessary for
this purpose.
Informal practices have been held
during the last week with most of
the men who signed up at the spring
sports rally reporting regularly, but
the practice tomorrow night will be
the first time all the men will be
given a real work-out.
Several of the men who have re
ported for the first time this year are
working hard with the many open
positions on the nine in sight, and
Captain Lilly will be able to give his
men hard practices in the near fu
ture. Dickey, Galloway, Wayland,
Lifur, and Campbell will be the men
around which the team will have to
lie built in addition to Lilly, but none
of these men are sure of positions,
and there is an opportunity for all
new men who report.
It is planned to run off the inter
fraternity-interclub series during reg
ular practices in the hopes of uncov
ering new material from the nines
represented. For this reason all
houses are particularly urged to turn
out a team and see what they can do
in the national pastime.
