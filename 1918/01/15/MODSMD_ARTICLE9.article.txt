# FREMONT COMMANDER ADDRESSES R.0.T.C.
## Emphasizes the Necessity of Trained Officers to Lead Forces 
### 
Bringing a message that clearly ex
plained the object of giving military
training in the colleges and universi
ties of this country Colonel Smiley,
commander of the Eighth Infantry at
Camp Fremont, addressed the men of
the advanced class of the It. O. T. C.
in the Little Theater yesterday after
i oon. Preparedness rather than mil
itarism was the keynote of the talk.
Lieutenant Colonel Maloney intro
duced Major Walter S. Volkmar, the
i ew Stanford military instructor, to
the men and he was given a hearty
applause of reception. Captain J. T.
Wood, Jr., '18, commanding Company
A of the R. O. T. C., gave a talk on
the "Use of Gas as a Weapon in Mod
i rn Warfare."
"A nation not able to defend itself
ought not to live. It will not live,"
was the staunch declaration with
which Colonel Smiley opened his talk.
He reviewed the necessity of a na
tion having, not a great standing
army, but an inexhaustable supply
ei well-trained reserve officers to lead
its citizen soldiery. "The great sue-
cess of Germany in this war," he said,
"is attributable, more than to any one
other factor, to the great ability they
have shown to produce enough well
ipserve trained officers to not only
h ad their own armies, but to com
pletely reorganize the armies of Aus
tria, Rumania and Turkey. The mili
tary profession," he went on to say,
' is one that requires trained men as
well as that of surgery or law. Play
the military game for all you are
worth."
Colonel Smiley paid a high tribute
to the work of Major Bugge and the
teamwork of Stanford men that com
bined in bringing Stanford into the
distinguished class in less than a
year. He assured Major Volkmar that
he would meet with the same hearty
response from Stanford men that his
predecessors had met with.
After the close of Colonel Smiley's
address Captain Wood gave a discus
sion 011 the use of gas at the front.
