# "GERMAN SYSTEM IS CAUSE OF WAR" SAYS JORDAN
## TELLS DYNASTIC THEORY Government by Divine Right Attacked and Idea of "Kultur" Assailed 
### 
There can never be a permanent
world peace until the dynastic sys
tem, as exemplified in the present
government of Germany, has been
completely overthrown, according to
Chancellor Emeritus Jordan, who
spoke last night before an audience
which overflowed the Little Theater.
"The Dynastic Systemâ€”The Tap Root
of War" was the title of Dr. Jordan's
lecture, in which he expounded the
present governmental philosophy of
Germany, whose perverted ideals he
regards as primarily responsible for
the outbreak of the present world
conflagration.
Dr. Jordan defines a dynastic state
as one in which the rulers claim to
derive their authority by divine right,
and are the owners and driver.3
rather than the servants of the peo
ple. Such a state is the German Em
pire under domination of Prussia.
Austria is merely a "Germany out at
the elbows." Turkey and the recently
overthrown autocracy of Russia are
also examples of the dynastic system.
Hut Germany is the mainstay of this
theory of government. "If the kaiser
were overthrown, all the little despoU
of Europe would speedily disappear,"
said Dr. Jordan.
"War is the chief business of the
dynastic state," declared the speaker.
"No free state would go to war of its
own accord, except for some extra
ordinary ideal such as has actuated
the United States. War is welcomed
by the three castes which grow up
under the dynastic system; by the
military caste because war is its
business, by the aristocratic caste be
cause it diverts the people, and by
the plutocratic when it gives them
greater profits."
Dr. Jordan divided the inhabitants or
a nation into two classes: the people,
or those who think and who have
something to lose, and the populace,
or those who do not. "It is the pur
pose of democracy to turn the popu
lace into people, and the aim of the
dynasty to turn as many of the peo
ple as it can into populace."
"The dynastic system cannot depend
alone upon the individual rulers, who
are apt to be weak and brainless,"
said Dr. Jordan, "so the system is
supported by the German idea of
Kultur or discipline, and the German
philosophy, which can be conjured up
to suit the occasion. This Kultur
rests on three bases: the ideas of ser
vice, conformity, and efficiency.
"Our conception of discipline is
self-discipline, that every man should
work out a place for himself, while
the German idea is that the state
should tind a place for him. This
makes for mass efficiency, but it does
not make men. Not a man could have
been found trained in any dynastic
university who would have been able
to do the work that Herbert Hoover
has done in Belgium."
Dr. Jordan attacked the policy of
military conscription in time of peace,
declaring that in every country where
it was not temporary, as in Franc 0 ,
the chief ends of this policy were
industrial, for the benefit of the land
owning and manufacturing classes.
He also denounced the German doc
trine of the survival of the fittest as
applied to nations, saying that it was
true only of individuals.
"War is the wickedest thing left on
earth," said the Chancellor Emeritus
in conclusion. "It will last as long
as the dynastic system is permitted
to exist. Every nation held together
by force is now crumbling before our
eyes."
