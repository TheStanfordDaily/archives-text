# NINE HUNDRED SLEEPERS
## 
### 
Only a few more than four hundred students have as yet purchased
Associated Student membership canls. This total falls far below any pre
vious mark in the history of the University and is a disgrace to the good
name of the student body, as it now stands. Although registration has
decreased there are still approximately thirteen hundred men and women
enrolled. In other words, almost nine hundred students have failed to
show sufficient spirit to purchase A. S. S. U. tickets as yet.
This year the student body card not only secures admission to games
and meets at reduced prices and permits the holder to participate in ath
letics and other college activities, including the right to vote at Associated
Student elections, but it also entitles the purchaser to a subscription to
The Daily Palo Alto. Provision is made to send the paper to the folks at
home or to one of the boys "over there," if such a transfer is desired.
Campaign captains appointed in the various living groups should not
allow themselves to lay down on the job. But don't wait for the captain
in your house or club to come after you. Get busy yourself and buy that
A. S. S. U. card now.
