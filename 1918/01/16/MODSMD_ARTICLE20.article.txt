Although tryouts for business director of The Daily Palo Alto were
announced last week, but one man has thus far reported to the Graduate
Manager's office for assignments. Feeling that it was the only fair thing
to do, under the circumstances, Executive Committee last evening de
cided that no candidate could be considered unless he reported to the
Graduate Manager by Thursday night. This action leaves prospective man
agers one more day of grace.
Amount and quality of work done in the tryout period are the factors
which will be considered in the appointment of a man to the office of
business director of the Daily, and it is to the interest of all concerned to
see that the competitive tryout planned is such in fact as well as in name
or else to make the appointment on a different basis altogether.
