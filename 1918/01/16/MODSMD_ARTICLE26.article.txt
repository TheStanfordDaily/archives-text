To secure the participation in some
form of athletic exercise of a maxi
mum number of women students in
stead of only a few, an Outing Club
has been organized in the University
of Wisconsin. The club is attracting
a great deal of attention and is meet
ing with good success. Horseback
riding, bicycling, skating, hiking,
boating, coasting, and camping par
ties are some of the activities under
taken. One hundred and fifty women
have signed for the club.
The Association of Kansas Col
leges met at Topeka, Kan., last week,
and among other things decided that
athletics were of such value to col
lege men that they should be con
tinued during the war, and the asso
ciation recommended that they be
made more general so that all stu
dents would be benefited. The social
activties of the colleges were dis
cussed and it was decided that they
were of value to college life and
should be continued but that all un
necessary expense be curtailed.
Registration figures at the Univer
sity or* Pennsylvania show a decrease
of 2,212 students under the total en
rollment of last year. The registra
tion this year is 6,620 and the loss
represents approximately the number
of men the university lias in service.
One of the first moving picture ma
chines ever manufactured is owned
by the Physics department of the
University of Wisconsin.
