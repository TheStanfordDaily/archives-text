# Eyes Are Wanted! A Dollar For Yours
## 
### 
Wanted: Eyes for the Navy—in the
form of spyglasses, binoculars, tel
escopes, chronometers, and sextants.
All this because of the vigilant sub
marine for which an efficient lookout
must be kept. Foreign supplies,
which covered the need before the
war, are now closed, leaving! this
country without any stock upon which
to draw. An appeal is being made to
private owners to send in all possible
"Eyes." A request through the press
some weeks ago resulted in there
ceipt of more than 3,000 glasses, but
even this number falls far short of
what is urgently needed.
One dollar will be paid as the
rental, or in event of loss, the pur
chase price of the article sent, as the
government is not allowed to accept
material without payment therefor.
Anyone who needs the dollar and lias
a spyglass may participate. Besides
the dollar, an effort will be made to
return the article after the war (its
condition not guaranteed), and its
historical interest will be an added
attraction.
Articles must be tagged, with the
name and address of the donor, and
forward by mail or express to the
Honorable Franklin 1). Roosevelt,
Assistant Secretary of the Navy, care
of Naval Observatory, Washington, D.
C. A record will be made of the
name and address of the donor, to
insure return after the war.
