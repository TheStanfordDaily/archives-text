and man about the -ampus generally,
inhabited the first named resort and
10 even now held in < .ose confinement
under suspicion of clr'cken-pox. His
brothers are hoping ior the best and
lully expecting the worst.
Along with this knowledge comes
tbe hint that Orrie ihrist, '18, has
teen detained by the authorities of the
