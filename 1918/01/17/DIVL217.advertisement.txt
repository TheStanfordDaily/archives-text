THE CASE AGAINST CHRISTIAN SCIENCE
Free Lecture by FREDERICK W. PEABODY, Boston Lawyer
Author of "The Religio-Medical Masquerade"; attorney for Mrs. Eddy's sons in their suit for the appoint
ment of a receiver for her estate on the grounds of insanity, etc., etc., etc.
This famous lecture-trial is in the form of a lawyer's address to a jury, upon sworn testimony oi many
witnesses examined by him in open court, in which Mr. Peabody proves the absolutely non-religious
character, and the entire absence of real healing power, in "Christian Science."
His plea is absorbingly interesting; his disclosures are in a high degree startling and his showing is authoriia
live and convincing. AT TH p MASONIC TEMPLE, FRIDAY, JANUARY 18, Bp. m.
From the Los Angeles Daily Times.
" * * * Kjve thousand persons listened last
night to Frederick W. Peabody—three thou
sand more waited for admission and were
turned away—all standing room was taken
nearly an hour before the time scheduled for
the address to begin."
From the New York Times.
" * * * The courts of Massachusetts are
open and until Mr, Peabody is a convicted
slanderer no sane or decent person, man or
woman, can afford to give any countenance to
'Christian Science'."
The Boston Herald.
"Mr. Peabody's speech was an avalanche of
wit and biting sarcasm. That they got plain
talk and plenty of it and a great abundance of
explicit charges without any beating about the
bush, there can be no doubt in the mind of
anyone who was privileged to hear the distin
guished attorney."
No Admission Charge Hear the Only Living Man Who Knows the Whole Truth Everybody Welcome J
