# Bawl-Out Finds Startling Names Of Ancient Men
## 
### 
in the annual roll-call announced
by the latest Bawl-Out we have with
us new faces and new names, —with
interest centering about the latter.
Among the notables appears an
Abbott, worthy man, and Abel is her?
again, being followed by an ancien*
chap, Abraham by name. Where but
rne Adam should be, there are three,
rny one of which may be Abel's Dad
There's an Anthony, but no Cleo for
him. Two Barnharts claim prece
dence of the footlights, and a woman
who is Bald, is next. The prize
fighters, Azevedo and Ritchie, have
representatives, and what with a Cash,
a Miss Fast, Rich, a Red-wine, and a
Darling inhabiting the campus things
promise to become "fair and
warmer."
There is a Leak somewhere to the
effect that the Bailiff will seek the
Cooks, the Baker to make them find
the Fish who has strayed with a
Lamb. The numerous Hunters may
join the Chase. Benedicts are scarce,
and there's but one Goodman, and a
scattering of Gentry. Rills are num
berless. Two Hoovers grace the
Card, which is so far without a
Cloud, but for the Gray and Green
reflected by the Parson's Mugg. Fivo
Kings with many Squires seem to
have taken Strongly to (Johnnie)
Walker. The lonely Post seems t
good one to tie to, and if the Sweets
are Wise they will do so.
Among the famous appear Wagner,
Wadsworth, a sadly depleted host of
Smiths, a Zimmerman, a Wilbur, ami
some Dunns. A Parrot and a Peacock
go hand in Hand, with a flock of
Crowes flying after. Kahle is not
profuse, for three Sharps are on
Deck. A Mail (more deadly than the
Male) is a friend of Joy and the
Lozier, while tinkling Pells dangle on
behind.
Proofs for the "Bawl-out" are now
posted on the bulletin board in front
of the Registrar's Office. Students
should look up their names on the
sheets and report any corrections to
the Registrar either today or tomor
row, after which no changes can be
made.
