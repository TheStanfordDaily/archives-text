# FEW VETERANS OUT AT FIRST BALL PRACTICE
## Three Aspirants for Mound Position Show Up at Iinitial Workout 
### 
Fifty men reported to Captain Ken
Lilly, '19, last night, for the first base
ball practice of the season. The ab
sence of veterans makes the present
outlook appear discouraging, but thÂ°
presence of such a large number of
candidates assures strong fights for
all positions.
Campbell and Dickey are the two
veterans from last year, with the ex
ception of Lilly, who are in uniform.
Liftir, Galloway, Wayland, and Howes,
members of the 1920 Freshman team,
are out for jobs, and are competing
against several promising men. The
freshmen have a number of repre
sentatives out, and should form a
good team.
Captain Lilly's particular job will
be to develop a pitcher. Lifur, Briggs.
and Hurley are the only candidates
for the mound position thus far. ft
is too early to get a line on their bov
tricks, but a good hurler should be
forthcoming from their midst. Tlic
freshmen have three aspirants for
pitching signed up, so that the posi
tion will not suffer from lack of com
petition.
The interfraternity-interclub series
is expected to show results in the
form of new material. At present the
plans call for the start of the series
on Monday.
