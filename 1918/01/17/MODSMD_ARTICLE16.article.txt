# HONORS THAT MEAN WORK

### 
Committees to manage the different features of Junior Week enter
tainment were named today by the 1919 class president A few days ago a
central Senior Week committee was announced. Appointments to positions
on Senior and Junior Week committees have always been ranked high
among so-called "college honors," but such appointments are more a mat
ter of responsibility and work than of honor.
This year responsibility falls more heavily than ever before on the
men and women who make up these committees. Junior and Senior Weeks
must both be cut down and put on a strictly war-time basis. There can be
no lavish expenditure of money on the festivities of either .class. This year
there are far fewer Juniors and Seniors than ever before, hence each one
of those who remain must work harder and sacrifice more than the upper
classmen in previous years.
In spite of this necessary Hooverization we are all looking forward to
the usual good times during both "weeks." A duplication of the elab
orate programs of former years is not expected, but the features of enter
tainment which are to be retained iii modified form should be well pre
sented.
Members of the sommittees named therefore have heavier responsibil
ities and more real work ahead of them than any of their predecessors have
bad in past years and unless they fully realize these responsibilities and
live up to them neither Junior nor Senior Week will prove a success this
year.
