# WRANGLERS ENJOY TALK ON LEDWIDGE
## 
### 
"The Life and Writings of Francit
Ledwidge" was the topic of a talk by
Miss Ella Calhoun, '20, hefon
Wranglers, last night. Ledwidge was
considered one of the most promising
poets of his time, although his works
are fed. He enlisted in Ireland when
the war broke out, and was killed i'i
action in July, 1917.
One of the saddest things about this
war, as was pointed out, is that sr
many promising poets and litera; v
men are being killed.
