### 
Debating activities sprang into
prominence today with the announce
ment by K. E. Leib, debating coach,
that the Joffre debate will take place
at the University of California on
March 22, and the contest with the
University of Southern California will
be held in the latter part of February
or the first of March, in Los Angeles.
Tryouts for both teams are to be an
nounced in a few days.
Formerly the Carnot.
The Joffre Medal, formerly the Car
rot Medal, will be awarded to the win
ner of the debate at Berkeley. The
topic for discussion has not been an
nounced as yet, but as soon as it is,
active work will commence. Coach
Leib has two veterans from last year
to work with in M. L. McClintock, '18,
and J. G. Driscoll, '18. These two men
will form a nucleus for the squad that
will represent Stanford.
At Berkeley this Year.
The debate at Berkeley will be the
first of the Joffre series. The medal
is on display in the Registrar's Office
for a few days and will be shown to
those interested. The Carnot medal
was won by a California man last
year.
Stanford will debate the University
oi Southern California in Los Angeles
on conscription of labor in war times,
about the first of March. Coach Leib
plans to work his oral debate class
with the squad, in order to develop
material. At present lie lias five men
from the squad formed last quarter.
They are A. G. Westwick, '18, H. H.
Hoss, '18, G. P. Wood, '20, J. M.
Cuddy, '21, and J. E. Simpson, '21. Try
outs are to start in a few days.
The question to be debated is, "Re
solved, that in war times the federal
government should employ conscrip
tion of labor to insure the necessary
output of war materials." Stanford
will have the affirmative of the ques
tion.
The judges for both of the debates
have not been announced. The list of
men for the U. S. C. contest has been
submitted to both institutions, but
final choice has not been made. The
Faculty Committee will probably Se
lect the judges for the Joffre debate.
