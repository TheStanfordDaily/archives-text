The Engineering department has
received of late several interesting
letters from former Stanford men,
some following their profession in
civil life, others in the governmental
service in the army. One of the most
interesting of these letters is from
H. S. Chuck, '11, who is doing work
in China at the present time. Chuck
was in the employ of an American
company around the Chuchow Chian
district up to the outbreak of the
war between the United States and
Germany. He then proceeded to
Hankow where he was instrumental
in the formation of the Loong Chong
Engineering and Construction Com
pany. This organization was the first
of its kind ever brought into exist
ence by Chinese engineers. Chuck
was made general superintendent of
the same.
Word has also been received from
V. A. Endersby, '15, who is with the
332F Signal Corps battalion C at
Camp Lewis. Endersby states that
aside from a shortage of clothing
army life is so far satisfactory. He
states also that on January 21 he
will take an examination for a com
mission as provisional second lieu
tenant in the Corps of Engineers.
M. R. Koll, '17, is with the Ist Co. â€”
166 Depot Brigade, at Camp Lewis.
He is planning to take the examina
tion for a commission of second lieu
tenant in the sanitary squad of the
Quartermaster's Department.
