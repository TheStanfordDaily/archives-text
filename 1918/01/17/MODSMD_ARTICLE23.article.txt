Twenty-four plum puddings, pre
pared under the direction of Cap and
Gown, were sent to Camp Lewis to
brighten the holiday season for the
Stanford men at that cantonment.
However, when the boys came to in
vestigate the "puddings," they found
that each was khaki handkerchief
filled with delectable sweets.
Small donations were taken up
from each living group of the women
on the campus, and with special rates
made by several stores in Palo Alto
the boxes for the boys were made
possible. Each pudding contained a
cake of maple sugar, tobacco, an
apple, a cake of chocolate, and other
tempting dainties to satisfy the
Christmas longing for sweets.
"We hope that our boys received
their boxes," said Miss Dare Stark,
of Cap and Gown, "but no promise
could be made to us on account of the
crowd. Still, somebody was made
happy, anyway.''
