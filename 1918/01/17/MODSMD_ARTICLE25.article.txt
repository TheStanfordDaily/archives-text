ANOTHER VIEWPOINT
Editor Daily Palo Alto.
Dear Sir:
Before coming to Stanford I had
heard much of the vaunted Stanford
democracy and the Stanford "Hello
Gents." On walking along the Quad
shortly after my arrival here I called
my cheery greeting to everybody in
; sight. In some cases it worked and in
some cases it did not. More often I
received no response to my bubbling,
well-meant familiarity. Men would
look at me, as if to inquire, "Where
were you introduced to me before? If
not, why do you nod to me so boldly?"
Now, Mr. Editor, when you stop to
consider that there are only about 750
men on the campus, and that only
about 250 of thees respond to words
of greeting, is it a wonder that a
stranger far from home, as I am, feels
lonesome at times?
However, I wish to offer a possible
solution for you to act upon at your
discretion. Women are taking the
men's places in industry throughout
the entire land. Why not at Stanford?
The men who formerly went to the
extra labor of "holding a guy" are
either at war, or too busy in thinking
about the war to observe this trivial
custom of democracy. If we can't take
their minds from themselves to pass
ersby, why can't we ask the women
to adopt the "Hello Gents" slogan and
receive in return the cheery "How are
you, ladies?"
I. M. LONESOME.
P. S. â€”As an afterthought it came
to me that the women are getting
more cordial to the men that are left
as their number lesens day by day.
I. M. L.
