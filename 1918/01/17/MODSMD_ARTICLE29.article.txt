# PLANT RESOURCES TO BE STUDIED BY BOTANY PROFESSORS
## 
### 
Botanical investigation of thesur
rounding community is about to be
undertaken by the professors of the
Botany department of Stanford for
plants whose products have hereto
fore been imported, and for the plants
whose products might be substituted
for those that cannot be imported
now on account of the war.
The botanical raw products com
mittee, a committee under the re
search council of the Council of Na
tional Defense, has asked the Botany
professors to assist in the immense
work of determining the nation's re
sources in raw products. There an:
25,000 species of plants to be studied
and reportd as to the climatic condi
tions in which the plants grow, tho
kind of soil needed for their culture,
and for what they might be used.
The national research council has
ordered the examination of the coun
try's raw products because many com
modities needed for manufacturing
cannot be obtained since the United
States entered the war. It is impera
tive in many cases to finJ substitutes
so as to prevent disastrous results
in manufacturing; in other cases it
is only necessary to dircct the manu
facturer to a new maiket. This is
what the committee aims to do.
