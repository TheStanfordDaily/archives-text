# STAFF EATS (?) TONIGHT
## 
### 
Hoover will leave the campus to
night when The Daily Palo Alto staff
stages its annual freshman "feed" at
the Phi Kappa Psi house. There has
been a noticeable lack of appetite on
the part of the staff members for the
last two days and for this reason the
banquet tonight promises to be well
attended.
The affair is for the members of the
regular staff only and for this reason
tryoutees will not lie allowed to force
their presence on the freshmen of the
staff. The dinner is scheduled to
start at 8 o'clock.
