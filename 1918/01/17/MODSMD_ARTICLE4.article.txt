# Youth, Despondent Over Love Affair, Shoots Self
## 
### 
Driven to a point of insanity over
disappointment in love, Count Maco
vitch Allover, noble member of Theta
Delta Chi fraternity at Stanford, at
tempted suicide yesterday noon dur
ing lunch. The unwitting cause of 1
the tragedy was the Countess Never
stayed Toadovitch,
Rumors of a breach in the love af
fair were heard about the campus yes
terday, and prior to the attempt to
take his life Count Allover was seen
to be in a despondent mood, and
failed to touch his food at lunch.
Suddenly rising, he went to the tele
phone booth, adjacent to the dining
room. A few moments later a muffled
shot was heard, and his limp body
fell through the doorway, his head
crashing against a chair.
As his fraternity brothers sprang to
his side, his left temple was seen to
he coverod with blood, and a smoking
revolver lay on the floor beside
him. It was immediately discovere-l
that the bullet had struck a glancing
blow and the count will recover.
A desperate attempt is being madp
by the principals in the case to cover
up the facts, and it is now being made
to appear that the whole affair was
staged as a joke on his brothers.
While this explanation may be ac
cepted in some quarters, those famil
iar with the "case" are not inclined
tc give if nrpripn^o
