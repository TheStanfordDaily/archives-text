# Fraternity Freshmen Will Smoke Thursday
## 
### 
For the tenth consecutive year
the freshmen and other new men in
the various fraternities will gather
together for a smoker at the Phi
Kappa Psi house a week from this
evening, Thursday, January 25. This
annual freshman smoker has in the
past been given in the fall, but owing
to the crowded last quarter
it was postponed until the presen*
term.
Stunts by the freshmen of several
of the houses will mal up a new
feature of the program n>r this year's
smoker, and eats and unnkes will
circulate as freely as in past vears
