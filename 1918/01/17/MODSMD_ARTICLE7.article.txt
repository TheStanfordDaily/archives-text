# LEAGUE BASKETBALL TO COMMENCE WITH THE GAME TOMORROW
## PLAY TO START AT 7:30 ON GYM FLOOR College of Pacific Varsity Opponents—Babes Meet Oakland High 
### 
League basketball will begin tomor
row night when the Varsity takes on
the five from the College of Pacific in
Encina Gymnasium. The game, which
is scheduled to follow the freshman
contest against the Oakland Hig h
School quintet, will open play in the
California-Nevada Basketball League.
Manager Sullivan has announced tha"
the usual prices of twenty-five cents
for those without student body tick
ets and ten cents for those with the
blue pasteboards will prevail. The
carnival is scheduled to start at 7:30
when the freshmen take the floor.
The Varsity will play its last game
preliminary to the league contests
tonight, when the team journeys to
Oakland for a game with the Oakland
V. M. C. A. "Golds." The Varsity has
not been defeated as yet this year
1 ut they met their hardest competi
tion from the Y. M. C. A. five, and
tonight's play should be fast, since
the Oakland team is anxious to hang
a uuißtiL against tiio Dap
tain Sullivan, Butt, Parks, Schwar
zenbek, Carver, Moulton, and Hood
are scheduled to make the trip.
The freshmen, after their game with
Palo Alto High School tonight, are
primed for their first stiff compete •
tion where they luxe un tho Oakland
High School team tomorrow as a pre
liminary to the Varsity contest.
There has been a hard battle for po
sitions on the 1921 five and tomor
row's game will furnish the first in
dication as to the lineup of the team.
Seanu.n, Phelps, and Swanholm have
been showing to good advantage so
far, but these men may be beaten out
at any time by the other players who
are trying for the team.
The College of Pacific always turns
cut a strong five and it will in all
probability give the Varsity a real
run tomorrow. With the California
series less than a month away, and
with one or two league games each
week, Captain Sullivan will be un
against the proposition of getting a
definite lineup together. The two
guaid positions seem to be well taken
care of in Sullivan and Butt, al
though Parks is showing well. Th<!
forwards are going strong also since
Moulton and Hood, both members of
the Freshman team last year,
working well together. Center is the
weak position 011 the team, and the
real battle is being staged here.
Williams, Carver, and Schwarzenbek
r.re the best candidates left for the
key-place on the five, but none of
these men are experienced in Varsity
competition and it will be a hard job
to pick the best man from them.
The College of Pacific is planning
to come up in force in order to give
its Varsity a good send-off for the
season. With the small prices pre
vailing for the carnival the Cardina 1
fans should turn out in force for the
game, as some real basketball will
undoubtedly be displayed.
