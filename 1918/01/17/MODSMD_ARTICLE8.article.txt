# Mat and Ring Sport Candidates Called
## 
### 
Prospects for the coming season in
boxing and wrestling circles seem to
be on a par with those of other sports.
Both branches have a few old stars
back and are relying on a good turn
out of new men to produce varsity
material. A call for more candidates
has been made by the coaches and
there is an excellent chance for new
men to make the varsity squad in
these sports. The Circle "S" will be
given to those winning matches in
meets with California. The boxing
tournament with California is sched
uled lor March 14.
Three veteran boxers in the middle
weight classes, O. M. Sullivan, '19, J.
T. Murphy, '20, and W. H. Wass, '18,
have returned to college, but aside
from these, the material must be se
lected entirely from new men. Coach
Wise has issued a special call for the
military men not taking part in other
athletics to come out for boxing. His
class meets Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday, between 5 and 6 o'clock, and
will not interfere with military drills.
There is special need for men in
the feather and heavy weights. Last
year's stars who remain should be
aide to give a good account of them
selves in the middle weights. It has
not been decided whether or not
freshmen will be eligible for the var
sity, but they are especially urged to
come out and be in a position to do
something next year.
The turnout among Japanese stu
dents has been exceptionally good
and Coach Wise expects to make a
clean-up in the lightweight events
H. E. Egami, '20, last year's varsity
champion and winner over California
in the 126 pound class, is back in
school. E. R. Fujii, '20, and K. T.
Iseri, '20, are showing up well in
these weights. P. H. Jones, '18, and
C. O. Fenlason, '19, are available ma
terial in the 145-pound class.
