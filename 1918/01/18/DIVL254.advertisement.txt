careful scrutiny and rigid examinations of

stiled against Burglary and hold tip, so that

would prevent the criminals from securing
tile money.

of the Bank's funds, are all bonded in the
American Suretv Co. of New York, so that
the liank is protected against possible loss
both from within and without.

and our money safe is equipped with the best
three clock time lock.

praised at twice the value of the amount
loaned on same.
Eighth—A bank's real security to its depos
itors in its Capital and Surplus. Our bank lias
greater capital and Surplus in proportion to
its deposit liability, than any other bank in
Santa Clara County.
Ninth—Being the only Bank in Mayfield,
and without competition, our management is
not tempted to take chances on loans; a sit
uation always likely to arise where tv\o or
more rival Banks are fighting for business.
Tenth —We are members of the American
Bankers Association and also the California
State Hankers Association which gives us ad
ditional protection, as well as the paid services
of tlie Burns National Detective Agency to

NOTICE TO DEPOSITORS
As a depositor of this Bank yow are inter
ested, and entitled to know, the safeguards
we have adopted for the protection of your
funds.
First —We have been established for 13
years, and are an incorporated State Savings
and Commercial Rank, operating under the
strongest State Hank Law of any State in
the United States, and are subject to most
careful scrutiny and rigid examinations of
the State Banking Department.
Second—The State Bank Law is incompar
ably stronger than the National Bank Law,
especially so far as Savings depositors are
concerned. It is a new law drawn by the
late Governor Johnson progressive legislature,
and modeled after the New York and Massa
chusetts Savings Bank Laws, with many safe
guards added. The public is not yet generally
aware of its protective features. Under its
rules, our Savings Hank must secure with
collateral, your deposits, when loaning its
funds, the law specifically defining the secur
ity we must take. No-such provision exists
either in the National or Commercial Bank
laws. Thus the word Savings printed on our
advertising and stationery means Security to
you. •»
Third—All our Cash on hand is fully in
stiled against Burglary and hold tip, so that
this bank in case of Robbery could not lose.
But in addition to this we carry two bottles
ot high powered chemicals in our safe, which
any explosion would break and the fumes
would prevent the criminals from securing
tile money.
Fourth —Our Officers, who have the custody
of the Bank's funds, are all bonded in the
American Suretv Co. of New York, so that
the liank is protected against possible loss
both from within and without.
Fifth —Our building and fixtures are all
adequately protected against fire, and we also
carry Kmployers liability and compensation in
surance on our employes.
Sixth—Our vault is modern and fireproof,
and our money safe is equipped with the best
three clock time lock.
Seventh—Our loans arc all approved by a
conservative Finance Committee before they
arc made, and all Real Estate must be ap
praised at twice the value of the amount
loaned on same.
Eighth—A bank's real security to its depos
itors in its Capital and Surplus. Our bank lias
greater capital and Surplus in proportion to
its deposit liability, than any other bank in
Santa Clara County.
Ninth—Being the only Bank in Mayfield,
and without competition, our management is
not tempted to take chances on loans; a sit
uation always likely to arise where tv\o or
more rival Banks are fighting for business.

collateral, your deposits, when loaning its

you. •»
