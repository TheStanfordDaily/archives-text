# MANY UNUSUAL BOOKS ARRIVE AT LIBRARY
## 
### 
The Library received a large and
varied shipment of valuable books
this week. Probably the most notable
of these is a set of six volumes by
11. R. Schoolcraft entitled "Informa
tion respecting the history, condition,
and prospects of the Indian tribes of
the United States." This work was
intended to be a great 'encyclopedia
of information relating to the Amer
ican aborigines. Due to Mr. School
craft's lack of scientific training, the
six volumes amount to little more
than a magazine. Badly arranged
and selected as it is, however, it hay
performed very valuable service in
preserving a vast amount of histor
ical data.
The next in importance is an old
French set of fifty volumes which
dates back to 1736. The subject is
"Academie des inscriptions et belles
lettres Histoire et memoires de lit
terature."
Of special interest to the Art de
partment is "La Collection Keleklan.
Etoffes et Tapis D'Orient et de Ven
ice." It is in portfolio form, with
loose leaves, and contains one hun
dred plates, some of which are col
ored. This is a very expensive book.
Twenty volumes, with beautiful
plates, on "Paleontographia Italica,"
by Professor Mario Canavari, and a
German historical set, completed the
shipment.
