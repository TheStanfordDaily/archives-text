# STANFORD VARSITY FIVE TO TANGLE WITH C. OF P.
## FIRST LEAGUE CONTEST TO BE STAGED IN ENCINA GYM 1921 To Take On Oakland High School As Eye-Opening Game 
### 
Stanford and the College of Pacific
fives will hook up tonight at Encina
gymnasium in the first league basket
ball game of the season. Captain
Sullivan anticipates the contest to
be the hardest game of the season,
as the visitors have a larger number
of veterans back than either Cali
fornia or Stanford. The freshman
team will play the Oakland High
School quintet as a preliminary to the
Varsity contest.
Captain Sullivan plans to start
Hood and Moulton at forward,
Schwarzenbek at center, and Butt and
Park at guards. A number of sub
stitutes will be on hand to fill out in
an emergency.
For the freshmen, Seaman and
Fairchild will start in the forward
position, Devlin at center, and Phelps
and Swanholm as guards. The babes
will have a hard game against the
Oakland five, as the visitors carry a
record marked with a number of vic
tories won this season.
The Varsity has recovered from the
game with the Oakland "Golds" last
night, and is all primed to jump on
the long end of the score. Hood and
Moulton have got their combination
going now, and are shooting goals
with clock-like regularity.
The admission will be ten cents
with student body cards and twenty
five cents without them.
