# AN UNNECESSARY OMISSION
## 
### 
Although a reduction in the number of features on the Junior Week
program lias been expected by all, yesterday's announcement that the 1919
festivities would consist merely in an Opera and Prom is to be regretted
as sacrificing too much. Campus opinion is pretty well united in the de
sire for a war-time Junior Week, but there is one essential part of the
program that should not be omitted.
The aquatic sports on the Lake form one of the most enjoyable and
one of the least expensive numbers on the Junior Week calendar ancl
should be retained, in addition to the Opera and Prom.
In view of the seriousness of the present times, the powers that be do
not look with favor on the usual Junior Day this year. Whether or not
we agree with them, a refusal to grant this holiday should not keep the
Nineteeners from staging the customary lake events. The day after the
Prom is Founders' Day, which this year falls on a Saturday. Founders'
Day exercises should express a sober and solemn reverence for the mem
ories of the Stanfords, and the excellent suggestion has been made that
the formal commemoration be observed on Sunday.
Even should this be scheduled for Saturday morning, the afternoon of
Founders' Day is usually devoted to athletics, and at least several hours
could be given over to the Junior aquatics on Lagunita.
The argument is raised that with the Prom all interest in Junior Week
will cease on the part of the University public. No doubt the Prom
makes a fitting close to the spring gayeties, but the assumption that with
it all enthusiasm for such traditional features as the Lagunita day will
cease lacks foundation. The campus public do not want to give this par
ticular feature of Junior Week up and if they can't have it before the
Prom they want it the next day, and the Juniors, through their officer's,
should plan for the lake sports as part of Junior Week, just as in past
years.
