# GODOWSKY PLEASES STANFORD AUDIENCE
## Concert Given by Famous Pianist in Local Assembly Hall 
### 
Leopold Godowsky, by his marvel
ous playing and pleasing selections,
won a decided success in his concert
last night in the Assembly Mall, for
the Peninsula Musical Association.
This was Professor Godowsky's first
appearance before a Stanford audi
ence, and all felt that he was well
named as one of the great masters of
the piano.
Sonata Op. 35, B flat minor, by
Chopin was especially beautiful be
cause of the extreme delicacy of
touch and feeling underlying. "If I
were a Bird," composed by Henselt
and Godowsky, and"In Autumn," by
Moszkowski, were two of the most de
lightful numbers on the program,
being light and airy. Taussig's
"Marche Militaire" was very stirring
and was well placed as the closing
number on the program.
Mr. Godowsky has a most pleasing
personality, with none of the eccen
tricities and long hair of the average
artist. lie is extremely modest, with
a great simplicity in his manner. He
sits placidly at the piano, lays his
long fingers on the keyboard, and
then in another minute they have be
come living, dancing individualities.
The delicacy of his touch and his
splendid selection made the program
most enjoyable, the only criticism
being that it was not long enough.
The third Peninsula Musical con
cert will be given by Efrem Zimbalist,
the celebrated violinist, in the Assem
bly Hall on February 21.
