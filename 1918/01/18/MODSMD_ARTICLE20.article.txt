# INTERCLUB BASEBALL WILL BEGIN MONDAY
## 
### 
Inter-fraternity baseball will start
early next week under the direction
of Baseball Captain Lilly. Houses that
are planning to enter the series should
leport this fact at once so that their
team can be included when the sched
ule is made out. Games may start on
Monday night or, at the latest, on
Tuesday.
Captain Lilly hopes to uncover some
new material in this series. There is
a dearth of heavers out so far this
year, both for the varsity and for the
first-year men, and the receiver's po
sition on the babe's nine seems to be
weak.
Regular work-outs have been held
under Captain Lilly since the men re
ported for the first practice on Wed
nesday. The cold weather has pro
hibited stiff playing, but the men will
be getting in shape for the first game
within the next two weeks. There is
still a fine chance for any man, who
will turn out for practice, of making
a place on the nine.
