## Enrollment at Berkeley Has Slumped by Almost a Thousand 
### 
Stanford is not the only university
hit by the war, as reports from Cali
fornia indicate. The total decrease in
the enrollment at Berkeley is 981, the
number registered on Monday, at the
close of the day, being 4353, as against
5334 in January, 1917. There were
also fewer entrants this year than
last, 283 as against 290. The number
of graduate students attending Cali
fornia, at the present time, is 389 as
against 757 in 1917, that is, about half.
Special students have reduced in
number only from 20 to 14. A de
crease in the registration of under
graduates of 800 indicates what a
large share is felt in those classes,
and also that the attendance of the
university is composed, already,
chiefly of underclassmen.
