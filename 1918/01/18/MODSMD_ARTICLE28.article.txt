Word has been received from the
headquarters of the Western Depart
ment of the War Department calling
attention to the fact that the 319 th
Engineers, located at Camp Fremont,
are being recruited to war strength.
Men possessing the following quali
fications may apply direct to Major
James A. Dorst, Room 1012, Santa Fe
Building, San Francisco.
San Francisco,
January 16, 1918.
ENGINEERS, ATTENTION!
The man who boasts red blood to
day has fight in his eye and if he is
keen and spirited as well, he has
something else in mind —he has ad
venture. The one branch of the ser
vice that embodies all that is adven
turous, inventive, and skillful, is the
Engineer Corps. Working cheerfully
under any difficulty, putting over with
relish the jobs that the • other man
calls impossible, ejecting "pep" into
everything tackled, and, when the call
comes for a fight, letting loose the
stored-up ardor that has made the
branch famous since wars were
known—that's the real manhood —the
real "Engineer."
The 319 th Regiment of Engineers at
Camp Fremont, California, is a new
organization in name only, for its
backbone is taken from the old 3d
Regiment serving until lately in
Hawaii. There they made a record
of daring and accomplishment that
would fill the heart of the fiction
writer with self-pity. They turned
out surveys under almost impossible
conditions, left the other branches in
the dust on hikes and athletics, and
withall, filled themselves with health,
manliness, and clean fun. These men
are receiving their reward in pro
motions to fill a few of the many non
commissioned berths open in the new
organization. Under officers who have
heart and soul in the game, they are
now training for an early chance to
match Yankee brains —which they
typify—with the soulless thing called
"Kultur." Any man who thinks that
lie has the necessary qualifications
may apply to Major J. A. Dorst, Room
1012, Santa Fe Building, San Fran
cisco.
Men possessing the following quali
fications may apply:
Draftsmen, adzemen, carpenters
(skilled), blacksmiths, pipe-fitters,
plumbers, sign painters, men specially
trained in reinforced concrete, ma
chinists, saddlers, farriers, riggers,
cobblers, buglers, horseshoers, wagon
ers (drivers), masons, instrumental
surveyors, topographical sketchers,
photographers or blueprint operators,
carpenters (rough), mine timber men,
track-workers, men specially trained
in signalling (this can be done after
the men join), packers (muleteers),
motorcar and motorcycle drivers,
cable-splicers and rope-splicers,
powder and demolition men, company
clerks (stenographers), cooks (these
are important), electricians (linemen
or engineers), assistant supply clerks
(shipping clerks), barbers, bricklay
ers.
In addition, there will probably be
found use for men having experience
with locomotives, steam, oil, and gas
engines, and almost anything in a
mechanical or constructional line.
The classes of men mentioned abovs
are specially desired, but in every
organization there are always some
who must start at the bottom, and, for
this reason, there will be accepted
men without special training who
possess the necessary capabilities for
self-betterment. Other things being
equal, it is preferable that all men
be of good stature and of good phy
sique, but this is not a rigid rule,
provided that a man's other qualifi
cations are satisfactory. The essen
tial is that all applicants be red
blooded, patriotic Americans, either
native-born or naturalized.

cobblers, buglers, horseshoers, wagon

clerks (stenographers), cooks (these

In addition, there will probably be
found use for men having experience
with locomotives, steam, oil, and gas
engines, and almost anything in a

The classes of men mentioned abovs

blooded, patriotic Americans, either
native-born or naturalized.

The man who boasts red blood to
day has fight in his eye and if he is
keen and spirited as well, he has
something else in mind —he has ad
venture. The one branch of the ser
vice that embodies all that is adven
turous, inventive, and skillful, is the
Engineer Corps. Working cheerfully
under any difficulty, putting over with
relish the jobs that the • other man
calls impossible, ejecting "pep" into
everything tackled, and, when the call

The 319 th Regiment of Engineers at
Camp Fremont, California, is a new
organization in name only, for its
backbone is taken from the old 3d
Regiment serving until lately in
Hawaii. There they made a record
of daring and accomplishment that
would fill the heart of the fiction
writer with self-pity. They turned
out surveys under almost impossible
conditions, left the other branches in
the dust on hikes and athletics, and
withall, filled themselves with health,
manliness, and clean fun. These men
are receiving their reward in pro
motions to fill a few of the many non
commissioned berths open in the new
organization. Under officers who have
heart and soul in the game, they are
now training for an early chance to
match Yankee brains —which they
typify—with the soulless thing called
"Kultur." Any man who thinks that
