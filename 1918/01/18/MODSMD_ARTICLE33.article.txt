# ART GALLERY TO EXHIBIT ETCHINGS BY CALIFORNIANS
## 
### 
A new exhibit of etchings by Cali
fornia artists will take the place of
the Pennell lithographs in the
Thomas Welton Stanford Art Gal
lery ,and will be installed and ready
i'or the public Sunday morning. These
prints are on a circuit, beginning at
St. Louis and traveling throughout
the southwest ,and after leaving Stan
ford will be sent to Sacramento and
Washington. They are by well known
artists, most of whom are of southern
California, and a few of whom are
former Stanford students. The or
ganization which has charge of the
exhibit is the California Society of
Etchers, the largest society of its kind
in America. There are but two other
like organizations in the countryâ€”a
Chicago society and the American In
stitute of Graphic Art of New York.
All methods of producing artistic
prints will be shown at the exhibit,
and arrangements have been made for
an explanation through the use of a
display case containing engraved
plates with the tools used.
Most famous of the artists included
is perhaps Benjaman Brown, of south
ern California. May Gearhart, super
intendent of art in Los Angeles
schools, is represented, and W. S.
Rice, head of Fremont High School
of Oakland, contributes some well
done wood-block etchings. An origi
nal piece of work by Frank B. Lemos,
brother of Mr. P. J. Lemos, curator of
Stanford Museum, is entitled "To
Joaquin Miller."
Bessie Ella Hazen is among the
leading artists doing monotypes, a
process which requires direct appli
cation of the brush to the metal,
which is then transferred to paper
through the press. John Winkler,
whose composition is much like that
of Whistler, is perhaps the best known
among the group; he has done work
about San Francisco, and has found
bits to equal any material available in
European Latin quarters.
Some attractive color etchings are
done by the painter Mayliew, and a
group of seven by Mr. Lemos of Stan
ford. The latter have been shown in
eastern exhibits, some of which have
been done by the aquitint process,
where resin is placed on the metal;
this process is the most difficult of all,
as it requires a thorough knowledge of
the time needed for each action of the
acid.
Etching is of very old origin, and
was begun by Rembrandt, the Dutch
artist. Most of the old masters used
it, men like Millet, Van Dyke, Meryon,
the Frenchman, Jackque, Legres, Tis
set, Danysigny, and the two English
men, Sir Joshua Reynolds and Sir Sey
mor Heyden. Of the recent artists,
Whistler stands out as the foremost
etcher, much of the work of the pres
ent time reflecting back to his meth
ods.
