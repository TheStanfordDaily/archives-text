# TWENTY WANTED FOR AMBULANCE SECTIONS
## 
### 
Sections 614, 615, and 616 of the
California Ambulance unit are still in
need of twenty men to complete their
full strength. These sections are
composed principally of former stu
dents of Stanford and of California,
although a number have come from
Yale and small colleges of southern
California. These have been training
at Allentown, Pennsylvania, several
months and expect to leave for
France in February, although no of
ficial date has been set for their de
parture.
Recruits will be sent first to Fort
McDowell, where they will be quar
antined for twenty days before lead
ing for Allentown, hence the neces
sity of signing up immediately. Men
in the best physical condition will
be preferred because of the short
time remaining for intensive training
before going across. From Fort Mc-
Dowell men enlisting will be sent
directly to Allentown. In case of fail
ure to recruit the sections to the re
quired strength, two will be filled
from the third and sent to France.
