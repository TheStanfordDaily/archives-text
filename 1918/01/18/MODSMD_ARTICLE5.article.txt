# Washington's Birthday Parade
## Will Be Staged by the "500" 
### 
In one more phase of college life
women are replacing the men. This
time the women are upholding a treas
ured Stanford tradition which will
soon die out if men become fewer on
ihe campus. The preservation of this
custom will be more effeminate and
gentle, due to more refined tastes of
the women, but the 500 will carry on
for future classes the glorious cele
brations. In other words, the Y. W.
C. A. is planning a Washington's
birthday parade for the association
supper to be held February 22.
