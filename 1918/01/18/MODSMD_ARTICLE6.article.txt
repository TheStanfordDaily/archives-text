War time economy was the watch
word of the Kansas University Junior
Prom, the biggest event of their so
cial season, held last Friday evening.
Taxis, flowers, dress suits, elaborate
decorations and everything which
formerly tended to make the affair
formal were done away with, except
good music. Patriotic decorations,
red, white, and blue bunting, and the
flags of the United States and Allies
were the decorations used.
