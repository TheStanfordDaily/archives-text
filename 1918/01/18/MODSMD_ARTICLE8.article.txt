## Food Conservation Subject of Talk by Member of Food Administration 
### 
That it is necessary for all college
women to become vitally interested
in food values and food conservation
in order to have the educated women
of the country able to set an example
to others is the content of a telegram
from Herbert C. Hoover, read by
President Wilbur yesterday afternoon
when he introduced the state food ad
ministration's speaker, Miss Charlotte
Ebetts, to a campus audience in the
Little Theater.
Dr. Wilbur read other telegrams
stating that Denmark has 22,000,000
bushels of wheat less than in 1916
and 10,000,000 bushels less than when
the people were put on bread rations;
and that there is a like shortage in
France, Switzerland, and England. In
Switzerland only one-fifth of a pound
of butter is allotted to an individual
for a month.
"We are asking our Allies to wait
eight months before we can harvest
another crop of wheat," said Wilbur.
"If we do not restrict ourselves so
that we can feed them in the mean
time they can't hold out, and we will
lose the war. This is a responsibility
we can not escape, and every bit of
extravagance in the matter is a con
tribution to the Kaiser."
Miss Ebetts made a plea for college
people to learn to regard food as a
big force in the world. "Food is the
