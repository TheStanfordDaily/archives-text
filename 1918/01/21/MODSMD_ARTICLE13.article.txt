						JOB FOR SENIORS

### 
Men's Conference is to take action at its next meeting in reference to
the proposed change in the qualifications for elibigility to Student Coun
cil. The amendment suggested would provide for the election to the Coun
cil each spring of two sophomores, who will be juniors the following fall,
these two men to hold office for two years. The other member to be
chosen would be elected at large, and would preferably be a student who
would be a senior the following year.
Continuity of personnel in the Council is the aim of the amendment
and those who propose it believe that their plan would bring about a unity
in Council policy and action which would make its adoption desirable.
Each year under normal conditions there would be two Council members
with a year of practical experience in office behind them.
There is no question but that continuity of personnel in the Council
would be desirable, but if in order to obtain it, two of the five members
must be juniors, we do not believe it is advisable. Membership on the
council should be restricted to seniors or graduate students as they are
the ones to have to pass on disciplinary cases in all the classes. This is
a serious responsibility which should not in our opinion be placed in the
hands of any but the most capable fourth-year students.
The duties of a Council member can be assumed by a senior student
and administered within a few weeks just as effectively as if he had held
oliice during his junior year. The unity that prevails in the Council under
the present system of senior membership is sufficient for working pur
poses and whatever slight increase in unity might be brought about by the
plan to elect junior members is not justified for it is more important to
have the position filled by students who are older and more experienced in
undergraduate life.
