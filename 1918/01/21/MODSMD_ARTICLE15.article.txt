# OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY BASEBALL GIVEN GYM MEN
## 
### 
Men who desire to go out for base
ball who are now classed in one of
the other major or minor sports may
change from their group to baseball
by making known such intentions to
Instructor Knollin at Encina Gym.
Owing to the scarcity of material it
was decided to take this course in or
der to secure some of the good men
registered in the other groups. It may
be rocalled that a restriction prohib
iting a change after January 12 was
previously announced. The service
has taken so many of last year's best
players that this action was found
necessary.
