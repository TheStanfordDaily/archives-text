# GOVERNMENT WANTS TELEPHONE GIRLS WHO SPEAK FRENCH
## 
### 
Calls are constantly coming for men
in the various branches of the serv
ice, but the following is one of the
first official demands for women for
positions in the army. The military
buereau at the University of Califor
nia has sent out the following infor
mation relative to telephone opera
tors for duty in France:
The telephone unit is to be com
posed of young women who are physi
cally fit, and who speak the French
and English languages fluently. It is
I preferred that these young ladies have
I had experience in telephone switch
! board operating. However, in the
! event that we are unable to fill the
i unit from switchboard operators, of
i rast experience, who answer the lin
guistic requirements, others who can
speak both languages will be taught
at certain points in the United tSates
to operate the .telephone switchboard.
No information can be given as to the
locality in which this unit will be sta
â–  tioned other than that it will be
placed'on duty abroad.
The unit will be divided into dif
ferent grades, with salaries as fol
lows: Chief operator, $125; super
visors, $72; toll operators, $00; local
operators, $G0; substitutes, $50. In
addition to the pay set forth herein,
I they will receive rations and quarters
Is accorded army nurses. Transporta-
J tion will be furnished those selected,
| from their homes to Washington, and
| of course from Washington to what
! other point they are sent.
This will be the only unit composed
; of women which will actually wear
! army insignia.
j This unit will be very similar to tjie
1 British Women's Auxiliary Corps, the
! signal branch of which has gained
] considerable fame in France. Those
| selected for the unit will be furnished
I with further information as to the
' probable date that they will be re
quired to report in Washington, and
if necessary, they will be given a let
! (er to the person in charge of the
j nearest telephone school for instruc
tion. As soon as the person is fully
prepared for duty, aa indicated by the
report from the telephone instructor,
transportation requests and travel or
ders will be furnished the persons
concerned.
It should be understood by all con
cerned that it is absolutely necessary
for all to be able to speak both the
trench and English languages flu
ently. Such persons that may come

to Washington through misrepresen
tation of their ability to speak French
or English will be rejected from the
unit, unless they have been furnished
112. statement from this office, subse
quent to the date of this letter, to the
contrary.
