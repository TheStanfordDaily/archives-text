All women who can swim are
urged to report to Mrs. Brandsten to
practice for a swimming meet which
is to be held Saturday, February 23,
for the entertainment of the Y. W. C.
A. conference. Due to the six weekrs'
training rule, all those who are not
already signed up in classes are re
quired to report immediately for
practice.
The Y. W. C. A. conference is to be
held at Stanford, February 22, 23 and
24, and all the women's organizations
are planning to furnish entertainment
of some kind. The W. A. A. will later
plan other events for the occasion.
