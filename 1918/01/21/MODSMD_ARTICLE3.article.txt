# AMBULANCE MEN RETURN FROM EUROPEAN FRONTS
## 
### 
"It was a grand sight to see the
Statue of Liberty in New York har
bor," was the greeting of H. C. Blote,
ex. '18, and W. R. Malm, '17, who ar
rived on the campus today from
France. Both men were in the first
Stanford ambulance unit to leave the
University for the western front.
Plote was in the second unit in the
Ralkins, while Malm remained in
France all the time. The two former
ambulance men returned with the
American flag which was presented to
the first unit in France and which was
the first banner to be officially used on
the German front or decorated for
bravery.
"Stanford should be proud of every
one of her men in France," said Blote.
"They have gained the respect of
every person they have come up
against. Our unit was the first to be
cited for bravery in the Champagne
and Verdun sectors and the men kept
up the good record all through their
period of service."
Malm and Blote left Paris on De
cember 2, following the return of the
second unit from the Balkins, and
reached London the next day. They
stayed in that city for two or three
days, then embarked at Liverpool for
America. Their boat was held in the
harbor for five days Â«mh everyone on

board, clue to the fact that the port
was closed on account of submarines.
The vessel finally left one foggy night,
but was without a convoy. "The life
savers were quite the fashion on the
trip. Everyone wore them all the
time." The only excitement, however,
in addition to a fight which was staged
in the dining saloon, was target prac
tice by the gunners on the liner. The
two men reached New York on De
cember 22.
lilote returned to the United States
to make an attempt for the aviation
corps, while Malm will return to
Washington, where he will carry on
work in the War Department as an
experimentor in gas. Malm while on
the western front was sous chef of
his section, number 14. Blote was in
the combined sections, numbers 14
and 10, in the Balkans. Both men
left in July of last year for the front.
Blote was attacked with typhus fever
while in Albania and sick most of the
time.
An assembly will oe held at the
University a week from Thursday for
the purpose of presenting the flag
Blote and Malm brought back to the
University. At the same time both
men will tell some of their experiences
in Europe and of the men who are in
Ihe war zone from Stanford at the
present time.
