# "Get me a Gun" Disturbs Encina
## 
### 
"Get me a gun! get me a gun!" was
the frantic cry that disturbed Encina.
last night, and men looked out of
their doors to see E. Baldwin Harper,
'20, well known actor, promoter, and
militarist, tearing up and down the
halls, waving his arms with murder
ous intent. What might have hap
pened had the gun been supplied is
too awful to imagine, for the usual
cherubic physiognomy of Baldwin was
red and distorted with anger, and he
choked as he said, "It's pure burglary
—nothing less." There have been
no legal proceedings.
When Baldwin came home to his
room from some unknown social
function, he found his desk, with all
its contents —books, sophomore play
manuscripts, jar of hair vasoline,
women's pictures, and tobacco in
cluded —gone. And in its place was
a note saying: "This desk has been
attached in payment of a bad debt.
Hoping everything is entirely satis
factory, I am , (Sheriff)."
Baldwin took one look, and rushed
from the room, threatening to kill
anyone who came in his way. He
telephoned Farm Manager Hewston,
the Palo Alto Chief of Police, and
summoned the night watchman of the
Hall.
With the aid of all these, a thor
ough investigation was carried out.
No one rooming near the victim of
the plot had seen anyone go in or out.
The desk had seemed mysteriously to
vanish. A search for finger prints
was begun.
"You see—" began Baldwin, point
difo'ut the i ooiii —and then his
mouth flew open, and he looked for
a mouse-hole to crawl into. In plain
view in a back corner, with a blanket
thrown over it, was the missing desk.
Smothered snickers were heard out
side the door.
"Get me a gun! get me a gun!" was
the frantic cry that disturbed Encina.
