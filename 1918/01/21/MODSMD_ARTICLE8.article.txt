# ELECTRICAL PLANT WILL BE ERECTED NEAR PRESS OFFICE
## 
### 
Plans are completed and work
begun on a new electrical plant to be
built in the corporation yards near
the University Press building.
The new plant became necessary
because of several new structures
which have been erected on the cam
pus making additional lines and
larger cables necessary, as well as
calling for more room on the switch
board.
It will change the center of elec
trical distribution from the station
nnder the Law building to a more
convenient location near the store
rooms and timekeeper's office.
The building may not be completed
for ii year owing to the poor facilities
for transporting materials.
Six new lamp-poets on the campus
are now being wired. It is planned
that the post across from Wilson's
will mark the opening of a double
road, now being, graded, v, hich is to
run past the new quadrangle where
the library is being constructed.
Four cement posts will be erected at
each end of the quadrangle to hold
chains tor both roads.
