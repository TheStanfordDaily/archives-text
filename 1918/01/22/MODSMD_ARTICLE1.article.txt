# A.S.S.U. RETURNS SHOW THAT WOMEN FELL BEHIND MEN
## CAMPAIGN TO CONTINUE Few Women Buy Student Body Ticketsâ€”Response of Men Is Good 
### 
But 86 women out of the
I've hundred registered in the Uni
versity are holders of membership
cards in the Associate Students. This
fact was given out today by Graduate
Manager O. M. Sullivan, in the drive
for more student body members. A.
S. S. U. memberships among the men
number four hundred and sixtv-one, a
little over half of the men enrolled.
Membership cards include a sub
scription to the Daily Palo Alto,
which alone costs $1.25 a quarter. Ar
rangements can be made by any stu
dent body member to transfer his sub
scription to any other address. By
this method, the Daily is now being
sent to many men in France.
Besides this, a membership card en
titles the holder to reduced admission
to all athletic games during the quar
ter, with but few exceptions. It also
carries with it the privilege of par
ticipating in student tiody elections.
A. S. S. U. cards for women entitle
them to all the privileges of the
Women's Athletic Association, as well
a* participation in all student body
activities.
Last quarter, many groups on the
campus had hundred per cent mem
bership in the student body. Among
these was the Japanese Club. It is
hoped by the graduate manager that
(his good record will be duplicated.
Membership cards can be obtained
from the graduate manager's office, or
from H. S. PettingitT, "17, who is cap
taining the drive. Pettingill has ap
pointed men to worn among the dif
ferent groups in the interest of the
campaign.
