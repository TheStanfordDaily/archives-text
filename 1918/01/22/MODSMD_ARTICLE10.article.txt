# NOTED SINGER WILL ENTERTAIN TONIGHT AT LITTLE THEATER
## 
### 
Tonight's Tuesday evening meeting
will take the form of a song recital,
given by Miss Amy Holman, contralto.
This is the second time that Stanford
has had an opportunity to hear her,
as she sang here last year.
Miss Holman has had considerable
experience in Much work, and her
musical ability is well and favorably
known in the state, particularly in
Berkeley and Palo Alto circles.
After a thorough musical education,
she went to Europe at the outbreak
of the war and spent some time in
singing to the wounded British sol
diers in their hospitals behind the
battle-lines. She returned to this
country about a year ago.
The recital will be given, as usual,
in the Little Theater, Room 100, at
7:30.
