# PLAN COMPETITION FOR TRACK SQUAD IN SHORT EVENTS
## FIRST MEET SATURDAY Arrangements Indefinite for Season Scheduleâ€”Coach Much Pleased 
### 
Track men will probably have their
first competitive petition of the year
Saturday in the form of a shortened
distance meet, according to plans an
nounced yesterday by temporary track
coach R. L. Templeton, '18. Nothing
definite has been decided as yet but it
is planned to put the squad through its
first hard workouts in competition
over shortened distances.
This will be the first time that the
squad will enter into any sort of com
petition, and so will give the first line
on the men who are aspirants for track
honors. If it is definitely decided to
hold the meet Saturday, the men will
be asked to sign up in one even*
only, as Templeton believes in light
competition for the early part of (he
season.
The way the men have responded to
the call for candidates and the spirit
they have shown in their early work
outs have pleased the captain and
coach, who reason that with the nu
cleus of numbers and spirit, the tal
ent is sure to be discovered and de
veloped. It is too early in Ihe season
to determine who are showing up
well and even the meet Saturday will
give only the most tentative idea of
the Cardinal hopes.
It is doubtful if much outside com
petition will be available for the team
tliis year, due to the war conditions
Santa Clara may compete with tlio
Stanford teams, while every effort is
being made to get some sort of com
petition from the men at Camp Fre
mont. Alvah Richards, Olympic
Games high jumper, is at Fremont, as
are many other track stars, including
several who are former Stanford men.
