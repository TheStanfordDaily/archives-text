# A 						MEMORIAL FLAG FOR STANFORD
## 
### 
Two of the Stanford men who left the University to take up amulance
.work in France and in the Balkans have returned to the "Farm" for a brief
visit before entering other branches of service. They bring back with them
the American (lag presented to the first Stanford unit in France in the name
of the University. This presentation marked the first occasion on which
the Stars and Stripes were officially used at the front and this ilag was
the first to be decorated on account of the bravery of the unit which pos
sessed it.
Thus far there has been no memorial suggested for the Stanford men
who have gone into the service. We do not necessarily have to wait
until wc receive word of Stanford men being killed in action to remember
those who have joined the colors; we should create some suitable me
morial for the living men of the University who are giving themselves
in war service today.
What better way to remember them than by placing this (lag, which
was presented to one of the groups of Stanford men in service, where all
undergraduates can see it, in the Memorial Court, after it is formally
presented to the University at the assembly next week? Perhaps a
University service flag would be the most complete way to honor all the
Stanford men serving their country in the war, but until such a flag or
an equivalent memorial is furnished, the ambulance unit flag will well
supply the deficiency.
It should be honored and respected by every undergraduate and bv
every other member of the campus community as standing for Stanford's
sacrifice of her young men in answer to her country's call.
