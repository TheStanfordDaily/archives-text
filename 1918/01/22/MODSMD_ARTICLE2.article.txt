Dr. Wilbur will address the mem
bers of the Stanford Service Club to
morrow afternoon at 4:30 in the Little
Theater. It is believed that he will
talk to the military men on the sub
ject of food conservation.
This is the first meeting of the
Service Club since its organization
last Wednesday, when officers were
elected, and it was planned to meet ;
regularly at weekly intervals. An
attempt is being made to secure in
teresting speakers for each time the
men come together.
The Stanford Service Club was or
ganized to further military efficiency
among advanced students in the R. O.
T. C'., and to promote an element of
fellowship and understanding among
the Stanford military men and the
Camp Fremont soldiers. All students
who arc taking advanced military
work and upperclassmen are eligible
to membership.
ft is hoped that the meeting in the
Little Theater tomorrow will be well
attended.
