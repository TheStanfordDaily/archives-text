## 
### 
Pan-Hellenic held a meeting yes
terday to continue the discussion oT
rushing and bidding. No new decis
ions were made in regard to sopho
more rushing although the sororities
were unanimously against it. Miss
Bradford declared that she favored
the matter because it was desirable
for the new students to get the
"Hall" spirit for a year. She said
this would keep them from being
confused and unsettled when the time
came to decide upon a sorority.
If, after considering the matter,
however, the sororities still favor
freshman rushing, Dr. Wilbur will no
doubt give his approval.
Miss Bradford again urges that
rules be made to govern Christmas
and spring rushing. She thinks some
definite arrangements necessary to
prevent too early bidding.
