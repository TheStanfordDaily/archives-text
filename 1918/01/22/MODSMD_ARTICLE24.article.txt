1. There has been established at
Fort Monroe, Va., and will be main
tained throughout the war, a training
camp from whose graduates will be
appointed all officers of coast artil
lery. The course is of three months'
duration, commencing early in Janu
ary, April, July and October. The
number of students will vary accord
ing to the prospective needs of the
service. Only enlisted men of the
coast artillery are admitted, selection
being made by boards of officers con
vened in all commands about a month
lefore the beginning of each course.
2. The coast artillery is charged
with the defense of harbors in the
United States and the insular posses
sions, both by guns and by submarine
mines; and with the service in Europe
of the railroad artillery, the anti-air
craft batteries, the greater part of the
heavy motor-drawn urtrllery, and the
heavy trench mortar batteries. For
officers of this service men of good
education are needed, preferably col
lege graduates or those who have com
pleted the greater purt of the college
course. Electrical and mechanical en
gineers are especially desired, but
technical education is not a necessity.
Excellent oportunities for promotion
are offered to men of this class, after
very short enlisted service. In the
belief that many of your alumni and
Mndergraduates may be interested in
this branch of the military service,
ibis matter is brougvir to your atten
tion, with the request that you give it
the widest publicity.
