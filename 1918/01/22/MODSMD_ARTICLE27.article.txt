The University of Kansas has re
cently published a list of 50 men in
service. Of this number seven are
majors, twenty-one are captains and
sixty-two are first lieutenants. The
list is far from complete and the
"Daily Kansan" is of the belief that
there are at least 1500 men from that
institution in service at the present
time.
A record in vaccination was recent
ly made when the Univeristy of Kan
sas hospital vaccinated 208 students
in one day. All these sore arms came
as a result of a new university ruling
that all students must be vaccinated
for small-pox.
A press bulletin issued by the Uni
versity of Wisconsin says that that in

ment service. Forty-seven of this

Fifteen hundred military cadets and
500 aviators will drill and parade at
