# Fremont Offers to Leave Campus House?
## 
### 
Officers from Camp Fremont who
have been living on the campus will
return to the camp. Orders from the
War Department at Washington re
quire all company officers to he pres
ent at reveille at 6:30 a. m. This or
der makes it impossible for the offi
cers to live on the campus and reach
the camp in time. As a result, resi
dent officers will pack their comfort
kits and move back to army cots, and
'able cloths will be only pleasant
memories.
