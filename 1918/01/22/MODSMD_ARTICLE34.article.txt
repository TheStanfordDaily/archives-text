## 
### 
Dr. Jordan addressed the members
of the Cosmopolitan Club last night
at his home, in an informal discus
sion of the international situation in
general. He spoke on a variety of
topics, from Belgium to the Indian
Home-rule question.
In touching on that inevitable sub
ject, the war, he said: "If the war
lasts until after next summer every
body over there will be dead, if only
on account of the lack of supplies.
Before negotiations for peace can be
entered upon there will have to be a
revolution in Germany, for a perman
ent peace can be contracted only with
the German people, never with the
Kaiser. The hope for Europe in the
future is England; it is to her that
the other countries look to be pointed
the way otward democracy."
In referring to the Indian Home
rule siuation he said that while India
had undoubtedly suffered many injus
tices under the old Tory rule, condi
tions are rapidly improving under the
present Liberal control. "War times."
he said, "is not the time for sweep
ing political reforms. The govern
ment has too many pressing matters
on its hanjls."
