former Encina men who are now in
Europe.

first Encina dance, which will take
place on the evening of February 2:

A motion to the effect that the Club

vote. The service flag will be erected
on the flag pole which is now in front
of the Hall, and two other poles will
be put up each side of it for the
other two flags. An effort will be
made to secure the service Hag in

for the coming dance.
