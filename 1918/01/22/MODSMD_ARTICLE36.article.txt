# DR. WILBUR WILL TALK TO HOUSE MANAGERS
## 
### 
House managers from the various
men's living groups will be addressed
tonight by Dr. Wilbur at a dinner
to be held at the Pbi Theta Delta
house at 6:15. He is scheduled to
speak on food conservation and to
furnish a further impetus to the
"Hooverization" movement which has
been more or less observed by the
various living groups during the pres
ent year. The dinner will be held
under the auspices of the campus food
administration, which has somewhat
extended its scope since last quarter.
