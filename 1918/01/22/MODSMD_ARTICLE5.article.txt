### 
Stanford will play the San Jose Y.
M. C. A. basketball team at Encina
gymnasium Wednesday night for the
main event of the evening and the
freshmen will go up against the Fre
mont army five for the preliminaries.
Captain Sullivan has put the varsity
through a hard siege of practice since
the contest with the College of Pa
cific. It is probable that the same
men that played in the game will start
out against the San Jose basket
tossers.
The freshmen give indications of
improvement since tlieir game with
the Oakland High School team. On
the strength of this, they will prob
ably give the soldiers a good game.
The usual prices of admission will
admit students to the games.
