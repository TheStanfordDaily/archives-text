"It is a fine personal ideal to want
to be instrumental in saving and not
destroying men, but it is obvious that
the Hun under present conditions is
not to be argued with by humaniar
ians," wrote P. W. Farris in a letter
to Professor Alden.
Farris went to France with the sec
ond Stanford Ambulance Corps, and,
after returning from service in Al
bania, entered the aviation service.
"You probably wore a bit sur
prised that I changed from ambulance
work to aviation," he writes, "for that
was farthest from my mind when I
left America. Hut I have seen things
about the war since that have changed

my ideas about war necessities, and
the order of importance in activi
ties."
"Hefore our unit was disbanded I
was assured in my own mind thai
the place for every able-bodied man
was in the service for which he was
best suited physically and that pei
sonal ideas would have to be sacri
ficed for the good of the whole.
"Aviation looked to me like the
most important factor in the winning.
I passed the examination without dif
ficulty, and am now waiting for head
quarters organization to take care of
matters."
