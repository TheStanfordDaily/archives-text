# Chappie Creates Campus Styles in New Fashion Page
## 
### 
In a green and white cover thai
looks like winter in California, the
January Chaparral will make its be
late dappearance on the Stanford
quad Thursday.
This issue of the joke sheet harkens
back to the old style cover with the
jovial "Chappie" and a cartoon on the
outside. "Monk" Antrim illustrates a
well known, appropriate Bible verse
for the cover.
In his editorial capacity Chappie
takes a shot at his contemporary, The
Daily Palo Alto, and his ancient
enemy, California. He extends a bit
of advice to students in teh University
to avoid being slackers in college, and
to remember that the boys in France
are hungry for news.
A double-page suggestion of styles
is contributed by R. C. Alexander, '21.
In addition to the usual funny stuff
submitted by W. E. Antrim, S. E.
Briggs, and R. U. Taylor, George Hall
sent over a full-page drawing from
France. Other contributors from
over the water are B. C. Wohlford,
Lance Warren, and R. A. Doldalson,
Contributors to this issue are G. C
Smith, ex-'lO, T. S. Patterson, '18, M.
L. Levy, '19, A. S. Glikbarg, '19, H. S.
