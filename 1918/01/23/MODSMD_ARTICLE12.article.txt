# HEAVY WAR TAX WILL HIT COLLEGE FUNDS
## 
### 
Stanford, along with other universi
ties and colleges in America, will liave
to pay 10 per cent on all athletic re
ceipts to the government as a war
tax.
Some doubt as to this existed, and
the University of Chicago put up to
officials of the internal revenue de
partment a test, exemption claim.
This was based on the ground that
the profits derived from football and
other athletics are used for educa
tional purposes. The collector at Chi
cago assigned men to investigate the
case, and they reported that, in their
opinion, the university should pay the
tax. The report was forwarded to
Washington, and the final decision
that the institutions must pay the tax
was issued from there.
Athletic managers who fail to collect
the tax from the purchasers of ticlcets
will liave to dig down into the funds
in their hands to settle with Uncle
Sam.
