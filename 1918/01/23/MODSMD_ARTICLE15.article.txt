# STANFORD PROFESSORS TEACH SOLDIERS FRENCH
## ASSIGNED TO REGIMENTS Camp Fremont Officers to Pass Instruction on to Enlisted Men 
### 
Professors and instructors of the
Romanic Language department are to
teach the officers of Camp Fremont
French for use when they cross "the
pond," as a result of a conference yes
terday between members of the de
partment, Y. M. C. A. secretaries and
headquarters officers at Camp Fre
mont.
Four Groups Provided.
Officers and men of the camp will
be divided into four groups for pur
poses of instruction. The first group
will consist of two officers picked
from each regiment to be trained as
interpreters for regimental command
ers, and translators of dispatches, po
sitions of great importance "over
there." They are to be instructed by
the leading professors.
Two officers from each company
make up the second group. They will
be taught enough French to enable
them to attend to the affairs of a com
pany in France in such matters as
purchasing supplies.
All the remaining officers are in
cluded in the third group. These will
receive their instructions from the
men who make up class No. 1. The
enlisted men are to be in group four,
which will- be taught by the officers
of the second division when they
themselves have learned sufficient
military and conversational French to
become in turn teachers.

tion at Fremont:
