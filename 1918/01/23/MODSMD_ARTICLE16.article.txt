## Food Conservation Methods on Campus Outlined in Talk Last Night 
### 
That an urgent necessity of enter
ing into the policies of food conserva
tion outlined by Hoover for the na
tion to the limit exists on the Stan
ford campus, was brought home to
the house managers of the fraterni
ties yesterday evening at a. dinner at
the Phi Delta Theta house. President
Wilbur was the principal speaker, and
talks were also made by Assistant
Registrar McDowell and by Campus
'*ood Administrator Jones.
"The primary object of food con
servation is not to save money, but
to win the war." was the keynote
struck by Dr. Wilbur in his talk.
"If we don't send food over," he
continued, "we will lose the war; if
i we don't save the food we can't send
I it over, and unless we eat less than
last year along certain lines, there
won't be any saved.'
President Wilbur pointed out the
rigid economies now in force through
■ out the allied countries in Europe,
; showed how lack of food caused the
Russian collapse, which means the
! -acrifice of thousands of additional
American lives, and told how Ger
many had saved her food by living on
the foreign countries her troops were
occupying.
American troops have eaten too
much of th« French food al
ready owing to slowness of
the American people to re
spond to the requests of (lie food con
servation bureau, according to Presi
dent Wilbur, who pointed out that
pork products, such as ham, bacon
and lard, and white flour were most
needed for shipment to the front and
that it was up to the people of Stan
ford University and of the whole
United States to stint themselves in
these foods.
"Unless these products are saved,"
110 said, "we are likely to lose the war
before we get the bulk of our men
'over there.' We can't allow a Euro
pean collapse on account of shortage
of food."
This afternoon Dr. Wilbur is ad
dressing the members of the Stanford
Service Club and the R. O. T. C. in
the Little Theatre .along the same
lines, in order to get the complete and
intelligent support to this program of
food conservation.

That an urgent necessity of enter
ing into the policies of food conserva
tion outlined by Hoover for the na
tion to the limit exists on the Stan
ford campus, was brought home to
the house managers of the fraterni
ties yesterday evening at a. dinner at
the Phi Delta Theta house. President
Wilbur was the principal speaker, and
talks were also made by Assistant
Registrar McDowell and by Campus
'*ood Administrator Jones.
"The primary object of food con
servation is not to save money, but
to win the war." was the keynote
struck by Dr. Wilbur in his talk.
"If we don't send food over," he
continued, "we will lose the war; if
i we don't save the food we can't send
I it over, and unless we eat less than
last year along certain lines, there
won't be any saved.'
President Wilbur pointed out the
rigid economies now in force through
■ out the allied countries in Europe,
; showed how lack of food caused the
Russian collapse, which means the
! -acrifice of thousands of additional
American lives, and told how Ger
many had saved her food by living on
the foreign countries her troops were
occupying.
American troops have eaten too
much of th« French food al
ready owing to slowness of
the American people to re
spond to the requests of (lie food con
servation bureau, according to Presi
dent Wilbur, who pointed out that
pork products, such as ham, bacon
and lard, and white flour were most
needed for shipment to the front and
that it was up to the people of Stan
ford University and of the whole
United States to stint themselves in
these foods.
"Unless these products are saved,"
110 said, "we are likely to lose the war
before we get the bulk of our men
'over there.' We can't allow a Euro
pean collapse on account of shortage
of food."
