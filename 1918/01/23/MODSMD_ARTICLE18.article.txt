# SAVING FOOD TO WIN THE WAR
## 
### 
Stanford has done much in the matter of food saving since the fall.
There has been a conscientious attempt on the part of almost everybody to
carry out the Hoover plan on the campus. In this, the co operative sys
tem entered into by most of the fraternity houses and directed by a cen
tral food administrator, has been a great aid.
Still greater economies along certain lines are necessary. Unless every
person in the United States reduces the quantity of certain products
consumed our soldiers and those of our allies will not have food. Unless
prompt action is taken along this lino we are likely to lose the war before
we are in it with anything like our full forces.
The primary object of this food conservation is not to save money,
although that is a commendable aim at the present time, it is to win the
war.
Two products are especially needed for shipping to our men at the
front, pork and white flour. The quantity of pork now used on the cam
pus is immaterial, but white flour can be saved to a considerably greater
extent than before. White bread should be eliminated entirely from Stan
ford tables and the amount of white-flour crackers should be reduced.
Other kinds of flour should be substituted for white flour in cooking. A
greater saving in sugar is also necessary.
These economies and all others that become necessary as the war con
tinues should be adopted intelligently, wholeheartedly and cheerfully by
every person or group of persons on the campus at once. There can be no
truer test of Stanford patriotism than the readiness and thoroughness
with which we respond to the call of duty, in this matter of food conser
vation.
