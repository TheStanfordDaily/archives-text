# Amy Holman Gives Pleasing Program
## Audience Enjoys Tuesday Evening Concert by Talented Singer 
### 
A song recital given by Miss Amy
Holman, contralto, including a repe
toire of Italian, French, Scotch, Eng
lish, and Irish songs, pleased an audi
ence which til led the Little Theater to
overflowing last night.
Miss Holman offered a lyric pro
gram which set off distinctively the
full, rich and sympathetic qualities
of her voice. "In Questa Tomba,"
Beethoven, of her first group, was
rendered with admirable fullness of
tone, whereas ".leuenes Fillettes,"
Dalayrac, of the second group, re
vealed more of the operatic quality.
A series of folk songs were well
received, the catchiest of them,
"Charley is my Darling," a Scotch
ballad, "B for Harney," an Irish air,
and "Twanky-dillo," an old folk song
from Sussex, kept the house tense
with amusement and interest.
"A Birthday," by Cowen, a familiar
song on the concert stage, concluded
the evening. As an encore Miss
Holman sang an original war song
composed by one of the "Tommies"
in the trenches, called "Somewhere in
France." The song was obtained dur
ing a recent visit to Europe, at
which time Miss Holman visited tin•
trenchcs in Flanders and sang for
the Hritish troops. She frankly ad
mitted that the song lacked musical
merit, which her audience as frankly
repudiated by its hearty appreciation
and applause.
Miss Holman was ably assisted at
the piano by Miss Eleanor Morris.
