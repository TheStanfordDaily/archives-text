It is evident that co-education as
practiced at Stanford is becoming
more a matter of experiment than a
matter of completion and success. The
women resulting from the present
system are not what they are because
of any fault of their own, but rather
are caused by the circumstances sur
rounding: them from the first. The
system itself is at fault. Hut the re
sult is none the less apparent and
difficult because of this.
Stanford women bave become more
a group than individuals. "The 500"
has become the slogan of the mass,
and has been taken up by each woman
as her distinction to fame, her right
to be classed among the highest. Tt
takes an unusual girl to retain her
individuality when she comes to Stan
ford: the great tendency is for her
to be absorbed in"The 500," and to
become, perhaps gradually, but none
the less surely, not a girl standing
out as one possessed of personality—,
but as 0110 of this "500."
Tt's so very easy; much easier
than making something of oneself;
where other college women are
forced to do something or lose out
with the world, the Stanford women
may simply point to the fact that she
went to Stanford, was one of the 500.
Tt is this that is killing the old awe
for Stanford women, and in a manner
the old respect held for them by the
men: it is killine; any spark of in
dividuality they once had, and is
forcing them to be classed as a mass,
a group—where one is very little dif
ferent from the rest.
Truly, it is "being done," to be a
member of this select group, but it
would appear that the cost might
some day be too great.
