## 
### 
Surreptitious murmurs about the
campus have it that members of the
'•500" are becoming perturbed over
the possibilities of a certain social
event which rumor reports is to come
off in the near future. This function
is to be nothing less than an "Import
Dance," whose avowed purpose is
to equalize campus conditions, and
which is reported to have the back
nig of numerous prominent campus
characters of the male sex.
The committee in charge of the
plan believes, and in this, at least, its
creed is in line with that of the above
mentioned 500, that the benefits of
college life should be enjoyed by oth
ers than actual residents of the Uni
versity. Accordingly the idea is to
stage a dance at which the ladies at
tending shall come entirely from off
the campus.
Fear is expressed lest the principle
of an "Import Dance," if once allowed
to start, will become a precedent in
campus affairs.
