# VARSITY WINS 58 TO 28 FROM SAN JOSE Y.M.C.A.
## BABES DOWN INFANTRY FROM FREMONT Fast Brand of Basketball Is Displayed by Stanford Combination 
### 
Stanford's basketball fives walked
away with two games last night on
Encina court, the varsity winning by
a score of 58 to 26 from the San Jose
Y M. C. A. team and the freshmen
taking the Thirteenth Infantry 130-
pound combination down the line in
a 53 to 22 contest. The varsity dis
played a brand of ball that gives
promise of a championship team
against California. The forwards
worked together with clock-like pre
cision, while the guards stopped up
plays with regularity. In addition,
Schwarzenbek at center showed abil
ity which put a smile on the face of
fans.
Hood is a Point Winner.
Hood at forward was the greatest
individual point winner for the vars
ity with eleven baskets in the first
half. Moulton at the other forward
position was not far behind with
seven, while Bucklin in the second
period broke into the scoring column
with five goals. R. Burrell, for the
San Jose five, was the only man who
could locate the basket with any reg
ularity. In addition to snaring six
baskets he played a good defensive
game.
Parks is Find.
Parks at guard showed last night
that he is proving to be a proverbial
"find" in the absence of Captain Sul
livan. He guarded his man in fine
style and worked into the varsity's
passing rushes as though he were a
veteran. Together with Butt, Parks
should be a big surprise to the Blue
and Gold men when the two varsities
tangle.
The freshmen against a weak team
rolled up a big score, but displayed a
poor brand of basketball. Each man
oil the five seems to think it is his
duty to win the game by himself and
as a result there is a noticeable lack
cf teamwork, the strong point of the
varsity. Seaman and Lacey both
made baskets at will last night, but
neither man showed he had any
semblance of team-work in his play.
Swanholm and Harris at guards put
up a better game since they passed
the ball occasionally.

Stanford's basketball fives walked
away with two games last night on
Encina court, the varsity winning by
a score of 58 to 26 from the San Jose
Y M. C. A. team and the freshmen
taking the Thirteenth Infantry 130-
pound combination down the line in
a 53 to 22 contest. The varsity dis
played a brand of ball that gives
promise of a championship team
against California. The forwards
worked together with clock-like pre
cision, while the guards stopped up
plays with regularity. In addition,
Schwarzenbek at center showed abil
ity which put a smile on the face of
fans.
Hood is a Point Winner.
Hood at forward was the greatest
individual point winner for the vars
ity with eleven baskets in the first
half. Moulton at the other forward
position was not far behind with
seven, while Bucklin in the second
period broke into the scoring column
with five goals. R. Burrell, for the
San Jose five, was the only man who
could locate the basket with any reg
ularity. In addition to snaring six
baskets he played a good defensive
game.
Parks is Find.
Parks at guard showed last night
that he is proving to be a proverbial
"find" in the absence of Captain Sul
livan. He guarded his man in fine
style and worked into the varsity's
passing rushes as though he were a
veteran. Together with Butt, Parks
should be a big surprise to the Blue
and Gold men when the two varsities
tangle.
The freshmen against a weak team
rolled up a big score, but displayed a
poor brand of basketball. Each man
oil the five seems to think it is his
duty to win the game by himself and
as a result there is a noticeable lack
cf teamwork, the strong point of the
varsity. Seaman and Lacey both
made baskets at will last night, but
neither man showed he had any
