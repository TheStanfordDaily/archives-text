# "WAR MUST BE WON BY SAVING OF FOOD" SAYS WILBUR
## PRESIDENT ADDRESSES SERVICE CLUB "Germany at the Acme of Her Success; Allies Are Near Famine" 
### 
"Food conservation will win this
war for the United States; the Amer
ican people entered the war the great
est wasters in the world," was the
remarkable declaration with which
Dr. Wilbur opened his address yester
day before the members of the Ser
vice Club and the R. O. T. C. Presi
dent Wilbur showed clearly the exact
situation that now confronts the na
tion and told what the people as a
whole must do if the world is to he
saved for democracy.
"The next six months," he said,
will decide whether we are going to
win the war or not. The fighting
world is npw looking to the United
States for food and the successful
prosecution of the war depends upon
our getting food to Europe. The
submarine menace has heen a success
as far as the food situation is con
cerned. More than live million tons
of shipping lias been sunk by sub
marines. This shipping cannot be re
placed as fast as it is destroyed."
Allies' Food Scarcity Mentioned.
Dr. Wilbur told how near the Allies
really were to having a serious scar
city of food. "Italy's army rations
have actually been reduced below the
point required for efficient fighting
and a strong morale," he said. "It
is hard for us, living in plenty, to vis
ualize the shortage that actually ex
ists across the seas."
Summing up the present situation,
he declared that "Germany is now at
the acme of her success. Russia is
out of the fight and with her went
"Italy has lost more soldiers in the
last few months than we now have in
the field, with our part in the war
almost a year old. France is 110
longer able to supply reserves;
England is at the height of her fight
ing power and the United States is
held off by lack of supplies and
trained men.
"The successful continuance of the
war, until the American army can
reach the field in overwhelming num
bers, depends 011 the keeping up of
the morale of the troops now in the
trenches. We have the problem be
fore us of convincing the soldier in
France that we actually mean busi
ness. It can not be done if he does
not have enough to eat or if he real
izes that his family is starving at
home. The morale of the Italian army
fell because of the lack of food.
Problem Confronting America.
"This problem now confronts us,"
the speaker declared. "If we can first
get supplies across, and then men, the
submarine menace will have failed,
Germany will have been checked, and
possibly defeated. If we do not have
the wheat to send, it will not get
there. We will not have it unless we
grow it and save it. To save it is now
the problem. The American people
waste enough to entirely solve the
problem. We must save not only
wheat, but pork, bacon, fats, and
sugar. The saving must begin at
once.
"We must act now or 'too late' may
be the worst words in the American
language. England was too late to
save Serbia, Italy entered the war too
late. Will the United States be too
late?
"The responsibility rests on the
consumer as well as on the soldier.
You people can help fight the U
boats three times every day by the
way you eat. None of us would think
of robbing a starving child, yet we
are indirectly doing it when we waste
food.
"Wheat that is not drawn out of
the ordinary channels will go across.
Exportation to neutrals and non-com
batants has been checked by the
strictest government regulations.
None of it will go anywhere except
to our soldiers and allies.
"I appeal to you as true Americans
and Stanford men to get behind food
conservation here and elsewhere.
Without it we lose. If we carry it on
as we should and will, we win."

is hard for us, living in plenty, to vis
ualize the shortage that actually ex

Summing up the present situation,
he declared that "Germany is now at
the acme of her success. Russia is
out of the fight and with her went
"Italy has lost more soldiers in the
last few months than we now have in
the field, with our part in the war
almost a year old. France is 110
longer able to supply reserves;
England is at the height of her fight

held off by lack of supplies and
trained men.
"The successful continuance of the
war, until the American army can
reach the field in overwhelming num

the morale of the troops now in the

France that we actually mean busi
ness. It can not be done if he does
not have enough to eat or if he real
izes that his family is starving at
home. The morale of the Italian army
fell because of the lack of food.
Problem Confronting America.
"This problem now confronts us,"
the speaker declared. "If we can first
get supplies across, and then men, the
submarine menace will have failed,
Germany will have been checked, and
possibly defeated. If we do not have
the wheat to send, it will not get
there. We will not have it unless we
grow it and save it. To save it is now
the problem. The American people
waste enough to entirely solve the
problem. We must save not only
wheat, but pork, bacon, fats, and
sugar. The saving must begin at
once.
"We must act now or 'too late' may
be the worst words in the American
language. England was too late to
save Serbia, Italy entered the war too
late. Will the United States be too
late?
"The responsibility rests on the
consumer as well as on the soldier.
You people can help fight the U
boats three times every day by the
way you eat. None of us would think
of robbing a starving child, yet we
are indirectly doing it when we waste
food.
"Wheat that is not drawn out of
the ordinary channels will go across.
Exportation to neutrals and non-com
batants has been checked by the
strictest government regulations.
None of it will go anywhere except
to our soldiers and allies.
"I appeal to you as true Americans
and Stanford men to get behind food
conservation here and elsewhere.
Without it we lose. If we carry it on
as we should and will, we win."
"Food conservation will win this
war for the United States; the Amer
ican people entered the war the great
est wasters in the world," was the
remarkable declaration with which
Dr. Wilbur opened his address yester
day before the members of the Ser
vice Club and the R. O. T. C. Presi
dent Wilbur showed clearly the exact
situation that now confronts the na
tion and told what the people as a
whole must do if the world is to he
saved for democracy.
"The next six months," he said,
will decide whether we are going to
win the war or not. The fighting
world is npw looking to the United
States for food and the successful
prosecution of the war depends upon
our getting food to Europe. The
submarine menace has heen a success
as far as the food situation is con
cerned. More than live million tons
of shipping lias been sunk by sub
marines. This shipping cannot be re
placed as fast as it is destroyed."

Dr. Wilbur told how near the Allies
really were to having a serious scar
city of food. "Italy's army rations
