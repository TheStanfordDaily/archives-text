# NOT DOING THEIR PART
## 
### 
Women are not doing their part in the student body this quarter. Less
than ninety of the "Five Hundred" have purchased associated student
cards. Over half of the men have bought these tickets already and this
of course is no excuse for the rest to delay in performing this duty. But
when less than one-fifth of the women of the University show sufficient
interest and pride in student affairs to buy A. S. S. U. memberships crit
icism is justified.
Stanford women have far exceeded the men in generosity toward cer
tain war endeavors, but here is a place where they have fallen behind.
Every woman attending the University should belong to the student body
arid take a live interest in its activities. In some years their failure to
live up to their duty in this respect would not matter much, but this year
their support means more than ever before in a financial way, as they
form a much larger percentage of the student body than ever before.
An A. S. S. U. card entitles a woman to reduced admission to Stanford
games and meets, to all the privileges of the Women's Athletic Associa
tion, to the right of participation in student activities and to a subscription
to the Daily Palo Alto, which can be transferred to some else.
There should be no further delay in the purchase of A. S. S. U. cards
by the women students, nor by the men who have not yet bought them.
