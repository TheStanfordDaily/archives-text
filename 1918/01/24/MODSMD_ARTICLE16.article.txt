# NEW REST ROOM TO BE FITTED FOR WOMEN
## 
### 
Rooms 200 A and 2008 in the north
east corner of the basement of the
English building are in the process of
being fitted for a new rest-room for
the women. The University has ap
propriated a thousand dollars to be
spent 111 retinting and furnishings,
through the efforts of Miss Bradford.
The question of a new rest-room
had been considered fur some time by
University authorities, but action was
finally taken on account of the work
of the Y. W. C. A. A petition was
drawn up and presented to the dean
of women making this roquest for a
rest-room.
Both rooms have been tinted a soft
cream and attractive chintz will bo
hung at the windows and cover the
cushions. Twenty-four new chairs
and twelve lounges will add to tho
comfort of the rooms.
