Possibilities and opportunities of
the aviation service are discussed in
a series of three articles sent from
the Chief Signal Officer, U. S. A., to
the presidents of various universities,
with a request that they be published
in the college newspapers. The let
ter to President Wilbur particularly
states that it is not the desire of the
army to lead college men to hasty or
ill-advised action, as the government
wishes the colleges to be kept run
ning as nearly as possible as in nor
mal times.
For those college men who are con
templating present enlistment, how
ever, the War Department wants to
present the desirabilities and oppor
tunities of the aviation service.
The first of the articles appears
below:
THE AIR SERVICE.
College men are needed for the Air
Service.
There, of all places, they are best
fitted to serve. There they can use
the education and the physique that
their peculiar advantages have given
them; there they can express their
own individuality and be their own
directing general.
Picture a battle-plane three to four
miles above the trenches, alone in the
richness of the skies, ever watchful
for a lightning stroke from the enemy,
ever eager to swoop down on an ob
server below, itself a tiny mechanism
less than thirty feet from tip to tip,
though powerful with the power of a
200-horse power engine, Uncle Sam's
advance guard "over there"
Work of Observers.
Or the observer or photographer,
, soaring down to within a mile or so of
the enemy's trenches, seizing upon
and recording every movement among
them, guiding the big guns behind,
locating enemy batteries, directing
shells into convoys, guarding friends
beneath from treacherous surprise at
tacks or traps, laying bare the enemy's
ruses
Or the bomber, swooping down to
blow up an enemy convoy, raining
hundreds of pounds of the world's
most deadly explosives from the skies,
converting a withdrawal into a rout,
winging off across the country to cut
the enemy's arteries over the Rhine
or to annihilate his ammunition cen
ter at Essen
Such is the Air Service.
Aviation Specialized.
Warfare in the clouds has become
as specialized in the last four months
as that on land. It is fought in dif
ferent strata by different planes.
There are tiny, tough little machines
for the flashing air duels; there are
the heavier, slower machines for spot
ting and photgraphy; there are the
cumbrous, awkward machines of great
sustaining power for all night bomb
ing trips into the heart of the enemy's
country. And each requires a differ
ent type of man to guide it. Each
places before America a different
problem in personnel.
It is pretty easy to say what kind
of man is not wanted for the Air Ser
vice. First of course you do not want
a man who has a weak heart or lungs
and who might collapse at a high al
titude. Nor a man who is timid or
cowardly, who might lose his head in
an emergency. Nor again a man who
is ill-disciplined, unable to obey or
ders, or to play his assigned role in
the great teamwork of the skies. Each
and every airman, responsible for the
lives of thousands of men on the
ground beneath him, the guide of the
army and the hope of victory, must be
as nearly perfect as is humanly pos
sible.
Highest Type of Men.
This leads us to positive qualities.
Besides health, besides bravery, be
sides conscientiousness, an airman
must have brains and judgment.
Brains because only a trained mind
can master flying, radio, aerial pho
tography, codes, reconnaissance and
the kindred sciences necessary to this
new science. Judgment because all
these powers in the hands of an ill
balanced mind might work a ghastly
havoc among the men who are sent
forward or held back on an airman's
sianal.
