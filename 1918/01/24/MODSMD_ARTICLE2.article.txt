# FRESHMAN SWIMMERS TO FIGURE IN MEET
## Interclass Water Match Is Scheduled for Next Saturday Morning 
### 
Freshmen seem to have the edge
on events in the interclass swimming
meet which is scheduled for next Sat
urday morning at 11 o'clock in the En
cina tank. With entries in every
event, and a number of near-speed
burners represented, the 1921 tank
artists will make it necessary for the
sophomores to do some clever strok
ing to nose out a winning number of
points. The two upper classes will
not be represented by full teams.
Darling and Lesel both of the
class of 19 -1. will very likely be
anions the placers in the sprints,
while (tr<v!io and Schladerman of the
1920 class-will probably place in the
sprints and 220-yard events. Here ml
sen vill take some points for the jun
iors in this event, according to the
press? t outlook. Coonse, however,
is dm for a few points for the sopho
moros. and he will probably place iii
the back : slroke and breast-stroke
number:-. The freshmen appear to
have the nUo in the diving, while the
sophomores, with Wickersham and
Canelo, will probably take the load in
the plunge for distance. The stellar
event of the meet from the stand
point of excitement will undoubted!'-
be the relay race. It is u difficult
matter !o pick the winner in this
event, but only the two lower classes
will be represented, as the juniors
and seniors have not entered relay
teams.
