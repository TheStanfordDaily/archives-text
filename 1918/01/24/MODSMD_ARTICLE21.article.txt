Dear Editor:
The article which appeared in this
column last night seems to be a re
appearance of "Mere Man." Accord
ing to the article, women who come
,to Stanford lose their individuality. I
I This is a rather broad statement to
make, There seem to be some women
lon the campus who have little or no !
j individuality when it comes to debat
ing, athletics and dramatics. But
open your eyes and look around. The
"500" is something more than a body
of five hundred women of the same
ability and temperament. If the
writer of last night's article would
only hesitate for a moment, he would
find that there are still some women
on the campus who haven't lost their
talent in certain lines. It is quite a
distinction to be a member of the
"500," but there is no basis for the
statement that the women of Stan
ford have no individuality.
ONE OF THE 875."
