# UNDERCLASSMEN AND STUNTS AT JOLLY-UP
## 
### 
Besides the usual terpsichorean di
version, the upperclass jolly-up, which
is to be given tomorrow evening, will
have novelties in the form of new
stunts and "cats." A new feature,
contrary to all traditions, is the fact
that underclass men and women are
invited.
Tickets will sell for 50 cents, plus a
5 cent war tax. The Encina Club
room will be the scene of the "hop."
The music will not start until after
the basketball games at the gymna
sium are finished.
"Swede" Larsen and his jazz band
will manufacture the harmony, which
assures the success of the affair. The
club-rooms will be decorated espe
cially for the dance, and the orches
tra will be given a conspicuous posi
tion.
