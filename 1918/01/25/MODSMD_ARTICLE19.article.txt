# A 						REAL JOLLY-UP
## PLAY BALL! 
### 
All four classe will 'jolly up" together tonight for the first time since
they began having such things as "jolly-ups" at Stanford. The upper classes
are staging the affair, but their decision to throw the affair open to the
men as well as women of the underclasses makes this an informal get-to
gether party for all the undergraduates of the University. This year a much
greater percentage of the student body are here for the first time and to
night's party should prove an excellent means of the new students becom
ing acquainted with the others.
If every man and woman turns out, it's going to be a good party, and
a real "jolly-up." Incidentally, it wouldn't hurt anybody to go to the bas
ketball game before the "jolly-up" begins.

Stanford's baseball club gets into action in a regular game for the first
time on Saturday afternoon. Those who have been watching the squad
work out say that in spite of scarcity of veterans we have the material for
a good nine. It's up to the followers of the national pastime here 011 the
campus to get out and look them over with the famous eagle eye of the
dyed-in-the-wool baseball fan. At that, we're a bit eager to hear the um
pire's cry of "Play ball!" and to hear the first crack of bat against ball.
