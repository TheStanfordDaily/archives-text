# EASTERN COACHES OBJECT TO RULE IN BASKET GAME
## 
### 
That the new basketball rule pro
viding for a two-foot extension back
of the basket will work general hard
ship on players is the opinion of play
ers and coaches throughout the coun
try. Captain Sullivan and Coach
Wilson both strongly oppose the rule
on the ground that it allows a tricky
forward too many chances to score
baskets from this territory.
Eastern Coaches Object.
Following is the general attitude of
eastern coaches as expressed by Lon
W. Jourdet, coach at the University
of, Pennsylvania, in the court game.
The rule to which Jourdet objects
is the one which orders an extension
of the playing floor directly behind
the baskets. The extension is to be
made in the form of an arc which will
be two feet at its greatest width. It
was the .opinion of the rules commit
tee that a player oftentimes was de
prived of a basket by overrunning and
being out of bounds, when he was
about to shoot.
Additional Leeway.
This two-foot rule gives an addi
tional leeway under the basket and
gives a speedy forward a better
chance to make the shot good. Un
der the new rule, the side and the
top of the back-board will be in
bounds. When the ball hits the sides
o f . the back-board and drops back into
the playin gterritory, it now is in
bounds, whereas it was out of bounds
in previous seasons. This, it is be
lieved, will speed up the game.
Jourdet, however, claims that the
new rule will not work successfully.
"Personally, I am much opposed to
the new rule," he said, "and I believe
that the majority of coaches agree
with me. It is a freak rule. It has
some advantages, such as speeding
up the game, but there are several
disadvantages to offset this.
Extension Question Settled.
In the rules interpretation meeting
which was held recently in New
York, the question of the extension
when baskets were on a wall was
brought up. Of course, in such a case
the extension cannot be made, but the
backboard will be in bounds. None of
the teams in the Intercollegiate
League play on courts where the bas
ket is on the wall, so that'this condi
tion will not arise in league games.
"In the matter of a "held ball" in
the two-foot zone, the ball is to be
given to a defensive player out of
bounds for the throw-in. It was point
ed out that the attaching team had
had its chance to score and that un
der the conditions it was unfair to
give this team a second advantage of
a jump under the basket."
Jumper Can Catch Ball.
One change that will be welcomed
by those interested in college basket
ball is the one which allows the jump
man to catch the ball from the tip-off.
Previously, the jumper could not touch
the ball after the tap until it had been
touched by another player. This
worked a hardship on a skillful jump
er, who often was compelled to allow
the ball to get away to the opposing
team merely because he was not al
lowed to take it when he was in a po
sition to do so.
Under the new ruling a substitute
player must report first to the scorer
and then to the referee when he en
ters the game. He is not allowed to
report to the umpire. Many times in
the past the scorers have been con
fused by substitutes, whose names
they did not know. Because of this
the reports of the games were incor
rect sometimes.
Among the several limitations
which hedge in the two-foot zone rule
is one which prohibits any of the play
ers from being in the new zone when
lined up along the foul alley for a free
throw. Not even a player's foot can
be over the line which marked the end
of the playing territory last season.

In the rules interpretation meeting
which was held recently in New
York, the question of the extension
when baskets were on a wall was
brought up. Of course, in such a case
the extension cannot be made, but the
backboard will be in bounds. None of
the teams in the Intercollegiate
League play on courts where the bas
ket is on the wall, so that'this condi
tion will not arise in league games.
"In the matter of a "held ball" in
the two-foot zone, the ball is to be
given to a defensive player out of
bounds for the throw-in. It was point
ed out that the attaching team had
had its chance to score and that un
der the conditions it was unfair to
give this team a second advantage of
a jump under the basket."
Jumper Can Catch Ball.
One change that will be welcomed
by those interested in college basket
ball is the one which allows the jump
man to catch the ball from the tip-off.
Previously, the jumper could not touch
the ball after the tap until it had been
touched by another player. This
worked a hardship on a skillful jump
er, who often was compelled to allow
the ball to get away to the opposing
team merely because he was not al
lowed to take it when he was in a po
sition to do so.
Under the new ruling a substitute
player must report first to the scorer
and then to the referee when he en
ters the game. He is not allowed to
report to the umpire. Many times in
the past the scorers have been con
fused by substitutes, whose names
they did not know. Because of this
the reports of the games were incor
rect sometimes.
Among the several limitations
which hedge in the two-foot zone rule
is one which prohibits any of the play
ers from being in the new zone when
lined up along the foul alley for a free
throw. Not even a player's foot can
be over the line which marked the end
of the playing territory last season.
That the new basketball rule pro
viding for a two-foot extension back
of the basket will work general hard
ship on players is the opinion of play
ers and coaches throughout the coun
try. Captain Sullivan and Coach
Wilson both strongly oppose the rule
on the ground that it allows a tricky
forward too many chances to score
baskets from this territory.
Eastern Coaches Object.
Following is the general attitude of
eastern coaches as expressed by Lon
W. Jourdet, coach at the University
of, Pennsylvania, in the court game.
The rule to which Jourdet objects
is the one which orders an extension
of the playing floor directly behind
the baskets. The extension is to be
made in the form of an arc which will
be two feet at its greatest width. It
was the .opinion of the rules commit
tee that a player oftentimes was de
prived of a basket by overrunning and
being out of bounds, when he was
about to shoot.
Additional Leeway.
This two-foot rule gives an addi
tional leeway under the basket and
gives a speedy forward a better
chance to make the shot good. Un
der the new rule, the side and the
top of the back-board will be in
bounds. When the ball hits the sides
o f . the back-board and drops back into
the playin gterritory, it now is in
bounds, whereas it was out of bounds
in previous seasons. This, it is be
lieved, will speed up the game.
Jourdet, however, claims that the
new rule will not work successfully.
"Personally, I am much opposed to
the new rule," he said, "and I believe
that the majority of coaches agree
with me. It is a freak rule. It has
some advantages, such as speeding
up the game, but there are several
disadvantages to offset this.
