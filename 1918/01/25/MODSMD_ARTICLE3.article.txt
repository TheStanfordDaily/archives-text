# FOOD PRODUCTION WILL BE AIDED BY STANFORD'S "500"
## 
### 
Planting is the latest phase of war
I work taken up by the Women's War
I Emergency Committee. At a meet
ing held yesterday in the Women's
| Club House, a general outline of a
| plan for food production on the Stan
| ford campus was divulged. A sub-
I committee on planting had investi-
I gated the possibilities of such and
I made a report to the general com
j rnittee.
The sub-committee suggested that
! a University garden be started. Land
for this purpose will be granted by
University authorities, providing suf
ficient interest in the project is
shown by Stanford women, according
to a statement made by President
Wilbur. Furthermore, attempts are
now being made to secure an in
structor and superintendent.
Presumably, the products raised in
the University garden should be used
partially for local consumption, the
prospective buyers being the living
groups on the campus and Palo Alto
merchants. The remainder of the
products would have to be canned.
It is suggested that a house on the
campus be used for this purpose.
In order to have this plan go
through it will be necessary to have
the support of at least one hundred
wemen. Each woman would give
from one-half day to two days each
week to the work.
If canning is to be accomplished it
will be necessary for women to re
main in the summer or to return to
the campus. Groups of women might
each do two weeks' work in the sum
mer.
The planting committee has investi
gated movements similar to the one
it suggests. Last year the women of
a number of eastern colleges planted,
raised, and canned garden products.
The same colleges are planning a rep
etition of their work on a much larger
scale this spring. Many other col
leges throughout the country are
planning to accomplish much in
actual food production for the first
time.
