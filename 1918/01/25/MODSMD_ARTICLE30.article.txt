# Stolen Bases
## 
### 
Under the direction of Captain
Lilly, the Varsity is getting stronger
every dayâ€”at least on paper. Lilly
is handicapped by the fact that the
squad will not have a coach, and
most of the work falls on his should
ers. However, all the candidates are
getting plenty of opportunity to show
their wares.
* * *
Competition is strong in the in
field, but the outfield is settling down
a little, which is made up of Lilly,
Wayland, and Howes, as the best bets
at present. Both Howes and Way
land are members of last year's
freshman team, and are showing up
well in the Varsity gardens.
* * *
Lifur, box artist for the 1920 team,
is showing lots of stuff this year.
His long right arm is very effective
in practice and he gives promise of
setting the California boys on the
bench in one, two, three order.
* * *
Hurley, another candidate for pitch
ing honors, is showing some good
stuff. He gained his experience in
the wilds of Mendocino county. Hur
ley is a righthander, and would make
a good mate for Lifur.
* * *
The big fight on the nine is in the
infield. Dickey and Abraham are
working out at third, and Daniells
and Doe are cavorting around the
keystone corner, with Galloway,
Davis, and others battling for the
other positions against several can
didates. Captain Lilly has a difficult
problem ahead of him when he at
tempts to select the best man for
these positions.
* * *
Schofield, former Varsity catcher,
is taking charge of the freshmen. He
is giving each candidate plenty of op
portunity to demonstrate his ability.
Several "prep" school stars are out
lor the team, and indications point
to a successful combination.
* * *
"Canary" Campbell, veteran Varsity
backstop, looks better this season
than ever before. "Canary's" arm
is working like a watch and he seems
to have found his batting eye in
practice.
* * *
Coach Schofield of the freshman
squad has good material in Turburn,
Van Clief, Kallum, and Filley. Sec
ond base and the outfield seem to be
the favorite positions for the babes,
since a large number of men arc
signed up in these departments.
* * *
Stanford fans will have their first
I opportunity to judge the squad Sat
urday, when the Varsity goes up
against the 62d Infantry from Camp
Fremont.
