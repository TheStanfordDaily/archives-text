# RIVETING ON LIBRARY TO COMMENCE SOON
## 
### 
Riveting on the new Library will
begin in about four days. Most of the
steel is in place now, and the derrick
was moved to its last position yester
day, to finish the rear of the building.
As .soon as the building has been
braced and trued up the hammers will
begin pounding on the front of the
structure. Several crews of riveters
will be on the job at a time, so the
Quad may be assured that there will
"not be a dull moment" for some time
to come.
Only the front and the north sides of
the building will be faced with the reg
ulation stone, such as is used for most
of the buildings. As much of the stone
from the ruins of the old library as
possible will be used. The other two
sides will be made of brick.
The new women's dormitory will be
completed within two months, it is
expected. The plastering and most
of the interior woodwork is finished,
and the plumbers are busy installing
the plumbing.
