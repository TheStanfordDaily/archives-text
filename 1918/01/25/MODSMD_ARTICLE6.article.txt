# SWIMMERS TO SPLASH IN INTERCLASS CONTEST
## FRESHMEN HAVE EDGE SAYS DOPESTER Meet Scheduled Tomorrow at 11 o'clock in Encina Tank 
### 
Stanford mermen are scheduled to
splash in Encina tank tomorrow
morning, when the interclass swim
ming contest takes place. The first
gun will be fired promptly at 11
o'clock, and Ernest Brandsten, Stan
ford swimming instructor, will offi
ciate. Full teams will not be entered
by the juniors and seniors ,and the
contest will probably develop into a
fight between the two lower classes,
with the freshmen having the edge,
according to the dopsters.
Tomorrow's meet will be the first
appearance of the local tank artists
this quarter in a regular contest.
Several speed-burners, however, are
among those entered, and the meet
should have plenty of thrills for the
onlooker as well as the contestants.
Darling and Green of the 1912 aggre
gation should prove point winners in
the sprints and distances, respective
ly, while Coonse can be counted on
to take a few counts for the good of
the sophomores in the back and
breast-stroke events. The big inter
collegiate contest with California is
scheduled for the middle of March,
and the local freshmen will meet the
babes from across the bay on the
same day.
