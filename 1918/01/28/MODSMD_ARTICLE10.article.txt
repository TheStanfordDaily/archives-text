# "THIRD UNIT SCATTERED"---WARREN
## 
### 
Many changes have been experi
enced by the Third Stanford Ambu
lance Unit, and its ranks are sadly
depleted since its arrival In France,
according to a letter received here
recently from Lansing Warren, '17,
last year's editor of the Chaparral,
lie writes from a point "somewhere
behind the lines" in France, and gives
the news from the many Stanford
men who are now in that part of
Europe, lie says, in part: ,
"Old Section 70 (composed of the
Third Stanford I'nit) has sadly de
teriorated. She'll never he herself

again. Pared and mutilated, both
personally and arithmetically, she's
doing her best to struggle along
under the title of Section 18.
Shorn of her best characters,
however, she is greatly handi
capped. All the boys that left the
service, except Sloman and Strobel,
are holding down soft Paris .jobs
cither in aviation or Y. M. C. A.
"Walt (Jqres has gone to training
school, and is expected back about
the first of February for a short visit
before becoming a full-fledged "lieut"
with a section of patriotic Allentown
adherents all his own.
"We've been joined by 'Wully' Wohl
l'ord and Walt Bruns of the Salonique
unit, most of the other men in that
section either having entered avia
tion or gone back to Albania witli the
Red Cross. Among the l*tter are
'Aii]),' Ed Kneass, and Harry Frantz.
"We're expecting daily to have our
quiet round disturbed by orders to
move front-wards, but we've been
vainly expecting this so long that
we've really begun to feel quite com
fortable here.
"The unit now contains besides my
self, Walt Gores, Ed Phelps, George
Hall, Hob Donaldson, Ritter Holman,
'Judy' Burton, Malcolm Tedfard,
'Wully' Wohlford, and Walt Bruns."
