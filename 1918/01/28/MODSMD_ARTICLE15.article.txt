# SERVICE FLAGS

### 
It has taken several months for the students of Stanford to get the
service flag idea into their heads but it now appears to be gaining ground
rapidly. It is an idea that should be encouraged. We who remain here
at Stanford are doing little enough to remember those who have gone into
active war service, and the most appropriate way right now to do
this is to put out service flags. Every living group on the campus, every
fraternity and club, both men's and women's, should display a service
flag if any of their members, past or present, are now in the United States
service. The announcement that Encina Club was to display a service (lag
shows that the Hall is alive to its responsibilities in this respect. Some
of the houses have put out Hags and the rest should follow their example
immediately.
May we respectfully suggest that the University authorities purchase .a
large service Hag representing in stars the sacrifices of men from faculty,
administration, alumni, and undergraduate ranks to war service and that
this flag be displayed from one of the two flagpoles in fhont of the Quad
rangle?
