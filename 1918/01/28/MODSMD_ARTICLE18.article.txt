# DR. BOYD DELIVERS THE SUNDAY MORNING SERM
## 
### 
"Courage is not needed alone in the
camp; it is needed in every path of
life," declared the Rev. John S. Boyd
in his sermon at Memorial Church yes
terday morning. "It requires courage,"
he said, "for a man to rise out of the
realm of mediocrity and accomplish
the big things of life. A man has to
have a concentrated purpose and un
daunted will in order to reach the
height of his development. The great
mass of people in the world have not
properly invested their resources, and
made the most of their ability."
Dr. Boyd is pastor of the First Pres
byterian Church of Portland, Ore. For
the past three weeks hÂ« has been
visiting the army and navy camps on
the Pacific coast. He gave much
praise to the fine courage and manli
ness of the men he met.
