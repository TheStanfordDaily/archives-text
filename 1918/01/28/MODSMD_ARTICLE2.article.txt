# Freshmen Annex Swimming Honors
## Darling Stars in Interclass Water Contest in Local Tank 
### 
Freshman water babes annexed the
honors in the interclass swimming
contest, held Saturday morning in En
cina tank, by a total of 30 points to
the sophomores' 18, the seniors' 10,
and the juniors' 6. The two upper
classes were unable to enter full
teams, and were not represented in
tlie relay race, which was the most
thrilling event of the meet.
Darling, swimming for the '21 aggre
gation, was easily the individual star
of the contest. First places in the 50-
vard dash, the 100 and 200 yard
events were put down to his credit,
and lie also swam two laps in the re
lay. A pretty exhibition of diving
was given by Ilakestraw, who took
first place in that event for the sen
iors.
Entries for Saturday's meet were
nol over-abundant, and in several of
tlin races only three contestants were
entered. The freshmen put up a very
good showing, and they bid fair to
turn out a strong aggregation for the
contest with the Berkeley babes in
March. More material will be needed,
on tho other hand, to strengthen up
the varsity.
