## 
### 
That the athletic policy now being
pursued in the United States Army is
! substantially the same as the one that
has been adopted and followed con
j sistently at Stanford University for j
1 the past ten years is the theme of an
I l
article appearing in the Sunset Mag
azine for February by Robin Bailey, j
a noted San Francisco writer.
Mr. Baifiey has followed develop- !
' ments in athletics here with a zest;
that has characterized him as an an- I
I thority on Stanford athletics. He has
I written frequent articles for the San
i Francisco Chronicle concerning Stan
; ford sports, and is the strongest ex-
I ponent of Rugby football on the
, coast. Mr. Bailey's article is illus
; trated with pictures of Stanford men
who have become identified with
major sports here, and he quotes Dr. ,
Frank Angell, Dr. Murray, President
Wilbur, and other men well known on
the "Farm."
