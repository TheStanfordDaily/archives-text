# Stolen Bases
## 
### 
"Doc" Lifur pitched in mid-season
form Saturday. He only allowed two
hits, and struck out about twenty bat
ters. His four base swats also counted
in the run column.
* * *
"Cash" Davis and "Doc" Wayland
secured two hits each. Davis marred
his performance, however, by making
two errors.
* * *
"Mush" Stevens, who was elected
captain of the baseball team last year,
was down to see the team work out.
Stevens enlisted in the army last year.
* * *
Art McCrystal, a Sigma Chi at
Stanford, worked out in left field for
the officers' team. Art Hays, Phi
Delta Theta, played center, and se
cured the only two hits that Lifur al
lowed.
♦ ♦ »
The officers' team was composed of
nearly all college men. Moorman is
a West Point man, Candee hails from
the University of California, and Don
Johnson, former hurler for the Phila
delphia Athletics, is a university man.
Smith, third baseman, formerly played
for the University of Oregon, and
Moore and Barham are Washingtoni
ans.
* * *
The freshmen mixed with a team
from the 31st Field Hospital Corps.
The hospital men went right through
the babes for 17 runs. It is probable
that they will play the varsity some
time this week.
Parthuin showed up well at second
base, particularly in fielding, but his
hitting was not quite up to standard.
Doe played the keystone position in
the last innings of the game.

"Dink" Templeton presided as um
pire, and got away safely.

Captain Lilly secured his bingle by
hitting to center.
