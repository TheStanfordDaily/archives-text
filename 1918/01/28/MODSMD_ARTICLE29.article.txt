# HOUSES MAKE NEW WAR WORK RULING
## 
### 
Action has been taken by some of
the women's living groups on the cam-
I pus requiring at least one hour's work
I a week at the local auxiliary of the
Red Cross. Because of the small at
tendance in carrying on the work, the
time has been restricted to three af
ternoons a week —Monday! Tuesday,
and Thursday, from 2 to 5 o'clock —
instead of every afternoon as for
merly.
In most of the houses the women
will be asked to report once a week.
The whole plan has been put on an
honor basis, however, and each wo
man has been impressed with her in
dividual responsibility.
Women who have been interested
in Red Cross work assert that they
are sure of success in this work under
the new plan, as already the number
working at the clubhouse has con
siderably increased.
Under the auspices of the Y. M. C.
A. an entertainment was held last Fri
day night at the Stanford Union for
the benefit of foreign students of the
University. The purpose of the meet
ing was to bring about a better un
derstanding between these students
from over the sea and Stanford men.
Professor M. 11. Kirkwood presided
and his welcome was responded to by
J. B. Ramirez, '19, a Filipino boy, and
S. K. Wong, '20. An appropriate and
interesting talk was given by Dr. Jor
dan, on his experiences in the Ori
ent. Professor A. M. Cathcart spoke
lon "International Cosmopolitanism,"
.laying principal stress on the idea of
introducing an international brother
hood.
A short talk was given and a clever
stunt executed by E. R. Knollin of
Encina gym, followed by jiu-jitsu and
fencing matches between two Japa
nese boys. The customary "eats"
were then served.
Tt is of interest to know that Jap
anese, Chinese, Armenians, Filipinos,
and Hindus were present at the meet
ing.
