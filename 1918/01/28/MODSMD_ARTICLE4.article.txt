In praising the authors and the
work the New York Times says:"It
is evident that they have made a close
and thorough study of their subject,
and also that they have brought to
their scrutiny and presentment the
mental backgrounds and training cal
culated to fit them for the task. . . .
therefore it will be seen that the
treatment of the subject is both com
prehensive and detailed.
"It is also clearly reasoned and judi
cially presented. For the book is in
no sense the work of uncritical, enthu
siastic admiration. The authors, who
are both members of the faculty of
Stanford University . . . are too ac
customed to dealing with political
documents and historical questions as
material for laboratory investigation
to allow their personal reactions —
whatever they may be —to current
events to influence their intellectual
appraisement of the matters in ques
tion."
