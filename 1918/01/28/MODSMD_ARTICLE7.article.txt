# VARSITY QUINTET WINS FROM CAMP FREMONT IN FAST GAME
## FINAL SCORE IS 42 TO 14 Captain Sullivan Used Second Team During First Half of the Game 
### 
Stanford's Varsity five continued its
winning streak by defeating Company
K of the 62d Infantry, Friday night,
on Encina court by the count of 42
to 14. A combination of accurate
basket shooting and close guarding
proved too much for the Camp Fre
mont team. Moulton, Hood, and Butt
were the shining lights for the Var
sity while Regan put up the best
game for Company Iv.
The game furnishes an opportunity
to get a lineup on the relative strength
of the California and Stanford Var
sities since the Blue and Gold de
feated the same team by one point
