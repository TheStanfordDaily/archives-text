# VARSITY QUINTET WINS FROM CAMP FREMONT IN FAST GAME
## FINAL SCORE IS 42 TO 14 Captain Sullivan Used Second Team During First Half of the Game 
### 
Stanford's Varsity five continued its
winning streak by defeating Company
K of the 62d Infantry, Friday night,
on Encina court by the count of 42
to 14. A combination of accurate
basket shooting and close guarding
proved too much for the Camp Fre
mont team. Moulton, Hood, and Butt
were the shining lights for the Var
sity while Regan put up the best
game for Company Iv.
The game furnishes an opportunity
to get a lineup on the relative strength
of the California and Stanford Var
sities since the Blue and Gold de
feated the same team by one point
while the Cardinal lead was twenty
eight points. Judging by these facts
the Cardinal has a' much stronger
combination than the five across the
bay.
First Half Close.
The first half proved to be a stiff
battle, with the Varsity leading at
the whistle by the score of 14 to 6.
Several subsitutes were used by the
Stanford team and the Fremont five
held them down in good shape. At
the opening of the second period,
Hood, Moulton, Schwarzenbek, and
Butt went in and the score began to
climb immediately. Moulton and
Hood were in good form, each snaring
six baskets. The two forwards seem
to be better each game and by the
end of two more weeks should be a
match for any combination California
can turn out. Butt and Parks are
working well together also.
