# 1919 Dues Must Be Paid Before Quad Is Issued
## 
### 
A. Johannsen and F. A. Betts, presi
dents of the Junior Class last quarter
and this quarter, respectively, liave
explained repeatedly at two meetings
of the Junior Class the necessity of
juniors paying the $6 assessment for
Quad pictures by February 15, but in
spite of this, few payments have been
made to date. Without prompt pay
ment of these dues no 1919 Quad will
be possible. The Junior Class has
twice voted to carry the Quad through,
but this decision has had little effect
on practical attention to the question
of paying up. It is not only the duty
of juniors to "come through," but a
necessity if this year's Quad is to be
printed.
Money payments may be mailed to
Box 32, Stanford University.
The same date, February 15, holds
good for fraternity, club, and society
pictures. Only one-half of these or
ganizations have paid for space.
Presidents and treasurers of other or-
ganizations are asked to get in touch
with the Quad manager, or to see S.
E. Briggs, '18, at the earliest oppor
tunity. If a Quad is to be published
this year dues must be paid, pictures
taken and paid for by February I.">.
