# Service Flags Thick on Campus
## 
### 
Service flags have- grown to be
almost as much a part of the war as
camouflage and wrist watches, and in
this as in other things, Stanford is
taking an active interest. Nearly every
men's living group on the campus
either has hung out a service flag or
is about to do so, and even some of
the sororities are in this way an
nouncing their number of members in
the service.
Phi Delta Theta was the first house
to hang out a service flag, which
now contains 25 stars, computed on
the basis of the number of men who
were at the house this year or last
year who are now in the government
war service. Phi Kappa Sigma, using
the same method of computation, has
a Hag containing 17 stars. All the
other fraternities are including their
alumni, as well as their active mem
bers since the war started in making
lip their service flags. On this basis,
Delta Chi is now flying a flag dis
playing 27 stars, Delta Upsilon 35,
Theta Xi 17, soon to be increased to
23, Delta Kappa Epsilon 38, and
Alpha Delta Phi 28.
Other fraternities have not as yet
hung out their service flags, but
either have ordered one, or intend to

in the near future. The Delta Tail
Delta flag ir. to have at least 34 stars,
the Chi Psi about 45, Beta Theta Pi
40, Zeta Psi 43, Phi Gamma Delta 40,
and Sigma Alpha Epsilon about 45.
Phi Kappa Psi will fly a flag of 47
stars, Kappa Alpha 47, Kappa Sigma
over 40, Sigma Chi about 46, El
Camino Club 23, representing imme
diate alumni. Alpha Sigma Phi 10,
and Alpha Tau Omega about 24. The
Alpha Tau Omega flag is being made
by the mother of one of the mem
bers.
The Delta Gamma flag now holds
two stars. Kappa Alpha Theta re
cently hung out a flag with seven
stars, representing members actually
in France in the service of their
country at the present time. Al
though most of the women's groups
have discussed service Hags, Kappa
Kappa Gamma is the only other which
has taken definite action. This soror
ity will soon display a flag denoting
that at least six of its Stanford mem
bers are now engaged in war work.
The figures given above are in most
cases only approximate, as few fra
ternities have systematic methods of
keeping track of their alumni mem
bers, and accurate compilations have
in many cases not yet been made.
