VOLUNTEER!
DO NOT WAIT FOR THE DRAFT
Here Is the Situation
1325 Students have registered for the winter
quarter; 825 men and 500 women. Only 371 men
and 87 women have bought student body tickets.
Student activities cannot be maintained with
such flagrant non-support. The athletic budgets
have been trimmed to the limit and already teams
are suffering from inadequate equipment. Shall
we be forced to abandon athletics because of lack
of support ?
The Daily Palo Alto faces a deficit unless the
students line up. Its advertising alone will not pay
running expenses. Shall the Daily cease publica
tion ?
To the Women
A year ago you justly resented an attempt to
question your rights to membership in this institu
tion. Both previously and since that time Stan
ford women have demonstrated the foolishness of
such an attempt. When the Y. M.-Y. \V. C. A.
drive started you said you were going "over the
top," and you certainly went.
But here is another chance to prove up, a duty
easier to perform, but nevertheless a duty, and you
have overlooked it.
As the men answer the greater call, an increased
obligation for the maintaining of student activities
falls upon you. Women of Stanford, look to the
figures and note your response.
To the Men
The preceding paragraph applies equally well to
you. Neither is your response flattering. Are you
going to shipwreck the trust which is left in your
keeping?
Many are disturbed by plans for greater service.
With such thoughts occupying your minds, who
shall dare ask of this simple duty, as some have
already done, "What shall 1 get in return?"
Even though you leave tomorrow, help while
you're here, and so lighten the load which increases
with your going.
To All
867 tickets are yet to be sold. STUDENTS!
VOLUNTEER! DO NOT WAIT FOR THE
DRAFT! Wednesday and Thursday the Grad
uate Manager's office will be open from 9 a. m.
until 4 p. m. Tickets may be purchased at the
window.
Friday night committees will be appointed to
round up the slackers and results will be tabulated.
Again we say. Volunteer.- Do not wait for the
draft.

Here Is the Situation
1325 Students have registered for the winter
quarter; 825 men and 500 women. Only 371 men
and 87 women have bought student body tickets.
Student activities cannot be maintained with
such flagrant non-support. The athletic budgets
have been trimmed to the limit and already teams
are suffering from inadequate equipment. Shall
we be forced to abandon athletics because of lack
of support ?
The Daily Palo Alto faces a deficit unless the
students line up. Its advertising alone will not pay
running expenses. Shall the Daily cease publica
tion ?
To the Women
A year ago you justly resented an attempt to
question your rights to membership in this institu
tion. Both previously and since that time Stan
ford women have demonstrated the foolishness of
such an attempt. When the Y. M.-Y. \V. C. A.
drive started you said you were going "over the
top," and you certainly went.
But here is another chance to prove up, a duty
easier to perform, but nevertheless a duty, and you
have overlooked it.
As the men answer the greater call, an increased
obligation for the maintaining of student activities
falls upon you. Women of Stanford, look to the
figures and note your response.
To the Men
The preceding paragraph applies equally well to
you. Neither is your response flattering. Are you
going to shipwreck the trust which is left in your
keeping?
