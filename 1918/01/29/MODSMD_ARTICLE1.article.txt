# "BETTY'S BOOTS" IS THE NAME OF LATEST JUNIOR OPERA
## WRITTEN BY RAM'S HEAD L.H. Davis to Stage 1919 Musical Showâ€”Tryouts Come Tomorrow 
### 
"Betty's Boots" is the name which
lias been selected for the 1919 Junior
Opera, according to an announcement
made by the committee in charge
today. The opera is being written
by the members of Ram's Head, and
will be staged by them under the
direction of L. H. Davis, '18, who will
also be responsible for the music.
Tryouts for "Betty's Boots" will be
held Wednesday afternoon at the
Kappa Kappa Gamma house, from 1:30
to 5 o'clock. For the benefit of those
who cannot attend in the afternoon
there will be additional tryouts Wed
nesday evening from 7 to 8. Coach
Davis urges that as many as possible
attend the afternoon tryouts.
Competition for "Betty's Boots" is
expected to be very keen, as it abounds
in excellent straight and comedy
parts, and calls for all types of tal
ent. Competition for the Liberty
Belle chorus will be exceptionally
keen, as the "Liberty Belles" are to
be selected from the pick of the "iiOO.''
Everyone is eligible for the tryouts
except freshman women.
The members of Ram's Head are
now putting the finishing touches on
the libretto, which abounds in com
edy situations and clever lines. Davis
has some tuneful, catchy melodies up
his sleeve.
Ram's Head is noted for the suc
cess of the musical comedies which it
has staged on the campus in past
years. Among these "Routing Raz
mataz" and "Rambling Rameses" were
notable successes. These facts as
sure a Junior Opera of the highest
excellcnce. The opera is the biggest
theatrical event of the college year,
and will probably be one of the few
events of the quarter. The standards
of former operas will be maintained,
says the committee, in spite of the
war.
Coach Davis announces that no
preparation need be made by those
who wish to try out tomorrow. A
song or a dance is all that will-be re
quired, and that will be supplied to
the tryoutees by the coach.
The opera is planned to be the
opening event of 1919 Junior Week.
It will be presented in the Assembly
Hall on Thursday evening, March 7.
Second tryouts for those who are
successful in tomorrow's tryouts will
be held either the latter part of this
week or the first of next week. The
exact date will be announced later.
Shortly after the second tryouts the
cast will be named, and rehearsals
will begin at once, thus assuring a
sufficient time for the perfection of the
production.
