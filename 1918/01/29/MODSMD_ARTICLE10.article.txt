# CAMP FREMONT FIVE TO MEET THE VARSITY TOMORROW
## U.C. MAN IN LINE-UP Stanford Will Tangle With Santa Clara Quintet on Friday Night 
### 
Base Hospital 47 of Camp Fremont
will furnish the last competition for
the Varsity five tomorrow night be
fore the season's second biggest con
test, the game with Santa Clara. To
morrow's play will commence at 7:30
in Encina gymnasium and an admis
sion fee of 10 cents for student body
members will be charged. Twenty
five cents will be required for non
members.
The Camp Fremont team, which is
under the supervision of Lieutenant
Floodberg, captain-elect in basketball
at the University of California this
year, is reputed to be one of the fast
est of the combinations which have
been stationed at the camp lately.
There has been much rivalry at the
military cantonment as to which team
would be the first to take the Cardinal
Varsity down the line and the team
tomorrow will put up an extra hard
battle for this reason.
In all probability Captain Sullivan
will use his regular varsity combina
tion, Moulton, Hood, Schwarzenbek,
Parks, and Butt, although substitutes
may start the game. Since there are
only three days following this contest
until the Santa Clara fray, the men
will be on their toes to show their
best wares.
Santa Clara has a veteran five to
oppose the Cardinal, including Vicini,
Don, and Berndt, of the last year's
five, and several high school stars.
With their superiority in weight-the
Mission players expect to swamp the
Cardinal.
In all probability the Santa Clara
game will be the hardest fought of
the season since California's varsity
is not up to the standard of the Red
and White.
