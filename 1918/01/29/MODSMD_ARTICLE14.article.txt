# CALIFORNIA, IT'S UP TO YOU

California and Stanford at last have an absolutely final official basis
to got together upon. President Wilbur in outlining his terms, which are
those of the Board of Athletic Control, has made it absolutely clear that
there can bo no "jobbing" on either side. The agreement made must be
honorable on both sides and must be lived up to fairly and squarely. If the
two universities, natural and hereditary athletic rivals, are ever going to
get together, this is the last chance.
Only the seniors of the two institutions remember the old days of the
Stanford-California Big Game, and next year there will not be the con
necting link between the student bodies of the two universities that now
exists in the mutual memory of the days of real intercollegiate rivalry.
President Wilbur has also made it clear that there can be no continual
bickering about agreements and disagreements and that definite decision
must be made now once and for all by both universities.
As long as either student body tal<es the attitude that they expect the
other to get down and crawl there can be no agreement, there can be no
sound basis for a resumption of football relations unless both sides real
ized that they must each give in on certain points and make certain sacri
fices.
It was not so very long ago that it seemed hopeless to even think of
Stanford playing American at all. Stanford is giving in on this point and
California would be doing her share of the sacrifice by playing Rugby.
Stanford will play California American and California will play Stanford
Rugby—an absolutely fifty-fifty proposition. Without this mutual sacrifice
competition in either game would be utterly and finally impossible.
Two arguments are brought forth here that can be easily disposed of.
Some parties across the bay say "If Stanford wants to play American,
let her apply to the Pacific Coast conference for dates and the same with
Rugby." But Stanford is already a member of the conference and the mat
ter of American football games with the other members of conference i»
entirely a secondary matter with us; what we want and what the truly
fair-minded Californians want is the Stanford vs. California game. Not only
Stanford men, but also a number of California students would be glad to
see Rugby on the conference sport schedule, but results along this line
seem impossible at present. >
The other plea is that California has not sufficient athletic fields and
equipment now to support the two sports. This is far from a serious con
sideration, as we believe there are thousands of loyal California alumni
who want to see the Big Game back again and who would see that funds
were raised to put this proposition through if their support were necessary,
but no such steps should need to be taken, as this should not prove a very
hard problem, inasmuch as there lias not been any great difficulty in turning
out a soccer team at the institution across the bay. Details as to time for
the diffierent sports in the athletic calendar can be worked out satisfacto
rily, and the only thing that can stop up progress will be a possible fail
ure on the part of misguided individuals in the Blue and Gold camp to
grasp the idea of the need for active co-operation now if an agreement
is ever to be arrived at. Any attempt on either side to block negotiations
by quibbling over unessentials will be nothing short of criminal in that it
will prove everlastingly fatal to the resumption of athletic relations be
tween the two universities.
On point number two of the proposition as outlined by Dr. Wilbur
there should be little disagreement, as California is already working to
ward the idea of the instructional type of coach. Certainly during the pres
ent war times highly paid coaches are an unjustifiable institution and their
elimination will go a great way toward clearing up intercollegiate athlet
ics. Stanford is not so unreasonable as to expect California to violate
its existing contract with Andy Smith as football coach, and we will have
to buck up against a team with the odds of an expert professional coach to
help them as well as three years experience behind them in their favor
when we play California American next year, but it must be remembered
that we will have much the same advantage over them in Rugby.
Point three would have been an insurmountable stumbling block had
Dr. Wilbur not explained in this connection that Stanford's idea here is
not to break away from the ruling of the Pacific Coast conference, of
which both Stanford and California are members, forbidding freshman
competition on varsity teams. Stafford's aim is to avoid the endless
squabbling and debate which have disgraced the conferences of the two
universities too often heretofore. A gentlemen's agreement on the pres
ent basis of a freshman rule is the only solution of this difficulty and with
out it any lasting agreement would be impossible.
Prospects for Stanford and California football competition are brighter
than they have been at any time for almost four years. May California
meet the question fairl yand squarely and thus make it possible for the
two universities to co-operate in bringing back football competition.
California, it's up* to you.
