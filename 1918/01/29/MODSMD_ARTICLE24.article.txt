second war order that the shops ac
cepted is for 1,500 parts of airplane
hangar door'hinges. These are being
turned out at the rate of 300 a day.
* * *
The University of Oregon is antici
pating the problem of re-education of
men crippled in the war and is pre

ation. A committee of representatives

* * *

# * *
That women of the University
of California and of the Red Cross
are being fooled or swindled is the
opinion of Professor Edmond O'Neill
of the Chemistry department of that
university. Professor O'Neill doubts
that the dye from a thousand postage
stamps will feed a Belgian baby for
a month and offers a chemical analy
sis to show that it is impossible to

recover the dye and says that even if
it could be recovered it would not
even buy one glass of milk. The rea
son that the Red Cross is being of
fered $4 a thousand for the stamps,
he explains, is that some collector ex
pects to find among a thousand stamps
more than $4 worth of undefaced
stamps.
* * *
That generalization of athletics
will help make good soldiers was the
opinion expressed by the delegates to
the twelfth annual convention of the
National Collegiate Athletic Associa
tion meeting held in New York last
month.
The association recommended that
in all colleges and secondary schools,
athletics be made subservient to the
work of military preparation and an
essential factor in military training.
In accordance with this suggestion
Columbia University will include box
ing and wrestling in her athletic pro
gram and encourage wider participa
tion in intramural athletics.
* * *
College credit will not be given for
class work in military training at
Columbia University this semester

stitution to furnish the necessary in
structors for certain branches of mili
tary class work.

That women of the University
of California and of the Red Cross
are being fooled or swindled is the
opinion of Professor Edmond O'Neill
of the Chemistry department of that
university. Professor O'Neill doubts
that the dye from a thousand postage
stamps will feed a Belgian baby for
a month and offers a chemical analy
sis to show that it is impossible to

recover the dye and says that even if
it could be recovered it would not
even buy one glass of milk. The rea
son that the Red Cross is being of
fered $4 a thousand for the stamps,
he explains, is that some collector ex
pects to find among a thousand stamps
more than $4 worth of undefaced
stamps.

That generalization of athletics
will help make good soldiers was the
opinion expressed by the delegates to

athletics be made subservient to the
work of military preparation and an
essential factor in military training.
In accordance with this suggestion
Columbia University will include box
ing and wrestling in her athletic pro
gram and encourage wider participa
tion in intramural athletics.
