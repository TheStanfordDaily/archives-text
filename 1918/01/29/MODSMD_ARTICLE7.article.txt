# STANFORD SUBMITS PLAN FOR TWO FOOTBALL GAMES TO CALIFORNIA
## THREE PARTS TO CONSIDER Cardinal Will Not Use Freshmen in Play 
### 
That Stanford and the University of California may resume football re
lations is indicated by a proposition which has been made to the California
athletic authorities by the Board of Athletic Control and which has been
partially settled by informal discussion between the two universities.
The proposition as made to California includes the following points:
1. Stanford and California will play both American and Hughy
football.
2. Moth ('Diversities in both games will abolish the highly paid
coaching system in vogue at most universities and will substitute
coaches who are in the nature of athletic instructors.
11. A "gentleman's agreement" will be in force to cover eligibil
ity of players, etc. This point means that each university will de
termine what students shall play, as to class scholastic standing,
etc.

This proposition is the official
stand of the University expressed by
the Board of Athletic Control to the
University of California. Back of the
proposition is the policy for which
the University has stood all through
the controversy with Berkeley—that
Stanford cannot engage in athletics
which are not on a basis by which
every student may take part.
The first point of the proposal ex
plains itself. There will be a game
of Rugby and a game of American
both to be on the same basis as far
as coaches are concerned: viz., that
there will be no highly paid experts
to handle the teams. This point has
been tentatively accepted by the stu
dents of the university across the bay
in informal discussions. These men
realize that Stanford is making a fair
proposition, and that there is a possi
bility of getting together on this basis
and perhaps on no other, so are giv
ing the proposition fair consideration.
The second point is largely accepted
by both students and authorities of
both institutions. Stanford has long
stood for such a basis in athletic rela
tions and California has reached a
stage where she is more than willing
to accept sport with this arrange
ment. The one difficulty that would
arise in this regard is as to the con
tracts which are in force at both uni
versities witli coaches. For this rea
son, the proposition as submitted ar
ranges for the gradual abolishment of
the professional coaching system, so
that the desired state in which
coaches act as athletic instructors of
the University may be reached in a
short while.

The third point was the one on
which the two universities split in
the first place and the one to which
California so strenuously objected
when the proposition was first made
to them. If accepted it would mean
that Stanford could use freshmen in
her games but Berkeley is firmly op
posed to this and would never resume
relations upon such a basis, according
to expressions at the University of
California.
That this will not be the stumbling
block in the relations is indicated by
the fact that Stanford in determining
the eligibility of her players will
abide by existing athletic relations—
the rules of the Pacific Coast Confer
ence, ami these rules especially pro
hibit freshmen from engaging in ath
letic competition on varsity teams.
This would mean that the third
point will be accepted by California,
for the objection is removed. The
rest of the proposition, that there be
a "gentleman's agreement," should
should cause no trouble at all since
all Stanford insists on is fair treat
ment.
According to President Wilbur,
Stanford has made her proposition
after consideration, and will make no
other. He expressed the hope also
that after relations are resumed, if
they are, settlements of disputes
should be on the basis of the "gen
tleman's agreement," so that there
would be no continual squabbling.
California has tentatively accepted
the first two points of the proposition
and with the freshman rule trouble
out of the way will accept the third,
according to student sentiment at that
institution.
