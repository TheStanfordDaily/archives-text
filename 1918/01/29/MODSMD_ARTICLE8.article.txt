# FOUNDERS' DAY PROGRAM TO BE HELD IN CHAPEL
## 
### 
That Founders' Day will be cele
brated 011 Sunday evening, March 10,
was recently decided upon by the
Committee 011 Public Exercises. The
principal celebration will take place
in the church, and Sunday was chosen
as the most appropriate day for the
services, whi< h will not be a formal
sermon, but will include an address
by President Wilbur, and an oration
by Bishop Hughes of Boston.
Two anthems will be given by the
choir, and the program will include
r.eVeral vocal solos. The military
band will support in the singing of
patriotic hymns, and will lead the pa
rade of the . O. T. C. into the

church. Members of the faculty are
asked to sit in the chancel, and the
board of trustees will enter with the
procession.
The occasion will be made not so â€¢
much a religious ceremony as a dig
nified and worthy celebration of
Founder's Day by Stanford as a
whole.
Previously, Founder's Day has been
observed but little by the majority of
the students, but this year the chap
lain hopes, since Sunday has been set
aside, that a more general observance
will be undertaken, and will do all in
his power to make this year's celebra
tion worthy of (he occasion.
