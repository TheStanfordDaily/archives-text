### 
Gothic architecture was explained
last night to an appreciative audi
ence in the Little Theater by Dr. Mel
bourne Greene, lecturer of the Uni
versity of California Extension Divis
ion. Taking as his subjcct, "The
Glory That Was Rheims," Dr. (Ireene
used the famous cathedral of that
French city, now nearly destroyed, as
an example of the best in Gothic art.
Slides showing examples of the ori
gin, development, and salient features
of the Gothic idea were used by the
I speaker.
"Gothic architecture," said Dr.
j Greene, "grows and develops from
year to year. Throughout the Middle
! Ages, from the time it emerged from
| the Romanesque till it became too
(elaborate and was superseded by the
Renaissance, it shows constant
■ changes in form, design, and manner
Of construction. The distinguishing
features of the Gothic are the pointed
arch, A\hen used in construction, and
the fact that all the lines carry the
'•y upward, while in Classical archi
tecture the eye is carried toward the
'earth. One always experiences a feel
: ing of emotional tension on eutering
a Gothic cathedral."
Many slides were shown giving the
interior construction of the Rheims
cathedral, which is now almost a mass
of ruins, as are many in northern
I'ranee and Belgium, which, though of
no military value, were ruthlessly de
stroyed by the Germans. "A few
were saved," Dr. Greene said, "prob
ably be cause some German professor
had written a monograph on them."
