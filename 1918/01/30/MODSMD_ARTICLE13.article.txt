# AN ASSEMBLY WORTH WHILE
## 
### 
All Stanford will be interested in the message to be delivered at to
morrow morning's assembly by the two Stanford men who have icccntly
returned from service in the first ambulance units in France. This will
be the first time Stanford men returning from the front will appear before
a University assembly, and the entire student body should be on hand to
greet them and to receive in proper fashion the flag they bring back with
them.
Madame Dupriez, the other speaker of tomorrow's assembly, while not
possessing the hold on our personal interest that Blote and Malm have,
brings a message that merits a hearing on account of its importance in
affairs "over there" at this moment as well as in that somewhat mythical
future time "after the war."
