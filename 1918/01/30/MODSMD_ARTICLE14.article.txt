# THE 						BEST IN AMERICA

### 
There is something amusing about the sub-head to the title of one of
the middle western college papers that come to the office of The Daily
Palo Alto. Beneath its heading The De Pauw Daily, appears the black
face line, "The best college daily in America." Undoubtedly the De Pauw
Daily is an interesting journal to the students of the university where it is
published, but it is inferior to a score of student newspapers of the other
universities in this country. The Daily Palo Alto may be strictly provin
cial at times but we have never yet reached that stage of provincialism
where we felt like making a claim to distinction such as that advanced by
the De Pauw Daily. While we do not feel we can lay claim to being Amer
ica's "best" college newspaper, we are just provincial enough to think we
are, in some respects at least, a little better than De Pauw's daily.
