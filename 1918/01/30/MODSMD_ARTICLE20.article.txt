# Interesting Meeting of Wranglers for Tonight
## 
### 
"With the Would-Be American," an
interesting article written by Frank
J. Taylor. '18, will be the subject of a
talk by Miss Henrietta Dickey, '20,
before Wranglers tonight. The home
of the "Would-Be American" is down
in little Albania, the orphan of the
Balkans. The inhabitants of this
country have a great admiration for
the United States and the second am
bulance unit, of which Taylor was a
member, was treated royally by them
while in the Balkans.
