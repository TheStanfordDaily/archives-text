# Stanford Man in France Wins Aviation License
## 
### 
France Q. Wilson, '12, has been
awarded the French brevet of avia
tors, according to word received in
San Jose by friends. He was the first
of fifty American candidates to re
ceive this honor.
Wilson finished his voyage and al
titude work on November 27, and was
immediately given the brevet's li
cense, which is similar to the pilot's
license of America. The French Aero
Club is the head of all avitaion clubs,
and a person holding its license can
obtain one from any country by mak
ing application. The brevet's license
carries with it a commission as first
lieutenant. Wilson finished his work
several weeks ahead of his competi
tors. He was a member of Delta Tan
Delta at Stanford.
