# STANFORD OPINION IS SQUARELY BEHIND TWO CONTEST PROPOSITION
## 
### 
Stanford opinion is squarely behind
the proposition to play two games of
football with California, according to
opinions expressed by members of
the Board of Athletic Control and
leading students on the campus. Au
thorities at llie University of Califor
nia have expressed no opinion as yet,
but an opinion one way or another
should be given in the next few days.
Schaupp Statement.
Dr. Karl L. Schaupp, member of the
Board of Athletic Control, said today
in regard to the proposal: "The prop
osition seems to me to be absolutely
reasonable and essentially fair. If Cal
ifornia and Stanford agree on the
question of scholarship requirements
the proposition should be accepted."
Since Stanford, officially, has an
nounced she will not use freshmen in
the games, this question has been re
moved.
Mitchell Approves.
The article printed in the Daily
Palo Alto of January 29, 1918,
concerning athletic relations with
the University of California con
tains one erroneous statement to
the effect that the proposition was
made officially by the Board of
Athletic Control to the University
of California. Unofficial conver
sations on the basis indicated
have been going 011 between
alumni for some months, but the
only official action of the Board of
Athletic Control taken at its
meeting 011 November 22, 1917,
was to agree to meet with a com
mittee of equal authority from

University of California for joint
consideration of the situation. 1
understand that the proposed
meeting was not held because 110
committee with equal authority
has been organized at the Uni
versity of California.
For my own part, 1 consider the
proposition as it was printed to be
entirely fair to both sides, and
am ready to go ahead and work
out the details on this basis.
While there may be some minor
adjustments to make, I cannot
see any insuperable difficulties in
the way of a satisfactory solution
of the present situation.

Since the program as announced
yesterday has not been officially pre
sented to California, 110 further nego
tiations can be carried on between
the two universities until such action
lias been taken by the Board of Ath
letic Control. With opinion squarely
behind the proposal, the official action
should be much along the lines ex
pressed in the Daily Palo Alto, how
ever.
R. L. Templeton, '18, varsity fifteen
captain for 1918, and O. M. Sullivan,
'19, graduate manager, both expressed
opinions of approval in regard to the
proposal today. These are as follows:
If there ever was an opportun
ity for California and Stanford to
get together aagin on the foot
ball proposition, that opportunity
is at hand. It looks to me as if
the proposals made by the Board
of Control are the fairest pro-
posals that could be made under
the circumstances. The only pos
sible point on which the two uni
versities could disagree is the
third one in regard to eligibility
rules, and any dispute on that
point is done away with by the will
ingness of Stanford to staiid by
the Pacific Coast Conference
rules. I sincerely hope that Cal
ifornia meets this proposition in a
fair manner, and recognizes the
fairness of it. Both schools want
the big game back, and the
quicker we get it, the better.

Stanford is making California a
proposition which is conceded by
even California leaders as emi
nently fair and sportsmanlike. If
it is not accepted it will be be
cause California believes they
have us where they want us. and
that it will only be a matter of
time before Stanford will be
forced to cut out itugby and make
the change to American, and that
the two-game plan is simply a
move to cover up a beating. But
they are badly mistaken. Stan
ford was never more serious than
at present. One game is bound
to win out and Stanford hopes
it's the best one.
If California turns down this
offer our hands will be tied, and
the next move toward getting to
gether will be up to them.

'19, graduate manager, both expressed
opinions of approval in regard to the
proposal today. These are as follows:
If there ever was an opportun
ity for California and Stanford to
get together aagin on the foot
ball proposition, that opportunity
is at hand. It looks to me as if
the proposals made by the Board
of Control are the fairest pro-
posals that could be made under
the circumstances. The only pos
sible point on which the two uni
versities could disagree is the
third one in regard to eligibility
rules, and any dispute on that
point is done away with by the will
ingness of Stanford to staiid by
the Pacific Coast Conference
rules. I sincerely hope that Cal
ifornia meets this proposition in a
fair manner, and recognizes the
fairness of it. Both schools want
the big game back, and the
quicker we get it, the better.
OWEN M. SULLIVAN.
Stanford is making California a
proposition which is conceded by
even California leaders as emi
nently fair and sportsmanlike. If
it is not accepted it will be be
cause California believes they
have us where they want us. and
that it will only be a matter of
time before Stanford will be
forced to cut out itugby and make
the change to American, and that
the two-game plan is simply a
move to cover up a beating. But
they are badly mistaken. Stan
ford was never more serious than
at present. One game is bound
to win out and Stanford hopes
it's the best one.
If California turns down this
offer our hands will be tied, and
the next move toward getting to
gether will be up to them.
R. L. TEMPLETON.
Stanford opinion is squarely behind
the proposition to play two games of
football with California, according to
opinions expressed by members of
the Board of Athletic Control and
leading students on the campus. Au
thorities at llie University of Califor
nia have expressed no opinion as yet,
but an opinion one way or another
should be given in the next few days.
Schaupp Statement.
Dr. Karl L. Schaupp, member of the
Board of Athletic Control, said today
in regard to the proposal: "The prop
osition seems to me to be absolutely
reasonable and essentially fair. If Cal
ifornia and Stanford agree on the
question of scholarship requirements
the proposition should be accepted."
Since Stanford, officially, has an
nounced she will not use freshmen in
the games, this question has been re
moved.

The article printed in the Daily
Palo Alto of January 29, 1918,
concerning athletic relations with
the University of California con
tains one erroneous statement to
the effect that the proposition was
made officially by the Board of
Athletic Control to the University
of California. Unofficial conver
sations on the basis indicated
have been going 011 between
alumni for some months, but the
only official action of the Board of
Athletic Control taken at its
meeting 011 November 22, 1917,
was to agree to meet with a com
mittee of equal authority from

University of California for joint
consideration of the situation. 1
understand that the proposed
meeting was not held because 110
committee with equal authority
has been organized at the Uni
versity of California.
For my own part, 1 consider the
proposition as it was printed to be
entirely fair to both sides, and
am ready to go ahead and work
out the details on this basis.
While there may be some minor
adjustments to make, I cannot
see any insuperable difficulties in
the way of a satisfactory solution
of the present situation.

the games, this question has been re
moved.
Mitchell Approves.
The article printed in the Daily
Palo Alto of January 29, 1918,
concerning athletic relations with
the University of California con
tains one erroneous statement to
the effect that the proposition was
made officially by the Board of
Athletic Control to the University
of California. Unofficial conver
sations on the basis indicated
have been going 011 between
alumni for some months, but the
only official action of the Board of
Athletic Control taken at its
meeting 011 November 22, 1917,
was to agree to meet with a com
mittee of equal authority from

University of California for joint
consideration of the situation. 1
understand that the proposed
meeting was not held because 110
committee with equal authority
has been organized at the Uni
versity of California.
For my own part, 1 consider the
proposition as it was printed to be
entirely fair to both sides, and
am ready to go ahead and work
out the details on this basis.
While there may be some minor
adjustments to make, I cannot
see any insuperable difficulties in
the way of a satisfactory solution
of the present situation.

Since the program as announced
yesterday has not been officially pre
sented to California, 110 further nego
tiations can be carried on between
the two universities until such action
lias been taken by the Board of Ath
letic Control. With opinion squarely
behind the proposal, the official action
should be much along the lines ex
pressed in the Daily Palo Alto, how
ever.
R. L. Templeton, '18, varsity fifteen
captain for 1918, and O. M. Sullivan,
'19, graduate manager, both expressed
opinions of approval in regard to the
proposal today. These are as follows:
If there ever was an opportun
ity for California and Stanford to
get together aagin on the foot
ball proposition, that opportunity
is at hand. It looks to me as if
the proposals made by the Board
of Control are the fairest pro-
posals that could be made under
the circumstances. The only pos
sible point on which the two uni
versities could disagree is the
third one in regard to eligibility
rules, and any dispute on that
point is done away with by the will
ingness of Stanford to staiid by
the Pacific Coast Conference
rules. I sincerely hope that Cal
ifornia meets this proposition in a
fair manner, and recognizes the
fairness of it. Both schools want
the big game back, and the
quicker we get it, the better.
OWEN M. SULLIVAN.
Stanford is making California a
proposition which is conceded by
even California leaders as emi
nently fair and sportsmanlike. If
it is not accepted it will be be
cause California believes they
have us where they want us. and
that it will only be a matter of
time before Stanford will be
forced to cut out itugby and make
the change to American, and that
the two-game plan is simply a
move to cover up a beating. But
they are badly mistaken. Stan
ford was never more serious than
at present. One game is bound
to win out and Stanford hopes
it's the best one.
If California turns down this
offer our hands will be tied, and
the next move toward getting to
gether will be up to them.
R. L. TEMPLETON.
