"This community has shown admir
able development in the last month,"
said Dr. Wilbur today, "and the stu
dents arc giving evidence that they
are awakening to the seriousness of
the war situation. They have come lo
realize their individual responsibility,
and the sooner the people of the en
tire country do this the sooner will
the war be won. A person does not
have to put on khaki in order to do
his bit in the war, as some of the stu
dents seemed to think at first, I be
lieve. 1 am much pleased to see the
change of attitude here recently."
