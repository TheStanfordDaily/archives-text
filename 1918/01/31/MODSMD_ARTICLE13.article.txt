# INTERCOLLEGIATE PEACE AT HAND
## 
### 
Stanford's Board of Athletic Control late this afternoon drew up an
official statement of the proposition for the resumption of athletic relations
in football with California, embodying the three main principles as pub
lished in The Daily Palo Alto on Tuesday. This document will be deliv
ered to California Saturday, thus removing their last excuse for delay in
formulating an answer.
California has at last awakened from her apathy and through
the president of the student body has stated that its representatives are
willing to hold a preliminary conference in San Francisco Saturday noon.
Before that time the powers that be in the Blue and Gold camp will have
the opportunity to examine the official declaration of the Stanford Athletic
Board and formulate their opinion upon it. Saturday's conference
should produce good results and it is sincerely to be hoped that the
delegates on both sides will take the matter up in a straightforward man
ner and cooperate in putting the peace terms through for once and all
without bickering over minor points.
After almost four years of separation a reunion of California and Stan
ford in football at last seems imminently possible. We sincerely hope
that this resumption of relations will be a reality in the near future.
