"With the Would-Be American," an
articlc of exceptional interest written
by Frank J. Taylor, '18, was read and
discussed by Miss Henrietta Dickey,
'20, before Wranglers, last night. "The
Would-Be American" is the Albanian;
hampered on all sides by three war
ring powers, the average Albanian
has but one ambition leftâ€”to leave
the land of his forefathers and go to
America." Taylor said, "Most Alban
ians who have not been to America
have relatives there."
The Albanians are an agricultural
people, and their crops being de
stroyed by the enemy, tliey have had
to be fed by the French government.
