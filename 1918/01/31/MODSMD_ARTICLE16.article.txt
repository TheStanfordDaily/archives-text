Second in a series of articles on the
air service appears below, in compli
ance with a request from the Chief
Signal Officer, U. S. A., to publish on
specified dates in college newspapers
throughout the country, three articles
on the aviation service. The first of
these articles appeared about a week
ago, describing the nature of air
work, the second, printed below,
has to do with the training for the
air service, and the third, which will
appear in an early issue, discusses
the making of an airman.
THE TRAINING OF AN AIRMAN.
The training of America's new air
men is one of the most scientific and
the most fascinating courses of study
ever evolved. It has every need to be
scientific because it provides a gen
eral knowledge of the world's new
est sciences; it has every certainty
of being fascinating because it goes
far into the mysteries of flight, of wire
less, of codes, of reconnaissance. It is
stimulated all the way through, more
over, by that irresistible urge of na
tional service and by the knowledge
that every bit of added skill gained
will return with interest in one of
those forthcoming crises in the skies
of France.
Course Divided Into Three Steps.
The course is divided into three dis
tinct steps,—the ground schools, the
flying schools in this country, and the
final advanced flying schools abroad.
This has been necessary because it
provides an admirable means of
measuring the men and rapidly and
logically sifting out the unfit; and
also because it allows the greatest
mobilization of resources, —the big
universities in this country for the
preliminary technical work, the new
flying fields here with America's good
training planes, and the wonderful
schools abroad with their supply of
fighting planes and seasoned pilots
and their atmosphere of battle. Under
this sytem Americans are assured of
a composite course based upon the
best of everything gained in three
years of warfare abroad, and are not
held back by the original lack of facil
ties here.
Cadet Directed to "Ground School."
Immediately a cadet is called into
active service he is directed to a
"ground school" at one of the eight
large engineering universities which
have placed their resources at the
service of the government. Here the
student aviator is under military dis
cipline, but with all the comforts, the
facilities and the atmosphere of col
lege life.
The purpose of this work is two
fold: First and most important it
provides a fundamental knowledge of
the principles of all the sciences of
aviation, which gives a rock-bottom
foundation to a cadet's training.
Second, it quickly uncovers those who,
both for the good of the service and
of themselves, should go no further.
The cadets learn here how to take
an engine, a machine-gun, or a plane
apart and put it together again.
They become so familiar with the
mechanisms they will soon be using
as to have an instinctive mastery of
them. No one of them will he allowed
to go into the air until lie under
stands every phase of the machine
underneath him. He will then have
all the confidence that an expert
horseman has in his favorite mount.
Wireless and Morse Mastered.
Wireless and the Morse code are
also mastered so that the men can
talk to their guns from the air as
they would through a telephone.
Then they are sot at "spotting," look
ing down upon an exact reproduction
of a part of the front and wirelessing
back the location of flashes made to
represent bursting shells. Aerial
photography, reconnaissance, air tac
tics and the like are also studied, and
military drill, calisthenics, and army
regulations mastered. By the end of
eight weeks the cadet is thoroughly
"grounded" in aviation and assured,
as far as it is humanly possible to
give assurance, that he is prepared to
go off the ground.
Then come the flying schools. It
is not possible for military reasons

those forthcoming crises in the skies
of France.
Course Divided Into Three Steps.
The course is divided into three dis
tinct steps,—the ground schools, the
flying schools in this country, and the
final advanced flying schools abroad.
This has been necessary because it
provides an admirable means of
measuring the men and rapidly and
logically sifting out the unfit; and
also because it allows the greatest
mobilization of resources, —the big
universities in this country for the
preliminary technical work, the new
flying fields here with America's good
training planes, and the wonderful
schools abroad with their supply of
fighting planes and seasoned pilots
and their atmosphere of battle. Under
this sytem Americans are assured of
a composite course based upon the
best of everything gained in three
years of warfare abroad, and are not
held back by the original lack of facil
ties here.
Cadet Directed to "Ground School."
Immediately a cadet is called into
active service he is directed to a
"ground school" at one of the eight
large engineering universities which
have placed their resources at the
service of the government. Here the
student aviator is under military dis
cipline, but with all the comforts, the
facilities and the atmosphere of col
lege life.
The purpose of this work is two
fold: First and most important it
provides a fundamental knowledge of
the principles of all the sciences of
aviation, which gives a rock-bottom
foundation to a cadet's training.
Second, it quickly uncovers those who,
both for the good of the service and
of themselves, should go no further.
The cadets learn here how to take
an engine, a machine-gun, or a plane
apart and put it together again.
They become so familiar with the
mechanisms they will soon be using
as to have an instinctive mastery of
them. No one of them will he allowed
to go into the air until lie under
stands every phase of the machine
underneath him. He will then have
all the confidence that an expert
horseman has in his favorite mount.
Wireless and Morse Mastered.
Wireless and the Morse code are
also mastered so that the men can
talk to their guns from the air as
they would through a telephone.
Then they are sot at "spotting," look
ing down upon an exact reproduction
of a part of the front and wirelessing
back the location of flashes made to
represent bursting shells. Aerial
photography, reconnaissance, air tac
tics and the like are also studied, and
military drill, calisthenics, and army
regulations mastered. By the end of
eight weeks the cadet is thoroughly
"grounded" in aviation and assured,
as far as it is humanly possible to
give assurance, that he is prepared to
go off the ground.
Then come the flying schools. It
is not possible for military reasons
Second in a series of articles on the
air service appears below, in compli

Signal Officer, U. S. A., to publish on
specified dates in college newspapers
throughout the country, three articles
on the aviation service. The first of
these articles appeared about a week

work, the second, printed below,

THE TRAINING OF AN AIRMAN.
The training of America's new air
men is one of the most scientific and
the most fascinating courses of study
ever evolved. It has every need to be
scientific because it provides a gen
eral knowledge of the world's new
est sciences; it has every certainty
of being fascinating because it goes
far into the mysteries of flight, of wire
less, of codes, of reconnaissance. It is
stimulated all the way through, more
over, by that irresistible urge of na
tional service and by the knowledge
that every bit of added skill gained
will return with interest in one of
those forthcoming crises in the skies
of France.
