to describe them in detail. It can be
said, however, that the size of these
schools would be startling to the un
initiated, who would see in them a life
of which he had hardly dreamed, a
life that ushers in the new day of air
travel for man. And he would also
see groups of cadets, flying, studying,
working, oblivious of time and of
hours, fascinated by the romance of
their subjects, earnest to prove equal
to every test in the realization that
the great test of all lies just over
the hill of tomorrow.
Thrill <»f First Flight.
F'icture the thrill of the first flight
with the instructor; then the feeling
of power that gradually begins to
come as the control of the machine
is more and more taken over; the
exasperation and then the joy as the
all difficult work of landing is con
quered; finally the exaltation of the
first soaring aloft, alone. Bit by bit
the airman stretches out his wings,
flying a little further, a little longer, a
little higher each day, until he feels
himself master of the air. Then with
a 30-mile cross-country flight and a
10,000 foot altitude test, he is proved
—a Reserve Military Aviator and a

commissioned officer in America's Air
Army, wearing l the coveted wings and
shield of Uncle Sam.
One step remains. Pinal training
in evolution, in squadron formation,
and in battle practice is given, in
France, on the latest, up-to-the-minute
machines under seasoned French air
men, in the actual atmosphere of bat
tle. At its conclusion, the aviator is
trained as highly as it is possible to
train him, is awarded his junior mili
tary aviator brevet, promoted one
grade and is ready whenever duty
calls him.
This is man's work. It requires
physique, brains, and concentration.
II is worked out upon the principle
of complete mastery of every step be
fore another step is taken. It is sur
rounded with every precaution for
safety, as is shown by the fact that
not a dozen fatal air-accidents have
occurred among all the hundreds of
men trained. It requires the highest
type of college men, not more men,
but better men.
