# VARSITY QUINTET DEFEATS FREMONT IN CLOSE CONTEST
## 
### 
Stanford and Base Hospital 47 of
Camp Fremont last night furnished
the best basketball seen on Encina
court this year, the Varsity winning
by the close score of 26 to 22. Flood
berg, captain-elect at the University
of California in basketball this year,
was the star of the game. The little
forward shot baskets from all parts
of the floor and in addition was the
biggest factor in the team-play for
the soldiers.
Stanford used substitutes in the
first half but these men were able to
roll up a 17 to 12 score against the
hospital team. This count came main
ly as a result of teamwork on the part
of the Cardinal forwards Carver and
Bucklin. Carver dropped four bas
kets, while Bucklin contributed three.
At the opening of the second half
the soldier team speeded up its play
and Floodberg put the Fremont live
in the lead with four sensational field
baskets and one foul shot, while Stan
ford came through with but two field
scores, one by Schwarzenbek and the
other by Johannsen. Coach Wilson !
sent Butt in at this point, however,
and lie ended the scoring for the vis
itors. The count remained even for
several minutes until Ilood put the
Cardinals in the lead with a sensa- :
tional shot from the center of the i
floor. At the same time Floodberg
was knocked out in a collision with
Butt and Stanford retained possession
of the ball until Hood put the game on
ice with another basket just before
the final whistle.
