## Mme. Dupriez Thrills Audience 
### 
" 'If we must die, let us die with
honor' —this is the united feeling of
my people and the brave words of
our king," said Mme. Leon Dupriez in
her speech this morning before a
packed Assmbly Hall.
Simply, but very vividly, Mme. Du
priez related her experience during
the German invasion of Louvain. Re
fusing to believe the many terrible
stories told her of the cruelty of the
advancing German army, she, with
her husband and four small children,
remained in the city.
"We were sitting in our garden,
waiting." said Mme. Dupriez, "on that
day on which it had been reported
that the Germans would enter —when
suddenly overhead was heard a whist
ling sound. The invaders were an
nouncing their arrival with shells. A
little later, in dead silence they en
tered. From behind our drawn cur
tains my husband and I watched.
First came a motor car filled with of
ficers, each with a drawn revolver,
ready to fire, and then, hour after
hour came the troops."
During the next six days Mine. Du
priez was forced to house and feed
German officers. She was told that if
any trouble occurred their home would
be burned. At one time, when Pro
fessor Dupriez upheld Belgium's
honor in resisting the German army,
a German officer replied: "Your
honor —there is no dishonor in obey
ing German orders."
Heroically Mme. Dupriez faced the
Germans and rifles. Attributing it to
the fact, that she spoke German and
was a woman, the men hesitated,
finally ordering them from their home.
During the rest of the day Mme. Du
priez with her husband and children
fled from house to house.
"T hen came tlie order to leave the
city within five minutes. Forty-five
thousand people, old and young, left
the city, all walking."
Mine. Dupriez touched brielly on
the present condition of Belgium.
"Nothing is left to my people—every
thing has been taken or destroyed,"
she concluded, "and most terrible of
all is the deportation of the children."

honor' —this is the united feeling of
my people and the brave words of
our king," said Mme. Leon Dupriez in
her speech this morning before a
packed Assmbly Hall.
Simply, but very vividly, Mme. Du
priez related her experience during
the German invasion of Louvain. Re
fusing to believe the many terrible
stories told her of the cruelty of the
advancing German army, she, with
her husband and four small children,
remained in the city.
"We were sitting in our garden,
waiting." said Mme. Dupriez, "on that
day on which it had been reported
that the Germans would enter —when
suddenly overhead was heard a whist
ling sound. The invaders were an
nouncing their arrival with shells. A
little later, in dead silence they en
tered. From behind our drawn cur
tains my husband and I watched.
First came a motor car filled with of
ficers, each with a drawn revolver,
ready to fire, and then, hour after
hour came the troops."
During the next six days Mine. Du
priez was forced to house and feed
German officers. She was told that if
any trouble occurred their home would
be burned. At one time, when Pro
fessor Dupriez upheld Belgium's
honor in resisting the German army,
a German officer replied: "Your
honor —there is no dishonor in obey
ing German orders."
Heroically Mme. Dupriez faced the
Germans and rifles. Attributing it to
the fact, that she spoke German and
was a woman, the men hesitated,
finally ordering them from their home.
During the rest of the day Mme. Du
priez with her husband and children
fled from house to house.
"T hen came tlie order to leave the
city within five minutes. Forty-five
thousand people, old and young, left
the city, all walking."
Mine. Dupriez touched brielly on
the present condition of Belgium.
"Nothing is left to my people—every
thing has been taken or destroyed,"
she concluded, "and most terrible of
all is the deportation of the children."
