## Hall, on Mound for Soldiers, Allows But Two Hits. Harvey Is Wild 
### 
Stanford's varsity nine suffered its
first defeat of the season yesterday
afternoon wnen Field Hospital 31 won
from the Cardinal 7 to 0. The score
came as a result of errors on the part
of Stanford fielders, coupled with the
air-tight pitching of Hall, on the
mound for the Fremont team. Harvey
started the game for the Cardinals,
but was wild, and Briggs, who relieved
him, was hit freely.
The first man up for the Fremont
team in the initial inning was given
a walk by Harvey. Pedroni, next on
the batting order, also drew a free
ride to first. Then came the prize
boner of the day. Brislin bunted be
tween first and pitcher. Harvey failed
to field the bunt, Davis covered first,
and Parthum went over to second. As
a result the ball rolled out into right
field and Caughlin came in on the
play. Dodson, next man up, hit to
Galloway, who pegged high at home,
and two more runners came in. Camp
bell when he did get the ball threw
wild to Dickey at home plate and Dod
son came home for the fourth coun
ter. Vecki, hitting next, drew a walk,
while Lindsay doubled, advancing him
to third. Harvey found himself after
this hit, however, and put out the
next three men.
Dickey, the lead-off man for the
Cardinal, singled in the first inning,
then stole second, but the next three
hitters could not bring him home. The
soldiers went out in one, two, three
order in the second, but in the third
errors allowed them to count again.
Dodson, the first man up, was walked
by Harvey. Vecki then hit to second
and a combination of errors by Par
thurn, Galloway and Dickey allowed
Dodson to score. Bryan hit into a
double play, however, and Hall was
an easy third out for the remainder of
the inning.
Both teams went scoreless from
here until the sixth inning, when the
soldier nine tallied twice off Briggs,
who had relieved Harvey. Dobbins
and Hall singled to start the proceed
ings. Caughlin was the first out when
he fanned. I'edroni hit to Galloway,
who threw Hall out at second, leaving
two men on bases. Brislin hitting
next, found one to his liking and
doubled to left, bringing in two runs.
Dodson was an easy third out. Both
teams were scoreless in the last in
nings, although the Cardinal threat
ened in the seventh, when Galloway
hit for a single. Doe, Davis and Camp
bell could not bring him in, however.

Stanford's varsity nine suffered its
first defeat of the season yesterday
afternoon wnen Field Hospital 31 won
from the Cardinal 7 to 0. The score
came as a result of errors on the part
of Stanford fielders, coupled with the
air-tight pitching of Hall, on the
mound for the Fremont team. Harvey
started the game for the Cardinals,
but was wild, and Briggs, who relieved
him, was hit freely.
The first man up for the Fremont
team in the initial inning was given
a walk by Harvey. Pedroni, next on
the batting order, also drew a free
ride to first. Then came the prize
boner of the day. Brislin bunted be
tween first and pitcher. Harvey failed
to field the bunt, Davis covered first,
and Parthum went over to second. As
a result the ball rolled out into right
field and Caughlin came in on the
play. Dodson, next man up, hit to
Galloway, who pegged high at home,
and two more runners came in. Camp
bell when he did get the ball threw
wild to Dickey at home plate and Dod
son came home for the fourth coun
ter. Vecki, hitting next, drew a walk,
while Lindsay doubled, advancing him
to third. Harvey found himself after
this hit, however, and put out the
next three men.
Dickey, the lead-off man for the
Cardinal, singled in the first inning,
then stole second, but the next three
hitters could not bring him home. The
soldiers went out in one, two, three
order in the second, but in the third
errors allowed them to count again.
Dodson, the first man up, was walked
by Harvey. Vecki then hit to second
and a combination of errors by Par
thurn, Galloway and Dickey allowed
Dodson to score. Bryan hit into a
double play, however, and Hall was
an easy third out for the remainder of
the inning.
Both teams went scoreless from
here until the sixth inning, when the
soldier nine tallied twice off Briggs,
who had relieved Harvey. Dobbins
and Hall singled to start the proceed
ings. Caughlin was the first out when
he fanned. I'edroni hit to Galloway,
who threw Hall out at second, leaving
two men on bases. Brislin hitting
next, found one to his liking and
doubled to left, bringing in two runs.
Dodson was an easy third out. Both
teams were scoreless in the last in
nings, although the Cardinal threat
ened in the seventh, when Galloway
hit for a single. Doe, Davis and Camp
bell could not bring him in, however.
