# ERRORS BEAT VARSITY NINE IN HOSPITAL TEAM CONTEST
## Hall, on Mound for Soldiers, Allows But Two Hits. Harvey Is Wild 
### 
Stanford's varsity nine suffered its
first defeat of the season yesterday
afternoon wnen Field Hospital 31 won
from the Cardinal 7 to 0. The score
came as a result of errors on the part
of Stanford fielders, coupled with the
air-tight pitching of Hall, on the
mound for the Fremont team. Harvey
started the game for the Cardinals,
but was wild, and Briggs, who relieved
him, was hit freely.
The first man up for the Fremont
team in the initial inning was given
a walk by Harvey. Pedroni, next on
the batting order, also drew a free
ride to first. Then came the prize
boner of the day. Brislin bunted be
tween first and pitcher. Harvey failed
to field the bunt, Davis covered first,
and Parthum went over to second. As
a result the ball rolled out into right
