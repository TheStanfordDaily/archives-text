## H.C. Blote Relates French Experiences 
### 
Stanford students listened with
great interest to the account of the
first Stanford unit, told by H. C.
Blote, 'IS, at the assembly held this
morning.
Blote spoke of the marked wel
come that the unit received, here in
this country and later in France.
"The French people really felt that
this handful of Americans were the
advance guard of the thousands to
come. After a two weeks' stay in
Paris, we left for the Verdun post.
We were equipped with twenty-five
new ambulances, the words 'American
Field Ambulance' painted on the side.
Not far from Paris we began to no
tice the white crosses marking the
graves of fallen Frenchmen, and the
black of the Germans. They could be
seen in the meadows and fields pnd
along the roadside. Our first impres
sion of the war itself came through
our eyes. We saw the observation
balloons above the trenches, four
miles apart, in a long line. Our unit
was stationed at Verdun, where there
are no houses left standing and hun
dreds of rats everywhere.
"We stayed here a month," con
tinued Mr. Blote, "and were then
transferred to the Lorraine front.
Here all the children carry gas masks.
I have seen little girls jumping rope
—their masks hanging on the fence
near by."
Mr. Blote spoke of the courage and
patience of the French soldier. "He
is never too tired or wounded to
thank you."
During the summer part of the first
unit returned to Paris and formed the
second Stanford division. They were
sent to the Balkans, where in one
month their cars traveled over 4r»,000
miles in carrying the wounded.
The flag belonging to the first unit,
brought back by Blote and W. R.
Malm, '17, was not presented to the
University, as had been arranged.
Owing to the fact that this is the first
American flag to be decorated by a
foreign government and that so few
of the unit would be present, it was
thought that it would be better to
wait until more of the men had re
turned.
