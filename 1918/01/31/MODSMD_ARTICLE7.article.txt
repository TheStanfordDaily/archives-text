# Chaparral's Neophytes Impersonate Bow-wows
## 
### 
The old familiar scene of "Fido"
with a tin can tied to his tail wasn't
in it with Chaparral's neophytes to
day, when they calmly and gracefully
wended their way up the Row on
hands and knees, artistically draped
with various and assorted tomato
cans, and further embellished with
such arrangements as coats and caps
put on rear end foremost.
There was something about the
touching spectacle that brought tears
to the eyes of the tender-hearted.
One fair lady was overheard to ex
claim, "Oh, look at Lester! Imper
sonating a dog. Whatever put that
into his head?" Others expressed
themselves as fearing for the sound
ness and sanity of the victims. And
one senior, old and wise, as all sen
iors should be, went on record as
saying that the fact that the forlorn
spectacles were soon to be members
of the Chaparral staff was good evi
dence of insanity.
Tonight in the wicked city of
Frisco, further unknown orgies are
to come to pass. The nature of these
will probably be too awful for words,
but it is believed that the neophytes
will finish the evening tilled with
good spirits.
