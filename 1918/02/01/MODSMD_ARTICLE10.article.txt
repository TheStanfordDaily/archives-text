# FEBRUARY NUMBER OF SEQUOIA WILL BE OUT NEXT WEEK
## 
### 
The February number of the Stan
ford Sequoia will appear next week,
after a lapse of two months. No issue
was published in January, due to a
change in the staff, but the February
number promises to make up for lost
time, with some live stories, articles,
and verse by campus versifiers.
Miss Dare Stark, '17, is the new
editor elected last month by English
Club, and W. W. Wellman, *20, is
manager.
An effort will be made to confine
advertisements to a separate adver
tising section, so that the reading
matter will not be mixed in with the
advertisements.
"Sketch Book," which was discon
tinued in the last three issues, is ex
pected to form another section of the
magazine. Under this heading will
be found shorter stories, timely ar
ticles, and essays. Contributions from
new writers are especially desired for
this part of Sequoia.
Articles from France and Albania
by Stanford men in the ambulance
service will be included from time to
time, together with others by men in
touch with foreign affairs.
