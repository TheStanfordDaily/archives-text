# MISS HARKER'S WILL GIVE TEA WEDNESDAY
## 
### 
Miss Katherine Harker will be
hostess at the second Wednesday tea
of the quarter, which will be held next
week in the Women's Club House.
She will be assisted by her mother,
Mrs. Sarah E. Harker, Miss M.
Smith, Miss E. Crumby, and Miss
Florence Stewart.
An interesting program has been
arranged for the tea which is given
by the resident alumnae. The services
of Mrs. John Thome Lane of San Fran
cisco have been secured to assist in the
entertainment. She will give a reading.
The Wednesday teas are now given
monthly rather than weekly, as was
the case last quarter. Proceeds from
the tea will go toward the completion
of the clubhouse.
Those in charge of the coming tea
have expressed the hope that a large
crowd will be present.
