Miss Thea Noack, '19, head of the
Stanford Red Cross Auxiliary, urges
that all women who are using wool
from local headquarters bring any
surplus quantities of it in to the
Women's Club House immediately.
Wool is very scarce and all the avail
able stock is badly needed.
Stanford women who work on band
ages or with gauze are asked to pro
vide themselves with white aprons
and a cap or covering for the head.
'I'hero are a few aprons at the club
house, but not enough to furnish the
regular workers.
The National T>ed Cross has sent
out a call for as many more helmets
and scarfs as can be knitted. There
is a greater shortage of them than of
sweaters, and every Stanford woman
is asked to contribute her energies
toward increasing the stock.
