# SATURDAY'S MEET TO SHOW UP TRACK PROSPECTS
## DISTANCE EVENTS ARE TO BE SHORTENED Informal Contests to Feature the Spring Training Season 
### 
Saturday morning at 10:15 Stan
ford's track hopes will blossom forth
for their first real workout of the sea
son. Track Captain A. P. Wilson, '18,
in commenting on the meet and the
object of holding it this early in the
year, said that the general plan was
to bring the men out en masse, so
that a rough estimate of the number
and caliber of the men out for track
could be had.
As Wilson pointed out, conditions
this year have made training uncer
tain, since the men are permitted to
do their training at any time during
the day, because of the military drill
at the usual track hour. For this rea
son Saturday morning meets of an
informal character and more in the
nature of easy competitive workouts
will be held frequently throughout the
season. Outside competition will be
arranged for later.
The contest Saturday will be over
shortened distances, each man being
limited to one track event and any
field events he wishes to enter. The
men are urged to all be on hand, even
if they are not yet in condition to run
in competition, since the races will
be very informal in their character,
and merely for purposes of competi
tive practice.
Shortened distance events will be
the rule. Sprinters will display their
wares over the century distance,
quarter-milers over 352 yards, half
milers over fifiO, and long-distance men
probably will run three laps. Hurd
lers will compete over the low hur
dles for 120 yards. A relay event is
planned but no definite arrangements
have been made in this respect. The
regular field events will be held,
which include high jump, broad jump,
pole vault, shot-put, and hammer
throw.
All track men are expected to be on
hand at 10:15, whether they plan
competing or not; the officials for the
track season, as named in yesterday's
Daily Palo Alto, are likewise re
quired to appear.
