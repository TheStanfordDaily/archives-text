# SLACKERS AT HOME

On the opposite page there appears a statement published by the As
sociated Students. This "advertisement" first appeared on Tuesday and
was reprinted yesterday. It is a simple and direct appeal for prompt ac
tion and lots of it on the part of the men and women who have not yet
purchased their student l>*ly membership cards. It announced the fact
that the graduate manager's office would be open most of the day on Wed
nesday and Thursday to receive payments for memberships.
Almost incredible as it may seem, only nine of the 807 students who
had not hitherto bought tickets came around and got their cards since
the notice first appeared. This attitude of indifference on the part of
both men and women of the University has been the subject of comment
from this column several times in the past. If it continues it means that
over half the students of Stanford are slackers and are not living up to
their responsibilities.
In past years Stanford men and women had enough backbone to do
things that ought to be done themselves and not to assume the criminally
complacent attitude of "letting the other fellow do it." This matter of
student memberships cannot be left to this hypothetical -'other fellow" who
does not exist, but it must be taken up by every single student registered
in the University. Every man and every woman who has not yet pur
chased a student body card and who does not do so immediately is a slacker
and as such cannot rightfully merit the name of a real Stanford man or
woman. Turn to the statement on page three and read it carefully. Then
go down to the graduate manager's office Monday and buy your A. S. S.
U. ticket without further delay.
