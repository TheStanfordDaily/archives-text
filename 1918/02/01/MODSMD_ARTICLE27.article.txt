# Stolen Bases

### 
Lilly's aggregation was a little off
color Wednesday, both in hitting and
fielding. After the game, the infield
was pat through a practice session
by the captain.
Dickey and Galloway were the only
Stanford men to hit safely off from
the army pitcher. Dickey secured his
bingle in the first inning, 011 the sec
ond ball pitched, while Galloway
clouted one in the seventh.

The varsity was in the air during
the early innings, and as a result the
Fremont nine secured enough runs to
win the game.
*******
Base Hospital 47 turned out in full
force to root for its team. The sol
diers filled the grand stand, and hand
ed out some real baseball language.
*******
Hall, the army pitcher, had fine sup
port. The infield is of minor league
caliber, and the fly-chasers are equal
ly as good.
*******
"Doc" Wayland pulled off a nice
catch in the left garden in the sec
ond inning when he snared a long
foul.
The Stanford hitters seemed to
have the habit of fanning the air
three times apiece, at certain stages
in the contest. Hall struck out eleven
men.
