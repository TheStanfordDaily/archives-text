## 
### 
Word has just been received from
the internal revenue office at San
Francisco that blanks for the federal
war tax for fraternities are not avail
able at the present time. Each fra
ternity must apply for the blanks, in
dividually, as it is against the rules
of the department to issue them
otherwise. No reply was received
from the department to letters writ
ten for blanks by the fraternities al
ready, but notice came with the
above statement that these organiza
tions must write again for their
blanks.
It was agreed at a meeting of the
fraternities some time ago that all
the blanks should be applied for
through the registrar's office, but ac
cording to the ruling sent out such a
proceeding is impossible.
Letters should be sent away within
the next few days.
