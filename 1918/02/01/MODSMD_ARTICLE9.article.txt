# MATHIEU LAUDS SOPHOMORE PLAY
## 
### 
When the Sophomore I'lay Commit
tee selected "It Pays to Advertise"
for the lit2o drama, it chose even bet
ter than it knew, in the opinion of
Coach Frank L. Mathieu. This farce
is one of the best on the market to
day, he says, mid what is mot«e, is
especially w 11 adapted to a college
cast. Practically all the characters
arc young people, and the play is
ultra-modern, thus giving college tal
ent a chance to display itself to the
best advantage.
Rehearsals have now been in prog
ress for over a week, and Mathieu is
enthusiastic over what has been ac
complished already. The principals,
both men and women, are taking hold
of their parts in a way that gives
promise of an unusual production
when they finally appear behind the
footlights, two weeks from today.

Miss Mary Largent as leading woman
is expected to show a type of acting
that will secure her a high place in
Stanford's dramatics, and Miss Mar
garet Shedd is handling the principal
other woman's part in a truly remark
able way.
J. T. Boyle, the leading man, has
shown already that lie is fully capa
ble of handling bis difficult part, while
Frank Sloman' speedy work in the
main humorous role is 011 a par with
the track endeavors which have made
bis name known all over .the coast
As the rest of the cast is fully up to
the standard set by the principals*.
"It Pavs to Advertise" is expected b,\
Coach Mathieu and all others who
have been keeping in touch with the
rehearsals to surpass any play put on
by the second-year class in re • e.ll
years.
