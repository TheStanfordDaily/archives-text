# VARSITY NINE TAKES A HARD FOUGHT GAME FROM MARINES
## STANFORD STAGES BIG COME-BACK IN WIN 3 To 1 Is Score for Contest Sailors Held to Four Hits By Lifur 
### 
Stanford c-anie back in baseball Sat
urday afternoon and handed a 3 to 1
defeat to the much-touted Marines
from Mare Island, headed by one Red
Murphy. The Varsity played like
leaguers in the field and batted the
three Marine pitchers for long hits
that resulted in enough tallies to win.
Lifur Pitches Fast Ball.
Lifud had plenty of stuff on the ball
in the pinches and, although he struck
out but one man, allowed but four hits,
two of which were bunched for the
Marines' only counter.
Both teams were scoreless in the
first three innings, then in the fourth
the Marines started the fireworks.
Hearn, the first man up, was an easy
out, but Farley picked off one to his
liking and didn't stop until he was on
third. The infield came in to stop the
runner at home, but Murphy singled
just over second and Farley walked
in. Sanderson was out, but Callan
drew a walk and Carpenter was hit,
resulting in three on with two down.
Brown, the next man up, hit one to
the left garden that looked to be a
homer, but Wayland snared it and re
tired the side.
Stanford took their turn in the fifth.
With Davis out, Galloway doubled to
left. Kline followed with a single and
Galloway came in. The Marines re
tired the next two men in easy fash
ion.
There was no more scoring until the
eighth when Stanford tallied twice.
Dickey, the first man at bat, picked
off one of Kohner's benders for a triple
to right. Knox fanned, but Wayland
doubled to right again and Dickey
came in. Campbell hit for an infield
out, but Davis hit one to Murphy, who
juggled it around long enough for
Wayland to come in. Galloway got
hit by Blake, but Kline hit to Carpen
ter for the third out.
