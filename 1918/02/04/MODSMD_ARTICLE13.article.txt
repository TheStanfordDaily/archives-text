# CALIFORNIA'S INSURMOUNTABLE DIFFICULTIES
## 
### 
It is with deep regret that the Stanford student body learns the results, or
rather, the lack of results, from the conference of intercollegiate represent
atives in San Francisco, Saturday. When analyzed, the "insurmountable dif
ficulties" which stand in the way of an agreement between the two univer
sities consist in just one thing—the "representatives" of the University of
California do not care enough about getting back the "Big Game" with Stan
ford to go half-way and play Stanford Rugby in return for Stanford playing
California American.
The unofficial excuse given for this unwillingness on the part of Cali
fornia to play Rugby, namely, that the Blue and Gold institution has not
enough athletic fields to take care of the additional team the agreement
would bring into existence, has been dealt with once before in this column.
To call this flimsy difficulty "insurmountable'' is certainly making a very
large mountain out of a most infinitesimal mole-hill. Under the suggested
arrangement, the two football seasons would not occur the same time of the
year. Even should there be other sports that might conflict, arrangements
could be made for practice at different hours of the day, or a dozen other ex
pedients could be resorted to to secure any necessary additional space for
athletics if there was any real desire on the part of California leaders to
exert their influence for the resumption of football relations with Stanford.
Thus this regrettable failure of California to cooperate, to "go half
way," is the only "insurmountable difficulty," and it is insurmountable only
as far and only as long as California makes it so. Leaders across the bay
do not seem to realize that Stanford has gone the limit in this matter and
that further concessions cannot possibly be made with the consent of the
"powers above" on this campus.
Stanford has taken the initiative at every step of the negotiations thus
far and has sacrificed point after point. Further sacrifices are impossible.
California, by her attitude at Saturday's conference, asks Stanford to give
up everything. This is utterly impossible and always will be impossible.
Stanford does not expect California to give in on every point, and California
cannot, with honor to herself, expect such unhonorable action on Stanford's
part.
By their attitude Saturday, California leaders have made further ad
vances useless and impossible on the part of Stanford. It is up to Cali
fornia, therefore, to take the next step toward renewing intercollegiate ne
gotiations.

arrangement, the two football seasons would not occur the same time of the
year. Even should there be other sports that might conflict, arrangements
could be made for practice at different hours of the day, or a dozen other ex
pedients could be resorted to to secure any necessary additional space for
athletics if there was any real desire on the part of California leaders to
exert their influence for the resumption of football relations with Stanford.
Thus this regrettable failure of California to cooperate, to "go half
way," is the only "insurmountable difficulty," and it is insurmountable only
as far and only as long as California makes it so. Leaders across the bay
do not seem to realize that Stanford has gone the limit in this matter and
that further concessions cannot possibly be made with the consent of the
"powers above" on this campus.
Stanford has taken the initiative at every step of the negotiations thus
far and has sacrificed point after point. Further sacrifices are impossible.
California, by her attitude at Saturday's conference, asks Stanford to give
up everything. This is utterly impossible and always will be impossible.
Stanford does not expect California to give in on every point, and California
cannot, with honor to herself, expect such unhonorable action on Stanford's
part.
By their attitude Saturday, California leaders have made further ad
vances useless and impossible on the part of Stanford. It is up to Cali
fornia, therefore, to take the next step toward renewing intercollegiate ne
gotiations.
