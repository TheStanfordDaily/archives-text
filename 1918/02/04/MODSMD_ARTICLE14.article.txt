# THE 						STAFF
## 
### 
Today marks the announcement of the staff of The Daily Palo Alto
for the first time this quarter. Several old names are missing as a result
of calls to war service, scholastic difficulties, and the pressure of other ac
tivities. As a result of a month of competitive tryouts, a number of new
names appear on the staff.
In ranking both old and new members of the staff, men and women are
ranked together and the women's staff is hereby abolished. The women's
staff is an institution of several years' standing on The Daily Palo Alto and
is a relic of the days when a woman reporter reached the pinnacle of her
success when she was assigned to write up the Sunday sermons. For sev
eral terms the position of women's editor has been more or less of an empty
honor. Under the present war-time conditions, with fewer men on the staff,
increased responsibilities in putting out the Daily fall to the lot of the
women on the staff, and this condition will continue for at least the dura
tion of the war. Women and men alike will be ranked according to char
acter and amount of work done and length of service on the staff.

Driscoll, '20, of Pasadena; S. P. Hollingsworth, '20, of Washington, D. C.;
