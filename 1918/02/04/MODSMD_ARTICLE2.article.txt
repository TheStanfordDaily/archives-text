# HOOVERIZATION WILL FEATURE SENIOR WEEK
## Formal Ball on Campus To Beg in Three Days of Festivities 
### 
With tlie watchword, "Condensation
and Hooverization" to feature Senior
Week activities, a complete program
of events lias been made out by the
committee in charge. An important
suggestion put forward by the mem
bers of the committee is that the com
mencement exercises and the bacca
laureate address be' held on Saturday,
June 15,* instead of on the following
Monday.
Several important changes made by
the committee are to feature the
schedule for Senior Week. The Senior
Hall will be held on the campus this
year, and it will be formal, although
elaborateness will be curtailed, in
keeping with the Senior Week watch
word. Senior Week is to begin on
Thursday night with the ball.
On Friday, June 14, Senior Day ex
ercises will be held. An Alumni-
Senior banquet will take place in the
evening, and following this a joint
prom-carnival-jolly-up will be held in
the Stanford Union. This affair will
be an innovation in Senior Day activ
ities, and it will take the place of the
former three separate functions of
which it is the aggregate.
Two dollars dues have been voted
for the Senior Class and these will be
collected from the Eighteeners some
day this week.
