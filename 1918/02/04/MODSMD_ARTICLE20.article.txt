### 
The second Wednesday tea given by j
the Resident Alumnae will be held on
Wednesday of this week, in the j
Women's Club House. A new custom
has been instituted this quarter and
the cluh will now give a program at
each meeting, followed by tea and
cakes which adhere strictly to the
Hoover requirements for food conser
vation.
Miss Catherine Harker will be the i
hostess at the next tea, and Mrs. John >
Thorne Lane of San Francisco is to
give several readings. Miss Harker
will be assisted by her mother, Mrs. |
Sarah E. Harker, and Miss, M. Smith, 1
Miss E. Crumby, and Miss Florence j
Stewart.
The money which is gained from
these teas is used to complete the Club
House and to furnish the rooms more
thoroughly. Already much of the
Club House has been finished and fur- |
tlier work is now being done.
