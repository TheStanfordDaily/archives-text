# Betty's Diamond Boots to Feature 1919 Opera Plot
## 
### 
That the 1919 Junior Opera, "Betty's
Boots," will be "a sure war anti
toxin," has been promised by the
opera committee, and the members of
Ram's Head, who are writing the opera
and who will have the staging In
charge. The opera is a snappy, up
to-date comedy, scintillating with
clever lines and bright and catchy
music.
The story of the opera deals with
the adventures of an orphan girl,
Betty Stanton, and a pair of diamond
boots which she conies to possess.
The plot is cleverly worked out and
many surprising situations are de
veloped. The opera is modern and
typically American in character. No
allusion is made to the well-worn
pirate isle, or the king's beautiful
daughter.
Ram's Head has practically com
pleted the libretto, and L. H. Davis,
'18, promises some real song hits.
The cast for "Betty's Boots" will be
announced tomorrow in The Daily
Palo Alto. Coach Davis announces
that rehearsals will begin shortly, as
the date of the opera is set for
March 7.
