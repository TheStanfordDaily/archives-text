# Freshmen vs. Varsity Swimming Events Set For Wednesday Next
## 
### 
Postponement of the varsity-fresh
man swimming meet scheduled for
Saturday last, was made necessary
by the small turnout of men, due to
the track meet and other attractions
of the day. The meet will be held on
the coming Wednesday afternoon at 4
o'clock, in the local tank.
E. S. Winham, 'J 9, is to captain the
Varsity swimming aggregation for
the coming season. J. \V. Considine,
'i'O, former captain, has not returned
to Stanford this quarter. Winham,
swimming the back-stroke, may be put
down for a few points to the Var
sity's favor in Wednesday's contest,
While Darling, freshman skipper, will
do his just share in the meet. He
manages to get through the water In
good time in the sprinta and is show
ing up well this season, Coonse and
Greene are among the Varsity's best
bets in the races, and Canelo in the
plunge for distance. Newman for the
freshmen shows up well in the latter
