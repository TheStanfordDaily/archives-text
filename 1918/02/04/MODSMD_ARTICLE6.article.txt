# CALIFORNIA STANFORD SPLIT IS WIDENED AT SATURDAY CONFERENCE
## 
### 
"Insurmountable difficulties" stand in
the way of California and Stanford re
suming athletic relations, according to
an announcement given out by the con
ference gathered at the Palace Hotel
in San Francisco last Saturday. As a
result California cannot play Rugby
football, so they rejected the peace
terms offered by the Cardinal repre
sentatives.
Official Statement
Following is the statement given
out by the conference:
"At an informal gathering of
men interested in athletics at the
University of California and Stan
ford University, the question of
the possibility of a resumption of
football relations was discussed.
"The suggestion that the two
universities should meet both in
Rugby and American football
seemed to offer difficulties which
were deemed at present insur
mountable, and it was decided
that under existing conditions
nothing could be gained by ar
ranging for a joint meeting of
those in control of athletics in the
two institutions for a further dis
cussion of the matter."
The statement was signed by Pro
fessor H. M. Stevens, M. C. Lynch,

and J. L. Reith for the University of
California and Professor A. T. Murray,
R. W. Barrett, and O. M. Sullivan for
Stanford.
Professor Murray was the Stanford
representative in place of Dr. Frank
Angell.
A further explanation of the confer
ence was given out by Professor Mur
ray to the Daily Palo Alto today in an
endeavor to clear up doubts as to the
character of the meeting in San Fran
cisco.
Judging from the two statements
Stanford and California are further
apart 011 the football question than
ever before.
Following is Professor Murray's
statement:
"I have been asked to make a
statement regarding the informal
conference held last Saturday to
discuss the football situation. It
is implied by this request that the
statement given to the press over
the signatures of those present at
the conference is colorless. This
may be true; but-it represents ex
actly the conclusions reached at
that time.
"We met for luncheon at the
Palace Hotel, had a good time to
gether, and a pleasant chat, and
then talked over the football situ
ation pretty thoroughly from vari
ous angles. There was none of
the heated discussion of which an
evening paper spoke; there was
no thought of any desire 011 the
part of either institution to get
the better of the other; we simply
found that as the athletic policies
and the athletic organizations of
the two institutions are radically
different, it was not easy to dis
cover a common basis for action;
and as both institutions are dis
posed, naturally enough, to main
tain their present policies, and loy
ally to meet their present obliga
tions, the outcome amounts to
this: we shall continue to play
Rugby and California the Amer
can game. The project of meet
ing in both games seemed to those
present at the conference to be
impracticable.

posed, naturally enough, to main
tain their present policies, and loy
ally to meet their present obliga
tions, the outcome amounts to
this: we shall continue to play
Rugby and California the Amer
can game. The project of meet
ing in both games seemed to those
present at the conference to be
impracticable.

"Insurmountable difficulties" stand in
the way of California and Stanford re
suming athletic relations, according to
an announcement given out by the con
ference gathered at the Palace Hotel
in San Francisco last Saturday. As a
result California cannot play Rugby
football, so they rejected the peace
terms offered by the Cardinal repre
sentatives.
Official Statement
Following is the statement given
out by the conference:
"At an informal gathering of
men interested in athletics at the
University of California and Stan
ford University, the question of
the possibility of a resumption of
football relations was discussed.
"The suggestion that the two
universities should meet both in
Rugby and American football
seemed to offer difficulties which
were deemed at present insur
mountable, and it was decided
that under existing conditions
nothing could be gained by ar
ranging for a joint meeting of
those in control of athletics in the
two institutions for a further dis
cussion of the matter."
The statement was signed by Pro
fessor H. M. Stevens, M. C. Lynch,

and J. L. Reith for the University of
California and Professor A. T. Murray,
R. W. Barrett, and O. M. Sullivan for
Stanford.
Professor Murray was the Stanford
representative in place of Dr. Frank
Angell.
A further explanation of the confer
ence was given out by Professor Mur
ray to the Daily Palo Alto today in an
endeavor to clear up doubts as to the
character of the meeting in San Fran
cisco.
Judging from the two statements
Stanford and California are further
apart 011 the football question than
ever before.
Following is Professor Murray's
statement:
"I have been asked to make a
statement regarding the informal
conference held last Saturday to
discuss the football situation. It
is implied by this request that the
statement given to the press over
the signatures of those present at
the conference is colorless. This
may be true; but-it represents ex
actly the conclusions reached at
that time.
"We met for luncheon at the
Palace Hotel, had a good time to
gether, and a pleasant chat, and
then talked over the football situ
ation pretty thoroughly from vari
ous angles. There was none of
the heated discussion of which an
evening paper spoke; there was
no thought of any desire 011 the
part of either institution to get
the better of the other; we simply
found that as the athletic policies
and the athletic organizations of
the two institutions are radically
different, it was not easy to dis
cover a common basis for action;
and as both institutions are dis
posed, naturally enough, to main
tain their present policies, and loy
ally to meet their present obliga
tions, the outcome amounts to
this: we shall continue to play
Rugby and California the Amer
can game. The project of meet
