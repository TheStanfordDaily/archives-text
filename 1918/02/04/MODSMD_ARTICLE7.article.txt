# New Dormitory Near Completion
## 
### 
"In six weeks construction work on
the new dormitory for women will be
completed," according to G. H. Mc-
Lacblan, superintendent in charge.
"The plastering will be finished in a
very short time, both inside and out."
The new dormitory is thoroughly
modern and has many advantages over
the old one.
The outside walls have a pinkish
plaster finish. There are now three
wings and later another is to be ad
ded. The two wings on the west are
connected by a small, narrow, per
manent passage-way. It is to the west
wing that the other is to be built
whenever more room is needed.
New Type of Plastering.
Around the front entrance and on
the pillars at each side of the door is
sgraflto work. This work also orna
ments the balconied window in each
wing. Sgrafito decoration is some
thing new in plaster work and that
on the new Roble domitory is the first
on the Pacific coast.
The front door opens into a living
room, at the back of which is a large
fireplace. At each end of the living
room a door opens to a small recep
tion room. The two large oblong din

ing rooms project out on the sunny
side of the building. Their roofs are
tiled so that they may be used for a
promenade.
Kitchenettes for Women's Use.
Each wing has a kitchenette solely
for the use of the women. On one
side of the wings are suites, while the
rooms across the corridors from them
are single. The suites consist of two
small bedrooms, with clothes-closets
and a study-room. The woodwork of
the rooms is stained gray and the
walls are to be tinted a grayish white.
The floors of the rooms are to be oil
finished. Every floor has a white tiled
bathroom with a number of showers.
Sewing Koom and Library.
There is a single sewing room and
a library in the new hall. The sewing
room is on the first floor and is equip
ped with electricity for ironing or
machine work.
One of the most interesting features
of the dormitory is the reinforced
concrete stairways which will serve as
fire-escapes in case of fire. They lead
from the third to the first floor. The
stairs and the walls surrounding them
are concrete and so are absolutely fire
proof.
