# TRACK MEN DEMONSTRATE WARES
## 
### 
At an informal meet held on the
oval Saturday morning, Cardinal track
men demonstrated their wares to the
approval of volunteer coaches, cap
tain, and onlookers. Despite the
threatening weather conditions quite
a number of the track squad were on
hand to indulge in the first competi
tion of the season. The track events
were run over shortened distances
and no times were announced.
The hundred yard dash was prob
ably the best race of the meet and
was won by Davis, '20, who showed
excellent form for this early time of
the season. Falk, '21, a member of
the freshman football squad last fall,
took second in the century event and
was followed closely by Dinkelspiel,
'20.
Maynard, '20, showed good form by
taking first in the 352 yard event and
was crowded by Wright, '21, who took
second. The possibility of develop

ing something new in the hurdles was
demonstrated by the way that Rogers,
'21, cleared the sticks. Reynolds, '21,
likewise appeared to good form in this
event.
John Wilkie, '20, ran well in the 660
and easily took that event. Art Mc-
Pherson, '18, won the mile event, run
over an 1100 yard course, without ex
erting a great deal of effort.
Hargrove, '18, House, '19, and
Green, '21, starred in the field events.
The latter cleared the bar in the pole
vault at (he height of 11 feet 6 inches,
Hargrove high jumped 5 feet 8
inches and House covered a distance
of 21 feet 4 inches in the broad jump.

lows :
Mile run—McPherson, '18, first; Al
bouze, '20, second; Sharp, '21, third;
