# VARSITY QUINTET WINS SLOW GAME FROM DAVIS FARM
## BOTH TEAMS OFF COLOR SCORE IS 18-9 Butt Plays Consistently for Stanford—Harper Is Best Davis Man 
### 
In the poorest exhibition soon this
year the Varsity won from the Davis
Farm School at basketball on Encina
court, Saturday. Both teams were so
far off color that, although there was
an opportunity to score most of the
time, only an 3 8 to 9 count was rolled
up. Before the game was over it re
sembled football rather than basket
ball.
Hutt Stars.
Butt at guard was the only man 011
either team that handled the ball with
any consistency. He broke up possible
scores for the Davis team time after
time when the remainder of the Stan
ford team was asleep at the post.
Hood and Moulton both missed shots
from the forward positions when they
had a good chance to count, while the
centers, Schwarzenbek and William
son, were equally as bad.
During the first ten minutes of the
game neither team shot a basket or a
foul. Then the play loosened up some
and as a result the count was 10 to 6
at the end of the period.
The second half opened as badly as
the first, with twelve minutes passing
before either five threw the ball in the
basket. The Varsity played a little
better game this period than the first
and held their opponents to one bas
ket while they were shooting four.
Harper, at center, was the best man
on the Davis combination. Two of his
three baskets were spectacular shots
from the middle of the floor.
