# FRESHMAN BASEBALL LOOKS TO BE FAST
## SCHOFIELD IS THE COACH Biggest Difficulty Is Lack of Heavers on Squad; Infield Strong 
### 
Coach Schofleld is authority that
Stanford will have the best freshman
baseball team in years after the men
have become organized. There are
thirty-seven men on the squad and as
a result there is competition for
places that is forcing every man to
put his best into the game.
The biggest weakness is in the
pitching department. The best man
at present is Gillis, with Van Cliff,
Fairchild, Bills, and Criss close on his
heels.
The catcher's department is strong,
with Repath and Filley. The infield
is the biggest asset to the squad, how
ever. At first Kline and Tuebner,
both left-handers, are fighting it out
with the advantage even so far. On
second Burkes has the advantage at
present. Iseri, a former all South
America Japanese player, is putting
up a hard fight for the keystone po
sition, also.
Kallum has things his own way on
short. He is a former San Diego play
er and held the all-southern position
last season in prep schools.
Kinney, Smith, and Rutledge are
fighting hard for third, with the ad
vantage on Kinney. In the gardens,
Reynolds, Rutledge and Parker have
the pole, Reynolds in center. Parker
in right and Rutledge in left.
Coach Schofield has several fast
teams lined up to oppose the first.-
vear men before the California series.
In addition to Palo Alto High School
and Manzanita, San Jose. San Mateo,
High School of Commerce and Oak
land Technical High School are slated
for appearance here.
