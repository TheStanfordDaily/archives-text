# CHANGING COMMENCEMENT DAY
## 
### 
A suggestion has been made by the 1918 Senior Week Committee that
is worthy of most careful consideration on the part of the academic "powers
that be." The Senior Week Committee has outlined this year a most sen
sibly concentrated program for the final festivities of the graduating class.
This program conforms to the war-time need for "Hooverization" of ex
pense and time and at the same time should by its very compactness prove
a success.
This year, as never before, there will be a tendency for the students
who remain in the University at that time —graduates just as much as the
members of the three lower classes —to leave the campus shortly after the
last final examination paper is finished at the end of the spring quarter.
Those who are holding out to complete their four-year course and win the
long-desired "sheepskin A. B." will, many of them, feel the stern call of
duty to delay no longer in entering some branch of the United States ser
vice, and there will be many other valid reasons which will hurry the would
be graduates and other students away from Quad and Farm.
Senior Week ends Friday night. The present schedule calls for Com
mencement on the following Monday morning. In view of the exceptional
conditions in the present war times this extra delay seems unjustifiable.
With a much smaller number of records to compile, the faculty should be
able to decide who is eligible to graduate and who is not in time to pass
out the diplomas to those who have earned them on Saturday. As far as
concerns the baccalaureate address, there would be nothing inappropriate
in having it come on Saturday as part of the Commencement exercises. It
might come in the morning and the rest of the graduating formalities in the
afternoon. Alumni Day could well be combined with Senior Day on Fri
day with the joint banquet in the evening.
It appears that it would be to the best interests of success in the final
exercises of the Class of 1918 for Commencement Day to be moved up
from Monday, June 17, to Saturday, June 15. May we respectfully suggest
arrangements for this change to be made by the faculty committee on pub
lic exercises.
