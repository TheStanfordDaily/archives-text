# FRESHMEN TO SWIM AGAINST VARSITY
## ENCINA TANK IS SCENE Meet Scheduled To Be Held Tomorrow Afternoon at 4:30 
### 
Varsity swimmers meet the fresh
man water Italics tomorrow afternoon
at 4 o'clock, in the second meet of the
season. A live contest is promised
from the showing that the 1921 tank
sters have been putting up this year,
and the Varsity will undoubtedly he
furnished with some keen competition.
A considerable amount of thrill
should be evolved from the relay
e vent of tomorrow's content, in which
the Darling-Campbell-Lacey-Patrick
combination of the freshmen will op
pose the Varsity's Nagel-Swift-Stew
art-Flood aggregation. The sprints
are the freshmen's strong points, with
Darling, 19-1 captain, Campbell, and
I acey in the running, while the Var
sity bids highest in the breast-stroke,
back-stroke, plunge-for-distance, and
diving events.
Tomorrow's meet is to be the first
of mi active program of contests which
will lead up to the big event with
California in the middle of March.
The freshmen will meet the Blue and
Gold babes on the same day as the
Varsities stage their carnival. Stan
ford's freshman water-hopes will
splash against the Concordia Club
swimmers of San Francisco as next
Saturday's attraction. This meet will
begin at 3 p.m. On the following Sat
urday, February 16, the aviators from
Berkeley living school will journey
down to tangle with the local Varsity.
At this time, Norman Ross, ex-'2O,
will try for a world's record in the
half-mile, in the local tank.
