# EX-STANFORD WOMAN CAUGHT MASQUERADING
## 
### 
Dr. Allen Hart, a young interne at
the San Francisco Hospital, has been
discovered as Miss A. Lucile Hart, a
former Stanford student and a grad
uate of the University of Oregon, ac
cording to the word of Dr. Robert A.
Jones, resident physician of the hos
pital, who last night announced the
sudden departure of the interne. The
disclosure came upon the recognition
of Dr. Hart as the girl student at
Stanford when a few days before the
disappearance the interne applied for
a laboratory position at Lane Hos
pital.
"Dr." Hart since December had
played so successfully the role of male
that a fellow roommate interne, as
well as many other associates at the
hospital, were astounded when devel
opments revealed the dual personal
ity.
Dr. Jones, in commenting on the sit
uation last night, said:
" 'Dr.' Hart was a bit effeminate, but
that did not arouse our suspicions.
'He' went about just as any of the
internes did. There was not the
slightest question about 'him' until
we learned from outside sources that
'he' had been a Stanford woman. On
the walls of 'his' room 'Dr.' Hart had
a photograph of 'his' 'wife.' 'He'
smoked cigarettes, drank whisky and
otherwise seemed grown to man's
estate."
