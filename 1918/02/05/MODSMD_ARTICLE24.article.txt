# MOON TO DIM LIGHT OF SUN ON JUNE 8
## SHADOW WILL COVER SIXTY-MILE STRIP FROM WASHINGTON TO THE ATLANTIC 
### 
Oil Jane 8, 1918, the leading sci
entists of the country will seek the
Rocky mountains for observations to
be taken of the total eclipse of the
sun which is to cover a strip sixty
miles in width across this continent.
Not until August 21, 2017, will there
again be a total eclipse of the sun so
widely visible in the United States
as this. The territory which it will
cover will be easily located by taking
one of the Union Pacific's new mili
tary maps of the United States, and
starting a line at South Bend, Wash
ington, crossing the Columbia river
near Arlington and running through
Baker City, Oregon, Hailey and Po
catello, Idaho, Green River, Wyoming,
Denver, Colorado, Enid, Oklahoma,
crossing the Mississippi river at Glen
Allen, and reaching the Atlantic ocean
at Eau Gallie, Florida, the center of
the sixty-mile strip.
A party from the Yerkes Observa
tory of the University of Chicago
have arranged to take observations at
Denver, but to protect their interests
will establish another party at Green
River, Wyoming, Dean Howe claim
ing the altitude of the Rocky moun
tain region to be particularly favor
able against the moisture in the air
and the low altitudes of the Pacific
coast and east of Colorado, and look
upon this as the most favorable op
portunity that has ever been given
for scientific observations.
Two hours and fifteen minutes will
elapse from the time the moon first
intervenes between the sun and the
earth, and the sun will be totally ob
scured for a period of 88.7 seconds.
The following are the total eclipses
of the sun that have occurred and will
occur during the nineteenth and twen
tieth centuries:
June 16, 1806, California to Massa
chusetts.
November 30, 1834, Montana to
South Carolina.
August 7, 1869, Montana to North
Carolina.
July 29, 1878, Washington to Texas.
January 11, 1880, California to Utah.
January 1, 1889, California to North
Dakota.
May 28, 1900, Louisiana to Virginia.
June 8, 1918, Washington to Florida.
September 10, 1923, California to
Arizona.
January 24, 1925, Minnesota to
Massachusetts.
July 9, 1945, Idaho and Montana.
June 30, 1954, Nebraska to Michi
gan.
March 7, 1970, Florida.
February 26, 1979, Extreme north
western part of the United States.
As will be noticed from the above
list there have been very few oppor
tunities before that would permit
many to witness a total eclipse of the
sun and under such favorable condi
tions as the coming one.
The U. S. Naval Observatory of the
Navy Department, Washington, has
issued an interesting supplement to
the American Ephemeris for 1918, giv
ing valuable tables and charts rela
tive to this eclipse of June 8, 1918.

the American Ephemeris for 1918, giv
ing valuable tables and charts rela
tive to this eclipse of June 8, 1918.
Oil Jane 8, 1918, the leading sci
entists of the country will seek the
Rocky mountains for observations to
be taken of the total eclipse of the
sun which is to cover a strip sixty
miles in width across this continent.
Not until August 21, 2017, will there
again be a total eclipse of the sun so
widely visible in the United States
as this. The territory which it will
cover will be easily located by taking
one of the Union Pacific's new mili
tary maps of the United States, and
starting a line at South Bend, Wash
ington, crossing the Columbia river
near Arlington and running through
Baker City, Oregon, Hailey and Po
catello, Idaho, Green River, Wyoming,
Denver, Colorado, Enid, Oklahoma,
crossing the Mississippi river at Glen
Allen, and reaching the Atlantic ocean
at Eau Gallie, Florida, the center of
the sixty-mile strip.
A party from the Yerkes Observa
tory of the University of Chicago
have arranged to take observations at
Denver, but to protect their interests
will establish another party at Green
River, Wyoming, Dean Howe claim
ing the altitude of the Rocky moun
tain region to be particularly favor
able against the moisture in the air
and the low altitudes of the Pacific
coast and east of Colorado, and look
upon this as the most favorable op
portunity that has ever been given
for scientific observations.
Two hours and fifteen minutes will
elapse from the time the moon first
intervenes between the sun and the
earth, and the sun will be totally ob
scured for a period of 88.7 seconds.
The following are the total eclipses
of the sun that have occurred and will
occur during the nineteenth and twen
tieth centuries:
June 16, 1806, California to Massa
chusetts.
November 30, 1834, Montana to
South Carolina.
August 7, 1869, Montana to North
Carolina.
July 29, 1878, Washington to Texas.
January 11, 1880, California to Utah.
January 1, 1889, California to North
Dakota.
May 28, 1900, Louisiana to Virginia.
June 8, 1918, Washington to Florida.
September 10, 1923, California to
Arizona.
January 24, 1925, Minnesota to
Massachusetts.
July 9, 1945, Idaho and Montana.
June 30, 1954, Nebraska to Michi
gan.
March 7, 1970, Florida.
February 26, 1979, Extreme north
western part of the United States.
As will be noticed from the above
list there have been very few oppor
tunities before that would permit
many to witness a total eclipse of the
sun and under such favorable condi
tions as the coming one.

Navy Department, Washington, has
