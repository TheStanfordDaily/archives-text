# EXPLAINS USE OF SERVICE EMBLEMS
## STARS SHOULD ONLY REPRESENT MEN IN UNIFORM SAYS OFFICIAL ITEM 
### 
The significance and use of service
flags has just been defined by the
Official Bulletin, in Washington, D. C.,
under the direction of President Wil
son and the Committee on Public In
formation. The item is as follows:
"The service flag, while not offi
cially adopted, is authorized and re
cognized, and every one who is en
titled to fly it is encouraged, and
urged to do so.
"The idea of the service flag is that !
there shall be a star to represent each
person from the family, place of busi
ness, club, or other entity serving
with the colors. There has recently
been some indication that this is be
ing abused. Where the service flag
is hung in the window of a home it
should represent only members of the
family from such immediate house
hold and not employees, domestic or
otherwise. Where it is hung from a
place of business it should represent
employees going from such place of
business, and where, presumably,
some continuous relation exists and
there is an expectation of return to
the employment. The service flag
should not be flown by buildings, ho
tels, etc., where the only relation is
that of tenants, etc., but only where
there is some closer relation as indi
cated above.
"Attention has been called to the
fact that recently service flags have
been flown where the persons repre
sented are but in various civilian ca
pacities. However patriotic the mo
tives of these persons may be, they
are not entitled to be represented by
the service flag, and such use is an
abuse of it. The essence of military
service is that persons who wear the
uniform subject themselves to be or
dered anywhere without the right to
refuse to go. Such conditions do not
attach to any of the various war
boards, commissions, civilian employ
ments, etc., and under no circum
stances should the persons in such
employments be represented on serv
ice flags. Surely, 110 one who desires
only honest credit for what he is do
ing would desire to deprive those sub
ject to military orders of the credit
which should go to them because of
that fact."
Major Nathan William MacChesney,
department judge advocate, central
department, Chicago, is the writer of

with the colors. There has recently
been some indication that this is be
ing abused. Where the service flag
is hung in the window of a home it
should represent only members of the
family from such immediate house
hold and not employees, domestic or
otherwise. Where it is hung from a
place of business it should represent
employees going from such place of
business, and where, presumably,
some continuous relation exists and
there is an expectation of return to
the employment. The service flag
should not be flown by buildings, ho
tels, etc., where the only relation is
that of tenants, etc., but only where
there is some closer relation as indi
cated above.
"Attention has been called to the
fact that recently service flags have
been flown where the persons repre
sented are but in various civilian ca
pacities. However patriotic the mo
tives of these persons may be, they
are not entitled to be represented by
the service flag, and such use is an
abuse of it. The essence of military
service is that persons who wear the
uniform subject themselves to be or
dered anywhere without the right to
refuse to go. Such conditions do not
attach to any of the various war
boards, commissions, civilian employ
ments, etc., and under no circum
stances should the persons in such
employments be represented on serv
ice flags. Surely, 110 one who desires
only honest credit for what he is do
ing would desire to deprive those sub
ject to military orders of the credit
which should go to them because of
that fact."
