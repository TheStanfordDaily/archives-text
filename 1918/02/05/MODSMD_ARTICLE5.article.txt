down the line in a 7 to 0 defeat last
Wednesday, but after its showing
Monday the Cardinal nine should be
able to come back.
Harvey or Briggs to Pit<Jh.
Either Harvey or Briggs will be on
the mound for Stanford, Will Hall
acting as toastmaster for the Fremont
men. Under the guidance of Captain
Lilly and "Doc" Lifur, the two Stan
ford twirlers have developed some
stuff in the last week and should be
able to give the visitors a little bat
tle for their trip over. Hall has now
passed the mystery stage for the Stan
ford hitters and should not be able to
hold the Varsity down so well.

collected at the gate for non-student
body members, while 15 cents will
pass members with their cards.
