# BABES TO MEET CALIFORNIA
## Freshman Basket Ball Starts Tomorrow 
### 
Stanford and California first-year
men will try their hand against each
other in basketball tomorrow night on
Eneina court in the first of a two-game
series. Coach Wilson and Captain
Sullivan will announce the men who
are to start the game for the Cardinal
tomorrow afternoon, and meanwhile
California is waiting to hand a white
wash to the Stanford babes.
The Blue and Gold has one of the
best first-year combinations that has
represented the university for years.
Practically all of the bay high schools
have been handed serious defeats by
the California babes and the dopesters
"over there" expect their team to keep
up its record in the game tomorrow.
Manager Sullivan has secured the
services of Lieutenant Klawans to
handle the whistle in the game.
Klawans has refereed several games
on the Cardinal court this year and in
addition was football referee for some
of the big football games last season.

He should put an extra shake of "jazz"
into the play tomorrow.
The game will start promptly at 8
o'clock, according to announcement,
and one-fourth of a dollar will be re
quired for admission lo the fray.
Stanford's freshman team is an un
known quantity. Seaman, Phelps,
Lacey, Fairchilds, Swanholm, Harris,
and two or three other men have been
showing ui) well in practice games, but
Coach Wilson has not used any one
combination together for any length
of time throughout the season. Partly
as a result of this there is a noticeable
lack of team-work on the part of the
babes and should California win it
will in all probability be due to this
fact.
The combination that will be se
lected by the coach to start the game
tomorrow is still an unknown quan
tity. Seaman is the only man who is
at all sure and he may be sent in for
one of the forwards instead of center,
his usual position.
