# Y.M. AND Y.M.C.A. WILL HOLD JOINT CONFERENCE HERE
## 
### 
The launching of a new campaign
here at Stanford by the combined Y.
J M.and Y. W. C. A., was decided upon
at a conference held at San Anselmo
over the week-end. The purpose of
I the conference was to form plans for
I starting study classes of Christian
I Principles in colleges, and was a re
i suit of the Northfield conference held
j during the first week in January, at
which delegates from all over the
United States were present. One hun
dred delegates, representing the Y. M.
and Y. W. C. A.'s of all normal schools
and colleges of northern California,
were present. The Stanford delegates
were It. G. Ground, '20, J. L. Vincenz,
'IS, P. S. Williams, '19, Miss Frances
Willis, and Mrs. C. E. Niebel.
The enrollment of two thousand stu
dents, which is 50 per cent of the total
number of students in the United
States and Canada, is to be striven for.
j At a later date these other things are
to be attempted, first, to get more
I men to accept Christian principles;
! second, to raise $500,000 to carry out
the work; and, third, to raise more
recruits for religious work. The Uni
versity of California has set two
thirds of her student body, 1,200 men
and 1,800 women, as her goal, and
( Stanford has accepted a goal of 300
| men and 250 women.
The Y. M. C. A. cabinet will meet
tomorrow night to launch the cam
paign on the campus, following the
same course. Every man and woman
in the University will lip asked to
join. Leaders will be chosen from the
students and faculty and they are to
trained thoroughly before commencing
their duties. The courses offered are
as follows: (1) Dible study; (2) mis
sion study; (3) social science prob
lems. Three different divisions for
carrying on the work will be estab
lished: the Bible classes of Palo Alto,
Memorial Church, and a personal
group on the campus.
! The movement is an international
one, and is the biggest thing attempted
by the Y. M. C. A. since the war drive.
