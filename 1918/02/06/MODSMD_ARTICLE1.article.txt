# COMPANY A IS LEADING UNIT IN R.O.T.C. COMPETITION
## WINS BY SAFE MARGIN Some Companies Not Up to Standard in Bearing and Appearance 
### 
Company A, under the command of
Captain J. T. Wood, Jr., '18, yesterday
won first place in the competition held
to decide the best drilling company in
the R. O. T. C.. As a result of supe
riority over the other companies of
the corps, Company A will have the
honor of being color company and will
be entitled to carry the colors in re
views and parades in battalion forma
tion. The relative standing of the
companies was: Company A, Com
pany F, Company B, Company D, Com-
C, Company E.
Captain Volkmar stated today that
he was well pleased with the showing
made by the corps as a whole and be
lieves that it is up to the height of
standard that should be expected of
the men at this time of the quarter.
Competitive drills between the com
panies will be held two or three times
a quarter in order to give the com
panies a chance to improve their
standing. Battalion drill is now held
regularly by the afternoon companies
and will be held by the morning com
panies in the near future when Com
pany E is to be divided into Companies
E and G. That company is now much
larger than a regulation R. O. T. C.
company and the division will take
place as soon as the competition for
company commanders of the morning
companies has been completed.
The lower standing of some of the
companies in yesterday's competition
was due to their poor military bearing
and the condition of their equipment.
In meeting the drill tests there is but
little more than than 10 per cent vari
ance between the first and last com
panies. Drill tests counted 70 per cent
and bearing and equipment made up
the remaining 30 per cent of the total
points required for a perfect score.
The standing of the companies fol
lows :
Company A, Captain Wood, 88 per
cent; Company F, Captain Thompson,
85.5 per cent; Company B, Captain
Yates, 82 per cent; Company D, Cap
tain More, 80 per cent; Company C,
Captain Stewart, 78 per cent; Com
pany E, commander not yet selected,
71 per cent.
