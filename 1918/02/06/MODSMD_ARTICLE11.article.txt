# COACH ANNOUNCES PLAYERS TO START
## WILL BATTLE TONIGHT Ormsby, Fairchilds, Seaman, Phelps, and Swanholm In Lineup 
### 
Coach Wilson and Captain Sullivan
this afternoon gave out the names of
the freshmen who are to start against
California tonight in the first of a two
game basketball series. The contest
will begin promptly at 8 o'clock in
Encina gymnasium and a twenty-five
cents charge is to be made. Student
body tickets do not reduce the price
at the gate since this is an intercol
legiate game.
Lineup Announced.
The lineup for the game is as fol
lows: Ormsby and Fairchilds, for
wards; Seaman, center; Phelps and
Swanholm, guards. Lacey, originally
scheduled for a position on the team,
was taken to the hospital with measles
today and so cannot play.
California Is Strong.
The California team has not been
definitely chosen, but from reports any
five men that may be selected from
the Blue and Gold squad will be able
to put up a fast game of basketball.
If the Cardinal first-year players
can put a semblance of team-work
into their play tonight they should be
able to give the transbay hoop artists
a battle for the top score. Fairchilds
and Ormsby are clever shots, while
Seaman is a good man. The two
guards look to be the strongest part
of the team. There is a tendency,
however, to dribble 011 the part of the
babes that will prove disastrous
against a fast team. If the men begin
a passing game tonight they should
come out on the long end of the score.
Lieutenant Klawans, from Camp
Fremont, will handle the whistle in
the game.
