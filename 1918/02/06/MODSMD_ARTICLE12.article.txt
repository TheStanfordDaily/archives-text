ford Art Museum, and will be in place

Among prominent American artists
to be influenced by Japanese art was
Whistler, who first made a modified
form of Japanese prints popular with
the American public. Later the
French took it up and collecting prints
became a fad. Fennelesa is another
American who has studied the art and
written books upon it.and the teach
itig of Arthur Dow of the University
of Columbia has greatly influenced
this kind of work in American art cir
cles.
Old Japanese prints, however, are
now a thing of the past. The few con
tained in collections are invaluable,
as the older work has become a lost
art through the westernizing factors
which have little by little pervaded the
old methods.
New exhibits are planned for each
month through June. During March
a California collection of wild flower
paintings will be installed and later
an exhibit from the National Acad
emy of Design of New York, which
will contain examples of the best
work executed in New York during
the last few years. This academy corn
pares with the Salon of Paris and the
National Galleries of London, and
paintings taken from its walls set the
standard of American art.
