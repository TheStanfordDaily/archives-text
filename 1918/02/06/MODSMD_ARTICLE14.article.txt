# FRESHMEN VS. CALIFORNIA TONIGHT
## 
### 
First competition of the spring season with our ancient enemy, the Uni
versity of California, conies tonight, when Stanford's freshman basketball
team meets the first-year hopes of the Blue and Gold on the Encina gym
floor. The California babes a-e reputed to be a speedy bunch or basket
tossers and hence the Cardinal freshmen will ha\e to put up a strong fight
in order to carry away first honors. It is up to the students, both men and
women, to turn out at tonight's game in larger numbers than at any pre
vious contest this season. Every student should get behind the freshman
basketball team in this their first contest with California. Here is one eve
ning when library and movies can spare their respective habitues for at
least an hour.
Attendance at all the basketball contests and also at the baseball games
this quarter has been pitiful and could stand a great deal of improvement.
Stanford lias some good varsity and rreshman teams this year in both spring
sports, and the "fans" are missing some good exhibitions. Incidentally the
teams are not getting the whole-hearted support they should be receiving
from the students, both men and women.
