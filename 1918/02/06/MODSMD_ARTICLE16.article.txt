# RIVETING BEGINS SOON ON LIBRARY
## GRADING HAS STARTED AROUND WILBUR HOME AND ROAD CUT TO NEW ROBLE 
### 
All the steel for the new Thomas
Welton Stanford Library is now on
the campus. The work of setting it
up will be completed in a few days
and the riveting will begin.
The slope around the new presi
dential home is now being graded and
soon shrubs and trees will be planted
around the hill. The ground will be
terraced in a gradual slope to the road.
Grading is also being done on a
road which will cut off from the main
road to the new women's dormitory
and run entirely around the building.
A large garden will fill in the space
between the wings and will probably
be fenced in and screened from view
to insure privacy.
