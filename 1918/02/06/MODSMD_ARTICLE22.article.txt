The University of California exten
sion division has announced two new
courses in French to start in San
Francisco. The classes will be taught
by Mile. Euphrasie Molle, who was
educated in southern France, and
taught in French schools before she
came to America.
Classes in certain courses of the
College of the City of New York have
been opened for the first time to
women who present the necessary
credentials. They are permitted to
register on and after January 28 for
evening classes which open February
13. Women will also be admitted to
summer classes. The immediate rea
son for this departure from former
rulings is that a number of Brooklyn
women vainly attempted to register
last term, and that about five hundred
have been doing all the work in
the courses offered in spite of the fact
that they will receive no credit for
same."

maintenance of army and navy can
