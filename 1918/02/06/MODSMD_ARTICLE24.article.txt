# MUSEUM DISPLAYS WEAPONS OF INDIA AND THE CRUSADES
## 
### 
Curious sacrificial knives used in
India, hunting knives, and swords
dating back 160 years, with several
English and German crossbows of the
15th and lGth centuries, form the
unusual exhibit now being prepared
at the Museum. This collection,
which Mrs. Stanford made at Jaiper,
India, in 1903, has not been exhibited
since the earthquake.
The Indian knives used in sacrifice
differ for various animals. The snake
swords, strongly curved, which were
used in the worship, are carved and
inlaid with gold, and iron hatchets,
ornamented with silver and brass,
were used for splitting the goat's head.
The cubries, used in sacrificing sheep,
differ in size and ornamentation for
men and women. The "devil driver"
is a three-edged dagger which the
natives of Thibet thrust in the ground
to drive away evil spirits.
The hunting knives are made for
both men and women, often conceal
ing a third blade which is revealed by
pressing the handle, thus forcing the
two others apart. The third blade
makes the wound deeper, while the
two others, pushing apart, widen it.
These were used in tiger hunting.
A helmet, shield, and vambrace of
the finest Damascus steel, inlaid with
gold, come from Ispahan, Persia. No
data has been secured concerning
them but they are thought to be a relic
of the Crusades.
A special hair knife is shown which
was used by a band of robbers to cut
the hair of their victims. This hair
was then sold, and brought a large
sum, for hair was an expensive trading
article.
Three German crossbows and one
English, show the sharp distinction
between warfare of the 15th and 16th
centuries and the present time. With
these is shown a canteen of the 15th
century, of German silver, found near
Wittenberg, Germany.
An Egyptian exhibit'is being plan
ned now and data is being secured.
This will be ready for the public in a
few weeks.
