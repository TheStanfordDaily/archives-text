# "It Pays to Advertise" Is Self – Advertising But They Are Advertising it Anyhow
##

Advertising wouldn't be necessary
for"It Pays to Advertise" if Stanford
people knew more about the play, for
they would fight to get in without any
inducement. This is the opinion of
Coach Mathieu, who is now engaged
every night in rounding the sophomore
production into shape, and developing
the talents of the second-year actors
and actresses.
However, the play proves that suf
ficient advertising will cause even a
soap trust to rub its eyes, and the 19JO
play committee is living up to the the
atrical philosophy as evidenced by the
posters now displayed about the cam
pus. These proclaim the drawing and
seat sale for the sophomore produc
tion for next Friday noon at the; Book
store and Weingartner's in Palo Alto.
The show itself will be staged Feb
ruary 15, a week from Friday.
"It Pays to Advertise" has enjoyed
one of the longest runs on Broadway
of recent years, and has met with uni
versal success wherever it lias ap
peared. The reason for this, accord
ing to eastern critics, is that it is a
grouch dispeller of undiluted strength,
and has a genuine plot as well.
Main interest in the play centeis
about the attempt of Cyrus Martin (E.
P. Harper), soap magnate extraordin
ary, to make a man out of his son
Rodney (J. T. Boyle). Son Rodney
previous to the attempt has done little
but spend his allowance —not even in
riotous living—just living. His father
persuades his private secretary
(Mary Largent) to lend her
energies to this purpose. Aided
by Ambrose Peale (Frank Sloman),
an inspired theatrical press agent, Mar
tin Jr. and the secretary start out to
buck Martin Sr.'s soap trust. llow
they come out is another story.
