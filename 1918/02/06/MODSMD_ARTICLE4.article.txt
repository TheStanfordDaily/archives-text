# MORE HOOVER DAYS MUST BE OBSERVED
## 
### 
Latest news from the Food Con
servation headquarters specifies the ex
act kinds of food which may be used
each day. Two wheatless days of
three meals each are scheduled for
Monday and Wednesday. On these
days no food in which there is any
wheat may be used. This is a more
stringent rule than any heretofore
since a certain percentage of wheat
flour has been allowed. An extra pork
less day is added on Thursday, and as
a result no pork products are to be
consumed on Saturday and Thursday.
Every day must have one wheatless
meal and one meatless meal. Due to
the meat condition in California there
has been no meatless day fixed for this
state. In addition every day is strictly
wasteless, for students as well as
housekeepers.
