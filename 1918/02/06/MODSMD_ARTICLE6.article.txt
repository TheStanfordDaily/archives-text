# PROFESSOR FOLSOM IS NAMED PETROLEUM CONTROLLER
## IS IN CHARGE OF COAST Stanford Man to Assist Government in Great Fuel Crisis 
### 
David M. Folsom, professor of rain
ing at Stanford, has jnst been named
to serve as petroleum administrator
for the Pacific coast, to work unde'r
the government fuel administration
in controlling the output and market
ing of fuel oils on this coast.
Although he has the power to de
mand the licensing of all oil producing
companies, Professor Folsom does not
intend to take any such action, at least
for the present. Voluntary coopera
tion of the compnaies as authorized
under Section 2 of the I>ever act will
be the method resorted to for the pres
ent in dealing with the petroleum sit
uation.
Administrator Folsom feels that best
results will he obtained under this
voluntary arrangement which permits
the trained executives of the various
companies to keep the operation and
conduct of their business in their own
hands, leaving them free to follow
their own initiative in most matters.
If a licensing act was enforced this
trained leadership would not be avail
able to the same degree and direct
operation of affairs would fall on the
fuel oil administration, which only
wishes to have general control and
supervision over the affairs of the
various companies.
In order to cooperate in an advisory
capacity with the work of the war in
dustries board, with the work of the
shipping board and of the fuel admin
istration, the executive heads of the
"big five" oil marketing companies
have combined into the petroleum war
service committee. The administra
tion is not much concerned with small
producers of oil as they sell it almost
always to one of these five main "mar
keting" companies. Professor Folsom
now becomes an ex-officio member of
this committee.
Professor Folsom pointed out that
with the present supply of oil tankers
the companies would be able to meet
all of their orders promptly by pool
ing their interests and shipping to
gether. Should a shortage of tank
cars or of tank steamers occur as a
result of a government demand for a
quantity of them in the east, the Pa
cific coast oil administration through
Professor Folsom will have, to resort
to the use of some such list of indus
tries which are to be favored prior to
others in supplying fuel oil. There is
no indication at the present moment
that such a step will be necessary.

In order to cooperate in an advisory
capacity with the work of the war in
dustries board, with the work of the
shipping board and of the fuel admin
istration, the executive heads of the
"big five" oil marketing companies
have combined into the petroleum war
service committee. The administra
tion is not much concerned with small
producers of oil as they sell it almost
always to one of these five main "mar
keting" companies. Professor Folsom
now becomes an ex-officio member of
this committee.
Professor Folsom pointed out that
with the present supply of oil tankers
the companies would be able to meet
all of their orders promptly by pool
ing their interests and shipping to
gether. Should a shortage of tank
cars or of tank steamers occur as a
result of a government demand for a
quantity of them in the east, the Pa
cific coast oil administration through
Professor Folsom will have, to resort
to the use of some such list of indus
tries which are to be favored prior to
others in supplying fuel oil. There is
no indication at the present moment
that such a step will be necessary.
