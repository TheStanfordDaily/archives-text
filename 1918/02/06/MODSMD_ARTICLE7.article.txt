# Dr. Lanz Pleases Stanford Audience
## Pianist Renders Classical Interpretations and Original Pieces 
### 
That Dr. Henry Lanz is an excellent
composer as well as a talented pianist
was t'ae verdict of those who heard
him play in the Little Theater last
night. His renditions of the master
pieces of classical composers were
well received by the audience, but
none were applauded so generously as
the two original compositions with
which he closed his program of ten
numbers. His "The Desire" especially
was an excellent bit of music.
Dr. Lanz showed groat' feeling and
sympathy in bis interpretation of
famous pieces by such composers as
Mozart, Beethoven, Mendelssohn, and
Chopin. The "Sonata Pathetique" of
Heethoven, the "Marche Funebre" of
Mendelssohn, and an Etude by Chopin
were particularly well received.
Dr. Lanz gave two encores, "Rondo
Capriccioso" and "Boat Song" from
"Songs Without Words," both Men
delssohn comi>osit ions.
Despite the rain a good-sized crowd
attended the recital, and the Little
Theater was well tilled.
