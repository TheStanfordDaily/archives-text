## PHELPS IS CAPTAIN OF 1921 BASKETERS Clever Passing and Superior Teamwork of Babes Baffles Visitors 
### 
Using team-work that completely
baffled the California babes, Stanford
freshmen were victorious in their
"big" basketball game last night. The
Cardinal men led at the end of the
first half by the count of 13 to 12 and
rolled up a 27 to 19 count by the end
of the game.
rheJps and Kennedy (Star.
Phelps, elected captain of the Stan
ford team before the contest, and Ken
nedy, at forward for the babes, were
the shining lights of the game, with
the other three Cardinal players not
far behind. For California, Captain
Syrnes and Majors were thebes tmen.
Falrehilds Shoots Fouls Well.
A feature of the game was the ac
curate foul shooting of Fairchilds for
the Stanford combination. Out of
eight shots the little forward converted
five. Symes for California, although
lie had eleven shots, was oaly able to
put live of them in.
Stanford drew first blood when Fair
childs threw in a foul called by Ref
eree Klawans. Another point went to
Stanford's credit on a foul before the
California men were able to get
started, when Horstman made a goal.
The two fives fought neck and neck
until the last minutes of the half,
when Kennedy came through with his
third basket and put the Cardinal in
the lead for the half.
At the opening of the second period
the babes showed a burst of speed
and some of the best basketball seen
here was put up by the teams. Fair
childs, Kennedy, and Seaman each
made a basket, and the California men
were never able to overcome the lead.
