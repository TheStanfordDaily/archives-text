## BASE HOSPITAL 31 FROM CAMP FREMONT LOSE OUT IN FIFTH INNING 
### 
Stanford took revenge on Base Hos
pital 31 from Camp Fremont yester
day afternoon by taking the doctors
down the line for a sto 3 defeat. The
defeated team was the only combina
tion which lias been able to chalk up
a win against the Cardinal this quar
ter, but the varsity players came back
with a real exhibition yesterday he
hind IJarvey.
The hospital team took the first
run into its bag when two men
crossed the plate in the initial frame.
Coughlin was an easy out, but Pe
droni, up next, singled. Brislin was
given a free ride to first by Harvey,
putting two men on. Dodson. hitting
next, was put out, but Lindsey hit one
to right which brought in both Pe
droni and Brislin.
Both nines went scoreless in the
second, but in the third the fireworks
commenced again. W. Dobbins, the
first soldier up, was given a walk.
Then his brother, next, in line, was
safe at first on an error. W. Dobbins
and Hall were out on a double play,
but another etror allowed Dobbins,
who was on third, to score.
Stanford took her turn in the sec
ond half of the third. Lilly singled
to start the proceedings and promptly
stole second. Dickey and Harvey
could not bring him in, but Wayland
cnme through with another hit and
the runner scored. Wayland was
caught at second on the play, how
ever.
The Fremont men did not tally
again, but Stanford sewed the game
up in the fifth. Campbell started
things with a single and was followed
by a sacrifice hit and four safties
which resulted in four runs, enough
to put the game on ice.
