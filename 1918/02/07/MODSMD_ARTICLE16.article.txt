# BASE HOSPITAL 47

### 
A call to the colors that is worthy of consideration by all who are
thinking of entering war service is that which comes today from the Uni
versity's next door neighbor, Camp Fremont. Fifty college-trained men are
wanted to bring Base Hospital 47 up to full strength preparatory to go
ing across. These men need not necessarily be medical students or have
any special technical training, the call states.
While we do not urge any student who is not within the draft ago to
enlist, believing that his place is still at the University, there are many
men who are likely to be called out by the draft within a month or two,
and it is these men who should heed today's call. All men who are not
likely to be called for a considerable time should feel a responsibility to
stay with Stanford and their education for the present and thus prepare
themselves to be of the most use when needed. But men who would have
to go into the National Army within a short time anyway, should deter
mine where they can be of the greatest value to the government.
Base Hospital 47 is a branch of service where college men are espe
cially useful. This is well demonstrated by the fact that over 60 per cent
of the officers and men of Base Hospital 47 are college men, a number of
them coming from Stanford. Thus aside from the fact that the university
trained man would be of greater value here than perhaps any other place
in the service, he would find more congenial comradship among a bunch
of other college men.
We look to see a number of Stanford men who are now in the balance
and who must soon decide what branch of the service to enter, go into
Base Hospital 47.
