## THE 						MAKING OF AN AIRMAN. His Status, Salary, Medical Examination, etc. 
### 
All the details of the status of an
airman in the making has never been
fully told in sequence. Let us, there
fore, follow a young man who has de
cided he will endeavor to qualify for
the Air Service. First, of course
comes the routine of application.
The lowest age at which applicants
may be accepted is 18 years and 8
months, on the theory that at the end
of their training they will have
reached the age of 19, which is the
lowest age at which commissions may
be granted in the American army.
Applicants under 19, must present let
ters of approval of their enlistment
from their parents or guardian, as is
required throughout the military and
naval establishments of the country.
All aplicants may enlist at any avia
tion examining board.
If an applicant passed his 21st
birthday before June 5, 1917, and is
consequently subject to the draft, a
special arrangement has been made
whereby the rule prohibiting volun
tary enlistment by draft men is
waived and he is permitted to enlist
directly at an aviation examining
board without reference to the draft
or his draft board. All that is attend
ed to for him by the aviation authori
ties. Even if he is in the present
quota, he may be so enlisted, but if he
has been actually ordered into ser
vice by the draft board, he must re
port to his mobilization caftip as ord
ered, and there apply to his company
commander for transfer to the Air
Service.
The candidate's first step is to write
to, or visit personally, one of the
twenty-four Aviation Examining
Hoards located in the larger cities, or
the Recruiting Bureau, Aviation Sec
tion, Washington, D. C., to secure an
application blank for entering the ser
vice. The candidate fills this out as
indicated, with details of his life and
his athletic and educational qualifica
tions, in order to provide both a first
estimate of his desirability and as
complete a record as possible in case
of his acceptance.
Then comes his physical examina
tion. Naturally this must be strict
for the good of both the service and
the applicant. Also it appears for
midable to those who do not under
stand it, so formidable indeed that
the following explanation is given to
rob it of its mysteries.
Of course the usual tests of lung
and heart are given, for no man can
be accepted who is not strong enough
to withstand the pressure of high al
titude. The stcthescope, the tapping
of the chest, and the broad rubber
band about the arm are familiar
enough in testing lungs and blood
pressure.
When the candidate is set to pick
ing different colored papers out of a
box he may be a little mystified. Let
him remember, however, that color
blindness would be a source of weak
ness to one upon whose preciseness
of vision depend the lives and for
tunes of thousands of men below. It
|is often a slight change of color, a
suggestion of a deeper brown, that
first reveals the new cut trench to the
watchful eye in the sky.
But it is the balance test which
causes the most perplexity, largely be
cause it is Jiot understood. Testing
ing balance is a new science, and a
complicated one requiring ingenious
methods. But it is of vital import
ance to him who later may be unwind
ing from a spiral miles above the
ground or rushing along at twice ex
press train speed in a solid bank of
ciouds.
One's balance is regulated entirely
by a tiny fluid in the canals of the
inner ear. It is as delicate and as ac
curate as the fluid in the finest spirit
level. It is necessary to set it in
! motion in order to see how quickly
it recovers equilibrium, and conse
quently how strong the candidate is
in this respect. One should not be the
least surprised therefore when he is
placed in a revolving chair and spun
rapidly around, now sitting forward,
now back, and asked upon stopping to
point in a certain direction or execute
some other motions. Nor should he
be surprised if everything he does .ap
pears to him to be done wrong.
But the medical test is soon over,
and if the candidate passes, he may be
pretty sure that he is physically per
fect. He then goes on to a mental ex
amination which also sounds formid
able, but which is in reality, and of
necessity, brief. A few questions are
asked as to the candidate's career per
haps, but if he has had college train
ing he need not fear the outcome.
If the candidate is one of the three
who pass both tests, as he should be
with his advantage, he is notified that
he is accepted for training for the
Air Service as a member of the Signal
Enlisted Reserve Corps. Then, just
as soon as the preceding classes move
up, he is ordered into active service.
From that moment until he receives
his commission as an aviator or is
discharged, he is known as an Avia
tion Cadet, with the rank of Private
First. Class, a salary of $100 a month,
60 cents food allowance daily, living
quarters, uniform, and all traveling
expenses, including the trip to the
place where he is ordered to report
provided by the government.
In that status he goes through the
ground school and the flying school
until he has qualified as a Reserve
Military Aviator, Thereupon he is
given his first commission, a second
lieutenancy, with a salary of $1,700,
quarters provided by the government,
but food at about $1 per day and uni
form provided by himself. While on
flying duty he receives 25 per cent in
crease, and while on foreign duty an
additional 10 per cent increase.
Then after passing his final tests
| and becoming a Junior Military Avia
tor, he automatically advances one
grade in rank, in salary, and in allow
ance. A second lieutenant, therfore,
by the time he is fully trained, be
comes a first lieutenant, with a base
salary of $2,000. Further, however,
as a Junior Military Aviator he now
receives 50 per cent increase on his
base pay while on flying duty, and
another 10 per cent while on duty
abroad.

whereby the rule prohibiting volun
tary enlistment by draft men is
waived and he is permitted to enlist
directly at an aviation examining
board without reference to the draft
or his draft board. All that is attend
ed to for him by the aviation authori
ties. Even if he is in the present
quota, he may be so enlisted, but if he
has been actually ordered into ser
vice by the draft board, he must re
port to his mobilization caftip as ord
ered, and there apply to his company
commander for transfer to the Air
Service.
The candidate's first step is to write
to, or visit personally, one of the
twenty-four Aviation Examining
Hoards located in the larger cities, or
the Recruiting Bureau, Aviation Sec
tion, Washington, D. C., to secure an
application blank for entering the ser
vice. The candidate fills this out as
indicated, with details of his life and
his athletic and educational qualifica
tions, in order to provide both a first
estimate of his desirability and as
complete a record as possible in case
of his acceptance.
Then comes his physical examina
tion. Naturally this must be strict
for the good of both the service and
the applicant. Also it appears for
midable to those who do not under
stand it, so formidable indeed that
the following explanation is given to
rob it of its mysteries.
Of course the usual tests of lung
and heart are given, for no man can
be accepted who is not strong enough
to withstand the pressure of high al
titude. The stcthescope, the tapping
of the chest, and the broad rubber
band about the arm are familiar
enough in testing lungs and blood
pressure.
When the candidate is set to pick
ing different colored papers out of a
box he may be a little mystified. Let
him remember, however, that color
blindness would be a source of weak
ness to one upon whose preciseness
of vision depend the lives and for
tunes of thousands of men below. It
|is often a slight change of color, a
suggestion of a deeper brown, that
first reveals the new cut trench to the
watchful eye in the sky.
But it is the balance test which
causes the most perplexity, largely be
cause it is Jiot understood. Testing
ing balance is a new science, and a
complicated one requiring ingenious
methods. But it is of vital import
ance to him who later may be unwind
ing from a spiral miles above the
ground or rushing along at twice ex
press train speed in a solid bank of
ciouds.
One's balance is regulated entirely
by a tiny fluid in the canals of the
inner ear. It is as delicate and as ac
curate as the fluid in the finest spirit
level. It is necessary to set it in
! motion in order to see how quickly
it recovers equilibrium, and conse
quently how strong the candidate is
in this respect. One should not be the
least surprised therefore when he is
placed in a revolving chair and spun
rapidly around, now sitting forward,
now back, and asked upon stopping to
point in a certain direction or execute
some other motions. Nor should he
be surprised if everything he does .ap
pears to him to be done wrong.
But the medical test is soon over,
and if the candidate passes, he may be
pretty sure that he is physically per
fect. He then goes on to a mental ex
amination which also sounds formid
able, but which is in reality, and of
necessity, brief. A few questions are
asked as to the candidate's career per
haps, but if he has had college train
ing he need not fear the outcome.
If the candidate is one of the three
who pass both tests, as he should be
with his advantage, he is notified that
he is accepted for training for the
Air Service as a member of the Signal
Enlisted Reserve Corps. Then, just
as soon as the preceding classes move
up, he is ordered into active service.
From that moment until he receives
his commission as an aviator or is
discharged, he is known as an Avia
tion Cadet, with the rank of Private
First. Class, a salary of $100 a month,
60 cents food allowance daily, living
quarters, uniform, and all traveling
expenses, including the trip to the
place where he is ordered to report
provided by the government.
In that status he goes through the
ground school and the flying school
until he has qualified as a Reserve
Military Aviator, Thereupon he is
given his first commission, a second
lieutenancy, with a salary of $1,700,
quarters provided by the government,
but food at about $1 per day and uni
form provided by himself. While on
flying duty he receives 25 per cent in
crease, and while on foreign duty an
additional 10 per cent increase.
Then after passing his final tests
| and becoming a Junior Military Avia
tor, he automatically advances one
grade in rank, in salary, and in allow
ance. A second lieutenant, therfore,
by the time he is fully trained, be
comes a first lieutenant, with a base
salary of $2,000. Further, however,
as a Junior Military Aviator he now
receives 50 per cent increase on his
base pay while on flying duty, and
another 10 per cent while on duty
abroad.
All the details of the status of an
airman in the making has never been

of his acceptance.
Then comes his physical examina
tion. Naturally this must be strict
for the good of both the service and
the applicant. Also it appears for
midable to those who do not under
stand it, so formidable indeed that
the following explanation is given to
rob it of its mysteries.
Of course the usual tests of lung
and heart are given, for no man can
be accepted who is not strong enough
to withstand the pressure of high al
titude. The stcthescope, the tapping
of the chest, and the broad rubber
band about the arm are familiar
enough in testing lungs and blood
pressure.
When the candidate is set to pick
ing different colored papers out of a
box he may be a little mystified. Let
him remember, however, that color
blindness would be a source of weak
ness to one upon whose preciseness
of vision depend the lives and for
tunes of thousands of men below. It
|is often a slight change of color, a
suggestion of a deeper brown, that
first reveals the new cut trench to the
watchful eye in the sky.
But it is the balance test which
causes the most perplexity, largely be
cause it is Jiot understood. Testing
ing balance is a new science, and a
complicated one requiring ingenious
methods. But it is of vital import
ance to him who later may be unwind
ing from a spiral miles above the
ground or rushing along at twice ex
press train speed in a solid bank of
ciouds.
One's balance is regulated entirely
by a tiny fluid in the canals of the
inner ear. It is as delicate and as ac
curate as the fluid in the finest spirit
level. It is necessary to set it in
! motion in order to see how quickly
it recovers equilibrium, and conse
quently how strong the candidate is
in this respect. One should not be the
least surprised therefore when he is
placed in a revolving chair and spun
rapidly around, now sitting forward,
now back, and asked upon stopping to
point in a certain direction or execute
some other motions. Nor should he
be surprised if everything he does .ap
pears to him to be done wrong.
But the medical test is soon over,
and if the candidate passes, he may be
pretty sure that he is physically per
fect. He then goes on to a mental ex
amination which also sounds formid
able, but which is in reality, and of
necessity, brief. A few questions are
asked as to the candidate's career per
haps, but if he has had college train
ing he need not fear the outcome.
If the candidate is one of the three
who pass both tests, as he should be
with his advantage, he is notified that
he is accepted for training for the
Air Service as a member of the Signal
Enlisted Reserve Corps. Then, just
as soon as the preceding classes move
up, he is ordered into active service.
From that moment until he receives
his commission as an aviator or is
discharged, he is known as an Avia
tion Cadet, with the rank of Private
First. Class, a salary of $100 a month,
60 cents food allowance daily, living
quarters, uniform, and all traveling
expenses, including the trip to the
place where he is ordered to report
provided by the government.
In that status he goes through the
ground school and the flying school
until he has qualified as a Reserve
Military Aviator, Thereupon he is
given his first commission, a second
lieutenancy, with a salary of $1,700,
quarters provided by the government,
but food at about $1 per day and uni
form provided by himself. While on
flying duty he receives 25 per cent in
crease, and while on foreign duty an
additional 10 per cent increase.
Then after passing his final tests
| and becoming a Junior Military Avia
tor, he automatically advances one
grade in rank, in salary, and in allow
ance. A second lieutenant, therfore,
by the time he is fully trained, be
comes a first lieutenant, with a base
salary of $2,000. Further, however,
as a Junior Military Aviator he now
receives 50 per cent increase on his
base pay while on flying duty, and
another 10 per cent while on duty
abroad.
All the details of the status of an
airman in the making has never been
fully told in sequence. Let us, there
fore, follow a young man who has de
cided he will endeavor to qualify for
the Air Service. First, of course
comes the routine of application.
The lowest age at which applicants
may be accepted is 18 years and 8
months, on the theory that at the end
of their training they will have
reached the age of 19, which is the
lowest age at which commissions may
be granted in the American army.
Applicants under 19, must present let
ters of approval of their enlistment
from their parents or guardian, as is
required throughout the military and
naval establishments of the country.
All aplicants may enlist at any avia
tion examining board.
If an applicant passed his 21st
birthday before June 5, 1917, and is
consequently subject to the draft, a
special arrangement has been made
whereby the rule prohibiting volun
tary enlistment by draft men is
waived and he is permitted to enlist
directly at an aviation examining
board without reference to the draft
or his draft board. All that is attend
ed to for him by the aviation authori
ties. Even if he is in the present
quota, he may be so enlisted, but if he
has been actually ordered into ser
vice by the draft board, he must re
port to his mobilization caftip as ord
ered, and there apply to his company
commander for transfer to the Air
Service.
The candidate's first step is to write
to, or visit personally, one of the
twenty-four Aviation Examining
Hoards located in the larger cities, or
the Recruiting Bureau, Aviation Sec
tion, Washington, D. C., to secure an
application blank for entering the ser
vice. The candidate fills this out as
indicated, with details of his life and
his athletic and educational qualifica
tions, in order to provide both a first
estimate of his desirability and as
complete a record as possible in case
of his acceptance.
Then comes his physical examina
