# VARSITY FIVE TO STAGE TWO GAMES
## St. Ignatius Here Friday and St. Mary's Saturday Is Program Set 
### 
Basketball will come to the front
this week strongly with two league
games scheduled, the lirst with St.
Ignatius 011 the loe:il court and the
second with St. Mary's at Oakland.
Both games will have an important
bearing 011 the championship of the
California-Nevada League since Stan
ford is tied with four teams for that
position and if she can take both these
games she will be lel't in the running
with but two.
The St. Ignatius game will start at
7:45 o'clock Friday nigiit As usual
25 cents will be required for admis
sion, with 15 cents allowable for those
with student body tickets. The St.
Mary's game Saturday is scheduled to
begin at 7:20 o'clock, on the St. Mary's
court.
The Varsity has found its eye again
after the slump against Davis Farm
School and should take one if not both
of the week-end games. St. Ignatius
has already lost to California and Ne
vada and should be easy, but St.
Mary's may be a hard nut to crack.
California fell before this team last
Saturday by a large score, and with
tlie added advantage of playing on
their home floor, the OaklaudoTS will
give the Varsity men a hard run.
Coach Wilson plans to use Hood,
Moulton, Schwarzenbek, Parks, and
Butt in both the games.
