Butt at guard is proving to be a
tower of strength to the Varsity. He
gets the ball out of a scramble under
the basket nine cases out of ten and
has a manner of passing that usually
leaves his opponent helpless.

Stanford, Santa Clara, St. Mary's,
and the University of Nevada are tied
for first place in the California-Ne
vada league as a result of games last
week. St. Mary's defeated the Uni
versity of California, Saturday, while
Stanford was winning from Davis, and
Nevada from St. Ignatius.

California has the poorest team in
years, judging from comparative
scores of games the Blue and Gold
has played so far. St. Mary's took the
Berkeleyites down the line by a larger
score than the Catholic University
was able to roll up against any of
the other league teams, while St. Ig
natius only lost to Berkeley by a very
close score.
