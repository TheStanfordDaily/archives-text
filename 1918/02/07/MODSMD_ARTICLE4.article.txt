# BASE HOSPITAL 47 CALLS FOR FIFTY VOLUNTEERS
## 
### 
A call for fifty more enlisted men
was issued today from the headquar
ters of Base Hospital Unit 47, sta
tioned at Camp Fremont. The unit,
when it gets in active service "over
there" will have charge of a hospital
of 1000 beds instead of the 50 now
planned for. Hence the present
strength of 150 men will have to be
increased by fifty to bring it up to
the necessary 200. Equipment will
also have to be increased correspond
ingly.
Want Stanford Volunteers.
Especially are volunteers from Stan
ford University and the other uni
versities and colleges of this section
of the state desired, as over 60 per
cent of the unit is made up of col
lege men. It is not esential that the
volunteer be a medical or a pre-med
ical student, as there are no special
technical requirements. The call for
volunteers from Stanford is directed
to the men who are in line lor draft
within a few months and there is no
special attempt or desire on the part
of the officers of the unit to go after
men who are not in line for draft serv
ice for enlistment in this branch.

The men are needed for laboratory
and clerical positions among other
work. Applications from Stanford
men who want to enlist in Base Hos
pital 47 should be turned in to Assist
ant Registrar J. E. McDowell at once.
The unit expects immediate service
as soon as it is brought up to full
strength. It will remain at Camp Fre
mont at least long enough for this to
be accomplished. Colonel C. E. Man
ley is commanding officer of the unit.
Base Hospital 47 was organized by
the staff of the San Francisco Hos
pital. Its personnel of officers and
enlisted men is largely drawn from
San Francisco and the bay cities and
many of the officers of the unit are
well known physicians of this vicin
ity. It is the third base hospital unit
that has been fully equipped for serv
ice by the San Francisco Red Cross.
A number of the officers and men of
Base Hospital 47 are former Stanford
men. Lieutenant Sam R. Downing,
'07, who has held several conferences
on the campus with Assistant Regis
trar McDowell, is especially active in
trying to secure Stanford enlistments
for the unit.
