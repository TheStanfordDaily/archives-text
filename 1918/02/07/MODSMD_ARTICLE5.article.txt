# Track Meet Now Will Be April 13
## 
### 
Stanford's track hopefuls are to
match strides with the California
cinder-path men in the big intercol
legiate meet on April 13 instead of
April 20, as was first announced. The
moving of the date forward one week
was the result of negotiations intro
duced by the University of California
with Graduate Manager Sullivan. The
meet will be held at Stanford as was
previously arranged.
Strict training rules for the Cardinal
tracksters will go into effect, conse
quently, the latter part of this month.
Captain Wilson, however, advises that
the men begin immediately to practice
modified training, especially in the
cutting out of smoking, as gradual

easing off on ihis' practice produces
better results than sudden stopping.
When ttie training season goes into
effect, strict rules are to be enforced.
Track men will warm up on the
local cinder-paths next Saturday, at
10:irÂ» a.m., in the second shortened
distance meet of the season. If enough
varsity material is present, tho fresh
men and new men will compete in
| separate races. All distances will be
! shortened except the 100- and 220-yard
j events.
The Cardinal track men are holding
regular practice nowadays under the
J coaching of ".Jud" House and Captain
1 Wilson, who have taken over the work
since the departure of It. L. Temple-
