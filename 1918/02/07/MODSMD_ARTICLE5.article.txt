# Track Meet Now Will Be April 13
## 
### 
Stanford's track hopefuls are to
match strides with the California
cinder-path men in the big intercol
legiate meet on April 13 instead of
April 20, as was first announced. The
moving of the date forward one week
was the result of negotiations intro
duced by the University of California
with Graduate Manager Sullivan. The
meet will be held at Stanford as was
previously arranged.
Strict training rules for the Cardinal
tracksters will go into effect, conse
quently, the latter part of this month.
Captain Wilson, however, advises that
the men begin immediately to practice
modified training, especially in the
cutting out of smoking, as gradual

easing off on ihis' practice produces
better results than sudden stopping.
When ttie training season goes into
effect, strict rules are to be enforced.
Track men will warm up on the
local cinder-paths next Saturday, at
10:irÂ» a.m., in the second shortened
distance meet of the season. If enough
varsity material is present, tho fresh
men and new men will compete in
| separate races. All distances will be
! shortened except the 100- and 220-yard
j events.
The Cardinal track men are holding
regular practice nowadays under the
J coaching of ".Jud" House and Captain
1 Wilson, who have taken over the work
since the departure of It. L. Temple-
is also on hand every morning from
11 to lli o'clock, to help out those who
desire morning practice. An attempt
is to be made to inaugurate a system
I by which men in the same events can
! work together. This will be helpful
especially in the sprints. For those
whose required gym work interferes
with track training, an endeavor for
a special arrangement will be made, so
! that the track work will fulfill the re
i
j quirement.
Plans for the annual Irish Marathon
are being formulated, and this event
will probably take place in the near
future. According to Captain Wilson,
men should begin their training in the
quarter-mile as soon as possible, in
order to compete in the Marathon.
