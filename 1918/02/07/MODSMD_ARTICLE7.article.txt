# VARSITY SWIMMERS DOWN BABES
## 
### 
With the relay won by a hand h
length as the deciding event, the Stan
ford varsity tanksters buried their
freshman opponents by a score of 3(5
to :;i yesterday afternoon in the local
tank. The races were snappy through
out, and a fair degree or spirit pre
vailed.
Both the freshmen and varsity
swimmers were chalked up with 31
points when the gun was iired which

started the relay race. This event
proved the hair-raiser of the meet, for
the freshmen led tip to the final lap,
when Stewart, swimming for the Var
ity, ovorcame a short lead, and tapped
the edge ahead of Darling by a dis
ance that could be measured in frac
tions of an inch.
I Darling again showed up well with
| two first places to his credit in the
ton, '18, into aviation. House works
with the men daily from 1 to 4 p.m.,
and Wilson takes charge from 4 to 0.
One or the other of the acting coaches
50 and 220 yard events. The century
swim proved another sensational af
fair, when Campbell, representing the
freshmen, nosed out Stewart of the
varsity in a race, the result of which
was in doubt till the very finish.
The freshman tank artists will hook
up with the Concordia Club swimmers
on Saturday next at 3 p. m.in the
local tank in a meet which should fur
nish plenty of excitement.
