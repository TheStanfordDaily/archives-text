# Kappa's Again in Limelight Drastic Move May Prevent Spread of Dreaded Disease

### 
More consternation at the Kappa
house! The threatened wholesale
outbreak of measles which has been
keeping the Kappa nerves on edge for
the past three days, blossomed forth
yesterday in a far more serious form,
when Miss Lucile Lyons, '20, was
taken to her home in Oakland with a
light case of scarlet fever. As a re
sult all the Kappa sisters will be kept
in close confinement until next week.
The Kappas are now amusing them
selves perfecting patent germless mes
sage-carrying systems by which they
will be enabled to transmit their de
sires and requests to freshman men
in the neighboring houses, and in this
manner are enabled to get such neces
sities as U. S. mail and products from
Wilson's.
Rumors of a "Nickel Crawl" to be
given at the Kappa house tomorrow
night for all those possessing gerin
proof masks, are declared to be un
substantiated.
If no further complications ensue,
the officers announced today, the Kap
pas will be given their freedom on
Monday.
