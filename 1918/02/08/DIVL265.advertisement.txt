"The Style Shop of the Peninsula"
Our Mr. Lautterstein returns from eastern markets this week; in
spite of hardships encountered this year. He has made most excel
lent selections of dresses, suits, millinery, sweaters and waists that are
now coming in daily, and we can honestly say that the values are
better, the styles prettier and the prices lower than last season. Our
store is now full of new spring wear and we invite your cordial in
spection.
Now, the same can be said of our Men's Store. Early buying of
woolens has enabled us to keep prices down, and you will find that we
are selling our suits and everything foiymen at practically the old
prices. Our new stock is here, so come along and get the choice while
the selection is good.
