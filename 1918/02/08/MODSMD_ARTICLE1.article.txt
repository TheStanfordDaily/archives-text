St. Mary's from Oakland will furnish
week-end competition for the varsity
five in two league basketball games

the first team will be played on the
local floor, while St. Mary's will be on
her own court against the Cardinal.
Game Starts at 7:45.
The St. Ignatius on Encina court
tonight will start at 7:45. Admission,

smaller sum for student body mem
bers. St. Mary's will meet Stanford at
Oakland Saturday at 8 o'clock.
Regular Line-up Announced.

these two games that has started in
the other league games. Hood and
Moulton will hold down the forward
positions, Scliwarzenbek will be at
center, and Butt and ParLs will break
things up at guards.
The varsity has been in a bad slump
in the last two games, but they have
found their eye better than ever and
should win from St. Ignatius without
considerable difficulty, although the
San Francisco college is reported to
have a better team than usual. Cali
fornia only won by a very slight mar
gin from them and tonight's game will
furnish some dope on comparative
scores as to relative merits of Cardi
nal and Blue and Gold.
St. Mary's looks to have one of the
best teams in the league this year,
and if Stanford can hang a win over
their heads one strong combination
will be out of the running for the
league championship. St. Mary's has
defeated California, Davis, and St.
Ignatius by large scores, and hopes to
keep up the record when she meets
the Cardinal.
