Santa Clara is bringing a team up
that is putting its main strength on
experience. Several of last year's
stars are in the line-up and for this
reason the Red and White expect to
vindicate their football defeat by a
baseball win. A large number of root
ers from the Mission institution are
coming up to see their favorites in
action and expect to give the Cardinal
supporters a hard run in bleacher
noise.

teams get together. With the Stan
ford men putting up the game they
did against the Marines team from
San Francisco last Saturday, the com
bination from Santa Clara should be
sent back on the short end of the
score.
