# WHY ABOLISH POUGHKEEPSIE?
## 
### 
It is suggested in eastern college circles that the Poughkeepsie re
gatta be done away with. The idea has received the backing of Old Penn,
the official weekly magazine of the University of Pennsylvania. This pub
lication suggests as an alternative a series of dual races between the col
leges that have been accustomed to row on the Hudson, this to take place
on the Schuylkill or Lake Carnegie, or some such suitable course during
term time. Old Penn pleads the war as an excuse for the abolition of the
Poughkeepsie regatta, believing the expense occasioned by the lateness of
the date and the consequent extended duration of preliminary training to
be unjustified. The length of the course would be cut down from three
to two miles if the dual competition plan was substituted.
This last suggestion Is a wise one; and the limitation of training ex
pense is necessary in crew just as much as in other
lines of sport during present war times. But the substi
tution of a number of smaller races for the big re
gatta at Poughkeepsie would not mean a great saving in the total expendi
ture on rowing in the American universities affected. Even should there be
a slight saving in money the loss in interest to the public would not make
*p for it. The Poughkeepsie regatta furnishes perhaps the most thrilling
intercollegiate competition in the United States and under normal condi
tions there should be 110 thought of abandoning it.
Although there are objections to the late date, there are advantages. Many
•olleges could not participate in the races. Many persons could not attend
them if held in "term time," who would be enabled to witness them if they
continue to be staged after Commencement. This especially applies to such
•ccasional western entrants as Stanford University. The Poughkeepsie re
gatta on the Hudson is 0? such national importance that if it was scheduled
during the middle of a college term, the interest it would excite would be
great enough to take' the attention of the rowers and of many of the uni
versity and college student bodies, especially in the east, away from schol
astic work to too great an extent.
While at Stanford, as at many other institutions, crew has been aban
doned for the period of the war, it should be resumed after the war is over
as one of the most important of sports, and we look for the development of
as strong varsities in this branch of athletics as have represented the Uni
versity in the past. The failure of the 1916 crew to go back to Poughkeep
sie has always been a matter of keen regret to most Stanford people, in
view of the reputation the 1915 boat made in eastern waters the year before.
Stanford looks forward with confident hope to the future day"after the
war" when the Cardinal will again fly its colorn Among the leaders in the
great American regatta at Poughkeepsie.

great American regatta at Poughkeepsie.
It is suggested in eastern college circles that the Poughkeepsie re
gatta be done away with. The idea has received the backing of Old Penn,
the official weekly magazine of the University of Pennsylvania. This pub
lication suggests as an alternative a series of dual races between the col
leges that have been accustomed to row on the Hudson, this to take place
on the Schuylkill or Lake Carnegie, or some such suitable course during
term time. Old Penn pleads the war as an excuse for the abolition of the
Poughkeepsie regatta, believing the expense occasioned by the lateness of
the date and the consequent extended duration of preliminary training to
be unjustified. The length of the course would be cut down from three
to two miles if the dual competition plan was substituted.
This last suggestion Is a wise one; and the limitation of training ex
pense is necessary in crew just as much as in other
lines of sport during present war times. But the substi
tution of a number of smaller races for the big re
gatta at Poughkeepsie would not mean a great saving in the total expendi
ture on rowing in the American universities affected. Even should there be
a slight saving in money the loss in interest to the public would not make
*p for it. The Poughkeepsie regatta furnishes perhaps the most thrilling
intercollegiate competition in the United States and under normal condi
tions there should be 110 thought of abandoning it.
Although there are objections to the late date, there are advantages. Many
•olleges could not participate in the races. Many persons could not attend
them if held in "term time," who would be enabled to witness them if they
continue to be staged after Commencement. This especially applies to such
•ccasional western entrants as Stanford University. The Poughkeepsie re
gatta on the Hudson is 0? such national importance that if it was scheduled
during the middle of a college term, the interest it would excite would be
great enough to take' the attention of the rowers and of many of the uni
versity and college student bodies, especially in the east, away from schol
astic work to too great an extent.
While at Stanford, as at many other institutions, crew has been aban
doned for the period of the war, it should be resumed after the war is over
as one of the most important of sports, and we look for the development of
as strong varsities in this branch of athletics as have represented the Uni
versity in the past. The failure of the 1916 crew to go back to Poughkeep
sie has always been a matter of keen regret to most Stanford people, in
view of the reputation the 1915 boat made in eastern waters the year before.
Stanford looks forward with confident hope to the future day"after the
war" when the Cardinal will again fly its colorn Among the leaders in the
great American regatta at Poughkeepsie.
