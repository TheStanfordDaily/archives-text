Editor Daily Palo Alto:
One window, approximately ten feet
high and two feet wide, provided the
only ventilation for the Encina gym
nasium big exercise room Wednesday
afternoon even though dozens of
basketball players and other students
were there exercising—a considerable
number of them required to.
Not merely for one day does this
condition prevail, but I have noticed
that it has been practically the same
all this college year. Therefore, in
the interest of hygiene and sanitation
—and even consistency—l take it
upon myself to point out to the com
mittee on public health and to the
student body that conditions are as I
have mentioned.
May I ask those who can give the
reasons: Why should the life-giving
fresh air be so closely kept out?
Of course it is superfluous to refer
to the reasons why this life-giving
fresh air should not be let in—and let
in abundantly.
Respectfully,
(Signed) URAL N. HOFFMAN.
