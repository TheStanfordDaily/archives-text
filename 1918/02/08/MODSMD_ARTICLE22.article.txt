# PROFESSOR TERMAN RETURNS FROM EAST
## 
### 
Professor L. M. Terman has re
turned to Stanford from Washington,
D. C., where for the last month he has
been at work with Major Yerkes on
the revision of the psychological test
used in the United States army. In
the future all enlisted men and of
ficers, up to and including the rank
of brigadier general, will be given
this test. A training camp for psy
chologists was opened last week at
Fort Oglethorpe, Ga. Here about fifty
experts will be put through a two
months' training course.
Dr. Terman makes objection to
head-lines which appeared in The
Daily Palo Alto some weeks ago,
wrongly giving him credit for being
the discoverer of a new system of
mental measurement. He says that
the psychological methods in use in
the army are the invention of no one
person but were worked out by a com
mittee of seven, of which he was a
member. It so happened, however,
that the tests in most essential re
spects art a modification of the intelli
gence scale worked out by Arthur S.
Otis of Stanford. For this Mr. Otis
deserves the credit, says Dr. Terman.
