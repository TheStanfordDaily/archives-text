## 
### 
Means to cooperate with the Na
tional Food Administration has been
answered by a bulletin published by
the Department of Home Economics
of the State College of Agriculture,
; Ithaca, N. Y. The pamphlet contains
menus for each day in the week, and
strictly observes the special wheatless
and meatless days which have been
authorized by the President.
Campus house managers and others
i who have charge of the preparation of
; food have found it exceedingly difficult
to provide a variety of food within the
limits set down by Hoover. The
menus which have been prepared by
the New York colloge aim to aid in
the conservation of time, labor, and
money, as well as to save the foods
that are scare. In the following
meals is found the necessary food
