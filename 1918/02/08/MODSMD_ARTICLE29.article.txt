Reports on an investigation of air
propellers by two Stanford professors
for the National Advisory Committee
for Aeronautics have been recently
printed by the government printing
bureau, and copies of the same for
warded to the Mechanical Engineer
ing department of the University.
The results of the investigation
have been gathered together in Report
No. 14 of the committee, under the
heading, "Experimental Research on
Air Propellers," and are the joint
work of Professors W. F. Durand and
E. P. Lesley of the Mechanical En
gineering department. The paper
consists of three parts, the first of
which deals with aerodynamic labor
atories, the second with tests on forty
eight model forms of air propellers
with a discussion of the results, and
the third a brief discussion of the law
of similitude or the application of re
sults on models to full-sized machines.
At present Professor Durand is
chairman of the National Advisory
Committee for Aeronautics.
