# R O.T.C. Hears Adams Talk on German Attitude
## 
### 
"Germany's firm conception that the
German people are the chosen of God
to rule and direct the governments
and commercial interests of the world
was the basic cause of this war," said
Professor E. D. Adams of the History
department, when addressing the R.
O. T. C. today on the subject, "The
Present War and Its Causes."
Professor Adams reviewed the be
ginning of the war and then explained
in detail the conditions which led up
to the entrance of the United States
into the conflict.
"Germany's world domination the
ory," hesaid, "is contrary to the whole
idea of our democracy, which holds
that civilization must be left to work
out its own course. We are forced by
the application of this theory to take
our place beside the other nations of
the world in opposing Prussian dom
ination."
Professor Adams attributes Ger
many's attitude in this war to the
philosophy of the nation which has
gradually developed and has been
taught to their youth for the last fifty
years and which can be briefly sum
med up in the following statements
made by leaders of German philosophic
thought: "A nation's business is to
get power, and'moral principles must
not play any part in the activities of
the nation." "The German people are
always right bccause they are the Ger
man people numbering 87,000,000
souls." One of the Kaiser's favorite
pastors made the following statement
from the pulpit: "Whoever can not
prevail on himself to approve the sink
ing of the Lusitania and delight in
this manifestation of the superiority
of Germany is not a true German."
I "Unless we win this war or fight it
I to the point where German philosophy
jis completely changed another and
! greater war will follow," declared Pro
fessor Adams, in closing. "If, in view
of these facts, the American people
can not arouse themselves from their
easy chair, to the importance of the
situation they deserve to and will lose
this war."

"Germany's firm conception that the
German people are the chosen of God
to rule and direct the governments
and commercial interests of the world
was the basic cause of this war," said
Professor E. D. Adams of the History
department, when addressing the R.
O. T. C. today on the subject, "The
Present War and Its Causes."
Professor Adams reviewed the be
ginning of the war and then explained
in detail the conditions which led up
to the entrance of the United States
into the conflict.
"Germany's world domination the
ory," hesaid, "is contrary to the whole
idea of our democracy, which holds
that civilization must be left to work
out its own course. We are forced by
the application of this theory to take
our place beside the other nations of
the world in opposing Prussian dom
ination."
Professor Adams attributes Ger
many's attitude in this war to the
philosophy of the nation which has
gradually developed and has been
taught to their youth for the last fifty
years and which can be briefly sum
med up in the following statements
made by leaders of German philosophic
thought: "A nation's business is to
get power, and'moral principles must
not play any part in the activities of
the nation." "The German people are
always right bccause they are the Ger
man people numbering 87,000,000
souls." One of the Kaiser's favorite
pastors made the following statement
from the pulpit: "Whoever can not
prevail on himself to approve the sink
ing of the Lusitania and delight in
this manifestation of the superiority
of Germany is not a true German."
I "Unless we win this war or fight it
I to the point where German philosophy
jis completely changed another and
! greater war will follow," declared Pro
fessor Adams, in closing. "If, in view
of these facts, the American people
can not arouse themselves from their
