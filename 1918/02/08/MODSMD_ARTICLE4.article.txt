# WAR COMMITTEE WILL MAKE INVESTIGATION
## 
### 
The sub-committee on planting was
converted into an investigation bureau
at a meeting of the Women's War
Emergency Committee yesterday. Up
to the present time the committee on
planting has been planning a Univer
sity garden to be planted and culti
vated by Stanford women. But the
advisability of this project has been
questioned on the ground that the re
sult might be a waste rather than a
real aid in food production.
It is deemed necessary to investi
gate the need of such service as col
lege women might give and to find out
where it can best be applied before
starting definite action. Toward this
end the investigation bureau has been
advised to make inquiries of farmers,
expert agriculturists, canning associa
tions, and county and city authorities.
The results of this investigation will
be submitted to the Women's War
Emergency Committee and a course of
definite action will then be decided
upon.
At the next meeting of the commit
tee, to be held February 21, a full re
port will be given by the sub-commit
tee on Red Cross.
