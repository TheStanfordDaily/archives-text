### 
Another Stanford man will have
been called by the government into
an important position when Robert
M. Jones, '20, leaves next week for
Washington to serve in a confidential
capacity abroad. Jones received a
telegraphic appointment last night
from the State department to a posi
tion the nature of which cannot be
at present disclosed.
Jones entered the University in
January, 1917, and majored in Eco
nomics. Previously he had obtained
wide experience in business manage
ment from running a summer resort
and work with a railway company.
This year he dropped his academic
work and has been devoting his en
tire time to his duties as food ad
ministrator for most of the Stanford
living groups. The system of
"Hooverization" now being observed
throughout the campus is largely due
to his efforts. 1-Ie is 23 years of age,
registers from Los Angeles, and is a
member of Kappa Alpha.
