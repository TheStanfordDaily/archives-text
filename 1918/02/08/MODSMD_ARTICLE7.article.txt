# CINDER PATH ARTISTS TO HOLD SECOND MEET
## Track Men to Compete in Shortened Distance Events 
### 
Stanford's cinder-path artists will
stretch their legs in regular competi
tion for the second time this season
Saturday morning at 10:15, according
to announcement made by Captain Art
Wilson. The meet will take the form
of another shortened distance contest,
fashioned after last Saturday's meet
by the local track hopes.
Will Shorten Distances.
All distances will be shortened in
tomorrow's workout except the cen
tury event and the 220. The purpose
of this is to prevent the men from
overdoing themselves at the start of
the season. If a sufficient number of
varsity runners are on hand, the fresh
men and new men will compete sep
arately, in order that the participants
may be matched off on a more even
scale.
May Run Against Soldiers.
Captain Wilson made known today
that prospects for a track meet with
the soldiers from Camp Fremont are
showing up brightly. A number of
former track stars are stationed at the
local camp, and they should furnish
the Cardinal men some live competi
tion.
With plans being formulated for the
staging of the annual Irish marathon
in the near future, a number of new
quarter-milers will grace the track dur
ing the next few weeks in preparation
for this event. Early training for this
contest is an advantage, for it some
times happens that the marathon
brings to light new 440-yard material
which comes to be of varsity calibre.
