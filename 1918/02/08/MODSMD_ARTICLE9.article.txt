# Sophs Pull Nifty Advertising Stunt
## 
### 
"It Pays to Advertise." Absolutely
new and original in the line of adver
tising were the stunts pulled off by
that notorious bevy of wild-eyed fanat
ics, the sophomores, this morning and
noon on the campus. Every fratern
ity and sorority house on the Farm
became famous this morning as a re
sult of perfectly free publicity afford
ed it out of the kindness of heart of
the members of the 1920 class.
When the inmates of Roble Hall
awoke from their peaceful slumbers
at 5 minutes of 8 this morning, they
were at once shocked, surprised, and
pleased to observe a group of some
150 men gathered in front of the build
ing viewing a sign which said: "We
are the Roble Girls —It Pays to Ad
vertise." Similar signs such as "We
are the Pi Phis —It Pays to Advertise"
drew their crowds before each of the
sororities.
At noon, at each house, as eager
faces lined the board, a neatly
wrapped cake of "13 Soap" was pre
sented with the compliments of the
Sophomore Class, and a letter was
read which disclosed valuable infor
mation on the subject of advertising.
"Why do women wear short skirts and
silk stockings? Why do the Pi Phis
have an annual fire? Why does En
cina hold its pajama peerade? Why
are the Zetas going to have a dance?
Why do the D. G.'s have Jud around?
And what is the name of the sopho
more show?" asked the letter, and the
answer was"It Pays to Advertise."
Said the letter: The whole world
is run on advertising. Those who ad
vertise get by. Those who fail to ad
vertise don't. It doesn't make any
difference whether you want to sell
"13 soap, unlucky for dirt," or make
a good impression at a sorority dance.
It's all the same thing: The best ad
vertising for any young Joe who wants
to make an impression is to queen to
the Soph Play.
