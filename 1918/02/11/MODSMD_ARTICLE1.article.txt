# SANTA CLARA VICTOR IN BASEBALL GAME BY 10-8 SCORE
## FIVE PITCHERS ARE USED Ninth Inning Rally Makes Enough Tallies to Sew Up Contest 
### 
Five runs in the ninth inning put
the game on ice for Santa Clara,
10-8, last Saturday when the Red and
White and the Cardinal baseball
teams mixed it in the first contest of
the season. Stanford led until the last
frame by three runs, but the Mission
sluggers came back with a real rally
for their win.
Five pitchers were used by the two
teams before the slug-fest was over.
The visitors gathered fourteen bingles
off Lifur and Harvey, while Stanford
made eight safeties off Berg, Flower,
and Levy.
Santa Clara scored first when three
runners came in on three hits, a walk,
and an error in the first frame. Stan
ford could not come back in its half
of the inning, but after retiring three
visitors in the second three hits and
one error allowed two Cardinal run
ners to cross the plate.
Santa Clara came back in its half
of the inning with two more on a
triple, a walk, and a single. Not to be
outdone, Stanford took the lead, 6 to
5, in the fourth when Berg took a ride
skyward. Three walks, two errors, a
wild pitch, and finally a hit brought
four men in.
This ended the scoring until the
sixth, when Stanford added two more
to her string. Wayland tripled and
was followed by two singles by Gallo
way and Campbell, which coupled with
a stolen base allowed Wayland and
Galloway to score.
