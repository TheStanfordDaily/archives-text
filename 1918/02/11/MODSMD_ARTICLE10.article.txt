# FRESHMAN NINE FALLS BEFORE OAKLAND LADS TO TUNE OF 10 TO 0
## 
### 
Frequent errors and loose playing
were responsible for the defeat of the
freshman nine received Saturday at
the hands of the Oakland Technical
High School baseball heavers. The
dose was administered to the tune of
a 10 to 0 score. Criss, Van Cliff, and
Fairchilds worked out on the mound
for the locals and held the Oakland
lads to two hits.
The Oakland players worked one
man across the plate in the first in
ning and the score remained un
changed until the fifth, when a series
of errors allowed six of the "prep"
school players to cross the home
plate. An overthrow on first, a passed
ball at home plate, three errors on in
tield grounders, and a muffed hall in
center field were responsible for the
damage. Oakland again scored three
runs in the sixth.
Criss was replaced in the box in the
sixth inning by Van Cliff, who was un
able to locate the plate, and retired
after walking two men. Fairchilds,
who followed, held the visitors to no
hits for the remainder of the game.
Reynolds, Fairchilds, and Parker were
responsible for the three bits secured
off the Oakland pitcher. Frietas and
Urickwell of Oakland found the ball
for two hits off Criss.
The freshmen smashed the ball fre
quently for long flies into the field
but good work on the f>nrt of the Oak
landers prevented any of them from
becoming hits.
