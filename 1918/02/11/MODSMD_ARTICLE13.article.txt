# Sophomore Show Seat Sale Success
## "It Pays to Advertise" Will Be Played Before Full House on Friday 
### 
That the seat sale of last Friday
; was extremely*encouraging, is the re
| port of the management of "It Pays to
j Advertise," the sophomore play, which
is to be presented in the Stanford As
! sembly Hall on Friday, February 15.
! The biggest first-day sale since* the
! staging of "Justice," the production of
i the English Club last year, was re-
J corded, and every indication promises
a large house for the coming comedy.
I Nearly $400 was taken in.
Due to the inducement of one-half
price tickets for the soldiers of Camp
! Fremont, a considerable number of
, the army men are expected. For this
: reason it is probable that all good
| seats will be sold out rapidly, and it
I will be necessary for Stanford stu
dents who have not already done so
I to secure their seats as early as pos-
Isible.
Miss Mary Largent, who is taking
the lead in"It I'ays to Advertise," was
released from the quarantine which
has kept her in the Kappa Kappa
Gamma house today, and the cast is
entering into the last week of rehears
als with the ou'tlook promising for a
very successful production. A dress
I rehearsal is scheduled for Wednesday
evening.
S. G. Whittelsey is at the present
time understudying the part of M. T.
R. 1). Maynard, who is at home with
'the measles. Whittelsey fits into the
i part almost perfectly, and considering
the short time he has had to work on
| the part, he is doing exceptionally
well. If sickness prevents Maynard's
appearance in the play, the part will
not suffer in the hands of Whittelsey.
An orchestra of eleven pieces, rep-
I resenting some of the best of Stan-
I ford's musicians, has been secured to
furnish the music for Friday's produc-
I tion, and it is now rehearsing in prep
aration for this event.
