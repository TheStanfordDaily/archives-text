# LET THERE BE AIR
## 
### 
A hearty second is hereby accorded the suggestion in regard to ven
tilation of Encina gymnasium, made underneath the "Another Viewpoint"
head in Friday's issue of The Daily Palo Alto. At certain times of the day
there is sufficient fresh air in the big gym room to supply all who are using
it, but in the busy hours during the afternoon, when scores are using the
apparatus, the mats, or the basketball court, or are going through setting
up exercises, there is need for ventilation and lots of it. This is a case
where all that should be necessary to be done to remedy the existing evil
is to call the attention of those in charge to present air conditions in the
gymnasium.
While we are on the subject of fresh air as part of the University
curricula, it would not be a bad idea if some of the professors and instruc
tors in the various departments paid a bit more attention to classroom ven
tilation. The members of the faculty who disregard the laws of proper air
supply by keeping every window and transom shut for the entire period
of recitation or lecture are not the only offenders. The enthusiasts who
throw open too many windows and cause the chilliest kind ot 8 o'clock
drafts to keep their students in shivers until they are gradually numbed into
insensibility, figuratively speaking, are just about as guilty.
That there is a "happy medium" in this matter is shown by the excel
lent way a great part of Stanford's teaching force looks out for the ventila
tion of the recitation and laboratory rooms. Thoughtlessness is usually
the excuse on the part of the erring ones who are responsible. We hope
that they too can see that their students get the right amount of pure
fresh air.
