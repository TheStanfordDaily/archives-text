"It is the patriotic duty of everyone
to make himself as perfect as possi
ble," said Miss Signe Hagelthorne in
the first lecture given under the aus
pices of the physical education depart
ment, which was delivered last Friday
afternoon in the Little Theater.
"Activity is tlie birthright of the in
dividual, and should be guarded and
directed," she said. Since the proper
functioning of the body organs de
pends on proper posture, the forward
slouch which is common among stu
dents should be carefully avoided."
.Miss Hagelthorne then demonstrated
what she called "the students' stoop."
She further explained four values of
physical education and three agencies
by which they are accomplished.
