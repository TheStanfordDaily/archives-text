"The Cause of the War" is to be the

Battle of the Marne."

connected with the Argonaut. He has
conducted the weekly war review col

come to be recognized throughout the
country as one of the ablest and most
reliable war summaries printed. Mr.
Coryn, during the last year, has been
delivering a series of talks on war sit
uations in San Francisco and the bay
region.
The lecture tomorrow night is one
of the regular Tuesday evening series,
