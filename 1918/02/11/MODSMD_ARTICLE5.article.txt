# GOOD TIME RECORDED IN INFORMAL MEET SATURDAY
## WEAVER CLEARS 6 FEET 1 INCH IN HIGH JUMP Tracksters to Don Spikes With Fremont Men February 21 
### 
Only the lack of several varsity men
detracted from the jazz of last Satur
day's informal shortened distance
track meet, on the local cinder
paths. The events were snappy,
and several exciting races as well as
some good times were recorded.
That Weaver of the 1920 class
dropped over six feet one inch of
space in the high jump, promises well
for the future of this event. Probably
the fracas that created most interest
during the morning was a relay staged
between Wright and Hertel of the
freshmen, and Davis and Teitsworth
of the Varsity. The 1921 pair raced
past the finish but a foot aliead of the
opposing couple in one of the prettiest
little races of this season.
With the season thus far advanced,
and several meets scheduled for the
near future, it is necessary, according
to Captain A. L. Wilson, that varsity
track men begin regular and system
atic practice. The soldiers from Camp
Fremont will send a team to meet the
Stanford tracksters on February 21. A
number of former track stars are sta
tioned at the neighboring camp, and
they should be able to furnish a good
session of the Cardinal hopes. An
other informal meet will probably be
the card for the coming Saturday, but
in this the distances will not be short
ened.
Election of a captain to pilot the
freshman cinder-path artists through
out the present season will take place '
in the near future.

Election of a captain to pilot the
freshman cinder-path artists through
out the present season will take place '
in the near future.
The results of last Saturday's meet
follow:
Mile (three laps)— Wilson, '18, first;
Clark, '21, second; Samis, '20, third;
Stark, '21, fourth.
100-yard—Davis, '20, first; Wimber
ley, '21. second; Doyle, '21, third.
120 low hurdles —Rogers, '21, first;
Doyle, '21, second.
440-yard (352) —Wright, '21, first;
Hertel, '21, second.

880-yard (GGO) —Wilkie, '20, first;
Wilson, 'IS, second; Colglazier, '20,
third; Sutton, '21, fourth.
Two mile (live laps) — Chapman,
'18, first; Teitsworth, '19, second;
Cowell, '21, third.
Relay (220 yards)—Hertel, '21,
first; Teitsworth, '19, G. Davis, '20,
second.
High jump—Weaver, '20, first;
Heath, '20, second; Hargrove, 'IS,
Rogers, '21, tie for third.
Broad jump—Wiraberley, '21, first;
Lyon, '20, second; Rogers, '21. third.
Pole vault —Green, '21, first; Carter,
'21, second.
Shot—Mee.se, '19, first; Morris, '19,
second; Betts, '19, third.
Only the lack of several varsity men
detracted from the jazz of last Satur
day's informal shortened distance
track meet, on the local cinder
paths. The events were snappy,
and several exciting races as well as
some good times were recorded.
That Weaver of the 1920 class
dropped over six feet one inch of
space in the high jump, promises well
for the future of this event. Probably
the fracas that created most interest
during the morning was a relay staged
between Wright and Hertel of the
freshmen, and Davis and Teitsworth
of the Varsity. The 1921 pair raced
past the finish but a foot aliead of the
opposing couple in one of the prettiest
little races of this season.
With the season thus far advanced,
and several meets scheduled for the
near future, it is necessary, according
to Captain A. L. Wilson, that varsity
track men begin regular and system
atic practice. The soldiers from Camp
Fremont will send a team to meet the
Stanford tracksters on February 21. A
number of former track stars are sta
tioned at the neighboring camp, and
they should be able to furnish a good
session of the Cardinal hopes. An
other informal meet will probably be
the card for the coming Saturday, but
in this the distances will not be short
ened.
