# GOOD TIME RECORDED IN INFORMAL MEET SATURDAY
## WEAVER CLEARS 6 FEET 1 INCH IN HIGH JUMP Tracksters to Don Spikes With Fremont Men February 21 
### 
Only the lack of several varsity men
detracted from the jazz of last Satur
day's informal shortened distance
track meet, on the local cinder
paths. The events were snappy,
and several exciting races as well as
some good times were recorded.
That Weaver of the 1920 class
dropped over six feet one inch of
space in the high jump, promises well
for the future of this event. Probably
the fracas that created most interest
during the morning was a relay staged
between Wright and Hertel of the
freshmen, and Davis and Teitsworth
of the Varsity. The 1921 pair raced
