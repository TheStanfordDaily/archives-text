# DR. JORDAN TALKS ON WAR
## 
### 
In a speech delivered Saturday be
fore the Commonwealth Club of San
Francisco, Dr. Jordan laid bare Ger
man war methods in the most scath
ing indictment of the German empire
yet heard in San Francisco. The sub
ject was "Why the War Goes On," and
in it were included the conclusions
made from a long study of the causes
of all wars, as well as the present
one. Dr. Jordan gave some of the
underlying causes of the war, ex
plained German philosophy, which is
in itself a main cause, and interpreted
the cult of kultur as a system which
"represents the military ideal brought
over into civil life."
Some Fundamental Causes.
With regard to causes of the pres
ent conflict, Dr. Jordan said, "Why
war goes on is that war is a part of
the dynastic machinery that is left
over in Europe. This war was started
by the autocrats of Germany and Aus
tro-Ilnngary to overcome the growing
menace of socialism and all such

movements, which are inimical to dy
nasties and autocracies." He said
that monarchies could not continue
without the constant expectation of
war to keep the people's minds from
their own troubles.
"Dynastic State Hoot of War."
"The philosophy behind every action
of the Hermans takes three forms,"
said Dr. Jordan, in speaking of this
phase of kultur, "the supreme state,
supreme discipline (kultur), and so
cial Darwinism (the supreme call to
national action).
"A dynasty is a series of individ
uals who, by inheritance, rule over
the lives, properties, and destinies of
other nun." He went on to explain
that inherited power can only main
tain itself by using force, without
which it begins to wane: from this
need of action in the form of foreign
wars come such conflicts as the pres
ent.
"Foreign war, actual or threatened,
is to lhe dyr.asty a perennial neces
sity. rt uproots tlie noxitv- weeds —
democracy, socialism, international
ism, pacifism, anti-militarism —which
spring up In the soil of peace and
. hoke the dynastic gatden."
Of the philosophy of kultur, Dr.
Jordan said, in part:
' The keynote to the whole cystem
is found in the phrase, 'Service, co
ordination, power.' The individual is
forced to service, the impulse to ser
vice coming from above. The result is
mass efficiency, an efficiency which de
mands the docility of the populace.
Docility does not mean gentleness.
The 'docile' army commits the most
atrocities." *
The three duties of the German citi
zen, he said, were: "Be a (soldier, pay
taxes, and hold your tongue." The
thing upon which kultur Tests is "mass
power, coordinated and subordinated
teamwork, never individual develop
ment." a thing which, when contrasted
with democracy, makes for more ac
complishment, but for little individ
ual self-expression upon which democ
racy is founded.
Dr. Jordan concluded, showing the
motive of kultur:
"The third element in dyanstic phil
osophy, social Darwinism, implies not
only the survival of the fittest state,
but in addition, its supreme duty is
to subdue or destroy its inferior
! rivals. This gives to kultur its mo
tive.
"Friction, in one form or another,
will go on so long as autocracy has
its hold on civilization. The era of
peace will follow when the heads of
nations become servants, not masters
of the people.
"Democracy must come in fact as
well as in name. In the words of the
French poilu, "The people have been
nothing; they must be everything."

with democracy, makes for more ac

motive of kultur:

In a speech delivered Saturday be
fore the Commonwealth Club of San
Francisco, Dr. Jordan laid bare Ger
man war methods in the most scath
ing indictment of the German empire
yet heard in San Francisco. The sub
ject was "Why the War Goes On," and
in it were included the conclusions
made from a long study of the causes
of all wars, as well as the present
one. Dr. Jordan gave some of the
underlying causes of the war, ex
plained German philosophy, which is
in itself a main cause, and interpreted
the cult of kultur as a system which
"represents the military ideal brought
over into civil life."
Some Fundamental Causes.
With regard to causes of the pres
ent conflict, Dr. Jordan said, "Why
war goes on is that war is a part of
the dynastic machinery that is left
over in Europe. This war was started
by the autocrats of Germany and Aus
tro-Ilnngary to overcome the growing
menace of socialism and all such

movements, which are inimical to dy
nasties and autocracies." He said
that monarchies could not continue
without the constant expectation of
war to keep the people's minds from
their own troubles.
"Dynastic State Hoot of War."
"The philosophy behind every action
of the Hermans takes three forms,"
said Dr. Jordan, in speaking of this
phase of kultur, "the supreme state,
supreme discipline (kultur), and so
cial Darwinism (the supreme call to
national action).
"A dynasty is a series of individ
uals who, by inheritance, rule over
the lives, properties, and destinies of
other nun." He went on to explain
that inherited power can only main
tain itself by using force, without
which it begins to wane: from this
need of action in the form of foreign
wars come such conflicts as the pres
ent.
"Foreign war, actual or threatened,
is to lhe dyr.asty a perennial neces
sity. rt uproots tlie noxitv- weeds —
democracy, socialism, international
ism, pacifism, anti-militarism —which
spring up In the soil of peace and
. hoke the dynastic gatden."
Of the philosophy of kultur, Dr.
Jordan said, in part:
' The keynote to the whole cystem
is found in the phrase, 'Service, co
ordination, power.' The individual is
forced to service, the impulse to ser
vice coming from above. The result is
mass efficiency, an efficiency which de
mands the docility of the populace.
Docility does not mean gentleness.
