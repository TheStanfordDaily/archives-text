# 1921 Swimmers Down Concordians

### 
Stanford's freshman swimmers car
ried off the honors in last Saturday's
meet with the Concordia Club of San
Francisco by a score of 46 to 22.
Darling, swimming for the babes, was
easily the individual star of the after
noon, annexing four first places. They
were in the 50-yard, 220-yard, back
stroke, and 100-yard events.
Not a single first place was put down
to the credit of the Concordians.
Strauss, with four seconds, was their
biggest point winner. The relay was
easily taken by the local water-dogs.
The freshmen are scheduled to
match their strokes with the Lick High
School swimmers from San Francisco
next Saturday, at 11 a.m. Lick is well
known as having one of the speediest
"prep" school aggregations about the
bay, and they sliould furnish the fresh
men a live hour in the coming contest.
