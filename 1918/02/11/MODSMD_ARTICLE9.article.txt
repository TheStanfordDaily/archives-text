# War Saving Stamp Campaign Started
## 
### 
An effort is being made this week
throughout the State to give informa
tion regarding the nature of "War
Saving Stamps" and to stimulate in
terest in their purchase. Campus peo
ple are to have an opportunity to
learn just what they are, what the
government expects to gain by their
issuance, and why it is patriotic to
buy them. Tonight and tomorrow at
the various houses on the campus
speakers will tell about the stamps
and will be ready to clear up any ques
tions regarding them.
Alumni will speak at the sorority
house meetings tonight, while a com
mittee composed of alumni and others
will talk at the fraternity houses, the
men's chibs, and Encina Hall.
It will be explained that the pur
chase of these stamps will promote
thrift, will show patriotism, will be a
good security insuring 4 per cent in
terest to be compounded quarterly,
will give everyone an opportunity to
partake in loans to his government,
and will tend to reduce consumption
of luxuries and of resources which are
needed by the government to insure a
successful promotion of the war.
This concentrated effort on the part
of men and women on the campus to
attempt to disseminate knowledge
concerning the war saving stamps is
part of a bigger movement which is
being inaugurated throughout the na
tion and is being conducted under the
auspices of the United States Treas
ury Department. Mr. John S. Drum
is the California state director of War
Saving Stamps. The movement in
Santa Clara county is under the direc
tion of the Santa Clara Woman's
Committee of the State Council of Na
tional Defense. The campus campaign
is being cared for by a committee of
alumni and others on the campus.
