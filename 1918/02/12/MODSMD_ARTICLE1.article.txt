# VARSITY NINE TO BATTLE FREMONT TEAM TOMORROW
## HARVEY TO BE PITCHER Game Will Be Called at 4 o'clockâ€”Admission Is Fifteen Cents 
### 
A team from Camp Fremont will
furnish mid-deek competition for the
varsity baseball nine tomorrow after
noon. Manager Sullivan has not
made definite arrangements for a
team yet but he has two of the best
combinations at the camp on the
string and expects to get one of them,
them.
The game will start later than the
usual Wednesday contest in order
that everyone can attend. The um
pire will call "play ball" promptly
at 4 o'clock under the new schedule.
The regular preliminary game fee of
twenty-five cents will be charged
while student body members with
their cards can pass for fifteen cents.
Captain Lilly will probably use
Harvey on the mound tomorrow with
Briggs substituting in case of dif
ficulty. The rest of the team will
line up as in former games, with
Caniphell behind the bat, Davis on
first, Doe at second, Galloway cavort
ing around on short and Dickey, on
third. In the outfield will be Way
land, Lilly, and either Knox or Mor
ris.
