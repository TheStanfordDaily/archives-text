# U.C. to BATTLE CARDINAL
## FIRST BASKETBALL FLAY IS THURSDAY BABES PLAY WEDNESDAY Nevada Quintet Will Furnish Competition for Five Tomorrow Night 
### 
California and Stanford will meet in
their first major competition of the
present year Thursday night, when
the Cardinal and Blue and Gold vars
ity fives tangle on Encina court. In
addition to this game, basketball fans
will be given a final opportunity to
see the team in action when the Uni
versity of Nevada meets Stanford
Wednesday night. At the same time
the freshman combinations from Cal
ifornia and Stanford will meet in their
deciding contest Wednesday as a pre
liminary to the Nevada play.
According to the present dope, Stan
ford should defeat California Thurs
day. The Cardinal has five men on
the team who work together in real
basketball style, while California de
pends on a rather disorganized com
bination. In addition, the Blue and
Gold seems to lack men who can put
the ball in the basket with any regu
larity, while Stanford, in Moulton,
Hood, and Schwarzenbek, has a scor
ing combination that should be good
lor most of the shots attempted. In
the guarding line Stanford has a clear
advantage in Butt and Parks. Butt,
especially, has been a tower of
strength when the play is under an
opponent's basket, and he should
break up plays with regularity next
Thursday. Parks, although he fits in
the team-play of the Varsity in good
shape, is not so strong on defense as
Butt.
California has a new team and so is
an unknown quantity. They got away
to a bad start the first of the season,
but have been improving steadily of
late. Comparative scores indicate,
however, that Stanford still has a hot
ter machine than the Blue and Gold.
St. Ignatius lost, to California, 22 to 19,
while Stanford was able to beat the
San Francisco team 35 to 19. St.
Mary's rolled up a larger score on
Stanford on her own floor than she
did against California in Harmon gym
nasium, but Stanford in turn made ten
points more against the Oakland col
lege than California was able to do.
The Cardinal hopefuls were off color
in the Davis game and as a result the
dope favors California in this contest,
but against the College of Pacific,
Stanford showed up much better.
The California team will be picked
tomorrow from the following men:
Salmina, Beresford, Chow, Cuffo,
Green, Heegler, Grul, and Harter.
Manager Sullivan has announced
that the California game will start at
8 o'clock and that 50 cents admission
will he charged both student body and
non-student, body members, since this
is an intercollegiate contest.

strength when the play is under an
opponent's basket, and he should
break up plays with regularity next
Thursday. Parks, although he fits in
the team-play of the Varsity in good
shape, is not so strong on defense as
Butt.
California has a new team and so is
an unknown quantity. They got away
to a bad start the first of the season,
but have been improving steadily of
late. Comparative scores indicate,
however, that Stanford still has a hot
ter machine than the Blue and Gold.
St. Ignatius lost, to California, 22 to 19,
while Stanford was able to beat the
San Francisco team 35 to 19. St.
Mary's rolled up a larger score on
Stanford on her own floor than she
did against California in Harmon gym
nasium, but Stanford in turn made ten
points more against the Oakland col
lege than California was able to do.
The Cardinal hopefuls were off color
in the Davis game and as a result the
dope favors California in this contest,
but against the College of Pacific,
Stanford showed up much better.
The California team will be picked
tomorrow from the following men:
Salmina, Beresford, Chow, Cuffo,
Green, Heegler, Grul, and Harter.
Manager Sullivan has announced
that the California game will start at

California and Stanford will meet in
their first major competition of the
present year Thursday night, when

ity fives tangle on Encina court. In

see the team in action when the Uni
versity of Nevada meets Stanford

According to the present dope, Stan
ford should defeat California Thurs
day. The Cardinal has five men on
the team who work together in real
basketball style, while California de
pends on a rather disorganized com
bination. In addition, the Blue and
Gold seems to lack men who can put
the ball in the basket with any regu
larity, while Stanford, in Moulton,
Hood, and Schwarzenbek, has a scor
ing combination that should be good
lor most of the shots attempted. In
the guarding line Stanford has a clear
advantage in Butt and Parks. Butt,
especially, has been a tower of
strength when the play is under an
opponent's basket, and he should
break up plays with regularity next
Thursday. Parks, although he fits in
the team-play of the Varsity in good
shape, is not so strong on defense as
