# MAKING FINAL PLANS FOR R.O.T.C. BALL
## Committee Promises Novel Attractions Along Martial Lines 
### 
Arrangements for the military ball
to be held in Encina gymnasium
Thursday evening, February 21, are
fast nearing completion. The event is
in the hands of committees appointed
by the Service Club and promises to
be one of the biggest drawing cards
of the season. Some unique attrac
tions of a variety seldom seen in cam
pus dances are scheduled by the com
mittees in charge.
Every aspect of the ball is being
arranged along military lines, even
down to the programs, which are dif
ferent from anything ever seen here
before. They will be specially made
in the form of a wrist watch and
will have the initials of the It. O. T.
C. and the name and date of the event
printed on them in cardinal letters.
An exhibition drill by the military
men is to be a feature of the evening.
Just what the drill will be has not
been decided as yet but it will in all
probability show some special mili
tary formations or feature bayonet
drills. The decorations which will be
used have not been definitely decided
on but those in charge promise some
thing new along patriotic lines.
Sergeant C. S. Kegley, '18, in charge
of the music, has secured a six-piece
orchestra to furnish the jazz. Bugle
calls and other military customs will
take the place of announcements
throughout the evening.
