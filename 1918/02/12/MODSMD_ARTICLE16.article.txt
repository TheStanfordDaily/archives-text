# THRIFT STAMPS
## 
### 
Most of the inhabitants of the campus have had the war savings cer
tificate and thrift stamp ideas pretty thoroughly explained to them by
now by the faculty and other speakers who have visited the various living
groups in the interests of this drive.
All that remains now is for the students to back the drive up with their
full support. The government expects to raise $2,000,000,000 from the sale
of these certificates and stamps which means that each man, woman and
child must purchase an average of $20 worth. We may not all be able to
sacrifice even this amount, at least not immediately, but everybody should
do something along this line.
It isn't such a great sacrifice to lend Uncle Sam some money at a good
rate of interest and the only element that makes this deed an act of patri
otism is the timeliness. Uncle Sam needs the money. This is not time for
slackerism even in buying two-bit thrift stamps.
