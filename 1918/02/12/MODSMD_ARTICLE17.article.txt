# ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S EXAMPLE
## 
### 
Today when all the world is involved in mortal conflict, we in the
United States pause to honor our greatest war President, Abraham Lin
coln. Born of the people, he rose to the ranks of the great. He watched
his every opportunity and did the thing in hand to do with utmost wisdom
and justice.
We who remain in the university away from the field of action can
look forward as Lincoln did to the greater struggle that will follow the war,
reconstruction. To him, the building afterward was as important as the
wielding of the sword. Students in universities today have this problem to
meet. They will he the leaders of tomorrow. To each one should come
the realization that his duty now is to prepare for the future. This aim
was denied to Lincoln, and as a result the whole country suffered for lack
of foresight.
People in the United States cannot hut hope that the life and prin
ciples of Lincoln may serve as an example to leaders in world affairs to
day. *
