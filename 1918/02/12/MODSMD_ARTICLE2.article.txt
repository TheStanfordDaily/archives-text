# BRITISHER ADDRESSES MEN OF SERVICE CLUB
## Captain Carlton Tells of Experiences in "No Man's Land" 
### 
Captain Carlton of the British army
addressed the men of the Service Club
and advanced military classes yester
day in the Little Theater. He gave
interesting explanations of sniping,
gas attacks and patrolling in "No
Man's Land." The talk was made more
vivid by relations of his own experi
ences at the front.
Captain Carlton was a member of
the British expeditionary force sent
to France at the outbreak of the war.
Of the 120,000 men in that force only
30,000 now remain alive, and most of
them, he said, are wounded or crip
pled. Of his regiment of 13,000, but
fifty men are now living. Captain
Carlton himself has been seriously
wounded. He is now engaged in im
parting military knowledge to the sol
diers at Camp Fremont while he re
covers more fully from his injuries.
He was assigned by lot to the local
cantonment.
One of the most vivid descriptions
he gave yesterday was a description
of an exploring expidition into "No
Mail's Land" for exploring a section of
the front which had been abandoned
by both the British and German forces.
He was to report on the advisability
of again occupying this sector of the
front. Accompanied by only a few
non-commissioned officers who had
volunteered their servxices he crept
out over the shell craters and aban
doned trenches under the cover of
darkness, watchful all the time for an
occasional German sniper. Three of
the men in the party were lost in a
mine crater and did not return until
the next night.
