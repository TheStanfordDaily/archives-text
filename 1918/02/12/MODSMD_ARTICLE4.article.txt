# Circus Billed by '500' Tomorrow
## 
### 
Barnum & Bailey, Sells-Floto, and
other masters of the sawdust rings
will turn green with jealousy at the
circus to be given by the "500" Wed
nesday afternoon from 4 to Gin the
Women's Club House. The advance
agents assert that there will be
camels, elephants, tigers, monkeys,
and many other ferocious creatures,
in addition to daring acrobats, and
beautiful bareback riders Who will
flutter forth in tulle dresses and much
war paint to jump through rings at
the clash of cymbals. Some feminine
inhabitants of the Row, who have no
wild beasts to donate and who do not
possess great talent for rugged and
sensational acting, have offered their
services as venders of pink lemonade.
Owing to the constantly changing
weather conditions no parade will be
given, but it is hoped that all ladies
and children (this does not include
freshman men) will come promptly
and bring their 15 cents, for the pro
ceeds will help buy new furnishings
for the Club House. "Mere Man" is
not included in this invitation.
