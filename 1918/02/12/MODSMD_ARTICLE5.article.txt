# WAR SAVING STAMP CAMPAIGN STARTS AMONG STUDENTS
## FIRST RESPONSE GOOD Stanford Service Club Has Charge of Distribution of Thrift Cards 
### 
Pledge cards for the purchase of
war saving stamps have been dis
tributed on the campus today by the
Stanford Service Club.
All men's organizations and all
sororities on the campus heard the
plea for the purchase of war saving
stamps last night. A committee of
alumni and other campus workers
visited the various houses spreading
information of this latest form of
service and testing the campus pa
triotism.
All students in the houses visited
were asked to pledge themselves to
buy war saving stamps and the re
sponse reported was remarkable.
One sorority house reported an en
listment of 100 per cent of its mem
hers in the cause of thrift. Others
came forward in such a splendid
manner that it is estimated that a
conservative number would show 75
per cent of the students In these
houses pledged to buy stamps.
Over 1200 pledge cards have al
ready been given out for distribution
among thirty-six student organiza
tions. ur. Angel 1 spoke to the mem
bers of Encina Club last night. Roble
Club will hear Miss Isabel 11c-
Cracken speak and is to receive its
cards tonight. Private houses on the
campus are also being visited so that
every student will have a chance to
sign his blue card.
The campaign is so organized that
none need wait to sign a card in
order to become a "man behind a
gun." Stamps are on sale at the
postoflice and students are free to set
their money working for the govern
ment at any time.
Twenty-five cents spent on a
thrift stamp is twenty-five cents di
verted from the purchase of some
luxury. The decrease in the demand
for luxuries thus created by divert
ing funds into other and more patri
otic channels means a corresponding
decrease in the supply of things
which arc not essential. The ma
terial and energy formerly used in
the manufacture of these goods may
then he set to work in the produc
tion of articles demanded by the war.
The United States intended to raise
two billion dollars by the agency of
these stamps, but thus far the re
sponse is far short of the goal. This
is largely due to ignorance of the
system, it is thought, and for this
reason the Treasury Department has

started this campaign in which infor
mation concerning the stamps is
generously given.
The pledge cards give opportunity
for demonstration of patriotism by
promises to loan money to the gov
ernment and to help it to conserve
its resources, instead of investing in
wasteful consumption.
The thrift stamp is a loan 1o the
government of twenty-five cents
value. Supposedly, every citizen of
the United States will he aide to buy
at least one stamp to assist in
financing the war.
