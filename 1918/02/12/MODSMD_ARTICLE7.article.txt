# 1920 to Cheer Men in Service
## 
### 
That the Sophomore Class might be
able to keep in touch with their mem
bers who have entered the various
branches of the service, a letter is
Ueing sent out to them from the
"Class of 1920."
The letter tells of the doings of the
sophomores during the year, in an in
teresting style, and invites the absent
members of the class to write to the
University of their doings. It has a
copy of the sophomore poster printed
on it. The committee in charge is
M. L. liulkley, '20, H. G. Swendsen,
'20, and C. F. Randall, '20.
The letter follows:
"Stanford University, Cal.
"Dear Member of the Class of '20:
"In order to keep in touch with its
members now in the service and to get
a line on their doings since being in
said service, the Class of 1920 has ap

pointed a committee to write you fel
lows. As you probably know, there
are a great many of you men from the
class who are now in uniform, both in
this country and across the way, and,
needless to say, those of us who are
left are more than mildly interested
as to how you are faring.
"Doubtless you have been receiving
the news of the campus and know all
about the class rush at the beginning
of the semester, when we smeared the
frosli in the tie-up. Also how Stanford
cleaned up on Santa Clara in both the
frosh and varsity Rugby games, the
latter being the most spectacular
game that has been seen in the west
for many a year. The most recent
event of importance was the cotillion
which the class staged the night be
fore Thanksgiving. It was a real hop
â€”the committee appointed by Presi
dent "Red" Tauzer having seen to it
that the gym was all decked out like
the Hawaiian Islands themselves, with
punch served .from the palm-thatched
huts, Hawaiian music, etc. We had
quite a controversy as to whether
we'd make it a formal or informal
affair but the old-time custom pre
vailed and 'soup-and-fish' was the
order of the evening.
"Now to get back to the chief pur
pose of this epistle. We want you to
write us a letter. Toll us what the life
is like, what you have been doing, and
anything or everything about your ex
periences in the service. Don't be
surprised if you see your account
blossom forth in the 'Dippy;' you
know what an inquisitive and alto
gether irresponsible outfit that is.
"Trusting to hoar from you real
soon and wishing you the best of suc
cess, we remain, sincerely yours,
"CLASS OF 1920."
