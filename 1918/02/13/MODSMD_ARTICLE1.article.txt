# ASK ENFORCEMENT OF CONSTITUTIONAL ARTICLE
## "EX" COMMITTEE ACTS A.S.S.U. Card Necessary for Participation in Student Body Activities 
### 
Executive Committee last night went
on record as favoring a strict enforce
ment of the article in the student
body constitution which provides that
only members of the Associated Stu
dents are eligible to represent Stan
ford in any activities whatever, to
hold class offices, or to receive any
emblems awarded by the association.
The graduate manager was instructed
by the committee to carry out this
enforcement.
This means that all class officers,
members of athletic teams, of The
Daily Palo Alto staff, debaters, and j
those taking part in campus dramatics
will have to become members of the
student body at once, if they have not
done so already. The article referred
to is Article 1. Section 2, of the Con-j
stitution of the Associated Students,
and reads:
"All members of Leland Stanford
Junior University are eligible to mem
bership in this association, and be- j
come such upon registration and pay
ment of all regular dues. Only mem
bers of this association shall be en
titled to represent Stanford, to hold
any association or class office, or to
receive any benefits or emblems given
by the association."
Members of the varsity debating
team were awarded medals at the Ex
ecutive Committee meeting last night.
Those who will receive the medals
are W. I. Ames, '18, J. G. Driscoll, '18,
and Miss Margaret Shedd, '20. Ames
has debated for three years, while
Driscoll and Miss Shedd have been
on teams for two years.
The minutes follow:

Absent—M. F. Samis.
