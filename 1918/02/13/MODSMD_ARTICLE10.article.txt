# FOOD CONSERVATION CO-OPERATION URGED BY ADMINISTRATION
## 
### 
Groups and individuals living on the
Stanford campus, while making a sin
cere and intelligent effort for the most
part to co-operate in the food conser
vation movement, still do not com
pletely understand the full signifi
cance of the Hoover plan in detail, ac
cording to H. C. Moreno, associate
professor of the Applied Mathematics
department, who is the representative
of the food conservation bureau for
the Stanford campus, appointed re
cently by President Ray Lyman Wil
bur.
Voluntary Cooperation.
There is no attempt to coerce any
body into eating a certain way, accord
ing to Professor Moreno. Results are
to be obtained by purely voluntary
co-operation. The food administration
is not so much interested in having
people economize, although economy
is necessary in these war-times, as it
is in seeing that certain products are
used in greatly reduced quantities
here so that they may be shipped to
our soldiers "over there." These prod
ucts may be divided into four classes,
according to Professor Moreno.
In regard to saving wheat, the gov
ernment asks everybody to observe
one wheatless meal a day and two
wheatless days a week â€”on Monday
and Wednesday. Campus houses that
are using bread containing reduced
amount of wheat are practically
achieving the same results, but it will
become necessary both to use the
mixed-flour bread and to observe the
wheatless meals and days, Moreno be
lieves.
By national order the bakers are di
luting their white-flour bread since the
3d of February, so that by February
24 there will be only eighty per cent
wheat in the "white" bread. Graham
bread also contains eighty per cent
wheat, hence the use of the special
war breads containing between thirty
and forty per cent wheat is necessary
for maximum wheat conservation. Dis
tinction should be made carefully

when ordering the so-called "Liberty
Bread," as this term is taken to in
clude the eighty per cent wheat bread
by many bakers.
Here in the state of California
meatless day has been abolished be
cause the scarcity of pasture and hay
and the impossibility of shipment east
has resulted in a surplus of meat on
the Pacific Coast. However, porkless
days should be observed on Tuesday
and Saturday, and many fraternities
and other living groups have cut out
the use of bacon, ham and other pork
products almost, if not absolutely, en
tirely.
Professor Moreno recommends that
vegetable fats such as cotton-seed oil
be substituted for animal fats in cook
ing as these latter, like pork products,
can be easily shipped across the At
lantic for immediate use by the men
at the front. Butter used must be lim
ited to seven ounces per person per
week, and the consumption of sugar
must be reduced one-fourth, in order
to bring the campus living groups into
entire accord with the Hoover volun
tary food-honor ration.
