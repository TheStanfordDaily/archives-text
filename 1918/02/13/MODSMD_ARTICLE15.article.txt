# ENFORCING THE CONSTITUTION
## 
### 
Executive Committee last night authorized and directed the graduate
manager and the president of the Associated Students to enforce the pro
visions of the constitution insisting on membership in the student body as a
requirement for participation in athletics and other activities. Ordinarily
such an action would not be necessary as practically every person engaged
in such activities has in the past possessed a membership ticket, but this
year so abnormally small is the number of men and women in the A. S. S.
U. that a large number of men on the various athletic squads, holding class
offices or taking part in plays, have failed to purchase cards. The same
criticism applies to the women on their teams and in all activities in which
they take part.
All persons affected by this provision of the constitution should get
busy and buy their cards immediately and not take chances of forfeiting
places on lineups, staffs, or in student organizations by further lassitude in
attending to this matter. Those taking active part in the various sports
and activities are indignant, and justly so, at the attitude taken by some
students who are doing nothing in the way of participating in student body
affairs. This is not meant as an excuse to justify those who do give their
time and energy to represent Stanford in failing to A. S. S. U. tickets,
but on the other hand, there is no man or woman who is privileged to at
tend this University who can not at least become a member of the Associ
ated Students if they can do no more to represent Stanford.
A considerable percentage of those who have not yet secured student
body membership is composed of transfers. It is about time that these
transfers woke up to the fact that they are no longer at U. S. C. or wherever
it was that they came from, and began to understand that it really means
something to be Stanford men and women in war times as well as in peace
times. Joining the student body is one way to "get on the boat!"
The quarter is almost half over. There should he several hundred
more A. S. S. U. tickets issued before the end of the week.
