# WHERE ARE THE YELL LEADERS?
## 
### 
The consistent absence of yell leaders at athletic contests thus far
during the quarter has been a source of considerable surprise to a number
of the students who turn out to the basketball and baseball games. There
have been some important battles with such old-time rivals as California
and Santa Clara, but there has been no attempt at organized rooting. True,
there have not been as many rooters as there should have been, but the ap
peal to the fan to "come out and yell for the team" lacks the weight it
would have if there were someone on hand to lead the bleacher support.
California freshmen "came back" at Harmon gym last Friday night
and defeated our freshman basketball team, thereby tying the series. The
tide was turned for the Blue and Gold in the second half largely as a re
sult of the enthusiastic cheering by the Blue and Gold fans under the di
rection of their yell leaders.
Tomorrow night Stanford and California clash in basketball on the En
cina court. Tonight the Varsity meets the University of Nevada. In both
games Stanford's team needs the organized, enthusiastic support of the
entire University. The rooters will be there. How about the yell leaders?
