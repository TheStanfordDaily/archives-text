# War Causes Given by Sidney Coryn
## Struggles of the Serbians for Independence Against Austrians Told 
### 
Startling information in regard to
the causes for and beginning of the
war was presented last night in the
Little Theater by Sidney Coryn, asso
ciate editor of the San Francisco Ar
gonaut, in his lecture, "The Cause of
the War." He disclosed the intrigues
and the webs of backstairs diplomacy
with which the Teutonic powers, par
ticularly Austria-Hungary, have at
tempted to throttle the life of their
small Serbian neighbors.
"We are the allies of Serbia." said
Mr. Coryn, "and we should be proud
of it. The six-hundred year struggle
of the Serbians for liberty is one of
the most heroic in history, but has al
ways been hampered and made futile
by the incessant intrigues of the Aus
trians. 'Serbia must be destroyed'
was their keynote."
The lecturer described at length the
circumstances surrounding the out
break of the present struggle. "The
pan-Germans had for forty years been
attempting to realize their dream of
a Germanic state which would include
the territory occupied by Serbia. The
kaiser announced himself as protector
of the Mohammedans and declared that
he would conquer the whole human
race by means of his Bagdad rail
way," stated the speaker.
"The Austrian archduke whose as
sassination nominally started the con
flict," said Mr. Coryn, "was sent down
into Bosnia for the express purpose of
being assassinated. lie was killed by
Austrians, not Serbians, and the Aus
trian government furnished the kill
ers."
The whole German system was most
bitterly denounced by the speaker.
"The pan-Germanists have been plot
ting this war to enslave the world for
forty years," he said. "We should ex
terminate them as we would exterm
inate rattlesnakes."
