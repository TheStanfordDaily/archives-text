### 
Two courses, for women exclusively,
"Food and War" and "Fundamentals
of Food and Nutrition in Relation to
the War," were instituted at the Uni
versity of California last Monday,
when Professor Agnes Morgan opened
with her first lecture at 11 a.m., in
Wheeler Hall. These courses are
preparatory to cooperation with the
National Food Administration on the
part of the women. The lecture out
lines are now being sent from Herbert
Hoover's office direct to many of the
educational institutions of the country
as a nation-wide movement. For the
time being the attendance is limited
to college women only.
