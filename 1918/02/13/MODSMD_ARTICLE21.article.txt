NEW WORK FOR INTERCOLLEGI
ATE INTELLIGENCE BUREAU
Since February, 1917, nearly one
j hundred and fifty colleges, technical
schools and universities organized as
the Intercollegiate Intelligence Bu
j reau, having been giving special aid
! to the country in its greatest crisis.
| Brought into existence almost at the
direct request of the Secretaries of
War and the Navy, the bureau has
| been warmly received and greatly
I used by government departments.
About four thousand men of special
j ized training have been placed at im
' portant war work on the request of
; government officers for men having a
variety of training and experience.
In a number of cases the bureau
served when other sources had failed.
The method used was to have an ad
jutant and committee appointed at
each educational institution, which
would organize as a co-operative unit
of the bureau. Through questionnaires
and otherwise the adjutants kept on
file accurate and adequate information
iof students and alumni, so that the
calls from the Washington office of
the bureau could be answered, by
sending nanies of men who were fit
and who could serve the government.
Success has been brought by the ad
jutants. Those institutions which have
helped most, and in turn have been
strengthened most, have their adju
tants to thank. The extensive work
of the Washington office was made
possible by devoted young volunteers
from a dozen colleges, who gave their
time and expenses while carrying the
bureau into government departments.
After a while the committees of col
lege men were organized because of
the large number of desirable and
available men in the cities.

The past is encouraging, but the
future is larger and broader. Calls
from the government—very important
ones —continue to come in, and this
primary work will go on. Industrial
and commercial establishments are
calling for help, and their necessities
are hardly secondary to those of the
government.
A month ago several persons asked,
"How about helping the boys get back
into business when they come home?"
"Why does not the bureau undertake
this?" Arrangements have been
made with the American University
Union of Europe to do this great task
jointly. The union offices in Europe
will be those of the bureau, and the
bureau offices here will be those of I
the union. The union will register |
men who are about to come home, as !
much in advance as possible, and will
send their qualifications and desires
for the future to the bureau here,
which will try to have a place for
them when they arrive. The bureau
will be ready to steer those who have
been severely injured and may have
1 to adopt new activities. The men will

come back to a different country from
the one they left, and it will be the
work of the bureau to make them ac
quainted with the new conditions and
help them to get a good and prompt
start at rebuilding.
Some time ago it was suggested by
prominent college men that the bu
reau should look forward to a perma
nent existence as the co-ordinating or
ganization for all college employment
bureaus. This may be expected, but
can be given only a passing thought
at present.
For all this activity a larger organi
zation has been planned. The execu
tive committee has been increased to
give a broader representation and fu
ture support.
Miss Louise Sheppard of Vassar
comes to the Washington office to or
ganize'an adequate response to the de
mand for college women which is in
creasing in extent and importance.
A division of information will supply
special information which may be
asked for by college officers. It will
mail a weekly letter which will put
