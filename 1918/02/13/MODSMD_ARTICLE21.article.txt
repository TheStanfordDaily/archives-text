NEW WORK FOR INTERCOLLEGI
ATE INTELLIGENCE BUREAU
Since February, 1917, nearly one
j hundred and fifty colleges, technical
schools and universities organized as
the Intercollegiate Intelligence Bu
j reau, having been giving special aid
! to the country in its greatest crisis.
| Brought into existence almost at the
direct request of the Secretaries of
War and the Navy, the bureau has
| been warmly received and greatly
I used by government departments.
About four thousand men of special
j ized training have been placed at im
' portant war work on the request of
; government officers for men having a
variety of training and experience.
In a number of cases the bureau
served when other sources had failed.
The method used was to have an ad
jutant and committee appointed at
each educational institution, which
would organize as a co-operative unit
of the bureau. Through questionnaires
and otherwise the adjutants kept on
file accurate and adequate information
iof students and alumni, so that the
calls from the Washington office of
the bureau could be answered, by
sending nanies of men who were fit
and who could serve the government.
Success has been brought by the ad
jutants. Those institutions which have
helped most, and in turn have been
strengthened most, have their adju
tants to thank. The extensive work
of the Washington office was made
possible by devoted young volunteers
from a dozen colleges, who gave their
time and expenses while carrying the
bureau into government departments.
After a while the committees of col
lege men were organized because of
the large number of desirable and
available men in the cities.

The past is encouraging, but the
future is larger and broader. Calls
from the government—very important
ones —continue to come in, and this
primary work will go on. Industrial
and commercial establishments are
calling for help, and their necessities
are hardly secondary to those of the
government.
A month ago several persons asked,
"How about helping the boys get back
into business when they come home?"
"Why does not the bureau undertake
this?" Arrangements have been
made with the American University
Union of Europe to do this great task
jointly. The union offices in Europe
will be those of the bureau, and the
bureau offices here will be those of I
the union. The union will register |
men who are about to come home, as !
much in advance as possible, and will
send their qualifications and desires
for the future to the bureau here,
which will try to have a place for
them when they arrive. The bureau
will be ready to steer those who have
been severely injured and may have
1 to adopt new activities. The men will

come back to a different country from
the one they left, and it will be the
work of the bureau to make them ac
quainted with the new conditions and
help them to get a good and prompt
start at rebuilding.
Some time ago it was suggested by
prominent college men that the bu
reau should look forward to a perma
nent existence as the co-ordinating or
ganization for all college employment
bureaus. This may be expected, but
can be given only a passing thought
at present.
For all this activity a larger organi
zation has been planned. The execu
tive committee has been increased to
give a broader representation and fu
ture support.
Miss Louise Sheppard of Vassar
comes to the Washington office to or
ganize'an adequate response to the de
mand for college women which is in
creasing in extent and importance.
A division of information will supply
special information which may be
asked for by college officers. It will
mail a weekly letter which will put
[ college officers everywhere in close
| and immediate contact with whatever
development has occurred which
j would seem of importance in the plan-
I ning of college activities during and
I after the war.
A larger division of service calls
| will keep a close relation with the
personnel needs of government de
partments, and of private business
serving the government, and trans
; mit them to the adjutants.
A division of records and organiza
i tion will serve the adjutants in the
j colleges and cities so as to make their
j work more effective. It will also plan
I to follow up all recommendations, re
j cording and reporting to the adjutant
j acceptances and rejections.
The two latter divisions will jointly
handle the cases of returning collegi
ate soldiers, and attend to other busi
ness from the American University
j Union in Europe. To assist this work
j plans are under way to have a New
York office of call for the convenience
of the men when they land.
Money is necessary, and there is 110
hesitancy in asking for it. The work
is for the government, for the col
! leges and for college men. The
| men who have offered themselves for
! their country have a right to expect
j help in making up for the time lost by
, getting re-established in industry at
the earliest possible moment.
The budget of the bureau, in addi
tion to a large amount of volunteer
help, is $2,000 per month. Any col
lege, university or technical school
may become a member of the bureau
; by paying $50, $150 or $250, each in
stitution deciding for itself which of
j the three amounts is proper. The
j money may be paid directly by the in
stitution. or by some of its friends,
I but can be received only with the con
sent of its president.
In addition to the membership fee.
1 trustees' groups of alumni, or indi
vidual alumni, are asked to undertake
| the raising of funds somewhat pro
portionate in size to their alumni pop
ulation and wealth. Several alumni
groups of large universities have un
derwritten funds of $2500 each, and
groups from a number of smaller ones
will supply funds down to $250.
The bureau invites all college men
to call at the Washington office, which
is now in the Munsey building. It is not
an employment bureau, however, and
places applicants only 011 the recom
mendation of adjutants. Nevertheless,
it is glad to give suggestions and in
formation which may be of interest
to college men and women.
The bureau needs a certain amount
of volunteer help of a very high class.
It cannot possibly pay any of its work
ers adequately, but the work is won
derfully interesting and gives most
valuable experience.

NEW WORK FOR INTERCOLLEGI
ATE INTELLIGENCE BUREAU
Since February, 1917, nearly one
j hundred and fifty colleges, technical
schools and universities organized as
the Intercollegiate Intelligence Bu
j reau, having been giving special aid
! to the country in its greatest crisis.
| Brought into existence almost at the
direct request of the Secretaries of
War and the Navy, the bureau has
| been warmly received and greatly
I used by government departments.
About four thousand men of special
j ized training have been placed at im
' portant war work on the request of
; government officers for men having a
variety of training and experience.
In a number of cases the bureau
served when other sources had failed.
The method used was to have an ad
jutant and committee appointed at
each educational institution, which
would organize as a co-operative unit
of the bureau. Through questionnaires
and otherwise the adjutants kept on
file accurate and adequate information
iof students and alumni, so that the
calls from the Washington office of
the bureau could be answered, by
sending nanies of men who were fit
and who could serve the government.
Success has been brought by the ad
jutants. Those institutions which have
helped most, and in turn have been
strengthened most, have their adju
tants to thank. The extensive work
of the Washington office was made
possible by devoted young volunteers
from a dozen colleges, who gave their
time and expenses while carrying the
bureau into government departments.
After a while the committees of col
lege men were organized because of
the large number of desirable and
available men in the cities.

The past is encouraging, but the
future is larger and broader. Calls
from the government—very important
ones —continue to come in, and this
primary work will go on. Industrial
and commercial establishments are
calling for help, and their necessities
are hardly secondary to those of the
government.
A month ago several persons asked,
"How about helping the boys get back
into business when they come home?"
"Why does not the bureau undertake
this?" Arrangements have been
made with the American University
Union of Europe to do this great task
jointly. The union offices in Europe
will be those of the bureau, and the
bureau offices here will be those of I
the union. The union will register |
men who are about to come home, as !
much in advance as possible, and will
send their qualifications and desires
for the future to the bureau here,
which will try to have a place for
them when they arrive. The bureau
will be ready to steer those who have
been severely injured and may have
1 to adopt new activities. The men will

come back to a different country from
the one they left, and it will be the
work of the bureau to make them ac
quainted with the new conditions and
help them to get a good and prompt
start at rebuilding.
Some time ago it was suggested by
prominent college men that the bu
reau should look forward to a perma
nent existence as the co-ordinating or
ganization for all college employment
bureaus. This may be expected, but
can be given only a passing thought
at present.
For all this activity a larger organi
zation has been planned. The execu
tive committee has been increased to
give a broader representation and fu
ture support.
Miss Louise Sheppard of Vassar
comes to the Washington office to or
ganize'an adequate response to the de
mand for college women which is in
creasing in extent and importance.
A division of information will supply
special information which may be
asked for by college officers. It will
mail a weekly letter which will put
[ college officers everywhere in close
| and immediate contact with whatever
development has occurred which
j would seem of importance in the plan-
I ning of college activities during and
I after the war.
A larger division of service calls
| will keep a close relation with the
personnel needs of government de
partments, and of private business
serving the government, and trans
; mit them to the adjutants.
A division of records and organiza
i tion will serve the adjutants in the
j colleges and cities so as to make their
j work more effective. It will also plan
I to follow up all recommendations, re
j cording and reporting to the adjutant
j acceptances and rejections.
The two latter divisions will jointly
handle the cases of returning collegi
ate soldiers, and attend to other busi
ness from the American University
j Union in Europe. To assist this work
j plans are under way to have a New
York office of call for the convenience
of the men when they land.
Money is necessary, and there is 110
hesitancy in asking for it. The work
is for the government, for the col
! leges and for college men. The
| men who have offered themselves for
! their country have a right to expect
j help in making up for the time lost by
, getting re-established in industry at
the earliest possible moment.
The budget of the bureau, in addi
tion to a large amount of volunteer
help, is $2,000 per month. Any col
lege, university or technical school
may become a member of the bureau
; by paying $50, $150 or $250, each in
stitution deciding for itself which of
j the three amounts is proper. The
j money may be paid directly by the in
stitution. or by some of its friends,
I but can be received only with the con
sent of its president.
In addition to the membership fee.
1 trustees' groups of alumni, or indi
vidual alumni, are asked to undertake
| the raising of funds somewhat pro
portionate in size to their alumni pop
ulation and wealth. Several alumni
groups of large universities have un
derwritten funds of $2500 each, and
groups from a number of smaller ones
will supply funds down to $250.
The bureau invites all college men
to call at the Washington office, which
is now in the Munsey building. It is not
an employment bureau, however, and
places applicants only 011 the recom
mendation of adjutants. Nevertheless,
it is glad to give suggestions and in
formation which may be of interest
to college men and women.
The bureau needs a certain amount
of volunteer help of a very high class.
It cannot possibly pay any of its work

derfully interesting and gives most

NEW WORK FOR INTERCOLLEGI
ATE INTELLIGENCE BUREAU
Since February, 1917, nearly one
j hundred and fifty colleges, technical
schools and universities organized as
the Intercollegiate Intelligence Bu
j reau, having been giving special aid
! to the country in its greatest crisis.
| Brought into existence almost at the
direct request of the Secretaries of
War and the Navy, the bureau has
| been warmly received and greatly
I used by government departments.
About four thousand men of special
j ized training have been placed at im
' portant war work on the request of
; government officers for men having a
variety of training and experience.
In a number of cases the bureau
served when other sources had failed.
The method used was to have an ad
jutant and committee appointed at
each educational institution, which
would organize as a co-operative unit
of the bureau. Through questionnaires
and otherwise the adjutants kept on
file accurate and adequate information
iof students and alumni, so that the
calls from the Washington office of
the bureau could be answered, by
sending nanies of men who were fit
and who could serve the government.
Success has been brought by the ad
jutants. Those institutions which have
helped most, and in turn have been
strengthened most, have their adju
tants to thank. The extensive work
of the Washington office was made
possible by devoted young volunteers
from a dozen colleges, who gave their
time and expenses while carrying the
bureau into government departments.
After a while the committees of col
lege men were organized because of
the large number of desirable and
available men in the cities.

The past is encouraging, but the
future is larger and broader. Calls
from the government—very important
ones —continue to come in, and this
primary work will go on. Industrial
and commercial establishments are
calling for help, and their necessities
are hardly secondary to those of the
government.
A month ago several persons asked,
"How about helping the boys get back
into business when they come home?"
"Why does not the bureau undertake
this?" Arrangements have been
made with the American University
Union of Europe to do this great task
jointly. The union offices in Europe
will be those of the bureau, and the
bureau offices here will be those of I
the union. The union will register |
men who are about to come home, as !
much in advance as possible, and will
send their qualifications and desires
for the future to the bureau here,
which will try to have a place for
them when they arrive. The bureau
will be ready to steer those who have
been severely injured and may have
1 to adopt new activities. The men will

come back to a different country from
the one they left, and it will be the
work of the bureau to make them ac
quainted with the new conditions and
help them to get a good and prompt
start at rebuilding.
Some time ago it was suggested by
prominent college men that the bu
reau should look forward to a perma
nent existence as the co-ordinating or
ganization for all college employment
bureaus. This may be expected, but
can be given only a passing thought
at present.
For all this activity a larger organi
zation has been planned. The execu
tive committee has been increased to
give a broader representation and fu
ture support.
Miss Louise Sheppard of Vassar
comes to the Washington office to or
ganize'an adequate response to the de
mand for college women which is in
creasing in extent and importance.
A division of information will supply
special information which may be
asked for by college officers. It will
mail a weekly letter which will put
[ college officers everywhere in close
| and immediate contact with whatever
development has occurred which
j would seem of importance in the plan-
I ning of college activities during and
I after the war.
A larger division of service calls
| will keep a close relation with the
personnel needs of government de
partments, and of private business
serving the government, and trans
; mit them to the adjutants.
A division of records and organiza
i tion will serve the adjutants in the
j colleges and cities so as to make their
j work more effective. It will also plan
I to follow up all recommendations, re
j cording and reporting to the adjutant
j acceptances and rejections.
The two latter divisions will jointly
handle the cases of returning collegi
ate soldiers, and attend to other busi
ness from the American University
j Union in Europe. To assist this work
j plans are under way to have a New
York office of call for the convenience
of the men when they land.
Money is necessary, and there is 110
hesitancy in asking for it. The work
is for the government, for the col
! leges and for college men. The
| men who have offered themselves for
! their country have a right to expect
j help in making up for the time lost by
, getting re-established in industry at
the earliest possible moment.
The budget of the bureau, in addi
tion to a large amount of volunteer
help, is $2,000 per month. Any col
lege, university or technical school
may become a member of the bureau
; by paying $50, $150 or $250, each in
stitution deciding for itself which of
j the three amounts is proper. The
j money may be paid directly by the in
stitution. or by some of its friends,
I but can be received only with the con
sent of its president.
In addition to the membership fee.
1 trustees' groups of alumni, or indi
vidual alumni, are asked to undertake
| the raising of funds somewhat pro
portionate in size to their alumni pop
ulation and wealth. Several alumni
groups of large universities have un
derwritten funds of $2500 each, and
groups from a number of smaller ones
will supply funds down to $250.
The bureau invites all college men
to call at the Washington office, which
is now in the Munsey building. It is not
an employment bureau, however, and
places applicants only 011 the recom
mendation of adjutants. Nevertheless,
it is glad to give suggestions and in

NEW WORK FOR INTERCOLLEGI
ATE INTELLIGENCE BUREAU
Since February, 1917, nearly one
j hundred and fifty colleges, technical
schools and universities organized as
the Intercollegiate Intelligence Bu
j reau, having been giving special aid
! to the country in its greatest crisis.
| Brought into existence almost at the
direct request of the Secretaries of
War and the Navy, the bureau has
| been warmly received and greatly
I used by government departments.
About four thousand men of special
j ized training have been placed at im
' portant war work on the request of
; government officers for men having a
variety of training and experience.
In a number of cases the bureau
served when other sources had failed.
The method used was to have an ad
jutant and committee appointed at
each educational institution, which
would organize as a co-operative unit
of the bureau. Through questionnaires
and otherwise the adjutants kept on
file accurate and adequate information
iof students and alumni, so that the
calls from the Washington office of
the bureau could be answered, by
sending nanies of men who were fit
and who could serve the government.
Success has been brought by the ad
jutants. Those institutions which have
helped most, and in turn have been
strengthened most, have their adju
tants to thank. The extensive work
of the Washington office was made
possible by devoted young volunteers
from a dozen colleges, who gave their
time and expenses while carrying the
bureau into government departments.
After a while the committees of col
lege men were organized because of
the large number of desirable and
available men in the cities.

The past is encouraging, but the
future is larger and broader. Calls
from the government—very important
ones —continue to come in, and this
primary work will go on. Industrial
and commercial establishments are
calling for help, and their necessities
are hardly secondary to those of the
government.
A month ago several persons asked,
"How about helping the boys get back
into business when they come home?"
"Why does not the bureau undertake
this?" Arrangements have been
made with the American University
Union of Europe to do this great task
jointly. The union offices in Europe
will be those of the bureau, and the
bureau offices here will be those of I
the union. The union will register |
men who are about to come home, as !
much in advance as possible, and will
send their qualifications and desires
for the future to the bureau here,
which will try to have a place for
them when they arrive. The bureau
will be ready to steer those who have
been severely injured and may have
1 to adopt new activities. The men will

come back to a different country from
the one they left, and it will be the
work of the bureau to make them ac
quainted with the new conditions and
help them to get a good and prompt
start at rebuilding.
Some time ago it was suggested by
prominent college men that the bu
reau should look forward to a perma
nent existence as the co-ordinating or
ganization for all college employment
bureaus. This may be expected, but
can be given only a passing thought
at present.
For all this activity a larger organi
zation has been planned. The execu
tive committee has been increased to
give a broader representation and fu
ture support.
Miss Louise Sheppard of Vassar
comes to the Washington office to or
ganize'an adequate response to the de
mand for college women which is in
creasing in extent and importance.
A division of information will supply
special information which may be
asked for by college officers. It will
mail a weekly letter which will put
[ college officers everywhere in close
| and immediate contact with whatever
development has occurred which
j would seem of importance in the plan-
I ning of college activities during and
I after the war.
A larger division of service calls
| will keep a close relation with the
personnel needs of government de
partments, and of private business
serving the government, and trans
; mit them to the adjutants.
A division of records and organiza
i tion will serve the adjutants in the
j colleges and cities so as to make their
j work more effective. It will also plan
I to follow up all recommendations, re
j cording and reporting to the adjutant
j acceptances and rejections.
The two latter divisions will jointly
handle the cases of returning collegi
ate soldiers, and attend to other busi
ness from the American University
j Union in Europe. To assist this work
j plans are under way to have a New
York office of call for the convenience
of the men when they land.
Money is necessary, and there is 110
hesitancy in asking for it. The work
is for the government, for the col
! leges and for college men. The
| men who have offered themselves for
! their country have a right to expect
j help in making up for the time lost by
, getting re-established in industry at
the earliest possible moment.
The budget of the bureau, in addi
tion to a large amount of volunteer
help, is $2,000 per month. Any col
lege, university or technical school
may become a member of the bureau
; by paying $50, $150 or $250, each in
stitution deciding for itself which of
j the three amounts is proper. The
j money may be paid directly by the in
stitution. or by some of its friends,
I but can be received only with the con
sent of its president.
In addition to the membership fee.
1 trustees' groups of alumni, or indi
vidual alumni, are asked to undertake
| the raising of funds somewhat pro
portionate in size to their alumni pop
ulation and wealth. Several alumni
groups of large universities have un
derwritten funds of $2500 each, and
groups from a number of smaller ones
will supply funds down to $250.
The bureau invites all college men
to call at the Washington office, which
is now in the Munsey building. It is not
an employment bureau, however, and
places applicants only 011 the recom
mendation of adjutants. Nevertheless,
it is glad to give suggestions and in
formation which may be of interest
to college men and women.
The bureau needs a certain amount
of volunteer help of a very high class.
It cannot possibly pay any of its work
ers adequately, but the work is won
derfully interesting and gives most
valuable experience.
