# R.M. Jones, '2O, Leaves For Government Service
## 
### 
R. M. Jones, '20, loft last night for
Los Angeles, where he will remain for
a few days before going to Washing
ton to enter the government foreign
service. As announced in The Daily
Palo Alto last Friday, Jones has re
ceived an appointment to a govern
ment position in Europe, and will
leave this country some time next
month.
The future of the campus adminis
tration is as yet undecided, as Jones
was doing practically all the work,
and, owing to his sudden departure,
made no provision for a successor.
Associate Professor 11. C. Moreno of
the Applied Mathematics department
is campus representative of Frank L.
Merritt, state food administrator, but
who will do the work of advising and
in some cases actually managing the
affairs of the living groups, has not
yet been decided.
