# Wear Your Rubbers On Quad Tomorrow
## 
### 
Sentimentality (or slush) will be
the main attraction (or detraction,
depending upon how one looks at it)
of the Valentine issue of Chaparral,
which will be on sale tomorrow on the
Quad. A bewitching maid in glow
ing colors on a huge heart decks the
cover page, drawn by R. C. Alexan
der, '21.
February issue of Chaparral is
graced with two frontispieces. Prob
ably the editor could not decide upon
which was the worst of the two evils,
so he used them both. They are val
entines done by It. D. Taylor and by
W. E. Antrim, the latter being the
best example yet published of
"Monk's inimitable style." There is
also a double page drawing of some
"valentines you would like to get, and
some you would like to send," done
by the same artist.
Woman's sphere of influence is
spreading even in Chappie's domains.
Two new women contributors appear
in this issue, namely, Miss Dorothy
Plummer, '19, and Miss Lucy Lang
don, '19.
Editorially, Chappie does not forget
his old antagonist, California. He
also welcomes the quartet of new men
just initiated into Hammer and Coffin,
M. L. Levy, '19, A. S. Glikbarg, '19, J.
W. Gafney, '20, and Durward Howes,
'20.
Other contributors to this issue of
Chaparral are R. A. Donaldson, '17,
