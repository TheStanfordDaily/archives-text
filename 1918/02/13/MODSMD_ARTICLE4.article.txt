## 
### 
Returns of the amounts of money ;

campaign by all of the sororities but
one on the campus have been received.

$120.51. This represents an approxi
mate average of 75 cents per person.
The estimate is not yet complete, as
the campaign will continue through
out the week and the total number
of cards signed and amount of money
subscribed will be undoubtedly much
greater by the end of the week. Many
women in the houses were found to
be already subscribers and are there
fore not included in the returns of
this canvass.
Thrift cards were placed in the j
hands of the Stanford Service Club at !
its meeting last night for distribution
among the men. Men who did not re
ceive their cards last night will get
them today. In case any student
should not. receive a card through the
campaign officials he may obtain one
at the Bookstore.
Information regarding the stamps
may be obtained at the postofflee and
at the Bookstore or from any of the
solicitors among the women or men,
or from members of the thrift card
committee. Mrs. F. M. MacFarland,
who has been asked by the county
women's committee of the national j
Council of Defense to oversee this
campaign, is also ready to answer any
questions that may arise.
The final returns of the campaign
will be computed on a percentage

to make loans to their government.
To see how much money can be raised
is not the essential factor.
