# SERVICE FLAG TO BE GIVEN STANFORD BY WOMEN
## WILL HANG IN CHURCH Number of Men and Women in Service To Be Placed On Single Star 
### 
A Stanford service flag is to be the
contribution oÂ£ the "500" to honor the
Stanford men who are in service.
Plans to secure the flag have been
completed by the Women's War Emer
gency Committee and all the women's
living groups are heartily co-operat
ing.
The flag will be strictly a Stanford
product. The design has been sub
mitted by Pedro J. Lemos, curator of
the Thomas Welton Stanford Art Mu
seum, and the flag is to be made of
the best satin obtainable. When com
pleted by the Art department it will
be 12 feet long by 9 feet wide and it
is said will be the finest in the
United States.
Design is Novel.
The banner will follow the general
outline of the established service flag,
with a red border around a blue field.
Within this blue is a white field and
on this a single star on which will be
placed the number of men in service.
This number will be changed each
month as more men enlist. The United
States seal will be placed at one end
of the red border and the Stanford
seal at the other.
The flag will hang in the Memorial
Church from a gold spear, and accord
ing to present plans of the committee
will be presented by the women to
the University on Pounders' Day.
Women commuters who are not in
touch with any campus organization
can pay their subscriptions to the fund
for the University service flag tomor
row in the rest room from 10 to 1.
