# Sophomore Show to Have Full House
## Last Dress Rehearsal Comes Tonightâ€”Success of Play Assured 
### 
Sophomore players will stage their
dress rehearsal of "It Pays to Adver
tise" tonight. All is in readiness for
the final production Friday night.
Coach Mathieu is well pleased with the
progress of the members of the cast,
and promises a treat to all.
A big seat sale has already assured
a full lumse, but a few more good seats
are left and are expected to be taken
before Friday. War conditions have
not affected playgoers, and a greater
attendance than ever before seen at
a sophomore play is expected to wit
ness the Friday night production.
