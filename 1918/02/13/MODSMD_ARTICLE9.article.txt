# PLAYERS' CLUB TO GIVE BENEFIT FOR CLINICS TOMORROW
## 
### 
Four of the most successful one-act
plays produced by the San Francisco
Players' Club will make up the pro
gram for the performance to be given
tomorrow night in the city as a benefit
for the Stanford clinics. The Scottish
Rite Auditorium stage will be used.
These playlets are "The Merry
Death" and "I3ig Kate," both written
by Russians; "Ruby Red," an Ori
ental comedy, and "Joint Owners in
Spain," a humoresque on life in an
old ladies' home.
In"The Merry Death" will appear
William S. Rainey and Miss Dorothy
Wetmore as Pierrot and Columbine,
Dion it. Holm as Harlequin, Mrs. Mary
Latter as Death, and Arthur Keith as
the doctor. This is said to be the
most picturesque offering of the Play
ers' Club, which is composed of the
leading stage amateurs ol' San Fran
cisco.
"Big Kate" will present Mrs. A. I.
Gump, R. W. Adams, Raine Bennett,
Howard Miller, and Miss Carolyn
Green. In setting and costume this
playlet will reproduce the fashion of
1780, the period of Katherine of Rus
sia's reign.
Those in charge of the benefit hope
for a large attendance from the cam
pus and Palo Alto. The tickets are $1
and $1.50, including the war tax.
