Km Im»s Off-Color.
The freshman team was off color
last night. They did not use team
work to the best advantage, and tried
dribbling rather than passing to get
the ball down the floor. As a result
they had practically no shots at the
goal from close quarters. Fairchilds
and Phelps were the best men for the
Cardinal. Fairchilds shot six baskets
and converted the majority of fouls,
while Phelps guarded in good shape.
For California, Wetter, Symes, and
Majors covered the floor in a manner
that kept the Cardinal men bewildered
most of the time. Symes was respon
sible for six field goals, Wetter made
three, and Majors shot one.
Varsity Wins.
Tiie Varsity took the University of
Nevada down the line in rather a slow
game. The Cardinal players seemed
to be loafing for the California garne
unless it was necessary for them to
put on a spurt to take the lead.
Schwarzenbok, Hood, and Butt all
showed to advantage in the game.
Schwarzenbek especially was in every
play. Williamson, who substituted
for him, played a good game. Moulton
was not shooting in good shape last
night, and only rang up one basket.
The half-time score was 11 to 11
but the Varsity opened up at the be
ginning of the second period and put
the game on ice.
