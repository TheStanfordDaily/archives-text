# NEED FOR FOOD CONSERVATION
## 
### 
House managers and all individuals who are striving to line up the
various groups on the campus for food conservation will be aided consid
erably in their efforts by a careful study of the recommendations made in
last night's issue of The Daily Palo Alto by Professor Moreno, representa
tive of the food administration.
With little exception the entire campus is backing the Hoover food ad
ministration to the best of its ability, but lack of a full understanding of
the aims of the administration handicaps the effectiveness of the attempt
to achieve these aims. For instanct, most managers thought that their duty
in the wheat-saving line ended when they substituted graham bread for
the white-flour variety. This might have been all right a few weeks ago,
but by February 24 the whitest of the white bread sold by any baker will
contain eighty per cent wheat, the same amount that goes into graham
bread. Use of the "war" loves, which contain between thirty and forty per
cent of wheat, will become necessary and the wheatless meals and days
should also be observed as far as possible.
Most groups observe porkless day about six out of the seven days of
the week, we have observed, so but little additional saving of pork products
is necessary. Every person and every group, however, must cut down,
even more than now, in the amount of sugar and butter used, and this in
many cases will prove the hardest sacrifice of all. Managers should also
see that their cooks use vegetable instead of animal fats.
