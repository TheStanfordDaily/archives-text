# Y.M.C.A. LEADERS DISCUSS PLANS FOR COMING CAMPAIGN
## 
### 
More than twenty local Y. M. C. A.
leaders gathered for a luncheon at
the Stanford Inn yesterday to discuss
with Gale Seaman, coast secretary of
the Y. M. C. A., plans for a drive for
the enlistment of Stanford students
in study classes. The movement is a
national one, being undertaken by all
the colleges in the United States and
those in Canada as well.
"The Principles Underlying a
Christian Democracy" is the name of
the course which will lie discussed in
the classes. In presenting the plans
to those at the meeting yesterday, Mr.
Seaman said: "The philosophy and
the educational system of the past, at
least that taught in Germany, has had
many defects. The present war is
being fought to decide what princi
ples shall govern the relations of na
tions toward each other in the future.
"We hear," he said, "a great deal
about the principles for which the
United Slates is now fighting for, yet
how few people know what these prin
ciples really are. This war is chang
ing everything and the spread of
democracy after the war depends in a
large part on the way people are ed
ucated along democratic lines. We
who remain at home owe it to those
at the front to perpetuate the princi
ples for which they are fighting and
offering their lives.
"The Y. M. C. A. proposes to help
do this by enlisting lioo,ooo, which is
one-third of all the college students
in America, in small informal study
classes."
The same work is being undertaken
in the army and last week 6,000 men
at Camp Lewis were enrolled in these
classes. Stanford's share in the
movement will be 300 men and 250
women. The work is being thoroughly
organized this week before any at
tempt to establish classes is made.
Classes will be under the supervis
ion of faculty or student leaders and
it is the aim of the Y. M. C. A. to put
one or more classes in every living
group on the Row, and a number in
Encina, Roble, and Palo Alto. Var
ious members of the local cabinet
spoke at the meeting yesterday and
offered their hearty support to the
proposition.

"The Y. M. C. A. proposes to help
do this by enlisting lioo,ooo, which is
one-third of all the college students
in America, in small informal study
classes."
The same work is being undertaken
in the army and last week 6,000 men
at Camp Lewis were enrolled in these
classes. Stanford's share in the
movement will be 300 men and 250
women. The work is being thoroughly
organized this week before any at
tempt to establish classes is made.
Classes will be under the supervis
ion of faculty or student leaders and
it is the aim of the Y. M. C. A. to put
one or more classes in every living
group on the Row, and a number in
Encina, Roble, and Palo Alto. Var
ious members of the local cabinet
spoke at the meeting yesterday and
offered their hearty support to the
proposition.
More than twenty local Y. M. C. A.
leaders gathered for a luncheon at
the Stanford Inn yesterday to discuss
with Gale Seaman, coast secretary of
the Y. M. C. A., plans for a drive for
the enlistment of Stanford students
in study classes. The movement is a
national one, being undertaken by all
the colleges in the United States and
those in Canada as well.
"The Principles Underlying a
Christian Democracy" is the name of
the course which will lie discussed in
the classes. In presenting the plans
to those at the meeting yesterday, Mr.
Seaman said: "The philosophy and
the educational system of the past, at
least that taught in Germany, has had
many defects. The present war is
being fought to decide what princi
ples shall govern the relations of na
tions toward each other in the future.
"We hear," he said, "a great deal
about the principles for which the
United Slates is now fighting for, yet
how few people know what these prin
ciples really are. This war is chang
ing everything and the spread of
democracy after the war depends in a
large part on the way people are ed
ucated along democratic lines. We
who remain at home owe it to those
at the front to perpetuate the princi
