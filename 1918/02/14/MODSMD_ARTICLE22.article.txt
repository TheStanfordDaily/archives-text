# MURRAY TELLS OF CHRISTMAS PARTY IN WAR DISTRICT
## 
### 
Word has reached the campus of a
Christmas party that "Feg" Murray,
'16, and "Hay" Murray, '17, save the
children of Grundy, in northern
France. The former Stanford ath
' letes, sons of Professor A. T. Murray,
are members of a reconstruction unit
j of the Society of Friends* working in
the devastated district of France, re
building houses and helping with the
preparation of crops.
"P>ay" writes: "The day before
Christmas we had a party for the
children, and it was a wonderful suc
cess from all points of view, and I
have never enjoyed anything as much
as 1 did the first sight i had of the
schoolhouse just before the party
began! The eagerly expectant kid
dies were ranged on two rows of
benches with their eyes just feasting
on the piles of presents beneath the
j Christmas tree.
"We had decorated the schoolhouse
as best we could with greens, and
flags, and tree decorations, and it
really looked quite well. The whole
j town was at the party, and we hardly
recognized all of our neighbors, so be
decked were they in their fine raiment.
We had a sort of musical and magical
program and the children gave a num-
I ber of songs and recitations, and alto
gether it was quite interesting. After
we had handed out the presents—
| sweaters, mittens, caps, knives, socks,
I books, etc., —two of the girls read
!'compliments' or words of thanks, and
I gratitude that was most impressive.
"It was the first Christmas these
j poor people had celebrated since 1913,
j because the Bochos were among them
the last three years. Since that day
jour house has been a rendezvous of
youngsters of all ages and sizes, each
one eager to show his or her presents,
and about every one reads a 'compli
ment,' too, so wo have quite a collec
i tion of them."
