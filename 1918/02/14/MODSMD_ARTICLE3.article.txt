# Experts huff led in Wild Pursuit of "Betty's Boots"
## 
### 
A startling robbery was brought to
light on the campus today with the
announcement that Miss Elizabeth
Mail, '20, is being held by the authori
ties as a suspect in the disappearance
of a pair of diamond slippers owned
by a certain well known campus per
sonage whose name is not divulged.
Miss Mail declined to discuss the mat
ter.
There is a rumor afloat that Miss
Teresa Hihn, '19, and C. T. Littleton,
'20, know more about the robbery than
they have revealed, and the implica
tion of Miss Beatrice Flett, '20, and
Arthur Wills, '19, promises to make
the matter more interesting.
C. L. McCormick, *19, and Miss Mar
ion Brown, '20, who are also impli
cated in the plot in some mysterious
manner, have both refused to say any
thing at all about the theft, and J. S.
Doron, '19, and M. L. Levy, '19, de
clare that they "don't know nothin'
about it." â€¢
Interest was added to the affair with
the disappearance of L. L. Pickering,
'20, from the campus, but Pickering is
now known to be confined to the Iso
lation Hospital with a case of measles.
However, the authorities promise
some startling developments in the
case, as the whole affair will be
cleared up shortly, and on March 7 it
is guaranteed that the whole campus
will know who became possessed of
"Betty's Hoots."
