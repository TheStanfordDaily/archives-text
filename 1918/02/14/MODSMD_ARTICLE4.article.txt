# Sequoia to Feature Articles by Writers Serving "Over There''
## 
### 
Tomorrow morning, rain or shine,
wet or dry, stay-at-home co-eds not
withstanding, The Stanford Sequoia
! will be sold on the Quad. Long in
'coming, but at last due, "Lance" War
j ren's "Trip to the Trenches" will
appear in print (for the first time);
j "The Beast," "The Undertow," and
other stories appear under the same
I cover. "The Beast" is a weird, un
j canny story of animal life, the kind
I seldom seen in college journalism.
|"The Little White Tree," an unsigned
j essay, is of a distinctly unusual type,
and will cause considerable comment.
.Much verse for gentle readers will
come forth in this issue; more serious
I articles are also included, such as
j Dr. Jordan's "The Problem of Nation
alityâ€”Discipline or Freedom," dealing
J with Germany and the war; and an
j entertaining account of "Athens in
! Wartime," by Burnet Wohlford, who is
l now serving in Greece with a Stan
! lord ambulance unit.
