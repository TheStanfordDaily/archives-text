# STANFORD- CALIFORNIA QUINTETS READY FOR WHISTLE OF REFEREE
## 
### 
Second place in the California-
Nevada League as well as a win over
the University of California will be at
stake when the Varsities from Berk
eley and Stanford hook up in the first
of a three-game basketball series on
Encina court tonight at 8 o'clock.
From the dope Stanford has better
than a "fighting chance" to hang up a
defeat on the Blue and Gold basket
shooters, but the dope may go wrong
at any time and the score switch to
the Berkeley men.
California Confident.
Over at California they are confident
that they can defeat Stanford, basing
their argument on the fact that they
defeated the College of Pacific 39 to
12 while Stanford won from the same
team 45 to IS. The reason for this
difference in score was that the San
Jose team was a bunch of rookies ac
cording to the California authorities.
Stanford has a fast, clever basket
hall team and if it plays the brand of
ball they have put up in the majority of
games this season, California will be
a few miles in the rear of the team
when the final whistle is blown.
Moulton and Hood, who will hold

down the forward berths, have played
together for two years and know each
other's play thoroughly, in addition to
being accurate shots. Schwarzenbek
at center looks to be the fastest man
on the team and a dead shot under
the basket, while Butt and Parks at
guard are two of the best men around
this part of the country. The only
necessity is that the men get together
and play as they know how to play*
St. Mary's Leads League.
According to the present ranking in
the California-Nevada League, St.
Mary's is leading with Stanford in
J second place. In case they can win
i from California tonight the Cardinal
J players will hold that position per
j manently, while if California wins
! she can go into the lead by taking
; Nevada into her bag.
That the game tonight will be fast is
assured by the fact that Managers
Sullivan and Booth have arranged for
Referee Boek to handle the whistle in
the game.
Admission for the affair is 50 cents
, for both members and non-members of
! the student body, while enlisted men
i may pass the gate for 25 cents.

of a three-game basketball series on
Encina court tonight at 8 o'clock.
From the dope Stanford has better
than a "fighting chance" to hang up a
defeat on the Blue and Gold basket
shooters, but the dope may go wrong
at any time and the score switch to
the Berkeley men.
California Confident.
Over at California they are confident
that they can defeat Stanford, basing
their argument on the fact that they
defeated the College of Pacific 39 to
12 while Stanford won from the same
team 45 to IS. The reason for this
difference in score was that the San
Jose team was a bunch of rookies ac
cording to the California authorities.
Stanford has a fast, clever basket
hall team and if it plays the brand of
ball they have put up in the majority of
games this season, California will be
a few miles in the rear of the team
when the final whistle is blown.
Moulton and Hood, who will hold

down the forward berths, have played
together for two years and know each
other's play thoroughly, in addition to
being accurate shots. Schwarzenbek
at center looks to be the fastest man
on the team and a dead shot under
the basket, while Butt and Parks at
guard are two of the best men around
this part of the country. The only
necessity is that the men get together
and play as they know how to play*
St. Mary's Leads League.
According to the present ranking in
the California-Nevada League, St.
Mary's is leading with Stanford in
J second place. In case they can win
i from California tonight the Cardinal
J players will hold that position per
j manently, while if California wins
! she can go into the lead by taking
; Nevada into her bag.
That the game tonight will be fast is
assured by the fact that Managers
Sullivan and Booth have arranged for
Referee Boek to handle the whistle in
the game.
Admission for the affair is 50 cents
, for both members and non-members of
! the student body, while enlisted men
i may pass the gate for 25 cents.
