# 1920 PLAY SUCCESS ASSURED
## Mathieu Predicts Unusual Performance 
### 
Marked by an excellent show of
spirit mid by the cast's taking bold
and putting the thing through, last
night's dress rehearsal of "It Pays to
Advertise," the 1920 play, was a de
cided success. Coacn Mathieu was
well pleased with the showing made,
and states that be has no doubt as to
the success of the play.
"It Pays to Advertise" is a snappy
comedy of Broadway finance, that has
made a successful run of the country
on the professional stage. The mem
bers of the cast of the sophomore play
have shown themselves well fitted for
the essentially modern parts they are
to portray. In the part of Rodney
Martin, the wayward young rich man's
son, J. T. Boyle will undoubtedly be

successful. E. B. Harper, as Cyrus
Martin, his father, takes the part of
the conservative business man of the
old school. Mary Largent, in the lead
as Miss Grayson, his secretary, acts
with a pleasing grace.
Frank Sloman, as Ambrose Peale,
is the comedy producer of the play.
Merlin Maynard in the part of Kllery
Clark, the son of a rival soap manu
facturer, Margaret Shedd as the
] Countess de lieaurean, Helen Onserud
as Marie, the French maid, Martha
I Smith as Miss Burke, the clerk,
Major White in the part of McChesney,
.1. T. McMenamin as Johnson, the but
ler, Verne Langford as Mr. Smith, and
| Hawley Mertz in the part of Bronson,


"Why <lo von cat lien's ey?rs?" Ambrose I'eale (Frank Sloiiiiin, '20, in tlic
picture) solves this engrossing problem for lioriuey .Martin (.1. T. 110j1c,'20.)
the representative of Marshall Field's
concern, are all well fitted for their
parts.
The plot of the comedy centers
about the effort of Cyrus Martin to
get his reckless son Rodney to go
to work. He is aided in this attempt
by Miss Grayson, his secretary, with
whom Rodney falls in love. Martin,
Senior, orders his son to give up the
secretary or leave the house, and
Rodney chooses the latter alternative.
He, however, gets Miss Grayson to
accompany him as his secretary (she
being instructed by Cyrus Martin to
keep him on his job), and with the as
sistance of one Ambrose Peale, an ad
vertising specialist, he starts a soap
concern in opposition to his father's,
and advertises "13 Soap, Unlucky for
Dirt," extensively. After numerous
complications, Rodney forces his
father to buy out the business, recon
ciliation between father and son is ac
complished, and Cupid brings in his
licks between Rodney and Miss Gray
son for a pleasing finish to the clever
plot.
There are a few seats left at "Wein
gartner's drug store in Palo Alto. The
seat sale for tomorrow's production
has been the largest of the college
year.
