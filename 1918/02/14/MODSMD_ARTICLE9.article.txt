"Industrial Fatigue" will be the sub
ject of an interesting lecture by Pro
fessor E. (5. Martin, head of the Phy
siology department, tonight, in the
Physiology building lecture room, at
7:30. The lecture, which is the same
as that given at Lane Hospital re
cently, is to be delivered under the
auspices of the Physiology Club.

For some time, Professor Martin has
studied this subject, as for three
months he has been engaged in gov
ernment work in the east, studying
industrial fatigue in the factories as
applied to the workmen and their fam
ilies. The address will be of partic
ular interest to Economics, Psychol
ogy, and Physiology majors, but the
general public is invited.
