# VARSITY FIVE DEFEATS CALIFORNIA TEAM 22-18
## BUTT AT GUARD AND MOULTON ARE STARS FOR STANFORD Berkeley Men Fail to Fake Advantage of Their Chances 
### H.G. Swendsen, '20 
Stanford fulfilled expectations by
defeating California in the first of a
three-game series last night, 22 to 18,
in the fastest, hardest fought game
that has been seen on Encina court
this season. The Cardinal combina
tion used their chances for goals
while California seemed helpless un
der their basket most of the time,
which resulted in the victory. In the
last minute of play the Blue and Gold
succeeded in coming within one bas
ket of tying the score, but a basket
and two foul goals by Moulton put
the game on ice.
Kutt Stars.
Butt, at guard, was the big factor
in keeping the California score down,
although Parks was not far behind his
team-mate. At forward Moulton put
up a stellar brand of ball both in the
guarding and shooting division.
Schwarzenbek, at center, lived up to
promise by covering the floor con
sistently while shooting three field
goals, all from difficult positions.
California Leads.
California took the lead in the first
few minutes with a field goal and a
foul shot, but Stanford came back and
tied the score when the Varsity got
safely under way. The count was 5
all, then 6 all, but Schwarzenbek came
through with his second lfasket in the
last few minutes of the half and put
the Cardinal in the lead at half-time,
8 to 6.
With the opening of the second half
Hood was forced to go out on account
of a bad shoulder and Bucklin went in.
The substitution did not affect the
Varsity's play, however, and they had
increased their lead to 14 to 7 before
California found itself. The Blue and
Gold then took a spurt, and came up
until the count stood 1G to 12, when
a sensational goal by Parks from the
middle of the floor put Stanford
safely in the lead again.
The two teams battled neck and
neck, with the board showing IS to
12, until the last few minutes, when
Coach Wilson sent in Johannsen, who
broke up the Cardinal combination
and allowed California to make her
score 18 points. Moulton saved the
day, however, with two foul baskets
and a field goal and put Stanford on
the long end.
Stanford was forced to use three
substitutions. Hood replaced Schwar
zenbek at forward when Williamson
broke his thumb and was taken out
from center, with Schwarzenbek tak
ing his place. After a few minutes,
Hood was thrown on the floor by a
California man and was replaced by
Hucklin when he severely wrenched
his shoulder. In the last minute
Johannsen replaced Parks. For Cali
fornia, Beresford replaced Cuffc, who
could not get under way, while Greene
was taken out for Kegler when the
former made four personal fouls.

Summary—Substitutions: Stanford,

Referee —Sperry.
Stanford fulfilled expectations by
defeating California in the first of a
three-game series last night, 22 to 18,
in the fastest, hardest fought game
that has been seen on Encina court
this season. The Cardinal combina
tion used their chances for goals
while California seemed helpless un
der their basket most of the time,
which resulted in the victory. In the
last minute of play the Blue and Gold
succeeded in coming within one bas
ket of tying the score, but a basket
and two foul goals by Moulton put
the game on ice.
Kutt Stars.
Butt, at guard, was the big factor
in keeping the California score down,
although Parks was not far behind his
team-mate. At forward Moulton put
up a stellar brand of ball both in the
guarding and shooting division.
Schwarzenbek, at center, lived up to
promise by covering the floor con
sistently while shooting three field
goals, all from difficult positions.
California Leads.
California took the lead in the first
few minutes with a field goal and a
foul shot, but Stanford came back and
tied the score when the Varsity got
safely under way. The count was 5
all, then 6 all, but Schwarzenbek came
through with his second lfasket in the
last few minutes of the half and put
the Cardinal in the lead at half-time,
8 to 6.
With the opening of the second half
Hood was forced to go out on account
of a bad shoulder and Bucklin went in.
The substitution did not affect the
Varsity's play, however, and they had
increased their lead to 14 to 7 before
California found itself. The Blue and
Gold then took a spurt, and came up
until the count stood 1G to 12, when
a sensational goal by Parks from the
middle of the floor put Stanford
safely in the lead again.
The two teams battled neck and
neck, with the board showing IS to
12, until the last few minutes, when
Coach Wilson sent in Johannsen, who
broke up the Cardinal combination
and allowed California to make her
score 18 points. Moulton saved the
day, however, with two foul baskets
and a field goal and put Stanford on
the long end.
Stanford was forced to use three
substitutions. Hood replaced Schwar
zenbek at forward when Williamson
broke his thumb and was taken out
from center, with Schwarzenbek tak
ing his place. After a few minutes,
Hood was thrown on the floor by a
California man and was replaced by
Hucklin when he severely wrenched
his shoulder. In the last minute
Johannsen replaced Parks. For Cali
fornia, Beresford replaced Cuffc, who
could not get under way, while Greene
was taken out for Kegler when the
former made four personal fouls.
