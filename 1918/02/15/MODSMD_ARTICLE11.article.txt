## TRACK TEAM MAY MAKE TRIP SOUTH Informal Squad Competition Scheduled for Saturday Morning at 10:15 
### 
Following the custom inaugurated
lust year of holding the annual Irish
Marathon early in the year, rather
than waiting to make it part of the
festivities of Junior Week, track cap
tain A. F. Wilson last evening an
nounced that the event will be
held on February 22, Washington's
Birthday, which is a legal holiday.
Teams from all of the four classes are
expected to enter the event, which
always brings .forth great class riv
alry.
Teams Miij lie Keduced. i
If an insufficient number of men
turn out, because of war time scar
city, the teams may be reduced from
the usual number of twenty-four men
to a suitable substitute number. Each
man runs a quarter-mile in the Mara
thon, so all men in any of the classes
who have run the distance under 70
seconds, are urged to try for their
class teams. Timers will be on hand
all next week to conduct tryouts and
get official dope on all competitors
for the class teams. The entire track
squad, and others as well, are asked
to train for the Marathon during the
coming week.
First Formal Event.
The Marathon will be the first for
mal event of the track year, as the
meet scheduled for the Stanford oval
on February 21 is to be between Fre
mont men only. However, prospects
for competition for the team are
brightening, since, according to in
definite announcement, Graduate Man
ager O. M. Sullivan is working on
plans for a team trip south some
time in March. Negotiations are un
der way with the University of South
ern California and the Los Angeles
Athletic Club, both of which institu
tions furnished the Cardinal strong
competition last year. Definite word
has not been heard from the south
yet, but the prospect for the trip ought
to add a further incentive to a stronger
turn out for track, according to Cap
tain Wilson.
Another meet of the informal species
will be held Saturday mdrning at
10:15. Despite the character of the
meet, the entire track squad has been
asked to be on hand, whether ready
for competition or not. If the
weather is warm enough the events
will not be shortened, but full dis
tances run. If, however, the weather
man is unkind, competition will be
over shortened distances in every
track event except the 100- and 200-
yard competition.
