						MERITED HONOR

### 
Appointment of H. W. Maloney, lieutenant colonel in the Stanford Re
serve Officers' Training Corps, as diamond athletic director at Camp Fre
mont while causing general regret 011 the part of Stanford men who will
lose his active help in the military work at Stanford, is a source of pride
for all who know Mr. Maloney. The appointment is well merited and we
rejoice in the knowledge that Mr. Maloney will be stationed close enough
to the campus to still be with us frequently and help in the R. O. T. C.
and in Stanford athletics.
Although not a Stanford student himself, Mr. Maloney is as true a
Stanford man at heart as any one who ever received a diploma from this
University. In his active part in turning out various Stanford teams as
trainer or as coach he has done much for Stanford. In his whole-hearted
and enthusiastic support of the R. O. T. C. movement, in which he has
played a prominent part since its inception, he again merits the thanks
or the students of the University. The entire student body joins in con
gratulating him on his new honor.
