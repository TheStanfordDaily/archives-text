ing program by working in ship yards
during the summer months or perma
nently if they so desire.

gency Fleet Corporation of the United
States shipping board and is engaged
in a publicity campaign for recruit
ing ship-builders. From 200,000 to
300,000 additional men are wanted, in
the ship yards during the coming year
and work can be secured at yards in
San Francisco, Philadelphia, Boston,
or Baltimore. t
Most of the positions to be filled are
those actually requiring manual work.

riveters, pipe-fitters, inspectors, and
caulkers are a few of the various
occupations to wliich the men will be
iput. College men are especially want
led and need not have had any great
! amount of previous experience.

day will be paid beginners, who will
be assigned jobs as ship-fitters and
! helpers, with plenty of opportunity
j for men of ability to advance. In
