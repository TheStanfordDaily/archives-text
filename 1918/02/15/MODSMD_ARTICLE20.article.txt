# STANFORD POLICY IN ATHLETICS IS BEST SAYS WRITER
## 
### 
That the other universities of the
country must adopt the athletic pol
icy of general participation pursued
by Stanford, due to the war, is the
conclusion reached by Robin Baily,
Sporting Editor of the San Francisco
Examiner, in an article In the March
Issue of Sunset.
Vindicating the policies of this in
stitution, Haily says:"The war has
*
forced the whole nation to face the'
facts. The pilots of Stanford's ath
letic policy, Doctors Angell and Mur
ray, have encouraged every man on
the campus to play the great outdoor
game's, it is this policy that must be
adopted b> other colleges," concludes
Baily.
Following are quotations from the
article:
"Men of public spirit and vision have
decided that the situation calls for rad
ical readjustments. What lias become
a very general view is expressed by
Dean Frederick Paul Keppel, of Co
lumbia University, and assistant to
Secretary of War Baker. In his an
nual report to the university, in which
he enumerates some of the changes
that the war is likely to work in edu
cational methods, Dean Keppel writes:
"It will involve an increased realiza
tion of the importance of the physical
litness of the group as a whole, as
contrasted with the possession of win
ning teams of specialists.'
"Thus the dean of New York's great
university, under the urge of war,
adopts the idea for which Stanford lias
been lighting for a decade. It has |
long been clearly evident to those who
are interested in the broader phases
of university athletics that the policies
pursued by the leading American col-|
leges could not continue indefinitely.
The war has forced the whole nation
to face the facts. The pilots of Stan- |
ford athletic policy, Doctors Angell
and Murray, have encouraged every
man oi. tire campus to play the great
outdoor games. These pilots of youth
were not primarily prompted by
thought of the physical benefits that
the students will derive. Mere mus
cular development may be acquired
more rapidly in other ways. At Stan
ford it is recognized that the sturdy
give and take of the great games de
velops qualities of heart and mind â€”
self-reliance, courage, a chivalrous
attitude towards opponents and gen
erosity to friends who fail, that will be
sought in vain amidst the mechanical
performance of military evolutions on j
the barrack yard or in exercise with
the apparatus of a gymnasium.
"it is the high ideal of athletics
conceived i;y the philosopher and
teacher, Arnold, that Stanford has
transplanted to the Pacific coast. The
keener perceptions, stimulated by the
necessities of the great war, are
swinging the whole country to the
point of view of this western univer
sity. The army and navy high com
mand are insisting upon general par
ticipation in athletics to a degree
without precedent in the history of
sport. 'Hie* Templeton, champion at !
half a dozen forms of sport, inspired
by the Stanford spirit, is transform
ing 40,000 Texans and Oklahomans
into athletes at San Antonio. What
is happening at this vast camp is
typical of the army posts and dock
yards all over the country. At Mare
Island, on San Francisco bay, famous
tennis players, masters of the dusty
bag-dotted diamond, and warroirs of
the roped ring, are molding sailors
into athletes."
