The writer holds that about i»0 per cent of tliose who are physically nntit for
Military Service may become qualified hy Corrective Exercises.

(Ed. Note—Dr. A. D. Browne, phys
ical director at the Oregon Agricul
tural College, ia one of the foremost
investigators on the coast in regard
to physical education. In this article
he gives the result of his observations
as to the fitness of men in the military
service.)
The new national experience
through which we are now passing
contains no more impressive lesson
for us than that a vast number of
young men between the ages of eigh
teen and thirty are unfit for military
service.
The selection of men for military
service is conducted by the govern
ment for the purpose of assuring suc
cess as nearly as human effort can
guarantee it with the material and
means at hand, and "that human lives
may not be criminally sacrificed."
Physical Fitness Essential.
It is true that in the ordinary occu
pations of life, human lives are not
ordinarily exposed to danger, but is
it not also true that we should assure
success in all our endeavors as nearly
as human effort, can guarantee? What
is worth while doing is worth doing
well.
Success in anything requires the
possession of certain qualities. In the
selection of leaders, such qualities as
mental alertness, accuracy of think
ing and acting, sureness and ease of
carriage, health, etc., should be insist
ed upon. All of these qualities are
influenced more or less by the condi
tion of the body.
.Many I'nfit for Military Service.
It is not exaggerating conditions to
say that the revelations of physical
disability brought out by the govern
ment. survey have been appalling.
Among the four hundred and odd
thousand of applicants at recruiting
stations of the regular army during
the past three years, 76 per cent were
rejected.
Figures for the National Guard
show that out of 128,517 mustered in,
23,721 (18.5 per cent) were found
physically disqualified—this after pre
liminary rejections had been made by
state officials.
Lord Derby reports that in Eng
land 42 per cent of the men of mili
tary age—lS to 40 —were unfit physi

cally and rejected, this in a country
whose needs for man power were im
mediate and pressing.
It is reported that only 54 per cent
of the new United States national
army qualified for training at the can
tonments.
In the United States 1,000,000 males
yearly reach their eighteenth year,
Assuming 54 per cent of this number
as physically fit, would make avail
able only 540,000, a difference of 4G0,-
000 men. This difference might cause
disaster, for it is a well established
principle of war that superiority of
numbers should be sought for.
JMKy .May He declaimed.
It is probably true that at least 90
per cent of these unfit men can be re
claimed within one to six months, and |
that 90 per cent of the total
male population for war service |
can be maintained by a compulsory I
system of physical training.
1 mean, by this, not a course of
training that is confined to any par- \
ticular group or class, nor to a certain j
specified number of periods that may j
be covered in a short time, but a
course that extends throughout the
entire curriculum and of such a high
standard that it bo rated among the
most important subjects taught.
Experience Cited.
How necessary some such step has
become was made very apparent to
me. In August of the past summer
when it was my privilege to go to
Washington, D. C., 1 visited many en
campments and soldier barracks in
this country and Canada. The sight
these young men presented when
stripped was, to use the expression of
an army offic er of high rank whom I
was interviewing, "pathetic."
The appearance of those accepted
for service spoke volumes of the
startling neglect of the bodies of these
young men. Even the appearance of
the college men brought out the start
ling inefflcicncy of the methods em
ployed in our colleges to train the
bodies of students, if any are em
ployed at all.
Fndctnor to Correct Faults.
Every man attending O. A. C. is
given a physical and medical exam
ination for the purpose- of determin
ing his qualifications for military serv

ice and for correcting any defects
which may be remedied by special
physical exercises or medical or sur
gical attention.
The Health Service is rendering ex
cellent service in performing opera
tions for removing disqualifications of
a medical nature. The department of
physical education is conducting cor
rective exercises for those, who at the
present time would be disqualified for
having fiat feet, pronated ankles,
spinal curvatures, hernia, rigid chest,
I etc. By persistent attention to in
structions and regular treatment,
many will be reclaimed before the
sining term, while others with more
- rious . . • liti. ns will be required to
spend more time at work for their
Health Service Cooperates.
Five hundred ninety-five O. A. C.
men have been examined this fall. It
is the opinion of the department that
97 or 1(5 tier cent of those examined
would be rejected if they presented
themselves at the present time for en
listment.
Corrective Exercises Advocated.
Of this number 70 per cent may be
come qualified by corrective exercises
and special work in the department.
Twenty r.ine or 4.9 per cent of the
total number examined would not at
any time satisfy the present require
ments of the United States tests.
Two hundred twenty-six O. A. C.
men are now assigned to the special
classes for corrective work.
This special work for the individ
uals in need of corrective exercises,
along with the program of intra
mural athletics, recreational activi
ties, gymnastics, and intercollegiate
athletics provides a schedule of physi
cal training for making and keeping
all men physically efficient for the call
that may come from the government
for service to our country.
