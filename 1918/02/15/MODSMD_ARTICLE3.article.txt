# OLYMPIC CLUB NINE TO MEET VARSITY TOMORROW
## San Franciscans Are Speedy Combinationâ€”Lifur to Heave for Cardinal 
### 
The Olympic Club of San Francisco
will endeavor to hand their white
wash to the Varsity tomorrow when
the two nines loom up in the regular
week-end game. The battle will start
at 2::>0 on the Cardinal lot. Admis
sion, as usual, will be 25 cents with
A. S. S. IT. cards admitting for 15
cents.
Olympics Are Fast.
The Olympic combination is prob
ably the fastest organization around
the bay. The San Francisco team
took Santa Clara into its bag two
weeks ago, and has defeated several
other fast nines. It should furnish
the Varsity with some real competi
tion.
Gregg Lifur will in all probability
be in the box for Stanford, with Har
vey and Briggs on the sidelines for
safety. Campbell will receive the
benders, with the rest of the team
lining up as usual, Davis on first, Doe
on second, Galloway on short, and
Dickey on third. Wayland, Lilly, and
Knox will hold down the gardens.
