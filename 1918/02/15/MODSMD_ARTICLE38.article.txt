### 
The freshmen secured two hits off
Lifur, while the varsity batters were
only successful in finding the first
year heaver for a single hit.
A good game should result when
the Theta Xi and Theta Delta Chi
teams line up for the last semi-final
battle in the inter-fraternity series.
Both combinations contain varsity
and freshman players and nave put
up a fast brand of ball so far. The
winner will play the team represent
ing Sigma Chi, Delta Chi, and Alpha
Tau Omega.

The Manzanita lads fell before the
freshman second team last night to
the tune of 14 to 5. The feature of
the game was Parker's pitching. After
walking enough men to get the bases
full, he struck out the re
maining men who faced him. The left
hander bagged a home run, a two
bagger, a single and a walk out of
four times at bat.
