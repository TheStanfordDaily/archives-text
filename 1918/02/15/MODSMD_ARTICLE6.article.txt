### 
"It Pays to Advertise" will be the
attraction of tonight when the sopho
mores stage their customary show at
8:15 in the Stanford Assembly Hall.
Practically all the good seats in the
house have been disposed of, and the
management confidently expects to
see the largest audience that has at
tended a campus production this year.
That this audience will not be disap
pointed is the opinion of Coach Ma
thieu. who has worked faithfully with
the cast for the past four weeks.
The members of the cast completed
a successful dress rehearsal Wednes
day evening, and now await the stag

ing of the big event. They suggest
that the campus public practice "Hoo
verization" on all vegetable offerings.
The up-to-date characterizations that
they are to portray are well fitted for
college actors, and the 1920 Thespians
will not let the parts suffer in their
! hands.
J "It Pays to Advertise" represents
; the ultra-modern type of theatrical
comedy, and is full of snappy lines
and tense situations throughout. The
familiar wayward rich man's son is
the hero, but the admixture of soap
manufacturing, high finance, special
ized advertising and love, makes this
play different from the usual run of
college comedies.
