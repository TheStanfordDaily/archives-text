# D.G. BENEFIT IS TOMORROW
## 
### 
All roads will load to the Delta
Gamma house tomorrow evening
where a nickel dance and vaudeville
show will be given for the benefit of
the Belgian babies' fund. An even
ing of snappy entertainment, good
music, and plenty of "eats" is prom
ised the campus public.
Delta Gamma talent will scintillate
in a bill of clever song and dance acts.
Miss Chrysella Hunker, '21, and Miss
Edith Fullerton, '21, will appear as
Pierrot and Pierrette. Miss Anne
Gardiner, '20, will make her bow to
the public as a piano monologuist.
Music will also be provided by the D.
G. harmony quartet with a repertoire
of popular selections.

The white lights of Coney Island
will be outclassed by the Delta
Gamma midway that will be running
full blast tomorrow night. Here,
campus sleuths will find much to chor
tle over; the deep-dyed blushes of the
embarrassed at the mercy of the for
tune-teller who rakes up a dark, for
gotten past; opportunities of the once
in-a-lifetime variety of witnessing
campus "queens" guess their avoir
dupois at a slim 120 as the hand of
the "guess your weight" machine
leaps past the 150-pound mark.
At 0:30 a campus orchestra will
start up, and from then on the rhyth
mic shuffle of the beneflters will coin
nickels for the Belgians.
