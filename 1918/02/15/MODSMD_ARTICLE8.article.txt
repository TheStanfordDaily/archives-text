## 
### 
Saturday's card of water events is
a full one, with both the varsity and
freshman swimmers on deck for out-
I
side competition. The varsity will
take on the crack aviation team from
Berkeley Ground School at 2 p. m.,
while the freshmen will line up
against the Lick High School water
\
dogs of San Francisco at 11 o'clock in
the morning. As a principal attrac
tion, two world's records will be at
stake when Norman Ross, ex-'2O, now

Contrary to the usual practice, women

ling, and Campbell will be Stanford's
best bets in the sprints, Coonse and

The babes will match their talents
with one of the fastest prep school
aggregations of the bay region in the

takes the field. Darling, Campbell,
Patrick, Lacey, Holt, Newman, God
dard, Reynolds, Reid, and Green will
