# Women Outdo Publicity Men And Stage a Thrilling Fire

Not knowing whether this was one
of the clever advertising stunts of "It
Pays to Advertise" or the start of a
search for "Betty's Boots," the cam
pus was rudely awakened from the
cheerful enjoyment of after-dinner
toothpicks by a sudden shooting of
flames back of Madrono last night.
With the wild and terrifying screams
of "Fire!" emanating from feminine
voices, the masculinity of the campus
turned out en masse to witness the
spectacle and to fight the learping
flames.
Unlike the recent Pi Phi blaze, this
was a real fire, the entire servants'
quarter back of Madrono being de
molished. The Encina men, as the
nearest situated, took charge of the
conflagration under the able leader
ship of Fire Chief Jack Kegley. Two
hoses and an axe were brought into
play, likewise much advice.
Five minutes had scarcely elapsed
beforo the power house whistles an
nounced that there was a fire. Ten
minutes later the fire department ar
rived and he immediately took charge
of the situation. Needless to say, the
fire was completely extinguished, as
soon as it had burnt the house to the
ground.
Little other serious damage was
done, except that the Chinaman's sup
per was burnt, since he lost his cue
and had forgotten to take it off the
stove that went down with the house.
The Madrono girls announce them
selves as pleased with the success of
their efforts and promise a bigger and
better fire next year.
