# VARSITY DEFEATED 3Y OLYMPIC CLUB IN 7 TO 6 GAME
## TEAMS PLAY RAGGEDLY Errors in Eighth Inning Are Responsible for Fall of Cardinal 
### 
Stanford varsity was handed an
other defeat Saturday afternoon when
it fell before the Olympic Club nine
of San Francisco by the narrow mar
gin of a 7 to 6 score. The Winged
"O" team looked good for a defeat
at the hands of the varsity until a
series of errors in the eighth inning
allowed enough of its men to cross
the plate to edge the Cardinals out of
a victory.
Lifur worked out on the mound for
the varsity until the eighth frame,
when he was replaced by Briggs. Gal
loway at short was easily the clean
est player in the game, handling more
than a dozen difficult grounders with
out an error. The absence of "Doc"
Wayland from left field, who is con
fined to the hospital with an infected
foot, was particularly noticeable when
several errors in that section allowed
the Olympics to score.
The Winged "O" men drew first
blood in the third when Benn walked,
stole second and later scored on an
error by Lilly. The varsity likewise
got into action in its half of this in
ning. A hit, two first bases on errors,
and a sacrifice by Campbell allowed
Dickey, Knox, and Lilly to cross the
plate. Lilly again scored in the .Ifth
on a hit, a stolen base, and a sacrilce
by Galloway.
A three-bagger by Norton put the
San Francisco team into action again
in the sixth round. Another hit and
a number of errors on the part of the
Cardinal resulted in three runs for
the Olympics and tied the score.
This ended scoring until the eighth
inning. Briggs was then sent into the
box for Stanford and the Olympics
began by getting a walk. After re
tiring one batter, Briggs allowed an
other walk. A single brought the first
Olympic man across the plate; and
a muffed fly in left field, together with
a series ot rumbled balls and a bad
overthrow at third afforded an oppor
tunity for two more men to score, put
ting the visitors three rounds ahead
of the varsity.
Two runs were netted by the vars
ity in the last of the eighth on a walk,
a two-bagger by Galloway and a sac
rifice by Doe. Neither nine was able
to get any farther than first base dur
ing the ninth inning. The box score
