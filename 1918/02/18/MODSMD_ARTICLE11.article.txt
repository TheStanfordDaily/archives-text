# VARSITY DEFEATED 3Y OLYMPIC CLUB IN 7 TO 6 GAME
## TEAMS PLAY RAGGEDLY Errors in Eighth Inning Are Responsible for Fall of Cardinal 
### 
Stanford varsity was handed an
other defeat Saturday afternoon when
it fell before the Olympic Club nine
of San Francisco by the narrow mar
gin of a 7 to 6 score. The Winged
"O" team looked good for a defeat
at the hands of the varsity until a
series of errors in the eighth inning
allowed enough of its men to cross
the plate to edge the Cardinals out of

several errors in that section allowed
the Olympics to score.
The Winged "O" men drew first

stole second and later scored on an
error by Lilly. The varsity likewise
got into action in its half of this in
ning. A hit, two first bases on errors,
and a sacrifice by Campbell allowed
Dickey, Knox, and Lilly to cross the
plate. Lilly again scored in the .Ifth
on a hit, a stolen base, and a sacrilce
by Galloway.

a number of errors on the part of the
Cardinal resulted in three runs for
the Olympics and tied the score.
This ended scoring until the eighth
inning. Briggs was then sent into the
box for Stanford and the Olympics
began by getting a walk. After re
tiring one batter, Briggs allowed an
other walk. A single brought the first
Olympic man across the plate; and
a muffed fly in left field, together with
