LITTLE THINGS
Sunday's San Francisco Examiner contained a line that read "Ilay Ly
man Wilbur, president of the University of California." Just a minor er
ror, perhaps, but one that merits correction.

That rock pile, just the other side of the postoffice, has been there a
long, long time. In fact, we are all getting kind of used to it. But in view
of the wear and tear on shoe leather and the danger of an occasional turned
ankle, it might be a good thing to fix it up before it becomes a tradition in
its present form.
***** *
In the fall there was a strange spirit of unrest that prevented concen
trated work by most normal persons. We have become accustomed to the
war now and most of us have our constructive plans for war service ahead
of us. As a result this feeling of unquiet has disappeared to a consider
able extent and more of us are able to put our whole-hearted attention on
the task at hand —our studies —than last quarter.

Punctuality is one of the most important of military principles. The
11. O. T. C'. expects promptness from the men in getting to drill on time.
Can not the students drilling expect the same degree of punctuality in dis
missing the companies at 5:15, the time the drill is supposed to end? Not
that the men mean to slight the drill, but whatever time is set for falling
out, 5:15, 5:30, or 5:45, should be observed with true military strictness.

Stanford's R. O. T. C. has never failed in anything it has striven for
thus far in the game, and we are glad to see the men of the corps are at last
getting on their toes in the matter of the military ball. If they keep up the
good work the ball is going to prove just as fine an affair as last year, and
as truly representative of Stanford.
