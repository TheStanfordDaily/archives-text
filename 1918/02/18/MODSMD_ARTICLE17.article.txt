# FRESHMAN JOLLY-UP DATED FOR FRIDAY
## 
### 
The freshman jolly-up will be held
on Friday, February 22. The commit
tee, directed by Chairman W. A. Sea
man, is working overtime making
preparations for a "peppy" dance.
The affair, according to present indi
cations, will be a "super Jolly-up."
Several unusual features, to be sprung
Friday night, are being secretly
worked out. The committee refuses
to give any hint as to the extraordin
ary stunts which they guarantee will
make this jolly-up stand out above all
others. Lots of pep and jazz in the
atmosphere is promised and all en
ergies are being bent so that the large
crowd which is sure to attend will find
it difficult to have anything but a good
time.
