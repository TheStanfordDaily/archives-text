# Livermore Five Defeats Freshmen
## Babes Totally Lacking in Team Play and Basket Shooting 
### 
Livermore High School took the
freshman quintet down the line Sat
urday night in an overwhelming de
feat by a score of 52 to 12. Liver
more had everything and the fresh
men nothing, according to the reports
which floated hack yesterday from the
valley town. Guarding, team work
and accurate shooting were the chief
assets of the high school lads.
So accurate was the guarding of
tlie Livermore team that the first-year
forwards were unable to make good
a single shot at the ring. The fresh
men played their usual type of game,
with plenty of fight and lots of indi
vidual stuff, but were outclassed by
the team work of their lighter oppo
nents. Seaman at center accounted
for three baskets from the middle of
the floor, while Fairchild was able to
drop in three free goals.
Lacey was badly off form and was
replaced in the second half by Phelps
and Sentous took the latter's place at
guard. Swanholm, Phelps, and Sen
tous played a good game at guard, but
the opposing team brought the ball
down the floor in passing rushes and
scored from almost inconceivable po
sitions. The game was fast in spite
of the one-sided score. It terminates
the freshman season.
