# LICK HIGH SCHOOL MERMEN DEFEATED
## 
### 
Government orders issued late Fri
day evening made it impossible for
the aviators of the Berkeley ground
school to meet the varsity swimmers
in the local tank last Saturday after
noon, and consequently Norman Ross,
ex-'2O, the well-known aquatic speed
ster, did not make his attempt to top
the world's records in the 440 and 500-
yard events as was scheduled. In
place in the breast-stroke. Rakestraw
the Lick-Wilmerding High School
splashers ran up against the Stanford
team, instead of the freshman, and
went home on the short side of a 89 to
29 score.
The Lick swimmers represent the
fastest prep school aggregation of San
Francisco. They proved a good match
for Stanford's best water-tank mate
rial in Saturday's meet. Darling of
the Cardinal showed his characteristic
get-away. Stanford annexed all three
places in the plunge for distance,
while Reeher came through for a first
place i nthe breast-stroke. Rakestraw
of the Stanford varsity got the de
cision in the diving contest. The relay
went to the Cardinal and proved to
be one of the most breath-capturing
events of the meet.
