# CLASS OF 1920 PUTS ON VERY SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTION
## CHARACTER ROLES HITS Good Acting and Play Win Approval Despite Minor Imperfections 
### 
"It Tays to Advertise" behind the
footlights, but splendid publicity by
the second-year class failed to bring
a large audience to witness the soph
omore production last Friday night.
Almost all the actors were new to
the stage, but they showed up well in
their first appearance in Stanford
dramatics, in spite of a number of
breaks. It was an oversight to omit
the name of the prompter from the
cast of characters. He played a good
part, and his voice carried well.
Coach Frank L. Mathieu deserves
great credit for the molding of raw
material into fairly well poised ac
tresses and actors. Especially was
the stage arrangement noteworthy for
its naturalness. The 1920 Class put
it all over the nineteen-nineteeners in
its selection of a play.
Both character roles, as is the usual
case, almost robbed the leading man
and woman of their parts. Miss Mar
garet Shedd as the Comtesse de
Beaurien, and F. H. Sloman as Am
brose Peale were the biggest hits.
Miss Shedd did the best work of the
evening. She played her part with
admirable spontaneity and poise, and
demonstrated her eligibility for a Phi
Beta Kappa key from the Romanic
Languages department by her fluent
uue of French. Sloman was splendid
ly cast as the press agent and his
usual mannerisms of speech and ges
ture brought down the house. The
only flaw in his otherwise almost per
fect acting was hesitancy with his
lines. He proved himself an athlete
of merit by almost wrecking the office
walls in the second act.
Miss Mary Largent and J. T. Boyle
did tlie heavy work of the play and
both were convincing. As Mary Gray
son, Miss Largent was a clever busi
ness woman and a charming fiancee.
Boyle was much more appealing after
he shed the moustache, Prince Albert
and spats for the garb of a business
man. These same properties became
Ellery Clark's personality far better.
M. R. D. Maynard as the latter indi
vidual acted well and livened up the
second act.
E. B. Harper, as Cyrus Martin, the
irate father, was a bit too jovial, but
his role was well done and his per
sonality maintained throughout the
three acts of the play.
M. A. White, as George McChesney.
Miss Helen Onserud as the French
maid, M. H. Mertz as Charles Bronson
of Marshall Field's, Miss Martha
Smith, as Miss Burke, the clerk, and
Verne Langford as William Smith all
played minor parts, and played them
well.
Stage management was far more ef
ficient than it has been for some time
in the past, and the success of the
1920 production was contributed to
by the short curtain waits experienced
last Friday night.

garet Shedd as the Comtesse de
Beaurien, and F. H. Sloman as Am
brose Peale were the biggest hits.
Miss Shedd did the best work of the
evening. She played her part with
admirable spontaneity and poise, and
demonstrated her eligibility for a Phi
Beta Kappa key from the Romanic
Languages department by her fluent
uue of French. Sloman was splendid
ly cast as the press agent and his
usual mannerisms of speech and ges
ture brought down the house. The
only flaw in his otherwise almost per
fect acting was hesitancy with his
lines. He proved himself an athlete
of merit by almost wrecking the office
walls in the second act.
Miss Mary Largent and J. T. Boyle
did tlie heavy work of the play and
both were convincing. As Mary Gray
son, Miss Largent was a clever busi
ness woman and a charming fiancee.
Boyle was much more appealing after
he shed the moustache, Prince Albert
and spats for the garb of a business
man. These same properties became
Ellery Clark's personality far better.
M. R. D. Maynard as the latter indi
vidual acted well and livened up the
second act.
E. B. Harper, as Cyrus Martin, the
irate father, was a bit too jovial, but
his role was well done and his per
sonality maintained throughout the
three acts of the play.
M. A. White, as George McChesney.
Miss Helen Onserud as the French
maid, M. H. Mertz as Charles Bronson
of Marshall Field's, Miss Martha
Smith, as Miss Burke, the clerk, and
Verne Langford as William Smith all
played minor parts, and played them
well.
Stage management was far more ef
ficient than it has been for some time
in the past, and the success of the
1920 production was contributed to
by the short curtain waits experienced
last Friday night.
"It Tays to Advertise" behind the
footlights, but splendid publicity by
the second-year class failed to bring
a large audience to witness the soph
omore production last Friday night.
Almost all the actors were new to
the stage, but they showed up well in
their first appearance in Stanford
dramatics, in spite of a number of
breaks. It was an oversight to omit
the name of the prompter from the
cast of characters. He played a good
part, and his voice carried well.
Coach Frank L. Mathieu deserves
great credit for the molding of raw
material into fairly well poised ac
tresses and actors. Especially was
the stage arrangement noteworthy for
its naturalness. The 1920 Class put
it all over the nineteen-nineteeners in
its selection of a play.
Both character roles, as is the usual
case, almost robbed the leading man
and woman of their parts. Miss Mar
garet Shedd as the Comtesse de
Beaurien, and F. H. Sloman as Am
brose Peale were the biggest hits.
