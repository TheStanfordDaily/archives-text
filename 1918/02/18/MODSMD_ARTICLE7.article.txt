# R.O.T.C.to Give Big Service Flag
## 
### 
Plans for Stanford's long talked of
service flag to be purchased by the R.
O. T. C. have at last been completed
and the Hag has been ordered. The
order has been placed by a commit
tee from the Service Club and the
flag is now being made in San Fran
cisco.
It will follow in general design the
flag which is being purchased by the
women, and was worked out by the
Service Club committee with J. E.
McDowell, assistant registrar. The
(lag will have, the regular red border
with a white field, containing a large
star on which will be placed the num
ber of men in service On opposite
ends of the fiag will be a Stanford
and a United States seal. This num
ber will be changed from time to
time as more men enlist.
According to the recent ruling that
service flags should only represent
men actually in uniform, the number
on the fiag will not represent the large
number of Stanford men who are en
gaged in civilian forms of government
service. Information of over twelve
hundred former Stanford men now in
uniform has been compiled at the Reg
istrar's office.
The flag will be 25x15 feet in
dimensions and will fly from a pole
in front of the Quad. It is the same
size as the fiags now on the poles
there. Arrangements are being made
to have the Hag formally presented to
the University during some of the ex
ercises of Founders' Day.
Arrangements for the Stanford ser
vice flag to be given by the women of
the University were completed when
the order for the flag was placed with
a San Francisco firm, Saturday. The
Hag will be finished in time for pre
sentation on Founders' Day, which is
to be celebrated March 10.
The Women's War Emergency Com
mittee is in charge of the movement
and all the women's living groups on
the campus have donated funds to
ward it.
