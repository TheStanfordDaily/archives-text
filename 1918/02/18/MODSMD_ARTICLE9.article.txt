# Campbell Players Defeat 1921 Nine
## 
### 
Coach Scofield took the freshman
nine to Campbell Saturday, where
they were treated to a 14 to 5 defeat
at the hands of a pick-up team from
that town. The freshmen played al
most an errorless game, but the Camp
bell team bunched their hits in such
a fashion as to carry more than a
dozen of its men across the plate.
The loss of the game was not due
particularly to poor work on the part
of the 1921 nine, but to the fact that
they faced a far superior team. The
Campbell nine defeated the Santa
Clara team, which downed the varsity
last week by a 10 to 8 count. Several
of its players are signed up to try out
with the coast league.
Teubner played a good game at the
first sack and clouted the apple for a
three-bagger off the Campbell twirler.
Criss gave a good account of himself
from the position behind the bat.
