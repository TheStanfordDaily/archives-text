Coach Christie explained the defeat of
the Blue and Gold last week on the
grounds that Salmina, star forward,
could not find the basket. The rea
son was one Parks, Stanford guard,
who hung on the California man's
heels all through the game, and pre
vented his making any baskets.
California's expectations for this
game may be fulfilled this time though
since the Stanford team is in bad
shape, due to injuries. Hood is fast
getting the use of his shoulder, in
jured in the first game, but he will not
be in shape for hard play tomorrow.
Williamson, with a broken thumb,
looks to be out of it permanently. The
California combination in addition to
the advantage it has in playing on its
own court, has all its men in shape
for the game. If Stanford's guards
put up the game they did in the first
fracas and Schwarzenbek and Moul
ton work their scoring combination as
effectively as usual the Cardinal
should come back with the series in
its belt, however.
Coacli Wilson will start Schwarzen
bek at center. Butt and Parks at guard,
Moulton and either Bucklin or Hood
at forward.
