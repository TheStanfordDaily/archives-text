# 1919 OPERA PROMISES MIRTH, MAIDS, MUSIC
## Tuneful Pieces Produced by Ram's Head Members. Costumes Unique 
### 
Mirth, melody, and maids are the
characteristic features of "Betty's
Hoots," the 1919 opera, which will hold
the center of local dramatic interest
two weeks from Thursday night.
Hetty's diamond boots were not lost
in the Madrono fire last Thursday as
some people thought, it was an
nounced today.
Entirely new and startling effects
in the line of costuming and scenery
have been worked out by Ram's Head,
which has the staging of the show in
hand. The costumes will be distinctly
modern, and altogether different from
anything that has ever been seen on
the Stanford stage. Bright new scen
ery, futuristic in effect, will take the
place of the well-worn sets of the
Assembly Hall stage on March 7.
The real hit of the show is said to
be the music, which has been written
by Ram's Head. In particular, one
song which combines the spirit of
Stanford with a wonderful soothing
melody, is certain to be a decided fea
ture. It is said that a San Francisco
music publisher has offered a large
sum for the rights to one of the songs,
which will probably be published after
the opera.
L. L. Pickering, *20, who plays the
part of Lemuel Foster, has returned
from the measles colony, and rehear
sals are now expected to go forward
without a hitch.
