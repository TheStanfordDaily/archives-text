Thoughtless acts of a few individuals often endanger the reputation
of the University as a whole. There has probably never been a time
when the campus was entirely free from petty gambling. There is a cer
tain instinctive love for games of chance in every red-blooded young man.
But when this evil becomes prevalent in various quarters of the campus to
such an extent as to create general comment it is being permitted to go too
far.
It is not the one game that counts, for games never go by ones. Once
the "bones" begin to roll they roll forever, the old saying goes, and the
same principle applies to all forms of betting money on the throw of dice
or the draw of cards. The gaming instinct, while quite natural in origin, is
insidious and morally dangerous if allowed any leeway. If allowed to re
main uncurbed a distinct falling off in campus morale is sure to follow,
and in these times of war the meaning and value of morale is understood
and appreciated better than ever before.
This evil, though affecting but few individuals, is not restricted to any
particular part of the campus. We are not attempting to raise any tea-pot
tempest, nor can we or do we want to take the attitude of the Puritanical
preacher, but, aside from the consideration of violation of campus rules,
there is a real danger to individual students and to the good name of the
University if the gambling participated in by a few erring ones continues.
