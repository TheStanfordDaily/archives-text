# Wilbur's Mansion Nears Completion
## 
### 
Stanford's unique presidential resi
dence is nearing completion, accord
ing to announcement of the construc
tors, who expect to finish work on the
building by the end of March. The
building is most unusual in many fea
tures.
Its formal entrance opens out upon
a vestibule from the formal reception
room. To the right of the vestibule is
the family entrance, from which the
staircase leads to the second floor.
This staircase and the walls have the
same finish as the outside of the build
ing. The floor of the reception hall
is of marble. A fountain has yet to
be put into the room, and three or
four long, broad mirrors in the walls.
In the eastern wing is a long room
with a large fireplace, which is to be
left unfinished. In the western wing,
on the first floor, is a servant's room,
trunk rack, kitchen, a large vegetable
room, and a fuel room.
On the second floor in the west wing
are the family living rooms and kit
chen. There is also a servant's dining
room, refrigerator, and pantry. Dr.
Wilbur's small private study is also
located on the second floor. In thd
east wing, on this floor, is a banquet
room, assembly room for oflicial meet
ings, and a kitchen.
Mrs. Wilbur's suite is on the third
floor in the east wing, and is finished
in the French panelled fashion. The
four small sleeping porches opposite
the bedrooms of the family can be
completely closed in by French win
dows. There are three or four guest
rooms, each with a private bath. A
large library, a sewing room, equipped
with folding mirrors, ironing board,
and clothes-closets, and three or four
servants' rooms, are on the third floor.
The whole interior of the house is
to be finished in a color scheme of
gray and silver.
