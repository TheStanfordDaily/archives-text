Infantry from Camp Fremont will
hook up in a diamond battle tomor
row afternoon on the Cardinal lot.

will be no game. In case the weather
man does loosen up and allow play,
admission for the contest, which is to
begin at 4 o'clock, will be 25 cents
with student body members passing
for 15 cents.
Either Harvey or Briggs will start
on the mouiul for the Cardinals, with
the odds on the former. Waylaiul is
out again after a term in the hospital
and will cavort around in left field.

it did last Saturday with Campbell
behind the bat, Davis on first, Doe on
second, Galloway on short, and
Dickey at third sack. Lilly will be in

gage the Varsity has been having a
