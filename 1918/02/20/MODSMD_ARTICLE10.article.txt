# ALFONSO CORNEJO SHOWS FUTURISTIC PRINTS AT LECTURE
## 
### 
To most persons the terms cubist,im
pressionist, futurist, post-impression
ist, convey only a hazy idea of
triangles and crazy-quilt patterns
labeled "Dance of Spring" or "Fresh
Cabbages." These conceptions were
cleared up and a connected idea of
their significance was given by Alfonso
Cornejo in his lecture last night,
"The Modern Movement in Painting
and Sculpture."
"Every new artistic movement aims
at a greater freedom of expression,"
said the speaker. "It has been so
with all great movements in the past
and it is true at present. The im
pressionistic school may be considered
the leader in the modern develop
ments. The post-impressionists are
now succeeding them. The principal
aims of these schools are the effect
of depth in their works and vivid real
ism in reproduction. The conven
tional idea of prettiness is foreign to
their conception of art."
The three great names in this mod
ern school of painting are Cezanne,
Van Gogh, and Gauguin. More ultra
modern than them is Matisse. From
him branch off the schools of cubists,
futurists, and other erratic forms of
so-called art.
Numerous stereopticon slides were
shown of the works of these men and
other masters of the modern school.
Some of these were much like what
we have been accustomed to call
works of art, while others, showing
the influence of the cubist and futur
ist schools, approached, at least from
the layman's point of view, the gro
tesque.
Modern sculpture was also taken up,
and illustrations of works of Rodin
and Mestrovic, the great Serbian
sculptor, were thrown on the screen.
