# Y. M. C. A. DRIVE TO TAKE PLACE MONDAY
## 
### 
Arrangements for the enlistment of
Stanford men and women in informal
Y. M. C. A. and Y. W. C. A. study
classes and discussion groups are
making rapid progress, and local lead
ers announce that the big drive will
in all probability take place next Mon
day evening. At that time meetings
will be held in all the living groups
and two meetings on each floor of En
cina Hall.
As previously announced, the sub
ject to be taken up in the groups will
be "The Principles Underlying a
Christian Democracy." This campaign
is a national one being undertaken in
all the colleges and universities in
Stobart,"one hundred and fifty wound
ed men were under our care, and
during the week twenty-two thousand
had passed through our hands. We
found that there were no Serbian doc
tors there —all had died."
Because of her efficient service the
Serbian government asked that the
hospital unit accompany the army
and offered Mrs. Stobart a commis
sion as major. Before the combined
forces of Germans, Austrians and Bul
garians. the Surbian army was com
pelled to retreat. "It was a retreat,
not only of the army but of the whole
Serbian nation," said Mrs. Stobart.
"The suffering of the soldiers and ref
ugees in their retreat was terrible —
horrible. For three weeks we fought
our way over the mountains through
snow and ice, many going for days at
a time without food or water. These
people were not only giving their lives
for freedom's sake, but their homes
and country as well. At this moment
one-third of Serbia is under Austrian
control, and two-thirds under the
Bulgarians."
Mrs. Stobart closed by saying,
"There is a greater Serbia to arise.
Shall not we who are free, help this
valiant country to her freedom?"
Cards were given out at the door.
Any contributions will go direct to
the Serbian Red Cross and may be
sent through Miss Bradford.
