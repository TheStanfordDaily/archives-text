# QUADRANGLE CLUB CHANGES DATE OF IRISH MARATHON
## TO COME JUNIOR WEEK Plan Made for Some Sport on Saturday—Fremont Meet Is Postponed 
### 
Quadrangle Club, at a meeting last
night, decided to postpone the Irish.
Marathon, scheduled for Washington's
Birthday, until some suitable time in
Junior Week. This is according to the
custom of having the annual Mara
thon under the auspices of Quadrangle
Club and one of the events of Junior
Week. Last year the rule was broken
and the Marathon was held early in
the season, but due to the war restric
tions on Junior Week it was thought
advisable to make the event a part
ner to the opera and the prom.
Relay races were planned as a sub
stitute for the holiday track competi
tion, but there is a possibility of some
other sort of a meet being staged.
Nothing definite will be known until
tomorrow, however, as much depends
upon the probable condition of the
track.
H. W. Maloney, athletic director at
Camp Fremont, announced that he
considered it advisable to postpone the
all-Fremont track meet scheduled for
the Stanford oval tomorrow. The wet
condition of the track is responsible
for the change in plans. The Fremont
men will display their class next
Tuesday instead of the original date.
Some time in the near future the
soldiers are to compete with the Stan-
quainted with music and to those who
merely enjoy melody without knowing
its technique.
From a poor dressmaker to an il
lustrious singer has been the seem
ingly impossible rise of Mme. Guilbert.
She overcame obstacles that appeared
insurmountable, and eventually rose
to a height which brought her the
praise of noted critics. She is pos
sessed of a wonderful personality,
charming grace, and compelling nat
ural kindliness.
Of her one critic wrote: "There is
no word in English for that medium
of art of which Yvette Guilbert is the
supreme and perfect master, —it is not
acting, it is not singing,—it is not
recitation, yet it combines the finest
beauties of all three."
Besides Mme. Guilbert herself, the
program will present two capable sup
porting artists —Emily Dresser, vio
linist, and Maurice Eisner, pianist.
Prices of seats have been placed by
the committee in charge within the
means of students as well as the gen
eral public. As it is a benefit, no war
tax will be collected and the seats
will sell for $1.25, $1 and 75 cents.
Tickets are now on sale at the Book
store, and at Wcingartner's in Palo
Alto, and members of the committee
also are handling them. These tick
ets arc to be exchanged at Weingart
ner's Saturday and Monday for re
served seats.
Mrs. O. L. Elliott is chairman of the
committee and hopes that the audi
ence will be large so that a substan
tial fund may be obtained to relieve
sufferers in the territory swept by the
Huns.

From a poor dressmaker to an il
lustrious singer has been the seem
ingly impossible rise of Mme. Guilbert.
She overcame obstacles that appeared
insurmountable, and eventually rose
to a height which brought her the
praise of noted critics. She is pos
sessed of a wonderful personality,
charming grace, and compelling nat
ural kindliness.
Of her one critic wrote: "There is
no word in English for that medium
of art of which Yvette Guilbert is the
supreme and perfect master, —it is not
acting, it is not singing,—it is not
recitation, yet it combines the finest
beauties of all three."
Besides Mme. Guilbert herself, the
program will present two capable sup
porting artists —Emily Dresser, vio
linist, and Maurice Eisner, pianist.
Prices of seats have been placed by
the committee in charge within the
means of students as well as the gen
eral public. As it is a benefit, no war

Tickets are now on sale at the Book
store, and at Wcingartner's in Palo
Alto, and members of the committee
also are handling them. These tick
ets arc to be exchanged at Weingart
ner's Saturday and Monday for re
served seats.
Mrs. O. L. Elliott is chairman of the
committee and hopes that the audi

tial fund may be obtained to relieve

Huns.
Quadrangle Club, at a meeting last
night, decided to postpone the Irish.
Marathon, scheduled for Washington's
Birthday, until some suitable time in
Junior Week. This is according to the
custom of having the annual Mara
thon under the auspices of Quadrangle
Club and one of the events of Junior
Week. Last year the rule was broken
and the Marathon was held early in
the season, but due to the war restric
tions on Junior Week it was thought
advisable to make the event a part
ner to the opera and the prom.
Relay races were planned as a sub
stitute for the holiday track competi
tion, but there is a possibility of some
other sort of a meet being staged.
Nothing definite will be known until
tomorrow, however, as much depends
upon the probable condition of the
track.
H. W. Maloney, athletic director at
Camp Fremont, announced that he
considered it advisable to postpone the
all-Fremont track meet scheduled for
the Stanford oval tomorrow. The wet
condition of the track is responsible
for the change in plans. The Fremont
men will display their class next
Tuesday instead of the original date.
Some time in the near future the
soldiers are to compete with the Stan-
quainted with music and to those who
merely enjoy melody without knowing
its technique.
