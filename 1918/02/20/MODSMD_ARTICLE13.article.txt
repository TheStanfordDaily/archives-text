# QUADRANGLE CLUB CHANGES DATE OF IRISH MARATHON
## TO COME JUNIOR WEEK Plan Made for Some Sport on Saturdayâ€”Fremont Meet Is Postponed 
### 
Quadrangle Club, at a meeting last
night, decided to postpone the Irish.
Marathon, scheduled for Washington's
Birthday, until some suitable time in
Junior Week. This is according to the
custom of having the annual Mara
thon under the auspices of Quadrangle
Club and one of the events of Junior
Week. Last year the rule was broken
and the Marathon was held early in
the season, but due to the war restric

advisable to make the event a part
ner to the opera and the prom.
Relay races were planned as a sub

other sort of a meet being staged.
Nothing definite will be known until
tomorrow, however, as much depends
upon the probable condition of the
track.
H. W. Maloney, athletic director at
Camp Fremont, announced that he
considered it advisable to postpone the
all-Fremont track meet scheduled for
the Stanford oval tomorrow. The wet
condition of the track is responsible
for the change in plans. The Fremont
men will display their class next
Tuesday instead of the original date.
Some time in the near future the
soldiers are to compete with the Stan-
