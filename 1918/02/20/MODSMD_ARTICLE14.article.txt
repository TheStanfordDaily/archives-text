# Stanford Quintet to Clash With U. C.
## Cardinal Chances Are Even in Tonight's Battle Without Hood 
### 
California, on her own floor, will
endeavor to tie the basketball series
with Stanford tonight, when the two
teams meet in Harmon gymnasium at
7:45 o'clock. The Stanford team left
on the noon train for Berkeley today
and everything is in readiness for the
battle.
A few minutes before the train left
Coach Wilson definitely announced
that Hood would not be able to get
in the game at forward and as a re
sult Ilucklin will act as a team-mate
for Moulton. The remainder of the
team will line up with Schwarzenbek
at center and Parks and Butt at
guard. California's lineup at present
is Salmina and Cuffe at forwards, An
derson at center, and Green and Grul
at guard. Coach Christie may make
some changes in his men at the last
moment from their showing in the last
practice tonight.
Referee "Tubby" Sperry will handle
the whistle in the second game. He
is the man who was in charge in the
contest a week ago on the Cardinal
court.
Coach Wilson expressed himself as
satisfied with the showing of the Stan
ford team, although he admitted the
Injury of Williamson and Hood had
made a big hole in the Cardinal
chances. The injuries and the ad
vantage California will have on her
own floor offset the better showing
Stanford made in the first contest and
give both teams a fighting chance for
the long end of the score.
Several Stanford rooters left on the
afternoon trains for Berkeley in order
to give the Cardinals a good sendoff
at the game tonight.
