# IRISH MARATHON PLANS
## 
### 
Decision to hold the Irish Marathon during Junior Week, as in most
former years, instead of on Washington's Birthday should meet with gen
eral approval. It should also result in a greatly increased number of men
out for places on the various class teams. This year, as never before,
every male undergraduate must heed the call for marathoners and get out
on the track to practice up for the big event.
Always in the past there has been an exhibition of speed by football
men, debaters and others who have never donned track spikes before, but
this all goes toward the making of a"regular" Irish Marathon. One of the
big ideas of the Marathon is to get new track material out, and frequently
some of the men brought to light by this competition prove valuable finds
for the cinder squad.
If possible each team should be represented by a full team of twenty
four men, and if everybody will respond this can be done. The showing of
men on the track between now and and the Marathon will determine the
size of the teams. According to the plans now under way the Marathon
will prove one of the most attractive and important parts of the 1919 Junior
Week program.
Holdovers —what few of them remain on the Farm these days—should
get together and decide on their "stunts" for the Marathon.
