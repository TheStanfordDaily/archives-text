House Managers
To meet Tonight.
House managers from the various
men's living groups will meet tonight
at dinner at the Alpha Sigma Phi
house, 1G Alvarado Row. This is one
of the regular series of managers'
meetings which have been held this
year to discuss problems of war-time
management, It is expected that steps
will be taken tonight in regard to the
campus food control, which is now al
most non-existent owing to the de
parture of R. M. Jones, former food
administrator.
