# R. O. T. C. UNIFORMS MUST BE CLEANED FOR INSPECTION
## 
### 
Government inspection of the R. O.
T. C. is expected at any time now, ac
cording to an announcement made by
the battalion commanders. In antici
pation of this inspection all men in the
corps have been requested to see that
their uniforms and equipment are in
the best of shape, as there will be no
opportunity to improve them after the
government inspector arrives.
Last year Stanford stood in the dis
tinguished class in the government
list of colleges and universities giving
military training. In order to keep at
the top, the men have been requested
to keep their equipment in such a
condition as to present the best mili
tary appearance. They are not re
quired to be in uniform this week, giv
ing an opportunity to have uniforms
altered and pressed. Another oppor
tunity of this kind will not be given
until near the latter part of May, ac
cording to an announcement made
yesterday at the request of Captain
Volkmar.
The giving of commands by means
of whistle and hand signals was taken
up by Major Bullis of the R. O. T. C.
and explained before the men of the
corps yesterday.
