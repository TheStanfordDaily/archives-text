# Stolen Bases

San Jose papers reported the game
between the Stanford freshmen and
Campbell last Saturday as a contest
between the Cardinal varsity and the
San Jose combination. The freshmen
105t.6 to 1 but they put up such a fast
brand of ball that they looked like
varsity candidates to the reporters.

There were a half dozen fans out to
see the battle between the Varsity and
Olympics last Saturday. The wind
was so cold that even the boosters
covered themselves up in their coats
and refused to cheer.

"Prox" Campbell has jumped into
the lead in the hitting column for the
Varsity. The big catcher is making a
habit of hitting two singles over sec
ond base each game. The hits usually
come when they are needed, in addi
tion. Galloway at short is covering
himself with glory in the fielding de
partment. He handled ten chances
without an error last Saturday.

Galloway pulled one of the prettiest
plays seen on the local diamond when
he shut a man off at first against the
Winged "O." An Olympic man hit a
hard ground ball over second but the
shortstop ran over and snared it. He
was forced to reach so far that he fell
down, however. Quickly recovering
himself, Galloway sat up and threw to
Davis to retire the runner.

Lilly lost what looked to be a two
bagger last Saturday. The ball went
over first base on a line but Norton
pulled some twinkle-twinkle stuff and
snared it.
