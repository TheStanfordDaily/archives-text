# Y. M. C. A. Drive Slated To Take Place Monday
## 
### 
America for the purpose of educating
the coming American generation in
the principles for which the present
world war is being waged.
Stanford leaders have set 300 men
and 250 women as a fair estimate of
the number of students that can be
interested in the work here. The
groups will meet for discussion once
a week under a student leader, and
the course is arranged to last eight to
ten weeks. Local organizers will
gather for a luncheon at Stanford Inn
the latter part of this week, when the
last word will be spoken in prepara
tion for Monday's drive.
Y. M. C. A. Secretary A. E. Worthy,
'15, is well pleased with the way the
arrangements are materializing. He
believes that the men and women will
respond readily to the call and that
the minimum number will be easily
reached.
