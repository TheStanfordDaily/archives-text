# Men Will Not Want for Partners at 1921 Dance
## 
### 
As a feature of the freshman "jolly
up" scheduled for Friday uight every
man is to have a partner. The com
mittee in charge of affairs for the
evening hopes to provide, as a "jolly
up" innovation, at least one woman for
every man. They have made special
effort to secure a good representation
from the various sororities and Roble
Hall. This should be a special attrac
tion for some who avoid "jolly-ups"
on account of over-keen competition
for partners.
The music for the occasion will be
furnished by a four-piece orchestra
which will start promptly at 8:30.
Punch and cider will be served to
those who get thirsty, and some gen
uine entertainment is planned. The
event, say those in charge, has every
indication so far of being a real
"gloom chaser." The admission as
usual will be 50 cents. It will be held
at Encina Hall and everyone is in
vited.
