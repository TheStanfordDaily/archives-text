# TWO NINES WILL OPPOSE VARSITY DURING WEEK-END
## MEET "SPEED" MARTIN'S TEAM SATURDAY Fremont Champions Will Furnish Friday's Competition 
### 
Speed Martin and his leaguers from
around the bay will attack the varsity
nine at 2:30 sharp on Saturday,accord
ing to intercepted reports which have
come in from the graduate manager's
office. The artillery fire from the in
vaders has been unusually heavy the
last few days, but General Lilly's
forces have kept up their morale and
are prepared to meet attack with
counter attack. In order to get into
the front line trenches for the battle,
25 cents will be required, although
those who have contributed to the gov
ernment by purchasing A. S. S. U.
tickets can pass for 15 cents.
Manager Sullivan has arranged a
game with the champions from Camp
Fremont, tomorrow afternoon provid
ing the rain does not take a hand and
attempt to umpire the game. The
same prices as for Saturday will pre
vail.
If the contest is played tomorrow,
either Briggs or Harvey will be in the
box, while Lifur will be saved for the
contest on Saturday. "Speed" Martin
may do the heaving for the team on
Saturday, while the batteries for the
Fremont team tomorrow have not
been announced.
Weather permitting, baseball fans
should see a real exhibition of the
national pastime Saturday. Martin is
a former Coast Leaguer and has gath
ered some fast men for his team. They
have taken such combinations as the
Marines down the line in games so far
this season and promise to have the
strongest nine around the bay with
the exception of the Coast League
clubs.
Since Friday is a holiday, the game
with the Fremont champions will be
called at 2:30 in the afternoon. If
the day is warm, the varsity should
have little trouble with this team,
since Briggs and Harvey need sun to
keep the soup-bone throwing them
over in good shape.
