# OUR RIGHT TO REMAIN AT STANFORD
## 
### 
Although the restless feeling of uncertainty that made continuous appli
cation to college studies almost impossible and which was almost universal
last quarter has passed away for the most part, there still remain those who
do not appear to he able to apply themselves to the hum-drum routine work
of studying. While there Avas some excuse for inability to devote one's en
ergies to concentrated scholastic endeavor in the fall, this no longer exists,
as every one has had ample opportunity to think the situation over-and come
to some definite conclusion as to what his or her individual plans for war
time service are going to be.
With many this service will be active, in some branch of military or
naval life. Many will await the draft, and the man who takes the position
that he is ready to go at any time Uncle Sam calls him by the selective draft
process cannot be called a slacker, although he does not deserve to receive
the credit that is due the volunteer. Still others feel they can be of more
service here at home in some line of industry or production, where trained
workers are needed badly. Every person should look ahead and make defi
nite and constructive plans for service if this has not already been done.
But as long as we remain in the University we must justify our presence
here by taking full advantage of our opportunities for training. The business
of getting a college education, instead of being a trivial matter, is more essen
tial and important now than ever before. We must all realize this and take
full advantage of our opportunities in order to justify our presence here.
There is no room for slackers at Stanford.
