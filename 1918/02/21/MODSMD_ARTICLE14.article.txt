# WASHINGTON'S BIRTHDAY
## 
### 
Tomorrow we are to enjoy that rare but wonderful experience of having
a University holiday. We are to observe the birthday of George Washington.
As we follow modern leaders of today in a world war to preserve inviolate
the principles upon which our government was founded and to protect these
principles across the waters, we can spare a moment from our usual routine
of work and activities to revere the memory of him who first fought for these
principles and who led in making an American government possible.
All honor to the memory of the Father of our Country!
