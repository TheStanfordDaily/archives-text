# WAR SAVING STAMPS RETURNS COME IN
## TWO HOUSES PLEDGE 100 PER CENT OF MEMBERSHIP TO THRIFT STAMPS 
### 
A total of $901.91 lias been pledged
by 399 subscribers in the campaign
of the past week for the sale of war
savings and thrift stamps on the cam
pus, and at that the complete returns
are not yet in. Of this amount 250
pledges were made by women's or
gazinations with a total of $227.84,
showing a percentage of 64j4 of the
389 individuals reached. Two of the
houses registered a 100 per cent sub
scription. In addition it was found
that a large number of the women are
already subscribers to the loan, so
that 75 per cent of Stanford women
may be safely stated to be partici
pants.
But eight men's organizations have
as yet reported with ninety-four
pledges, totalling $293.59, but the
large number yet to be heard from
would make any percentage figures
misleading, one of the above number
alone subscribing $82.60. Fifty-four
new pledges were secured in private
houses totalling $439.48 and a total
of eighty-one subscribers were found
in the ninety-six homes reached.
The committee in charge of the so
liciting appreciate very fully the cor
dial co-operation of the Daily Palo
Alto and of those who have helped in
the canvass in aid of the government
loan.
The response of the students to the
call has been good, everything con
sidered, and the thrift stamp has be
come a part of the everyday life of
the campus. It takes sixteen thrift
stamps to buy one war savings stamp,
so in order to collect this number con
sistent saving will be necessary. This
will accomplish the purpose of the
government to promote thrift.
