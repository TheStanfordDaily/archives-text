# STANFORD SENDS MANY MEN INTO NATIONAL SERVICE
## UNIVERSITY FLAG WILL HOLD 1300 STARS Seventy-five from Faculty Serve Government, Many in High Places By Ural N. Hoffman, Instructor in Journalism. 
### 
Thirteen hundred men and women
from Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity—members of the Board of Trus
tees and faculty, alumni and former
students —are now in active govern
ment service, as shown by figures com
piled by the University committee on
war information, of which J. E. Mc-
Dowell, assistant registrar and alumni
secretary, is chairman.
Stars representing 1130 men who
are in military service will decorate
the large service flag to be unfurled
at the celebration of Founders' Day,
March 10. In addition to these are
more than IGO men and women in
other forms of service to which they
are giving their time wholly or in part.
Only those who are known to be ac
tually in service are included in the
totals.
From the faculty have gone approx
imately seventy-five. Twenty-five of
these are in military service, most of
them commissioned with ranks from
lieutenant up to major. There are
some twenty-live others doing non
military work to which they are giv
ing their full time, and twenty-five
more who are making investigations
and doing research work while con
tinuing their academic duties.
Five Valuable Men Wiven.
Stanford's most notable contribu
tion is Herbert Hoover, an alumnus
and a member of the Hoard of Trus
tees, who is United States Food Ad
ministrator. President Ray Lyman
Wilbur has given most of his time

since war was declared lo duties with
the Food Administration as chairman
of the food conservation division.
Professor Vernon L. Kellogg of the
Entomology department is another
right hand man in the food adminis
tration. He is now in Washington, as
is President Wilbur.
The important post of chairman of
the National Committee on Aeronau- i
tics is filled by Dr. William F. Durand, j
professor of mechanical engineering.
He is now in France studying war
problems, collecting and classifying
information for the United States.
Another responsible place in admin
istration is held hy Professor David
M. Folsom of the Geology and Mining
department, who is federal fuel ad
ministrator for the Pacific coast
states.
Stan Ford's part in the war is not
marked so much by money expenditure
as by the more important personal
services of men fitted for the vitally
important duties at this time. Many
of them are serving without govern
ment pay, with the University con
tinuing their regular salaries.
The list of activities includes food
conservation, service of mercy, con
fidential investigations and researches,
military training for students and in
struction in French for officers and
soldiers stationed at Camp Fremont.
Before the United States entered the
war, Stanford had made a survey of
faculty, alumni, and undergraduates
to collect data on their special prep
aration for various forms of war time
service, immediately upon the declar
ation of war the trustees placed at the
disposal of the government for the
period of the war the entire equip
ment of the institution, including not
only grounds, buildings, and labora-

tories, but the training and skill of its
ablest scientists.
Intensive military training for all
men students was provided at once,
and scores of these have since been
commissioned in the army and navy
to train other men. Further military
training is being given for all men
who wish to enroll in the Reserve Of
ficers' Training Corps here. The call
to arms took the University's first
military professor, but another has
been obtained in his place.
Camp Fremont, one of the largest
cantonments, is located partly on
Stanford University land. To the of
ficers and soldiers there five members
of the faculty are giving instruction
in French. In the work of establishing
a library for the men at Camp Fre
mont the Stanford Library has helped,
and one member of the Library staff
has been assigned there.
In order that students and alumni
may find the work for which they are
best fitted the University maintains a
committee on war information. All
calls for service from the intercol
legiate Intelligence Bureau are given
publicity among undergraduates and
alumni.
Five Mercy Units.
Naval Base Hospital Unit No. 2 was
organized by the Stanford Medical
School, with Dr. Stanley Stillman,
professor of surgery, as its head and
with eleven medical instructors and
seven nurses among its personnel.

A large number of other members of
the Medical School staff are in ser

undergraduates and alumni have been

formed and are now serving on the
European battle-fronts.

Dr. D 11. Camp
bell, Member of
National Couneil
of Defense.
Thirteen hundred men and women
from Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity—members of the Board of Trus
tees and faculty, alumni and former
students —are now in active govern
ment service, as shown by figures com
piled by the University committee on
war information, of which J. E. Mc-
Dowell, assistant registrar and alumni
secretary, is chairman.
Stars representing 1130 men who
are in military service will decorate
the large service flag to be unfurled
at the celebration of Founders' Day,
March 10. In addition to these are
more than IGO men and women in
other forms of service to which they
are giving their time wholly or in part.
Only those who are known to be ac
tually in service are included in the
totals.
From the faculty have gone approx
imately seventy-five. Twenty-five of
these are in military service, most of
them commissioned with ranks from
lieutenant up to major. There are
some twenty-live others doing non
military work to which they are giv
ing their full time, and twenty-five
more who are making investigations
and doing research work while con
tinuing their academic duties.
Five Valuable Men Wiven.
Stanford's most notable contribu
tion is Herbert Hoover, an alumnus
and a member of the Hoard of Trus
tees, who is United States Food Ad
ministrator. President Ray Lyman
Wilbur has given most of his time

since war was declared lo duties with
the Food Administration as chairman
of the food conservation division.
Professor Vernon L. Kellogg of the
Entomology department is another
right hand man in the food adminis
tration. He is now in Washington, as
is President Wilbur.
The important post of chairman of
the National Committee on Aeronau- i
tics is filled by Dr. William F. Durand, j
professor of mechanical engineering.
He is now in France studying war
problems, collecting and classifying
information for the United States.
Another responsible place in admin
istration is held hy Professor David
M. Folsom of the Geology and Mining
department, who is federal fuel ad
ministrator for the Pacific coast
states.
Stan Ford's part in the war is not
marked so much by money expenditure
as by the more important personal
services of men fitted for the vitally
important duties at this time. Many
of them are serving without govern
ment pay, with the University con
tinuing their regular salaries.
The list of activities includes food
conservation, service of mercy, con
fidential investigations and researches,
military training for students and in
struction in French for officers and
soldiers stationed at Camp Fremont.
Before the United States entered the
war, Stanford had made a survey of
faculty, alumni, and undergraduates
to collect data on their special prep
aration for various forms of war time
service, immediately upon the declar
ation of war the trustees placed at the
disposal of the government for the
period of the war the entire equip
ment of the institution, including not
only grounds, buildings, and labora-

tories, but the training and skill of its
ablest scientists.
Intensive military training for all
men students was provided at once,
and scores of these have since been
commissioned in the army and navy
to train other men. Further military
training is being given for all men
who wish to enroll in the Reserve Of
ficers' Training Corps here. The call
to arms took the University's first
military professor, but another has
been obtained in his place.
Camp Fremont, one of the largest
cantonments, is located partly on
Stanford University land. To the of
ficers and soldiers there five members
of the faculty are giving instruction
in French. In the work of establishing
a library for the men at Camp Fre
mont the Stanford Library has helped,
and one member of the Library staff
has been assigned there.
In order that students and alumni
may find the work for which they are
best fitted the University maintains a
committee on war information. All
calls for service from the intercol
legiate Intelligence Bureau are given
publicity among undergraduates and
alumni.
Five Mercy Units.
Naval Base Hospital Unit No. 2 was
organized by the Stanford Medical
School, with Dr. Stanley Stillman,
professor of surgery, as its head and
with eleven medical instructors and
seven nurses among its personnel.
It has been called into active service.
A large number of other members of
the Medical School staff are in ser
vice.
Four ambulance units composed of
undergraduates and alumni have been

formed and are now serving on the
European battle-fronts.
Besides Hoover, Wilbur, and Kel
logg, in the food administration is
another faculty man, Everett W.
Smith, assistant professor English
(journalism), who is directing pub
licity.

Dr. D 11. Camp
bell, Member of
National Couneil
of Defense.
Thirteen hundred men and women
from Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity—members of the Board of Trus
tees and faculty, alumni and former
students —are now in active govern
ment service, as shown by figures com
piled by the University committee on
war information, of which J. E. Mc-
Dowell, assistant registrar and alumni
secretary, is chairman.
Stars representing 1130 men who
are in military service will decorate
the large service flag to be unfurled
at the celebration of Founders' Day,
March 10. In addition to these are
more than IGO men and women in
other forms of service to which they
are giving their time wholly or in part.
Only those who are known to be ac
tually in service are included in the
totals.
From the faculty have gone approx
imately seventy-five. Twenty-five of
these are in military service, most of
them commissioned with ranks from
lieutenant up to major. There are
some twenty-live others doing non
military work to which they are giv
ing their full time, and twenty-five
more who are making investigations
and doing research work while con
tinuing their academic duties.
Five Valuable Men Wiven.
Stanford's most notable contribu
tion is Herbert Hoover, an alumnus
and a member of the Hoard of Trus
tees, who is United States Food Ad
ministrator. President Ray Lyman
Wilbur has given most of his time

since war was declared lo duties with
the Food Administration as chairman
of the food conservation division.
Professor Vernon L. Kellogg of the
Entomology department is another
right hand man in the food adminis
tration. He is now in Washington, as
is President Wilbur.
The important post of chairman of
the National Committee on Aeronau- i
tics is filled by Dr. William F. Durand, j
professor of mechanical engineering.
He is now in France studying war
problems, collecting and classifying
information for the United States.
Another responsible place in admin
istration is held hy Professor David
M. Folsom of the Geology and Mining
department, who is federal fuel ad
ministrator for the Pacific coast
states.
Stan Ford's part in the war is not
marked so much by money expenditure
as by the more important personal
services of men fitted for the vitally
important duties at this time. Many
of them are serving without govern
ment pay, with the University con
tinuing their regular salaries.
The list of activities includes food
conservation, service of mercy, con
fidential investigations and researches,
military training for students and in
struction in French for officers and
soldiers stationed at Camp Fremont.
Before the United States entered the
war, Stanford had made a survey of
faculty, alumni, and undergraduates
to collect data on their special prep
aration for various forms of war time
service, immediately upon the declar
ation of war the trustees placed at the
disposal of the government for the
period of the war the entire equip
ment of the institution, including not
only grounds, buildings, and labora-

tories, but the training and skill of its
ablest scientists.
Intensive military training for all
men students was provided at once,
and scores of these have since been
commissioned in the army and navy
to train other men. Further military
training is being given for all men
who wish to enroll in the Reserve Of
ficers' Training Corps here. The call
to arms took the University's first
military professor, but another has
been obtained in his place.
Camp Fremont, one of the largest
cantonments, is located partly on
Stanford University land. To the of
ficers and soldiers there five members
of the faculty are giving instruction
in French. In the work of establishing
a library for the men at Camp Fre
mont the Stanford Library has helped,
and one member of the Library staff
has been assigned there.
In order that students and alumni
may find the work for which they are
best fitted the University maintains a
committee on war information. All
calls for service from the intercol
legiate Intelligence Bureau are given
publicity among undergraduates and
alumni.
Five Mercy Units.
Naval Base Hospital Unit No. 2 was
organized by the Stanford Medical
School, with Dr. Stanley Stillman,
professor of surgery, as its head and
with eleven medical instructors and
seven nurses among its personnel.
It has been called into active service.
A large number of other members of
the Medical School staff are in ser
vice.
Four ambulance units composed of
undergraduates and alumni have been

formed and are now serving on the
European battle-fronts.
Besides Hoover, Wilbur, and Kel
logg, in the food administration is
another faculty man, Everett W.
Smith, assistant professor English
(journalism), who is directing pub
licity.
Makes Propeller Investigation.
Although not a regular member of
the aeronautics committee of which
Professor Durand is the head, E. P.
Lesley, associate professor of mechan
ical engineering, has done important
investigation on aeroplane propellers.
Dr. Lewis M. Terman, professor of
education, is a member of the subcom
mittee on methods for the psycholog
ical examination of recruits, National
Research Council. He is also a mem

ber of the committee on classification
of personnel for the National Army.
He has conducted many experiments
in the last year and has helped per
fect a system of intelligence tests
which the recruits are put through.
He recently spent several weeks in
Washington in connection with this
work.

National Couneil
of Defense.
Thirteen hundred men and women
from Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity—members of the Board of Trus
tees and faculty, alumni and former
students —are now in active govern
ment service, as shown by figures com
piled by the University committee on
war information, of which J. E. Mc-
Dowell, assistant registrar and alumni
secretary, is chairman.
Stars representing 1130 men who
are in military service will decorate
the large service flag to be unfurled
at the celebration of Founders' Day,
March 10. In addition to these are
more than IGO men and women in
other forms of service to which they
are giving their time wholly or in part.
Only those who are known to be ac
tually in service are included in the
totals.
From the faculty have gone approx
imately seventy-five. Twenty-five of
these are in military service, most of
them commissioned with ranks from
lieutenant up to major. There are
some twenty-live others doing non
military work to which they are giv
ing their full time, and twenty-five
more who are making investigations
and doing research work while con
tinuing their academic duties.
Five Valuable Men Wiven.
Stanford's most notable contribu
tion is Herbert Hoover, an alumnus
and a member of the Hoard of Trus
tees, who is United States Food Ad
ministrator. President Ray Lyman
Wilbur has given most of his time

since war was declared lo duties with
the Food Administration as chairman
of the food conservation division.
Professor Vernon L. Kellogg of the
Entomology department is another
right hand man in the food adminis
tration. He is now in Washington, as
is President Wilbur.
The important post of chairman of
the National Committee on Aeronau- i
tics is filled by Dr. William F. Durand, j
professor of mechanical engineering.
He is now in France studying war
problems, collecting and classifying
information for the United States.
Another responsible place in admin
istration is held hy Professor David
M. Folsom of the Geology and Mining
department, who is federal fuel ad
ministrator for the Pacific coast
states.
Stan Ford's part in the war is not
marked so much by money expenditure
as by the more important personal
services of men fitted for the vitally
important duties at this time. Many
of them are serving without govern
ment pay, with the University con
tinuing their regular salaries.
The list of activities includes food
conservation, service of mercy, con
fidential investigations and researches,
military training for students and in
struction in French for officers and
soldiers stationed at Camp Fremont.
Before the United States entered the
war, Stanford had made a survey of
faculty, alumni, and undergraduates
to collect data on their special prep
aration for various forms of war time
service, immediately upon the declar
ation of war the trustees placed at the
disposal of the government for the
period of the war the entire equip
ment of the institution, including not
only grounds, buildings, and labora-

tories, but the training and skill of its
ablest scientists.
Intensive military training for all
men students was provided at once,
and scores of these have since been
commissioned in the army and navy
to train other men. Further military
training is being given for all men
who wish to enroll in the Reserve Of
ficers' Training Corps here. The call
to arms took the University's first
military professor, but another has
been obtained in his place.
Camp Fremont, one of the largest
cantonments, is located partly on
Stanford University land. To the of
ficers and soldiers there five members
of the faculty are giving instruction
in French. In the work of establishing
a library for the men at Camp Fre
mont the Stanford Library has helped,
and one member of the Library staff
has been assigned there.
In order that students and alumni
may find the work for which they are
best fitted the University maintains a
committee on war information. All
calls for service from the intercol
legiate Intelligence Bureau are given
publicity among undergraduates and
alumni.
Five Mercy Units.
Naval Base Hospital Unit No. 2 was
organized by the Stanford Medical
School, with Dr. Stanley Stillman,
professor of surgery, as its head and
with eleven medical instructors and
seven nurses among its personnel.
It has been called into active service.
A large number of other members of
the Medical School staff are in ser
vice.
Four ambulance units composed of
undergraduates and alumni have been

formed and are now serving on the
European battle-fronts.
Besides Hoover, Wilbur, and Kel
logg, in the food administration is
another faculty man, Everett W.
Smith, assistant professor English
(journalism), who is directing pub
licity.
Makes Propeller Investigation.
Although not a regular member of
the aeronautics committee of which
Professor Durand is the head, E. P.
Lesley, associate professor of mechan

investigation on aeroplane propellers.
Dr. Lewis M. Terman, professor of
education, is a member of the subcom

Dr. D 11. Camp
bell, Member of
National Couneil
of Defense.
Thirteen hundred men and women
from Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity—members of the Board of Trus
tees and faculty, alumni and former
students —are now in active govern
ment service, as shown by figures com
piled by the University committee on
war information, of which J. E. Mc-
Dowell, assistant registrar and alumni
secretary, is chairman.
Stars representing 1130 men who
are in military service will decorate
the large service flag to be unfurled
at the celebration of Founders' Day,
March 10. In addition to these are
more than IGO men and women in
other forms of service to which they
are giving their time wholly or in part.
Only those who are known to be ac
tually in service are included in the
totals.
From the faculty have gone approx
imately seventy-five. Twenty-five of
these are in military service, most of
them commissioned with ranks from
lieutenant up to major. There are
some twenty-live others doing non
military work to which they are giv
ing their full time, and twenty-five
more who are making investigations
and doing research work while con
tinuing their academic duties.
Five Valuable Men Wiven.
Stanford's most notable contribu
tion is Herbert Hoover, an alumnus
and a member of the Hoard of Trus
tees, who is United States Food Ad
ministrator. President Ray Lyman
Wilbur has given most of his time

since war was declared lo duties with
the Food Administration as chairman
of the food conservation division.
Professor Vernon L. Kellogg of the
Entomology department is another
right hand man in the food adminis
tration. He is now in Washington, as
is President Wilbur.
The important post of chairman of
the National Committee on Aeronau- i
tics is filled by Dr. William F. Durand, j
professor of mechanical engineering.
He is now in France studying war
problems, collecting and classifying
information for the United States.
Another responsible place in admin
istration is held hy Professor David
M. Folsom of the Geology and Mining
department, who is federal fuel ad
ministrator for the Pacific coast
states.
Stan Ford's part in the war is not
marked so much by money expenditure
as by the more important personal
services of men fitted for the vitally
important duties at this time. Many
of them are serving without govern
ment pay, with the University con
tinuing their regular salaries.
The list of activities includes food
conservation, service of mercy, con
fidential investigations and researches,
military training for students and in
struction in French for officers and
soldiers stationed at Camp Fremont.
Before the United States entered the
war, Stanford had made a survey of
faculty, alumni, and undergraduates
to collect data on their special prep
aration for various forms of war time
service, immediately upon the declar
ation of war the trustees placed at the
disposal of the government for the
period of the war the entire equip
ment of the institution, including not
only grounds, buildings, and labora-

tories, but the training and skill of its
ablest scientists.
Intensive military training for all
men students was provided at once,
and scores of these have since been
commissioned in the army and navy
to train other men. Further military
training is being given for all men
who wish to enroll in the Reserve Of
ficers' Training Corps here. The call
to arms took the University's first
military professor, but another has
been obtained in his place.
Camp Fremont, one of the largest
cantonments, is located partly on
Stanford University land. To the of
ficers and soldiers there five members
of the faculty are giving instruction
in French. In the work of establishing
a library for the men at Camp Fre
mont the Stanford Library has helped,
and one member of the Library staff
has been assigned there.
In order that students and alumni
may find the work for which they are
best fitted the University maintains a
committee on war information. All
calls for service from the intercol
legiate Intelligence Bureau are given
publicity among undergraduates and
alumni.
Five Mercy Units.
Naval Base Hospital Unit No. 2 was

Dr. D 11. Camp
bell, Member of
National Couneil
of Defense.
Thirteen hundred men and women
from Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity—members of the Board of Trus
tees and faculty, alumni and former
students —are now in active govern
ment service, as shown by figures com
piled by the University committee on
war information, of which J. E. Mc-
Dowell, assistant registrar and alumni
secretary, is chairman.
Stars representing 1130 men who
are in military service will decorate
the large service flag to be unfurled
at the celebration of Founders' Day,
March 10. In addition to these are
more than IGO men and women in
other forms of service to which they
are giving their time wholly or in part.
Only those who are known to be ac
tually in service are included in the
totals.
From the faculty have gone approx
imately seventy-five. Twenty-five of
these are in military service, most of
them commissioned with ranks from
lieutenant up to major. There are
some twenty-live others doing non
military work to which they are giv
ing their full time, and twenty-five
more who are making investigations
and doing research work while con
tinuing their academic duties.
Five Valuable Men Wiven.
Stanford's most notable contribu
tion is Herbert Hoover, an alumnus
and a member of the Hoard of Trus
tees, who is United States Food Ad
ministrator. President Ray Lyman
Wilbur has given most of his time

since war was declared lo duties with
the Food Administration as chairman
of the food conservation division.
Professor Vernon L. Kellogg of the
Entomology department is another
right hand man in the food adminis
tration. He is now in Washington, as
is President Wilbur.
The important post of chairman of
the National Committee on Aeronau- i
tics is filled by Dr. William F. Durand, j
professor of mechanical engineering.
He is now in France studying war
problems, collecting and classifying
information for the United States.
Another responsible place in admin
istration is held hy Professor David
M. Folsom of the Geology and Mining
department, who is federal fuel ad
ministrator for the Pacific coast
states.
Stan Ford's part in the war is not
marked so much by money expenditure
as by the more important personal
services of men fitted for the vitally
important duties at this time. Many
of them are serving without govern
ment pay, with the University con
tinuing their regular salaries.
The list of activities includes food
conservation, service of mercy, con
fidential investigations and researches,
military training for students and in
struction in French for officers and
soldiers stationed at Camp Fremont.
Before the United States entered the
war, Stanford had made a survey of
faculty, alumni, and undergraduates
to collect data on their special prep
aration for various forms of war time
service, immediately upon the declar
ation of war the trustees placed at the
disposal of the government for the
period of the war the entire equip
ment of the institution, including not
only grounds, buildings, and labora-

tories, but the training and skill of its
ablest scientists.
Intensive military training for all
men students was provided at once,
and scores of these have since been
commissioned in the army and navy
to train other men. Further military
training is being given for all men
who wish to enroll in the Reserve Of
ficers' Training Corps here. The call
to arms took the University's first
military professor, but another has
been obtained in his place.
Camp Fremont, one of the largest
cantonments, is located partly on
Stanford University land. To the of
ficers and soldiers there five members
of the faculty are giving instruction
in French. In the work of establishing
a library for the men at Camp Fre
mont the Stanford Library has helped,
and one member of the Library staff
has been assigned there.
In order that students and alumni
may find the work for which they are
best fitted the University maintains a
committee on war information. All
calls for service from the intercol
legiate Intelligence Bureau are given
publicity among undergraduates and
alumni.
Five Mercy Units.
Naval Base Hospital Unit No. 2 was
organized by the Stanford Medical
School, with Dr. Stanley Stillman,
professor of surgery, as its head and
with eleven medical instructors and
seven nurses among its personnel.
It has been called into active service.
A large number of other members of
the Medical School staff are in ser
vice.
Four ambulance units composed of
undergraduates and alumni have been

formed and are now serving on the
European battle-fronts.
Besides Hoover, Wilbur, and Kel
logg, in the food administration is
another faculty man, Everett W.
Smith, assistant professor English
(journalism), who is directing pub
licity.
Makes Propeller Investigation.
Although not a regular member of
the aeronautics committee of which
Professor Durand is the head, E. P.
Lesley, associate professor of mechan
ical engineering, has done important
investigation on aeroplane propellers.
Dr. Lewis M. Terman, professor of
education, is a member of the subcom
mittee on methods for the psycholog
ical examination of recruits, National
Research Council. He is also a mem

ber of the committee on classification
of personnel for the National Army.
He has conducted many experiments
in the last year and has helped per
fect a system of intelligence tests
which the recruits are put through.
He recently spent several weeks in
Washington in connection with this
work.

Dr. D 11. Camp
bell, Member of
National Couneil
of Defense.
Thirteen hundred men and women
from Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity—members of the Board of Trus
tees and faculty, alumni and former
students —are now in active govern
ment service, as shown by figures com
piled by the University committee on
war information, of which J. E. Mc-
Dowell, assistant registrar and alumni
secretary, is chairman.
Stars representing 1130 men who
are in military service will decorate
the large service flag to be unfurled
at the celebration of Founders' Day,
March 10. In addition to these are
more than IGO men and women in
other forms of service to which they
are giving their time wholly or in part.
Only those who are known to be ac
tually in service are included in the
totals.
From the faculty have gone approx
imately seventy-five. Twenty-five of
these are in military service, most of
them commissioned with ranks from
lieutenant up to major. There are
some twenty-live others doing non
military work to which they are giv
ing their full time, and twenty-five
more who are making investigations
and doing research work while con
tinuing their academic duties.
Five Valuable Men Wiven.
Stanford's most notable contribu
tion is Herbert Hoover, an alumnus
and a member of the Hoard of Trus
tees, who is United States Food Ad
ministrator. President Ray Lyman
Wilbur has given most of his time

since war was declared lo duties with
the Food Administration as chairman
of the food conservation division.
Professor Vernon L. Kellogg of the
Entomology department is another
right hand man in the food adminis
tration. He is now in Washington, as
is President Wilbur.
The important post of chairman of
the National Committee on Aeronau- i
tics is filled by Dr. William F. Durand, j
professor of mechanical engineering.
He is now in France studying war
problems, collecting and classifying
information for the United States.
Another responsible place in admin
istration is held hy Professor David
M. Folsom of the Geology and Mining
department, who is federal fuel ad
ministrator for the Pacific coast
states.
Stan Ford's part in the war is not
marked so much by money expenditure
as by the more important personal
services of men fitted for the vitally
important duties at this time. Many
of them are serving without govern
ment pay, with the University con
tinuing their regular salaries.
The list of activities includes food
conservation, service of mercy, con
fidential investigations and researches,
military training for students and in
struction in French for officers and
soldiers stationed at Camp Fremont.
Before the United States entered the
war, Stanford had made a survey of
faculty, alumni, and undergraduates
to collect data on their special prep
aration for various forms of war time
service, immediately upon the declar
ation of war the trustees placed at the
disposal of the government for the
period of the war the entire equip
ment of the institution, including not
only grounds, buildings, and labora-

tories, but the training and skill of its
ablest scientists.
Intensive military training for all
men students was provided at once,
and scores of these have since been
commissioned in the army and navy
to train other men. Further military
training is being given for all men
who wish to enroll in the Reserve Of
ficers' Training Corps here. The call
to arms took the University's first
military professor, but another has
been obtained in his place.
Camp Fremont, one of the largest
cantonments, is located partly on
Stanford University land. To the of
ficers and soldiers there five members
of the faculty are giving instruction
in French. In the work of establishing
a library for the men at Camp Fre
mont the Stanford Library has helped,
and one member of the Library staff
has been assigned there.
In order that students and alumni
may find the work for which they are
best fitted the University maintains a
committee on war information. All
calls for service from the intercol
legiate Intelligence Bureau are given
publicity among undergraduates and
alumni.
Five Mercy Units.
Naval Base Hospital Unit No. 2 was
organized by the Stanford Medical
School, with Dr. Stanley Stillman,
professor of surgery, as its head and
with eleven medical instructors and
seven nurses among its personnel.
It has been called into active service.
A large number of other members of
the Medical School staff are in ser
vice.
Four ambulance units composed of
undergraduates and alumni have been

formed and are now serving on the
European battle-fronts.
Besides Hoover, Wilbur, and Kel
logg, in the food administration is
another faculty man, Everett W.
Smith, assistant professor English
(journalism), who is directing pub
licity.
Makes Propeller Investigation.
Although not a regular member of
the aeronautics committee of which
Professor Durand is the head, E. P.
Lesley, associate professor of mechan
ical engineering, has done important
investigation on aeroplane propellers.
Dr. Lewis M. Terman, professor of
education, is a member of the subcom
mittee on methods for the psycholog
ical examination of recruits, National
Research Council. He is also a mem

ber of the committee on classification
of personnel for the National Army.
