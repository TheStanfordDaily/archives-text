# STANFORD SENDS MANY MEN INTO NATIONAL SERVICE
## UNIVERSITY FLAG WILL HOLD 1300 STARS Seventy-five from Faculty Serve Government, Many in High Places By Ural N. Hoffman, Instructor in Journalism. 
### 
Thirteen hundred men and women
from Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity—members of the Board of Trus
tees and faculty, alumni and former
students —are now in active govern
ment service, as shown by figures com
piled by the University committee on
war information, of which J. E. Mc-
Dowell, assistant registrar and alumni
secretary, is chairman.
Stars representing 1130 men who
are in military service will decorate
the large service flag to be unfurled
at the celebration of Founders' Day,
March 10. In addition to these are
more than IGO men and women in
other forms of service to which they
are giving their time wholly or in part.
Only those who are known to be ac
tually in service are included in the
totals.
From the faculty have gone approx
imately seventy-five. Twenty-five of
these are in military service, most of
them commissioned with ranks from
lieutenant up to major. There are
some twenty-live others doing non
military work to which they are giv
ing their full time, and twenty-five
more who are making investigations
and doing research work while con
tinuing their academic duties.
Five Valuable Men Wiven.
Stanford's most notable contribu
tion is Herbert Hoover, an alumnus
and a member of the Hoard of Trus
tees, who is United States Food Ad
ministrator. President Ray Lyman
Wilbur has given most of his time

since war was declared lo duties with
the Food Administration as chairman
of the food conservation division.
Professor Vernon L. Kellogg of the
Entomology department is another
right hand man in the food adminis
tration. He is now in Washington, as
is President Wilbur.
The important post of chairman of
the National Committee on Aeronau- i
tics is filled by Dr. William F. Durand, j
professor of mechanical engineering.
He is now in France studying war
problems, collecting and classifying
information for the United States.
Another responsible place in admin
istration is held hy Professor David
M. Folsom of the Geology and Mining
department, who is federal fuel ad
ministrator for the Pacific coast
states.
Stan Ford's part in the war is not
marked so much by money expenditure
as by the more important personal
services of men fitted for the vitally
important duties at this time. Many
of them are serving without govern
ment pay, with the University con
tinuing their regular salaries.
The list of activities includes food
conservation, service of mercy, con
fidential investigations and researches,
military training for students and in
struction in French for officers and
soldiers stationed at Camp Fremont.
Before the United States entered the
war, Stanford had made a survey of
faculty, alumni, and undergraduates
to collect data on their special prep
aration for various forms of war time
service, immediately upon the declar
ation of war the trustees placed at the
disposal of the government for the
period of the war the entire equip
ment of the institution, including not
only grounds, buildings, and labora-
