# Benefit for Lane Clinic Is March 1
## Proceeds of Dance to Rent House in Place of the Isolation Hospital 
### 
A benefit dance for tlie Stanford
Free Lane Clinic lias been scheduled
for Friday, March 1, in the Women's
Club House.
Each summer the Stanford Isola
tion Hospital has been used by the
clinic as an outting place for poor and
needy children, but owing to the four
quarter system now in effect it will
be impossible to continue this plan.
As so many children have been mate
rially benefited by the outting,Â» the
clinic is in hopes to raise sufficient
funds to enable them to rent a house
with which they can continue the sys
tem next summer.
The dance will be a 1 o'clock affair
and will be one of the best of the
year.
