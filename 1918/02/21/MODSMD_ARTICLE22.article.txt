# Authority on Gardening To Give Address Monday
## 
### 
War gardens cultivated by women
are the latest means which the
"500" have discussed to aid the great
national food crisis. In order that the
undertaking may be fully understood
before the gardens are begun, Miss
Harriet Bradford, dean of women,
has secured an authority on garden
ing in California to speak to the
women of the University.
Mrs. Myrtle S. Francis of Ventura,
California, a member of the Farm and
Garden Association, will speak Mon
day afternoon in the Women's Club
House at 4:15 on the "Needs for
Women in Agriculture in California
During the War." Miss Bradford
wishes that all the women would come
to this meeting and receive first-hand
information on this important subject
from one who has studied the situa
tion carefully.
