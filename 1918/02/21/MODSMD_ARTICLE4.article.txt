## 
### H.G. Swendsen, '20 
California came back last night on
her own lloor and evened up the bas
ketball series between the Cardinal
and Blue and Gold in a 27 to 24 win.
The game was so close throughout that
the winner was only decided in the
last few minutes of play, when Grul,
at guard for Berkeley, shot a basket
from the middle of the floor and
sewed up the game. The California
team played about the same brand of
ball they put up in the first game in
Encina gymnasium, but Stanford
failed to take advantage of her op
portunities and so lost.
Stanford Leads.
Stanford led at half-time 13 to 12,
when Schwarzenbek and Moulton an
nexed three points on a basket and a
foul shot in the last minute of play.
The Cardinals were lost in the first ten
minutes of this period and allowed the
Bruin combination to pile up six
points before Stanford got under way.
These points came on two baskets by
Anderson and two fouls by Salmina.
Then a shot by Butt from the center
of the floor started things, and the Var
sity was soon within striking distance
of California, when Schwarzenbek and
Moulton followed with a basket each.
Both teams fouled consistently dur
ing the first fifteen minutes of the first

period, but California was the worst
offender and allowed Moulton to take
11 shots for fouls, 5 of which he con
verted. With the score 10 to 12 in
the last minute of the naif Schwarzen
bek snared a basket and Moulton shot
another foul, putting the Cardinal in
the lead. California's 12 points came
mainly through Anderson, who found
the basket three times.
California Takes Lead.
California really put the game on
ice at the opening of the second half
when a spurt put the Bruins back in
the lead. Stanford rallied, however,
and began a losing battle until the end
of the contest. In the second half the
play settled down to defensive ball, al
though California got several good
shots at the basket when most of the
Stanford team went to sleep. Butt at
guard was the only man who put up
a consistent guarding game, although
Schwarzenbek was throwing baskets
from all over the floor when the Card
inal was on the offense.
In the second half Cuffe found his
eye for California and made two field
baskets, while Grul at. guard came
through with two sensational goals
from the middle of the floor. Ander
son and Salmina contributed their
share with a basket each. For
Stanford, Schwarzenbek made three
