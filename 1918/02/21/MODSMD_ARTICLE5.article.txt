## 
### 
Yvette Guilbert, known as the
"queen of art," will bring to her Stan
ford audience the spirit of France in
its struggle for freedom and democ
racy when she appears in her costume
song recital next Monday night.
The famous artiste has made a
minute study of peasant life of the
different periods of French history
and has designed a number of gowns
which she uses in illustrating her pro
gram. These costumes have caused a
great deal of admiration in all the
cities in which Madame Guilbert has
appeared.
The highest praise lias been given
the talented musician by critics in all
countries. Her wonderful success has
been all the more remarkable since
she has had to overcome the greatest
difficulties in her rise from a poor
dressmaker to her position as a mu
sician of international reputation.
The recital will consist of popular
songs and those of a more classical
nature, thus furnishing a program of
varied interest such as will suit a col
lege audience. She interprets her
songs with the greatest understand-'
ing and delicacy, and has created in
her work an art which is distinctive
and original. A noticeable feature of
her interpretation of the use which
she makes of her hands.
Appearing with Madame Guilbert
are two artists of talent, Emily Gros
ser, violinist, and Maurice Eisner,
pianist, who have done notable work
throughout the concert tour.

The concert is being given to aid the
people of northern France who have
suffered such hardships since the in-

Yvette Guilbert, known as the
"queen of art," will bring to her Stan
ford audience the spirit of France in
its struggle for freedom and democ
racy when she appears in her costume
song recital next Monday night.
The famous artiste has made a
minute study of peasant life of the
different periods of French history
and has designed a number of gowns
which she uses in illustrating her pro
gram. These costumes have caused a
great deal of admiration in all the
cities in which Madame Guilbert has
appeared.
The highest praise lias been given
the talented musician by critics in all
countries. Her wonderful success has
been all the more remarkable since
she has had to overcome the greatest
difficulties in her rise from a poor
dressmaker to her position as a mu
sician of international reputation.
The recital will consist of popular
songs and those of a more classical
nature, thus furnishing a program of
varied interest such as will suit a col
lege audience. She interprets her
songs with the greatest understand-'
ing and delicacy, and has created in
her work an art which is distinctive
and original. A noticeable feature of
her interpretation of the use which
she makes of her hands.
Appearing with Madame Guilbert
are two artists of talent, Emily Gros
ser, violinist, and Maurice Eisner,
pianist, who have done notable work
throughout the concert tour.

The concert is being given to aid the
people of northern France who have
suffered such hardships since the in-
