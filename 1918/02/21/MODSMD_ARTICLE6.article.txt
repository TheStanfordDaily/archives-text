# PROM TO BE HELD IN ENCINA
## 
### 
Providing a fitting climax for the
festivities of Junior Week the 1919
Junior Prom will be held on Friday
evening, March 8, in Encina Hall, in
stead of in the gymnasium as for
merly. Tickets for the Prom will go
on sale next Monday, and may later
be exchanged for programs. Posters
announcing the ticket sale will bo dis
played on the campus Monday.
One of the distinct features of the
Prom will be the programs, which are
to be the work of M. A. Oliver, *15.
They will be of gray leather, painted

in a handsome design.
A light spring motive will be carried
out in the decorations, which, accord
ing to the committee in charge, are
to be "Hooverized" as much as pos
sible. As a war-time economy meas
ure, the regular "eats" will be dis
pensed with, though punch will be
served.
As only two weeks remain before
the Prom, the committee is rushing
the plans for the affair to completion,
and final details will be announced
shortly.
