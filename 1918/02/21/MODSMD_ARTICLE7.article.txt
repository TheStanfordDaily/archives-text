## 
### 
At 8 o'clock tonight the men of the
Stanford R. O. T. C. and their guests
will gather in Encina gymnasium for
the second annual ball. In spite of
minor difficulties which occurred at
first, the ball now promises to out
strip even last year's affair in size and
importance.
The attendance of the leading mili
tary men on the coast will make the
R. O. T. C. ball a big factor in keep
ing Stanford on the military map.
Stanford men will also be furnished
an opportunity of meeting army lead
ers under whom many of them will
in all probability serve when they en
ter the service.
Work on the floor of the gymnasium
was finished yesterday. Ernest
Brandsten, who has been connected
with the gymnasium since it was built,
stated that it was in better shape than
he has ever seen it for any previous
dance.
Decorations were put up this after
noon. The flag which covers the ceil
ing is not only the largest American
flag in the world but larger than any
flag of any nation now in existence.
Tt has been used in parades all over
the United States and is the property
of W. A. Plummer & Company of San
Francisco. Its use for tonight has
been donated by that firm.
