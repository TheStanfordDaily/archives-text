# CAPTAINS ARE NAMED FOR IRISH MARATHON
## 
### 
Class captains for the Irish Mara
thon were announced last evening by
Track Captain A. F. Wilson. The
men named by him to conduct the
destinies of their respective classes
in the annual relay event were: J.
D. McPlierson for the seniors, M. J.
House for the juniors, E. L. Davis for
the 1920 men, and K. A. Wright for
the freshmen.
McPherson is a veteran of the
squad and former cross-country cap
tain; House was the largest individ
ual point gatherer in the meet last
year; Davis starred for the freshmen
against the Blue and Gold babes in
last year's meet, and Wright has been
showing consistent work and interest
in track throughout the entire early
part of the season.
The captains are to take complete
charge of their class teams and are
expected to see that full teams of
twenty-four men are entered. Try
outs will be held from now until the
date of the marathon, which has not
been definitely set as yet, but is to
be held some time in Junior Week.
The holdovers will commence work
in the near future upon their stunt
to liven up the marathon. As a pos
sible further attraction, some sort of
competition with the men from Fre
mont may be arranged as part of the
Irish marathon festivities.
