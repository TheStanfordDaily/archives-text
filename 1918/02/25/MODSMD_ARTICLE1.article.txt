# Y.W.C.A. CONFERENCE DELEGATES MEET AT STANFORD
## COLLEGE WOMEN GATHER Meetings Are Addressed by Prominent Speakers On Timely Subjects 
### 
Over one hundred delegates from the
University of California, Wills Col
lege, the University of Nevada, Col
lego of the Pacific, San Jose Normal,
and Chieo Normal attended the an
nual mid-winter conference of the Y.
W. C. A. held here last, week-end.
Dr. Aurelia Henry Reinhardt gave
the opening address to the conference
in the Little Theater Friday evening.
Dr. Reinhardt spoke on "Self-Con
scription" as one phase in the finding
of each woman's work. This subject
was c onsidered in the light of the
educational opportunities in our de
mocracy.
"The mind of man," stated this tal
ented college president, "is never fin
ished growing, but grows as long as
you are a student." Adapting her talk
to the needs of college women, she
presented practical ideas for action
in the present world struggle, and
linked these with the standards for
which the Y. W. C. A. is working.
Miss Ellen Calhoun, '20, annual
member of the Y. W. C. A. from Stan
ford, presided at the Saturday morn
ing meeting of the conference. Dr.
Noel Porter of San Jose addressed the
women on "Seeing Life Whole."
"We can only see life whole," said
Dr. Porter, "through the medium of
Christ and the Bible. The art of see
ing life whole consists in the building
of a Christ-like character. Life is a
building, rising slowly day by day.
Every lesson we learn, every conver
sation and every experience, adds
something to enrich the edifice rising
within us.
"There are five laws for the build
ing of a Christ-like character. The
first of these is simplicity, drawn from
the simplicity and obscurity of the
birth and teachings of Christ. Sim
plicity is strength. Plain living and
high thinking is the demand of the
hour. The second great law is sin
cerity. There can be no greatness
without sincerity and integrity. Every
lie is confession of weakness. Sym
pathy is the third law. This is a vir
tue which college women need to cul
tivate. It is a great advantage to be
a scholar, but we must not neglect
' the greatest thing—(lie heart.
| "The fourth law is strength. Im
patience is prevalent today. The
Christian c haracter cannot be
achieved in a day or a year, but re
quires a lifetime. Self-sacrifice, man
ifested in Christ's entire life, is the
i last of the laws forming the secret of
'Seeing Life 'Whole.'"
Miss M. A. Babson of Los Angeles
followed Dr. Porter with an informal
discussion of the movement for the
I formation of groups for Bible study
! among college women of the country.
J Speakers from Mills College, the Uni-
I versity of California, and San Jose
I Normal outlined the plans in opera-
I tion in their institutions.
I Miss Helen Baker of the University
lof California gave a short talk on
| "Have "Wo Time?" She pointed out
[that by thinking ahead and planning
the day's work, the college woman can
save time and work under high pres
sure. Singing of association hymns
concluded the morning session.
At the meeting Saturday afternoon,
I representatives from the colleges gave
I short interesting talks. Miss Marion
! Brown, president of the University of
California Y. W. C. A., spoke and
Miss Ruth Bacon, '17, secretary of the
San Jose Normal Association, told of

j pie." "Parliamentary Law" was the

I graduate of the University of Nevada,
i spoke on "What College Activities
i Have Done for Me Now." Miss Ha - .'
! riet Bradford, dean of women, gave
j a very helpful talk on "What the
! World Will Ask of Us."

I and secretaries. Miss Lydia Innes of

| selves. Insight determines what we j
I shall get out of life. The needs of

lege, the University of Nevada, Col
lego of the Pacific, San Jose Normal,
and Chieo Normal attended the an
nual mid-winter conference of the Y.
W. C. A. held here last, week-end.
Dr. Aurelia Henry Reinhardt gave
the opening address to the conference
in the Little Theater Friday evening.
Dr. Reinhardt spoke on "Self-Con
scription" as one phase in the finding
of each woman's work. This subject
was c onsidered in the light of the
educational opportunities in our de
mocracy.
"The mind of man," stated this tal
ented college president, "is never fin
ished growing, but grows as long as
you are a student." Adapting her talk
to the needs of college women, she
presented practical ideas for action
in the present world struggle, and
linked these with the standards for
which the Y. W. C. A. is working.
Miss Ellen Calhoun, '20, annual
member of the Y. W. C. A. from Stan
ford, presided at the Saturday morn
ing meeting of the conference. Dr.
Noel Porter of San Jose addressed the
women on "Seeing Life Whole."
"We can only see life whole," said
Dr. Porter, "through the medium of
Christ and the Bible. The art of see
ing life whole consists in the building
of a Christ-like character. Life is a
building, rising slowly day by day.
Every lesson we learn, every conver
sation and every experience, adds
something to enrich the edifice rising
within us.
"There are five laws for the build
ing of a Christ-like character. The
first of these is simplicity, drawn from
the simplicity and obscurity of the
birth and teachings of Christ. Sim
plicity is strength. Plain living and
high thinking is the demand of the
hour. The second great law is sin
cerity. There can be no greatness
without sincerity and integrity. Every
lie is confession of weakness. Sym
pathy is the third law. This is a vir
tue which college women need to cul
tivate. It is a great advantage to be
a scholar, but we must not neglect
' the greatest thing—(lie heart.
| "The fourth law is strength. Im
patience is prevalent today. The
Christian c haracter cannot be
achieved in a day or a year, but re
quires a lifetime. Self-sacrifice, man
ifested in Christ's entire life, is the
i last of the laws forming the secret of
'Seeing Life 'Whole.'"
Miss M. A. Babson of Los Angeles
followed Dr. Porter with an informal
discussion of the movement for the
I formation of groups for Bible study
! among college women of the country.

I Miss Helen Baker of the University
lof California gave a short talk on
| "Have "Wo Time?" She pointed out

the day's work, the college woman can
save time and work under high pres
sure. Singing of association hymns
concluded the morning session.

in the Little Theater Friday evening.
Dr. Reinhardt spoke on "Self-Con
scription" as one phase in the finding
of each woman's work. This subject
was c onsidered in the light of the
educational opportunities in our de
mocracy.
"The mind of man," stated this tal
ented college president, "is never fin
ished growing, but grows as long as
you are a student." Adapting her talk
to the needs of college women, she
presented practical ideas for action
in the present world struggle, and
linked these with the standards for
which the Y. W. C. A. is working.
Miss Ellen Calhoun, '20, annual
member of the Y. W. C. A. from Stan
ford, presided at the Saturday morn
ing meeting of the conference. Dr.
Noel Porter of San Jose addressed the
women on "Seeing Life Whole."
"We can only see life whole," said
Dr. Porter, "through the medium of
Christ and the Bible. The art of see
ing life whole consists in the building
of a Christ-like character. Life is a
building, rising slowly day by day.
Every lesson we learn, every conver
sation and every experience, adds
something to enrich the edifice rising
within us.
"There are five laws for the build
ing of a Christ-like character. The
first of these is simplicity, drawn from
the simplicity and obscurity of the
birth and teachings of Christ. Sim
plicity is strength. Plain living and
high thinking is the demand of the
hour. The second great law is sin
cerity. There can be no greatness
without sincerity and integrity. Every
lie is confession of weakness. Sym
pathy is the third law. This is a vir
tue which college women need to cul
tivate. It is a great advantage to be
a scholar, but we must not neglect
' the greatest thing—(lie heart.
| "The fourth law is strength. Im
patience is prevalent today. The
Christian c haracter cannot be
achieved in a day or a year, but re
quires a lifetime. Self-sacrifice, man
ifested in Christ's entire life, is the
i last of the laws forming the secret of
'Seeing Life 'Whole.'"
Miss M. A. Babson of Los Angeles
followed Dr. Porter with an informal
discussion of the movement for the
I formation of groups for Bible study
! among college women of the country.

iand especially for the college woman.
There are many roads leading beyond |

I shall get out of life. The needs of
the world beyond the campus are to
be answered by a strong, vital faith."

Over one hundred delegates from the
University of California, Wills Col
lege, the University of Nevada, Col
lego of the Pacific, San Jose Normal,
and Chieo Normal attended the an
nual mid-winter conference of the Y.
W. C. A. held here last, week-end.
Dr. Aurelia Henry Reinhardt gave
the opening address to the conference
in the Little Theater Friday evening.
Dr. Reinhardt spoke on "Self-Con
scription" as one phase in the finding
of each woman's work. This subject
was c onsidered in the light of the
educational opportunities in our de
mocracy.
"The mind of man," stated this tal
ented college president, "is never fin
ished growing, but grows as long as
you are a student." Adapting her talk
to the needs of college women, she
presented practical ideas for action
in the present world struggle, and
linked these with the standards for
which the Y. W. C. A. is working.
Miss Ellen Calhoun, '20, annual
member of the Y. W. C. A. from Stan
ford, presided at the Saturday morn
ing meeting of the conference. Dr.
Noel Porter of San Jose addressed the
women on "Seeing Life Whole."
"We can only see life whole," said
Dr. Porter, "through the medium of
Christ and the Bible. The art of see
ing life whole consists in the building
of a Christ-like character. Life is a
building, rising slowly day by day.
Every lesson we learn, every conver
sation and every experience, adds
something to enrich the edifice rising
within us.
"There are five laws for the build
ing of a Christ-like character. The
first of these is simplicity, drawn from
the simplicity and obscurity of the
birth and teachings of Christ. Sim
plicity is strength. Plain living and
high thinking is the demand of the
hour. The second great law is sin
cerity. There can be no greatness
without sincerity and integrity. Every
lie is confession of weakness. Sym
pathy is the third law. This is a vir
tue which college women need to cul
tivate. It is a great advantage to be
a scholar, but we must not neglect
' the greatest thing—(lie heart.
| "The fourth law is strength. Im
patience is prevalent today. The
Christian c haracter cannot be
achieved in a day or a year, but re
quires a lifetime. Self-sacrifice, man
ifested in Christ's entire life, is the
i last of the laws forming the secret of
'Seeing Life 'Whole.'"
Miss M. A. Babson of Los Angeles
followed Dr. Porter with an informal
discussion of the movement for the
I formation of groups for Bible study
! among college women of the country.
J Speakers from Mills College, the Uni-
I versity of California, and San Jose
I Normal outlined the plans in opera-
I tion in their institutions.
I Miss Helen Baker of the University
lof California gave a short talk on
| "Have "Wo Time?" She pointed out
[that by thinking ahead and planning
the day's work, the college woman can
save time and work under high pres
sure. Singing of association hymns
concluded the morning session.
At the meeting Saturday afternoon,
I representatives from the colleges gave
I short interesting talks. Miss Marion
! Brown, president of the University of
California Y. W. C. A., spoke and

j pie." "Parliamentary Law" was the
