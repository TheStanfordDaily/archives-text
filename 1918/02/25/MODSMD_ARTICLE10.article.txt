# Y.M.C.A. STARTS CAMPAIGN
## 
### 
At 7 o'clock tonight the Y. M. C. A.
campaign for the enrollment of Stan
ford students in study classes and dis
cussion groups will actively begin in
Encina Ilall. Local leaders have been
busy for several weeks and have
worked out minutely the details of the
campaign until all that remains is the
actual enrollment of the students in
classes.
Meetings will be held tonight in one
or two rooms on every floor of the
Hall at which the prospective leaders
of the discussion groups will outline
the plans to the men. Places of meet
ing are given below and will be posted
in the Hall.
"The Principles Underlying a Chris
tian Democracy" is the subject to be
discussed in the groups. This subject
is of especial importance at this time
in that these are the principles upon
which President Wilson bases his
hopes of a future without war. Stan

ford's attempt to enroll, at a minimum,
350 men, is a part of a national edu
cative campaign which is being under
taken in all the colleges of the United
States and Canada. Its purpose is to
acquaint students with those prini
; ciples which are generally recognized
to form the foundation for a true
1 democracy.
| Classes will meet once a week (for
forty-five minutes) at a time conven
ient for all and will be so conductod
| as to be beneficial without any pre
vious study. They will be managed on
ja purely discussionary basis, giving
I everyone a chance to express bis opin
j ions on the topics.
Natural leaders from the ranks of
seniors and graduates have been se
: lected to load the discussions. These
leaders and their assistants will be
i previously trained in normal classes.
There will be two meetings on every
half-floor, except the fifth, at Encina,
