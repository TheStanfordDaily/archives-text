### 
Priccs liav? been changed for the
1918 Junior Opera, and are now an
nounced to be from 50 cents to $1.50,
instead of 75 cents to $1.50, as pre
viously stated. These figures include
the war-tax, for tlie Junior Class in
stead of the purchaser is shouldering
the burden imposed by Uncle Sam.
The seat sale for "Betty's Hoots" will
be held on March 4, a week from to
day, at the Stanford Bookstore and at
Weingartner's in Palo Alto.
Futuristic is the term applied by
art critics to the scenery and cos
tuming for tiie opera, which are de
clared to be weird enough to startle
even a Stanford audience.
Music for the piece is being written
by the members of Ram's Head, and
is said to be fully up to the standard
set by former Junior Opera composi
tions. In particular, "Betty's Boots,"
the theme of the opera, "The Heavenly
Bail," and a wonderful melody about
Stanford, are sure to be big bits, say
tliose few who have heard these pieces.
All of Sunday afternoon was spent

by the east and chorus in posing for
pictures, which will soon be shown to
the campus public. A catastrophe was
narrowly averted when it.was found
that the boots had in truth been lost,
but a strenuous search disclosed them
in time for the show to proceed. Real
bloodshed will be furnished in the sec
ond act, when two "culluhd geramen"
clash with razors on a fire-escape.
Miss Anna Gardner is handling the
part of Bernice Colville exceptionally

; ton, playing the part of Russell Pen
-1 field, is putting his songs over in won
derful shape with his fine, clear voice.
The part of Lemuel Foster, which
i L. L. Pickering handles vnrv success
fully, seems to be unusually well
suited to him. He is putting the neces
sary "jazz" into his work to get it
I over.
All indications point to a record
