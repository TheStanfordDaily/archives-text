# CALIFORNIA-STANFORD TO MEET IN FINAL COURT GAME
## PLAY ON ENCINA FLOOR Deciding Contest of Series Will Start at 8 p.m. Wednesday 
### 
California and Stanford will decide
the basketball championship between
the two universities on Encina Court
Wednesday night at 8 o'clock. The
ifime will be t!ie third of a series of
three contests, the Illue and Gold hav
'ng won the battle at California and
the Cardinal the game here.
From the dope Stanford has the
edge in the final game. In addition
to playing on their own court, the
Stanford men are working together
again after the disruption of the team
hrough injuries and are showing
more basketball class than they have
' el'ore any of the other contests of
the series. Moulton at forward suf
fered in both California games
through playing with a new man,
while Coach Wilson has been giving
his forwards real work-outs the last,
i'ew days and has them playing to
gether again. Since Hood is still in
bad shape with his arm and William
-011 is completely out of it, Bucklin
will in all probability start at forward
again.
In the gaire at California Moulton
and Bucklin were kept away from the
basket because they tried to dribble
instead of pass, and as a result the
superior weight of (he Blue and Gold
men came in to advantage. In the
third contest, the two Cardinal for
wards have been trained to use team
work and they should be able to break
through their opponents' defense.
California will use the same team as
started in both other games in the
contest here. This line-up includes
Cuffe and Captain Salmina at for
ward, Anderson at center, and Greene
and Grul at guard.
Stanford's line-up is as follows:
Bucklin and Moulton, forwards;
Schwarzenbek, center; Parks and
Butt, guards.
