# Dr. Jordan Speaks at San Francisco
## Blames War on the Dynastic System in Force in Germany 
### 
Speaking from the topic, "Why Does
the War Go On?" Dr. David Starr Jor
dan, Chancellor Emeritus of Stanford
University, outlined the philosophic
basis of German militarism in an ad
dress at Grace Cathedral, San Fran
cisco, yesterday afternoon.
"In the dynasty," said Dr. Jordan,
"is found the tap root of war. A
dynasty rests on three great props or
supportsâ€”force, intrigue, and super
stition. ... In the present day the
dynastic system exists in perfect de
velopment in Germany alone. .. .
Three philosophical conceptions are
held to justify the dynastic system of
today. These are the Supernal State
of Supreme Domination, 'Kultur,' or
'Supreme Discipline,' and 'Social Dar
winism,' the supreme call to action."
Dr. Jordan outlined these three con
ceptions at length. Speaking of "Kul
tur," ho said: "To take a single illus
tration, the work done in Belgium by
Herbert Hoovei* and bis associates,
American university men, the greatest
ever accomplished by men of one na
tion for the people of another, could
not have been conceived nor even un
derstood by men reared in the brass
bound system of 'Kultur.'
