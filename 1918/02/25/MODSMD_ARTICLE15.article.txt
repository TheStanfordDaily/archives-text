# THE ONE-YEAR DORMITORY RULE
## 
### 
Last spring tlic fraternities at Stanford entered into an agreement to
adopt a second-semester initiation rule if the University would postpone
the enforcement of the one-year dormitory rule until October, 1918.
In the fall, the second-semester initiation clause of the agreement was
overlooked entirely by the fraternities, many of which had given most of
last year's members to war service, it is doubtful if half a dozen of the
Greek-letter men even remembered the agreement, and nothing was said to
call it to their attention.
It seems a bit doubtful if some of the houses will reopen next fall,
as more fraternity men will go to war during the spring and summer.
If there were no restriction to prevent freshmen living where they wished
most of the houses would have a fighting chance and a fair proportion of
them would probably be able to keep their houses open.
If, on the other hand, the University should insist on the enforcement
of the one-year dormitory rule there is little doubt but that it would kill
fraternities at Stanford, at least for the duration of the war. This is not
the desire of the administration as President Wilbur stated shortly after he
took ofhcc.
It is quite true that the University must look after its property in
terests and that the dormitories are paying the biggest returns when the
maximum number of persons arc in them, which would only be possible if
the regulation requiring at least one-year residence in a dormitory were
enforced. Enforcement of the rule would necessitate the closing of the
houses on the Row and would make impossible continuation of payments to
the University of principal and interest on loans, where houses have been
built by the University, and of the regular rents. This, we believe, would
mean a greater loss of income to the University than it could make up for
in additional dormitory room rents. There would still be a fair income to
the University from both sources if the present status quo is maintained,
but with the one-year law rigidly putin force one of these sources would
be practically eliminated and the other not augmented sufficiently to make
up in any way for the injury which would result to the Gseek-letter organ
izations, individually and collectively.
Aside from material considerations, it must be remembered that the
fraternities at Stanford have made more than their share in answering Ihe
call to the colors. Their response has been truly noble. Any action by
the University putting insurmountable difficulties in their way and thereby
making their continued existence impossible, would place a premium on
unpatriotism. It would encourage men of a group who were really needed
for service to stay in the University when their places in the chapter house
should be taken by younger men, which would be impossbile should the
one-year rule go into effect now. It would seem to mean a failure on the
part of the University to appreciate the spirit already shown of unselfish
sacrifice of the membership which constitutes the very life-blood of the fra
ternity chapters.
The University, however, through its Board of Trustees and its Faculty,
docs appreciate this sacrifice, and we do not believe that the Board of Trus
tees, or the president, who have the power in this matter, will give their
approval to any act which will prove an injustice to the fraternities at
Stanford.
The one-year dormitory rule should not be enforced until after the
conclusion of the war.
