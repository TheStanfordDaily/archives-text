# ROMAN CONTRIBUTES TO MARCH SEQUOIA
## 
### 
A story without a title, a brand new
cover design, an article by Frank
Sloman, '20, just returned from
France, concerning his experiences
during his ambulance service at the
front, articles on the war situation by
Dr. Henry Lanz and Professor P. .T.
Treat of the History department, will
feature the March Stanford Sequoia.
It will appear early next month with
the biggest contents page of the year.
The titleless story will be illustrated
by cuts done by new-found campus
talent. The story without a title is
also without an author, and it. is ex
pected that a reward for the best title
will be offered by the editor of the
Sequoia in the near future.
