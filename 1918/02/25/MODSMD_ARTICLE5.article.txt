# ATHLETIC EVENTS ARE CALLED OFF
## 
### 
All athletic events scheduled for the
week-end were called off by order of
"Jupe Pluvius" and the officers of the
Berkeley Aviation School. A deluge
of rain all day Friday and Saturday
morning turned the varsity diamond
into a young Lagunita, which was con
sidered too wet to entertain the cham
pions from Camp Fremont. For a
similar reason the game with "Speed"
Martin's team was called off.
The swimming meet with the
Berkeley aviators was called off at
the last minute after the crowd had
begun to gather with the expectation
of seeing Norman Ross try for a
world's record. Refusal of the officers
at the aviation school to allow the
men the day off was given as the rea
son for not coming.
