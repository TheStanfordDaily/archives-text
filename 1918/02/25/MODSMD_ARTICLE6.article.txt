## 
### 
Success featured the military ball
held Thursday from the time the first
couple arrived until the last strains
of music announced the end of the
R. O. T. C. formal. One of the largest
crowds seen at any social function
this year filled the big gymnasium.
Many noted military men were
present as guests of the R. O. T. C.
and viewed with satisfaction the en
thusiastic spirit manifested by Stan
ford's military men. Approximately
two hundred couples attended the
ball.
A patriotic atmosphere was added
to the scene by the large number of
Flags used as decorations. The larg
est. American flag in the world covered
the entire ceiling of the gymnasium
and gave a softened and colored effect
to the lights. Flags of the Allies and
neutral countries covered the walls
and were hung in the corridors and
halls of the building..
