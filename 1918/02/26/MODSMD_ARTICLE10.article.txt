# Y.M. Campaign Begins in Encina
## Many Who Attend Meetings Show Keen Interest in Course 
### 
In spite of the absence of lights
which caused considerable confusion
in Encina Hall last night, the Y. M.
C. A. ( ampaign met with considerable
success. The attendance at the meet
ings held in different sections of the
hall was not so large as had been ex
pected, but those present showed a
keen interest in the work. About 95

per cent of those who attended the
meetings signed up to take the course
The campaign in Encina will be
continued and local leaders are urg
ing all men who could not he at the
meetings last night to get into touch
with the leader of their section of the
Hall as soon as possible. Capable
men, most of them leaders in Encina
activities, have been secured to lead
the discussion groups.
At a luncheon held in the Stanford
Inn today tlie Y. M. C. A. campaign
committee reported on the progress
of the work thus far and decided to
push it through to a finish without
further delay.
