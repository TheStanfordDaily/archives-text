# THE 						DECIDING GAME
## 
### 
Tomorrow evening Stanford and the University of California oppose
each other in Encina gym for the third and deciding game of intercollegiate
basketball. The winner tomorrow night takes the series. In both previous
games the score lias been close and it looks as if it might be even closer in
the last contest. If the Cardinal quintet is in good shape, and all prospects
point toward this, Stanford should decisively outplay the Blue and Cold five
tomorrow night, but our team needs the support of every man and woman
in the bleachers at the gymnasium. Those who saw the first "big game"
of the basketball series know what kind of an exhibition they can expect
and tomorrow's game should be even better.
This is the only final test of athletic supremacy between Stanford and
California this quarter. Every person registered in the University should
be present tomorrow night. Let's have an even better rooting section than
at the first game with California.
Everybody out!

Every one has had plenty of time to frame his smoke-ups by now, that
is, if he got any, and to realize that the beginning of the end approaches.
Just twenty-one calendar days separate the poor unsuspecting student from
another set of final examinations, — and here lie has hardly recovered from
that last bunch!
