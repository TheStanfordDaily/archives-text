ford auxiliary of the Red Cross last
evening to render emergency aid to
a couple of officers stationed at Camp
Fremont. The request was telephoned
in to a sorority representative of the
Red Cross. After the customary pre
lude of "Camp Fremont calling—Five
cents, please—Here's your party," a
deep military voice inquired if the
Stanford Red Cross would be willing
to undertake a little first-aid for two
officers who wished to escort a couple
of the "500" to one of Pally's movie
emporiums. Interesting personal de
scriptions and highest credentials
were presented to assist the project.
Disappointing as it is, the minutes of
the Red Cross fail to show whether
or not this co-operation was granted.
Here is an exceptional opportunity
for university extension work.
