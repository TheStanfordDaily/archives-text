# LANE CLINIC BENEFIT DANCE FRIDAY NIGHT
## PROCEEDS TO BE USED TO GIVE POOR CHILDREN COUNTRY LIFE IN SUMMER 
### 
Jazz music produced by combined
Stanford talent, long dances, and a
good floor are only a few of the many
attractions promised at the Lane
Clinic informal dance, to be given
next Friday evening in the Women's
Club House for the small sum of 25
cents admission and 5 cents a dance.
Proceeds from the dance will go
toward a fund being raised for an
"outing" house for convalescent
children for Stanford's free Lane
Clinic in San Francisco. Formerly
the University isolation hospital has
been used by the Clinic during the
summer vacation, but owing to the
four-quarter system now in effect, and
the University health ruling, this plan
can not be followed. The dance will
be a 1 o'clock affair.
As such a large number of poor and
sickly children have been materially
| benefited each summer by the stay
| provided for them by the clinic, it is
, very necessary that every effort be
! made to continue the system this
| summer. Many children look forward
I during the winter to the chance of
i this brief outing. The clinic workers
report that the waiting list is always
full and that some children await
their turn for months.
