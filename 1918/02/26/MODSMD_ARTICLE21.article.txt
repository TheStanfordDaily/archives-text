Editor Daily Palo x\lto:
Dear Sir: When I decided to take
a course in Military Training here at
Stanford it was for three reasons (1
admit, outside of getting my hours):
to he ready when my country needed
ine, to get physical exercise, and to
attain mental alertness and "system."
Now, when it doesn't rain, I can't com
plain as to the lirst and second points,
hut what I really do want to complain
of is the lack of system.
An editorial appeared in the Daily
a few days ago which had real bear
ing on the situation. It complained
that men of the corps were not being
dismissed each afternoon according to
schedule. That made me begin to
think (a true wonder, indeed). 1 said
to myself, "Why aren't we dismissed
on time?" 1 began to tabulate. I
noticed that when we assemble each
afternoon a good part of the time is
given over to such important!.?) items
as: there will be a swimming meet on
Saturday; if you want to have your
uniform starched, go ahead and do it;
the decorations for the ball will he
American flags, and commissioned of
ficers will really be allowed to wear
belts, but will be addressed as "mis
ter." Now, I signed up for this course
in order to get MILITARY TRAIN
ING, and 1 think I have a small right
to say something about what 1 am get
ting. The other afternoon it was
raining, and the major remarked about
the article in The Daily Palo Alto. He
declared that he thought every R. O.
T. C. man took the course because he
was interested in the work, and not
for the hours. Before he said this
over HALF AN HOUR had been
WASTED in getting the dates of each
man's birth, simply because orders
from headquarters were misunder
stood. The rost of the time was spent
in looking at a demonstration of sig
nals which could be learned from the
"Manual'' in ten minutes. What's the
answer?

attain mental alertness and "system."
Now, when it doesn't rain, I can't com
plain as to the lirst and second points,
hut what I really do want to complain
of is the lack of system.
An editorial appeared in the Daily
a few days ago which had real bear
ing on the situation. It complained
that men of the corps were not being
dismissed each afternoon according to
schedule. That made me begin to
think (a true wonder, indeed). 1 said
to myself, "Why aren't we dismissed
on time?" 1 began to tabulate. I
noticed that when we assemble each
afternoon a good part of the time is
given over to such important!.?) items
as: there will be a swimming meet on
Saturday; if you want to have your
uniform starched, go ahead and do it;
the decorations for the ball will he
American flags, and commissioned of
ficers will really be allowed to wear
belts, but will be addressed as "mis
ter." Now, I signed up for this course
in order to get MILITARY TRAIN
ING, and 1 think I have a small right
to say something about what 1 am get
ting. The other afternoon it was
raining, and the major remarked about
the article in The Daily Palo Alto. He
declared that he thought every R. O.
T. C. man took the course because he
was interested in the work, and not
for the hours. Before he said this
over HALF AN HOUR had been
WASTED in getting the dates of each
man's birth, simply because orders
from headquarters were misunder
stood. The rost of the time was spent
in looking at a demonstration of sig
nals which could be learned from the
"Manual'' in ten minutes. What's the
answer?
MILITARY.
