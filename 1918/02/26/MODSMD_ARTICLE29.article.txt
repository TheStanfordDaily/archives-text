# LAKE LAGUNITA TO BE FULL IN TIME FOR JUNIOR WEEK
## 
### 
Devotees of springtime sports are
rejoicing in the fact that water is at
last running into Lagunita from the
flume which carries it off the hills.
With one more good rain it is probable
that the lake will be full enough to
lend its accustomed zest to the usual
charms of Junior Week.
Although the recent rains have de
layed grading around the Wilbur
home, teams are again at the place
and the work is going on. Numerous
shrubs and trees are being set out
around the hill.
Some new oak trees have been
planted opposite the quad on the main
drive. When these are large enough
the other species of trees now there
are to be uprooted. This line of trees
will form the center of a double road,
the other half of which is to be graded
in front of the Thomas Welton Stan
ford Library.
The work on the new library is
going on very rapidly and according to
Farm Superintendent Hewston the
riveting of the steel structure will be
completed in three weeks.
