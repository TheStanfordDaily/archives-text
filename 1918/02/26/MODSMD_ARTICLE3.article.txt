# Quad War Pictures to Vie With Joshes
## 
### 
Editor S. E. Briggs of the 1919 Quad
has sent an urgent appeal to all men
on the campus to gather snapshots of
their former Stanford friends, broth
ers, and sisters in the service. The
object of the urgent appeal is to get
sufficient data for a complete section
of military snapshots.
Many of these pictures are already
on hand, having been brought back
or sent from France. To mobilize
all possible pictures is the plan of the
management, and hence the commun
ications sent all fraternity and living
groups. Announcement has likewise
been made that there is still room for
a laugh on the campus, in other words,
any "bawl-out" picture of friend or
enemy is desired to offset the warlike
tone of the book.
Anyone who possesses any pictures
of either nature is advised to commun
icate with â€¢ Briggs, via postoffice box
1357.
