# ZIMBALIST PLEASES COLLEGE AUDIENCE
## 
### 
Efrem Zimbalist lived up to his rep
utation as a great artist when he
played before a crowdcd audience last
Thursday evening in the Assembly
Hall.
With great simplicity, feeling, and
irreproachable technique, Zimbalist
proved himself master of the violin.
He played with a wonderful purity of
intonation, his notes having a peculiar
golden quality seldom heard from
other present day violinists. His
wonderful technique, shown in
Paganini's "Concerto," held the atten
tion and admiration of his listeners.
His very graceful rendering of
Beethoven's "Menuett" and Gossec's
"Gavotte" pleased all.
Haunting and lovely were the pieces
"Orientale" by Cui and "Serenade" by
d'Ambrosio, which stood forth in the
last numbers. In all his selections
Zimbalist upheld the highest ideals of
violin music. He was ably assisted
by Samuel Chotzinoff at the piano.
Theo Karle, the young American
tenor, will give the fourth and last
Peninsula Musical Association con
cert of this season, on Monday eve
ning, March 11, in the Assembly Hall.
The concert is being given on Mon
day instead of on Thursday, as usual,
because the association was not able
to secure Mr. Karle for any other
time.
