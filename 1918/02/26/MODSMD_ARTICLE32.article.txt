Stanford track hopes are wavering
back and fÂ«#Kh this year at the de

Captain A. F. Wilson's call was made
yesterday and on top of this comes
the statement that M. J. House, '19,
temporary coach, has been summoned
to appear before the draft, board of
liis district for re examination. House

cause of difficulty with his eyes, and
it was expected that he would be able
to complete the better part of the
winter and spring quarters before be
ing again summoned for examination.
If lie is called into the national army
immediately, his services will not be
