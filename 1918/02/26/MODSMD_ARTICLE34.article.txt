### 
Stunts and charades will constitute
the program of the next meeting of
Cercle Francais to be held at the
Women's Club House this Thursday
evening at 8 o'clock. Letters will
also be read from the French orphans
whom the club has been supporting
for the past year. It is hoped that
this work can be carried on for an
other year and all subscriptions for
this cause will be received by Mr.
Oberle of the French department.
