# GUILBERT CONCERT IS BIG ATTRACTION OF YEAR
## Famous Singer Scores Big Success in Recital for War Work By Eleanor Allen, '20. 
### 
Charming the audience with her ar
tistic interpretation, Yvette Guilbert
presented a delightful program of
French songs last night in the Assem
bly Hall. The talented artiste sur
passed even the highest expectations
in the delicate and whimsical under
standing with which she half-sang,
half-spoke her program.
Emily Gresser, violinist, did splen
did work in the several numbers which
she gave, but her pieces lacked variety
and expression. Maurice Eisner, who
accompanied both musicians on the
piano, deserves especial credit for his
sympathetic understanding of the work
of the two artistes.
Madame Guilbert gave her songs in
costumc, which added to the dramatic
vividness. Her first series was Three
Legends from the Fifteenth and Six
teenth centuries, which were taken
from the mystery and miracle plays
of that time. Le Voyage de Joseph
et Marie a Bethlehem (The Voyage of
Joseph and Mary to Bethlehem),
La Legende de St. Nicolas (The
Legend of St. Nicholas), and C'est le
Mai (It Is May), showed the art and
voice which Madame Guilbert has
combined in this unusual way.
Three songs of the Middle Ages,
during the Thirteenth and Fourteenth
centuries, included La Dame mal
mariee (The Bad Wife), Pourquoi me
Iml nion marie? (Why Does My Hus
band Beat lie?), and Le Portrait d'une
ParieieiiDe (The Portrait of a Par
isian Lady). The humorous explana
tion of Madame Guilbert of those
added greatly to the enjoyment.
The popular songs of the Seven
teenth century were humorous and
pleasing. La Mort du Marl (The Death
of the Husband), Le Lien Serre (The
Marriage Tie), and Le Cycle du Vin
(The Cycle of the Wine), were especi
ally well rendered. An English song,
"Oh, John Oh!" followed by the Mar
seillaise, completed the numbers given
by Madame Guilbert.
The Belgian Relief Committee,
which had charge of the concert, will
use the money for relief work in north
ern France. As yet no financial report
of the concert has been made.

Joseph and Mary to Bethlehem),
La Legende de St. Nicolas (The
Legend of St. Nicholas), and C'est le
Mai (It Is May), showed the art and
voice which Madame Guilbert has
combined in this unusual way.
Three songs of the Middle Ages,
during the Thirteenth and Fourteenth
centuries, included La Dame mal
mariee (The Bad Wife), Pourquoi me
Iml nion marie? (Why Does My Hus
band Beat lie?), and Le Portrait d'une
ParieieiiDe (The Portrait of a Par
isian Lady). The humorous explana
tion of Madame Guilbert of those
added greatly to the enjoyment.
The popular songs of the Seven
teenth century were humorous and
pleasing. La Mort du Marl (The Death
of the Husband), Le Lien Serre (The
Marriage Tie), and Le Cycle du Vin
(The Cycle of the Wine), were especi
ally well rendered. An English song,
"Oh, John Oh!" followed by the Mar
seillaise, completed the numbers given
by Madame Guilbert.
The Belgian Relief Committee,
which had charge of the concert, will
use the money for relief work in north
ern France. As yet no financial report
of the concert has been made.
