# VARSITY VS, S.C. TOMORROW
## Game Will Be Played on Mission Field 
### 
Stanford and Santa Clara will try
their hand with each other tomorrow
afternoon at Santa Clara in the sec
ond baseball game between the two
teams. Captain Lilly with his tossers
will leave the campus tomorrow noon.
Santa Clara (Mi Long End.
Santa Clara is on the long end of
the series between the two varsities,
but the Cardinal has a good chance
to even tilings up tomorrow. The Red
and White won the first game through
a rally in the ninth inning which net
ted five runs and Stanford should be
able to prevent such fireworks hap
pening again. If Santa Clara wins to
morrow's game they will have sewed
up the series.
Lifur and l?erg will be the oppos
ing pitchers in tomorrow's game, with
a possibility that either Fowler or
Harvey will be sent in to help things

' along. From indications in the first
J game the two varsities are both big
run getters and there is very little
I
likelihood of a pitchers' battle when
I the two nines hook up.
Varsity in Good Shape.
| Stanford has not been given a chance
i in a game for over a week, due to bad
[ weather, but Captain Lilly has been
making up for lost time with the good
weather and the team's playing should
not be affected by the lay-off.
Stanford will line up as follows:
Campbell, catcher; Davis, first; Doe,
second; Galloway, short; Dickey,
third; Wayland, left; Lilly, center;
Knox, right; while the Santa Clara
bat swingers will trot out as follows:
Garcia, catcher; Desmond, first;
Fitzpatrick, second; Williams, short;
Scholz, third; Manelll, left; Grace,
center; and lloefling, right.
