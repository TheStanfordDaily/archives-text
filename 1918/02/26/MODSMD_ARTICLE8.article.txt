# COURT TITLE AT STAKE TOMORROW
## CALIFORNIA-STANFORD SERIES TO BE DECIDED 
### 
Stanford will have before her the opportunity of winning tlie first bas
ketball series from California that has ever gone to the Cardinal if she
can turn the tables on the Bruins tomorrow night in Encina gymnasium
when the fives from the two universities battle. Stanford has never been
successful even in a game of basketball against California until this year,
and having won one game, the Cardinal is out for the title.
Is Deciding Game of Series.
Tomorrow's fracas is the deciding game of a three-game series. Stan
ford took the first, 22 to 18, and California won the second, 27 to 23. Who
will win the third and deciding game is still a mystery, although what dope
there is points to Stanford.
In order to give the Cardinal all the support possible, Manager Sulli
van has arranged to have a band out to help make noise with the rooters
and yell-leaders. G. H. Luhrs, '18, and his assistants will lend all the aid
they can with a large tournout of fans to back them.

Admission Fifty Cents.
The game is scheduled to start at 8
o'clock, with admission 50 cents for
all students, whether they hold stu
dent body tickets or not, since this is
an Intercollegiate contest.
The dope for the game seems to
point to Stanford, although the pointer
is not too strong. California won the
second game, but it was due to bad
shooting on the part of two Stanford
men, shooting which will not occur
again. Moulton has been good for
two-thirds of his foul shots every game
in the last two years, with the excep
tion of the fracas at California last
Wednesday. Had his eye been in
shape, Stanford would have won. In
practice he lias regained his ability
to drop them in most of the time and
the Cardinal need not fear on that
score.
The other big weakness on the part
of Stanford was team play by the for
wards. Coach Wilson has made this
feature his special object of attack the
last week and Bucklin and Moulton
are showing real class. In case Hood
is able to go in, he will fit without
difficulty.
In addition to the championship be
tween Stanford and California second
place in the California-Nevada League
is at stake when the varsities line up
tomorrow. St. Mary's has a clear lead
for the top position, but if Stanford
can defeat, the Bruins second place
will come to this side of the bay.
