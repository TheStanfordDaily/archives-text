# SCHEDULE OF TRACK MEETS FOR SEASON IS ANNOUNCED
## FREMONT DATE INCLUDED Cardinal to Contest With the Olympic Clubâ€”Southern Trip Possible 
### 
A full schedule of track meets for
the spring season is being prepared
by Graduate Manager Sullivan. As
announced today the schedule includes
a meet with the Camp Fremont track
sters and possibly a trip to Southern
California. A meet with the Olympic
Club is also assured, although a defi
nite date has not yet been decided.
Will Meet Fremont.
March 16 is the day set when the
Cardinal speedsters will oppose the
Fremont men. The Fremont team will
be selected from those who show up
in the interdivisional army meet
which was held on tlie Stanford oval 1
today. A number of former college
stars are now located at the army post
and promise to furnish keen competi
tion for the varsity material.
A definite date for the meet with
the Wingod "O" team has not been
set, but March 9 is being tentatively j
considered.
A large silver trophy has been do- .
nated by Ralston Wilbur, ex-'99, and
will be awarded to the winner of the
meet.
Southern Trip Uncertain.
Uncertainty still exists in regard to
meeting the University of Southern I
California. That institution is not yet |
able to guarantee the trip. Manager j
Sullivan, however, is still negotiating I
for the meet. Other forms of competi-|
tion will be arranged to get the Card-;
inal men in shape for the big meet!
against California on April 13.
It is as yet impossible to get a line i
on the strength of the team which!
Stanford will have to oppose the Blue
and Gold. Wimberly has been sum- j
nioned before the draft board and may
be called into service. M. J. House,
veteran sprinter and hurdler, is un
decided whether he will remain in col
lege or not. If he decides to enlist
in the Engineering Corps, he will
leave at once.
Quadrangle Club has announced
that the Irish Marathon will be held
during Junior Week. Class captains
have been appointed and are urging
the men to get into condition for that
event. Some kind of competition,
probably another informal meet over
full distance, will be furnished Sat
urday afternoon. The interclass meet
is scheduled to come off soon.

sters and possibly a trip to Southern
California. A meet with the Olympic
Club is also assured, although a defi
nite date has not yet been decided.
Will Meet Fremont.
March 16 is the day set when the
Cardinal speedsters will oppose the
Fremont men. The Fremont team will
be selected from those who show up
in the interdivisional army meet
which was held on tlie Stanford oval 1
today. A number of former college
stars are now located at the army post
and promise to furnish keen competi
tion for the varsity material.
A definite date for the meet with
the Wingod "O" team has not been
set, but March 9 is being tentatively j
considered.
A large silver trophy has been do- .
nated by Ralston Wilbur, ex-'99, and
will be awarded to the winner of the
meet.
Southern Trip Uncertain.
Uncertainty still exists in regard to
meeting the University of Southern I
California. That institution is not yet |
able to guarantee the trip. Manager j
Sullivan, however, is still negotiating I
for the meet. Other forms of competi-|
tion will be arranged to get the Card-;
inal men in shape for the big meet!
against California on April 13.
It is as yet impossible to get a line i
on the strength of the team which!
Stanford will have to oppose the Blue
and Gold. Wimberly has been sum- j
nioned before the draft board and may
be called into service. M. J. House,
veteran sprinter and hurdler, is un
decided whether he will remain in col
lege or not. If he decides to enlist
in the Engineering Corps, he will
leave at once.
Quadrangle Club has announced
that the Irish Marathon will be held
during Junior Week. Class captains
have been appointed and are urging
the men to get into condition for that
event. Some kind of competition,
probably another informal meet over
full distance, will be furnished Sat
urday afternoon. The interclass meet
is scheduled to come off soon.
