# POET RECITES FROM HIS OWN WORKS AT TUESDAY MEETING
## 
### 
Breathing the free spirit of the wide
sweeps and great open places of his
native prairies, John G. Neihardt last
night entertained a Stanford audience
with readings from his own poetical
works. Introduced by Dr. Jordan as
"a young man who is writing the epic
of the Missouri River country," he
more than lived up to the description
if what lie recited last night may be
taken as a fair sample of his work.
Imaginative, (. iithusiastie, atmospheric,
impatient of material restraint, his
poetry was a plea for the vision to see
the beautiful in the everyday things
around us, and a song of pulsating
joyousness at the glories of nature.
The reading was in three parts, and
was given in a pleasing voiec and ex
pression which added materially to the
effect of the lyrics. The first part was
a series of verses from "The Stranger
at the Gate." "The Poet's Town" rep
resents a prosaic prairie village as
seen through the eyes of a dreaming
poet. "Tiie Poet's Advice" may be
summed up in the words of the poet
