# POET RECITES FROM HIS OWN WORKS AT TUESDAY MEETING
## 
### 
Breathing the free spirit of the wide
sweeps and great open places of his
native prairies, John G. Neihardt last
night entertained a Stanford audience
with readings from his own poetical
works. Introduced by Dr. Jordan as
"a young man who is writing the epic
of the Missouri River country," he
more than lived up to the description
if what lie recited last night may be
taken as a fair sample of his work.
Imaginative, (. iithusiastie, atmospheric,
impatient of material restraint, his
poetry was a plea for the vision to see
the beautiful in the everyday things
around us, and a song of pulsating
joyousness at the glories of nature.
The reading was in three parts, and
was given in a pleasing voiec and ex
pression which added materially to the
effect of the lyrics. The first part was
a series of verses from "The Stranger
at the Gate." "The Poet's Town" rep
resents a prosaic prairie village as
seen through the eyes of a dreaming
poet. "Tiie Poet's Advice" may be
summed up in the words of the poet
himself, "Though the world does not
love its dreamers over-much, one must
be a poet if one can." The other
lyrics were, "The Weavers," "Ballad
of the Poet's Child," "A Hymn Before
Birth," "The Child's Heritage," and
i "Lullaby."
"Eight Hundred Rubles," a one-act
drama written in verse, was the second
! part of the program. The scene is in
. Russia, where an old peasant woman
unknowingly murders her son, whom
she thought to be dead, in order to
obtain the money he carries with him.
The powerful plot is well carried out,
I though somewhat lacking in realism,
as the poet's style is perhaps not so
well adapted to this type of work.
The third part of the reading was
another series of lyrics,—"The Battle
Cry," "A Prayer for Pain," "When 1
Have Passed Weird Ways," and "En
voy." In them the poet passionately
calls for courage in the things of life,
and glories in the strength of his un
quenchable spirit.
Mr. Neihardt's poetry never comes
down to earth. It is not meant to.
He sees the poetic in the humdrum
things about him, and tells what he
sees in language which expresses the
depth of the impression he feels. It
points to no morals and solveß no
problems, but unfolds the hidden beau
ties of nature and nature's world.
Mr. Neihardt will speak again be
fore the English Club tonight at the
residence of Professor Alden in Palo
Alto.

poetry was a plea for the vision to see
the beautiful in the everyday things
around us, and a song of pulsating
joyousness at the glories of nature.
The reading was in three parts, and
was given in a pleasing voiec and ex
pression which added materially to the
effect of the lyrics. The first part was
a series of verses from "The Stranger
at the Gate." "The Poet's Town" rep
resents a prosaic prairie village as
seen through the eyes of a dreaming
poet. "Tiie Poet's Advice" may be
summed up in the words of the poet
himself, "Though the world does not
love its dreamers over-much, one must
be a poet if one can." The other
lyrics were, "The Weavers," "Ballad
of the Poet's Child," "A Hymn Before
Birth," "The Child's Heritage," and
i "Lullaby."
"Eight Hundred Rubles," a one-act
drama written in verse, was the second
! part of the program. The scene is in
. Russia, where an old peasant woman
unknowingly murders her son, whom
she thought to be dead, in order to
obtain the money he carries with him.
The powerful plot is well carried out,
I though somewhat lacking in realism,
as the poet's style is perhaps not so
well adapted to this type of work.
The third part of the reading was
another series of lyrics,—"The Battle
Cry," "A Prayer for Pain," "When 1
Have Passed Weird Ways," and "En
voy." In them the poet passionately
calls for courage in the things of life,
and glories in the strength of his un
quenchable spirit.
Mr. Neihardt's poetry never comes
down to earth. It is not meant to.
He sees the poetic in the humdrum
things about him, and tells what he
sees in language which expresses the
depth of the impression he feels. It
points to no morals and solveß no
problems, but unfolds the hidden beau
ties of nature and nature's world.
Mr. Neihardt will speak again be
fore the English Club tonight at the
residence of Professor Alden in Palo
Alto.
Breathing the free spirit of the wide
sweeps and great open places of his
native prairies, John G. Neihardt last
night entertained a Stanford audience
with readings from his own poetical
works. Introduced by Dr. Jordan as
"a young man who is writing the epic
of the Missouri River country," he
more than lived up to the description
if what lie recited last night may be
taken as a fair sample of his work.
Imaginative, (. iithusiastie, atmospheric,
impatient of material restraint, his
poetry was a plea for the vision to see
the beautiful in the everyday things
around us, and a song of pulsating
joyousness at the glories of nature.
