many of the courses have been ar

The first will end July 24 and the

Pacific Grove will be opened for the
first time with the summer quarter.
All courses in Zoology and Physiology
will be given there during this quar
ter, instead of on the campus at Palo

will be in charge. The marine station
will be open all the year for research
work, with regular courses given
there in the spring and summer quar
ters after this year.
Courses for Teachers.
As this is the first summer quarter
for Stanford under the all-year-round
plan that went into effect in October,
just what class of students will reg
ister for the summer me University
officials do not know. They are mak
ing preparations, however, for teach
ers who may wish to study during
their summer vacation and will offer
a large number of courses for them.
Especially will this be the case with
the School of Education. Inquiries
have been coming from school prin
cipals, and it is expected that with the
offering of courses attractive to high
school teachers the enrollment of
thom will be large.
At the same time subjects of interest
to the usual class of students have
been included in the program.
Details of the courses will be con
tained in a special bulletin which will
be issued about April 1. It will give
