Oilier meets are hoped for before

with the San Francisco Y. M. C. A.

not yet assured.
More men are needed for the 135
pound class and the 175 weights. In
these classes there is great oppor
tunity for new men to show up well.
For the weights of 158, 145, 115, and'
I OS there are good candidates, from
i which men will he picked to represent
I Stanford on the team sent to Berkeley
in April.
Wrestling at Stanford has lately be
come a sport of much interest, and a
good crowd is expe< ted to journey with
.the team this year :o California. The
meet will bo a closely contested one,
as last year California won by a slight
margin. This year the odds seem to
be fairly even, with Stanford's chances
a little in the balance.
