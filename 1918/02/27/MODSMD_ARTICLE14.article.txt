# TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT
## 
### 
Tonight's Big Game with California is scheduled to start at 8 o'clock.
Provisions have been made to handle the biggest crowd that has ever wit
nessed a basketball game at Stanford. All that remains now is for every
man and every woman to go and to get behind the team and stay there
clear through the game.
The best team is going to win tonight, and it's going to be a Stanford
team!
