# WOMEN'S GARDENING
## 
### 
In spite of much talking, there sems to be little enthusiasm on the part
of most women of the University for this "patriotic garden" proposition.
Women of eastern colleges are taking up food production in an energetic
way. At Wellesley. where most is being done along these lines, a full
iledged ranch is being conducted, but regular time is being allotted to it,
and for most of the women involved in the undertaking it is the main thing
right now.
Under the quarter system academic work is on an intensified basis all
the time, and few Stanford women have much spare time. There would
be grave difficulties here in the way of regularity of work time by each
woman who signed up in this branch of war work. We believe any or
ganized attempt at food production on the part of the Stanford women will
be confronted with too many obstacles under the present system to war
rant its being undertaken, at least until some regular provision is made for
it in the university calendar or curriculum. Unless some special time is
allotted by the University authorities for this endeavor, we do not deem it
advisable for the women to attempt it except as individuals till summer
time comes.
During the summer a good number of the women could remain on the
campus or could come back early and take up canning of fruit or some
other needed branch of the process of food production, and give it their en
tire time and attention without anything to prevent the success of the work
by taking away the time of the workers.
Until then food production can b3 carried on by many of the women
Individually if they feel inclined. There are many other branches of war
work which are just as much in need of workers as the food-raising proj
ect. Stanford women will not lack for tasks until such time as a united
gardening scheme becomes practicable. Word comes from Red Cross head
quarters that the number of workers is below what it should be these
days. There are a dozen other forms of war work which must be attend
ed to now that do not present the difficulties the planting scheme does —
difficulties which make success seem doubtful, at least until the end of the
academic year.
