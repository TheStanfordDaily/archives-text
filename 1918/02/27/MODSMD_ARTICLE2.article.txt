# 1921 Nine Downs Palo Alto High
## Freshmen Show Better Form Than in Previous Contests 
### 
Stanford freshmen showed good
form yesterday when they downed the
Palo Alto High School nine by a 3 to
2 count, in a six inning scrimmage.
The visitors scored their two runs off
errors in the first part of the game.
On the whole, the playing of the
1921 nine was considerably improved
and tliey put up a real exhibition of
baseball during the latter part of the
contest when the first team was sent
onto the fl"!d The high school lads
put iip .ter scrap than when they
fell befon the "babes" a few weeks
ago by a 6-0 score.
Parker and Reinhold tossed the pill
for the freshmen while Filley and
Criss took turns behind the bat. Palo
Alto bagged hits when they twice
clouted the ball between the 1921
fielders. The Cardinal team secured
four hits off the high school slabsters.
The only long hit of the game oc
curred when Reinhold smashed the
ball for a two-bagger. He is a new
man on the freshman pitching staff
and promises to show something worth
while. If the present good work con
tinues the first-year men have an ex
cellent chance of scoring a defeat
over the Blue and Gold "babes" on
April 4,
