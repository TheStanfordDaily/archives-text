# ENCINA WILL HAVE LARGE SERVICE FLAG
## 
### 
A service flag with 300 stars, rep
resenting the number of Encina men
who have gone into service since the
beginning of the war, will be hung in
the Encina club room at the second
Encina dance, Saturday night.
After the ball the flag will be hung
on one of the two new flag poles which
are to be erected in front of the Hall.
A large American flag will be hung on
the other.
The flag measures 15x20 feet and the
stars are so arranged that 100 more
can be added as more men go into
service.
