# STANFORD R.0.T.C. MORNING COMPANIES INSPECTED TODAY
## 
### 
Military companies of the second
battalion had their second inspection
and company tests of the quarter this
morning. Results of the inspection
will not be announced until after the
tests of the first battalion.
In general appearance and drilling
the companies showed considerable
improvement over that made in the
last inspection.
Major Allen, commanding the morn
ing battalion, spoke briefly to the men
and emphasized the necessity of keep
ing guns and equipment in good con
dition, as the government inspector
may drop in at any time. It is also
likely that an officer from Camp Fre
mont may be detailed to inspect the
guns in the racks.
"The government," he said, "is be
coming more and more particular
about the condition of the solder's
equipment."
Captain Short of Camp Fremont
drilled two of the afternoon companies
yesterday. He laid special stress on
the giving of commands and alertness.
