# HOUSES WARNED AGAINST PORCH PILLOW THIEVES
## 
### 
The season for pillow thieves opened
a few evenings ago. Since then the
porches of several sorority houses
have suffered depletion from system
atic raids and campus residents are
advised to put porch cushions under
lock and key until the men finish furn
ishing their rooms and houses at the
expense of their neighbors' property.
Quite unprofessionally, the marauders
do not choose the dark of the moon
for their operations but prowl about
in the moonlight, which shows up
"cords," mackinaws, and plaid caps
to the best advantage.

A happy incident occurred on one
of these raids the other evening,
which no doubt was a pleasant sur
prise to the thieves. A wakeful in
mate of a sorority house watched their
progress up the alley and when they
returned, awaited them. Like manna
from heaven, a sweet little pink and
blue boudoir pillow dropped lightly
from the sleeping porch into their
midst. Naturally the thieves were at
first somewhat disconcerted but then
eagerly added the little thing to their
plunder and slunk sheepishly off.
No doubt the women are glad of
this opportunityto help brighten the
dreary environments of the men, but it
is rumored that the victims of the raids
are planning retaliatory expeditions
to recover their cretonne creations.
