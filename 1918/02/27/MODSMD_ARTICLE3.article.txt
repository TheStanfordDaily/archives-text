# VARSITY READY FOR COURT BATTLE
## Cardinal Players Are in Best Form of Season 
### 
Stanford's hopes for a victory in
basketball over California took an
other jump last night when Coach Wil
son announced that Bill Hood was in
condition to start at forward as a
team-mate to Moulton. The former
freshman captain has been out of both
other games with a badly sprained
! shoulder but the doctors have pro
nounced themselves as satisfied that
he could not injure himself again. As
a result the coach will use him.
i Will Add to Team.
Hood's presence in the lineup
should add a large measure to the
team play of the Varsity and some
eight or ten points to the score. With
Moulton back in form and Schwarzen
bek playing his usual game, the of- |
fensive play of the Varsity should be |
50 per cent improved over that of the !
last game, while the guarding feature |
will be as good as usual with Parks j
and Butt. These two men are al

ways good. They never have their
off-days, and the fans can look to them
for a big measure of basketball to
night.
Moultoii Has Found Eye.
Eve Moulton has found his eye for
foul shooting again after his trouble
last Wednesday and should be able
to drop in 75 per cent of his tries.
In the practices Monday and last
night he showed that he could put
them in with regularity. There should
be no trouble on this score tonight.
The players will have the same ref
eree for the game tonight as handled
the whistle in the other two games
in Boek. Although not so strict as
other men, Boek keeps the game
speeded up at all times.
In Last Workout.
Coach Wilson put his men through
a light basket-shooting practice last
night, and after watching the play
pronounced himself as satisfied with

the showing of the Stanford hopefuls.
There are no serious injuries except
in the case of Williamson, who is
completely out of it with a broken
thumb, and the men played with more
snap than in any other practice of
the season.
Christie Confident.
California will leave Berkeley early
Wednesday and will take a work-out
on the Encina floor before the game
starts. Coach Christie believes that
the game will tell the story in favor
of the Blue and Gold, and expects to
use the superior weight of his men to
good advantage tonight.
The play is scheduled to start
promptly at 8 o'clock, and admission
will be 50 cents both to students with
A. S. S. U. cards and non-student body
members. Soldiers will be admitted
at the door for 25 cents. Preparations '
are being made for the largest crowd
that has witnessed a basketball game
at the University.
