# CLINIC BENEFIT DANCE TO BE ONE OF SEASON'S BEST
## 
### 
The Lane ClHnirs Vionoflt rlonoo Tfri
day night at the Women's Club House
promises in every way to become one
of the most enjoyable pay dances of
this quarter. The committee, which is
composed of Miss Josephine Welch,
'19, Miss Estelle Nisson, '19, and F. A.
Watts, '20, is trying to add all the fea
tures it can to make the charitable
persons present glad they came. The
latest thing the committee promises
is two glasses of punch with each
dance ticket. The dance will be a
one-o'clock affair, and the admission
will be 25 cents with a charge of 5
cents for each dance. There will be
twenty dances.
The proceeds are to go to the Lane
Clinics to finance another convales
cent home for poor San Francisco chil
dren. The home will be in the vicin
ity of Palo Alto. The Stanford Auxil
iary has helped raise funds for this
homo for several years. Due to this
help many poor and sickly children
have been given an opportunity to re
gain their health that they would not
have had in the city.
