# CRITICIZING R. O. T. C. METHODS
## 
### 
A communication appeared in The Daily Palo Alto on Tuesday criticiz
ing certain features of the management of the military drill and alleging
a lack of system. While this criticism was for the most part purely de
structive, there were a few constructive features to it. It can hardly be
construed that the contributor intended to "down" military training; if
anything his purpose was to urge to more real training.
While there are a few things—such as the failure to dismiss the
men on time —which are not as they should be in the conduct of military,
there may be danger of articles such as the communication in question
causing serious dissension in the ranks, unless the men of the R. O. T. C.
realize that they are just as responsible as their officers in making the
corps a success.
Officers who are now in active charge of the drill have been chosen
from among the men and they are trying hard to maintain the military
work at Stanford on the best possible footing. From major to the lowest
non-commissioned officer every one of them is apt to make mistakes, but
the motives of but few can be questioned. Repeatedly the officers in charge
have expressed a desire to talk over R. O. T. C. conditions with the men
and have shown a willingness to adopt suggestions. Perhaps the best
way to make these suggestions would be through personal interview, but
no matter how they are made, even if in the form of communications to
The Daily Palo Alto, they should be taken at their face value, and if the
criticisms made are justified, steps should be taken at once to make im
provements wherever they are needed.
Stanford has made a name for itself along the lines of military train
ing and ranks high in this department among the educational institutions
of the nation. If the men of Stanford wish this University to maintain
its place on the distinguished list of the ten best universities in military
training, and wish to obtain the appointments to second lieutenancies which
are available to Stanford seniors each year if we remain in this class, every
officer and private in the R. 0. T. C. must put the best they have into the
military training.
If officers and men all do their best there can be no spirit of dissen
sion in the ranks and success will be continuous for the Stanford corps.
But this success will never come in full until both leaders and those led
recognize the imperative necessity for mutual cooperation. This accom
plished, minor faults of administration will he brushed aside and the corps
can go after real results, unhampered.
It is up to both officers and men to get behind the R. O. T. C. and
make the corps what it should be.
