# VARSITY NINE WINS FROM 67TH INFANTRY
## Contest Is Substituted for Santa Clara Game—Play Is Interesting 
### 
In an uninteresting game, Stanford
defeated the 62nd Infantry baseball
men from Camp Fremont yesterday j
on the local lot sto 3. The game was i
substituted for the Santa Clara eon-!
test which was to be played at Santa
Clara, when the Mission graduate man
ager called the play off temporarily.!
I The exhibition yesterday was featured
j by numerous errors on both sides, al
though the varsity came back after
it had taken its fling and put up a
good brand of ball. As usual Camp
bell came through with two safeties,
and counted largely in the Cardinal
score.
The Fremont team put the first j
counter across in the first frame, j
when Johnson was walked, stole sec- i
ond, was sacrificed to third by Bink, I
and came home on Galloway's error.
Stanford men took three strikeouts
in their half of the first, but got under
way in the second inning. Campbell
got his first hit, went to second on a
passed ball to third on an error, then
came home on a pretty sacrifice by
Doe.
In the third the visitors grabbed an
other counter. Johnson hit one to
Dickey, who muffed it, then Bink
rolled one down to Galloway who fol
lowed Dickey's example. Ryan next
was given a hit when Briggs pulled j
the Alplionse-Gaston stuff and left the
bases full. Captain Lilly then sent j
Lifur to the rescue, but on a peg to j
second Galloway dropped the ball and
Johnson came in. After this run Lifur
put the batters out in short order to
end the inning.
In the fourth Stanford took a tally.
Wayland was hit, but Galloway hit to
short and was given a life at first
when Wayland was thrown out. Doe
made his second sacrifice hit, how
ever, and put Galloway on second. !
He went to third on an error and
came home on a hit by Davis.
In the fifth the visitors snared their
last run. Bink tripled to right and
came home on a single by Ryan. Then
Stanford came to bat in this inning J
and put the game on ice. Howes drew I
a walk, went to second on a wild
pitch, to third on an error and came
home when Lilly singled. Another
safety by Campbell put the Captain
on third when Fvelson let the ball
roll through his legs in center. An
other error let Campbell in for the
last run.
