# STANFORD FIVE LOSES TO U.C.
## California Men Win Game and Series 
### H.G. Swendsen, '20 
California took the 1918 basketball
series from Stanford last night by
winning the third and deciding game
by the score of 2G to 17. The Blue and
Gold team put up a style of game that
the Cardinals could not handle in the
second half of the contest and this
fact, combined with the poor shooting
of Stanford, lost the game. For Cali
fornia, Captain Salmina was the big
factor In the win. He shot fouls with
consistency, made four field goals, and
was in every play. For Stanford, Butt
and Hood played a strong game.
First Half Close.
Although the first half ended in
favor of California, Stanford made one
more field goal than the Blue and
Gold, and gave every indication of
putting up a winning fight. Hood and
Moulton were playing with team-work
that left the California guards help
less, while both Stanford forwards
were shooting from every angle of the
fioor. Hut with the opening of the
second period something went wrong
and the result was the Cardinal did
not make a field goal although they
had several good chances.
California Scores First-
Stanford fouled in the first minute
of play, and California drew first blood
when Salmina converted. This
seemed to put heart into the Blue and
Gold men and they started a spurt
which netted them six ponits before
the Stanford men were under way.
Then Moulton and Butt each threw a
field basket and the two teams were
bunched again. Stanford fouled so
consistently, however, that Salaniina
was able to give his team a safe lead

again by converting four fouls in suc
cession.
With the half nearly over and Cali
fornia ahead by eight points, I-lood,
who had been fighting hard all
| through, found his chance and drop
-1 ped in two baskets from the middle of
| the fioor, followed by another goal by
j Moulton. This, combined with an
j other foul shot, gave Stanford twelve
points. Salamina converted another
; foul, and Anderson shot another bas
: ket, however, to put the Blue and
I Gold ahead when the wistle blew.
| Coach Christie evidently gave his
| men several pointers between halves,
I for they came back and grabbed the
game without difiiculty when the new
period started. Moulton and Schwar
zenbek were lost during this half and
could not get. even near the basket
with their shots, although they had
several good opportunities. Hood had
slowed up also, and did not get a
chance at the basket. For California,
Salamina made three goals, Anderson
one, and Cuffe, one. Since Moulton
had been shooting fouls in poor style
the first half Hood was given a chance
the second period, and gave Stanford
her only points when he made five of
his foul shots good.
There were no substitutes on either
team.
