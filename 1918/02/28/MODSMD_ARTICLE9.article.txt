# CROWD APPLAUDS SOLDIERS IN BIG REGIMENTAL MEET
## SANITARY TRAIN WINNER Fremont Men Display Much Class and Enthusiasm; Times Are Fair 
### 
Creating more enthusiasm and
drawing a larger crowd than any
event held on the Stanford oval since
the meet with California two years
ago, the Fremont Divisional track
meet was held yesterday afternoon,
with the Sanitary Train emerging on
the victorious end of the tally sheet.
Fully five thousand spectators,
mostly men in uniform, attended the
meet, and saw the athletes from the
Sanitary Train nose out their rivals
from the 319 th Engineers by the close
score of 24 to 23. The Bth Infantry
was third with 19 points, the 13th In
fantry next with 10 points, and Base
11 ospi tal 47 with 9, 32th Infantry with
7, and 24th Machine Gun Battalion
with 3, following the order named.
Some Fast Times.
Considering that the men have little
opportunity to indulge in track work
some excellent times were made,
Webster's :10 1-5 in the 100 yards
being especially good. John Muldoon,
formerly of Santa Clara, now of the
319 th Engineers, won the SSO in 2:12.
The Bth Infantry won the Officers'
Relay, the four men covering the four
laps of 110 yards each in :4S 2-5, al

over a two-mile course, eight men
running 220 yards each, was won by
the Sanitary Train, with a time of
3:21 4-5.
The 120 yard low hurdles was won
by Furst of Base Hospital 47, and the
shot-put by Couch of the Engineers
with a put of 38 feet G inches. Couch
is a former pitcher for the Detroit
Americans and San Francisco Seals.
The Stli Infantry won the tug of war
competition with a strong bunch of
heavies.
"Ric" Templeton ran in the 100
yards and started the relay for the En
gineers, but was bothered by a rheu
matic leg. Monlux, former shot
putter for California, couldn't get bet
ter than fourth out of his favorite
