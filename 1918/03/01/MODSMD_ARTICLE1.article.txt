# R.O.T.C. COMPANIES TO COMPETE IN MEET ON SATURDAY
## FEATURE EVENTS ARE TO BE SCHEDULED Full Distances To Be Run by Menâ€”Entire Squad To Be On Hand 
### 
Inspired by the success of the Pre- j
mont regimental meet last Wednes- (
day, track authorities have decided to
stage an inter-company R. O. T. C.
track meet Saturday afternoon, start
ing at 1:30. Competition is to he held
between the various companies of the
two battalions and in addition the rest j
of the track squad, not enrolled in the
military training courses, will be or
ganized into some sort of a unit to
compete with the others. In this way |
the entire squad will have strong com- i
petition.
Full Distance To Be Run.
Full distances are to be run in the,
regular track events for the first time
this year. In addition special relays
are to be arranged for between the va
rious companies, as well as some other
special events, such as a possible car
rying race or some other form of com
petition inspired by the Fremont track;
meet. The special events are to be
held primarily to bring men into com
petition other than regular track men.
Captain Wilson has issued a special ,
statement to the effect that all of the i
track squad must be on hand for the
meet, and company commanders of the
1 R. O. T. C. are to issue calls to their
j men today to uphold the honor of
| their respective companies.
! Company Rivalry Expected.
It is hoped that the company rivalry
will result in the development of new
track candidates. Men are especially
needed in the field events, and the
possibility exists that several of the
student gun-bearers will develop into
varsity prospects.
An excellent line on the abil
i ity of the fresnmen ought to be
forthcoming from the meet, as this
will be their first competition since
they have gone into hard training. All
freshmen who do not show up for the
meet tomorrow, unless they have suf
ficient excuse, will find their prospects
severely handicapped, according to
definite announcement. With but four
weeks remaining before the Stanford-
California freshman meet, the Cardi
nal babes can expect some stern work
in every Saturday competition.
