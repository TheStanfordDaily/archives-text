# CLINIC BENEFIT TO HOLD SWAY TONIGHT
## 
### 
With the knowledge that every
dance stepped off will bring some poor
San Francisco orphan nearer to a de
lightful and healthful summer outing,
Stanford's followers of the Terpsi
chorean art are assured of an enjoy
able evening at the Lane Clinic bene
fit dance which is scheduled for to
night in the Women's Club House.
Twenty-five cents admission will be
charged and the dances will be nickel
crawls. Two glasses of punch will be
included with each dance ticket, to in
sure complete satisfaction of thirst.
There will be twenty dances, and the
affair will hold forth until one o'clock.
The best music that can be obtained
will take care of that essential part of
a dance, and the committee in charge,
namely, Miss Josephine Welch, '19,
Miss Estelle Nisson, '19, and F. A.
Watts, '20, are planning a number of
features to make this "scud" a thor
oughly enjoyable affair. The benefit
is being given under the auspices of
the Stanford Auxiliary, and the pro
ceeds will go to the financing of a
convalescent home near Palo Alto for
poor San Francisco children. In for
mer years the Isolation Hospital has
been used for this purpose, but the
summer quarter this year makes this
impossible.
