# SPRING IS HERE!
## 
### 
Today marks the first day of spring, according to the calendar, and
the spring feeling is certainly in the air. Few of us are sufficiently habit
uated to the none too gentle art of "grinding" to fail to be affected by the
old perennial desire to cut all classes and hike for the hills. Those who
ought to know tell us that there is a miniature lake where Lagunita used
to be.
Stanford is blessed with a wonderful springtime setting of color. Coast
range mountains of the deepest blue shade into misty purple in the late
afternoon, while the foothills are green from recent rains. Even the Ar
boretum seems fresh and new. We realize that this is a pretty fine place to
be and that life isn't so bad, after all.
Until the newness of it wears off, or until some belated winter weather
happens along, it is going to be mighty hard work keeping the concentra
tion stunt going and pegging away in classrooms, library, or "lab." But
why allow such insignificant matters to worry one?
