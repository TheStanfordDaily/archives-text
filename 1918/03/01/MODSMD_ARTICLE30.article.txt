Dr. H. 13. Reynolds, '9G, formerly of
Palo Alto, has written to J. E. Mc-
Dowell asking for volunteers to his
field hospitals. Dr Reynolds is in need
of about forty men to complete the
complement of his four companies. j
The letter follows in part:
"I have a high-grade lot of selected
men in my field hospitals, but by trans
fers to aviation, special signal and
other services have lost a number of
men. In my four companies I am
therefore short of my complement by
about forty men. Inasmuch as many
Stanford men will probably come up
with the next quota it occurred to me
that there might be enough to volun
teer for this service to fill up my
ranks. It is an interesting service and
assurance of a group of associates
that would not obtain in the line
service.
"Let me know the prospects, and if
there seems to be a probability of flll
i ing up I will give you details as to
procedure. Nearly all of my four hos
pitals are made up of volunteers."
