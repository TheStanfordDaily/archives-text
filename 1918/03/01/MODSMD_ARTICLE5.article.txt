# LEADERS DISCUSS EXTENSION OF "Y" CAMPAIGN TO ROW
## 
### 
Complete reports of the work to
date of the Y. M. C. A. in enrolling
men in study classes were turned in
last night when the group leaders met
for their first normal class. Plans
were furthered for carrying on the
work in the fraternities, Palo Alto,
and among the commuters.
Professor A. T. Murray has been se
lected to instruct the leaders of the
Encina groups in the normal classes.
All leaders and assistants will become
thoroughly familiar with the subjects
before they undertake to discuss them
before the members of their classes.
George Linn, '18, who is in charge
of the Encina end of the campaign,
announces that the work will be con
tinued there Monday. Six classes
have already been organized which
will meet regularly on Monday even
ings, and two more will meet Tues
days. The committee hopes to estab
lish at least ten groups there.
The campaign among the houses on
the Row is in charge of F. W. William
son, '19. On Monday noon some
speaker from the faculty will address
the men at each fraternity, explain
ing the object and details of the dis
cussion groups. Monday evening the
Y. M. C. A. conference delegate from
each house will tal<e up the proposi
tion and enroll those men in his house
who are interested. Members of the
faculty and graduate students will
probably be selected to lead the groups
on the Row.
