## 
### 
Complete reports of the work to
date of the Y. M. C. A. in enrolling

were furthered for carrying on the
work in the fraternities, Palo Alto,
and among the commuters.
Professor A. T. Murray has been se
lected to instruct the leaders of the
Encina groups in the normal classes.

thoroughly familiar with the subjects
before they undertake to discuss them
before the members of their classes.
George Linn, '18, who is in charge
of the Encina end of the campaign,
announces that the work will be con
tinued there Monday. Six classes

The campaign among the houses on
the Row is in charge of F. W. William
son, '19. On Monday noon some
speaker from the faculty will address
