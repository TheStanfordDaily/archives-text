# VARSITY NINE DOWNS OLYMPIC TEAM IN 7-0 CAME
## LILLY KNOCKS HOMER IN SEVENTH Cardinals Play Tight Brand of Ball—Winged "0" Secures 5 Hits 
### 
Stanford Varsity nine turned the |
tables on the Olympic Club Saturday j
and defeated the Winged "O" team by
a 7-0 score. Lifur pitched good ball
and held the club men down to five 1
hits. The Varsity secured the same j
number of bingles off the San Fran- .
cisco slabster. Lilly knocked a home
run in tlie seventh.
Lifur only walked one man and kept
the hits so scattered that there was !
seldom any danger of the Olympic j
nine crossing the plate. Good work
on the part of the Cardinal outfielders !
in catching what looked to be almost
impossible flies was a big factor in
shutting out the San Francisco team.
Action in Second Inning.
Dickey reached third base in the
first frame but was prevented from
scoring when the Olympic outfielder j
grabbed a long fly, making the third :
out. Things began to loosen up in the
second round and Galloway, Doe, and '
Lifur added runs to the Stanford j
side of the score. After this, the Olym- j
pic pitcher tightened up and only two
men reached first in the next three '
innings. None of them were able to
get any farther than the second bag.
Stanford got to work again in the
sixth. Galloway and Wayland grab
bed hits and scored on a sacrifice by
Doe and an error by the Winged "0"
catcher.
Lilly put the game in cold storage
during the seventh inning -when he
knocked a home run over the center
fielder's head, scoring Howes before
him. Only seven men faced Lifur dur
ing the last two innings.
Galloway failed to come up to his
usual form at short and allowed a
couple of errors to be marked against
him. Masters held down the initial
sack in the absence of "Cash" Davis,
who was injured by a bad blow in the
eye from a wild ball just before the
game started.
