# ASK CALIFORNIA FOR INDOOR COMPETITION
## 
### 
Arrangements are being made by
Physical Director E. R. Knollin for
holding an indoor track meet and an
apparatus competition meet with Cal
ifornia during the early part of the
next quarter. The proposition as it
now stands has been put up to Cali
i fornia with suggested dates and
. events.
April 10 is the date suggested to
California for holding the indoor track
meet in Encina gymnasium. Califor
nia has been asked to hold an ap
paratus competition between the uni
versities at Berkeley on Wednesday,
April 3. These dates are only tenta
tive as well as are the lists of events
which have not yet been sanctioned
by California. All men in the Uni
versity would be eligible for compe
tition in the indoor track meet even
if engaged in some other form of
sport.
If satisfactorily arranged with Cal
ifornia the apparatus meet would
probably include such events as the
horizontal and parallel bar, flying
rings, horse, and tumbling. As yet
no arrangements have been made to
grant emblems for competition in the
meets.
According to Knollin, Stanford has
some good men in both the indoor
track events and the apparatus stunts
and should be able to put up good
competition. R. G. Rogers, '20, has
beer showing up exceptionally well
in the running high dive, while S. L.
Hargrove, '18, has been showing form
in the running high kick and double
running high kick that looks as if the
records are in danger.
