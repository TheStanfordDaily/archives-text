# BISHOP HUGHES WILL GIVE FOUNDERS' DAY ADDRESS
## MISS SHEDD TO PRESENT SERVICE FLAG Exercises To Be Held in the Memorial Church Sunday Night 
### 
Plans for Founders' Day exercises
have been completed by the commit
! tec on public exercises under the di
rection of the chairman, Professor
S. W. Young. A special service has
been prepared for Sunday evening in
the Memorial Church, since this an
nual celebration will be held on
March 10 instead of March 9, as pre
viously.
Bishop Hughes of Boston will give
the Founders' Day address at the
service. This well known speaker
has preached at Stanford before and
will be able to give the true signifi
cance of Founders' Day.
The service flag which the women
are giving to the University will be
presented by Miss Margaret Shedd,
'20, chairman of the Women's War
Emergency Committee. The flag will
hang permanently in the church as a
lasting tribute to the men who have
gone from the University. W. M.
Newhall, president of the Board of
Trustees, will accept the flag for the
University.
An unusual feature of the Founders'
Day service is to be the procession
which is to march into the church led
by the Reserve Officers' Training
Corps. The Palo Alto clergy, the emer
itus professors, J. E. McDowell, assist
ant registrar, and the president of the
Alumni Association will follow. Miss
Harriett Bradford, dean of women,
! with Miss Shedd, are also to march in
the procession, together with Acting
President C. D. Marx, members of the
Board of Trustees, Bishop Hughes,
and the Rev. D. C. Gardner.
Miss Edith Harvey, '17, who is well
known for her splendid voice, will
sing two solos.
The Founders' Day banquet, which
is usually held in the evening of
Founders' Day, will not be held this
year, according to J. E. McDowell.
