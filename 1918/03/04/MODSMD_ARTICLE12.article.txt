# Fish Wins Novice Tennis Tournament
## Sixteen Entries Show Good Form in Novice Meet 
### 
Lounsbury Fish, '21, won the novice
tennis tournament held Saturday
morning by defeating A. C. Devlin,
'20, in the finals by the score of B—6,8 —6,
o—6, 10 —8. The meet turned out
very successfully, as over sixteen men
turned out, and some high-class play
ing was exhibited.
This tournament was the first event
of the season in tennis, and served
to give a line on possible candidates
for the varsity, which will have to be
composed entirely of new men, as
none of the 1917 veterans have re
; turned. The varsity game with Cali
fornia will be played here on April 19,
allowing about six weeks of prepara-
I tion.
At present there are six men each
on the varsity and freshman
squads. Among the men now play
ing on the former are Captain W. V.
IJurrill. Jr., '20, A. C. Devlin, '20, D. N.
Barry, Jr., '20, and 11. H. Hoss, '17.
Regular practice is now being held
on the Encina courts, and Cardinal
supporters declare chances are bright
of triumphing over tlie Blue and Gold
I next, month.
