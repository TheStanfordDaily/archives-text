# BAND URGES MEMBERS TO ATTEND PRACTICES
## More Interest Necessary To Prevent Dissolution in Near Future 
### 
Unless more interest is taken in the
Stanford Hand, its dissolution in the
| near future is imminent. For the past
four weeks from eight to twelve men
I only have been attending the regular
! practices. Unless the number is in
j creased at the next practice on Mon
| day at 4:15 p.m., in the band room on
the top floor of the Engineering cor
ner, the discontinuance of the band is
almost certain. The organization can
only live by the support of men who
are willing to attend practice regu
larly. The Stanford Band is a worth
while tradition and the school has a
reputation for supporting traditions
which should be maintained. The dis
continuance would be an injustice to
the faithful few who have been work
ing. It rests with the musicians who
are now in college not to allow an
other organization to become a war
victim.
