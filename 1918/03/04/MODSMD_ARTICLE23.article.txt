"Tlie Changing World and the Un
changing Christ," was the subject of
the sermon delivered by Dr. A. J. Mc-
Cartney of the Kenwood Evangelical
Church of Chicago in Memorial
Church yesterday morning.
"We are living *n a shaken world,"
he declared, "and there are some who
express great concern for the con
servation of humanity. The power
of Christ has been challenged, and it
is our duty to maintain that the gos
pel is still the hope of the race; that,
we should accept no other than the
power of Jesus Christ. There is a
dynamic force in the hearts of man
kind that works toward the redemp
tion of humanity."
