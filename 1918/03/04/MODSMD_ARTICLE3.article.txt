"Behind the Bars," or "A Night in
the Redwood Jail" will be a thrilling
chapter in the memoirs of "Pinky"
Samis, honorable president of the
Sophomore Class.
Samis was captured by a crew of
|ifreshmcn Friday afternoon and start-
I ed on his way to the city in a fresh
j man's machine. But unfortunately
for the 21'ers and their guest, the
same machine had already appeared
in the public eye when it had previ
ously been stolen by some sopho
mores, but later recovered by the
owner.
All went merrily until the party
reached Redwood. Here the police
force put its foot in the wheel of
progress and tried to arrest the fresh
man for driving his own car. It was
a humiliating experience for his hosts
and generously and tactfully "Pinky"
tried to speed up the identification
process. But for once in his life he
started something he couldn't finish.
Hostilities were declared between the
sophomore president and the police
force. After a few brief maneuvers
"Pinky" was on the inside looking
out.
Disturbing the peace was the
charge preferred against him, but
"Pinky" indignantly insists that his
peace was the only one interfered
with, for, according to him the Red
wood city jail is overpopulated and
his tiny cellmates were restless.
Ten dollars was the value placed
on "Pinky's" golden head by the law.
Begging, borrowing, and stealing, the
freshmen raised the ransom, bailed
out the sputtering "Pinky" and con
tinued their royal progress to the city.
