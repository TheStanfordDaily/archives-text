# OPERA OPENS JUNIOR WEEK
## Full House Is Promised by Seat Sale 
### 
Opening with the production of
"Betty's Boots" on Thursday night,
the 1919 Junior Week, in spite of its
war-time promises to be
one of the most successful of recent
Junior Weeks. The festivities are
limited this year to the Junior opera
and the Prom, fireworks and lake
sports being dispensed with.
The seat sale for "Betty's Boots"
which opened today augurs well for
the success of the 1919 Junior opera,
being one of the largest sales in re

cent years. Good seats are still to
be had, however, and may be secured
at the Bookstore or at Weingartner's
in Palo Alto, and at the box office
Thursday night.
The coach and cast of "Betty's
Boots" are busy this week putting the
finishing touches on the production,
which promises to be one of the most
original of Junior operas ever seen on
the campus. The book and music
have been written by Ram's Head,
aiul are characterized by sparkling
dialogue and catchy melodies.
Miss Elizabeth Mail, '20, who plays
the role of Betty Stanton, is well suit
ed for her part in the lead. In the
story she is an orphan adopted into a
rich family, and complications ensue
when she is accused of stealing a pair
of diamond boots which are found in
her possession.
Plans for the Junior Prom have
been completed, and all indications
point to one of the most successful
of the social events of the season on
Friday night, March 8. The Prom
will be held in Encina Hall. Tickets
for the formal may still be had at
the Bookstore. They can be exchanged
later for programs.
