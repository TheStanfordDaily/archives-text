# OPERA OPENS JUNIOR WEEK
## Full House Is Promised by Seat Sale 
### 
Opening with the production of
"Betty's Boots" on Thursday night,
the 1919 Junior Week, in spite of its
war-time promises to be
one of the most successful of recent
Junior Weeks. The festivities are
limited this year to the Junior opera
and the Prom, fireworks and lake
sports being dispensed with.
The seat sale for "Betty's Boots"
which opened today augurs well for
the success of the 1919 Junior opera,
being one of the largest sales in re

cent years. Good seats are still to
be had, however, and may be secured
at the Bookstore or at Weingartner's
in Palo Alto, and at the box office
Thursday night.
The coach and cast of "Betty's
Boots" are busy this week putting the
finishing touches on the production,
which promises to be one of the most
original of Junior operas ever seen on
the campus. The book and music
have been written by Ram's Head,
