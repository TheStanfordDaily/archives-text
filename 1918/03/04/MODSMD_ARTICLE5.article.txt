# Track Men Have First Competition
## 
### 
Stanford track men indulged in
their first competition over regular
distances Saturday afternoon with
many encouraging results. The R. O.
T. C. meet originally scheduled for
Saturday was called off because of
the lack of time for the companies to
organize their teams. The squad
workout was substituted.
Competition was close in prac
tically every event, and the
times good as a result. Compara

tively few field event men were on
hand, bringing to light the weakness
of the Cardinal in the weights.

Especially encouraging was the
work of Linn in the broad-jump, his
winning leap carrying him twenty
two feet. He likewise came second

Marx's statement says,"it seems de
sirable again that an authoritative
statement be made of such relations.
"When the University agreed to
grant the military authorities the use
of the grounds on the south side of
San Francisquito Creek, it was stip
ulated and agreed that the lines of the
camp on the University grounds should
not be a thoroughfare for persons
going to or from the camp. This con
dition is formulated in the following
extract from the commanding gen
eral's letter under date of July 25,
1917:
Original Agreement,
" 'If this request meets with ap
proval we shall guarantee:
"'(1) That no soldiers will be per
mitted to pass the lines formed by the
fences on the road sides bounding this
ground and nearest the University
grounds, and that every possible pre
caution will be enforced to the end
that the University life shall in no
way be interfered with by the sol
diers of the camp.
"'(2) That no use shall be made
by the military of the two roads
bounding this tract of land,'
"The obvious need of this regulation
was that as this region of the cam
pus was the domain of the students
for recreation and exercise, their
freedom and convenience would be
much restricted if no such regulation
existed.
"It was also understood that move
ments of masses of troops should
avoid such proximity to the Univer
sity buildings as would be liable to
disturb classes in session. There was
also an understanding between the
University and the army authorities
that any further regulations, which
might by experience be found neces
sary to ensure that the normal activ
ities of the University should not be
seriously interfered with by the pres
ence of too great a number of troops
in grounds or buildings at any one
time, would be executed by the mili
tary authorities.
"No other limitations than these
were placed by the University upon
the presence of troops upon the cam
pus. On the contrary, the attitude of
the University authorities has been
that the soldiers are entitled to, and
should receive, in their individual ca
pacity, the same privileges as are ac
corded to any other citizens. It must
be understood that this does not ap
ply to grounds leased to outside par
ties though owned by the University."
