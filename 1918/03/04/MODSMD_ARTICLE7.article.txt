# SOLDIERS NOT BARRED FROM CAMPUS BY UNIVERSITY
## MARX TELLS OF ORIGINAL AGREEMENT Action, If Any, Taken by Authorities at Local Cantonment 
### 
Soldiers at Camp Fremont have not
been denied permission to enter the
Stanford University grounds through
any action by the faculty or the Board
of Trustees as alleged in some news
paper stories sent out from Camp
Fremont in the last few days, it was
pointed out by Acting President C'. D.
Marx of Stanford today.
Whatever restrictions may have
been made were made by the com
manding officer at the camp, he said
further, for the Board of Trustees or
the faculty has taken no action of any
kind concerning the camp since last
summer. Mr. Marx made public the
letter of Major General H. Liggett,
commanding general at the time the
University gave the military author
ities permission to use Stanford land
for the cantonment, which shows that
the original restrictions were made
by Major General Liggett himself.
