# WOMEN TO HELP FRUIT GROWERS HANDLE THEIR CROPS
## ARRANGE SUMMER WORK TO SAVE FRUIT Current Wages To Be Paid Women Who Enter This Patriotic Work 
### 
Valley fruit growers, and packers
are most enthusiastic at the prospect
of college women helping with their
crops during the summer, according
to Miss Harriet Bradford, who with
Professor R. W. Doane discussed the
matter with the president of the
Prune and Apricot Growers' Associa
tion at San Jose yesterday. The as
sociation lias members throughout the
state from Red Bluff to Banning, and
gave absolute assurance that all col
lege women wishing to work with the
fruit could be placed where the need
for labor is great. In fact, growers
assert that unless college women and
other public spirited women offer to
help with the fruit crops this summer
a serious waste will be the unavoid
able result.
The work will not be strenuous and
any woman who can pass a reason
able physical examination should be
able to do it easily. The season for
apricots opens about July 4 or 5, runs
about thirty days as an average, and
is foilowed by peach and prune crops,
making in all a season of sixty to
eighty days' work for extra labor.
The interim between the close of the
spring quarter and the opening of the
apricot season will probably offer
work in the picking of berries. With
apricots, peaches, and prunes, the
work which the college women will do
will be largely in the cutting and dry
ing of the fruit.
