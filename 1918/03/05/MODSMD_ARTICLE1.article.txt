# WOMEN TO HELP FRUIT GROWERS HANDLE THEIR CROPS
## ARRANGE SUMMER WORK TO SAVE FRUIT Current Wages To Be Paid Women Who Enter This Patriotic Work 
### 
Valley fruit growers, and packers
are most enthusiastic at the prospect
of college women helping with their
crops during the summer, according
to Miss Harriet Bradford, who with
Professor R. W. Doane discussed the
matter with the president of the
Prune and Apricot Growers' Associa
tion at San Jose yesterday. The as
sociation lias members throughout the
state from Red Bluff to Banning, and
gave absolute assurance that all col
lege women wishing to work with the
fruit could be placed where the need
for labor is great. In fact, growers
assert that unless college women and
other public spirited women offer to
help with the fruit crops this summer
a serious waste will be the unavoid
able result.
The work will not be strenuous and
any woman who can pass a reason
able physical examination should be
able to do it easily. The season for
apricots opens about July 4 or 5, runs
about thirty days as an average, and
is foilowed by peach and prune crops,
making in all a season of sixty to
eighty days' work for extra labor.
The interim between the close of the
spring quarter and the opening of the
apricot season will probably offer
work in the picking of berries. With
apricots, peaches, and prunes, the
work which the college women will do
will be largely in the cutting and dry
ing of the fruit.
Packers pay by piece work and have
agreed to pay the women the current
rates of wages which ranges from a
minimum of $1 a day to $2.50 or $3 a
day, according to the skill of the
worker.
At present the exact demand for
summer labor cannot be estimated,
but the women are assured that there
will be need for all possible workers.
By the end of May definite estimates
will be secured from the packers.
However, all applicants should be
signed up for the work by May 1 in
order that the placing of the units
may be arranged. Women will be ex
pected to work for periods of at least
two weeks' duration and longer if pos
sible.
The committee which is arranging
the agricultural unit wishes to empha
size the fact that the work is a patri
otic one, and that while the women
will be under no deficit, living ex
penses will not leave much profit from
the wages of the fruit growers.
The local plan for the agricultural
units is to use one of the houses for
a headquarters and to establish sub
bases in the fruit growing districts.
The unit will be divided into groups
of four or more, each under the direc
tion of a general director. Satisfac
tory living and working conditions in
the working districts are assured
women. Pood will bo simple and
wholesome and living quarters com
fortable.
A women's assembly will be held
some time this week or next to put
the proposition of agricultural units
before the University women.

apricots opens about July 4 or 5, runs
about thirty days as an average, and
is foilowed by peach and prune crops,
making in all a season of sixty to
eighty days' work for extra labor.
The interim between the close of the
spring quarter and the opening of the
apricot season will probably offer
work in the picking of berries. With
apricots, peaches, and prunes, the
work which the college women will do
will be largely in the cutting and dry
ing of the fruit.
Packers pay by piece work and have
agreed to pay the women the current
rates of wages which ranges from a
minimum of $1 a day to $2.50 or $3 a
day, according to the skill of the
worker.
At present the exact demand for
summer labor cannot be estimated,
but the women are assured that there
will be need for all possible workers.
By the end of May definite estimates
will be secured from the packers.
However, all applicants should be
signed up for the work by May 1 in
order that the placing of the units
may be arranged. Women will be ex
pected to work for periods of at least
two weeks' duration and longer if pos
sible.
The committee which is arranging
the agricultural unit wishes to empha
size the fact that the work is a patri
otic one, and that while the women
will be under no deficit, living ex
penses will not leave much profit from
the wages of the fruit growers.
The local plan for the agricultural
units is to use one of the houses for
a headquarters and to establish sub
bases in the fruit growing districts.
The unit will be divided into groups
of four or more, each under the direc
tion of a general director. Satisfac
tory living and working conditions in
the working districts are assured
women. Pood will bo simple and
wholesome and living quarters com
fortable.
A women's assembly will be held
some time this week or next to put
the proposition of agricultural units
before the University women.
Valley fruit growers, and packers
are most enthusiastic at the prospect
of college women helping with their
crops during the summer, according
to Miss Harriet Bradford, who with
Professor R. W. Doane discussed the
matter with the president of the
Prune and Apricot Growers' Associa
tion at San Jose yesterday. The as
sociation lias members throughout the
state from Red Bluff to Banning, and
gave absolute assurance that all col
lege women wishing to work with the
fruit could be placed where the need
for labor is great. In fact, growers
assert that unless college women and
other public spirited women offer to
help with the fruit crops this summer
a serious waste will be the unavoid
able result.
The work will not be strenuous and
any woman who can pass a reason
able physical examination should be
able to do it easily. The season for
