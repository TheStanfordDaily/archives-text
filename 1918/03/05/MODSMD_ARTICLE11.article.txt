# STANFORD WOMEN'S UNIT
## 
### 
The organization of the Stanford women's unit for relief work in
France is undoubtedly the higgest war project which lias been taken up
by the University. Up to the present time, very little about the efforts
of Stanford women to perform war services has been heard in the out
side world, but now they are to come before the public with something
worth while to offer. Although the purpose of the unit is not by any
means to make itself spectacular, there is no doubt but that a great deal
of attention will be attracted by its efforts.
It is decidedly "up to" Stanford to support this project in every pos
sible way. If the outside world feels called upon to pass criticism on
what Stanford women are doing in war work, as it surely will, we want
favorable criticism. The only way to get it is by backing the latest and
most important plan for service. Furthermore, we want these women who
are going over-seas to represent us and in order to do that they must feel
that the good old Stanford spirit is behind them.
Our first duty lies in supporting the unit financially. Thirty thousand
dollars must be raised in the short time of four weeks. The sum seems
large, but it must not be thought of as an additional call for relief funds,
but as a component of the regular war work being undertaken by the
United States government. Relief work is in one way the broadest war
service for it benefits not only the warring nations, but humanity at large.
Those who endeavor to construct a sound basis for future well-being out
of the pillaged remains which destructive forces have left behind them,
should have the most ardent support of every member of the Stanford
student body. The response of the students will be the biggest factor in
the success of the women's unit.
