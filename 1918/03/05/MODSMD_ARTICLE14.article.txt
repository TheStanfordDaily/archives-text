## TELL OF GREAT HARDSHIP Have Been Supported by Cercle Francais During the Past Year 
### 
Word has just been received by the
Cercle Francais from the two French
orphans whom they have been sup
porting for the past year. The money
needed for the maintenance of one of
these children for a year is $36 and
their extreme need and the gratitude
they feel toward those who are help
ing them can readily be seen from
their letters, of which a translation of
that of Raymonde Beante follows:
Allouagne, January 9, 1918.
Dear Sir: I have received your
letter as well as the money which you
have sent me. I thank you very much
for it. The Americans are very good
for us orphans of the war. I write
you this to lot you know who I am.
I am a little girl, six years of ago.
When my papa went to war I was
three years old. My mother was very

sick and she is it still. My father was
a miner, he pulled in the coal from
tiie depth of the mine. He went to
war, he was a sergeant when he was
ordered to an assault before Thelus, j
close to Arras. Ho was mortally j
wounded on September 25, 1915. He
died on account of his wounds a few
hours afterwards.
You see, monsieur, though I am J
young, I have seen many tears of
my mama and my grandmama and
my brother who is ten years old.
Your little orphan of France sends
you the best regards of friendship
and also her picture.
Your quite devoted
RAYMOND*: BEANT.
The second letter is written by Dan
iel Ramecours and tells how he was
but ten months old when his father, a
switchman in civil life, was called to
arms and that he was killed in active
service on March 3, 1915.
