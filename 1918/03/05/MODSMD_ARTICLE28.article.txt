"The ideals of the individual must
be trained in order for us to develop
from nationalism into international
ism," said Professor E. R. Hulme in
a talk on "Nationalism and Interna
tionalism" given to the Cosmopolitan
Club last night.
"There are three things that we can
do now to promote nationalism: first,
permit free trade; second, keep the
open door; third, promote education.
Race, language, literature, and
geography are not essential to nation
alism, but those factors which are es
sential are common memories, hopes,
and ideals."
