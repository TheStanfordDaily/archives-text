# Husky, Let's Have Some Lake Sports
## 
### 
Dear Husky,
A Long Time ago.
The Committee.
For Junior week.
Decided.
Not to have any Spring Sports.
At the Lake.
And, Husky, it's the Lake.
I'm talking about.
You wanted Racing.
And Canoe-tilting.
And Crazy things.
Where You get wet.
And Boating at night.
And You said.
In your Paper.
That it wasn't Right.
To Abolish sports.
Because they don't cost much.
And Are lots of fun.
And, Husky, I think so too.
But it's too bad.
That You wasted the time.
To Write all those things.
Because there isn't any Lake.
Nor Anything.
I Thank You.
