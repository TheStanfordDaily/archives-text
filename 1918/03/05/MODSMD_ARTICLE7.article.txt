# STANFORD WOMEN SOON TO HAVE CIVILIAN RELIEF UNIT IN FRANCE
## DR. WILBUR APPROVES PLAN France Issues Call For Immediate Help 
### 
To Stanford women has come the call to service, and in quick response
to it a Stanford women's unit for civilian relief work in France is being
organized. The unit will go to Europe under the auspices of the Ameri
can Red Cross, and will do any work it is called upon to do in the pil
laged villages in France. In response to'the question of whether such a
group of workers was needed, came a cablegram to Miss Dorothy Egbert,
'IG, saying that it was not only badly needed, but that the call was imme
diate. With the support of all Stanford, the unit hopes to leave early in

April.
Capable Women Respond.
Scores of capable Stanford women
have responded from all parts of the
United States to the questionnaires
that were sent them, but in order to
insure the greatest possible efficiency
in the personnel, definite announce
ment of names cannot be made until
all tliose recommended have been
heard from.
The plan for a Stanford women's
unit was formulated by Miss Dorothy
Egbert, 16', who has been in close
touch with conditions in France
through her affiliation with the cam
paign for relief in Belgium and
France under Mrs. Vernon Kellogg.
Tiie plan was laid before Dr. Wilbur,
who approved it strongly and who has
supported it from the beginning with
advice and suggestions, and for the
past four months plans have been
laid.
Advisory Board Selected.
An advisory board was formed for
the selection of members consisting
of the following people: President
Ray Lyman Wilbur, chairman; Act
ing-President Charles David Marx,
vice chairman; Mr. J. 13. McDowell,
treasurer; Miss Dorothy Egbert, or
ganizing secretary; Mrs. Payson J.
Mary Isabel McCracken, correspond
ing secretary. Other members of the
board are: Dr. George James Pierce,
Professor Maxson Stillman, Dr. and
Mrs. Vernon Kellogg, Professor Au
gustus T. Murray, Dr. Henry George
Mehrtens, Professor Clara S. Stolten
berg, Mrs. Payson J. Treat, Miss Har
riet Bradford, dean of women, and
Miss Edith Mirrielees.
Success Depends on Personnel.
Since it is felt that the success of
(he unit will depend wholly on the
character of its personnel, a very
careful selection of women is being
made. Sturdy women with health
and powers of endurance are needed.
They must possess tact, adaptability,
and resourcefulness, together with
executive ability. Requirements are
that they be able to speak, read, and
write French readily; that they have
some special qualification or ability
and have some experience in social
service or civil work. A rudimentary
knowledge of first aid is necessary
and a physician's recommendation as
to fitness is also required.
Will Train in France.
For the first three months after
reaching France the unit will receive
training under the Red Cross there,
and will perform any duties assigned
them. After this special training in
fields where work is already begun,
the unit will be sent to new centers,
where it will organize the work of
paving the children of France and car
ing for the helpless and old. Milk
and peddlers' routes will be estab
lished; recreation centers oponed for
the children who have forgotten how
to laugh; and temporary shelter and
clothing provided for those who have
been left roofless and without pro
visions by tho German invaders. The
work is not reconstruction, merely
temporary provision for those unable

to care for themselves until actual
reconstruction after the war can be

Financial aid will be given the
project by the American Red Cross,
but Stanford is to be asked to con- j
tribute a shafre to the work of the j
Stanford women's unit. A circular
letter is being sent to all the alumnae. j
and the amount subscribed by these ;
and the undergraduate student body
is expected to amount to $30,000. The |
amount seems large, in addition to all
other war funds, but the unit will be a 1
part of America's war work. Stan- •
ford's part will be to support the unit '
to the utmost, and definite plans are ,
being made now for a campaign for
funds that will begin immediately.

To Stanford women has come the call to service, and in quick response
to it a Stanford women's unit for civilian relief work in France is being
organized. The unit will go to Europe under the auspices of the Ameri

laged villages in France. In response to'the question of whether such a
group of workers was needed, came a cablegram to Miss Dorothy Egbert,
'IG, saying that it was not only badly needed, but that the call was imme
diate. With the support of all Stanford, the unit hopes to leave early in

April.
Capable Women Respond.
Scores of capable Stanford women
have responded from all parts of the
United States to the questionnaires
that were sent them, but in order to
insure the greatest possible efficiency
in the personnel, definite announce
