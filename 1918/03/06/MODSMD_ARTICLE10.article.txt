# CAP AND GOWN WILL GIVE DANCE
## 
### 
Vaudeville acts and dancing will
make up the benefit performance
which Cap and Gown are planning for
Founders' Day, in the Women's Club
House. The funds will go to furnish
the new rooms on the third floor which
will be formally opened Saturday
night.
Excellent talent has been obtained
for the vaudeville show, which will
begin at 7 o'clock. Singing, dancing,

and a violin solo will lend to the per
formance a touch of the Orpheum. Ad
mission for this first part will be 50
cents, and for the dance to follow will
be $1.
As no alumni banquet has been
planned for the Founders' Day this
year, the dance given by the women's
honor society will furnish an oppor
tunity for the visitors to get together
for a reunion.
