# JUNIOR WEEK TO END WITH ANNUAL IRISH MARATHON
## HOLDOVER SHOW PLAN Track Events to Start at 10 O'clockâ€”25 Cents Admission 
### 
Festivities of a curtailed Junior
Week will end Saturday morning, with
the annual Irish Marathon and the
Holdover Show. Ten o'clock has been
set as the hour for the final events
to begin, to give ample opportunity for
the Prom-goers and other late ones
to snatch a few hours' sleep.
The freshmen and sophomores will
enter strong teams in the Marathon
from present indications. Due to the
great absence of junior track men in
college, the 1919 runners will com
bine with the seniors in entering a
full team of twenty-four men. With
the combined resources of both classes
behind it, this team ought to be one
of the strong competitors in the fea
ture event. The holdovers threaten to
enter a team in the Marathon, but in
dications point to difficulties from
lack of men.
However, whether or not they com
pete in the relay, the holdovers will
come into their share of the morn
ing's glory, since they will present
their annual show, including feature
events.
Admission of 25 cents is to be
charged in accord with past custom,
and to enable students to queen to the
event, and thus make it a conclusion
to the Prom and Opera.
All men who desire to compete on
their class teams will have to run
through the trials some time this week
and let their class captains under
stand their relative abilities. The
captains were appointed a few weeks
ago, and are: J. D. McPherson for the
seniors, cooperating with M. J. House
for the juniors; E. L. Davis for the
sophomores, and K. A. Wright for the
freshmen.
