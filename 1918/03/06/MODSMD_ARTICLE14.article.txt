# GETTING BY
## 
### 
Few persons can say with truth that they have never tried to "get
by." The gentle art of "getting by" ifc a common weakness —so common,
indeed, that we rarely stop to consider its true significance. The phrase
as used on the campus implies getting credit without doing any real
work. It applies to the class of students who can pass in their courses
without making any particular exertion, but who could do a great deal
better if they tried. "Getting by" is not a man's job, nor does it prepare
for a man's job after undergraduate years are over.
Not only does this habit prevent many from gaining all that they
should in the way of knowledge from their university work, but it pre
vents the University from doing its full part in developing real character
in the individual students.
The university that only aims to impart knowledge without forming
the character of the young men or young women who attend it is a fail
ure. It is important for the man or woman who comes to the university to
be something as well as to know something. Unless the character is
strengthened, the student will not bear the mark of the real university
trained graduate when he or she leaves.
It is this "general training" which is the "very heart and essence of
university training," according to President Wilson. The "atmosphere"
of a university is an impalpable thing, and yet that is the only name which
fits the indefinable something which makes a university what it is and
gives meaning to the phrase "university man." Here at Stanford we go
bne step further and in the phrase "Stanford man" we sum up the high
est qualities of the university-trained student.
We cannot produce this kind of man; this type of character cannot
be developed if th« highest ambition of the individual student is to "get
by." The strange part of it is that the person who establishes this as his
aim frequently fails to even "get by."
