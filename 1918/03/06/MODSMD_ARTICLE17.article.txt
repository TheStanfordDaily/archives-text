# Senior Cards Must Be In March 10 for Quad
## 
### 
Cards for senior records have been
sent, out by the 1919 Quad manage
ment and have been mailed to all mem
bers of the senior class, with the in
junction that they do not hesitate to
fill them out at the earliest possible
time and return them to Editor S. E.
Rriggs.
Absolutely the last, date for accept
ing these cards has been set for March
10. Records received after this date
will not be accepted, so all 1917 men
are advised to rack their brains for
their list of deeds and memberships
in organizations, and return records
of same to the Quad management.
