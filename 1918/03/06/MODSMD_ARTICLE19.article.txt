A benefit recital given by Mrs. Ed
ward MacDowell, widow of the
famous composer, for French and BpI
gian refugee children, will be held to
morrow night at Palo Alto in the
Women's Club House.
All proceeds will go directly to the
American Red Cross in Paris, which
is doing a marvelous work for chil
dren, under the direction of Dr. Wil
liam Palmer Lucas of San Francisco.
In one of the reports of Mrs. Lucas,
who is with her husband, she sum
marizes the underlying purpose thus:
"If the American Red Cross can keep
the health of the children good and
thereby give that great encourage
ment to the grownups, new life will
quickly develop where the old has
been blotted out."
Mrs. MacDowell, who will interpret
her husband's selections, is herself a
musician of ability. She will be as
sisted by Mrs. Blanche Hamilton Fox,
who will sing a group of songs. The
recital will begin promptly at 8
o'clock. Tickets are 50 cents and are
on sale at Weingartner's drug store in
Palo Alto.
