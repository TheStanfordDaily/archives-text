# CHITTENDEN OIL PAINTINGS TO BE EXHIBITED HERE
## 
### 
A collection of oil paintings of Cali
fornia wild flowers by Mrs. Alice B.
Chittenden, California's well known
flower painter, will be exhibited at the
Art Gallery from March 10 to April 1.
There will be about 200 paintings
displayed, showing 271 varieties of
flowers. This exhibit has taken Mrs.
Chittenden a period of twenty-five
years to complete, and in some in
stances long and difficult trips to iso
lated sections of the state have been
necessary to secure rare specimens.
Sometimes after painting the bloom, it
would be two or three years before
the fruit could be obtained.
To make the collection complete, it
was necessary to include rare flowers
to be found only in the desert, and
for this purpose Mrs. Chittenden made
a trip to the Colorado Desert, gath
ering flowers as far south as the
Salton Sea. Many of these were too
delicate to be transported and had to
be painted where they grew.
Flowers are not Mrs. Chittenden's
only subject, as she has established
an enviable reputation as a portrait
painter. She has executed a large
number of commissions in New York
as well as in the West. Receiving
her training first in San Francisco,
she then studied abroad under prom
inent masters in Paris, returning to
San Francisco, where she has become
identified as California's most prom
inent woman artist.
The exhibition, with its brilliant
key of nature coloring, is fitting for
this month, as the green hills and
trees in Stanford's environment
promise soon to break into blossom
ing wealth.
