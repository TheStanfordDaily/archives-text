# TAXIS AND FLOWERS RULED OUT AT PROM
## 
### 
Following the custom of the cam
pus for many years, the committee
for the 1919 Junior Prom, which will
be held Friday night in Encina, an
nounces that taxis and flowers are to
be barred from the formal. Another
announcement of interest to Prom
goers is that the intermission will
come between the tenth and eleventh
dances.
Something new is promised by the
committee in the way of decorations
for the Prom. Encina Club room is to
be decorated in ivy and other greens,
color being supplied by great bunches
of fruit blossoms which will be placed
inartistic- baskets. However, the dec
orations will not be very elaborate,
as the Junior Class wishes to "I-loov
erize" as much as possible.
Programs for the Prom will be espe
cially attractive, being the work of
M. A. Oliver, '15. They are of gray
leather, with a hand painted design
on the cover.
