# DR. W. B. MUNRO DEFINES DEMOCRACY IN ADDRESS
## 
### 
"What is democracy—this word
that is on every man's tongue?" asked
Dr. William Bennett Munro in his ad
dress before the assembly this morn
ing on ''Why We Are at War and the
Importance of Victory."
"Democracy has a variety of defi
nitions," continued Dr. Munro, "the
political idea being, perhaps, the most
general. True democracy, however,
is not builded on political structure
and the franchise of a country. 11!
so, Germany today would be one of
the world's greatest democracies, for
there every man has a vote. But the
German representative of the people
has no actual control in the govern
ment. The United States claims to
be a real democracy because there
is an actual relationship between the
will of the people and the running of
the government. Democracy has,
also, a social side. The United States
is one of very few nations that has

no orders of nobility or class distinc
tion that is recognized by law.
"My personal conclusion on Amer
ican democracy," said Dr. Munro,
"came after a careful investigation on
my part some years ago. I asked
immigrants, coming into Boston, the
question, 'Why do you come here?'
and the answer was, 'because we can
get ahead and make money.' What a
man or woman would be depends, in
this country, on personal efforts—the
democratic economic motive. In most
European countries the opposite is
found, what a man or woman is to
be depends on his or her economic
station."
Dr. Munro pointed out the great
importance of standing behind our
armies and understanding why we are
fighting. "The only good soldier is
one who is fighting for a cause he
believes in and who bases his belief
on knowledge. Is it nothing to us that
ideals battled for during the last two
centuries shall be now cast aside?
That intrigue and secrecy shall take
the place of frankness and honor?"
In closing Dr. Munro quoted an of
ficer of the French army, who said:
"Americans are not asked to save
France, but they are asked to save
that spirit which France has stood
for and is fighting for, a thing
which America has professed to stand
for since its birth." He also spoke
of the Stanford women's unit, the first
to be established under the auspices
of the Red Cross. "Stanford has been
given an unusual honor and these rep
resentatives of Stanford women
should be upheld in time, money and
sympathy."

Dr. William Bennett Munro in his ad
dress before the assembly this morn
ing on ''Why We Are at War and the
Importance of Victory."
"Democracy has a variety of defi
nitions," continued Dr. Munro, "the
political idea being, perhaps, the most
general. True democracy, however,
is not builded on political structure
and the franchise of a country. 11!
so, Germany today would be one of
the world's greatest democracies, for
there every man has a vote. But the
German representative of the people
has no actual control in the govern
ment. The United States claims to
be a real democracy because there
is an actual relationship between the
will of the people and the running of
the government. Democracy has,
also, a social side. The United States
is one of very few nations that has

no orders of nobility or class distinc
tion that is recognized by law.
"My personal conclusion on Amer
ican democracy," said Dr. Munro,
"came after a careful investigation on
my part some years ago. I asked
immigrants, coming into Boston, the
question, 'Why do you come here?'
and the answer was, 'because we can
get ahead and make money.' What a
man or woman would be depends, in
this country, on personal efforts—the
democratic economic motive. In most
European countries the opposite is
found, what a man or woman is to
be depends on his or her economic
station."
Dr. Munro pointed out the great
importance of standing behind our
armies and understanding why we are
fighting. "The only good soldier is
one who is fighting for a cause he
believes in and who bases his belief
on knowledge. Is it nothing to us that
ideals battled for during the last two
centuries shall be now cast aside?
That intrigue and secrecy shall take
the place of frankness and honor?"
In closing Dr. Munro quoted an of
ficer of the French army, who said:
"Americans are not asked to save
France, but they are asked to save
that spirit which France has stood
for and is fighting for, a thing
which America has professed to stand
for since its birth." He also spoke
of the Stanford women's unit, the first
to be established under the auspices
of the Red Cross. "Stanford has been
given an unusual honor and these rep
resentatives of Stanford women
should be upheld in time, money and
sympathy."
"What is democracy—this word
that is on every man's tongue?" asked
Dr. William Bennett Munro in his ad
