# 1919 Opera Ready for Production
## 
### 
"Betty's Boots," the 1919 Junior
Opera of mirth and melody, is ready
for production in the Assembly Hall
tomorrow night. The cast is letter per
ect and confidently awaits the rising of
the curtain on the first melodious en
semble of the opera. All indications
point to "Betty's Boots" as the "pep
piest" and cleverest Junior Opera
ever presented to a Stanford audience.
The final rehearsal will be held this
evening.
Artistic stage settings, combined
with unique ideas of lighting, will pro
duce one of the most charming stage
effects ever seen outside of profes
sional circles. The costumes are ex
ceptionally striking, being diiferent
from those of any previous Junior
Opera.
Miss Elizabeth Mail, '20, who plays
the lead, has one of the most winning
stage personalities ever seen at Stan
ford. She puts her songs over in true
professoinal fashion. Miss Beatrice
Flett, '20, in the role of Yvette, has
splendid opportunities for displaying
her dancing ability, which is certain
to be one of the features of the show.

Miss Marian Brown, '20, sings a num
ber of fine songs, and Miss Ann Gard
ner, '20, as Bernice Colville, is cer
tain to score a tremerdous hit.
L. L. Pickering, '20, as Lemuel Fos
ter, one of the adopted orphans, has
great opportunities for displaying his
clever stage ability. Russell Penn
field, as played by C. T. Littleton, '20,
is exceptionally well handled, and C.
L. McCormick, '19, is certain to win
approval.
Pretty girls galore in the Liberty
Belles chorus and the Ingenue chorus
will cause the campus to sit up and
take notice. The men's chorus is also
extremely clever in songs and dances.
The big feature of the opera will be
the music, which contains some of the
catchiest melodies ever heard in a
Junior Opera. A decided surprise is
in store for the audience when the
special "Betty's Boots" orchestra is
seen. It promises some innovations
in the musical line,
be added to the opera by J. S. Doron,
'19, and M. J. Levy, '19. Their razor
battle on the fire escape of a sky
scraper is said to be especially thrill
ing.
