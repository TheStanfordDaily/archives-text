# TUESDAY CONCERT IS SUCCESSFUL
## 
### 
Schubert Club, assisted by Noel
Stearn, gr., and C. L. McCormick, '19,
last night gave a most successful con
ccrt before an audience which packed
the Little Theater. The singing was
for the most part excellent, and
showed a degree of finish unusual in
amateur programs of this kind.
The program was divided into three
parts. The first consisted of two se
lections, "Maytime," by Horatio W.
Parker, and "Hark! Hark! the Lark,"
by Schubert.
The second consisted of solbs by
Stearn, tenor, and McCormick, bass.
Stearn, formerly a member of the
Cardinal quartet, sang Hcnschel's
"Morgen-Hymne" and the "Kashmiri
Song," by Wood-forde-Finden, iij a
pleasing voice and with exceptionally
clear enunciation. McCormick, who is

to take a part in the Junior Opera, ex
hibited a voice of great depth, volume,
and beauty of tone. His rendition of
"Invictus," by Bruno Hulin, was par
ticularly fine.
"The Lady of Shalott," by the Schu
bert Club and Miss Lucile Huff, so
prano soloist, was the third and long
est part of the evening's program.
This is a beautiful piece of music
written to Tennyson's famous poem by
Wilfred Hendall. Schubert Club did
excellent work in this, exhibiting
good training as well as natural tal
ent. Miss Huff, the soloist, carried a
difficult part very creditably.
R. S. Gangestad, '18, who was listed
on the program, was unable to take
part. Mr. Louis H. Eaton was the di
rector, and Miss Mildred Turner, '18,
accompanist.
