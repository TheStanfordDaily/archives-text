### 
Special events of an unusual char
acter will feature the Irish marathon,
slated for lu o'clock Saturday morn
ing. Three-legged races, sack races,
and carrying races are only a few of
the attractions promised by Quad
rangle Club, which has charge of the
marathon, according to past custom.
Holdovers To lie 011 Hand.
The holdovers will be on hand in
numbers and held a mysterious meet
ing to discuss plans for their annual
show at noon today. They even prom
ise to enter a full relay team, but
campus cynics are inclined to doubt
this. No announcement has been
forthcoming as to what the nature
of the show will be. The races men
tioned above will draw many special
entrants, since it has been definitely
stated that one dollar merchandise
orders on Wideman's store will be
given to the winners.
Seniors and Juniors Combine.
If the holdovers enter a team, there
will be four relays competing in the
regular event. The seniors and jun
iors will combine, under the joint di
rection of M. J. House, '19, and J. I).
McPherson, '18, and ought to present a
combination hard to beat. Twenty
four men will be on each relay as
in the past, and each man will run a
quarter-mile, the whole race being
over a four-mile course.
Track officials are asked to be 011
hand for the marathon and the special
events. Any one who possesses a stop
watch is requested to lend it to Cap
tain A. F. Wilson, as he wishes to
get the time of every runner. Dr.
Folsom, a familiar figure to all Stan
ford track men, will do some of the
timing, assisted by Dr. Angell.
Twenty-five cents admission will be
charged.
