# ASSEMBLY ETIQUETTE
## 
### 
Yesterday's assembly brought out even more forcibly than the last
one, the lack of courtesy on the part of many of the students who make up
the audience. A considerable number deliberately got up and left during
the address, and just as soon as the speaker was seated a large section ran
for the door instead of waiting for the traditional "Hail, Stanford, Hail."
There have also been complaints of individuals and groups of individuals
carrying on conversations throughout the period loud enough to disturb
several adjacent rows occupied by people who wanted to hear what was
being said.
It is surprising to note that there are persons at this University who
do not possess enough instinctive courtesy to behave themselves properly
at a university assembly. Perhaps the reason is that we have not had very
many practices of late, or maybe it has been merely thoughtlessness. We
hope that this is so. Whatever the reason, these breaches of etiquette
must cease or Stanford's reputation for courtesy will soon be lost.
Nothing makes the old-time grad back for a visit wonder so much if
Stanford spirit is not dying out as to see the students of the present day
fail to stay one minute after an assembly to sing the "Hail, Stanford,
Hail." There are a few transfers and freshmen who do not even know
what it is yet.
