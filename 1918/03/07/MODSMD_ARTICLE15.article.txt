# JUNIOR WEEK
## 
### 
Junior Week is with us again. This year it comes earlier on the cal
endar and there isn't so much of it, but just the same it's Junior Week. The
opera will start things tonight. Tomorrow night at the Prom the traditional
"no flowers —no taxi" rule will be strictly enforced, and Stanford's demo
cratic spirit will again be saved from this annual danger. We do regret
that Jupiter Pluvius has deprived us of a Lagunita and lake sports, but
there will be the Irish marathon on the track Saturday morning. Every
body, queeners and non-queeners, that are not running or "holdovering" 011
the oval will be on hand. It's going to be the same old >narathon that in
the past has proven one of the most attractive features of Junior Week.
