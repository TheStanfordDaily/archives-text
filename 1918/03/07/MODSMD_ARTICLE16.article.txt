# SPINELESS
## 
### 
Several weeks ago, when, as tli e reader may remember, there was
some talk about playing football with California, The Daily Californian
said nary a word about the matter until it was all over, thereby causing
Stanfordites who watched the paper hoping for official encouragement to
believe that its editor was spineless —figuratively speaking, of course. Later
we learned that the graduate manager "over there" had it taken out —the
article, not the spine, we understand. Now, with a show of backbone, the
Daily Californian lias deplored the habit of making personal fouls that
marked or rather marred the playing of the Blue and Gold varsity basket
bailors, especially in the second game with Stanford. A San Francisco
sporting writer fails to take the matter seriously and accuses the editor of
knowing more "about fowls personally, than about personal fouls!" Just
the same we are pleased to note that after all there is a possibility that
the Daily Cal is not entirely "spineless."
