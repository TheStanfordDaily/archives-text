# Alvarez Explains Cooperation Era
## Lecturer Urges Solidarity Among North and South American States 
### 
Differences between the German
and American conceptions of interna
tional relations and the future organ
ization of the world's economic sys
tem were explained yesterday by Dr.
Alejandro Alvarez, the noted Chilean
authority, in the second of the series
of lectures he is giving on the cam
pus.
"There is a belief that only inter
national law has been destroyed by
the war," said Dr. Alvarez, "but as a
matter of fact the whole economic
and political structure of the world
has been overturned, and will have to
he reconstructed after the war. We
are passing from the regime of in
dividualism ushered in by the French
Revolution to the regime of coopera
tion which will hereafter be the guid
ing system of mankind.
"There are two conceptions of co
operation," continued the speaker,
"the German and the American The
German consists in state supremacy,
or state socialism, while the American
emphasizes state control. German
professors and German universities
| have already started spreading their
doctrines; the American universities
'should begin to promulgate the Amer
| ican conception if it is to become the
dominant one.
"Two schools of international law
now exist in the Western Hemisphere,
the Anglo-Saxon and the Latin
| American," asserted Dr. Alvarez,
i "There are wide divergences between
them which should be consolidated
I and the whole system should be uni
fied in order that the Americas may
| achieve the best results. Particular
attention should be paid to the many
international and constitutional prob
i lems confronting the American coun
' tries which do not exist in Europe."
KxpLnincd German Commercial
Explained German Success.
Dr. Alvarez explained the reasons
I'or the commercial successes of the
I
j Germans in Latin-America before the
; war. The causes for their former
commercial supremacy were, he said,
!as follows: the knowledge of the
I Spanish language by the German
commercial agents, their adaptability
to South American needs and preju
dices, the liberal terms of credit
which they granted to their South
American customers, the establish
[ ment of branches of German banks in
Latin-American cities, the develop
ment of the German national mer
chant marine, the intensive study of
! the South American markets by the
| German agents, the divergences in
the commercial law of the United
States and the Latin-American nations,
and the use of different systems of
weights and measurements by the
United States and the Spanish-Amer
-1 ican states. The speaker warned his
I audience that the Germans will re
j gain their commercial supremacy in
I South America alter the war unless
; the American merchants improve
their methods.
