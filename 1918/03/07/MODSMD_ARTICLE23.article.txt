# SPIRITUALISTIC BOOK TOPIC AT WRANGLERS'
## 
### 
Sir Oliver Lodge's book, "Ray
mond," which has caused such a storm
of criticism in the scientific and re
ligious world, was the topic of a talk
by Miss Ellen Calhoun, '20, at Wrang
lers' last night. There has been a
great spiritualistic awakening in Eng
land since the outbreak of the war;
"Raymond" seems to be a culmina
tion of this movement. The author
describes communication that he has
received from his son, who was killed
in the war. Authorities on the sub
ject believe that not enough evidence
has been given to prove the veracity
of the book, but it bears investigation.
