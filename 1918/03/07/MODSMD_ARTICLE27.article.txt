# Majors in ye History Must Take Language Test Tuesday
## 
### 
Since the Daily has been requested
to give those History majors who are
still with us a gentle but firm push
in the direction of knowledge, here
goes. All of them must, in the first
place, think they can read a foreign
language, and in the second place, be
able to do so before a "Committee on
Who's Who" next Tuesday afternoon.
Requirements must be satisfied, Profs
must be appeased, or little Johnny
Senior has as much chance of grad
uating as a cat has of being strangled
by milk. The edict follows:
"The History department requires
of its majors 'a reading knowledge of
at least one foreign language by the
end of the junior year.'
"To permit the seniors of this year
to satisfy this requirement a test will
be held on Tuesday, March 12th, at 3
p.m., in the History reading room
(230). You and all other SENIOR
HISTORY MAJORS are expected to
be present.
"EDWARD KREHRIEL,
"For the Department.
"March 6, 1918."
