# ASSEMBLY TUESDAY TO EXPLAIN WAR WORK
## Member of Smith College Unit Tells of Great Field for Workers 
### 
| An effort is being made to secure
some of California's biggest men to
speak at a special assembly next
Tuesday at 11 o'clock. The assembly
will be held to acquaint the student
body with the work which the Stan
ford Women's Unit for Civilian Relief
' in France will do.
| Miss Dorothy Egbert, '17, who orig
| inated the plan to send over a group
'of western women, will leave Satur
day morning for Los Angeles. For
one week she will direct her efforts
in that city toward raising funds to
finance the undertaking, by a cam
paign among Stanford alumnae. A
mysterious friend from Chicago do
nated $1,600 to the cause, and asked
to have her name withheld from pub
lication.
An urgent appeal for the support of
the undergraduate student body will
be made at the assembly, and a cam
i paign to raise Stanford's share of the
j funds launched immediately, for the
unit hopes to wend its way East early
'in April. A cablegram from Red
S Cross headquarters assured the or
! ganizers that the sooner the work of
the Stanford women could begin, the
better.
There are doubts in the minds of
! some as to the need of American
women going to France to do the
work. A member of the Smith Col
lege unit doing work in Paris writes
back to this country:
"Thousands of men have destroyed
the country and it will take tlious
jands to build it up. There are only
handfuls here, a score here, a dozen
there. And besides the reconstruction
has to wait for the transportation
facilities that are being concentrated
on the army. In the meantime the
heartening of the little remnant of
women and children, and the desper
ate need of temporary relief for the
hand-to-mouth existence is real work,
a mission that 1 hope all the alumnae
will get behind and support."
The member of the Smith unit told
a heartrending tale of how the little
children are beginning to smile again
after the founding of recreation cen
ters, of the relief that comes through
the aid of free clinics, dispensaries,
supply stations, and milk routes. She
stresses the fact that the need is in
creasing all the time with the con
tinuation of the war, and the fact
that French women are needed to take
the place or the men engaged or lost
in war.

unit hopes to wend its way East early

There are doubts in the minds of
! some as to the need of American
women going to France to do the
work. A member of the Smith Col
lege unit doing work in Paris writes
back to this country:
"Thousands of men have destroyed
the country and it will take tlious
jands to build it up. There are only
handfuls here, a score here, a dozen
there. And besides the reconstruction
has to wait for the transportation
facilities that are being concentrated
on the army. In the meantime the
heartening of the little remnant of
women and children, and the desper
ate need of temporary relief for the
hand-to-mouth existence is real work,
a mission that 1 hope all the alumnae
will get behind and support."
The member of the Smith unit told
a heartrending tale of how the little
children are beginning to smile again
after the founding of recreation cen
ters, of the relief that comes through
the aid of free clinics, dispensaries,
supply stations, and milk routes. She
stresses the fact that the need is in
creasing all the time with the con
tinuation of the war, and the fact
that French women are needed to take
the place or the men engaged or lost
in war.
| An effort is being made to secure

body with the work which the Stan
ford Women's Unit for Civilian Relief
' in France will do.

one week she will direct her efforts
in that city toward raising funds to

paign among Stanford alumnae. A
mysterious friend from Chicago do
nated $1,600 to the cause, and asked
to have her name withheld from pub
lication.
