## SPECIAL ORCHESTRA TO BE ATTRACTION Elizabeth Mail, '20, Will Play Leading Role in 1919 Production 
### 
With the rising of the first curtain j
iu tonight's production of "Betty's!
Boots" one of the neatest little sur-!
prises in the way of Junior Opera
ensembles and choruses will be re-j
vealed to the audience. In fact the;
entire opera is replete with surprises 1
and novelties which are certain to win j
the approval of Junior Opera goers. I
Cast and choruses have completed the
final rehearsal, and are ready to face !
the footlights tonight. The opera is
scheduled to begin at 8:15 p.m.
.Music Is Feuture.
The music for "Betty's Hoots" will
be the big feature of the production,!
and, as interpreted by the special or
chestra, is sure to "get over" in great
style. The orchestra itself will be one |
of the most interesting novelties of
the show.
Miss Elizabeth Mail, '20, in the role
of Betty Stanton, does some clever
singing and acting. The part is that :
of an orphan wlio, along with L. L.
Pickering, '20, as Lemuel Foster, is
adopted into a wealthy family, and
who is implicated in the mysterious
disappearance of a pair of diamond
boots belonging to Bernice Colville,
otherwise Miss Ann Gardner, '20.
Both Pickering and Miss Mail put true
professional snap into their songs
and characterization. Miss Gardner
has a pleasing voice and a good stage
appearance, and will greatly contrib
ute to the success of the opera.
C. T. Littleton, '20, as Russell Penn
field, a young society man, is perfect
ly at home in his role, and his person
ality will make his songs a feature of
the show. C. L. McCormick, '19, and
1 Miss Marian Brown, '20, do good work
in the parts of Mr. and Mrs. Van Dorn,
the people who adopt the two orphans.
They both have excellent voices,
which are displayed to best advantage
in their songs.
Miss Beatrice Flett, *20, does some
charming work in her dancing spec
' ialties. In the role of Yvette, the
j French maid, Miss Flett makes the
most of a small part. Arthur Wills,
i '19, as Michael, the Irish butler,
j sings some catchy songs and plays a
humorous part well.
M. L. Levy, '19, and J. S. Doron, '19,
bring gales of comcdy into the pro
duction with their impersonations of
two colored gentlemen. Their song,
"Over On the Other Side" and the
razor fight in the second act should
take the audience by storm.
The choruses are particularly well
trained both in their songs and
dances, and the Liberty Belles and
Pony chorus offer a variety of beauty
that will rival any ever seen on the
I Stanford stage.
Prominent among the musical num
j bers will be "The Ragtime Knitting
Club," sung by Miss Elizabeth Mail
and the Liberty Belles, a song with a
I wonderful syncopated melody which
will be one of the hits of the show.
The theme song, "Betty's Boots," is
another winner with a haunting mel
ody. "The Heavenly Ball," "The Pic
ture That the Shamrock Brings to
Me," and "An Orphan's Life Was
! Never Meant for Me," are other certain
hits.
