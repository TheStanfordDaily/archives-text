# STANFORD DEBATERS LEAVE
## Meet Southern Team Tomorrow Night 
### 
Stanford debaters leave the campus
tonight for the southland, where they
will take the stand tomorrow night
against the orators from the Univer
sity of Southern California on the
question of conscription of labor. The
Stanford squad has been in active
preparation for many weeks, but the
team was not chosen until recently,
and is composed of J. E. Simpson,
'21, A. G. Westwick, '19, and W. 112.
Ames, '18, with G. P. Wood, '20, as
alternate. The men are listed in the
order that they will speak.
Little Known About Southern Team.
Little or nothing is known of the
southern team, but Debating Coach
K. 10. Leib said today that "Although
Stanford is debating the hardest side
of the question, the team ought to

win." The question reads, "Resolved:
that in war time the federal govern
ment should employ conscription of
labor to insure the necessary output
of war materials." Stanford is to
uphold the affirmative, the side that
California took in the intercollegiate
no-decision debate last quarter.
The team has been working hard
up to the last minute, having been
put through a debate on their subject
by Justin Miller, former Stanford de
bating coach. Ames is well known
on Stanford debating teams, having
debated the negative of the same
question against California last quar
ter. Westwick is a speaker of rare
ability and has debated on Stanford
teams against. U. S. C. before this.
Simpson is new to Stanford forensics,
but has earned his placc through hard
work as well as splendid oratory.
New System of Selecting Judges.
A new system of selecting judges
for the debate has been adopted, and
will be tried out tomorrow evening.
Each college has named an alumnus
to represent its interests. Stanford's
representative is J. E. Shelton, '12,
former Carnot medalist. The two
delegates meet and name a third
party, who in turn is responsible for
the selection of judges. The judges
are not announced until the night of
the contest, perfect faith being placed
in the ability of the man delegated
to solect them. This method does
away with much disputing over
judges, and practices detrimental to
the success of debating.
