# FRESHMAN JOURNALISTIC HONORS
## 
### 
It is indeed with a feeling of awe and self-importance that each suc
ceeding generation of the glorious Freshman Class undertakes to put out
their annual green sheet. The class of 1921 undertakes this burden, ful
If awaro of the dangers that lurk in the field of journalism lor the new
and inexperienced "Frosli." Each succeeding group tries to excel the class
before them in "pep" and "jazz" and yet not overstep the bounds that the
staid journalistic student of the upper class would impose on the action of
the unrestrained first-year man.
Yet, when the annals of history record the story of the Class of 1921
and the present freshmen have gone into the oblivion of the future, we
realize that countless generations will look back to 1921 l'or the highest rep
resentative type of college journalism.
