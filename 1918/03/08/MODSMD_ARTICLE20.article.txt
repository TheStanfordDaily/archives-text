'500" Mail Miscarries
In a recent issue of the Daily Cali
fornian, the accompanying article ap
peared which bears out the general
rule that everyone, including the
"500," is aspiring to the more alti
tudinous departments of the service:
"A Stanford co-ed very nearly
missed receiving a letter from Flying
Cadet Cobb because the latter mis
took the 'Fly Leaf contribution box
for a mail box. Only a slight delay
was caused because the envelope had
no news value and was speedily de
posited in the proper place, with a
companion letter also found in the
small black box."

Dear Brethren Collegiates:
The time and hour has come that
we should take action!
In the name of our country and our
flag, I call attention of every loyal
student, and especially the attention
of Harold George Swendsen, promi
nent member of the D. P. A., to the
fact that he has a traitor, a veritable
crony of the Kaiser, IN HIS MIDST!
Ever since H. Hoover issued his
famous injunction against irresponsi
ble eating, the inmates of our cam
pus have waxed wan and weak from
lack of proper nourishment. And yet
the above mentioned H. G. S. has
added THREE POUNDS, SIX AND
A HALF OUNCES to his Interior
architecture, his sleek prosperity and
rotundity increasing daily!
Now, dear schoolmates, would it not
be a highly diplomatic move to trans
port this veritable engine of destruc
tion to Germany, where he would un
doubtedly consume the Kaiser's food
supply in a month or so, thus bring
ing autocracy to terms? I urge you
all to aid in this patriotic movement!
With our motto "fish and olive oil"
ever in mind,
I bid you ad dewa,
Peruna Serp, '21.
