# WAR TAKES MANY MEN FROM RANKS OF JOURNALISTS
## WOMEN TAKING PLACES Great War Opens Many Positions to Feminine Reporters 
### 
With the call into government ser
vice of a large number of newspaper
men, women are rapidly taking their
places as reporters. Despite this, the
demand for trained journalistic work
ers can hardly be met. Already some
of the newspapers on the Pacific
Coast have staffs made up almost en
tirely of women reporters, according
to Ural N. Hoffman, instructor in
journalinm, in charge of the courses
this year. The increased need for
newspaper workers is reflected in
the enrollment here this quarter,
which totals forty-eight students di
vided evenly between men and women.
The enrollment of the fall quarter was
thirty-four, including fourteen women.
Nearly all the advanced students in
journalism at Stanford have entered
army service, the four ambulance
units especially having taken a large
number of them. Most of those en
rolled this year are underclassmen.
Nearly all the men are under the
present draft age and are continuing
their courses until needed for govern
ment work.
Eight men and eight women are be
ginners in news writing; eleven men
and four women are doing practical
reporting; four men and two women
are enrolled in editorial management,
and twelve men and four women are
trying to master the difficulties of
editorial writing.
Of the forty-eight enrolled in the
four courses offered, twenty-one are
registered as majors preparatory to
journalism. Sixteen are in the English
department, five in the Economics de
partment.
For the use of the students in jour
nalism the English department is tak
ing this quarter 25 newspapers of
different types, including both Eastern
and Western papers. In this list are:
Boston Transcript, Springfield Repub
lican, New York Times, New York
Evening Post, New York World, Phil
adelphia North American, Philadel
phia Ledger, Washington Post, De
troit News, Chicago Tribune, Chicago
Herald, Kansas City Star, Kansas City
Times, Emporia (Kan.), Gazette, Den
ver Post, Seattle Times, Portland
Oregonian, Los Angeles Times, Louis
ville Courier-Journal, New Orleans
Times-Picayune, Fresno Republican,
and the five San Francisco papers.
The activity of the journalism stu
dents on local publications is seen by
the fact that twenty are on the staff
of The Daily Palo Alto, one on the
Illustrated Review, one on the Se
quoia, two on the Chaparral, and two
on the Palo Alto Daily Times.
For the spring quarter a course in
advertising, with five units of credit,
will be offered. The enrollment will
be limited to fifteen students, with
preference given to journalism majors
and students who have had elementary
economics and psychology. Others
from the advanced classes will be ad
mitted until the limit is reached. The
class is not yet filled, and Mr. Hoff
man has asked those who wish to en
roll to do so before the end of this
quarter.

Eight men and eight women are be
ginners in news writing; eleven men
and four women are doing practical
reporting; four men and two women
are enrolled in editorial management,
and twelve men and four women are
trying to master the difficulties of
editorial writing.
Of the forty-eight enrolled in the
four courses offered, twenty-one are
registered as majors preparatory to
journalism. Sixteen are in the English
department, five in the Economics de
partment.
For the use of the students in jour
nalism the English department is tak
ing this quarter 25 newspapers of
different types, including both Eastern
and Western papers. In this list are:
Boston Transcript, Springfield Repub
lican, New York Times, New York
Evening Post, New York World, Phil
adelphia North American, Philadel
phia Ledger, Washington Post, De
troit News, Chicago Tribune, Chicago
Herald, Kansas City Star, Kansas City
Times, Emporia (Kan.), Gazette, Den
ver Post, Seattle Times, Portland
Oregonian, Los Angeles Times, Louis
ville Courier-Journal, New Orleans
Times-Picayune, Fresno Republican,
and the five San Francisco papers.
The activity of the journalism stu
dents on local publications is seen by
the fact that twenty are on the staff
of The Daily Palo Alto, one on the
Illustrated Review, one on the Se
quoia, two on the Chaparral, and two
on the Palo Alto Daily Times.
For the spring quarter a course in
advertising, with five units of credit,
will be offered. The enrollment will
be limited to fifteen students, with
preference given to journalism majors
and students who have had elementary

mitted until the limit is reached. The
class is not yet filled, and Mr. Hoff
man has asked those who wish to en
roll to do so before the end of this
quarter.
With the call into government ser
vice of a large number of newspaper
men, women are rapidly taking their
places as reporters. Despite this, the
demand for trained journalistic work
ers can hardly be met. Already some
of the newspapers on the Pacific
Coast have staffs made up almost en
tirely of women reporters, according
to Ural N. Hoffman, instructor in
journalinm, in charge of the courses
this year. The increased need for
newspaper workers is reflected in
the enrollment here this quarter,
which totals forty-eight students di
vided evenly between men and women.
The enrollment of the fall quarter was
thirty-four, including fourteen women.
Nearly all the advanced students in
journalism at Stanford have entered
army service, the four ambulance
units especially having taken a large
number of them. Most of those en
rolled this year are underclassmen.
Nearly all the men are under the
present draft age and are continuing
their courses until needed for govern
ment work.
