# HOOVER DECIDES ON STANFORD AS SITE FOR $30,000 HOME
## TO BUILD ON SAN JUAN Food Administrator's Home Will Be Finest On Peninsula 
### 
Herbert C'. Hoover, United States
Food Administrator, and Stanford
graduate, has chosen San Juan Hill,
back of the Stanford campus, as the
site of a $30,000 residence which
will be erected immediately after the
close of the war.
As a trustee of the University
Hoover is .thoroughly familiar with
all the available sites around the cam
pus and chose this location on San
Juan Hill, above Reservoir Drive, as
the one which most appealed to him
for a home. The plans are being
carefully worked out by Louis Chris
tian Mullgardt, the architect, in con
junction with Mrs. Hoover, and the
building promises to be one of the
finest and most interesting residences
down the peninsula.
The outward appearance of the
structure is being planned by the ar
chitect to correspond with intimate
sympathy with the Stanford land
scape. The house will be constructed
of hollow tile and plans call for a
Cordova tile roof. The tile used will
be of soft shades grouped around the
prevailing dull red color of the typical
Spanish tile. The structure will be a
fireproof one. The exterior color will
be in laminated plaster.
Ten sleeping-rooms and bath-rooins,
a large living room, a dining-room, a
play-room, study, and other apart
ments complete the plan of the in
terior. The living and dining rooms
are so arranged as to provide for
amateur theatrical performances.
Mosaic and hardwood floors will be
laid throughout the house. The in
terior woodwork will be of selected

hardwoods and there will be sculp
tured mantels.
It is intended to lay out the hillside
in front of the building in natural
gardens which will be further beau
tified by lawns and flowers. The hill

side will be left in its natural slope
and not terraced.
According to the National Food Ad
ministration's policies, Hoover will
follow his own injunction and just at
present the land on the proposed site

of his home is being used for the pro
duction of food. Potatoes and corn
will be the chief products of the land
this year. It is most likely that the
land will not be broken or construc
tion begun until after the peace treaty

of the present conflict is signed.
Meanwhile, Architect Mullgardt is
busy drawing complete plans of the
Interior, which will be passed on by
the Hoovers and will be ready when
complete construction is ordered.

terior. The living and dining rooms
are so arranged as to provide for
amateur theatrical performances.
Mosaic and hardwood floors will be
laid throughout the house. The in
terior woodwork will be of selected

hardwoods and there will be sculp

It is intended to lay out the hillside
in front of the building in natural
gardens which will be further beau
tified by lawns and flowers. The hill

side will be left in its natural slope
and not terraced.
According to the National Food Ad
ministration's policies, Hoover will
follow his own injunction and just at
present the land on the proposed site

of his home is being used for the pro
duction of food. Potatoes and corn
will be the chief products of the land
this year. It is most likely that the
land will not be broken or construc
tion begun until after the peace treaty

of the present conflict is signed.
Meanwhile, Architect Mullgardt is
busy drawing complete plans of the
Interior, which will be passed on by
the Hoovers and will be ready when
complete construction is ordered.

Herbert C'. Hoover, United States
Food Administrator, and Stanford
graduate, has chosen San Juan Hill,
back of the Stanford campus, as the
site of a $30,000 residence which
will be erected immediately after the
close of the war.
As a trustee of the University
Hoover is .thoroughly familiar with
all the available sites around the cam
pus and chose this location on San
Juan Hill, above Reservoir Drive, as
the one which most appealed to him
for a home. The plans are being
carefully worked out by Louis Chris
tian Mullgardt, the architect, in con
junction with Mrs. Hoover, and the
building promises to be one of the
finest and most interesting residences
down the peninsula.
The outward appearance of the
structure is being planned by the ar
chitect to correspond with intimate
sympathy with the Stanford land
scape. The house will be constructed
of hollow tile and plans call for a
Cordova tile roof. The tile used will
be of soft shades grouped around the
prevailing dull red color of the typical
Spanish tile. The structure will be a
fireproof one. The exterior color will
be in laminated plaster.
Ten sleeping-rooms and bath-rooins,
a large living room, a dining-room, a
play-room, study, and other apart
ments complete the plan of the in
terior. The living and dining rooms
are so arranged as to provide for
amateur theatrical performances.
Mosaic and hardwood floors will be
