Department of Electrical Engineering,
Stanford University, Cal., March 7,
1918.
A number of underclassmen in en
gineering have expressed the wish to
become radio operators through in
struction and training to be given by
the University. Their idea is that
sucli training would admit them to the
Radio Division of the Signal Corps
of the army or navy and assure their
early promotion.
The Department of Electrical En
gineering has considered this matter
with some care and has found that:
1. The department has not the time
nor equipment required to train radio
operators. Available time and facili
ties are by no means ample for caring
for the present class in radio en
gineering covering the course as
specified by the government.
2. The department is informed
abundantly that there is proportion
ally a greater scarcity of technical
men than of operators of every sort
as required for the army, navy, and
\var industries. It is the duty of every
student while in college to give close
attention to his technical training.
Proficiency therein will gain him ad
vancement. Skill as an operator pur
-1 chased at a loss of a knowledge of
technics is a loss to all and a misuse
of energy and facilities on the part
of the student and the University. In
regard to the training of radio en
gineers, the government has placed
but little emphasis on operating; by
far the most of their training must be
in the technics.
3. Seventy-five per cent of the train
ing of the radio operator is said by the
chief electrical engineer of our lead
ing radio telegraph service to consist
in code proficiency, i.e., in ability to
send and receive in the continental
code. The technics that an operator
must have or can acquire without
proper foundation are few, simple,
and soon accomplished.
4. All underclassmen in engineer
ing should bring themselves to real
ize that their advancement in mili
tary service is much more dependent
upon their progress in technology
than in operating of any sort. On
entering the army and navy as sol
diers and sailors they will be ad
vanced quickly if they have technical
knowledge even though they are pro
ficient in no particular line of opera
tion. Through technics they are pre
pared to learn rapidly, which is the
all important thing. This has been
seen to work out abundantly during
the past few months.
5. Doubtless every underclassman
who feels that he can practice send
ing and receiving the continental code
without detriment to his technical
studies can do so with some prob
ability of aiding his advancement upon
entering the army or navy. (For ex
ample the government requires those
who pass in our present class of radio
engineers to be able to receive the
modest number of 10 words per
minute.) Two or more students can
practice the code anywhere with the
aid of a few dry cells, a buzzer and a
telegraph key. There are a number
of able amateur radio operators in
the University whose advice or co
operation in perfecting such code
training can doubtless be secured at
small cost.
6. The department wishes to in
sist that the engineering division,of
Stanford is not the place for a young
man whose ambition is to become a
radio operator. The training of radio
operators is well cared for in many
trade schools. Stanford is organized
to train engineers. It is a misuse of
energies and facilities on the part of
both students and University to do
otherwise so long as the supply of
engineers is inadequate and all ener
gies and facilities are fully taken up
in their training.
7. Radio operating is related to
electrical engineering just about the
same as plumbing is to mechanical
engineering, truck-driving to trans
portation, and typewriting to execu
tive control, etc. Radio-signalling,
plumbing, truck-driving, typewriting,
etc., are as indispensable as the pro
fessions which use them, viz.: elec
trical, mechanical, and civil engineer
ing, and executive coordination. This

distinction must be kept in mind.
Stanford is equipped to prepare young
men to enter the professions; she is
not equipped and is not prepared to
train operators.
8. First and second year men in en
gineering should do their "bit" for
the nation in this hour of stress by
being hearty students with an en
thusiasm for fundamentals as they
meet them in preparation for the day
that will come quickly, wherein
knowledge of every fundamental
thing acquired will be abundantly
needed.
