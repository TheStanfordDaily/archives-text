# Freshmen Doped to Win Irish Marathon
## RACE STARTS AT 10:00 A.M. 
### 
There will be big doings tomorrow
morning when the Irish marathon, one
of the features of Junior Week, will
hold forth. One stellar team will be
entered, to wit, the freshman team.
Two other teams, the sophomore and
the junior-senior combination team,
will make an attempt, which will
without a doubt be futile and in vain,

to furnish a little competition for the
freshmen. All (lope points to a fresh
man walk-away, although the other
teams will be on hand to form a rear
guard for the '21 men.
The holdovers have repeatedly
threatened to enter a team, but their
actions are largely shrouded in mys
tery. It is rumored, though, that they

will have a show which will put all
previous ones in the background. A
statement has been made by one of
their number that they will annex
first place. Whether they will live
up to this threat or not is a question,
but they will furnish lots of fun.
Fearing the towering strength of
the freshman team, the seniors and
juniors have united in entering a
team. However, with 1921 in the field,

a victory by the upper classes is high
ly improbable. The sophomores have
entered thirty-seven men, thirteen
more than the regular number for an
Irish marathon team. They undoubt
edly figure that the nervous strain of
competing with 1921 will be so great
that several of their number will not
be able to stand up under it. Also,
the impression of a certain baseball
fight recently held remains with them.
Thus the absolute necessity for the
extra thirteen men.
The following is the line-up of the
three teams entered. All men in the

morning. The race will start at 10
o'clock.

There will be big doings tomorrow
morning when the Irish marathon, one
of the features of Junior Week, will
hold forth. One stellar team will be
entered, to wit, the freshman team.
Two other teams, the sophomore and
the junior-senior combination team,
will make an attempt, which will
without a doubt be futile and in vain,

to furnish a little competition for the
freshmen. All (lope points to a fresh
man walk-away, although the other
teams will be on hand to form a rear
guard for the '21 men.
The holdovers have repeatedly
threatened to enter a team, but their
actions are largely shrouded in mys
tery. It is rumored, though, that they

will have a show which will put all
previous ones in the background. A
statement has been made by one of
their number that they will annex
first place. Whether they will live
up to this threat or not is a question,
