# "LIZZIE'S SHOES" REVEALED. MYSTERY IS UNSOLVED
## 1921 SLEUTHS HARD AT WORK ON CASE Many of Campus Celebrities Queen to Showâ€”Knitters Make Big Hit 
### 
Just seventeen minutes and thirty
seven seconds after the time allotted
last night for the revelation of "Eliz
abeth's Shoes," Bernice Colville, the
rightful owner of Betty's footwear,
stepped forth in the radiant splendor
and blaze of the spotlight and an
nounced to an audience of campus
celebrities that the opera which was
about to be presented would reveal a
mystery to the patiently waiting audi
ence.
Mystery Unsolved.
As yet this mystery still remains un
solved in the minds of spectators and
critics. However, the best members
of the 1921 detective force are work
ing overtime on the case and promise
to reveal information in the near fu
ture which will entirely clear up any
doubt in the minds of those who were
led into participation in last night's
mystery. It is with deep regret that
we announce that the mystery will not
be unwrapped in time to publish the
facts today. Undoubtedly the next
copy of the Chaparral will be able to
furnish the public startling informa
tion concerning the mystery.
