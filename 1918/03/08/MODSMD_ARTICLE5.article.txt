# "LIZZIE'S SHOES" REVEALED. MYSTERY IS UNSOLVED
## 1921 SLEUTHS HARD AT WORK ON CASE Many of Campus Celebrities Queen to Showâ€”Knitters Make Big Hit 
### 
Just seventeen minutes and thirty
seven seconds after the time allotted
last night for the revelation of "Eliz
abeth's Shoes," Bernice Colville, the
rightful owner of Betty's footwear,
stepped forth in the radiant splendor
and blaze of the spotlight and an
nounced to an audience of campus
celebrities that the opera which was
about to be presented would reveal a
mystery to the patiently waiting audi
ence.
Mystery Unsolved.
As yet this mystery still remains un
solved in the minds of spectators and
critics. However, the best members
of the 1921 detective force are work
ing overtime on the case and promise
to reveal information in the near fu
ture which will entirely clear up any
doubt in the minds of those who were
led into participation in last night's
mystery. It is with deep regret that
we announce that the mystery will not
be unwrapped in time to publish the
facts today. Undoubtedly the next
copy of the Chaparral will be able to
furnish the public startling informa
tion concerning the mystery.
At the rise of the curtain which I
was eventually to reveal Betty's
boots, and, what was far more interest
ing to the general public, the wearer
of Betty's Boots, many noted campus
social celebrities and several society
debutantes were found occupyiug
seats in the building. Most conspic
uous of all was the large collection of
would-be social belles who occupied
gallery seats while famed athletes on
whom they would fain have lavished
their company either moved scenery
behind the curtain, piloted the audi
ence to their places, or occupied front
row seats in the auditorium.
A group of literary figures, to-wit,
the Chaparral staff, occupied seats of;
vantage on the front row. The presi
dent of the Sophomore Class, appar
ently oblivious of the scathing affair
in which he had implicated several
members of the Freshman Class less
than a week ago, walked down the
aisle escorting a well known fratern
ity brother.
Twenty-nine couples, according to
the 1921 detective agency, queened to
! the event. These same twenty-nine
| couples will, according to the same
j source of information, constitute a
'large part of the exclusive crowd
! which will attend the Junior Prom
tonight.
Play Begins.
And so, with a rustle of silks, a
flash of hosiery, and the flap of long
tailed coats, the opening chorus, in
vigorated by the punch of Nathaniel
Hawthorne Poe, paved the way for the
appearance of Betty, shod in her dia
mond boots.
Carried on by the influence of
dreamy music, the audience rose with
the plot and was held in breathless
; suspense. An occasional period of
! total darkness allowed the twenty
nine queeners in the audience to
arouse themselves from the oblivious
influence of the thickening plot and
give more specific attention to the
damsel at their side.
Betty Appears.
Bursting forth with a "Gee Whiz,
Mister," the diamond-shod Betty made
her appearance on the stage. Betty's
chief characteristic, "Gee Whiz, Mis
ter," became more and more pro
nounced as the play deepened, until
virtuous men in the audience were on
the verge of praying for Betty's soul.
Left in the height of mystery the
audience breathlessly awaited the in
termission between acts and were
again carried into a state of suspense
by the enchanting scene on a roof
garden. Real stars that twinkled and
went out and reappeared on the scen
ery in the back of the stage threat
ened to outshine members of the cast
at moments when a titter of laughter
revealed forgotten lines.
Ragtime Knitters Star.
Rivaling the Stanford Gym Club for
efficiency in high kicking rather than
knitting the Ragtime Knitting Belles
carried the audience to the grand
climax which came to an unexplained
end when Betty made an attempt at
explaining the source of the mystery
of the diamond boots.

ture which will entirely clear up any
doubt in the minds of those who were

mystery. It is with deep regret that
we announce that the mystery will not
be unwrapped in time to publish the
facts today. Undoubtedly the next
copy of the Chaparral will be able to
furnish the public startling informa

At the rise of the curtain which I
was eventually to reveal Betty's
boots, and, what was far more interest
ing to the general public, the wearer
of Betty's Boots, many noted campus
social celebrities and several society
debutantes were found occupyiug
seats in the building. Most conspic
uous of all was the large collection of
would-be social belles who occupied
gallery seats while famed athletes on
whom they would fain have lavished
their company either moved scenery
behind the curtain, piloted the audi
ence to their places, or occupied front
row seats in the auditorium.
A group of literary figures, to-wit,
the Chaparral staff, occupied seats of;
vantage on the front row. The presi
dent of the Sophomore Class, appar
ently oblivious of the scathing affair
in which he had implicated several
members of the Freshman Class less
than a week ago, walked down the
aisle escorting a well known fratern
ity brother.
Twenty-nine couples, according to
the 1921 detective agency, queened to
! the event. These same twenty-nine
| couples will, according to the same
j source of information, constitute a
'large part of the exclusive crowd
! which will attend the Junior Prom
tonight.
Play Begins.
And so, with a rustle of silks, a
flash of hosiery, and the flap of long
tailed coats, the opening chorus, in
vigorated by the punch of Nathaniel
Hawthorne Poe, paved the way for the
appearance of Betty, shod in her dia
mond boots.
Carried on by the influence of
dreamy music, the audience rose with
the plot and was held in breathless
; suspense. An occasional period of
! total darkness allowed the twenty
nine queeners in the audience to
arouse themselves from the oblivious
influence of the thickening plot and
give more specific attention to the
damsel at their side.
Betty Appears.
Bursting forth with a "Gee Whiz,
Mister," the diamond-shod Betty made
her appearance on the stage. Betty's
chief characteristic, "Gee Whiz, Mis
ter," became more and more pro
nounced as the play deepened, until
virtuous men in the audience were on
the verge of praying for Betty's soul.
Left in the height of mystery the
audience breathlessly awaited the in
termission between acts and were
again carried into a state of suspense
by the enchanting scene on a roof
garden. Real stars that twinkled and
went out and reappeared on the scen
ery in the back of the stage threat
ened to outshine members of the cast
at moments when a titter of laughter
revealed forgotten lines.
Ragtime Knitters Star.
Rivaling the Stanford Gym Club for
efficiency in high kicking rather than
knitting the Ragtime Knitting Belles
carried the audience to the grand
climax which came to an unexplained
end when Betty made an attempt at
explaining the source of the mystery
of the diamond boots.
Just seventeen minutes and thirty
seven seconds after the time allotted
last night for the revelation of "Eliz
abeth's Shoes," Bernice Colville, the
rightful owner of Betty's footwear,
stepped forth in the radiant splendor
and blaze of the spotlight and an
nounced to an audience of campus
celebrities that the opera which was
about to be presented would reveal a
mystery to the patiently waiting audi
ence.
Mystery Unsolved.
As yet this mystery still remains un
