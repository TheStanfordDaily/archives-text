# FRESHMEN NINE TO MEET S.F. TEAM
## 
### 
Followers of the national pas
time will be given their second
opportunity of the week to see a
real exhibition of baseball when
the 1921 team takes the field Sat
urday afternoon against the Me
chanical Arts High School from
San Francisco. Without doubt the
freshman players can show better
form than when they downed the
1920 men in the annual fight last
Monday night.
Ilutledge may not be able to
take his usual place at the third
sack and Reynolds may play in
that position. Teubner and Burks
will hold down the first two bags,
with Kallam on short. Kline, Sup
ple, and Parker will complete the
lineup and cavort in the outfield
positions.
All of these men demonstrated
their ability to play a good game
last week when they camouflaged
the 1!)20 pill chasers in a game
that extended all the way from
Santa Cruz to San Francisco.


A part of the 1021 baseball squad who handed one to the 1920 pill chasers
last Monday night. They cross bats with Cal on April 6.
