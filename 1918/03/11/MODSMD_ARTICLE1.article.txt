# 1920 MEN ARE VICTORS IN ANNUAL IRISH MARATHON
## SPECTATORS AMUSED BY HOLDOVER STUNTS Maynard Clips Quarter in 50 1-5 Secondsâ€”Wright Next in 52 Flat 
### 
In one of the most successful Irish
marathons held on the Stanford oval
in recent years, the sophomore team
carried their baton over the line first
Saturday morning, twenty yards to the
good of the freshmen, who in turn
were twenty yards ahead of the sen
ior-junior combination. Many good
times were made, M. T. Maynard's,
:50 1-5, was the best recorded. This
excellent bit of running earned him
the medal for non-varsity men, the
varsity gold medal^ going to H. R. Her
tel, '18, who made third best time, fin
ishing the quarter-mile in 52 1-5 sec
onds.
K. A. Wright, last lap runner for
the freshmen, had the honor of mak
ing the second best time, 52 seconds.
All three of these times were made on
the last lap of the marathon. The
average time for the winning team
was approximately 57 seconds, al
though many of the times were inac
curate.
The 1920 team did not lead until
well on in the marathon, the combined
upperclass team starting out like
world beaters and maintaining a big
lead for the first ten laps. The fresh
man speedsters were second until
Gibbs, '20, passed their runner in a
sensational quarter-mile run; they re
covered second place when Clark
passed the sophomore, who had taken
the baton from Gibbs. The 1920 run
ners soon forged ahead of their fresh
man rivals and went after the upper
division runners. Carver, '20, finally
overtook Bullis, '18, and gave the
sophomores a lead that they not only
held, but increased. With the faster
men running toward the end of the
race, they were .not pressed.
Many times centered around S3 sec
onds, some of the best of them being:
Maynard, '20, 50 1-5; Wright, '21, 52;
H. R. Hertel, '18, 52 1-5; Wilkie, '20,
52 4-5; Davis, '20, 53; F. W. Hertel,
'21, 53 15; McPherson, '18, 53 4-5.
The winning team was composed of
the following runners:
Rogers. Stamp, \ Mertz, Sparks,
Samis, Pillsbury, Esgen, Linn, Gibbs,
Terman, Carver, Bucklin, Parks, See
ly, Musser, Colglazier, Carlisle,
Thompson, Dinkelspiel, Langford,
Horn. Davis, Wilkie, Mavnard.
The holdover show materialized and
much laughter was produced from the
"perfect" representation of a scene at
a well known watering place in Red
wood. "Canary" Campbell seemed to
have been raised to the part of drink
mixer. Many clever take-offs on prom
inent collegians were given.
The special events brought to light
the reason why Stanford is so often
called the "Farm," as they centered
primarily in chicken races. The first
was won by Eppler, '21, the second
by Cooper, '17, and the third by Covey,
'20. A sack race was also held, and
was won by Crawford, '21.

52 4-5; Davis, '20, 53; F. W. Hertel,
'21, 53 15; McPherson, '18, 53 4-5.
The winning team was composed of
the following runners:
Rogers. Stamp, \ Mertz, Sparks,
Samis, Pillsbury, Esgen, Linn, Gibbs,
Terman, Carver, Bucklin, Parks, See
ly, Musser, Colglazier, Carlisle,
Thompson, Dinkelspiel, Langford,
Horn. Davis, Wilkie, Mavnard.
The holdover show materialized and
much laughter was produced from the
"perfect" representation of a scene at
a well known watering place in Red
wood. "Canary" Campbell seemed to
have been raised to the part of drink
mixer. Many clever take-offs on prom
inent collegians were given.
The special events brought to light
the reason why Stanford is so often
called the "Farm," as they centered
primarily in chicken races. The first
was won by Eppler, '21, the second
by Cooper, '17, and the third by Covey,
'20. A sack race was also held, and
was won by Crawford, '21.
In one of the most successful Irish
marathons held on the Stanford oval
in recent years, the sophomore team
carried their baton over the line first
Saturday morning, twenty yards to the
good of the freshmen, who in turn
were twenty yards ahead of the sen
ior-junior combination. Many good
times were made, M. T. Maynard's,
:50 1-5, was the best recorded. This
excellent bit of running earned him
the medal for non-varsity men, the
varsity gold medal^ going to H. R. Her
tel, '18, who made third best time, fin
ishing the quarter-mile in 52 1-5 sec
onds.
K. A. Wright, last lap runner for
the freshmen, had the honor of mak
ing the second best time, 52 seconds.
All three of these times were made on
the last lap of the marathon. The
average time for the winning team
was approximately 57 seconds, al
though many of the times were inac
curate.
The 1920 team did not lead until
well on in the marathon, the combined
upperclass team starting out like
world beaters and maintaining a big
lead for the first ten laps. The fresh
man speedsters were second until
Gibbs, '20, passed their runner in a
sensational quarter-mile run; they re
covered second place when Clark
passed the sophomore, who had taken
the baton from Gibbs. The 1920 run
ners soon forged ahead of their fresh
man rivals and went after the upper
division runners. Carver, '20, finally
overtook Bullis, '18, and gave the
sophomores a lead that they not only
held, but increased. With the faster
men running toward the end of the
race, they were .not pressed.
Many times centered around S3 sec
onds, some of the best of them being:
Maynard, '20, 50 1-5; Wright, '21, 52;
H. R. Hertel, '18, 52 1-5; Wilkie, '20,
52 4-5; Davis, '20, 53; F. W. Hertel,
