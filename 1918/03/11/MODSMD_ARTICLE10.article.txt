# Stanford Orators Defeated by U.S.C.
## Locals Take One of Three Votes in Judges' Decision 
### 
Stanford debaters lost to the Uni
versity of Southern California orators
Friday night by a two to one decision
on the question of the conscription of
labor. The Stanford team, composed
of J. E. Simpson, '21, A. G. Westwick,
'19, and W. I. Ames, '18, put up an
excellent brand of oratory and logic,
but lost to a team well versed in all
the tricks and wiles of debating.
The very closeness of the decision,
with one of the three votes awarded to
the Stanford team, speaks well for
the debating ability of the Stanford
team. Past records show that some
of the best teams in the West have
debated with (he Southerners, but
none are known to have returned vic
torious on the Trojan's home grounds.
Simpson was the first speaker for
the Cardinal team. He presented
strong arguments in showing that a
shortage of labor exists throughout
the country. Westwick was the sec
ond Stanford man to speak and
showed that the labor shortage exists
because of the unequal distribution of
labor, and Ames, as third orator,
linked the points together showing
that conscription of labor would rem
edy the two evils at one stroke. Ames
also took the eight-minute rebuttal.
The southern team was clever in
meeting and in evading the arguments
presented by the Stanford debaters,
and convinced the judges of the
strength of its case.
The exact wording of the question
was:
Resolved: That the federal govern
ment should employ the conscription
of labor to insure the necessary out
put of war materials.
