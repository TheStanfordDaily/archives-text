# TOMORROW'S ASSEMBLY
## 
### 
An assembly that no one should miss is that scheduled for the 11
o'clock hour tomorrow. Exceptionally noted speakers, including Governor
W. D. Stephens and Judge Melvin of the Superior Court in San Francisco,
will he on hand to address the students. Charles K. Field, of the Stanford
pioneer class, will he heard with especial interest as one of our own alumni.
These are real men and real speakers and deserve a real Stanford audi
ence. More than that, they will deal with what will perhaps prove to be
the biggest and most real relief work Stanford has yet attempted to ac
complish as a university.
Some readers will remember the first Belgian relief campaign on the
campus and the whole-hearted response it met with. Since that time there
have been an ever-increasing number of campaigns of greater and less im
portance, but the project of a Stanford women's unit for relief work in
France even in some ways outranks the Belgian appeal, for not only is
Stanford supplying the funds in this undertaking, she is also giving the
workers.
Importance of this project is witnessed to by the caliber of the men
who are to back it up at tomorrow morning's assembly. Because of its im
portance, every student should attend the assembly tomorrow and should
be ready to do their full share in sending the Stanford women to France
when the time comes.
