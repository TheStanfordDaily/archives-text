Dr. Jordan's tree was planted with
the words: "The early motto of the
University was 'die luft der frelheit
velit' —may the winds of freedom
blow, and by the same token
we plant this tree, in whose
branches the winds of freedom may
blow to keep in mind that the horses
saved the University, even as the
Romans keep in mind the geese that
saved their city."
