# Stanford "Babes" Annex Two Games
## 1921 Nine Downs Lick and Oakland Highs by Big Scores 
### 
Freshman baseball players retrieved
themselves for all past shortcomings
Saturday afternoon when they added
two games to their credit. The 1921
combination showed good form and
took Lick-Wilmerding High School
down for a 7-1 count in a six inning
scrimmage. Immediately afterward
they crossed bats for nine frames
with Oakland High School and added
an 31-1 victory to their list.
Fairchild and Murphy tossed the
sphere for the babes, with Criss and
Smith completing the batteries. The
Lick lads secured one hit off Fair
child. Murphy likewise held the Oak
land team down to one bingie during
his term in the box, but it secured
three more when a new pitcher was
sent on the mound.
The Oakland game in particular
was a walkaway for the freshmen,
who hit the ball at will and scored on
numerous errors by the "prep" school
lads.
Tighter playing than usual charac
terized the form of the 1921 men,
while they hit as well as could be
expected. Burks secured two two
baggers and a single in five times at
bat.
Coach Scofleld used sixteen men
during the two games in order to get
a line on the freshman prospects for
the first Blue and Gold contest, which
is slated for April 6 at Berkeley.
