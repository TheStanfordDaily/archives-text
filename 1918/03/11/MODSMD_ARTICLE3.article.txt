# MEMORY OF FOUNDERS IS HONORED
## Bishop Hughes Speaks at Impressive Ceremony 
### 
"Loyalty to country and service to
humanity" was the theme that dom
inated the annual Founders' Day serv
ices held last night in the Memorial
Church. The exercises, which com-
I memorated the memories of Senator
and Mrs. Stanford, were attended by
members of the board of trustees, the
academic council, emeritus professors,
the Reserve Officers' Training Corps,
i and other members of the Stanford
i community.
Flags Are Presented.
The Founders' Day address was de
livered by Bishop Edwin Holt Hughes
of Boston, now special preacher at
the Memorial Church. A feature of
the program was the presentation to
the University of two service flags,
one by the women and the other by
the Reserve Officers' Training Corps.
Two other flags of historic signifi
cance were also presented to the Uni
versity by William Mayo Newhall,
president of the board of trustes. One
of these was a French flag, given to
the first Stanford ambulance unit by
the people of the city of Ligny. The
other was the historic flag of the first
1 ambulance unit, which was recently
j brought back to the campus by H. C.
i Blote, ex-'IS.
Professor R. M. Alden of the De-

partment of English, read a poem com
memorating the men who have gone
into the service. Leland W. Cutler,
'95, was also one of the speakers, read
ing the lesson, "Now let us praise
famous men."
Hughes' Address.
"There are four perils of educa
tion against which religious protec
tions may well be offered," said
Bishop Hughes.
"The first of these," he continued,
"is a false self-consciousness. When
this expresses itself in affectations,
the protection is found 111 the sim
plicity and sincerity always empha
sized by true religion. When the self
consciousness expresses itself in a
timorous modesty that becomes
abashed and helpless in the presence
of the very standards of education, and
so hesitates in the pursuits of worthy
tasks because it cannot do them
ideally, the protection is found in the
doctrine of the merciful and patient
God who demands faithfulness rather
than perfection. A modern type of
j this peril was Amiel, professor of
1 philosophy in the University of Gen
leva, who said: 'What might be, spoils
for me, wliat is. What ought to be
consumes me with sadness.' Then I
again he applied this self-conscious
fear to action, and said tremblingly: '

'Because an act is essentially volun
tary, therefore 1 act as little as pos
sible.' This religious spirit simply
could not permit that dreadful waste
of inaction. It recognizes that God
compliments our powers by giving us
the flying goal and by declining to
write the word 'Finis' after any of
our achievements.
"The second peril is that of a cold
criticalness that manifests itself in
social life. The educated man is in a
decided minority, and it is possible to
get for oneself the mood of proud ex
clusiveness until the speech adopts
such phrases as 'the masses,' 'the rank
and file,' and even 'the common herd.'
Carlyle, with all his emphasis on de
mocracy became often the literary
representative of this peril, flaying
sharply classes, nations, fellow-au
thors, and even humanity in general.
Evidently, the only protection against
this peril is the religious obligation of
love. Knowledge without that is al
ways proud and cold. It was this fact
that led St. Paul, himself an educated
man, to write that piercing distinction,
'Knowledge puffeth up, love buildetli
up.' When the head far outruns the
heart on the way to culture, life is
surely moving toward this second
precipice.
"The third peril is the subtle temp
tation to think of education as being
either a substitute for moral charac
ter, or in its higher ranges, as a re
lease from some so-called minor ob
ligations of the moral law. Within
limits Poe and Byron and Burns were
all literary representatives of this
peril. Statistics would show a re
markable freedom from criminality on
the part of the highly educated. Yet
there are not wanting mournful illus
trations of the fact that there is no
necessary connection between intel
lect and morality. Learned men have
been bad, and ignorant men have been
good.
"The learning does not explain the
badness, and the ignorance does not
account for the goodness. But the
conjunction in each case is suggestive.
It shows that the intellectual and
moral achievements of life should go
hand in hand. The nation that has
the least illiteracy among the great
governments of the world is now turn
ing itself into the scourge of man
kind. The head and hand have outrun
the heart. The final protection can
be found nowhere else save in the
love of God and in the love of his
children over all the earth.
"The fourth peril lies in the temp
tation to regard education more as
individual achievement than as a so
cial obligation. The literary repre
sentatives of this heresy have been
many. They talk about 'knowledge
for knowledge's sake.' Kidd and
Wordsworth and Wendell Phillips
have all blamed educated men of dif
ferent times and lands for the'r fail
ure to give themselves passionately
to the solution of the world's trying
problems. The sole protection against
this peril lies in the sense of religious
obligation. A man has no more right
to hoard his intellectual treasures
than he has to hoard his material
treasures. Christianity has no ex
cuses to offer for the intellectual
miser. He falls under the condemna
tion of God and under the condemna
tion of the good men who know God
and know His holy -will for human
life.
"But more and more," Bishop
Hughes concluded, "the note of in
tense moral obligation is dominating
the intellectual life. Men have in their
hearts the great sense of obligation to
God for the service of God's children
everywhere."
In his address of greeting Acting
President C. I). Marx said that the
founders of the University had hand
ed down the ideal of loyalty and the
ideal of service. "Under Senator
%
Stanford. California was saved to the
Union," he said. "Under Senator and
Mrs. Stanford, the University was
founded for service to humanity. Stan
ford spirit means loyalty to country
and service to humanity, and that the
ideals of the senator and his wife
have found concrete expression is
shown by the number of stars on
Stanford's service flag."
It. (). Bullis, '18, on behalf of the
Reserve Officers' Training Corps, and
Miss Margaret Shedd, '20, on behalf
of the women of the University, pre
sented service flags to the keeping of
the board of trustees. "This banner
is a silent tribute from the women of
the University to the men who have
gone into the ranks," said Miss Shedd.
"The women feel that this flag rep
resents the highest idealism which
the war has brought to them. The
undergraduates of the University are
willing to give up the lighter things
of life and take up the burdens im
posed by the war."
There are 1203 stars in Stanford's
service flag, representing only the
men who are actually in uniform.
There are 200 or more men like Her
bert Hoover and Dr. Wilbur, as Miss
Shedd pointed out, who are giving all
their time to the government in the
prosecution of the war, yet who are
not represented on the banner. Seven
golden stars on the service flag indi
cate the number of men who have al
ready made the final sacrifice.
In accepting the two banners, Wil
liam Mayo Newhall, president of the
board of trustees, expressed his pride
has sent its numbers to the country's
service. Mr. Newhall also spoke with
in the manner in which the University
fervor of the Red Cross unit now be
ing organized by Stanford women to
lie sent to France.
A French flag, given to the first
Stanford ambulance unit by the peo
ple of Ligny, in France, was presented
to the University by Mr. Newhall on
behalf of William B. Bourn, to whom
it was sent by the unit. The banner
bears the inscription "Patronage de
Jeunesse Laique de Ligny." The his
toric: American flag belonging to the
first ambulance unit was also present
ed to the University. The history of
this flag, which was the first to be
sent to Europe with the official sanc
tion' of the War Department, was re
lated by Mr. Newhall, from the time
of the flag's dedication in San Fran
cisco last spring to the occasion 011
July 4, 1917, when it was decorated
with the "croix de guerre."
The musical numbers were a fea
ture of the exercises. Miss Edith Har
vey sang "Hear Ye, Israel," from
"Elijah," and "On Mighty Pens," from
"Creation." The anthem, "Happy and
Blest Are They," from"St. Paul," was
sung by the choir.

Bishop Hughes will conduct the
vesper service for the Y. W. C. A. to
morrow afternoon at 4:15 in Memo
rial Church. This will take the place
of the regular meeting at the club
house.
Bishop Hughes will be 011 the cam
pus during the week, and the asso
ciation is especially fortunate to se
cure him for this meeting. The as
sociation is anxious that as many
women as possible attend this meet
ing.
