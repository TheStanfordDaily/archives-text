# MEMORY OF FOUNDERS IS HONORED
## Bishop Hughes Speaks at Impressive Ceremony 
### 
"Loyalty to country and service to
humanity" was the theme that dom
inated the annual Founders' Day serv
ices held last night in the Memorial
Church. The exercises, which com-
I memorated the memories of Senator
and Mrs. Stanford, were attended by
members of the board of trustees, the
academic council, emeritus professors,
the Reserve Officers' Training Corps,
i and other members of the Stanford
i community.
Flags Are Presented.
The Founders' Day address was de
livered by Bishop Edwin Holt Hughes
of Boston, now special preacher at
the Memorial Church. A feature of
the program was the presentation to
the University of two service flags,
one by the women and the other by
the Reserve Officers' Training Corps.
Two other flags of historic signifi
cance were also presented to the Uni
versity by William Mayo Newhall,
president of the board of trustes. One
of these was a French flag, given to
the first Stanford ambulance unit by
the people of the city of Ligny. The
other was the historic flag of the first
1 ambulance unit, which was recently
j brought back to the campus by H. C.
i Blote, ex-'IS.
Professor R. M. Alden of the De-

partment of English, read a poem com
memorating the men who have gone
into the service. Leland W. Cutler,
'95, was also one of the speakers, read
ing the lesson, "Now let us praise
famous men."
Hughes' Address.
"There are four perils of educa
tion against which religious protec
tions may well be offered," said
Bishop Hughes.
"The first of these," he continued,
"is a false self-consciousness. When
this expresses itself in affectations,
the protection is found 111 the sim
plicity and sincerity always empha
sized by true religion. When the self
consciousness expresses itself in a
timorous modesty that becomes
abashed and helpless in the presence
of the very standards of education, and
so hesitates in the pursuits of worthy
tasks because it cannot do them
ideally, the protection is found in the
doctrine of the merciful and patient
God who demands faithfulness rather
than perfection. A modern type of
j this peril was Amiel, professor of
1 philosophy in the University of Gen
leva, who said: 'What might be, spoils
for me, wliat is. What ought to be
consumes me with sadness.' Then I
again he applied this self-conscious
fear to action, and said tremblingly: '

'Because an act is essentially volun
tary, therefore 1 act as little as pos
sible.' This religious spirit simply
could not permit that dreadful waste
of inaction. It recognizes that God
compliments our powers by giving us
the flying goal and by declining to
write the word 'Finis' after any of
our achievements.
"The second peril is that of a cold
criticalness that manifests itself in
social life. The educated man is in a
decided minority, and it is possible to
get for oneself the mood of proud ex
clusiveness until the speech adopts
such phrases as 'the masses,' 'the rank
and file,' and even 'the common herd.'
Carlyle, with all his emphasis on de
mocracy became often the literary
representative of this peril, flaying
sharply classes, nations, fellow-au
thors, and even humanity in general.
Evidently, the only protection against
this peril is the religious obligation of
love. Knowledge without that is al
ways proud and cold. It was this fact
that led St. Paul, himself an educated
man, to write that piercing distinction,
'Knowledge puffeth up, love buildetli
up.' When the head far outruns the
heart on the way to culture, life is
surely moving toward this second
precipice.
"The third peril is the subtle temp
