Stanford varsity and Iiisberg's Pro-1
sidio staged a comedy of errors on
the Cardinal lot last Saturday. After
nine acts, the curtain call announced
eight runs for the visitors, while Stan
ford had none. The game was the
slowest of the year. Although Lifur
pitched a fair game, the Stanford in
fielders with the exception of Doe act
ed like they had never been acquaint
ed with the national pastime. A total
of seven errors were chalked up
against the Cardinal, while the play
| ers were only able to make four
bingles.
Iiisberg's team scored in the first,
when Fusee went to second on an
error by Dickey and then camo in on
a hit by Behne. Then Stanford had a
I chance to count in her half when

Dickey made a triple the first time at
bat, but the next three men could not
bring him in.
The visitors annexed another in the
second, when Harper singled and
came home on two wild pitches. In
the third a bad error by Davis allowed
two more runners to cross the plate
after Terkelson had singled and Smith
had been given a life through an error.
For the next three innings the San
Francisco men were scoreless, but in
the seventh they came back with an
other counter. Risberg was safe at
first on an error by Galloway and then
went to third on another error by the
shortstop. From third the runner
scored on a sacrifice fly to Lilly.
In the eighth Stanford made three
runs for the visiting team on costly
errors and poor pitching.
