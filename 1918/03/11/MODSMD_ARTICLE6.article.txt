"The Bible and Life" is to be the
title of tomorrow night's lecture,
which will be delivered by Bishop Ed
win H. Hughes. In it he will dwell
upon the intimate relation of the
Scriptures to ordinary life, and the
fact that they sprang from life itself.
Experiences of everday existence
should be the test for the use of the
Bible, says Bishop Hughes. "The Bible
and Life" is also the title of a book
published by him in 1913.

opric at San Francisco, but has now

Thursday night he will speak on
"The Bible and Patriotism." Both
lectures will be held in the Little The
ater, and will begfn at 7:30.
