heralded to speak at the special as
sembly to be held tomorrow at 11
o'clock, for the purpose of discussing
the Stanford women's unit for relief

unit will mean to California, and why
Californians should get behind the
movement and support it.

war. Judge Melvin is a graduate of
the University of California and a

"Charley" Field, '95, needs no intro
duction to most Stanford people, and
the mention of his name on a program
is sufficient to attract them. In his
clever, informal way, he will discuss
what a unit of Stanford women work
ers in France will mean to Stanford.
Field is now editor of the Sunset mag
azine, and is a member of Zeta Psi

Samuel J. Brun will lie known to
some Stanfordites as the father of

music will be sprung at the assembly,
when groups of men and women will
sing in chorus from the balcony and
the floor of Assembly Hall.
Following the assembly, the advis
ory board on personnel will entertain
the guests at luncheon in the Stanford
