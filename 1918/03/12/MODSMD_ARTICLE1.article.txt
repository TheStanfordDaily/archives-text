# SENIORS ENTERING SERVICE WILL BE GIVEN FULL CREDIT
## ONE MONTH IS TIME LIMIT Undergraduates To Receive Proportional Credit On Leaving 
### 
Candidates for graduation from the
University in any quarter who are
forced to leave the University because
of enlistment or draft requirements
not earlier than one month before the
end of the quarter will receive full
credit, according to an announcement
made by Registrar O. L. Elliott today.
The work of the candidate at the time
of withdrawal, however, must be of
passing grade.
In the case of other students with
drawing from the University for such
reasons, instructors will be at liberty
to report an amount of final credit
proportional to the work completed
instead of the usual "incomplete."
This applies only to students who
leave not earlier than the middle of
the quarter, and whose work at the
time is of passing grade.
This ruling takes the place of a sim
ilar action passed by the University
authorities last quarter by which all
men leaving for the service not earlier
than one month before the end of the
quarter were given full standing. Un
der the present ruling, which is now
effective, only seniors leaving within
a month before the end of the quar
ter will be given full credit. Other
men will receive credits only in pro
portion to the amount of work com
pleted.
Under this new scheme seniors who
are obliged to leave on account of the
draft, enlistment in the naval reserve
or other military organizations, will
be able to secure their degrees, pro
vided they have passing grades in
their subjects.
