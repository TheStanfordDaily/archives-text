# WEIGHT MEN ARE TO BE COACHED BY RALSTON WILBUR
## WILL START THURSDAY Interclass Meet Is Planned for Saturdayâ€”l920 Men To Choose Leader 
### 
Ralston T. Wilbour, ex-'99, is to de
vote part of his spare time to coach
ing the Stanford weight men for the
track meet with California, accord
ing to announcement made today by
Track Captain A. P. Wilson, '18.
Wilbour was at Stanford last Satur
day afternoon with Pay King, the mo
tion pic ture actress, and the Hearst-
Pathe news service, and spent a few
hours working out with the shot-put
ters and hammer-throwers. Inside of
an hour he had improved Curtice's
hammer throwing about twenty feet,
and showed great knowledge and abil
ity in directing Adams, Curtice, and
Weitzel in the sliol-put.
Wilhour's services are especially
needed to overcome Stanford's pro
verbial weakness in the hammer
throw. as well as to develop material
for the discus and javelin, as It is
almost certain that, according to in
tercollegiate agreement, these events
will count for points in the Stanford-
California meet. Wilbour will com
mence work Thursday, and will be on
hand regularly at least twice a week
thereafter.
Wilbour was a hammer-thrower and
shot-putter of merit during his col
legiate days, and won much fame in
the weight events. He spent some
time at Stanford, but did not finish
his course here. Ho received part of
his university education at Yale,
where he developed into a football
player of renown. Later he coached
the Yale team, when it was in a had j
slump. He just recently returned to j
the memory of Stanfordites by donat-1
ing a handsome trophy for the Stan-1
ford-Olympic Club track meet.
Class teams will compete in the
annual interclass Saturday afternoon,
when a complete meet, will be staged.
Determined opposition will be given
the men in every race, as rivalry is I
running high between the classes. I
Freshman speedsters should show
to advantage Saturday, as they are
fast rounding into shape, and should
give their more experienced rivals a
close tussle for first honors. The
sophomores, fresh from a victory in
the Irish marathon, teem possible win
ners of the class meet, although such
competition is difficult to dope ahead
of time. The senior team is strong,
but does not appear to be a possible
winner. The juniors, represented
mainly by M. J. House, will probably
figure for few more points than House
is able to make.
The freshmen are to elect their
captain after the meet Saturday after
noon, so that he may assist Wilson
with the work of getting the team in
shape for March 30. The varsity men ;
went into training Saturday and are i
observing strict rules now.
