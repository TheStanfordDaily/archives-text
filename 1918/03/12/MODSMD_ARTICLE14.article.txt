# SMOKING ON QUAD
## 
### 
Attention of The Daily Palo Alto has been called to the violation of
that traditon of Stanford traditions which prescribes that there be no
smoking on the Quad. There is some excuse for the chance visitor or
Stranger who happens to pass through ilie arcades and ignorantly lights
up a cigar or pipe. Most of the R. O. T. C. men will remember the instance
of the British captain who smoked while he spoke, right on the platform
of the Little Theater.
But when students actually registered in the University and who un
doubtedly know better, are observed nonchalantly puffing away at cigar
ettes while walking within the Quadrangle arcades it is time attention was
called to the fact that the no-smoking tradition still holds good and will
continue as long as the Quad remains. An amusing incident occurred a
few evenings ago when a couple of violators of this tradition took to their
heels in flight when they saw that a faculty member observed them.
There is no rule laid down by the faculty or by anybody else forbid
ding smoking on the Quad, but only a tradition. A Stanford tradition is a
Stanford tradition and there is no law so binding as the unwritten law
which should cause every real Stanford man to keep precious guard over
these traditions.
It is even reported that at least a portion of the Stanford faculty is not
observing this tradition. An offense of this kind is trebly unpardonable
if committed by a faculty member. Most professors and instructors have
been around the "Farm" longer than have the undergraduates and here is
certainly a place where a good example should be set. Perhaps students
are not the only ones who need to "get on the boat" in this matter.
