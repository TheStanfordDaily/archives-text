# KARLE ENTERTAINS CROWDED HOUSE AT MUSICAL CONCERT
## 
### 
That it isn't necessary to be a for
eign-born artist to gain the appre
ciation of a Peninsula Musical Asso
ciation audience was convincingly
shown by the enthusiasm that marked
the concert given last night in the
Assembly Hall by Theo Karle, tho
young American tenor. Applause that
was heartily bestowed rewarded him
for his good singing, and in turn he
generously recompensed his admirers
with numerous responses to encores.
His program was arranged so that
it gave full opportunity for him to
show the qualities of his voice. Reci
tative and arias, numbers in foreign
languages and finally his last encore
of a negro song took him through a
varied list, and he did them all well â€”
some better than others, of course.
The two arias seemed to show him at
his be.st, especially the Italian
"Cielo e mar" from Ponchielli's "La
Gioconda." "When the Boys Come
Home," because of its patriotic ap
peal and the excellent rendition of
this encore, received most applause.
The last group of songs included a
composition by the pianist, William
Stickles, whoso work at the piano
matched well the young tenor's sing
ing. This brief work, "Expectancy,"
had to be repeated to Batisfy the au
dience.
This concert marked the close of
the sixth season of the association.
