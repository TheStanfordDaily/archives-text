# WAR BOOK BY IAN HAY NOW PLACED IN LIBRARY
## Mexican Situation, Aviation, and Letters, Are Topics for New Books 
### 
Among other timely books placed
on the library shelf for new books
appears "All in It; 'K (1)' Carries
On," by lan Beth Hay, author of "The
First Hundred Thousand" and other
noted war publications. His latest
book gives in vivid detail happenings
"over there" at the front line trenches.
A translation of Francisco Blune's
"The Whole Truth About Mexico," by
Dora Scott, is an explanation of causes
and effects which have recently set
Mexico in revolutionary uproars; it is
published by the Francisco Blune's
Book Company of New York, which
has issued several other books of a
like nature. The present volume bids
fair to straighten out the everlasting
Mexican tangle,
A manual of aviation practice, en
titled "Learning to Fly with the IT. S.
Army" is perhaps the most instructive
timely publication the library has re
cently acquired. It is written by E.
N. Fales, assistant professor of me
chanical engineering and chairman of
aeronautics of the University of Ill
inois. His understanding of the com
plex problem goes far toward making
the reader acquainted with the more
technical side of war aviation.
Two additional volumes of Mark
Twain's "Letters" will be of especial
interest to English students and all
readers of "Tom Sawyer" and the
writer's other books.
"The Insurgent Theater" by Thomas
H. Dickenson is an entertaining justi
fication of the present ''little theaters"
and gives several excellent arguments
in favor of their existence. Better
character acting, a more sincere ex
pression through the medium of minor
plays than is given by many Broad
way stars, is possible through them,
according to Mr. Dickenson.
