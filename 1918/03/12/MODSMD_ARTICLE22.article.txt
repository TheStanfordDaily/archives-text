# CALIFORNIA TO HAVE NO SPRING FOOTBALL
## 
### 
On the advice of Coach "Andy"
| Smith, the University of California
has given up spring football practice
for this season. After Smith's ar
rival from Chicago nearly two weeks
ago, the executive committee passed
on the resolution that spring practice
i be held, but consideration of the pros
j pects since that time led Smith to de
cide that the season could not be car
ried through successfully and to rec
ommend that spring training be dis
continued.
What was most influential in bring
ing about this action was the fact
that even the number of men who
were out for track and baseball was
small, and that this would leave al
most no material ready to take inter
est in football. As there will be no
football work for about six months,
Smith is considering taking up ath
letic instruction work in the army
camps.
