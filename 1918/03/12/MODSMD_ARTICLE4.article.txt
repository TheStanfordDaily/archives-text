# BRIGGS Says Goodbye; Adds That Overseas Chappie Is to Arrive Via Pest House Route
## 
### 
j Overseas via the pest house! That's
the route that the next Chaparral is
going to take. In the Junior Week
number, announcement was made to
the effect that Chappie was to appear
in the guise of an oversea number,
with contributions entirely from for
mer Stanford men now in France.
The editor was to collect the ma
terial and arrange it in book form.
Enter the rub! The material is ar
riving from France, but alas! the
editor, poor Mr. Briggs, is now in the
pest house. What reviewing there is
to be done will either take place via
the phone, or through some substitute
at a prominent sorority house.
Mr. Briggs has the measles, but
poor Chappie has not lost its humor.
True to the proverbial policy of laugh,
the editor stood upon the postoffice
steps, showing his measle-bedabbed
face to the world and blithely an
nouncing that he was a victim of the
dread disease of queeners.
Mr. Briggs laughed as he announced
I this fact, and shook hands with every
body there, but rumor has it that he
was the only one indulging in mirth at
' such close quarters.
