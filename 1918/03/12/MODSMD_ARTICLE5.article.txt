# Bishop Hughes To Lecture Tonight
## 
### 
Bishop Hughes will be heard again
tonight at 7:30 in the Little Theater
on "The Bible and Life." He is sched
uled to deliver two lectures in the
Little Theater this week, the second
one to be on Thursday, with "The
Bible and Patriotism" as its subject.
Tonight Bishop Hughes' main theme
will be the close and intimate rela
tion of the Bible to the occurrences
of ordinary everyday life. He empha
sizes the fact that the Bible sprang
from life, and that the experiences
of life should be the test in using the
Scriptures today.
Bishop Hughes Is now at Stanford
for two Sundays. He delivered the
sermon on Founders' Day, and is
scheduled to preach in Memorial
Church next Sunday as well.
