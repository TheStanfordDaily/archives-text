# WOMEN'S COMMITTEE TO BE REORGANIZED
## 
### 
In order to acquire better attend
ance at meetings and more concen
trated and efficient work, the Women's
War Emergency Committee decided
at its last meeting to reorganize itself.
In place of requiring the attendance
of all members of the sub-committees
under the supervision of the general
committee, only the chairmen and sec
retaries of the sub-committees are to
attend the general meetings in the
future. This move is intended to def
initely place responsibility in the
hands of a few women.
The sub-committees which will be
active next quarter are those in
charge of the Stanford Red Cross
Auxiliary, Red Cross practical work,
French and Belgian relief work, the
proposed women's agricultural unit,
war classes, aid to the Stanford
women's unit for relief work in
France, and publicity. The chairmen
of these committees and tho secreta
ries who will be appointed are to meet
regularly as the Women's War Emer
gency Committee. Each sub-commit
tee will meet at times and places ap
pointed by its chairman.
The next regular meeting of the
general committee will be held on the
first Thursday of the spring quarter,
April 4, at 4:15 p. m. As before, the
meetings will be hold every two
weeks.
