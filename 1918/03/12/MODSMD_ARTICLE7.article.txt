# SPEAKERS URGE SUPPORT OF WOMEN'S WAR WORK
## 
### 
"Others suffer besides the wounded
soldiers on the battlefield," said Judge
Harry Melvin, in appealing to the stu
dent body to back the women's relief
unit this morning in Assembly Hall.
"There are women in France who
have given their sons and husbands
and brothers, and whose hearts are
breaking with suffering. These are
the ones whom Stanford women will
go to help, not only to the comfort of
those, but to the glory of the cause,
and the eternal glory of Stanford Uni
versity." Thus the speaker summed
up the work of Stanford in this un
dertaking.
Women's Work Important.
Judge Melvin believes in woman's
work in this great struggle, and thinks
the part Stanford women will do is a
large share. He also said: "Not
only are the soldiers at the front and
the sailors on deck the ones to take
part in this great struggle. We all
ought to give our time, our care, and
our goods to help war work. This stu
dent body can do wonders. It can

contribute enthusiasm, and I take my
hat off to Stanford for its undergrad
uate enthusiasm. Each one can do
something, and that is to give, and to
tell his neighbor about the work."
Acting President Marx introduced
Charley Field to the assembly, and
in his inimitably clever way Field put
across the true Stanford spirit, and
told why it should get behind this new
movement for relief and back it up.
Charles Field Speaks.
"We should have the right ideal of
service," said the graduate of Stan
ford's pioneer class, '95, "It is typi
fied in every Stanford man in the
service, from Herbert Hoover down.
The all-Stanford team is playing the
biggest game in history. It is fight
ing for the ideal in human relation
ships, and to show that God's idea of
democracy was not 'made in Ger
many.' "
In his characteristic way, Charley
Field pointed to the great need over
there.
"The color of life is red," he said.
"Every Stanford man knows that.
Send some of the color over. The
greatest single work in the war was
done by the Russian women in the
Battalion of Death. Let's send over
this battalion of life!"
"There is a song," the speaker con
cluded, "about somewhere in Franco
there's a lily! Let's send over the
women's unit, and change the song to
'Somewhere in France is the Red
Rose of Stanford Spirit.'"
Needs No Call to Service.
Charley Field brought out the fact
that Stanford needs no call to service,
but said that in all she had done lay
the beginning—the end never comes.
"With each new call we dig in a little
harder, and when the pressure seems
heavy, we go in a little harder. We
are going in hard and send these
women over there!"
Miss Dorothy Egbert told of the
immediate need for relief, as origina
tor of the idea, and likened herself to
the gunner who starts the race. "Now
it is up to the student body to get
into the running and make the affair
a success by supporting it."
Give Once, (Jive Twice.
"Give once, and then give a second
time," Miss Egbert said. "All helped
the men to put the Star-Spangled Ban
ner 'over the top.' Now let all help
to put the women in the fields of
France."
Miss Egbert paid tribute to the
Smith Women's College, which put the
first unit for service in the fields over
there, and who gave Stanford the
opportunity to organize such a unit,
and to profit by its mistakes.
Following the assembly, which was
well attended and enthusiastic, speak

ers were entertained in the Stanford
Union at a luncheon given by the ad
visory board on personnel and the stu
dent executive committee.
Dr. Marx read to the assemblage
the circular letter to alumni appeal
ing for financial support, and also a
letter from a woman gardener in
Stockton offering her services on the
unit, and $1000 and expenses, to show
the spirit with which the work is be
ing taken up.
Tonight at dinner a complete can
vass of the living groups on the cam
pus will bo made. Speakers will give
additional information about the work
and give pledge cards for support. Re
turns from the drive will be published
in tomorrow's Daily Palo Alto.

ford's pioneer class, '95, "It is typi
fied in every Stanford man in the
service, from Herbert Hoover down.
The all-Stanford team is playing the
biggest game in history. It is fight
ing for the ideal in human relation
ships, and to show that God's idea of
democracy was not 'made in Ger
many.' "
In his characteristic way, Charley
Field pointed to the great need over
there.
"The color of life is red," he said.
"Every Stanford man knows that.
Send some of the color over. The
greatest single work in the war was
done by the Russian women in the
Battalion of Death. Let's send over
this battalion of life!"
"There is a song," the speaker con
cluded, "about somewhere in Franco
there's a lily! Let's send over the
women's unit, and change the song to
'Somewhere in France is the Red
Rose of Stanford Spirit.'"
Needs No Call to Service.
Charley Field brought out the fact
that Stanford needs no call to service,
but said that in all she had done lay
the beginning—the end never comes.
"With each new call we dig in a little
harder, and when the pressure seems
heavy, we go in a little harder. We
are going in hard and send these
women over there!"
Miss Dorothy Egbert told of the
immediate need for relief, as origina
tor of the idea, and likened herself to
the gunner who starts the race. "Now
it is up to the student body to get
into the running and make the affair
a success by supporting it."
Give Once, (Jive Twice.
"Give once, and then give a second
time," Miss Egbert said. "All helped
the men to put the Star-Spangled Ban
ner 'over the top.' Now let all help
to put the women in the fields of
France."
Miss Egbert paid tribute to the
Smith Women's College, which put the
first unit for service in the fields over
there, and who gave Stanford the
opportunity to organize such a unit,
and to profit by its mistakes.
Following the assembly, which was
well attended and enthusiastic, speak

ers were entertained in the Stanford
Union at a luncheon given by the ad
visory board on personnel and the stu
dent executive committee.
Dr. Marx read to the assemblage
the circular letter to alumni appeal
ing for financial support, and also a
letter from a woman gardener in
Stockton offering her services on the
unit, and $1000 and expenses, to show
the spirit with which the work is be
ing taken up.
Tonight at dinner a complete can
vass of the living groups on the cam
pus will bo made. Speakers will give
additional information about the work
and give pledge cards for support. Re
turns from the drive will be published
in tomorrow's Daily Palo Alto.
"Others suffer besides the wounded
soldiers on the battlefield," said Judge
Harry Melvin, in appealing to the stu
dent body to back the women's relief
unit this morning in Assembly Hall.
"There are women in France who
have given their sons and husbands
and brothers, and whose hearts are
breaking with suffering. These are
the ones whom Stanford women will
go to help, not only to the comfort of
those, but to the glory of the cause,
and the eternal glory of Stanford Uni
versity." Thus the speaker summed
up the work of Stanford in this un
dertaking.
Women's Work Important.
Judge Melvin believes in woman's
work in this great struggle, and thinks
the part Stanford women will do is a
large share. He also said: "Not
only are the soldiers at the front and
the sailors on deck the ones to take
part in this great struggle. We all
ought to give our time, our care, and
our goods to help war work. This stu
dent body can do wonders. It can

contribute enthusiasm, and I take my
hat off to Stanford for its undergrad
uate enthusiasm. Each one can do
something, and that is to give, and to
tell his neighbor about the work."
Acting President Marx introduced
Charley Field to the assembly, and
in his inimitably clever way Field put
across the true Stanford spirit, and
told why it should get behind this new
movement for relief and back it up.

a success by supporting it."
Give Once, (Jive Twice.
"Give once, and then give a second
time," Miss Egbert said. "All helped
the men to put the Star-Spangled Ban
ner 'over the top.' Now let all help
to put the women in the fields of
France."
Miss Egbert paid tribute to the
Smith Women's College, which put the
first unit for service in the fields over
there, and who gave Stanford the
opportunity to organize such a unit,
and to profit by its mistakes.
Following the assembly, which was
well attended and enthusiastic, speak

ers were entertained in the Stanford
Union at a luncheon given by the ad
visory board on personnel and the stu
dent executive committee.
Dr. Marx read to the assemblage
the circular letter to alumni appeal
ing for financial support, and also a
letter from a woman gardener in
Stockton offering her services on the
unit, and $1000 and expenses, to show
the spirit with which the work is be
ing taken up.
Tonight at dinner a complete can
vass of the living groups on the cam
pus will bo made. Speakers will give
additional information about the work
and give pledge cards for support. Re
turns from the drive will be published
in tomorrow's Daily Palo Alto.
