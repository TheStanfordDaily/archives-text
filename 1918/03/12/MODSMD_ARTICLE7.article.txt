# SPEAKERS URGE SUPPORT OF WOMEN'S WAR WORK

### 
"Others suffer besides the wounded
soldiers on the battlefield," said Judge
Harry Melvin, in appealing to the stu
dent body to back the women's relief
unit this morning in Assembly Hall.
"There are women in France who
have given their sons and husbands
and brothers, and whose hearts are
breaking with suffering. These are
the ones whom Stanford women will
go to help, not only to the comfort of
those, but to the glory of the cause,
and the eternal glory of Stanford Uni
versity." Thus the speaker summed
up the work of Stanford in this un
dertaking.
Women's Work Important.
Judge Melvin believes in woman's
work in this great struggle, and thinks
the part Stanford women will do is a
large share. He also said: "Not
only are the soldiers at the front and
the sailors on deck the ones to take
part in this great struggle. We all
ought to give our time, our care, and
our goods to help war work. This stu
dent body can do wonders. It can

contribute enthusiasm, and I take my
hat off to Stanford for its undergrad
uate enthusiasm. Each one can do
something, and that is to give, and to
tell his neighbor about the work."
Acting President Marx introduced
Charley Field to the assembly, and
in his inimitably clever way Field put
across the true Stanford spirit, and
told why it should get behind this new
movement for relief and back it up.
Charles Field Speaks.
"We should have the right ideal of
service," said the graduate of Stan
ford's pioneer class, '95, "It is typi
fied in every Stanford man in the
service, from Herbert Hoover down.
The all-Stanford team is playing the
biggest game in history. It is fight
ing for the ideal in human relation
ships, and to show that God's idea of
democracy was not 'made in Ger
many.' "
In his characteristic way, Charley
Field pointed to the great need over
there.
