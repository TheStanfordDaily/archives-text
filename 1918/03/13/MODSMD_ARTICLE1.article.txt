# BASEBALL DOPE PUTS VARSITY AND BLUE AND GOLD EVEN
## THREE WEAK PLACES ON NINE, OTHERS STRONG Campbell Leads in Hitting With Team Batting .212. Lifur Going Good 
### H. G. Swendsen, '20 
With the baseball season half-gone
Old Man Dope has begun to sharpen
his pencil and figure the chances for
the Stanford team against the Blue
and Gold. To date each team seems
to have about an even break, both as
to good playing and poor playing.
There are only a handful of veterans
on each club, and from this stand
point no information can be gathered
but the other dope points evenly.
Look Good at Times.
Stanford has shown flashes of base
ball this year that have warmed the
hearts of the few bleacher warmers
that have turned out for the' games,
but at other times their games have
been more along the lines of marble
contests than baseball battles. In
general the majority of the team has
put up a good brand of ball.
Weakness in Infield. .
The greatest weaknesses of the team
are at first, third, and right field.
"Cash" Davis, at the initial sack, has
been hitting the ball well during the
season but he is weak on ground balls
and inside baseball. Dickey, at third,
although a good hitter, is uncertain in
the field and makes costly errors. In
right field, Knox, Howes, and Harvey
have been taking a hand, but none of
these men are able to judge flies with
any consistency and are for this rea
son leaving a big hole in the team.
The rest of the men are going good.
Campbell, behind the bat, is proving
to be a real receiver. He holds his
pitchers down in good shape and has
developed a peg that is a source of
danger to any base runner. In addi
tion he is leading the team in hitting.
Lifur is the only pitcher who is show
ing real stuff, although Briggs and
Harvey are improving. Lifur, who
was the box artist for the freshmen
last year, has come through in good
shape, and should he a source of
strength to the team.
On second, Doe, although he is weak
in hitting, is snaring anything that
comes his way, and is adding a big
measure to the play with his pep.
Galloway at short is a player who
should be a star in the California
series. He handles ground balls like
he was cut out for such a job while his
peg never goes wrong. The left and
center field positions are taken care
of by Wayland and Captain Lilly,
lioth men are fielders of the first
water and are soid hitters in addi
tion. Wayland, although he has
handled a large number of flies, has
come through the season without an
error. In centcr Lilly has repeatedly
brought the bleacherites out of their
shells with beautiful catches.
In comparative scores, Stanford
seems to have a slight advantage over
the 111ue and Gold. The Marines from
San Francisco and Olympic Club are
the two teams that have played both
varsities and while Stanford has
beaten both teams, California has lost
to both.
The team is hitting .212, with Camp
boll leading the club on a .360 aver
age. The remainder of the players
line up as follows, not counting last
Saturday's game: Davis .300, Galloway
.21)0, Wayland .273, Lilly .201, Diekej
.22."), Knox .143, Harvey .132, Howes
.125, Lifur .120, Doc .000, Marris .000,
Masters .000, and Hriggs .000.
Lilly and Campbell are tied for total
bases with ten each. Campbell is
ahead with total bits with nine, while
Galloway has taken the high count in
the stolen base column with five. The
rest of the averages are as follows:
Home runs, Lilly, Lifur; two-base
hits, Galloway, Wayland, Lilly, Camp
bell, Howes; three-base hits, Dickey,
Wayland. In sacrifice hits Doe leads
with seven.
