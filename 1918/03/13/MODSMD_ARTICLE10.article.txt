# Use of Scriptures Is Illustrated by Bishop Hughes

"You cannot show me a man, in no
matter what circumstances, who will
not be able to find a solution for his
troubles in the words of the Scrip
tures. There is no moral crisis in
life which we may pass through which
may not be solved by the Bible." This
was the message of Bishop Edwin Holt
Hughes in his lecture "The Bible and
Life," which he delivered last night
in the Little Theater.
There are three main ways in which
the Bible may be used, according to
Bishop Hughes. One way is like that
of a man who seizes a precious sword
in order to defend himself from the
law, and resist arrest. "Quotations
from the Bible may be used to justify
any sort of crime or violence," said
the speaker. "The Biblical argument
was one of the last props of slavery,
yet the whole drift of Bible teaching
could never get along peacefully with
slavery. The man who pleads the
word of Jesus Christ in defense of the
American saloon has never gotten
within celestial diameters of a true
knowledge of the Son of God. The
devil is represented as quoting the
Bible in a very eloquent and persuas
ive way, and the misguided advocates
of this same devil have been doing
the same thing ever since."
Another way of using the Bible is
comparable to that of a man who
takes up the sword and perfects him
self in swordsmanship without ever
putting his knowledge to a useful pur
pose. Bishop Hughes has small pa
tience with quibbles and hair-splitting
over technical points of the Holy
Book, in place of a sympathetic study
of it.
The correct use of the Bible is like
that of the man who practices with
the sword in order to be able to use
it in a righteous battle. "Whenever
you bring the Bible back to actual
life, you bring it back to usefulness,"
declared the bishop.
The speaker was introduced by
Chancellor Emeritus Jordan, who
highly praised his work as bishop of
California. Bishop Hughes is sched
uled to deliver another lecture Thurs
day night in the Little Theater. The
title of this lecture is to be "The Bible
anil Patriotism."
