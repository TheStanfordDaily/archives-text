Yesterday's announcement from the Registrar's office in regard to the
plan for allowing credit to students who are called out by the draft or who
enlist before the end of a University quarter, seems to be just about the
right basis of action. Seniors who enter the service within a month of
graduation will get their long-worked-for diplomas, and all students leaving
after a quarter is half-completed will get proportionate credit for work
done, always with the necessary proviso that their work is satisfactory.
This is the only fair way in which to solve this problem.
This announcement furnishes a husky ray of hope for the would-be
graduate who expects a draft call next quarter. It should also prevent
any undergraduate dropping out of school because he fears he will be
called out before the term ends and will thus lose all his hours. In cases
where the student has all but completed the quarter there should be no at
tempt at splitting hairs and he should be given complete credit, but except
in such cases proportionate credit is all that can rightfully be expected,
with seniors alone getting all their hours so as to enable them to grad
uate.

A few days ago there was a complaint that somebody had maliciously
torn down signs advertising the Cap and Gown benefit dance. That was
hardly the right thing to do, but criticism for that act should not deter the
various press agents and other afilxers of posters from removing placards
advertising shows and entertainments that have long since been forgotten.
