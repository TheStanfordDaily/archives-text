# Drive Under Way for Women's Unit
## Contributions Begin to Arrive from a Few Living Groups 
### 
Complete reports have only come
in from three or four houses concern
ing the Women's War Unit campaign,
but from present indications the drive
looks as though it will be successful.
Speakers talked at the different
houses last night and the campus is
awakening to the situation.
Miss Dorothy Egbert, '17, who is
the organizer of the unit, left on the
Lark last night for the south, where
she will speak for the purpose of rais
ing funds for the unit. She will ad
dress several meetings in Los Angeles
and vicinity.
Contributions will be received not
only from alumni of Stanford, but
from any one who wants to help save
the lives of the stricken people of Eu
rope. Money should be sent to the
treasurer of the fund, J. E. McDowell.
