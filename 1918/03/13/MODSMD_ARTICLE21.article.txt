## 
### 
A clever cover design, worked out
by P. J. Lernos, curator of the Stan
lord Museum, and a large contents
will characterize the March number
of the Stanford Sequoia, which is to
appear on the Quad early next week
before finals.
The cover change will be some
| thing new for Sequoia, and admits of
a two- or three-color scheme.
P. H. Sloman, '20, who recently re
turned from France, where he served
jas an ambulance driver, contributes
; a vivid article on conditions at the
front for the magazine.
