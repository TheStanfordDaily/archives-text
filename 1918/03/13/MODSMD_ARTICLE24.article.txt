# HOT OFF THE CINDERS
## 
### 
The rainy weather has not exactly
aided the track men in conditioning
themselves, and the freshmen especi
ally have been unfortunate in not
being able to get. out on the track
oftener. Only two and one-half weeks
remain before their meet with Cali
fornia, and so some strenuous work
will be expected of the babes.

The drainage system on the oval
seems to be working effectively judg
ing by the rapidity with which Ihe
track drains off after a rain. With
the exception of the start of the 220
straightaway, a few hours suffices to
put the track in fairly good condition
for a workout.

Chapman is fast rounding into
form, and seems to have some hidden
means of keeping in condition if the
amount of work he is capable of doing
without tiring is any criterion. Last
Saturday he ran two laps for the up
perclass marathon team, both of them
being in the neighborhood of 55 sec
onds, and seemed almost as fresh as
ever after them.

Davis is going to a life-saver for
the varsity, the big question being in
what events to enter him. lie can
earn his place in the pole vault, is
finishing well up in the sprints, and
following on House's heels in the
hurdles. In practice the other day he
demonstrated that he can jump around
21 feet in the broad jump.
* * *
Wilke seems bent upon lowering his
distance, if his quarter-mile time Sat
urday is any indication. He has us
ually been regarded as a half-miler,
but there is a strong possibility that
Wilke will be one of the 440 men on
the relay team.

Captain A. F. Wilson seems to be
destined to run the half-mile this year
in conjunction with some other long
race. There is such a raft of long
distance men out that it probably will
be a task how to distribute them.
