# C. J. RANDAU, EX-'18, FLYING IN ITALY
## Tells Thrilling Experiences When Engine Stops in Mid-Air 
### 
C. J. Randau, ex-'lB, who trained at
the Cornell aviation school and later
entered an aviation school in Italy,
has written an interesting account of
his experiences to Stanford friends.
He is now located at Campo Sud
d'Aviazione, Foggia, Italy. Extracts
from the letter follow:
By the oth of January I had finished
all my altitude, landing, and climbing
tests and was all ready for my "raid,"
which is a cross-country flight in two
parts. The first lap is about 120
miles, after which the raider returns
to camp for "grub," and the second
lap is about eighty miles. The course
is laid out between certain towns and
there are various requirements as to
altitude to be reached and time to be
spent in the air.
On the seventh day I started out
very blithely. About forty-five min
utes later I was out over the ocean at
almost 10,000 feet, when I broke two
connecting rods, the crank-case and
several other more or less essential
parts of the engine. There was a se
ries of low clouds shutting off ray
view of the coast, so all I could do
was to glide back and hope to find a
decent landing place. When I came
down through the clouds, I had plenty
of altitude and was just over the
water's edge. So I kept on coming
inland and was extremely lu' ky in
finding about the only available field
in miles around. The country is very
rough, full of ravines, ditches, cactus
fields, ctc., so you may imagine my
feeling of relief when I set the wheels
on the ground. In landing with a
"dead stick" (motor oil) there is not
an awful lot of choice as to landing
places, sometimes, but the principal
difficulty is that while there is no
personal danger, a forced landing
oftentimes results in a broken land
ing gear. Therefore, I said I was very
lucky in setting the plane on the
ground without a scratch.
Being about six miles from town,
and having to wait for some one to
come along, I didn't get to town until
three or four hours later. From the
little coast town 1 wired to Foggia
for a new engine, then went to dinner.
About 5 in the afternoon the motor
truck arrived with a new engine, one
of the instructors, and several me
chanics.
On the morning of the Bth I went
back to Foggia by tiain, while the in
structor stayed with the machine to
I fly it back when the engine was in
stalled. The next three days were
non-flving days, so I didn't get started
again until the 11th. This time I got
to the same town at about 3000 me
ters, when my motor began running
on four cylinders. Was forced to
make a landing, but being able to pick
and choose, landed in a cow pasture
about a quarter of a mile from town.
With the aid of a naval mechanic I
got the gas pressure pump working,
and after giving him a short ride, I
was on my way.
Of course, about three-fourths of
the town Avas out to see me off, and
it was quite a novel exhibition. Got
back to Foggia too late in the after
noon to start on the second lap that
day, so 1 made the second lap on the
12th. The highest I could reach was
about 13,000 feet, though some of the
boys have gone 15,000. The climbing
depends mostly on the machine and
somewhat on the weather.
Well, at last I am what the Italians
call a Pilota Militaire and sport a
gold eagle on my chest. The only
thrills I have had thus far —that is
to say, the only times I have been
scared while in the ail - —were when I
was landing with the busted engine
and when I almost hit a cow landing
in the cow pasture. Driving the old
"Attaboy" used to be much more ex
citing! While I was all set and
ready to go on my second lap, two
machines collided in the air about
200 yards ahead of me. Luckily they
were close to the ground and only
one was wrecked, one of the boys
getting a broken leg, the other no
injuries at all. But the bad feature
about it for me was that I was given
the signal to start even before the
ambulance rushed out to the wreck.
Didn't know who was hurt or how se
riously.
Now, a little about my trip. Spent
two days in Rome with Hearley, the
United Press man, and with Ruffner
and other friends of the two. Had
a \-ery good time and did considerable
shopping for the boys in camp and
myself. Spent only one day in Na
poliv Visited Pompeii, and several
other of the most interesting show
places. The Bay of Naples at sunset
is among the most beautiful sights in
the world.
Although we were promised first
lieutenancies, wo will get only sec
onds. The boys whom we beat out at
ground school and who finished their
R. M. A. in the states have firsts al
ready and will always be our superior
officers, but nothing can be done. We
hope to be given promotions to firsts
by the time we leave here for the
front. My commission will come
through in about a month, I reckon.

R. M. A. in the states have firsts al

C. J. Randau, ex-'lB, who trained at
the Cornell aviation school and later
entered an aviation school in Italy,
has written an interesting account of
his experiences to Stanford friends.
He is now located at Campo Sud
d'Aviazione, Foggia, Italy. Extracts
from the letter follow:
By the oth of January I had finished
all my altitude, landing, and climbing
tests and was all ready for my "raid,"
which is a cross-country flight in two
parts. The first lap is about 120
miles, after which the raider returns
to camp for "grub," and the second
lap is about eighty miles. The course
is laid out between certain towns and
there are various requirements as to
altitude to be reached and time to be
spent in the air.
On the seventh day I started out
very blithely. About forty-five min
utes later I was out over the ocean at
almost 10,000 feet, when I broke two
connecting rods, the crank-case and
several other more or less essential
parts of the engine. There was a se
ries of low clouds shutting off ray
view of the coast, so all I could do
was to glide back and hope to find a
decent landing place. When I came
down through the clouds, I had plenty
of altitude and was just over the
water's edge. So I kept on coming
inland and was extremely lu' ky in
finding about the only available field
in miles around. The country is very
rough, full of ravines, ditches, cactus
fields, ctc., so you may imagine my
feeling of relief when I set the wheels
on the ground. In landing with a
"dead stick" (motor oil) there is not
an awful lot of choice as to landing
places, sometimes, but the principal
difficulty is that while there is no
personal danger, a forced landing
oftentimes results in a broken land
ing gear. Therefore, I said I was very
lucky in setting the plane on the
ground without a scratch.
Being about six miles from town,
and having to wait for some one to
come along, I didn't get to town until
three or four hours later. From the
little coast town 1 wired to Foggia
for a new engine, then went to dinner.
About 5 in the afternoon the motor
truck arrived with a new engine, one
of the instructors, and several me
chanics.
On the morning of the Bth I went
back to Foggia by tiain, while the in
structor stayed with the machine to
I fly it back when the engine was in
stalled. The next three days were
non-flving days, so I didn't get started
again until the 11th. This time I got
to the same town at about 3000 me
ters, when my motor began running
on four cylinders. Was forced to
make a landing, but being able to pick
and choose, landed in a cow pasture
about a quarter of a mile from town.
With the aid of a naval mechanic I
got the gas pressure pump working,
and after giving him a short ride, I
was on my way.
Of course, about three-fourths of
the town Avas out to see me off, and
it was quite a novel exhibition. Got
back to Foggia too late in the after
noon to start on the second lap that
day, so 1 made the second lap on the
12th. The highest I could reach was
about 13,000 feet, though some of the
boys have gone 15,000. The climbing
depends mostly on the machine and
somewhat on the weather.
Well, at last I am what the Italians
call a Pilota Militaire and sport a
gold eagle on my chest. The only
thrills I have had thus far —that is
to say, the only times I have been
scared while in the ail - —were when I
was landing with the busted engine
and when I almost hit a cow landing
in the cow pasture. Driving the old
"Attaboy" used to be much more ex
citing! While I was all set and
ready to go on my second lap, two
machines collided in the air about
200 yards ahead of me. Luckily they
were close to the ground and only
one was wrecked, one of the boys
getting a broken leg, the other no
injuries at all. But the bad feature
about it for me was that I was given
the signal to start even before the
ambulance rushed out to the wreck.
Didn't know who was hurt or how se
riously.
Now, a little about my trip. Spent
two days in Rome with Hearley, the
United Press man, and with Ruffner
and other friends of the two. Had
a \-ery good time and did considerable
shopping for the boys in camp and
myself. Spent only one day in Na
poliv Visited Pompeii, and several
other of the most interesting show
places. The Bay of Naples at sunset
is among the most beautiful sights in
the world.
Although we were promised first
lieutenancies, wo will get only sec
onds. The boys whom we beat out at
ground school and who finished their
R. M. A. in the states have firsts al

officers, but nothing can be done. We

poliv Visited Pompeii, and several
other of the most interesting show
places. The Bay of Naples at sunset
is among the most beautiful sights in
the world.
Although we were promised first
lieutenancies, wo will get only sec
onds. The boys whom we beat out at
ground school and who finished their
R. M. A. in the states have firsts al
ready and will always be our superior
officers, but nothing can be done. We
hope to be given promotions to firsts
by the time we leave here for the
front. My commission will come
through in about a month, I reckon.
C. J. Randau, ex-'lB, who trained at
the Cornell aviation school and later
entered an aviation school in Italy,
has written an interesting account of
his experiences to Stanford friends.
He is now located at Campo Sud
d'Aviazione, Foggia, Italy. Extracts
from the letter follow:
By the oth of January I had finished
all my altitude, landing, and climbing
tests and was all ready for my "raid,"
which is a cross-country flight in two
parts. The first lap is about 120
miles, after which the raider returns
to camp for "grub," and the second
lap is about eighty miles. The course
is laid out between certain towns and
there are various requirements as to
altitude to be reached and time to be
spent in the air.
On the seventh day I started out
very blithely. About forty-five min
utes later I was out over the ocean at
almost 10,000 feet, when I broke two
connecting rods, the crank-case and
several other more or less essential
parts of the engine. There was a se
ries of low clouds shutting off ray
view of the coast, so all I could do
was to glide back and hope to find a
decent landing place. When I came
down through the clouds, I had plenty
of altitude and was just over the
water's edge. So I kept on coming
inland and was extremely lu' ky in
finding about the only available field
in miles around. The country is very
rough, full of ravines, ditches, cactus
fields, ctc., so you may imagine my
feeling of relief when I set the wheels
on the ground. In landing with a
"dead stick" (motor oil) there is not
an awful lot of choice as to landing
places, sometimes, but the principal
difficulty is that while there is no
personal danger, a forced landing
oftentimes results in a broken land
ing gear. Therefore, I said I was very
lucky in setting the plane on the
ground without a scratch.
Being about six miles from town,
and having to wait for some one to
come along, I didn't get to town until
three or four hours later. From the
little coast town 1 wired to Foggia
for a new engine, then went to dinner.
About 5 in the afternoon the motor
truck arrived with a new engine, one
of the instructors, and several me
chanics.
On the morning of the Bth I went
back to Foggia by tiain, while the in
structor stayed with the machine to
I fly it back when the engine was in
stalled. The next three days were
non-flving days, so I didn't get started
again until the 11th. This time I got
to the same town at about 3000 me
ters, when my motor began running
on four cylinders. Was forced to
make a landing, but being able to pick
and choose, landed in a cow pasture
about a quarter of a mile from town.
With the aid of a naval mechanic I
got the gas pressure pump working,
and after giving him a short ride, I
was on my way.
Of course, about three-fourths of
the town Avas out to see me off, and
it was quite a novel exhibition. Got
back to Foggia too late in the after
noon to start on the second lap that
day, so 1 made the second lap on the
12th. The highest I could reach was
about 13,000 feet, though some of the
boys have gone 15,000. The climbing
depends mostly on the machine and
somewhat on the weather.
Well, at last I am what the Italians
call a Pilota Militaire and sport a
gold eagle on my chest. The only
thrills I have had thus far —that is
to say, the only times I have been
scared while in the ail - —were when I
was landing with the busted engine
and when I almost hit a cow landing
in the cow pasture. Driving the old
"Attaboy" used to be much more ex
citing! While I was all set and
ready to go on my second lap, two
machines collided in the air about
200 yards ahead of me. Luckily they
were close to the ground and only
one was wrecked, one of the boys
getting a broken leg, the other no
injuries at all. But the bad feature
about it for me was that I was given
the signal to start even before the
ambulance rushed out to the wreck.
Didn't know who was hurt or how se
riously.
Now, a little about my trip. Spent
two days in Rome with Hearley, the
United Press man, and with Ruffner
and other friends of the two. Had
a \-ery good time and did considerable
shopping for the boys in camp and
myself. Spent only one day in Na
poliv Visited Pompeii, and several
other of the most interesting show
places. The Bay of Naples at sunset
