# C. J. RANDAU, EX-'18, FLYING IN ITALY
## Tells Thrilling Experiences When Engine Stops in Mid-Air 
### 
C. J. Randau, ex-'lB, who trained at
the Cornell aviation school and later
entered an aviation school in Italy,
has written an interesting account of
his experiences to Stanford friends.
He is now located at Campo Sud
d'Aviazione, Foggia, Italy. Extracts
from the letter follow:
By the oth of January I had finished
all my altitude, landing, and climbing
tests and was all ready for my "raid,"
which is a cross-country flight in two
parts. The first lap is about 120
miles, after which the raider returns
to camp for "grub," and the second
lap is about eighty miles. The course
is laid out between certain towns and
there are various requirements as to
altitude to be reached and time to be
spent in the air.
On the seventh day I started out
very blithely. About forty-five min
utes later I was out over the ocean at
almost 10,000 feet, when I broke two
connecting rods, the crank-case and
several other more or less essential
parts of the engine. There was a se
ries of low clouds shutting off ray
view of the coast, so all I could do
was to glide back and hope to find a
decent landing place. When I came
down through the clouds, I had plenty
of altitude and was just over the
water's edge. So I kept on coming
inland and was extremely lu' ky in
finding about the only available field
in miles around. The country is very
rough, full of ravines, ditches, cactus
fields, ctc., so you may imagine my
feeling of relief when I set the wheels
on the ground. In landing with a
"dead stick" (motor oil) there is not
an awful lot of choice as to landing
places, sometimes, but the principal
difficulty is that while there is no
personal danger, a forced landing
oftentimes results in a broken land
ing gear. Therefore, I said I was very
lucky in setting the plane on the
ground without a scratch.
Being about six miles from town,
and having to wait for some one to
come along, I didn't get to town until
three or four hours later. From the
little coast town 1 wired to Foggia
for a new engine, then went to dinner.
