# TRACK MEN WILL HOLD INTERCLASS MEET SATURDAY
## SOPHOMORES OR BABES DOPED TO WIN Season's First Big Contest to Furnish Thrills in Several Events 
### 
Class rivalry will evidence itself at
the oval Saturday afternoon at 2
o'clock,, in the annual interclass track
meet. Track men have been antici
pating this event as one of the first
tests in a real meet to be held this
year. It will be the first actual com
petition since both the freshman and
varsity teams went into training. The
babes started their hard work almost
three weeks ago, and the varsity went
011 the abstaining list last Saturday.
Little can be known about the prob
able outcome of the meet, although it
seems likely that the contest will lie
between the sophomores and the
freshmen. However, practically every
event promises strong competition, as
there are several squad rivalries to be
settled.
Spectacular Quarter.
The quarter-mile promises to be
spectacular, as Maynard, '20, is show
ing form that threatens doom to Moody
and Gocppert, the heralded Blue and
Gold 440 men. Inaccurate timing
credited him with 50 1-5 seconds last
Saturday, in the Irish Marathon, and
he was not in actual competition at
that. Hertel, 'IS, is showing splendid
varsity form, and hard work is fast
rounding him into shape. Wright, '20,
will likewise be a strong contender
for honors in this race.
Mouse in Sprints.
The sprints have had various win
ners this year, depending each time
on whether House started in the
events. House will probably run the
100 yards and both hurdles Saturday,
which ought to net the juniors fifteen
points. Davis, '20, Dinkelspiel, '20,
YVimberly, *21, and Falk, '21, will
probably lie the other contenders in
the sprints. With both Davis and
House running sprints and hurdles, a
weakness appears in the 220 yards,
which will have to be filled before the
meet with California.
The longer distances promise strong
competition, with Chapman, '18, Mc-
Pherson, '18, Wilson, '18, Wilke, '20,
Teitsworth, '19, Westwick, '19. Horn,
'20, and others distributing themselves
in the events from the 880 to the two
mile.
House, 'l!>, will probably win both
hurdles, with liogers, '21, and Davis,
'20, battling for second and third
place honors.
The field events are uncertain,
witli Weitzel showing the best form
in the shot-put. Curtice is commenc
ing to heave the hammer out around
110 feet, and both men should show
the results of Ralston Wilbur's coach
ing by Saturday. Adams will probably
be the freshmen's best bet in the
weight events. The javelin and discus
will be brought out. for the first time
this year in the meet on Saturday, in
the hopes of developing material to
stack up against California in these
events.

place honors.
The field events are uncertain,
witli Weitzel showing the best form
in the shot-put. Curtice is commenc
ing to heave the hammer out around
110 feet, and both men should show
the results of Ralston Wilbur's coach
ing by Saturday. Adams will probably
be the freshmen's best bet in the
weight events. The javelin and discus
will be brought out. for the first time
this year in the meet on Saturday, in
the hopes of developing material to
stack up against California in these
events.
Class rivalry will evidence itself at
the oval Saturday afternoon at 2
o'clock,, in the annual interclass track
meet. Track men have been antici
pating this event as one of the first
tests in a real meet to be held this
year. It will be the first actual com
petition since both the freshman and
varsity teams went into training. The
babes started their hard work almost
three weeks ago, and the varsity went
011 the abstaining list last Saturday.
Little can be known about the prob
able outcome of the meet, although it
seems likely that the contest will lie
between the sophomores and the
freshmen. However, practically every
event promises strong competition, as
there are several squad rivalries to be
settled.
Spectacular Quarter.
The quarter-mile promises to be
spectacular, as Maynard, '20, is show
ing form that threatens doom to Moody
and Gocppert, the heralded Blue and
Gold 440 men. Inaccurate timing
credited him with 50 1-5 seconds last
Saturday, in the Irish Marathon, and
he was not in actual competition at
that. Hertel, 'IS, is showing splendid
varsity form, and hard work is fast
rounding him into shape. Wright, '20,
will likewise be a strong contender
for honors in this race.
Mouse in Sprints.
The sprints have had various win
ners this year, depending each time
on whether House started in the
events. House will probably run the
100 yards and both hurdles Saturday,
which ought to net the juniors fifteen
points. Davis, '20, Dinkelspiel, '20,
YVimberly, *21, and Falk, '21, will
probably lie the other contenders in
the sprints. With both Davis and
House running sprints and hurdles, a
weakness appears in the 220 yards,
which will have to be filled before the
meet with California.
The longer distances promise strong
competition, with Chapman, '18, Mc-
Pherson, '18, Wilson, '18, Wilke, '20,
Teitsworth, '19, Westwick, '19. Horn,
'20, and others distributing themselves
in the events from the 880 to the two
mile.
House, 'l!>, will probably win both
hurdles, with liogers, '21, and Davis,
'20, battling for second and third
place honors.
