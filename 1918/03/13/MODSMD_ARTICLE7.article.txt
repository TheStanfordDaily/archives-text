# TRACK MEN WILL HOLD INTERCLASS MEET SATURDAY
## SOPHOMORES OR BABES DOPED TO WIN Season's First Big Contest to Furnish Thrills in Several Events

varsity teams went into training. The
babes started their hard work almost

seems likely that the contest will lie
between the sophomores and the
freshmen. However, practically every
event promises strong competition, as
there are several squad rivalries to be
settled.
Spectacular Quarter.

that. Hertel, 'IS, is showing splendid
varsity form, and hard work is fast
rounding him into shape. Wright, '20,
will likewise be a strong contender
for honors in this race.
