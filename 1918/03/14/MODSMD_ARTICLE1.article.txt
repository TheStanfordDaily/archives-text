### 
Stanford freshman tracksters
scored a win over the San Jose High
School team 43 to 25 yesterday after
noon, in a meet arranged at the late
hour by Graduate Manager O. M. Sul
livan. The freshmen showed good
form in many of the events and were
too much for their high school rivals.
After three false starts, "VVimberly
won the 100-yard dash in 10 2-5 sec
onds, with Falk close on his heels.
Neither of these two ran the 220 and
the 1921 men could get no better than
a third in this event. Wright won
the 440 in 54 4-5 seconds, with Hertel
finishing strong behind him.
Thrash showed good form in the
half-mile, and won the event easily,
not being pressed enough to make his
best time. Rogers won the shortened
low hurdles event in 13 4-5 seconds,
took second in tlie broad jump and
tied with Howell of San Jose for first
in the high jump. Wimberly won
the broad jump, with a leap well over
twenty feet. Adams heaved the shot
almost thirty-five feet, which was
enough to win the event from the
prep school shot-lieavers.
