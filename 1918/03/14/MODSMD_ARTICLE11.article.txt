# MEET SATURDAY WILL DECIDE MAKEUP OF TENNIS TEAMS
## BABES PLAY MARCH 29 Fish Showing Phenomenal Formâ€”Team's Chances Declared Good 
### 
Saturday's novice tennis meet will
determine the freshman team which,
is to oppose the California babes in
two weeks, and furnish a good line
on the varsity which will meet the
Blue and Gold racket men April 19.
It is to be the last meet of this kind
before the big game, and will be
played on Encina courts at 9 o'clock.
The meet will be run in two divis
ions, one for the freshmen, and one
for the varsity contenders. Captain
W. V. Burrill, Jr., '20, states that
there are still chances for men who
come out now, as the turnout this
year has so far been unusually small.
Tennis dopesters say that the Card
inal freshmen should be able to tri
umph over their Berkeley opponents,
as the 1921 men have been going well
on the few occasions when the weather
has permitted practice. L. S. Fish in
particular is showing unusual ability.
He plays a very consistent game and
can always bo depended upon to come
through with the goods. F. S. Turner
and D. R. Fairchild are also proving
themselves expert racket v/ielders,
and should make places on the fresh
man team.
The California first-year men have
had a larger turnout than the locals,
and their squad includes one or two
excellent players, but man for man
the Stanford freshmen are doped to
have the edge on them. The meet
will be played Friday, March 29, at
Berkeley.
The varsity is still an unknown
quantity, for the men have hardly
gotten started yet. On the one occas
ion when the whole squad was at

work first class playing was exhib
ited, and as far as can be determined
tbis early in the season, the varsity
will compare favorably with that of
former years. Stanford is handicap
pnd by the fact that none of her vet
erans are back at college, but the
same thing is also true of California,
A. C. Devlin, '20, C. C. Crosby, '19,
and H. H. Hoss, '18, are showing up
well in the preliminary practice, and
should form the nucleus for the 191S
varsity.
