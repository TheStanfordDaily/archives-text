# WHERE ARE THE TRACK MEN
## 
### 
At the first.of the season a pleasingly large number of men signed up for
track, but now it looks as if the rain Ijad scared most of them away. Only
a small portion of the men who signed up are reporting with any regularity,
and with the interclass meet this coming Saturday and the big meet with
California only a few weeks off Stanford's chances for victory can be de
cided by the students themselves. As far as stars go, right now Stanford
has the edge, but always with the danger that these self-same stars may be
in one of Uncle Sam's uniforms before the meet actually occurs. A bunch of
second and third place men, understudies to the stars, are needed. They are
needed badly and right away. The same is to be said in regard to the fresh
man team. It looUs as if ideal cinderpath weather were coming to stay before
long. How about a lot more runners on the track from now on?
Especially discouraging is it to those who are interested in the success
of our track team to know that there are real stars of the most stellar kind
in the University who are eligible for places on the varsity, but who for one
reason or another offer excuses and do not get out and train. That is never
the true Stanford spirit and this year more than before such men should
feel it their duty to get into spikes and warm up. There is little time left,
hence the "warming up" ought to start right away.
Perhaps one reason for the lack of interest in track lies in the fact that
there have been no outside meets held as yet. This has been more than
unfortunate, as real competition is needed to get the Cardinal athletes in
trim to meet the Blue and Gold. It isn't too late yet to get busy and sched
ule some real meets.
