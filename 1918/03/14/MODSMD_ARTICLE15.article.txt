# BLOCK "S" HONORS
## 
### 
Block "S" emblems were awarded basketball men who played in two or
more of the intercollegiate games with the University of California by the
executive committee last week. Since that time there has been criticism of
this action from certain sources, "tradition" having been violated, according
to these critics, who believe men who played in only one game should also
be given emblems. This is only the second year that the block "S" has been
awarded in basketball, so there can hardly be any tradition of very long
standing that has been broken in this matter,
tn Rugby there have rarely been more than three substitutes who have
received "S" sweaters in addition to the fifteen varsity men who play in the
one "big game" of the season. Only point winner* against California get the
track emblpm. In baseball substitutes are usually in ratio of two to nine.
But in basketball there has always been a tendency towards disproportion.
There have been about as many substitutes as regular men used sometimes.
It hardly seems right to award the emblem to some player who gets in for
only a few moments of one out of three games. Occasionally a man who
really deserves the "S" would lose out if the precedent established by "Ex
committee is adhered to, but the line has to be drawn somewhere.
There have rarely been instances of disproportionate use of substitutes
or pinch-hitters in baseball, but the same principle might be applied even to
this more important sport. We believe it right that varsity "S should go
only to players who compete in at least two games of the final series, regard
less of which major sport they compete in.
The block "S" is about the highest honor the student body can give the
athlete and for this reason it should be kept a real honor and not cheapened
by being made too easy to acquire.
