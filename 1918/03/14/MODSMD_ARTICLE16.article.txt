# "WIN THE WAR" DAY
## 
### 
On the first annivereay of the entrance of America into the world war,
April G, a national "Win the War" Day is to be held all over the United
States under the direction of the national committee of patriotic societies.
Universities and colleges throughout the country have been asked to partici
pate in the national celebration of this day in the most fitting manner pos
sible. Special exercises, including a parade by the R. O. T. C., would consti
tute appropriate exercises for Stanford. The thing to do now is for the Uni
versity authorities to get busy and appoint someone to take the matter in
charge and prepare for a suitable observance of the day. Perhaps the Stan
ford band might be prevailed on to play for the occasion, or if it is too timid,
a regimental band from Camp Fremont might be obtained.
No more suitable time than the beginning of the second year of war
could be found to show in a united way that the students of Stanford are
back of those who have responded to the call to the colors. This is one way
to prove the loyalty of those of us who are still in the University. The na
tion, as a unit, will reconsecrate itself to the war task ahead on April 6, and
Stanford should now tegin to plan to play its part in observing Win the
War" Day appropriately.
