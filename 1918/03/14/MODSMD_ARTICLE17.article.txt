Editor Daily Palo Alto:
As one interested primarily in fair
ness and secondarily in newspaper
work, I regret the outcome of yester
day's election —not because the one
elected editor may not be entirely
competent, nor because of any per
sonal reason whatsoever. The per
son chosen by majority vote may
prove to be an excellent newspaper
man, although he has never been on
the editorial staff of the Daily Palo
Alto or taken part in other journalis
tic work here.
My regrets are, briefly: First, be
cause earnest, hard work on the paper
and merit seem no longer to count,
as in the past as I understand it; sec
ondly, because personal prejudices ap
pear to have risen above the common
welfare.
Undergraduate newspaper men have
gone away to war heroically against
an insidious enemy; the women come
forward and labor with intense zeal—
and their work is just as high grade
as that of the men—to keep the Daily
up to its previous standard. These
women start in at the bottom and
work up, advancing step by step
through faithful and efficient efforts,
until they are fitted to assume the
chief responsibility and are entitled
to that reward. Presto! a man who
never has served on the editorial staff
is given the reward. "Why work for
such gratitude?" is the natural ques
tion.
"Honor to whom honor is due" has
been the old-time expression of fair
play. Now it seems that it has be
come a lost tradition.
Women's place, it would seem like
wise from the outcome of tiie voting,
is to stay in the kitchen and wash the
dishes, as it were. Precedent says so,
and precedent must be rigidly upheld.
Furthermore, precedent says a junior
must heed its mandates. Yet, prece
dent has nothing whatever to do with
the election, as never before, of an j
entire outsider as editor-in-chief! The I
decree seems to be that women may I
be reporters, news editors and man
aging editors but under no circum
stances editors-in-chief. "That doesn't
suit us personally, and what doesn't
suit us personally doesn't go," might
express it differently.
Is such an attitude —the failure to
reward merit and the placing of per
sonal prejudices paramount to the
common good—the heralded "Stan
ford spirit"? Or has all the "Stanford
spirit" been taken away by the "boys"
in France, in the Balkans, at Wash
ington, Camp Lewis, Camp Fremont,
and elsewhere?
Doesn't it seem, Mr. Editor, that the
regulations governing the choosing of
the editor of the Daily need amend
ing somewhat?
