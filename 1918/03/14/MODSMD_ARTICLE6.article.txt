# DEBATERS PREPARE FOR COMING JOFFRE CONTEST
## TWO VETERANS ON TEAM Californians May Furnish Cardinals Strong Competition 
### 
Stanford debaters have commenced
tlieir preliminary training for the
Joffre debate, which is scheduled for
Harmon gymnasium, Berkeley, on
April 19. Intensive preparations have
not been begun by the debaters yet,
but they are thoroughly searching for
evidence on the question.
The general subject is bureauc
racy in France. As was the custom in
the former Carnot debates, which the
Joffre debate has replaced, the spe
cific question will not be announced
until a few hours before the contest.
The Stanford team consists of one
half veterans and is composed of M.
L. McClintock, '18, J. G. Driscoll, '18,
W. F. Lciser, '21, and B. F. Davis,
'20, one of whom is soon to be named
as alternate. McClintock has distin
guished himself in past debating con
tests as a member of the Tri-state,
Intercollegiate and Carnot teams.
Driscoll is well known for his elo
quence on these three teams. Davis
and Leiser are new to Stanford de
bating but have earned their places
by hard work and ability.
Although indications point to a
strong possibility of the first winner
of the Joffre medal being a Stanford
man, the Cardinal oratora will have
strong competition from their Berke
ley rivals. J. J. Posner, '19, and W.
M. Green, '19, were debaters on the
last team that fought Stanford in the
no-decision debate on the subject of
conscription of labor. Miss Mildred
Little, '19. is alternate on the Cali
fornia team, and was likewise a mem
ber of the intercollegiate trio. Miss
Irene Miller, '20, is the third member
of the Blue and Gold Joffre team, and
is touted as a speaker of unusual elo
quence.
