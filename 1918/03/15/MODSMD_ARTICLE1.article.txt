# STANFORD AND SANTA CLARA NINES TO CROSS BATS
## SECOND GAME OF SERIES COMES TOMORROW Freshman Teams to Combat on Mission Field at Same Time 
### 
Stanford and Santa Clara varsity
nines will cross bats tomorrow on the
varsity lot in their second game of
the season. The Cardinal men have
been showing marked improvement
in the last few work-outs and hope to
even up the series with the Red and
White team in tomorrow's game.
Santa Clara won the first game of
the series by a sensational ninth in
ning rally and the men from down
the valley hope to score another vic
tory tomorrow and tie up the series.
At the same time the varsities are
playing here the freshman nine will
journey down to Santa Clara to en 1
gage the Missionites on their own
diamond.
Lifur will toss the sphere in tomor
row's contest with Campbell acting af
the receiving position. Li fur's brand
of ball lias been improving steadily
the last few games and lie will prob
ably be good for the entire game. In
case it is necessary to send in another j
hurler Harvey will be able to dem-j
onatrate a new style of pitching to i
the Mission team.
With Davis, Galloway, and Camp- j
bell hitting around the .300 mark the :
Cardinal men will undoubtedly make I
the Santa Clara hurler work to hold j
his position in the box. The entire
varsities' average is not a bad one
when the strength of the pitchers
tliey have had to face is considered.
