# INTERCLASS TRACK MEN HOLD BIG MEET TOMORROW
## PROSPECTS BRIGHT FOR GOOD CONTEST Men Are In Fine Condition and Fast Competition Is Looked For 
### 
liiterclass track activities will start
tomorrow at 1:30 o'clock on the oval,
with a big list of entries expected to
line up for each event. The interclass,
which is an annual affair, will bring
the track season to its height and
marks the end of shortened competi
tion and preliminary meets.
The weather promises to be ideal,
with tlie track in excellent shape, as
it is to be rolled tonight, having be
come too soft since the recent rain.
Tast times are almost certain, as there
is much pent-up enthusiasm in sev
' ral ol the events, and some squad
"grudges" to settle. As additional in
cc ntive, point makers in the intcr
class are to be awarded numerals, as
in the past.
Trainer R. T. I-laig announces that
practically all of the men are in good
condition, despite the difficulties of
training during the rainy season.
i plints and pulled muscles are
i t abundant, because of the light,
done so far. Scofield oi tho
! i l is about the only man out
responsible for his inability to com
. Westwick, long distance runner,
. il probably compete actively for
first time this year, as he has been
form and with more consistent prac
tice should develop into a possible
point winner.
Wright and I-lertel are the most like
ly candidates in the quarter, both
men showing excellent form this year.
Wright is probably the better of the
two. Scoiield's absence in this event
will be felt as he showed great prom
ise as a quarter-miler.
Thrash is a strong contender in the
half-mile, is a hard worker and will
probably be able to reduce his time
to close to two miuutes for the 880.
Sharp is another half-miler who
works hard, and who will probably
either start the half or some longer
event. liergerot might likewise be
entered.
Stolz, Clark, Sharp, and Cowell are
the long distance men who must take
care of the mile and two-mile be
tween them. Stolz is showing good
form in the longer event and .Clark
runs nicely in the mile.
The hurdles should not bother the
Cardinal score-sheet, since Rogers
seems capable of adding ten points in
these events. He lias been rounding
into good form, and ought to come
through in the meet. Swanholm,
King, and Reynolds will probably back
him up.
Rogers is likewise counted on to
figure in the broad and high jumps,
although Wimberly, Fablinger, and
Armstrong in the broad, and Whitte
more in the high will all be strong
contenders.
Adams is the only hope developed
so far in the weight events, and he
is one of the football men who may
not be permitted to compete. His
work has been of varsity caliber so
far. Green looks like the winner in
the pole vault, as he can vault over 12
feet, which is sufficient for victory in
most intercollegiate meets.
The javelin and discus events are
to be added this year, and some men
must be developed to score the neces
sary points. Green can throw the dis
cus close on to 115 feet, and should
be able to score heavily in this event
for the Cardinal. No captah has
been elected bj the 1921 men as yet,
and their skipper is to be chosen after
the interclass tomorrow morning. He
will aid Wilson in training the men
and filling the gaps on the team.

class are to be awarded numerals, as
in the past.
Trainer R. T. I-laig announces that
practically all of the men are in good
condition, despite the difficulties of
training during the rainy season.
i plints and pulled muscles are
i t abundant, because of the light,
done so far. Scofield oi tho
! i l is about the only man out
responsible for his inability to com
. Westwick, long distance runner,
. il probably compete actively for
first time this year, as he has been
form and with more consistent prac
tice should develop into a possible
point winner.
Wright and I-lertel are the most like
ly candidates in the quarter, both
men showing excellent form this year.
Wright is probably the better of the
two. Scoiield's absence in this event
will be felt as he showed great prom
ise as a quarter-miler.
Thrash is a strong contender in the
half-mile, is a hard worker and will
probably be able to reduce his time
to close to two miuutes for the 880.
Sharp is another half-miler who
works hard, and who will probably
either start the half or some longer
event. liergerot might likewise be
entered.
Stolz, Clark, Sharp, and Cowell are
the long distance men who must take
care of the mile and two-mile be
tween them. Stolz is showing good
form in the longer event and .Clark
runs nicely in the mile.
The hurdles should not bother the
Cardinal score-sheet, since Rogers
seems capable of adding ten points in
these events. He lias been rounding
into good form, and ought to come
through in the meet. Swanholm,
King, and Reynolds will probably back
him up.
Rogers is likewise counted on to
figure in the broad and high jumps,
although Wimberly, Fablinger, and
Armstrong in the broad, and Whitte
more in the high will all be strong
contenders.
Adams is the only hope developed
so far in the weight events, and he
is one of the football men who may
not be permitted to compete. His
work has been of varsity caliber so
far. Green looks like the winner in
the pole vault, as he can vault over 12
feet, which is sufficient for victory in
most intercollegiate meets.
The javelin and discus events are
to be added this year, and some men
must be developed to score the neces
sary points. Green can throw the dis
cus close on to 115 feet, and should
be able to score heavily in this event
for the Cardinal. No captah has
been elected bj the 1921 men as yet,
and their skipper is to be chosen after
the interclass tomorrow morning. He
will aid Wilson in training the men
and filling the gaps on the team.
liiterclass track activities will start
tomorrow at 1:30 o'clock on the oval,
with a big list of entries expected to
line up for each event. The interclass,
which is an annual affair, will bring
the track season to its height and
marks the end of shortened competi
tion and preliminary meets.
The weather promises to be ideal,
with tlie track in excellent shape, as
it is to be rolled tonight, having be
come too soft since the recent rain.
Tast times are almost certain, as there
is much pent-up enthusiasm in sev
' ral ol the events, and some squad
"grudges" to settle. As additional in
