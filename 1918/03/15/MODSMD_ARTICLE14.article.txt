# Varsity Plays Tie With Fremont Nine
## Team Deserves to Win Contest on Decision of Umpire. Harvey Goes Good 
### 
Stanford and Field Hospital 31 of
Camp Fremont played a tie game on
the Cardinal field last night, accord
ing to the umpire, though as a matter
of fact the varsity won 3 to 2. The
official score read 2 to 2 when the
game was called on account of dark
ness in the seventh, after Galloway
had won the battle unofficially by a
single to left field which the umpire
called foul.
Stanford's team looked hotter in
last night's game than they have for
some time. Nine hits were gleaned
off the Fremont heaver while the team
as a whole played a good game. Gal
loway, after his short slump in the
last two games, came hack stronger
than ever with a perfect batting and
fielding average. Lilly hit out a double
and a single, Campbell alro socored
his usual two hit.-; ard nailed every
man who tried to steal o • him, while
Dickey at third pulled off several
pretty stops on ground balls.
Stanford scored first in the second
inning on bits by Campbell and Gallo
way, and the varsity countcd again in
the fifth when Lilly and Galloway
each registered two-baggers.
The soldiers scored all their runs
in the. seventh inning. Straub was
safe on Lifur's er.or, went to third
on a wild pitch, and camc in on
Lifur's second boot. Dobbins was
safe at first on an < rror, went to third
on a hit, and scoj ed on a fielder's
choice.
Harvey pitched good ball while he
was in the box, although he was in
trouble once or twice when he walked
men. He allowed no hits or runs,
however. Lifur, when he went into
the box, loafed them over in easy
style and allowed the soldiers a chance
to score.
