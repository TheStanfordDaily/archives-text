# IN CONCLUSION

### 
TLanks to the new quarter system the term of an editor passes more
quickly than in former years. It seems but a few days since Number 1 of
Volume 52 of The Daily Palo Alto came off the press, and now the forms
of the last issue are ready to be locked up. During the greater part of the
quarter there have been few questions of vital importance to decide and
the Daily lias had a more or less peaceful existence.
There is a little card posted on the bulletin board in the office of The
Daily Palo Alto, a quotation from a speech made by Abraham Lincoln at
the close of his first term as president, which reads: "I have never had a
policy, I have simply tried to do what seemed best each day as each day
came." And this has been our aim. The Daily has had no fixed policy; we
have merely tried to do what we believed right and say what be believe
was right each day as each day came. Mistakes may have been commit
ted, but we have done our best to adhere to the "declaration of independ
ence" made in the opening number of the quarter.
And now a few words of much deserved appreciation for the work of
the staff. Few individuals of the student body not in close touch with the
situation have any idea as to the amount of work it takes to put out a
good daily paper. It is the hard and unselfish work of the members of
the staff, who frequently sacrifice university work and personal desires to
the needs of the paper, which makes possible the publication at Stanford
of a daily that the members of the Associated Students can be proud of as
one of the best university papers in the country. Most of the staff mem
bers stay with the Daily through their university careers and putin from
three to four years of hard work on his college activity. Football and other
athletic seasons have their end but the Daily goes on throughout the college
year. Ry this training and through this work they come to know all about
getting out the paper in good shape. They are the persons best fitted, in
fact they are the only people fitted to judge who would make the best ed
itor from quarter to quarter. They are the people who know who has by
hard work and merit earned the right and is best qualified to become
editor-in-chief.
Therefore, in addition to thanking them for their efficient and truly
tirrless help during the past quarter, we wish to go on record as advocating
election of the editor-in-chief of The Daily Paio Alto by ilie staff from now
on. During the remainder of the war, and perhaps a year after its con
clusion, there should be a reversal to the old plan of two editors a year,
or suitable material for editors will soon run out. Amendments to the A.
S. S. U. constitution are needed in regard to both these matters.
This being the final issue of the winter quarter, the staff will have a
few days to prepare for the dreaded finals, and neither its members nor the
students at large need much advice to get in and dig for finals, for the
four-quarter plan keeps everybody digging pretty nearly all of the time as
it is. There will be few enough of us back next quarter without anybody
flunking out.
And so ends Volume 52 of The Daily Palo Alto.

tirrless help during the past quarter, we wish to go on record as advocating
election of the editor-in-chief of The Daily Paio Alto by ilie staff from now
on. During the remainder of the war, and perhaps a year after its con
clusion, there should be a reversal to the old plan of two editors a year,
or suitable material for editors will soon run out. Amendments to the A.
S. S. U. constitution are needed in regard to both these matters.
This being the final issue of the winter quarter, the staff will have a
few days to prepare for the dreaded finals, and neither its members nor the
students at large need much advice to get in and dig for finals, for the
four-quarter plan keeps everybody digging pretty nearly all of the time as
it is. There will be few enough of us back next quarter without anybody
flunking out.
And so ends Volume 52 of The Daily Palo Alto.
TLanks to the new quarter system the term of an editor passes more
quickly than in former years. It seems but a few days since Number 1 of
Volume 52 of The Daily Palo Alto came off the press, and now the forms
of the last issue are ready to be locked up. During the greater part of the
quarter there have been few questions of vital importance to decide and
the Daily lias had a more or less peaceful existence.
There is a little card posted on the bulletin board in the office of The
Daily Palo Alto, a quotation from a speech made by Abraham Lincoln at
the close of his first term as president, which reads: "I have never had a
policy, I have simply tried to do what seemed best each day as each day
came." And this has been our aim. The Daily has had no fixed policy; we
have merely tried to do what we believed right and say what be believe
was right each day as each day came. Mistakes may have been commit
ted, but we have done our best to adhere to the "declaration of independ
ence" made in the opening number of the quarter.
And now a few words of much deserved appreciation for the work of
the staff. Few individuals of the student body not in close touch with the
situation have any idea as to the amount of work it takes to put out a
good daily paper. It is the hard and unselfish work of the members of
the staff, who frequently sacrifice university work and personal desires to
the needs of the paper, which makes possible the publication at Stanford
of a daily that the members of the Associated Students can be proud of as
one of the best university papers in the country. Most of the staff mem
bers stay with the Daily through their university careers and putin from
three to four years of hard work on his college activity. Football and other
athletic seasons have their end but the Daily goes on throughout the college
year. Ry this training and through this work they come to know all about
getting out the paper in good shape. They are the persons best fitted, in
fact they are the only people fitted to judge who would make the best ed
itor from quarter to quarter. They are the people who know who has by
hard work and merit earned the right and is best qualified to become
editor-in-chief.
Therefore, in addition to thanking them for their efficient and truly
tirrless help during the past quarter, we wish to go on record as advocating
election of the editor-in-chief of The Daily Paio Alto by ilie staff from now
on. During the remainder of the war, and perhaps a year after its con
