# ONE WEEK IS ADDED TO AVIATION COURSE
## 
### 
A new system of training is being
tried by the School of Military Aero
nautics at Berkeley which is expectcd
to relieve the terrible strain under
gone by the men in the eight weeks
of concentrated study now required.
The plan is to extend the training an
other week and have that week de
voted to light duties such as officer
of the day and police duty.
A squadron is being formed to em
brace all these duties. Practically 110
new instruction is planned for this
squadron, the idea being that a let
down is necessary to the men for the
more strenuous task of flying. Some
of the guard work now being done by
a detail from B squadron is to be
shifted to this squadron, as B squad
ron is now composed of men who
have completed but a single week of
training.
Captain Crance at the Berkeley
school thought out the idea and had
it. approved by the chief signal officer,
General Squier. If it is successful it
will be adopted by the other ground
schools over the country.
