# 1921 Cinder Men Will Meet U.C.
## War Depletes Ranks of Track Artists in Both Colleges 
### 
Cy the time the annual interclass
rolls around, track conditions are
usually definitely determined and a
line on the relative merits and ability
of the men can be had. But this year,
of all years, it is exceptionally dif
ficult to play the part of dopester
and figure out results with any pos
sible chance of success. Meets have
been scarce, because competition is
scarce, and dope likewise for that
reason.
Prospects are not too encouraging
for a victory over the Blue and Gold
babes, but real work from now until
the end of the season will make a
Cardinal victory extremely possible.
Hotli California and Stanford will
show the results of the war's depre
dations in the ranks of college ath
letes, the important point being which
university can put out the best team
under war conditions.

against Santa Clara last fall on the

The sophomores are entering a

The juniors will count on House's
ability to score enough points to place

Cy the time the annual interclass
rolls around, track conditions are
usually definitely determined and a
line on the relative merits and ability
of the men can be had. But this year,
of all years, it is exceptionally dif
ficult to play the part of dopester
and figure out results with any pos
sible chance of success. Meets have
been scarce, because competition is
scarce, and dope likewise for that
reason.
Prospects are not too encouraging
for a victory over the Blue and Gold
babes, but real work from now until
the end of the season will make a
Cardinal victory extremely possible.
Hotli California and Stanford will
show the results of the war's depre

university can put out the best team
under war conditions.
