# Patriotism Topic of Bishop Hughes
## Relation of Bible to Love of Country Explained by Church Leader 
### 
"Genuine patriotism is not incom
patible with genuine cosmopolitanism
and with the true religious spirit. On
the contrary, patriotism is one of the
important Biblical virtues. An ardent
patriot can read the Bible from cover
to cover and end with a larger and
greater love for his country." This
was the gist of Bishop Hughes' lec
ture last night in the Little Theater
on "The Bible ar.d Patriotism."
"There are four types of patriotism
exemplified in the Bible," he said,
"that of the psalmist., that of the pro
phot, that of the apostles, and that of
the Savior. The first of these, that of
the psalmist, is instinctive, ecstatic,
illogical; it springs from the heart.
It is a part of the makeup of every
normal man."
The prophet's typo of patriotism,
according to Bishop Hughes, is the
militant kind, which unmercifully
(lays the faults of the nation. Al
though it is very valuable, it may
easily be overdone. The apostles' at
titude is comparable to that of many
of us today. Wo complacently accept
the great benefits of our government
as a matter of course, without real
izing how much we owe to that gov
ernment.
