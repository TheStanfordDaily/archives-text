# Varsity and 1921 Mermen to Clash With U.C. Tonight
## 
### 
Intercollegiate swimming honors
will be at stake tonight when both
the Stanford varsity and the 1921
teams match their power with the
California varsity and freshmen at the
Olympic Club pool in San Francisco.
The meet will be a double-header in
the swimming line, as the local varsity
and the Berkeley varsity as well as
the Cardinal and Blue and Gold babes
aggregations will compete. The water
classic will come to order promptly
at 8 p.m. in the Winged "O" natator
ium, which is located at Post and
Mason streets.
The varsity's chances for a win over
the California outfit are an uncertain
guess. Mars has depleted the ranks
of both teams. Flood and Shlaude
man are Stanford's only hopes in the
sprints, but Captain Ed Winham,
Reeher, and Coonse may be booked
for a few points in the breast and
back strokes, and Rakestraw and
Stadt in the diving, and Canelo and I
Wickersham in the plunge are good;
assets.
The freshmen's chances in tonight's
v. ater-babe splash are good. Darling,
kipper of the local '21-ers, is a strong
man in the sprints, and together with
Lacey, Patrick, and Reynolds, makes
p a winning relay squad. Piatt and
xteid will represent tlie Cardinal in
the breast and back strokes.
