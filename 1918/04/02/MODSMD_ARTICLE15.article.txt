# GAIN IS MUTUAL

Tonight the Associated Student Body launches a campaign for 500
members by the end of the week. In placing the number at so low a
figure, it takes into account the fact that there arc less than five hun
dred women registered and to date only a few more than nine hundred
men. The task, then, is an entirely possible one, and there should be
no difficulty in reaching the goal.
A student body ticket this quarter offers added attractions. Contrary
to the ruling of last quarter, student body tickets this quarter will admit
their owners to four 25 cent contests, either baseball or track. This does
not include contests with the California varsity teams, though the same
concessions will be made as formerely to members of the student body.
In addition to this, a student body ticket entitles its holder to a subscrip
tion to the Daily Palo Alto, to the privilege of voting at all student elec
tions, and to the privilege of holding office. All who enter into any contest
or take part in dramatic productions must he members of the {student body.
