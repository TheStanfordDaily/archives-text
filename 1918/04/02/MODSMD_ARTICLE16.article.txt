# MANAGING EDITOR
## 
### 
In this issue of the Daily Palo Alto we take pleasure in announcing
the promotion of H. G. Swendsen, '20, to the position of managing editor
of the paper. By virtue of his holding first place on the news-editing staff
his merit for the position is unquestioned. Though only a '20 man, Swend
sen has shown exceptional ability, and competence, both on the news-edit
ing desk and as a reporter. He made first place in his class upon his ap
pointment to the staff, and has held that position ever since, until last
quarter, when ho outranked all other news-editors. Swendsen takes up
his work of putting the type together today.
It is also a pleasure to announce the promotion of A. W. Leeds, '20,
to the rank of news-editor. Leeds made the stall as a freshman, and is
row deserving of promotion for the competent work he has done as re
porter and assistant news-editor.
C. W. Doolittle, *20, and E. E. Crowe, '21, will come out of their aca
demic seclusion, which was maintained during the past quarter and will
resume their work on the staff.
