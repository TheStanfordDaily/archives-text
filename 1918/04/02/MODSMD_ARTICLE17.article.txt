The books show that both the athletic association and the student
body are seriously on the rocks, and a record-breaking sale of student
body tickets is needed to p,ut finances on a safe footing. Financial diffi
culties prevented the first issue of the Daily Palo Alto yesterday, and un
less support is given the student body, the daily paper may have to be dis
continued. No true Staufordite would condone suspension of one of the
most essential university institutions; 110 more should he permit the stu
dent body association to fail. Let it not be said that the Stanford man
or woman who remains in college is a slacker, in that he cannot uphold
the trust that is left to him by those who have gone.. It is up to each
one of us to "come through" to help those who will approach us tonight.
