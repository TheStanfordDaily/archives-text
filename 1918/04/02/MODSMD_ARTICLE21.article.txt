# D.P.A. Reporter Gives Overseas Chappie the Once Over in France
## 
### W.E. Bruns, ex-'l9 
Not only are the contents of the
forthcoming Chaparral which appears
on the Quad Thursday all furnished by
the Chappies "over there," but even
the publicity advance write-up has
come to the Daily Palo Alto all the
way from France. W. E. Bruns, ex-'l9,
news editor on the staff last year,
used to cover Chaparral as one of his
daily assignments, and when he dis
covered what the Chaparral writers
in France were up to, he looked over
their stuff and wrote the following
"story":

With their "tin derbies" securely
fastened and their gas masks within
reach, Chappie artists "over there"
have remained true to their oath and
Chappie's Corona beats to the tune of
falling shrapnel and popping cham
pagne corks on the western front.
For be it known to those on the
campus that under the camouflage of
khaki-clad privates in S. S. U. GMII are
all the old campus wits, "Lance" and
"Bob" and "Wullv" and "Walt" and
"Gawge," and in other parts of the
place called "somewhere" are "Feg"
Murray and "Jim" Wallace. Also be
it known that between blowouts —tire
and otherwise —they've concocted the
"Over There Edition" of Chaparral.
So when a star shell—in two colors
incidentally—bursts over the campus
oil a morning some weeks from the
time this is written, it will be the pre
lude to a "tii* de barrage" of joke and
verse and cartoon depicting war in all
its humor.
"Wui!y" Wields Pen.
"Wullv" Wohlford, erstwhile wield
er of the hammer, now more closely
identified with the coffin —he's a reck
less ambulance driver when the shells
are breaking—has produced a bit of
first-class verse which he titles "The
Slacker." It indicates everyone in

; characteristic Chaparral fashion. Lan
ding Warren meanwhile has evolved
| some atrocious red-flag tendencies
| which are disclosed for the first time
I in "A Letter To Miss Liberty."
"Feg" Murray, who hurdles barb
j wire entanglements to the dismay of
i the Boche, has marshaled a whole
I army of Snoppy-Quops across two
I pages of the coming issue for the en
j lightenment of the campus in "War
Terms." "Trench Humor," by Lan
sing Warren must likewise be includ
ed in a resume of the table of con
tents, as well as his "European Toast
to Champagne."
But it is strictly a war Chaparral,
even to the editorial page, where Walt
Gores with a few clever touches has
transferred the image of Chappie in
: times of peace to suit the spirit of thn
times.

Not only are the contents of the
forthcoming Chaparral which appears
on the Quad Thursday all furnished by
the Chappies "over there," but even
the publicity advance write-up has
come to the Daily Palo Alto all the
way from France. W. E. Bruns, ex-'l9,
news editor on the staff last year,
used to cover Chaparral as one of his
daily assignments, and when he dis
covered what the Chaparral writers
in France were up to, he looked over
their stuff and wrote the following
"story":

With their "tin derbies" securely
fastened and their gas masks within
reach, Chappie artists "over there"
have remained true to their oath and
Chappie's Corona beats to the tune of
falling shrapnel and popping cham
pagne corks on the western front.
For be it known to those on the
campus that under the camouflage of
khaki-clad privates in S. S. U. GMII are
all the old campus wits, "Lance" and
"Bob" and "Wullv" and "Walt" and
"Gawge," and in other parts of the
place called "somewhere" are "Feg"
Murray and "Jim" Wallace. Also be
it known that between blowouts —tire
and otherwise —they've concocted the
"Over There Edition" of Chaparral.
So when a star shell—in two colors
incidentally—bursts over the campus
oil a morning some weeks from the
time this is written, it will be the pre
lude to a "tii* de barrage" of joke and
verse and cartoon depicting war in all
its humor.
