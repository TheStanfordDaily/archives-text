# "FIVE HUNDRED" IS MINUS THIRTY IN REGISTRATION
## 
### 
When the doors of the Registrar's
i office c losed at 5 o'clock lant night
717 men and 470 women had enrolled
!in the University, making a total of
j 1187 students registered. Late regis
trations today and within the next
! few days will bring this up close to
| 1250, it is believed. Owing to the
fact that there is no waiting list of
women who wish to get in at this time
1 of tlie year, Stanford may be without
: the traditional "Five Hundred" total
for once in its history at the begin
ning of a term. Fourteen new women
j and fifteen new men registered yes
' terrlay.
Last quarter there were 901 men
and 500 women signed up, making a
total of 1401, so that when registra
tion is complete for this quarter the
.'ailing off will be but 150 or 175. This
| being the first year the quarter svs
j tem ha* been in operation, there can
be no exact comparison with former
years, but the fact that 1902 students
were enrolled for the spring semester
Of the year 1916-17, shows that there
are almost 700 fewer men in the Uni
! versity today as a result of the war.
