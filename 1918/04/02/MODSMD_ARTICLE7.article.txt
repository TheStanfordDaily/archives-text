# WINGED "0" TRACK MEN TO MEET STANFORD SATURDAY
## CAMP FREMONT MEN MAY ENTER TEAM Big Preliminary Event Will Give Dope on Battle With California 
### 
What promises to be the big event
of the preliminary track season will
be held on the Stanford track next
Saturday afternoon, when the Card
ii'Ml Varsity lines up against the speed
'■arncrs from the Olympic Club. The
meet will furnish the first real basis
'or comparison between the Stanford
a• i«1 California Varsities as the Olym
pic CUib will invade the farm fresh
from a decided victory over the col
li -vians from across the bay.
There is further possibility that the
Fremont track men will enter the
meet to make the affair a triangular
event. Nothing definite has been de
cided in regard to this as yet.
Whether or not the soldiers compete,
the meet with the Olympic Club will
create great interest, as the Ralston
T. Wilbur trophy is at stake, and
comes up for competition for the first
time. Wilbur offered the trophy sev
eral weeks ago to the winner of the
Olympic Club-Stanford meet.
Wilbur will probably be entered in
the meet, as he has still retained his
old faculty of throwing the hammer,
lie starred in both shot put and ham
mer throw back in 1599.
About as fast a bunch of starters
will oppose the Stanford men as could
be found in the bay region, outside of
college circles, as Coach Frank Fos
ter has scoured the country to obtain
classy material. The Stanford men
p?e none too confident of victory but
promise the club men strong com
petition.
