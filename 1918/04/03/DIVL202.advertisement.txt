Snap, precision—doing things on the jump—clean and right the first time.
Everything in his life brings him to the Gillette. There are more Gillettes in the
packs and pockets of Uncle Sam's Boys than of all other razors put together.
And this holds good for all the Allied Armies
and Navies on all the battle fronts of Europe
and the East, from the first gun fired in the
World War.
It's not alone the quality of the Gillette Shave
—the Gillette service whether the water is hot
or cold—the way it has solved thousands of
times every shaving* problem that any man can
put up to it—its soothing, bracing effect on the
sunburned or wind-sore skin.
There's the simplicity of it. Its freedom from
strops, hones, clutter and mess. The saving of
time and motion. Blades always sharp, always
ready. No strops or hones to clutter up the kit.
Everything a man needs for his shaving com
plete in one compact little unit that tucks away
in his kit or his pocket—and No Stropping, No
Honing.
