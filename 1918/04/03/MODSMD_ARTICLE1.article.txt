### 
Coach Scofield named, last night,
the members of the freshman nine who
are to make the trip to Berkeley to
morrow, when the 1921 players cross
hats with the California freshmen in
the lirst ot' their three-game series.
The members of the squad met yester
day afternoon and elected C. W. Teub
nor captain of the freshman team.
The newly elected captain is one of
the steadiest players of the team and
will hold down first base during the
California series.
Several .lien on Pro.
As a result of the operation of the
faculty axe several members of the
freshman team will not fill their ac
customed places. Oillis and Newland
will form the battery which will start
the game against the Blue and Gold.
(Jillis has been heaving the sphere
exceptionally well during the last lew
games and should hold the team across
the bay down to comparatively few
hits.
Teii'uier Looks Hood.
Captain Teubner should do good
work on first base and".less ' Burks
is iust as sure in his operations
around the keystone bag. Rutledge
will hold down the third sack and is
a veteran at the position. Reynolds
will be playing a new position at
short", but has demonstrated his abil
ity throughout the season to fill almost
any position on the team.
Kline, Supple, and Smith will
cavort around in the outfield. All
three men have had experience in the
outfield throughout the year.
A good line of substitutes has been
named to accompany the team to
Bei'keley. Fairchild and Filley have
been selected as the substitute bat
tery in it is necessary to relieve
Cillis from the-*.mound. Parker and
Patrick for the outfield are both ex
perienced players and could easily
substitute without impairing the ef
ficiency of the nine. Crowe has been
named as utility infielder.
it is almost impossible to dope the
outcome of the series with the Blue
and Gold babes. A comparison of the
scores made by the two teams against
various high schools around the .bay
region gives a slight advantage to the
locals.
With the exception of the game with
Oakland Tech, which was the first of
the season, the Cardinal first-year
men have made higher scores against
the high schools tliah their rivals.
The comparison seems to Indicate that
the Stanford team plays a tighter
brand of ball than the nine from across
the bay. Fewer oppon nts have
crossed their home plate during the
season than have made the round of
the California diamond.*
