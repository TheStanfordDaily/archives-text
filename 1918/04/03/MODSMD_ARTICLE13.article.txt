# A.S.S.U. CAMPAIGN IS BRINGING EARLY RESULTS
## MANY WOMEN BUY CARDS Ticket Sale To Be Continued on the Quad Tomorrow and Friday 
### 
Partial returns from the A. S. S. U.
drive for 500 hundred members indi
cates that the number will 'pass this
requirement before the end of the
week. Only the fraternities, sororities,
and Encina Ilall have been canvassed
so l'ar by Graduate Manager Pettingill
and his assistants, but all these organ
izations have come through in good
shape.
Ono feature of the drive so tar that
promises success for the student body
this year is the fact that the women
of die University are joining in larger
numbers than ever before. Returns
from two sororities showed some
twenty-five members late last night.
The effort to get members will lie
continued tonight and tomorrow. Men
who canvassed last night and were not
able to sell cards to every one in the
living groups will bo sent back with
cards for the remainder tonight. A
great effort is to be made to get a
large number from Roble*and Encina
in the remainder of the drive since
the fraternities were covered last
night.

muters and students living in Palo
\ 1 to tickets are to be put on sale in

The new features of the A. S. S. U.
