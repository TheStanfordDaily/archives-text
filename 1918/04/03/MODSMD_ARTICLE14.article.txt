# Stanford Varsity in Crucial Week
## Battle With Fremont Tonight Is Last Game Before Big Squabble 
### 
Captain Lilly and his proteges will
enter tlie last stage of what may be
their crucial week in baseball to
morrow following their game with the
Fremont champions tonight. Califor
nia has already won one game, but in
case Stanford can win Saturday on
the local diamond the series will be
evened up and the battle will start
anew. In case the Blue and Gold
takes the contest, Stanford will be so
far behind that it will be almost im
possible to catch up.
The varsity feels confident for its
game this week-end. Ellison was
largely responsible for the score at
California, although the boots and
errors of judgment by the Cardinal
players helped things along. The Cal
ifornia heaver's strong point was his
fast ball, something new to the locals
this year, but now that the Stanford
ites have become used to this ball,
I there is no reason why nineteen men
should go out by the strike-out route.
The varsity men had a bad run of
luck in practice last night, but Mon
day they played like leaguers. Lifur
is being put through the paces in
good shape this week and should be
improved considerably by Saturday.
At present no shifts will be made
in the varsity line-up for the second
I buttle unless some men show up good
tonight. The only possible shifts
would be at first base and in right
field, but Davis and Harvey still
seem to have these positions in their
pockets.
