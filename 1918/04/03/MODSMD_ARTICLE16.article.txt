# LET'S ALL BE THERE!

### 
Une Nuit a Paris on the Stanford campus Saturday night promises to he
the biggest social event of the college year. Preparations are being made
for such a variety of entertainment as will appeal to any taste or personality.
Stanford women are making extensive arrangements to please and amuse
an audience here, that a people over there may be helped and saved. For
this reason, if for no other, Stanford people should back the movement, for
all the funds will go to help send the Stanford Women's Unit for Civilian
Relief in France over the seas.
It will not be a matter of charity entirely, by any means, for the five
hundred are planning to give the public some rare treats in the way of en
tertainment., and every "centime" expended in"the night in Paris" will bring
double returns to the spender in fun at the time of spending, and in the
knowledge that some French orphan or widow will be made happier and
better by it.
But the best reason why the true Stanford man and woman will support
the fete is that Stanford never fails in any real work it undertakes. The
sending of-the women's unit to France is an enormous undertaking, and it
will require full support of the graduate and undergraduate students to put it
through. This is the big opportunity for the undergraduate student body to
do its part and it will entail no particular sacrifice, for the occasion will be
one of festivity and joy as well as benefit. Let every student be among those
present. i ______
