# Dr. Perry Speaks on War Conditions
## Advises Students Not To Slight Studies During the War 
### 
"This, of all years, is no time for
any university to close up shop or run
on half-time, or for anyone genuinely
at work at college to feel that liis oc
cupation is frivolous or needless. IL'
your country calls you to active work
at the front, rejoice at your opportun
ity; if not, hold yourself in readiness
to serve your nation in any other way.
Realize that, you are at the dawn of a
new epoch in the history of the world,
and that by joining the great, council
of thinking men and women you are
helping to make history."
Such was the message of Dr. Ralph
Barton Perry, professor of philosophy
at Harvard University, in liis lecture
"Universities in War Time," delivered
last night at the Little Theater. He
gave the philosopher's view of the
causes and conditions of the war, and
the relation of the work of the great,
educational institutions to it.
"The present war is a war of na
tions, and an entire nation cannot he
put in the trenches," said Dr. Perry,
"so the educational institutions will
have an important part to play in the
war. The universities may be de
pended upon to strengthen our na
tional morale, efliciency, and wisdom
during the struggle.
"College life may well be a saving
force in the life of nations during and
immediately after the war. In college
men learn to lead and be led, and that
differences in origin, station, and abil
ity need not prevent participation in
a common life and a striving toward
a common ideal.
"The universities should lead in
true efficiency. Almost all the pur
suits of civil life are duplicated in
the organization of a modern army.
It is well known tbat a high degree of
| intelligence is necessary to the high
est success of even the most technical
arts and sciences, and tbis develop
ment of non-teclinical intelligence
the universities are to supply."
"Even greater than the need for ef
ficiency in the war is the need for
wisdom," declared Dr. Perry. He said
that the great complexity of the war
made deep thinking necessary on the
part of intelligent men and women of
the country and the groat advantage
of the Allies is in their moral founda
tion. The need for national self-jus
tification was emphasized by the
speaker, who pointed out that we en
tered the war merely in a spirit of
righteous indignation, but are now
fighting to secure permanent peace
and well-being for all mankind.
