# Dr. Perry Speaks on War Conditions
## Advises Students Not To Slight Studies During the War 
### 
"This, of all years, is no time for
any university to close up shop or run
on half-time, or for anyone genuinely
at work at college to feel that liis oc
cupation is frivolous or needless. IL'
your country calls you to active work
at the front, rejoice at your opportun
ity; if not, hold yourself in readiness
to serve your nation in any other way.
Realize that, you are at the dawn of a
new epoch in the history of the world,
and that by joining the great, council
of thinking men and women you are
helping to make history."
Such was the message of Dr. Ralph
Barton Perry, professor of philosophy
at Harvard University, in liis lecture
"Universities in War Time," delivered
last night at the Little Theater. He
gave the philosopher's view of the
causes and conditions of the war, and
the relation of the work of the great,
educational institutions to it.
"The present war is a war of na
tions, and an entire nation cannot he
put in the trenches," said Dr. Perry,
"so the educational institutions will
have an important part to play in the
war. The universities may be de
pended upon to strengthen our na
tional morale, efliciency, and wisdom
during the struggle.
