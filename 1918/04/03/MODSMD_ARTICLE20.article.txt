With Jud House gone, the hurdles
I are depending upon the very capable
I legs of E. \j. Davis. Those same legs
will probably be kept busy with the
hurdles, the pole vault and the relay.
I New men are appearing in the hurdles
land might develop Block "S" form.
jGlikbarg won his class letter in the
j 1019 freshman track meet in the low
; hurdles, and is commencing to r&und
| into shape. Sturgeon has logs for the
; high, hurdles, but lacks experience.
He is working hard and may develop.

These long distance men are look
ing better every minute, and it seems
i as if Stanford should pretty near clean
up in all events from tho half-mile
up. Besides the mainstays, Captain
Wilson, Chapman, Samis, Colglazler,
i Teitsworth, and McPherson, such men
las Carlyle and Horn threaten to break
into the point gathering class.

One of the biggest surprises of the
year lias been the constantly incrcas-
I iug speed that I?. F. Davis is develop
jiug. I !r> was not counted among tlio
1 Varsity holies early in the season, but
'his improvement marks liim as a very
probable point scorer in both sprints.

Curtice is commencing to get results
with the hammer and should heave it
out close to one hundred and forty
foot on Saturday. The coaching done
by Ralston Wilbur has improved his
form, and it is thought that he will be
able to step into the California men
for a few points on April 13.
