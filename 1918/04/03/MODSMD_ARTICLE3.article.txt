# Chappie Storms Quad Tomorrow in French Attire
## 
### 
Bursting upon the campus like the
star shell on the cover, the overseas
edition of Chaparral will appear upon
the Quad tomorrow. It isn't "The
Chaparral" any more; it's "le Chapar
ral." and the boys in France have
noted the change in title on the cover.
This cover is one of the features of
the issue, done in George Hall's
inimitable style, and picturesquely
showing Chappie in the trenches, his
figure outlined by the light of a star
shell. The tine is "A New Light on
an Old Subject." The cover is fin
ished in blue, black, and white.
The frontispiece has been drawn by
"Peg" Murray, '16, and illustrates "As
Kaiser Wilhelm der Kultured Looks
to the Man Who Flunked Out." There
are many other drawings by Murray,
not the least of which is a two-page
series of cartoons entitled "Murray's
Dictionary of the War." No issue
from the boys over in France would
be complete without Lance Warren's
contributions. Warren, who was
Chaparral editor last year, has con
tributed, among other things, a poem
on "Our Sense of Fun," and a letter
to the Statue of Liberty.
Hob Donaldson, '17, shows in this
issue that his old poetic ability lias not
deserted him, as he has sent several
long poems, both comic and semi
serious. "A Letter to Mary Kappa,"
"Civil Life," and "War Annoyances"
are only some of Donaldson's contri
butions.
"Wully" Wohlford, *18, editor-elect
of Chaparral, has edited this edition
and wields the editorial pen in char
acteristic fashion. Walt Cores, '17,
has changed the editorial page cut
into a â€¢warlike Chappie, and the old
Chaparral motto into "It is bettor to
have fought at all."
have fough tat all."
"Hip" Levy, '16, has supplied his
quota of jokes, and Walt Hruns, '1.9,
appears as a contributor to this issue.
Miss Ruth Taylor, '19, is the only
campus personage to appear among
the list of contributors. She has il
lustrated a page of cartoons on the
subject of "When the Hoys Come
Hack" at tlie request of the Chappies
over there.
