# Aqua a la Searsville Must Be Conserved or Summer Students Will Go Unwashed
## 
### 
Summer students will have to go
without their annual, and the already
ill-nourished lawns of the various
domiciles along the Row may be left
to wane and wax yellow and dead, it
the shortage of water from Searsvillo
dam is not conserved.
Old Jupe Pluvius has proved sulky
| this year, and consequently there is
only some twenty feet reposing in the
| ample bosom of tho dam, instead ot
\ the fifty feet or water required. Of
â€¢ this, it appears that only a few inches
| are taken up by the favorite drink of
jthe VV. C. T. U., the residue being
i made up of mud, pollywogs, and what
i 1
I the picnickers left behind.
All of which means that if more
I care is not exercised in the near future
| in sprinkling lawns, there is danger
that this fovorite Indoor Sport will be
i summarily curtailed during the sum-
I mer months.
