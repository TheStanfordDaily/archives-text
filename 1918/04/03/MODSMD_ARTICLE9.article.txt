# Varsity Runners to Match Speed With Winged "0"
## 
### 
When Frank Foster's Olympic Club
hopes invade the campus next Satur
day, the varsity speedsters will be up
against the hardest competition of the
year and a real test of their ability.
The meet, which is scheduled for the
Stanford oval, at 2 o'clock next Sat
urday afternoon, promises to bring
forth real competition and fast time.
The Cardinals realize that they will
|
l.rve to display their total wares for
j the first time this year and will be
up for approval or disapproval of the
[campus critics. A large crowd is ex-
I i:ected to be on hand because of the
lieputation of the Olympic runners,
and the fact that the meet will be the
last before the final test with Cali
j fornia on April 1". Admission of 25
[ cents is to be charged, but holders of
(student body tickets will be admitted
; free.
The Olympic Club sent a strong team
j against the University of California
: lust week and overwhelmed the Blue
and Gold 9S 1 ,& t<> ">'iV&. It is safe to
predict that the club men will send aft
strong a bunch of competitors against
the Cardinals, since the Ralston Wil
bur trophy is at stake. A lairly good
lino on the relative merits of the
strength of both college teams will
therefore be furnished by this meet.
Stout won the half-mile, the mile, and
the two-mile against California last
Saturday, but it is extremely doubtful
if he will even attempt to duplicate
this feat against the Cardinals, as
long distance runners constitute the
principal forte of the Stanford team.
Melville showed his heels to a fast
bunch at California in the sprints, and
it is doubtful if anyone here can touch
him, although there is always the pos
sibility of one of the Farm sprinters
coining through. Pyne is the Olym
pic's best bet in the high hurdles, and
won this event from the Blue and
Gold leapers; his teammate, Harley,
duplicated this feat in the low hurdles.
E. Ij. Davis will furnish both of these
boys with ample competition.
"Dink" Templeton easily won the
high and broad jumps last Saturday,
and should repeat down here, if he
accompanies the Olympic Club team
"Here" Hihlman, '17, shoved the shot
up at California and may be one of
Foster's hopes this coming Saturday.
Ralston Wilbur, ex-'n9, may also com
pete for his own trophy. Ollie Snedi
gar won the discus and javelin, be
sides starting the runners in the vari
ous events. He probably will dupli
cate tbis Saturday.
