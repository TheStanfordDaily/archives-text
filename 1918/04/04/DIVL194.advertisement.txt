BANKING BY MAIL
is becoming more popular every day
for the reason that its safety, conven
ience, and cheapness are now fully
recognized. The service which was
considered unusual a few years ago
is today an important feature with our
bank. We make a specialty of it, and
our deposit-by-mail business is stead
ily increasing.
Our Bank will soon have a Palo
Alto connection under the title of
TIIF STANFORD BANK.
Watch for our further announce
ments.
