# CAMP FREMONT DEFEATS VARSITY
## 
### 
In a game featured by loose play
ing and but few scorcs the Headquar
ters Company of tHe Eighty-third In
fantry defeated the Varsity baseball
j team yesterday afternoon in a 2 to 0
'game. Without a regular pitcher on
j the mound the varsity could not put
up their beat brand of ball although
! Dickey did good work in holding the
| army team down to four hits.
The nearest (lie locals came to scor
ing was when Galloway attempted to
steal in the fourth and was tagged
out at the plate. The Fremont team
scored two runs in the fifth frame as
a result of two errors, a hit, and two
passed balls. This was the only in

i ning in which the soldiers got any
| farther than second base.
Lilly and Dickey Hit.
Lilly secured hits for Stanford, one
of them being a two-bagger in the first
inning. Dickey bingled the sphere for
a hit in the third round. On the
mound he struck out ten men with
out allowing a walk. With Lifur in
the box and Dickey in his accus
tomed place the score should have
been reversed. This game was the
Varsity's last before the second game
with California, which takes place on
the Varsity diamond Saturday after
noon after the Olympic Club track
meet.
