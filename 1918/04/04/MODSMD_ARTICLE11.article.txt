# WILL LAUNCH CAMPAIGN FOR RECRUITS IN R.O.T.C.
## BIG RALLY IN ENCINA HALL TONIGHT Former Stanford Men Are Scheduled to Speak to Students 
### 
A campaign to secure at least one
hundred new recruits for the ranks of
the Stanford R. O. T. C. will be
launched tonight at a big rally to be
held in Eneina Hall. The rally will
be preceded by a parade down the
Row. Speakers from Camp Fremont
and the campus will give short,
snappy talks.
The situation as it stands now is
such that at least one hundred new
men must sign up for military
in order to keep the R. O. T. C. up to
the standard of last quarter in the
number of men and companies. The
government requires a minimum of
fifty men in an R. O. T. C. company.
Unless the registration is materially
increased the number of companies
must be cut down and that means
that a large number of commissioned
R. O. T. C. officers must be reduced,
with a corresponding loss to the
standing of the corps.
Besides Captain Parker and Captain
Volkmar, Dr. Wilbur and Captain
Short of Camp Fremont, the speakers
scheduled for tonight include such
former Stanford men as "Ric" Tern
pleton, "Doc" Howard, and Bob Ames.
Templeton was one of the greatest
athletes that ever donned a Cardinal
jersey and was a trainer of Stanford
track and Rugby teams. He is now
in the 319 th Engineers at Camp Fre
mont. Howard is a former Daily Palo
Alto editor and Ames was the presi
dent of last year's Senior Class. Both
are first lieutenants at Fremont.
Captain Short is a graduate of the
U. S. Army school of bayonet work at
Fort Sill, Oklahoma, and has been in
