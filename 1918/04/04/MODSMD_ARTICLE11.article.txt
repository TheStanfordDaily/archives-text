# WILL LAUNCH CAMPAIGN FOR RECRUITS IN R.O.T.C.
## BIG RALLY IN ENCINA HALL TONIGHT Former Stanford Men Are Scheduled to Speak to Students 
### 
A campaign to secure at least one
hundred new recruits for the ranks of
the Stanford R. O. T. C. will be
launched tonight at a big rally to be
held in Eneina Hall. The rally will
be preceded by a parade down the
Row. Speakers from Camp Fremont
and the campus will give short,
snappy talks.
The situation as it stands now is
such that at least one hundred new
men must sign up for military
in order to keep the R. O. T. C. up to
the standard of last quarter in the
number of men and companies. The
government requires a minimum of
fifty men in an R. O. T. C. company.
Unless the registration is materially
increased the number of companies
must be cut down and that means
that a large number of commissioned
R. O. T. C. officers must be reduced,
with a corresponding loss to the
standing of the corps.
Besides Captain Parker and Captain
Volkmar, Dr. Wilbur and Captain
Short of Camp Fremont, the speakers
scheduled for tonight include such
former Stanford men as "Ric" Tern
pleton, "Doc" Howard, and Bob Ames.
Templeton was one of the greatest
athletes that ever donned a Cardinal
jersey and was a trainer of Stanford
track and Rugby teams. He is now
in the 319 th Engineers at Camp Fre
mont. Howard is a former Daily Palo
Alto editor and Ames was the presi
dent of last year's Senior Class. Both
are first lieutenants at Fremont.
Captain Short is a graduate of the
U. S. Army school of bayonet work at
Fort Sill, Oklahoma, and has been in
| strut ting the men of Camp Fremont
!in this work. He taught it to the
j R. O. T. C. officers last quarter.
Captain Parker and the R. O. T. C.
( officers express great ho])e that the
j campaign will bring out many new
men. A similar campaign last quar
ter recruited seventy new members
i for the R. O. T. C. and the need now
; is said to be greater than it was then.
| With government inspection only a
few weeks away the leaders ot' the
R. O. T. C. hope to fill the ranks and
make such a showing as will merit
the placing of Stanford at the top of
I the distinguised class in military
jwhere this institution stood last year.
| The parade down the Row is sched
uled to start at 7:15 this evening and
the rally in Encina will begin imme
diately afterwards. Every man on
| the campus is urged to attend to
! night's rally.
With the giving of credit and the
increasing of the number of hours,
i the advantages offered students tak
ing military have been greatly in-
I creased. Captain Parker announced
| this morning that the hours of drill
I would be the same as previously pub
' lislied and that the University had
-
j definitely decided to give from one to
\ four hours of credit for the work.
Freshmen and sophomores may get
one or three hours of credit and up
j perclass men may get two or four
1 hours. The length of drill and class
hours has been practically doubled.
! All men must drill six hours a week
: and underclass men will receive one
■ hour of credit, while upperclass men
! will receive two. In addition, all men
j qualified to take the advanced course
j can receive two more hours of credit
by attending a two-hour class on Mon
day afternoon.
j Anyone who lias had two semesters
of military drill, here or elsewhere,
or one semester and intensive, or the
equivalent, is eligible for the ad

! night's rally.
With the giving of credit and the
increasing of the number of hours,
i the advantages offered students tak
ing military have been greatly in-
I creased. Captain Parker announced
| this morning that the hours of drill
I would be the same as previously pub
' lislied and that the University had
-
j definitely decided to give from one to
\ four hours of credit for the work.
Freshmen and sophomores may get
one or three hours of credit and up
j perclass men may get two or four
1 hours. The length of drill and class
hours has been practically doubled.
! All men must drill six hours a week
: and underclass men will receive one
■ hour of credit, while upperclass men
! will receive two. In addition, all men
j qualified to take the advanced course
j can receive two more hours of credit
by attending a two-hour class on Mon
day afternoon.
j Anyone who lias had two semesters
of military drill, here or elsewhere,
or one semester and intensive, or the
equivalent, is eligible for the ad
vanced course. Hours of drill have
been announced as follows: Morning
classps, Monday, Wednesday, Thurs
day, and Friday, from 11:15 a.m. to
12:15 p.m., and Saturday morning

A campaign to secure at least one
hundred new recruits for the ranks of
the Stanford R. O. T. C. will be
launched tonight at a big rally to be
held in Eneina Hall. The rally will
be preceded by a parade down the
Row. Speakers from Camp Fremont
and the campus will give short,
snappy talks.
The situation as it stands now is
such that at least one hundred new
men must sign up for military
in order to keep the R. O. T. C. up to
the standard of last quarter in the
number of men and companies. The
government requires a minimum of
fifty men in an R. O. T. C. company.
Unless the registration is materially
increased the number of companies
must be cut down and that means
that a large number of commissioned
R. O. T. C. officers must be reduced,
with a corresponding loss to the
standing of the corps.
Besides Captain Parker and Captain
Volkmar, Dr. Wilbur and Captain
Short of Camp Fremont, the speakers
scheduled for tonight include such
former Stanford men as "Ric" Tern
pleton, "Doc" Howard, and Bob Ames.
Templeton was one of the greatest
athletes that ever donned a Cardinal
jersey and was a trainer of Stanford
track and Rugby teams. He is now
in the 319 th Engineers at Camp Fre
mont. Howard is a former Daily Palo
Alto editor and Ames was the presi
dent of last year's Senior Class. Both
are first lieutenants at Fremont.
Captain Short is a graduate of the
U. S. Army school of bayonet work at
Fort Sill, Oklahoma, and has been in
| strut ting the men of Camp Fremont
!in this work. He taught it to the
j R. O. T. C. officers last quarter.
Captain Parker and the R. O. T. C.
( officers express great ho])e that the
j campaign will bring out many new
men. A similar campaign last quar
ter recruited seventy new members
i for the R. O. T. C. and the need now
; is said to be greater than it was then.
| With government inspection only a
few weeks away the leaders ot' the
R. O. T. C. hope to fill the ranks and
make such a showing as will merit
the placing of Stanford at the top of
I the distinguised class in military
jwhere this institution stood last year.
| The parade down the Row is sched
uled to start at 7:15 this evening and
the rally in Encina will begin imme
diately afterwards. Every man on
