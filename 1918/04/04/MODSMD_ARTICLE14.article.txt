# ENROLL FOR MILITARY

### 
That there should be a shortage of men in the number enrolled in mili
tary training courses in the University at such a time as this is surprising.
Yet such is the case. Last quarter at this time there were 350 men regis
tered for drill; now there are but 250. Enrollments for military training last
quarter reached a maximum of 400 men, and the number this quarter should
be equally as large. ,
For the man who intends to serve his country now or later there is every
reason why such an opportunity for training as is being offered here should
not be wasted. Every one realizes that it is a patriotic duty to be prepared
for service in time of war, but for some reason or other the number of Stan
ford men in the University preparing themselves for the call is smaller than
was hoped and expected.
Men who are now debating in what branch of service to enlist will doubt
less wish to enter some of the officers' training camps which will be opened
this summer. An elementary knowledge of military tactics will be a strong
recommendation for entrance to such camps. It is an unfortunate circum
stance, too, that unless enough men come out for military training now, to
keep the number of companies up to full strength, some of the men who
have earned commissions in the Stanford R. O. T. C. will be forced to give
up their commissions.
Time in drilling will not be lost, even in case a man doesn't enter
the service, for University credit is being given to all in varying degrees
according to the amount of time put in. New regulations regarding units
will be explained tonight at the rally to be held in Encina Hall for the pur
pose of discussing the need for military training, and it is to be hoped that
an encouragingly large number of recruits will be secured.
