# HOOVER STANFORD MANSION STORY IS DECLARED UNTRUE
## 
### 
That the story of the plans of Her- j
bert Hoover to build a mansion on the |
hill behind Stanford is all a myth, was j
the recent declaration of Mrs. Hoover. I
Mrs. Hoover's denial was brought
about by the attacks made on her
husband on the ground that he was
diverting labor to the building of a
large home during times when labor
was urgently needed in other places.
She states that her husband had
merely asked an architect to draw up
some rough plans for a little home
in the hills, which they hoped to erect
if possible some time after the war.
The architect, however, seems to have
misunderstood, and drew up a set of
:elaborate plans for a veritable regal
mansion instead of for a "little home."
Thereupon, Mr. Hoover dropped the
j subject, and it was not mentioned
; again until the newspapers of the
| country brought to bis notice that he
was contemplating building a home
according to those plans.
