# Track Men End Work For Contest With Olympic Club
## 
### 
Stanford track men concluded their
hard training for the week today and
are in condition for the crack of the
starter's pistol, which will send the
lirst batch of runners off their mark
in the first event of the Olympic Club
meet on Saturday,
Cardinal Is Strong.
A strong team will display its class
for the Cardinal, and will be the pick
of the campus track talent. Whether
or not the collegians can bring home
the Ralston Wilbur trophy that is at
stake remains to be seen, as Coach
Frank Foster of the Olympic Club
boasts of an exceptionally speedy as
sortment of athletes.
Olympics Include Stars.
If ".Jud" House, "Ric" Templeton,
"Dink" Templeton, and "Here" Rihl
man all compete for the Olympics, as
is extremely likely, more than a strong
possibility exists of the club men
being able to carry away the trophy.
At any rate the Stanford men will be
furnished excellent competition and a

; strong final test before the big meet on
1 April 13.
It is in the longer distances that
j the best competition is expected.
| Eddie Stout is the Olympic Club's
I best bet, and he will find himself hard
j pressed to beat the Stanford long
[ distance men. For the Cardinals,
Chapman, Captain Wilson, and Horn
will probably run the two-mile, with
! Chapman running lor a record. Col
-1 glazier, Teitsworth, Samis, and Car
! lisle will probably enter the mile, with
j McPherson, Teitsworth, and possibly
i Wilson taking care of the half. Fuller
land Ludwig will probably assist Stout
i in troubling the Stanford men in the
j distances.
In the sprints the club men appear
to have all the best of it, with House
and Melville, the high school runner,
to be depended on for firsts and sec
onds. H. F. Davis, Dinkelspiel, and
Maynard will probably take care of
| the remaining points.
Maynard should have no trouble
with the quarter-mile, as Haywards
hardly runs in championship time.
McCloskey and Hall will finish well
in the running. House can be counted
on in the low hurdles, but E. L. Davis
should finish second. Pyne of the
; Olympics and Glikbarg of the Card
i inals will fight for the remaining
| place. "Ric" Templeton will probably
! win the high hurdles, although Davis
can be counted on to press and maybe
beat him. Rogers and Gibbs for Stan
ford and Hartley for the club will
compete for third.
"Dink" and "Ric" Templeton will
fight it out with Heath and Weaver
in high jump, with Lyon and
I Nagel in the broad. This will be
| Nagel's first appearance in competi
tion this year and dopesters are anx
| ious to see what he can do. House
may enter and win this event. E. L.
Davis will again fight it out with
Lieutenant Art Hutchinson in the pole
vault. They tied at 11 feet G inches
last week.
Bihlman should far outclass cam
pus talent in the shot, although Weit
ze 1 will probably stop into second or
third place. Curtice will throw the
hammer and should score some points
for the Cardinals, although McEacli
ren, Bihlman, and Wilbur for the club
men look like hard athletes to defeat.
Coonse and Metcalf will likewise
throw the weight for the University
men.
The javelin and discus will bring
new campus talent to light, probably
in tiic person of Curtice, but the Olym
pic Club looks to have the best of
things in this event through the abil
ity of Ollie Snedigar and Jacobs.
