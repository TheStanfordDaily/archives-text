## 
### 
Undergraduate as well as graduate
women of Stanford are preparing to
engage in active war service this
spring. Wl'ile alumnae go to France
to take up reconstruction work in the
devastated portions of that country,
the women now enrolled in the Uni
versity propose to form an agricul
tural unit for work in the Santa Clara
valley.
An assembly of all University
women is scheduled for Thursday,
April i i, in the As&enibl, Hall', at the
usual hour. At this time open discus
sion of the project will be held and
representative women will be asked
to speak from the floor. Ideas and
opinions from all interested will he

welcomed at the assembly.
Women's Conference will call the
assembly and Miss Josephine Welch,
'IS, president, will preside. Miss
Margaret Shedd, '20, will present the
need for labor in the Santa Clara val
ley in the coming season. Miss Shedd
is chairman of the Women's War
Emergency Committee, which is in
charge of the project of the agricul
tural unit.
Professor It. W. Doane of the En
tomology department has been much
interested in the proposed aid in food
production by Stanford undergraduate
women. Professor Doane and .Miss
Harriet Bradford, dean of women, dis
cussed the matter with the president
of the Prune and Apricot Growers'
Association several weeks ago. The
latter made the statement that one
hundred women could easily be placed
in the Santa Clara valley during the
coming season for work in packing
and canning fruit.
Professor Doane and Miss Bradford
may be speakers at the assembly.
Moth consider the move to be a patri
otic measure especially appropriate
for college women to take up. They
are eager to see Stanford take the
lead in forming a women's agricul
tural unit for work in food produc
tion and conservation. Xo other uni
versity on the coast has adopted this
or any similar measure up to the pres
ent time.
