# WINGED "0" TRACK TEAM TO INVADE FARM TOMORROW
## MEET IS SCHEDULED TO START AT 1:30 Keen Rivalry Expected to Draw Large Crowdâ€”Club Men Highly Touted 
### 
With officials selected and team
chosen, the track men await the start
of their hip; test with the Olympic
Club scheduled for 1:30 o'clock to
morrow afternoon. The meet is to
start at this time, instead of later, so
as to give the spectators opportunity
to : both the track meet and the
ba.seball game with California.
A large crowd is expected to be on
hand for the meet, as the Olympic
Club is entering a much touted team
and the varsity promises to be at its
best Sudent body tickets or 25 cents
will admit people beyond the confines
of the door keeper. Intense rivalry
exists between the clubmen and the
collegians, as the Ralston T. Wilbur
trophy is at stake for the first time.
This handsome $250 cup was pre
sented by Wilbur early in the winter
quarter to awaken enthusiasm and in
terest for the annual meet with the
Olympic Club. Wilbur is a former
Stanford man and a present member
of the Olympic Club, and it is probable
that he will compete for the Post
street aggregation tomorrow after
noon.
That a definite idea on the way the
Stanford tracksters will stack up in
their final meet with the I ni\orsity of
California on April 13 can be had
from the result of the Olympic Club
meet, is an important factor in the in
terest that is being aroused for this
event. With California already a vic
tim of the clubmen it remains to be
seen whether or not the Cardinal
speedsters are able to hold their own
on Saturday.
Complicating matters somewhat is
the appearance of "Jud" House, "Ric"
Templeton and Lieutenant Hutchin
son in Olympic Club suits tomorrow.
They did not compete for the club
last week; if they had there is no
doubt but that the defeat of the Cali
fornia runners would have been still
more overwhelming.
Chapman will probably be pressed
for the first time this year when he
takes the mark against "English
Eddie" Stout, who possesses the repu
tation of being one of the best long
distance runners in the country. The
Cardinal veteran is confident'*of his
ability to beat the Olympian. Captain
A. F. Wilson will be at his best Sat
urday and right up in the running in
the two-mile. Maynard is expected to
run in excellent form and fast time,
if he is pressed at all. The sprinters
and hurdlers will have an exception
ally fast bunch to compete against,
and will hardly be discouraged if
they do not cop off many firsts and
seconds.

seen whether or not the Cardinal
speedsters are able to hold their own
on Saturday.
Complicating matters somewhat is
the appearance of "Jud" House, "Ric"
Templeton and Lieutenant Hutchin
son in Olympic Club suits tomorrow.
They did not compete for the club
last week; if they had there is no
doubt but that the defeat of the Cali
fornia runners would have been still
more overwhelming.
Chapman will probably be pressed
for the first time this year when he
takes the mark against "English
Eddie" Stout, who possesses the repu
tation of being one of the best long
distance runners in the country. The
Cardinal veteran is confident'*of his
ability to beat the Olympian. Captain
A. F. Wilson will be at his best Sat
urday and right up in the running in
the two-mile. Maynard is expected to
run in excellent form and fast time,
if he is pressed at all. The sprinters
and hurdlers will have an exception
ally fast bunch to compete against,
and will hardly be discouraged if
they do not cop off many firsts and
seconds.
With officials selected and team
chosen, the track men await the start
of their hip; test with the Olympic
Club scheduled for 1:30 o'clock to
morrow afternoon. The meet is to
start at this time, instead of later, so
as to give the spectators opportunity
to : both the track meet and the
ba.seball game with California.
A large crowd is expected to be on
hand for the meet, as the Olympic
Club is entering a much touted team
and the varsity promises to be at its
best Sudent body tickets or 25 cents
will admit people beyond the confines
of the door keeper. Intense rivalry
exists between the clubmen and the
collegians, as the Ralston T. Wilbur
trophy is at stake for the first time.
This handsome $250 cup was pre
sented by Wilbur early in the winter
quarter to awaken enthusiasm and in
terest for the annual meet with the
Olympic Club. Wilbur is a former
Stanford man and a present member
of the Olympic Club, and it is probable
that he will compete for the Post
street aggregation tomorrow after
noon.
That a definite idea on the way the
Stanford tracksters will stack up in
their final meet with the I ni\orsity of
California on April 13 can be had
from the result of the Olympic Club
meet, is an important factor in the in
terest that is being aroused for this
event. With California already a vic
