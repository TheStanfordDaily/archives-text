# VARSITY NINES MEET IN SECOND GAME SATURDAY
## CARDINAL HEAVERS LOOK STRONGER Prospects Are Favorable for Staging Come-Back Against Bruins 
### 
Stanford and California will battle
for what may be the crucial win in
baseball Saturday afternoon immedi
ately following the track meet with
the Olympic Club of San Francisco.
Caliiornia won the first game between
the two nines and should she take the
second will be well on the way to vic
tory. In case the Cardinal can top the
Blue and Gold at the end of nine
frames, the series will bo evened up,
however, and Stanford bas a chance
to win the title.
Pitchers Look Heifer.
After Dickey's exhibition of heaving
against the soldiers from Fremont
last Wednesday, Captain Lilly seems
to have found a man to relieve Lifur
in case a change is necessary. Dickey
fanned ten men, allowed but four hits,
and did not walk a man in seven in
nings against the soldiers, lie put
thorn across like a leaguer and should
lip an excellent man for relief. Lifur
will start the Saturday contest.
Lilly Hits Well.
The fact that Lilly has found his
batting eye to such an extent that he
is poling out two hits regularly in
games augurs well for a win Satur
day, in case the rest of the team is
up to its usual gait. Ellison, the Cali
iornia leaver, has one of the fastest
balls around the bushes but he has
110 bad break on the ball and 110 par
ticular control. With these facts
facing it, all that is necessary is that
the Varsity take a swing at the ball,
and hits should result.
The team will he in good shape for
the game Saturday since the only in
jured man in Masters, who has a
broken finger.
Tickets for the big game will be ."0
cents or a punch on the series paste
boards which are on sale at the grad
uate manager's oflice for $1 and are
good for the rest of the games of the
series, which may total four.
The Olympic meet will start prompt
ly at 1:30, and the Varsity game will
start immediately after, probably at
2:30 or 3 o'clock.
