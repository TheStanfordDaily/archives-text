# TOO MUCH COLD WATER
## 
### 
Too much cold water is bad for the muscles of men in training. That it
is bad for their dispositions, at least, is evidenced by the number of com
plaints coming in from athletes who are forced to take cold showers in the
absence of hot water at the men's gymnasium. A strong plea for warm
water comes from the above-mentioned athletes. When there is any hot
water at all it gives out early in the afternoon, before most of the trtick and
basball men are through with their workouts.
Here is one place where the saving of fuel, if that is the purpose, is not
the only tiling to be considered.
