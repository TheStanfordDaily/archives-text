# FROSH ON THE JOB
## 
### 
That the freshmen need to "get on the job" was demonstrated at the
track meet 011 last Saturday. The call was made for freshmen to put up
and take down the hurdles before and after those races, but no response came
until after numerous appeals for help. It has always been the custom, as
well as a duty and pleasure, for the first-year men to help out on the oval,
and now that there probably are more freshmen in the University than all
other classes put together, there is little reason for the lack of support. It
is true that there were but a few witnesses to the meet, and the absence
of freshmen may have accounted for the failure to respond. But since we
do not expect our visitors to work, each Stanford man should make himself
responsible to see that it is done, or, in the absence of freshmen, to do it
himself. It is to be hoped that the circumstances attending the last meet
will not be repeated tomorrow.
