# May Abandon English A Test in Spring Quarter
## 
### 
It is probable that there will be no
English A examination in the spring
quarter, due to the fact that only
twenty-three took the test for this
quarter. Instead of the classes being
overcrowded as usual, there are still
six vacancies. Of the twenty-three
that took the test, eight passed, eight
were recommended to English 2, and
seven failed.
