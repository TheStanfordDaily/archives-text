# Military Rally Held at Encina Hall Last Night
## 
### 
"We must look this war square in
the face. If we do not we are not fit
to inherit this land, for it will be
dominated by the Kultur and militar
ism of Germany," declared Dr. Wil
bur, when speaking before the men
gathered at the R. O. T. C. rally in
Encina Hall last night. Plenty of
"jazz" and spirit pervaded the assem
blage but the attendance of men who
are not now enrolled in the R. O. T. C.
j was not as large as it could have
I been.
Captains Parker and Volkmar, and
| Captain Short and Lieutenant Ames
! from Fremont, also addressed "the men
land emphasized the necessity of turn
ing out and supporting the R. O. T. C.
"It is up to us to make good," Dr.
| Wilbur declared. "Our safety de
i pends on the Western front. If it
j cracks, the weight of the greatest
j military machine ever devised will
! come down on us. We must think of
, winning this war in terms of men and
! boys and their lives.
"Money cannot buy the way through
| We must fight into the very heart of
! Germany," he said. "We must look
I across the water to the heroes of
j France and Italy and England and
Belgium and Scotland and Ireland,
| who are now laying down their lives
jon the battle front, and say, 'Hold on
| a little longer until we can get over
j and blast a road into the heart of
Germany.'
"It is up to you, Stanford men, to
i stand up ard get behind that line and
j prepare to fight to the last."
Captain Parker spoke well for the
! R. O. T. C. when he said that the Stan
er>rnq had the edge on any like
organization he had seen anywhere
in his travels through the country.
He emphasized the benefits of college
military training and told how he had
seen college men make good in the
First Odicers' Training Camp at Fort
Snelling and how the men who had
had previous training were immedi
ately advanced in the draft army at
Fort Dodge.
"We have the material here," he
declared, "to make this the best R. O.
T. C. in the United States. Let's get
together and do it."
Perhaps the highest compliment
ever paid to the K. O. T. C. was
spoken when Captain Short of Camp
Fremont declared that if he were to
receive orders to recruit a company
of 250 men, he would start in by tak
ing any 250 men in the Stanford R.
O. T. C. and putin the R. O. T. C.
officers as his lieutenants and non
commissioned officers. He further
declared that he "would land in
France with the best company that
ever landed there."
"You have here," he said, "the men,
instructors, location, and outlay to
make the finest military school in the
United States outside of West Point."
Lieutenant Ames told of the value
of the intensive course last spring
to him and how the fellows who had
had a whole year's work in the R. O. T.
C. had outstripped him at the training
camp. "Not a man who took the
whole year's work went to a training
camp and failed," he said.
Captain Volkmar emphasized the
fact that two and one-half million
men had been released from the East
ern front and that it is now the task of
the United States to train officers to
handle enough men to offset that num
ber. He endorsed all that had been
said by the preceding speakers and
urged the men to spread the spirit
and get more men out for military.
As the situation now stands, at least
one hundred more men must enroll
in military in order to have the
I
same number of companies as were
organized last quarter. One hundred
and fifty more men are needed to
bring the R. 0. T. C. up to its maxi
mum height of last quarter. The in
structors and leaders in the corps ex
press confidence in the seven hundred
and fifty men registered m college
and expect the military enrollment to
increase materially in the next few
days.

declared that he "would land in
France with the best company that
ever landed there."
"You have here," he said, "the men,
instructors, location, and outlay to
make the finest military school in the
United States outside of West Point."
Lieutenant Ames told of the value
of the intensive course last spring
to him and how the fellows who had
had a whole year's work in the R. O. T.
C. had outstripped him at the training
camp. "Not a man who took the
whole year's work went to a training
camp and failed," he said.
Captain Volkmar emphasized the
fact that two and one-half million
men had been released from the East
ern front and that it is now the task of
the United States to train officers to
handle enough men to offset that num
ber. He endorsed all that had been
said by the preceding speakers and
urged the men to spread the spirit
and get more men out for military.
As the situation now stands, at least
one hundred more men must enroll
in military in order to have the
I
same number of companies as were
organized last quarter. One hundred
and fifty more men are needed to
bring the R. 0. T. C. up to its maxi
mum height of last quarter. The in
structors and leaders in the corps ex
press confidence in the seven hundred
and fifty men registered m college
and expect the military enrollment to
increase materially in the next few
days.

of 250 men, he would start in by tak
