# TENNIS SQUAD WILL ELECT NEW CAPTAIN
## 
### 
On account of the absence of Cap
tain W. V. Burrill from the Stanford
tennis ranks this spring, a meeting
will be held at 12:45 p.m., Monday,
April 8, at the Sigma Chi house, for
the purpose of electing a new captain
to pilot the team against California
on April 13. *
From the present outlook, it seems
probable that the aggregation of
racketers to represent Stanford will
be chosen from the following: G. C.
Thomas, A. C. Devlin, C. S. Kegley,
C. C. .Crosby, 11. H. Iloss, W. C. Bent,
E. S. Turner, D, C. Elliott, Frank
Mendel, C. W. Doolittle, and D. N.
Barry. Ml these men are urged to
be present at the meeting.
Stanford's hopes of winning have
received a blow due to Captain Bur
rill's departure into the service. His
support was needed badly, but with a
little concentrated effort in practice
from now until the day of the tourna
ment, a team may be developed out
of the present material that will give
the Blue and Gold combination a ter
rific battle.
