# FETE IS FINANCIAL SUCCESS
## 
### 
Pinal returns from all the conces
sions at the "Nuit a Paris" have not
been completed yet but it is esti
mated that between $">OO and $000
was raised at the carnival for the
benefit of the Stanford women's unit
for civilian relief in France. In ad
dition to the cash proceeds many
pledges to the $30,000 fund were re
ceived Saturday evening.
The French fete was a big success,
and nearly one thousand persons
passed through the big gateway and
purchased tickets. Over one hundred
and sixty diners, including students,
faculty members, Stanford alumni, and
visitors from neighboring towns at
tended the cabaret supper in the
Union, which opened the celebration.
The 1921 women were in charge of
the affair and in peasant costumes
served t lie guests at small tables
lighted by orange shaded candles. D.
E. McNamee's orchestra played for
dancing between courses. Miss Angie
Cross, MS, and Miss Elizabeth Mail,
'20, appeared as cabaret entertainers,

singing and dancing among the tables.
L. L. Pickering did a clever tramp
monologue. As "Miss California"
.Miss Eleanor Anderson, '21, made her
debut to the campus as a Spanish
dancer.
After the cabaret supper the most
popular attraction was perhaps the
slide which Masquers was operating
from the balcony of the Union. Down
its slippery length shot campus celeb
rities to the supreme test of a grace
ful or humiliating landing at the bot
tom.
Nearly every visitor to the "Nuit a
Paris" succumbed to the lure of hear
ing themselves talked about to the ex
clusion of every other subject in the
gypsy village which Alpha Phi, Man
dolin Club, and Spanish Club were
in charge of. To the destruction of
coiffures and sleek brushed heads
Mrs. Crutcher read "bumps." She
was assisted by Miss Doris Estcourt,
MS, Miss .Joy Tuck, '17, Miss Ruth
Crutcher, gr., and Miss Prances Wag
ner. '21, who told fortunes by palm
lars would be paid just as to other
laborers and this would cover all
necessary living expenses.
The speakers at the assembly have
not yet been definitely docided upon.
At a committee meeting this after
noon final arrangements will be made
and the results published in tomor
row's paper. In all probability Miss
Josephine Welch, 'IS, president of
Women's Conference, will call the
meeting.

sions at the "Nuit a Paris" have not
been completed yet but it is esti
mated that between $">OO and $000
was raised at the carnival for the
benefit of the Stanford women's unit
for civilian relief in France. In ad
dition to the cash proceeds many
pledges to the $30,000 fund were re
ceived Saturday evening.
The French fete was a big success,
and nearly one thousand persons
passed through the big gateway and
purchased tickets. Over one hundred
and sixty diners, including students,
faculty members, Stanford alumni, and
visitors from neighboring towns at
tended the cabaret supper in the
Union, which opened the celebration.
The 1921 women were in charge of
the affair and in peasant costumes
served t lie guests at small tables
lighted by orange shaded candles. D.
E. McNamee's orchestra played for
dancing between courses. Miss Angie
Cross, MS, and Miss Elizabeth Mail,
'20, appeared as cabaret entertainers,

singing and dancing among the tables.
L. L. Pickering did a clever tramp
monologue. As "Miss California"
.Miss Eleanor Anderson, '21, made her
debut to the campus as a Spanish
dancer.
After the cabaret supper the most
popular attraction was perhaps the
slide which Masquers was operating
from the balcony of the Union. Down
its slippery length shot campus celeb
rities to the supreme test of a grace
ful or humiliating landing at the bot
tom.
Nearly every visitor to the "Nuit a
Paris" succumbed to the lure of hear
ing themselves talked about to the ex
clusion of every other subject in the
gypsy village which Alpha Phi, Man
dolin Club, and Spanish Club were
in charge of. To the destruction of
coiffures and sleek brushed heads
Mrs. Crutcher read "bumps." She
was assisted by Miss Doris Estcourt,
MS, Miss .Joy Tuck, '17, Miss Ruth
Crutcher, gr., and Miss Prances Wag
ner. '21, who told fortunes by palm
lars would be paid just as to other
laborers and this would cover all
necessary living expenses.
The speakers at the assembly have
not yet been definitely docided upon.
At a committee meeting this after
noon final arrangements will be made
and the results published in tomor
row's paper. In all probability Miss
Josephine Welch, 'IS, president of
Women's Conference, will call the
meeting.
