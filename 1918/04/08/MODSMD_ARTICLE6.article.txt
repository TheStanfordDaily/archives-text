# TRACK MEN WIN FROM CLUB SPEEDSTERS BY 64-62
## CHAPMAN BREAKS RECORD Result Upsets Dope—Times Are Fast Despite the Cold Weather 
### 
Upsetting all dope and bringing
cheer to the hearts of the Cardinal
j rooters, Stanford's varsity track toain
downed the Olympic Club runners last
Saturday afternoon and emerged on
the long end of a (14-62 score. The
victory entitles Stanford to posses
sion of the Ralston T. Wilbur trophy,
which was at stake for the first time
this year. The Cardinal win is espe
cially encouraging in the light of the
club men's victory over California the
week previous.
('liapiuaii Lowers Record.
Despite the adverse weather con
ditions, competition was close, and
the times made in the meet compare
very favorably with those made at
California the last week. Fulfilling
expectations, L. L. Chapman, '18,
clipped a good two seconds off his
own California-Stanford two-mile rec
ord, and didn't seem the least bit
bothered by the feat. Chapman fin
ished the long distance event in
9:47 4-5, leaving Ludwig of the Olvm
! pic Club far in the rear.
Weaver, Heath, Davis Star.
The other outstanding perform
ance of the meet was the work of
Weaver and Heath of the varsity, who
both cleared the high jumping bar at
six feet on their first attempts. E. L.
Davis ran true to form and scored
thirteen points for Stanford; he won
both hurdles and finished second to
Lieutenant Art Hutchinson in the pole
vault. Stout of the Olympic Club
demonstrated that he is undoubtedly
one of the best long-distance runners
on the Pacific coast by romping
through to a win in both the mile and
the half-mile events. Colglazier was
right on his heels in the mile, with
Wilson close behind, but Stout's
speed was too much for tl\em. Teits
worth sprinted into second place in
the half with Horn close behind.

Upsetting all dope and bringing
cheer to the hearts of the Cardinal
j rooters, Stanford's varsity track toain
downed the Olympic Club runners last
Saturday afternoon and emerged on
the long end of a (14-62 score. The
victory entitles Stanford to posses
sion of the Ralston T. Wilbur trophy,
which was at stake for the first time
this year. The Cardinal win is espe
cially encouraging in the light of the
club men's victory over California the
week previous.
('liapiuaii Lowers Record.
Despite the adverse weather con
ditions, competition was close, and
the times made in the meet compare
very favorably with those made at
California the last week. Fulfilling
expectations, L. L. Chapman, '18,
clipped a good two seconds off his
own California-Stanford two-mile rec
ord, and didn't seem the least bit
bothered by the feat. Chapman fin
ished the long distance event in
9:47 4-5, leaving Ludwig of the Olvm
! pic Club far in the rear.
Weaver, Heath, Davis Star.
The other outstanding perform
ance of the meet was the work of
Weaver and Heath of the varsity, who
both cleared the high jumping bar at
six feet on their first attempts. E. L.
Davis ran true to form and scored
thirteen points for Stanford; he won
both hurdles and finished second to
Lieutenant Art Hutchinson in the pole
vault. Stout of the Olympic Club
demonstrated that he is undoubtedly
one of the best long-distance runners
on the Pacific coast by romping
through to a win in both the mile and
the half-mile events. Colglazier was
right on his heels in the mile, with
Wilson close behind, but Stout's
speed was too much for tl\em. Teits
worth sprinted into second place in
the half with Horn close behind.

Upsetting all dope and bringing
cheer to the hearts of the Cardinal
j rooters, Stanford's varsity track toain
downed the Olympic Club runners last
Saturday afternoon and emerged on
the long end of a (14-62 score. The
victory entitles Stanford to posses
sion of the Ralston T. Wilbur trophy,
which was at stake for the first time
this year. The Cardinal win is espe
cially encouraging in the light of the
club men's victory over California the
week previous.
('liapiuaii Lowers Record.
Despite the adverse weather con
ditions, competition was close, and
the times made in the meet compare
very favorably with those made at
California the last week. Fulfilling
expectations, L. L. Chapman, '18,
clipped a good two seconds off his
own California-Stanford two-mile rec
ord, and didn't seem the least bit
bothered by the feat. Chapman fin
ished the long distance event in
9:47 4-5, leaving Ludwig of the Olvm
! pic Club far in the rear.
Weaver, Heath, Davis Star.
The other outstanding perform
ance of the meet was the work of
Weaver and Heath of the varsity, who
both cleared the high jumping bar at
six feet on their first attempts. E. L.
Davis ran true to form and scored
thirteen points for Stanford; he won
both hurdles and finished second to
Lieutenant Art Hutchinson in the pole
vault. Stout of the Olympic Club
demonstrated that he is undoubtedly
one of the best long-distance runners
on the Pacific coast by romping
through to a win in both the mile and
the half-mile events. Colglazier was
right on his heels in the mile, with
Wilson close behind, but Stout's
speed was too much for tl\em. Teits
worth sprinted into second place in
the half with Horn close behind.
