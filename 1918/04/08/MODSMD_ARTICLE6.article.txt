the times made in the meet compare
very favorably with those made at
California the last week. Fulfilling

bothered by the feat. Chapman fin

ance of the meet was the work of
Weaver and Heath of the varsity, who
both cleared the high jumping bar at
six feet on their first attempts. E. L.
Davis ran true to form and scored
thirteen points for Stanford; he won
both hurdles and finished second to
Lieutenant Art Hutchinson in the pole
