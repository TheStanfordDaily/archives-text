# Mass Meeting of Women Thursday
## Plans for Agricultural Unit To Be Discussed at Assembly Hour 
### 
Plans for an agricultural unit to be
composed of about one hundred Stan
lord women will be the subject at the
assembly this week, which will be held
for women only. The assembly will
be in the form of a mass meeting at
which informal expressions of opin
ions and ideas will be welcome.
The president of the Prune and
Apricot Growers' Association has
stated that one hundred college
women can very easily be placed to
aid in packing and canning fruit in
the Santa Clara valley this summer.
Miss Harriet Bradford and Professor
11. W. Doane have made investiga
tions and have found that there will
be great demand for labor in the com
ing season.
The plan as it now stands is to form
a unit for work throughout the fruit
season. Stanford University would
probably lie the base and the women
would go from here each day to the
ranches where they would be em
ployed. A wage of probably two dol-
reading, with cards, and by inter
preting the written hand.
From an angel chorus strumming
on harps, to "Wine, Woman, and
Song," over which Satan himself of
ficiated, the Thetas led visitors
through "Heaven and Hell." Crystal
gazing was professionally done by
Miss Francos Willis, '21.
Delta Gammas ran an artistic flor
ist's shop in the Union. Miss Jessie
Chase, '18, as manager of the Mar-,
ionette theater, pulled the strings
that brought the English Club pup
pets into affectionate embraces and
desperate encounters. G. F. Evans of
the English department read the lines
for the dumb actors.
A dreadful slaughter by crack shots
was reported by the Chi Omegas, who
ran a shooting galleryâ€”"Over / the
Top, at the Germans." The remark
able insurance offered by Alvarado
Club was taken advantage of by many
foresighted individuals. Legal auto
mobile riding after dark in Gamma
Phi Beta machines proved to be a
popular attraction.
Even the most atrocious bit of bric
a-brac at the White Elephant table
was sold when Roble's Breton Market
girls closed their stalls. Cakes, can
dies, cookies, and jellies sold rapidly.
In the salon of Madame Beaucoup
d'Argent, Kappa Models displayed
fashions which ranged from war gar
dening costumes to evening wraps.
The Pi Phi vaudeville played to a
crowded house in the Club House. A
very good bill was presented, entirely
of campus talent, with the exception
of Miss Florence Ringo of the Lom
bardi and La Scala opera companies,
who pleased the audience with her
charming voice. Miss Doris Estcourt,
'18, and partner, appeared as graceful
dancers. L. L. Pickering repeated his
tramp monologue. In attractive cos
tumes two Pi Phis made a quaint pic
ture as Pierrette and an old fashioned
girl in their dance. With real pro
fessional tang Miss Elizabeth Mail,
'20, did a song and patter act. Con
cluding the vaudeville, Miss Anne
Gardner. '19, entertained with a piano
logue.
After the concessions closed nickel
dancing until midnight completed the
entertainment.
