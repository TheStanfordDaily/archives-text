# CARDINAL WINS IN STIFF BATTLE WITH CALIFORNIA
## 
### 
Stanford's captain, one "Ken" Lilly,
and California's pitcher, Ellison by
name, tied the baseball series be
tween Stanford and tlie Blue and Gold
last Saturday on the Cardinal dia
mond. There have been hard-fought,
exciting diamond battles in the last
two years, but Saturday's fracas is
easily the leader. It was not until
the ninth inning, when Lilly found one
to bis liking, and put it out of the lot,
that Stanford won,'s to 4.
Ellison Does Poorly.
Ellison, who has one of the fastest
balls in the bushes, was the one most
responsible for the Stanford score.
The long heaver walked ten men in
his afternoon on the mound, and in
addition allowed enough balls to go
through him to bring in three Cardinal
tallies. The Stanford men took ad
vantage of bis wildness and hit him in
the fifth inning for enough runs to
win.
Lifur Shows Well.
Lifur, on the mound for the Card
inal, was in hot water several times
through his wildness, but managed
to tighten up each time and shut out
the California team.
California Scores First.
The Blue and Gold drew first blood
in the first inning. George Hensel
drew a walk, then Hudson found one
to bis liking and ended up on second
base with Hensel on third. Rowe,
the next man up, flicd out to Doe, but
Rohwer had a two-bagger up his
sleeve and brought the two runners
in. The next two men were easy outs,
and California ended with two runs.
Stanford threatened in her half of
this frame when Lilly and Harvey
walked, but Campbell and Galloway
fanned to end things.
Orchison, the first man up in the

I second, wofked Lifur for a walk, and
came in on a sacrifice by Sheppard
J and an error by Galloway at first.
Fifth-Big Inning.
Scoring activities ended after this
inning until the fifth, when Stanford
really sewed up the game. Dickey,
the first man up, walked, and prompt
ly stole second. Harvey, then dropped
one over second base and Dickey came
in. Not to be outdone, Lilly drove one
at Ellison so hard he could not handle
it and when the dust cleared away
the captain was on first with Harvey
on third. The two base runners then
worked a double steal, Harvey scor
! ing. Campbell, the next up, fanned,
but Dexter dropped the ball and was
forced to throw to first, and when the
ball was thrown to Hensel, he muffed
it and Lilly came in. Galloway, next Â»
up, singled through Ellison, stole sec
ond, went to third on a passed ball
and came in when Doe hit to right
field.
California Ties Score.
The batters went out one, two, three
in the sixth and seventh, but in the
eighth frame California tied the count.
Rowher was safe on Galloway's bad
throw, and went to second on the
play. He then stole third and came
home on a sacrifice by Orchison.
Stanford threatened in the eighth,
hut could not put it over. Then with
the count tied came the ninth and the
winning run. Dickey, second up,
walked. Harvey then sacrificed him
to second and Lilly came to bat. The
captain didn't like the first two balls,
but the third was right in, and he took
a Ty Cobb swing at it. The ball in
j its travel went over the left fielder's
i head by feet and Dickey came in. And
| thus baseball history was made for
another year.
