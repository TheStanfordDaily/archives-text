# CALIFORNIA TRACK HOPES REVIEWED FOR FINAL MEET
## CHRISTIE LIABLE TO PULL SURPRISE Captain Moody Only Blue and Gold Star—Seconds and Thirds Count 
### L.W. Dinkelspiel, '20 
Track tickets for the Stanford-
California meet next Saturday will
be placed on sale at the graduate
manager's oflice today. The paste
boards will be $1, with added war
tax of 10 cents for civilians and
50 cents with 10 cents added for
war tax for men in uniform.

When Walter Christie brings his
Blue and Gold track hopefuls onto
the Farm next Saturday afternoon,
two tilings will be noticeable, —the
great number of second and third
place men, and the conspicuous ab
sence of stars, with the possible ex
ception of Captain Moody. The Cali
fornia track squad on paper does not
appear to rank in class with the teams
that have been giving the Cardinal
close competition in the last few
years.
There is one factor, however, that
must be considered, and that is
Christie's great art of "camouflage."
For some reason or other the Cali
fornia coach always tries to keep one
or two surprises away from the eyes
of the Cardinal. In the freshman meet
li was Flirt and the sprinters; in
last year's varsity contest, it was
Moody. The only possibility of sur
prise seems to be the colored sprinter,
Purnoll, winner of the 220 last year.
Christie has kept him out of formal
competition, but Stanford men have
seen him perform and figure that the
real contest in the sprints will not be
as much with him as with his team
mate, Johnson.
It was this same Johnson who
sprang one of the surprises of the
freshman meet last year by helping his
teammate, Calden, to clean up in both
sprints. Johnson lias run the 100
yards consistently in:10 2-5 this year,
ami hovers well around in the
220. Besides Purnoll and Johnson,
Cantellow and Zobel will start in the
sprints for the Blue and Gold.
Foremost in the "eyes of the Card
inal dopesters looms the figure of
Captain Moody. Just what Moody can
do is an uncertainty; that he pos
sesses class is evidenced by his victory
over Rogers and Dievendorff last year,
and his fast time this year. His rec
ord is somewhere in the neighborhood
of :50 flat. He will probably be
counted on in both the quarter and the
half, although his late performances
seem to indicate that he is running in
a slump. His running mates-in the
quartre will probably be chosen from
Rich, Hamburg, Wolters, Olmstead,
and Sisson, although none of these
men have done anything remarkable in
competition. Acher, Chestly, Poole,
and Haskell will probably compete in
the SBO. They are all uncertainties.
It is in the longer distances that
the Blue and Gold shows its greatest
weakness. Raisner is their best bet
in the mile and may compete in the I
half, but did not trouble the Olympic
Club distance men two weeks ago.
llaskell has been showing consider
able improvement in this event.
I Humphry, although no phenoni, runs
(consistently around 10:30 in the two
mile, and is picked by Christie to
step into the point column. Packard
is the best Bruin bet in the low
hurdles; Dunn and Mohn are running
close to him. Okell is the surprise of
the year in the way in which he has
improved 'over the high barriers,
never having run the event before.
Levisoh is another lanky high-stepper
to be considered.
Turning to the field events, a Cali
fornia superiority presents itself, but
not the usual overwhelming one. Levi
son, Steen, and Frandy can all clear
over 5 feet 6 inches in the high jump,
but none of them have touched the 6
foot mark. Lambert of California has
picked up considerably this year and
can heave the hammer well over 140
feet. His teammates, Williams and
Kemp, do not loom as formidable. The
shot put promises to be wofully weak
for both teams, as Farmer, Butler.
Wells, and Meredith have not gone
beyond the 40 foot mark.
Stafford is the best bet in the pole
vault for the Berkeleyans, although he
is not credited with much over 11 feet.
Irving and Gram vault just a little
below Stafford's best. Meredith ap
pears in the broad jump as a possible
winner, being credited with something
over 21 feet. Butler, Frandy, and
Morris will jump with him.

Christie's great art of "camouflage."
For some reason or other the Cali
fornia coach always tries to keep one
or two surprises away from the eyes
of the Cardinal. In the freshman meet
li was Flirt and the sprinters; in
last year's varsity contest, it was
Moody. The only possibility of sur
prise seems to be the colored sprinter,
Purnoll, winner of the 220 last year.
Christie has kept him out of formal
competition, but Stanford men have
seen him perform and figure that the
real contest in the sprints will not be
as much with him as with his team
mate, Johnson.
It was this same Johnson who
sprang one of the surprises of the
freshman meet last year by helping his
teammate, Calden, to clean up in both
sprints. Johnson lias run the 100
yards consistently in:10 2-5 this year,
ami hovers well around in the
220. Besides Purnoll and Johnson,
Cantellow and Zobel will start in the
sprints for the Blue and Gold.
Foremost in the "eyes of the Card
inal dopesters looms the figure of
Captain Moody. Just what Moody can
do is an uncertainty; that he pos
sesses class is evidenced by his victory
over Rogers and Dievendorff last year,
and his fast time this year. His rec
ord is somewhere in the neighborhood
of :50 flat. He will probably be
counted on in both the quarter and the
half, although his late performances
seem to indicate that he is running in
a slump. His running mates-in the
quartre will probably be chosen from
Rich, Hamburg, Wolters, Olmstead,
and Sisson, although none of these
men have done anything remarkable in
competition. Acher, Chestly, Poole,
and Haskell will probably compete in
the SBO. They are all uncertainties.
It is in the longer distances that
the Blue and Gold shows its greatest
weakness. Raisner is their best bet
in the mile and may compete in the I
half, but did not trouble the Olympic
Club distance men two weeks ago.
llaskell has been showing consider
able improvement in this event.
I Humphry, although no phenoni, runs
(consistently around 10:30 in the two
mile, and is picked by Christie to
step into the point column. Packard
is the best Bruin bet in the low
hurdles; Dunn and Mohn are running
close to him. Okell is the surprise of
the year in the way in which he has
improved 'over the high barriers,
never having run the event before.
Levisoh is another lanky high-stepper
to be considered.
Turning to the field events, a Cali
fornia superiority presents itself, but
not the usual overwhelming one. Levi
son, Steen, and Frandy can all clear
over 5 feet 6 inches in the high jump,
but none of them have touched the 6
foot mark. Lambert of California has
picked up considerably this year and
can heave the hammer well over 140
feet. His teammates, Williams and
Kemp, do not loom as formidable. The
shot put promises to be wofully weak
for both teams, as Farmer, Butler.
Wells, and Meredith have not gone
beyond the 40 foot mark.
Stafford is the best bet in the pole
vault for the Berkeleyans, although he
is not credited with much over 11 feet.
Irving and Gram vault just a little
below Stafford's best. Meredith ap
pears in the broad jump as a possible
winner, being credited with something
over 21 feet. Butler, Frandy, and
Morris will jump with him.
Track tickets for the Stanford-
California meet next Saturday will
be placed on sale at the graduate
manager's oflice today. The paste
boards will be $1, with added war
tax of 10 cents for civilians and
50 cents with 10 cents added for
war tax for men in uniform.

When Walter Christie brings his
Blue and Gold track hopefuls onto
the Farm next Saturday afternoon,
two tilings will be noticeable, —the
great number of second and third
place men, and the conspicuous ab
sence of stars, with the possible ex
ception of Captain Moody. The Cali
fornia track squad on paper does not
appear to rank in class with the teams
that have been giving the Cardinal

220. Besides Purnoll and Johnson,
Cantellow and Zobel will start in the
sprints for the Blue and Gold.
Foremost in the "eyes of the Card
inal dopesters looms the figure of
Captain Moody. Just what Moody can
do is an uncertainty; that he pos
sesses class is evidenced by his victory
over Rogers and Dievendorff last year,
and his fast time this year. His rec
ord is somewhere in the neighborhood
of :50 flat. He will probably be
counted on in both the quarter and the
half, although his late performances
seem to indicate that he is running in
a slump. His running mates-in the
quartre will probably be chosen from
Rich, Hamburg, Wolters, Olmstead,
and Sisson, although none of these
men have done anything remarkable in
competition. Acher, Chestly, Poole,
and Haskell will probably compete in
the SBO. They are all uncertainties.
It is in the longer distances that
the Blue and Gold shows its greatest
weakness. Raisner is their best bet
in the mile and may compete in the I
half, but did not trouble the Olympic
Club distance men two weeks ago.
llaskell has been showing consider
able improvement in this event.
I Humphry, although no phenoni, runs
(consistently around 10:30 in the two
mile, and is picked by Christie to
step into the point column. Packard
is the best Bruin bet in the low
hurdles; Dunn and Mohn are running
close to him. Okell is the surprise of
the year in the way in which he has
improved 'over the high barriers,
never having run the event before.
Levisoh is another lanky high-stepper
to be considered.
Turning to the field events, a Cali
fornia superiority presents itself, but
not the usual overwhelming one. Levi
son, Steen, and Frandy can all clear
over 5 feet 6 inches in the high jump,
but none of them have touched the 6
foot mark. Lambert of California has
picked up considerably this year and
can heave the hammer well over 140
feet. His teammates, Williams and
Kemp, do not loom as formidable. The
shot put promises to be wofully weak
for both teams, as Farmer, Butler.
Wells, and Meredith have not gone
beyond the 40 foot mark.
Stafford is the best bet in the pole
vault for the Berkeleyans, although he
is not credited with much over 11 feet.
Irving and Gram vault just a little
below Stafford's best. Meredith ap
pears in the broad jump as a possible
winner, being credited with something
over 21 feet. Butler, Frandy, and
Morris will jump with him.
