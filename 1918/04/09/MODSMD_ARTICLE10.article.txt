# MORENO URGES SAVING OF WHEAT PRODUCTS
## 
### 
Stanford's food administrator, Pro
fessor H. C. Moreno, is laying before
the various living groups 011 the cam
pus the great necessity of complying
with the recent orders issued by the
United States Food Administration.
These orders ask the people of the
country to conserve wheat products
even more than heretofore, and Pro
fessor Moreno is working to make
the campus realize why they must
be followed, and the condition which
necessitated their issuance.
The orders issued by the Food Ad
ministration ask that the people of the
country cut their consumption of
wheat products in two. This means
that each person must use only ap
proximately one and one-half pounds
of wheat products per week, or little
more than a 15 cent loaf of Liberty
bread.
The Food Administration announces
tliat this reduction in consumption of
wheat products is absolutely essen
tial in order to maintain the wheat
exports that are necessary to feed the
soldiers and the civilian population of
our allies as well as our own army.
The Food Administration further
announces that unless the people com
ply with the order the government
will take over the wheat products
and allow absolutely none of them 011
the market whatsoever.
The larger hotels of the country
have gone farther than has been asked
by the government, and are going to
eliminate the use of wheat in their
menus absolutely.
T'ie two following rules of the Food
Administration's order are of special
interest te consumers of wheat prod
ucts:
"1. Householders to use not to ex
ceed a total of one and one-half
pounds of cooking, flour, mactaroni,
per person. This means not more
than one and three-quarter pounds of
Victory bread containing the required
percentage of substitutes and one-half
pound of cooking flaur, macaroni,
crackers, paslry, pies, cakes, wheat
breakfast cereals all combined.
"2. Public eating places and clubs
to observe two wheatless days per
week, Monday and Wednesday, as at
present. In addition thereto, not to
serve to any one guest at any one
meal an aggregation of breadstuff's,
macaroni, crackers, pastry, pies,
cakes, or wheat breakfast cereals con
taining a total of more than two
ounces of wheat flour. No wheat prod
ucts to be served unless specially or
dered.
"With the arrival of harvest we
should be able to relax such restric
tions; until then we ask for the neces
sary patience, sacrifice, and co-opera
tion."
Professor Moreno, in commenting
011 the situation, says:"The French
government has again cut its rations
to its soldiers. When the French go
back of the lines for a rest after the
terrible fighting now going on, they
will turn to their American comrades
and say 'America promised to feod
us. Why does it not send food?" The
American soldiers have no other an
swer than that the Americans at home
are consuming the food instead of
sending it to France. We must either
sacrifice blood or bread, and since
we can sacrifice wheat products, we
must comply with the government's
demand if we are to win the war."

wheat products in two. This means
that each person must use only ap
proximately one and one-half pounds
of wheat products per week, or little
more than a 15 cent loaf of Liberty
bread.
The Food Administration announces
tliat this reduction in consumption of
wheat products is absolutely essen
tial in order to maintain the wheat
exports that are necessary to feed the
soldiers and the civilian population of
our allies as well as our own army.
The Food Administration further
announces that unless the people com
ply with the order the government
will take over the wheat products
and allow absolutely none of them 011
the market whatsoever.
The larger hotels of the country
have gone farther than has been asked
by the government, and are going to
eliminate the use of wheat in their
menus absolutely.
T'ie two following rules of the Food
Administration's order are of special
interest te consumers of wheat prod
ucts:
"1. Householders to use not to ex
ceed a total of one and one-half
pounds of cooking, flour, mactaroni,
per person. This means not more
than one and three-quarter pounds of
Victory bread containing the required
percentage of substitutes and one-half
pound of cooking flaur, macaroni,
crackers, paslry, pies, cakes, wheat
breakfast cereals all combined.
"2. Public eating places and clubs
to observe two wheatless days per
week, Monday and Wednesday, as at
present. In addition thereto, not to
serve to any one guest at any one
meal an aggregation of breadstuff's,
macaroni, crackers, pastry, pies,
cakes, or wheat breakfast cereals con
taining a total of more than two
ounces of wheat flour. No wheat prod
ucts to be served unless specially or
dered.
"With the arrival of harvest we
should be able to relax such restric
tions; until then we ask for the neces
sary patience, sacrifice, and co-opera
tion."
Professor Moreno, in commenting
011 the situation, says:"The French
government has again cut its rations
to its soldiers. When the French go
back of the lines for a rest after the
terrible fighting now going on, they
will turn to their American comrades
and say 'America promised to feod
us. Why does it not send food?" The
American soldiers have no other an
swer than that the Americans at home
are consuming the food instead of
sending it to France. We must either
sacrifice blood or bread, and since
we can sacrifice wheat products, we
must comply with the government's
demand if we are to win the war."
Stanford's food administrator, Pro
fessor H. C. Moreno, is laying before
the various living groups 011 the cam
pus the great necessity of complying
with the recent orders issued by the
United States Food Administration.
These orders ask the people of the
country to conserve wheat products
even more than heretofore, and Pro
fessor Moreno is working to make
the campus realize why they must
be followed, and the condition which
necessitated their issuance.
