# MORENO URGES SAVING OF WHEAT PRODUCTS
## 
### 
Stanford's food administrator, Pro
fessor H. C. Moreno, is laying before
the various living groups 011 the cam
pus the great necessity of complying
with the recent orders issued by the
United States Food Administration.
These orders ask the people of the
country to conserve wheat products
even more than heretofore, and Pro
fessor Moreno is working to make
the campus realize why they must
be followed, and the condition which
necessitated their issuance.
The orders issued by the Food Ad
ministration ask that the people of the
country cut their consumption of
wheat products in two. This means
that each person must use only ap
proximately one and one-half pounds
of wheat products per week, or little
more than a 15 cent loaf of Liberty
bread.
The Food Administration announces
tliat this reduction in consumption of
wheat products is absolutely essen
tial in order to maintain the wheat
exports that are necessary to feed the
soldiers and the civilian population of
our allies as well as our own army.
The Food Administration further
announces that unless the people com
ply with the order the government
will take over the wheat products
and allow absolutely none of them 011
the market whatsoever.
The larger hotels of the country
have gone farther than has been asked
by the government, and are going to
eliminate the use of wheat in their
menus absolutely.
T'ie two following rules of the Food
Administration's order are of special
interest te consumers of wheat prod
