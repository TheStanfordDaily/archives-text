# CARDINAL WRESTLERS TO MEET CALIFORNIA
## Team Picked by Coach Wise to Oppose Blue and Gold Mat Artists 
### 
Cardinal wrestlers are ready to
meet their Blue and Gold opponents
in the Stanford-California wrestling
tournament to be held at Berkeley to
morrow night.
Stanford will send a strong aggre
gation to Berkeley, and Coach Wise
predicts a close victory for the Car
dinal mat artists. Chances that Stan
ford will capture the 115-pound and
145-pound matches loom up exception
ally bright, with such veterans as
Bgami and Jones, respectively, rep
resenting Stanford in these events.
Egami has been showing up well
during the whole season. He was 115-
pouiul champion last year and won
from his California opponent, so
should have no trouble in winning his
match. Jones was last year's 115-
pound champion, and should be a
strong contender.
Seely has been doing good work in
the 158-pound class, and the other
Cardinal wrestlers are showing up
equally strong.
The following men have been picked
by Coach Wise to bring home the
Bruin's steak:
108-pohnd class, N. Kakimoto, '20;
115-pound class, H. E. Egami, '20;
135-pound class, T. Oyama, '20; 145-
pound class, P. 11. Jones, '18; 158-
pound class, C. It. Seely, '20; 175-
pound light-heavyweight class, O. K.
Coonse, '20.
