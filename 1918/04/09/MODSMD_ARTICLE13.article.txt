Undoubtedly the Stanford student body will agree wholeheartedly with
the action of the Board of Athletic Control in abolishing intercollegiate con
tests, for at a time like the present there seems to be no other alternative.
Many large universities have seen the need and have responded to it with
like actions. Yale, Harvard, and numerous other eastern colleges have in
dulged in no formal intercollegiate contests since the beginning of the war,
and we are glad to see Stanford sacrifice athletics to the support ol the gov
ernment and the more vigorous prosecution of the war.
Time spent in preparation for large intercollegiate contests might be
much more profitably spent in preparation -for the duties devolving upon us
as a result of the war. Each one of us who feels regret at the loss of big
games and the detrimental effect the action will undoubtedly have on ath
letics in Stanford, at the same time realizes its necessity. It should be more
with a feeling of pride than regret that we subordinate sports to military
preparation and support of the government.
Abolition of intercollegiate contests is not only a patriotic duty bu a
financial necessity. With the decrease in registration in the University there
has been a consequent falling oft' in the interest, and lack of attendance at
games. From present indications it would be impossible for athletics to sup
port themselves, and even if they could, it is almost criminal to spend money
for such things when it is so badly needed in other channels. Not only are
time and money wasted, but also materials needed elsewhere. For example,
does it not seem unwise to use wool, which is exceedingly scarce, lor sweat
ers for athletes who may possess numerous others, when our soldiers may be
freezing? . „
No contracts are being violated by the action taken, since Santa Clara
has made a similar ruling in regard to athletics, and it seems probable that
California will do likewise.
The question is raised in the minds'of many as to how the student body
can be supported without athletics. There should be 110 falling off in the
sale of student body tickets as a result, for now, more than ever, member
ship will be needed. Let the student body not fail to support its organization
in the time of need and we will look forward to better and bigger sports after
the war, and the most recent indications point toward such an outlook.
