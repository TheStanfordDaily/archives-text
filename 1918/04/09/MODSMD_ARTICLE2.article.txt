# ART GALLERY TO SHOW PICTURES OF THE WAR
## Will Exhibit Masterpieces of French and American Painters 
### 
Etchings and lithographs will be
offered as the next attraction at the
Art Museum. The exhibition should
have been up Sunday, but due to the
necessity for frames which have not
arrived, the collection has not yet
been put up. These pictures will be
of special interest in subject matter
as events and topics connected with
the war have been used. A number
of the most prominent artists in this
field of work will be represented.
As an added attraction, the loan col
lection of Francis J. Miles will be of
fered. Two French artists are nota
ble, Arnold Marc Gorter and Francis
Cachoud. The first of these is famed
for his remarkable talent in compos
ing his pictures. The second is a
landscapist of high order in France,
possessing a regularity in technique
which in no way detracts from the
variety of his pictures. Many of Ca
choud's canvases are known for their
wonderful portrayal of moonlight and
nightfall.
Besides these artists, some well
known American painters are exhib
ited, including George Innes and A.
M. Corter. A beautiful canvas of
George Ames Aldrirh has attracted
considerable attention and is partic
ularly noteworthy for the delicacy
with which he has handled his sub
ject.
