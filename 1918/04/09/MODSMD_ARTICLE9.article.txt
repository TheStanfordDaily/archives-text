# DROPS MAJOR SPORTS
## WAR IS CAUSE FOR ACTION Members of Board Make Announcement of Reasons 
### 
Intercollegiate contests and major
sports have gone by the boards until
the conclusion of the war, according
to an announcement given out by the
Board of Athletic Control last night.
The action does not affect the present
schedule with California, but after the
big meet there will be 110 more com
petition in football, baseball, basket
ball, or track until military opera
tions permit.
Statement (â– liven (hit.
The statement as given out says:
"ltesolved, that no new intercollegiate
agreement or contest be entered into
by Stanford University, until military
operations permit." The resolution
was adopted at the meeting of the
Board of Athletic Control last Fri
day, but the action was just made
public.
Ih*. Wilbur Explains.
Dr. Wilbur, in commenting on the
action of the Board last night said:
"It seemed best to the Board and my
self that all energies be put to war
activities at present since it is our
prime duty to win. Interest in sports
is gradually dying on the campus, and
some action was necessary. The reso
lution is aimed at the major sports,
but there will continue to be compe
tition in the minor sports."
With the announcement that the
Cardinal had given up sports for the
war, came the further statement that
Stanford would, in all probability, re
sume full athletic relations with the

university oi California at the con
clusion of hostilities abroad. In a
statement given out in San Francisco
yesterday, It. W. Barrett, chairman of
the Board of Athletic Control, said:
"There is little doubt but that we will
resume full relations with the Univer
sity of California as soon as the war
is over. Meanwhile the war situa
tion justifies the resolution. We must
win the war first."
The arrangement with California
for the resumption of football rela
tions will probably be 011 the basis of
two games, one Rugby and one Amer
ican as proposed in the resolution
sent across the bay some time ago.
Professor Mitchell gave out the fol
lowing statement:
"The Board of Athletic Control has
dec ided not to make any intercollegi
ate agreements until the war situa
tion justifies. As long as the war
makes conditions as they are at the
present time, we are not justified in
bringing ourselves into any intercol
legiate agreement.
"This does not mean that there will
necessarily be 110 athletics. If condi
tions next year warrant athletics we
will arrange for them when the time
comes.
"The men are not in college to take
part or support athletics. There is 110
interest taken in athletics. We do not
support them and we cannot ask the
public to. for they should be giving
money to the government."
