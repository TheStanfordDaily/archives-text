# RIVAL VARSITIES WILL CROSS BATS FOR THIRD TIME
## GAME TO BE AT 10 A. M. Cardinals Can Take Lead in Series By Winning Contest 
### 
Stanford will be given another op
portunity to ttvist the Golden Bear's
tail Saturday morning when the base
ball varsities of the two universities
hook up in their third diamond battle
of a five-game series. Play will start
promptly at 10 o'clock in the morn
ing and will act as a preliminary to
the big track meet in the afternoon.
Stanford should win the third game.
Lllison, California's best bet 011 the
mound, has already demonstrated his
inability to hold the Cardinal hitters
while Lifur lias been getting better
as the series has progressed. In ad
dition, the Varsity players will be
cavorting around 011 their own dia
mond, and this should help things
along.
The Blue and Gold may endeavor
to "camouflage" the Cardinal by start
ing a new man on the mound. Ellison
has no hook and in case a curve ball
the Varsity for several innings. Since
Lilly's swat in the ninth inning of the
last game, California is on the defen
sive, however, and this fact will work
in Stanford's favor.
Stanford will put the same lineup in
the field that started in both other
games, with Campbell behind the bat,
Lifur in the box, Davis on first, Doe
at second, Galloway on short, Dickey
on third, and Lilly, Wayland, and Har
vey in the outfield.
Ticket? for the big fracas will be 50
cents, with soldiers passing for 25.
Hildebrand, umpire in the first two
contests, will again call the balls and
strikes.
