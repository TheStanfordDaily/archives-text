Each one of us has heard the query, especially from members of the
weaker sex, "What can I do to help win the war?" Nearly every one wants
to go over seas to minister to the wounded or to help the destitute. This
fact was evidenced hy the number of women who applied for membership
in the Stanford women's unit. There are few who can serve in France, but
there is a need at home that is just as real and just as insistent, though per
haps not as romantic, as the need for women abroad.
This fact will be brought home to Stanford women tomorrow, when
speakers in direct connection with nation-wide food movements, will discuss
the problem here in the Santa Clara valley. There will be a demand for
harvesters that will have to be satisfied by women. College women should
be the first to respond, for they should be the examples for others to follow.
The problem to be discussed at tomorrow's assembly is certainly a timely
one, and the least each woman who aims to serve her country can do is to
attend the meeting to give and to receive suggestions for definite work.
