## 
### 
Herbert C. Hoover's home, which is
to be erected 011 San Juan Hill, will
not. be built until after the war. Plans
for the building have been drawn by
Architect Louis Mulgardt, but it was
a misstatement that the bouse was to
be started soon. Mrs. Hoover stated
that an exaggerated idea of the style
of the home had been formed, that it
is to be no mansion, but a simple
country home. It is not in conform
ity with Mr. Hoover's conservation
theories to consider building during
the war, hence it will probably be
some time before the presidential
mansion has a companion structure on
the hill.
