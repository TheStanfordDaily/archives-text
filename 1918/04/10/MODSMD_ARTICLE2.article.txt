## Noted Belgian Illustrates Talk With Pictures of German Atrocities 
### 
"Germans in Belgium" was the sub
ject of a talk in the Little Theater
last evening by Professor Victor
Horta. Professor Horta is a Belgian,
having been for twenty years con
nected with the University of Brus
sels, and before the war appointed
director of the Royal School of 1* ine
Arts in Brussels. He comes to this
country as a Norton memorial lec
turer.
By means of lantern slides he
showed scenes of the devastation
which had been wrought in his native
country, and cartoons with which the
German government deceived the peo
ple, and molded German public opin
ion.
These pictures and cartoons were
shown in Germany to explain every
thing, he said. When the great im
perial army was held back by a hand
ful of Belgians, the German people
were told by means of these cartoons
that the army was merely resting be
fore proceeding further. Throughout
all the pictures, Germany is shown as
desiring peace, and yet being forced
into war by the selfish and grasping
nations of England and France.
Professor Horta showed photo
graphs of the beautiful universities
of Belgium which had been destroyed.
"The destruction of these universi
ties was a necessity," he said, "for
the Germans wished to keep the in
dustrial supremacy of the world, and
feared that Holland and Belgium
would rise above them."
In order to explain to the German
people why their soldiers had de
stroyed universities and cathedrals,
the government circulated post cards
and cartoons throughout the country
showing large French guns hidden
behind cathedrals, and some even
showed the English building large ca
thedrals on their warships.
"We used to fight as gentlemen,"
Professor ITorta stated; "now we fight
like thieves and murderers. If I had
not seen it with my own eyes, I would
never believe that any so-called civ
ilized nation could stoop so low as to
commit the awful atrocities of which
the Germans are guilty."
