# Wrestling Match With California Is Called Off
## 
### 
Contrary to previous reports, there
will not be a regular varsity wrestling
match between Stanford and Cali
fornia. Last winter the Pacific Coast
Conference, of which both Stanford
and California are members, put
wrestling on the accredited list.
There is a ruling of the Conference
which forbids freshmen from com
peting in accredited contests. This
of course means that freshmen can
not compete in wrestling. However,
without freshmen, Stanford cannot
enter a team in which all the weight
divisions will be represented. With
out freshmen Stanford has not a com
plete varsity team and so it is ob
viously impossible to have a varsity
wrestling contest with California. If
the meet should be held, there could
be no emblems awarded, for such an
action would break Conference rules.
The wrestlers have written to Cali
fornia to see if tliey can arrange
for an informal meet to be held here
at Stanford. If this is done, Stan
ford can use freshmen, and thus
enter a full team. An answer is ex
pected tonight.
This ruling of the Pacific Coast
Conference does not affect boxing,
swimming, or tennis, because these are
not accredited sports.
