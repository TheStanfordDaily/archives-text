# CHAPMAN DECLARES TRACK PROSPECTS ARE ENCOURAGING
## 
### 
Ten minutes has always been consid
ered fast time in the two-mile and in
I most of the past big meets, times
' were slower. Samis will be fresh in
this event and can run in 10 minutes
E. L. Davis will probably win both
hurdle races in good time, although
not in the sensational form of Murray
or House. Irrespective of war condi
tions, one cannot expect to have such
men all the time. Both Weaver and
Heath have been jumping six feet and
this is certainly good varsity height.
The relay will be as strong as ever,
i Davis will 110 doubt win both the hur
| dies and the pole vault, and then make
it 1G 1-2 points by running a relay lap.
McClosky will be fresh and can easily
beat 53 seconds, while Dinkelspiel
did 52 4-5 with ease last night. May
nard will run his second quarter of
the day in the relay and it may be
against Moody again. We may win
the meet with 70 points withftut the [
relay, but we probably will win that 1
event too.
Trainer Ray Haig has done well, as
is evidenced by the splendid condi
tion of every man on the squad. "Dad"
Folsom lias shown the genuine fight
ing Stanford spirit throughout the en- j
tire season. Rain or shine, he has al- !
ways been on the job, and much of
(he team's present strength is due to [
his efforts.
We should have a large crowd out
Saturday for many reasons, but chief-j
ly for this: the squad has worked I
without a coach all season and under
great handicap. Genuine love of the '
game and Stanford spirit are going I
up against a highly paid professional j
coach and a much larger institution. 1
We have the smallest squad 011 record
of recent years, but give us lots of
support and help us to make it "six
straight," for "Over the top" will j
probably be the next contest!
