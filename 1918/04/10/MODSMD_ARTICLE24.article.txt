According to an announcement
made by Captain Parker of the Stan
for R. O. T. C. all men taking military
training will occupy a section in the
bleachers at the track meet Saturday.
All military students are requested
to bring the price of admission, $1,
with them to drill on Thursday, when
they may purchase their tickets.
Captain Parker's idea is to have all
the military men together and show
what a rooting section the military
men can make. A large crowd is ex
pected to be on hand for the meet, as
Graduate Manager H. S. Pettingill
announces a large sale of tickets.
