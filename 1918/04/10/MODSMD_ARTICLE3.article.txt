# Campus Barflies Will Go Thirsty Redwood Is Dry
## 
### 
The citizens of Redwood City have
distinguished themselves as recruit
ins agents. War may be what Sher
man said it was, but campus tanks
certainly think it better than exist
ence near a dry Redwood. The well
known watering place has gone dry,
and after July 1 John Barleycorn must
seek shelter elsewhere. After that
date the sororities will miss the noisy,
homecomings of the late revelers
from English Club, Hammer and Cof
fin, Economics Club, Ram's Head, V.
M. C. A., etc. No longer will one be
awakened at 2 a.m. by the unharmo
nious "I was drunk last night."
Any one singing this well-known
ditty will probably face the penalty
of the gallows, or Men's Conference,
for no longer will tliey be able to send
communications to the regular in
dulgers and patrons of Anne Arbor,
etc., after a night of reckless thirst
quenching.
It used to be "I've trod the road to
Menlo," but this was changed to "I've
taken the train to Redwood," and now
it will be "I've gone by stage to Bel
mont," and Belmont is four miles be
yond Redwood, but men will go far
for a drink if the S. P. will only fix
tho trnino.
