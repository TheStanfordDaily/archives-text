# TRACK CHANCES ARE GOOD
## Chapman Declares Team up to Standard 
### L. L. Chapman, '18 
The last big track and baseball rally until after the close of the war
will be held at the Tlieta Delta Chi house tomorrow night. Captains
Chapman and Lilly will speak and possibly "Dad" Folsom and Dr. Angell.
"Let every man on the campus get out and make this last rally the biggest,
of the year and let's end our athletic season by winning the last two
| major contests with California before the close of the war," was the exhor
| tation which Yell Leader George Luhrs, '18, made this afternoon.

spiel should win the 220 for he did it
in 22 3-5 seconds Saturday with ease,
which is one full second better than
Christie's "dark horse," Purnoll, did
in last year's meet.
Both Maynard and Moody are in the
same class with the famous Todd and
Chase. The quarter will be a fifty
fifty race, with the winner depending
largely on who has the pole. This may
be the best race of the day, unless
Moody runs the BSO instead of the
relay, In which case the half-mile will
supplant the quarter for premier hon
ors. Teitsworth, McPherson, and
Horn are going to run the SBO only,
and, as all are capable of close to two
minutes, the Saturday may be
1:59 or better. "Skin" Wilson and
Aupperle never have beaten this time
and two of the remarkable Bonnett's
races were won in over two minutes.

past three years, two were won in
over 4:30. We have three men who
can run in the neighborhood of 4:30.

Public opinion may think that the
varsity track squad this year is rather
mediocre as compared with those of
the past. Let's see. AVe do not claim
stars in all the events, but we never
had them in all events, even in"the
pood old days." Every year there
have been one or two "open events,"
and this year they are probably the
shot-put and the broad jump. We had
a man of varsity caliber in Linn, but
he was unfortunate and is crippled at
present. Weitzel, Lyon, and Nagel
must not be forgotten. Curtice has
been heaving the hammer out in win
ning form, but he has trouble staying
in the ring. Coonse may spring a sur
prise here.
Such men as "Ken" Lilly will be
able to demonstrate fighting spirit,
desnite the handicap of both running
the ball team find tn«>. hmi yatua m
flat. This doesn't look as if red blood
is absent on the campus. Dinkel
spiel, Maynard, and B. F. Davis are a
fine bunch of century men. Dinkel
bination has shown any decided ad
vantage so far and so it is question
able which combination will step onto
the courts for Stanford this Friday.
As far as the singles part of the tour
nament is concerned there is very
little doubt who will play for the Car
dinal. Captain Bent is almost cer
tain to play, but the other man is
still an uncertainty.
As in previous years, there will be
two singles and two doubles matches
and the team will be composed of four
or five of the best Stanford has to
offer if it is possible to choose the
best in so short a time.

spiel, Maynard, and B. F. Davis are a
fine bunch of century men. Dinkel

As far as the singles part of the tour

little doubt who will play for the Car
dinal. Captain Bent is almost cer
tain to play, but the other man is
still an uncertainty.
As in previous years, there will be
two singles and two doubles matches
and the team will be composed of four
or five of the best Stanford has to
offer if it is possible to choose the
best in so short a time.
The last big track and baseball rally until after the close of the war
will be held at the Tlieta Delta Chi house tomorrow night. Captains
Chapman and Lilly will speak and possibly "Dad" Folsom and Dr. Angell.
"Let every man on the campus get out and make this last rally the biggest,
of the year and let's end our athletic season by winning the last two

spiel should win the 220 for he did it
in 22 3-5 seconds Saturday with ease,
which is one full second better than
Christie's "dark horse," Purnoll, did
in last year's meet.
Both Maynard and Moody are in the
same class with the famous Todd and
Chase. The quarter will be a fifty
fifty race, with the winner depending
largely on who has the pole. This may
be the best race of the day, unless
Moody runs the BSO instead of the
relay, In which case the half-mile will
supplant the quarter for premier hon
ors. Teitsworth, McPherson, and
Horn are going to run the SBO only,
and, as all are capable of close to two
minutes, the Saturday may be
1:59 or better. "Skin" Wilson and
Aupperle never have beaten this time
and two of the remarkable Bonnett's
races were won in over two minutes.

over 4:30. We have three men who
can run in the neighborhood of 4:30.

Public opinion may think that the
varsity track squad this year is rather
mediocre as compared with those of
the past. Let's see. AVe do not claim
stars in all the events, but we never
had them in all events, even in"the
pood old days." Every year there
have been one or two "open events,"
and this year they are probably the
shot-put and the broad jump. We had
a man of varsity caliber in Linn, but
he was unfortunate and is crippled at
present. Weitzel, Lyon, and Nagel
must not be forgotten. Curtice has
been heaving the hammer out in win
