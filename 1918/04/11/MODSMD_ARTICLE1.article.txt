## THE 						AGRICULTURAL UNIT PLAN DISCUSSED Wilbur Tells War Necessity for More Food—Others Outline Campaign 
### 
"America was at first confused over
the issues ol ? the war; but now she is
thrown on the center of the stage.
The question that all Europe is ask
ing now is, are we too late to save the
situation?" This was the issue put
before the women of Stanford at the
assembly this morning by Dr. Wilbur.
"We have not had the imagination
to understand the situation," he con
tinued. "This is the most momentous
era since the birth of Christ. The
issues of this war are clearly under
stood by the men in the trenches and
they are willing to fight for
them only as long as they have
the one thing which will win
this war—food! The Allies are
willing to hold the lines, are willing
to sacrifice their men, are willing to
do anything within human power
while we are getting ready, «Dut in this
interval they expect us to keep them
from starvation and famine."
"The only way we can get the food
for those hungry nations," Dr. Wil
bur pointed out, "is by the hearty and
sincere cooperation of the people oi
the United States in the program of
food conservation sent out by the gov
ernment. The women of America
must shoulder the responsibility of
this highly important task and as the
soldiers at home 'go over the top.'
"Not one woman must be unable to
say that she has done all that she
could, while our men are fighting, as
her share," Dr. Wilbur concluded.
Miss Margaret Shedd, *20, was the
next speaker on the program. Miss
Shedd spoke of the proposition con
cerning the agricultural unit to work
in the Santa Clara valley composed
nf Stanford women. The
tremendous need for labor was shown
by the tact that a man representing
one packing association said that he
could ~ nf lbO women
during the four months of the sum
mer vacation. Miss Shedd went on to
explain the nature of the work, pick
ing, cutting, and sorting the fruit a«
well as the physical difficulties to be
met.
The concluding speaker of the
morning was Miss Jane Ebbets, tem
porary chairman of the Women's Land
Army of America for northern Cali
fornia. Miss Ebbets explained that
this movement was more or less under
the direct patronage though not con
nected with the Women's Committee
of National Defense. The success of
the Vassar College women as well as
the numerous other examples of tins
work was spoken of.
The units are to be composed of
women from all parts and occupations
of the country, ranging from twenty
to seventy women in an organization.
Each group will have a captain, an
older woman of considerable experi
ence, who will supervise the purchas
ing and consumption of food used by
the unit. Each woman will be ex
pected to remain with the unit at
least a month and a living wage will
Ixs paid during that time.
The land army will have central
headquarters in both the northern
and southern parts of California under
which all units formed for the work
will be placed. The whole organiza
tion will be run under the most ef
ficient methods possible. Next Mon
day cards will be handed out to Stan
ford women, to be signed with the
amount of work pledged tor the sum
mer.
Miss Josephine Welch presided over

"America was at first confused over
the issues ol ? the war; but now she is
thrown on the center of the stage.
The question that all Europe is ask
ing now is, are we too late to save the
situation?" This was the issue put
before the women of Stanford at the
assembly this morning by Dr. Wilbur.
"We have not had the imagination
to understand the situation," he con
tinued. "This is the most momentous
era since the birth of Christ. The
issues of this war are clearly under
stood by the men in the trenches and
they are willing to fight for
them only as long as they have
the one thing which will win
this war—food! The Allies are
willing to hold the lines, are willing
to sacrifice their men, are willing to
do anything within human power
while we are getting ready, «Dut in this
interval they expect us to keep them
from starvation and famine."
"The only way we can get the food
for those hungry nations," Dr. Wil
bur pointed out, "is by the hearty and
sincere cooperation of the people oi
the United States in the program of
food conservation sent out by the gov
ernment. The women of America
must shoulder the responsibility of
this highly important task and as the
soldiers at home 'go over the top.'
"Not one woman must be unable to
say that she has done all that she
could, while our men are fighting, as
her share," Dr. Wilbur concluded.
Miss Margaret Shedd, *20, was the
next speaker on the program. Miss
Shedd spoke of the proposition con
cerning the agricultural unit to work
in the Santa Clara valley composed
nf Stanford women. The
tremendous need for labor was shown
by the tact that a man representing
one packing association said that he
could ~ nf lbO women
during the four months of the sum
mer vacation. Miss Shedd went on to
explain the nature of the work, pick
ing, cutting, and sorting the fruit a«
well as the physical difficulties to be
met.
The concluding speaker of the
morning was Miss Jane Ebbets, tem
porary chairman of the Women's Land
Army of America for northern Cali
fornia. Miss Ebbets explained that
this movement was more or less under
the direct patronage though not con
nected with the Women's Committee
of National Defense. The success of
the Vassar College women as well as
the numerous other examples of tins
work was spoken of.
