## 
###

California varsity, scheduled for to
morrow, will be postponed until April
19, the date originally set for the fray,
according to an announcement made
today by Graduate Manager H. S. Pet
tingill.

ford racket wielders to round into
form and develop much needed team
work in the doubles department of
the game. From the present outlook
Captain W. C. Bent, '19, A. C. Devlin,
'20, and D. N. Barry, '20, look best in
singles, while Barry and C. W. Doo
little, '20, have worked together to
good advantage in doubles, but little

tennis situation as it now stands.
