# A 						MILE OF DIMES FOR BELGIAN RELIEF
## 
### 
Dimes by the mile is a new form of
counting money. It is a method adopt
ed by the Delta Gamma sorority for
raising funds for Belgian relief. A
mile of dimes will mean $10,000, and
this will care for many Belgian babies,
Delta Gamma's special department in
war work. The mile is divided into
feet, each foot measured by a card
board which has slits to contain sev
enteen climes. Anyone wishing to own
a dime's worth or a foot of a Belgian
mile may buy his share from a Delta
Gamma.
