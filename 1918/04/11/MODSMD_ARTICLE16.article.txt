# NOT AS BAD AS IT LOOKS
## 
### 
The Daily Palo Alto wishes to call the attention of the reader to the
statement of its financial status in this issue. Contrary to an opinion that is
more or less general on the campus, the Daily has not been a hurden upon
the student body or upon athletics. Accounts for the past quarter show that,
though volume 52 began with an enormous handicap in the business depart
ment, it came out with a small surplus at the end. At the beginning of the
winter quarter the Daily found itself without a business manager, and its
accounts were in a hopeless muddle. In spite of this, efficient and careful
management the last part of the term placed the paper fairly qn its feet.
Advertising alone, however, will not pay expenses, which are unusually
large at this time, and it is essential that a good circulation be secured.
Those who do not feel able to buy student body tickets should feel enough
interest in the daily paper and in current events 011 the campus to subscribe.
With co-operation of the student body, careful management of the business
department,, and hard work by the staff the Daily Palo Alto optimistically
hopes to do at least as well this quarter.
