# STANFORD MAT MEN SHOW UP WELL IN CALIFORNIA MEET
## 
### 
Stanford's showing in the annual
intercollegiate mat tournament held
at Harmon gymnasium, Berkeley, last
night was in every way a success
when it is considered that H. E.
Egami, '20, was the only man left
from last year's team to stiffen up
this year's material.
Fujii, the 125-pound representative,
won his bout handily in 1 minute 9
seconds over P. IX Barnett and later
entered the 135-pound class in order
to prevent California from winning
that event by a default. He showed
remarkable ability in gaining a de
cision over McManus of California.
Referee Vancourt, a veteran of
thirty years, said of him: "It will be
a long time before this man will ever
be thrown." H. E. Egami, last year's
varsity champion, won easily over S.
A. Thomas of California and N. Kaki
moto won a clean decision over
Shapero in the IOS-pound class.
The 145-pound and unlimited classes
were forfeited on account of the lack
of varsity material in these .weights.
Henry and Seel;f, Stanford's new
representatives in the 175-pound and
158-pound weights, lost to their more
experienced opponents, Gilson and
Carroll of California.
The final results were: Won by
California, 158- and 175-pound
weights; won by default, 145-pound
and unlimited classes; won by Stan
ford, 108, 115, 125, and 135-pound
classes weights.
Coach Wise said today: "Stanford's
success was due in a large part to the
consistent backing of the Japanese
Club. Next year's chances of win
ning are bright, as all four winners
of this tournament expect to be here
again. In addition the 135-pound vet
eran, Koete, will return to college."
