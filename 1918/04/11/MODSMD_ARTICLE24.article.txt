# U.C. Erects New Building in City.
## 
### 
A building coating $1,000,000 is to
be erected in San Francisco for the
housing of the extension work of the
University of California after the war,
according to plans which are being
made. At the present time there are
4,000 enrolled in the extension work,
and by the end of the war there is
every prospect that there will be
10,000. One of the main purposes of
the movement is to supply a ready
means for the soldiers to readjust
themselves to the new conditions
when they return from the front.
