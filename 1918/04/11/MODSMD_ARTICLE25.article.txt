# UNIVERSITY TO GIVE ORATORIO "ELIJAH"
## 
### 
"Elijah," Mendelssohn's oratorio, is
to be given in the Memorial Church
either the latter part of May or the
lirst part of June. The Morris Club
of Palo Alto and the University chorus
are practicing every Thursday even
ing for the event. The oratorio prom
ises to be very successful; however,
more voices are needed to fill a num
ber of vacancies, and tenors will be
particularly welcome. This is a try
ing year to give such a performance,
but with the aid of all it can be as
successful as those of the previous
years.
