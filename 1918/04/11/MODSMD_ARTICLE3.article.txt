# Track Dance Will Follow Big Meet
## 
### 
After spending a hard afternoon
on the cinders battling the Blue and
Gold track team, probably for the last
time until the close of the war, the
Cardinal track squad will end the day
with a dance in the Women's Club
House Saturday night. One dollar
and war tax will admit the dancers.
Several men on the squad are ar
ranging the affair and promise that
it will be an appropriate climax to a
successful track season. The heroes
of the meet will all be present, which
is worth the admission price alone.
The best campus orchestra will fur
nish championship music for the
championship crowd that is expected.
In order to insure the attendance
of the campus queens, a two-pound box
of Wilson's Co-eds will be given to the
best dancers.
