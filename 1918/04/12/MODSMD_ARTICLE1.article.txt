# STANFORD-CALIFORNIA PRIMED FOR INTERCOLLEGIATE WAR SPORT TEST
## BASEBALL NINE MEETS CALIFORNIA AT 10 A.M. 
### H.G. Swendsen, '20 
Intercollegiate baseball will hold
the boards tomorrow morning when
the Varsities of Stanford and the Uni
versity of California take the field in
their third and perhaps decisive dia
mond battle of the 1918 season. The
Cardinal has already won one game
while California in turn has added one
victory to her scors. After tomor-

row's fracas one team will have the
decided advantage of two games out
of three on the five-game series.
Stanford lias the edge in tomorrow's
game, according to the dope. Cali
fornia won the first contest largely
on fluk.v playing by the Cardinal in
fiehlers. and poor base running by
the Varsity. This play seems to be

out of tiie system, however, and tlie
team should lie up to standard, as
they were in the second game.
In addition, Stanford's heaver, Lifur,
has hung the Indian sign on the men
from across the bay in good shape so
far, while Ellison has been getting
poorer as the series luis progressed.
! In case the long nioundsman starts
j tomorrow he will be treated to a rare
'shower of hits. There is always the
possibility that a new man will be
sent in by California, however, and
use the jinx on the. Varsity, but even
here Stanford will be on the offen
sive and will have disposed of the
Ulue and Gold's best bet.
The game tomorrow will start
promptly at 10 o'clock on the Varsity
diamond. Captain Parker, military
I commandant, has arranged to dis
miss the morning class in drill, and
every man will be given an opportun
ity to turn out for the game. In ad
dition there will be no morning classes
!to bother students. Admission for the
j game will be r>o cents with 10 per
j cent war tax, or a punch of a series
| ticket.
Captain Lilly plans to start the same
| team against California as was lined
!up in the last game. Campbell will
ratch, Davis will be on lirst, Doe on
second, Galloway on short, Dickey on
third, and Wayland, Lilly, and Har
vey in the outfield. Lifur will, of
course, be on the mound.
After the bit in the ninth inning of
the last game, which won for Stan
ford, fans may expect any big league
baseball from the team. Lilly, Camp
bell, and Galloway are hitting in the
best form of any men in the last few
years, while the team is fielding well.


Captain Lilly,
Star of the 191s baseball season.
The Varsity should put lip a good
game.
California Is Silent.
The California coach, Claire Good
win, has not given out the names of
the men who will start in the game,
but the lineup will probahly be the
same as before, with the possible ex
ception of the hoaver. Upon the man
who starts in the box for the Blue and
Gold may depend much of the result
of the game.
Hildebrand, one of the best men
in his line on the coast, will not be
able to umpire the game, and an effort
is being made by Graduate Manager
Pettingill to get a Coast League man
to handle the indicator.

of the game.
Hildebrand, one of the best men
in his line on the coast, will not be
able to umpire the game, and an effort
is being made by Graduate Manager
Pettingill to get a Coast League man
to handle the indicator.
Intercollegiate baseball will hold
the boards tomorrow morning when
the Varsities of Stanford and the Uni
versity of California take the field in
their third and perhaps decisive dia
mond battle of the 1918 season. The
Cardinal has already won one game
while California in turn has added one
victory to her scors. After tomor-

row's fracas one team will have the
decided advantage of two games out
of three on the five-game series.
Stanford lias the edge in tomorrow's
game, according to the dope. Cali
fornia won the first contest largely
on fluk.v playing by the Cardinal in
fiehlers. and poor base running by
the Varsity. This play seems to be

out of tiie system, however, and tlie
team should lie up to standard, as
they were in the second game.
In addition, Stanford's heaver, Lifur,
has hung the Indian sign on the men
from across the bay in good shape so
far, while Ellison has been getting
poorer as the series luis progressed.
! In case the long nioundsman starts
j tomorrow he will be treated to a rare
'shower of hits. There is always the
possibility that a new man will be
sent in by California, however, and
use the jinx on the. Varsity, but even
here Stanford will be on the offen
sive and will have disposed of the
Ulue and Gold's best bet.
The game tomorrow will start
promptly at 10 o'clock on the Varsity
diamond. Captain Parker, military
I commandant, has arranged to dis
miss the morning class in drill, and
every man will be given an opportun
ity to turn out for the game. In ad
dition there will be no morning classes
!to bother students. Admission for the
j game will be r>o cents with 10 per
j cent war tax, or a punch of a series
| ticket.
Captain Lilly plans to start the same
| team against California as was lined
!up in the last game. Campbell will
ratch, Davis will be on lirst, Doe on
second, Galloway on short, Dickey on
third, and Wayland, Lilly, and Har
vey in the outfield. Lifur will, of
course, be on the mound.
After the bit in the ninth inning of
the last game, which won for Stan
ford, fans may expect any big league
baseball from the team. Lilly, Camp
bell, and Galloway are hitting in the
best form of any men in the last few
years, while the team is fielding well.


Captain Lilly,
Star of the 191s baseball season.
The Varsity should put lip a good
game.
California Is Silent.
The California coach, Claire Good
win, has not given out the names of
the men who will start in the game,
but the lineup will probahly be the
same as before, with the possible ex
ception of the hoaver. Upon the man
who starts in the box for the Blue and
Gold may depend much of the result
of the game.
