# SUCCESS!

### 
Tomorrow will be the one big day on the Cardinal field until after the
war. It probably will be quite some time before such a program of events
as is planned will occur again. Let's make it the biggest day Stanford ath
letics has witnessed in many a year!
It is perfectly certain that the performers in both the baseball game and
the track meet will have something worth while to demonstrate, and captains
of both teams are confident that their men will show up to the best advan
tage in tomorrow's contests. Indeed, nearly all the dopesters have picked
the Cardinal for winner in the track meet with California. Stanford fans are
therefore assured a fitting return for their pasteboards.
But aside from all this, the best part about Saturday's track meet is
that it will show what Stanford can do under exceedingly great difficulties.
All the men save one, the captain, are new to the track squad. Yet, with only
one veteran on the varsity, a group of cinder men that will equal, if not
exceed, former Stanford teams, has been worked up. To Art Wilson in the
v first part of the season, and to Captain Chapman in the latter part, as well
as to the co-operation of the entire squad is due the credit for such a note
worthy accomplishment. Training has been based entirely upon the principle
upon which Stanford athletics stands. There has been no highly paid pro
fessional coach, as is used by the rival institution across the bay, yet we
confidently pit our team against theirs.
Tomorrow's meets will be exhibitions of genuine sport. Though the
squad is the smallest in years, and will have to work over-hard, it is going
to win. It is going to be the same demonstration of Stanford spirit that
triumphed over superior team-work and ability in the last big football game
with the Missionites.
Surely such spirit is worthy of support. Catch the contagious spirit, and
let every Stanford man and woman be on the field tomorrow to see the last
big contests here before our men go over to meet the greater foe.
Here's success to the teams!
