"I believe that the boys will come
through in great style tomorrow morn
ing against California. Lifur is in
fine shape and the evidence points to
ward his pitching another successful
game. With "Doc" holding down his
end and the rest of us getting our hits
off Ellison, I see no reason why Stan
ford should not come out on top for
the second time."
