ogy will be given at the new marine
station on Monterey bay at Pacific
Grove, which will be opened for the

the shore line of the point. The build
ing is of reinforced concrete three
stories high and provides five labora
tories for class use and nine for pri
vate investigations. The station will
be open all the year for research work
with regular classes tn the spring and
summer. It furnishes exceptional
natural advantages for biological re
search.
Besides the regular faculty, profes

of one hundred. The summer work,
comprising one of the four regular
quarters of the University year under
the system effective last October, will
begin June 19 and end August 31.
September will be the only month in
which Stanford will not be open. The
four-quarter plan was adopted with
the idea of using the University plant
to the fullest extent.
The twelve-week session has been
divided into two separate' terms of
six weeks each, with credit given for
one or both terms. The first term will
end .July 24 and the second begin the
next day.
The program arranged for the sum
mer will lay especial emphasis on ad
vanced and graduate work. Courses
of particular interest to teachers will
be offered in addition to the regular
curriculum. Especially is this the case
in the school of education, where
more than thirty subjects make up
the study card, and in the department
of English, which offers twenty
courses.
All courses in physiology and zool
ogy will be given at the new marine
station on Monterey bay at Pacific
Grove, which will be opened for the
first time. The station is situated on
Almeja (Mussel) Point and controls
the shore line of the point. The build
ing is of reinforced concrete three
stories high and provides five labora
tories for class use and nine for pri
vate investigations. The station will
be open all the year for research work
with regular classes tn the spring and
summer. It furnishes exceptional
natural advantages for biological re
search.
Besides the regular faculty, profes
sors from other institutions have been
appointed. These include George Pur
cell Costigan, Jr., professor of law at
Northwestern University; Dr. Lane
Cooper, professor of English language
and literature at Cornell; Dr. F. M.
Padelford, head of the English depart
ment at the University of Washing
ton; Harlow Lindley, head of the de
partment of history and political sci
ence at Earlham College;. Dr. A. E.
Wilson, principal of the Manual Arts
High School of Los Angeles; Rudolph
Schaeffer, instructor in the San Fran
cisco School of Art; Sara Huntsman,
assistant professor of elocution and
public speaking of Utah Agricultural
College, and Dr. H. P. Cady, professor
of chemistry at the University of
Kansas.
