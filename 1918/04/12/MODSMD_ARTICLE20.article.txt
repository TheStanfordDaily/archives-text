to Lieutenant Colonel John H. Gard
ner, commanding the San Francisco
recruiting district. These branches

men from three branches of govern
ment service—the reclamation serv
ice, the bureau of standards and the
geological survey (topographical
branch) —have been detailed for spe
cial war service, either here or abroad.
3. This leaves the personnel of
those departments so depleted that it
is almost impossible for them to do
their regular work; only with diffi
culty can they supply men needed for
the army.
Prerequisites for the bureau of
standards are:
Not less than one year of work of
college grade in civil engineering,
matics. (Special mechanical and test
ing skill is desirable.)
For reclamation service:
Not less than one year of work of
college grade in civil engineering and
surveying.
Geological survey:
Not less than one year of work of
colleeg grade in civil engineering.
(Special work in map making is de
sirable.)
Men with drafting ability and ex
perience also particularly desired.
Further information in regard to the
matter may be obtained from J. E.
McDowell.
In addition, the ordnance depart
ment of the United States army
wishes to obtain 200 draftsmen for
work from May 1 to October 1, at
salaries up to $100 per month.
The minimum requirement for these
positions is two years of college train

More hglily skilled men are needed
for positions paying up to $3000 per
annum.
For further particulars address
MAJOR E. M. DA INTER,

ing skill is desirable.)

Not less than one year of work of
college grade in civil engineering and

Geological survey:
Not less than one year of work of
colleeg grade in civil engineering.
(Special work in map making is de
sirable.)
Men with drafting ability and ex
perience also particularly desired.
Further information in regard to the
matter may be obtained from J. E.
McDowell.
In addition, the ordnance depart
ment of the United States army
wishes to obtain 200 draftsmen for
work from May 1 to October 1, at

The minimum requirement for these
positions is two years of college train
