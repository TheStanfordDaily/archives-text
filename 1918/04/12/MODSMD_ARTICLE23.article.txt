# BAN ON MEATS IS REMOVED TO CONSERVE WHEAT
## 
### 
Aii order suspending "porkless"
Tuesdays in the state indefinitely has
been recently issued by the United
States Food Administration Lor Cali
fornia on telegraphic instructions
from Herbert C. I-loover.
The new order becomes effective
immediately and lifts the ban on tlie
sale and consumption of all pork prod
ucts, including ham, bacon, and lard,
which had been on me restricted list
for several months.
There are now no restrictions on the
sale or consumption of meats of any
kind in California and the ban on the
pork meats was ellmmated in order
that the public might concentrate its
attention on the new wheat-saving
program, declared by the food admin
istration to be a "vital military neces
sity," and because a sufficient surplus
of hams and bacon lias been created
by the observance of "porkless" Tues
days to meet the present export needs
of the Allies.
With restrictions on all other foods
removed temporarily, the food admin
istration announced that the new
wheat-saving program would entail
but a small sacrifice on the part of
patriotic Californianw, who are asked
to reduce wheat consumption at least
50 per cent of normal, and more than
that where practicable. Thousands of
householders are expected to volun
tarily give up the use of wheat flour
and wheat products until the next
harvest, while clubs, hotels, and res
taurants throughout the country have
banished foods containing wheat from
their menus. Entire counties in some
states have pledged themselves to use
110 wheat in any form until the next
harvest.
