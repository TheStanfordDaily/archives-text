# Fastest Dance For Fast Participants
## 
### 
Track suits, spike shoes, and the
.entire outfit of the Cardinal track
stars will be cast aside after the meet
tomorrow, but they will not be
through with all races, for at the big
track dance in the evening they will
take their marks, get set, and go, on
the polished Moor of the Women's Club
House.
No doubt this event will be one of
the speediest of the year. Fast danc
ing will predominate the entire eve
ning, participated in by the fastest
men in college.
Tickets arc going so fast that it
takes a recorder of lightning rapidity
to register them.
The musicians will be so last that
it will require the most "fleet-o'-foot
men in college to keep up with the
speed artists. The orchestra will be
composed of tin 1 fastest and best mus
ical talent available and it will ren
der the greatest variations of synco
pated harmony ever brought together
on the Stanford campus.
One dollar and the war tax will be
the only thing that can keep a Stan
lord man away, and enough money
may be won on the meet to pay for
this. As a two-pound box of Wilson's
war candy will be actually donated to
the couple that dances the fastest,
shows the most jazz, and lias the best
time, one dollar should prohibit no
man from attending.
The fastest ushers on the campus
will be on hand to handle the crowd
at the doors.
