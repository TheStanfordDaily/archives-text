# GRADUATE MANAGER ISSUES STATEMENT
## 
### 
It will ho a big day for Stanford to
morrow if the student body turns out
as they should. The track team has a
good even chance to win, but it is
hard to dope out the results of the
meet since there are so many men
who have not been in an intercollegi-1
ate meet before, and Stanford has not j
the stars of former years, with one j
or two exceptions.
The ball club will, without a doubt, {
be up to the standard of Cardinal var- â– 
sities, and I look for tnem to win the
i game tomorrow morning.
It. is very discouraging to finish a >
hard race before empty bleachers. Re- >
ports from California state that the-
Blue and Gold rooters are coming I
: clown in force, and it is necessary for
the student body to get out and back j
j the ball club and track team to the j
! limit.
