# U.S. GOVERNMENT CALLS FOR WOMEN BACTERIOLOGISTS
## 
### 
A government call has been sent
out to universities and colleges for
women bacteriologists to fill the many
positions occasioned by war demands.
The position of bacteriologist is well
paid and offers splennld opportunities
for advancement to trie student with
technical training in bacteriology and
serology. Following is a communica
tion from Professor W. 11. Manwar
ing of tlie department of Bacteriology
which discusses the new opening for
women:
During the last eignt weeks the
department of Bacteriology and Ex
perimental Pathology lias had ten
calls for bacteriologists and serolo
gists, salaries varying from $ ISOO to
$2500 (one salary $.'5500), most of the
positions being open to women. The
department has had no available can
didates for these positions.
My only suggestion for meeting the
present emergency would be for the
University to call official attention to
the urgent demand for workers in this
field, and to urge qualified students to
make preparation for this work.
A mature student, who lias had the
necessary preliminary training in
biology and chemistry, can prepare
for one of these positions in a year's
time. The preliminary work in biology
and chemistry, togetner with the tech
nical training in bacteriology and
serology could be completed within
two years.
Our introductory course in general
pathology begins April 1.
