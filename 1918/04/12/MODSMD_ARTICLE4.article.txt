cessful outcome of the scheduled
events. From Walter Christie at Cali
fornia comes prediction of a victory
in the trad; and field meet, and from

Captain L. L. Chapman of Stanford
comes the confident statement of a win
by over seventy points. Dr. Angell,
always reedy to boost Stanford ath
letics, congratulates the men on the
work they have done against great
and almost overwhelming odds.
Christie's Statement.
"California's chances to win the
meet tomorrow depend upon what

second and third places she secures.
Stanford stars will shine in the num
erous events they enter and if per
chance something happens, with bad
luck or accidents, as such things gen
erally do occur in dual meets, why,
her chances will be hurt in a greater
or less degree. We do know, how
ever, that both colleges will give the
very best they have, and, win, lose, or
draw, we will be proud of the ath
letes. I look for a hard, earnest, com*
petitive meet, with grit and determ
ination shown at every stage of the
meet."
Chapman's Statement,
"Our squad is smaller than usual,
and it lacks varsity experience, but,
lacking in quantity, it is of first class
quality, All the men are in good shape
and optimistic. Therefore I feel con
fident that the final score will be not
less than 70 points in the Cardinal's
favor."
Or. Angell's Statement.
"I am especially desirous of seeing
the teams win, because of the great
odds against them of lack of men and
equipment. The teams have shown in
dependence and ability in overcoming
these odds and deserve victory as well
as credit."
