# TRACK MEN WILL TACKLE BEARS
## Cardinal Chances Good For Sixth Straight Win 
### 
L. W. Dinkelspiel, '20.
Introduced t>y the noise of the informal cheer rally held last evening and
finding its swan-song in the husky voices of the Cardinal rooters on the
morrow, Stanford will conclude its last day of intercollegiate athletics, until
the termination of the war, with the varsity track meet with the University
of California Saturday afternoon, it's a glorious sendoff that the students
plan giving their last intercollegiate team, and it's a still more glorious send
oft" that the track team plans giving intercollegiate athletics. Six straight
victories in track over their rivals from across the bay is what the red
shirted beys are going to try and do tomorrow.
Stanford Team Uncoached.
If Stanford makes it six straight it will be something in her favor aside
from the mere glory of an unheralded string of victories over a strong rival;
it will be a victory of a team that is to take the field uncoached except by
student track men. 11. L. Templeton, '18, started the work of coaching the
squad, but Uncle Sam called him from his uncompleted task. M. J. House,
1!>. was the next student teacher, but once again the army called.
r l he Stanford team lias had the unusual experience of having had three
captains. E. R. Caughey, 'IK. was the man honored after the meet last year,
but he enlisted in the fourth Stanford ambulance corps.

A. P. Wilson was next appointed by
the executive committee, but he, after
working with the squad all season,
was called into aviation last week. L.
L. Chapman, '18, was selected by the
squad to skipper the team at a meet
ing this week.
Hope Depends on Chapman.
It is upon Chapman that much of
the Cardinal hope of victory depends.
Both the mile and the two-mile events
seem certain to hang in his scalp
belt, which is generally considered a
worthy performance for any varsity

captain. Samis an(J Carlisle will work
in the two-mile with Chapman and
ought to score at least three of the
remaining points. Samis may even
win this event. Colglazier is the next
best bet to Chapman in the mile and
he will be assisted by Musser and
Terman. Sixteen points at least ought
to come to the Cardinal in the longer
distances.
The 880 will furnish some of the
best competition of the meet. Captain
Moody of California is the most likely


"Gene" Davis,
Who is expected to lie
the big point winner
against the ltlne and
Gold in track.
