# TRACK MEN WILL TACKLE BEARS
## Cardinal Chances Good For Sixth Straight Win 
### 
L. W. Dinkelspiel, '20.
Introduced t>y the noise of the informal cheer rally held last evening and
finding its swan-song in the husky voices of the Cardinal rooters on the
morrow, Stanford will conclude its last day of intercollegiate athletics, until
the termination of the war, with the varsity track meet with the University
of California Saturday afternoon, it's a glorious sendoff that the students
plan giving their last intercollegiate team, and it's a still more glorious send
oft" that the track team plans giving intercollegiate athletics. Six straight
victories in track over their rivals from across the bay is what the red
shirted beys are going to try and do tomorrow.
Stanford Team Uncoached.
If Stanford makes it six straight it will be something in her favor aside
from the mere glory of an unheralded string of victories over a strong rival;
it will be a victory of a team that is to take the field uncoached except by
student track men. 11. L. Templeton, '18, started the work of coaching the
squad, but Uncle Sam called him from his uncompleted task. M. J. House,
1!>. was the next student teacher, but once again the army called.
r l he Stanford team lias had the unusual experience of having had three
captains. E. R. Caughey, 'IK. was the man honored after the meet last year,
but he enlisted in the fourth Stanford ambulance corps.

A. P. Wilson was next appointed by
the executive committee, but he, after
working with the squad all season,
was called into aviation last week. L.
L. Chapman, '18, was selected by the
squad to skipper the team at a meet
ing this week.
Hope Depends on Chapman.
It is upon Chapman that much of
the Cardinal hope of victory depends.
Both the mile and the two-mile events
seem certain to hang in his scalp
belt, which is generally considered a
worthy performance for any varsity

captain. Samis an(J Carlisle will work
in the two-mile with Chapman and
ought to score at least three of the
remaining points. Samis may even
win this event. Colglazier is the next
best bet to Chapman in the mile and
he will be assisted by Musser and
Terman. Sixteen points at least ought
to come to the Cardinal in the longer
distances.
The 880 will furnish some of the
best competition of the meet. Captain
Moody of California is the most likely

winner, although Teitsworth, Me-1

I
close, and anyway divide the re
mainder of the points.
440 Event to Feature.
The 440 is the one event in which
there is great rivalry, and two run
ners of exceptional caliber oppose
each other here. Moody anil May
nard are both men or unusual ability,
and will fight for the five points from
the start to the finish. The man who
gets the pole in this event will prob
ably win. Hall is the other Cardinal
entry and seems capable of stepping
into third.
The hurdles will bring to light the
man who promises to be the star of
the meet and the highest individual
point winner. E. L. Davis, '20, has
been showing rare form in both hur
dles and seems the <nan to win the
barrier events. By granting a Cali
fornia man first in possibly the high
hurdles, which is conceding the Blue
and Gold considerable, Davis will any
way clean up 141-4 points, as he
seems the most likely winner of the
pole vault, and is slated for a relay
lap. Rogers, Sturgeon, and Gibbs are
the trio to run the high hurdles with
Davis, and Glikbarg, Gibbs, and Stur
geon run in the lows. Glickbarg seems
fast enough to count third.
Lilly Fast in Century.
The sprints as usual present an un
certainty. Lilly of baseball and foot
ball fame will take off his diamond
spikes and don his track shoes in time
for a possible win In the 100-yard
dash. Maynard, B. F. Davis and
Dinkelspiel will fight for the other po
sitions. Six points can probably be
counted for Stanford in the century.
The Cardinal dependence in the fur
long will be placed on B. F. Davis,
Mel Levy, Howes and Dinkelspiel,
and this quartet may fie able to add
four points to Stanford's score. -
The field events do not loom as
comparatively weak as in previous
years, although here, as usual, we
have our "weak sisters." The high
jump seems like an easy eight points
for the red and white, with Heath and
Weaver both jumping around six feet.
Hargrove, Sheldon, and Bryan all
have shown good sturr In practice and
would not surprise by high-stepping
into the point column. Lyon in the
broad jump looks like a safe bet for
second place at least, as he is jump
ing pretty close to twenty-two feet.
Nagel has been off form but may come
through, while Parsons is displaying
constantly improving class. E. L.
Davis may also compete in this event.
Davis in the Pole.
Davis is in the pole again, and is
the probable winner. Bryan, Sheldon, 1
and Winham may break into the score
column in this event. Curtice is the
best bet in the hammer throw and
seems assured of a second place can
he but stay in the ring. If Coonse can
overcome a similar difficulty he may
also figure. Metcalf, Finlay, and Mon
roe might place. Weitzel seems likely
to score in the shot-put, although it.
is difficult to say in wnat place. Cur
tice and Monroe are his teammates in
this event.
The relay looks like the Cardinal's
witli a team that is credited with an
average of well under fifty-three sec
onds. If the meet depends upon the
relay, as is possible, Stanford's
chances look extremely bright. E. L.
Davis will conclude his hard day's
work by running the first lap. Mc-
Closkey, who is being kept, fresh for
this event, will take the baton from
him and pass it to Dinkelspiel, who in
turn will hand it over to the speedy
Maynard.

shirted beys are going to try and do tomorrow.
Stanford Team Uncoached.
If Stanford makes it six straight it will be something in her favor aside
from the mere glory of an unheralded string of victories over a strong rival;
it will be a victory of a team that is to take the field uncoached except by
student track men. 11. L. Templeton, '18, started the work of coaching the
squad, but Uncle Sam called him from his uncompleted task. M. J. House,
1!>. was the next student teacher, but once again the army called.
r l he Stanford team lias had the unusual experience of having had three
captains. E. R. Caughey, 'IK. was the man honored after the meet last year,
but he enlisted in the fourth Stanford ambulance corps.

A. P. Wilson was next appointed by
the executive committee, but he, after
working with the squad all season,
was called into aviation last week. L.
L. Chapman, '18, was selected by the
squad to skipper the team at a meet
ing this week.
Hope Depends on Chapman.
It is upon Chapman that much of
the Cardinal hope of victory depends.
Both the mile and the two-mile events
seem certain to hang in his scalp
belt, which is generally considered a
worthy performance for any varsity

captain. Samis an(J Carlisle will work
in the two-mile with Chapman and
ought to score at least three of the
remaining points. Samis may even
win this event. Colglazier is the next
best bet to Chapman in the mile and
he will be assisted by Musser and
Terman. Sixteen points at least ought
to come to the Cardinal in the longer
distances.
The 880 will furnish some of the
best competition of the meet. Captain
Moody of California is the most likely

440 Event to Feature.
The 440 is the one event in which
there is great rivalry, and two run
ners of exceptional caliber oppose
each other here. Moody anil May
nard are both men or unusual ability,
and will fight for the five points from
the start to the finish. The man who
gets the pole in this event will prob
ably win. Hall is the other Cardinal
entry and seems capable of stepping
into third.
The hurdles will bring to light the
man who promises to be the star of
the meet and the highest individual
point winner. E. L. Davis, '20, has
been showing rare form in both hur
dles and seems the <nan to win the
barrier events. By granting a Cali
fornia man first in possibly the high
hurdles, which is conceding the Blue
and Gold considerable, Davis will any
way clean up 141-4 points, as he
seems the most likely winner of the
pole vault, and is slated for a relay
lap. Rogers, Sturgeon, and Gibbs are
the trio to run the high hurdles with
Davis, and Glikbarg, Gibbs, and Stur
geon run in the lows. Glickbarg seems
fast enough to count third.
Lilly Fast in Century.
The sprints as usual present an un
certainty. Lilly of baseball and foot
ball fame will take off his diamond
spikes and don his track shoes in time
for a possible win In the 100-yard
dash. Maynard, B. F. Davis and
Dinkelspiel will fight for the other po
sitions. Six points can probably be
counted for Stanford in the century.
The Cardinal dependence in the fur
long will be placed on B. F. Davis,
Mel Levy, Howes and Dinkelspiel,
and this quartet may fie able to add
four points to Stanford's score. -
The field events do not loom as
comparatively weak as in previous
years, although here, as usual, we
have our "weak sisters." The high
jump seems like an easy eight points
for the red and white, with Heath and
Weaver both jumping around six feet.
Hargrove, Sheldon, and Bryan all
have shown good sturr In practice and
would not surprise by high-stepping
into the point column. Lyon in the
broad jump looks like a safe bet for
second place at least, as he is jump
ing pretty close to twenty-two feet.
Nagel has been off form but may come
through, while Parsons is displaying
constantly improving class. E. L.
Davis may also compete in this event.
Davis in the Pole.
Davis is in the pole again, and is

column in this event. Curtice is the
best bet in the hammer throw and

he but stay in the ring. If Coonse can
overcome a similar difficulty he may

tice and Monroe are his teammates in
this event.
The relay looks like the Cardinal's
witli a team that is credited with an
average of well under fifty-three sec
onds. If the meet depends upon the
relay, as is possible, Stanford's
chances look extremely bright. E. L.
Davis will conclude his hard day's
work by running the first lap. Mc-
Closkey, who is being kept, fresh for
this event, will take the baton from
him and pass it to Dinkelspiel, who in
turn will hand it over to the speedy
Maynard.

the executive committee, but he, after
working with the squad all season,

Hope Depends on Chapman.
It is upon Chapman that much of
the Cardinal hope of victory depends.
Both the mile and the two-mile events
seem certain to hang in his scalp
belt, which is generally considered a
worthy performance for any varsity

captain. Samis an(J Carlisle will work
in the two-mile with Chapman and
ought to score at least three of the
remaining points. Samis may even
win this event. Colglazier is the next
best bet to Chapman in the mile and
he will be assisted by Musser and
Terman. Sixteen points at least ought
to come to the Cardinal in the longer
distances.
The 880 will furnish some of the
best competition of the meet. Captain
Moody of California is the most likely

440 Event to Feature.
The 440 is the one event in which
there is great rivalry, and two run
ners of exceptional caliber oppose
each other here. Moody anil May
nard are both men or unusual ability,
and will fight for the five points from
the start to the finish. The man who
gets the pole in this event will prob
ably win. Hall is the other Cardinal
entry and seems capable of stepping
into third.
The hurdles will bring to light the
man who promises to be the star of
the meet and the highest individual
point winner. E. L. Davis, '20, has
been showing rare form in both hur
dles and seems the <nan to win the
barrier events. By granting a Cali
fornia man first in possibly the high
hurdles, which is conceding the Blue
and Gold considerable, Davis will any
way clean up 141-4 points, as he
seems the most likely winner of the
pole vault, and is slated for a relay
lap. Rogers, Sturgeon, and Gibbs are
the trio to run the high hurdles with
Davis, and Glikbarg, Gibbs, and Stur
geon run in the lows. Glickbarg seems
fast enough to count third.
Lilly Fast in Century.
The sprints as usual present an un
certainty. Lilly of baseball and foot
ball fame will take off his diamond
spikes and don his track shoes in time
for a possible win In the 100-yard
dash. Maynard, B. F. Davis and
Dinkelspiel will fight for the other po
sitions. Six points can probably be
counted for Stanford in the century.
The Cardinal dependence in the fur
long will be placed on B. F. Davis,
Mel Levy, Howes and Dinkelspiel,
and this quartet may fie able to add
four points to Stanford's score. -
The field events do not loom as
comparatively weak as in previous
years, although here, as usual, we
have our "weak sisters." The high
jump seems like an easy eight points
for the red and white, with Heath and
Weaver both jumping around six feet.
Hargrove, Sheldon, and Bryan all
have shown good sturr In practice and
would not surprise by high-stepping
into the point column. Lyon in the
broad jump looks like a safe bet for
second place at least, as he is jump
ing pretty close to twenty-two feet.
Nagel has been off form but may come
through, while Parsons is displaying
constantly improving class. E. L.
Davis may also compete in this event.
Davis in the Pole.
Davis is in the pole again, and is
the probable winner. Bryan, Sheldon, 1

column in this event. Curtice is the
best bet in the hammer throw and

he but stay in the ring. If Coonse can
overcome a similar difficulty he may

tice and Monroe are his teammates in
this event.
The relay looks like the Cardinal's
witli a team that is credited with an
average of well under fifty-three sec
onds. If the meet depends upon the
relay, as is possible, Stanford's
chances look extremely bright. E. L.
Davis will conclude his hard day's
work by running the first lap. Mc-
Closkey, who is being kept, fresh for
this event, will take the baton from
him and pass it to Dinkelspiel, who in
turn will hand it over to the speedy
Maynard.
L. W. Dinkelspiel, '20.
Introduced t>y the noise of the informal cheer rally held last evening and
finding its swan-song in the husky voices of the Cardinal rooters on the
morrow, Stanford will conclude its last day of intercollegiate athletics, until
the termination of the war, with the varsity track meet with the University
of California Saturday afternoon, it's a glorious sendoff that the students
plan giving their last intercollegiate team, and it's a still more glorious send
oft" that the track team plans giving intercollegiate athletics. Six straight

Stanford Team Uncoached.
If Stanford makes it six straight it will be something in her favor aside
from the mere glory of an unheralded string of victories over a strong rival;
it will be a victory of a team that is to take the field uncoached except by
student track men. 11. L. Templeton, '18, started the work of coaching the
