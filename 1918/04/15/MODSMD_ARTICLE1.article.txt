# VARSITY NINE LOSES TO BERKELEY IN HARD GAME
## Cardinal Forces Blue and Gold to Play Thirteen Innings in Battle By H.G. Swendsen, ’20. 
### 
Two home runs and enough baseball
in the thirteenth inning to put a run
across won the third baseball game
between the Cardinal and the Blue
and Gold for California last Satur
day, 3 to 2. Stanford should have
won the game but two poor plays took
the victory away. As it was. a better
exhibition of baseball has not been
seen on the Stanford campus for some
years. Lifur, on the mound for the
Cardinal, pitched like a leaguer, and
Murchio tor California was away
above his usual form. In addition
both teams in the field pulled plays
that are seen in but few diamond bat
tles.
At the end of nine hard innings the
score stood 2 to 2 and extra innings
were necessary. It took until the
thirteenth frame to put across the
much coveter run. Then a Blue and
Gold player tallied, California held the
Cardinal, and the game was won.
These last extra innings were exhi
bitions of real baseball. Neither team
had the advantage and it was not
until the last Stanford batter had been
retired that the game was won.
Hears Tally in Third.
California scored first in the third
when Dexter hit the first ball pitched
out of the reach of the fielders and
had, rounded third before the ball
came back to the diamond from Lilly.
Campbell received the throw-in and
had a bare possibility to retire the
runner, but dropped the ball. Then
in the fourth Captain Rohwer of the
Blue and Gold repeated his team
mate's performance and made it two
for California.
The fourth was also Stanford's in
ning. Harvey, the first man up, was
out, but Lilly was safe on an error
by Godde. The captain sprained his
ankle, however, and Dickey was forced
to run for him. Then Campbell came
ui), looked them over, and tripled to
right field, scoring Dickey. The next
two hitters went out, however, and
Campbell died on third. This inning
saw the host exhibition of real spirit
of many years. Lilly, although he
was seriously hurt, insisted on going
back in the game after he bad sprained j
his ankle. The captain could not de
sert his men, even though he had been
badly injured.
Cardinals liven Tilings.
In the eighth Stanford tied the
score. Davis, first up, was safe at
second on Hensil's overthrow. Lifur
then sacrificed him to third, and
Dickey came through with a pretty
single for a run. Harvey and Camp
bell could not bring him in though
Lilly singled and thus put runners on
third and first.
The eleventh sawJStanford's chance
to win. Lilly was out but Campbell
hit his second triple of the day. He
was called out, though, since he failed
lo touch first base. Galloway, next
up, hit a fly that would have allowed
the runner to score by yards.
Thirteenth Is Fatal.
Then came the thirteenth and Cali
fornia's win. Godde, first at bat,
singled. He was then sacrified to sec
ond and third by Dexter and Ellsworth,
hitting for Murchio. Hensil then
singled and tln> runner crossed the
plate.
In its half of the thirteenth, the
Varsity made a hard attempt to score,
l)iit Ellison retired the Cardinals in
one-two-three fashion after walking
the first, man, and the game was over.
The whole Stanford team put up the
best battle of the year. Dickey at
third handled several chances in good
shape and came through with a hit
when it.was needed to tie the score.
Campbell caught and hit well, and
Captain Lilly, despite his injury, was
fighting every minute. The breaks
were against the Varsity or it would
have won.
