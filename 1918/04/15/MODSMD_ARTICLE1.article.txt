# VARSITY NINE LOSES TO BERKELEY IN HARD GAME
## Cardinal Forces Blue and Gold to Play Thirteen Innings in Battle By H.G. Swendsen, â€™20. 
### 
Two home runs and enough baseball
in the thirteenth inning to put a run
across won the third baseball game
between the Cardinal and the Blue
and Gold for California last Satur
day, 3 to 2. Stanford should have
won the game but two poor plays took
the victory away. As it was. a better
exhibition of baseball has not been
seen on the Stanford campus for some
years. Lifur, on the mound for the
Cardinal, pitched like a leaguer, and

both teams in the field pulled plays
that are seen in but few diamond bat

score stood 2 to 2 and extra innings
were necessary. It took until the
thirteenth frame to put across the
much coveter run. Then a Blue and
Gold player tallied, California held the
Cardinal, and the game was won.
These last extra innings were exhi
bitions of real baseball. Neither team
had the advantage and it was not
until the last Stanford batter had been
retired that the game was won.

when Dexter hit the first ball pitched
out of the reach of the fielders and

came back to the diamond from Lilly.
Campbell received the throw-in and
had a bare possibility to retire the
runner, but dropped the ball. Then
in the fourth Captain Rohwer of the
Blue and Gold repeated his team
mate's performance and made it two
for California.
The fourth was also Stanford's in
ning. Harvey, the first man up, was
out, but Lilly was safe on an error
by Godde. The captain sprained his
ankle, however, and Dickey was forced
to run for him. Then Campbell came
ui), looked them over, and tripled to
right field, scoring Dickey. The next
two hitters went out, however, and
