# Stanford Boxers Down California
## Bouts Are Hard Fought But Lack Scienceâ€”Bruins Take Three 
### 
Giving a real exhibition of Stan
ford's fighting spirit, the Cardinal box
i ers won the intercollegiate tourna
ment Friday night by taking four
I bouts out of a possible seven. With
the exception of Joe Murphy, and pos
sibly "Babe" Henry, none of the fight
ers showed any great degree of sci
ence or skill and most of the bouts
were decided more on grit than tech
nical knowledge of the game.
A large crowd watcher the matches,
which were featured by a give-and
take style. Most of the men seemed
perfectly willing to get knocked down
if they could in turn treat their oppo
nents in the same manner.
The outcome of the tournament
looked bad to Stanford when the first
two Cardinal boxers in the ring were
knocked out. Madden, in the 118-
pound class, put up a game fight In
the first round, against Picetti of Cal
ifornia. and held his opponent even.
In the second round. Picetti came
back strong and as a result Madden
went down for the count.
Albouze lasted a still shorter time
against Whittlesey, the Blue and Gold
184-pound boxer. Both men wore go-
outpointing his opponent. Baker, in
sent Albouze to the floor, and laid him
! out.
j Stanford's chances began to look
better in the third match, when Hur
i ley gave Covington, California's col
' ored representative in the 134-pound
class, such a punishing in the first two
rounds that he could not be persuaded
| to go back in the ring for the third
time. 4
| Joe' Murphy had little trouble in
outpointing his opponent,, Baker, in
the 148-pound class. Murphy hit at.
j will in almost any spot he selected as
i an objective.
The 158-pound bout between "Babe"
' Henry and Huntington of California
was an example of the use of head
work to avoid blows. The first two
[rounds were practically even, but
Henry assumed the aggressive in the
, third and by lightning blows to his
j opponent's head and body won the
I decision.
I The fight between Jack Kegley and
jMazzera of California in the 178-pound
(class was the hardest fought scrap of
the entire card. Kegley clearly got
'the worst of t v e bout for the fl
; round and a half, but came back on
: sheer grit and punished his opponent
heavily for the remaining time, send
] ing him to the floor in the last few
seconds of the third round.
Gordon of California took the
heavyweight division by default, as
Stanford had no representative in that
class.
J. 11. Niderost of the Olympic Club
refereed the bouts. George Green and
"Bob" MrArthur, also of the Olympic
1 Club, acted as judges.

A large crowd watcher the matches,
which were featured by a give-and
take style. Most of the men seemed
perfectly willing to get knocked down
if they could in turn treat their oppo
nents in the same manner.
The outcome of the tournament
looked bad to Stanford when the first
two Cardinal boxers in the ring were
knocked out. Madden, in the 118-
pound class, put up a game fight In
the first round, against Picetti of Cal
ifornia. and held his opponent even.
In the second round. Picetti came
back strong and as a result Madden
went down for the count.
Albouze lasted a still shorter time
against Whittlesey, the Blue and Gold
184-pound boxer. Both men wore go-
outpointing his opponent. Baker, in
sent Albouze to the floor, and laid him
! out.
j Stanford's chances began to look
better in the third match, when Hur
i ley gave Covington, California's col
' ored representative in the 134-pound
class, such a punishing in the first two
rounds that he could not be persuaded

time. 4

i an objective.
The 158-pound bout between "Babe"
' Henry and Huntington of California
was an example of the use of head
work to avoid blows. The first two
[rounds were practically even, but
Henry assumed the aggressive in the
, third and by lightning blows to his
j opponent's head and body won the
I decision.
I The fight between Jack Kegley and
jMazzera of California in the 178-pound
(class was the hardest fought scrap of
the entire card. Kegley clearly got
'the worst of t v e bout for the fl
; round and a half, but came back on
: sheer grit and punished his opponent
heavily for the remaining time, send
] ing him to the floor in the last few
seconds of the third round.
Gordon of California took the
heavyweight division by default, as
Stanford had no representative in that
class.

Giving a real exhibition of Stan
ford's fighting spirit, the Cardinal box
i ers won the intercollegiate tourna
ment Friday night by taking four
I bouts out of a possible seven. With
the exception of Joe Murphy, and pos
sibly "Babe" Henry, none of the fight
ers showed any great degree of sci
ence or skill and most of the bouts
were decided more on grit than tech
nical knowledge of the game.
