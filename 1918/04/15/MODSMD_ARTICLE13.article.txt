# THE 						CARDINAL TO THE FRONT
## 
### 
Stanford came to the front once again last Saturday when the varsity
track men ran away from the Blue and Gold for the sixth successive time,
while the baseball team forced California to go the limit to win the ball
game. Such exhibitions of lighting spirit as were put up by such men as
Lilly in winning the hundred-yard dash and Maynard in beating Captain
Moody of Berkeley in the quarter could only be possible with Stanford tra
ditions back of them.
The Cardinal won because it was determined to win. The war had de
pleted the ranks of track stars severely, yet the men who were left only
worked that much the harder to develop point-winners for the big meet.
Stanford may not have another opportunity to see her men race in ahead
of the Blue and Gold for some years again, but Saturday's exhibition was a
fitting climax to a successful season. The next task is a bigger one, but the
same fighting spirit should be carried across the water, when men in the
University take up the big fight.â€”Contributed.
