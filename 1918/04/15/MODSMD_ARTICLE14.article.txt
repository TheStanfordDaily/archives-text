# LINCOLN STEFFENS
## 
### 
University students will have a rare opportunity to hear of inside affairs
in Russia when Lincoln Steffens speaks in Assembly tomorrow. Steffens
was a leading member of the Root commission to Russia from the United
States, which did so much to keep the empire together when Kerensky was
in power. He, more than any other man, was in touch with alTairs subse
quent to the revolution that put the Bolsheviki in charge.
Steffens is a well-known lecturer and author and will be able to put his
information befpre the Assembly in a most interesting manner. Russia has
been the one mystery of the war, and an opportunity to hear first hand of
conditions existent there should not be missed by a student in the University.
