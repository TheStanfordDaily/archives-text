# Fourth Contest of Series To Be Played Tuesday, at California
## 
### 
Stanford and California will play
the fourth game of the baseball series
on California field tomorrow after
noon. The game from the Cardinal
standpoint is decisive since if the
Blue and Gold wins it will have sewed
up the series and if the team from
across the bay loses it will still be
in the race.
Captain Lilly will probably be
forced to use Lifur again, although
the Cardinal heaver will not be in the
best of shape after the thirteen-inning
battle last Saturday. The California
heaver is still in doubt, but either
Murchio or Ellison will be able to put
up a good game. In case Ellison starts,
Stanford should win. Lifur has been
getting better as the series has prog
ressed and Ellison needs a large score
behind him before he is effective.
The Stanford team will leave for
Berkeley tomorrow morning and will
have a short work-out on California
field before the game.
