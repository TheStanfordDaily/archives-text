## 
### 
Some one. with evil intentions, en
tered the Alpha Tau Omega house
Saturday afternoon during the track
meet and succeeded in getting away
with some of the personal belongings
of the A. T. O.'s.
A suit case, suit of clothes, a watch
and chain, and a pair of shoes were
among the articles stolen. The San
Jose police were notified and are
keeping a watch on the pawn shops
in that city, as are the police of Oak
land and San Francisco. The robbers
left no clue.
No one was in the house for several
hours during the track meet Saturday
afternoon and the robber had plenty
of time to operate and take his choice
of what he wanted.
