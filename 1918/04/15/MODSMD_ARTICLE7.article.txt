# NINTH INNING ERRORS LOSE GAME FOR FRESHMEN
## Blue and Gold Triumphant In Well-Contested Game by 4 to 3 Score 
### 
I With two inexcusable errors, after
| the game was practically laid away
iin cold storage, Stanford freshmen's
I chances of winning a baseball series,
• and their rigljt to play a third game
with California freshmen blew up Fri
j day afternoon.
For eight innings the 1921 team put
across a brand of ball that few gave
them credit for being able to play, and
then, with the score 3 to 2 in their
favor in the ninth inning, they allowed
i the Blue and Gold to secure two runs,
' thereby winning the game and the
} series.
California's success is also due, in
| a large measure, to one Smith, Cali
fornia catcher, who made three runs,
two hits, two steals, and a sacrifice
out of four times at bat. Gillis
pitched a better brand of ball than
usual, but Filley, at the receiving end,
experienced extreme difficulty in hold
ing on to the sphere.
Cardinal Scores First.
The Stanford babes started off by
scoring two runs, when six men suc
cessively got on base in the fourth
inning. Teubner, Newland, and Gillis
secured hits in this frame, while
Teubner and Smith succeeded in
"S" with a third place. "Bill" Win
ham sprang a surprise in the pole
crossing home plate. Another tally in
the eighth put the Cardinals far
enough ahead of the Bruins to have
been entirely safe had they not blown
iil> in the last round.
The most spectacular play of the
game was made in the fifth inning
when Kline, in center field, jumped
high in the air and to one side, for a
line drive, fell down and came up
again with the ball in his glove.
Ninth the Fa til I Inning.
Cardinal fans felt confident tliut the
first-year men would score a victory
until they began a scries of errors in
the last half of the ninth. A faulty
thow to third by Filley was respon
sible for tlie tying run. The Bruins
worked another man around to third
base, and then, with two men out,
Reynolds dropped a high fly to short
and California took away the series.
The score: R. H. E.
