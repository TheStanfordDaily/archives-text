# CARDINAL SPEEDSTERS SCORE 70 TO 52 TRIUMPH OVER WALTER CHRISTIE'S HOPES
## DAVIS, CHAPMAN AND LILLY ARE STARS IN SIXTH STRAIGHT WIN 
### L.W. Dinkelspiel. '20 
Running true to form in most of the events, excelling even optimistic
forecast in many others, and falling down in only two instances, the Stanford
varsity track team triumphed Saturday for the sixth successive time over its
Berkeley rival, to the tune of 70 to 52. Some three thousand spectators were
on hand to cheer and lend color to Stanford's dramatic exit from intercollegiate
athletics, and the majority of them gloried in the jubilant serpentine that
celebrated the victory of the uncoached, war-weakened Cardinal over Walter
Christie's fondly cherished Bears.
Upon "Gene" Davis as the big point-winner, upon Chapman as the active
and successful captain ,and upon "Ken" Lilly as the gamest man who ever
wore Stanford track and baseball spikes in the same day, the rooters' mem
ory of Stanford's last big day of intercollegiate athletics fondly lingers. These
three men were the stars of the big meet, but there were many others who
came into favor with the lenient critics in the grandstand.
Lilly, Davis, and Chapman Star.
Davis' performance was reminiscent of the days of "Feg" Murray and
past Stanford stars, while Chapman's work was distinctly new. Starting the
procession of red-shirted tape-breakers, Chapman romped home in the mile,
the first event of the day, half a yard ahead of Colglazier and yards ahead
of Doyle of California. The pace was too fast for Carlisle, and he could not
sprint himself into third.

Half an hour later Chapman again
broke the tape ahead of Colglazier,
this time in the two-mile. No Cali
fornia man was anywhere around at
the finish, Samis, as the third Cardi
nal runner, having left them far be
hind. Chapman's time was within two
seconds of the Stanford-California
record. Colglazier's six points in
these two long events constituted a
remarkable performance. By way of
a finishing touch Chapman set the
pace in the half mile a few moments
later.
Davis Gathers Points.
Davis seemed to be here, there, and
everywhere gathering points for Stan
ford. First place in the high hurdles
did not bother him to any extent, and
lie mixed a little pole vaulting in with
his rest period before the low hurdles,
which latter event he added to Stan
ford's first place totals. He scored
third in the pole. A few moments
later he leaped almost twenty-one feet
for a win in the broad jump. He was
willing to conclude his remarkable
and seldom-equaled achievements by

running a relay lap, but it was con
sidered that lie had well earned a rest.
Lilly Springs Surprise.
To everyone except those of his
friends who knew his real ability,
"Ken" Lilly's win in the century came
as a distinct surprise. That Lilly had
seldom been 011 a cinder path before,
that he finished the distance in 10 1-5
seconds and that he showed a clean
pair of heels to California's best are
facts worthy of notice, but that he
did all this with an ankle that had
been injured in the ball game in the
morning makes the feat all the more
remarkable.
In a day of features, Maynard's de
cisive victory over the Blue and Gold
skipper. Moody, in the quarter mile,
still stands out as sensational. Tak
ing the turn from California's star,
leading him all the way on the back
stretch despite the latter's strenuous
efforts to pass him, and increasing his
lead to a good three yards on the
home stretch constitute a perform
ance that the Cardinal rooters will
