# CARDINAL SPEEDSTERS SCORE 70 TO 52 TRIUMPH OVER WALTER CHRISTIE'S HOPES
## DAVIS, CHAPMAN AND LILLY ARE STARS IN SIXTH STRAIGHT WIN 
### L.W. Dinkelspiel. '20 
Running true to form in most of the events, excelling even optimistic
forecast in many others, and falling down in only two instances, the Stanford
varsity track team triumphed Saturday for the sixth successive time over its
Berkeley rival, to the tune of 70 to 52. Some three thousand spectators were
on hand to cheer and lend color to Stanford's dramatic exit from intercollegiate
athletics, and the majority of them gloried in the jubilant serpentine that
celebrated the victory of the uncoached, war-weakened Cardinal over Walter
Christie's fondly cherished Bears.
Upon "Gene" Davis as the big point-winner, upon Chapman as the active
and successful captain ,and upon "Ken" Lilly as the gamest man who ever
wore Stanford track and baseball spikes in the same day, the rooters' mem
ory of Stanford's last big day of intercollegiate athletics fondly lingers. These
three men were the stars of the big meet, but there were many others who
came into favor with the lenient critics in the grandstand.
Lilly, Davis, and Chapman Star.
Davis' performance was reminiscent of the days of "Feg" Murray and
past Stanford stars, while Chapman's work was distinctly new. Starting the
procession of red-shirted tape-breakers, Chapman romped home in the mile,
the first event of the day, half a yard ahead of Colglazier and yards ahead
of Doyle of California. The pace was too fast for Carlisle, and he could not
sprint himself into third.

Half an hour later Chapman again
broke the tape ahead of Colglazier,
this time in the two-mile. No Cali
fornia man was anywhere around at
the finish, Samis, as the third Cardi
nal runner, having left them far be
hind. Chapman's time was within two
seconds of the Stanford-California
record. Colglazier's six points in
these two long events constituted a
remarkable performance. By way of
a finishing touch Chapman set the
pace in the half mile a few moments
later.
Davis Gathers Points.
Davis seemed to be here, there, and
everywhere gathering points for Stan
ford. First place in the high hurdles
did not bother him to any extent, and
lie mixed a little pole vaulting in with
his rest period before the low hurdles,
which latter event he added to Stan
ford's first place totals. He scored
third in the pole. A few moments
later he leaped almost twenty-one feet
for a win in the broad jump. He was
willing to conclude his remarkable
and seldom-equaled achievements by

running a relay lap, but it was con
sidered that lie had well earned a rest.
Lilly Springs Surprise.
To everyone except those of his
friends who knew his real ability,
"Ken" Lilly's win in the century came
as a distinct surprise. That Lilly had
seldom been 011 a cinder path before,
that he finished the distance in 10 1-5
seconds and that he showed a clean
pair of heels to California's best are
facts worthy of notice, but that he
did all this with an ankle that had
been injured in the ball game in the
morning makes the feat all the more
remarkable.
In a day of features, Maynard's de
cisive victory over the Blue and Gold
skipper. Moody, in the quarter mile,
still stands out as sensational. Tak
ing the turn from California's star,
leading him all the way on the back
stretch despite the latter's strenuous
efforts to pass him, and increasing his
lead to a good three yards on the
home stretch constitute a perform
ance that the Cardinal rooters will
give a permanent place in Stanford's
track glories. Maynard's time was 51
flat. McPherson ran a heady race and
won his letter with a third place.
Moody Outclassed in Half.
Again in the half mile the vaunted
Moody went down to defeat, this time
to Horn, the winner, and Teitsworth,
who finished second. Chapman went
into this event to set the pace and
wear the opposition down. That he
was successful can be attested by the
result. Chapman dropped out on the
last lap-and Teitsworth took the lead,
only to be passed at the finish by his
teammate, Horn.
The sprints proved a disappoint
ment, with the exception of Lilly's
performance in the hundred. "Barb"
Davis scored third in the (-lose finish
of the 220, pressing the heels of John
son, the winner, and Cantelow, the
second-place man.
Rogers surprised the stands by tak
ing third in the high hurdles. In the
first race, the finish was declared a
tie for third between Mohr and Rog
ers, but in the run-off the Stanford
man clearly demonstrated his supe
riority over his Berkeley rival.
Glikbarg experienced hard luck in
the low hurdles by tripping over the
last harried. He was in thrid place
at the time.
Kisrlit Cardinal Points in Both .hinips.
The jumps were a source of Cardi
nal points, sixteen being acquired in
the broad and high. Weaver came
through in great style in the high
jump, leaping 5 feet 11 1-2 inches. His
teammate Heath scored the three
points for second place and left third
to California's best. Davis showed
his versatility and his ability to send
gloom to the Blue and Gold by win
ning the broad jump. Lyon jumped
into second place, leaping close be
hind Davis.
California returned Stanford's com
pliment in the jumps by scoring six
teen points in the weights. Curtice
scored the lone Cardinal point in the
hammer throw, by finishing third in
fast company. Weitzel was the point
getter in the shot put and won his
vault by showing the form that dis
tinguished him in his prep school
days and leaping 11 feet 3 inches for a
second place and three points.
The relay team went with the 220
as the other disappointment of the
meet. The Stanford team, composed
of B. F. Davis, McCloskey, McPherson,
and Maynard, had apparently won this
event with a good fifty yards to spare,
making the score 75 to 47, when it
was discovered that Davis had acci
dentally fouled the first California
runner on the turn. The Stanford
team was disqualified, and their five
points given to California. The de
cision of the track judges cost Mc-
Closkey his varsity letter, as he had
been saved especially for the relay.
Stanford's victory was a decisive
one. First place in every track event,
save one and the flake relay, went to
the Cardinal, and in the field events,
where the Blue and Gold strength was
considered far superior, a difference
of only one point in California's favor
separated the two teams. Stanford's
victory was a-hieved without the aid
of professional services, and with only
one varsity track "S" veteran of pre
vious years. With "Art" Wilson, the
man who helped get the team in shape
and then left for the government serv
ice a week before his "big day," "Jud"
House or "Dink" Templeton, who bpth
left for the service since the season
started, on hand to tally for the Farm,
Stanford's victory would have been
still more overwhelming.

running a relay lap, but it was con
sidered that lie had well earned a rest.
Lilly Springs Surprise.
To everyone except those of his
friends who knew his real ability,
"Ken" Lilly's win in the century came
as a distinct surprise. That Lilly had
seldom been 011 a cinder path before,
that he finished the distance in 10 1-5
seconds and that he showed a clean
pair of heels to California's best are
facts worthy of notice, but that he
did all this with an ankle that had
been injured in the ball game in the
morning makes the feat all the more
remarkable.
In a day of features, Maynard's de
cisive victory over the Blue and Gold
skipper. Moody, in the quarter mile,
still stands out as sensational. Tak
ing the turn from California's star,
leading him all the way on the back
stretch despite the latter's strenuous
efforts to pass him, and increasing his
lead to a good three yards on the
home stretch constitute a perform
ance that the Cardinal rooters will
give a permanent place in Stanford's
track glories. Maynard's time was 51
flat. McPherson ran a heady race and
won his letter with a third place.
Moody Outclassed in Half.
Again in the half mile the vaunted
Moody went down to defeat, this time
to Horn, the winner, and Teitsworth,
who finished second. Chapman went
into this event to set the pace and
wear the opposition down. That he
was successful can be attested by the
result. Chapman dropped out on the
last lap-and Teitsworth took the lead,
only to be passed at the finish by his
teammate, Horn.
The sprints proved a disappoint
ment, with the exception of Lilly's
performance in the hundred. "Barb"
Davis scored third in the (-lose finish
of the 220, pressing the heels of John
son, the winner, and Cantelow, the
second-place man.
Rogers surprised the stands by tak
ing third in the high hurdles. In the
first race, the finish was declared a
tie for third between Mohr and Rog
ers, but in the run-off the Stanford
man clearly demonstrated his supe
riority over his Berkeley rival.
Glikbarg experienced hard luck in
the low hurdles by tripping over the
last harried. He was in thrid place
at the time.
Kisrlit Cardinal Points in Both .hinips.
The jumps were a source of Cardi
nal points, sixteen being acquired in
the broad and high. Weaver came
through in great style in the high
jump, leaping 5 feet 11 1-2 inches. His
teammate Heath scored the three
points for second place and left third
to California's best. Davis showed
his versatility and his ability to send
gloom to the Blue and Gold by win
ning the broad jump. Lyon jumped
into second place, leaping close be
hind Davis.
California returned Stanford's com
pliment in the jumps by scoring six
teen points in the weights. Curtice
scored the lone Cardinal point in the
hammer throw, by finishing third in
fast company. Weitzel was the point
getter in the shot put and won his
vault by showing the form that dis
tinguished him in his prep school
days and leaping 11 feet 3 inches for a
second place and three points.
The relay team went with the 220
as the other disappointment of the
meet. The Stanford team, composed
of B. F. Davis, McCloskey, McPherson,
and Maynard, had apparently won this
event with a good fifty yards to spare,
making the score 75 to 47, when it
was discovered that Davis had acci
dentally fouled the first California
runner on the turn. The Stanford
team was disqualified, and their five
points given to California. The de
cision of the track judges cost Mc-
Closkey his varsity letter, as he had
been saved especially for the relay.
Stanford's victory was a decisive
one. First place in every track event,
save one and the flake relay, went to
the Cardinal, and in the field events,
where the Blue and Gold strength was
considered far superior, a difference
of only one point in California's favor
separated the two teams. Stanford's
victory was a-hieved without the aid
of professional services, and with only
one varsity track "S" veteran of pre
vious years. With "Art" Wilson, the
man who helped get the team in shape
and then left for the government serv
ice a week before his "big day," "Jud"
House or "Dink" Templeton, who bpth
left for the service since the season
started, on hand to tally for the Farm,
Stanford's victory would have been
still more overwhelming.

Running true to form in most of the events, excelling even optimistic
forecast in many others, and falling down in only two instances, the Stanford
varsity track team triumphed Saturday for the sixth successive time over its
Berkeley rival, to the tune of 70 to 52. Some three thousand spectators were
on hand to cheer and lend color to Stanford's dramatic exit from intercollegiate
athletics, and the majority of them gloried in the jubilant serpentine that
celebrated the victory of the uncoached, war-weakened Cardinal over Walter
Christie's fondly cherished Bears.
Upon "Gene" Davis as the big point-winner, upon Chapman as the active
and successful captain ,and upon "Ken" Lilly as the gamest man who ever
wore Stanford track and baseball spikes in the same day, the rooters' mem
ory of Stanford's last big day of intercollegiate athletics fondly lingers. These
three men were the stars of the big meet, but there were many others who
came into favor with the lenient critics in the grandstand.
Lilly, Davis, and Chapman Star.
Davis' performance was reminiscent of the days of "Feg" Murray and
past Stanford stars, while Chapman's work was distinctly new. Starting the
procession of red-shirted tape-breakers, Chapman romped home in the mile,
the first event of the day, half a yard ahead of Colglazier and yards ahead
of Doyle of California. The pace was too fast for Carlisle, and he could not
sprint himself into third.

Half an hour later Chapman again
broke the tape ahead of Colglazier,
this time in the two-mile. No Cali
fornia man was anywhere around at
the finish, Samis, as the third Cardi
nal runner, having left them far be
hind. Chapman's time was within two
seconds of the Stanford-California
record. Colglazier's six points in
these two long events constituted a
remarkable performance. By way of
a finishing touch Chapman set the
pace in the half mile a few moments
later.
Davis Gathers Points.
Davis seemed to be here, there, and
everywhere gathering points for Stan
ford. First place in the high hurdles
did not bother him to any extent, and
lie mixed a little pole vaulting in with
his rest period before the low hurdles,
which latter event he added to Stan
ford's first place totals. He scored
third in the pole. A few moments
later he leaped almost twenty-one feet
for a win in the broad jump. He was
willing to conclude his remarkable
and seldom-equaled achievements by

running a relay lap, but it was con
sidered that lie had well earned a rest.

jump, leaping 5 feet 11 1-2 inches. His
teammate Heath scored the three
points for second place and left third
to California's best. Davis showed
his versatility and his ability to send
gloom to the Blue and Gold by win
ning the broad jump. Lyon jumped
into second place, leaping close be
hind Davis.
California returned Stanford's com
pliment in the jumps by scoring six
teen points in the weights. Curtice
scored the lone Cardinal point in the
hammer throw, by finishing third in
fast company. Weitzel was the point
getter in the shot put and won his
vault by showing the form that dis
tinguished him in his prep school
days and leaping 11 feet 3 inches for a
second place and three points.
The relay team went with the 220
as the other disappointment of the
meet. The Stanford team, composed
of B. F. Davis, McCloskey, McPherson,
and Maynard, had apparently won this
event with a good fifty yards to spare,
making the score 75 to 47, when it
was discovered that Davis had acci
dentally fouled the first California
runner on the turn. The Stanford
team was disqualified, and their five
points given to California. The de
cision of the track judges cost Mc-
Closkey his varsity letter, as he had
been saved especially for the relay.
Stanford's victory was a decisive
one. First place in every track event,
save one and the flake relay, went to
the Cardinal, and in the field events,
where the Blue and Gold strength was
considered far superior, a difference
of only one point in California's favor
separated the two teams. Stanford's
victory was a-hieved without the aid
of professional services, and with only
one varsity track "S" veteran of pre
vious years. With "Art" Wilson, the
man who helped get the team in shape
and then left for the government serv
ice a week before his "big day," "Jud"
House or "Dink" Templeton, who bpth
left for the service since the season
started, on hand to tally for the Farm,
Stanford's victory would have been
still more overwhelming.

Running true to form in most of the events, excelling even optimistic
forecast in many others, and falling down in only two instances, the Stanford
varsity track team triumphed Saturday for the sixth successive time over its
Berkeley rival, to the tune of 70 to 52. Some three thousand spectators were
on hand to cheer and lend color to Stanford's dramatic exit from intercollegiate
athletics, and the majority of them gloried in the jubilant serpentine that
celebrated the victory of the uncoached, war-weakened Cardinal over Walter
Christie's fondly cherished Bears.
Upon "Gene" Davis as the big point-winner, upon Chapman as the active
and successful captain ,and upon "Ken" Lilly as the gamest man who ever
wore Stanford track and baseball spikes in the same day, the rooters' mem
ory of Stanford's last big day of intercollegiate athletics fondly lingers. These
three men were the stars of the big meet, but there were many others who
came into favor with the lenient critics in the grandstand.
Lilly, Davis, and Chapman Star.
Davis' performance was reminiscent of the days of "Feg" Murray and
past Stanford stars, while Chapman's work was distinctly new. Starting the
procession of red-shirted tape-breakers, Chapman romped home in the mile,
the first event of the day, half a yard ahead of Colglazier and yards ahead
of Doyle of California. The pace was too fast for Carlisle, and he could not
sprint himself into third.

Half an hour later Chapman again
broke the tape ahead of Colglazier,
this time in the two-mile. No Cali
fornia man was anywhere around at
the finish, Samis, as the third Cardi
nal runner, having left them far be
hind. Chapman's time was within two
seconds of the Stanford-California
record. Colglazier's six points in
these two long events constituted a
remarkable performance. By way of
a finishing touch Chapman set the
pace in the half mile a few moments
later.
Davis Gathers Points.
Davis seemed to be here, there, and
everywhere gathering points for Stan
ford. First place in the high hurdles
did not bother him to any extent, and
lie mixed a little pole vaulting in with
his rest period before the low hurdles,
which latter event he added to Stan
ford's first place totals. He scored
third in the pole. A few moments
later he leaped almost twenty-one feet
for a win in the broad jump. He was
willing to conclude his remarkable
and seldom-equaled achievements by

running a relay lap, but it was con
sidered that lie had well earned a rest.
Lilly Springs Surprise.
To everyone except those of his
friends who knew his real ability,
"Ken" Lilly's win in the century came
as a distinct surprise. That Lilly had
seldom been 011 a cinder path before,
that he finished the distance in 10 1-5
seconds and that he showed a clean
pair of heels to California's best are
facts worthy of notice, but that he
did all this with an ankle that had
been injured in the ball game in the
morning makes the feat all the more
remarkable.
In a day of features, Maynard's de
cisive victory over the Blue and Gold
skipper. Moody, in the quarter mile,
still stands out as sensational. Tak
ing the turn from California's star,
leading him all the way on the back
stretch despite the latter's strenuous
efforts to pass him, and increasing his
lead to a good three yards on the
home stretch constitute a perform
ance that the Cardinal rooters will
give a permanent place in Stanford's
track glories. Maynard's time was 51
flat. McPherson ran a heady race and
won his letter with a third place.
Moody Outclassed in Half.
Again in the half mile the vaunted
Moody went down to defeat, this time
to Horn, the winner, and Teitsworth,
who finished second. Chapman went
into this event to set the pace and
wear the opposition down. That he
was successful can be attested by the
result. Chapman dropped out on the
last lap-and Teitsworth took the lead,
only to be passed at the finish by his
teammate, Horn.
The sprints proved a disappoint
ment, with the exception of Lilly's
performance in the hundred. "Barb"
Davis scored third in the (-lose finish
of the 220, pressing the heels of John
son, the winner, and Cantelow, the
second-place man.
Rogers surprised the stands by tak
ing third in the high hurdles. In the
first race, the finish was declared a
tie for third between Mohr and Rog
ers, but in the run-off the Stanford
man clearly demonstrated his supe
riority over his Berkeley rival.
Glikbarg experienced hard luck in
the low hurdles by tripping over the
last harried. He was in thrid place
at the time.
Kisrlit Cardinal Points in Both .hinips.
The jumps were a source of Cardi
nal points, sixteen being acquired in
the broad and high. Weaver came
through in great style in the high
jump, leaping 5 feet 11 1-2 inches. His
teammate Heath scored the three
points for second place and left third
to California's best. Davis showed
his versatility and his ability to send
gloom to the Blue and Gold by win

Running true to form in most of the events, excelling even optimistic
forecast in many others, and falling down in only two instances, the Stanford
varsity track team triumphed Saturday for the sixth successive time over its
Berkeley rival, to the tune of 70 to 52. Some three thousand spectators were
on hand to cheer and lend color to Stanford's dramatic exit from intercollegiate
athletics, and the majority of them gloried in the jubilant serpentine that
celebrated the victory of the uncoached, war-weakened Cardinal over Walter
Christie's fondly cherished Bears.
Upon "Gene" Davis as the big point-winner, upon Chapman as the active
and successful captain ,and upon "Ken" Lilly as the gamest man who ever
wore Stanford track and baseball spikes in the same day, the rooters' mem
ory of Stanford's last big day of intercollegiate athletics fondly lingers. These
three men were the stars of the big meet, but there were many others who
came into favor with the lenient critics in the grandstand.
Lilly, Davis, and Chapman Star.
Davis' performance was reminiscent of the days of "Feg" Murray and
past Stanford stars, while Chapman's work was distinctly new. Starting the
procession of red-shirted tape-breakers, Chapman romped home in the mile,
the first event of the day, half a yard ahead of Colglazier and yards ahead
of Doyle of California. The pace was too fast for Carlisle, and he could not
sprint himself into third.

Half an hour later Chapman again
broke the tape ahead of Colglazier,
this time in the two-mile. No Cali
fornia man was anywhere around at
the finish, Samis, as the third Cardi
nal runner, having left them far be
hind. Chapman's time was within two
seconds of the Stanford-California
record. Colglazier's six points in
these two long events constituted a
remarkable performance. By way of
a finishing touch Chapman set the
pace in the half mile a few moments
later.
Davis Gathers Points.
Davis seemed to be here, there, and
everywhere gathering points for Stan
ford. First place in the high hurdles
did not bother him to any extent, and
lie mixed a little pole vaulting in with
his rest period before the low hurdles,
which latter event he added to Stan
ford's first place totals. He scored
third in the pole. A few moments
later he leaped almost twenty-one feet
for a win in the broad jump. He was
willing to conclude his remarkable
and seldom-equaled achievements by

running a relay lap, but it was con
sidered that lie had well earned a rest.
Lilly Springs Surprise.
To everyone except those of his
friends who knew his real ability,
"Ken" Lilly's win in the century came
as a distinct surprise. That Lilly had
seldom been 011 a cinder path before,
that he finished the distance in 10 1-5
seconds and that he showed a clean
pair of heels to California's best are
facts worthy of notice, but that he
did all this with an ankle that had
been injured in the ball game in the
morning makes the feat all the more
remarkable.
In a day of features, Maynard's de
cisive victory over the Blue and Gold
skipper. Moody, in the quarter mile,
still stands out as sensational. Tak
ing the turn from California's star,
leading him all the way on the back
stretch despite the latter's strenuous
efforts to pass him, and increasing his
lead to a good three yards on the
home stretch constitute a perform
ance that the Cardinal rooters will
give a permanent place in Stanford's
track glories. Maynard's time was 51
flat. McPherson ran a heady race and
won his letter with a third place.
Moody Outclassed in Half.
Again in the half mile the vaunted
Moody went down to defeat, this time
to Horn, the winner, and Teitsworth,
who finished second. Chapman went
into this event to set the pace and
wear the opposition down. That he
was successful can be attested by the
result. Chapman dropped out on the
last lap-and Teitsworth took the lead,
only to be passed at the finish by his
teammate, Horn.
The sprints proved a disappoint
ment, with the exception of Lilly's
performance in the hundred. "Barb"
Davis scored third in the (-lose finish
of the 220, pressing the heels of John
son, the winner, and Cantelow, the
second-place man.
Rogers surprised the stands by tak
ing third in the high hurdles. In the
first race, the finish was declared a
tie for third between Mohr and Rog
ers, but in the run-off the Stanford
man clearly demonstrated his supe
riority over his Berkeley rival.
Glikbarg experienced hard luck in
the low hurdles by tripping over the
last harried. He was in thrid place
at the time.
Kisrlit Cardinal Points in Both .hinips.
The jumps were a source of Cardi
nal points, sixteen being acquired in
the broad and high. Weaver came
through in great style in the high
jump, leaping 5 feet 11 1-2 inches. His
teammate Heath scored the three
points for second place and left third
to California's best. Davis showed
his versatility and his ability to send
gloom to the Blue and Gold by win
ning the broad jump. Lyon jumped
into second place, leaping close be
hind Davis.
California returned Stanford's com
pliment in the jumps by scoring six
teen points in the weights. Curtice
scored the lone Cardinal point in the
hammer throw, by finishing third in
fast company. Weitzel was the point
getter in the shot put and won his
vault by showing the form that dis
tinguished him in his prep school
days and leaping 11 feet 3 inches for a
second place and three points.
The relay team went with the 220
as the other disappointment of the
meet. The Stanford team, composed
of B. F. Davis, McCloskey, McPherson,
and Maynard, had apparently won this
event with a good fifty yards to spare,
making the score 75 to 47, when it
was discovered that Davis had acci
dentally fouled the first California
runner on the turn. The Stanford
team was disqualified, and their five
points given to California. The de
cision of the track judges cost Mc-
Closkey his varsity letter, as he had
been saved especially for the relay.
Stanford's victory was a decisive
one. First place in every track event,
save one and the flake relay, went to
the Cardinal, and in the field events,
where the Blue and Gold strength was
considered far superior, a difference
of only one point in California's favor
separated the two teams. Stanford's
victory was a-hieved without the aid
of professional services, and with only
one varsity track "S" veteran of pre
vious years. With "Art" Wilson, the
man who helped get the team in shape
and then left for the government serv
ice a week before his "big day," "Jud"
House or "Dink" Templeton, who bpth
left for the service since the season
started, on hand to tally for the Farm,
Stanford's victory would have been
still more overwhelming.

on hand to cheer and lend color to Stanford's dramatic exit from intercollegiate
athletics, and the majority of them gloried in the jubilant serpentine that
celebrated the victory of the uncoached, war-weakened Cardinal over Walter
Christie's fondly cherished Bears.
Upon "Gene" Davis as the big point-winner, upon Chapman as the active
and successful captain ,and upon "Ken" Lilly as the gamest man who ever
wore Stanford track and baseball spikes in the same day, the rooters' mem
ory of Stanford's last big day of intercollegiate athletics fondly lingers. These
three men were the stars of the big meet, but there were many others who
came into favor with the lenient critics in the grandstand.
Lilly, Davis, and Chapman Star.
Davis' performance was reminiscent of the days of "Feg" Murray and
past Stanford stars, while Chapman's work was distinctly new. Starting the
procession of red-shirted tape-breakers, Chapman romped home in the mile,
the first event of the day, half a yard ahead of Colglazier and yards ahead
of Doyle of California. The pace was too fast for Carlisle, and he could not
sprint himself into third.

Half an hour later Chapman again
broke the tape ahead of Colglazier,
this time in the two-mile. No Cali
fornia man was anywhere around at
the finish, Samis, as the third Cardi
nal runner, having left them far be
hind. Chapman's time was within two
seconds of the Stanford-California
record. Colglazier's six points in
these two long events constituted a
remarkable performance. By way of
a finishing touch Chapman set the
pace in the half mile a few moments
later.
Davis Gathers Points.
Davis seemed to be here, there, and
everywhere gathering points for Stan
ford. First place in the high hurdles
did not bother him to any extent, and
lie mixed a little pole vaulting in with
his rest period before the low hurdles,
which latter event he added to Stan
ford's first place totals. He scored
third in the pole. A few moments
later he leaped almost twenty-one feet
for a win in the broad jump. He was
willing to conclude his remarkable
and seldom-equaled achievements by

running a relay lap, but it was con
sidered that lie had well earned a rest.
Lilly Springs Surprise.
To everyone except those of his
friends who knew his real ability,
"Ken" Lilly's win in the century came
as a distinct surprise. That Lilly had
seldom been 011 a cinder path before,
that he finished the distance in 10 1-5
seconds and that he showed a clean
pair of heels to California's best are
facts worthy of notice, but that he
did all this with an ankle that had
been injured in the ball game in the
morning makes the feat all the more
remarkable.
In a day of features, Maynard's de
cisive victory over the Blue and Gold
skipper. Moody, in the quarter mile,
still stands out as sensational. Tak
ing the turn from California's star,
leading him all the way on the back
stretch despite the latter's strenuous
efforts to pass him, and increasing his
lead to a good three yards on the
home stretch constitute a perform
ance that the Cardinal rooters will
give a permanent place in Stanford's
track glories. Maynard's time was 51
flat. McPherson ran a heady race and
won his letter with a third place.
Moody Outclassed in Half.
Again in the half mile the vaunted
Moody went down to defeat, this time
to Horn, the winner, and Teitsworth,
who finished second. Chapman went
into this event to set the pace and
wear the opposition down. That he
was successful can be attested by the
result. Chapman dropped out on the
last lap-and Teitsworth took the lead,
only to be passed at the finish by his
teammate, Horn.
The sprints proved a disappoint
ment, with the exception of Lilly's
performance in the hundred. "Barb"
Davis scored third in the (-lose finish
of the 220, pressing the heels of John
son, the winner, and Cantelow, the
second-place man.
Rogers surprised the stands by tak
ing third in the high hurdles. In the
first race, the finish was declared a
tie for third between Mohr and Rog
ers, but in the run-off the Stanford
man clearly demonstrated his supe
riority over his Berkeley rival.
Glikbarg experienced hard luck in
the low hurdles by tripping over the
last harried. He was in thrid place
at the time.
Kisrlit Cardinal Points in Both .hinips.
The jumps were a source of Cardi
nal points, sixteen being acquired in
the broad and high. Weaver came
through in great style in the high
jump, leaping 5 feet 11 1-2 inches. His
teammate Heath scored the three
points for second place and left third
to California's best. Davis showed
his versatility and his ability to send
gloom to the Blue and Gold by win
ning the broad jump. Lyon jumped
into second place, leaping close be
hind Davis.
California returned Stanford's com
pliment in the jumps by scoring six
teen points in the weights. Curtice
scored the lone Cardinal point in the
hammer throw, by finishing third in
fast company. Weitzel was the point
getter in the shot put and won his
vault by showing the form that dis
tinguished him in his prep school
days and leaping 11 feet 3 inches for a
second place and three points.
The relay team went with the 220
as the other disappointment of the
meet. The Stanford team, composed
of B. F. Davis, McCloskey, McPherson,
and Maynard, had apparently won this
event with a good fifty yards to spare,
making the score 75 to 47, when it
was discovered that Davis had acci
dentally fouled the first California
runner on the turn. The Stanford
team was disqualified, and their five
points given to California. The de
cision of the track judges cost Mc-
Closkey his varsity letter, as he had
been saved especially for the relay.
Stanford's victory was a decisive
one. First place in every track event,
save one and the flake relay, went to
the Cardinal, and in the field events,
where the Blue and Gold strength was
considered far superior, a difference
of only one point in California's favor
separated the two teams. Stanford's
victory was a-hieved without the aid
of professional services, and with only
one varsity track "S" veteran of pre
vious years. With "Art" Wilson, the
man who helped get the team in shape
and then left for the government serv
ice a week before his "big day," "Jud"
House or "Dink" Templeton, who bpth
left for the service since the season
started, on hand to tally for the Farm,
Stanford's victory would have been
still more overwhelming.

Running true to form in most of the events, excelling even optimistic
forecast in many others, and falling down in only two instances, the Stanford
varsity track team triumphed Saturday for the sixth successive time over its
Berkeley rival, to the tune of 70 to 52. Some three thousand spectators were
on hand to cheer and lend color to Stanford's dramatic exit from intercollegiate
athletics, and the majority of them gloried in the jubilant serpentine that
