# "RUSSIAN REVOLUTION" IS DISCUSSED BY MR. STEFFENS
## IS SPEAKER AT ASSEMBLY Member of Root Commission Says Revolution Was Not Plotted For 
### 
"For the Russians the Russian rev
olution is THE revolution —a revolu
tion for all peoples. When word *of
the events in Petrograd reached the
men in the trenches they did not stop
fighting then although it was the only
ray of light which had ever entered
the lives of the Russian people—the
only message ever received of any
happiness to them. They crawled
over to the enemy trenches to tell the
Germans about it. As Kerensky ex
pressed it —'Think of it—two and three
hundred miles of Russian peasants
talking to two and three hundred
miles of German peasants.'" Such
was the message of the real meaning
of the Russian revolution which Lin
coln Steffens, member of the Root
commission, gave this morning in the
University assembly.
In a brilliant address Mr. Steffens
traced the events of the revolution
and gave a vivid explanation of the
import of events in Russia and their
relation to the problems of the war.
"The Russian revolution was not
plotted for," said Lincoln Steffens.
"It was not a man-made revolution,
but was prepared for by the students
through a system of propaganda under
which students voluntarily undertook
to the knowledge of the evils
of the old regime through the villages
of Russia. But the government knew
a revolution was coming for they
were ready for the mobs of Petrograd
with machine guns mounted on the
tops of buildings.
"Russians of all classes believe to
day that it was through Rasputin,
who gave the impetus to the fall of
the Romanoffs, and his ring, that the
Germans secured control of the Rus
sian fighting forces in the early bat
tles. The imperial staff of high com
mand used the situation following the
revolution for their own ends, to wield
the grejn; body of helpless, stupid Rus
sians.
"'We, the people, must not do unto
others the things which have been
done to us,' said Kerensky, head of the
provisional government, and follow
ing that great democratic motto the
revolution was not one of killing and
looting. The Russians do not want to
r!o what the government did and that
is why they are so reluctant to set
uj) a strong, centralized government
at the present time —they fear the
evils which oppressed them under the
old regime."
In speaking of the significance of
the Russian revolution in relation to
modern movements, Mr. Steffens said
that the reason recent attempts to
solve social problems have failed is
because all thinking in relation to
them has been done along moral and
political lines—the actual remedy—
readjustment of the great economic
forces has been neglected.%
"The government machine of the
provisional government of Russia is
cumbersome and unwieldy but its
leaders are too busy for politics—they
are occupied with economic problems,
the causes of political evils," declared
Mr. Steffens.
