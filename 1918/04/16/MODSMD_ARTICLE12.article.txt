### 
Stanford audiences will be given
the opportunity to hear Israel Zang
well's play, "The Melting Pot," read
by Professor S. 11. Clark this evening
in the Little Theater at 7:30. The
play is one of human interest, strongly
dramatic, and particularly appropriate
at the present time. The story is
woven about this country, the United
States, as the melting pot of the world.
To it come emigrants from foreign
nations with different languages and
different characteristics. Here they
are fused into one great nation, whose
mode of living is a combination of
those of other lands.
Professor Clark, who will read the
play, is said to be one of America's
best readers, and is well known
throughout California, having visited
here before. He is also a prominent
lecturer, and for the past few weeks
has been speaKing in the prominent
flubs and schools in the state on prob
lems connected with the war. lie
comes from the University of Chicago,
where he is head of the department of
Public Speaking.
