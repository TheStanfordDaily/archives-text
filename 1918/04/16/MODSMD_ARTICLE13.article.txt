sonal friend of the Herbert C. Hoov
ers, who has just returned from

with Dr. Wilbur. Her talk carries a
challenge against the indifference of
the American people, which, she says,
is a result of the German propaganda,
and also a challenge in reply to the
German taunt that America could not
back her army with a unified civilian
population.
"Americans are not afraid to know
the truth of the war situation," says
Dr. Wilbur, "and there is no reason
v, hy they should not have the trutli
presented to them."
According to Dr. Wilbur, only
glossed over reports have been re
ceived by our newspapers and the seri
ousness of the German submarine
successes and the results of the recent
German drive have been kept in the
dark for fear it would arouse undue
excitement in the American populace.
Dr. Wilbur is well informed along
these lines and should have a message

on "over there" and what must be
done "over here."
In addition to the lectures, a mili
tary band from Camp Fremont has
