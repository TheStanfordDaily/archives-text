with right spirit and unquestioned loy

pressure upon locating and pending all
who have been asked for and more.
You cannot send too many and there
is work for all who come â€”in fact, this
matter is so vital that you may think
it necessary to organize on even larger
scale committees for men and women
who will devote their entire time and
attention to the subject.'
