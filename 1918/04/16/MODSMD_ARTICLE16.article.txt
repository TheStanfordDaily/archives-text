# ANOTHER CHANCE FOR SUPPORT
## 
### 
Another chance to support one of the war necessities will be offered
when the Players' Club of San Francisco presents a bill in the Assembly
Hall for the benefit of the Palo Alto Chapter of the Red Cross Thursday night.
Despite the fact that millions of dollars have been subscribed by the Ameri
can people to the Red Cross, the call is coming out all the time for more
funds to support the hospitals in France and the cantonments in America.
Thursday's entertainment will supply an opportunity to furnish these funds.
Stanford University has been behind other universities of the country
in the national drives for funds. Colleges in many places have conducted
strenuous campaigns for Liberty bonds and thrift stamps, while these things
have received little notice here. The University of California has already
subscribed $25,000 in bonds of the third Liberty loan, in addition to thousands
of dollars for other loans, while the campaign for thrift stamps is being con
ducted continuously.
When an opportunity is offered to witness a good performance by well
known players ,and when the funds from this entertainment are to be given
to the Red Cross, the University community should turn out in force for sup
port. The performance Thursday is being advertised up and down the
Peninsula as one of the* big things of the year. Palo Alto people have already
bought tickets in large numbers. It is up to the student body to get in line.

In line with conservation of leather and tempers, it would be well for
the University to complete the walk across the new road which has been
cut from Lasuen to the new Lagunita road. Hundreds of men and women
pass over the rocks which serve for a path every day, the University
officials have allowed the road to remain incomplete for several months.
