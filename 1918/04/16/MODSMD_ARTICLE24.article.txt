# FREE LAW CLINIC FOR SOLDIERS ORGANIZED
## Legal Students Will Advise Fremont Men in Civil, Military Cases 
### 
Free legal advice for the soldiers
of Camp Fremont is the purpose of a
law clinic that the Law department
of the University has just formed.
The clinic was formed at the request
of the Red Cross branch at the camp.
Five of the seniors in law are acting
as advisers and are keeping consul
tation hours every afternoon at the
office of C. B. Whittier, professor of
law, in the Law department, from 1
to 4:30.
Already several interesting cases
have come up for attention. They
have been problems which deal prin
cipally with the new conditions that
army life has brought about, such as
those concerning the new civil rights
act, questions on different aspects of
military law, and other civil matters
which are due to the changed condi
tions resulting from the war. Mat
ters of every-day life are also being
brought to the clinic, such as ordinary
business complications and the draw
ing up of wills.
The work is being done under the
general supervision of the faculty, but
the students are giving their time free
and will receive no credit. It is hoped
by the faculty that the clinic will not
only be a help to the men at the camp
who need advice, but furthermore will
be an excellent means of practice for
the students- of the law school who
participate in it.
