Demand by the federal government
for trained entomologists is far
greater than it is possible to meet,
says Professor S. J. Hunter of the
Department of Entomolgy in the Uni
versity of Kansas. Professor Hunter
believes that this sudden demand is
largely due to the fact that food con
servation is the question of the hour.
He now has on hand requests for en
tomologists at salaries ranging from
$1200 to $2500, which he is unablo to
fill at present.
