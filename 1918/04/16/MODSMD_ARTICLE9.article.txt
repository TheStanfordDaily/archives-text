# W.R. DURAND WRITES LETTER FROM PARIS
## Speaks of German Big Gun. Says People of France In Good Spirits 
### 
Professor H. J. Ryan of the Elec
trical Engineering department is in
receipt, of a most interesting letter
from W. P. Durand, former professor
of Mechanical Engineering at Stan
ford.
* The letter was written in Paris dur
ing the start of the present German
offensive, and describes the German
big gun, as well as air raids over the
French capital.
Professor Durand spent the last
year in Washington in attendance on
the sessions of the American Aircraft
Commission. He left for England at
the first of the yehr, spending some
two or three weeks in London, wlvore
he was engaged in his duties as a
member of the International Aircraft
Standards Commission.
The letter is as follows:
March 27 (six clays after the start
of the German offensive).
Mr. Dear Professor Ryan:
We are just now in the midst of the
great German offensive and every day
is charged with the most serious pos
sibilities. I suppose you are getting
the same news we are and very likely
more of it. I am wondering if ihc
papers in the states are talking about
the bombardment of Paris by a Ger
man gun of long range located at a
distance of some seventy miles. We
have had three days of shells, 240
mm., apparently, coming from some
whore at rather regular intervals of
ten to fifteen minutes during a good
part of daylight. The damage so far
is small. It is moot astonishing if it.
is a gun and it is very difficult to ex
plain it on any other assumption. Yes
terday and today, so far. the gun lias
been quiet. .The reason is not known
—at least to the general public.
The French here in Paris are gen
erally In good spirits and are imbued
with confidence. They fully realize,
however, the importance of what the
next few days of the present drive
may bring forth. Long before this let
ter reaches you. the results of this
particular offensive will have been de
veloped and will be known, .lust now,
however, all is uncertain, and there is
a good deal of tenseness in the air,
as indeed I presume there is all over
the states as well.
In addition to the "gun" we have
had a number of air raids here lately;*
• there were also three while I was in
London. The more I see of them the
more important such operations be
come in my opinion, only in order to
accomplish anythiife really significant,
planes are needed in very large num
bers. A few are of no significance,
whatever, except to annoy and dis
turb the orderly life of a big city. If
the results are to be of military sig
nificance we must have bombing
planes by the thousands. There are
lots of things that I should like to tell
you about and which you would be
much interested -in hearing, but the
censor would probably cut it out, so
that it's hardly worth the undertak
ing. However, I amjooking forward
every day to a return sometime to the
peaceful quiet- life of the University
and my farm on the hill, and then I
can tell you some things without hav
ing to ask the censor.
Sincerely yours,
W. F. DURAND.
