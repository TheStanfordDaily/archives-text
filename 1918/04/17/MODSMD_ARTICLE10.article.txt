# WOMEN GET PLEDGE CARDS TO SIGN FOR AGRICULTURAL UNIT
## 
### 
Pledge cards for the proposed
women's agricultural unit have been
distributed among all the members of
the "500." At Monday and Tuesday
evening house meetings the cards
were given to women living on the
campus. The cards were mailed yes
terday to Palo Alto women and com
muters.
On each pledge card was the follow
ing:
"I, , pledge my services
for (three weeks mini
mum time) to the Stanford women's
agricultural unit connected with the
Women's Land Army of America.
"If you cannot fill out the above,
what war work will you do this sum
mer?"
The aim of the committee In charge
is to have Jevery Stanford woman
sign up for the agricultural unit or
to have an adequate reason for not
doing so in the fact that she is def
initely planning to enter some other
field of war service.
The pledge cards will be in the
hands of the women who received
them for about a week. On Monday,
Apjil 22, they will be collected from
campus women's groups and com
muters will be expected to mail their
cards to Miss Katherine Ames by that
time.
