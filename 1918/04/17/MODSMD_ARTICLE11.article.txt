## 
### 
"There is but one solution to the
problem of the fostering bate which
keeps nations apart, and that is the
principle of love," said Professor
Tlark last night in his introduction to
Zangwill's "The Melting Pot." "Un
til all nations cultivate this principle,
there can be no successful leagues of
peace.
"The age-long race hatred is inher
ently dramatic,"'" he continued, "but
as the Jew and the Gentile in this
story overcome hate, so also may the
nations of the world overcome their
hatred for one another."
"The Melting Pot," which Professor
Clark read, is a play of heart inter
est, particularly timely in the light of
the past year's events, and was mas
terfully handled. Professor Clark is
an experienced and pleasing orator,
and made the most of the dramatic
situations.
The story is laid in that part of New
York Known as the Bronx. The boy,
a great violinist, is a Russian Jew,
having come to this country after the
death of his family at the hands of
the Gentiles. Here he has found free
dom from persecution, and has
evolved the idea that "America is God's
crucible, where all races are fused
into one great nation —a nation of
super-men."
The girl, also a Russian, is a Chris
tian. Though unknown to the boy or
herself, her father was in command
of the soldiers who massacred his par
ents. Love comes to the two, and in
the ignorance of these facts they are
happy. When they find out the true
conditions there comcs the testing
point of their lives. But the Russian
Jew "casts all into the crucible" and
forgets his racial hatred of the Chris
tians.
