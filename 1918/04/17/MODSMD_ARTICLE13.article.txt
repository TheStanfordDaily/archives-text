# BLUE AND GOLD TAKE BASEBALL SERIES BY WINNING FOURTH GAME
## 
### 
Scoring a 4 to 2 victory over the
Stanford nine, the Blue and Gold base
ball team stored away the 1918 inter
collegiate series yesterday afternoon.
The game was played on the Califor
nia diamond.
Ellison, the lanky California hurler,
again came to the front when he held
the Cardinals hitless for the first six
innings. His work during the entire
series, although flashy and unsteady,
was the biggest factor in cinching the
series for California.
Lifur's pitching was not up to its
usual standard and the Bruins picked
off numerous hits throughout the
game.
Dickey and Galloway secured the
only two hits for the Cardinal team
and no one was able to make the
round of the diamond. Hudson was
the chief offender for California, se
curing two of their seven hits. Hen
sel, Sliephard, and Orchison were re
sponsible for California's four runs.
Ellison's wild pitches and Dexter's
inability to hold the ball made the
game uncertain until the very last.
Stanford's two runs were scored in
(lie seventh and eighth frames, when
the Cardinals began to get a line of
the California pitcher's ball.
This game concludes the 1918 vars
ity season. The box score:
