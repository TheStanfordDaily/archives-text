# THE 						1919 QUAD
## 
### 
Stanford will be given an opportunity to get the only complete record
of the University during war times when the 1919 Quad is put on sale some
time in May. The task of getting the annual out this year has been one to
tax the ability of a superhuman management and editorial staff, but the task
has been accomplished, despite the difficulties, and it is up to the student
body to make the task worth while.
Calls have come out all year for support of college activities to tide them
over their difficulties, but many of these calls have been for donations with
no particular return promised. The Quad needs support as badly as any other
organization on the campus, and for the support a return will be given that
will grow more valuable as the post-collegiate days pass.
The annual will have a military section this year that will be worth the
value of the book itself. A picture of a majority of the men in the service
will be included, in addition to the pictures and record of the Reserve Officers'
Training Corps.
The Quad may not seem so necessary when students are in college, but
it grows more valuable each year. The annual is the only book that perpetu
ates the memories of the college year, after these memories have passed.
When the management puts the year book on sale, the full edition should be
bought immediately.
