# Cider, Speeches and Music Will Feature Year's Union Smoker and Carnival Tonight
## 
### 
One of those real old-time Union
smokers, and all that goes with it,
will happen tonight. Not only smokes,
but. barrels of cider, boxing matches,
and talks of every species will be on
the program.
Tf it is true that nothing sounds so
sweet as the human voice—when you
are doing the talking—then there will
surely be sweet sounds in abundance
issuing from the windows of the
Union, for the open discussion of Stan
ford's position in the athletic world
i will give everyone a chance to talk.
This, the first and last Union
| smoker of the year 1918, will have to
contain enough "pep" for the whole
' year, and the schedule of events prom
-1 ises that the jubilee will fill the bill
in ample shape.
Everyone (meaning all the men) is
invited to help tap (he keg of jazz and
cider, and the committee promises
plenty of all varieties of smokes in ad
i dition to the speakers and program.
