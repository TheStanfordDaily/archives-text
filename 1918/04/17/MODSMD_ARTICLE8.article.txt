# PLAYERS' CLUB TO APPEAR TOMORROW TO AID RED CROSS
## TALENTED CAST TO GIVE ONE-ACT PLAYS Proceeds of Program Will Relieve Local Needs of War Emergency 
### 
Four charming numbers are to be
given by the Players' Club of San
Francisco in the Assembly Hall to
morrow evening, for the benefit of
the local Red Cross.
Three of the numbers are to be one
act skits and the fourth will be an
operetta. The Players' Club, which is
similar to the Washington Square
Players in New York, specializes in
short plays and skits. They have been
putting on productions in their opera
house in San Francisco for the past
few years.
Reginald Travers, who is directing
the presentation, has coached many
other successful programs for the club,
and there is no doubt but that he will
meet the greatest expectations of the
audience.
Two comedies, a harlequinade and
an operetta constitute the program.
"The Merry D&ath" is a charming har
lequinade from the Russian of
Evreinov; "The Rose of Auvergne," is
one of Offenbach's delightful operettas,
while "The Price of Orchids" and "Big
Kate" are two entertaining comedies.
Although the sale of tickets has
been good, there are still seats for
sale at the Bookstore and at Wein
gartner's drug store in Palo Alto. The
price of admission to reserved seats
is 75 cents and $1.
