## TO BE HELD SATURDAY Student Body Tickets Will Admitâ€”Starts at 2:30. P.A.A. Meet Soon 
### 
Although the track season officially
closed with the victory over Califor
nia last Saturday afternoon, two meets
in which the Cardinal speedsters will
receive competition are slated for the
next two weeks. This Saturday aitei
noon a strong team from Fremont will
journey over to the farm oval and at
tempt to get revenge for the defeat
administered to them three weeks
ago, when the varsity won G2 to (JO.
A week later the red jerseys will be
in evidence on the California track
in the annual Pacific Athletic Asso
ciation championship meet. Stanford
will probably enter a strong team in
both these meets, as the men plan
tapering off the season with the ex
cellent competition offered by the run
ners from Fremont and the teams en
tered in the coast championships.
The Fremont runners threw a de
cided scare into the college track men
in their meet three weeks ago, but the
soldiers have been weakened since
then by the absence of "Jud" House,
who is at present in the Fremont Base
Hospital undergoing a minor opera
tion.
A special relay event will feature
the meet, as a team of twenty-four
members of the R. O. T. C. will com
pete for Stanford against twenty-four
runners from the camp in a relay con
test. Each man will run a quarter
mile, as in the Irish marathon, but
the men will run in their regulation
uniforms, minus heavy equipment.
The soldiers boast of a fast team and
are lookirg forward to a victory.
"Flic" 'i'empleton, Muldoon, Lieuten

letes will compete for Fremont, and
the majority of the stars of last
