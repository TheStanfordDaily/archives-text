# EFFICIENT UNDER DIFFICULTIES

### 
it is gratifying to note that the military "higher-ups" were pleased with
the showing made by the Stanford R. O. T. C. in today's review. Military
drill is hard work, though patriotic, and it has been especially difficult this
year, due to the changes in command and in the personnel of the R. O. T. C.
commissioned officers. Men have worked up to lieutenants and captains and
have then left for the front. In spite of this the military students received
the compliments of the reviewing party this morning on their commendable
work.
