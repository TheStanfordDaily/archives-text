# DISCUSSION CLASSES ON DEMOCRACY BEGIN
## 
### 
The discussion classes which are
being formed all over the United
States among the students will begin
at Stanford next week. Rausen
bush's book, "The Social Teachings of
Jesus," is to be used as a text.
A normal class of about twenty-five
girls will meet under Miss Margery
Bailey of the English department,
every Friday, from 1 to 2 o'clock, and
these girls will in turn go out and
lead their own discussion groups,
which will average ten members.
This movement started at Northfield
during a recent student conference.
Canada, having been in the war longer
and being more awake to the neces
sity of some new working basis,
pledged itself to work for 6G per cent
of its students as members of some
discussion group; the United States
pledged 50 per cent.
To accomplish this, in some places
the president of the university has
started the groups; in some places
the dean of men or women; and in
some it has beefc begun by the Y. W.
C. A. or the Y. M. C. A.
At Stanford the Y. W. C. A. lias
taken up the organization, so that its
students will not lag in the rear of
those who are keenly alive to the na
tional and world problem at other
places. All classes will meet under
their leaders next week. Any women
wishing to join should report to Irene
Bonnett.
