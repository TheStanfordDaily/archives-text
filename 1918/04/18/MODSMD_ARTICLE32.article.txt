# FOOD REGULATIONS TO AFFECT HOUSES
## Questions Concerning Wheat Flour Rules Referred to H.C. Moreno 
### 
Stanford women have a further
chance to prove their patriotism by
compliance with a new action whereby
it is unlawful to hold wheat in ex
cels of one and one-half pounds per
person per week. Blanks are being j
printed in all papers and should be j
filled in by householders with an ex
cess supply and sent at once by mail 1
to the county food administrator.
These blanks will not be distributed, j
but should be tilled in and mailed or i
delivered at once to avoid the possi
bility of search and prosecution.
According to this action no house- j
holder is permitted to purchase at
one time more than forty-nine pounds
of wheat flour in country districts or
more than twenty-four and one-half
pounds of wheat flour in city districts
or to have more than a thirty-day sup- !
ply on hand. This supply is based on
an allowance of six pounds per person
per month, and where the family buys
its broad the amount of flour in this
bread should be counted in the esti
mate. A fraternity serving less than
sixty meals a day will be classified as
a household.
Any question concerning the inter
pretation or the infringement of the
rules should be referred to the local
representative, Mr. H. C. Moreno.
Blanks are as follows:
Philip M. Lansdale,
Food Administrator for Northern;
Santa Clara County, care The Bank
of Palo Alto, Palo Alto, California.
