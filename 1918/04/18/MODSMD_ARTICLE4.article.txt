"The Merry Death," "The Rose of
Auvergne,'* "The Price of Orchids,"
and "Big Kate" are the four one-act
plays which tlie Players' Club of San
Francisco will present in the Assem
bly Hall tonight for the benefit of the
Red Cross. Casts for the plays have
been chosen from the best talent
which the club has to offer. The pre
sentation is to be directed by Reginald
Travers, who has put on many suc
cessful productions for the Players'
Club and other dramatic organiza
tions.
The first number is a harlequinade

second is an operetta by Offenbach.
The last two numbers are both com

Short plays, operettas, and skits are
the specialties of the Players' Club

Square Players of New York City.
The members of the club have been
putting on productions for the last
two years in San Francisco where they
own their opera house.

limited number of good seats unsold.
