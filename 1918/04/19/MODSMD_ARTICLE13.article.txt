# HEAR ABOUT THE WAR

### 
Secluded as we are on the Stanford campus, it is not surprising that the
greater number of students in the University are hopelessly out of touch with
world affairs and the questions that are vital to existence now. It is strange
that anyone should he wilfully oblivious to what is happening in the world
war. Yet the number of students who are is large.
Heretofore we have had to rely on the more or less unreliable comment
that reaches us through the daily newspapers for our information. Pew fol
low the news from day to day, and of those who do, many do not understand
the trend. There has been a great need for discussion and explanation of the
struggle that is affecting the life of every person on earth.
For this reason the University Committee on War Information has planned
a series of weekly addresses for students and others interested. As President
Wilbur says,"The American people, if it is not to fail in its huge task, must
have full knowledge and strong feeling about the vital urgency and importance
of what it has undertaken, a knowledge and feeling which it is far from yet
having. A well-informed and ardent student body of university men and
women can do much to spread both through the mass of our people."
The opportunity to hear men who have studied and know the situation,
is one that no Stanford student can afford to miss. It is to be hoped that
every student will attend, not one, but every discussion.
