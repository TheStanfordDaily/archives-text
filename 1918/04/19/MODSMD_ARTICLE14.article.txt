Because the regular track season is over, and the "big meet" has been
held, it is to be hoped that the bleachers around the track will not be vacant
Saturday at the contest between the soldiers and the Cardinal cinder path
men. Those who want "sport for sport's sake," irrespective of whether there
is, to lie big intercollegiate competition or not, should be out to witness these
minor meets. The men in uniform gave the Cardinal athletes a scare at the
last meet, and a worthy rival is expected on the field tomorrow. Let's not
have all the rooters clothed in khaki.
