# MISTAKE MADE IN YESTERDAY'S PAPER
## 
### 
That Stanford won the indoor meet
with California Wednesday night was
stated in last night's paper by mis
take. Owing to the fact that the
Berkeley representatives were forced
to leave before the conclusion of the
events, no score was kept, and thus
neither side was declared a winner.
However, the records set in Wednes
day's contest will stand. The meet
was, on the whole, a successful one,
and will probably pave the way for
future competition.
