# Fencing Tourney With California Postponed
## 
### 
The intercollegiate fencing tourna
ment that was scheduled for tonight
between Stanford and California has
been definitely postponed until next
year, owing to a lack of material in
both universities. Stanford was at
first unable to get the required num
ber of fencers and then California met
the same luck, so that it was decided
to postpone the matches until next
year. By this decision neither uni
versity will be declared as forfeiting
the Skelton fencing trophy, competi
tion for the cup merely being put off.
