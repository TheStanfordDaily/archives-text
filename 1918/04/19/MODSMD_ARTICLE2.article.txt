# HOSPITAL BASE 30 ARRIVES IN EAST
## Buford Williams Tells of the Work of Stanford Men in That Unit 
### 
A letter from Buford Williams,,'l6,
former business director of the Daily
Palo Alto, tells of the arrival of Base
.10 of the hospital corps, at Camp
Merritt, New Jersey, and of the posi
tion of the former Stanford men who
are connected with that unit. A large
number of officers of the regiment are
Stanford men. Major Jule B. Franken
heimer. ex-'96, is in command of the
unit.
Besides a major, Stanford is repre
sented in Base 30 by nine sergeants
of various ranks, three corporals, five
first class privates, and six privates.
"Members of the staff (and maybe
friends of the campus)," Williams
writes, "will likely be interested in
knowing that Stanford men have won
a good part of the important 'jobs'
in Base 30. Things stack up like this:
Major, Jule B. Frankenheimer, '96;
sergeants, first class, Buford Williams,
'16, sergeant-major; sergeants, W. I.
Weaver, '13, F. C. Sample, '17, H. P.
Hauser, '18, E. R. Martin, *18, F. M.
Ostrander, '17; mess sergeants, F.
W. Weeks, '18, R. E. McClung, '18, 1.
C. Heron, *18; corporals, E. E. Engels,
17, W. M. Roberts, '18, Howard Pease,
'20; privates, first class, A. P. Batch
elder, 'JB, M. A. Moule, '17, P. M. Shea,
ex-*lB, R. L. Richards, '18, T. G. Marks,
ex-'18; privates, C. M. Chapman, '18,
William King, '19, Martin Debenham,
'20, Jere W. Sheldon, '14, R. W. Sewell,
'20, and G. C. Darrah, '18. That gives
Stanford twelve of the twenty-five
commissioned officers allowed. Some
of the others have taken their exam
inations and will no doubt get promo
tions soon."
The letter reads further as follows:
"I don't know how the others feel
about it (though I can guess), but
yours truly wishes many times that
he had another chance at the old Quad,
and the good times of the campus. We
haven't been very close to the war as
yet, but here's thinking that chance
isn't so far distant. The fact that we
are here at Camp Merritt seems to be
proof of that. We left S. F. March
3d, and came via Panama Canal. It
was a great trip, and showed that
everything about war isn't so bad.
There were many interesting things
about the trip, and many surprises of
a nature we are not supposed to talk
about in letters. Notwithstanding a
few surprises which delayed us some
what, we made the trip in record time,
I believe. If I could tell you the name
of the ship, the speed of the journey
wouldn't surprise you.
"We meet Stanford men here most
every day—on the last lap to beyond.
Some say it seems strange to be 'go
ing west' by an easterly direction, but
that seems rather pessimistic, even
though the Frenchmen do say that
their 'going west' trip is the one they
never live to tell about. (There might
be a bit of humor in that —I say, there
might be.) The real humor asserts
itself when Californians, meaning
Stanford men principally, say they are
going west after the war. When you
begin to carry these trench shoes
around on your feet, however, you
don't construct many prologues to the
big fight. Trench shoes carry you
over the top in mind, if not in body,
right now. Think one kick at a Ger
man would be enough to settle his
grouch. 1 think a little trench psy
chology is about all we lack now. We'll
leave that for time to decide."

itself when Californians, meaning
Stanford men principally, say they are

don't construct many prologues to the

over the top in mind, if not in body,

chology is about all we lack now. We'll

A letter from Buford Williams,,'l6,
former business director of the Daily
Palo Alto, tells of the arrival of Base
.10 of the hospital corps, at Camp
Merritt, New Jersey, and of the posi
tion of the former Stanford men who
are connected with that unit. A large
number of officers of the regiment are
Stanford men. Major Jule B. Franken
heimer. ex-'96, is in command of the
unit.
Besides a major, Stanford is repre
sented in Base 30 by nine sergeants
of various ranks, three corporals, five
first class privates, and six privates.
"Members of the staff (and maybe
friends of the campus)," Williams
writes, "will likely be interested in
knowing that Stanford men have won
a good part of the important 'jobs'
in Base 30. Things stack up like this:

sergeants, first class, Buford Williams,

Stanford twelve of the twenty-five
commissioned officers allowed. Some
of the others have taken their exam
inations and will no doubt get promo
tions soon."
The letter reads further as follows:
"I don't know how the others feel

yours truly wishes many times that

haven't been very close to the war as

isn't so far distant. The fact that we
are here at Camp Merritt seems to be
proof of that. We left S. F. March

was a great trip, and showed that
everything about war isn't so bad.
There were many interesting things
about the trip, and many surprises of
a nature we are not supposed to talk
about in letters. Notwithstanding a
few surprises which delayed us some

I believe. If I could tell you the name
