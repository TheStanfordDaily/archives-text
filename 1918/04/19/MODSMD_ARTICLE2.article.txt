A letter from Buford Williams,,'l6,
former business director of the Daily
Palo Alto, tells of the arrival of Base
.10 of the hospital corps, at Camp
Merritt, New Jersey, and of the posi
tion of the former Stanford men who
are connected with that unit. A large
number of officers of the regiment are
Stanford men. Major Jule B. Franken
heimer. ex-'96, is in command of the
unit.
Besides a major, Stanford is repre
sented in Base 30 by nine sergeants
of various ranks, three corporals, five
first class privates, and six privates.
"Members of the staff (and maybe
friends of the campus)," Williams
writes, "will likely be interested in
knowing that Stanford men have won
a good part of the important 'jobs'
in Base 30. Things stack up like this:
Major, Jule B. Frankenheimer, '96;
sergeants, first class, Buford Williams,
'16, sergeant-major; sergeants, W. I.
Weaver, '13, F. C. Sample, '17, H. P.
Hauser, '18, E. R. Martin, *18, F. M.

W. Weeks, '18, R. E. McClung, '18, 1.
C. Heron, *18; corporals, E. E. Engels,
