# Food Conservation

The United States Food Administra
tion has sent letters to various col
leges, asking that they follow the ex
ample set by the largest hotels of
this country. Most of these large
hotels have pledged themselves to
serve absolutely no wheat until the
j next harvest. The pressing necessity
of substituting other cereals for
wheat was set forth by Dr. Alonzo E.
Taylor, a member of the Food Admin
istration, at a recent meeting of hotel
men. The Food Administration was
confident that college men and women
would also be willing to make a sacri
fice if they could get a clear concep
tion of the situation.
Some of Dr. Taylor's statements of
especially powerful appeal were as
follows. "We have got to reach the
place, each one of us. where we de
fine every decrsion in our lives as an
jact of war policy. Everything that
iwe do, plan, eat, wear, must be an
alysed and measured from one single
point of view—will it contribute to the
carrying on of the war, or will it con
tribute to its prolongation? There is
no other thing in the world for us
but to define everything in our lives
as acts of military necessity or pol
icy."
He goes on to say: "We are accus
tomed to regard wheat as a more oi
less indispensable article of diet. It
isn't. It is an article of luxury, and
absolutely nothing else. Wheat pos
sesses over oats, corn, and rice abso
lutely no nutritional quality for man
or beast. It is just one of the cereals
and there isn't the slightest evidence
that it is the best one."
"Our predilection for wheat is purely
a question of taste, comfort, and con
venience; it is absolutely nothing
else." Later in his speech he says:
"And because wheat is easier to pre
pare than oats and rice and barley—
that is the very best reason in the
world why we ought to accept the oats
and the rice and the barley arid to
Hive to them the wheat that is neces
sary to maintain a normal ralion."
He concludes by stating that the
American people must be worthy of
their trust, of our duty as an ally,
of the high esteem in which the people
of a war-torn country hold us. "The
people of France know that the Amer
ican people are being asked to un
dergo food conservation and they
know that the man who asks them to
undergo it is the man best qualilied
in the world to lay out a program—
the Hoover of northern France and
Helghim and now the Hoover of the
United States."
