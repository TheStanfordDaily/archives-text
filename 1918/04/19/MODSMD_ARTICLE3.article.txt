# Tinfoil, Hair Pins Will Fight Huns

### 
If you have any cold cream jars,
corks, castor beans, old clocks and
watches, hair combings, dental lilllngs,
or old gold and broken bits of jewelry,
and you band them over to the Stan
ford salvage committee of the Red
Cross, do you know that you can help
win the war?
It's strange what things will help
a nation to victory—old clothes, for
example—and it's bard to realize that
burlap and gunny sacks, old kid
gloves, and collapsible paste and paint
tubes, could go towards adding an
other wrinkle to Kaiser Bill's phy
siognomy. But that's so, and together
with any of the above mentioned, the
following would do the same work for
the United States and the Allies:
Tin or lead foil folded flat; do not
roll into balls.
Lead, brass, copper, and aluminium
waste.
Typewriter ribbon boxes and metal
spools therein.
Carbon paper boxes.
Waste rubber.
Old automobile tires and inner
tubes, bicycle tires.
Hooks, magazines, and newspapers.
These must be folded once only and
tied both ways with heavy string.
Clean white rags, mixed rags,
woollen rags (separated).
Bishop's graham wafer tins.
Glass fruit jars.
Bishop's petite wafer tins.
Men's shoes.
Bottles of all kinds —rinsed clean.
