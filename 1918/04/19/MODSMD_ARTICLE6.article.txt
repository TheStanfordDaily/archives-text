# COMPULSORY DRILL IS ORDERED BY COUNCIL
## 
### 
Beginning Monday, military train
j ing will be made compulsory for all
: undergraduate men in the Uni
j versity below the upper limits
I of the draft age, according to
action taken by the academic council
last night on recommendation of Pres
ident Wilbur. Exemptions will be
granted to those who come under the
conscientious objector clause of the
draft act and also to those men who
cannot take the minimum of six hours
'of drill on account of their present pro
gram. The arrangements Will be in
, the hands of a committee headed by
Professor J. P. Mitchell.
In speaking of the matter this
morning, I)r. Wilbur said: "Matters
have reached the point where all Uni
versity men should have training in a
reserve officers' corps in order to pro
tect themselves as well as the coun
try. Men with technical training,
backed with military training, will be
aided doubly. There are men from
Stanford packing guns in France at
the present time who are fitted by rea
son of their university education to
occupy better positions if they only
had the necessary military drill."
The resolution adopted by the coun

cil" follows: "All physically able un
dergraduate men students of Stanford
below the upper limit of the draft age,
except those belonging to religious or
ganizations and coming under the con
scientious objector clause of the draft
act, will be required to take a mini
mum of six hours a week of military
training for the duration of the war."
The act affects about 400 men or all
those below 31 years of age. Aca
demic credit will be given for the re
quired training, just as it has been for
the voluntary training,
i President Wilbur has appointed a
committee consisting of Professor J.
C. L. Fish, Professor M. R. Kirkwood,
I Captain S. M. Parker, U. S. A., retired,
I Dr. O. L. Elliott, and Professor Mitch
ell as chairman. This committee will
have entire charge of exemptions.
Captain Parker said this morning
that he is delighted with the move, as
it will give Stanford a unit of nearly
750 men. Work will commence next
week in instructing the new men in
the rudiments of drill.
Since military will be compulsory
for the duration of the war, Stanford
may have its quota of seniors that re-
ceive commissions increased above the
present number of ten, providing the
unit remains in the distinguished
class. This will provide an incentive
for harder work.
If it is necessary, the military in
struction staff will be increased to
handle the larger number of men.
There are about 780 men enrolled at
the present time.
For the new men as for the old, two
periods of drill are offered each to
complete six hours of work a week.
Morning drill comes Monday, Wednes
day, Thursday, and Friday from 11 to
1 12 and Saturday morning from 10 to
12. The afternoon section meets three
times a week, Tuesday, Thursday, and
Friday from 4 to 6.
Since the new orders have come out
from the War Department providing
for summer camps for men who are
in the advanced section of the R. O.
T. C.. a new incentive is offered upper
class men. Men who attend two of
these camps and are in the advanced
section will be allowed $9 a month as
commutation of rations by the War
Department. Final orders as to the
date and place of the camp for Stan
ford will be out in a few days.

In speaking of the matter this
morning, I)r. Wilbur said: "Matters
have reached the point where all Uni
versity men should have training in a
reserve officers' corps in order to pro
tect themselves as well as the coun
try. Men with technical training,
backed with military training, will be
aided doubly. There are men from
Stanford packing guns in France at
the present time who are fitted by rea
son of their university education to
occupy better positions if they only
had the necessary military drill."
The resolution adopted by the coun

cil" follows: "All physically able un
dergraduate men students of Stanford
below the upper limit of the draft age,
except those belonging to religious or
ganizations and coming under the con
scientious objector clause of the draft
act, will be required to take a mini
mum of six hours a week of military
training for the duration of the war."
The act affects about 400 men or all
those below 31 years of age. Aca
demic credit will be given for the re
quired training, just as it has been for
the voluntary training,
i President Wilbur has appointed a
committee consisting of Professor J.
C. L. Fish, Professor M. R. Kirkwood,
I Captain S. M. Parker, U. S. A., retired,
I Dr. O. L. Elliott, and Professor Mitch
ell as chairman. This committee will
have entire charge of exemptions.
Captain Parker said this morning
that he is delighted with the move, as
it will give Stanford a unit of nearly
750 men. Work will commence next
week in instructing the new men in
the rudiments of drill.
Since military will be compulsory
for the duration of the war, Stanford
may have its quota of seniors that re-
ceive commissions increased above the
present number of ten, providing the
unit remains in the distinguished
class. This will provide an incentive
for harder work.
If it is necessary, the military in
struction staff will be increased to
handle the larger number of men.
There are about 780 men enrolled at
the present time.
For the new men as for the old, two
periods of drill are offered each to
complete six hours of work a week.
Morning drill comes Monday, Wednes
day, Thursday, and Friday from 11 to
1 12 and Saturday morning from 10 to
12. The afternoon section meets three
times a week, Tuesday, Thursday, and
Friday from 4 to 6.
Since the new orders have come out
from the War Department providing
for summer camps for men who are
in the advanced section of the R. O.
T. C.. a new incentive is offered upper
class men. Men who attend two of
these camps and are in the advanced
section will be allowed $9 a month as
commutation of rations by the War
Department. Final orders as to the
date and place of the camp for Stan
ford will be out in a few days.
Beginning Monday, military train
j ing will be made compulsory for all
: undergraduate men in the Uni
j versity below the upper limits
I of the draft age, according to
action taken by the academic council
last night on recommendation of Pres
ident Wilbur. Exemptions will be
granted to those who come under the
conscientious objector clause of the
draft act and also to those men who
cannot take the minimum of six hours
'of drill on account of their present pro
gram. The arrangements Will be in
, the hands of a committee headed by
Professor J. P. Mitchell.
