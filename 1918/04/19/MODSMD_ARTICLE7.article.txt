# FORENSIC BATTLE TONIGHT
## 
### 
Debating comes into its own tonight
in the hig forensic classic of the year.
The universities of California and
Stanford speaking artists are to tangle
oratory and wits tonight in Harmon
gymnasium across the bay in the first
of the Joffre debates. The Joffre de
bates are a new acquisition to inter
collegiate debating and replace the old
Carnot medal contests. The name and
the inscription on the medal only
have been changed, instead of ex-
President Carnot's picture being en
graved on the face of the medal, the
visage of the hero of the Mame is
there.
Stanford is entering a strong team

and possibilities exist that the medal
will rest on one of the Cardinal speak
ers. J. G. Driscoll, '18, and M. L. Mc-
Clintock, '18, are both experienced
and able forensic artists, having de
bated for Stanford on intercollegiate,
Carnot, and other teams. It would
surprise no one to hear that Driscoll's
oratory or McClintock's logic had
brought the victory to the i'aKin. W.
F. Leiser, '21, will make his bow in
an intercollegiate role for the -first
time tonight, but Coach K. E. Leib,
gr., speaks highly of his ability.
J. J. Posner, '19, and William Green,
'19, on the Blue and Gold team, op
posed Stanford in the last intercol-
legiate debate and Posner especially
demonstrated that he is a speaker to
lie feared by his opponents. Miss Irene
Miller, *20, the other member of the
California team, is reputed to be a
speaker of rare ability and with a
good chance to win the medal.
The teams have been working on
"The Bureaucratic System in France"
for many weeks and are ready for the
specific question, which will be an
nounced two hours before the debate
tonight.
