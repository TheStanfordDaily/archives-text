# RED CROSS BENEFIT NETS $800
## 
### 
The entertainment given last night
in the Stanford Assembly Hall by the
Players' Club of San Francisco for the
benefit of the local Red Cross drew
an audience of about 1200 and will
probably, according to Mrs. J. C. Bran
ner, who was chairman of the ticket
committee, net $SOO to be used in
home service work.
The program, consisting of four
clever one-act plays, was different
from anything given at Stanford be
fore. It consisted of: "The Merry
Death," a unique harlequinade from
the Russian; "Big Kate," a play of
Katherine the Great, spectacularly
rich in setting; "The Price of Or
chids," a modern playlet, full of comic
sentimentality; and"The Rose of
Auvergne," one of the operettas that

made Offenbach so famous in his day.
This is the first time that the Play
ers' Club has appeared before a Stan
ford audience, though they have three
times been invited to perform in the
Greek Theater at the University of
California. Last summer they gave
there a double bill composed of the
Japanese tragedy, "Matsuo," and"The
Talisman," an original play written by
a former Stanford man, Raine Ben
nett.
The proceeds of last night will be
used in home service by the local Red
Cross, primarily for the comfort and
assistance of the wives and depend
ents of the soldiers. This organiza
tion is an auxiliary of volunteer work
ers who do individual work that can
not be done by the government.
