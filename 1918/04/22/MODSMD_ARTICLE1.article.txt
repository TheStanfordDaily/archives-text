## CALIFORNIA LOSES EVENT Contest Over Bureaucratic System Is Awarded to Stanford Debater 
### 
.1. G. Driscoll^'18, is the holder of
the first Joffre medal, as a result of
his victory Friday evening in the an
nual debate with California on "The
Bureaucratic System in France."
Driscoll is the first Stanford man to
win the medal for a number of years,
.J. F. Elden of Stanford having won
the Carnot medal in 1915.
The actual 'question for debate, as
announced exactly one hour and fifteen
minutes before the speakers took the
floor, was "Resolved, that the Prefect
of the Department should be elected
by delegates from the Municipal Coun
cil." This gave less time for the de
baters to prepare their arguments
than was anticipated, as it had been
announced that the subject would be
disclosed two hours beforehand.
The contestants were as follows:
Irene Miller, California, first affirm
ative. -
William Greene, California, first
negative.
J. G. Driscoll, Stanford, second af
firmative.
M. L. McClintock, Stanford, second
negative.
J. J. Posner, California, third af
firmative.
W. F. Leiser, Stanford, third nega
tive.
The speakers came forward to de
liver their first speeches in the order
named. The second .speech was in the
of a rebuttal. The vote was
taken on each speech.
Driscoll furnished a forceful de
bate, and demonstrated an exceptional
knowledge and grasp of his subject
both in the first speech and in the re
buttal. McClintock, the second Stan
ford speaker, was a close contestant
to his colleague for the honors, ac
cording to the popular verdict.
The judges for the occasion were
Messrs. Cloud, Cobb, the Assistant
Attorney General, and Milliard, a
prominent lawyer of San l 1 rancisco.
A large crowd was in attendance, as
the interest was stimulated by reason
of this being the first of the new ser
ies of debates under the name of the
popular French hero.
