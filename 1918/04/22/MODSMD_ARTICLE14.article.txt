# WANTON WASTE
## 
### 
Last Saturday's fire at the Kappa Alpha Theta house was one more ex
ample of the inexcusable, wanton waste that has been witnessed in this com
munity on numerous previous occasions. Once more a considerable loss of
property resulted from inadequate provision for such emergencies.
It seems strange that so enlightened a group of people as a college com
munity should be practically without lire protection, and should be content
to remain so. It is disagreeable to think what might happen under conditions
more favorable for a conflagration than those extant last Saturday. If such
a fire had started at night, and not been readily discovered, serious injury to
life and property might easily have resulted.
Stanford's fire equipment has been a traditional joke, but it has come to
be more a disgrace to the University to have an insignificant little cart that
comes tinkling up to the scene of action some time alter the fire is over.
When the fire at the Kappa Alpha Theta house was discovered, it could easily
have been extinguished with very little damage had there been proper facil
ities. But before any kind of assistance could be had, the blaze was well under
way, and a needless loss resulted.
Surely, while we are Hooverizing on other things, steps can be taken to
prevent similar occurrences in the future.
