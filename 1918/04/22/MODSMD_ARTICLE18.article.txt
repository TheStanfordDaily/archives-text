# WOMEN MAY NOW RIDE AFTER DARK
## 
### 
Stanford women may in the future
ride to and from Palo Alto and the
campus after sun-set in machines and
attend off-campus dances unchape
roned, according to a recent ruling
of Women's Conference. Unchape
roned machine riding at night is for
convenience and does not include any
riding on the highways.
Conference states that all rulings
will be vigorously enforced and the
breaking of such will be considered as
serious.
