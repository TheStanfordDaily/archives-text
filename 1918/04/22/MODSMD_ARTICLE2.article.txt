# California Takes Tennis Tourney
## Bent and Devlin Annex Only Win for Stanford—Cheney and Dunshee Star 
### 
By winning four out of live matches
California annexed the tennis tourna
ment. from Stanford's racket men on
the Berkeley courts last Friday and
thus wound up intercollegiate ath
letic competition between the two in
stitutions till the end of the war.
Stanford scored her only victory in
the last match of the day, which was
won by A. C. Devlin, '20, and Captain
W. ('. Bent, '19, against Miller and
Way. This combination displayed
brilliant tennis at times, bringing the
spectators to their feet, and from the
Cardinal viewpoint was the host match
of the day. Stanford won the first
set after a hard battle, but came back
stronger in the second set and won
handily.
D. N. Barry, '20, while defeated by
Dunsliee. the Blue and CSold captain
and star performer, made the Califor
nia man display everything he knew
about the game. The score in this
singles event indicated nothing of the
brand of tennis put up by the Cardinal
I player, for he pushed Dunshee to the
j limit.
t„ -nnnmi oi'urios match Devlin
displayed some clever tennis against
| his opponent, Cheney. The first set
! was bitterly fought for and it looked
■as if Devlin would win, but Cheney
'finally administered defeat in two
! straight sets, playing as he never did
before.
Perhaps the biggest disappointment
of the day to Cardinal tennis follow
ers was the defeat of Bent in the third
j singles match. Bent had an off day
! against Cook in the singles, but found
consolation by returning with the
i only California scalp in the doubles
| match with Devlin, his partner.
After the first singles match. Barry
; and C. W. Doolittle, '2ft, faced Dun
! sliee and Cheney, who had already
| one win each to their credit in singles,
! in the first doubles match of the tour
i nament. This time Dunshee's sensa
' tional smashing and terrific driving,
coupled with Cheney's steadiness,
proved 100 much for the racket wield
i ers representing the Cardinal.
The scores were as follows:
Dunshee (C.) defeated Barry (S.)
| 6—l, 6—3.
Cheney (C.) defeated Devlin (S.)
, o—4. 6—l.
Cook (C.) defeated Bent (S.) 6 —3,
: 7—5.
Dunshee and Cheney (C.) defeated
j Doolittle and Barry (S.) 6 —-1, 6 —2.
Devlin and Bent (S.) defeated Miller
land Way (C.) 6—4, 6—3.
