# California Takes Tennis Tourney
## Bent and Devlin Annex Only Win for Stanfordâ€”Cheney and Dunshee Star 
### 
By winning four out of live matches
California annexed the tennis tourna
ment. from Stanford's racket men on
the Berkeley courts last Friday and
thus wound up intercollegiate ath
letic competition between the two in
stitutions till the end of the war.
Stanford scored her only victory in
the last match of the day, which was
won by A. C. Devlin, '20, and Captain
W. ('. Bent, '19, against Miller and
Way. This combination displayed
brilliant tennis at times, bringing the
spectators to their feet, and from the
Cardinal viewpoint was the host match
of the day. Stanford won the first
set after a hard battle, but came back
stronger in the second set and won
handily.
