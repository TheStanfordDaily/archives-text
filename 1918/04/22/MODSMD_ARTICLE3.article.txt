# Thetas Rival Neighbors in Conflagration
## 
### 
| Blazing forth Saturday afternoon
j into smoky prominence, the Thetas
I threw a fire which collected the
J greater part of the male population of
the campus on the Theta third lloor
i and roof within five minutes of the
| time the first faint cloud of smoke ap
! peared, excited the undying jealousy
of the Alplia Phis and Pi Phis and
' gave the list of Theta tryoutees on
the Daily Palo Alto something to write
I about.
Campus opinion seems to be that it
i was a moderately successful fire, but
! not up to the standard set by the
| Alpha Phis in their conflagration last
j year. Comparatively few articles of
furniture were thrown out the third
floor windows, though it is said a type
! writer was so treated in order to give
I those below keys to the building. Sev
eral campus characters, however, won
lierosliips for themselves by the lordly
| manner in which they stood astride
the roof and threw buckets of water
on the rafters, jjnd each other.
The campus fire department ambled
up to the sound of the rattling of tin
about half an hour after the fire was
out, thus living up to Its previous
I reputation. It brought a broom with
it, however, which proved useful in
j sweeping up the mess on the third
j floor.
The Kappas are reported to be
[ slated for the next fire, and are said
j to be already laying plans to outdo
their rivals in the race for igneous
I supremacy.
