# Thetas Rival Neighbors in Conflagration
## 
### 
Blazing forth Saturday afternoon
into smoky prominence, the Thetas
threw a fire which collected the
greater part of the male population of
the campus on the Theta third floor
and roof within five minutes of the
| time the first faint cloud of smoke ap
peared, excited the undying jealousy
of the Alpha Phis and Pi Phis and
gave the list of Theta tryoutees on
the Daily Palo Alto something to write
about.
Campus opinion seems to be that it
was a moderately successful fire, but
not up to the standard set by the
Alpha Phis in their conflagration last
year. Comparatively few articles of
furniture were thrown out the third
floor windows, though it is said a type
writer was so treated in order to give
I those below keys to the building. Sev
eral campus characters, however, won
heroships for themselves by the lordly
manner in which they stood astride
the roof and threw buckets of water
on the rafters, and each other.
The campus fire department ambled
up to the sound of the rattling of tin
about half an hour after the fire was
out, thus living up to its previous
reputation. It brought a broom with
it, however, which proved useful in
sweeping up the mess on the third
floor.
The Kappas are reported to be
slated for the next fire, and are said
to be already laying plans to outdo
their rivals in the race for igneous
supremacy.
