### 
"We have talked a lot about money
in jjjis war, but now it is time to stop
talking and begin to act, for the me
dium of exchange in the world today
is the life-blood of the men and boys
who have gone out to fight for us,"
declared Dr. Wilbur in a stirring in
dictment of the lethargy of the Amer
ican people as he addressed the audi
ence in the Assembly Hall last even
ing in a great ylea for the unified sup
port of the war by the civil popula
tion.
Opening the Assembly Miss Katli
erine Jewell Everts spoke of the seri
ous food situation. Miss Everts read
an address given by Herbert Hoover
at the convention of hotel men called
to effect food conservation regulations
in which Mr. Hoover outlined the ex
act situation and explained why every
bit of the wheat supply of this coun
try should be sent abroad to the fight
ing forces and the civilian population

of the Allied countries. Mr. Hoover
stated that the world's supply of
bread stuffs is at its lowest ebb and
that at present the United States is
the only source of supply for wheat,
j Corn can not be shipped abroad for
| two months after April 1, for that is
j the germinating season and the corn
- will not keep. The work of food con
j serration must he done by the volun
tary effort of the intelligent well-to
! do people of this country who can
j easily get along with substitutes,
i while wheat is necessary for the
laboring population.
Miss Everts declared that the peo
ple of France, England, and Italy look
to America as the Messiah. In an
swer to the German challenge that the
United States civil population could
not he mobilized to back up the fight
ing forces Miss Everts said that Hoo
| ver declares that it can and will be
i done, and will be accomplished by the
voluntary service of the American peo
ple.
Miss Everts concluded her brilliant
address with the narration of several
dramatic incidents of the war zone.
She held the audience with her story
of King Albert of Belgium and the
pitiful Belgian children praying in the
streets of the ruined village.
In an address of telling vividness
Dr. Wilbur explained in detail the
war situation and challenged the in
difference of the American people to
the seriousness of the crisis which
they face.
"This is the critical year of the
war," declared Dr. Wilbur. "Our safety
depends on our backing up the people
of France and England until we can
gather together our fighting forces.
"What must the people over there
think of us? —of our empty promise
to send airplanes—of the indifference
of the Americans which tnade it neces
sary for them to cut their bread ra
tions one-third just at the height of
their great offensive?
"We are the greatest amateurs in
the world. We have been fooled by
the ingenious lies with which the Ger
mans have blinded us to the situation.
The department of justice tolls us
that there are over 200,000 German
agents in this country spreading pro
paganda. We must not listen to them
and if any criticism is made of the
efforts of our government let it be con
structive or not made at all.
"We must move faster. For a year
the United States watched the great.
Russian empire totter and crumble —
just from lack of food. We watched it
as a spetcator and did not offer to
lielp. The same thing has happened
in northern Italy and now in Finland.
But such a failure must not be al
lowed to occur in France or England
and only by sending food can we ex
pect them to continue fighting our
battles for us."
The 302 d Cavalry band from Camp
Fremont played several military se
lections and closed the assembly with
the "Star-Spangled Banner."
