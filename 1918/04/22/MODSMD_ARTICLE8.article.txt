# NEW RECRUITS DRILL TODAY
## 
### 
Registration for men taking mili
tary under the new rule of the aca
demic council will be closed at 4
o'clock this- afternoon, according to an
announcement by Captain Parker this
morning. The recruits are required
to report at 4:15 for drill under com
missioned aiul J -"i
cers.
Captain Parker expects to organize
two or three new companies with the
new men. Those who have had pre
vious experience will be attached to
one of the present companies, and will
probably receive chances at appoint
ments to the R. O. T. C. training
camps in June, if the existing rules
are changed in time.
The War Department requires that
the attendance at the camps be lim
ited to cadets who have received mil
itary instruction equivalent to the
basic course and one year of the ad
vanced course prescribed by War De
partment orders. However, Captain
Parker is of the opinion that the rule
is not a hard and fast one, and that
many of the men.in the Stanford unit
will be admitted.
The present rule for admittance to
the camps follows:

i Attendance at the camps will be
t limited to members of the advanced
I course, reserve officers' training corps
units; and such other selected mem
i
bers of senior divisions, reserve offi
| cors' training corps units, as have
lent to the basic course and one year
| of the advanced course prescribed by
l General Orders No. 49, War Depart
| ment, 191G.
All members of reserve officers'
training corps units, authorized to at
tend such camps, who have not al
ready done so, will be required in ad
vance to agree in writing in accord
ance with the requirements of para
| graph 4(i, General Orders No. 49, War
j Department, 1916, to attend such
camps; and also to accept at the op
! tion of the government such transpor-
I t ation as the government may provide,
or mileage at the rate of 3 1-2 cents
per mile at the colleges, schools or
homes to such camp as they may be
directed to attend, and mileage at the
irate of 3 1-2 cents per mile from such
camp after completion of course of
same to their home within the limits
112 of the United States.
