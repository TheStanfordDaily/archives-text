# WAR LECTURES TO HOLD SWAY EVERY THURSDAY MORNING
## FIRST TALK OF SERIES BY PROFESSOR TREAT Discussion of Situation On Western and Other Fronts Is Topic 
### 
To acquaint the members of the
University community with the mili
tary and economic problems which
face the United States a series of war
lectures lias been planned by the com
mittee on war information to lie given
weekly at the regular assembly hour
for the remainder of the spring quar
ter.
The first lecture of the series will
be given this Thursday by Professor
Payson .1. Treat at 11 o'clock, in the
Little Theater, who will speak on
"An Interpretation of the Situation on
the Western and Other Fronts." Pro
fessor Treat will discuss his subject
non-technically to bring out the broad
outline of the situation, and will ex
plain the German offensive to date.
Succeeding lectures of the series
will be given by authorities who are
specially qualified to discuss war top
ics, and will be planned to provide in
formation on such general subjects as
how the American government and
people and industry are meeting the
extra demands of war; the history,
course and issue of the war; the
parts played by the various nations
involved; and the actual conditions in
Europe.
Stanford's attitude in instituting
these weekly lectures as a means of
keeping abreast of the war conditions
is right in accord with governmental
wishes; publicity in the right way
and a proper education of the people
to the true state of affairs is regarded
in the eyes of the government as an
influential factor towards the winning
of the war and a direct means of
keeping the people at home contented
with affairs that look best when re
garded in their true light.
