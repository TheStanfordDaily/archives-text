# FRESHMAN STUDENTS TO LIVE IN HALLS DURING FIRST YEAR
## WILL ENFORCE RULING SAYS WILBUR Applies to Both Men and Womenâ€”Pledging May Continue 
### 
That the freshman dormitory rule,
requiring a year's residence in a dor
mitory, of all students entering Stan
ford and not residing at their own
homes, will be enforced next year in
the form in which it now stands, was
the information given out at the pres
ident's office yesterday afternoon.
There has been a general under
standing to the effect that the dormi
tory rule had been indefinitely sus
pended until after the war. Accord
ing to President Wilbur this under
standing is erroneous and has not
been given out by the University au
thorities.
In speaking of the rule yesterday,
he said: "No exigency has arisen
the possibility of which was not fore
seen at the time the ruling was made.
A reconsideration of the question has
not yet been made, nor is it likely to
be made -except for financial reasons.
At the preesnt time the suspension
of the rule would be to the detriment
of the finances of the University. Its
finances must be cared for first."
The dormitory rule applies to both
men and women freshman students
entering the University, except those
who may be able to live at their own
homes. It requires that all such stu
dents must live in one of the dormi
tories for the first year after entering
the University.
According to the present under
standing fraternities and sororities
may still pledge and initiate fresh
men. No regulation has been made
in regard to where they may eat and
it is understood that they may eat at
houses where they are pledges or
members, but must live in a dormi-
I tory.
