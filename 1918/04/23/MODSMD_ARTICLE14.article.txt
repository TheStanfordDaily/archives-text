After competitive tryouts, in which more real ability and willingness to
work have been displayed than for some time, The Daily Palo Alto announces
the addition of some new talent to its staff membership, as well as the reor
ganization of the former members.
L. J. Rehm finds his work so heavy this quarter that he is unable to keep
up the regular work attached to the position of news-editor. He will, bow
ever, continue to work on the Daily as far as his time permits in the capacity
of Associate News-Editor. At the same time the promotion of Miss Ruth
Lakin, '18, to the rank of full news-editor is announced. Miss Lakin has
served on the reportorial staff of the paper for three years and has been an
assistant news-editor during the past quarter.
It is a pleasure to welcome S. G. Whittelsey, *20, formerly a reporter on
The Daily Palo Alto, back to membership. Seven new reporters have earned
the right to membership. They are J. W. Bucklin, '20, A. I. Townsend, '21,
Miss Ellen Calhoun, '20, P. F. Erickson, '21, Miss Dorothy Jones, '19, Miss
Lote Park, '20, and Miss Ruth Elsinger, '20.
