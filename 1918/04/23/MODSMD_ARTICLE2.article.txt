# PROPELLER TESTS TO BE MADE FOR U.S.
## Aero-Dynamics Laboratory Will Be Used to Aid the Government 
### 
Experiments in aero-dynamics has
lately become of such importance in
the University that a larger and more
complete equipment was needed.
Some work was done last year at
Stanford in the old studio building,
but it was hindered by the lack of
equipment. The Board of Trustees re
cently appropriated $15,000 with
which equipment was to be pur
chased and a building to be erected
for the purpose of conducting ex
periments in aero-dynamics. The
aero-dynamics laboratory, which is
now being erected behind the Union,
will be a temporary structure, but
the equipment will be permanent in
nature. The laboratory becomes a
part of the University but will now
be used to carry on experiments for
the {United States government. In
the future it will be used as a research
laboratory.
The principal experimental work to
be done will be the testing of aero
plane propellers. The equipment will
include a wind tunnel about seven and
a half feet in diameter in which wind
velocities of 100 miles per hour will
he obtained. Some additional fea
tures may be added by which the ve
locity may be increased over a small
section to 200 miles per hour. Tests
are planned for propellers as large
as six feet in diameter.
Also, lift and drift tests will be
made of model aeroplanes. Investi
gations will he conducted to ascertain
the effect of low density atmosphere
corresponding to an elevation of 20,-
000 feet. The laboratory will be in
charge of Professor Lesley, and will
be readv for use in two months.
