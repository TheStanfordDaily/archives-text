# Dr. Porter To Speak at First Y.W.C.A. Meeting
## 
### 
Dr. Noel Porter, rector of San Jose
Trinity Church, will speak at the Y.
W. C. A. meeting tomorrow at 4:15, in
the Women's Club House. His topic
will be "Young Women in War
Times."
This will be the first meeting of the
spring quarter, and it is hoped that
the Stanford women will turn out to
hear Dr. Porter. He was one of the
speakers at the Y. W. C. A. intercol
legiate conference last winter.
