# "500" Icebergs to Look On at Import Dance
## 
### 
For once the traditional 500 women
enrolled in the University will find
themselves without their usual num
ber of representatives at the most
elaborate of terpsichoreap fetes, as
the committee calls the Import Dance
planned for the campus. As variety
is the spice of life, the members of
the committee conceived the idea that
500 women do not present a sufficient
ly broad field, although they admit it
is a sufficiently alluring one, from
which to select partners for the dance
of the year.
Definite plans have not yet been
made for the dance, although the date
has been set for May 4 and the place
is the Women's Cflub House, which the
members of the superior sex secured
under a new organization name. Men
who plan to attend are asked to com
municate with the Import Dance Com
mittee (ask any man on the campus
for their names) and announce their
intention of attending. A very nom
inal fee is being charged for admit
tance. The only other requirement
for attendance is that the female part
ner be an import (preferably good
looking).
The best talent in the musical and
jazz line has been obtained. To fur
ther distiguish the dance from other
affairs in the past, the food is to be
really worth while and the punch
more luscious than past pink confec
tions. •
"It is hoped," assert the committee,
"that the Import Dance will awaken
the women of the campus to the fact
that there are still a few men left
here out of the draft who demand a
certain amount of attention. Melting
the ice-bergs, as it were."
Result of the action of the com
mittee is already noticeable in the
Women's Conference's removal of the
ban on motor riding after dark.
