# DUKE KAHUAMOKU MAY SWIM HERE SOON
## 
### 
Every effort is being made by Coach
Ernest Brandsten to entice Duke
Kahuamoku, premier of aquatic stars,
to appear in the Stanford pool for
an exhibition in the near future.
If his time is not too limited, Coach
Brandsten is confident that the Duke
will come down for a day. He will
probably attempt to establish several
new records in the Encina pool, es
pecially in the dashes.
A picked squad of Stanford's best
mermen will oppose the Duke in a
relay event, if he can be secured.
This same stunt was used against
Norman Ross a year ago and it was
all that four of Stanford's best men
could do to beat him.
