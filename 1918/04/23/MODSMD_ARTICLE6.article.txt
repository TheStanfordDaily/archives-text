# STANFORD WOMEN TO CUT AND PACK FRUIT IN SUMMER
## TO LIVE IN HOMES AT UNIVERSITY Work To Begin July 1st and Continue Through July and August 
### 
It was made definite at a meeting
of the representatives from the vari
ous women's living groups yesterday
afternoon in the Little Theater, that
the work of the agricultural unit is
not to be picking fruit, which is much
too difficult lor inexperienced labor,
but cutting and packing, which is
much more appropriate. It was also
made clear that work will not begin
until .July 1 and that it will continue
through the months of July and Aug
ust only.
Living conditions were the subject
of much inquiry. The plan, as it now
stands, is that the women shall live
together in unoccupied fraternity
houses which will probably be do
nated for the purpose. If necessary,
however, camps and the equipment
will be arranged for.
The cost of board will be reduced
to the minimum. The eating hours
will be very early in the morning and
comparatively late in the evening.
Lunches will be used for the noon
meal. Eight hours will be the aver
age time per day to be spent in work.
But the possibility of added hours
should be anticipated.
In order to work in the agricultural
unit it will be necessary for each
woman to pass a physical
tion.
There is to be no Stanford women's
agricultural unit in southern Califor
nia authorized by the Women's War
Emergency. Committee. Reports of
such a unit are unfounded, accord
ing to the members of the committee.
The plan is for centralization of the
labor available front Stanford women
in the Santa Clara valley as near to
the University as possible.
Other minor details were explained
at the meeting. After consideration
it was dccided to postpone the col
lection of pledge cards to Thursday,
April 25.
