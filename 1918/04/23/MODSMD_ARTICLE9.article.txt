Plans for the laying of the '93 plate
are being made by Professor' F. M.
McFarland of the faculty, who is class
secretary. He is trying to get as
many of the old-timers as possible
to attend the ceremonies. Last year
'92 bad a few of its members present
and laid its plate; and because of the
natural rivalry of classes, '93 is en
deavoring to have a larger attendance
and thereby outdo '92.
Besides the plate-laying, there will
be other incentives for '93. Chief of
these is the fact that it is the twenty
fifth anniversary of the class.
