Eevo is a splend'd soft drink on
which to train. Completely satis
fies that extravagant thirst that
strenuous exercise is bound to
bring — satisfies it without any of
that after-feeling of fullness that
comes with water drinking.
You will find Bevo at inns, restau
rants, groceries, department and
drug stores, picnic grounds, base
ball parks, soda fountains, dining
cars and other places where re
freshing beverages are sold.
Guard against substitutes. Have
the bottle opened in front of you,
first seeing that the seal is un
broken and that the crown top
bears the fox. Sold in bottles only,
and bottled exclusively by
Anheuser-Busch—St. Louis

soft drink
