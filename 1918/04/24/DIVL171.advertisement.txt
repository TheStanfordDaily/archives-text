Have You Seen the New Gillettes
Specially Designed for the Fighting Man?
'T'HESE models were designed by members of the Gillette Organ
x ization who have seen service with the Colors and know what
the soldier is up against.
Hundreds of officers and men are buying them—the U. S. Service
Set in metal case, and the new Khaki-covered sets for Uncle Sam's
Soldiers and officers.
The Gillette is the one razor for the man who is doing things—
the one razor with world-wide use and reputation.
When a man wants new Blades he can get them at any Post Ex
change or Y. M. C. A. Hut—here in America or Overseas.
Our Paris Office carries stocks—is constantly supplying the
American Expeditionary Forces. Gillette Safety Razors arid Blades
on sale everywhere in France, England, Italy and the Eastern
battle fronts.

The Minute A
a Man Puts on a Uniform
The fighting man doesn't want to dawdle around. He wants to do a thing i - ight—and
get it over with. *
That's why the boys in the Service, the world over, are using the Gillette—the "once-over
razor.
The Gillette saves from five to ten minutes a
shave—llo strops or hones to clutter up the kit—
blades always sharp—always ready—No Strop
ping—No Honing.
The Gillette is the real service razor—loo%
efficient on any kind of beard or skin—under every
possible climatic condition, in any part of the
world—whether in hot or cold, or hard or soft
water.
It's a shaving tool that gives a velvet-smooth
shave in record time. Ten million men use nothing
but the Gillette.
The new U. S. Regulations say that every man
called to the Colors must have a razor—a razor
that will meet all the demands of a soldier's life.
Every man under the Colors needs a Gillette.
The mother, sister or friend of a boy in camp,
or a boy who's going into camp, couldn't possibly
make him a more useful or acceptable gift than a
Gillette Safety Razor.
