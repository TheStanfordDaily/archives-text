# FALLING BEHIND
## 
### 
The Stanford student body is asleep to live issues that are agitating the
rest ol' the wojTd! How fnuch, aside from oeeasional Red Cross work, the
Stanford women's relief unit, some "Hoovei'izing," and military drill, are we
in this University doing to help along the issues that will save the world
from the domination of the "war lord"?
Perhaps all are tired of hearing this question, so often reiterated. Per
haps we don't like to be reminded continually that there is a war in progress.
Well, perhaps, too, our men and allies over there are tired of living in the
trenches, and the women and children in Belgium are tired of starving. This
is no time to consider likes and dislikes.
Stanford is reluctant to admit herself behind her Berkeley rival in any
way, but California is now in the position to look back to see us coming, for
she has been up and doing in the Liberty Loan campaign, the Thrift Stamp
campaign, and other organized war work. Have we, on this campus, even
been working toward a goal?
But it isn't too late. Stant'ordites can yet do something. The Third
Liberty Loan drive is not closed, and it is not meant just for the rich man
and the great institutions. The aim of the United States is to have the whole
sum subscribed through small sums by individual Americans to show that
they are awake to the cause we are fighting for. College men and women
should realize before all others the wisdom and the necessity for backing the
government in this step. Let's wake up and do something!
