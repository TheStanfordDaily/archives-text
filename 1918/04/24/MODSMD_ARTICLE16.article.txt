Editor Daily Palo Alto:
In the interest of fairness and truth,
I wish to protest against statements
of the feature story and editorial in
the Daily Palo Alto of Monday, April
22.
The campus fire department did not
"amble up—about half an hour after j
the fire was out." I went to tlxe fire
from the engineering building with
Mr. Hewston. We started within one
minute after the alarm was sounded, \
and went as quickly as an automobile
could carry us. The chemical engine
and the hose cart were there when
we arrived.
A very moderate amount of water !
was used and it was entirely due to ,
Mr. Hewston that this was so. Fear- j
ing that the first chemical would not
be sufficient, he sent for another, !
which arrived after the fire had been i
put out.
It is doubtless true that the instal
lation of a fire alarm system, the plac
ing of extinguishers in all houses, and j
the employment of a paid fire depart-'
ment would decrease the fire hazard.
The fire protection is now such, how- j
ever, that the insurance rate is less
upon the campus than in Palo Alto.
I have no doubt that those responsi- j
hie for the fire protection would wel
come suggestions for improvement.
Those who offer criticism, however, |
should at least adhere to the facts, ;
and make their criticism constructive, j
E. P. LESLEY.

j Editor of the Daily Palo Alto:
My Dear Madam —Upon receipt of
I the Daily Palo Alto last evening, I
! noticed under a somewhat insulting
l headline the fact that the men upon
I the campus plan giving what they
i term an "Import Dance." First, let
| me protest against this vulgar title
' for a dance. So the men regard
women as something like wine and
cigars, something that can be import
ed or exported?
To say that 1 was surprised upon
reading of the intention of the
stronger sex to arrange for a dance of
the kind planned would be to over
state the facts. But I was really sur
prised to learn that you, as a repre
sentative of the other 499 women on
the campus, had permitted such an
article to appear in the columns that
you edit. Such an insult to the women
on the campus should hardly get by
I the keen surveillance of the news
j paper dignity the campus has out on
guard of its news columns.
Environment is responsible for ice
bergs, and they exist in the neighbor
hood of the north pole; likewise near
college men.
To add ansult to injury, the mascu
line divinities plan giving their dance
in the Women's Club House and then
want to deny the women of the cam
pus the privilege to attend it! Or
maybe they will permit us to rough
I it, and partake of their food as they
'do at all of our sorority dances. To
! compare the importation of men at a
j sorority dance to the importation of
I women at a men's dance is utterly ab
surd. We have not the alluring field
| to choose from as have the men.
I would also wish to go on record
j as slating authentically that the ac
j tion of the Women's Conference in
removing the ban on motor riding
after dark was not due to the threats
of the men's dance committee to bar
"icebergs." Show me the Import
Dance Committee if they dare expose
themselves.
In conclusion let me add that I con
sider myself plenty good enough and
plenty good looking enough to attend
any dance on the campus with any
man upon the campus. Besides, there
are no officers.
Believe me, indignantly yours,
ONE OF THE BEAUTIFUL
NEGLECTED 500.
