Form letters have been recently dis
| tributed in the community by the Y.
; M.-Y. W. C. A. war work fund com-
I mlttee to remind subscribers who
' have been delinquent since April
1 all pledged amounts to this cause
are past due.
Nearly $2,800 divided among 300
subscribers is the amount that is still
payable to the fund. Checks may be
sent to Professor R. L. Green, treas
urer, or to A. E. Worthy, 'ir>, secre
tary of the local Y. M. C. A.
Twelve thousand dollars lias been
subscribed by the Stanford commun
munity, and over $9,000 has already
j been received, which is in itself $3,000
; over the goal originally set for this
work by the committee. All that is
keeping the fund from going into the
national treasury is the present out
standing amount. When this is re
ceived the entire amount will be de
livered to the national treasury, where
it will be distributed to aid the un
fortunates in the prison camps and
those in the trenches and wherever Y.
M. C. A. work is needed.
Over 5,000 secretaries in Christian
work are devoting their entire time
to the cause now and news has been
received that there is room for four
thousand more.
The American people have given
liberally to the war work fund. Over
$.->0,000,000 has been subscribed to date
and turned into the national treas
ury.
