### 
Prospects are bright for the meet
ing of the Stanford Women's Relief
Unit to be held Thursday night in
the Union High School auditorium in
San Mateo, according to J. E. Mc-
Dowell. The Stanford alumnae met
last night to discuss plans for making
the meeting a large and enthusiastic
one. A committee was organized to
handle the money pledged tomorrow
evening and Miss Aida Gilchriste, '18,
Miss Louisette Aubert, '17, and a third
member from San Mateo were ap
pointed to work with Mrs.' Henry
Dana, a prominent social leader in
that community, who is arranging the
meeting tomorrow night.
Dr. Edward Krehbiel will be the
main speaker of the evening, assisted

by Miss Margaret Shedd, '20, and J.
E. McDowell, who will present the
financial plans of the unit. Miss Mar
garet Lathrup, instructor in the Eco
nomics department, will make a short
talk as a member of the unit.
Encouraging word has been re
ceived from Ceres asking for another
meeting next Friday evening. Miss
Jessie Wood, '17, telegraphed, saying
that $300 had been raised, and was
confident of $2000 as a total if a second
meeting could be arranged for. Mr.
McDowell intends to send a speaker
who will visit Modesto Saturday. Full
arrangements have not been com
pleted as yet, pending the return of
Miss Dorothy Egbert. '16, to the
campus.
