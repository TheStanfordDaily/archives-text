That the French will tight, not until
the last man, but until the last loaf of
bread, was the statement made last
night by Professor Gilbert Chinard in
the Little Theater.
"It's nil to America,"he said, "to
furnish the soldiers, who are entitled
to their full rations, with wheat. They
cannot eat more meat, for there is no
way to cook it in the trenches; they
must live 011 what they can carry with
them, and that is bread."
Professor Chinard* has recently re
turned from Paris, where lie spent a
year and a half in study of conditions.
He illustrated his talk with motion
pictures which he brought with him to
this country, showing the life in and
near Paris. These pictures were taken
last winter, and even then conditions
had become serious.

Throughout all of them can be seen
the abundance of soldiers on the
streets and in the shops. Women
have taken the men's places in the
munitions factories, and even 011 the
street car platforms.
"The people are starving themselves,
and before the war is over will starve
themselves still more, because they
are concentrating all their efforts in
the production of munitions. If they
were to stop this production long
enough to plant their fields, there
would be no shells with which to hold
back the Germans.
"ft is real war." he concluded, "and
the situation in France is serious.
Something must be done as soon as
possible, and America is the only one
to do that something."
