# TREAT EXPLAINS THE SITUATION IN EUROPE
## WILBUR BOOSTS LIBERTY BOND SALE Germans Hope To Divide Allied Armies in the Present Drive 
### 
"Germany's unrestricted submarine
warfare which she declared on Janu
ary 31, the entrance of the United
States into the war on April 6, 1917,
and the collapse of Russia in Decem
ber, are three important factors with
which this fifth campaigning season
of the war opened which were not
present in 1917," declared Professor
Payson J. Treat in a splendid inter
pretation of the situation on the west
ern and other fronts this morning in
the Assembly Hall. "Each of these
factors has a double phase of cer
tainty and uncertainty which must be
taken into consideration in judging
the outcome of the war."
Dr. Wilbur presided at the assem
bly and spoke briefly of the campaign
for the Third Liberty Loan, which
will be started on the campus tomor
row, and urged students to support
the government measure.
In speaking of Germany's attempt
to set her will on the Allies by un
restricted submarine warfare, Pro
fessor Treat declared that the out
come of the recent effort of the Allies
against the submarine base at Ostend
is one of the biggest uncertainties of
important consideration.
"Time is the factor which will tell
in the importance of the entry of the
United States into the war," he stated.
"The period which it will take this
country to send supplies of men and
munitions to help the Allies can only
be counted in terms of time.
"As a military factor Russia is out
of the war and cannot re-enter unless
hostilities are dragged on for a long
period. There are at present two un
certainties in regard to the Russian
situation which are vitally important
in the events of the next few months
of campaigning. These are first, the
ability of Germany to make use of the
resources made available to her in
Russia, and, second, the ability of
Russia to either allow or prevent Ger
many from using these sources of
supplies. It is quite probable that
whatever resources Germany can get
from Russia will not be available this
season. All these estimates are in
tertfis of uncertainty—time only can
answer.
"From a military point of view the
withdrawal of Russia simplified the
war problem. There is now no east
ern front. The war will be won on
th n western front.
"The objective of the Germans in
their big offensive was to smash
through the British lines on a fifty
mile front and thereby make a huge
gap between the British and French
forces. Amiens was only a minor ob
jective. There were two natural ad
vantages which aided the Germans at
the beginning of the offensive. First,
there was a period of unusually dry
weather, which afforded a hard ter
rain on which the heavy artillery
could be maneuvered. Then came a
series of foggy, misty mornings, on
which the Germans could mass their
forces In the front trenches and charge
the British without warning.
"After the first smash the offensive

narrowed down from a fifty-mile front
to a twenty-mile wedge. On this front
the Germans massed probably the
largest force of men and guns ever
gathered together in the history of any
war.
"There are two recent actions of the
allied governments which change the
outlook and should encourage the sit
uation. One supreme command has
been established over the Allies which
will enable them to use the resources
of the various countries to the best
advantage; and then the United
States has passed action permitting
the use of the American forces in de
tached groups to fill in the veteran
troops under French and British com
mand."
In concluding Professor Treat de
clared that the war will be decided
only on German soil and that only the
reserves and supplies from the United
States can carry that decision there.

the beginning of the offensive. First,
there was a period of unusually dry
weather, which afforded a hard ter
rain on which the heavy artillery
could be maneuvered. Then came a
series of foggy, misty mornings, on
which the Germans could mass their
forces In the front trenches and charge
the British without warning.
"After the first smash the offensive

narrowed down from a fifty-mile front
to a twenty-mile wedge. On this front
the Germans massed probably the
largest force of men and guns ever
gathered together in the history of any
war.
"There are two recent actions of the
allied governments which change the
outlook and should encourage the sit
uation. One supreme command has
been established over the Allies which
will enable them to use the resources
of the various countries to the best
advantage; and then the United
States has passed action permitting
the use of the American forces in de
tached groups to fill in the veteran
troops under French and British com
mand."
In concluding Professor Treat de
clared that the war will be decided
only on German soil and that only the
reserves and supplies from the United
States can carry that decision there.
"Germany's unrestricted submarine
warfare which she declared on Janu
ary 31, the entrance of the United
States into the war on April 6, 1917,
and the collapse of Russia in Decem
ber, are three important factors with
which this fifth campaigning season
of the war opened which were not
present in 1917," declared Professor
Payson J. Treat in a splendid inter
pretation of the situation on the west
ern and other fronts this morning in
the Assembly Hall. "Each of these
factors has a double phase of cer
tainty and uncertainty which must be
taken into consideration in judging
the outcome of the war."
Dr. Wilbur presided at the assem
bly and spoke briefly of the campaign
for the Third Liberty Loan, which
will be started on the campus tomor
row, and urged students to support
the government measure.
In speaking of Germany's attempt
to set her will on the Allies by un
restricted submarine warfare, Pro
fessor Treat declared that the out
come of the recent effort of the Allies
against the submarine base at Ostend
is one of the biggest uncertainties of
important consideration.
"Time is the factor which will tell
in the importance of the entry of the
United States into the war," he stated.
"The period which it will take this
country to send supplies of men and
munitions to help the Allies can only
be counted in terms of time.
"As a military factor Russia is out
of the war and cannot re-enter unless
hostilities are dragged on for a long
period. There are at present two un
certainties in regard to the Russian
situation which are vitally important
in the events of the next few months
of campaigning. These are first, the
ability of Germany to make use of the
resources made available to her in
Russia, and, second, the ability of
Russia to either allow or prevent Ger
many from using these sources of
supplies. It is quite probable that
whatever resources Germany can get
from Russia will not be available this
season. All these estimates are in
tertfis of uncertainty—time only can
answer.
"From a military point of view the
withdrawal of Russia simplified the
war problem. There is now no east
ern front. The war will be won on
th n western front.
"The objective of the Germans in
their big offensive was to smash
through the British lines on a fifty
mile front and thereby make a huge
gap between the British and French
forces. Amiens was only a minor ob
jective. There were two natural ad
vantages which aided the Germans at
