# Students Should Get on Job Says President Wilbur
## 
### 
"Get behind the Stanford Liberty
Loan Committee and support it as
you support your government. This
war must be paid for out of the sav
ings of the country and better out of
the future savings, for that way a
double service is done the nation â€”
the war is paid for and there is no
demand made on the resources of the
country by needless expenditure."
This was President Wilbur's last ad
dress to the University before leav
ing for Washington tomorrow, spoken
at assembly this morning.
Students Cnn Buy
"Liberty bonds are something that
almost everyone in the University can
buy. There is Red Cross work to do
and food conservation that is vital,
but the war must be paid for and paid
for now, and the way to do that is
to buy Liberty bonds. Stanford hasn't
done as well as other universities in
this support of the Liberty loan and
it is up to us to begin now."
With these words as a sendoff, the
committee in charge of the third Lib
erty loan on the campus is planning
a whirlwind campaign to sell the
bonds, beginning tomorrow and con
tinuing for a week. The committee
appointed to take charge of the loan
consists of Professor M. S. Wildman.
Professor W. A. Cooper, Miss Thur
lyne Buffum, '18, Miss Ellen Calhoun.
'20, Miss Dorothy Priscoll, '20, and
W. I. Ames, *18. At a meeting held
this noon the committee perfected the
organization to be used in the sale
of our national security insurance on
the Stanford campus.
Students To Talk
Student speakers will be sent out
tonight at the dinner hour to each liv
ing group on the Row, and to Encina
and Roble halls. The names of these
speakers have not yet been an
nounced, but they will be on hand pro
j vided with information and able to
make convincing talks, say members
of the committee. It is expected that
in many cases living groups will pur
chase bonds in their own names, as
well as individual purchasers.
Beginning tomorrow, bonds will be
on sale on the Quad, at the Engineer
ing corner. Professor Cooper will
have charge of this phase of the cam
paign. Full information regarding the
bonds and the progress of the cam
paign will be printed in the columns
of the Daily Palo Alto. Information
in regard to the character and ad
vantages of the bonds and the condi
tions of their sale can also be ob
tained at the registrar's office from
Assistant Registrar McDowell. Pro
fessor Wildman, head of the commit
tee, will be ready to give advice to
prospective purchasers.
Previous Bequests Met
The present campaign was started
with the idea that Stanford should do
its part and a little more in this, as in
everything else. Previous requests
for money and aid have met a most
generous response on the Farm, and
in a' case such as the Third Liberty
Loan campaign, when patriotism is
combined with protection and even a
good business investment, those In
charge of the movement feel that
Stanford people should buy bonds to
the very limit.
The exact quota for Stanford Uni
versity has not yet been determined,
but the committee feels that it would
be unwise to limit itself to any par
ticular amount, and prefers to attempt
to sell all the bonds possible in the
time marked out for the campaign,
without, setting any particular goal at
which to stop.
An organized movement to sell Lib
erty bonds has been agitated on the
campus for some time, but this is the
first definite step in the actual cam
paign here. It is hoped to do as well
as at the University of California,
where thousands of dollars worth of
bonds have been sold on the univer
sity campus.
