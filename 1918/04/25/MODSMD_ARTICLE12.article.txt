Stanford's chance to go "over the top" in the Third Liberty Loan cam
paign will lie tomorrow, on Liberty Day. President Wilson has set Friday
aside as a holiday for business men all over the country, thereby indicating
the extreme importance of the issue in hand. As Dr. Wilbur said, "The war
must be paid for out of the earnings of the country. Why not pay now"?
It is true that the financial status of the majority of college students is
not as golden as they might wish, but there are few of them who cannot do
something. The day laborer saves his earnings until lie is able to purchase
a bond, and thus in addition to helping the government in time of need, puts
aside something for the future. In most cases the university man and woman
is better off than the laborer. College people should be broader by reason of
their better education, and therfore be able to realize the need. If they pos
sess the means and the realization of the aim toward which the government is
working, there should not be lacking the spirit to mak£ them support it. It
has never been said that Stanford is lacking in spirit.
Other universities throughout the country have responded willingly to
the government call for funds. Reports from the Ohio State University show
that a drive waged on that campus resulted in the subscription of $52,600 to
the Liberty Bonds. Such a recor v d is one of which to be proud. Though Stan
ford is a small institution, and its time to act in this issue is short, it too, can
acquit itself commendably. Each student in the University is urged to shoulder
his share in the burden of the war. Make Liberty Day tomorrow one of which
Stanford may well be proud. Subscribe to the Liberty Loan!
