The Daily Palo Alto wishes to announce that the articles appearing in its
issues regarding the Are Saturday, and the fire department, were not intended
as personal insults to those in charge or as aspersions upon the good work
of those who put out the fire. If they were so construed, we are sorry. The
intention was merely to point out the fact that such fire equipment as is pro
vided for this community is felt by many to be inadequate. If such contention
is wrong, we welcome enlightenment on the subject.
