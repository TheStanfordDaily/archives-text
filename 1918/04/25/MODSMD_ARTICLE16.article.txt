# DELTA CHI HOSTS AT JOLLY BARBECUE
## 
### 
A full-fledged barbecue was held j
yesterday afternoon and evening. I
when the Phi Delta Phi and the Phi j
Alpha Delta honorary law fraterni- j
ties were hosts to the upper-class '
Delta Chi law students. It was an J
annual affair.
Hostilities took place beyond the [
rolling foothills to the west of the
campus. The motive of the occasion
was to afford opportunity for a gala
get-together.
After the beef dinner, some twenty
odd fellows joined in a rollicking
chorus, -singing the latest fantasies of
the day, before turning their faces
toward the campus.
