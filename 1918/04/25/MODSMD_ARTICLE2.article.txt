# 1919 Quad Will Introduce Many New Innovations
## 
### 
A "War Quad" that is different in
nearly every respect from former an
nuals is what the 1919 Quad board
promises as a result of its work.
This book will blossom forth next
month with 320 pages of original ma
terial, that will include a large num
ber of illustrations. The war theme
will be carried out in full so as to
make this publication a lasting me
mento of this turbulent year in Stan
ford's history.
The title page of the 1919 Quad will
appear as an original photo instead
of the usual pen and ink drawing,
and the cover will also be different.
Page borders on every page in the
form of an appropriate Stanford de
sign will add to the originality of the
annual. The administration depart
ment will be featured by an article
by President Ray Lyman Wilbur on
"Stanford's Place in the War." The
dedication of the annual will be mil
itary.
In the coming Quad the senior rec
ords will occupy six pages instead of
the usual eight to ten, and there will
be a six-page section of "Stanford
Men in the Service." The effect of
the great world war will be notice
able in the fact that fifty names in
stead of the usual ten or twelve will
appear on the"In Memoriam" page.
In the military section a record of the
Stanford R. O. T. C. and pictures and
history of 'Ihe first, second, and third
ambulance units will be featured.
Four full-page colored paintings by j
Pedro J. Lemos, curator of the Uni
versity Museum and Art Gallery, will
add an artistic touch to the year-book.
With numerous pictures and snappy
articles, the athletic section of the j
Quad will have a special significance
in that it will be the last of such sec
tions until after the war, owing to the
suspension of intercollegiate athletic
activities. A josh section of twenty
pages, containing six pages of snap- ;
shots with their characteristic ex
posures and razzes, as well as a I
"History of the Year" in cartoons, by j
W. E. Antrim, '19, will be a feature |
of the book.
Though somewhat smaller than pre
war Quads, the 1919 year-book will
display a great deal of originality. The j
staff has worked hard to make the I
publication a success. It will be on
sale on the Quad in the latter part of
May, selling for the price of $3.50.
Orders can now be placed at the Stan
ford Bookstore.
