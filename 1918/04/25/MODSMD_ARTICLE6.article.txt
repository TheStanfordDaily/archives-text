### 
That President Wilbur is decidedly
behind the women's agricultural unit
has been indicated by the fact that he
has authorized the sending ot' a letter
showing the stand of the University
to the parents of every Stanford
woman student. The letter, which
briefly outlines the plan for the unit
and brings out its relation to the na
tional need for food production, fol
lows:
"To the Parents of Stanford Women
Students:
"Under the Woman's Land Army of
America, a committee of Stanford
women students is organizing units to
meet the labor shortage in the or
chards of Santa Clara valley during
July and August, 1918.
"The work offered to college women
is the cutting and drying of fruit, â€”
outdoor work which has been proved
not only possible but healthful work
for women.
"Each Stanford girl, before being
accepted for a unit, must pass a phy
sical examination at the University,
which will determine her fitness for
work of the kind proposed.
"The housing and supervision of
each unit to be sent out must meet
the requirements of the Woman's
Land Army and must have the ap
proval of the University authorities,
who will see that the girls are ade
quately housed in camps or houses
with an older woman to act as sup
ervisor and manager. Miss Harriet
Bradford, dean of women, will have
immediate charge of the organization
and the supervision of this housing.
"Food production is the nation's
imperative need. Your daughter has
been asked to help fill this need by
devoting a part of her summer to
work in the orchards of the Santa
Clara valley. The University wishes
you to know that it heartily endorses
the project and asks your cooperation
