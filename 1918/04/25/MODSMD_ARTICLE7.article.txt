# LIBERTY DAY DECREED FOR FRIDAY
## DRIVE FOR LOAN WILL RECEIVE BIG IMPETUS Tomorrow to Be National Holiday to Sell Bonds 
### 
Tomorrow has been set aside by
President Wilson as Liberty Day.
Stores and business bouses through
out the country will suspend business
in the afternoon to allow their em
ployes to participate in patriotic
demonstrations for the third Liberty
Loan. Booths will be set up in many
cities to expedite the sale of these
bonds, and it is expected that many
quotas will be oversubscribed.
lfnnds For Sale (hi Campus
Liberty Bonds will be offered for
sale on the campus tomorrow. They
are issued in even denominations
from $50 to $100,000, at par with any
accrued interest added, according to a
Treasury Department circular issued
this month. They may be purchased
on the insallment plan, but 5 per cent
of the amount subscribed must ac
company the application. The next
installment of 20 per cent is due on
May 28. No payment is required in
June, on account of taxes which are
due that month. The last two in
stallments of 35 and 40 per cent are
due on July 18 and August 15.
The full amount may be paid with
the application, or at any time. But if
the installment plan is selected, the
bonds are liable to forfeit if the pay
ments are not made on the dates set.
The government agrees to deliver the
bonds as promptly as possible upon
completion of the payments.
Interest Paid To Holders
Interest is paid to the holders at
the rate of 4% per cent from May 9,
and is computed semi-annually. The
obligations fall due on September 15,
1928, but the Secretary of the Treas
ury is allowed to purchase one-twen
tieth of the amount outstanding each
year, until one year after the end of
the war. This does not mean, how
ever, that bonds are subject to call
for redemption before maturity.
