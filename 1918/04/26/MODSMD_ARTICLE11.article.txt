# KREHBIEL SPEAKS IN SAN MATEO
## 
### 
Dr. Edward H. Krehbiel spoke in
San Mateo last night at Hie Union
High School auditorium on the Stan
ford women's relief unit and its con
nection with the recent drive and
present military situation on the
western front. Miss Margaret Shedd.
'20, explained the organization of the
unit and the kind of civilian relief it
would do. Miss Margaret Lothrop,
who graduated from Smith College.

told of the work which that unit had
accomplished in France. Miss Dor
othey Egbert. '16, and J. M McDowell
outlined the financial side of the Stan
ford unit and appealed for the sup
port of the Red Cross in this partic
ular line.
"The biggest loss of the last terrific
drive of the German armies," said
Dr. Krehbiel, "was not the loss of ac
tual territory, for most of that had
been devastated previously, but the
great danger lies in injury to the
morale of the people. The one hope
for winning this war is in strengthen
ing the morale of the French people,
that they may hold the lines until we
can throw our men in. Our people
must furnish this new strength and it
is for this that the Stanford women's
relief unit is to be sent to France."
No pledges were taken up at the
meeting but a Stanford committee
composed of twenty-live alumnae of
Sau .Mateo and Burlingame was form
ed, which will work all next week in
collecting pledges and actual money
for the unit.
