### 
A report has just been received at
Stanford of the sale of the last of the
Stanford land holdings in Butte comi
ty. involving a deal of 11,000 acres and
almost a half million dollars.
The land, which was sold to a group
of separate purchasers, is located be
tween that sold to the state for the
state colonization tract and the town
of Nelson. William G. Stimmel rep
resented the trustees of the Univer
sity in the matter. It is stated that
the aggregate purchase price was well
over $100,000.
All of the divisions of the tract sold

were large ones, ranging from 1,650
acres to 7,000 acres. Michael Keenan,
a Butte county sheep raiser, was the
largest purchaser.
This deal is of particular sig
nificance as an evidence that the
adobe land in that part of the state
is again becoming productive for the
purpose of raising wheat. All of the
land will be plowed and planted in
wheat. It has been idle for many
years, but with the deeper plowing
methods made possible by the use ot
tractors, it is stated that the adobe
has again conje to its own.
