Under this heading the Daily Palo Alto will print during the remainder
of the quarter contributions of a more or less humorous nature written by
members of the staff who are able to "make the col-yum."
To stimulate interest three cash prizes will be given by IT. N. Hoffman,
instructor in journalism, the award to be announced in the final issue of the
quarter. For the best contribution printed $5 will be paid; for the second
best, $3, and for the third best, $2. The judges will be Mr. Hoffman, the
editor, and the managing editor of the paper, who will also pass upon con
tributions submitted. Only staff members may contribute, although there
will be no objection if their friends can supply them with material.
Cleverness, originality, and entertainment will be the aim for matter that
is to appear in this "col-yum." Almost necessarily, it will be fashioned alter
some of the more notable humorous "col-yums" of metropolitan newspapers,
but naturally the readers of this paper will hardly expect us to furnish such
features as have made 13. L. T„ K. C. 13., Don Marquis, and other "col-yumists"
famous.
Brevity will be the rule —aside from that there will be no restrictions as
to the form or character of material. Quips, pungent paragraphs, funny typo
graphical errors, clever puns, little personal sketches, foibles and follies of
college life, human interest stories, humorous poems, and every form of spice
that is entertaining and "fit to print" may win a place. In these tragic times
evervbody needs a bit of sweetmeat to chew daily.
