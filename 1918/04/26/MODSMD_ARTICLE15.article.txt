Dear Editress of the Daily Palo Alto:
In reply to the letter of one of the
beautiful (?) neglected(!) 4G4, I, one
of the 750 North Poles, desire to reply
to the several insults and injuries con
tained therein. In the first place, the
title Import Dance is entirely justified
—it is a well-known fact that the most
luscious of wines and liquors are im
ported; and besides, they have pret
tier labels, otherwise known as faces.
We are glad tt> see that you admit
the definition of iceberg, and also the
partial environment of north poles,
but don't forget a few rays of the
Aurora Borealis that shoot around oc
casionally—and are so much sought
after.
We wish to say that the dance is
properly staged at the Women's Club
House in acknowledgment of the
warmer mural decorations; cold ce
ment was all right for a campus dance,
except that it was hard to distinguish
it from the co-eds.
Yes, we admit that the men have a
more alluring field to choose from
than the women; it takes a little
something for a man to make a fool
of himself.
On rereading your last paragraph, I
am forced to conclude that you must
hate yourself. However, I may mod
estly add that I think I am handsome
enough, good looking enough, and
have darn near enough money to take
twenty-five co-eds to a dance on the
campus, or even a real one.
We are sorry we cannot disclose
the names of the Import Danes Com
mittee, but the number of female
phone calls purporting to be from off
the campus have already become bor
ing.
In conclusion let me add that I care
not what others may do, but as for
me, give me an Import or give me
J death.

I ONE OF THE NORTH POLES.
