# Stanford Unit to Receive Pledges
## Representatives in the Living Groups Will Collect Funds by Monday 
### 
In view of the organization of the
Stanford women's unit for relief work
in France and the necessity for rais
ings funds for its support immediately
it has been deemed expedient by the
French reconstruction committee,
with the advice of Mrs. O. Elliott,
chairman of the Stanford-Palo Alto
committee, to transfer the monthly
pledges which havo been contributed
by Stanford women through the me
dium of the California state commit
tee for relief in France and Belgium
to the support of the Stanford unit.
The work which the unit will engage
in is the same form of relief that
the workers of the state committee
have been doing; hence the only
change effected by this diversion of
the funds is in the medium through
which the pledges reach the devas
tated districts.
Since the organization of the French
reconstruction committee last Novem
ber Stanford women have contributed
nearly $f>oo to the work of relief in
France and Belgium. This money has
been applied to the various forms of
relief among the refugee children, to
(lie Antwerp Ouvoir and milk fund,
orphanages, the Sou du Mutile (for
mutilated soldiers) and for immediate
relief among the village refugees. Ite
eently, because of renewed activity
in northern France, the workers have
been occupied with caring for the
refugee children of whom there are
great numbers in Paris at present.
Monthly pledges average about $50
and hereafter will lie applied to the
unit funds and devoted to the work
of the local representatives when they
reach France. It is hoped that greater
interest will be evidenced in the ac
tivities of French relief now that
Stanford women will have control of
the disbursement of the funds.
To facilitate the collections of the
pledges representatives have been ap
pointed in each living group on the
campus to make collection. The com
mittee urges that the April contribu
tions be paid immediately and turned
in by Monday to Miss Eleanor Eppich
at Iloble Hall.
