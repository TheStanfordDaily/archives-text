# Encina Club Flies Flag Containing 370 Stars
## 
### 
After weeks of anticipation the En
cina Club service flag is at last flying
from a large white flagpole in front
of the hall. Laborers have been busy
for some time erecting two poles in
front of the hall, one for the service
banner, the other for an American
flag. The service flag containing about
370 stars, was raised for the first time
Tuesday. Except for the service ban
ner of the University, this flag con
tains the most stars of any similar
flag on the campus.
