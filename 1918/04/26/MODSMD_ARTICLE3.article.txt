# Bawl-Out Appears and Exposes Plans For Daring Plot

She was a wee freshman girl, and
she looked at the list, of student names
posted up on the bulletin board at the
registrar's office. That night she had
a fearful dream; she dreamed that —
Two Crooks decided to steal the
Stamp, the Cash, and the three Bills
that they knew Stanford University
had. For two Weeks they planned,
and finally decided just Watt they
were to do.
They took a Carr from Palo Alto,
but the Carr was too slow, and they
realized it would be more Wise to
change to a Ford. The Ford ran Well,
and it wasn't long before they ar
rived at a group of buildings which
they knew to be the University—ten
large Halls, and one Shedd, connected
by four winding Rhodes.
One of the Crooks jumped out of the
Ford, lie was a Brewer and owned
two Barrs, but the other man got out
more slowly, for he was a Baker,
noted for loafing around, and was
called Mr. Doolittle. To reaili the
Hall in which the treasures were kept
they had to pass closely by the Sliedd,
where the University had its menag
erie—a Hare, a Wolf, a Beaver, a for
eign Bird, a Henn, four Crowes, a Par
rott, and a Fish. The noise which they
made caused the Parrott to think they
were Hunters, and it flapped its Wing
and began to Crowe.
A Goodman passing by heard the
noise and ran to see Watt the matter
was. When he saw the two desper
ate villains he flung out his Hand and
gave the first one some hard Knox.
The second man, realizing he could
Doolittle, died.
.Just then a Keen Little co-ed turned
the corner of the sfiedd. "Ah, you are
a Likely man!" she said. "You did
Well, and you may have my Hart."
The Goodman, not wishing to Sey
mour of the dying Crooks, turned to
her and said: "How Sweet and Dar
ling you are! Now, after this, I will
be a Rich man. Let us hunt for a
Parson."
