# R.0.T.C. RECRUITS WILL BE EQUIPPED IN FEW MORE DAYS
## 
### 
Military recruits will receive their
uniforms shortly and will bo furnished
with all necessary equipment as soon
as possible, it was announced yester
day. Articles needed by the cadets
v. ill si(ii, be on sale at cost price in
the armory, and the new men are
asked to obtain their insignia and
texts as soon as they arrive.
A new feature in military training
at Stanford is to be introduced next
week. Miniature trench making and
work of a similar nature will be dem
onstrated on sand tables for the pur
pose ol' giving the cadets a practical
knowledge of modem warfare. A call
was made at drill yesterday for vol
unteers for an engineering company,
and no doubt the R. O. T. C. will soon
possess an engineering unit in addi
tion to its infantry regiment.
A much-needed military band has
at last made its appearance in the It.
O. T. C. here, and the cadets will soon
parade to the sound of martial music
instead of the present one-two-three
four step of the officers.
Although the complete number of
pieces has not as yet been obtained,
the band has at present twenty instru
ments. Baritones, clarinets, and cor
nets are still needed, and students in
terested in a military band are asked
to hand their names to Leader P. S.
Carter, '18. as soon as possible. The
hours of practice are from 5 to 6 in
the afternoon of each drill day.
