# WILBUR EXPRESSES PRIDE IN STANFORD'S WAR WORK
## 
### 
"Stanford can be proud of its record
so far in the war, but our work has
just begun. Students, alumni, fac
ulty, and trustees are a unit in the
desire to render maximum service.
Above all, we must keep the Uni
versity intact and busy in the prepara
tion of men and women with the high
grade training our country now needs
and will need even more in the
future.
"Our various activities can and
should be kept on a war plane. We
must back up the western front to
day and prepare to break through it
in the days to come. It will require
the fullest effort of every American,
and above all, it will require trained
minds by the thousands. Here lies
our opportunity and our privilege.
We can serve by the way we live and
prepare for the stern duties ahead.
"May I in saying a temporary 'good
bye' express my pride and confidence
in the fine and willing spirit of this
generation of Stanford men and
women."
RAY LYMAN WILBUR,
President.
Leaves Today
Before leaving for Washington this
afternoon to resume his work with
Herbert Hoover and the food admin
istration, Dr. Wilbur prepared the
above farewell statement to the Stan

ford men and women. In it he ex
presses liis confidence in the faculty,
alumni, and student body to do their
duty .as they have been doing, and
work as a unit.
Before he returns to Washington
Dr. Wilbur will take the speaking plat
form in Idaho and Washington in the
interests of the food administration,
lie has recently concluded a success
ful speaking lour which took him to
twenty different states. During this
campaign lie visited the different state
food administrations and helped 111
their organization and work.
Organized Women Workers
Before Congress passed the food
control act, during the months when
the food administration work was car
lied on largely by Mr. Hoover and a
small group of associates at the re
ciuest of President Wilson, Dr. Wilbur
built up the volunteer organization of
women throughout the nation. This
body of women was the first organ
ized body of food administration work
ers and still furnishes the backbone of
Hie administration's volunteer food
saving effort.
Wilbur an Kffeetive Speaker
Dr. Wilbur has been connected with
the food administration since its or
ganization and is known as one of the
most effective speakers working for
the administration. He has gained
considerable influence from his speak
ing campaigns because of his thor
ough knowledge of conservation and
the work of the administration. By
reason of his residence in Germany
and England during the days when
he was studying medicine, Dr. Wilbur
has gained first-hand information of
conditions and customs in Europe,
which enables him to speak intimately
of the international situation as re
lated to the food problem in the
United States.
When he arrives in Washington, Dr.
Wilbur will again work with Mr.
Hoover in a general capacity. He will
endeavor to return to Stanford in time
for commencement.
