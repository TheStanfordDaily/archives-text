In wartime it is necessary that some Stanford traditions be suspended
for the sake of conservation. There are some customs, however, which Stan
ford students have observed for many years which need not be conserved.
The one in mind now is the singing of "Hail, Stanford, Hail!" at the close of
a University assembly. The manner of singing has been criticized for some
time. Little spirit and enthusiasm has been put into the song, but even such
an effort is better than the situation that arose in assembly -this morning,
when no song was suns, when only an awkward pause followed the conclus
ion of the speech. No one was quite sure what to do.
It is difficult to place the blame for such a situation, but in the absence
of a leader there should be some one willing to assume the responsibility for
starting the song. There should be some fitting conclusion to a patriotic
assembly such as was held this morning, and the absence of it was particu
larly noticeable.
Our visitors' opinion of the student body might not be flattering for the
lack of courtesy that is sometimes shown the speaker when students leave in
the middle of a speech, or when they turn and bolt for the door at the con
clusion without waiting for the "Hail, Stanford, Hail!"
While we are on the subject, might it not be well for the student body to
show some patriotism in the singing of national songs at patriotic assemblies?
