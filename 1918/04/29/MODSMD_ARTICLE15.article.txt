In response to a communication
from H. W. Maloney, division athletic
director at Camp Fremont, the Daily
Palo Alto desires to correct, an error
which appeared in the issue of April
22, relative to the track and field meet
held with Camp Fremont on April 20.
The official score of the meet was:
Stanford 54, Fremont (58; and the re
lay event between the members of the
Stanford R. O. T. C. and the men of
Fremont took place and was won by
the Stanford runners. The meet, as
Mr. Maloney points out, was not an
informal affair, having been arranged
for and scheduled some weeks ago.
