touring the northwest and speaking
on the "Menace of Absolutism." In

the subject proved so popular that
Dr. Jordan was forced to give ten
more speeches than he had planned
for. Everywhere Dr. Jordan was wel
comed by good audiences, in instances
the crowd proving unusually large. An
especially fine reception was ac
corded the speaker at the University
â€¢of Idaho, where Dr. Jordan held a
very enthusiastic meeting.
Among the places visited were Se
at He. Tacoma, Everett. Bellingliam,
Spokane, Cheney. Pulman, Moscow
(the University of Idaho), Portland,
;nid Corvallis.

among the most, successful of all the
talks that Dr. Jordan has given, but
owing to the fact that he was forced
to return to the campus to take up
work requiring his presence here, lie
was unable to speak at any of the
other places where lie was asked to
talk.
