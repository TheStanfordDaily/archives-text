# Dr. Pierce Preaches at Memorial Church Sunday

"He who does not give his best to
the universe is committing robbery,"
said the Rev. U. G. B. Pierce in his
sermon in Memorial Church Sunday
morning. "We rob God every time we
give our best thought to the labora
tory and devote only the left-over
pieces to Him, when we bemoan our
fate and fail to give Him the gratitude
which is His due, when we refuse to
think of Him entirely and become sat
isfied with mere existence; in short,
when we refuse to take our part in
making this world better.
"The Hebrew law was to give the
best to God. We should follow that
same law and each do his own part,
even if it be only to stay at home."
