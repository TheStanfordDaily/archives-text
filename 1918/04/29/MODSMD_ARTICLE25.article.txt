Now that. Captain Parker is familiar
with the campus and the ability of the
Stanford men in khaki, he is whipping
the embryo infantrymen through the
various forms of close and extended
order work. With the "draft" men
answering to assembly, each company
will be recruited" to nearly maximum
strength, consisting of two platoons
of live squads eacii.
From the way things loom at pres
ent, there will be much competition
in rifle practice. The morning com
pany has already been put through the
paces in this work. According to the
sergeants in charge, the prospects of
efficient riflemen are promising. The
commandant plans to give each cadet
at least fifty shots at the bullseye.
Sprinfigeld rifles chambered especially
for .22's will serve well for the prac
tice.
The afternoon battalions have been
busy studying the nomenclature of the
piece, and brushing up on flag sig
nalling. The "wig-wagging" will af
ford much pleasure, once the signal
lers are able to take and receive mes
sages with little or no hesitation. A
written examination will be given
some time before the close of the
quarter to test the ability of the par
ticipants.
