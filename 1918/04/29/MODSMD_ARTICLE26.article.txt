# INTERCLASS TENNIS TOURNAMENT TO BE SATURDAY MORNING
## 
### 
Arrangements are now being made
j for an interclass tennis tournament
I to be held Saturday morning on the
Kncina courts. Play will start
I promptly at 9 o'clock.
W. C. Bent, '19, captain of this
year's varsity squad, will manage the
tournament and he requests that all
participants appear on the courts this
week so that he may make an accurate
list of the men to represent each
I class. The team representing each
class will be composed of two to four
men as there will be two singles
matches and one doubles event.
For the freshmen, E. S. Turner,
Lounsbury Fish, and Paul Kinney will
put forth a team that may spring a
surprise on the aggregations to be
chosen from the older classes. The
sophomores have a well balanced team
in D. N. Harry, Arthur C. Devlin, and
C. W. Doolittle, while Captain Bent
and C. C. Crosby will, with other play
ers of unknown quality, make a strong
1919 combination.
As for the seniors little can he said.
H. H. Hoss is the only contender who
has played consistently this year, but
this week may reveal some new stars
in the class of 'IS.
Drawings will be made and placed
upon the chart the latter part of this
week, according to an announcement
made today by Captain Bent.
