# Importation . . Wiggle Seems To Be Defunct
## 
### 
Public opinion was just, beginning
' to awaken to a real issue, the war was
being forgotten, communications were
pouring into the editorial rooms of the
Daily Palo Alto, the women were in
dignant and the men happy, when it
suddenly took sick. The poor Import
] Dance had threatened so much, had
been so expectantly awaited, and had
been for such a good purpose. But
now it is on its sick bed, and nigh
unto death, according to reports of
its fond parents.
Reasons for its sad demise are nu
merous, but the one most generally
credited is that the committee had
his date called off on him, and what
would an import dance be without a
properly accompanied committee?
Aside from this generally credited
unfortunate rebuff of the import com
mittee, it is likewise understood that
the "HOO Beautiful Neglected" had
something to do with the declaration
to postpone festivities for some more
propitious occasion. There are strong
reports of action by the women's con
ference, the indignation committee
and other campus joy societies.
However, the idea of an import
; dance has been born, and will grow
[ to be strong enough to become a real
fact in the near future. It is only
necessary for a brilliant brain to sug
gest an idea, and it will eventually
overcome all opposition and develop
into recognized custom.
