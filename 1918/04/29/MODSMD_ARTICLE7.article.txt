### 
Wearing the uniform of a Serbian
cavalry officer and the decorations
conferred on her by the King of Ser
bia, Sergeant Kuth Farnam gave a
stirring address at the University as
sembly this morning on the Serbian
situation and the treatment the Serbs
have received at the hands of their
Austrian oppressors.
"America does not realize," declared
Mrs. Farnam, "that Serbia is the bul
wark that is holding the Hun from
the east and from coming around to
our own shores. Serbia lias played
the same role in the East that Bel
gium has in the West.
"It is the spirit of the Serbs that lias 1
kept them from yielding to the grind
ing heel of their oppressors. During
the five hundred year rule of the
Turks their national ideals were kept
alive and when Austria offered peace
terms the Serbian answer rang out,

'it is better to die in duty than to live
in shame.' The Serbian surrenders
only to God. In their flight they re
treated backwards, fighting all the way
and taking prisoners as they went."
At the outbreak of the Balkan war
Sergeant Farnam went to Serbia,
where she was placed immediately in
service in one of the hospitals. She
worked with the wounded soldiers and
herself saw the horrible mutilations
inflicted on them by the Bulgarians
and Austrians. During the rage of
typhus she served on relief work.
In speaking of the attitude of the
Serbians toward their enemies Ser
geant Farnam said that the Christian
spirit is wonderful. In their hos
pitals the prisoners of war receive
care from the best surgeons and
nurses. "We would not be like them"
is all they Bay in condemnation of
their enemies.
"The only time that the spirit of
those splendid Serbian soldiers was
shaken was when the terrible retreat
over the snow-covered Albanian moun
tains was started and all their sup
plies, munitions, and guns had to be
destroyed. In that seventeen day
fight half of the forces were lost
through disease and from cold and
hunger. After the passage over the
mountains the Allies took the surviv
ors to Corfu and within a few weeks
thousands of the Serbs died from ex
haustion. They are a strong, virile
people but starvation comes quickly in
that country for the people there are
so poor."
In concluding, Sergeant Farnam
stated that the war is no longer a
fight between nations but is now a
struggle between the forces of good
and evil, of might and right, and of
slavery and liberty. "America holds
the destiny of civilization in her
hands," she declared, "and on us de
pends the life of freedom and democ
racy in the world."
