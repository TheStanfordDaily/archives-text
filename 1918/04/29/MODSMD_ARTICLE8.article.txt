## 
### 
After an illness which began more
than a year ago with an attack of
grip, George Archibald Clark, who
had been connected witli the Univer
sity since its opening in 1891, died
last Friday at midnight. He had suf
fered from a spinal disease that was
baffling to physicians, but the imme
diate cause of death was heart
trouble. He was horn in Minnesota
and was 53 years old.
Funeral services were conducted at
the family home, 7 Alvarado, Sunday
afternoon at 3 o'clock by Rev. D.
Charles Gardner and Professor A. T.
Murray. The body was cremated.
Surviving Mr. Clark are his wife,
Mrs. Jennie Corriston Clark; one
daughter, Miss Helm Clark, who is a
senior in Stanford; and three sons.
Donald F. Clark, ex-'IS, who is with
the fourth Stanford ambulance unit
in France; Philip C. Clark, a fresh
man, amj George A. Clark, Jr., a stu

dent in the Palo Alto High School.
Two sisters and four brothers in the
East also survive him.
Pioneer Member of Faculty.
Mr. Clark served the University for
more than twenty-six years as secre
tary to the president, secretary of the
University, and academic secretary.
No one knew better the valuable work
he did for Stanford than Dr. Jordan,
and Stanford's iirst president gave
this appreciation of Mr. Clark:
"He was a university official of the
very highest type. Exact, patient,
courteous,devoted, absolutely unselfish,
he gave services of the greatest impor
tance to Stanford as a whole and vi
tally so to the president, whorhad, in
the early days, distressing problems
of litigation and finance to deal with
as well as with the creation of a new
university. Iti every phase of these
problems he had the unfailing help
of a secretary who never forgot any
thing, who never gave false color, and
whose only thought was the welfare
of the institution he served."
Those who knew Mr. Clark best be
lieve that he literally gave his life to
the University, for the close applica
tion to his office is thought to have
indirectly brought on the affliction
that resulted in death.
He came to Stanford in 1891 to en
ter as a graduate student in Latin. He
took up work in the president's office
as a stenographer, and his ability soon
led to his appointment as a member
of the faculty. He taught shorthand
in the early days, and in 1911-12 he
began offering this course again. He
was an expert shorthand writer and
delighted in this work. In the last
few years he had enlarged the course
to include general secretarial train
ing, and had in preparation a texa
book to be used in the course. Some
years ago he published a shorthand
handbook for use in the stenographic
course.
In addition to his administrative
and teaching duties here, he did notable
work for the government in connec
tion with the Alaska fur seal indus
try. He was secretary to Dr. Jordan
in 1890-98 when Dr. Jordan was head
of the Fur Seal Commission. Later he
was appointed a special inevestigator
for the Bureau of Fisheries on the
Pribilof Islands in Bering Sea and
spent most of the years 1909, 1912, and
1913 there. He acted as editor of the
four large volumes published by the
government under Dr. Jordan's au
thority on the fur seal problem, and
Dr. Jordan says Mr. Clark became the
highest authority on the life and his
tory of the fur seal herd.
Mr. Clark never completed the work
here for his master's degree, but in
1911 he received this degree from the
University of Minnesota, from which
he graduated with an A. 8., in 1891.
The simple funeral services Sunday
afternoon were attended by a large
number of friends in the faculty and of
Palo Alto. The pallbearers were Pro
fessors R. L. Green, J. O. Griffin, H. W.
Stuart, G. C. Price, and O. M. John
ston, and Registrar O. L. Elliott.

years ago he published a shorthand
handbook for use in the stenographic
course.
In addition to his administrative
and teaching duties here, he did notable
work for the government in connec
tion with the Alaska fur seal indus
try. He was secretary to Dr. Jordan
in 1890-98 when Dr. Jordan was head
of the Fur Seal Commission. Later he
was appointed a special inevestigator
for the Bureau of Fisheries on the
Pribilof Islands in Bering Sea and
spent most of the years 1909, 1912, and
1913 there. He acted as editor of the
four large volumes published by the
government under Dr. Jordan's au
thority on the fur seal problem, and
Dr. Jordan says Mr. Clark became the
highest authority on the life and his
tory of the fur seal herd.
Mr. Clark never completed the work
here for his master's degree, but in
1911 he received this degree from the
University of Minnesota, from which
he graduated with an A. 8., in 1891.

than a year ago with an attack of
grip, George Archibald Clark, who
had been connected witli the Univer
sity since its opening in 1891, died

afternoon at 3 o'clock by Rev. D.
Charles Gardner and Professor A. T.

Pioneer Member of Faculty.
Mr. Clark served the University for
more than twenty-six years as secre
tary to the president, secretary of the
University, and academic secretary.
No one knew better the valuable work
he did for Stanford than Dr. Jordan,
and Stanford's iirst president gave
this appreciation of Mr. Clark:
"He was a university official of the
very highest type. Exact, patient,
courteous,devoted, absolutely unselfish,
he gave services of the greatest impor
tance to Stanford as a whole and vi
tally so to the president, whorhad, in
the early days, distressing problems
of litigation and finance to deal with
as well as with the creation of a new
university. Iti every phase of these
problems he had the unfailing help
of a secretary who never forgot any
thing, who never gave false color, and
whose only thought was the welfare
of the institution he served."
Those who knew Mr. Clark best be
lieve that he literally gave his life to
the University, for the close applica
tion to his office is thought to have
indirectly brought on the affliction
that resulted in death.
He came to Stanford in 1891 to en
ter as a graduate student in Latin. He
took up work in the president's office
as a stenographer, and his ability soon
led to his appointment as a member
of the faculty. He taught shorthand
in the early days, and in 1911-12 he
began offering this course again. He
was an expert shorthand writer and
delighted in this work. In the last
few years he had enlarged the course
to include general secretarial train
ing, and had in preparation a texa
book to be used in the course. Some
years ago he published a shorthand
handbook for use in the stenographic
course.
