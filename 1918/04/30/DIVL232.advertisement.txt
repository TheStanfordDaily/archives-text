There was once a farmer who said to himself, "My neighbor paid too
much for his cultivator. I can buy one for $5 less," —and he did.
Two years after that he had to buy a new cultivator, for the cheap one
didn't last; the neighbor was still using his old one.
You can do the same thing in clothes; you can find them $5 or
$10 cheaper than ours anywhere—the materials and tailoring are
even cheaper than the price. But if you want clothes that last,
that will be serving you when the cheaper ones are worn out, pay
a few dollars more—s3o, $35 or $40 and get
Hart Schaffner & Marx clothes
They're all wool, tailored by masters and guaranteed to satisfy you; if they
don't, you get your money back. |
