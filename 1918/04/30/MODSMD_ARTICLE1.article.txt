# TRAINING CAMP REPORT IS NOT VERIFIED HERE
## MAY HAVE TO ENLIST Definite Instructions Have Not Been Received at R.O.T.C. Office 
### 
In connection with the announce
ment issued from Camp Fremont yes
terday to the effect that the fourth
officers' training camp would be held
at Camp Fremont and that men would
not be required to enlist in the army
for the duration of the war, Captain
Parker said this morning that he had
received no information from the War
Department on the subject, and could
not vouch for the correctness of the
announcement.
However Captain Parker thinks that
it is likely that the camp will be held
at Fremont, hut he is of the opinion
that all candidates will be re
quired to enlist for the duration of
the war. The original instructions from
Washington stated that only men in
Class A, or those who have had four
years of military instruction, would
be allowed to enlist for the duration
of the camp, and all others would have
to serve for the length of the war.
Stanford has only two or three men
in Class A, so it is likely that they
will have to enlist as regular privates
in order to get into the camp.
Nearly thirty men have signified
their intention of signing applications
for admission to the camp. About ten
men outside of the University are
planning to putin applications, ac
cording to Captain Parker.
The application blanks for admis
sion to the camp have not been fin
ished by the printers, so the time for
signing the blanks will be extended
slightly beyond May 1.
