will he placed upon advanced and graduate work. Conditions this year for
most college men are, however, different, and many are unsettled as to what
course to pursue in regard to continuing or completing their university work.
For those whose time is limited, an excellent chance to complete work will be

But not only to men who expect to enter some branch of service should

are bejng crowded into a very short space of time—when every minute counts.
No one can afford to waste any of it. University trained men and women are
needed badly in many branches of work, and it would be well for each to con
sider what he could do when his training is completed before spending a sum
mer in "frivoling." Have any of us the right to waste that time in play in
view of the crisis the world is facing now?
President Wilbur and other leaders throughout the country have advised
