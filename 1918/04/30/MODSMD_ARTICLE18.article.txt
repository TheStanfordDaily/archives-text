# "EAT POTATOES" SLOGAN OF FOOD ADMINISTRATION

### 
"Eat potatoes" is the lateßt urgent
request by the food administration
and houses on the campus have been
asked to comply with this demand.
It is estimated by the Department of
Agriculture that 30,000,000 bushels of
potatoes will be wasted unless the
potato crop now held by farmers can
be moved immediately. This waste
will begin with the warm weather,
when potatoes start to sprout. If
the amount of potatoes on hand can
be consumed before June, it will
mean a direct saving of wheat and
other foods for export.
