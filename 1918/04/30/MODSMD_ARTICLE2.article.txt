# DR. JORDAN IS AUTHOR OF TWO WAR BOOKS
## "Pangermanism" and "Democracy and World Relations‚Äù Now on Press 
### 
"The Ways of Pan-Germany and
Other Essays," in addition to "De
mocracy and World Relations," two
recent books written by David Starr
Jordan, will be ready for the public in
the course of a month. They are now
on the press.
The book of essays divides Germany
into two parts, the one entirely dif
ferent from the other in every respect.
He depicts the first group as warm
hearted people, easily led, minutely
efficient and decidedly in sympathy
with the peace and prosperity of the
world, while the other group he pic
tures as uncompromising, vidictive
and determined, willing to resort to
insane military tactics to advance
their own ends.
"Pangermanism" designates the
tents and acts of the Pangermanism
society, as Dr. Jordan puts it, but it
must not be confused with the similar
terms Panslavism and Panamerican
ism. The first of these, according to
Dr. Jordan, represents an uncrystal
lized political sentiment reactionary
in most instances, but incoherent in
action, while the second is, at most,
an expression of geographical good
will.
"Pangermanism is a call to action
of a very definite kind, the substitu
tion in a world carelessly dominated
by the English-speaking races, of a
well knit and coherent system of Ger
manic discipline," says Dr. Jordan,
and he goes on to say further that it
is an organized league of exploiters,
aristocrats, militarists, and visionaries
who will cause utter ruin and an ob
literation of a race of industrious peo
ple to advance their own purpose.
Closely associated with these is a
general staff, "persistently disloyal to
the German government."
Dr. Jordan did not make known the
contents of the second book, "Democ
racy and World Relations," hence it
is not sufficiently known to expound
the principles involved. The title
itself offers the only clue to its con
tents.
The Scientific Monthly recently is
sued in part Dr. Jordan's sentiments
on "The Ways of Pangermany" and
it met with such unusual approval
that it has been printed in pamphlet
form and will soon be on sale at the
bookstore.
