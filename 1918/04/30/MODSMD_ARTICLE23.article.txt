Wonder if the Gamma Phi house
read "Give me an Import or give me
death." It's funny the most persistent
queener on the campus should write a
thing like that. But then you never
can tell what they will do at Chap
arral parties, especially when the ed
itor of the Quad is along.
His—"What happens when Greek
meets Greek?"
Nibs —"They start a restaurant."
SHOOTS
Wonder how much it cost the fire
department to get that statement from
the Thetas?
Maybe the import dance failed be
cause the men couldn't pay the im
port duty. Guess the "500" are in
favor of a protective tariff.
SHOOTS
There's one thing about such an
affair. The imports stay around a lot
longer than the officers.
Heralding the Encina at home Sat
urday night as a spring time dance
turned it into a regular hop.
SHOOTS
Not to be unpatriotic, but we no
tice the market for red, white, and
blue chips has gone down on the cam
pus lately. It is strongly rumored
that certain members of the faculty
detective service are in danger of being
brought up before the National Pa
triotic Committee at Washington for
suppressing the national colors.

Let us petition the women's agri
cultural unit committee to leave un
molested and free to engage in her
chosen vocation one Betty ,
who signed her pledge card thus: "I
WILL NOT pledge my services to the
unit, for I live at a beach summer re
sort and so shall be entirely too busy
to do such work." What heart but
one of stone could require further
service to the men of her country
than that to which this freshman is
willing to sacrifice her whole sum
mer? Would there were more like
her!
SHOOTS
With the threatened approach of
mid-semester exes, a very decided
influx to Italy has been noticed. This
rush is probably augmented by the
fact that the war is rumored to be in
France.

Now that summer is here, the radi
ators in the Hall are working again.
Since they have decided to close
up one of the floors of Encina on ac
count of the war, the men will prob
ably have to take step ladders or
aeroplanes to get to their rooms.
SHOOTS
Come to think of it, how did we
get along without that good new
word "camouflage"? It's so handy to
use, it saves so much effort in think
ing up the term that conveys the
precise meaning intended. "Camou
flage" is going, in a short time, to be
in the same class with that dear old
meaningless wordlet "nice."
OFF
Those thunderous couch-covers with
handles which the women carry
around on their arms, those catch
alls commonly called "knitting bags,"
ought they not to be called camou
flage bags? Knitting material in
side? Well, for war's sake, what all
does it take besides yarn and needles
for knitting?

Professor Krehbiel says that by
exercising sovereign powers imports
can be kept out, but that dissatis

There's one thing about such an

Not to be unpatriotic, but we no

Let us petition the women's agri

chosen vocation one Betty ,

Come to think of it, how did we
get along without that good new

meaningless wordlet "nice."

Professor Krehbiel says that by
