# BULLETIN FOR SUMMER QUARTER OUT TODAY
## 
### 
Courses of instruction for the sum
mer quarter as announced in the
bulletin issued today, include a num
ber of courses not given in the other
quarters. The faculty list includes
over one hundred names of instruc
tors, many of whom are on leaves of
absence from other universities
throughout the country.
In this quarter's bulletin there is a
complete schedule, so that courses
may be made up now, without wait
ing until the last of this quarter.
The number of courses given is
only slightly less than that of the
present quarter, showing that the fac
ulty have planned on a large regis
tration.
