# TENNIS STARS PLAY SATURDAY
## 
### 
Play will commence in the inter
class tennis tournament to be held
on the Encina courts Saturday at 9
o'clock, when representatives of the
four classes will battle for supremacy
in the University.
From present indications, it seems
that well balanced teams will be
turned out by each group. The
freshman combination looks especial
ly strong with such stars as Louns
berry Fish, F. S. Turner, and P. B.
Kinney. For the juniors W. C. Bent
supported by C. C. Crosby and G. C.
Thomas will form a team that at
present looks hard to beat. Bent was
captain of the varsity squad this

year while Crosby was a strong con
tender until he had to withdraw on
account of academic seclusion.
The sophomore aggregation is
composed of A. C. Devlin, D. N. Barry
and C. W. Doolittle. All these men
played on the varsity squad this
year, and will be strong contenders
for first honors.
H. H. Hoss and C. S. Kegley for
. lass of 1918 will have to take
upon themselves the responsibility of
two singles matches and also a round
of doubles. They are the only two
consistent players in the class but
though lacking in quantity, they are
of exceptional quality.
