# UNIVERSITY STUDENTS ASKED TO PLEDGE FOR WAR WORK
## FARM LABORERS NEEDED Burlingame and Cooper In Charge of Enrollments For Stanford 
### 
Owing to the shortage of farm labor,
the Department of Labor has organ
ized the U. S. public service reserve
for the purpose of enrolling college
students for summer employment as
farm laborers or in other necessary
war work, such as ship building. Pro
fessors W. A. Cooper and L. L. Bur
lingame have been placed in charge
of the Stanford bureau and will confer
with students interested in the re
serve.
Secretary Wilson of the Department
of Labor has written to the University
asking that the enrollment of stu
dents take place immediately, as the
shortage of labor for this summer
threatens to assume serious propor
tions in the production of food stuffs.
Students who enroll in the reserve will
not be bound to take positions, but
will only signify that they will be
willing to devote part or all of their
time to war work if the opening is
offered and if they are not otherwise
engaged.
The labor officials regard the matter
as important and indicate that it is
the duty of college students to sign
for the work, with the understanding
that they will be called upon only as
a last resort.
Although no word has been received
on the subject, Professor Burlingame,
who is taking entire charge of the
work during Professor Cooper's ill
ness, is of the opinion that women
may sign the blanks also. The occu
pations in which women workers may
engage are increasing daily, so they
will probably be allowed to enroll in
the reserve.
Enrollment blanks have not arrived
yet, but Professor Burlingame will
take the names of those who desire
to enter the work.
