# Tatlock Writes on Issues of Conflict
## "Democracy Must Conquer or Submit" Says Professor In War Booklet 
### 
"If Democracy is conquered in this
war, all free peoples must either sub
mit to Germany's domination or else
give up a part of their democracy in
order to resist her. We must fight
Germany in Europe with help, that
we may not have to fight her here
in America without help."
In a booklet entitled, "Why Amer
ica Fights Germany," issued by the
United States Committee on Public
Information, Professor J. S. P. Tat
lock thus sets forth the fundamental
reason for our participation In the
war. He shows how Germany has
drowned our citizens, sunk our ships,
intrigued against us, and outraged our
sentiments of right and humanity by
her unspeakable outrages in Belgium
and France, founded as they are on
deliberate principle and precept. He
adds: '"If we had not fought Ger
many after her false and brutal con
duct, we should have been despised
by all the world, including the Ger
mans."
