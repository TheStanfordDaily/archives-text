### 
The "back to the soil" call has come to men as well as to the women in
the University. For the purpose of enlisting college men in the work edu
cational institutions all over the country are being organized and committees
appointed to take charge of securing the services of students.
The raising and harvesting of food stuffs is just as important a phase of
war work as the more precarious service at the front. The danger of a
shortage in food as a result of the shortage of farm labor has become so
serious that it is necessary to organize all reserve forces to ward it off.
For men who are undecided as to what to do during the summer the op
portunity is here given to perform a really patriotic duty, as well as to find
summer work. Since students who enroll with the United States public
service reserve will not be held bound to take position if unforeseen difficul
ties arise, a willingness among the Stanford students to do all in their power
to assist the government should be indicated by a large enrollment of reserve
workers.
