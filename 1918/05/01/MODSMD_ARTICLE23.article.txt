That D. P. A. Tri Delt smoker
wasn't a bad idea after all. If Greene's
and other campus traditions are to be
saved the "500" will have to do the
smoking anyway.

Wonder if they will start a cigar
store in the Women's .Club House
now?

New Roble dormitories are to be
equipped with bells to wake the
women up. Looks like they need
something to put them to sleep rather
than to wake them up.

Redwood has gone dry. Well,
Hush, little bar room, don't you cry,
You'll be a drug store by and by.

Might be a good idea to put bells in
some of the men's living groups. Judg
ing from the last quarter they need
waking up.

It may be popular to speak French,
but it isn't necessary to be in Wilson's
all the time.

"Knitting Tea," a headline reads.
The women ought not try to do the
whole alphabet but should confine
their energies to S—meaning socks
and sweaters for soldiers.

"Can you drive a Ford?" asked the
Red Cross. "If you can you can go
to Italy." No one would admit to not
being able to drive a Ford. Hence
the great number of people swamp
ing the Ford market in Palo Alto.
Haven't you noticed the careful
speedburners that have suddenly ap
peared? Statistics prove that there
were more little Henrys on the cam
pus yesterday than ever before —pro-
spective ambulance drivers. Poor
Italians.

PERENNIAL SPRING POK\T
With no apologies to the Sequoia.
(Note —This is the poem that won
the prize of the jeweled canopener.
There was another poem banded in,
but this was the only one the commit
tee couldn't understand.)
