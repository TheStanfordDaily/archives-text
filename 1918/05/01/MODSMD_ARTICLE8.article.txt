# ONE HUNDRED SIGN TO DRIVE LTALIAN AMBULANCE CARS
## 
### 
Since the announcement of the for
mation of the Italian ambulance unit
Monday morning, nearly 100 men have
been taken by storm and have signed
the roll in the registrar's oflice and
with Professor H. R. Fairclough, who
has charge of the Stanford unit. Only
twenty-five or thirty men will be al
lowed to make the trip from this Uni
versity.
Examinations in loyalty and driving
and repairing Ford cars will be held
this week. It is expected that a good
percentage of the men will fail on the
repairing test and probably on the
physical examination. From the num
ber that pass the three tests the per
sonnel of the unit will be chosen.
The successful recruits will leave
for Italy in the early part of this
month for their six months' service.
At the expiration of the six months
the men will be brought back to the
Unitel States by the Red Cross.
Although there is no university
rule to the effect as yet, it is probable
that the men chosen will be granted
their hours if they leave after May 5.
All expenses for the trip are to be
paid by the Red Cross, both on the
way over and while there. An at
tractive feature of the new unit has
been the promise that the men will be
sent to Italy immediately.
