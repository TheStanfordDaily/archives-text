# ALUMNAE ORGANIZATION TO FINANCE WAR MOVES
## Committee Will Support Woman's French Relief Unit 
### 
Stanford Alumnae in San Francisco
will hereafter be able to give war ac
tivities full support as a result of a
permanent organization to be known
as the San Francisco Committee for
Stanford Women's War Service which
was formed at a meeting of promi
nent women at the St. Francis Hotel
yesterday afternoon. The purpose of
the organization is to support finan
cially all undertakings of the "500"
on the campus.
Mrs. Edwin J. Thomas, '04, is the
head of the committee, with Miss
Lydia Boezinger, '15, corresponding
secretary. The other officers are
Mrs. James E. Lanagen, '00, vice
chairman; Mrs. B. H. Warren, '06,
secretary; and Mrs. Lloyd Henley,>
'06, treasurer. All these women are
residents of San Francisco.
Will Help Unit
The first work of the new commit
tee will be to give support to the wo
men's civilian Relief Unit which is to
be sent to France from the Univers
ity as soon as possible. In order
to interest the committee several
members of the unit spoke before the
women at the St. Francis. J. E. Mc-
Dowell, Assistant Registrar of the
University, outlined the financial
plans, while Miss Dorothy Egbert, '16,
spoke of the support which has been
given the Unit in other parts of the
state. H. C. Blote, ex-'lB, a mem
ber of the first Stanford Ambulance
Unit in France, then spoke of the
desolation of the civilian population
in France as he had seen it and urged
the sending of as many units as pos
sible immediately.
Miss Sue Byer and Miss Edith Mir
rielees both told the alumnae of the
work which the unit hopes to take up.
Following the meeting Marie Dress
ier, famous actress, subscribed $500
to the unit.
That the new committee will be 1
able to give every activity of the'
women on the campus its fullest sup
port, another meeting is to be held
on Saturday in order to make plans
for gathering all the former students
of the University together to tell
them of the committee and its work.
A permanent organization will be ef
fected at that time in order that im
mediate support can be given any
call that may come out from the cam
pus.
The mass meeting of graduates
and former students will probably be
held March 9 in the ball room of the
St. Francis according to present ar
rangements.
An effort is to be made immedi
ately to raise the required money for
the Women's Relief Unit by the new
committee, in order that the women
may reach France as soon as possible.
