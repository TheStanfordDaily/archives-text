# ITALIAN AMBULANCE UNIT CLOSED
## 
### 
Because the unit has been filled
from eastern colleges, the Washington
headquarters of the American Red
Cross notified Professor H. R. Fair
clough through its San Francisco of
fice, this morning that recruiting
for the Italian ambulance unit has
been discontinued for the present.
There is a possibility, according to
Professor Fairclough, that a unit will
be organized here later.
His statement follows:
"The San Francisco office of the
American Red Cross, which asked me
to enroll students for an ambulance
unit to go to Italy, and assured me

that from twenty to twenty-five would
be accepted, has telephoned that a
message from Washington headquar
ters orders them to discontinue re
cruiting, as the unit has already been
filled.
"The head of the personnel bureau
in San Francisco and I are extremely
sorry that this is the outcome of so
much enthusiasm, and regret that con
siderable disappointment must be
caused those who have signed up so
readily. It is hoped, however, that a
later unit will be formed, and that
such men will be given another
chance to enlist in the service."
H. R. FAIRC'LOUGH.
