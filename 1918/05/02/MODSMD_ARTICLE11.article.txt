# WOMEN ARRANGE FOR GET-TOGETHER PARTY
## 
### 
Next. Tuesday evening the women
will hold their last all-university get
together party of the year in the
Women's Club House. The idea of the
committee in charge is to provide a
time at which the women of Stanford
can leave all their general interests
for the moment, and get together on
their common interest â€”Stanford.
At 6 o'clock supper will be served on
the little tables downstairs in the
clubhouse. Between the courses
there will be clever stunts and songs
such as only college girls can pre
sent. The get-together party will be
concluded by dancing upstairs. Tick
ets for the party, including the supper,
will be 35 cents. They will be placed
on sale at all the houses, or can be
obtained from Miss Henrietta Dickey,
'20, at the Delta Delta Delta house.
