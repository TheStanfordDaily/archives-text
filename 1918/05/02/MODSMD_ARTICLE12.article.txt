# RED CROSS TO LAUNCH CAMPAIGN TONIGHT
## 
### 
Stanford's Red Cross will conduct
a drive tonight in all the living
groups for the purpose of raising
money to cover the expenses incurred
in running the work room in the Wo
men's Club House. Each person will
he asked to contribute at least 25
cents.
H
The increase in attendance has
caused the expenditure of $8 a day
and as there is no money left in
the treasury it will be necessary to
obtain the money or close the work
room. The auxiliary is confident that
every one will respond to the urgent
and important call.
