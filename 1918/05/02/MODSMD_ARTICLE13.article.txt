# "Big Struggle" Slated for Next Saturday Night
## 
### 
'"War extras" in the shape of post
ters placed in prominent places about
the University today proclaimed a
"big struggle on the campus" for Sat
urday night, May 4. The "struggle"
will be a real Campus Dance in the
Women's Club House. That it will
he a success will be readily believed
when the names of the musians be
come known. "Don" McNamee, '20,
and P. K. Weaver, '20, "jazz" special
ists, promise to have their beet or
chestra on hand.
Dancing will start promptly at 8
o'clock and continue until midnight.
Admission will be one dollar a couple
plus the usual war tax. As the "im
port" dance has been given up, the
date is free from conflicting attrac
tions and a big crowd is expected for
the party.
