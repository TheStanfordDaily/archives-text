The huge song festival to be given in the Stanford football bleachers in
June promises to be a most stupendous and spectacular event in several
ways. In the first place, the opportunity to hear the great concert of voices
and the combined military bands that will be assembled is one that does not
come often in a lifetime. But the song festival will offer a bigger oppor
tunity, and that is to bridge over the differences that unfortunately exist
between Camp Fremont and the University.
Unfounded though the belief may be, it is generally felt at camp that
the men are not wanted on the University grounds for any reason whatsoever,
and that they are excluded by the Stanford authorities. This is not the case.
The only specification made by the University is that soldiers shall not pass
over the Stanford campus in large bodies. Any other rulings that exist have
emanated from camp headquarters, though this fact does not seem to be gen
erally known. Each Stanford student should feel himself responsible to
in any way alleviate the feeling that Stanford University is hostile to any
man in the service.
Now that Camp Fremont has joined forces with Stanford to support the
women's unit for relief in France a common ground seems to be supplied for
the two groups to work together. Let's hope that all differences may be
drowned in the song festival and that Stanford and the boys in khaki may
work harmoniously for a common aim.
