# Fourth Officers Camp to Be Held at Various Points
## 
### 
Definite information on the fourth
ofiicers' training camp was received
by Captain Parker this morning to the
effect that the men chosen from Stan
ford will not be sent to Camp Fremont
alone, but to any one of the training
camps in the west. A new feature
of the camps is that the men will move
with the division that they are as
signed to, and serve as privates if the
War Department decides to discon
tinue their training in the event that
the divisions are sent to France.
As previously announced, all can
didates will be required to enlist as
privates, only those in Class A being
allowed to serve for the duration of
the camp. If the candidates fail in
the training camps, they will auto
matically assume the position of pri
vates in the regular army.
Orders from the War Department
require that the names of the men
that Stanford will send to the camps
be selected by May 5. Captain Parker
has received the application blanks
and requests that candidates for the
camp sign with him immediately.
Stanford can only send one or two
men in Class A, as four years of mil
itary instruction are required for this
class. About twenty-live men will
be recommended in the remaining
classes.
