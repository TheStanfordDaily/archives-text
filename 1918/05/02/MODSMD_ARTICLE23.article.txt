We, the Alpha Delta, take this op
portunity to thank the Daily for the
kind advertising they have afforded
us. We are only sorry that the sec
ret is out. We had planned a grand
opening of the slide for Saturday
evening to compete against the Im
po'rt Dance and thereby get in good
with our neighbors, but since the
dance fell through we had given up
the plan. Now that we find so many
students are interested in its welfare
we take this opportunity to invite the
public to our unusual celebration on
Saturday. We will be at home from
seven till ten-thirty, P. M.
Since the president put a stop to
all athletics and has substituted no
exercise other than military train
ing we thought it necessary to furnish
the populace with some form of clean
sport which will allow open compe
tition with no need for paid coaches.
The fact that this pioneer sport has
at last been permitted on the campus
with the sanction of the president and
the graduate manager, we expect a
large turnout of Varsity letter men to
try for the jumping team and whip
the bunch of feminine tryoutees into
shape. We are more than gratified
to learn that the campus is taking
kindly to this Athletic Bevo.
Nor is the slide a partisan affair.
It was erected for the benefit of the
women as well as the men. Some of
the "500" have already taken advant
age of the opportunity, disporting
themselves in the light of the moon.
The ends have justified the means —
but since the moon doesn't come up
nowadays until after midnight, we
should like to take this opportunity
to suggest that the Pi Phis and the
Kappas remember the ten-thirty rule
and not wait up for the moon. It is
very hard on our rep as students and
may also be the reason why so many
of us wear the horn rims.
All the latest sliding devices such
as tin pans, wax, rugs, etc., may be
had on application by phone or by
calling in person. In anticipation of
the rush on Saturday evening it is
necessary that we lay down a few
simple rules to be followed by those
sliding. Please sign up in the guest
book; light on the feet if possible;
bring student body cards, and don't'
take any of th slide home with you—
it's made of wood. As an added at
traction at the opening we will give a
handsome pair of horn rimmed spec
tacles for the most graceful feminine
jumper. No admission will be
charged, so many queeners are ex
pected.

Nor is the slide a partisan affair.
It was erected for the benefit of the
women as well as the men. Some of
the "500" have already taken advant
age of the opportunity, disporting
themselves in the light of the moon.
The ends have justified the means —
but since the moon doesn't come up
nowadays until after midnight, we
should like to take this opportunity
to suggest that the Pi Phis and the
Kappas remember the ten-thirty rule
and not wait up for the moon. It is
very hard on our rep as students and
may also be the reason why so many
of us wear the horn rims.
All the latest sliding devices such
as tin pans, wax, rugs, etc., may be
had on application by phone or by
calling in person. In anticipation of
the rush on Saturday evening it is
necessary that we lay down a few
simple rules to be followed by those
sliding. Please sign up in the guest
book; light on the feet if possible;
bring student body cards, and don't'
take any of th slide home with you—
it's made of wood. As an added at
traction at the opening we will give a
handsome pair of horn rimmed spec
tacles for the most graceful feminine
jumper. No admission will be
charged, so many queeners are ex
pected.
Sincerely Signed,
THE ALPHA DELTS.
We, the Alpha Delta, take this op
portunity to thank the Daily for the
kind advertising they have afforded
us. We are only sorry that the sec
ret is out. We had planned a grand
opening of the slide for Saturday
evening to compete against the Im
po'rt Dance and thereby get in good
with our neighbors, but since the
dance fell through we had given up
the plan. Now that we find so many
students are interested in its welfare
we take this opportunity to invite the
public to our unusual celebration on
Saturday. We will be at home from
seven till ten-thirty, P. M.
Since the president put a stop to
all athletics and has substituted no
exercise other than military train
ing we thought it necessary to furnish
the populace with some form of clean
sport which will allow open compe
tition with no need for paid coaches.
The fact that this pioneer sport has
at last been permitted on the campus
with the sanction of the president and
the graduate manager, we expect a
large turnout of Varsity letter men to
try for the jumping team and whip
the bunch of feminine tryoutees into
shape. We are more than gratified
to learn that the campus is taking
kindly to this Athletic Bevo.
