# Searchlight Seeks Campus Queeners
## 
### 
Is it German spies or campus queen
ers? Some hidden motive has moved
the Phi Kappa Psis to mount on the
roof of their towering structure which
flirts with the clouds, a strong search
light. From its commanding vantage
point, this light plays about the cam
pus, particularly when the moon is not
full, but sober, and causes much won
derment.
If it is a new form of "roughing it"
to various activities in the realm of
queening, then we have to hand it to
the Phi Psis for originality in com
bining efficiency with convenience.
Certain popular campus lounge
lizards, who have formed the habit of
queening, have confided to members
of the D. P. A. staff that this same
search light is at times troublesome,
and seems to have a faculty for pop
ping in on the scene at times such as
to cause situations that are incon
venient and bothersome, not to say
embarrassing. It is rumored that as
a result of this innovation, such parts
of the campus as the arboretum and
the side-streets are to be greatly pop
ularized at the expense of the Row
and the vicinity of the polywoggery,
known as Laguanita.
