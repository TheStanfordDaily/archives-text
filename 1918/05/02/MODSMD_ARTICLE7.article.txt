# PUBLIC OPINION ON THE WAR DISCUSSED BY DR. PIERCE
## EXPLAINS ATTITUDE OF AMERICA Senate Chaplain Declares Neutrality Impossible in World Conflict 
### 
In one of the most brilliant and
stimulating talks an war problems
ever given here, Dr. Ulysses G. B.
Pierce, chaplain of the United States
Senate, addressed the University as
sembly this morning on "The Present
State of American Public Opinion on
the War."
Dr. Pierce opened his lecture with
a picturization of the state of this
country a year ago, before the out
break of the war. "We were a happy,
contented people," said the chaplain,
"fortunately inclined to always look
on the bright side of things. When
the news of war came we tried to
go on living in that fool's paradise
for a while by trying to think our
selves neutral in a matter in which
no human being who thinks could be
neutral.
"It is my opinion," said Dr. Pierce,
"that if the United States had con
tinued as a neutral that within a
short time certain forces of disinte
gration would have been stimulated
which would have created a problem
of demoralization of as serious a na
ture as that of the war. We would
easily have become victims of the
shrewd plotters at home who were
only looking for an opening through
which to break Up our national unity.
"Of the many forces which have
been active in molding the people of
the United States into a united
whole there are six which have
played important roles in the stimu
lating and solidifying of the Ameri
can mind. The first of these is the
income tax passed some time before
the declaration of war but peculiarly
effective in placing in the hands of
the government accounts of the re
sources of the country. The tax
called for an individual accounting
of resources —a domestic inventory.
All thiß was occomplished before the
emergency of war which meant that
the government had an accurate
working basis of the resources of
every citizen.
"The second important force has
been the draft law. In this wise and
efficient forming of an adequate na
tional defense it was our homes and
not our pocketbooks which were
touched. The law does not discimin
ate —it reaches alike the homes of
the rich and poor.
"Tne application and operation of
the Liberty Loan has proved to be a
third force in this stimulating and
solidifying of the American public
opinion. Oppositon to the loan con
tended that a better method of rais
ing revenue for the support of the
war would be to increase the tax In
crement. But the government was
wiser and saw a certain psychological
satisfaction that the citizens of the
United States would feel In aiding
the government by the purchase of
Liberty bonds.
"Almost universally the press has
co-operated in the spreading of prop
aganda of the war. The moving pic
ture is another medium for the edu
cation of the people in war problems
which a few years ago was thought
of only as a toy.
"The church is the last of these
stimulating forces and has shown it
self to be a powerful organ and a
focus of patriotic power in the na
tion."

Acting President C. D. Marx pre
sided at the Assembly and introduced
Professor Tatlock, who spoke briefly
on the Third Liberty Bond issue be-;
fore Dr. Pierce lectured. Mr. Tat
lock also announced that a local cam
paign for labor for the United States
Public Service Reserves would be
started here shortly and that as soon
as the necessary enrollment cards ar- 1
rive announcement of it will be
made through the Daily Palo Alto.
In one of the most brilliant and
stimulating talks an war problems
ever given here, Dr. Ulysses G. B.
Pierce, chaplain of the United States
Senate, addressed the University as
sembly this morning on "The Present
State of American Public Opinion on
the War."
Dr. Pierce opened his lecture with
a picturization of the state of this
country a year ago, before the out
break of the war. "We were a happy,
contented people," said the chaplain,
"fortunately inclined to always look
on the bright side of things. When
the news of war came we tried to
go on living in that fool's paradise
for a while by trying to think our
selves neutral in a matter in which
no human being who thinks could be
neutral.
"It is my opinion," said Dr. Pierce,
"that if the United States had con
tinued as a neutral that within a
short time certain forces of disinte
gration would have been stimulated
which would have created a problem
