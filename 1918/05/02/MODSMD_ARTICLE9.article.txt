# BIG MUSICAL FETE PLANNED
## Fremont Soldiers Will Sing in Songfest 
### 
Over 7,000 singers, eight regimental
bands in competition, and thousands
of civilian and soldier spectators will
hold sway in the Stanford football
bleachers on Sunday afternoon, June
2 at 2:30. A big songfest has been
planned for this date by the War
Camp Communty Service Committee
of Camp Fremont, of which commit
tee Professor R. F. Swain of Stanford
is chairman.
Both this committee and the Stan
ford Women's Reconstruction Unit
Committee are combining in efforts
to make the musical fete a success.
Both the war camp recreation fund
and the Stanford unit are to share
in the proceeds that will be reaped
through the songfest.
I'se Bleachers for First Time
This will be the first time that the
Stanford football bleacher will be
used for any event of this kind. Per
mission for the use of the bleachers
for the songfest was granted by the
Board of Trustees of the University,
explaining that the good purpose over
came the objections to the irregular

ity of the use of football bleachers
for musical purposes. The event Is
expected to draw a large crowd and
will probably tax the capacity of the
bleachers to the utmost.
Committee to lie Appointed
J. E. McDowell has been appointed
by the Woman's Unit committee,
which is headed by Professor C. D.
Marx, to act as chairman of a com
mittee for the purpose of making all
necessary arrangements. He is to ap
point the members of the committee
who are to act with him. Special
trains are to be run from San Fran
cisco, San Jose and neighboring
points, with excursion rates for the
occasion.
Major General Morrison, command
ing officer at Camp Fremont, has
announced himself as being in favor
of the plan and has offered to aid in
seeing that the necessary 7,000 sol
dier singers are forthcoming. Regi
mental bands are alieady looking
forward to June 2, as the date in
which to test their efficiency in com
petition.
