### 
Baseball equipment is needed by "Doc" Howard for his men in the 83d
Machine Gun Battalion, and he is asking each fraternity on the campus to
contribute bats, balls, or gloves. in camp have been fur
nished with some sort of sport equipment, by some organization or other, and
"Doc" is asking Stanford to help his men. The problem of what men in
army camps shall do in their spare time is an important one, for it is essen
tial that they be kept contented. The giving of baseball equipment will mean
little to Stanford men.
The cause is a worthy one. It is far better to furnish amusement to the
soldiers than to frighten the wits out of the co-eds as they go up and down
the Row.
