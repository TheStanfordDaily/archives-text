# WAR NEWS ORGANIZED

### 
For those who wish to keep up to date on war news the bibliography of
current literature compiled by the war information committee will be a great
help. When time is pressing, as it is for most of us, it is difficult to look
through current magazines for the news we want. But with current articles
completely catalogued discussion of big issues of the moment will be avail
able to all students.
