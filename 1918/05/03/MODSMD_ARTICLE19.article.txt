In spite of the heavy strain which
the war has put on construction,
the University has been able to con
tinue practically all its building pro
gram and make other improvements
which had been mapped out for this
year. Besides the new presidential
residence, new women's dormitory,
library, and aero dymanics labora
tory, many improvements are being
made in the line of new driveways
and new shrubbery.
The work on the new women's
dormitory is practically completed
and all the finishing touches will be
put on during the next two weeks.
The administration has not said
whether or not it will be occupied be
fore the Bummer quarter. Four more
weeks will be required for the com
pletion of President Wilbur's new
home. When finished It will be one
of the handsomest residences down
the peninsula.
If the program laid down by the P.
S. Walker Company can be carried
out without delay the new library
will be ready for occupancy during

he expected the building to be fin

very latest. No formal announce

position will be made of the old li
brary but it is understood by many
students that the law department and
law library will be moved into that
building.
