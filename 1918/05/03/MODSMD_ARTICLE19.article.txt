# WILBUR'S HOUSE TO BE COMPLETED IN NEAR FUTURE
## 
### 
In spite of the heavy strain which
the war has put on construction,
the University has been able to con
tinue practically all its building pro
gram and make other improvements
which had been mapped out for this
year. Besides the new presidential
residence, new women's dormitory,
library, and aero dymanics labora
tory, many improvements are being
made in the line of new driveways
and new shrubbery.
The work on the new women's
dormitory is practically completed
and all the finishing touches will be
put on during the next two weeks.
The administration has not said
whether or not it will be occupied be
fore the Bummer quarter. Four more
weeks will be required for the com
pletion of President Wilbur's new
home. When finished It will be one
of the handsomest residences down
the peninsula.
If the program laid down by the P.
S. Walker Company can be carried
out without delay the new library
will be ready for occupancy during
the early part of 1919. Farm Superin
tendent J. E. Hewston said today that
he expected the building to be fin
ished by this time next year at the
very latest. No formal announce
ment has been made as to what dis
position will be made of the old li
brary but it is understood by many
students that the law department and
law library will be moved into that
building.
Work on the new aero dynamics
laboratory, which Is being built be
tween Stanford Union and the foun
dry, is being rushed along rapidly. The
new building will be ready for occu
pancy before the first quarter starts
next fall. Machinery and apparatus
will be putin the laboratory for
making and testing aeroplane propell
ers and other working parts of the
heavier than air machines.
Residents of the Row will hail with
joy the announcement of Mr. Hewston
that work on the completion of the
road near the Postoffice will begin
immediately. A steam roller is to be
put to work again on the crushed
rocks tomorrow or Monday, and the
road will be thoroughly rolled and
oiled.
The delay was due to the difficulty
in getting a steam roller and then a
break down of the roller caused an
other delay which took considerable
time to repair. The roller is fixed
now and the road will be finished
as soon as possible. Difficulty in get
ting oil for paving shipped to the
campus also hindered the work.
Laguanita Drive Improved
A concrete curbing has been laid
along all the Laguanita drive, which
has been extended and passed around
the hill in front of President Wilbur's
home, and leads out and connects
with the county road running toward
Camp Fremont.
The dirt from the hill in front of
the presidential home is being putin
the lower ground back of the Zeta
Psi house, making that part of the
campus suitable for building sites.
Shrubbery and ornamental trees
have been set out on the hill and on
other parts of the field between La
guanita and the houses on the Row.
Water is being hauled to the young
plants in order to insure their growth
during the dry summer months.

very latest. No formal announce
ment has been made as to what dis
position will be made of the old li
brary but it is understood by many
students that the law department and
law library will be moved into that
building.
Work on the new aero dynamics
laboratory, which Is being built be
tween Stanford Union and the foun
dry, is being rushed along rapidly. The
new building will be ready for occu
pancy before the first quarter starts
next fall. Machinery and apparatus
will be putin the laboratory for
making and testing aeroplane propell
ers and other working parts of the
heavier than air machines.
Residents of the Row will hail with
joy the announcement of Mr. Hewston
that work on the completion of the
road near the Postoffice will begin
immediately. A steam roller is to be
put to work again on the crushed
rocks tomorrow or Monday, and the
road will be thoroughly rolled and
oiled.
The delay was due to the difficulty
in getting a steam roller and then a
break down of the roller caused an
other delay which took considerable
time to repair. The roller is fixed
now and the road will be finished
as soon as possible. Difficulty in get
ting oil for paving shipped to the
campus also hindered the work.
Laguanita Drive Improved
A concrete curbing has been laid
along all the Laguanita drive, which
has been extended and passed around
the hill in front of President Wilbur's
home, and leads out and connects
with the county road running toward
Camp Fremont.
The dirt from the hill in front of
the presidential home is being putin
the lower ground back of the Zeta
Psi house, making that part of the
campus suitable for building sites.
Shrubbery and ornamental trees
have been set out on the hill and on
other parts of the field between La
guanita and the houses on the Row.
Water is being hauled to the young
plants in order to insure their growth
during the dry summer months.
In spite of the heavy strain which
the war has put on construction,
the University has been able to con
tinue practically all its building pro
gram and make other improvements
which had been mapped out for this
year. Besides the new presidential
residence, new women's dormitory,
library, and aero dymanics labora
tory, many improvements are being
made in the line of new driveways
and new shrubbery.
The work on the new women's
dormitory is practically completed
and all the finishing touches will be
put on during the next two weeks.
The administration has not said
whether or not it will be occupied be
fore the Bummer quarter. Four more
weeks will be required for the com
pletion of President Wilbur's new
home. When finished It will be one
of the handsomest residences down
the peninsula.
If the program laid down by the P.
S. Walker Company can be carried
out without delay the new library
will be ready for occupancy during
the early part of 1919. Farm Superin
tendent J. E. Hewston said today that
he expected the building to be fin
ished by this time next year at the
very latest. No formal announce

position will be made of the old li
