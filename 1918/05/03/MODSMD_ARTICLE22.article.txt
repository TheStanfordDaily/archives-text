If the co-eds could see the trans
figured physiognomies'of some of the
hoys when they are practicing bayonet
fighting in military, they would cancel
all their dates for the next six months.
Wonder who is ahead in the Kappa
Alpha-Kappa Sigma indoor baseball
series?

The winner, ought to play the Chi
Omegas for the championship of the
University.
OFF
What will the Daily do, now that
they are going to fix those rocks by
the joBtoffice. There won't be anything
to kick about at all.
SHOOTS ,
What do you allow for the English
Club staging their uncustomary blow
out at Redwood? Guess they are run
ning competition to Hammer and
Coffin. Seems like these organizations
are making hay while the sun shines.
Maybe it's getting gay with the bar
signs.
SHOOTS
While the thought's in our mind, we
notice that the Y. M. C. A. has called
a meeting of all its cabinet members
for one of these nights.
At that the Chi Omegas might con
tribute to the baseball* equipment for
Camp Fremont.

SPRING POETRY
My nose is red,
My lips are blue,
I don't belong to the English Club,
But I've been to Redwood, too.
I am a little co-ed,
I tit from bough to bough.
When I can't queen an officer, I go to
the movies with some campus
gent.
One of the boys, in speaking of at
tending classes, says he's like a Ford
â€”he's been missing all week.

They say that when they lose a ten
nis ball at the women's courts they
don't worry. The mosquitos are get
ting big enough and thick enough to
answer the purpose.
Certain of the renowned campus
queeners have gone on record as say
ing that since the clock was set ahead
an hour some time ago, they are
strongly In favor of dancing until 1
o'clock on Saturday nights, because it
really isn't Sunday till then, you
know.
SHOOTS
Wonder of the Y. M. C. A. will meet
at Redwood?

POOR LITTIESTEAMROLLER
The Daily rejoices to learn that no
body has been to blame for those
rocks above the postofflce. A poor lit
tle steamroller has had the tummy
ache, or something else, for six
months. Doctor says the steamroller
will "soon be on its feet again." If
it isn't, Daily should suggest that each
person take a rock away with him in
passing, and soon the path would be
celar of the troublesome stones.
