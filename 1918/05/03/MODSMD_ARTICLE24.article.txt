# WOMEN INTEREST THEMSELVES IN RED CROSS WORK HERE
## 
### 
Reports have been turned in from j
eight houses, specifying the number of
hours given to Red Cross work, and !
the per cent of members from each
house that has given time for this
work. The women thus far have '
shown a creditable interest in doing
their share towards helping win this
war, but the percentage of women who 1
appear at the Red Cross rooms is j
small in comparison to the total num- j
her of women on the campus.
Fifty per cent of Alpha Omicron Pi j
members worked on Red Cross work
last week, averaging forty-seven
hours; Kappa Kappa Gamma, twenty
six hours, 62 per cent; Pi Beta Phi,
twelve hours; Gamma Phi, 68 per cent,
eleven hours; Sigma Kappa, ten and
one-half hours, 42 per cent; Roble
Club, two hours, 1 per cent; Madrono
Club, one hour, 5 1-2 per cent.
