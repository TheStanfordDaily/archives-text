# Doc Howard Asks Campus for National Game Supplies for Fremont Soldiers Idle Hours
## 
### 
From the 83rd Machine Gun Bat
talion, Co. B, comes the appeal for
supplies for the men to engage in the
great American game. Before the
war took its place, baseball was the
big sport of the American young man,
and even war cannot down the innate
instinct for the sport of bat and ball.
It is the spare time of the soldier
that worries the company command
ers more than the hours of absolute
work, for the spare hours and idle
time bring with them homesickness
and lessening patriotism, according to
Major General Morrison.
Lieutenant G. K. Howard, "Doc" to
the campus when he was here with
the seventeeners, has asked Stanford
to do her best in supplying his com
pany, over which he is company com
mander, Company B of the 83rd Ma
chine Gun Battalion, with the neces
sary supplies for baseball games. As
Howard points out, the request is a
very modest one, especially in the
light of good that will result from its
successful fulfillment.
It is planned that the best means
to collect material will be to have the
living and eating groups on the cam
pus supply the company with either
baseballs, bats, or gloves. With the
proper amount of co-operation, little
difficulty is expected in meeting the
call from the boys in camp.
