# INTERCLASS TENNIS MATCHES ON ENCINA COURTS TOMORROW
## 
### 
Stanford tennis devotees will be
given their last opportunity to view
the Cardinal racquet wielders tomor
row morning at 9 o'clock on the En
cina courts when the interclass tennis
tournament will be held.
With only the best men from each
class represented in the tournament,
some fast tennis may be expected.
The classes appear to be fairly well
matched, although the sophomores are
slight favorites, having three men out
of four on this year's varsity squad.
However, the sophomores will meet a
hard combination in the first matches
when they come up against the fresh
men. D. N. Barry, '20, who played
first man on the varsity against Cali
fornia, will meet Lounsberry Fish,
'21, star performer of the freshman
aggregation. In the other singles
match, A. C. Devlin, '20, will cross
racquets with F. S. Turner, '21. In
doubles Barry and C. W. Doolittle, '20
will meet P. B. Kinney, '21, and Turn
er or Fish.
In the upper half of the schedule,
W. C. Bent, '19. captain of the varsity,
will meet H. H. Hoss, '18, and C. S.
Kegley will meet G. C. Thomas,
'19. Captain Bent and C. C. Crosby,
'19, will cross racquets-with Hoss and
Kegley in doubles.
