# FOURTH STANFORD AMBULANCE UNIT ON WAY TO FRONT
## LETTER RECEIVED FROM F.J. TAYLOR Stanford Men Stop Off At Paris Before Leaving For Trenches 
### 
Word has been received from F. J.
Taylor, ex-'lB, by J. E. MacDowell
that the Fourth Stanford Ambulance
Unit, which Mr. MacDowell organized
here last year, passed through Paris
on March 31 on their way to the
front. The unit has been stationed
at Allentown for several months, and
left this country early in March for
France.
In his letter to Mr. McDowell, Tay
lor says: "Your section of Allentown
Ambulancers went through here Sun
day en route for the front, after many
delays. They were glad to get out.
Unfortunately, I was out of town
then, and didn't get to see them,
though Carl Randau did. I saw Ben
nie Hake and Dale Van Every, who
were a day late, having done some
scouting around for a lost Ford."
Since the disbandment of the second
ambulance unit with which Taylor
went to France, he has been writing
a history of the American Field Ser
vice. He is now engaged in news
paper work.
Hake and Van Every both joined
the Ambulance Unit last year. The
unit left Stanford early in the sum
mer and has been kept in training at
Allentown until March of this year.
Hoth men gelonged to the class of
1918.
