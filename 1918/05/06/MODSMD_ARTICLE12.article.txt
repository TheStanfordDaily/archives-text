# GERMAN WAR PRACTICES WILL BE REVEALED AT LECTURE
## DR. HILLIS WILL TELL OF VISIT TO FRONT Noted Preacher To Disclose Atrocities Practiced By Kaiser's Troops 
### 
Bringing a message of condemna
tion and indictment to the German
war lord and his staff, Dr. Newell
Dwight Hills will deliver his illus
tiated lecture on "German Atrocities"
at the Assembly Hall, Wednesday
evening.
Detailed accounts of the horrors per
petrated by the Kasier's troops, to
gather with an explanation of the na
ture and philosophy of the German
atrocities in France and Belgium,
make this lecture a ringing condem
nation of German war practices.
Dr. HilliB visited the battle fields of
northern France and Flanders as the
special guest of the French, British
and Belgium governments. Escorted
by their representatives, he covered
the entire 600 miles of the Western
battle front, spending many days and
nights in the trenches with the Allied
soldiers. On this tour he took over
600 photographs and collected of
ficial records, affidavits, and German
instruments of torture which he ex
hibits as evidence of their deeds of
barbarity.
As successor of Henry Ward
Beecher, and pastor for nineteen
years of the Plymouth Church, Brook
lyn, N. Y., Dr. Hillis is cited at one of
the most powerful speakers in the
United States. Throughout the east
ern states he held audiences spell
bound by his vivid recital of the con
ditions in Europe.
Dr. Hillis is one of the first great
sneakers to return to America, bring
ing with him a knowledge and evi
dence of the actual conditions prevail
ing in Europe. The evidence pre
sented by him thoroughly confirms
the worst reports which have come to
America.
