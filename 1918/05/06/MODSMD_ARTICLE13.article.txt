# Women's Basketball Team Loses to Mills
## Stanford Women Defeated by 8 to 11 Score in Last Saturday's Game 
### 
Mills college defeated the Stanford
women's baseball team 18 to 11 at
its annual field day held last Saturday
afternoon.
The Stanford nine were chosen last
week by Mrs. Vincenz, the coach,
from fifteen candidates. "The girls
played a good game, considering what
little practice they had had. They
had been playing indoor baseball, and
it was not until last Monday that
they changed, which change necessi
tated a different pitching and new
type of ball. The team was able to
practice together only once before its
game with Mills," said Mrs. Vincenz.
The team was entertained at lunch
eon, and each member was taken care
of by a Mills girl.
Stanford line-up was:
First base, Marie Hutton, '21. Cap
tain and second base, Ruth Chandler,
'19. Third base, Fannie Knox, '18.
Right field, Bernice Taylor, '21. Left
field, Elizabeth Gregory, '21. Center

Irma Weber, '19. Catcher Arietta
Klalin. graduate. Substitute, Iva
Hunter, '18. Pitcher, Helen Green
ing, '17.
