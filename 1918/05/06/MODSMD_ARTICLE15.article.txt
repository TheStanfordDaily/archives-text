# ONLY A LITTLE TROUBLE
## 
### 
Despite the fact that we all know time hangs heavily on the hands of
many of our men in the trenches and in training camps, carelessness and
thoughtlessness often prevents our doing the little things in our power to
relieve the situation.
Repeated requests have been made for magazines for men in the service,
yet we venture that in every fraternity and sorority house current magazines
may be found idly awaiting readers. One cent invested in a stamp will place
the magazines in the hands of those who hunger for news and reading matter.
It requires only a little trouble to keep in mind the numerous articles
that are being collected by the salvage committee." Tin or lead foil, waste
rubber, books, magazines, newspapers, woolen rags, tin boxes, glass fruit jars,
bottles of all kinds, men's shoes, and lead, brass, or aluminum waste are some
of the items to be saved, as listed by the salvage committee. These are articles
in common use every day. Each one could contribute some of them. Yet
we often carelessly throw them away, or pass them by. They mean nothing
to us, but through the national salvage work large amounts of money have
been raised for the Red Cross.
This matter of carelessness in little things strikes home at Stanford now.
Red Cross here has been halted in its work by insufficient funds to pro
vide material. This may not mean much to some of us, but when we realize
that a life somewhere may be lost for want of a bandage, and a bandage lack
ing because of insufficient funds, and no money because we did not save for
the salvage, little things assume larger proportions.
Each living group on the campus should take definite action toward or
ganized effort to help. Some one in each house should be made responsible
for collecting magazines and getting them sent to the proper authorities. He
should also make some provision for assembling the articles requested by
the salvage committee.
