# Houses Comply With Wheal Regulations
## H.C. Moreno Reports That Every Living Group Is Cooperating Well 
### 
Professor H. C. Moreno has just fin
ished his work in local food conser
vation, particularly with regard to
conserving wheat bread, among the
dififerent fraternities and eating clubs.
He has now spoken at nearly all of
the houses, and has either spoken or
written to every one on the campus.
He says,"The men have seemed to
be interested, and I believe that prac
tically all houses are now within the
four ounce maximum of wheat bread.
Many of them are doing even better
than this, and a few of them are ab
solutely wlieatless."
As a good example of the splendid
cooperation that he has received in
this patriotic work, he quotes a por
tion of a letter received from the Phi
Kappa Sigmas. It is as follows:
"You will be interested to know that
we have decided to cut out all foods
containing wheat in any degree.
This includes bread, pastry, macaroni
and such pastes, crackers, and all
else that we know of. We also still
observe th former regulations in re
gard to pork and sugar, as well as
fats." Professor Moreno says that
this letter is only a sample of the
splendid communications he has re
ceived from the various living groups.
