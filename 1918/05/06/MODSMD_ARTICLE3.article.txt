# Cub Reporters View Famous S.F. Landmarks

The embryo journalists of the Daily
Palo Alto staff are considerably en
lightened now as the result of a re
cent trip to San Francisco during
which the Examiner, the Chronicle,
and the Call and several other places
of interest in the wicked city were
viewed. The trip was made on Fri
day last but for several members of
the party it extended over Sunday.
Considerable interest was manifested
by many in the commodious quarters
where the Daily Free Lunch is Is
sued.
Upon their return the embryo re
porters registered great enthusiasm
over the results of the tripâ€”particul
arly in the inner workings of the
Daily Free Lunch. Many valuable
hints for young journalists were
gleaned in San Francisco which will
doubtless add variety and spice to the
columns of the Daily Palo Alto.
