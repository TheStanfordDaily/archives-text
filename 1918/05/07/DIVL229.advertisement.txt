"THE STYLE SHOP OF THE PENINSULA"
Making Business Better
I
Every business man who reads this knows that the one thing he wants for his business is to make it better; it ought to
be quite easy for you to understand how we feel about wanting to make our business better.
As we look at it, "better" business doesn't necessarily mean larger sales, tho that's the common idea. We believe that
sales do increase when a business gets better, but the sales are a result, not merely a measure, of the "better."
We have things to sell that men wear; we want to sell them, of course; we bought 'em to sell. But we'd a lot rather
have you come in because you want to buy these things, than to persuade you to come and buy because we want to sell
them.
We feel pretty sure that if we are careful enough about having the right qualities in our merchandise, and putting
prices on it that insure you good value for your money, and then tell you the truth about what we have, we'll find that
sales increase.
That's why we have so much to say about
Hart Schaffner & Marx Clothes
That's merchandise that represents our idea of the best we can do for you. The rest of our merchandise is as nearly
like that as we know how to get it.
