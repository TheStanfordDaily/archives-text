# FAIRCLOUGH TO SELECT EIGHT CANDIDATES FOR UNIT
## FIVE FROM CALIFORNIA Will Have to Pass Three Examinations to Make the Trip 
### 
The Italian ambulance unit which
waa last week declared closed, has
again been opened to some 7 or 8
Stanford men, according to a tele
gram received by Mr. Hooker, who is
at the head of the Red Cross work in
San Francisco. These men will join
the unit which will leave for service
on the Italian war front.
Professor H. R. Fairclough and Mr.
Hooker called a meeting yesterday at
4 o'clock of all those who had already
signed up, for the purpose of explain
ing the way in which the Stanford
representatives would be chosen, and
to tell more of th work that would be
expected of the men.
Committee to Choose
As nearly one hundred men signed
up for the unit, it is obvious that all
cannot go, and a committee of faculty
members was appointed to choose
the best 10 or 12 men. The men for
the unit will be selected under the
rules formerly announced, namely,
that the candidate must not be over
20 years and 3 months old, must not
be of German or Austrian parentage,
and must pass a rigid physical ex
amination, and finally must have a
lair knowledge of a "flivver's" in
sides. Those who were chosen by the
committee take their test in driving
and repairing Fords this afternoon,
and the best 8 will be chosen from
this number. All that remains then
for the 8 men to do is to pass a loy
alty test and to make application for
a passport. They will be informed by
telegraph as to further movements.
The men are required to serve six
months only, when they will be sent
back to the United States. The Red
Cross, however, reserves the right to
ship them back at any time during
the six months if it is felt that their
services are no longer needed. The
expenses of the unit will be paid by
the Red Cross Society, which will
furnish their railroad and steamer
fares there and back. Uniforms will
be given the men in New York. Italy
will furnish the subsistence. The
only expenses that the men will have
to meet, will be possibly their meals
while on the train and while waiting
in New York. No salary will be paid
them for their six months' work.
Owing to the fact that the meeting
called for those who signed up did
not take place until 4 o'clock this af
ternoon, the results of the Ford com
petition could not be printed, and the
names of the lucky 8 will be divulged
tomorrow.
The men chosen will be called early
next week and will have to entrain
immediately for New York. There
they will be met by the delegations
chosen from the Eastern colleges, and
then formed into one unit under an
Italian leader, after which they will
go directly to the front.

months only, when they will be sent
back to the United States. The Red
Cross, however, reserves the right to
ship them back at any time during
the six months if it is felt that their
services are no longer needed. The
expenses of the unit will be paid by
the Red Cross Society, which will
furnish their railroad and steamer
fares there and back. Uniforms will
be given the men in New York. Italy
will furnish the subsistence. The
only expenses that the men will have
to meet, will be possibly their meals
while on the train and while waiting
in New York. No salary will be paid
them for their six months' work.
Owing to the fact that the meeting
called for those who signed up did
not take place until 4 o'clock this af
ternoon, the results of the Ford com
petition could not be printed, and the
names of the lucky 8 will be divulged
tomorrow.
The men chosen will be called early
next week and will have to entrain
immediately for New York. There
they will be met by the delegations
chosen from the Eastern colleges, and
then formed into one unit under an
Italian leader, after which they will
go directly to the front.
The Italian ambulance unit which
waa last week declared closed, has
again been opened to some 7 or 8
Stanford men, according to a tele
gram received by Mr. Hooker, who is
at the head of the Red Cross work in
San Francisco. These men will join
the unit which will leave for service
on the Italian war front.
Professor H. R. Fairclough and Mr.
Hooker called a meeting yesterday at
4 o'clock of all those who had already
signed up, for the purpose of explain
ing the way in which the Stanford
representatives would be chosen, and
to tell more of th work that would be
expected of the men.
Committee to Choose
As nearly one hundred men signed
up for the unit, it is obvious that all
cannot go, and a committee of faculty
members was appointed to choose
the best 10 or 12 men. The men for
the unit will be selected under the
rules formerly announced, namely,
that the candidate must not be over
20 years and 3 months old, must not
be of German or Austrian parentage,
and must pass a rigid physical ex
amination, and finally must have a
lair knowledge of a "flivver's" in
sides. Those who were chosen by the
committee take their test in driving
and repairing Fords this afternoon,
and the best 8 will be chosen from
this number. All that remains then
for the 8 men to do is to pass a loy
alty test and to make application for
a passport. They will be informed by
telegraph as to further movements.
The men are required to serve six
months only, when they will be sent
back to the United States. The Red
Cross, however, reserves the right to
ship them back at any time during
the six months if it is felt that their
services are no longer needed. The
expenses of the unit will be paid by
the Red Cross Society, which will
