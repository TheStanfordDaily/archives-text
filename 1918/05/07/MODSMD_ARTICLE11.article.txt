# DR. HILLIS WILL THROW LIGHT ON GERMAN ATROCITIES
## TALKS TOMORROW NIGHT Is Accorded Great Success On Tour Through the Eastern States 
### 
A first-hand knowledge of the atroc
ities practiced by the Germans will be
given the people of this community
tomorrow night in the Assembly Hall
when Dr. Newell Dwight Hillis de
livers his lecture on "German Atroc
ities."
Coming from a man who saw with
his own eyes, the murder, arson, and
wanton destruction of human life and
property which is almost beyond the
compass of human mind to conceive,
this lecture will be one of the most
convincing arguments delivered here
against German war practices.
Dr. Hillis comes with the reputa
tion of being one of the greatest
preachers in the United States. He
has recently spoken in all the larger
cities of the east and on the Pacific
coast, and describes what he saw be
hind the lines, in the trenches, and out
in "No Man's Land" in such a way
that it is said entire audiences have
turned pale with horror. Dr. Hillis
saw the dead bodies of French and
Helgian soldiers which were mutilated
beyond recognition, and has collected
evidence of the many cases where en
tire towns of civilian population were
wiped out merely because they re
fused to aid the Kaiser's troops.
One million three hundred thousand
dollars for the Liberty Loan were sub
scribed in one night at the Lyric The
ater in Baltimore after a large audi
ence had heard this recital of the
bloody swath of the Hun through
France and Belgium.
Dr. Hillis will not stop with the
mere account of the deeds committed
at the Kaiser's command, but will go
into the explanation of the nature and
philosophy of these atrocities.
An admission of 25 and 50 cents will
be charged for the lecture. It is sched
uled to begin at 8 o'clock.
