# THE 						AXE FOR NON-ESSENTIAL ORGANIZATIONS
## 
### 
In conforming to the universal "cutting out of the non-essentials" move
ment, it is time for some Stanford activities to ge considering the axe. There
are a number of dead organizations on the campus that, though they fill a
want in ordinary times, have little place in student activities at this time.
Many of them are having their difficulties in the struggle for existence both
because of the lack of interest and the lack of men. Let there be a survival
of only the most useful.
There is also the proposition to consider of the lack of men to keep op
student body organizations. In the present scarcity of men in the University,
it is inevitable that the task will fall upon only a few. probably the same
ones for all organizations. Such duties always devolve upon a few leaders.
Though men are advised to remain in college as long as possible, the idea in
keeping them there is to fit them for service later. If all unimportant activi
ties continue, the subsequent drain on the time and energy of men active n
student body affairs which are not vital to the life of the student tody, is
unjustified. Each organization should consider well its purpose and efficiency
before continuing existence for the duration of the war.
