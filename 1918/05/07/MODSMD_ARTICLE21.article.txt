# Debut of Minute Girls Latest Campus Idea
## 
### 
"Four-minute girls" are the latest
innovation among the women in cam
pus war work and they will make
their debut Thursday evening.
Twelve workers have been chosen to
address the women of the campus on
some phase of food conservation just
after dinner at the respective living
groups.
These talks will take place every
two weeks, each time a different as
pect of the problem of food conserva
tion will be presented.
Miss Elizabeth Huneke, '20, is in
charge of this work as a member of
the food conservation committee.
