# German Motto . . Is not Used on. . Stanford Seal
## 
### 
No motto in German appears on the
seal of Stanford University, nor has
such a motto ever been officially
adopted by the University.
This explanation was made today
by the college authorities because
subtle German propagandists, appar
ently, have been circulating reports
that on the official seal of Stanford
appears a phrase in the German lan
guage. The thousands of men and
women who have received their de
grees at Stanford know, however, that
the impress of the University seal
upon their diplomas bears only a pine
tree, without any motto or inscription
of any kind, it was pointed out.
Unofficially, a motto in German has
sometimes been used at Stanford, but
Acting President C. D. Marx said to
day that it never was adopted by the
trustees, that it appears nowhere on
official University stationery or docu
ments, and that whatever use may
have been made of it at any time has
not received the sanction of the
Board of Trustees or of the Academic
Council of the faculty.
"Die Luff der Frefheit Weht,"
translated, "The Winds of Freedom
Blow," is the German motto in ques
tion.
