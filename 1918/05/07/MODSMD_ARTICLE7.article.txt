# SCHUMANN â€“ HEINK WILL SING AT SONG FESTIVAL
## 
### 
Madam Schumann-Heink, famous
singer and particularly luved by the
American public, has consented to
sing at the song festival, provided the
date for the festival is set over one
week to June 9, on account of a pre
vious engagement in New York on
June 2. Formal action will be taken
to this effect by the executive com
mittee of the camp social service com
mittee in conjunction with the consent
of the unit committee of the Univers
ity, this evening in Palo Alto.
Madame Schumann-Heink was very
enthusiastic over the plans for the
festival and was particularly anxious
to lend her services to the occasion.
This famous singer has two sons fight
ing in the present war for the Allies
and she herself has done much for the
soldiers throughout the United States,
singing at the cantonments.
Several advantages arise from the
postponement of the festival. The
military authorities are particularly
anxious to work up special maneuvers
lor the event, which only this extra
week will allow. Major General Mor
rison will be consulted as to the prob

ability of troop movements before this
date. More time will be given for the
community chorus work, which will
extend up and down the peninsula
from San Francisco to San Jose.
The most serious objection to a
later date was raised by the Univers
ity on account of final examinations
beginning June 11. J. E. McDowell
thought that the students would be
able to participate, however, in view
of the fact that there were so many
real advantages gained.
The definite work of the University
in this song festival was outlined at
a meeting called by Mr. McDowell
yesterday afternoon. Tickets, usher
ing, programs, and advertising, and
the decorating of the bleachers will
be taken over. Mr. McDowell has
also arranged with the Southern Pa
cific for special trains to and from San
Francisco on that date. The Uni
versity authorities will direct the
traffic and the parking of machines
as at previous big football games.
Miss Harriet Bradford, dean of
women, will be in charge of ushering,
which will be done by the women of
the University, and decorating. Dr.
E. H. Krehbiel, Professor L. E. Bas
uett ,and Miss Ellen Calhoun, *20, will
be on her committee.
H. W. Stebbins, chairman, H. C.
Moreno, and Mr, McDowell were put
in charge of obtaining blue prints of
the bleachers, the printing of the
tickets, and the placing of them for
sale.
