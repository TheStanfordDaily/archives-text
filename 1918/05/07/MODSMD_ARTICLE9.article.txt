# H.V.Aupperle Writes from Albania
## 
### 
A highly interesting war letter has
just been received from H. V. Aup
perle, ex-'l7, who has been on the
war front in the Balkans for the past
year.
The letter was written just after
Aupperle had completed a round trip
between Salonika and a seaport of
the Adriatic (the name of which the
censor had marked out), during which
he explained that he had a strenuous
time owing to the bad condition of
the roads, which were veritable
swamps. According to the letter he
expected to leave again in a few days
for another trip over the same route
in charge of a convoy of a fleet of
big Fiat trucks. Aupperle says that
he has had occasion to meet many
French, Serbian and English army
officers, and that he has formed the

most favorable impression of their
untiring valor.
In Charge of Prisoners
Some months ago Aupperle was put
in charge of a large number of Bul
garian prisoners, and he says that he
is still engaged in this work, and he
has had some most interesting ex
periences with th prisoners.
The latter part of the letter deals
with the Balkan situation. It says in
part:
"It is reported here that the Bul
garians are getting ready a couple of
Zeppelins to bomb Salonica with. It
is said that the Germans are not sat
isfied with the attitude of the Bulgars
now. They have already gained all
they set out for and are inclined to
rest on their oars. The Boches are
putting them up to bomb Salonica
and other Macedonian towns in the
hope that the Allies here will retali
ate by bombing Sofia and Bulgarian
cities. This would fan hatred and
induce the Bulgars to do more stren
uous work. The authorities have
posted very strict rules to be followed
in case of a night raid. Things have
been quiet on this front; but, with
spring coming on, everyone expects
action of some kind."
Aupperle closes his letter with a
statement that it is his belief that the
Allies will ultimately win, although
things may look more or less discour
aging at times.
