# FIFTY WOMEN SIGN TO WORK IN SANTA CLARA ORCHARDS
## MISS BRADFORD IS MUCH DISAPPOINTED Many Express Intentions of Doing Other Forms of Summer War-Work 
### 
Incomplete reports to the women's
agricultural unit committee allow that
fiifty Stanford women have definitely
pledged themselves for work in cut
ting and packing fruit in the Santa
Clara valley this summer.
This number is but half of the hun
dred expected to sign up. The com
mittee in charge states, however, that
this fact will not alter its plans.
Work in arranging the unit is to con
tinue as before.
Miss Harriet Bradford, who has been
much interested in the project from
the beginning, has made the follow
ing remarks in regard to it:
"Why was there such a small re
sponse from the '500' to the call for en
listment in the women's agricultural
unit? This lack of interest came to
me as a complete surprise.
"In colleges all over the United
States girls are not only willing but
eager to enlist their services to aid
in this way the work of food conser
vation. The College of Connecticut is
to begin its vacation at an earlier date
than usual this year in order that its
girls may be free to work in the fruit.
At Goucher College, Maryland, 107
out of a total of registration of only
400 girls, and at the University of Cali
fornia 400 girls have already signed
up for this work. What is the matter
with Stanford?
"Those who did sign up, however,
need not feel discouraged, for even a
small unit will be of service."
Many interesting facts were made
known by the agricultural unit com
mittee in regard to the plans of Stan
ford women for the coming summer.
Inquiries were made on the pledge
(,-ards which were distributed to the
women and the results obtained show
that many of them have definite plans.
Forty-two women intend to do agri
cultural work elsewhere, according to
the cards Sixty-four women intend
to go to summer school. Many of
these women indicated their intention
to do Red Cross work on the side.
