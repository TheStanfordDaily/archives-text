# NINETY ATTEND Y.W.C.A. SUPPER
## 
### 
About ninety women attended the
Y W. C. A. supper last night, which
took place in the Women's Club House.
The "cats" were served cafeteria style.
Miss .lulia Southwick, Y. W. C. A.
war work specialist on the coast, was
the speaker of the evening. The sub
ject of her address was "Democracy

of the Women on the Campus."
"Stanford has never thought that
girls were 'mere.' This University has
always recognized Lowell's defini
tion of democracy when he said:
" 'The keynote of democracy is not
that 1 am as good as you are, but that
you are as good as I am.'
"The Y. W. C. A. is the most demo
cratic body of women that there is.
The Y. W. C. A. workers in France
are a great proof of this. They are
in demand there because they are
willing to be good democrats," Miss
Southwick said.
An hour of informal dancing fol
lowed the supper and talk by Miss
Southwick.
At the regular Y. W. C. A. meeting
yesterday afternoon, Dr. N. E. Gordon,
a woman surgeon-missionary who has
been in India twenty years, was the
speaker. Dr. Gordon conducted a hos
pital in one of the central provinces.
"If the civilization of a country is
measured by the way it treats its
women, India is low in the social
scale," said Dr. Gordon. Indian cus
toms, traditions, and the present con
ditions were described vividly by her.

About ninety women attended the
Y W. C. A. supper last night, which
took place in the Women's Club House.
The "cats" were served cafeteria style.
Miss .lulia Southwick, Y. W. C. A.
war work specialist on the coast, was
the speaker of the evening. The sub
ject of her address was "Democracy

of the Women on the Campus."
"Stanford has never thought that
girls were 'mere.' This University has
always recognized Lowell's defini
tion of democracy when he said:
" 'The keynote of democracy is not
that 1 am as good as you are, but that
you are as good as I am.'
"The Y. W. C. A. is the most demo
cratic body of women that there is.
The Y. W. C. A. workers in France
are a great proof of this. They are
in demand there because they are
willing to be good democrats," Miss
Southwick said.
An hour of informal dancing fol
lowed the supper and talk by Miss
Southwick.
At the regular Y. W. C. A. meeting
yesterday afternoon, Dr. N. E. Gordon,
a woman surgeon-missionary who has
been in India twenty years, was the
speaker. Dr. Gordon conducted a hos
pital in one of the central provinces.
"If the civilization of a country is
measured by the way it treats its
women, India is low in the social
scale," said Dr. Gordon. Indian cus
toms, traditions, and the present con
ditions were described vividly by her.
