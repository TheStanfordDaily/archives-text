# EIGHT MEN TO BE SENT TO ITALY IN AMBULANCE UNIT
## TO LEAVE SOON FOR SIX MONTHS' SERVICE Chosen After Examination of Character and Previous Records 
### 
Eight men have been recommended
by Professor H. R. Fairclough for the
Italian ambulance unit, which leaves
this country shortly for six months'
service in Italy. The men were
chosen by Professor Fairclough after
a thorough examination had been
made into their characters and rec
ords, although a great deal of difficulty
was experienced in making the choice.
The men who will leave for New
York in a few days are H. H. Darling,
Jr., '21, C. W. Doe, Jr., '20, H. F. Gould,
'21, E. B. Harper, '20, H .H. Harris,
'21, S. J. Pillsbury, '20, and F. N.
Thomas, Jr., '20.
Professor Fairclough has asked the
Red Cross to take more men and if a
favorable decision is received, the fol
lowing alternatives will be given an
opportunity to enlist: C. A. Bridgers,
'20, W. A. Ferris, '21, E. P. Filley, '21,
P. B. Gallegos, '20, A. C. Hawley, '21,
L. L. Pickering, '20, J. A. Sparks, '20,
W. M. Stamp, '20, R. R. Varnum, '21,
and G. H. Whitney, '20.
The selection of the eight men was
made with the aid of R. J. Hooker,
head of the-personnel bureau of the
Red Cross in San Francisco. The men
were asked to bring letters of recom
mendation and on the basis of these,
and an examination into their records,
the Stanford representation was
chosen. It was found especially hard
to draw a distinction between the can
didates.
The men chosen for the unit left
for San Francisco this afternoon,
where they received a medical exam
ination. Their names were sent by
wire to New York, and it is expected
that they will receive orders to report
in a few days.
Recruiting for the unit has been in
the hands of Professor Fairclough,
who was placed in charge by the San
Francisco office of the Red Cross. He
has been assisted by Assistant Regis
trar J. E. McDowell.
