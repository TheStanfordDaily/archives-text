"What is the matter with the Stanford women?" is the question asked as
the more or less disappointing results of the campaign for women agricul
tural workers are announced.
When conditions are examined, it is found that it is not an unwillingness
on the part of the women to do war work in any form that accounts for the
small number enlisted in this cause. There was a large hurst of enthusiasm
for work in the orchards when the plan was first broached. Practically every
woman not engaged in other necessary activity expressed her desire to help.
When definite plans were made unforeseen difficulties arose. The time for
work in the fruit is in July and August. This quarter ends July 13, and
more than two weeks will intervene before &ork can begin. This means that
women who live in the northern and southern parts of the state who intend
to go home during vacation will either have to go home and come back to
work or have to wait around here for something to do. Many women intended
to come back to college a month earlier to work before registering. This,
too, is impossible, fot there will be no agricultural work in the month of
September.
Hence a great loss of time and money is entailed for all Stanford women
whose homes are not in this vicinity. Those who are fortunate enough to live
in the Santa Clara valley can easily give their services to the work. If ar
rangements could be made for the women to do other essential war work
for the time intervening between the close of this semester and the beginning
of fruti cutting undoubtedly more women would consider remaining. Too,
as matters now stand, barely a living wage will be paid the workers. While
most college women are willing to do work essential to the vigorous prosecu
tion of the war for just .expenses, they are unwilling to ask their families to
support them during a period of idleness either before or after war work.
Of the women who did not enroll for agricultural work a large number
have arranged to do other war work at their homes, or are engaged in other
activities. Taking all things into consideration, we do not feel that Stanford
women are lacking in the spirit that is being shown by college women all over
the country at this time.
