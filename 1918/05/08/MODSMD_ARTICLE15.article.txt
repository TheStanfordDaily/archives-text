What dye mean moonlight at the
sophomore jolly-up?
Will they really turn out the lights,
or is it just an advertising stunt?
SHOOTS
Maybe the sophs are trying to make
up for the import dance disappoint
ment.
Tomorrow Chaparral will be out.
At large, is a better term, we should
say.
SHOOTS
We admit it, being editor and an
ornery Hammer and Coffin at the
same time is some job.
Wish I could pass my Xb like my
roommate can pas√ü 'em in his letters
to the home town.
SHOOTS
When you attend one those campus
scuds, why not acertain which one of
your partner's feet is cultivated, and
aid Hoover by conserving corn?
An envelope a day,
Will bring an A,
In accounting.
