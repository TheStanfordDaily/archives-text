### 
Professor W. F. Durand, who has
been located in Paris for the last few
months engaged in work for the In
ternational Dynamic Aeroplano Com
mission, says in his most recent letter
that he will lie unable to return to
the I'nlted States as soon as he had
planned. Some new phases of the
work have proved to he particularly
difficult and will delay his return
until some time near the first part of
August.
