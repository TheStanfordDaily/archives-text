# Crab Chappie to Crawl on Campus
## 
### 
Crabbing from cover to editorial and
everywhere except the ads, the May
edition of Chaparral, which has been
appropriately christened by the ed
itor as the "Crab Issue," will crawl
upon the campus tomorrow. Chappie
has been silent for a time, the over
seas edition having been its last ap
pearance, but is destined to make up
for lost time by an excess of crab
bing and crab-inciting parts in its
rejuvenation tomorrow.
Color in abundance, pink, green,
white, and black, arranged in discord
ant disarray will be the artistic sot
ting for the official crab that Georgo
Kocher, '19, shows on the cover. To
lend incentive to the crabbing due to
accompany the issue, M. R. Oliver,
'15, has contributed an artistic girl's
head to act as frontispiece. W. E.
Antrim. '19, who never fails to amuse,
has the appropriate 'Crab Salad," two
pages of cartoons said to contain a
great deal of meat. Miss Dorothy
Plummer, '19, and Miss Ruth Taylor,
'19, have other art features in this
Issue.
M. L. Levy, '19, who seems to have
a rare understanding and appreciation
of the beast, writes of a mule in a
characteristic war time setting. Lan
sing Warren, '17 ,and B. C. Wohlford,
'18, write from France in their usual
taking style. Even in war times the
editor emeritus and the editor-elect
demonstrate themselves as adepts at
wielding humor.
Charles Thompson, '05, a former
Chaparral man, has revived his poetic
and humorous sense and has contrib
uted a feature poem which appears
in the "Crab Issue."
11. W. Sewall, ex-'2O, shows himself
a rare imitator (or maybe originator)
of the service type of verse. Sewall
is now over in France with Base Hos
pital 30.
