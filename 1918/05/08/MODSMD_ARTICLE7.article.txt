# De Kalb Tells of German Scourge To Civilization
## 
### 
Speaking of the world war from an
economic standpoint, Courtenay De
Kalb, well known scientific writer of
San Francisco, addressed a fair-sized
audience in the Little Theater last
night.
De Kalb spoke of Germany as the
scourge of civilization for the past
2300 years, her policy for peace being
the conquest and subjection of the en
tire world.
"The German," said the speaker, "is
the adaptor of other men's ideas. The
German brain is not creative. The
Teuton has picked up and further de
veloped the genius of others.
"When the Kaiser said that God
was on his side, his celestial telephone
must have been out of order."
In discussing the problems that
would arise at an international peace
meeting, De Kalb said: "It will be
hard to come to a successful settle
ment. The French have a tendency
toward individualism; the Teutons
have fostered a collective
the British are the truest co-operators
of the world; while the Americans are
always looking forward to titanic eco
nomic enterprises.
"The stress of economic inequalities
exists today in the laws, customs, and
geographic conditions of the belliger
ents."
The speaker is in favor of free
trade, even though, in his estimation,
it would proportionately cripple some
of the nations. He is in sympathy
with a natural trade policy, although
expressing fear in regard to the im
portation of cheap foreign labor after
the war.
"A clearly established natural trade
policy would give the nations the
blessings of democracy," he said. De
Kalb believes that the allied forces
should turn a deaf ear to any form of
compromise with the tools of impe
rialism. Not until commercial diffi
culties are settled for all time does he
think that the allied dream of free
dom will be fulfilled.
