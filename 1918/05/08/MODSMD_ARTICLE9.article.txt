# 1918 to Decide on Senior Week
## 
### 
Whether or not the 1018 class will
hold a senior week will he decided at
a special meeting of the class tomor
row. The Senior Week Committee
met today at noon and decided to

leave the question of keeping up the
usual graduating festivities to the
whole class. Present prospects are
that at least the usual senior hall will
be discontinued unless the class mani
fests a strong sentiment to the con
trary.
Finances and lack of interest on the
part of the remaining members are
the chief difficulties which the offi
cers and committee of the graduating
class have to contend with. The
amount of the class dues and arrange
ments for laying the 1918 plate are
to be discussed and decided tomor
row. Unless the class as a whole
shows more interest than it has in
the past it is probable that the whole
senior week will have to be abolished,
officers said today.
There are about eighty eighteeners
left at Stanford and President C. S.
and other officers say that if
the class gives proper support, some
sort of a senior week can be held.
The amount of this support will be to
a large extent determined by the turn
out to the class meeting tomorrow.
The meeting will be in Room 214,
and will begin at 1:15 sharp.
