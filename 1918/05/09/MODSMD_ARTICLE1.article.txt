# MARY THERKELSEN IS MADE HEAD OF SENIOR CLASS
## C.S. KEGLEY TO LEAVE NEXT WEEK Senior Week Festivities To Be Curtailedâ€”No 1918 Ball 
### 
For the first time in many years a
Stanford class is to have a woman
president. Miss Mary Therkelsen, now
1918 vice president, will act as presi
dent of the graduating class when
President C. S. Kegley leaves next
week, according to action taken by
the class at its meeting this after
noon. At the same time Miss Ger
aldine Cluff was elected class treas
urer to act for the remainder of the
term.
Senior Week festivities will all be
held on June 7, and will be greatly
curtailed. There will, be no Senior
Ball, and no programs nor invitations
will be printed. Class dues were set
at $1.50, and the class recommended
that the payment of the dues be made
a prerequisite for graduation.
An All-University jolly-up will be
held at some date to bo decided upon
later. It is possible that the Eighteen
ers may combine with another class
to make this event a greater success.
Every effort will be made to keep up
the institutions of the Senior plate and
the Senior tree.
The meeting today was sparsely at
tended, only about thirteen members
being present. A meeting will be held
Monday at 12:50 p.m., at which time
Assistant Registrar J. E. McDowell
will speak to the class.
