# Y.M.C.A. MEN GATHER AT ANNUAL BANQUET
## 
### 
The annual meeting of the entire
membership of the local Y. M. C. A.
was held last night, as scheduled, at
the Stanford Inn, between 6:15 and 8
o'clock. The meeting from various
standpoints was highly successful, al
though the attendance was only fair.
This was due partly, however, to the
fact, that as military operations took
place yesterday afternoon, many of
the men were too tired to attend.
Addresses were made by Professors
A. M. Cathcart. R. L. Green, and R. E.
Swain. All the speeches were very
optimistic as to the future of the Y.
M. C. A. work, expressing the idea
that the work should be intensified
and reconstructed during the period
of the war. It was also pointed out
that much depends on efforts of the
underclassmen along these lines, in
asmuch as the older men have left for
service at the hands of the govern
ment.
Edwin Pann, '19, financial secretary
of the association, rendered a report
on the condition of the money side of
affairs. His report evidenced the fact
that the organization was never in a
better financial condition than at the
present time. Other business trans
acted at this time was the re-election
of A. E. Worthy, '15, as secretary of
the association for the coming year.
The cabinet elections are expected to
he completed in about a week, the
names of several men now being un
der consideration.
