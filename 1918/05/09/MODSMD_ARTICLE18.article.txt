# CONSIDER THE SPEAKER

### 
Considerable inconvenience and confusion resulted last night from lack
of arrangements for selling tickets to the crowds who thronged to hear Dr.
Hillis. To be sure, tickets could have been secured beforehand, but for a
speaker so widely advertised and so well known as is Dr. Hillis, it might
have been anticipated that there would be a need for increased facilities for
selling tickets at the Assembly Hall. One small window is not sufficient to
handle a large crowd in an orderly and efficient manner.
Such conditions result in embarrassment and annoyance to the speaker,
when the audience is forced to come in late. It is hardly the courteous act
to our speaking guests to subject them to such annoyance. Last night was
not the first time that such disorder prevailed. Cannot something be done to
prevent its recurrence in the future?
