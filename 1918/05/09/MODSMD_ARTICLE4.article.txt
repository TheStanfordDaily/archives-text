# 1920 to Come Into Limelight in Moonlight Program For Their Quarterly Jolly-Up
## 
### 
When John Milton wrote those
memorable words, "Come and trip it
as you go, on the light fantastic toe,"
little did the blind poet realize what
an inspiration these few words would
bear to the younger generations that
were to follow. In view of the fact
that America is in the vortex of a
great struggle, Stanford will have a
little struggle all its own tomorrow
night, when the Sophomore Class flings
their jolly-up in Encina Ilall.
Of course the limelight feature of
the jolly-up will be the moonlight
dances. The committee in charge has
worked diligently on this feature, and
they promise to have all the lights
turned out, except a wee moon way
up near the ceiling.
Don't think that the moonlight
dances contribute the only attraction,
for taxis will be permissible. Every
man will have all the opportunity in
the world to get in the big raffle be
tween dances and win a Quad for his
lady. Try as he may, the D. P. A.
man could get no information in re
gard to the refreshments. All that
leaked out was that there would be
no punch served. There are several
other surprises in store for those who
are on hand to enjoy the melodious
strains of McNamee's orchestra, but
the dance committee would give away
no other secrets concerning the gala
affair.
Festivities will start early.
