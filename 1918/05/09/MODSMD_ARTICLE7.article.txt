# HUN ATROCITIES PLANNED IN ADVANCE, SAYS HILLIS

### 
"Germany's hopes at the beginning
of this war were to break down the
nerves of their enemies at the front
by organized atrocities in the rear,"
said Dr. Newell Dwight Hillis in his
lecture at the Assembly Hall last
night on "German Atrocities."
"Out of the operation of this policy
has emerged a Germany, enriched by
the loot of captured countries, stained
with the blood of murdered women
and children, and damned by the arson
and destruction wrought in France.
The Frenchman has lost the fear of
death and won immortality."
Explains German Policy
Dr. Hillis explained the theory of
the atrocities committed by Germany
and showed that they were not the re
sult of action by a few drunken or
impassioned men, but were conducted
in an organized manner and were part
of an organized attempt to break down
the nerves and fighting spirit, of their
enemies by committing atrocities, too
horrible to speak of, on their families
in the rear.
"The crumbling of the Belgian, and
Polish, and Roumanian armies was
due more to these atrocities than to
any other factor. Men can't fight
when they know their wives and chil
dren are being murdered or wronged
by German officers.
Praises American Soldiers
"Reports to the effect that the Amer
ican soldiers would commit the same

acts if they were given a chance are
damnable lies," Dr. Hillis declared.
During all the time I was in France
I didn't see a single American soldier
under the influence of liquor. Men
only commit such atrocities when out
of their right minds, or as in the case
of the Germans, when they have been
taught and trained to commit such
acts. German soldiers are taught to
guard themselves against any acts of
humanitarism.
"What ideals the Germans have
tried to tear down in this war, the
British, French, and American boys
are laboring to restore. I have seen
French soldiers come out of the
trenches after twenty-four hours of
continual fighting, caked with mud,
covered with vermin, with a divine
light on their features. They are not
men, but gods."
The atrocities and destruction
wrought on the fertile country of
northern France and Belgium were al
most as bad as those committed on
the people of those countries, Dr.
Hillis explained. Every bit of prop
erty that it was possible to destroy
was demolished by the retreating Ger
man armies.
"Germany deliberately planned this
war to secure the iron mines in north
ern France. Other wars have been
fought for gold, and land, and timber,
but this is a war of iron. If we lose
