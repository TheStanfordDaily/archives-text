# SAN FRANCISCO ALUMNI START CAMPAIGN FOR UNIT
## 
### 
San Francisco launched its cam
paign i'or raising $8,000 for the Stan
ford Women's Relief Unit by pledging
$2,829 at a meeting held at the St.
Francis Hotel lost night. Sergeant
White of the Canadian forces, who
was gassed and wounded at the front,
was a feature of the evening's pro
gram. Miss Edith Mirrielees, '07, and
Miss Dorothy Egbert, '16, spolce as
members of the unit. Frank English,
'99, represented the alumni, Walter
Malm presented stereopticon slides of
the First Stanford Ambulance Unit
in France of which he was a mem
ber, and C. K. Field, '95, presided
with his usual marked ability. J. E.
McDowell, '00, as last speaker on the
program presented the financial ap
peal.
Two to three hundred Stanford
alumni attended the meeting and the
Stanford spirit which marks every
alumni reunion was particularly no
ticeable in the informal reception held
before and after the meeting.
Sergeant White described with
great vividness the scenes of utter

desolation which were common in the
northern part of France. He ex
plained that the real need for Ameri
can women in France came because
of their ability to organize.
"We have plenty of time volunteers
for civilian relief," said White, "but
our volunteers not only have no or
ganization but have no capacity for
organization. You Americans have
no conception of the infinite amount
of good that will come under organ
ized conditions, after your -women
have worked in France." In speak
ing of the German atrocities in
France Sergeant White said, "It is a
common enough sight to see the Bel
gian children with their hands cut
off. either one or both. Often I have
stopped and torn my shirt to bind
their wounds."
In conclusion. Sergeant White de
scribed an air raid in London last
July where over 2000 casualties re
sulted.
Mr. English spoke of the signifi
cance of the Stanford Women's Unit
being organized under the direct aus
pices of the American Red ross.
"Stanford members of the faculty
and the University student body have
sensed the right thing to do," said Mr.
English, "and we of the alumni must
back them. If our American Expe
ditionary force can afford to dig down
Into their pockets lor the orphans of
France, the little we can do is paltry
enough."
Further campaign work will be car
ried on immediately among the alum
ni who were not present as well as
the other friends of the University.
Tho Unit work in San Francisco has
been taken up by the Stanford War
Work committee which was formed a
short time ago as a part of the work
they have pleged themselves to do
during the war such as active work in
Liberty bond campaigns, Red Cross
drives and such work not directly con
nected with the campus.
