# TENNIS STARS BATTLE TOMORROW
## 
### 
Since the preliminaries have been
completed by the four classes in the
interclass tennis tournament, the jun
iors and freshmen will contend for
class supremacy in both the singles
and doubles departments of the game
on the Encina courts at 9 Saturday
morning.
In the earlier rounds of the tourna
ment both the freshman racket wield
rs and the nineteeners displayed
uood tennis, winning every match
from their opponents. In the lower
half of the schedule it was unneces
sary for Lounsberry Fish, *21, to cross
rackets with D. N. Barry, '20. for the
freshmen had already annexed two
matches, thus making the third un
necessary.
As the freshmen eliminated the
sophomores, who were slated as the

favorites at the beginning of the
tourney, they loom up as the prob
able winners over the juniors. How
ever, a prediction of the winner in to
morrow's tournament is mostly guess
work, for W. C. Bent. '19, and
C. O. Crosby, '19, in the doubles are a
steady, consistent team, while Bent
and G. C. Thomas, '19. appear as
strong contenders in the singles. Rent,
especially, has showed good form and
seems the best bet for the upperclass
men. The freshman team will line up
with Fish and F. S. Turner, '21, in
singles and P. B. Kinney, '21, and Tur
ner in the doubles.
If a high wind blows tomorrow
; morning such as prevailed in the
1 matches last week, play will be
played Sunday or postponed until the
middle of the week.
