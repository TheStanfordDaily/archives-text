# DAILY CHANGES NECESSARY NOW
## 
### 
With only a short time remaining before the end of this quarter, it is
highly important to bring to notice a few of the changes in the student body
constitution that must be made in regard to the Daily Palo Alto. Time is
pressing, and further delay in bringing the matter before the student body is
inexcusable. A committee of one "was appointed by the executive committee
to draw up the amendments the first part of the quarter, but sine the com
mittee was called into service, no arrangements have been made for the work'
to be continued.
In the first place, the war has made such inroads into the staff of the
Daily that the present constitutional provision for three editors a year, or one
a quarter, is impractical, and wellnigh impossible. It simply means that
editors for the next year will have to be drawn from the sophomore class
and if the war continues more than a year, possibly from the freshman class.
Under such conditions obviously a paper could not be published. Aside from
the fact that a sophomore, and in ordinary times a junior, has not sufficient
background to edit the Daily, there remains the great difficulty that in using
underclassmen for editors men are too quickly pushed up to the top and are
lost to the paper. At this time this is the great drawback, for it will require
the continuous efforts of every person on the staff to put out a live paper
under war conditions. For these reasons it is highly essential that a change
to two editors a year be made now, for the matter should not bang fire until
next quarter.
In addition to the two-editor plan, we recommend that the Daily Palo Alto
next year be placed on sale exclusive of student body tickets. Under the
present financial conditions it will be difficult enough for the paper to main
tain itself without the additional burden of the student body ticket. With no
athletic contests, besides the privilege of voting and holding office, the Daily
Palo Alto is the only inducement to buy student body tickets. We believe Die
circulation of the paper would be increased were it sold independent of stu
dent body tickets. A constitutional change is not necessary to effect this,
since the terms of subscription are regulated by the editor, the business direc
tor, and the graduate, manager.
In addition, we believe a staff election of the editor to be the only fair
way to decide who shall direct the paper. Students not connected with the
paper in any way are not vitally Interested in its welfare, and are unacquaint
ed with the conditions surrounding its publication. The merits of candidates,
too, are unknown to the student body in general. Why should they choose
the editor 9 The staff members who have worked with candidates are the
ones to judge. This move would remove the position of editor from the un
healthy atmosphere of politics with which it has been surrounded in the last
few elections. It has been demonstrated that the merit system is the only one
bv which the Daily may be successfully run. Unless competition for high
nlaces on the staff can be maintained by working for the editorship, there
would be little inducement for men to come out for the paper and putin two
or three or four years of hard work. Such a spirit of co-operation for the
good of the Daily exists among the staff members that there is reason to
believe no difficulties would arise i'rora within with staff election of the edi or.

since the terms of subscription are regulated by the editor, the business direc
tor, and the graduate, manager.
In addition, we believe a staff election of the editor to be the only fair
way to decide who shall direct the paper. Students not connected with the
paper in any way are not vitally Interested in its welfare, and are unacquaint
ed with the conditions surrounding its publication. The merits of candidates,
too, are unknown to the student body in general. Why should they choose
the editor 9 The staff members who have worked with candidates are the
ones to judge. This move would remove the position of editor from the un
healthy atmosphere of politics with which it has been surrounded in the last
few elections. It has been demonstrated that the merit system is the only one
bv which the Daily may be successfully run. Unless competition for high
nlaces on the staff can be maintained by working for the editorship, there
would be little inducement for men to come out for the paper and putin two
or three or four years of hard work. Such a spirit of co-operation for the
good of the Daily exists among the staff members that there is reason to
believe no difficulties would arise i'rora within with staff election of the edi or.
With only a short time remaining before the end of this quarter, it is
highly important to bring to notice a few of the changes in the student body
constitution that must be made in regard to the Daily Palo Alto. Time is
pressing, and further delay in bringing the matter before the student body is
inexcusable. A committee of one "was appointed by the executive committee
to draw up the amendments the first part of the quarter, but sine the com
mittee was called into service, no arrangements have been made for the work'
to be continued.
In the first place, the war has made such inroads into the staff of the
Daily that the present constitutional provision for three editors a year, or one
a quarter, is impractical, and wellnigh impossible. It simply means that
editors for the next year will have to be drawn from the sophomore class
and if the war continues more than a year, possibly from the freshman class.
Under such conditions obviously a paper could not be published. Aside from
the fact that a sophomore, and in ordinary times a junior, has not sufficient
background to edit the Daily, there remains the great difficulty that in using
underclassmen for editors men are too quickly pushed up to the top and are
lost to the paper. At this time this is the great drawback, for it will require
the continuous efforts of every person on the staff to put out a live paper
under war conditions. For these reasons it is highly essential that a change
to two editors a year be made now, for the matter should not bang fire until
next quarter.
In addition to the two-editor plan, we recommend that the Daily Palo Alto
next year be placed on sale exclusive of student body tickets. Under the
present financial conditions it will be difficult enough for the paper to main
tain itself without the additional burden of the student body ticket. With no
athletic contests, besides the privilege of voting and holding office, the Daily
Palo Alto is the only inducement to buy student body tickets. We believe Die
circulation of the paper would be increased were it sold independent of stu
dent body tickets. A constitutional change is not necessary to effect this,
since the terms of subscription are regulated by the editor, the business direc
tor, and the graduate, manager.
