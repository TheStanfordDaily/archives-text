# STANFORD CLINIC TO GIVE CHILDREN SUMMER VACATION
## RESPONSE TO CALL FOR AID IS HEARTY Funds Are To Be Devoted to Care of Needy Ones at Lane Hospital 
### 
In response to a call to the friends
of Stanford to aid in carrying on the
work of the children's clinic at Lane
Hospital, San Francisco, 800 of the
desired 1000 dollars has been sub
scribed. The money is needed to take
care of the expenses of a vacation
planned for the children for this sum
mer.
The clinic last year was able to
raise $1650 to take care of ninety-two
children who were sent to the isola
tion hospital, but as the committee
has been unable to secure the hospital
for this summer they have curtailed
their expenses and are expecting to
give the children the best vacation
possible from the general fund.
The Itev. 1). C. Gardner is in charge
of the plans for the recreation for
convalescent children who are in need
of some chance for relaxation this
summer. lie says that the extent of
the work and the number of children
which will be taken care of will be
limited only by the amount of money
which is raised. He hopes to have the
required amount subscribed soon.
Free help is dispensed to the pa
tients who come to the Lane clinic
to ask for aid. Eight hundred and
twenty-two cases were cared for by
the children's department last month,
and applications for help are continu
ally being handed in. Miss Katherine
Harnett, who is secretary of the so
cial service department of clinic work,
says that the greatest need of the
department is clothing, and suggests
that donations of odds and ends of
new material that could be used for
children would be a help.
