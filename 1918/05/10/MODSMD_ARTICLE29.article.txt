# PLENTY OF WORK FOR STANFORD STUDENTS
## 
### 
So far as known this year, no Stan-
Lord student lias liad to return ho me
for lack of work. In fact, there have
been more jobs than students. The
V. M. C. A. has helped 125 men this
year to work either a part or all of
their way through college. In the an
nual Y. M. C. A. report it is noticed
that over 200 jobs, either temporary
or permanent, have been secured for
students. This is far the best record
that the Y. M. C. A. has ever been
able to report. Undoubtedly the
smaller number of men, and the
greater need for help due to the war,
had something to do with this un
usual record, but it nevertheless
shows, according to Y. M. C. A. lead
ers, that there is exceptional oppor
tunity at Stanford for a student to
pay his way through.
