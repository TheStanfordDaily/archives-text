# DISCIPLINE IS GREAT NEED OF AMERICA SAYS TURPIN
## TELLS OWN EXPERIENCES French Lieutenant Offers Views of United States' Part in the War 
### 
"The one thing that the Americans
need is discipline. A nation's
strength lies in its army and the
strength of that army in discipline.
You have got to learn to do what the
French people did —civilians and sol
diers —when Paris was threatened by
the Germans —to obey without ques
tion. War is no time for discussion;" j
declared Lieutenant Turpin of the
French army in a stirring and inter
esting address at a University as
sembly yesterday afternoon.
Modestly disclaiming the claims of
distinction as a musician and author
that have been showered on him by 1
the press, and asserting that he had
only been "over the top" twenty-one
times, and speaking unaffectedly of
his thirty-seven months in the
trenches, Lieutenant Turpin held the
interest of a large audience with his
stories of the front. His talk ranged
from Serbian atrocities to the ridicul
ous incidents of humor of the j
trenches.
"Everything in life can be com
pared to a mathematical problem—
there is a given quantity, a solution,
and a result. The given quantity in
the war is our duty to make the
world a more pleasant place to live
in, to destroy militarism and to win
the war. The result is—victory.
What the solution is, we must find
out.
"At the Peace Conference at The
Hague in lt>o7, representatives of Aus
tria and Germany signed a treaty for
bidding the use of explosive bullets
which make ghastly wounds. But
Germany ignored this 'scrap of paper,'
as she has others, and began using
explosive bullets. It was an officers'
secret and they kept it well but we
have the testimony of privates who
have asserted that machine guns were
maintained in which only the terrible
explosive bullets were used.
"At the same Peace Conference,
the representatives of Austria and
Germany signed a pledge which prom
ised in the event of war that all precau
tions would be taken to preserve the
safety of places of religious worship,
those devoted to the arts and sciences
and all hospitals and institutions of
refuge. But look what they did to
Rheims! As the German conquerors
entered the villages, they were all
equipped with inflammable liquid with
which they sprayed the buildings and
set them 011 fire.
"When the Austrian troops crossed
the borders of Serbia, they received
orders to leave nothing alive, and,
what was worse, not to spend their
cartridges in killing but to use any
other means of dealing death. The
Serbian atrocities were not only prac
tised on the prisoners of war but we
have many records of undeniable
proof of atrocities committed against
the civilian population.
"The Germans are trying with every
conceivable method to break the mo
rale of our armies. Their long range
guns, which have been bombarding

Paris, are only political guns to
break the French spirit and give
them an opportunity tu ask tor peace.
But what have they gained? Wo
men and children killed, but the mo
rale of the French unbroken, for
French women and children know
how to die for their country.
"The German is brave only when
lie can't be something else. A Ger
man, alone, is a coward. We have
seen this in the compact formations
in which they launch their offensives
—officers at the rear armed to kill at
the first indication of faltering.
Many times have I found men chained
to their machine guns—that is how
the Germans have to enforce disci
pline."
After a number of amusing inci
dents of the front in some of which
he himself took part, Lieutenant Tur
pin concluded with a stirring appeal
to America to "Hurry up!"
"Americans, you wust not do your
'bit' now," he said, "the time has
come for every one of you to do your
BEST. You must spent more money
for Liberty bonds and you must en
dure more privations than you are
now. And you girls and women,
write to the men who are fighting for
you. A letter from home means
more than anything in the world
'over there'."
Professor O. M. Johnston of the
French department presided at yes
terday's assembly, which was one of
the most intensely interesting of all
of the war information talks delivered
here this quarter.
