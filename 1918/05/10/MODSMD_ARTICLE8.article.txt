contain over thirty names.
Many of the successful candidates

from men in Eastern camps, and rep
ressing all branches of the service.
A few of the names are those of men
that failed in former camps.
All of the candidates are required
to enlist as privates for the duration

the training school goes with it, the
candidates serving as privates.
When the destination is reached, the
