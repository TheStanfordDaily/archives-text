# 'MORALE ESSENTIAL'--PIERCE
## 
### 
"We cannot fail to win the war,"
said the Rev. U. G. B. Pierce in his
lecture on "Faith and the War" last
night in the Little Theater, "if we
retain the right attitude of mind and
have the right morale back of our
men.
"The outcome of the war depends
not only on the spirit of the fighting
men but also on their backing. It
behooves us to keep our wits and
cling to a well balanced point of view
to sustain their courage, hope and
strength.
"The evolution of the nation's hopes
may be traced In war posters. We

have placed our hopes successively
ou munitions, men, and food, but
none are of any avail without faith
behind them.
"There are three great principles
which constitute morale: Implicit
faith in the integrity of the ethical
process, abiding conviction of the im
mortality of the soul, and reliance on
the church. Adherence to these will
produce the spirit that will defeat the
Kaiser and militarism."
Dr. Pierce will take the pulpit In
Memorial Church next Sunday morn
ing in what will be his last appear
ance before leaving for the East.
