### 
Nickel dancing at the Kappa and
Delta Gamma houses for the benefit
of the campus Red Cross is the event
planned for Friday evening, May 17,
by the women of the University. For
those who prefer to play cards the
Chi Omega house will entertain with
tables for bridge.
Representatives from each woman's
living group on the campus are mak
ing plans for the affair under the di
rection of a committee composed of
Mary Therkelsen, '18, Jean Campbell,
'18, Estelle Nisson, '18, Lecile Jones,
'18, Bob Shelton, '18, Ruth Taylor,
*19, Elsie Wingood, gr., Ruth Searcy.
'20, Helen Mosher, '21, and Lucy Lang
don, '19.
Miss Estelle Nisson will be in charge
of the card party and Miss Lucy Lang
don is arranging for posters and pub
licity.
The best campus orchestras have
been engaged for the dance. Women
from each living group will be at the
houses open for dancing during the
evening to furnish partners for the
non-queeners.
Since the recent increase in work
ers at the Red Cross rooms funds are
badly needed by the campus organiza
tions with which to buy supplies for
the bandage workers.
