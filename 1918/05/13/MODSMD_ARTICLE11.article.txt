# 1921 Wins Doubles Tennis Title
## 
### 
Class, seed, and brilliant plays fea
tured the match for supremacy in the
doubles in the interclass tennis tour
nament which was won by the fresh
man team on the Encina courts Sat
urday in two sets, 7-5, 6-1.
A great deal of credit is due the
freshman aggregation, for they have
displayed real tennis since the first
round of the tournament.
By defeating VV. C. Bent and G. C.
Thomas, the junior doubles team, P. B.
Kinney, '21, and F. S. Turner, '21,
claim the championship doubles com
bination of the University. The first
set of the match was bitterly con
tested, while the second was short
ened by the phenomenal playing of
Turner, who displayed the best ten
nis seen on the courts this year.
Kinney's serve and net play was also

a feature, and his support to Turner
in returning was largely responsible
for the freshman victory.
Bent was the stellar performer for
the juniors. Tnme and again he
passed his rivals at the net with his
long sweeping drive, but play was di
rected as little as possible toward
him. Thomas was slightly off form
and was consequently the receiver of
a greater part of the play.
Should the babes triumph in one
more match, they will hold the title
as class champions for the first time
since the days of Hahn and Murray.
C. C. Crosby, '19, and Lounsbury
Fish, *21, and Bent and Turner will
contest the last rounds of the tourna
ment to decide the class champion
ships. This will be played sometime
this week on the lucal courts, prob
ably Wednesday.
