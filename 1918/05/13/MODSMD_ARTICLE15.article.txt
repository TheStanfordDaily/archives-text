# Farm Workers are Asked to Enroll
## Students Desiring Summer Work May Enlist in Employment Reserve 
### 
In order to find work for college
, students during vacation the United
! States Government has arranged to
enroll university men in the Public
Service Reserve, which is the re
cruiting branch of the United States
I Employment Service of the Depart
' ment of Labor, as was announced re-
I cently. In connection with this cam
â–  paign, Professors L. I. Burlingame and
iW. L. Cooper have received enroll
ment cards, which they are asking
! Stanford men to sign.
! Field men in the employ of the De
i partment of Labor are working in the
agricultural sections of the United
States in an effort to locate jobs for
the men during the summer months.
When this data is secured and also
the information from the colleges, the
officials of the reserve will be in a
position to make definite offers to
both the men and the farmers.
Investigations made by agricultural
workers have disclosed the fact that
\ farm labor will be in great demand
this summer, on account of the need
of maximum food production and the
loss of farm laborers to the army. In
order to remedy this situation, the
j government is making this appeal to
the college men, urging summer work
as a patriotic duty.
Among the American universities
that are enrolling their men for the
reserve are Bowdoin College, the
University of South Carolina, Ohio
University, Western Reserve Univer
sity, and Muhlenberg College. These
universities will supply men for work
in all parts of the country.
When the students sign the enroll
ment blanks, they are asked about
previous farm experience, preference
of employment, and in what sections
of the country they prefer to work.
By signing a blank, the student
only indicates that he will accept a
job if it is offered to him, provided
he is not engaged in some other oc
cupation.
John B. Densmore, director general
of the United States Employment Ser
vice, is in active charge of the re
serve, and under him there are va
rious state, county, and local com
missioners. Arthur P. Will, with of
fices in Sacramento, is state director
for California, and it is under his di
rection that the college men in this
state will be enrolled.
As it is necessary that the enroll
ment data may be compiled by May
15, Professors Burlingame and Cooper
will consult immediately with men in
terested in the work at their offices.!
Professor Burlingame may be seen at
his office, room 469, from 2 to 4 p. m.,'
and Professor Cooper can be seen in
room 40 from 10 to 12 a. m.
