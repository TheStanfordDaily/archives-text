We don't often stop to think in the busy round of study and activity at
Stanford University how much we owe this institution and its founders, it
is the recurrence of days such as tomorrow, the anniversary of Leland Stan
ford Junior's birthday, that reminds us what a debt of gratitude is due the
founders. We little realize the care and forethought that were exercised in
the minutest details, until we look about and note the ideal location, the
beauty, the conveniences that surround us, and grasp the opportunity that is
being afforded us. It is at such times that, in spite of difficulties and minor
tribulations, we are more than glad to be here.
