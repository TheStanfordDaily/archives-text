# MME. SCHUMANN-HEINK

### 
A long stride toward the success of the Song Festival in June was made
with the generous and eager response from Mine. Schumann-Heink, who
agreed to make the tedious trip across the continent to sing for the benefit
of the soldiers and the Stanford women's unit for relief work in France. It is
such splendid spirit and enthusiasm that carries success wherever it goes.
Stanford is exceedingly fortunate in having the cooperation of Mme. Schumann-
Heink, who has given her sons and her services to the war. We look forward
to the same eagerness for the success of the festival to be manifested by
Stanfordites!
