### 
Mr. Willis F. Gross, C. S. 8., mem
ber of the Board of Lectureship of the
First Church of Christ, Scientist, of
Boston, delivered a Christian Science
lecture in the Women's Club House,
Friday evening. Miss Ruth Fesler,
'18, introduced the lecturer, who said j
in part:
"The basis of Christianity is a right
apprehension of God and man's rela
tion to his creator. John declared,
"Beloved, now are we the sons of
God." The apprehension of this great
truth lifts thought above the belief
that God's child is either an invalid
or a sinner, or that he can be in
bondage to any phase of evil.
"Throughout the centuries the prob
lem of evil has been a perplexing
one and few persons have reached a
satisfactory conclusion. Christian Sci
ence offers the only practical solu
tion of this question when it declares !
that evil is neither person, place, nor
thing. It possesses neither intelli
gence, power, nor reality. On this
basis it is possible to demonstrate the j
nothingness of evil and thereby prove
the eternal reality of good. The real-:
lty of good was the keynote of Jesus'
teaching, and this understanding |
leaves no room or opportunity for the j
Indulgence of evil."
