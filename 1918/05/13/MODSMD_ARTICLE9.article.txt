# June 1 Named as Date of A.S.S.U. Benefit Dance
## 
### 
June 1 is to be the date of the As
sociated Students' dance, according to
an announcement given out today by
Student Body president, F. O. Prior,
'18. This struggle which will be giv
en under the auspices of the Execu
tive Committee, will be staged in the
Women's Club House, and will take
the form of a nickel dance.
The proceeds will go toward the
purchasing of 1919 Quads to distri
bute to California High Schools. It
has always been a custom to send out
100 such year-books, but the limited
finances of the Student Body this
year make it impossible for this to be
done unaided, and unless the coming
dance is a financial success, this val
uable advertising of Stanford life will
not be possible. Any excess will go
toward replenishing A. S. S. U. funds.
The Women's Athletic Association
will co-operate in making this dance a
success.
