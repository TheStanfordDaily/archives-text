A FAIR QUESTION —it is fairly answered in the detailed
and itemized reports that have been published in the news
papers of every town and city in the land.
You never saw it? Then — ask at the nearest Red Cross
Chapter, or write, for the Red Cross wants you to know where
your money went.
They say that Red Cross supplies have a way of coming
through on time.
Italy surely did not find us wanting in promptness when her
great trial came.
And Roumania —they said no allied nation could get through
to help her dire need. But —the Red Cross found a way.
It's not always a cheap way — "Needs must" cost money.
But did you give that money to be saved —or to save lives? Are
you not willing to pay five dollars or fifty to bring aid and com
fort to a war-racked, tortured mortal who but for you would
surely die?
And of one thing you may be sure: not one penny of that
Hundred Million has gone for anything hut War Relief.
In the Red Cross there is no high-salaried bureaucracy, no
extravagant administration expense. All of the higher officials
and nine-tenths of the workers are unpaid volunteers.
The cost of raising and collecting the last War Fund was
about one-half of one per cent, more than covered by the bank
ing interest on the money.
Your Red Cross needs another Hundred Million to lighten
just a little of the iwful load of misery over there. Your share
is all that you can give—and then a little mora.
Will you hold your end?
