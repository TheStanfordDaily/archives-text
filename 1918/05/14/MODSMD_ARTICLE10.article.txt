# H.O. HILL TO AID LOCAL Y.M.C.A.
## 
### 
Harry O. Hill, state secretary of the
Y. M. C. A., is expected on the cam
pus tomorrow. He will aid the local
Y. M. C. A. in formulating plans for
the coming year. The new cabinet
has not yet been selected, but will be
chosen before the arrival of -Mr. Hill.
A joint conference will then be held
sometime during the latter part of the

week between both the old and the
new cabinet members. Owing to the
fact that many of the older workers
have either graduated or sone into
war service, the Y. M. C. A. has had
to work against a hard proposition.
Mr. Hill, however, is well known for
his ability in organizing, and be will
no doubt prove of great aid to the
' local chapter.
