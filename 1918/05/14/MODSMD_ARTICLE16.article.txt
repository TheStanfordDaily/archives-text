# NEW METHODS FOR THE BLUE CARD SALE
## 
### 
There has been something pitifully frantic and all but futile in the quar
terly attempts at "campaigns" for student body members. Committees have
been named to collect dues and sell the blue cards, but success has become
increasingly unattainable.
Next year, without intercollegiate competition in athletics, there will be
even less incentive for the students who remain in the University to buy A. S.
S. U. tickets. The Daily Palo Alto would be about the only benefit to be de
rived and, as has been pointed out before, it would be better for the Daily
Palo Alto to stand on its own feet financially.
With the present method thrown in the discard, two alternatives have
been suggested, either of which would be at least more successful than the
one now in use. The first is to sell the cards for the entire year in the fall
for $5, the sum to include subscription to the Daily Palo Alto ,and then sell
memberships at correspondingly smaller amounts to new students entering
in the winter or spring. This would make but one sale necessary in the case
of most students and eliminate considerable inconvenience both to student
and graduate manager's office. The probability is that it would garner in
more dollars.
The other alternative is to add $1 to the quarterly registration fees. It
la felt that the financial status of the Associated Students has become critical
enough to wari'ant such action, for the A. S. S. U. must be maintained, even
as the Union or the gyms. Under this second plan the Daily would work out
its own financial salvation on a straight subscription basis.
Appeals to loyalty are fine things, but no longer net much when the fur
nishing of funds is left a voluntary matter. Hence it is necessary to take
speedy action on this matter.
