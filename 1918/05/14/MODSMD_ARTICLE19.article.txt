No more wool will be given out this
quarter by the Stanford Red Cross

which have already been started.
Those who need more wool to finish
their knitting will be able to obtain it
at the Women's Club House, on Mon
day between the hours of two and
three and on Wednesday from 4:30
o'clock to 5.
All knitted articles must be re
turned to the Stanford Auxiliary on
or before June 1 or the cost of the
wool wnol be charged to the holder.
