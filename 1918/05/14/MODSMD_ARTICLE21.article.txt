To the Edtor of the Daily Palo Alto:
I have been listening to the inform
ing, and often inspiring, patriotic ad
dresses throughout the year, and my
feeling that it is inappropriate to fol
low these addresses with a spiritless
rendering of "Hail, Stanford, Hail,"
has grown upon each occasion. I iiave
expressed myself to my associates
and have always met with agreement,
and when the small boy, who attend
ed the last assembly in my company,
volunteered the same opinion on the
way home, I began to hope that it
might be sufficiently general to sup
port the substitution of "The Star-
Spangled Banner" at such meetings.
It is freely admitted that an assem
bly rendering of our national anthem
is far from satisfactory, but I have
known no time so favorable to learn
ing to sing that stirring song as the
present. Would it be possible for Dr.
Eaton to always lead the assembly
with the piano? At least once this
year he has done this, and the effect
was promising of a proficiency which
would stay the blush in the presence
of foreigners if only the assembly
might repeat the performance often
under such admirable leadership. I,
for one, should feel it a patriotic serv
ice on the part of our skillful choir
master to teach us to sing our na
tional anthem. If this demand upon
his time and energy made it neces
sary, the community might "do its
bit" by foregoing the delightful organ
recitals on the days of assembly.
