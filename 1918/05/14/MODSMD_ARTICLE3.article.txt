# Extra Hour of Daylight Is Responsible for Encina Indoor Baseball League
## 
### 
Another use for the Daylight Sav
ing Law! Members of the Encina
eating clubs have at last solved the
problem of what to do with that elus
ive hour from seven to eight. Indoor
baseball has come into its own on the
Encina Club lawn. The first game of
the spring season was held last even
ing. The contest was in the nature
of an informal walkaway for the
Breakaway Club, so much so that by
the time the score had grown to mag
nitude beyond record, it was de
cided to stage a formal exhibition of
the national indoor pastime at 6:45
this evening. El Campo Club lays
claim to prowess on the mowed dia
mond and has challenged the victors
of last night's slaughter to a game
this evening.
Breakers won last night, but It is
not known what team was defeated.
Walter-Johnson Briggs was ineffective
in the box for the losers, as was Ray-
Schalk Levy behind the plate. Eddie-
Collins Kegley was a better debater
than second baseman. For the win
ners of the untabulated game, Hiram
West starred with his long hits at bat
and his conversation in the field.
Chick Swift's footwork at first was of
exceptional help and held down the
score considerably. Buck-Weaver
Betts kept the third bag guarded in
excellent style.
