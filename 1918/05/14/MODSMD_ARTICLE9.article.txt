## 
### 
F. F. Dickie, naval architect and
shipbuilder, will lecture Thursday
Thursday morning at 11 o'clock in the
Little Theater on "Concrete Ships and
the Shipping Crisis," in the next of
the series of war information talks.
Mr. Dickie is editor of the Pacific
Marine Journal, the official organ of
the Shipbuilding Owners' Association
of the Pacific Coast. He is a graduate
of the School of Naval Architecture at
Glasgow University and has worked
for a number of years as naval archi
tect with the Union Iron Works.

The members of Mr. Dickie's fam
ily have for several generations been
actively engaged in shipbuilding. His
father was former manager of the San
Francisco branch of the Union Iron
Works and is now the head of one of
the big shipbuilding companies operat
ing a plant in Oakland.
After careful investigations of the
possibilities of concrete ships Mr.
Dickie is convinced that they can be
used to great advantage in the pres
ent shipping crisis occasioned by the
war.
