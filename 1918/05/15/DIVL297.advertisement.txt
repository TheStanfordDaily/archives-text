THE WAR'S RECOMPENSE
The original of this verse was found on an American soldier who
bravely fought and as nobly died. The man is yet unknown.
Ye who have faith to look with fearless eyes
Eeyond the tragedy of a world at strife,
And know that out of death and nignt shall rise
The dawn of ampler life.
Rejoice, whatever anguish rend the heart,
That God has given you a priceless dower,
To live in these great times and have your pai
In freedom's crowning hour.
That ye may tell your sons who see the light
High in the heavens —their heritage to take—
"1 saw the powers of darkness put to flight,
1 saw the morning break."
A MESSAGE FROM EDWARD N. HURLEY,
Chairman of the United States Shipping Board.
EVERY dollar that has been appropriated by the Ameri
can Red Cross in this war has welded closer that
relationship between the United States and the nations of
the Entente, a relationship that will have a marked effect
upon the peace council that is coming.
If this work of spreading the gospel of mercy is to
continue, every man, woman and child in this republic
must give the American Red Cross his fullest support in
its second campaign for $100,000,000.
Our boys in Europe are looking to us to back them up
and I know of no better means of supporting them than
through the instrumentality of the American Red Cross.
The good it has already accomplished and the com
forts and welfare it will provide later when the stress
of war becomes greater for the United States forces, make
it imperative that the second fund of $100,000,000 be a
spontaneous gift on the part of the American people.
