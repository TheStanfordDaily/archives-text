The Name "Gillette"
Means the Same Tiling to Every Fighting Man
THE severest test of the;, usefulness of
anything is—will it fit the soldier's need.
The fighting men of the Allied Armies and
Navies use more Gillettes than of all other
makes of razors put together.
They have proved the quality of the Gil
lette shave —with even the most tender skin
and the most stubby beard.
There isn't a shaving condition anywhere
on earth that the Gillette hasn't solved —No
Stropping, No Honing—blades always sharp,
always ready.
If you have a boy or a boy friend in the
Service, or likely to be called to the Colors
give him a Gillette—complete, compact, no
strops or hones to clutter up the kit.
