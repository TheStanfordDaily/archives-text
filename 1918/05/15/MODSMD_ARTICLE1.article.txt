As one of the series of war inform

versity and has had many years of
experience as naval architect with
large,, iron and construction companies

concrete shipping possibility in con
nection with his work as the editor
of the Marine Journal and has gath
ered first hand statistics of the ad
vantages of Buch ships in the pres
ent shipping crisis.
The next of the series of war in
formation lectures will also deal with
a phase of the war aside from the ac
tual military situation. On May 23

"Engineering Problems and Achieve
ments oÂ£ the War."
