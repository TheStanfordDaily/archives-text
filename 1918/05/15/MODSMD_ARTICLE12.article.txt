# FOREIGN SOLDIERS ARE WELCOMED IN MEMORIAL CHURCH
## REFUGEES VISIT CAMPUS Belgians and French Who Escaped from Austrian Army Are Greeted 
### 
Their faces bronzed by years of ex
posure, and some of them showing
the effects of hardship, but with the
hope of regained freedom in their
eyes, and the determination to make
the best of it expressed in their bear
ing, the several hundred Belgian
and French who escaped from the
Austrian armies gave Stanford a thrill
this afternoon such as has not been
experienced for many months.
The men arrived at Memorial
Church at 2:30 and were greeted with
addresses of welcome. After the
program they were taken about the
Stanford campus before their return
to San Francisco. Automobiles deco
rated with the red, yellow and black
of the Belgian tricolor brought the
refugees up Palm Drive and stopped
at the north entrance of the Quad.
From the machines the soldiers
mrched up Memorial Court and into
the church, past the Stanford R. O. T.
C. lined up on each side as a guard of
honor.
The men did not march in military
precision, and the lines were inter
spersed with civilians and women,
but the response of those who viewed
the scene was no less hearty. Round
after round of applause greeted
America's allies as the red-capped
marchers saluted the national flag.
At Memorial Church they were
greeted with an address of welcome.
Professor C. G. Allen delivered a
four-minute talk in French, bidding
the visitors welcome, sympathy, and
God-speed, and congratulating them
on their escape from the armies
of autocracy and their determination
to fight the battle of democracy. Louis
H. Eaton rendered a program on the
Memorial Church organ.
The men are touring the peninsula
in automobiles belonging to San Fran
cisco people. They arrived at Camp
Fremont at noon, were given the hon
ons of the cantonment, and had mess
there. After their visit at Stanford
they were entertained at Palo Alto
before their return to San Francisco
this evening.
Acting President C. D. Marx pre
sided at the meeting this afternoon.
The committee of welcome was com
posed of Dr. J. M. Stillman, Professor
R. E. Swain, Professor Frank Angell,
Captain Parker, and Assistant Regis
trar J. E. McDowell.
