# Switzerland Model Republic of World
## Has Taught Nations True Meaning of Democracy Says Dr. Raymond 
### 
"Switzerland is the world's model
republic, and it presents an example
of national unity and strength not
found in other European nations,"
said Dr. Jerome Hall Raymond in his
lecture, "Switzerland: The Triumph
of Democracy," in the Little Theater
last evening.
During his talk, i nwhich he told of
I the history of Europe's mountain re
i public and of its principal cities, he
j showed a number of interesting views
; illustrating his topic.
"The government of this small na-
I tion," he continued, "has long enjoyed
the profound respect of other coun
[ tries, for they are learning from the
' Swiss the benefit of public ownership
[ of public utilities, without which there
! can be no true democracy.
"Although the nation is composed
of four distinct and different peoples,
yet they are bound together by a pas
sion for liberty which has been the
guiding star of Switzerland for many
years, ft is therefore not strange that
the Red Cross should have had its
birth there."
He told also of the actual govern
ment of Switzerland, giving its his
tory and present foundations. It is
a combination of federal and copti
nental systems and is based in part
upon the American system, especially
in its congress. It has worked out the
referendum and the initiative to a
greater extent than the United States
has done, practically embodying those
privileges in the civic rights of the
people.
"The Swiss motto, 'AH for each and
each for all,' means that all help each
other .and none thwart," he concluded.
"In this little mountain republic,
the representative government
exists for all, we find democracy well
nigh perfect."
