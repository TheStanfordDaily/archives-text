						DANCE FOR LIFE

### 
"The greatest mother In the world" Is the appropriate title accorded the
Red Cross whose activities extend to every kind of need, from rebuilding and
replenishing ravaged homes to comforting and cheering both men at the front
and their families behind them. To continue the work of saving rather than
destroying, the Red Cross must have funds, and she is in need of them now.
Next week a huge drive will be launched all over the country for money.
A little in advance of the nation-wide campaign, Stanford will begin activ
ity on Friday night with the Red Cross dance to be given by the "500" at the
Delta Gamma and Kappa Kappa Gamma houses. All proceeds will be given
for local Red Cross work, whose funds at this time are very low, and whose
work has been halted because of this. Since a closed date for the occasion
has been secured, every Stanfordite should be "on his toes' Friday night to
help the cause.
To help in this case will incur little sacrifice on the part of the bene
factors, for Stanford people dance whether for a cause or no. Each nickel
invested in dance tickets at the Red Cross dance will go to save a life or cheer
a home made destitute by the great war. The women are planning to show a
large number a good time on Friday night. Surely the cause is such that
their expectations will be fulfilled.
