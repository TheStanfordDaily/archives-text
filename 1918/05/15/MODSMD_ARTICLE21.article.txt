FABLES FROM FANNFE
Being the First of a Scries on Student
Life.
Once there was a student who was
the kind that always sits up in the
front row and wears an uncharging,
interested, and serious expression for
all that her professor says, and nods
affirmation when he brings out an em
phatic point.
And one day she was so occupied in
being earnest about it ail that she
didn't notice the professor had sprung
a joke, and when the others smiled,
her expression of concern never
changed the breadth of an eyelash.
And the professor saw her face and
realized that she had not laughed at
his joke. He put her down in his
mind for a very ungrasping student.
And the student, looking up and see
ing the wondering expression on his
face as he glanced at her, and sensing
the slight murmur of amusement
around, hastily erased her expression
of earnestness and laughed loudly, up
roariously, and continuously. But it
was too late.
Moral: Don't frown approval—it
gives only wrinkles and the wrong
impression.
Judging from recent assemblies, if
the war keeps up the men will have
to sit in the galleries and the women
will be in the senior section.
SHOOTS
IN WAR TIME. OF COURSE
Scene: Santa Clara Valley, July,
1918.
Gwendolyn, Stanford, '20, Flappa Pi
—"Oh, dear, isn't this heat terrific?
I'm nearly roasted."
Hortense, ditto, '19, Kappa Selfa
Hata —"No, I don't mind it at all.!
You see, it's a uniform heat."
SOME PROPOSED UNITS
Now that uniting seems to be the
favorite indoor sport at Stanford,
those units have been proposed:
1. A unit from campus dramatic
societies to go over and manage Ger
man finances. (Ought to end the war
at Ica. t riv months sooner.)
2. A unit to keep up-to-date infor
mation on rtudont regulations. (This
would fill a long-felt want, as many
students are wondering, for instance,
whether they are breaking any rules
by taking a chance on a Union meat
oider.)
3. An anti-insomnia unit from the
faculty. •

interested, and serious expression for
all that her professor says, and nods
affirmation when he brings out an em
phatic point.
And one day she was so occupied in
being earnest about it ail that she
didn't notice the professor had sprung
a joke, and when the others smiled,
her expression of concern never
changed the breadth of an eyelash.
And the professor saw her face and
realized that she had not laughed at
his joke. He put her down in his
mind for a very ungrasping student.
And the student, looking up and see
ing the wondering expression on his
face as he glanced at her, and sensing
the slight murmur of amusement
around, hastily erased her expression
of earnestness and laughed loudly, up
roariously, and continuously. But it
was too late.
Moral: Don't frown approval—it
gives only wrinkles and the wrong
impression.
Judging from recent assemblies, if
the war keeps up the men will have
to sit in the galleries and the women
will be in the senior section.
SHOOTS
IN WAR TIME. OF COURSE
Scene: Santa Clara Valley, July,
1918.
Gwendolyn, Stanford, '20, Flappa Pi
—"Oh, dear, isn't this heat terrific?
I'm nearly roasted."
Hortense, ditto, '19, Kappa Selfa
Hata —"No, I don't mind it at all.!
You see, it's a uniform heat."
SOME PROPOSED UNITS
Now that uniting seems to be the
favorite indoor sport at Stanford,
those units have been proposed:
1. A unit from campus dramatic
societies to go over and manage Ger
man finances. (Ought to end the war
at Ica. t riv months sooner.)
2. A unit to keep up-to-date infor
mation on rtudont regulations. (This
would fill a long-felt want, as many
students are wondering, for instance,
whether they are breaking any rules
by taking a chance on a Union meat
oider.)
3. An anti-insomnia unit from the
faculty. •
