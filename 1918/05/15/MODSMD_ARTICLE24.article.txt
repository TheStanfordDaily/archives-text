## THREE DAY EXERCISES Formal Graduating Program to Take Place Monday Morning, June 17 
### 
Diplomas to the 1918 graduating j
class at Stanford will be handed oul I
in the Memorial Church this year, as
the committee on public exercises lias
announced that the graduation pro
gram will be held in that edifice in
stead of in the Assembly Hall or at
the bandstand.
All the commencement exercises are
to be crowded into three days, and

than they were last year. Just as at
other educational institutions, the war
spirit will be observed here, and sim
plicity will be carried out in all
events.
The formal graduating program will
be held on Monday morning. June 17.
The actual number of students present
to receive their diplomas will prob
ably be the smallest in many a year,
as a large number of the seniors have
already gone into military training.
Some of those nearby may be able to
get away from camp, but it is prob
able that the largest number who are
wearing Uncle Sam's uniform will find
it impossible to get furloughs so as to
be here.
No announcement has yet been
made of the commencement speaker,
as the committee has not closed ne
gotiations. Chairman Bassett has
been in communication with several
prominent persons, and will be able
to announce next week who has been
engaged.
As usual, t lie baccalaureate ser
mon will be preached on Sunday of
Commencement Week, this year June
l(i.

campus are likely to attend.

The Class of 1593 had planned to
lay its plate this commencement, but
Secretary F. M. McFarland has an
nounced that this event has been post
poned until after the war. The funds
which had been collected for this pur
pose will go to the use of the govern
ment in exchange for Liberty Bonds,
as the class deemed it better to help
in the war than to lay the plate now.
This will be the twenty-fifth anniver
sary of this class, and the members
will try to make it an event of im
portance proportionate to the occas
ion.
The I'lii Beta Kappa annual exer
cises are to take place on Saturday.

Saturday, June 15, lias been set
aside as Senior-Alumni Day, and from
morning to late at night the program
will be fully occupied. The seniors
will hold their class exercises in the
morning, planting their tree, making
their pilgrimage to the mausoleum to

This is reunion year for the Classes of
'93, '98, '03, '08, '13, and 'lti, but on
account of war conditions only those
living within a short distance of the
campus are likely to attend.

The Class of 1593 had planned to
lay its plate this commencement, but
Secretary F. M. McFarland has an
nounced that this event has been post
poned until after the war. The funds
which had been collected for this pur
pose will go to the use of the govern
ment in exchange for Liberty Bonds,
as the class deemed it better to help
in the war than to lay the plate now.
This will be the twenty-fifth anniver
sary of this class, and the members
will try to make it an event of im
portance proportionate to the occas
ion.
The I'lii Beta Kappa annual exer
cises are to take place on Saturday.
The orator will be Professor Frank
Cooper of Cornell, who will be here
for the first term of the summer quar
ter in the English department. The
name of the poet has not been an
nounced yet.
The senior class will not have its
annual ball, promenade, or play, be
cause of the Hooverizing of the pro
gram.
Diplomas to the 1918 graduating j
class at Stanford will be handed oul I
in the Memorial Church this year, as
the committee on public exercises lias
announced that the graduation pro
gram will be held in that edifice in
stead of in the Assembly Hall or at
the bandstand.
All the commencement exercises are
to be crowded into three days, and
they will be even more Hooverized
than they were last year. Just as at
other educational institutions, the war
spirit will be observed here, and sim
plicity will be carried out in all
events.
The formal graduating program will
be held on Monday morning. June 17.
The actual number of students present
to receive their diplomas will prob
ably be the smallest in many a year,
as a large number of the seniors have
already gone into military training.
Some of those nearby may be able to
get away from camp, but it is prob
able that the largest number who are
wearing Uncle Sam's uniform will find
it impossible to get furloughs so as to
be here.
No announcement has yet been
made of the commencement speaker,
as the committee has not closed ne
gotiations. Chairman Bassett has
been in communication with several
prominent persons, and will be able
to announce next week who has been
engaged.
