# "I'm afraid that's all I can spare"
## 
### 
'VT'OU'RE a regular, red-blooded, true-blue American.
You love your country. You love that flapping, snap
ping old flag. Your heart thumps hard when the troops
tramp by. You're loyal —100 per cent!
You intend to—you want to—help win the war in a hurry.
"Sacrifice? Sure!" you've been thinking. "Just you wait
till they really need it." And you've honestly thought you
meant that, too. But —

Look yourself in the eye, now, and search up
and down inside of your heart—did you mean it?
Did you really mean "sacrifice"?
Listen: you feel poor. This Third Liberty
Loan, the high prices, the Income Tax — you've
done your bit. You feel that you've given all
you can spare.
IVhai ? Then what did you mean ? What's
that you said about loving your country? What
did you think the word "sacrifice" means?
Surely you didn't mean, did you, to give only
what you can spare 112
What about our boys who are giving their
lives in the trenches? Are they giving only what
they can "spare" ?

How about those motners and little "kiddies"
in the shell-wrecked towns of that war-swept
hell:—hungry—ragged—sobbing—alone ? Giving
up their homes, their husbands, their fathers.
While we — over here with our fun and our
comforts —we hold up our heads and feel patriotic
because we have given—what 112 Some loose bills
off the top of our roll. "We* ve given all we
can spare!' 1
Come, come! Let's quit fooling ourselves.
Let us learn what "sacrifice" means. Let us give
more than we can spare — let us "give till the
heart says stop! "
And —let us give right now!
