# Billy Jones

### WRIGHT A. PATTERSON 
Billy Jones—maybe your «on or the
son of a neighbor—was in the front
line trenches in France when the Ger
man bombing party was driven back.
His enthusiasm to get the Boches car
ried him over the top of the trench,
and at the edge of No Man's Land a
Hun bullet got him.
A comrade —maybe your boy—crawl
ed out into No Man's Land and brought
Billy Jones back to the American
trenches.
Other comrades carried him back
through the maze of trenches to a
dressing station, where his wound was
cared for.
A medical department ambulance
carried him on to the field hospital.
From there Billy Jones was taken to
the base hospital, and there a Red
Cross nurse —your lied Cross nurse —
is tenderly, carefully, smilingly nursing
him back to health again so that 'ie
may not have to pay the extreme sac
rifice that we —that you and I and our
neighbors—may enjoy the blessings of
freedom.
There are half a million of these
boys of ours in France today and
more going "over there" every week.
They are there to wage the supreme
conflict of the world with the brutal
forces of autocracy that democracy,
our heritage, may not perish.
