"There is no national asset today so
much to be desired as a completely
full school house. "Stick to your
jobs," is the statement of Dr. Anna
Howard Shaw. Chairman of the Wo
man's Committee of the Council of
National Defense, who has returned
to Washington, D. C., from a trip to
Indianapolis, where in a few days she
spoke to the press women of the state,
the state council, the Indiana division
of the woman's committee and to the
1400 teachers of Indianapolis. "City
teachers should do war work during
the summer. Let them join the army
of women who are going on the land i
or get into some outdoor occupation j
where they will get the things God
lets exist there which cannot be found
indoors. They will return to the
school with greater health and treas
ures of memory to bestow upon the
i hildren in their charge.
"Country teachers write to the

headquarters of the woman's com
mittee in Washington in great num
bers asking what they can do in the
city, yearning for some expression of
their patriotism which will take them
away from the drudgery and hard
ship of most of the country schools.
There never was a time when the na
tion needed its teachers on tho job
in the country so much as it does
now. They should stay by their
schools, stand to their posts with the
military spirit of a soldier on duty.
The country boy and girl need educa
tion more than ever. Parents need
persuasion to keep their children in
school these days when there is fear
that labor will run short. The coun
try and city teachers' influence is
greatly needed in every locality.
