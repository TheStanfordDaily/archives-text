# R.O.T.C. WILL BE PART OF U.S. ARMY NEXT YEAR
## 
### 
Stanford It O. T. C. will give way
to an entirely new system of military
instruction which will be provided for
all college students of the United
States, beginning the next college
year, in September, 1918. The govern
ment will provide military instructors
and all necessary military equipment
as far as possible. Every college in
the country, enrolling more than 100
students over the age of 18, will
come under the new provisions.
Enlistment in those training units
will be purely voluntary, but when
enlisted the student will constitute a
member of the army of the United
States, and therefore will be liable to
active duty at the call of the Presi
dent. The government now asks all

those who do not graduate this spring
to take advantage of this opportunity
to serve the nation, and to continue
their education. Some of the minor
details remain yet to be worked out,
but the general plan is as follows:
"The status of the men will be
changed somewhat in that the college
men will be practically privates in
the army, although occupying the po
sition of men on the reserved list.
The R. O. T. C. training will be em
phasized more and the men will prob
ably receive uniforms and commuta
tion of rations. A slight money allow
ance may be given," said Captain Par
ker this morning.
"Military instruction under officers
I ami non-commissioned officers of the
I army will be provided in every insti
tution of college grade, which enrolls
j for the instruction ol' 100 or more
| able-bodied students over the age of
| 18. The necessary military equip
j ment will, as far as possible, be pro
! vided by the government. There will
lie created a military training unit in
each institution.
"Enlistment will be purely volun
tary, but all students over the age of
IS will be encouraged to enlist. The
enlistment will constitute the student
a member of the army of the United
States, liable to active duty at the call
o:' the President. It will, however, be
the policy of the government not to
call the members of the training units
to active duty until they have reached
the age of 21, unless urgent military
necessity compels an earlier call. Stu
lents under 18 and therefore not legal
ly eligible for enlistment, will be en
couraged to enroll in the training
units.
"Provision will be made for co
ordinating the reserve officers' train
ing corps system, which exists in
about one-third of the collegiate in
stitutions, with this broader plan."
The purposes which the government
had in mind in establishing this new
system are: to prevent unnecessary
and wasteful depletion of the col
leges through the large number of en
listments, and yet at the same time to
offer the students a definite and im
mediate military status, developing a
great military asset for the country
as well.
