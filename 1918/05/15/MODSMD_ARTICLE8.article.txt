# FRATERNITY MEN HOLD MEETING
## 
### 
Representatives from practically
every fraternity on the campus met
last night at the Zeta Psi house to dis
cuss the fraternity situation and to
formulate plans for an organized pro
test against the one-year freshman
dormitory rule which the administra
tion has announced will go into ef
fect next October. No definite action
by the local organization was taken,
but a course of action by the various
alumni associations was mapped out.
C. K. Field, '95, editor of the Sun
set magazine, is to be at the head of
the movement in San Francisco. Ac
cording to the present plan, each fra
ternity on the campus is to appoint a
prominent alumnus living in or near
San Francisco and these men will
meet in that city to decide what ac
tion will be moßt suitable to the sit
uation. A delegation of this body will
probably meet President Wilbur on
his return to the campus in about a
month, and lay the fraternities' case
before him, in an endeavor to have
the dormitory rule suspended for the
duration of the war.
C. F. Murphy, '00, a prominent at

torney of Portland, will take charge of
the organized alumni protest in that
city, and a similar course of action
will be pursued there. Alumni asso
ciations in Los Angeles and possibly
other cities are expected to join in the
protest. It is probable that univer
sity clubs will be to some extent the
organs through which the protests
will be voiced.
Field, who visited the campus Mon
day night, explained his attitude on
the question.
"I am in favor of a one-year dormi
tory rule under any ordinary condi
tions," he said, "but to put it into ef
fect during the war would practically
amount to the death of at least some
of the Stanford chapters. For this
reason I believe such an action would
be a mistake at the present time, and
should be postponed till the close of
the war."
Local fraternity chapters, realizing
the seriousness of the situation, are
making every effort to have the ex
isting regulations altered in such a
way as to permit them to exist on the
campus during the war.
