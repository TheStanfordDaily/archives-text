WHAT does all this mean to you? And yet —worderful as is this record of accom
plishment—it is but a fraction of the work your Red Cross has dojne and is
doing.
Without this ceaseless, heroic work of the American Red Cross—we could nevei win
this war.
Without your Red Cross—quick, vital help to keep Italy in the fight for Liberty would
,not have been possible. •
Without your Red Cross—thousands of French soldiers now gallantly fighting for you
at the front would have died of wounds, exposure, and lack of food.
And great and wonderful as has been the work of the American Red Cross in the past, still
greater and more wonderful must it be in the future—for now your boy is in the fight.
Your Red Cross cannot neglect France, England, Italy, Serbia, Roumania, and little Bel

been fighting our battles.
But now we must all redouble our efforts and sacrifices for our Red Cross, because a
million mothers' sons are going to carry the Stars and Stripes to the greatest victory God has
wer given to men fighting for honor and liberty.
With the help of your Red Cross, your boy will win. See that he gets ill
