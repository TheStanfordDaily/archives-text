# SHIPBUILDING UP TO SCHEDULE SAYS DICKIE
## 
### 
"Contrary to the general impression
that the shipbuilders of this country
are not keeping pace with the de
mands made by the war, ihe rapidity
with which the shipbuilding program
is progressing is one of the most re
markable feats being accomplished in
the war," declared F. B. Dickie, ed
itor of the Marine Journal of San
Francisco, in a discussion of "Con
crete Ships and the Shipping Crisis"
this morning in the Little Theater.
"Shipbuilders of the Pacific coast are
launching at least two ships daily,
instead of two a year which was the
average four years ago. Within the
next six months the output will prob
ably mount to three launchings daily."
"When the United States entered
the war we were not a shipbuilding
nation. All the ships that the few
shipbuilding concerns were turning
out were for the United States navy,
with an occasional coastwise steamer
sandwiched in. Foreign trade drew
no ships from the yards of the United
States concerns.
"Since the war began shipbuilding
owners have turned out fifty tons of
ships a year in place of one ton be
fore the war. Similar strain has been
placed on constructional and man
agerial labor.
California Builds First ("oncrete Ship
"Concrete has been used for many
years to a certain extent in the inner
construction oL' ships to protect the
metal. In Norway concrete barges
have been built for use in the Baltic
and in France concrete barges are
usel as canal crafts.
"A small concrete steamer was built
in Norway some years ago, but it re
mained for California to build the first
ocean-going vessel of concrete which
was launched at Redwood City a few
weeks ago. The concrete ship has
been hailed as the rescuer of all the
shipping problems of the commerce of
the United States. But in reality, there
is no excuse for its existence but the
present war. A large fleet of concrete
ships would be a drug on the market
after the war is over, but any help
which they can render during the war
would offset any such loss. Concrete
ships average about 40 per cent heav
ier than steel ships of the same ton
nage, which is a fact which must be
considered when carrying capacity
and not the actual numbers of ships
is to be considered.
An Engineering Success
"From an engineering point of
view," he continued, "the concrete
ship lias proved a success. There are,
however, certain troubles which will
be existent in a ship of this charac
ter which did not have to be consid
ered in the steel or wooden ships. One
of these is the difficulty of keeping the
bottom free from marine growths. In
scarping thees off part of the con
crete of the hull is taken away, which
means that a certain amount of re
plastering must be done constantly to
keep the vessel in condition."
