### 
The Collegiate Section of the United
States F'ood Administration is en

for college students to take a still
larger part in the great conflict.
In carrying out this idea, the Food
Administration has had printed a spe
cial appeal to college men. The
cards read as follows:
"To College Men:"
"If yon cannot get into tthe ranks,
you can yet fight with your fellows
who have gone. Will you? The bat
tlefield is here. The battle is now.
"The struggle for Democracy is
within you. It is as important for
you to do your duty at home as it is
for the boys to do theirs 'over there.'
It. is necessary to provide food for
our armies, and for the armies and
families of the Allies, as it is to face
the enemy.
"Therefore,
1. Be intelligent: inform your
selves about food.
2. Create more food if you can.
3. Do not waste any.
4. Do not allow others to waste
any.
5. Obey the food regulations,â€”
they are the careful and honest work
of those who know what they are do

6. By every legal means prevent
their violation by others.
7. Help everyone who is trying to
serve in the cause of food.
