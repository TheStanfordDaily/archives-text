# WHY DEBTS
## 
### 
Probably in no group of people is the art of putting off to some indefinite
future date the payment of bills so highly developed as in a college com
munity. It is with little compunction that many students receive and toss
aside statements from merchants long since due. The money must be paid
some time. Why not the day it is due?
Do university students not realize that the merchant must live—that in
most cases his income is more precarious than the debtor's? The dealer
cannot run the risk that his bill will not be paid ,at least until some hazy
time in the future, without making allowance for the chance he is taking b>
an advance in the price of his goods. This may account for the fact that
prices are raised to little higher level in college communities. So the buyer,
the debtor, is the loser in the end.
Failure to pay at the time payment is due may be said to be a mild form
of stealing, and no benefit is derived in the end. In nine cases out of ten the
college student receives a definite monthly income, and if he exceeds this one
month he usually has little ground for the supposition that he will have
more the next month. Debts are usually incurred to satisfy a whim or to
provide unnecessary luxuries, for most incomes are sufficient to furnish ne
cessities. In so doing, the livelihood of the merchant may be endangered,
and the cost of living raised for those who can least afford to bear the burden.
Besides, there is the moral obligation to pay for what one buys. There
are students who purchase things with the definite intention of deferring
payment as long as it is possible to evade the creditor.
Many debts remain unsettled due only to carelessness or All
these reflect on the college community. Why should students be lessj observ
ant of the fair business transaction than people in other walks of life.
