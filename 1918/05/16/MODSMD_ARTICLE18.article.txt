# NEW BUILDING FOR PROPELLER TESTS ALMOST COMPLETED
## 
### 
Work on the new aero dynamic
building now under construction is
progressing rapidly, and estimates
are that it will be finished in a month.
The framework is in place and car
penters are now at work on the sides
of the building. The structure is
located in the rear of the Mechanical
Engineering shops.
The purpose of the building is to
provide a place for experimental re
search work in propellers and other
parts of aeroplanes. Necessary
equipment has been ordered, and it
iB expected that the testing machines
will be set up in about three months.
One feature of the equipment will be
a 100 H. P. driving motor capable of
producing a wind velocity of 100
miles an hour. Besides tests of pro
pellors, the work will include ex
periments on wing sections. The
teats are now being made in the old
art gallery.
