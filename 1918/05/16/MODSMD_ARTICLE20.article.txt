FABLES FROM FANNIE
Once there was a Freshman who
came from a small Home Town. And
at the Home Town Public High School
she was Queen Bee. So when the
Folks sent her off for "Higher Lam
in' " she decided that she would be
President of the Student Body the
first year, and would make thr Var
sity Debate. But when she got to
College she was surprised to find
that nobody knew her, and nobody
cared about her father being Mayor
of Home Town, and owner of Home
Town's only Garage. And she was
surprised also to find that you can
not get the attention of your audi
ence in debating by getting red in
the face and saying "Now looka
here!"
The new student said there was no
"spirit" in the college when they did
not recognize her Ability, and got
quite Bitter the first Semester. By
the time the second semester came
around she began to realize that
there were Dozens and Dozens of
Home Towns beside her own, and
that Home Town was not even marked
on the big map that hung in the His
tory Professor's room. So she be
gan to be reconciled, and to have
hopes for perhaps her Junior or Sen
ior years. But she wasn't quite
happy again until she went back to
her Home Town at Summer Vacation,
and everyone said, "Have you seen
Fannie? She's hack from College."
Moral: When a big frog hops
from a small pond into a larger one
he only has to change his perspective
and not his self-esteem.
