# Many Women's Uniforms Are Recognized in U.S.
## 
### 
That women are taking a largo
part in the war is shown by the fact
that twenty uniforms for women are
officially recognized by the United
States today. Those entitled to wear
them are munition workers, tele
phone and radio operators, yeomen,
employees of the shipping board and
the food administration, Red Cross
workers and the Y. VV. C. A. workers
abroad, Women's Motor Corps of New
York, Girl Scouts, and students in
the National Service School of the
Woman's Naval Service, Washington,
D. C.
Of these the most striking is that
of the Women's Motor Corps. It is
of khaki with a very short belted
jacket, s ( hort skirt, high boots and an
aviator's cap.
