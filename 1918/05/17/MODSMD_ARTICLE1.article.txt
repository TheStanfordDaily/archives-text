Founder of the Canadian Red Cross
and decorated by the king of England
for distinguished services in connec
tion with the organization of the Red
Cross, Sergeant-General Ryerson of
the Canadian army will tell of the
work of that relief organization
among civilians and soldiers in the
war zone at an assembly Monday
morning at 10 o'clock in the Assembly
hall. All 10 o'clock classes will be
suspended.
The assembly has been called to
launch the campus campaign as a part
of the national drive by the Red Cross
for funds. The women's war emerg
ency committee will be in charge of
the campus canvass and will institute
a house to house campaign to raise the
local proportion of the national drive.
With a goal of one hundred million
dollars the national Red Cross drive
will be nation-wide from May 20 to
27, for the second Red Cross war
fund. Every dollar of the fund is ap
plied directly to war relief.
Mefore the war Sergeant-General
Ryerson was connected with the fac
ulty of the University of Toronto and
is considered one of the most eminent
medical men of the dominion.
Sergeant-General Ryerson founded i
the Canadian Red Cross and has been |
active in its work throughout the do
minion since the beginning. In the
present war be has continued his
work with the relief organization and
has received honors from his govern-
mem Tor nis services.
Previous military experience in the
lloer war when lie was in charge of
the lied Cross of a division of the Eng
lish army has given Dr. Ryerson val
uable knowledge for his activities in
the present, war.
A tragedy which the sergeant-gen
eral has suffered from the war was
the loss of his wife in the Lusitania
disaster. Before her death Mrs. Ry
erson had worked faithfully in the
war work in Canada and her death
was a keen loss to the Red Cross or
ganization.
Sergeant-General Ryerson is a per
sonal friend of Professor H. R. Fair
clough and while on the campus will
be his guest, lie is expected to ar
rive Monday morning nnd besides his
address at the University assembly
