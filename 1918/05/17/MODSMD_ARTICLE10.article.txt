## HOLIDAY IS ANNOUNCED Review To Be Held Afternoon of Decoration Day on Football Turf 
### 
On Decoration Day, May 30, the en
tire Stanford Reserve Officers' Train
ing Corps will engage in a competiitve
drill and review, beginning early in
the afternoon. The review and com
petition will take place on the foot
ball turf, and as a University holiday
will be declared, Captain Parker ex
pects the bleachers to contain the-en
tire part of the student body that is
not marching.
The two recruit companies will be
divided among the six regular com
panies for a few days previous to the
competition in order that each will
have an equal chance. Stanford men
located at Camp Fremont will be
asked by Captain Parker to act as re
viewing officers and inspectors, and
they will rank the companies on the
condition of the men's uniforms,
equipment, execution of movements
and the commands of the officers. The
winning company will ait as color
guard for the coming college year.
The cadet band will be on hand to
play for the parade and review, and
in addition, Sergeant Bartels will lead
his men. in several patriotic and pop
ular selections.
The companies will form at the
gymnasium and will march to the
field one at a time for competitive
drill, according to Captain Parker's
plans. After a company has finished
its competition, the men will be al
lowed to retire to the end of the field
until the parade and review is formed.
This event will probably be the last
formal appearance of the 1C O. T. C.
this year, and every effort will be
made to make it a success. It will
also be the last appearance before
their departure of the twenty-seven
men who are to go to the Reserved
Officers'" Training Camp at the Pre
sidio in San Francisco.
This is the fiiv.t year that Stanford
has included Decoration Day in its
college calendar and Dr. C. D. Marx,
acting president, has declared a Uni
versity holiday.
