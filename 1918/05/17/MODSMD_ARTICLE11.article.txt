# SUMMER JOBS OPEN FOR MEN IN SERVICE RESERVE
## 
### 
Summer jobs for college men under
Uie direction of the Public Service
Reserve, a division of the Department
of Labor, have begun to materialize,
according to information received by
Professor W. A. Cooper, who, with
Professor L. L. Burlingame, is in
charge of recruiting for the reserve at
Stanford. Two California industrial
establishments have applied to the San
Francisco office of the reserve for col
lege men to work during the summer
months.
College men are wanted in the as
sembly and machine shop departments
of the Holt Manufacturing Company,
located at Stockton. A minimum wage

of $3 a day is guaranteed with pro
portionate increases according to abil
ity. The Sunnical Canning Works of
Oroville is in need of men to work
in the fruit, with the understanding
that the highest wages will be paid.
Men who are interested in these jobs
can see Professor Cooper in his office,
Room 40, from 10 to 12 o'clock each
morning.
Enrollments in the Public Service
Reserve have been very light up to
date. The need of agricultural work
ers is especially emphasized by the
government, as agricultural officials
have said that students should under-
stand that this is a call for their
country, primarily to assist in the pro
duction of food. Professor Cooper
is anxious that Stanford shall make
a good showing in the number of en
rollments and desires that all men
who have agricultural jobs in view
sign with him immediately.
By signing an enrollment card, a
student does not obligate himself to
accept a position, but indicates that
he is interested. Jobs may be ob
tained for any portion of the summer.
Professor Burlingame lias been as
sociated with Professor Cooper in the
recruiting at Stanford, but as he ex
pects to engage in government re
search work in a short time, Professor
Coopor will take entire charge of the
matter.
