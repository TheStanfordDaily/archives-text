## 
### 
Alumni representatives of a number
of fraternities on the campus were
named today by the local chapters to
meet in inquiry concerning the one
jear freshmen dormitory rule which
was recently announced by President
Wilbur. These men are to meet in
San Francisco soon to discuss the rul
ing which apparently threatens the
life of several fraternities on the cam

pus in these war times according to
the opinion of many of the alumni.
The alumni represented wish it to
he thoroughly understood that they do
not intend or wish of start any agi
tation whatsoever, hut that they do
not understand the ruling and wish
to inquire into the workings and ef
fects of the action. War conditions.
according to the view of a number of
alumni will make such a ruling a dis*
jtinct hardship on many of the Stan-
I ford chapters of fraternities, and it is
possible that, an organized effort will
be brought into play to bring about
postponement of the going into effect
of the ruling until after the war.
