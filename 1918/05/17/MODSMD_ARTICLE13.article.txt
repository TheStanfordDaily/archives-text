# WARRING ITALY TO BE DISCUSSED
## 
### 
Bruno Roselli. who is to lecture
next Tuesday evening in the Little
Theater, is a lieutenant in the Italian
army, and has seen actual service at
the front. His subject. "The Aims
and Achievements of Italy in the
War," is one of which lie has first
hand knowledge.
Prior to his enlistment in the army,
Lieutenant Roselli was a professor of
Italian at Adelphi College, Brooklyn,
but when his country entered the
war, ho returned to volunteer, entered

the ranks as a private and has been
for some time at the scene of the fight
ing. At what seemed a slight lull
in the combat he came to America
with the permission of his govern
ment, on a brief leave of absence to
address the college students and facul
ties of this country.
Letters from the universities in the
East at which he has lectured accord
him nothing but the highest praise,
especially for his excellent use of the
English language, and his logical ar
guments.
