An all-University jolly-up is a wartime institution that ought to be a
huge success. When the haughty seniors agree to mingle with the lowly
freshmen to put on a jolly-up for everyone, their combined efrorts promise
to result in a get-together such as has not been seen on the Farm for some
time. Such co-operation is a measure of conservation both of time and ef
fort. and should be met with a response from all the dancing campus public.
The custom of class jolly-ups is one of most famous Stanford tradi
tions! and one of the best. It is one of things we hear about before we
reach the Quad, and it offers the best opportunity to get acquainted after
ward.
Of late jolly-ups have not found the favor they used to find among the
students though excellent music has been provided and the "eats" have been
choice. Stanford needs the custom of jolly-uping to promote a spirit of de
mocracy, and to provide an opportunity for an occasional informal get-to
gether. Keep up the good custom, and come out to the all-University jolly
up tomorrow evening.
