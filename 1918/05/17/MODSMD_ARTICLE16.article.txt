Ernest Wilson, who generously gave over his establishment for the benefit
of the Stanford Women's Unit for Civilian Relief in France yesterday. Re
ceipts from the venture were larger than had been expected, and a nice
sum was netted toward the sum necessary to send the unit over. We wish
to gratefully acknowledge the kindness of the Ernest Wilson Co., as well
as other business houses who have helped the cause.
