# PALO ALTO UNIT DAY PROCEEDS NET $206
## Returns from Sale at Wilson's Bring Total to $1300 Toward $2000 Fund 
### 
Proceeds from the Palo Alto unit
day came to $206, $53 of which was
raised by the sale of flowers at the
entrance of Wilson's Candy Store, ac
cording to Mrs. Carol Green Wilson,
chairman of the unit committee in
Palo Alto, this morning. A consider
able amount was taken in by sub
scriptions and donations by patrons.
The committe now has $1300 in
sight for the fund of $2000 with which
Palo Alto hopes to send Miss Edith
Mirrielees to France. Further work
will be actively carried on to swell
the fund for the total set.
The 319 th Engineers have offered to
put on their vaudeville, which they
produced two weeks ago at Sunny
vale, and raised nearly two hundred
dollars. Mrs. Wilson is arranging to
accept their invitation next Friday
night in Palo Alto. All of the skits
presented are very clever and a good
attendance from both Palo Alto and
the campus is counted upon.
Both Sacramento and Salinas have
asked for Stanford unit meetings to
aid them in starting the work of rais
ing funds. Assistant Registrar J. E.
McDowell is very doubtful as to the
feaslbilty of sending speakers to Sac
ramento but is enthusiastic about
Salinas. Plans will be worked out
during the week-end.
Mr. McDowell is particularly anxious
for all unit pledges taken on the cam
pus to be paid immediately as the unit
expects to leave June 1.
