# TATLOCK DISCUSSES CANTERBURY TALES
## 
### 
The University Philological Asso
ciation yesterday afternoon heard a
learned discussion of the chronology
of the Canterbury Tales, by Profes
sor J. S. P. Tatlock. of the English
department. He is considered an au
thority on this subject, and gave his
idea of the policy which should be
pursued in editing the tales.
Professor George Hem pi. of the

German department, also addressed
the association. He gave his interpre
tation of an Italian inscription which
has been recently discovered and
which he believes to have deciphered.
He claims that the inscription is in
Greek, although it has been formerly
believed to be in old Latin.
