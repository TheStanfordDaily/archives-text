# '18 and '21 Jolly-up to Rival Circus
## 
### 
Jolly-up fiends who have duly paid
, their 50 cents plus war tax admission
to the 1918-1921 jolly-up on Saturday
night will be entertained by some un
usual stunts in addition to some excep
tional refreshments on the sideboard.
At present the jolly-up committee re
fuses to divulge any of its plans re
garding this entertainment. Rumor
hath it that a tumbling act by E. It.
Knollin, instructor in Encina gymnas
ium, is being arranged for by the com
mittee. and Sells-Floto and A1 G.
Barnes' circuses will take second place.
It is hoped, however, that all tumbling
on the dance tioor will be left to pro
fessional entertainers and that there
will be no casualties among the danc
ers. Also the fact that the commit
tee let slip the information that the
dancers are to be entertained by one
of the popular singers of the senior
class is hardly a reason for anyone
refusing to attend.
The Big Push will be enlivened by
Wliitmer's Jazz Orchestra. Mr. and
Mrs. llewston have consented to act
as chaperones. Both the classes of 1918
and 1921 are striving to make this
dance a success.
