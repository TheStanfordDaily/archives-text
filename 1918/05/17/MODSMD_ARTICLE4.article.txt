# 1919 ANNUAL AND UNIVERSITY PRESS PRAISED BY LEMOS
## 
### 
"The 1910 Quad is necessarily,
through war conditions, a smaller edi
tion and a hook of less pages," said
Pedro J. Lemos, curator of the museum
and art gallery, in his statement of the
class annual.
"From a bookmaker's viewpoint,'
he continued, "this permits of a more
artistic book, for the criticism has al
ways been of college annuals that they
are too thick to be good proportion.
Therefore it's an ill wind that blows
no good and the 1910 Quad is admit
edlv the best makeup that has ever
been issued.
"The whole number is a University
production, as the printing and bind
ing in all its detail has been done at
the University Press and no better
work can be produced anywhere in
the West; as the Press staff and
equipment are of the highest order.
This feature alone," concluded Mr.
Lemos, "makes the 1919 Quad a not
able number, marking a new era in
all University printing."
The cover design, as described by
Mr. Lemos, shows a quadrangle arch
against a cardinal sky, and the pages
throughout the book are bordered
with an archway decoration. The art
work has been done by Miss Ruth
Taylor. '19, and W. E. Antrim, '19,
with four color inserts by Mr. Lemos.
These colored inserts are reproduc
tions of paintings made on the cam-
pus by Mr. Lemos. They have been
selecte d from the four compass points
of the quadrangle. One shows the
cardinal rimmed road leading to
the University entrance; another
shows a tree-framed view of the Uni
versity from the foothills, and the oth
er two subjects are campus archways,
one n moonlight scene and the second
a view from Roble way.
The paintings surpass even the
work previously made in past years by
Mr. Lemos for the University of Cali
fornia's Blue and Gold. Mr. Lemos
gives as the reason the fact that Stan
ford's environments are more pic
turesque and the coloring more inspir
ing. The pictures were also pro
duced on the University press and
form one of the main features of the
1919 Quad.

equipment are of the highest order.
This feature alone," concluded Mr.
Lemos, "makes the 1919 Quad a not
able number, marking a new era in
all University printing."
The cover design, as described by
Mr. Lemos, shows a quadrangle arch
against a cardinal sky, and the pages
throughout the book are bordered
with an archway decoration. The art
work has been done by Miss Ruth
Taylor. '19, and W. E. Antrim, '19,
with four color inserts by Mr. Lemos.
These colored inserts are reproduc
tions of paintings made on the cam-
pus by Mr. Lemos. They have been
selecte d from the four compass points
of the quadrangle. One shows the
cardinal rimmed road leading to
the University entrance; another
shows a tree-framed view of the Uni
versity from the foothills, and the oth
er two subjects are campus archways,
one n moonlight scene and the second
a view from Roble way.
The paintings surpass even the
work previously made in past years by
Mr. Lemos for the University of Cali
fornia's Blue and Gold. Mr. Lemos
gives as the reason the fact that Stan
ford's environments are more pic
turesque and the coloring more inspir
ing. The pictures were also pro
duced on the University press and
form one of the main features of the
1919 Quad.
