# DR. JORDAN
## 
### 
Stanford was stirred to deep indignation by the statements that came
out in the morning papers regarding the attack upon Dr. Jordan by the class
of 1873 of Cornell University. The Chancellor Emeritus of Stanford Univer
sity was rashly and unjustly accused of disloyalty in the national crisis, and
action was taken by his classmates to have the trustees of Cornel University
revoke the degrees that have been conferred on Dr. Jordan.
It i« difficult to undrstand bow anyone who has followed the actions of
the man who has devoted his life to the betterment of international relations
and the good of humanity in general, can conceive of his being disloyal. The
bare idea is absurd. Those who have followed the recent writings of Dr.
Jordan cannot be so dense as not to see the change the war has made in his
views. But the men who have made this indictment do not know him. The
man who is leading the movement has not seen Dr. Jordan for forty years.
His actions would indicate that neither had he heard of him for as long a
time.
Since the entrance of America into the war, Dr. Jordan, though a former
worker in the interest of world peace, has given unqualified support to the
furthering of the President's war alms. He has just returned to Stanford
from a lecturing tour to raise money for the National Red Cross fund, and has
himself subscribed generously. In response to a request from the govern
ment he has written articles for the Committee on Public Information. Dr.
Jordan has bought largely of all the Liberty Loans, and has two stars on the
service flag in his home.
Do these things bespeak disloyalty?
We wish it known that Stanford University is squarely behind its first
president, and that there are no doubts here as to his integrity. It is raore
than deplorable that such unfounded actions should be taken to darken' the
last years of a life given to service.
