# 1919 QUAD TO APPEAR ONE WEEK FROM TODAY
## Military Section Will Be Main Feature of Annual Book 
### 
One week from today, May 27, is
the date set for the appearance of the
1919 'War Quad."
President Wilbur has written an
interesting article for the administra
tion entitled "Stanford's Place in the
War." It is especially fitting in this
edition of the Quad as the dedication
and main sections are military. Ped
ro J. Lemos, curator of the Univers
ity Museum and Art Gallery has con
tributed greatly to the artistic qual
ity of the book with four full-paged
colored paintings of University j
scenes. These pictures are repro- ;
duced in four shades of color and are j
placed at the front.
An inspection of the Quad at the
University Press Shop shows that
the senior records will occupy six
pages Instead of the usual eight to ten
and that Fifty names Instead of the
ten to twelve will appear on the"In
Memoriam" page. The military sec
tion containing a record of Stanford
R. O. T. C. and pictures and history
of the first, second and third ambul
ance units, will be the main feature.
The nature of the cover is totally dif
ferent this year and will come as a
complete surprise next week.
The Josh section is a large one and
promises from all reports to be the
most popular. Of the twenty pages
six are devoted to snap shots; the
usual "razzes" and interesting com
ments take a large part and W. E.
Antrim. '19, has contributed a "His
tory of the Year," done in his charac
ter cartoon style.
