A LAKE THAT WAS
'Say, Maggie, have y' been up to
what used to be the lake lately?
Well, don't go unless y" enjoy havin'
Che creeps and dote on crawly things
and animals.
"Jose and I went up chere the oth
er night just before It got dark. We
started to wall* around the mud pudi
dle that's left in the center, and hon
estly, Maggie, the whole landscape
got up and. hopped. You know, ex
pollywogs that have just lost their
tails. You couldn't help squashing
half a dozen of 'em every step you
take.
"I started to go away and slipped
on a piece of mud, and fell down in
the reeds and lit on about a thousand
of the nasty things. They crawled
in my hair, and up my sleeves, and
down my back. I started to Bcream
and three of 'em hopped in my mouth.
If Joe hadn't picked me up I'd a
died right there, honestly I would.
Tadpoles are bad enough In the wa
ter, but when they come on land.
O my! !"
