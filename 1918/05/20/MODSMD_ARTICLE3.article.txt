# UNIVERSITY SUPPORTS DR. JORDAN
## Protest Filed Against Action of Cornell Class 
### 
The united Stanford student body
voiced its protest against the action
taken by the class of 1873 of Cornell
University against Dr. David Starr
Jordan, at a special meeting called at
one o'clock today. President Prior
presided at the meeting. In making
the motion for the resolution, J. F.
Elden, '16, spoke brilliantly in de
fense of Dr. Jordan and Arthur O.
Johnson, *15, who seconded the mo
tion, expressed the support of the stu
dent body in this attack. The fol
lowing resolution was passed by a
unanimous vote:
Resolved, that we, the assembled
Student Body of Stanford University,
protest against the injustice to Dr.
David Starr Jordan, Chancellor Emer
itus of Stanford University, in the
reported action of certain members of
the class of '73 of Cornell university
reflecting upon his loyalty to the
cause of America in this war.
While Dr. Jordan has always been
consistently an advocate of the meth
ods of peace rather than the methods
of war in the settling of international
differences, yet when the necessities
of the situation forced war upon this
nation, he publicly severed his con
nection with any organizations which
dil not endorse the national military
cantonments, and in public addresses,
advocated the prosecution of the war
and denounced in unmeasured terms

the policy and aims of Germany and
her allies.
Resolved, that we tender to Dr.
Jordan our sympathy for him in view
of this unjust attack, and express to
him our entire confidence in his loy
alty and patriotic devotion.
In response to the reported attack
against Dr. Jordan the alumni of Cor
nell university at Stanford took action
today and are sending a telegram of
protest to President Jacob Gould
Schurman, president of Cornell uni
versity, as follows:
"We the undersigned alumni of Cor
nell university protest against the ac
tion reported to have been taken by
some members of the class of 1873
impugning the loyalty of Dr. David
Starr Jordan, Chancellor Emeritus of
Stanford University. We. his Stan
ford associates for many years, desire
to testify to his life long devotion to
American ideals and to express our
entire confidence in his loyalty to his
country in the present war."
"The resolutions of the Cornell
class of '73, as reported, are obviously
the work of a very small group who
have acted without warning or at
tempt at verification."
In these words David Starr Jordan
today answered the charges reported
to have been made against him Sat
urday by the Cornell class of '73, when
a resolution was drawn up asking the
board of trustees of that university to
revoke all degrees which have been

conferred upon Dr. Jordan, for his al
leged anti-war sentiments.
"It is well known that I hoped for
some time that our work in Europe
would be mediation and restoration
and not war. The President held the
same view until the Tirpitz-Ludendorff
group got control in Germany," con
tinued Dr. Jordan. "This left the
neutral world no alternative but to
fight and fight with all our energy.
The day that war was declared I
declared publicly that 'the only way
out is forward.' I have given my full
este support to the President's plans
both for war and for ultimate peace.
"I know better than most people the
operations of the Pangermanist war
group and the iniquities of the Ger
man government in theory and prac
tice, and believe that civilization can
no longer endure half of self-govern
ing peoples and half of men driven in
herds by irresponsible rulers not of
their own choosing."
The resolutions drawn by the class
in New York are as follows: "Re
solved, it, is the sense of the class of
1873 of Cornell University that the
Board of Trustees should be and here
by is requested to rescind and revoke
their action in allowing a certificate
of graduation to David Starr Jordan,
and any degree since conferred upon
him."
The resolution was drawn by M.
W. Van Auken of Utica, and signed
