# RED CROSS BENEFIT HELD FRIDAY NIGHT IS HUGE SUCCESS
## 
### 
One hr.ndred and forty dollars was
cleared for the Stanford Auxiliary of
the Red Cross at the benefit dance
given Friday evening. Progressive
dancing between the Kappa Kappa
Gamma anl Delta Gamma houses, the
presence of the "Red Cross Girls,"
and the imported orchestras proved to
be strong drawing cards for both
"queeners" and "roughs." About two
hundred people were present.
At each of the two houses approxi
mately sixty dollars was made from
the sale of five-cont dance tickets
and punch. The reinander of the net
amount came from the rent of card
tables which were placed in the Chi
Omega house, and from donations.
The proceeds will be used for the
purchase of material for bandages.
Recently the local chapter found itself
destitute of funds. The twenty-five
cent drive a few weeks ago and the
benefit dance have now replenished
the treasury with sufficient money to
cover the rest of this year's expenses
and to give the chapter a good start
at the beginning of next year. The
Red Cross room in the Women's Club
House, where the work is carried on,
is open Monday, Tuesday, Thursday,
and Friday afternoons from 2 to 5.
