# Paulist Choristers will Sing Here Saturday, May 25
## 
### 
A great singing organization, known
as the "Paulist Choristers," is to give
a program in Assembly Hall on Satur
day, May 25, at 8:15. This chorus is
made up of one hundred boys' voices
under the leadership of the Rev.
Father William J. Finn.
The Paulist Choir is aiding stricken
France. Its mission is to raise money
for the restoration of the devasted
regions of that country. For this rea
son the tickets are comparatively high
priced, ranging from 50 cents to $2
plus the war tax.
Enthusiastic reviews of the work of
the Paulist Choristers in the East and

a recommendation by Walter Anthony,
musi'i critic on the San Francisco
Chronicle in the West, show that this
musical event probably will be the
greatest given before a Stanford audi
ence this year.
The coming of this juvenile choir
will be an ecclesiastical as well as an
esthetic event. When first organized,
it served as a choir in a Roman Cath
olic church in Chicago. It soon be
came nationally celebrated for the
marvel of its ensemble singing. More
than seven years ago the organization
began to travel with its gospel of pure
music. Not only in this country, but
abroad, the Paulist Choristers have
attained fame. They have sung in
Rome in the Vatican and won the first
prize in the international choral com
petition in Paris in 1912.
Father Finn, directing the choir, is
a graduate of the New England Con
servatory of Music, and has supple
mented his studies there with work in
London at Westminster, where the de
velopment of the art of the choral en
semble is known and taught. Accord
ing to the New York American, Father
Finn is a "nailer" in discovering and
illustrating musical effects.
