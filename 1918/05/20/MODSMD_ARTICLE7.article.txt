# ROSELLI WILL TELL ITALY'S AIMS
## 
### 
The aims and achievements of Italy
in the war are to be described to
morrow evening in the Little Theater
by Lieutenant Bruno Roselli, of the
Italian army. He is on furlough
from the army and is travelling
throughout America, presenting the
case of his native country. He will
be the first to speak exclusively of
Italy's part in the war to a Stanford
audience.
Ilefore the war Lieutenant Roselli
was a professor of Italian at Adelphi
College, Brooklyn, but upon the break

between his country and America, he
returned to enlist ns n private. He
has been for some time at the fight
ing front, and if. well acquainted
with conditions there. He believes,
as does his government, that Ameri
cans should face the facts, and it is
for that reason that he has been sent
to speak in the colleges and univer
sities of this country.
Lieutenant Roselli bears
recommendations from the schools
where he has spoken. President
Bumpus of Tufts College, Massachu
setts, has written to Preident Wilbur
as follows:
"Our students have just listened to
an informal address by Lieutenant
Bruno Roselli, who has recently come
from Italy with a story which he re
cites In a most simple and straight
forward manner,but which drives
home with telling effect the serious
ness of the task that this nation has
undertaken, the general lack of co
ordination, national and international,
that has characterized the efforts of
the Allies, and that has led to the
series of disasters with which we are
familiar, and which might be decis
ive unless we can bring the Ameri
can people to realize the inevitable
consequences of delay."
The lecture will begin at 7:30
o'clock.
