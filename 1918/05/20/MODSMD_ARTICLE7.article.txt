# ROSELLI WILL TELL ITALY'S AIMS
## 
### 
The aims and achievements of Italy
in the war are to be described to
morrow evening in the Little Theater
by Lieutenant Bruno Roselli, of the
Italian army. He is on furlough
from the army and is travelling
throughout America, presenting the
case of his native country. He will
be the first to speak exclusively of
Italy's part in the war to a Stanford
audience.
Ilefore the war Lieutenant Roselli
was a professor of Italian at Adelphi
College, Brooklyn, but upon the break

between his country and America, he
returned to enlist ns n private. He
has been for some time at the fight
ing front, and if. well acquainted
with conditions there. He believes,
as does his government, that Ameri
cans should face the facts, and it is
for that reason that he has been sent
to speak in the colleges and univer
sities of this country.
Lieutenant Roselli bears
recommendations from the schools
where he has spoken. President
