# WORK OF RED CROSS SAVED FRANCE SAYS CANADIAN SURGEON
## RYERSON OPENS DRIVE Gives First Speech of New Campaign for Funds at Assembly 
### 
"It is an open secret that France
would have been ready to make peace
when the Germans were nearing
Paris if is had not been for the work
of the Red Cross society among the
starving, dispirited families of the men
at the front," said Surgeon-General
Ryerson of the Canadian army in an
address at an assembly which was
held this morning to open the cam
pus campaign for funds for the na
tional Red Cross drive.
Surgeon-General Ryerson, one of
the most eminent medical men in
Canada, before the war was con
nected with the medical faculty of
the University of Toronto and is noted
as the founder of the Canadian Red
Cross and served in the Boer war be
fore his entrance in the present con
flict.
Opening his talk with a resume of
the part which the University of To
ronto has taken in the war Dr. Ryer
son stated that between twelve and
thirteen hundred university men have
entered the service with a casualty
proportion of 20 per cent. An officers'
training ramp and a ground school
of the Royal Flying Corps has been
established at the university where
men are trained for commssions.
"In the early part of the war," con
tinued Surgeon-General Ryerson, "the
French would have been beaten if it
had not been lor the British army.
As a matter of honor we entered to
defend Relgium. England has now
between six and seven millian men
fighting on the seven battle fronts.
Of these 426,000 have gone from Can
ada with 41,000 casualties and 128,000
wounded.
"Due to the advances of modern
sanitary precautions sickness in the
present war has been less than 5 per
cent, which is less than in ordinary
life. Death from wounds is less than
2 per cent. Modern surgery and ade
quate supplies for the treatment of
wounds has effected these reductions
in the death rate.
"By inoculation the grave danger of
tetanus lias been considerably less
ened. The soil of the battle zone in
alive wth spores of all diseases and
of tetanus in particular. Tho en
trance of these into the slightest
wounds causes terrible suffering and
death. Since the discovery of these
: rum for its treatment there have
been comparatively few deaths from
gas gangrene. By inoculations mod
ern science has also removed the
scourge of former wars, typhoid and
small pox.
"For the treatment of cases of
'mustard* gas the Red Cross has pro
vided portable baths by which the'
treatment of bathing and application !
of oil can be applied immediately and j
prevent great suffering. To supply
the field hospitals which are mobile
units with a staff of male nurses, the
Red Cross is maintainng advance de
posts and traveling kitchens.
Work of Civilian Relief
"The work of the Red Cross is not
only with the men at the front. It is
often questioned why we should un
dertake the task of civilian relief in
stead of the government. In the first
place, no government could maintain
a staff large enough to deal with the
problem and then it is an expression
of our sympathy with the soldiers,
this giving of aid to them and their
families.

"A particular phase of this work has
been in the care of the refugees re
turned through Switzerland. From
live to seven hundred thousand are
cared for by the Red Cross dailyâ€”fed,
treated, and what is as important, re
splrited. This is a work of repopu
lation for the hope of France Is in
lier children and the qnestion becomes
more grave with the decrease in the
birth rate."
In conclusion, Surgeon-General Ry
erson reiterated his statement that
the w r orfc of the Red Cross fe not one
of charity bnt of personal interest to
everyone who has relation or friend
in the service.
"It is an appeal to the heart, and
to our sympathy and compassioa. To
restore peace and prosperity we must
put our hand's in our pockets to help."
Dr. Ryerson was Introduced by Pro
fessor Pierce;, who spoke briefly on
the work of the Palo Alto chapter
among the families of the soldiers at
Camp Fremont. This evening Sur
geon-General Ryerson is to speak at
a big meeting of the Palo Alto Red
Cross.
