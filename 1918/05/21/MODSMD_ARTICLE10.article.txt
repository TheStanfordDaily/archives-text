# 1919 Year Book Makes Debut on Quad on Monday
## 
### 
Containing the first military sec
tion, anil the best josh, section of
years, the Stanford Quad will be put
on sale on the Law Steps next Mon
day morning. Since a limited num
ber of the "War Books" are being
printed, tickets are being sold by the
management at the Stanford Rook
store for $3.50. One of these paste
boards will be redeemable for a vol
ume of the annual when they are put
on sale, and will be given first, con
sideration.
The 1919 publication is unique from
every standpoint. The old cover de
sign has been broken away from, and
the new design, hand painted, is far
above the average. It is in the josh
section that editor S. E. Briggs has
scored a triumph, however. This
part of the book is being kept under
lock and key in the printshop, and
will only be revealed next Monday.
One feature of this section is a
"phony" list of events which have
taken place this year.
The military section abounds in
pictures of men in the service, while
the R. O. T. C. "regulars" and "con
scripts" are shown. The art work in
this part of the annual is excellent,
and a complete pictoral history of the
year from a military standpoint will
be given.
