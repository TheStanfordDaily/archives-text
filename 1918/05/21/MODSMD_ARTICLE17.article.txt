# YOU'LL WANT A QUAD
## 
### 
The 1919 Quad has weathered the past year of trying circumstances and
will be on sale on the Quadrangle Law steps next Monday. Last fall there
was a danger of the absence of a Quad, due to the small registration and the
apparent lack of interest of the Junior Class in its year-book. Then '19 met
and determined to put out its Quad and to support it. It did; the Junior dues
came in as faithfully as ever before, and the class and the Quad staff have
done their best to put out a War Quad full of interest.
We feel that the student body should now do its part on the date of sale.
To make the Quad come out on an even financial basis it is necessary that
almost every student now on the campus should buy a quad. No doubt in
years to come the present Quad will be sought after, but during present con
ditions many of us may feel that it is of no importance whether a Quad is
bought or not. You are not asked to buy a Quad unless you like it, but if you
do we feel it is almost a duty that you buy your own and not look at your
neighbor's. On the sale of the Quad this year depends the plans of future War
Quads; if the year-book is not supported this year we cannot expect it in the
coming war years. And its the oldest and most treasured of campus records.
