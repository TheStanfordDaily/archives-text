days, and what Encina should be at
the present time. His words were
enthusiastically applauded and en
joyed by all. The next man to talk
was Professor P. J. Treat, his sub
ject. the world war.

two athletic numbers. H. R. Trenkle,

exhibition of the game that made
Joe Stetcher famous. "Babe" Henry,
'21, and Mark Evans, '21, had those
present on their feet all the time
when they engaged in a boxing match
of two rounds. The program was
