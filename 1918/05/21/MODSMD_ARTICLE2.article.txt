# War Posters Are Here For Two Days
## Results From Competition in Several Western States Exhibited 
### 
An exhibition of all the "Thrift"
and "Winning the War" posters,
which have been made for the Na
tional Poster competition by the pub
lic and professional art schools of the
western division of the United States,
will be made in the Graphic Art
Class rooms of the University on
Tuesday and Wednesday of this week.
The posters are now in possession
of Professor A. 13. Clark. On Thurs
day they will be taken to San Fran
cisco and will be exhibited at the
Palace of Fine Arts, from May 23
to 31, and it is while there that
the winning posters will be picked
and the prizes awarded. The win
ners, of which there are twenty-four
in the several degrees and classes,
will be sent to New York City to
compete again for awards with post
ers from the other three divisions of
the United States.
These posters are the result of a
nation wide Poster Competition which
has been conducted in the United
States during the last five months.
The purpose of the campaign was to
assist the sale of War Saving Stamps
and to exhibit great ingenuity and
fertility of ideas regarding "Thrift"
and "Winning the War." Each post
er represents the concentrated energy
of some pupil for a number of weeks
on this idea and must have intensi
fied the war spirit and home saving
ideas.
The United States was divided into
four divisions in the competition, the
Western division comprising the
states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho,
Utah, Nevada, California, Arizona,
Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, and
New Mexico. The posters here now
include all those of the Western
group excepting those of California,
which are now on exhibit in San
Francisco, and of Utah,, which have
not yet arrived.
