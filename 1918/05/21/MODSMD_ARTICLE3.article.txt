# Queer Figures Amuse Campus at Noon Hour
## 
### 
Entertainment in profusion was
furnished the Stanford campus this
noon, when four members of the male
contingent, fantastically garbed in
bath-robes, and wearing anklets in the
form of tin pails, appeared on the
Row. The first number on the pro
gram was a race, each one being re
quired to crawl from the car tracks
to the Post Office. The mere fact
that one failed to maintain the cor
rect posture throughout the race, and
was forced to return and try again,
did not detract from the general
amusement.
From this side show and free
street parade, the entertainers retired
to the big show farther up the Row.
Here they favored four of the sorori
ties with bits of humor, song, and
terpsichorean displays.
To a stranger on the campus, this
might have been a strange and un
usual sight, but to one who is accus
tomed to the usual shows produced
by Hammer and Coffin for the general
amusement of the campus public, it
was a show well worth noting.
