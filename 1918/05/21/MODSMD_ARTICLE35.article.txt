# ORIGINAL BLOCK "S" ON WAY TO CAMPUS
## W.L. McLaine Sends First Stanford Emblem to University 
### 
In a letter received yesterday by
Miss Florence Mason, '18, W. L.
(Billy) McLaine, her uncle, sent the
history of the first Stanford block "S"
and stated that he was sending the
sweater from which the "S" was chos
en, as a present to the University.
Realizing that all larger Eastern
college athletes were given a uniform
insignia by their various colleges, Mr.
McLaine designed a block "S'' similar
to the Harvard "H" or the Yale "Y."
Quoting from the letters as follows,
Mr. McLaine writes:
"Upon completion of this "S",
which was made of white felt, Mrs.
Rice, our house mother, and mother
of Archie B. Rice, '95, and John B.
Rice, '97, sewed it on my sweater.
The sweater was taken to a Student
Body meeting a day or so later and
the "S" adopted as the "Stanford S."
I am, at this time, unable to state the
year of its adoption, but this may be
obtained from the minutes of the
meeting.
"Thinking that tlfe old sweater
might be considered a suitable tro
phy at Stanford, I am sending it to
you to be used as such.
"This particular "S" never lost a
series and but one game at the hands
of California."
As soon as the sweater arrives it
will be putin the hands of Assistant
Register J. E. McDowell for proper
disposal, probably in the museum.
Mr. McLaine is now living at Cas
per, Wyoming, and is superintendent
of the General Petroleum Corpora
tion. He was a member of the Phi
Gamma Delta Fraternity.
