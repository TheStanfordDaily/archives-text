Have You Seen the New Gillettes
Specially Designed for
the Fighting Man?
models were designed by members of the
Gillette Oi'ganization who have seen service with
the Colors and know what the soldier is up against.
Hundreds of officers and men are buying them—the
U. S. Service Set in metal case, and the new Khaki
covered sets for Uncle Sam's soldiers and officers.
The Gillette is the one razor for the man who is do
ing things—the one razor with world-wide use and
reputation.
When a man wants new Blades he can get them at
any Post Exchange or Y. M. C. A. Hut — here in
America or Overseas.
Our Paris Office carries stocks—is constantly sup
plying the American Expeditionary Forces. Gillette
Safety Razors and Blades on sale everywhere in
France, England, Italy and the Eastern battle fronts.
The Gillette Is She Real
rf Once-Over Razor' of the Fighting Man
THE Gillette Safety Razor has been car
ried in the breast pockets and in the kits and
ditty boxes of hundreds of thousands of
keen, alert lighting men on every front and
on every sea.
It's made good—under conditions that
have sent nearly every other kind of razor
into the rubbish heap.
The Gillette is bringing shaving comfort
to thousands of men in the Service —no mat
ter how w T ind-tanned and sun-burned.
Every man in the Service—or every man
who's going Overseas —needs a Gillette. The
new U. S. Regulations require the boys to
keep clean-shaved.
The Gillette makes it easy. It delivers a
velvet-smooth sha<e with any thickness of
beard or skin, with hard or soft or hot or
cold water. No strops or hones to clutter
up the kit. Blades always sharp, always
ready. No Stropping—No Honing.
