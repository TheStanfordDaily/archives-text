# SO-CALLED HONOR
## 
### 
"Honor," buried so deep in the mire and slush that not one speck of the
virtue was visible, was paraded on the Stanford campus today when Skull and
Snakes honor society took unto itself some new members.
So-called honor has assumed a peculiar aspect on the Farm, if today's
exhibition may be called an example. When college men so far forget their
dignity and "lose their self-respect as to carry into women's houses such
"humor" and "spirit," we believe there is something fundamentally wrong
with the "big men" in the University.
If such exhibitions be funny, and we have very grave doubts, let them at
least be confined to the honor spheres where they are appreciated. It is sup
posed that when permission is granted to send neophytes up to sorori y
houses to serve that they will at least observe the fundamentals which admit
men to association with decent people. An unfortunate condition is indicated
when the "biggest men" in the college show such lack of it.
All of which is entirely aside from the fact that public initiation cere
monies have been banned for some time, and that there was nothing private
about the Skull and Snakes feats on the Row.
