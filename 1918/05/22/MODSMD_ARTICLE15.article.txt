### 
Stanford sincerely mourns the death of Senator Folsom. The old gray
bearded gentleman who had been out on the track every afternoon of every
track season for almost a dozen years was the sincere friend of every man who
has been out for track during that period of time. He was a true sportsman
and a true Stanford man. Just before the big meet with California, for wh*ch
••Dad" Folsom had done a big share in preparing the Stanford the
varsity planned a dinner at which a loving cup was to be presented to Dad
It was at that time that Folsom first fell ill. His memory should long remain
honored by the inhabitants of Stanford Farm.
