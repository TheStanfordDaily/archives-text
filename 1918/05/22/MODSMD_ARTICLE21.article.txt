Professors A. M. Epinosa and S. A.
Smith of the Romanic Laguages de
partment, have organized classes in
English for the Italian and Mexican
speaking soldiers at Camp Fremont.
Others from the department have
been assisting in the instruction of
French at the camp from time to time,
but this is the first request that has
come for English classes.
