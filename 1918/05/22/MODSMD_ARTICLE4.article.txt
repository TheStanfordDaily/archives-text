# "Italy has American Ideals" Says Roselli
## Italian Lieutenant Points Out Common Motive in World War 
### 
"Italy is the vital factor in the war,"
aaid Lieutenant Roselli last evening
in his lecture, "The Aims and
Achievements of Italy in the War" at
the Little Theater. "The triple al
liance had helped Italy, and it could
have joined the other side if it had
wanted to, but it was too proud. It
had the same ideal of freedom and
democracy as has America.
"Imperfect co-operation has led to
the six failures of the allied forces.
The enemy has attacked each front
united, and each one of the allies has
tried to repulse it single handed."
In justifying Italy's action in with
drawing from the triple alliance,
Lieutenant Roselli said that his coun
try had joined the organization for
defence.
"The claim that Italy has betrayed
the Germans is an unfair one. The
Germans claim they are fighting a de
fensive war. This we all know i3
not true, and the Germans must be
met by force.
"Our aims are your aims," he con
tinued. "We are not a land-grabbing
nor an imperialistic nation, but are
trying to right the same wrongs which
America is.
"Italy has no guns, it has no steel,
little ammunition, yet it is fighting
on, and sending men to help the
Fl-ench. It has been given too little
thought by the other nations of the
allied family. They do not yet real
ize as Italy does that the defeat of
onf is the defeat of all, and the suc
cess of one is the success of all.
"The only thing which can make
the Italian soldiers realize that Amer
ica is really in the war, and is back
ing them," he concluded, "is for the
United States to send a few troops to
Italy. The moral effect on the sol
diers there would enable them to ac
complish wonders."
