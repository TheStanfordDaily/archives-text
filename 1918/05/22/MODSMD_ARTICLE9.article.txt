# PAULIST CHOIR TO SING MONDAY
## 
### 
One hundred men and boys, bent
011 a mission of mercy, will entertain
the people of this community next
Monday night when the Paulist Chor
isters from Chicago give their con
cert in the Assembly Hall. The pro
fits of the entertainment go to a
French aid fund.
If a reasonable percentage of truth
lies back of the enthusiastic reviews
of their work as criticised by the abl
est critics in the East and middle
West, this organization must be the
best of its kind in the world.
Won Honors at Paris
This ensemble of singers won first
prize in the international competition
held in Paris in 1912, in which 497
singing organizations took part. They

also sang at the Vatican for the Pope.
Master William Hallissey, one of the
soloists, is known as "the boy Galli-
Curci."
Sixty of the choir are boys under
fifteen years of age. They .have
adopted the uniform of the French
; Hussars and the entire choir stands
â–  at salute when singing "La Marceil
; laise."
To Sing National Anthem
A special feature of the concert will
be the singing of the "Star Spangled
Banner," with which they open and
close their recitals.
A great deal of Russian music and
several old English carols are in
cluded in the program which will be
1 presented by the Choristers Monday
| night.
