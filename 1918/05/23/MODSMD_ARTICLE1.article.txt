# DR. MARX TALKS ON WAR'S RELATION TO ENGINEERING WORK
## DISCUSSES PROBLEMS TO BE CONFRONTED Transportation One of the Vital Issues That Must Be Solved 
### 
"The engineering problem of the
war is one of transportation; trans
portation of material into the ground,
of materials from mines and manu
facturing centers to the ports and
from the ports overseas to the front
and from the front to the enemy."
Thus briefly did Professor C. D. Marx
characterize a problem of many
phases in his talk on "Engineering
Problems and Achievements of the
War" this morning in the Little The
ater.
"In the first step of the problem of
transportation in the transporting of
materials into the ground," said Dr.
Marx, "the engineer is concerned with
providing labor-saving devices for
farm labor. American agricultural
machinery is the best in the world.
The farm tractor alone, which in a
modified form, is doiiffe service at the
front, is one of the greatest labor
saving devices of the age. In connec
tion with the question of agricultural
engineering much was done before
the war to increase farming produc
tion and in this phase of the work
three Stanford professors, J. M. Still
man, P. Z. Swain, and S. W. Young
did valuable work in tests of the use
of potash as a fertilizing agent. It
seems unnecessary to speak of the
work of another Stanford engineer,
Herbert Hoover, in the work of the
food administration.
"In providing transportation for ma
terials from the centers of produc
tion to the ports, engineers havo been
called upon to provide adequate
means for the greatly increased flow
of material. The administrative side
of the railroads broke down under the
strain and was subsequently taken
over by the government. It Is stated
therefore disqualified, the committee
will relieve the remaining two mem
bers of the Council of their responsi
bility for investigating and making
recommendations in this case.
Further, in view of the unusual cir
cumstances brought about by the war,
the withdrawal of a large number of
upperclassmen from the University
and consequently changing personnel
of the Council, the Committee feels
that it is wise to withdraw the au
thority delegated some years ago un
til the end of the war, or until such
time as conditions shall become more
nearly normal.

Chairman Student Affairs Committee.
The ruling does not affect student
government by the women and the
Women's Conference and Council will
continue to act in their usual capacity.
Only the Men's Conference and Coun
cil lost the authority vested in them
several years ago to discipline mem
bers of the University who break reg
ulations, and this authority will be
taken over by the Student Affairs
Committee.
