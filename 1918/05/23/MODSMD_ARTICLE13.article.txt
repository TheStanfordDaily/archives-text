# STUDENT CONTROL GOES
## 
### 
After a long and precarious journey which ended in failure, due to a
mixture of causes, student government has been withdrawn from the men of
the University "for the period of the war or until such time as the conditions
shall become more nearly normal."
It is with exceeding regret that we admit, student government at Stan
ford to be a failure, but for some time the obvious failure of indents to
realize the responsibilities placed upon them has made such action as was
taken inevitable. The most regretable part of the action was that it did not
come from the students themselves, most of whom realize that student regu
lation at the present time is well nigh impossible. As a matter of fact, for the
past week a proposal that the faculty take over student government, for the
period of the war at least, has been on foot, instigated by students who have
felt the impossibility of student government founded on the basis on which it
has recently been. It is unfortunate that student action was not started
sooner, for undoubtedly the student body respect could have been in some
measure spared had it recognized itself at fault and voluntarily given over
student control.
Nor do we believe the entire fault for the failure to rest upon the student
body. Under the existing system by which no one is definitely responsible,
failure is inevitable. Prom the administration some power is delegated to
the faculty, and then a bit to the students. The student is limited by regula
tions over which he has no control, and in which he does not, in many cases,
believe. Yet he is expected to be responsible for their enforcement. To bo
sure he is only in a limited sense responsible, for only a sphere of
action has been delegated to him. This by no means excuses the student tor
abusing or neglecting the authority given him, but somewhere in the system
there is missing the final responsibility for government. Without which sac
cess is impossible.
It may be that the University fails in its duty to the student in not making
of him the kind of man who will assume the responsibilities of good citizen
ship. It may be that there is something lacking in the student which makes
him unfit to govern himself, but in such case, might it not be the object of a
university to give him that training he needs? We don't pretend to answer
these questions.
But whatever the reason for it, since student government was no longer
student government after all, we are not reluctant to see the husks blown
away. .

felt the impossibility of student government founded on the basis on which it
has recently been. It is unfortunate that student action was not started
sooner, for undoubtedly the student body respect could have been in some
measure spared had it recognized itself at fault and voluntarily given over
student control.
Nor do we believe the entire fault for the failure to rest upon the student
body. Under the existing system by which no one is definitely responsible,
failure is inevitable. Prom the administration some power is delegated to
the faculty, and then a bit to the students. The student is limited by regula
tions over which he has no control, and in which he does not, in many cases,
believe. Yet he is expected to be responsible for their enforcement. To bo
sure he is only in a limited sense responsible, for only a sphere of
action has been delegated to him. This by no means excuses the student tor
abusing or neglecting the authority given him, but somewhere in the system
there is missing the final responsibility for government. Without which sac
cess is impossible.
It may be that the University fails in its duty to the student in not making
of him the kind of man who will assume the responsibilities of good citizen
ship. It may be that there is something lacking in the student which makes
him unfit to govern himself, but in such case, might it not be the object of a
university to give him that training he needs? We don't pretend to answer
these questions.
But whatever the reason for it, since student government was no longer
student government after all, we are not reluctant to see the husks blown
away. .
