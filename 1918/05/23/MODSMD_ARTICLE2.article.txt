# Better Pictures and Cuts in Quad
## New Printing Process Gives Added Clearness to Productions 
### 
Pictures and cut contained in this
year's Quad will set a new mark in
quality and clearness and a higher
achievement in University printing,
according to Paul Schleusner, who is
in charge of the University Press
pressroom and superintending the
printing of the year-book.
In past annuals the unigraph meth
od of reproducing pictures has been
employed, but in the 11)19 Quad the
pictures have been printed on a
Miehle printing press machine.
Their clearness are due to much care
ful work, as in each original the shad
ed parts have been mounted on sheets
of paper three times, the background
twice and all high lights once. This
process necessitates the cutting out
and pasting by hand on each of the
original pictures.
All organizations and class oflicers'
pictures are mounted on a gray mat.
The effect of this in the finished book
is very pleasing and with the light
gray page borders add a very artistic
touch to the whole.
Head pages announcing the various
departments are also in gray toned
prints. They represent scenes of the
University taken from the original
pictures.
