"Well," said Smith as he walked
Into my office, "I've wound up all my
business Interests."
"What for?" 1 said as 1 rose to
greet the man I had known In my
home city years before.
"So I could offer myself If I'm worth
having. I've got to get Into the game.
Anything useful and human. I'm
ready for marching orders."
"Worth having?" I echoed. "You've
dropped like a God-send. We've got
the biggest man-sized job you ever
tions. You're going straight with the
Home Service. Something useful and
human? Why, In a week this thing
will be gripping you so that you'll eat
and sleep It 1"

The Home Service Section of a big
Red Cross chapter was In session. As
Smith and 1 arrived they were discuss
ing the problem of a soldier's wife and
six children found living In two tene
ment rooms in a building that rad been
condemned because of a leaky roof,
mouldy floor and lack of tire protection.
They had sold most of their furniture
piece by piece for current living ex
penses. The children had no change of
clothing. There was no Income and, be
cause of the mother's condition, no pos
sibility of one, except the expected allot
ment and allowance, which even when
it came would not entirely meet the cost
of living in the city. The Home Service
worker had given a generous sum of
money to meet the urgent needs, arid
now the committee was planning to
rent better quarters, move the fami
ly, secure medical and nursing atten
tion for the woman, outfit them nil
with clothing and furniture and keep
regularly In touch with the family.

In Smith's next case the Home Serv
ice Section and the tuberculosis society
had arranged hospital care for a man
discharged because of tuberculosis
contracted "In the line of duty."
Some attorney had fold him he would
get compensation for him on h fifty-fif
ty basis, but the lawyer-member of the
Home Service Section helped him fill
out the proper form which the Red
Cross office supplied and assured him
that no discharged soldier or soldier's
beneflclnrv should ever pay for col-

A member of the women's uniformed
corps drove us In her machine out to a
camp where there are 30,000 men.
Here we met the Red Cross Home
Service man. We didn't take his time
—we Just watched him. One moment
he was helping >1 man to fill out dupli
cate allotment blanks; the next he
was arguing the merits of Insuring to
the limit; the next he was wiring a
Home Service Section to visit a man's
family; next he was going with a boy
who had received ti tragic telegram
from home to see the commanding offi
cer about a leave of absense; then he
was speeding on his way a poor fellow
discharged because of permanent In
jury; then we saw him talking to a
soldier and a girl wife at the hostess
house; and as the shadows fell he was
closeted with a worried chap, who was
telling him about an Impending mort
gage foreclosure and an expected baby.

Later the same evening we saw hln
stand up in the Liberty theater and,
his eyes glowing with the service pic
ture in his own mind and his voice
ringing with the conviction of his own
enthusiasm, tell a thousand young fel
lows what Home Service is. He paint
ed homes made happier by Home Serv
ice—told of friends tor fighters' fami
lies found by the Ked Cross—pictured
devoted Home Service workers light
ing the country's battles this side the
trenches. When he ended some fellow
struck up "Keep tin- Home Fires Cum
ing."
We were silent for a long while on
the way home, Smith and L Finally
Smith broke out:
"Can 1 do it? The sort of thing—
camp service, you call It? Why, thatV
where I want to be—at the point ot
first contact with those living prob
lems. Pershing was right when he
said, 'The thing most needful to the
American fighting forces overseas is
anything and everything that will con
tribute to the morale of the men In
service.'
"Home Service —1 see it now—
means morale. When can 1 go to
work!"
