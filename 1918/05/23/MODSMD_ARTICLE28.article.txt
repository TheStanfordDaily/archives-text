# THE 						TRAIN THAT SAVED A NATION
## How the Red Cross Helped Roumania. 
### 
Have you heard of what happened
in Roumanla when that stricken nation
stood in rags and starving before the
shocked eyes of the world? We had
thought ourselves grown used to trag
edies until this greater horror struck
a blow that 'roused still untouched
syrrr^thies.
And yet we felt so helpless, you and
I, so terribly weak in our ability to of
fer aid. But were we? After all,
were we not the very ones who car
ried new life and hope to the heart o£
Roumanla? You shall be your own
judge.
Fighting with the desperation of de
spair, the shattered Roumanian army
still struggled to beat off the Kaiser's
bloody Huns, who were mercilessly
trampling the life out of the little
kingdom. And the Kaiser smiled bru
tally as he saw his wolves at work
and knew that from behind the lines,
attacking the fighting men of Rouma
nla from the rear, entering the homes
where mothers clung to the frail, dis
torted forms of their babies—was star
vation.
No country around Roumanla could
help her—and America was too far
away. Thousands would die before
supplies held in our own country could
lie sent her.
Hope was gone. Death by hunger
and by the dripping sword of the Kai
ser was closing in. A brave little na
tion was being torn to pieces.
Then came the miracle. One morn
ing the streets of Jassy, the war capi
tal of Roumanla, swelled with sounds
of rejoicing. A city where the day he
fore there was heard nothing but the
wails of the starving and the lamenta
tions of those mourning their dead
now was awakened by shouts of Joy.
You, my friend; you who have help
ed in the heroic work of the American
fled Cross, had gone to the rescue of
Roumanla. A train of 31 big freight
cars packed to their utmost capacity
ivlth food, clothing and medicine, tons
upon tons of it, had arrived In Jassy
after making a record breaking trip
from the great store houses of the
American Red Cross In Russia. Other
trains followed it; thousands were fed
and clothed and nursed back to health.
For weeks and even to this day the
brave people of Roumanla are being
cared for In countless numbers by our
own Red Cross.
So was Roumanla helped, and when
history records how this last fragment
of a sturdy nation was kept out of the
hands of the terrible Huns it will give
the victory to your American Red
Cross.

Roumanla. A train of 31 big freight
cars packed to their utmost capacity
ivlth food, clothing and medicine, tons
upon tons of it, had arrived In Jassy
after making a record breaking trip
from the great store houses of the
American Red Cross In Russia. Other
trains followed it; thousands were fed
and clothed and nursed back to health.
For weeks and even to this day the
brave people of Roumanla are being
cared for In countless numbers by our
own Red Cross.
So was Roumanla helped, and when
history records how this last fragment
of a sturdy nation was kept out of the
hands of the terrible Huns it will give
the victory to your American Red
Cross.
Have you heard of what happened
in Roumanla when that stricken nation
stood in rags and starving before the
shocked eyes of the world? We had
thought ourselves grown used to trag
edies until this greater horror struck
a blow that 'roused still untouched
syrrr^thies.
And yet we felt so helpless, you and
I, so terribly weak in our ability to of
fer aid. But were we? After all,
were we not the very ones who car
ried new life and hope to the heart o£
Roumanla? You shall be your own
judge.
Fighting with the desperation of de
spair, the shattered Roumanian army
still struggled to beat off the Kaiser's
bloody Huns, who were mercilessly
trampling the life out of the little
kingdom. And the Kaiser smiled bru
tally as he saw his wolves at work
and knew that from behind the lines,
attacking the fighting men of Rouma
nla from the rear, entering the homes
where mothers clung to the frail, dis
torted forms of their babies—was star
vation.
No country around Roumanla could
help her—and America was too far
away. Thousands would die before
supplies held in our own country could
lie sent her.
Hope was gone. Death by hunger
and by the dripping sword of the Kai
ser was closing in. A brave little na
tion was being torn to pieces.
Then came the miracle. One morn
ing the streets of Jassy, the war capi
tal of Roumanla, swelled with sounds
of rejoicing. A city where the day he
fore there was heard nothing but the
wails of the starving and the lamenta
tions of those mourning their dead
now was awakened by shouts of Joy.
You, my friend; you who have help
ed in the heroic work of the American
fled Cross, had gone to the rescue of
