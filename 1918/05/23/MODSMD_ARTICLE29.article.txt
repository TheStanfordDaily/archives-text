### 
Since the government desires that
every American citizen be given an
opportunity to learn the facts regard
ing the causes of America's entry into
the war and to see clearly the aims
and motives of the Administration,
the committee on public information,
appointed by President Wilson, has
gathered together thirty-three book
lets and articles, written by authori
ties on the various subjects for the
use of applicants.
By mailing a card to the committee
in Washington, any two of the books
or articles will be sent free of charge.
The list contains such titles as "How
the War Came to America" (with nine
foreign translations); "The Presi
dent's Flag Day Address," "Conquest
and Kultur," "Why America Fights
Germany," "The German War Code,"
"National Service Handbook," and
"Friendly Words to the Foreign-
Born.''
The books are written by such
men as President Wilson, Dana C.
Munro of Princeton University, Secre
taries Franklin A. Lane and Newton

Lansing, ex Secretary of State Elihu
Root, and Professor J. S. P. Tatlock
of Stanford University.
