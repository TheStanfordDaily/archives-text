# STUDENT CONTROL TAKEN FROM STANFORD MEN FOR PERIOD OF WAR
## Curtis Discusses Navy Possibilities Urges Men of Age to Enter Training Station June 17 Officers Are Needed 
### 
Before a large and enthusiastic au
dience, Ensign Wallace Curtis, *17, re
vealed the requirements, both intel
lectual and physical, to those who in
tend to enter the naval reserve in his
informal talk last night in the En
gineering building. He has been ap
pointed by the naval commandant to
secure Stanford men for the training
station at Mare Island on June 17.
"Men who are subject to draft in
June are those who are especially
sought for, but those who still have
a year in college are urged to stay and
complete as much of their course as
possible," Curtis explained.
Men who go to Mare Island on June
17 will not be required to enter into
a detention camp, neither will they
be required to take preliminary ex
aminations. They will enter directly
into the officers' class and take up a
I course which will last twelve weeks.
The navigation course offered will be
one that is given only in the naval
school. This means that no course
like it is given at the various other
navigation schools.
Ensign Curtis will be on the campus
age those pho planned to go to a
school for navigation training. He
considers them entirely unnecessary
and a waste of time, for the course in
the navy is taught by a different
method.
Engineering students who have
completed their courses here will be
well qualified for an engineering en
signship, while those who have had
a good grounding in mathematics, in
cluding trigonometry and a knowl
edge of blue jackets' manual will be
capable of passing the preliminary
examinations for a deck ensign.
Ensign urtis whl be on the campus
for a day or so to answer questions
and inform the men who are figuring
on taking advantage of this oppor
tunity. Men should sign up imme
diately with him, so that provisions
may be made at once. Ensign Curtis
may be found in the Engineering
building, in G. H. Marx's office.
