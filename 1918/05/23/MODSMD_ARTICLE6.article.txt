## ARE ON MISSION OF AID TO HELP ALLIES Chorus of 100 Men and Boys to Give Concert in Assembly Hall 
### 
On a mission of mercy to aid strick-
en France and Belgium, the Paulist
Choristers will visit Stanford next
Monday evening and give their regul-
ar concert in the Assembly Hall.
Trained for many years by the Rev.
Father William J. Finn, this choir of
100 men and boys has achieved the
distinction of being the leading sing
ing organization of its kind in the
world. It was originally organized as
a choir in the Roman Catholic church
at Chicago, but soon became so well
known that it has been traveling ever
since.
Many of the boys in the organiza
tion are under fifteen years of age
but their education is being con
tinued on their travels. Their lead
er, Father Finn, is an educator as
well as a musician and choir direc
tor, and is taking care of the young
man's education. Added to this they
have the advantage of having trav
eled over all the important countries
of the world.
Since the entrance of American into
the war, the Paulist Choristers have
devoted their entire time to traveling
for the benefit of the French Aid
Fund and other societies for the relief
of the stricken districts of France.
Their program covers every grade
of music from the intricate fugue by
Bach to the tuneful legends by
Tschaikowsky, and from a stupendous
chorus from Handel's "Messiah" to
a rare arrangement of "The Mocking
Bird." This latter arrangement was
made by Father Finn, the choir con
ductor.
