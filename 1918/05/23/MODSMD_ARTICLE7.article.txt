# Training School Needs More Men
## Men May Still Enlist in Fourth Officers' Training School From Stanford 
### 
That the quota to the fourth offi
cers' training camp has not been sup
plied and that additional candidates
will be accepted from Stanford as
late as Saturday, was the information
received by Captain Parker yesterday
from General Morrison, commanding
general at Camp Fremont. Men who
satisfy the requirements of the school
should see Captain Parker immedi
ately.
Candidates for commissions in the
school have to enlist in the army for
the duration of the war. If the division
to which they are assigned moves, the
candidates serve as privates until the
school is resumed. If they fail to
graduate from the school, the men
automatically assume the rank of pri
vates. If they are recommended for
a commission, the candidates serve
as sergeants until a vacancy occurs.
Twent-seven men were sent from
Stanford to the camp. They have
been in training about a week under
infantry instructors, and will finish
their course in three months
