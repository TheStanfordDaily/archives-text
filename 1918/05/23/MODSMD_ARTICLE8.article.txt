# STATE SCARCITY OF RESPONSIBLE UPPER CLASSMEN AS CAUSE
## 
### 
Student control at the Unnversity
was taken away by the Committee on
Student Affairs for the period of the
war, in a letter sent to R. O. Bullis,
'18, President of the Men's Student
Conference and Chairman of the
Men's Student Council. The action is
taken in view of the fact that there
are not enough responsible upper
classmen in the University to handle
the student affairs, and that the per
sonnel of the Student Council is con
stantly changing, according to the let
ter.
The immediate cause of the action
as given out is that a matter under
consideration by the Student Affairs
Committee involves one member of
the Council, and two more of the
Council have gone into the service,
leaving but two members to act in
this particular case.
Marx Approves
Acting President Professor C. D.
Marx in a statement given out this
afternoon fully approved of the action
taken by the Student Affairs Com
mittee. His statment is as follows:

"In view of the state of affairs re
ported to me by Professor Leslie laat
night some such action was necessary,
and that taken seemed to be the only
course. I fully approve of the ac
tion taken by the Student Affairs
Committee."
