# STATE SCARCITY OF RESPONSIBLE UPPER CLASSMEN AS CAUSE
## 
### 
Student control at the Unnversity
was taken away by the Committee on
Student Affairs for the period of the
war, in a letter sent to R. O. Bullis,
'18, President of the Men's Student
Conference and Chairman of the
Men's Student Council. The action is
taken in view of the fact that there
are not enough responsible upper
classmen in the University to handle
the student affairs, and that the per
sonnel of the Student Council is con
stantly changing, according to the let
ter.
The immediate cause of the action
as given out is that a matter under
consideration by the Student Affairs
Committee involves one member of
the Council, and two more of the
Council have gone into the service,
leaving but two members to act in
this particular case.
Marx Approves
Acting President Professor C. D.
Marx in a statement given out this
afternoon fully approved of the action
taken by the Student Affairs Com
mittee. His statment is as follows:

"In view of the state of affairs re
ported to me by Professor Leslie laat
night some such action was necessary,
and that taken seemed to be the only
course. I fully approve of the ac
tion taken by the Student Affairs
Committee."

Mr. Richard Bullis,
Chairman Men's Student Council,
Stanford University.
Dear Mr. Bullis:
Some matters have recently come
to the notice of the Committee on
Student Affairs that under normal
circumstances would demand immedi
ate attention of the Men's Student
Council. In view of the fact that two
members of the Council have with
drawn from the University for duty
at Camp Fremont, and that one of
the remaining members is involved in
the affair under consideration, and is
that a decrease in efficiency from a
95 per cent standard to 45 per cent
occurred in the transportation of steel
alone, due to the congested conditions
of the railroads. This was remedied
and the situation restored to normal,
after the fourteen-day interim pre
scribed by the government.
"At the ports the engineering prob
lem becomes the shipping question.
The fabricated ship is an enterprise
which had its start before the war,
but which received its great impetus
when the necessity came for speed in
construction. The different parts of
the fabricated ship are built away
from the port and are then assem
bled at the ways and launched. Many
ships are being built in this way now
and are proving very successful.
"A technical engineering problem
which has been recently,"
continued Dr. Marx, "is the applica
tion of the welding process which has
been used successfully in pipe con
struction to the welding of ship plates
in place of riveting. An apparent ad
vantage in this process over riveting
is the loss of weight which occurs in
making the holes for the rivets. It
is estimated that at least 10 per cent
in material can be saved.
"To house the fighting force of the
country in camps in this country it
was necessary to build thirty-two
towns, each capable of housing from
40,000 to 50,000 men. In spite of the
fact that never before has such a con
struction job been attempted, it has
been done successfully and cheaply.
It is interesting to note that in build
ing Camp Fremont the cost per man
was $73.24. or less than average. Two
Stanford men, Shirley Baker, '95, and
E. E. Carpenter, '98, were members of
the firm which undertook the con
struction contract. At Camp Lewis
C. A. Strong, '08, and P. H. Van Etten,
'09, were the water and sewage con
tractors. •
