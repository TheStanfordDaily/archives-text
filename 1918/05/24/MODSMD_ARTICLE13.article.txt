# 600 COPIES OF 1919 WAR QUAD GO ON SALE MONDAY
## ORIGINALITY WILL MARK THIS YEAR'S BOOK Dedication is Military, and Picture of Every Student Is Shown 
### 
The 1919 War Quad, to go on sale
next .Monday morning on the law
steps, will be one of the most valu
able and thorough reviews in pictures
and records of Stanford's part in the
great war, and its history for the past
year, yet published. Too, this is prob
ably the last complete class annual
which will be published during the
war,' according to the views of the
management of the 1919 Quad.
It is only after much difficulty and
hard work on the part of the staff
that a Quad has been completed. The
book was outlined and the work begun
last October, but since then there
have been many changes in University
life. Of the 1700 students then en
rolled, there are but 900 left, yet the
original plans for the Quad have been
successfully carried out.
"Although smaller than usual, this
year's book in quality, history, artis
ticness, and variety, stands above the
average. From the cover design,
which is hand-painted and described
as showing a quadrangle arch against
a cardinal sky, through every section,
thp 1919 class annual promises to be
different and original." according to
the editor, Sam Rriggs.
As is fitting to a "war number" the
dedication and main features are mil
itary. The administration section is
headed by an interesting article writ
ten by President Wilbur entitled
'Stanford's Place in the War." The
military department itself contains a
lull record of Stanford R. O. T. C. and
pictures and histories of the first, sec
ond, and third ambulance units. These
pictures and records were secured
through the efforts of the editor, S. E.
Briggs, '19, and have been received
from camps and units in this country
and Europe.
An excellent collection of action
pictures are found in the athletic
sections which arc covered in forty
eight pages. Full paged illustrations
of the teams are given and pictures
of individual members and coaches.
The artistic quality of the book is
well set by the four full paged colored
paintings, placed at the front. They
are contributed by Pedro J. Lemos,
curator of the Museum and Art Gal
lery. Page borders, fitting to Stan
ford's architectural design, are on
each page and are very effective and
different from any others used. Page
headings to the departments are gray
toned University scenes and not the
usual pen and ink drawings. The pic
ture of every student enrolled since
last fall appears In the book.
The josh section promises to be one
of the best ever. A cartoon history of
the year by W. E. Antrim, '19, is fea
tured here.
So far 1»0 copies of the Quad have
been sold at the bookstore. With a
deduction of copies for the senior
class, this will leave 600 books for
sale on Monday. Becausc of its re
markable record in Stanford pictures
and history, merchants in Palo Alto
uav( offered to buy several hundred
of the copies to be put on sale after

'21. W. A. C. —Mildred Pollak, Mar
jorie Gay, Eliae Phillips.
Mrs. Ernest Brandsten has an
nounced that a 100 yards free style
which was requested, will not be held
unless the club will agree not to en
ter more than four contestants in any
race. If an agreement is made, Stan
ford will enter Estelle Nisson, '18,
Mildred Maurer, '21, and Beatrice
Caughey, '21, in the century.
The meet is to be open to all women.
The 1919 War Quad, to go on sale
next .Monday morning on the law
steps, will be one of the most valu
able and thorough reviews in pictures
and records of Stanford's part in the
great war, and its history for the past
year, yet published. Too, this is prob
ably the last complete class annual
which will be published during the
war,' according to the views of the
management of the 1919 Quad.
It is only after much difficulty and
hard work on the part of the staff
that a Quad has been completed. The
book was outlined and the work begun
last October, but since then there
have been many changes in University
life. Of the 1700 students then en
rolled, there are but 900 left, yet the
original plans for the Quad have been
successfully carried out.
"Although smaller than usual, this
year's book in quality, history, artis
ticness, and variety, stands above the
average. From the cover design,
which is hand-painted and described
as showing a quadrangle arch against
a cardinal sky, through every section,
thp 1919 class annual promises to be
different and original." according to
the editor, Sam Rriggs.
As is fitting to a "war number" the
dedication and main features are mil
itary. The administration section is
headed by an interesting article writ
ten by President Wilbur entitled
'Stanford's Place in the War." The
military department itself contains a
lull record of Stanford R. O. T. C. and
pictures and histories of the first, sec
ond, and third ambulance units. These
pictures and records were secured
through the efforts of the editor, S. E.
Briggs, '19, and have been received
from camps and units in this country
and Europe.
An excellent collection of action
pictures are found in the athletic
sections which arc covered in forty
eight pages. Full paged illustrations
of the teams are given and pictures
of individual members and coaches.
The artistic quality of the book is
well set by the four full paged colored
paintings, placed at the front. They
are contributed by Pedro J. Lemos,
curator of the Museum and Art Gal
lery. Page borders, fitting to Stan
ford's architectural design, are on
each page and are very effective and
different from any others used. Page
headings to the departments are gray
toned University scenes and not the
usual pen and ink drawings. The pic
ture of every student enrolled since
last fall appears In the book.
The josh section promises to be one
of the best ever. A cartoon history of
the year by W. E. Antrim, '19, is fea
tured here.
So far 1»0 copies of the Quad have
been sold at the bookstore. With a
deduction of copies for the senior
class, this will leave 600 books for
sale on Monday. Becausc of its re
markable record in Stanford pictures
and history, merchants in Palo Alto
uav( offered to buy several hundred
of the copies to be put on sale after
