The 1919 War Quad, to go on sale
next .Monday morning on the law
steps, will be one of the most valu
able and thorough reviews in pictures
and records of Stanford's part in the
great war, and its history for the past
year, yet published. Too, this is prob

which will be published during the
war,' according to the views of the
management of the 1919 Quad.
It is only after much difficulty and

that a Quad has been completed. The
book was outlined and the work begun

original plans for the Quad have been
successfully carried out.
"Although smaller than usual, this
year's book in quality, history, artis
ticness, and variety, stands above the
average. From the cover design,

as showing a quadrangle arch against
a cardinal sky, through every section,
thp 1919 class annual promises to be
different and original." according to
the editor, Sam Rriggs.
As is fitting to a "war number" the
dedication and main features are mil

headed by an interesting article writ

'Stanford's Place in the War." The
military department itself contains a
