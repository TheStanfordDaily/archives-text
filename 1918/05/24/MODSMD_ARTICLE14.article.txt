# PAULIST CHORISTERS PRAISED BY CRITICS
## Choir Meeting With Success In Larger Cities on Pacific Coast 
### 
"There can be no doubt that the
Paulist Choristers deserve the reputa
tion they enjoy as first among the
Roman Catholic choirs in the United
States." These are the words with
which a musical critic for one of the
leading metropolitan newspapers of
the east endorses the Paulist Choris
ters. They will sing Monday night at
the Stanford Assembly Hall.
Under the leadership of the Iter.
Father William J. Finn, with eight
>ears of singing experience and based
on the highest ideals to which singers
can aspire, the Paulist Choristers
have developed a purity and sureness
of tone and a perfection of ensemble
which cannot be equaled by any or
ganization of their kind in the world.
They were organized in Chicago in
1.004, made a great singing tour of Eu
rope, were given a private audience
by rope Pius X, and were awarded
first prize in the international com
petition in Paris in 1912.
This ensemble of 100 singers is now
touring the United States, singing for
the benefit of the French Aid fund.
They have met with great success in
all of the larger cities on this coast
Prices of seats for the concert range
from 50 cents to $2. Tickets may be
