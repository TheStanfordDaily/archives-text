# GIVE-THEN GIVE SOME MORE
## 
### 
Give! Give! and when you think you have given all you can, reconsider
and give some more. This is the call that comes to every American in eac.h
and every demand for funds. And never is the call a more striking one, or
one that appeals morr to the responding sympathies of the men and women
of the country than when the Red Cross, the "Greatest Mother on the Earth,
sends its summons for aid.
Every call from the Red Cross is a call deserving of response, for there
is no charity, no aid as worthy of an answer as the demands of the Red Cross*.
Although 110 official part of America's war work, the nurses, the administra
tors of mercy and the co-operators in reconstruction, the Rod Cross does as
much for humanity and the world as the men in combat on the field of battle.
Without funds the noblest aims are worthless, and without funds the
American Red Cross would be unable to continue in its work of saving and
upbuilding. The second call for $100,000,000 which officially came to the
country last Monday is being answered by a populace that is straining every
effort to give in recognition of the nobleness of the purpose.
The time for Stanford's participation in the nation-wide response to the
"Mother of the Battlefield" is now. A campaign has been started upon the
campus, and today the men and women pledged themselves to contribute to
the college fund. Th-i faculty is coming through with distinction.
