## 
### 
Two dollars per day has been as-
I sured the women who will work in
1 the Stanford women's agricultural unit
i this summer. This is the definite
j wage which has been determined by
i the Women's Land Army of America
under which the Stanford unit is be
| ing organized.
The wage will not mean two dollars
i profit, for the women of the unit are
j to be self-supporting. Prom their
i wages is to come funds for all ex-
I penses. The cost of food will be
| made as low as possible. Light will
j also have to be paid for, but this ex

pense will not be very great.
The regular uniform of the Wo
men's Land Army is to be the garb'
for Stanford women agricultural work
ers. It consists of a one-piece suit
of lad and lassie cloth made in the
form of Norfolk jacket and breeches. 1
The color of the uniform is dark blue
with fine white stripes. It is similar 1
to a riding habit. The cost of the'
uniform will be $4.75. A hat accom 1
panying it will cost twenty-five cents J
According to the latest investiga
tions of the committee in charge it will
be most advisable for the women to
live on the campus, rather than in
camps. Where the work is to be car
ried on his not yet been exactly de
termined. It will be as near the cam
pus as possible.
Possibilities of work for the women
who must remain at Stanford between
the middle of June and July 1 when
the agricultural work is to begin,
have been investigated by the com
mittee. It is probable that twenty
five women may be placed at work on
the campus for that time. This has
not yet been assured, however. The
committee intends to make further
inquiries along this line during the
next week.
Cards on which are written a num
ber of inquiries as to facts which the
Women's Land Army is anxious to
know abbut have been sent to Miss
Bradford by that organization. These
are to be filled out next week by the
Stanford women who have pledged
their services to the unit. Pyhsical
examinations are also to be arranged
for. They probably will be conducted
by D. E. E. Johnson, acting medical
adviser of women.
