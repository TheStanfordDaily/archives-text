whose expert baton the Paul
ist Choristers sing, has ex
pressed a desire that every
one come early so that the
program may commence
promptly at 8:30 and con
tinue without interruption.
Apart from the ecclesiasti
cal feature of tonight's con
cert is the patriotic feature
Tt is for the sole purpose of
raising a fund of $100,000 for
the immediate aid of strick-

en France that Father Finn and his
boys are makin gthis great transconti
nental tour. Several hundred concerts
will have been given by the time the
Paullsts return to Chacago from their
tour of the United States.

This ia the program that will be
given tonight, increased by extra and
encore numbers, some of the most
pleasing of which will be in the na-,
ture of "surprises." (The program is!
subject to change:)
