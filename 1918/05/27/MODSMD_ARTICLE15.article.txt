# GO OVER THE TOP

While "conservation" is the password to victory at this time, it seems
most inconsistent that wanton destruction of property should be going on on
the Stanford campus. Notice has been sent by the business manager of ihe
University, Vanderlynn Stow, that fences enclosing property have been
broken down apparently for no other reason than to escape the necessity of
climbing over them. As Mr. Stow says,"The practice can hardly be attributed
to malice; therefore it must be due to thoughtlessness. If fences are broken
down, stock gets out and men must leave their work to round it up, return
it to its pastures and repair the fences, all of which entails unnecessary ex
pense."
Thoughtlessness can hardly be claimed as an excuse for the destruc
tion of University property. The most notable examples have been perpetrated
in the region of San Juan Hill. If no stile is provided where the passerby
thinks one ought to be, there a probably a good reason for its absence, and
the student has no right to improvise one. It is a question of either go
around or go over. If the short cut is justified as a time-saver it will be
worth going over the top of the fence which may obstruct
It may be that University students are not responsible for breaking the
fences. We hope so. In case they are responsible we hope it will not be
necessary to direct attenton to the matter a second time.
