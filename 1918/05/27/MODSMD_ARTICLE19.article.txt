### 
Acting President C. I). Marx has re
ceived a letter from Business Man
ager Vanderlynn Stow to the effect
that fences enclosing the fields of the
University are being broken down no
tably in the region of San Juan hill,
apparently for no other reason than
to avoid the inconvenience of climbing
over such obstructions.
"Stock gets out and men must leave
their work to round it up and return
it to the pasture, all of which entails
unnnecessary expense," says Mr.
Stow. "I regret the divergence of
money that would otherwise be put
to a use more in harmony with the
wishes of the founders of the Uni
versity."
Professor Marx has expressed the
hope that like acts of thoughtlessness
will not occur in the future.
