# STANFORD BRANCH LIBRARY RECEIVES MANY NEW BOOKS
## 
### 
War books and many of the best
novels of the minute are now to be
found in the Stanford branch of the
county library. These books can be
drawn out at any time during the day
from the Stanford bookstore.
The library is growing rapidly and
tills the void which many have felt
for a source of popular literature and
light fiction.
