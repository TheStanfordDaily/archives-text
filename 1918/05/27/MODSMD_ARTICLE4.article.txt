## 
### 
Bare facts iu regard to the bare
pages of the 1919 Quad came to light
this morning when the same was held
up from sale on the l>aw steps. The
hare pages, which always form the
center of attraction for a considerable
number in Quads, were the cause of
the delay. Rumor has it that powers
that be deemed it necessary to emboss
upon the pages in question there of
ficial O. K. It is open to argument as
to whether this mark of approval will
be administered, because it happens
that the powers that be have become
so enamoured with the physiques of
certain campus gentlemen appearing
in the bare scction that they are loath
to share the views with the campus
public.
The assurance of the Quad board is
given however, that this section will
came to be exposed to the campus to
morrow in the exact form in which it
was originally conceived and dedicated.
The bears and bares shown in these
pages are out of tin- ordinary, to say
the least, as will be the consensus of
opinion, so say the powers that be,
when the Quad comes on sale tomor
row.
