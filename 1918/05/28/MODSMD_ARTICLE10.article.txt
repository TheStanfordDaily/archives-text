"The Red Cross drive on the tum
pus has shown most satisfactory re
sults and we are glad to he able to
turn in a good report," said Professor
W. A. Cooper. "If it were just as easy
to link the Germans as to raise money
for the Rod Cross, we'd have Kaiser
Bill heaten in a very short time," he
added. Although all of the results are
not yet in, Stanford has subcribed

over $4,600, about one-fourth of the
quota for Palo Alto, which was also
greatly oversubscribed.
Members of the faculty have given
$3,437.23, according to present figures,
and it is expected that the amount
will reach $3,600 when all the reports
are received. This sum is 300 per cent
of last summer's drive, which netted
only $1,200.
The students have not been far be
hind. At a mass meeting held last
night in Encina Hall, at which Dr.
G. J. Peirce, Miss Caroline Rochfort,
'20, and several women in Red Cross
costumes were the principal speakers,
about four hundred and seventy-five
dollars were raised. The results from
Roble show a donation of $105.85, and
from Madrono $25.50. The total from
fourteen of the houses on the Row
has reached $486, and there are still
seventeen houses which have not yet
sent in their reports.
