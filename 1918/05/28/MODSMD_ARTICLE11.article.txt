# AUPPERLE WRITES FROM BALKANS
## AUPPERLE WRITES OF CONDITIONS IN BALKAN COUNTRIES 
### 
Interesting information about the
condition of affairs in the Balkans is
given in a letter received this week
from H. V. Aupperle, ex-'l7, who has
been in the Balkans with the Red
Cross for the past year.
The letter reads as follows:
"Although this letter is dated from
Salonika, it is being written while I
an en route to a seaport on the Adri
atic. I have six big Fiat auto trucks
loaed with supplies, some of which I

am leaving at Monastir. 1 have Serb
chauffeurs for the cars, but am in
charge of the convoy. Harry Frantz,
ex-'lB, is with me on this trip, and
Harry and 1 get on very famously.
"1 went out to one of our relief
camps about fifteen kilometers from
here, yesterday afternoon, and had a
very interesting time inspecting the
rooms and tents where the refugees
live. Ed Kneass. ex-'lB, who is in
charge of this camp, has had many
funny experiences. Yesterday after
noon he was called upon to find some
clothes for a new-born baby, extract
a small pebble which one youngster
had inadvertently dropped into his
ear, conduct a trial to investigate the
alleged theft of some food by one of
the assistants, and to light off an old
gray-haired man who insisted upon
kissing his hand out of gratitude."
Aupperle explained that the refu
gees were forced to take a bath at
least once in two weeks before they
could obtain their food cards. He also
gave a graphic description of a prac
tice air raid drill that the camps have
found necessary to use in the constant
fear of air raids.
The letter closed by an optimistic
statement in which Aupperle said that
although the next three months would
mark the crisis of the war, and would
prove anxious months for us all. yet he
believed that in the end the Huns
would be held.
