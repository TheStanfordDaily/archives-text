### 
Student body officers for the com
ing year and passing on a revised
constitution for the A. S. S. U. will
be the reason for the Quad election
which lias been sot for FYiday next.
Several radical changes from the old
order will come to light in the new
constitution which has been prepared
by a committee consisting of W. r.
Ames, '18, Miffs Ruth Taylor, '19, and
S. E. Hriggs. '19, and which will be
presented to the Executive Committee
tonight to bo passed upon in their reg
ular weekly meeting.
Nominations will open tomorrow
for the student body officers to be
elected in Friday's balloting. They
can l>e made through the columns of
the Daily Palo Alto. The offices to
be filled are Student Pody president,
vice president, secretary, two senior
representatives to the executive com
mittee, two junior representatives and
one sophomore representative. The
editor of the Daily Palo Alto is to
be chosen by a different system from
that which has heretofore been in ex
istence, according tc tht plan which
is proposed in the new draft of the
constitution.
The revised constitution will be
voted on by the students at large
next Friday, at which time the old ex
isting document will be rescinded.
Extended alteration of the existing
constitution has been made necessary
by the installation of the quarter
system. This new system makes the
old document out of date in many re-
Bpects. The draft which the revis
ing committee has prepared will en
deavor to remedy a number of the
evils extant in the present status of
student government, at the same time.
Some of the features of the new
document which has been drafted
for ratification by the Executive Com
mittee tonight and by the student
body Friday follow:
A permanent election board will be
provided for to conduct all student
elections.
Two women will bo among the rep
resentatives to the Executive Com
mittee which will be known under the
new order as the Student Council,
and will hnve increased powers.
The editor of the Daily Palo Alto
will be elected by the staff of the pa
per instead of bv the former method.
The choice of the staff will be subject
to a Quad election by the student
body, however, In the event of a peti
tion signed by RO voters.
