# Unit Is Now Open to Outside Women
## Small Number of Stanford Women Now Enrolled Given As Reason 
### 
Registration for the Stanford wo
men's agricultural unit has been
opened to persons outside the Uni
versity. A large number of such per
sons have applied for admission to
the unit and have been given inde
finite answers. The committee has
deemed it advisable to allow outside
women to sign up under the Stanford
unit on account of the small number
of university women enrolled. Regis
tration may be done through Miss
Bradford or through Miss Elinor Ep
pich, '19, chairman of the committee.
Cards for the Women's Army
of America have been received in the
office of the dean of women which
nacb woman now enrolled in the unit
is to fill out. These women are re
quested to sign the rards in Miss
Bradford's office as soon as possible.
The committee wishes to have every
card filled by Friday evening.
Dr. E. E. Johnson, acting medical
adviser of women, has consented to
conduct the physical examinations
necessary for every woman entering
the agricultural unit. Appointment
for the examinations will be made
at the same time that the Women's
Land \rmy cards are signed.
Due to the small number of women
enrolled for work in the unit, the
work probably will not be carried
