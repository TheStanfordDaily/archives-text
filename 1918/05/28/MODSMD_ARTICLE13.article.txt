# Unit Is Now Open to Outside Women
## Small Number of Stanford Women Now Enrolled Given As Reason 
### 
Registration for the Stanford wo
men's agricultural unit has been
opened to persons outside the Uni
versity. A large number of such per
sons have applied for admission to
the unit and have been given inde
finite answers. The committee has
deemed it advisable to allow outside
women to sign up under the Stanford
unit on account of the small number
of university women enrolled. Regis
tration may be done through Miss
Bradford or through Miss Elinor Ep
pich, '19, chairman of the committee.
Cards for the Women's Army
of America have been received in the
office of the dean of women which
nacb woman now enrolled in the unit
is to fill out. These women are re
quested to sign the rards in Miss
Bradford's office as soon as possible.
The committee wishes to have every
card filled by Friday evening.
Dr. E. E. Johnson, acting medical
adviser of women, has consented to
conduct the physical examinations
necessary for every woman entering
the agricultural unit. Appointment
for the examinations will be made
at the same time that the Women's
Land \rmy cards are signed.
Due to the small number of women
enrolled for work in the unit, the
work probably will not be carried
on under the Prune and Apricot
Growers' Association of the Santa
Clara valley. The labor will be taken
care of by some smaller organization
or by independent growers.
The registration of alumnae as
supervisors and senior co-workers is
to take place this week. It is hoped
that all of the positions which must
be held by older and responsible wo
men will be filled by Stanford grad
uates.
Four weeks is the minimum amount
of time for the agricultural work
which the Women's Land Army con
siders to be profitable to both the ser
vice rendered and the laborer her
self. However, women may sign up
for less time if it is necessary,
which come up in regard to the new
document.
Under the new system, the gradu
ate manager will be known as the
"Student Manager," and ho will have
a closer supervision over class en
terprises and student publications.
The student manager Is to be entirely
independent of the Hoard of Athletic
Control, unless they desire to choose
him as their manager.
All student officers will he subject
to recall under the new regime.
