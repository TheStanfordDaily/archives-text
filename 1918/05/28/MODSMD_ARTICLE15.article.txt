# A 						NEW CONSTITUTION
## 
### 
To throw out the old which is no longer useful, and to consider the new
which will better meet the situation, will be the proposal made to the Execu
tive Committee tonight with the submission of the remodeled constitution.
Due to different conditions, the quarter Bystem, and changes brought about by
the war, the constitution now in force by the Associated Student body has
been found so inadequate as to be beyond mere amending. It needs complete
revision. For this reason the constitution committee will recommend that the
old document bo replaced by a new one which aims to meet the requirements
of a student organization In a more satisfactosy manner.
Some changes will be suggested which may at first seem a bit radical,
and a long step in departure from the present system. It is felt, however,
that in every such case the failure of the old system justifies the suggested
change.
Contrary to a belief by some that there is now no need for a student body
constitution since student government has been taken away for the period of
the war, there is the need to provide an organization to regulate affairs over
which the students will have control. In the constitution, as it exists now,
no provision is made for student discipline, save to provide that there shall
be a student conference. Its duties and powers are not enumerated in the con
stitution, and the removal of that body will not affect the necessity for a con
stitution to provide for student officers and the legislative body. Since the
Executive Committee is essentially a legislative body, and the present Men's
Council has been disbanded, the suggestion will be made that the name Stu
dent Council be given the legislative body. The new form of government will
be nearer the commission form, under which an elected board if given power
to regulate matters of student interest. It will be proposed that two women
be chosen by general election to represent the women who are members of
the student body organization.
It is felt that a permanent election board is necessary to conduct elec
tions on a well-regulated basis. For this reason it will be suggested that hhcli
& board be elected by the legislative body at the beginning of each college
year.
Heretofore no delegation of the power to interpret a contested point in
the constitution has been made. For this purpose, it will be proposed that a
member of the Law faculty be given the power of interpretation.
The questions raised by the proposed constitution will affect every piern
ber of the student body organization, and will come up for election probably
on Friday. Every student should be interested enough in his givernment to
acquaint himself with the proposed changes, that he may vote intelligently
when the constitution is submitted for adoption.
