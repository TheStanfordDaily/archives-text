# IMMORTALITY WILL BE DR. DEWEY'S SUBJECT
## 
### 
Dr. John Dewey, probably the mosl
prominent philosopher of the present
day and ago, will give a series of lec
tures along the linos of immortality
and human conduct in the Little The
ater, tho iirst to be given tonight, the
other two coming on Wednesday and
Thursday evenings.
Dr. Dewey was prime mover for the
organization of university professors.
He is a Columbia University professor,
and is one of the foremost educators
in the United States today. He is
prominent in the standardization of
primary and secondary school curric
ula. The speaker was formerly con
nected with the philosophy depart
ments of the Universities of Michigan
and Chicago.
Professor J. S. P. Tatlock, who has
known Dr. Dewey for some time,
speaks of him as "an attractive and
weighty speaker who appeals to all
thinking people."
The noted educator has chosen for
his subject tonight "Factors in
Human Conduct." The second lecture
will be on Wednesday with "Signific
ance of Instinct" as the subject; the
third, on Thursday, "Significance of
Reflection."
Dr. Dewey's presence here is at
tracting wide attention, as all previous
lectures on immortality which have
been given on the campus have been
given by clergymen. As the speaker
represents no church in particular, his
lectures will be treated from an un
biased standpoint.
