The meat shortage in the United
States will be materially relieved by
the increased quantity of fish that
are now coming to market. The
Food Administration believes that
the supply will soon be sufficient to
play an important part in solving our
food problem and that prices will be
low enough to induce the consumer
to find in fish a valuable adjunct to
the diet and a good substitute for the
staple foods needed abroad.

The reason for the removal ol rye
flour from the list of substitutes for
wheat flour, is that it was estimated
that on May 1 there remained but
16,000,000 bushels of rye in the coun
try. If rye »lour had been continued
on the substitute list our available
supply would not have lasted one
month. In order that there might be
even a limited supply for the normal
uses of rye flour, this cereal was tak
en off the substitute list.
