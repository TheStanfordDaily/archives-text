"Go to Hâ€”l !" was Editor Sam
Briggs' reply to the Daily Palo Alto
reporter who asked him what the next
issue of Chaparral was to be, liefore
the editor's departure for the south
land. Briggs, later developments
proved, was neither attempting to in
sult the correspondent or get himself
in wrong with the cainpus purity
leagues. He was merely naming the
next issue of the college comic which
makes its defiant appearance ou the
Quad next Monday.
"Go to Hell !" is the picturesque
and appropriate name given to the
last regular issue of Chaparral un
til Germany no longer exists, and the
rebellious and energetic application
of the hammer proves that Chappie
realizes that he is safe from faculty
attacks in the front line trenches.
Ruth Taylor, '19, has drawn the
cover, which depicts Chappie's more
than characteristic good-bye to the
campus. Monk Antrim, '19, has
drawn a two-page set of cartoons on
"Good-byes we'd like to say." Sam
Glikbarg, '19, and Sam Briggs, '19,
supplied the feature article on faculty
atrocities as performed in the ef
ficient German manner.
Editorially, Chappie is in rare form,
taking peculiar delight in slamming
various phases of the university ad
ministration that meets with his dis
favor. He is likewise apologetic in
announcing that George Kocher, '19,
Lloyd Dinkelspiel, '20, Eddie Randall.
'20, and Harry Behn, '21, are added
to the staff.
Purse-string dictator "Babe" Howes
announces that all men leaving for
the Presidio training camp may ob
tain the "Go to Hell" issue by sending
their name and address and twenty
five cents to box 1357 or the box in
the book store.
