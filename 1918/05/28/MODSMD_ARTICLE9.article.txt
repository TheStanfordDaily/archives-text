# Paulist Choristers Score Success of the Season
## 
### 
Beginning with the difficult strains
of Terry's "Kyrie" and ending in a
grand ensemble presentation of the
National Anthem, the Paulist Chor
isters maintained their reputation of
being the leading singing organization
of their kind in the world, when they
presented a program at# Assembly
Hall last night.
There can be little doubt but that
the Paulist Choristers put on the

finest musical entertainment that has
been given here for several years. An
average crowd attended the entertain
ment and the proceeds were turned
over to the French Aid Fund.
Sopranos Are Stars
Especialy notable were the large
number of boy's soprano voices. Most
of them had tones that rang out clear
and silvery as bells. Master I)ick
Finn and Master Hallet Dolan won
unanimous applause from the audience
with their solo parts.
The obligato parts sung by Master
Tobin in "Deep River," and by Master
McManus in Leslie's "Lullaby of Life,"
could not have been improved. The
latter responded to an encore with a
beautiful presentation of "The Lust
Rose of Summer."
Master Dick Finn's singing of "Old
Black Joe" was without doubt the fav
orite number of the evening's enter
tainment. All of the soprano soloists
were boys under 12 years of age and
their singing paid the best possible
tribute to the training given them by
their conductor, the Rev. Father
William J. Finn. *
Mother's Heart Touched
"When the Boys Come Home," sung
by F. M. Dunford, basso-cantante, went
close enough to the hearts of the audi
ence to bring tears to the eyes of
mothers whose sons are "over there."
"The Vulcan Song" (Gounod), pre
sented by Mr. Dunford, was another
favorite.
The weird strains oS several selec
tions of Russian music added a dis
tinctive air to a part of the program.
The ensemble presentation of "Col
idia,'' from the "Christmas Night"
opera, was the best liked number of
this part of the program. Two tenor
solos by Clay Hart were worthy of
special praise.
The audience paid a note of tine
respect to France when it rose quickly
to its feet as the accompanist struck
the first chords of "La Marseillaise."
The entire choir stood at a position of
salute when singing this number, and
also when singing the "Star Spangled
Banner," which ended the program,
and sent a thrill of patriotism through
the hearts of the audience.
