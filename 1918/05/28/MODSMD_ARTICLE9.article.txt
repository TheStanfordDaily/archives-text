# Paulist Choristers Score Success of the Season
## 
### 
Beginning with the difficult strains
of Terry's "Kyrie" and ending in a
grand ensemble presentation of the
National Anthem, the Paulist Chor
isters maintained their reputation of
being the leading singing organization
of their kind in the world, when they
presented a program at# Assembly
Hall last night.
There can be little doubt but that
the Paulist Choristers put on the

finest musical entertainment that has
been given here for several years. An
average crowd attended the entertain
ment and the proceeds were turned
over to the French Aid Fund.
Sopranos Are Stars
Especialy notable were the large
number of boy's soprano voices. Most
of them had tones that rang out clear
and silvery as bells. Master I)ick
