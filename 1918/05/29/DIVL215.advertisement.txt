CHATEAU LAKE LOUISE
Amid Swiss scenes in the Canadian Pacific Rockies —win-
dows framing mili ion dollar pictures of peaks and glaciers
"In the Lake, ever changing, is Beauty herself, as nearly visible to
mortal eyes as she may ever be. The water, beyond the flowers, is
green, always a different green. Then a little wind awakes in the
distanco ai d ruffles the surface, yard by yard, covering it with a myriad
of tiny wrinkles, till the lake is mi'.ky emerald while the rest still sleeps.
And at length the whole is astir and the suncatchesitand Lake Louise
is a web of laughter, the opal distillation of all the buds of all the Spring."
