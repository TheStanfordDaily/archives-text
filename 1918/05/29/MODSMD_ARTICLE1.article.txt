ard of the 23rd Machine Gun Com
pany, and Lieutenant Paul Staniford
of the G2d Infantry will act as judges
for the R. O. T. C. company competi
tion and review tomorrow morning.
Each of these men will keep separate
score sheets to record the seventeen
movements in close and extended or
der which will be given the com
panies.
Captain Parker has arranged for
the companies to move out one at a
time from the gymnasium and as each
company finishes its drill, it will stack
arms at one end of the field until the
competition is finished. The com
panies will move out in the following
order, chosen by lot: D, P. E. A, C,
and If. After the conclusion of the
company competition, four men from
each company will engage in a manual
at arms competition. The winner will
be determined by the process of elim
ination. A battalion parade will close
the exercises.
Captain Parker is especially anxious
that the exercises be held In the
presence of a large crowd, as Thurs
day is Decoration Day and it will be
the last appearance of the Stanford
corps this year. Acting President
Marx has declared a university holi
day on account of the review alone,
and with the expectation of having the
students not participating in the drill
attend. Professor Marx reviewed
the men this afternoon.
