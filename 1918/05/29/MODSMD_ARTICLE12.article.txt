# "WAR FOR AMERICAN IDEALS" SAYS DEWEY IN ASSEMBLY TALK
## "FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES OF WAR" HIS TOPIC Professor of Philosophy at Columbia University Delivers Lecture 
### 
"Since the entrance of the United
States into the war it has become pe
culiarly an American war; a war for
American ideals. As Lincoln charac
terized the Civil war,—t-'A nation can
not endure half slave and half free,' —
so we have come to see that the organ
ization of the world cannot remain
half autocratic and half democratic,"
declared Dr. John Dewey, professor of
philosophy at Columbia University in
an interesting discussion of "The
Fundamental Issues of the War" at a
University assembly this morning.
Dr. Dewey gave a searching survey
of the principles which underlie the
policies of the allied and central pow
ers, dwelling particularly on what
philosophical and moral problems are
faccd in the German war policies.
"Never before has the world been
faced with such an issue as that in
volved in this, the turning point of
world history. In Germany we have
to deal with a nation which has suc
cessfully employed all its resources—
scientific, intellectual, and technical to
carry out the purposes of a political
state managed from above. We are
face to face with the political abso
lutist ideals and feudal notions of the
j seventeenth century, reinforced with
j modern ideals of science and techni
i calities.
"America had so little cognizance
of European affairs and felt herself
so far removed politically and morally
that after the issues of the invasion
of Belgium, the sinking of the Lusi
tania, and the German atrocities, it
came to be a question of one of two
alternatives—either the United States
! must become an ally of a passive sort
of the central powers by submitting
to the rules laid down by Germany or
America must take an active part in
the war.
