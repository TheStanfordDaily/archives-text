# "HABIT AND HUMAN LIFE" IS THE TOPIC
## Second of West Memorial Lecture Series Given by Dr. John Dewey 
### 
Speaking on the "Significance of
Habit," Dr. John Dewey, professor of
philosophy at Columbia University,
last night delivered in the Assembly
Hall the first, of his series of three
lectures on human conduct given un
der thr Raymond Fred West memorial
fund, established for that purpose.
The speaker was introduced by Dr.
Jordan, who referred to him as un
doubtedly the foremost phlosophical
thinker of the present day.
Dr. Dewey spoke of habit as "a
positive mode of energy," as distin
guished from the idea of the habit as
a restriction. The habit that con
stantly moves man in a certain direc
tion is his real will, he said.
"To say that we are capable of ac
quiring habits is to say that we are
capable of learning," he said. "The
power to acquire habits shows that
human nature is plastic, that it Is do
cile period. We form so many of our
habits under influences we do not con
trol. where ends and purposes are set
or us by others, that we get the cur
rent idea of habits as limitations of
ability. They become of the nature
of routine; they become ruts, not in
telligently chosen ways of reaching
purposes and ends of which we .are
conscious."
The difference between good and
bad habits, said Dr. Dewey, is the dif
ference between those formed with
the end and purpose in view, and those
formed without possessing a knowl
edge of the end desired. "Routine
habits are governed by the past, and
this means an aversion to all that is
new in achievement, and puts a bar
rier to growth, initiative, and Improve
ment."
