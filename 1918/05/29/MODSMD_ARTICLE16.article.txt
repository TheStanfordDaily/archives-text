# THE
						NEW CONSTITUTION
## 
### 
"Modern" is the expression that explains the constitution to be voted on
for the A. S. S. IT. next Friday on the Quad. The old document that has been
in force for the student body has allowed freedom, and chances for ineffi
ciency that should necessarily be restricted, and the new constitution makes
just such restrictions.
In line with modern tendencies in government, publicity is given to a
the acts of the student body officers under the uew arrangement. Ballots
are to be counted publicly. The meetings of the Student Council are to be
open, and the records and books of the association are ready for inspection
at all times. , o
Perhaps one of the most radical changes is the election ot the editor oi
the Daily Palo Alto by the editorial staff of the paper. That this is for the
best, thinking students little doubt The editorship of the college paper is
uecessarily an executive position rather than political. Yet under the old
constitution there was every chance for politics to creep into the election.
Now this objection no longer exists. The editor has no vote on the Student
Council, and so could not be political in nature.
Many students object to a staff election on the grounds that it will allow
a faction to control the paper. But a sufficient check is put on this danger,
since a petition signed by fifty members of the student body can call a new
election. With this provision the University should pass this particular
clause.
The women of the University have given the expenditure ot their athletic
funds to the student body, and in return the student body has allowed the "500"
two members on the council. There is a fair exchange and benefit should re
sult. Several of the larger universities of the country have such an arrange
ment, and it works successfully. Heretofore, the student body has asked the
women to join it, and yet has offered them no representation in return.
The clause which takes away the vote of the student manager from the
Student Council should be valuable in making that officer executive lather
than political. Most of the proposals which are submitted to the executive
committee at the present time come from the graduate manager, and it seems
best that, he should not be allowed to vote on them. Such proposals as the
salary to be allowed the manager, his election, etc., are naturally questions
to be decided by the council without the manager's vote. Such is the pur
pose of the new clause.
On the whole, the new constitution is a step far in advancc. The student
body should get acquainted with its features, and vote for it next Friday.
