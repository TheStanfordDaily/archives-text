## STATIONED AT BOSTON Says School Is Strenuous One Designed to Test a Man's Mettle

Training for naval aviation at. the
Massachusetts Institute of Technol
ogy is as strenuous a life as one can
wish for, according to (i. H. Fergu
son, ex-'lB, who is finishing his ten
weeks there, in a letter just received
on the Campus, Ferguson writes:
"My time here is now almost up, a
fact which makes me extremely joyful.
The past seven weeks have been hell
ish ones, and 1 'm coming out of here
more than ten weeks older than when
I went in. This is a school to test
men's mettle and weaklings who have
passed other tests are broken here.
"I am now at the end of the fourth,
or li, fortnight, and have just one
more to go. The 13 and A weeks cor
respond to senior year ,in which only
u few are supposed to work with any
intensity. 13y the time this stage is
reached one has learned how to econ
omize time, the examinations are
fewer, and the discipline bears less
heavily. I have time to eat my meals
now, sit down to read a newspaper
and once in a while a magazine.
"We have a few more hard exams
to come, on which I may fail and get
ejected from this institution; but I am
trying to pull through. We are doing
our best now on such subjects as
'theory of flight (fright for ns) and
navigation.' "
Ferguson expects to be sent from
there to one of the four stations at
which flying instruction is given.
"Occasionally some of us are drafted
for the blimps and sent to Akron,
Ohio," he writes. "We get a commis
sion and gel. across much quicker that
way, but few of us like the idea of not,
flying around in an airplane after
going through hell for ten weeks
here."
Just what he means by "blimps" is
hot indicated in the letter, but they
fire dirigible balloons.
"The equipment here (Massachu
setts Tech.) is great," he states. "It
is perhaps the best in the country.
One building cost $ii,000,000 and is a
wonder. It is the largest T have ever
seen and it is easy to get lost in it."
Resides Ferguson, other Stanford
men are in training at this school.
