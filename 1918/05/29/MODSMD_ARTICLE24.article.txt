### 
The Dartmouth Alumni Magazine;
prints the following article on frater
nity agitation in the East:
The trustees of the colleges have
accepted a proposal recently offered
by a committee of the alumni repre
sentatives of the Dartmouth fraterni
ties for the partial closing next year
of all fraternity houses. Details of
the proposition were left to a newly
appointed committee, of which Presi
dent. Hopkins is chairman. In brief,
the plaii provides for the closing of
the dormitory sections of all fratern
ity houses, a restricted operation of
other parts of the houses, and finan
cijJ assistance from the college to the
fraternities in order to help them in
meeting their obligations. As a re
sult (if this, practically all students
will room in the college dormitories
next year.
"To the President and Trustees of
Dartmouth College.
"Gentlemen:
"We. the alumni representatives of
the fraternities at Dartmouth College,
seeking some way in which the fra
ternities may cooperate with the col
lege in the solution of its problem
of reduced income through vacant
dormitories, beg to suggest the follow
ing plan for your consideration:
"1. That the fraternities deny their
members the privilege of rooming in
the fraternity houses from September.
1918. to the end of the war.
"2. That the fraternities keep only
those portions of their houses open
which are necessary to provide a
gathering place for the fraternity
men, and that these rooms be heated
only during the afternoon and evening
hours.
"3. That, by virtue of the financial
benefit derived by the college from

this arrangement, the college assist
the various fraternities in meeting
their fixed charges by granting to a
central committee, representing these
fraternities, a lump annual payment
based on estimates constituting the
least sums which the several fraterni
ties can accept with any hope of
meeting their financial obligations so
long as the dormitory sections of their
houses remain closed, arid aggregat
ing, further, a sum materially less
than that to be netted by the college
from the arrangement.
"it must be recognized, however,
that the fraternities have their sever
al obligations to meet, just as impor
tant to the integrity of the college as
a whole as those of the college cor
poration. Hence the last clause in
our suggested plan to the College
Trustees.
"From an examination of costs of
dormitory operation supplied by the
treasurer of the college, we are able
to state that extra men, or men who
j would otherwise be housed in frater
nity buildings, can be roomed in col
lege 1Â« Hidings at a net cost (hv net
we mean the increased cost, of operat
ing the college dormitories over that
of maintaining the buildings in a
' closed condition) of $H0 to $35 per
man. At the larger figure, the net
cost of housing 244 fraternity men
would he $8,540. These men would
aggregate a payment to the college
of not less than $24,400 in room rent.
Of the difference between this sum
and the cost of operation, i.e., $15,860.
a sum not to exceed $8,000 would be
returned to the fraternity group as a
whole for distribution among the indi
vidual fraternities according to their
need, and the remainder would be re
tained by the college."
