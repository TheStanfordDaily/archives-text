# WOMEN'S LAND ARMY DRAWS UP REGULATIONS
## 
### 
Information relative to the Stan
ford women's agricultural unit has
been received by Miss Harriet Brad
ford, dean of women, from the Wo
men's Land Army of America, under
which the local unit is being organ
ized. Miss Bradford is a member of
the advisory council for the northern
division of California.
The Women's Land Army has
started a nation-wide patriotic move
ment to supply women workers on the
farms that the output of farm pro
ducts may be increased. It hopes to
replace the men who have volun
teered or been conscripted, and those
who have gone into the shipbuilding
industry and the manufacture of mu
nitions. The organization makes it
plain that it does not desire its wo
men recruits to undercut man labor.
Until it has been demonstrated that
the male supply of labor is entirely
inadequate, the Women's Land Army
does not desire to force women into
unusual and heavy occupations. It
will keep the women laborers in the
following occupations if possible:
a. The picking, sorting, cutting,
wrapping, and packing of fruit.
b. Work in driers and canneries.
c. Truck gardening, light cultivat
ing, etc.
d. Dairying.
e. Ranch cooks.
f. Handling of stock.
In these occupations the Women's
Land Army will endeavor to supply
