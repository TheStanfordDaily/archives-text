# A.S.S.U. Flings Send Tomorrow
## 
### 
A goodly representation ot the A.
S. S. U. dance tomorrow night was
apparently certain today, when Stan
ford women sold tickets for dances
on the Quad. Each little cardboard
represented an enjoyable acud in tl;:
Women's Club House, and swelled the
funds of the Associated Students of
Stanford University by live pennies,
and the coffers of the Uncle Sam by
one.
Dances at tomorrow's joy festival

will be of the jitney struggle variety,
and the proceeds are to go in part,
to the purchasing of 100 Quads to dis
tribute among high schools of the
state. Any surplus will go to the stu
dent body treasury.
Representative women from the so
rorities of the campus are to be pres
ent at the struggle to sell tickets and
insure partners for every one. The
W. A. A. and the Executive Commit
tee are backing the affair.
