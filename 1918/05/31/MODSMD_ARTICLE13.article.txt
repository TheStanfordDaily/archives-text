"Our instincts furnish the raw mx*
terial for our character; nothing can
he done without instinct as far as de
velopment of conduct and character
is concerned," said Dr. John Dewey,
in his lecture Wednesday in the Lit
tle Theater on "The Significance of
Instinct.| He went on to point out
that free play should not be granted
to instincts, nor on the other hand
should they he too strictly repressed.
The ideal, he pointed out, was the in
telligent direction of instincts.
In his final lecture, last night. Dr.
Dewey spoke on "The Significance of
Thinking in the Development of Con
duct." "It is a moral obligation to
he intelligent. The Anglo-Saxon trait
is to mimimize the importance of in
telligence in connection with moral
conduct. 'Be good, and let who will be
clever', we often hear. But the class
ic tradition from the Greeks, and the
Christian idea of the middle ages
made thinking the main thing."
Dr. Dewey's lecture was divided
into the answering of the two ques
tions: What do we mean by reflec
tion or intellect in respect to moral
action, and what are the obstacles
which reduce it to slight importance
as a controlling power in the guid
ance of conduct?
"Lower animals are moved to action
from forces that push from behind,
while reasoning men are moved by
thoughts of the future. They have a
capacity to see in advance the fruits
of their actions, and to act in the
present in the light of, and in behalf
of, the future."
"When men thus act significantly
there is no limit to the consequences.
There is no limit to the development
of intelligent action. If as has been
said there is a certain dead-line be
yond which people are incapable of re
ceiving new ideas, it must have been
set up by some past failing, for every
new ability should tend toward still
another ability in looking forward,
and to a greater range and depth of
learning."
