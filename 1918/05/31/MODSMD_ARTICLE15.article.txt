# GET GOOD HOUSEKEEPERS
## 
### 
Now is a good time for the Student Body Association to have a general
house-cleaning, to sweep the organization clean of the cobwebs of intrigue,
and to air out the unsavory atmosphere of politicsâ€”not the cleanest
With the election of officers, and the change in the constitution, an oppor
tunity is offered to begin anew on a better foundation. The old system was
more or less wrecked by the too frequent change in officials and a constitu
tion that was not suited to the times.
Choice of officers at this election will undoubtedly be a hard problem, for
the number of men now in the University versed in student body affairs and
the art of leadership in a student government is small. Younger and newer
men will have to fill the places formerly held mainly by seniors. Their lack
of experience will have to he made up for by their increased interest for the
success of the coming year.
Probably the greatest cause for the failure of the government, in the
places where it has fallen down during the past year, has been the lack of
vital interest in, and knowledge of the aims of the organization. Without
such interest there can be 110 efficiency, and it stands to reason that without
a knowledge of the end toward which we are working, it is impossible to
achieve success. It would be safe to wager that there is but a very small
percentage of students in the University who could name a half dozen pro
visions in the student body constitution. Is it then any wonder that the effi
ciency the government should attain is a long way from being reached?
Students who are good citizens in the university community will realize
the need, and buck up against the problem squarely. They will choose offi
cers capable and interested enough to successfully administer student intei
ests. and then they will demand that they fulfill the trust placed in their lead
ers. The election next Wednesday will be an important one, and the choice
of nominees is even more so. Nominations must be in to the Daily Palo
Alto by noon on Tuesday.
Pi it the housekeepers for next year carefully.
