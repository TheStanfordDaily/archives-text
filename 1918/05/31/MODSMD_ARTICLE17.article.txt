# PALO ALTO IS SCENE OF BELGIAN MARKET
## Concessions Will Attract Interest Tomorrow to Aid Oppressed 
### 
Concessions for the amusement of
both children and grown-ups are rap
idly coming into existence in Palo
Alto between the Southern Pacific
station and tlie highway, which will be
the scene of a Belgian market tomor
row. The fete will start at 11 o'clock
and will continue through the after
noon and evening.
There will be a great variety of
booths in which everything from
steins to French bouquets will be sold.
The bargain booth will contain a mis
cellaneous collection of priceless
articles which have been donated for
the purpose. There is to be a book
booth, where war books dealing with
the stories of Belgium and France will
be sold. Here, also, one may obtain
a small colored mimeograph of Pedro
Lemos' war poster, which is reputed
to be very fine.
Mrs. E. P. Kreibiehl has charge of
a flower booth. She will have 1000
small French bouquets which will be
sold by children in French costume.
Miss Dare Stark is head of a fortune
telling concession, which bids fair to
outclass many others in holding atten
tion.
Several San Francisco art stores
have donated art works to be placed
in Miss Maud Wilson's art booth.
These and a Japanese villa are only
a few of many attractions planned for.
Promptly at 2 o'clock pupils of the
Palo Alto high school will present a
play, after which there will be a con
tinuous vaudeville performance
through the afternoon and evening.
At noon a strictly war-time lunch
eon will be served, cafeteria style,
which is to be cooked by Victor, the
well-known chef of the St. Francis
Hotel, who has donated his services
for the occasion. Some of his dishes
will probably be in evidence at the
food booth, where whcatless products
only will be on sale. A prize has been
offered for the best loaf of wheatless
bread which is brought to this booth.
Two other Belgian markets have
been given in Palo Alto at which from
$2000 to $3000 was made for the re
lief of the Belgians, and the commit
tee in charge hopes that the fete to
morrow will bring even larger returns.
