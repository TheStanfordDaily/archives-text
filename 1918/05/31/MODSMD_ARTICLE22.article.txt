# FOOD CONSERVATION APPEAL TO BE READ IN MEMORIAL CHURCH
## 
### 
In spite of the fact that the exports
of foodstuffs are constantly increas
ing and ure approaching the minimum
requirements abroad, the need for re
newed devotion and effort is pressing,
and the food administration has de
cided to make the appeal through the
churches. Herbert Hoover has pre
pared a statement of the food situa
tion in the country, and he has asked
that this be read in every church
throughout the country on June 2.
Portions of Hoover's appeal read
as follows:
"In the case of meat and meat prod
ucts. the necessities for shipment
abroad are very great. We request
that all meat consumption, including
poultry, be reduced from three and
one-half pounds to two pounds per
week for each person.
