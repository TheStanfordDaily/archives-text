# WHAT'S THE MATTER
## 
### 
Suspicion to the right of us, suspicion to the left of us, and suspicion
before and after us is the situation of Stanford student affairs at this time,
and from such a state of affairs no good can come.
Relations have come to an unfortunate pass when faculty members and
students alike view each move made by the other with distrust. When a
regulation is laid down by the faculty or the administration, students see in
it some indication of a more drastic measure that is to come in the future,
and they immediately rebel against it. On the other hand, when a student
is found guilty of a misdemeanor it is often viewed as just a part of a far
reaching plot. As long as such a condition exists no real progress can be
made in student affairs. Public opinion becomes lazy, and condemns or ap
proves indiscriminately. "What's the Use" seems to have become the Stan
ford student body motto. No wonder that only forty-nine votes were cast
at the election for the adoption of a new constitution which makes funda
mental changes in student body affairs!
When and how this drifting apart of faculty and student began it is diffi
cult to determine. Perhaps it was due to the fact that the great war ab
sorbed so much of our interest that little was left for college affairs. And
indifference and ignorance always breed suspicion.
Stanford, as we have been told over and over again, has a definite part
to play in wartime. This part can be played only when every element in the
University is co-operating to the fullest extent. It cannot be played as long
as the attitude of indifference to the good name of the University and half
barted hostility to the faculty continues.
Constructive criticism is vital at Stanford as elsewhere, but mutual im
putations of plots, conspiracies, and Machiavellian motives by the instructors
and instructed would destroy the morale of any institution. These are trying
times. Let us remember that we are all striving toward the same goal, and
make allowances for differences in viewpoint in regard to non-essentials,
while not permitting the inevitable slackening of interest in University life
to get the better of cur college ideals.
If a little more of the tonic of co-operation can be infused into the droop
ing Stanford spirit before next October, Stanford's second war year will avoid
some of the painful incidents of the 1917-18 session.
