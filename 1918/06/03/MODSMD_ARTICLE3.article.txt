# Change Necessary In Personnel of Woman's Relief Unit
## 
### 
The personnel of the Stanford
Women's Relief Unit, which expects to
leave by the end of the week if word
is received from Washington, D. C.,
as to final instructions for departure,
has been definitely completed. Sev
eral changes were necessitated either
on account of the age requirement or
the new "brothers" clause recommend
ed by General Pershing and adopted
by Congress recently.
Miss Dorothy Egbert's case was par
ticularly regrettable for as the organ
izer of the unit she has worked ac
tively and well. Every effort has been
made to waive the "brother's" clause
in Miss Egbert's case but no excep
tion will be made by the government
as she has two brothers in the navy.
For the same reason Miss Gladys
Morgan, *12, of San Diego, and Miss
Dorothea Smith, 'IT), of Chico, have
been dropped from the unit. Alter
nates have been decided upon by the
advisory board, and the complete list
of those going is as follows:
Velona Pilcher, ex-'lB, Done: Reach.
Sue L. Dyer. '99, A.M., '01, Alameda.
Edith Mirrielees, '07, Palo Alto.
Elizabeth Andrews, 'OS, Weed.
Margaret Gardner. 'OS. Los An
geles.
Margaret Lothrop, A. M., '15, Stan
ford University.
Marguerite Horine, '15, Stockton.
