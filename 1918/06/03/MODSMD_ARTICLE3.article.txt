# Change Necessary In Personnel of Woman's Relief Unit
## 
### 
The personnel of the Stanford
Women's Relief Unit, which expects to
leave by the end of the week if word
is received from Washington, D. C.,
as to final instructions for departure,
has been definitely completed. Sev
eral changes were necessitated either
on account of the age requirement or
the new "brothers" clause recommend
ed by General Pershing and adopted
by Congress recently.
Miss Dorothy Egbert's case was par
ticularly regrettable for as the organ
izer of the unit she has worked ac
tively and well. Every effort has been
made to waive the "brother's" clause
in Miss Egbert's case but no excep
tion will be made by the government
as she has two brothers in the navy.
For the same reason Miss Gladys
Morgan, *12, of San Diego, and Miss
Dorothea Smith, 'IT), of Chico, have
been dropped from the unit. Alter
nates have been decided upon by the
advisory board, and the complete list
of those going is as follows:
Velona Pilcher, ex-'lB, Done: Reach.
Sue L. Dyer. '99, A.M., '01, Alameda.
Edith Mirrielees, '07, Palo Alto.
Elizabeth Andrews, 'OS, Weed.
Margaret Gardner. 'OS. Los An
geles.
Margaret Lothrop, A. M., '15, Stan
ford University.
Marguerite Horine, '15, Stockton.
Ruth Seeley, '13, A. M., 14, .Los
(JittOS.
Placida Gardner, '07, Los Angeles.
Fleta Williams, '17, Chico.
Anua M. Laird, '02, Santa Aua.
Laura Emery, '00, Los Angeles.
Anne Scott, '04, Hollywood.
Beatrice Flynn, nurse.
As yet the complete $30,000 Lias not
been received in actual cash but As
sistant Registrar J. E. McDowell
stales that a lull liuaucial report
would be made some time in the early
summer. Enough money is on hand to
guarantee the liuaucial success oi the
unit and justify its leaviug as soon
as is possible.
Miss Veloua Pilcher was at hrst re
jected from the unit on account ol' her
age as she was uot yet twenty-five, in
spite of her splendid recomineuda
tions, including ex-President Taft's
eudorsemeut. After considerable in
vestigation and after all efforts had
failed as far as the American lied
Cross and the United States govern
ment was concerned, Miss Pilcher
discovered that she could go under the
British regulations. Preliminary prep
arations have been made and Miss Pil
cher will go on the Stanford unit as
the only member from the British
lied Cross.

As yet the complete $30,000 Lias not
been received in actual cash but As
sistant Registrar J. E. McDowell
stales that a lull liuaucial report
would be made some time in the early
summer. Enough money is on hand to
guarantee the liuaucial success oi the
unit and justify its leaviug as soon

Miss Veloua Pilcher was at hrst re
jected from the unit on account ol' her
age as she was uot yet twenty-five, in
spite of her splendid recomineuda
tions, including ex-President Taft's
eudorsemeut. After considerable in
vestigation and after all efforts had
failed as far as the American lied
Cross and the United States govern
ment was concerned, Miss Pilcher
discovered that she could go under the
British regulations. Preliminary prep
arations have been made and Miss Pil
cher will go on the Stanford unit as
the only member from the British
lied Cross.
The personnel of the Stanford
Women's Relief Unit, which expects to
leave by the end of the week if word
is received from Washington, D. C.,
as to final instructions for departure,
has been definitely completed. Sev
eral changes were necessitated either
on account of the age requirement or
the new "brothers" clause recommend
ed by General Pershing and adopted
by Congress recently.
Miss Dorothy Egbert's case was par
ticularly regrettable for as the organ
izer of the unit she has worked ac
tively and well. Every effort has been
made to waive the "brother's" clause
in Miss Egbert's case but no excep
tion will be made by the government
as she has two brothers in the navy.
For the same reason Miss Gladys
Morgan, *12, of San Diego, and Miss
Dorothea Smith, 'IT), of Chico, have
