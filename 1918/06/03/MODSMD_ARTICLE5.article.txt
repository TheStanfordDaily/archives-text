# LAW SCHOOL WILL ADMIT SOPHOMORES IN COMING YEAR
## DEGREES UNITS REMAIN SAME BY RULE Entrance of Students Into Service Is Responsible For New Ruling 
### 
By recent action of the law fac
ulty, students will, during the period
of the war, be admitted to law courses
upon the successful completion of
forty units of University work in
stead of eighty as heretofore, and per
mitted to count toward the A. B. de
gree in the pre-legal curriculum of
ninety units of law instead of forty
as in the past.
The occasion for this change is the
situation treated by the war in which,
owing to their entrance into the pub
lic service, large numbers of students
must necessarily curtail either their
general or their professional educa
tion. By permitting sophomores to
begin the study of law and to devote
substantially two-thirds of their re
maining time to it, the department be
lieves. that in most cases students will
have an opportunity to complete a
very substantial part of tlieir profes
sional (raining before the time when
they would normally enter the service
and without abandoning their candi
dacy for the A. 13. degree. As this j
action takes immediate effect it will I
enable students who have success
fully completed tlieir freshman year
with a minimum of forty units to en
ter the Law school at the beginning
of the summer quarter.
This change leaves unaffected the
total amount of work required for the
A. 8., Llj. 8., and J. 1). degrees. It
should be noted, however, that stu
dents who count two years of law
toward the A. B. degree must offer
two additional years for the J. D. de
gree.
