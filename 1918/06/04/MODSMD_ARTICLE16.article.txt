# EVERYBODY VOTE
## 
### 
Let's have a regular election Thursday with every member of the student
body out to vote. Such an election as was held last week, with 49 votes cast
on a question which concerned every student, is a disgrace. Every citizen
in this community should be interested in the kind of government under
which he lives. Such interest was hopelessly lacking, however.
Now, the election of officers to steer Stanford student government through
another trying year is highly important. To make the year 1919 a success
the right kind of officers must be chosen, and to choose the right kind, at least
a fair degree of interest, must be manifested by everybody. But why stop at
half-way measures? Let's make this a record vote and try to rejuvenate some
o fthe interest that alone will make the year a success.
Everybody be on Quad to vote Thursday between 11 and 2.
