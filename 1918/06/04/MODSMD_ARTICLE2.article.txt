## 
### 
Salisbury Wild Life films which are
to he exhibited tonight in conjunction
with a lecture by I)r. H. C. Bryant of
the Zoology department of the Uni
versity of California, promises to he
one of the best of the series of lec
tures given this quarter, is the state
ment of those who have seen the pic
tures and heard the speaker.
Only some fifty years ago, hundreds
of thousands of bison were roaming
over our hills and plains, while today
less than 500 of these noble animals
can be found in the entire country.
Millions of passenger pigeons were
ruthlessly slaughtered; today there
is a standing reward of $50,000 for
the mere discovery of one pair of
these once plentiful birds.
It is to prevent the unfortunate rep
etition of such slaughter and extinc
tion of our game that the Fish and
Game Commission of California are
instigating in every way possible the
conservation of wild game.
The courts have ruled that the wild
fish and game are the property of the
people to do with as they feel best,
and the commissioners are working
upon the idea of educating the people
so that they will no longer destroy
their own valuable property.
The films showing the fish hatch
ery methods of transplanting trout are
extremely interesting, showing every
stage in the young trout's growth.
Through the efforts of the fish com
mission there is now enjoyed through
out the state much better fishing than
even our ancestors were able to revel
in. and these interesting films show
the methods used to accomplish this.
Many of the pictures were secured
with no little personal danger to Dr.
Bryant, who penetrated the thickest
wilds with his camera, in order to se
cure the pictures.
