# Gold Star on Black Arm Band To Be Worn
## 
### 
A black arm band with a gold star
has been recommended by the
Women's Committee of the Council of
National Defense to be worn instead
of mourning by American women who
have lost members of their family in
the service of the country.
The wearing of such insignia will,
it is felt, express better than mourn
ing the feeling of the Amreican peo
ple that such losses are a matter of
glory rather one of grief and depres
sion.
