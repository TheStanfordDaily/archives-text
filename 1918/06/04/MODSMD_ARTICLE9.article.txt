# WEB-FOOTERS TO CONGREGATE ON STANFORD QUAD
## 
### 
Next Saturday night, June 8, the
Stanford Women's Club House will be
used as a gathering place for the men
from the University of Washington
whom the breath of Mars has scat
tered from their native northern
haunt down to the different places
around San Francisco, Mare Island.
Berkeley aviation school, the Presi
dio, and Camp Fremont. Over 100
men, claiming an Alma Mater that
stands among tall pines, will meet
near the sturdy oaks of Stanford.
This will be the first time that a
group from any other University than
Stanford have given a dance upon the
campus. The clubhouse was lent
both as a tribute to the men who have
gone into service and as a courtesy
to another college.
Several football men, crew men who
have rowed against Stanford, and men
who were prominent in Washington
student affairs will be at the dance,
together with some of the ninety-five
men who arrived from the north for
the R. O. T. ('. students' training
camp at the Presidio last Sunday.
It is expected that the Washington
student body, and perhaps individuals,
or groups of individuals, will send tel
egrams of greetings and remembrance
which will be read. There will be
Washington songs, played on the
piano by well-known Washington
songsters, Washington yells, and a
Washington quartet, of which one or
two of the men were in the Washing
ton varsity quartet. And there will
be a jazz orchestra, and dancing- -
and some of the representatives of the
fair five hundred will be there to show
them what Stanford women are like.
But the dance festivities will begin
with a yell for Stanford, on whose
hospitable grounds the Washingtoni
ans will have gathered.
