## 
### 
Porcupines, bears, mountain lions,
deer, birds, and fish appeared in pro
fusion on the screen of the Little
Theater last night, when Dr. H. C.
Bryant of the University of California
gave an illustrated lecture on the
wild life of California, before a crowd
that taxed the capacity of the build
ing.
"Almost everyone is interested in
wild animals and things alive." said
the lecturer. "The interest people
have in animals is not mere fancy, but
there are real reasons for our love
for anything alive."
Dr. Hryant gave four principal rea
sons why animals should and do hold
the interest of the public. "First,"
said the speaker, "we are interested
in the dollars and cents value of our
wild game. We kill each year 12,000
deer in the state of California, each
of which has easily a money value of
$20. Other wild game is killed pro
portionately.
"Second, there is the esthetic value
of the wild creatures that roam our
hills and plains. We enjoy seeing
things in the open, in the great out
doors.
"Third, animals serve as great ed
ucational factors. They are univer
sally used for object lessons for
teaching in schools.
"Fourth, there is the debt we owe
to future generations. Who can
bring back any animal after it lias
been killed off or its species exterm
inated, as some of our wild game have
been? We must take these four val
ues into consideration in our exam
ination of wild life," said Dr. Hryant.

life history of the steelhead trout,

"Almost everyone is interested in
wild animals and things alive." said
the lecturer. "The interest people
have in animals is not mere fancy, but
there are real reasons for our love

Dr. Hryant gave four principal rea
sons why animals should and do hold
the interest of the public. "First,"
said the speaker, "we are interested
in the dollars and cents value of our
wild game. We kill each year 12,000
deer in the state of California, each
of which has easily a money value of
$20. Other wild game is killed pro
portionately.
"Second, there is the esthetic value
of the wild creatures that roam our
hills and plains. We enjoy seeing
things in the open, in the great out
doors.
"Third, animals serve as great ed
ucational factors. They are univer
sally used for object lessons for
teaching in schools.
"Fourth, there is the debt we owe
to future generations. Who can
bring back any animal after it lias
been killed off or its species exterm
inated, as some of our wild game have
been? We must take these four val
ues into consideration in our exam
ination of wild life," said Dr. Hryant.
