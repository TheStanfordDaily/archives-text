# THE
						SONG FESTIVAL SUNDAY
## 
### 
Opportunity to hear one of the most extraordinary exhibitions of vocal
music that has ever been presented on the Pacific Coast will be afforded
those who live on and near the Stanford campus, when 10,000 voices are col
lected in one vast chorus at the song festival next Sunday. I hat by far the
larger number of the personnel of this chorus will be soldiers from Camp
Fremont shows the interest that the nfien of the army are taking in a cause
for which the Stanford community is endeavoring to do its share â€”the
Woman's Civilian Relief Unit and the War Camp Community Fund. This
co-operation of the Fremont men, and the civilian men and women of this
vicinity is something which should be stimulated. It brings tlie men who
are serving our country closer to us.
The song festival will represent an almost stupendous undertaking in the
line of musical endeavor. Over 10,000 male voices in chorus, as well as a
large number of military bands, playing singly and together, will make an
entertainment that will be something big. This festival deserves the sup
port of the entire Stanford community.
