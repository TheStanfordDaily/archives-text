# TO THE NEW EDITORS
## 
### 
With this issue of the Daily Palo Alto the management of its editorial
columns passes to the newly-elected editor-in-chief, H. G. Swendsen, who was
elected unanimously to hold that position by the staff members. Swendsen
is the first man to be elected by this method as provided by the new consti
tution. Though only a sophomore in the University, Swendsen lias demon
strated his capability to fill the bill by excellent work on the staff, and in
other journalistic lines. With the amount of executive ability Swendsen
possesses prospects look bright for a successful term for the editor of Vol
ume 54.
