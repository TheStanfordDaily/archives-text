# Shining Keys go to Bright Students
## 
### 
Eighteen shining new keys have
been purchased by eighteen alert
Stanford men and women. Whether
they have entered into cahoots with
the hardware man for a monopoly on
keys is not known, but heretofore the
selling price has always been so high
that few people could afford to possess
these golden keys.
Therefore the following eighteen
Stanford men and women may feel
themselves particularly rich and are
justified in holding their heads high
in the clouds, but it is best that they
should leave their golden keys of wis
dom in full display in order that their
less fortunate acquaintances may not
presume too much in passing their in
tellectual superiors:
P. H. Cooley, Margaret Bennett, and
L. L. Chapman, history; Arthur Wal
ter, mathematics; H. H. floss and L.
S. Lyon, law; F. W. Bergstrom, chem
istry; Helen Clark and Tliurlyne Buf
fum, French; A. C. Barker, education;
H. R. Stevens, Florence Mason and
Doris Seymour, English; Ruth Graham
and Georgia Seeker, Latin; Lucile
Roush. botany; Katherine Scudder,
Greek; Lucile Townley, German.
