He'll see Gillette users in his squad lather up, shave clean, splash the soap off, tuck
the razor away, and be standing at attention in the inspection line —all in five minutes.

and on the battle fronts of the East.
Soon or late, every man who is doing things
comes to the Gillette. They belong together.

simple, compact shaving outfit, no strops or
hones to clutter up the kit—on the Gillette con

incident and not a ceremony.
