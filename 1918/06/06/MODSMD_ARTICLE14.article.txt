# STANFORD AND 1918-19
## 
### 
How about Stanford and 1918-19? Such is the big question as the first
war year for the University draws to a close, and students begin to face the
possibilities of fall. That there will be a small registration there is little
doubt, hut the University will keep running, and the prime duty of every
man and woman leaving this spring should be to bring a good freshman or
transfer back next fall. The universities of the country run on freshmen
these days, and a large, wide-awake class will guarantee a successful year
for whatever activities there may be.
The war and other causes have cut a big hole in the once proud Stanford
spirit. A handful of students takes enough interest to become acquainted
with campus affairs, hut it takes the interest of everyone to make a success
ful college. Obviously such interest cannot be given under present condi
tions, but there should be one punch left, and this should be directed toward
getting a strong first-year class next fall.
A freshman coming to college during this war is offering a double service
in gaining an education to fit himself for better service with his country, and
in being ready for call to the help of the nation at any time. The R. 0. T. C.
at this University will be a reserve for the government next year. Why not
enlist in this reserve, and at the same time attend the University and get at
least the foundation of a good education?
Things will not be as dead as it would seem at first glance. Athletics
will be continued, at least on a pure sport basis, and men will still have an
opportunity to engage in activities. The tiling is not to hinder such activities.
They should lie supported more strongly.
Look around the "old hum town" this summer. There are good men there.
Then buttonhole one of them, and make a new Stanford student next fall.
They are needed here badly.
