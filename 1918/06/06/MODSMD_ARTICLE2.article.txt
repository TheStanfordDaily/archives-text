# Students to Join Military Reserves
## U.S. Army College Training Units Will Be Formed Next October 
### 
Stanford should have a large body
of now students next fall, as the War
Department has made it possible for
a 1918 high school graduate to go to
college and to enlist for military
service at the same time. To assure
the high school graduate that he will
not lose the opportunity of serving
his country in a direct military ca
pacity by his attendance at college, lie
will he asked to join the U. S. Army
college training units that are to be
formed. In these units the student
will be liable for service at a
moment's notice, but because the stu
dent is worth more to the nation with
a college training than without it.he
will he expected to stay in college
until called by the government.
The War Department's announce
ment provides that beginning with
September, 1918, military instruction,
under officers and non-commissioned
officers of the army, will he provided
in every institution of college grade
enrolling for the instruction one hun
dred or more able-bodied students over
the age of eighteen. The necessary
military equipment will be provided by
the government. The enlistment
will constitute the student a member
of the army of the United States,
liable to active duty at the call of the
President.
This new policy aims to accomplish
a two-fold object, the War Depart
ment announces. First, to develop as
a great military asset the large bod\
of young men in the colleges; and
second, to prevent unnecessary and
wasteful depletion of the colleges
through Indiscriminate volunteering,
by offering to the students a definite
and immediate military status.
