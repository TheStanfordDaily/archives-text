Twenty-five thousand nurses are
needed by the United States govern
ment for immediate war service. The
Red Cross lias been asked to recruit
them.
These women are wanted in the ca
pacity of nurses; they are needed to
help men to get well or to die with as
little agony as possible. According to
word sent out-by the government, un
less there is an immediate response
to the call there will lie a great dearth
of nurses before midsummer is over.
That the registered nurses of the
country may respond to this exigency,
the public is asked to dispense with
nurses as much as possible in the fu
ture. "Unless your life or the life of
some member of your family hangs in
the baance, do not empoy a nurse,"
urges the surgeon general.
