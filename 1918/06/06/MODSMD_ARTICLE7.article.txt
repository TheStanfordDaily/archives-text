# GERMANY'S AMBITIONS OUTLINED BY DR. JORDAN

"German ambitions of the last fifty
years can be summed up in the term
j world control.'" said I)r. David Starr
'Jordan in an address on "Germany's
Ambitions in Both Hemispheres," this
morning in tine Assembly Hall.
"The German ambitions in foreign
lands." continued Dr. Jordan, "were
distinctly those of the Pangermanist
League which dominated Germany in
1914 and again 'in 1917. These
schemes may be briefly discribed as
follows: in Europe the ultimate recla
mation of all lost Germans. This in
volves the annexation of Holland,
Flanders, Luxembourg, the rest of
Lorraine, Burgundy, German-speaking
Switzerland, and when the time comes,
Denmark.
"A second feature was to make
France, Austria, Hungary, with Bul
garia and Turkey, vassal states.
France was to be relieved of all fear
of her 'hereditary enemy.' England,
and could devote herself to commerce
and money-lending, under the guard
ianship of Germany.
"Russia was to lie divided into six
kingdoms. These could be balanced
one against the other to the advant

age of German commerce and of Ger
man prestige.
"In India the Berlin-Bagdad scheme
involved the opening of Mesopotamia
and its settlement by Armenians, Hin
dus and Arabs, under a system of
German dukes and junkers.
"From Turkey, German ambition
looks toward India with Persia and
Egypt as collateral possibilities. In
Africa the ambition of Pangermany
is a railroad from ocean to ocean
such as the United States, Canada,
and Russia now possess. This scheme
is the answer to the Cape-to-Cairo
railroad of Cecil Rhodes. In China,
Tsingtau was to be the beginning of
another overseas empire but its fu
ture now lies in the bands of Japan.
"In America three main purposes
were developed: first, to hold the
United States and Mexico through a
propaganda of sympathy and of in
trigue; with this went occasional
threats of one sort or another. It
was imagined that I'ncle Sam was
very rich, very fat and easily scared.
If they had scanned his picture they
Band expenses—
would have seen that, he is very good
natured hut immensely determined
and absolutely impervious to either
fear or envy.
"The Germans have tried to build
HI) their commerce by undercutting
competitors. Many manufacurers used
to sell in foreign countries ,at less
than cost, the loss being made up by
their associates or by the people at
large. This has been especially fre
quent in South America.
"In Brazil, a German colony has
for years been coddled by the Kaiser.
It was supplied with arms sent to
the alleged rebel state of Connani,
north of the Amazon. But the German
people showed no enthusiasm for the
spiked helmet and Brazil has had no
difficulty in preventing a revolt.
"All of these plans seem likely to
fail. So long as Germany retains her
dynastic government so long are all
future schemes to fail.
"It is not likely that the Panger
manist society will outlive the war
which it has brought on. Its best epi
taph will be that of Anatole France:
" 'They have killed peace and now
they have killed war. They have
taken from the practice of arms all
that is held of dignity and honor.
They have made of war a monster
too ugly to live.'"
