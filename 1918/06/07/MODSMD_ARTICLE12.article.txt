account of the commencement held

why student government wailed at
Stanford this year.
"Jane Is Coming Back" is the title
of an article written by 11. S. Mar
shut.z, '17, who is now in New York
City. The same old "Marshutz"
strain of light humor may be detect
ed in this article, in which "Jane'' is
a nurse returning from the war and
finding the American women in their
newly acquired occupations.
The new features of the constitu
tion recently drafted by the student
body are commented on by Miss Ruth
I). Taylor, '19. Her contribution is
named "A New Foundation."
Other articles in the June issue of
the Review .'ire "An Unjust Attack
Upon Dr. Jordan." by Miss Dorothy
Driscoll, '20, and "Women and War
Work," by Miss Ellen Calhoun, '20.
The illustrated section is to contain
a delightful novelty in two pages of
campus sketches by Pedro J. Lemos.
Pictures of all of the men who went
to Italy in the last ambulance unit are
also given in this section.
