# AN APPRECIATION

### 
With this number The Daily Palo Alto winds up the most trying year of
its existence —a year replete with changes, far-reaching, that have left the
student body breathless. The paper, naturally reflecting the attitude of the
students, has tried to steer an even course, but in many cases has come to
grief.
To Volume 53 lias gone the honor of having the first woman editor of the
Daily. And to Miss Ruth Taylor has been given the honor of one of the best
papers ever put out at this University. Miss Taylor was in a difficult position
—in a position ordinarily occupied by a man—but she showed such ability
and backbone that she has completely won the support of even her most ardent
opponents at the beginning of her term as editor.
Miss Taylor had ideas and she expressed them well. Her policy was
always to support anything that she thought was right and to oppose every
thing that she though twas wrong. And she never supported or opposed in
any half-hearted way. nor feared the results of her actions. To her the staff
of the Daily wishes to express its appreciation for being under one who com
bined the qualities of newspaper ability and rare courage.
Had Miss Taylor been at the head of an excellent staff tier task this quar
ter would have been much simpler, but all the best men were underclassmen
in the University, and very inexperienced in the newspaper game. She had to
edit the paper and teach the other lumbers of the staff how to do thir work
also. I hit her ability was equal to the task, and the paper has always been
alive, and has consistently taken a leading part in the constructive thought
of the student body.
To such a woman the University body can wish but one wish—success.
And the staff of the paper can only hope that she will be as successful in her
larger work as she was here.
