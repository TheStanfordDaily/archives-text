### 
the Seaman family the humiliation of
disgracing the party.
"The half-hour we spent in the life
boats was similar to canoeing on an
American lake on a charming moon
light night, except that we had sus
picions that 'Fritz' was still hanging
about and might 'pot' the friendly de
stroyer boat which was picking us
up. We were landed after some three
or four hours. It was a dramatic and
unforgettable moment when we lined
up on the dock and when roll was
called everyone answered vociferous
ly "here,' and then the whole party
broke into a meaningful singing of the
I )oxology.
"One is filled with admiration for
the devotion, determination and sac
rifices of these great English people.
Everyone serves in some capacity and
both familj and state bear heroically
and without complaint any necessary
investments, deprivations, or sacri
fices made for the sake of world free
dom. One is constantly impressed
with the indispenable part women and
girls are playing in the struggle."
Mr. Seaman gives his temporary ad
dress as "Headquarters for the United
Kingdom, 47 Russel Square, London,
W. American Expeditionary Forces,
care of the Y. M. C. A."
