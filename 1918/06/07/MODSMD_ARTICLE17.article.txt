Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Due to an error on my part the
name of' (1. J. Knight appears as Man
ager of tin- 1919 Quad. This is incor
rect as Mr. Knight was not manager
the whole year. This announcement
is made in order that the record of
Stanford publications shall not be in
correct, and that those who have
Quads may be able to also add ray
name as manager as I served in that
capacity as well as editor. The pur
pose of a Stanford year-book is to
chronicle a complete record for the
year, and those having Quads are re
quested to make this change in order
that the record will remain complete.
S. E. BRIGGS.
