# JORDAN TELLS EARLY TRADITIONS AT ROBLE
## 
### 
Early traditions of the University
were called to mind by Dr. Jordan in
a talk to Itohle Club last night. Mrs.
Stanford's plans for the buildings and
the difficulties that the University had
to contest in getting on a firm finan
cial basis were recounted. Interesting
incidents concerning the early faculty
and students weer told to the amuse
ment of the listeners. Dr. Jordan sug
gested that mention of the episode in
which President Wilbur painted the
postotiice Cardinal red in a burst of
enthusiasm, when he was a student
here, might be used to advantage in
ease of difficulties.
