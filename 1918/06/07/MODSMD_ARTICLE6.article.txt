### 
Between the spring and summer
quarters there will be 110 intermission,
and the work for the twelve weeks
of the summer will begin next Tues
day, June 18, the day after commence
ment. Just how large the enrollment
will be cannot be predicted, because
of tlu j fact that this is Stanford's lirst

the new quarter.
The teaching force will consist of
