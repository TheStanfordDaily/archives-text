# To Canvass North For Women's Unit
## Miss Ellen Calhoun, '20, Will Leave for Portland and Seattle, Sunday 
### 
Plans for the canvassing of the
northwest in the interests of the Stan
ford Women's Relief unit will take
I
i definite form when Miss Ellen Cal
i houn, '20, leaves Sunday night for
| Portland, Oregon, to organize unit
S work in that city among the Stan
ford alumni and friends of the Uni
versity. A meeting will be arranged
for next Tuesday evening at which
Miss Palhoun will present the purpose,
necessity, and organization of the
unit and ask for financial support
from the alumi present. A committee
for further canvassing will be appoint
ed and Assistant Registrar J. E. Mc-
Dowell is confident of good results.
Miss Calhoun will do the same work
! in Seattle, where she is well known,
and the response to the financial ap
i peal in that city ought to be even
, more encouraging. If possible Spo-
I kane will be organized later in the
1 summer, thus giving the alumni ample
J opportunity to support their Alma
, Mater in the splendid war work which
| she has undertaken.
Waiting only for the final word
from Washington, I). C., the Stanford
unit stands ready to leave on a forty
eight hour notice. All plans as to the
internal organization of the unit have
! been perfected and arrangements for
reports to the advisory board as to
the progression of the work of the
j unit while in France are made.
Only months of unceasing work on
| the part of a few have made the Stan
for unit possible. Miss Dorothy Eg
i bert. '16, Miss Isabel McCracken, and
| Assistant Registrar J. E. McDowell
j deserve particular credit for their
loyal and continuous efforts. Through
j these people the enthusiastic support
i of the Red Cross has been gained,
without which the unit would have
| been impossible. The faculty has lent
I its hearty co-operation whenever it
| has been asked for in either the actual
{ organization of the unit or in cam
! paigning for the funds to make up the
necessary thirty thousand. When the
Stanford unit does leave it will truly
represent the efforts of loval Stanford
I men and women.
