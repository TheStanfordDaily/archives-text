training camp, with the great majority
of the men students enrolled in the
United States Army. This i> the sys
tem of the Students' Army Training
Corps, which purposes to turn American
universities into "reservoirs of officer
material" for the duration of the war.
1 His university also has been selected
as the temporary headquarters for the
S. A. r. C. for the district of Califor
nia, Nevada, and Utah, and President
j Wilbur has been appointed District Kdu
| cational Director for the district. Major
J D. M. Moore is military commandant of
j the district. Ihe War Department has
I accepted eighteen college and universi
ties in these three states for the location
of S. A. T. C. units.
On October Ist. the day after registra
tion, all students who are registrants
under the selective service regulations
who are physically fit to perform full
I or limited military duty may lie induct
ed into the service of the United States.
I hey become at once subject to military
law and military discipline and an
placed upon an active duty statu-;. The
Government will provide tuition, uni
form, barracks, and subsistence. ; nd will
pay each student $30 a month, the pay
iof a private in the army.
All Instructions to Have
Military Vaalue
The instruction provided the S. A.
I. C. will be partly military and pa rtly
in allied subjects that have a value as
a means of training officers and techni
cal experts to meet the needs of the
service. Military instruction will cover
eleven hours per week, including prac
tical and theoretical instruction and
physical training. In addition the stu
dent is required to take a course of
nine hours on the "Issues of the War"
and at least thirty-three hours in sub
jects approved by the department hav
ing charge of his collegiate instruction
and acceptable to the regional director.
1 hese hours include recitations, lec
tuns, laboratory work, and supervised
study in preparation therefor. The work
will amount practically to the equivalent
of twenty-five hours under the normal
system.
Technical subjects are naturally em
phasized in the list of approved studies,
and special attention is called to the
military importance of the study of Ger
man, particularly to students who al
ready have some knowledge of the lan
guage.
Strenuous Daily
Program Outlined
A strenuous daily program awaits the
member of the S. A. T. C., according
to tentative plans outlined. He will have
to be out of bed by 5:15, as reveille will
probably be held at 5 :30 or 6. Physical
exercises and breakfast will occupy the
time from that hour till 8, when instruc
tion begins. From 8 to 4 the time will
be occupied by classes and supervised
study, and drill will be held from 4 to
6. At 7:30 the men are to be in their
rooms, and to bed at 9:30. Saturday!
afternoon and Sunday will be vacations. |
The men will be arbitrarily assigned
to companies and to rooms at Encina
Hall, which is to be used as a barracks
for all except upperclass engineering
and technical students and pre-medical
students, who will be quartered in the
old Roble Hall, now renamed Sequoia.

All Instructions to Have
Military Vaalue
The instruction provided the S. A.
I. C. will be partly military and pa rtly
in allied subjects that have a value as
a means of training officers and techni
cal experts to meet the needs of the
service. Military instruction will cover
eleven hours per week, including prac
tical and theoretical instruction and
physical training. In addition the stu
dent is required to take a course of
nine hours on the "Issues of the War"
and at least thirty-three hours in sub
jects approved by the department hav
ing charge of his collegiate instruction
and acceptable to the regional director.
1 hese hours include recitations, lec
tuns, laboratory work, and supervised
study in preparation therefor. The work
will amount practically to the equivalent
of twenty-five hours under the normal
system.
Technical subjects are naturally em
phasized in the list of approved studies,
and special attention is called to the
military importance of the study of Ger
