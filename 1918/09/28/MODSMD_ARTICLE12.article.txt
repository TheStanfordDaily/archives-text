### 
Tomorrow morning Roble Hall, one
of the most up-to-date and best
equipped dormitories in the world, will
open its doors to the women of the
I niversity. Through the untiring ef
forts of Miss Harriet Bradford, dean
of women, and her associates, the ne.v
building has opened on time.
"Marvels have been accomplished,"
said Miss Bradford. "We have had to
meet war conditions at every turn. Our
furniture was delayed in the congested
freight centers and four days ago the
reception hall was piled to the ceiling
with uncrated furniture."
Miss Bradford prefers that the fresh
man women plan to move in Saturday
afternoon unless some urgent reason
necessitates their entering tomorrow
morning.
"We must ask that the women he
patient," Miss Bradford continued. The
dormitory is ready to live in, hut screws
and rods will have to be putin some
of the rooms which will necessitate the
men going in and out, hut such incon
veniences will he over within a week."
A provisional committee has hern
appointed to take over the governtne.it
of tlie new Rohle until the new organ

3 l c l°H M3U 31 8 ll ! u.mioM jo j,ii[iunu
Miss Gertrude Gardiner will art as
matron and her splendid management
of the old dormitory will insure the
success of the new Rohle.
Everything in Rohle is new. Oak
furniture of a simple design in the bed
rooms carries out the good taste of the
whole building. The dining rooms, re
ception hall and parlors are furnished
in the Italian style. Between six and
eight girls will be assigned to each
table. Soft buff walls lend a tone of
cheerfulness to the dormintory which
the old building lacked. Every conven
ience is to be found, deep closets, show
ers, modern plumbing, well arranged
lights, and a fully equipped Jaundry.
The winding drives from the sides of
the building and the main driveway
leading up to the circle in front o;
Rohle lend a charm which the soft
.stone and simple lines of the building
complete. The Stanford campus may
well lie proud of the new Rohle.

rooms carries out the good taste of the
whole building. The dining rooms, re
ception hall and parlors are furnished
in the Italian style. Between six and
eight girls will be assigned to each
table. Soft buff walls lend a tone of
cheerfulness to the dormintory which
the old building lacked. Every conven
ience is to be found, deep closets, show
ers, modern plumbing, well arranged
lights, and a fully equipped Jaundry.
The winding drives from the sides of
the building and the main driveway
leading up to the circle in front o;
Rohle lend a charm which the soft
.stone and simple lines of the building
complete. The Stanford campus may
well lie proud of the new Rohle.
