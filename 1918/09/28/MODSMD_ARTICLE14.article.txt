### 
The Daily Palo Alto with this issue
begins Stanford's greatest year, a year
of service dedicated to the winning of
the war. Together with every other
department in the University, the only
college paper left will be a War insti
tution. Present plans call for but three
editions a week. This is made neces
sary by pressure of time on the men
who will be enrolled in the Students'
Army Training Corps. Should the time
and necessity develop later for a paper
every day of the week, this will be
done.
The primary purpose of the paper
this year will lie to serve the men in
the Students' Army Training Corps, al
though tin- women of the University
and the men not enrolled for military
training will be given the attention con
sistent with their needs. Plans have
been made with Professor E. E. Robin
son, Dr. Wilbur's assistant in the direc
tion of the S. A. T. C. in Utah, Ne
vada. and California, and with Captain
Samuel Parker, military commandant
at the University, for the latest material
on S. A. T. C. organization and plans.
Throughout the next year, by means
of articles, editorials., etc.. the Daily
Palo Alto will endeavor to create in
the S. A. T. C. a spirit of service
worthy of the Stanford men who are
doing their best in Europe and Asia.
The old interests of University stu
dents have passed completely away.
Every man at college this year will
have one purpose back of all his ac
tions—to do his best in military classes.
The penalty for doing otherwise will
lie too great. The paper will direct as
best it can this interest into channels
for the good of the whole organization.
As a means of keeping the University
students in touch with campaigns of the
war. arrangements have been made by
the Daily Palo Alto to print each
week an article on the progress of the
war. Professor P. J. Treat of the His
tory department, who lias, for the last
year, made an intensive study of the
military campaigns, their objectives and
progress, will be the author of these
articles For the present this news will
be printed every Friday.
As a further means of serving the
community, the business staff of the
Daily Palo Ai.to has completed ar
rangements with the University author
ities to print every week the University
Calendar. A full page will be devoted
to the announcements which would nor
mally be printed by the University sep
arately.
Other material vital to a community
interested in the war as this commun
ity is. will be run. The great space

normally devoted to college activities
will he practically eliminated, and more
widely inteersting matter will be used
in its place.
The paper will make an effort to
develop an esprit dc corps in the Stu
dents' Army Training Corps that will
give a man from this particular organ
ization an immediate advantage in the
military world.
As the year progresses, it will he
come more and more necessary for
women to take up work on the Daily
Palo Alto. With this in view, every
member of the "5(H)" who makes a try
for the editorial i>r business staff of the
paper will be given every opportunity
to make good.
The men o fthe University who are
not enlisted in the S. A. T. C. will be
offered a chance to take up the active
management of the paper, and keep
alive some of the traditions of the Uni
versity in the past.

vada. and California, and with Captain
Samuel Parker, military commandant
at the University, for the latest material
on S. A. T. C. organization and plans.
Throughout the next year, by means
of articles, editorials., etc.. the Daily
Palo Alto will endeavor to create in
the S. A. T. C. a spirit of service
worthy of the Stanford men who are
doing their best in Europe and Asia.
The old interests of University stu
dents have passed completely away.
Every man at college this year will
have one purpose back of all his ac
tions—to do his best in military classes.
The penalty for doing otherwise will
lie too great. The paper will direct as
best it can this interest into channels
for the good of the whole organization.
As a means of keeping the University
students in touch with campaigns of the
war. arrangements have been made by
the Daily Palo Alto to print each
week an article on the progress of the
war. Professor P. J. Treat of the His
tory department, who lias, for the last
year, made an intensive study of the
military campaigns, their objectives and
progress, will be the author of these
articles For the present this news will
be printed every Friday.
As a further means of serving the
community, the business staff of the
Daily Palo Ai.to has completed ar
rangements with the University author
ities to print every week the University
Calendar. A full page will be devoted
to the announcements which would nor
mally be printed by the University sep
arately.
Other material vital to a community
interested in the war as this commun
ity is. will be run. The great space

normally devoted to college activities
will he practically eliminated, and more
widely inteersting matter will be used
in its place.
The paper will make an effort to
develop an esprit dc corps in the Stu
dents' Army Training Corps that will
give a man from this particular organ
ization an immediate advantage in the
military world.
As the year progresses, it will he
come more and more necessary for
women to take up work on the Daily
Palo Alto. With this in view, every
member of the "5(H)" who makes a try
for the editorial i>r business staff of the
paper will be given every opportunity
to make good.
The men o fthe University who are
not enlisted in the S. A. T. C. will be
offered a chance to take up the active
management of the paper, and keep
alive some of the traditions of the Uni
versity in the past.
The Daily Palo Alto with this issue
begins Stanford's greatest year, a year
of service dedicated to the winning of
the war. Together with every other
department in the University, the only
college paper left will be a War insti
tution. Present plans call for but three
editions a week. This is made neces
sary by pressure of time on the men
who will be enrolled in the Students'
Army Training Corps. Should the time
and necessity develop later for a paper
every day of the week, this will be
done.
The primary purpose of the paper
this year will lie to serve the men in
the Students' Army Training Corps, al
though tin- women of the University
and the men not enrolled for military
training will be given the attention con
sistent with their needs. Plans have
been made with Professor E. E. Robin
son, Dr. Wilbur's assistant in the direc
tion of the S. A. T. C. in Utah, Ne
vada. and California, and with Captain
Samuel Parker, military commandant
at the University, for the latest material
