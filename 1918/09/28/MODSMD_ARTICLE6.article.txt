## War Department Telegram Prescribes Courses Engineers 
### 
Professor G. 11. Maix of the Mechan
ical Engineering Department has re
ceived a telegram frnn the Committee
on Education prescribing a course in
Mechanical Engineering for those mem
bers in Group 4 of the S. A. '!'. C. This
is also the course, as Jar as is known at
present, to be prescribed for those in
the Naval and Marine units. The same
course is specified for Electrical En
gineering. A similar telegram covering
Civil Engineering is expected at any
time.
The telegram follows:

Professor G. 11. Maix of the Mechan
ical Engineering Department has re
ceived a telegram frnn the Committee
on Education prescribing a course in
Mechanical Engineering for those mem
bers in Group 4 of the S. A. '!'. C. This
is also the course, as Jar as is known at
present, to be prescribed for those in
the Naval and Marine units. The same
course is specified for Electrical En
gineering. A similar telegram covering
Civil Engineering is expected at any
time.
The telegram follows:
