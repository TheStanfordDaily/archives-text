STUDENTS OF THE GREAT LELAND STANFORD JUNIOR
UNIVERSITY,
Stanford and Palo Alto, .California,
Dear Friends:
With the opening of the new school year, we write to invite your
patronage for our Hank in Palo Alto, which now bears your College n'nne.
It has never been the policy of the Stanford Bank of Palo Alto, nor
its predecessor, the Maytield Bank, to make any charge whatever on Stan
ford Students' accounts, and we have rendered a valuable service as an
accommodation to hundreds of students without expense to them, when
other Banks were charging. We now operate the former Mayfield Bank
as a Branch, our Head Office being situated at No. 161 University, Ave.,
Palo Alto, where it will be convenient for you to use our Bank, and we
invite your valued account on the grounds of perfect safety, and an equal
if not superior service rendered without discriminatory charge on you : -
individual students.
We offer you safety, first, last and always, guaranteed by every - ife
guard that money can buy, and that careful state inspection and local con
servative management can give.
A name which identifies you with your own great Stanford Uni
versity—each check flying your college pennant—thus .carrying its colors
all over this broad land, and directing attention to our College, our City,
and even our great State of California.
The most modern statement system of keeping your accounts in the
world and, until ours came, the only one of its kind in Palo Alto—the
latest Burroughs Adding Machine System.
If you are not already committed or obligated to some other Bank,
and you feel that our Bank has in the past treated you satisfactorily and
fair, we solicit your valued account, especially that of any organization or
Club 1o which you may belong or which under the new regime may be
formed, guaranteeing you perfect safety and the same satisfactory service
rendered you absolutely free as individual students, now, and for the past
two years. Yours very truly,
THE STANFORD BANK.
Charles Ellkt, Cashier.
P. S. —We pay 4 r /r interest on monthly balances on savings. No int r
est forfeited.
