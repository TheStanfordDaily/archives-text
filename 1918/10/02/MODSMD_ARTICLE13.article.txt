# THE
						STUDENTS ARMY TRAINING CORPS
## 
### 
Yesterday at an appointed hour all
over the l nited States, the Students'
Army Training Corps units officially
became a part of Uncle Sam's
army, devoted to the defeat of the
"gang" in Prussia. Stanford's unit,
made up of the best the University
has to offer, was dedicated to the
Nation at 9 o'clock in the morning.
Such a sight as the brains of the na
tion taking its place by the side of the
great army already organized cannot
but arouse the thought that this nation
must win a glorious victory.
The Students' Army Training Corps
will be a wonderful help to the nation
in time of peace as in time of war.
The universities of this nation are be
coming .'gy. The courses offered are
in many casts alarmingly the same as
those given many years ago. The stu
dents are becoming shiftless. This war
has brought such facts to light, and
these facts have bothered the educators
of the nation.
I l ,nt intensive study in the S. A. T. C.
cannot but change such practices. The
universities have been jolted into action
by the government. The old was over
thrown and the new instituted over
night, and now the youth of the coun
try will In given a taste of the new.
The effect is bound to be lasting. Both
universities and students will be dis
satisfied with the old courses and cus
toms, and will demand the new.
The student entering Stanford this
year will have an opportunity to show
what In is capable of. There will be
no distractions, and a failure in either
military training or class work proper
will be evidence that a man should not
be in a- university, and be given spe
cial training by the government.
The chance to lie of real service to
the government is here. It is up to
the individual to make good.
