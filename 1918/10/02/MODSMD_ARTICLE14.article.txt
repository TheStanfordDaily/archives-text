# YOUR OLD CLOTHES
## 
### 
Some thousand men have donned
a uniform at Stanford for the
duration of the war. In Belgium and
Northern France many times a thou
sand are suffering for want of cloth
ing. Many of the people are in such
an acute situation that they are act
ually dying for want of covering for
their bodies.
As an example of what the Students'
Army Training Corps men will do
later, all clothing discarded for that of
Uncle Sam should be turned over to
the Committee on Belgian Relief in

Palo Alto. An item will be found in
the news columns of the Daily Palo
Alto explaining in detail how clothing
can reach this committee. The cause
is a good one, and every piece of cloth
ing will be gratefully received.
