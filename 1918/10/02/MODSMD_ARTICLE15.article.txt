The Students' Army Training Corps
will and must change many customs
in the University, but it should serve
to emphasize rather than discard the
â– Id tradition existing on the Earm that
Stanford men always speak to each
other.
The number of new students at the
University this year is larger than ever
before, but there are yet enough old
men left to keep up the speaking cus
tom. This should most emphaticalyl
be done.
And to the tie wmen, when some one
speaks to you. return his salute cheer
ily; do not stare with your mouth open.
This is Stanford University. It is a
democratic institution. Such customs
arc possible for this reason.
