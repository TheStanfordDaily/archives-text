# ICHEDA COLLECTION WILL BE EXHIBITED
## 
### 
Stanford's famous Oriental collec
tion, the Icheda collection, is to be put
on exhibition in the Art Museum some
time early next week. The Icheda col
lection is to replace the Egyptian dis
play which is now being exhibited
there.
The Icheda collection is one of the
leading â–  Oriental collections in the
United States. Oxfords anthropolo
gist, Dr. Sayce, and other Oriental ex
perts who have examined the collec
tion have commented upon it highly.
Chinese and Japanese paintings and
Chinese pottery dating back to 200 B.
compose the collection in the main
; art. The Egyptian collection which it
is to replace is to be returned to the
Egytpiaan room in the Museum.
