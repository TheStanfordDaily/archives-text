# NEW ROBLE HALL IS RANKED AS FINEST DORMITORY
## 
### 
New Roble Hafl was opened Satur
day morning to two hundred women ;
entering or returning t(» Stanford Uni-'
versity. Many more women than were j
expected asked for rooms in the new
dormitory and for this season the third
wing had to be opened. The Univers-j
ity ha<J planned to open only two wings!
in the new building.
Roble Hall is one of the most mod
ern and best equipped dormitories in j
the United States. No pains were
spared by the authorities in charge of
its construction, thus making the cul
mination of their efforts a splendid
edifice.
Completion of 'the building, itself,
was accomplished last spring. -During
the summer the interior was finished j
and the furnishings were installed. By j
last Saturday the dormitory was ready I
for occupancy.
All of the furniture intended for the
new hall did not arrive when it was
expected. For this reason a great
'mount of unpacking and moving was
done in the last few days before the
opening of college. As yet the rugs
have not been put down and the stairs
are still uncarpeted.
Miss Gertrude Gardiner, who was
matron of the old Roble Hall .is con
tinning in that position in the new hall.
Roble Club, the organization of the
women living in the old dormitory, will
be continued this year. Officers have
not been chosen as yet. however. The
hall is at present under the manage
ment of five women chosen from the
residents at tin old Roble and Madrono
halls last year.
An entirely new feature in the new
hall is the "hashing" done by t he
women. Since the organization of the
Students' Army Training Corps for
college men none are available for this
service. The twin dining rooms at
'! were opened Monday with
women "hashers" serving each table.
In this way maay women will lie able
to partially earn their way through
c< 'liege.
\■ 1 freshman v omon are required to
reside in Rome Mall during their first
'•ear in Stanford University. The new
women hav b-on put into singh rooms
and the old women are occupying the
suites of rooms for which they drew
last quarter. The suites are composed
of two bed rooms and one study.
In the large reception room on the
lirst tlo< r of Roble ilie furniture is
particularly tasteful. Heavy velvet
rugs have been placed on the floor and
upholstered chairs and divans are
placed in the rooms. The tables are
o fdark oak, as are all of the furnish
ings in the wotrr ns rooms.
