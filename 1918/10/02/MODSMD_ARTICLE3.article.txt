A Message from the President of
the United States to the Members
of the Students' Army Training
Corps:
"The step you have taken is a
most significant one. By it you
have ceased to be merely individu
als, each seeking to perfect him
self to win his own place in the
world, and have become comrades
in the common cause of making
the world a better place to live in.
You hav£ joined yourselves with
the entire manhood of the coun
try and pledged, as did your fore
fathers, 'your lives, your fortunes
and your sacred honor,' to the free
dom of humanity.
"The enterprise upon which you
have embarked is a hazardous and
difficult one. This is not a schol
astic struggle. It is a war of ideals,
yet fought with all the devices of
science and with the power of ma
chines. To succeed you must not
only be inspired by the ideals for
which this country stands, but you
must also be masters of the tech
nique with which the battle is
fought. You must not only be
thrilled with zeal for the common
welfare, but you must also be mas
ters of the weapons of today.
"There can be no doubt of the
issue. The spirit that is revealed
and» the manner in which America
has responded to the call is indom
itable. I have no doubt that you,
too, will use your utmost strength
to maintain that spirit and to carry
it forward to final victory that will
certainly be ours."
(Signed) Wooimow Wilson.
