# "BULGARIA TO AID ALLIES"
## Prof. Treat Will Give Weekly War Review 
### 
I ntil further notice tlie Daily Palo Alto will run, on Friday of each week,
a brief summary of the developments in the war during the preceding seven
days. These summaries will he prepared by Professor P. J. Treat, of thi History
department. Because of space limitations and the great number of interesting
events which should he chronicled the references must necessarily he brief. They
will, as far as possible, be based on official or well-authenticated information, and
will deal with events rather than with forecasts.'—Editor'* Note.

I he most striking as well as the most
important event of the past week was
the unconditional surrender of Bul
garia. I his followed with startling
rapidity the success of tlie Allies' drive
in Macedonia, which opened 011 Septem
ber 15. On that day the Serbian and
French forces and a Jugo-Slav unit at
tacked on a twelve-mile front west of
the Vardar River, with immediate suc
cess. I hree days later the British and
Greek armies, to the east, joined the
attack, and later an Italian force 011 the
extreme left. By that time tlie battle
front was about eighty miles long,
! hese operations soon cut the two rail
way lines connecting the Bulgarian
front and separated the two Bulgarian
armies which were retiring through
very difficult country. 011 the 25th the
British were over the frontier in Bul
garia, while the important towns of Pri
lep, Veles and I skub, in Serbia, had
been regained. In Sofia anti-German
and peace demonstrations were taking
place. The Premier, Malinoff, was op
posed to the German party, and al
though it is not yet clear exactly what
happened at the capital, on Friday last,
September 27th, Bulgarian representa
tives appeared at the headquarters of
Gen. D'Psperey and asked for a forty
eight-hour armistice until their accred
ited agents might arrive to negotiate
terms of surrender. No armistice was
granted. Soon the Bulgarian Minister
of Finance and one of the generals
reached Saloniki, and on Monday they
accepted the Allies' terms. Hostilities
were to cease at noon that day, but up
to that hour the Allies continued their
advance, the maximum gain, in a
straight line, being some seventy-five
miles.
'1 he terms laid down by the Allies
provided for the evacuation, by Bul
garia. of Serbian and Greek territory,
the demobilization of their army, the
surrender of their arms and munitions,
the turning over to the Allies of all
means of transport (including railways
and boats on the Danube), the occupa
tion of strategic points by the Allies,
and free passage through Bulgaria for
military operations.
End of Imperial Dream
The withdrawal of Bulgaria from the
collapse of the German Mittel-Furopa
dream, the severance of communications
between the Central Powers and Tur
key, and the opportunity for the Allies
to strike both Austria and Turkey from
the rear. Rumania may also enter the
war again, receiving supplies through
Bulgaria.
Although no American troops took
part in these operations, it is safe to say
that America played a prominent role
in the securing of results. The presence
of the large American forces on the
western front, which gave Foch the in
itiative. placed such pressure 011 the
Germans that they could not go to the
aid of their hard-pressed Ally, while a
firm confidence in the fairness of Amer
ica and of her principles doubtless en
couraged Malinoff to accept the tempo
ran terms laid down by the Allies. It
is of interest to note that on Mie day the
Bulgarians asked for an armis-ic;.
President Wilson, in New York, re
stated the principles for which Amciic'i
would stand in the peace conference.
"Impartial justice" underlies the Ameri
can program, and this is all Bulgaria,
or any of the other enemy states, could
desire.
in Palestine, General Allenby and the
Allied forces continued to advance. On
I uesdav, October Ist, Damascus was

taken. 'I his marked an advance of 130
miles since September 19, the destruc
! lion of three Turkish armies, and the
capture of over 50,00(3 prisoners. This
disaster, coupled with the surrender of
1 Bulgaria, should react promptly in Tur
key.
Franco-Americans Halt Reserves
On the western front, Marshal Foch
! continued his brilliant tactics of striking
the Germans repeatedly at different
points. On Thursday, the 26th, a
Franco - American force smashed
through in the Champagne. The Amer
icans struck on a twenty-mile front be
tween the Argonne forest and the
Meuse, the French on a similar front
west of the Argonne to Auberive. The
objectives were, apparently, to do as
much damage as possible, prevent Ger
man reserves from being sent to Pi
cardv or Flanders, and turn the German
line running west to Laon.
I his was followed, on Saturday, by
a Belgian-British drive in Flanders,
which proved to be the major operation
of the week. Beginning on a line from
Ypres to Dixmude, the front has been
extended on both sides. The advance
lias threatened the German iorces on
the Belgian coast, as well as the Lille
triangle. On Wednesday a French army
was thrown into this sector. General
Dcgoutte's army, which had been oper
ating north or Soissotis. The "successes
in Flanders caused a general retirement
along the Armentieres-Lens front, both
towns being evacuated on Tuesday.
In Picardy, the British resumed the
offensive on Friday, between Camhrai
and St. Quentin, on a seventeen-mile
front. Iwo American divisions took
part on the right of the line, and were
involved in some of the heaviest light
ing. In this sector some nine German
divisions held the line. The British
j American advance succeeded so well
that on Tuesday the French, advancing
! from the southeast, entered St. Quentin.
The Allied line now runs east of that
important bulwark of the Hindenburg
: line.
Npw French Army Entered by Foch
; Finally, on Tuesday, Foch threw in
! a new army. Gen Berthelot's. northwest
of Rhcims, which has now cleared out
almost all the sector between the Vesle,
Aisne, and Aisne-Marne canal.
I oday the Germans are being pound

St. Quentin lias been taken. La Fere is
