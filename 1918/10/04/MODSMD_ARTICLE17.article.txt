# S.A.T.C. ENGINEERS RECEIVE SPECIAL SCHEDULES
## MARX OUTLINES WORK Naval Section of Corps to Be Included According to Bulletin 
### 
Professor Charles I). Marx of the
Engineering department has just re
ceived from the Committee on Educa
tion and Special Training a special bul
letin on programs in engineering for
S. A. T. C. men.
In addition to the instruction indi
cated in these courses, eleven hours per
week of military instruction as pre
scribed for the first two terms of the
program, and six hours per week for
the remainder of the program. The
total time to he devoted is fifty-three
hours per week. The time that a stu
dent will be permitted to pursue the
course depends upon the needs of the
service and the academic record of the
student.
It is suggested that as far as prac
ticable students in the naval section of
the S. A. T. C. follow an approved
course in mechanical engineering. The
programs follow:

Engineering department has just re
ceived from the Committee on Educa
tion and Special Training a special bul
letin on programs in engineering for
S. A. T. C. men.
In addition to the instruction indi
cated in these courses, eleven hours per
week of military instruction as pre
scribed for the first two terms of the
program, and six hours per week for
the remainder of the program. The
total time to he devoted is fifty-three
hours per week. The time that a stu
dent will be permitted to pursue the
course depends upon the needs of the
service and the academic record of the
student.
It is suggested that as far as prac
ticable students in the naval section of
the S. A. T. C. follow an approved
course in mechanical engineering. The
programs follow:
