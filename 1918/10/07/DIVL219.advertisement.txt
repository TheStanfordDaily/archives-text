STUDEXTS OF THE GREAT LELAN'D STANFORD" JUXIQR
UXIVERSI'I V,
Stanford and Palo Alto, California.
Dear Friends:
With the opening of the- new school year, vve write to invite vour
patronage for our Bank in Palo Alto, which now hears your College'name.
It has never been the polic\ of the Stanford Hank of Palo Alto, nor
its predecessor, the Mayfield Bank, to make any charge whatever on Stan
ford Students' accounts, and we have rendered a valuable service as an
accommodation to hundreds of students without expense to them, wKn
other Banks were charging. We now operate the former May field Bank
as a Branch, our Head Ot'tice being situated at Xo. 161 University, Aw.,
Palo Alto, where it will be convenient for you to use our Bank, and we
invite your valued account on the grounds of perfect safety, and an equal
if not superior service rendered without discriminatory charge on you as
individual students.
We offer you safety, first, last and always, guaranteed by every safe
guard that money can buy, and that careful state inspection and local con
servative management can give.
A name which identifies you with your own great Stanford Uni
versity—each check flying your college pennant—thus carrying its colors
all over this broad, land, and directing attention to our College, our City,
and even our great State of California.
The most modern statement system of keeping your accounts in the
world and, until ours came, the only one of its kind in Palo Alto—the
latest Burroughs Adding Machine System.
If you are not already committed or obligated to some other Bank,
and you feel that our Bank has in the past treated you satisfactorily and
fair, we solicit your valued account, especially that of any organization or
Club to which you may belong or which under the new regime may be
formed, guaranteeing you perfect , safety and the. same satisfactory service
rendered you absolutely free as individual students, now, and for the past
two vcars. Yours very truly,
THE STAXFORD BAXK.
