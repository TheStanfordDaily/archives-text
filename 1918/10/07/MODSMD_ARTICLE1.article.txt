# ARTILLERY OFFICERS' CAMP OPEN TO MEN IN S.A.T.C.
## BRANCH NEEDS RECRUITS Will Be Sent to Fortress Monroe, Virginia, for Further Training 
### 
Members of the S. A. T. C. are eligi
ble to apply for admission to the Offi
cers' Training Camp for coast artillery
at Fortress Monroe. Va., according to a
communication received by President
Wilbur from Colonel A. M. Hunter,
commanding officer of the South Pa
cific Coast artillery district.
The communication follows:
My Pair Doctor Wilbur:
1 am informed that you are the di
rector of the California district for the
Student Army Training C°rps. By di
rection of the chief of coast artillery 1
desire to take up with you the subject
of officer material for the Coast Ar
tillery Corps. The coast artillery fur
nishes at this time for service over
seas organizations which man all guns
of 6-inch and higher caliber, including
both motorized and railroad artillery,
anti-aircraft artillery, trench mortars
and certain ammunition trains. The
( )fficers' Training Camp at Fort Mon
roe. \ irginia, starts a new course each
month. The following are the requi
sites for coast artillery candidates for
officers :
. Iritlimctic—Decimal fractions, square
root, metric system, conversion of
units.
.jlgebra—Use of formulae, drill in
positive and negative numbers, addi
tion, subtraction, multiplication, division
of literal expressions, solution of sim
ple equations, a thorough knowledge
of tlie theory of logarithms.
Pi; lie Geometry—Elementary theo
rems, particularly those on parallel
lines, similar triangles, and problems of
constructon and angles inscribed in
circles. A careful study of right tri
angles should be made.
Trigonometry — Angles and their
measurements (degrees, mils, grads),
solution of right and oblique triangles,
law of sines, law of tangents, law of
cosines, and the simple formulae of
goniotnetry.
Co-ordinate Geometry—Definition of
rectangular co-ordinates, plotting sim
ple curves, formulae for distances be
tween two points whose co-ordinates
are known and the slope of the line.
I se of Scales and Tables—Abundant
practice in reading scales and usitit;
trigonometric and logarithmic tables
should be given.
The Transit—The student should
know nomenclature and use of the
transit when he comes to us. Much
practice should be given in reading
verniers. Practice in running traverses
and determining true north by obser
vations on the sun and on Polaris.
The chief of coast artillery recently
recommended that the coast artillery
be given priority on 200 suitably trained
men per week. We have through th'e
Enlisted Specialists' Preparatory School
at Eort Winlield Scott obtained consid
erable officer material from tlie Uni
versity of California and some few
from other colleges within your dis
trict. 1 write to ask if you will kindly
disseminate the above information
through the colleges in this district
with a view to encouraging applica
tions for attendance at the Coast Ar
tillery Training Camp at Eort Monroe.
Virginia. In this connection it may be
said that men inducted from deferred
classification of the draft who fail to
secure commissions may upon their
own application return to private life
and remain in the same deferred clas
sification as originallv given to them.

My Pair Doctor Wilbur:
1 am informed that you are the di
rector of the California district for the
Student Army Training C°rps. By di
rection of the chief of coast artillery 1
desire to take up with you the subject
of officer material for the Coast Ar
tillery Corps. The coast artillery fur
nishes at this time for service over
seas organizations which man all guns
of 6-inch and higher caliber, including
both motorized and railroad artillery,
anti-aircraft artillery, trench mortars
and certain ammunition trains. The
( )fficers' Training Camp at Fort Mon
roe. \ irginia, starts a new course each
month. The following are the requi
sites for coast artillery candidates for
officers :
. Iritlimctic—Decimal fractions, square
root, metric system, conversion of
units.
.jlgebra—Use of formulae, drill in
positive and negative numbers, addi
tion, subtraction, multiplication, division
of literal expressions, solution of sim
ple equations, a thorough knowledge
of tlie theory of logarithms.
Pi; lie Geometry—Elementary theo
rems, particularly those on parallel
lines, similar triangles, and problems of
constructon and angles inscribed in
circles. A careful study of right tri
angles should be made.
Trigonometry — Angles and their
measurements (degrees, mils, grads),
solution of right and oblique triangles,
law of sines, law of tangents, law of
cosines, and the simple formulae of
goniotnetry.
Co-ordinate Geometry—Definition of
rectangular co-ordinates, plotting sim
ple curves, formulae for distances be
tween two points whose co-ordinates
are known and the slope of the line.
I se of Scales and Tables—Abundant
practice in reading scales and usitit;
trigonometric and logarithmic tables
should be given.
The Transit—The student should
know nomenclature and use of the
transit when he comes to us. Much
practice should be given in reading
verniers. Practice in running traverses
and determining true north by obser
vations on the sun and on Polaris.
The chief of coast artillery recently
recommended that the coast artillery
be given priority on 200 suitably trained
men per week. We have through th'e
Enlisted Specialists' Preparatory School
at Eort Winlield Scott obtained consid
erable officer material from tlie Uni
versity of California and some few
from other colleges within your dis
trict. 1 write to ask if you will kindly
disseminate the above information
through the colleges in this district
with a view to encouraging applica
tions for attendance at the Coast Ar
tillery Training Camp at Eort Monroe.
Virginia. In this connection it may be
said that men inducted from deferred
classification of the draft who fail to
secure commissions may upon their
own application return to private life
and remain in the same deferred clas
sification as originallv given to them.
Members of the S. A. T. C. are eligi
ble to apply for admission to the Offi
cers' Training Camp for coast artillery
at Fortress Monroe. Va., according to a
communication received by President
Wilbur from Colonel A. M. Hunter,
commanding officer of the South Pa
