# THE 						WAR REVIEW
## 
### 
Very few communities in the United
States have the opportunity of reading
such accurate information on the cam
paigns of the war as that furnished by
Professor I'. J. Treat of the History
department in his weekly articles pub
lished by the Daily Palo Alto. Not
attempting to forecast, but merely to
explain the facts as they have hap
pened. Professor Treat has given, and
will give iiijiirmation of the greatest
importance and interest to the Uni
versity.
His article last Eriday explained the
Bulgarian situation as it is not possible
to explain it in the news dispatches. The
facts were present, unbiased, and no
vain-glorious conclusions were drawn,
because Professor Treat knows the sit
uation, and knows that no forecast of
the ever-changing events .in Europe can
be made.
The weekly review should be read
bv evcrv student in college.
