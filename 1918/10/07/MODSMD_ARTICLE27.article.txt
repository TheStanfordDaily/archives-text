'1 recti. i> r> »rict«>r o ft lie (ampus cigar
-tort from \. E J . Batchelder, ex-'IN,
with Base Hospital 30 near the front
!;nes. Batchelder was a member of
■•igma Chi while in college,
i allowing is tlit- letter:
"What the (knee are you people try
ing to do in the states: I hear about
artl:i|uakes. I. W. VV. troubles, sub
marines, New York in darkness, etc
How much is true and how much
false? I'd like to get back to tlie-
States for about ten minutes and find
nit what's doing and how the war is
going on. Just long enough to buy a
white man's paper, and then back to
I r rance in peace and tranquility.
"We are sure breaking all records in
getting set up at present. We landed
!iere about a month ago with several
dirt\ hotels at our disposal, and today
you would hardly know the interior ot
any of them. They are actually hos
pitals. Now for a few patients to ex
ert our energy on, and everything will
lie O. K.. except, as i said, the news
supply, which is father meager at the
best.
"Don't let anyone tell you how they
abuse the American troops over here,
for to date, 1 think, we have had a
fair sample of life off the immediate
front, and I find it line. In fact, about
150 per cent better than it was repre
sented to me in the states. Of course
sugar is scarce, but what's the differ
ence. We have plenty of plain and good
food, a good bed and plenty of work
to keep us in tune. Have all the to
iacco we can possibly use. Uncle Sam
sr.' s us four sucks of 'Durham' and
a plug of chewing tobacco every two
weeks, which is plenty for any normal
nioker.
"Sincerely.
"At. Hatchki.dkk."
