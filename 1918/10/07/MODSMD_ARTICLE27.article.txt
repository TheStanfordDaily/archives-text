# LETTERS FROM FRANCE
## 
### 
Evidence of the iiwimnit \m<r
ican troops in France are receiving and
the good work they are doing is con-
tained in a letter received by W. B.
Green, proprietor of the Campus cigar
store from A. P. Batchelder, ex-'18,
with Base Hospital 30 near the front
lines. Batchelder was a member of
Sigma Chi while in college,
Following is the letter:
"What the (knee are you people try
ing to do in the states? I hear about
artl:i|uakes. I. W. VV. troubles, sub
marines, New York in darkness, etc.
How much is true and how much
false? I'd like to get back to the
States for about ten minutes and find
out what's doing and how the war is
going on. Just long enough to buy a
white man's paper, and then back to
France in peace and tranquility.
"We are sure breaking all records in
getting set up at present. We landed
here about a month ago with several
dirty hotels at our disposal, and today
you would hardly know the interior of
any of them. They are actually hos
pitals. Now for a few patients to ex
ert our energy on, and everything will
be O. K., except, as I said, the news
supply, which is rather meager at the
best.
"Don't let anyone tell you how they
abuse the American troops over here,
for to date, I think, we have had a
fair sample of life off the immediate
front, and I find it fine. In fact, about
150 per cent better than it was repre
sented to me in the states. Of course
sugar is scarce, but what's the differ
ence. We have plenty of plain and good
food, a good bed and plenty of work
to keep us in tune. Have all the to
bacco we can possibly use. Uncle Sam
issues us four sacks of 'Durham' and
a plug of chewing tobacco every two
weeks, which is plenty for any normal
smoker.
"Sincerely,
"Al Batchelder."
