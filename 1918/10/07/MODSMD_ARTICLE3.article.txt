# "NO WEAKENING" IS MESSAGE
## "Enemy Still Unbeaten " says Dr. Wilbur 
### 
Matriculation services held yesterday
in Memorial Church were attended by
practically all of the new students and
by a great many old students in the
University. The S. A. T. (J. marched
in a body to the church, making matric
ulation Sunday all the more impres
sive for this new feature.
President Wilbur, Miss Harriet Brad
ford, dean of women, J. F. McDowell,
dean of men. Captain Parker of the
S. A. T. C., and the Rev. D. C. Gard
ner. chaplain, were the speakers at the
services. All gave messages addressed
to the new students particularly.
In his speech, which is here given,
Dr. Wilbur touched upon the new de
velopment of the war, Germany's peace
propositions, in its relation to the uni
versities and colleges of the country:
"This is Liberty Sunday, set aside by
our government to bring to the atten
tion of all of its citizens the solemn
national duty of supporting the men
we have iti France by purchasing Lib
erty bonds. Our heart, our thoughts
are iti France, today's news of peace
again iill the ears of the world. It is
a new gas wave of peace intended to
befuddle our minds and numb our
striking power, or have the leaders in
Germany wiped away the fog of arro
gance and deceit, and looked clearly
into the future with its certainty of
ultimate defeat. Time alone will an

swcr. We can do no more crftninal
thing against civilization tlian to relax
now, to diminish by one particle our
efforts to put the war through. We
have only a certain number of hours
and days before us to strike the blow
that may be needed to bring victory.
To weaken now, to hesitate even for a
moment, now that we are in full stride,
would be a fatal mistake.
• Beaten men and beaten nations seek
ever for breathing spaces in order to
delay fate or in the hope of unexpect
ed succor. Now is our time to be firm
and to save the future. The sense of
injustice is one of the most, if not the
most, soul stirring and motivating emo
tion known to man. We must seek in
this war to remove that rankling can
cer from as many nations as possible.
It cannot be done unless Germany
stands before the world humble for her
sins—repenant and ready to make such
reparation as she can. No power can
bring back those who occupy those
grouped graves in the peaceful towns
of Belgium, can animate again the mil
lions of bleaching bones of the Arme
nian desert, or the beautiful valleys of
Serbia, but we can fill those countries
again with men. women and children
who can say "Justice has prevailed,
God rules" -and unless we do so those
boys symbolized by yonder golden stars
will have fought their fight for naught.

now, to diminish by one particle our
efforts to put the war through. We

• Beaten men and beaten nations seek
ever for breathing spaces in order to
delay fate or in the hope of unexpect

and to save the future. The sense of
injustice is one of the most, if not the
most, soul stirring and motivating emo

It cannot be done unless Germany
stands before the world humble for her
sins—repenant and ready to make such
reparation as she can. No power can
bring back those who occupy those
grouped graves in the peaceful towns
of Belgium, can animate again the mil
lions of bleaching bones of the Arme

Serbia, but we can fill those countries
again with men. women and children

Matriculation services held yesterday
in Memorial Church were attended by
practically all of the new students and
by a great many old students in the
University. The S. A. T. (J. marched
in a body to the church, making matric
ulation Sunday all the more impres
sive for this new feature.
President Wilbur, Miss Harriet Brad
ford, dean of women, J. F. McDowell,
dean of men. Captain Parker of the
S. A. T. C., and the Rev. D. C. Gard
ner. chaplain, were the speakers at the
services. All gave messages addressed
to the new students particularly.
In his speech, which is here given,
Dr. Wilbur touched upon the new de
velopment of the war, Germany's peace
propositions, in its relation to the uni
versities and colleges of the country:
"This is Liberty Sunday, set aside by
our government to bring to the atten
tion of all of its citizens the solemn
national duty of supporting the men
we have iti France by purchasing Lib
erty bonds. Our heart, our thoughts
are iti France, today's news of peace
again iill the ears of the world. It is
a new gas wave of peace intended to
befuddle our minds and numb our
striking power, or have the leaders in
Germany wiped away the fog of arro
gance and deceit, and looked clearly
into the future with its certainty of
ultimate defeat. Time alone will an
