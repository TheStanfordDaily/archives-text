# Wilbur's Reception Enjoyed
## 
### 
A very delightful evening was spent
by those who attended the president's
reception to the students last Saturday
evening. Upon entering the house the
guests were welcomed by Dr. Wilbur,
his wife, and his daughter Jessica. Miss
Harriett Bradford, dean of women, the
Rev. D. Charles Gardner, and Professor
C. D. Marx. Several upperclassmen
also assisted in receiving the new stu
dents. J. F. McDowell played an in
strumental part in extending the spirit
of hospitality which was felt by even
one present.
The reception was the first one to be
given to the students from the presi
dent's new home, which added a feature
of novelty to the evening. The beauty
and exquisite taste of the furnishings
and the attractive arrangement of the

house were a pleasure to the guests, who
took much enjoyment in seeing the vari
ous reception rooms.
The last of the evening was spent in
dancing and a social good time, in
which the old students had an oppor
tunity to meet the new students. A re
freshing court offered an enjoyable spot
to rest between dances and in which to
stroll for a diversion.
Sugarless punch, made of a mixture
of applecider, strawberry juice, logan
berry juice, and Shasta water, sweet
ened with syrup, was served.
The presence of several officers and
the fact that a large majority of the men
were in military or naval costume added
a war touch to the scene, and the in
formal dress of the women also remind
ed one of the solemnity of the national I
situation.
