## 
### 
I lie following resolution was adopted'
by the Board of Trustees of Stanford!
I'niversity on September 27, 191K:
"When the news was flashed from the
southern hemisphere that Thomas Wel
ton Stanford was dead, the Trustees of
the Leland Stanford Junior University
realized with profound regret that the
last person of the name connected with
tlie University had passed away. This
youngest of the Stanford brothers, as
sociated in business in Sacramento with
Leland Stanford in the early years of,
their lives, journeyed to Australia in j
1860. From that continent he never re-1
turned, but the affection between the!
brothers was not lessened by time or by
distance. With pride Thomas Welton
Stanford watched the founding and
growth of the great institution of learn
ing established by his brother at Palo
Alto, California. His interest in it was
evidenced in many ways. Appointed
one of the original Board of Trustees
for the University, he kept informed as
to its activities and continued as such
until his death. When Leland Stanford,
by his will, directed that $300,000 be
given to this absent and younger broth
er, the latter, with equal generosity and
in complete sympathy with the aims of
the former for the education of young
men and young women, gave back to
Stanford University that money to be
used for the building of a library. Many
times since then has that same spirit to
ward the University been manifested,
jAn Art Museum and Department of
i Psych'cnl Research are the products of
his thoughtfulness. In numerous ways,
through the years, has this constant de
votion to his brother's work been
shown. Never has he forgotten it.
Never has he ceased to keep close in
touch with it. ever expressing the great
est delight in the development of that
j seat of learning. The Trustees of Le-
I land Stanford Junior University recog
| nize in Thomas Welton Stanford a
| character rare among men, one of ex
| trenie kindliness and an integrity un
usually punctilious. In his death they
mourn the severance of a relation which
it is impossible to replace, and feel a
sincere loss which it is the purpose of
this memorial to record."
