# BULLETIN FROM WAR DEPARTMENT ANSWERS QUERIES
## GIVEN OUT BY WILBUR S.A.T.C. Men to Remain at College According to Age Groups 
### 
In reply to a number Of queries con
cerning the S. A. T. C., and in regard
to the selection of courses for those
seeking to enter the various forms of
service. President Wilbur has given out
the following bulletin received by him
from the War Department:
"The fundamental principle upon
which this corps (the S. A. T. C.) is
established, is that it will hasten the
mobilization and training of our armies,
with particular reference to the selection
and training of officers and non-commis
sioned officer material.
"Since this training is designed to
meet the specific needs of the war pro
gram in the shortest possible time, its
value cannot be appraised by ordinary
academic standards of college admission
or the requirements for academic de
grees. Colleges may give credit for this
work toward their degres if they so de
sire.
"The committee is authorized to form
ulate the program for the S. A. T. C. on
the basis of retaining those who are 20
years old for one quarter, those of the
19-year age group for two quarters, and
the 18-year group for three quarters.
This is authorized on the theory of
transferring the increments of the S. A.
T. C. to camps and cantonments at about
the same average time that the mass of
registrants of the corresponding age.
groups are being reached in the selective
draft.
"The men of the S. A. T. C. are sol
diers of the United States, subject to
orders, and it is impossible to guarantee
to any man that he will remain for the
stated time, since military necessities
may require earlier calls.
"During the first quarters, members
of the 20-year age group will be assigned
in accordance with their demonstrated
qualifications, either to central officers'
training school ;, or to non-commissioned
officers' training schools, or to Section
B of the S. A. T. C., or to cantonments
as privates. A relatively small number
who have demonstrated their peculiar
fitness for further training either in
preparation for officers' training camps
or for higher technical work, may be as
signed to particular schools for further
training for a limited time.
"Any man who does not demonstrate
his ability after a fair trial, to profit by
the S. A. T. C. training will be trans
ferred to a camp or cantonment to con
tinue his training as a private.
"In assigning the soldiers of the S. A.
'1. C. to various branches of the service
the guiding principle will be to place
each man where he can render his maxi
mum service consistent with the needs
of the army at the time of his transfer.
Generally speaking, the soldier is likely
to give the best account of himself in
the line in which lie is most interested.
I herefore, the preference of registrants
who are voluntarily inducted into the
S. A. T. C. as to the branch of the serv
ice they ultimately enter will be given
consideration except in case military
needs require a different course.
"The student soldier is at liberty to
select the program of studies which is
suggested as preparation for the particu
lar branch of the service lie desires to
enter. I his choice of a program of
studies does not. however, constitute the
determination of the branch of the serv
ice to which he may l>e transferred. The
direction of his transfer will be deter
mined by the fitness of the soldier for
service and the needs of thtf army at the
time of his transfer.
