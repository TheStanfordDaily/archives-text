# BULLETIN FROM WAR DEPARTMENT ANSWERS QUERIES
## GIVEN OUT BY WILBUR S.A.T.C. Men to Remain at College According to Age Groups 
### 
In reply to a number Of queries con
cerning the S. A. T. C., and in regard
to the selection of courses for those
seeking to enter the various forms of
service. President Wilbur has given out
the following bulletin received by him
from the War Department:
"The fundamental principle upon
which this corps (the S. A. T. C.) is
established, is that it will hasten the
mobilization and training of our armies,
with particular reference to the selection
and training of officers and non-commis
sioned officer material.
"Since this training is designed to
meet the specific needs of the war pro
gram in the shortest possible time, its
value cannot be appraised by ordinary
academic standards of college admission
or the requirements for academic de
grees. Colleges may give credit for this
work toward their degres if they so de
sire.
"The committee is authorized to form
ulate the program for the S. A. T. C. on
the basis of retaining those who are 20
years old for one quarter, those of the
19-year age group for two quarters, and
the 18-year group for three quarters.
This is authorized on the theory of
transferring the increments of the S. A.
T. C. to camps and cantonments at about
the same average time that the mass of
registrants of the corresponding age.
