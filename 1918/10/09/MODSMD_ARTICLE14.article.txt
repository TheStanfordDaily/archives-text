# MEN WANTED
## 
### 
There never was a time when men
with any sort of writing ability were
more needed on the reportorial staff of
the Daily I'ai.o Alto than at the pres
ent. With the great majority of the
male members of the staff enrolled in
the S. A. T. C., the work formerly done
by a dozen now rests on the shoulders
of two or three. And although the value
of tlu- work of the women of the staff
cannot be overestimated, there are some
phases of college life which cannot well
he covered by women, particularly this
year, when the life of the University is
centered in things military.
While the number of men able to par
ticipate in journalism this year is greatly
reduced, there should be still enough to
carry on the necessary work. Scores of
men are not in uniform and will not be;
other scores, especially in the eighteen
year-old .group, will probably be able to
arrange some time to devote to journal
ism.
Lack of previous experience should be
no bar to trying out for the college daily,
as many of the best writers arc devel
oped after they get to college. The
Daily Palo Alto is at present the only
link between the Stanford of war and
the Stanford of peace, and is printed by
the express' wish of the military and
University authorities. Those who cannot
get into the S. A. T. C. may do the next
best thing, and se k to keep Stanford
traditions alive through the only avenue
remainingâ€”the Daily Palo Amu
Those who are in the S. A. T. C. and
have not yet completely arranged their
courses will find a few hours' work on
the only remaining college activity inter
esting and instructive, as well as pro
ductive of University credit, if such a
program can he arranged.
Nothing in the foregoing should be
taken to discourage Stanford women
with journalistic ambitions from trying
out for the reportorial staff of the Daily
Palo Alto. But the scarcity of men
writers is the chief and immediate fact
to he remedied.
