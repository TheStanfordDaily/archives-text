# STANFORD AMBULANCE MEN NOW NEAR PIAVE
## 
### 
Six of the men who left Stanford last
spring with the ambulance unit for Italy
are stationed on the lower Piave at
present, according to a letter received
here today from Herbert Darling, '21,
who was with the unit when it left here.
Darling and Harley Harris, '21, have
been separated from the rest of the
Stanford men and have been stationed
in the mountain region of Italy.
Darling expects that the Red Cross
will soon be taken over by the army,
and in such an event he expects to enlist
in the French artHlery training school at
Fontainbleau. The enlistment of the
Stanford men with the unit was to last
for six months only, but it is doubtful
if any of the men will return to this
country until after the war.
