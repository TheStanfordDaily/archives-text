# ILLUSTRATED REVIEW TO APPEAR FRIDAY
## 
### 
Names of Stanford men and women
in the service in a complete list will be
one of t lie important features of the first
issue of the Stanford Illustrated Rcviciv
to appear on the campus Friday morn
ing. During the summer a compilation
of the names of all of Stanford's war
servers has been completed, and for the
first time it will appear in print.
That Stanford students may acquire
knowledge of their friends, every one is
urged to putin his subscription early to
the Illustrated Rcricu'. Only a limited
number of copies will be available for
the information which so many wish to
obtain.
While a douple page of illustrations
formerly furnished the pictorial part of
the magazine, this year's Rei'iciv is to
have each article illustrated, besides two
pages of cuts alone. The latter in the
October issue will be pictures of the
men whose names have been placed upon
Stanford's honor roll.
