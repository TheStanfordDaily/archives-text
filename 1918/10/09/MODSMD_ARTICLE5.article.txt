# GERMAN AUTOCRACY EXPLAINED
## 
### 
To an audience that was regrettably
small, Professor Bernard Moses deliv
ered his scholarly lecture on "German
Autocracy and the Consent of the Gov
erned" last night in the Assembly hall.
Through a misunderstanding, the mem
bers of the S. A. T. C. were not allowed
to attend.
With deep insight into the psychologi
cal factors of the German people, Pro
fessor Moses outlined the historical
events which have'made this group of
people what it is today. lie showed how
the country was drawn into the auto
cratic system almost unawar, and so con
sistent has been the habit that they now
uphold this, following blindly the dic
tates of a higher authority even to the
extent of committing such atrocities as
are now held against them. "Today,"
said Professor Moses, "it is the old habit
manifesting itself under new conditions."
Due to the turbulent conditions of the
early years, the people left all govern

ment to the princes and higher authori
ties, living completely without initiative,
and developed a double character: hu
mility in a subordinate position, and
harsh power when in a position of su
periority. This acquired twofold char
acter makes subordination easy."
"The consent of the governed is not a
sure criterion of the character of the
government, nor does consent on the
part of the governed insure righteous
government. The brutal acts of the
German army has as much consent by
the people as any warfare."
The speaker further showed the effect
of the literature and of the industrial
and commercial developments which,
being an autgrowth of the autocratic
system, only serve to further its policy.
That the honor of justice and righteous
ness must be used as the final standard
of judging right and wrong, and the
coming generation must hold fast to the
waning public morality, was emphasized
strongly by the speaker.
