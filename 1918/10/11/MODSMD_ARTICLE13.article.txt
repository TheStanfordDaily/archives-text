.Many Man torn traditions, it is true,
must go by the board, due to the stress
of war conditions, but there are a few
customs of the "Farm" that there can
seem to be no adequate excuse for dis
regarding under any circumstances.
One of these is the tradition, old as the
Quad it>elf, that there lie no smoking
within its arches.
Stories are told of distinguished visit
ors who unwittingly disregarded this
custom and had cigars removed from
their mouths by students. At least the
custom lias been universally observed
by faculty and students alike. The feel
ing in regard to this rule is probably as
strong as any connected with the cam
pus.
The few cases of violation of the non
smoking precedent which have occurred j
this year are undoubtedly due to ignor
ance, and as soon as the custom is gen
erally known by the newcomers, it will
regain its sacredness.
