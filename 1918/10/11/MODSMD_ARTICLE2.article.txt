# Questionnaires on War Work to be Given to Women
## 
### 
Questionnaires to the women of Stan
ford are being drawn up by a committee
of three, composed of Miss Henrietta
Dickey, '20, member of the Y. W. C. A.;
Mrs. Mary Dolan, '19, of the War
Board, and Miss Eleanor Eppich, '19,
of the Women's Council.
These questionnaires have been made
up on a war basis and will be to the
women what the draft has been to the
men. The "500" will positively be
called on for war work, but before def
inite plans can be formed, the committee
wishes to know just what every fresh
man has done in high school, • and ex
actly what she considers herself capable
of doing here. Information as to the
general ability of every woman will be
revealed through thes£ papers.
The committee urgently requests each
and every Stanford woman to realize
the necessity and importance of filling
out these questionnaires intelligently.
They will be sent through the mail, and
until received the women should be
thinking of any little tiling that they can
do in the way of war work.
