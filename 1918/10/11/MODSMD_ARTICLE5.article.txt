# WEEKLY SUMMARY OF WAR
## 
### Professor P.J. Treat 
During the past week the interest of
the world lias centered in the German
peace note, the reply ol President Wil
son, and the glorious answer of the
Allied armies along the western front.
The German peace offensive was
caused primarily In the amazing effec
tiveness of the military program of the
United States. The presence of a mil
lion American troops in France, who
had demonstrated their lighting quality,
and whose presence gave Marshal Foch
the initiative along the whole front,
convinced the Central Powers of their
rapidly approaching destruction. In the
middle of September Baron Burian, the
Austro- Hungarian Foreign Minister,
sent out his peace note, which was an
swered by President Wilson, on Sep
tember 19, as follows: "The Govern
ment of the United States feels that
there is only one reply which it can
make to the suggestion of the Imperial
Austro-Hungarian Government. It has
repeatedly and with entire candor
stated the terms upon which the United
States would consider peace, and can
and will entertain no proposal for a
conference upon a matter concerning
which it has made its position and pur
pose so plain."
This was followed by the defeat of
Bulgaria between September 15 and 30.
when the armistice was signed, and by
the destruction of the Turkish armies
in Palestine.
On the 28th the resignation of Count
von Hertling, the Imperial German
Chancellor, was reported, as well as
that of the other members <>112 the Ger
man and Prussian ministries. And on
October 3 the appointment of Prince
Maximilian of 1 laden was announced.
Concerning this Prince there is a differ
ence of opinion. Former Ambassador
Gerard described him as "one of the
few high Germans who seem to be abb;
to think and believe like an ordinary
human being," and as one "opposed to
this insane idea of Pan-Germanism, of
world conquesj." But attention has
also been called to certain militaristic
and anti-parliamentary government
views which Prince Maximilian ex
pressed in December and January.
However, on the night of the 4th
-sth. the Chancellor sent his peace offer
to President Wilson through the Swiss
Government. Austria-Hungary did the
same, through Sweden, and it was re
ported that Turkey would act through
Spain.
The official translation of the Ger
man note follows: "The German Gov
ernment requests the President of the
United States of America to take steps
for the restoration of peace, to notify
all belligerents of this request, and to
invite them to delegate the plenipoten
tiaries for the purpose of taking up ne
gotiations. The German Government
accepts as a basis for the peace nego
tiations the program laid down by the
President of the United States in his
message to Congress of January 8. 191 S.
and in his subsequent pronouncements,
particularly in his address of Septem
ber 27. 1918. In order to avoid further
bloodshed, the German Government re-

quests to bring about the immediate
conclusion of a general armistice on
land, on water, and in the air."
This dispatch was delivered directly
to President Wilson on Sunday. His
reply, on Tuesday, was in the form of
an inquiry signed by Secretary Lan
sing. The questions were (1) "Does
the Imperial Chancellor mean that the
Imperial German Government accents
the terms laid down by the President
in his address to the Congress of the
United States on the 8th of January
last and in subsequent addresses, and
that its object in entering into discus
sions would be only to agree upon the
practical details of their application?"
(2) "Whether the Imperial Chancel
lor is speaking merely for the consti
tuted authorities of the empire who
have so far conducted the war?" The
President also stated that lie would
not propose an armistice to the asso
ciated governments so long as the
armies of the Central Powers were
upon their soil.
As one editor promptly wrou :
"Never before was 'merely* intended to
mean so much." The speeech of
Prince Maximilian in the Reichstag on
October 5. however, contained such
promises of democratic development in
Germany that it was eminently wise for
President Wilson to leave the way open
for discussion rather than to make a
positive rejection as in the case of the
Btirian note.
On the western front the enemy was
subjected to constant pressure, but the
major operation commenced on Tues
day, when the British third and fourth
armies and the French first army de
livered a powerful blow between Cam
brai and St. Quentin. Some American
divisions advanced with the British
fourth army. The operation was im
mediately successful, the Hindenburg
line was smashed completely through
on a wide front, and cavalry, whippet
tanks, and armored cars plowed
through the retreating Germans. Oil
Wednesday the first British army was
thrown in north of Cambrai, and that
day the city fell, the Canadians appar
enly being the lirst to enter. Yester
day the spear-head had advanced to Le
Cateau, twenty-two miles southeast ot
Cambrai, and only fifteen miles from
the great lateral railway which links
up the German front. The Americans
on the Mcuse are some eighteen miles
from this railway at that point. Dur
ing the week American and French
troops advanced on both sides of the
Meuse, and in thÂ« Champagne. French
and Italian troops renewed the offen
sive along the Chemin des Dames. But
no major operations took place in 1'lan
ders. A renewal of activity there may
be looked for.
In Macedonia, the Serbs and Frencl
have advanced to within fifteen miles
of Nish, in Serbia. While in Albania
the Italians, on a lifty-mile front, an
driving the Austrians before them. Ant
on Tuesday. Beirut, the chief seaport o
Syria was occupied by British India?
troops, after the fleet found it evacuate'
on Sundav .

message to Congress of January 8. 191 S.
and in his subsequent pronouncements,
particularly in his address of Septem
ber 27. 1918. In order to avoid further
bloodshed, the German Government re-

quests to bring about the immediate
conclusion of a general armistice on
land, on water, and in the air."
This dispatch was delivered directly
to President Wilson on Sunday. His
reply, on Tuesday, was in the form of
an inquiry signed by Secretary Lan
sing. The questions were (1) "Does
the Imperial Chancellor mean that the
Imperial German Government accents
the terms laid down by the President
in his address to the Congress of the
United States on the 8th of January
last and in subsequent addresses, and
that its object in entering into discus
sions would be only to agree upon the
practical details of their application?"
(2) "Whether the Imperial Chancel
lor is speaking merely for the consti
tuted authorities of the empire who
have so far conducted the war?" The
President also stated that lie would
not propose an armistice to the asso
ciated governments so long as the
armies of the Central Powers were
upon their soil.
As one editor promptly wrou :
"Never before was 'merely* intended to
mean so much." The speeech of
Prince Maximilian in the Reichstag on
October 5. however, contained such
promises of democratic development in
Germany that it was eminently wise for
President Wilson to leave the way open
for discussion rather than to make a
positive rejection as in the case of the
Btirian note.
On the western front the enemy was
subjected to constant pressure, but the
major operation commenced on Tues
day, when the British third and fourth
armies and the French first army de
livered a powerful blow between Cam
brai and St. Quentin. Some American
divisions advanced with the British
fourth army. The operation was im
mediately successful, the Hindenburg
line was smashed completely through
on a wide front, and cavalry, whippet
tanks, and armored cars plowed
through the retreating Germans. Oil
Wednesday the first British army was
thrown in north of Cambrai, and that
day the city fell, the Canadians appar
enly being the lirst to enter. Yester
day the spear-head had advanced to Le
Cateau, twenty-two miles southeast ot
Cambrai, and only fifteen miles from
the great lateral railway which links
up the German front. The Americans
on the Mcuse are some eighteen miles
from this railway at that point. Dur
ing the week American and French
troops advanced on both sides of the
Meuse, and in thÂ« Champagne. French
and Italian troops renewed the offen
sive along the Chemin des Dames. But
no major operations took place in 1'lan
ders. A renewal of activity there may
be looked for.
In Macedonia, the Serbs and Frencl
have advanced to within fifteen miles
of Nish, in Serbia. While in Albania
the Italians, on a lifty-mile front, an
driving the Austrians before them. Ant
on Tuesday. Beirut, the chief seaport o
Syria was occupied by British India?
troops, after the fleet found it evacuate'
on Sundav .
During the past week the interest of
the world lias centered in the German
peace note, the reply ol President Wil
son, and the glorious answer of the
Allied armies along the western front.
The German peace offensive was
caused primarily In the amazing effec
tiveness of the military program of the
United States. The presence of a mil
lion American troops in France, who
had demonstrated their lighting quality,
and whose presence gave Marshal Foch
the initiative along the whole front,
convinced the Central Powers of their
rapidly approaching destruction. In the
middle of September Baron Burian, the
Austro- Hungarian Foreign Minister,
sent out his peace note, which was an
swered by President Wilson, on Sep
tember 19, as follows: "The Govern
ment of the United States feels that
there is only one reply which it can
make to the suggestion of the Imperial
Austro-Hungarian Government. It has
repeatedly and with entire candor
stated the terms upon which the United
States would consider peace, and can
and will entertain no proposal for a
conference upon a matter concerning
which it has made its position and pur
pose so plain."
This was followed by the defeat of
Bulgaria between September 15 and 30.
when the armistice was signed, and by
the destruction of the Turkish armies
in Palestine.
On the 28th the resignation of Count
von Hertling, the Imperial German
Chancellor, was reported, as well as
that of the other members <>112 the Ger
man and Prussian ministries. And on
October 3 the appointment of Prince
Maximilian of 1 laden was announced.
Concerning this Prince there is a differ
ence of opinion. Former Ambassador
Gerard described him as "one of the
few high Germans who seem to be abb;
to think and believe like an ordinary
human being," and as one "opposed to
this insane idea of Pan-Germanism, of
world conquesj." But attention has
also been called to certain militaristic
and anti-parliamentary government
views which Prince Maximilian ex
pressed in December and January.
However, on the night of the 4th
-sth. the Chancellor sent his peace offer
to President Wilson through the Swiss
Government. Austria-Hungary did the
same, through Sweden, and it was re
ported that Turkey would act through
Spain.
The official translation of the Ger
man note follows: "The German Gov
ernment requests the President of the
United States of America to take steps

During the past week the interest of
the world lias centered in the German
peace note, the reply ol President Wil
son, and the glorious answer of the
Allied armies along the western front.
The German peace offensive was
caused primarily In the amazing effec
tiveness of the military program of the
United States. The presence of a mil
lion American troops in France, who
had demonstrated their lighting quality,
and whose presence gave Marshal Foch
the initiative along the whole front,
convinced the Central Powers of their
rapidly approaching destruction. In the
middle of September Baron Burian, the
Austro- Hungarian Foreign Minister,
sent out his peace note, which was an
swered by President Wilson, on Sep
tember 19, as follows: "The Govern
ment of the United States feels that
there is only one reply which it can
make to the suggestion of the Imperial
Austro-Hungarian Government. It has
repeatedly and with entire candor
stated the terms upon which the United
States would consider peace, and can
and will entertain no proposal for a
conference upon a matter concerning
which it has made its position and pur
pose so plain."
This was followed by the defeat of
Bulgaria between September 15 and 30.
when the armistice was signed, and by
the destruction of the Turkish armies
in Palestine.
On the 28th the resignation of Count
von Hertling, the Imperial German
Chancellor, was reported, as well as
that of the other members <>112 the Ger
man and Prussian ministries. And on
October 3 the appointment of Prince
Maximilian of 1 laden was announced.
Concerning this Prince there is a differ
ence of opinion. Former Ambassador
Gerard described him as "one of the
few high Germans who seem to be abb;
to think and believe like an ordinary
human being," and as one "opposed to
this insane idea of Pan-Germanism, of
world conquesj." But attention has
also been called to certain militaristic
and anti-parliamentary government
views which Prince Maximilian ex
pressed in December and January.
However, on the night of the 4th
-sth. the Chancellor sent his peace offer
to President Wilson through the Swiss
Government. Austria-Hungary did the
same, through Sweden, and it was re
ported that Turkey would act through
Spain.
The official translation of the Ger
man note follows: "The German Gov
ernment requests the President of the
United States of America to take steps
for the restoration of peace, to notify
all belligerents of this request, and to
invite them to delegate the plenipoten
tiaries for the purpose of taking up ne
gotiations. The German Government
accepts as a basis for the peace nego
tiations the program laid down by the
President of the United States in his
message to Congress of January 8. 191 S.
and in his subsequent pronouncements,
particularly in his address of Septem
ber 27. 1918. In order to avoid further
bloodshed, the German Government re-

quests to bring about the immediate
conclusion of a general armistice on
land, on water, and in the air."
This dispatch was delivered directly
to President Wilson on Sunday. His
reply, on Tuesday, was in the form of
an inquiry signed by Secretary Lan
sing. The questions were (1) "Does
the Imperial Chancellor mean that the
Imperial German Government accents
the terms laid down by the President
in his address to the Congress of the
United States on the 8th of January
last and in subsequent addresses, and
that its object in entering into discus
sions would be only to agree upon the
practical details of their application?"
(2) "Whether the Imperial Chancel
lor is speaking merely for the consti
tuted authorities of the empire who
have so far conducted the war?" The
President also stated that lie would
not propose an armistice to the asso
ciated governments so long as the
armies of the Central Powers were
upon their soil.
As one editor promptly wrou :
"Never before was 'merely* intended to
mean so much." The speeech of
Prince Maximilian in the Reichstag on
October 5. however, contained such
promises of democratic development in
Germany that it was eminently wise for
President Wilson to leave the way open
for discussion rather than to make a
positive rejection as in the case of the
Btirian note.
On the western front the enemy was
subjected to constant pressure, but the
major operation commenced on Tues
day, when the British third and fourth
armies and the French first army de
livered a powerful blow between Cam
brai and St. Quentin. Some American
divisions advanced with the British
fourth army. The operation was im
mediately successful, the Hindenburg
line was smashed completely through
on a wide front, and cavalry, whippet
tanks, and armored cars plowed
through the retreating Germans. Oil
Wednesday the first British army was
thrown in north of Cambrai, and that
day the city fell, the Canadians appar
enly being the lirst to enter. Yester
day the spear-head had advanced to Le
Cateau, twenty-two miles southeast ot
Cambrai, and only fifteen miles from
the great lateral railway which links
up the German front. The Americans
on the Mcuse are some eighteen miles
from this railway at that point. Dur
ing the week American and French
troops advanced on both sides of the
