patronage for our Bank in Palo Alto, which now bears your College name. ?
| It has never been the policy of the Stanford Bank of Palo Alto, nor I
iis predecessor, the Mayfield Bank, to make any charge whatever on Stan- -
ford Students' accounts, and we have rendered a valuable service as an "
[ accommodation to hundreds of students without expense to them, when I
other Banks were charging. We now operate the former Mayfield Bank -
as a Branch, our Head Office being situated at No. 161 University, Ave., =
* Palo Alto, where it will be convenient for you to use our Bank, and we 112
invite your valued account on the grounds of perfect safety, and an equal |

I individual students. ±

' guard that money can buy, and that careful state inspection and local con- Z
i servative management can give. §
A name which identifies you with your own great Stanford Uni- ?
~ versity—each check flying your college pennant—thus carrying its colors I
all over this broad land, and directing attention to our College, our City, §
| and even our great State of California. "
= The most modern statement system of keeping your accounts in the 1
