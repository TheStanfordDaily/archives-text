# KENNETH RUSSELL DIES IN HOSPITAL FROM INFLUENZA
## FEW OTHER CASES ARE NOW SERIOUS Two More Fraternity Houses Meet Increased Demand for Infirmaries 
### 
One death lias resulted from the epi
demic of Spanish influenza and sev
eral cases are reported as extremely
serious today. .
Kenneth Russel, an Encina lreshman
this year, and a member of the S. A.
1. C. died in the Peninsula hospital
yesterday. His family had been noti
ced of his illness and were here before
Mr. Russell passed away. 'So far the
cases have been generally light and this
lirst fatality comes as a shock to all
University students.
The increased demand for hospital
room has been rrtet by turning the Delta
lau Delta and the Phi Gamma Delta
houses into infirmaries. Approximately
betweeen 4(H) and 500 illnesses have
been taken care of since the epidemic
started, although no statistics are avail
able as yet. Ihe A. T. (). house has
at present forty-four cases and the
total number of cases today is re
ported as fifty-two. None of these are
seriously ill and the majority are con
valescent.
\ll patients are to be kept in the hos
pital for one week after their fever is
normal. The quarantine for members
of the S. A. T. C. will probably not be
lifted for some time until it is certain
that the disease is under control.
As a preventative in the spreading of
the trouble, concerted action has been
taken by J. E. McDowell, dean of men,
and Miss Harriet Bradford, dean of
women. Thermometers have been left
at the dormitories for the civilian stu
dents and for the women at Roble and
at the houses and orders for each one
to take his or hertemperature. If this
proves to be over 99.3 it is reported to
the deans and later developments are
closely watched.
Swimming classes have been stopped
for ten days and in place of the lessons
each woman is to take a long walk.
