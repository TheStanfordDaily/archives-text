# KNOCKERS VS. SOLDIERS
## 
### 
An epidemic more disastrous than
that of Spanish influenza is threatening
the S. A. T. C.
This is the spread of "crabbing.'
"grousing"—call it what you will, this
insidious spirit of complaint which, un
less nipped in the bud. will undermine
the healthy optimism with which previ
ous generations of Stanford students
have tackled krrobbv propositions.
To hear some of the S. A. T. C. "crab'
at the hour of reveille, their mess, their
barracks, the quarantine regulations, or
their classes, one could almost be con
vinced that the whole system of army
discipline, or. in fact, the bally war itself,
had been arranged for their personal
inconvenience.
Of course the work is hard. It has
to be to make soldiers out of men who
don't know one end of a gun from the
other. Of course the discipline is irk
some for men to whom discipline has
only meant freshman training.
Happily, the knocker is in the minor
ity—the larger percentage of men in the
S. A. T. C. have applied themselves to
the work laid out for them by the gov
ernment without any complaint. Among
these are many of the men who are at
tending Stanford for the first time, and
who are already' proving that they have
the makings of the real Stanford spirit.
Since it seems to be the "old" men
who are unwilling to appreciate the fact
their rah rah college days are over, one
can't help but wonder how they feel as
the gold stars are added to the service
flag out in front of the Quad for the men
who have made the supreme sacrifice!
without a murmur.
