# APPEAL OF WAR BOARD
## 
### 
In today's issue of the Daily Palo
Alto is the announcement of the new

headquarters of the War Board in the
old Zeta Psi house, and a request for
furniture with which to furnish the new
rooms for war workers. This is an ap
peal which should receive a ready re
sponse from the campus community.
The women of the University working
under the War Board have accomplished
noteworthy things in the line of relief
work through the Red Cross. The board
has been ' hampered by lack of con
veniences and is deserving of coopera
tion of the residents of the campus in
equipping the new headquarters.
