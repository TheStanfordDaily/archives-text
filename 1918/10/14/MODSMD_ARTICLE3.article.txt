# President Wilbur Explains New Rule
## Temperature to Be Taken of All Students and Faculty Members 
### 
The following communication con
cerning the new rule requiring all stu
dents to have their temperature read
daily has been received from President
Wilbur:
"Stanford University, Cal.,
"14 October, 1918.
"While there is a decline in the num
ber of new caess of influenza, in order
to promptly stamp out the further spread
of cases, all students are to have their
temperature taken once daily, and to be
isolated if they have fever. If those
who have fever are at once cared for,
' their chances for a short illness are in
creased and the number of those in
fected will be much fewer.
"Arrangements have been made for
taking the temperature of members of
the S. A. T. C. and enrolled students,
the men in dormitories and the women
in Roble and the sorority houses. All
other women students should report to
Roble Gymnasium. All others and
members of the faculty are to take their
temperature at their own homes, and
not meet their classes if their tempera
ture is over 99.3 degrees.
"Ray Lyman Wilbur,
"President."
