I "To the Members of> the Faculty:
j "Because of the unusual conditions
associated with the organization of the

influenza epidemic, certain necessary
modifications of the ordinary academic
requirements of class attendance, etc.,
are desirable.
"Since the mess hall was not com

amount of kitchen police which will not
be required later on. Special duties had

enza question.
"I would recommend, therefore, that

C. and others, who have been incapaci
| tated by the influenza, return to their
classes, concessions bcf made in the re
quirements, both as to regular attend
ance and amount of work done, so that
the majority of the students may have
an even start in their academic work.
