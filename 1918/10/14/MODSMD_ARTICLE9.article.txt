# Frosh Are Saved From Water Cure
## 
### 
1922 was saved from a watery grave
last Saturay night by the timely in
tervention of D.ean of Men J. E. Mc-
Dowell. Just as seventy-five burly
sophomores armed with thick, broad
paddles, were advancing up the Row,
Dean McDowell stepped into the
breach. Answering an inquiry as to
their destination, they announced that
they were <>n a special detail for fresh-1
man discipline.
Dean McDowell stemmed the onrusn
ing tide of sophs, and in a short,
sketchy speech, crammed full of vivid
pictures, persuaded the bloodthirsty
sophomores to hold back their fury.
Following this informal but forceful
talk, the sophomores begged Dean Mc-
Dowell to let them reason with the
frosh peaceably. This was consented
to. and the 1921 men proceeded to the
freshman dormitories.
The result of the sophomoric visit to
the frosh was the crop of familiar gray
dinks seen on the Quad this morning.
