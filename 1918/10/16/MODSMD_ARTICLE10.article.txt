# Sick Men Forced to Eat Chicken
## 
### 
If it is necessary to get the Spanish
influenza before you can get a good
chicken dinner in the vicinity of the
University, things have got to be
changed, or else let's get the influenza!
It seems that the other day at the
noon hour, the poor, sick, invalids at
the various fraternity houses on the
campus were compelled to eat a huge
chicken dinner. I
The meal, my friends, was the most
attractive phase of the treatment, as
the victims themselves will testily.
Listen to what they had and then take
whatever course seems best to you.
First, there was soup. You sneer at
that! The next course was chicken
with mashed potatoes and tried dump
lings. Salad followed and pudding was
served for dessert.
We feel sorry for the poor victims
of influenza.
