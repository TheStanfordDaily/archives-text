structor in economics at Stanford, who
is now engaged in relief work in France.

who are seriously wounded, and send
reports of these to Paris to be forward

"missing," and secure for them details
of death and burial; I search hospital
records for news of soldiers especially

able to write; distribute tobacco, tooth
brushes, candy, etc., ad infinitum, chat
with the boys, and make myself gener

tic of the French, too. Over here we
don't speak of any of the horrors of the
war. The newspapers have no records
of the terrible cruelties practiced by the
Huns —they are mote real to us in j
France than to you in America, and
some things lie too deep to be even
spoken of. There is no gaiety in Paris.
It is pitch dark at night, the streets are
practically void of all men in civilian
clothes, but brushing elbows with the
Red Cross workers, soldiers of all the
allies till the street*. You hear the
American twang—am* fiow dear to your
heart it is. You'd have to be over here
to know and turn to see the strong chin
and gcKid old American smile—brings
you back to the West, and makes you
reali/e how fnucli you reallv do love
your o\\ n people.
"I do wish you could all be with me to
see the faith these boys putin the Red
Cross! It'would repay you at home for
all you're doing to make our work over
here possible.
"I'll tell you a little instance. One of
our youngsters on arriving in France set
himself the difficult task of muling' his
brother, also in the army. This was a
pretty complicated undertaking—looking
for the proverbial needle in the haystack.!
However, after the greatest difficulties
and long waiting he managed to locate
the company in which hi:- brother had j
served. And then came the blow. Ij
had to report to him that his brother
had been severely wounded and was in J
some hospital—l did not know where —
in France. Had you seen it, you would
never have forgotten the look on that |
young boy's face when he heard my re-j
port. His eyes quietly met mine, and:
he said with perfect faith. ' The Red
Cross will find him.' And we did."
