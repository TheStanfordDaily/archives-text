News of the resignation of H. G.
Swendsen as editor of the Daily Palo
Alto, due to the impossibility of per
forming his duties both as an editor
and a member of the S. A. T. C., will
be read with regret by all students
familiar with Stanford conditions. It
is a loss which is felt not alone by the
staff of the Daily Palo Alto, but by
the University as a whole as well.
As a newspaper man. Swendsen is
without a peer in the present genera
tion of Stanford journalists. From the
fall of 1916. when he led a field of a
dozen freshman Daily reporters, till
the beginning of this year when he was
elected editor in the first part of his
junior year, his influence has been a
constantly growing factor in affairs of
the newspaper, and through it, of the
University.
Concerning the policy of the Daily
Palo Alto under the new editorial
management, we can do no better than
to reiterate Swendsen's declaration in
the first issue, that the primary pur
pose of this year's Daily Palo Alto
will be to serve, as far as possible, the
interests of the Stanford men in the
S. A. T. C. without neglecting the other
elements of the University. It might be
added that the paper will make an in
creasing effort to preserve to as great
an extent as may prove feasible under
present conditions, the old traditions
and customs of the campus, that when
the men return from the big tight they
may find a Stanford not wholly
strange and foreign to the college of
their memories.
