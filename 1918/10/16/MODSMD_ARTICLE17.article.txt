# MANAGING EDITOR
## 
### 
Coincident with the change in the
editorial management of the paper, the
Daily Palo Alto wishes to announce
the appointment of Miss Dorothy Dris
coll as managing editor, and to congrat
ulate itself upon that appointment.
Miss Driscoll's journalistic career at
Stanford has been deservedly meteoric.
On the staff of the paper less than a
year, she has in that time demonstrated
her ability as a writer, as an execu
tive, and as a leader in journalistic af
fairs.
Because of the disorganized condition
of the newspaper, Miss Driscoll will
have as managing editor duties much
heavier than usually pertaining to that
office. Any success the paper may gain
this year will be in a great measure
due to her efforts.
