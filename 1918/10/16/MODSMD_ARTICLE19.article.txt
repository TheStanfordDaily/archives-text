## 
### 
The movement begun in San Fran I
cisco for the placing of milk bottles in
the lobbies of all theaters and moving
picture houses to collect pennies for the;
Belgian babies has proved such a success
that it has spread all over the United]
•States and has been mad a national in-1
stitution by th Belgium Legation, which
has recently seen fit to place it in the
hands of the national Gamma Phi Beta'
sorority.
Under this new arrangement, the con-'
trol of the placing of these bottles and
of the collection of the money is to be,
entirely managed by the Gamma Phi
Beta members. The receptacles are to
be distributed throughout the United
States and will be placed in ten thou-1
sand motion picture lobbies alone. The
extent of the work will be greatly cn-j
larged in this way. as although the milk]
bottles are fairly well known iti the]
West, there are several Eastern states]
which have not yet introduced them.
The posters to be used in advertising
the idea and the labels to be stuck onto
the outside of the bottles have been
made uniform. They are a picture of a
Belgian baby holding n mush-bowl and
are printed in delf-blue and white.
