# PRES. WILBUR SPEAKS ON THE LIBERTY LOAN
## S.A.T.C. and Civilian Unit Hear Stirring Address for Fourth Loan 
### 
Before a large assembly, consisting
of three S. A. T. C. companies and the
civilian unit. President Wilbur last
night delivered a stirring speech for the
Liberty Loan campaign.
The president was introduced by
Professor Townley, who said that the
necessity for buying bonds should be
constantly before every American.
"It may be true." said the professor,
"that we are helping the government in
other ways—by handling a gun. and
giving our services, but let us not leave
the duty of bond-buying to the gray
heads and the bankers. The money
must be raised in order that our light
ing men may have a chance to do
themselves justice with proper equip
ment."
In closing. Professor Townley spoke
of several ways in which the bonds
might be bought.
President Wilbur was the next
speaker. He said that he had not come
to tell the men to buy bonds, but to
show them that the bonds were neces
sary to the successful termination of
the war.
"The Germans are still a most dan
gerous enemy," said Dr. Wilbur. "They
are much stronger than is commonly
supposed. We have seen that in pre
vious battles, although they have been
apparently defeated, they came on and
on. with miraculously large numbers.
Last spring, just as we thought there
could scarcely be any Germans left,
they planned the greatest offensive of
the war. from which the Allies narrow
ly escaped. But it must be realized that
no great armies have been defeated and
the greatest number of troops cap
tured entire has been one regiment. It
will take money to properly equip the
soldiers so that they can bring the war
to a successful end."
