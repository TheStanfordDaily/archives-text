### 
Bogari Rogers, ex-'l9, of junior op
era fame, and now a tirst lieutenant of
the Royal Flying Corps, brought down
his fourth Hun plane on September 15.
according to a letter received on the
campus last Saturday. Rogers brought
down his tirst plane during the early
part of the summer, but his record be
came an achievement during the month
of September when the had three
planes to his credit.
In speaking of the last light, Rogers
said: "Three of us set out to look for
two-seaters, as it was a perfect morn
ing--the tirst in several days—and some
were due over taking pictures. It took
a nhour to get up to twenty thousand
and 1 tootled up and down the line for
another hour and never saw a single
Hun.
"The afternoon show was the same
as the morning one, only different.
Same place and height, but much ex
citement. hirst we saw nothing, then
we saw several Bodies very high up
and well over. We weretoo far below
the Huns to be able to get above them
and weren't particularly anxious to let
them tumble down on us. They fooled
around and we fooled around and they
went north and then tried to get into
the sun, and finally when everything
began to look cold, six British machines
walked right in under these Huns and
the Huns tumbled down on them. We
waited until all of the Huns were be
low us and the fight was on. As soon
as it started other machines —all ours —

were on the bottom of the pile.
