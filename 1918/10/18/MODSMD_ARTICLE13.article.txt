# SPANISH INFLUENZA
## 
### 
The recent deaths of Stanford stu
dents here and elsewhere have brought
home to all of us as nothing else could
have done the seriousness of the epi
demic which is now happily on the
wane. Vet that all danger is not past
is evidenced by the numbers still in hos
pitals arid infirmaries. And the semi
quarantine precautions will probably
continue for some time to come. It is
vital that they be rigidly observed.
yuarantine rules of any kind are irk
some; but they are laid down by those
who' know their business and should
not be questioned. He who breaks
them takes the responsibility for expos
ing himself and others to danger of
possible death. It is too grave a matter
to try to "get by" with anything.
With nearly a third of the student
body absent from classes for a consid
erable length of time, University work
for the present quarter is necessarily
greatly hampered. It is too early to
say what arrangements will be made
for making it up. However, increased
efforts are made necessary for all that
tlie time lost should detract as little as
possible from the accomplishments of
the autumn quarter.
