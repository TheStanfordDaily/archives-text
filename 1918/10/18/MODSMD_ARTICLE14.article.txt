# ATTABOY, '22

### 
The spectacle of the familiar gray
dink and an occasional corncob pipe on
the campus is a cheering sight to the
few old Stanford men remaining on the
"Farm.' At first it seemed necessary
that all the beloved traditions, even to
the enforced vacuum bonnets of the
first-year men, must perish under the
heel of Mars, but the discovery that
there are nearly a hundred freshmen,
who, chiefly on account of tender years,
will be ignored by the army, changed
the situation. Upon these and upon
the few for whom flat feet or murmer
ing hearts have decreed cords or the
green caps, must rest for the most part
the maintenance of the outward forms
of the old Stanford life.
But in a larger sense the Stanford
spirit is in the keeping of the hundreds
in Encina and Sequoia. If it means
anything, it is a spirit which can be
destroyed neither by war nor peace, by
fire, hell, or the Kaiser. It is a spirit
which has made the sandstone arches
and red-tiled roofs beloved by men and
women from Belgium to China, in
Washington, Florida, and Siberia. It
is the spirit which has made the name
of Stanford better known than that of
any university in the West. And in
this its hour of trial it will not fail if

the present generation of Stanford men
are worthy successors to those who
have gone before them.
