# ART GALLERY HAS NEW SHOWING OF JAPANESE PRINTS
## 
### 
Beginning Sunday, October 27 an
exhibition of Japanese art will bo
opened to the public at the Thomas
Welton Stanford Art Gallery. This
collection is pronounced by many ex
perts to be the best of its kind in the
United States. It was bought by Mrs.
Stanford from the S. I. Keda estate,
which turned the profits from the sale
over to the Japanese government to
help carry on the Russo-Japanese war.
There are many articles of exquisite
beauty in the collection. A peach-blow
vase, valued at $12,000, is one of the
most perfect examples of the lost art,
according to Dr. Sayer of Oxford Uni
versity, in existence. The collection also
contains pieces of pottery that were
taken from the imperial palace during
the Chino-Japanese war.
While most of the collection was
brought to the University over twenty
years ago, it has been packed away in
the vaults since the earthquake, and
will be almost as new to the public.
Pedro J. Lemos, the director of the
museum, has been arranging with sev
eral eastern institutions for a collection
of Pennell lithographs to be exhibited
during January and February. These
will pertain to the work ef the food
and fuel conservation boards in
America.
