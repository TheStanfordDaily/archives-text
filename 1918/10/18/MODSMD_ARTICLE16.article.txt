# FRESHMAN WOMEN ARE TO AID IN WAR WORK
## 
### 
Plans* for a "Junior War Work
Council," composed of ten freshman
women to work in co-operation with
the regular council, were discussed last
Wednesday night at a meeting of all
the new Stanford women.
Miss Margaret Shedd, chairman of
the War Work Council, addressed the
new students and told them of the
work which is being done and in which
they may help.
Volunteers were called upon to help
in the cleansing campaign to be waged
in the old Zeta Psi house, which is to
be the headquarters of the board. Since
this was particularly a freshman duty,
all of the first-year women were in
vited to give as much of their time as
was possible on Thursday and Satur
day.
