# FRIDAY IS SET FOR OPENING OF NEW WAR BOARD ROOMS
## All War Work to Be Shown At New Headquarters in Old "Zete" House 
### 
Formal opening of the headquarters
of the Women's War Board will be held
next Friday night in the old Zeta Psi
house, which has been donated to this
organization for the duration of the war.
All departments will hold exhibitions of
their work, and the real work of the
War Board will begin in earnest then.
The public is invited to inspect the work
rooms on this occasion.
Hours during which the rooms will
be open for the quarter have been ar
ranged to give as much time as possible
for the women to work there. As a
result, the rooms will be open every
afternoon from 2:30 to 5:30, including
Saturdays and Sundays, and on Mon
day, Wednesday and Friday evenings
from 7:30 to 9:30. Each Friday night
will be a general get-together occasion
for the women, and the War Board an
ticipates an unusually large crowd then.
Work so far has been preliminary, but
with the opening of the new workrooms
the War Board will inaugurate an active
working campaign. All women are ex
pected to devote at least one hour each
week, and, as before, there will be com
petition between the houses.
The War Board as it now stands is
composed of the eleven member, with a
twelfth member soon to be added.
