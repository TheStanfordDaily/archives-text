# Errors Made In Bond Deposit Notifications
## 
### 
Mr. Wm. Cranston, head of the Lib
erty Loan drive in Palo Alto, wishes
to announce that subscribers who have
already paid a deposit on their bonds
and who have received notice to the
effect that no such deposit has been re
ceived should not take offense, as a
number of mistakes have occurred in
the distribution of these notices.
