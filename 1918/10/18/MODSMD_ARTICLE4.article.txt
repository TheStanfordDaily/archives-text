# Dutch Cleanser, Brooms and Freshmen Women in Attack
## 
### 
Brooms, dustcloths, soap, pails, and
ciins of Dutch cleanser were marched
ir formidable array by freshman women
yesterday afternoon about the region
of the postoffice, only to disappear into
that place known affectionately as "the
old Zeta house." Passersby called to
mind the old nursery room classic and
wondered if the new members of the
University were attempting to clean
the moon from the pinnacles of their
newly acquired knowledge.
That house of terror, mystery and
laughter, with its Tuillere gardens out
side, must have received a decided
shock when its spooky interior was in
vaded by water and the daring and in
trepid freshman women who will ven
ture in where even seniors fear to go.
However, (they have ended the one
campus mystery and the laughing house
with its unknown turns and strange
depths is no more. Instead, the Women's
War Board will open its headquarters
in the "ha'nted" place, for the Zeta Psi
house has had a "clarin-up spell."
