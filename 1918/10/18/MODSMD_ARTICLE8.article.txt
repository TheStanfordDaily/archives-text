# THE
						WAR-A WEEKLY REVIEW
## By Professor P.J. Treat 
### 
The second exchange of notes be
tween the German government and
President Wilson was the outstanding
event of the past week. The German
reply, forwarded on the 12th, was
signed by Von Solf, the State Secre
tary of the Foreign Office. A notable
feature was the omission throughout
of any reference to the "Imperial" gov
ernment. It stated (1) that the Ger
man government accepted the terms
laid down by President Wilson in his
various addresses, and that its object in
entering into discussions "would be only
to agree upon practical details of the
application of these terms.." (2) The
German and Austro- Hungarian gov
ernments declared themselves ready to
evacuate the occupied territories, for
the purpose of bringing about an armis
tice, and suggested the meting of a
mixed commission to make the neces
sarry arrangements. (3) "The present
German government, which has under
taken the responsibility for this step
toward peace has been formed by con
ference and in agreement Jwith the
great majority of the Reichstag. The
Chancellor, supported in all of his ac
tions by the will of this majority,
speaks in the name of the German
government and of the German people."
On the face of it, this seemed to be
a satisfactory reply to President Wil
son's queries of the Bt.h. But happily
Mr. Wilson was too well versed in the
history of Germany, and especially of
Prussia and of the Hohenzollern fam
ily to be caught off his guard, and his
reply on Monday, the 14th, served fur
ther to strip off all pretension and to
cut straight through to the root of the
matter.
In brief, he replied (1) that process
of evacuation and the conditions of an
armistice must be left to the judgment
and advice of the military advisers of
the United States and the allied gov
ernments, and no arrangement can be
accepted "which does not provide abso
lutely satisfactory safeguards and
guarantees of the maintenance of the
present military supremacy of the
United States an dthe allies in the
field." (2) No armistice will be con
sidered "so long as the armed forces
of Germany continue the illegal and in
humane practices which they still per
sist in"—the sinking of passenger ships
at sea and their small boats, the wanton
destruction in Flanders and France. (3)
Attention was called to one of the
terms of peace, now accepted by Get •
many, as laid down in his Mt. Vernon
address of July 4th: "The destruction
of every arbitrary power anywhere that
can separately, secretly and of its single
choice disturb the peace of the world."
"The power which has hitherto con
trolled the German nation," he now
pointed out, "is of the sort here de
scribed. It is within the choice of the
German nation to alter it. . . The
whole process of peace will, in his judg
ment, depend upon the definiteness and
the satisfactory character of the guar
antees which can be given in this fun
damental matter. It is indispensable
that the governments associated against
Germany should know beyond pcrad
venture with who mthey are dealing."
The President also stated that he
would make a separate reply to Aus
tria-Hungary. On the same day, the
Turkish note was delivered by the
Spanish minister. No reply has yet
been made to either of these notes.
Little information can be obtained of
conditions within the Central Powers.
Rumors have come from Holland and
Switzerland to the effect tha tthe Kaiser
has abdicated, that peace mobs have
been rioting in Berlin, tha tthe Social
ists have drawn up a plan of govern
ment to replace the autocratic one when

it is destroyed. Others state that or
ders have heen given to cease the wan
ton destruction of property during the
retreat, and to recall the submarine
boats. And in Austria-Hungary, it is
said, plans have been formulated for
turning the empire into a group of fed
eral states, to meet, in a measure, one
o fthe peace terms.
In the meantime, however, Marshal
Foch and his victorious troops have
continued their work of destroying the
military power of the Germans and
of freeing the conquered regions. Along
the whole front, from the Channel to
beyond the Meuse, the Germans have
been subjected to constant pressure, the
intensity shifting from place to place
as Foch manipulated the armies under
his command. On Sunday, General
Mangin and the fifth French army took
La Fere and Laon, key positions be
hind the old Hindenburg line. With
the former, the St. Gobain massif was
cleaned up, and with the latter fell the
Laon plateau. Since then the Germans
have been trying to withdraw their
troops from the pocket formed during
their delaped hold on these important
heights.
The major operation of the week,
however, took place in Flanders and
northern France. On Monday, the day
of Mr. Wilson's reply, the Belgian, Brit
ish and French armies renewed their
attack, under the general command of
King Albert. Their operations have
been most succesful, and a great salient
has been driven into the German lines.
On Tuesday the Belgians took the im
portant railway center of Roulers. On
Wednesday they extended their line to
the sea. The Germans were now re
treating so rapidly that only the French
cavalry could keep in touch with them.
On Thursday the Belgians took Os
tend, which was soon entered by King
Albert and Queen Elizabeth, and their
lines were advanced to about five miles
from Bruges. The British took Lille
and Douia, and to| their amazement
Lille was neither burned nor mined, as
Lens had been and other cities along
the line.
During the week the Germans have
offered stout resistence to the Ameri
cans and French on both sides of the
Meuse. Gains have been made in spite
of counter attacks, and the Americans
have pierced the Kriemhild line in sev
eral places. They have now taken the
last of the high lands north of Verdun
and have open country before them.
The second American field army has
been organized under Major-General
Bullard, while Major-General Liggett
has been given command of the first
army. The latest report states that
1,900,000 American troops have been
embarked.
Finally, the Serbs have continued to
drive the Germans and Austrians out
of their country. Nish, on the Vienna-
Constantinople railway, has been taken,
and at last reports they have advanced
thirty miles beyond. The French, op
erating with them, are cleaning up
other districts in Serbia and have in
vaded Montenegro, while the Italians
have occupied the important naval base
of Durazzo.
