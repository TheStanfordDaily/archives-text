# WILL THEY SURVIVE?

Stanford seems to witness an unique
experiment in college affairs; â€”a
Freshman Class without freshman dis
cipline. For military discipline, like the
rain, falls upon all alike, and at Encina
we are areated to the spectacle of
freshman corporals holding in the hol
lows of their hands the lives, fortunes,
and chances for kitchen police of those
at whose word they would, in time of
peace, tremble and obey. Aside from
the formal underclass hostilities and an
occasional bit of "razzing,' there will
probably, be little opportunity for fresh
man training for the first-yearlings in
uniform while the war lasts. Umlue
arrogance on the part of the 22s will
doubtless be properly resented, but the
usual courses in humility for freshmen,
which every class until the present has
taken, cannot well lie given.
It has long been contended that by
the time the average high-school boy
graduates and comes to an institution
like Stanford, a radical operation for
reduction in self-esteem is necessary, or
the patient becomes too bulky above the
ears to survive in the lower portions of
this earth's atmosphere; and it is upon
this theory that the incoming college
student is brought up, here as else
where. Development this year make it
practically impossible to carry out the
system to its full extent; hence the
future progress of the class of 1922
will be watched with particular interest
bv all connected with tiie University.
I'reshmen, it's up to you.
