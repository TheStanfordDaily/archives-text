# UNITED WAR WORKERS' CONFERENCE IS HELD
## Students' Campaign to Be Held Nov. 11-19 to Raise $27,000 on Campus 
### 
Lectures by representatives from the
seven organizations of the United War
Workers were heard in the Greek Thea
ter at the University of California Sat
urday afternoon from 2to 4. The meet
ing was held in the interest of the stu
dents' campaign in the United Wat
Workers' Drive for the raising of $170,-
500,(X)0 for welfare work at home and
overseas.
Representatives from all northern
California colleges were called together
to hear speakers from each of the seven
organizations who are to he financed
through this fund. They are the Y. W.
C. A., Y. M. C. A., Knights of Colum
bus, Jewish Welfare Board, War Camp
Community Association, American Li
brary Association, and the Salvation
Army. It has been thought advisable to
combine the elTorts of these organiza
tions, who are working together in per
fect cooperation on the other side and
over here, for one big drive for enough
money to cover the budget and keep the
work going for 1919. The campaign
will take place November 11th to 19th,
and the canvassing on this campus will
take place at that time. The students of
America will be expected to raise their
share of the money.
Dr. Wheeler, who has just returned
from France, represented the Salvation
Army and gave a remarkable descrip
tion of the conditions existing in France
today, and impressed upon all delegates
present that so long as our boys sacri
fice their lives for the safety of the
world, it is America's duty to give freely
of her resources. It is the Salvation
Army that is the one organization to
be allowed in the first-line trenches, and
the women carry doughnuts and hot cof
fee to the men on duty there. Dr.
Wheeler stated that the women made
and served oyer 6,000 doughnuts in one
hut in a single day. The men in France
have made the resolution "to take the
toot out of Teuton, the germ out of
Germany, the hell out of Wilhelm, and
the cuss out of Potsdam."
Miss Jane Scott, executive of the Y.
W. C. A. of Southern California, speak
ing of the work of her organization,
made the statement that there will be
7,000,000 women in this country engaged
in war industry when this draft is com
pleted, and it is the work of the Y. W.
C. A. that makes life worth living for
these partiotic women over here, as it
is doing for the women in England at
present. She also mentioned the other
phases of the Y. W. C. A. workâ€”such
as the hostess houses and camp com
munity service.
Mr. Brier, representing the American
Library Association, gave three good
reasons for supporting this library
work: 1. It is a government institu
tion ; 2. Technical knowledge gained
through books is required by the men
in the service and the organization must
supply it; 3. Trained men who will re
turn to resume their work is the result.
He said that it was found that the men
wanted only about 30 per cent of their
reading in fiction, the rest in non-fic
tion. Camp libraries are established in
the Y. M. C. A. huts and work in har
mony with the other six societies.
Dr. Stidger of the Methodist church
in San Jose, who has just returned from
France, spoke for the Y. M. C. A. and
told many interesting and pathetic inci
dents which showed a few things that
the Y. M. C. A. is doing for the men
overseas. He gave what he called sil
houettes of the spirit of our boys and
of the French.
The Jewish Welfare Board sent one
representative to pledge its support to
the campaign, and a telegram was read
from the Knights of Columbus to the
same effect.
The work of the War Camp Commun-j
ity Service consists chiefly of work in;
America, and is doing much to keep upj
tlie morale of training camps and the
small towns which have been boomed
by the creation of the large soldier com-1
munities. Bad conditions which havei
arisen from this situation have been
greatly relieved by the aid of the War
Camp Community Service.
The University of California, College
of Pacific, Santa Clara, San Francisco-
Theological Seminary, and Stanford
sent delegates to the meeting. Stanford
was represented by the' following
women: Mrs. Margaret McGee, Y. W.
C. A. secretary; Irene Bonnett, '19;
Ruth Searcy, '20; Ruth Elsinger, '21;
Theltna Carlisle, '20; Pauline Wheeler,
'20; Jessie Carter, '19; Mildred Roome,
'19, and Eleanor Allen, '20. Prof. R. L.
Green represented the men.
