# DEBATE TRYOUTEES COMPETE THURSDAY AT LITTLE THEATER
## 
### 
The subject for the tryout for the
debate against the University uf Cali
fornia is: "Resolved, that the United
States government should retain per
manently the wire communications of
the nation." The tryout will be held
Thursday at 3 p.m. in Room 100. It
will take the form of an extemporane
ous debate between the candidates, who
are asked to prepare eight-minute
speeches on either side of the question.
The rebuttals will be of two or three
minutes. Debating Coach McClintock
has received the names of eight stu
dents who plan to try out and all oth
ers who consider doing so are request
ed to leave their names with him. Mc-
Clintock desires that as many as pos
sible appear for the tryout, as the work
ing squad, from which the team will be
chosen later, is to be larger than usual
this year. The debate will probably be
given in Polk Street Hall, Municipal
Auditorium of San Francisco.
Two other debates have been sched
uled so far for the college year, one
with the University of Southern Cali
fornia for which the tryout will be held
next quarter, and the Joffre, which will
take place in the spring.
