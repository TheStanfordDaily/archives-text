# REPORT OF TESTING AEROPLANE PARTS TO BE PUBLISHED
## 
### 
Professor E. P. Lesley of the Me
chanical Engineering department today
announced that the report on the forty
models of airplane propellers tested this
summer in the aero-dynamics labora
tory would be published soon in the
fourth annual report of the National
Advisory Committee for Aeronautics.
Fifteen thousand dollars was ap
propriated last year by the Board of
Trustees for the building and equip
ping of a new aero-dynamics labora
tory. Tests of aeroplane propellers al
ready performed by Professors Lesley
and Durand proved to be of such value
that the board took this action. A new
aero-dynamics laboratory located back
of the Men's Union was immediately
started.
The equipment of this laboratory at
present consists of an Eiffel type wind
tunnel. seven and one-half feet in di
ameter at the throat, for testing model
aeroplane propellers. With this appara
tus it is expected that wind velocities
of 80 ni. p. h. will be realized.
This laboi'atory is to be equipped with
other apparatus for testing air-foil sec
tions, aeroplane bodies, and general
aero-dynamic research.
