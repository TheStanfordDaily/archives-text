# WAR BOARD PLANS ORANIZATION FOR ALL NEW WOMEN
## COMMITTEE OF TEN WILL BE ELECTED Special Work Is Reserved For Freshmenâ€”Opening Plans Completed 
### 
Plans for organization of new
women for active war work have been
formulated by the Women's War Board.
This is to be called the War Board
Junior, and composed entirely of new
women but supervised by the War
Board Senior, as it is proposed to call
the main board, which has already been
doing definite work on the campus.
This second board will be made up of
ten members chosen from a group of
twenty-five proposed by the War Board
Each one of the ten will have a commit
tee of twenty whom she will keep in
touch with the actions of the War
Board. She will also be held responsi
ble by this board for their attendance at
Red Cross rooms.
Through this War Board Junior the
Senior Board hopes to secure special
material for officers in following years,
since this second board will train the
members in the work to be done on the
campus.
F.cshn- 4i women have been given
special forms of work. This includes
the clcrical work of the War Board, the
care of headquarters, and assistance in
campaigns: Knitting has been reserved
for Freshman women also, because of
the limited amount of wool. Knitting
clubs are to be formed, and the porch
on the second floor of the Zeta Psi
House is to be fitted up for these.
The new women have proven their
interest and ability in doing whatever
work comes up, by the excellent manner
in which ihey cleaned the new head
quarters rooms. Thursday and Satur
day these women cleaned and scrubbed (
and arranged furniture in order to pre
pare the building for the opening next
Friday night.
