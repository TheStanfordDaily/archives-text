## 
### 
" 1»i 1 ly' Hill died last night.
To the present students at Stanford
"Hilly" Hill was a familiar figure,—a
big jovial workman who was employed
on the grounds of the University.
Hut to the Irwins and Herbert Hoo
ver and t harlic Field the passing of
"BiNy" Mill will be the loss of sym
pathetic Iriend and conspirator from
the days when that group of famous
Stanford men kept the campus com
munity in suspense with their pranks.
"Billy" Mill was watchman at Encina
for years. Put he came into the local
limelight most prominently when a
group of well known residents at En
cina conceived the brilliant plan of
electing "Hilly" cliief of police of Palo
Alto, theieby controlling the strong
arm of the law. All went well until a
number of facetious students robbed
"Billy* of his uniform, star and club
and adorned one of their own number
with the symbols of authority. What
followed is lost in annals of the past,
but "Billy" won everlasting fame in bis
brief career as chief of police.
Death came'suddenly and peacefully
to "Billy" Hill. His passing will be re
gretted by Stanford students of many
generations to • whom he has been a
friend and cohnselor.
