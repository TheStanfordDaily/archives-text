## 1922 Paints Numerals in Bold Relief on Roof of New Edifice 
### 
Several promising members of the
class of 1922 were given a warm and
spirited reception last Saturday night
by the sophomore class. The occasion
for this early morning levee on the
football field was the fact that the
figures 22 had been painted in a child
ish scrawl on the white roof of the
new library.
On the discovery of this outrage sev
eral of the most flagrant examples of
Kreshmanic impotence were seized and
lock-stepped past the icy depths of the
Encina pool, where three freshmen
dropped in their tracks out of pure
fright, to the football field. Here the
frosh tasted the bitter sting of the
paddle amid the merciless jeer of the
sophomores.
Underclass hostilities were in abey
ance during Sunday morning and after
noon, but last evening some freshman
thoughtlessly put up another 22 in the
place of the former disfiguration which
has just been erased by dint of fresh
man effort. This 22 still stands and
the sophomore class is seriously consid
ering awarding to some deserving frosh
the honor of removing it.
The tra litinna! poster fight will not
be held this year, but the tie-up will be
held on the first available Wednesday
following the quarantine. In the mean
time the needs of the freshman class
in regards to discipline will be admin
istered to by the class of 1921.
This afternoon reports are that mys
terious developments are brewing be
tween the this-years and the last-vears.
