The prospect of the resumption of
football, both American and Rugby,
with California is the best news heard
at Stanford for years. It is true that
the men will not represent Stanford as
a University, but as a unit of the S..A.
T. C., and presumably no "S"s will be
awarded, but in every real sense it will
be a conflict of the Cardinal and l>lue
and Gold. And the lug thing is that we
are again in touch with our only pos
sible natural rival. What various ath
letic commissions have been unable to
accomplish in six years, the army does
overnight. And it is unthinkable that
relations once resumed should be
broken again at the close of the war.
Aside from the purely military aspect
of athletics, yesterday's announcement
insures the fact that Stanford is to be
something more than a mere military
camp this year. If there lias been any
doubt as to how the new men in the
S. A. T. C. will regard their college
after the war, it is now dissipated.
As to the tentative schedule, no fault
can be found with it. Partizans of
American and Rugby are equally satis
fied, and the University's biggest sea
son in athletics seems assured. VVhai
the attitude of the powers that lie will
be towards the American game after
the war remains problematical. With
out going into the merits of the two
games, experience has shown that a
football schedule which provides only
one game a season with a college of
any sort has its drawbacks.
Stanford and California are together
again in football. May they never part.
