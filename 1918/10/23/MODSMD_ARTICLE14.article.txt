# OUT OF PLACE
## 
### 
Underclass hostilities have their place,
but events of the week-end showed a
regrettable lack of propriety, to say no
more, on the part of some of the
younger members of the Stanford stu
dent body. Aside from the military
phase of the episode, serious enough in
itself, the attempts at freshman-soph
omore "rushing" Saturday and Sunday,
conspicuous in which were the efforts
of the '22s to smear their class numer
als on a University building, evidenced
something wanting in the sense of rev
erence and good taste on the part <>t
the participants.
At the time the freshmen were en
gaged in a riot on the fourth floor of
Encina, one of their own classmates
lay dying at the base hospital, and a
Stanford woman passed away the same
night at the emergency hospital in the
Alpha Tau Omega house. A decent re
spect for death would seem to post
pone the underclass rushes till a time

when serious clanger from the epidemic
i> entirely over. And at a time when I
most stringent measures were being |
taken to combat the influenza, nocturnal
"parties" administered by the sopho
mores through means of the tub and
the paddle to scantily clad freshman
were dangerous to say the least, and
any fatalities resulting therefrom would
morally at least be laid at the door of I
the '21s. As to the numerals on the I
library roof, it might be remarked that i
not since the days of the University'." I
founding lias such desecration of Uni I
versity property occurred. One would j
as soon expect to see the senior presi-j
dent smoking on the Quad as to see the
numerals of his class scrawled on a
University building.
A properly supervised underclass * usii j
lias been promised as soon as health |
conditions permit. Till then class fights j
have no place here.
