# Organist Appeals for More Choir Tryoutees
## 
### 
Mr. Warren D. Allen, who is acting
as organist for the University, lias sent
in the following appeal for more stu
dents to register for work in the choir :
Even with the multiplicity of war
tasks confronting all of vis, there is
every reason for believing that the Uni
versity choir should and will maintain
its usual high standard during the com
ing year.
About fifty students have registered
so far, and it is hoped that we ma>
have a hundred. A choir of this size
will enable us to give special monthly
musical services of a high order.
In order to develop a well-balanced
choral body for these services, it is the
intention to use the best solo voices
that can be found in the student body
by forming a double quartet. This small
body of picked voices will form the
necessary "backbone" of the choir, and
it will be a signal honor to be selected,
as only those with experience and qua!
ities of leadership will be chosen.
The regular rehearsal will take place
this evening (Wednesday) at 7:30 and
men and women that are musical and
have not yet joined, will be welcome.
Men and women wishing to try out
for the double quartet should see me
after the rehearsal in the chapel to
night. or on Saturday, between 2 and
4 p.m., at Room 84 in the Quadrangle.
