# "ABOUT STANFORD"
## 
### 
Mondays issue the Daily Palo Alto
begins a new series of articles. The
scope of the series, as will be seen from
the title, will be broad enough to cover
all traditions, customs, history, and per
sonalities connected with the Univers
ity.
The principal reason for the estab
lishment of the "About Stanford" de
partment is to give tilt new students a
chance to learn in the Daily columns,
that which they would ordinarily pick
up through personal contact and con
versation. This year, with many Stan
ford customs necessarily, in abeyance,
and relatively few of the older men
here, such a course becomes practically
impossible, and the need for an easier
textbook in campus lore apparent.
The field is a wide one. In the less
than thirty years since its founding,
there has accumulated about Stan for.1
an immense amount of traditions, class
customs, legends of the campus, and
stories of men and things of the early
days. They are all hallowed with age
and usage, and they go to make up the
background for that indefinable thing,
the Stanford spirit. It pains every
loyal alumnus and student to see any
of them neglected or forgotten. If by
printing these articles, the Daily Palo
Alto is able to infuse into one of the
men to whom Stanford is as yet but a
drill-ground amid attractive surround
ings, a genuine love of the place and a
desire to return thereto after the war
is over, this series will not have been
in vain.
