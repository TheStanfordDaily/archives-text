# THE WAR-A WEEKLY REVIEW
## 
### Professor P.J. Treat 
In the past week the peace discussion
with Germany has advanced a step
through the reference of the corre
spondence to the associated govern
ments by President Wilson. If they
are disposed to effect peace on the
terms laid down by the President and
accepted by Germany, then the military
advisers will arrange the necessary
terms of an armistice, the acceptance of
which by Germany will, in the words
of the President, "afford the best con
crete evidence of her unequivocal ac
ceptance of the terms and principles of
peace."
The second German note of October
20th was picked up by wireless on the
21st, although the official copy was not
delivered to Secretary Lansing until
the 23d. It-covered three points. (1)
As to the armistice: it agrees that the
procedure of evacuation and the con
ditions of an armistice should be left
to the judgment of the military ad
visers, but adds "that the actual stand
ard of power on both sides in the tield
safeguarding and guaranteeing this
standard." Furthermore, "it trusts that
has to form the basis for arrangements
the President of the United States will
approve of no demand which would he
irreconcilable with the honor of the
German people and with opening a |
way to a peace of justice." (2) As to!
the charges of inhumane and illegal
actions, it protests against these
charges, but asserts tlia tthe troops,
during the retirement, are under strict
orders to spare private property and;
exercise care for the populations, and j
that transgressors are being punished.
It has al?o ordered its submarines to
stop sinking passenger boats. (,3) As
to the organization of the present Ger
man government: it indicates the fun
damental change which has taken place,
asserts that the new government has
been formed in complete accord with
the people's representatives, and that
the leader- of the great parties in the
Reichstag are members of this govern
ment. "In future no government can j
take or continue in office without pos
sessing the confidence of the majority
of the Reichstag." And.finally. "the
offer of peace an dan armistice has
come from a government which, free
from arbitrary and irresponsible influ-

ence. is supported by the approval of
the overwhelming majority of the Ger
man people."
lo this note President Wilson re
plied promptly, on the 23d. He
summed up the pledges now made by
the German government, and announced
that on this account he would take up
the question of an armistice with the
associated governments. But he assured
Germany that the only possible armis
tice must leave the allies "in a position
to enforce any arrangements that may
be entered into and to make a renewal
of hostilities on the part of Germany
impossible." Then he explained "in the
frankest possible terms the reason why
extraordinary safeguards must be de
manded." In brief, it is because the
constitutional changes mentioned by the
Foreign Secretary have not been fully
worked out, nor do guarantees exist or
are in contemplation that they will he
permanent. The German people, at
present, have no control over tile pres
ent war. The power of the King of
Prussia to control the policj of the em
pire is still unimpaired; initiative re
mains with those who have hitherto
been masters." "The nations of the
world do not and cannot trust the word
of those who have hitherto been mas
ters of German policy." The govern
ment of the United States "cannot deal
with any but veritable representatives
of the German people who have been
assured of a genuine constitutional
standing as the real rulers of Germany.
If it must deal wit lithe military mas
ters and the monarchical autocrats of
Germany now, or if it is likely to have
to deal with them later in regard to the
international obligations of the German
empire, it must demand, not peace ne
gotiations, but surrender."
This note calls for two actions. (1)
the drawing up of the terms of an
armistice by the allied military advisers,
provided, of course, that the allies con
sent to negotiate with Germany on the
terms already laid down by President
Wilson. (2i \ drastic alteration of the
constitution of the German empire. This
could be rapidly eftected, for it re
quires action in the Diet only, without
reference to the people. But it cannot
be carried out without the consent of

enough votes in the Bundesrath to block
