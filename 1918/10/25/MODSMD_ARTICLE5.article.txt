"It was the Yankee boy who stopped
the Prussian Guard, defeated the Hun,
and drove him back," said Dr. H. K.
Harper, professor of Hebrew at the
Boston University, who delivered a stir
ring address at yesterday's assembly in
the open air theater, and likewise
launched the opening feature of the
United War Work campaign for the
raising of $170,500,000.
L)r. Harper told of one night on the
3d of July when in a little old dugout
he heard this tale from a young French
oflicer, Lieutenant Long, the story of
how our marines stopped the Boche at
Chateau Thierry.
"The French were straggling back,"
-.aid Lieutenant Long, "they had held
their own as long as they could, but
were weary with four years of fighting.
The line was held by a force so thin
that there was only one French soldier
to every 150 feet of front. Eventually
they would have been forced back to
Paris, and the Boche would have
achieved their objective of separating
tlie French and the British."
"It was a remarkable story." continued
Dr Harper, "and I realized then that

one of tlit- greatest epochs of history
had transpired there."
A certain American officer was quoted
as hav ing made the remark, when urged
to make a strategic retreat: "To hell
with strategy. American soldiers are
here to stay or go towards Berlin."
Mail) strangely wonderful tales of
1 personal heroism were also told. Dr.
Harper lias particular admiration for the
marint s who have such extraordinary
confidence in themselves. "And not only
do they have the confidence of heliev
ing themselves invincible." added the
speaker, "but they really do great
things." How young Henry Leonard of
Chicago captured, single-handed and
alone, eighty-two lioche prisoners is a
seemingly incredible tale, but Dr. Harper
has seen and talked with the lad and his
superior officers; so knows the story to
be a true one. Young Leonard was a
runner between lines. On one occasi< n
he lost his way and in trying to find
the American lines stumbled upon a
German machine gun nest. The enemy
at that time believed themselves sur
rounded on three sides, but when Leon
ard assured them they were enveloped
