# CHATEAU THIERRY EVENTS DESCRIBED BY H.R. HARPER
## 
### 
"It was the Yankee boy who stopped
the Prussian Guard, defeated the Hun,
and drove him back," said Dr. H. K.
Harper, professor of Hebrew at the
Boston University, who delivered a stir
ring address at yesterday's assembly in
the open air theater, and likewise
launched the opening feature of the
United War Work campaign for the
raising of $170,500,000.
L)r. Harper told of one night on the
3d of July when in a little old dugout
he heard this tale from a young French
oflicer, Lieutenant Long, the story of
how our marines stopped the Boche at
Chateau Thierry.
"The French were straggling back,"
-.aid Lieutenant Long, "they had held
their own as long as they could, but
were weary with four years of fighting.
The line was held by a force so thin
that there was only one French soldier
to every 150 feet of front. Eventually
they would have been forced back to
Paris, and the Boche would have
achieved their objective of separating
tlie French and the British."
"It was a remarkable story." continued
Dr Harper, "and I realized then that

one of tlit- greatest epochs of history
had transpired there."
A certain American officer was quoted
as hav ing made the remark, when urged
to make a strategic retreat: "To hell
with strategy. American soldiers are
here to stay or go towards Berlin."
Mail) strangely wonderful tales of
1 personal heroism were also told. Dr.
Harper lias particular admiration for the
marint s who have such extraordinary
confidence in themselves. "And not only
do they have the confidence of heliev
ing themselves invincible." added the
speaker, "but they really do great
things." How young Henry Leonard of
Chicago captured, single-handed and
alone, eighty-two lioche prisoners is a
seemingly incredible tale, but Dr. Harper
has seen and talked with the lad and his
superior officers; so knows the story to
be a true one. Young Leonard was a
runner between lines. On one occasi< n
he lost his way and in trying to find
the American lines stumbled upon a
German machine gun nest. The enemy
at that time believed themselves sur
rounded on three sides, but when Leon
ard assured them they were enveloped
on all sides by heavy artillery and about
to be cut to pieces, the foolish captain
gave himself up to the buy, together
with seventy-eight privates and three
lieutenants, on condition that they should
not be shot.
Dr. Harper spoke of the work of the
V. M. C. A. as the great conservcr and
creator of morale in this tremendous
war."
"American morale drops 50 per cent."
lie said, "at first sight of a French vil
lage, and simply because they do not
have there the little comforts and con
veniences that make life worth living."
The Y. M. C. A. takes to our men
overseas the corner drug store, it gives
our boys their favorite beanery or choc
olate shop. These huts are places of
warmth and welcome, they furnish the
social clubs, athletic organizations, writ
ing rooms, and study. Ten million sheets
of writing paper are jjiven out every
month and it is there that the men are
encouraged to write home. The Y. M.
C. A. hut is doing a preventative piece
of work by keeping the boys from the
village and entertaining them at camp
with moving pictures and other forms of
amusement. It is a place for religious
worship, a church, and likewise the near
est thing to home.
One of the things which Dr. Harper
emphasized in bis lecture was the work
of the wonderful women ovef there. He
quoted the statement of General March,
who said. "If your American women
did nothing but walk up and down be
tween the barracks, their coming would
be well worth while."
At the close of his address. Dr. Har
per urged that we, as loyal Americans,
respond willingly to the slight call to
duty facing us today.
"What is $170,000,000?" asked Dr.
Harper, and answered it himself, "I wo
dollars a man. I wish we might catch
the enthusiasm of our men over there,'
he continued, "those men who are
packed in hospitals like sardines but
who always bear a smile, and those men
who are compelled to walk under a
storm of liquid fire. They are lighting
with a spirit that is challenging the ad
miration of the whole world and the
best we can do is to respond to what
is asked of us with the same calmness,
assurity and heroism.
The speaker also paid an admirable
tribute to the sacrifices of the British
Tommies and the French Poilu. and
quoted these few words: "We can
never hope to pay the price that the
of writing paper are given out every
paid for us."

ing rooms, and study. Ten million sheets
of writing paper are jjiven out every
month and it is there that the men are
encouraged to write home. The Y. M.
C. A. hut is doing a preventative piece
of work by keeping the boys from the
village and entertaining them at camp
with moving pictures and other forms of
amusement. It is a place for religious
worship, a church, and likewise the near
est thing to home.
One of the things which Dr. Harper
emphasized in bis lecture was the work
of the wonderful women ovef there. He
quoted the statement of General March,
who said. "If your American women
did nothing but walk up and down be
tween the barracks, their coming would
be well worth while."
At the close of his address. Dr. Har
per urged that we, as loyal Americans,
respond willingly to the slight call to
duty facing us today.
"What is $170,000,000?" asked Dr.
Harper, and answered it himself, "I wo
dollars a man. I wish we might catch
the enthusiasm of our men over there,'
he continued, "those men who are
packed in hospitals like sardines but
who always bear a smile, and those men
who are compelled to walk under a
storm of liquid fire. They are lighting
with a spirit that is challenging the ad
miration of the whole world and the
best we can do is to respond to what
is asked of us with the same calmness,
assurity and heroism.
The speaker also paid an admirable
tribute to the sacrifices of the British
Tommies and the French Poilu. and
quoted these few words: "We can
never hope to pay the price that the
of writing paper are given out every
paid for us."
"It was the Yankee boy who stopped
the Prussian Guard, defeated the Hun,
and drove him back," said Dr. H. K.
Harper, professor of Hebrew at the
Boston University, who delivered a stir
ring address at yesterday's assembly in
the open air theater, and likewise
launched the opening feature of the
United War Work campaign for the
raising of $170,500,000.
L)r. Harper told of one night on the
3d of July when in a little old dugout
he heard this tale from a young French
oflicer, Lieutenant Long, the story of
how our marines stopped the Boche at
Chateau Thierry.
"The French were straggling back,"
-.aid Lieutenant Long, "they had held
their own as long as they could, but
were weary with four years of fighting.
The line was held by a force so thin
that there was only one French soldier
to every 150 feet of front. Eventually
they would have been forced back to
Paris, and the Boche would have
achieved their objective of separating
tlie French and the British."
"It was a remarkable story." continued
Dr Harper, "and I realized then that

one of tlit- greatest epochs of history
had transpired there."
A certain American officer was quoted
as hav ing made the remark, when urged
to make a strategic retreat: "To hell
with strategy. American soldiers are
here to stay or go towards Berlin."
Mail) strangely wonderful tales of
1 personal heroism were also told. Dr.
Harper lias particular admiration for the
marint s who have such extraordinary
confidence in themselves. "And not only
do they have the confidence of heliev
ing themselves invincible." added the
speaker, "but they really do great
things." How young Henry Leonard of
Chicago captured, single-handed and
alone, eighty-two lioche prisoners is a
seemingly incredible tale, but Dr. Harper
has seen and talked with the lad and his
superior officers; so knows the story to
be a true one. Young Leonard was a
runner between lines. On one occasi< n
he lost his way and in trying to find
the American lines stumbled upon a
German machine gun nest. The enemy
at that time believed themselves sur
rounded on three sides, but when Leon
ard assured them they were enveloped
on all sides by heavy artillery and about
to be cut to pieces, the foolish captain
gave himself up to the buy, together
with seventy-eight privates and three
lieutenants, on condition that they should
not be shot.
Dr. Harper spoke of the work of the
V. M. C. A. as the great conservcr and
creator of morale in this tremendous
war."
"American morale drops 50 per cent."
lie said, "at first sight of a French vil
lage, and simply because they do not
have there the little comforts and con
veniences that make life worth living."
The Y. M. C. A. takes to our men
overseas the corner drug store, it gives
our boys their favorite beanery or choc
olate shop. These huts are places of
warmth and welcome, they furnish the
social clubs, athletic organizations, writ

here to stay or go towards Berlin."
Mail) strangely wonderful tales of
1 personal heroism were also told. Dr.
Harper lias particular admiration for the
marint s who have such extraordinary
confidence in themselves. "And not only
do they have the confidence of heliev
ing themselves invincible." added the
speaker, "but they really do great
things." How young Henry Leonard of
Chicago captured, single-handed and
alone, eighty-two lioche prisoners is a
seemingly incredible tale, but Dr. Harper
has seen and talked with the lad and his
superior officers; so knows the story to
be a true one. Young Leonard was a
runner between lines. On one occasi< n
he lost his way and in trying to find
the American lines stumbled upon a
German machine gun nest. The enemy
at that time believed themselves sur
rounded on three sides, but when Leon
ard assured them they were enveloped
on all sides by heavy artillery and about
to be cut to pieces, the foolish captain
gave himself up to the buy, together
with seventy-eight privates and three
lieutenants, on condition that they should
not be shot.
Dr. Harper spoke of the work of the
V. M. C. A. as the great conservcr and
creator of morale in this tremendous
war."
"American morale drops 50 per cent."
lie said, "at first sight of a French vil
lage, and simply because they do not
have there the little comforts and con
veniences that make life worth living."
The Y. M. C. A. takes to our men
overseas the corner drug store, it gives
our boys their favorite beanery or choc
olate shop. These huts are places of
warmth and welcome, they furnish the
social clubs, athletic organizations, writ
ing rooms, and study. Ten million sheets
of writing paper are jjiven out every
month and it is there that the men are
encouraged to write home. The Y. M.
C. A. hut is doing a preventative piece
of work by keeping the boys from the
village and entertaining them at camp
with moving pictures and other forms of
amusement. It is a place for religious
worship, a church, and likewise the near
est thing to home.
One of the things which Dr. Harper
emphasized in bis lecture was the work
of the wonderful women ovef there. He
quoted the statement of General March,
who said. "If your American women
did nothing but walk up and down be
tween the barracks, their coming would
be well worth while."
At the close of his address. Dr. Har
per urged that we, as loyal Americans,
respond willingly to the slight call to
duty facing us today.
"What is $170,000,000?" asked Dr.
Harper, and answered it himself, "I wo
dollars a man. I wish we might catch
the enthusiasm of our men over there,'
he continued, "those men who are
packed in hospitals like sardines but
who always bear a smile, and those men
who are compelled to walk under a
storm of liquid fire. They are lighting
with a spirit that is challenging the ad
miration of the whole world and the
best we can do is to respond to what
is asked of us with the same calmness,
assurity and heroism.
The speaker also paid an admirable
tribute to the sacrifices of the British
Tommies and the French Poilu. and
quoted these few words: "We can
never hope to pay the price that the
of writing paper are given out every
paid for us."
"It was the Yankee boy who stopped
the Prussian Guard, defeated the Hun,
and drove him back," said Dr. H. K.
Harper, professor of Hebrew at the
Boston University, who delivered a stir
ring address at yesterday's assembly in
the open air theater, and likewise
launched the opening feature of the
United War Work campaign for the
raising of $170,500,000.
L)r. Harper told of one night on the
3d of July when in a little old dugout
he heard this tale from a young French
oflicer, Lieutenant Long, the story of
how our marines stopped the Boche at
Chateau Thierry.
"The French were straggling back,"
-.aid Lieutenant Long, "they had held
their own as long as they could, but
were weary with four years of fighting.
The line was held by a force so thin
that there was only one French soldier
to every 150 feet of front. Eventually
they would have been forced back to
Paris, and the Boche would have
achieved their objective of separating
tlie French and the British."
"It was a remarkable story." continued
Dr Harper, "and I realized then that

one of tlit- greatest epochs of history
had transpired there."
A certain American officer was quoted
as hav ing made the remark, when urged
to make a strategic retreat: "To hell
with strategy. American soldiers are
here to stay or go towards Berlin."
