# FIRST PRACTICE SHOWS FORMER RUGBY HEROES IN PADDED UNIFORMS
## 
### H.G. Swendsen 
With the prospects of football on the
boards, both Rugby and American, dope -
■Uers are already beginning to sharpen
their pencils for the usual "well, this
man looks better than that." Naturally,
it is difficult this year to make any sort
of predictions, since stars may be taken
away from the teams at any time, for
service in some other branch of the
army or navy than the S. A. T. C., but
from prospects at present, Stanford
should have an excellent Rugby team
and a better-than-the-average eleven.
Perhaps the greatest strength of the
American squad will be Lieutenant
Badenoch, coach, t his man has turned
out teams at other colleges and at high
schools that have been mysteries to riv
als. 1 lie coach is a big man, a man
who enforces discipline at every stage,
and, best ol all, lie knows football, how
to play it.and how to teach it.
flow far Lieutenant Badenoch has
succeeded was shown last night, when
Randy Flood, a Rugby player in a Rugby
suit, was picking off forward passes as
though he had been playing for years.
Parker, Kaigler, Long, Hawley and
other men are Rugby players, yet under
the coach s tutelage they are fast getting
the hang of the old game.
Lieutenant Larkey. a California player
with experience ,and Lieutenant Spie
gleman, a California athlete also, are as
sisting Lieutenant Badenoch in hTs work.
Both men are hard workers, and should
be a big help.
The coaches are easy to judge, but
when it comes to playing there is more
difficulty. Holt, a star from Portland,
is putting up a great game at quarter
back. !he little fellow is fast and seems
to use his head. The only objection,
possibly, will be his weight. Randy
Mood, already mentioned, will prove a
tower of strength. Imbued with the
Stanford spirit of fight for many years,
Mood i> working into the new game in
great shape. Tie is fast, clever, and a
good tackier.
Henry, either a back or an end, was
on the freshman team last year, and has
never played American before. He
look> to be a iiind .however, when suffi
cient coaching has put him into the
game. The other end might he taken
care of by Parker, another freshman
player from last season. This inan
weighs 170 pounds at present, and al
though new at American, is fast and
clever. Charlie Long, from the '16 vars
ity. is working into combinations at half
back. For a hard hitter and a good man
around the end he should turn out well.
Several other hacks are working out
well. Dolly, for instance, from Southern
California, will put up a hard fight for
a place.
On the line things do not look so well.
Hawley, Kaigler, Swift, possibly Rehfussj
and one or two others are learning fast, j
but there isn't a man with his eye on a J
line position as yet.
Although prospects are bright at pres- ]
ent for a fairly good team, one man, Ken l
Lilly, could put the varsity up with the |
best of them. Lilly is in the aviation
corps at present and hesitates about join- j
ing the S. A. T. C., but if he does come
around, Stanford will have a backfield to
be proud of.
In Rugby there is little to worry about.
Patrick, Clark, Scofield, Sheldon, Marx,;
Van Clief and Ormshy from the last!
year's freshman all-star team are back. •
and going stronger than ever. Second
varsity men and high school stars will
plug up the holes.
In practices so far Scofield has looked i
better than any of the other hopefuls, j
A coach has not been handling the team!
consistently, however, and practices have
been rather ragged. Lieutenant Liver-1
nash, Southern California star for a I
number of years, will be back on his feet j
in a few days, and will handle the fif
teen. He should be able to put things
on the board in short order.
Practices for both branches of the
great sport are being held Wednesday,
Thursday and Friday afternoons and
Saturday mornings.
Much camouflage has been handed out
concerning the big game with California,
but from every indication there will be
a big game. The proposition will be set
tled between Captain Parker and Cap
tain Overton, and both men seem
anxious to turn out teams to play each
other. This will in all probability settle
the matter.
