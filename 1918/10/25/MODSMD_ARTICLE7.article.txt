### 
Severe seismic shocks were felt
throughout Santa Clara valley last night.
I he ' 'riyin has been traced by geologists
to the assembly hall where the Kreshman
Class meeting was in progress.
Dean McDowell first took charge of
the meeting, and alter a few remarks he
pointed to a blushing specimen and
asked him to take the chair. After a few
minutes of frantic arm-waving, this
tearless chairman ex-tempore confessed
himself to be unable to cope with the
situation, and asked for some one who
thought lie could to stand up.
Without a moment's hesitation a blond
frosh Demosthenes from Riverside
stood up and assumed the tottering
throne of the chairmanship. Under his
firm grip the meeting was soon put into
order. Also there were no further ab
dications of the chair during the rest of
the meeting.
The second round was to elect a pres
ident and this part of the program con
sumed the rest of the evening. Fiery
orators, budding Patrick Henrys, orated
to the full extent of their powers. Nom
inations were made, rejected, accepted
and declined.
A sweet little scene was enacted when
some yAung gallant got up and nom
inated "the delegate in the blue dress."
It was a clear case of love at first sight.
When the meeting adjourned four of
the most representative members of the
Freshman Class had already been nomi
nated. The only tangible decision that
I 1922 had arrived at was that it needed a
j president and would elect one in spite
of itselt. Time, 2 hours 44 minutes.
