# GAUZE MASKS MUST BE WORN IN EVERY CLASS IS RULING
## CLASS RULING IS TO BE ENFORCED RIGIDLY S.A.T.C. Quarantine Rules Still in Forceâ€”Report Few New Cases

on Public Health Saturday. The order
is as follows:
"All students are required to wear
gauze masks in lecture rooms, labra

on their way to and from the same."
According to Professor J. P. Mitchell,
chairman of the Health Board, this
will be rigidly enforced. Masks may
be obtained from Mrs. C. K. Ewell at
the Women's Club House. The dis

Red Cross.
The quarantine for members of the
S. A. T. C. will not be lifted until the

few new cases have developed, which
makes this lengthening necessary.
The epidemic at Camp Fremont is
still on the increase and nurses are
badly needed at the base hospital to
help in caring for the men. Many
deaths have been reported among the!

decrease, and the State Uoard of Health j
