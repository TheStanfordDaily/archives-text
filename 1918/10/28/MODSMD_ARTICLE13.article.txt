# GAME WITH SANTA CLARA WEDNESDAY IS CALLED OFF
## NEW COACH APPOINTED Stanford Is to Play With Univ. of So. California November 23 
### 
I lans lor a rugby game with Santa
Clara, which had been on foot for
Wednesday, seem to have fallen
through. Captain Parker wrote some
time ago asking the Santa Clara fifteen
for a game, and no word from them lias
been received. It is therefore impossible
for the scheduled game to take place.
So far as is known, there will be no
game this week.
The game with the University of
Southern California, however, will be
played on November 23, and definite ar
rangements for the contest have been
made. American football will be the
game played and the teams will meet in
Los Angeles.
Lieutenant Livernash, who has been
iti the hospital with the influenza for
some time, will be back 011 his feet in a
few days to coach the rugby team. B. T.
Manigan, an official of the Knights of
Columbus and a famous star in rugby
circles, will arrive here to help him.
Daily practice is being held by the S.
A. 1 , C. men late during the afternoons
and all Saturday afternoons for both
games. As previously announced, all
civilian students are excluded from try
ing out for either team. Over twice as
many men have reported on the field for
American as have for rugby.
\> things look, the star players iron:
both teams will come from the naval unit.
Saturday's practice saw the first
American scrimmage at Stanford since
the big break. The teams were chosen
tor their fleeetness ot foot. I lie "can
didates lined up and raced the length
ot tin: field, and the lirst eleven men
arriving were picked tur positions on
the lirst team, and the next eleven got
places on the second. Those not mak
ing places were put to puntinn and
practicing forward passing.
While about fifty men played the
American game, under Lieutenant
Radenock, the rest played Rugby un
der Lieutenant Larkey.
Although the California game is still
uncertain, the chances are becoming
brighter every day. Captain Parker and
Captain Overton are exchanging letters
and soon expect to come to terms.
Wednesday, at 3:30 p. m.. basketball
practice will start under Lieutenant
Kansohoff. All S. A. T. C. men wishing
' 1 pla\ are requested to sign up before
fuesdav noon.
