# "DAD" MOULTON
## 
### 
While the Daily Palo Alto hesitates
to touch on Palo Alto local politics,
the campaign of E. W. Moulton for
constable of that municipality deserves
mention if only as a word of appre
ciation by those who have known his
work at and for the University. For
many years "Dad" Moulton. as he was
affectionately known by those who
worked with and under him, coached
Stanford track teams to their customary
victories, and through his undying de
votion to Stanford earned the affection
of all followers of the Cardinal.
Now, in straightened circumstances,
he is running for the office of con
stable at the election of November 5.
It is a clear case of the man needing
the office and theoffice needing the man.
For the qualities which made "Dad"
Moulton an unusually successful leader
and trainer of college men, insure that
he will discharge the duties of his office,
if elected, with efficiency, faithfulness,
ability, and tactfulness. On account of
starting his campaign late, his name
will have to be written in on the ballot,
but if all his friends will make it their
duty to do this and see that others do
it.this handicap may be overcome.
Many of the Stanford faculty are ac
tively engaged in behalf of Mr. Moul
ton's campaign. If all students who are
Palo Alto voters, or who can influence
Palo Alto voters, will do likewise, his
election seems assured. At any rate,
the Daily Palo Alto is only voicing
the unmistakable sentiment of the Uni
versity when it wishes "Dad" Moulton
everv success in his race for office.
