Much has been said of giving up our
small luxuries to help carry on the
world war, but there are very few of
us who can truthfully say we have
made any real sacrifices. We> are wont
to experience a thrill of self-satisfac
tion when we refrain from a sundae at
"Sticky's," or when we drop a few stray
pennies into the Relgin milk bottles,
but to say that we have "shared our
bone with a dog when we want it worse
than the dog does," we cannot. How
ever .there are among us those who in
doing their bit have touched the real
elements of sacrifice. These are the
girls who are serving tables at Roble
in order that they may help to alle
viate the sufferings of our stricken
allies across the waters. A number of
these girls have thus given up a max
imum of both time and labor, donating
the proceeds to the fund for Belgian
babies, or to the Red Cross.
