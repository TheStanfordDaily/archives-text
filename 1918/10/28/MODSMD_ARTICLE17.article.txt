# ABOUT STANFORD
## LELAND STANFORD 
### 
Leland Stanford, one of Gilifornia's
foremost men, stands prominent among
the pioneers of this state as a far-sight
ed. keen observer and executive, who
held constantly to ideals which made his
work so important. He was born March
9, 1824, at Watervliet, New York, and
died June 20. 1893, at his home on the
estate near Palo Alto. California. His
early life was spent in an atmosphere of
refinement and culture, where work was
considered no disgrace. His father, who
was interested in the new railroad de
velopments. gave Leland Stanford his
first training in that business, in which
he was so important a factor.
After studying in a law office for three
years, Stanford was admitted to the bar
and practiced in Port Washington, Wis
consin. where he married Miss Jane
Lathrop in 1850. The gold rush which
had attracted Mr. Stanford's brothers to
California finally won him to Michigan
Bluffs, where he developed a flourishing
mercantile business. Later he was inter
ested in the same work in Sacramento.
There it was that Mr. Stanford, with
Collis P. Huntington and others of like
caliber, formed the corporation which
developed the system known as the Cen
tral Pacific Railroad. Difficulties of in
credible proportions were overcome, and
the government, in order to stimulate the

building of the road, made large grants
of land. Stanford was the president of
thin corporation until 1885, and in 1869
drove the spike which connected the
Union Pacific Railroad with the tracks
of the Central Pacific System, making
the transcontinental railroad complete.
In political life Stanford was always
leader. He was one of the originators
of the Republican party in California,
and was a member at large of the Re
publican National Convention at which
Lincoln was nominated for president. He
was a very close friend of Lincoln and
was influential in his nomination.
In 1861 Stanford was elected governor
of California and in 1885 was made sen
ator from this state, and as such gained
great reputation for his connection with
the Land Loan bill.
The greatest sorrow of Stanford's life
occurred when his son. Leland Stanford,
Jr., died from a fever in Florence, Italy,
while on a European trip. In commemo
ration of his memory, Mr. and Mrs.
Stanford founded the Leland Stanford
Junior University on the Stanford es
tate. It is one of the world's largest en
dowed universities, having a fund of
$20,000,000 in land and money. It is a
constant reminder of the love of a father
for his son and. through him, for all
people.
