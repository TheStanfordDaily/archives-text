Dean McDowell has announced
that students, especially members of the
S. A. T. C. who missed a great deal of
class work on account of the epidemic
and other irregularities, need not worry
about having endangered their quar
ter's credits. A committee, of which
Mr. McDowell is a member, will look
into the whole academic situation and
will probably make some arrangement
with the faculty whereby allowance can
be made for individual cases.
