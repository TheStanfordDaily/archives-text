# NEW BUDGET SET FOR UNITED WAR WORK CAMPAIGN
## $79,500,000 INCREASE Campus Committee Elects Dean Huston Chairman of Coming Drive 
### 
President Wilson ha.- authorized that
tlie sum of $170,500,000 lo be raised in
the United War Work campaign be
changed to $250,000,000, according to a
statement made by Dr. John R. Motte
at a meeting of the Central and West
ern departments of the Y. M. C. A.
last Saturday in Chicago.
Dr. Motte went on to explain the
reasons for tlie need of tlie additional
money, especially ii\ connection with the
Y M. C. A. work. The Y. M. C. A.
fund raised last year was exhausted en
tirely by the middle of September. This
means that the association in order to
Carrj on its work in France will have to
go into debt for the three remaining
months of the year before it is allowed
to draw on the funds to be raised in
the coming campaign. This debt will
run into a considerable amount, as $10,-
000,000 a month is needed to keep up
the war activities of the Y. M. C. A.
The same situation faces some of the
other organizations. As a result a new
budget was presented to President Wil
son for the authorization of $250,000.-
000, which the President accepted.

partment was elected chairman of the
United War Work Campaign Commit

Professor S. I). Townley explained
that the work of the campus committee

Work Council of Palo Alto, as all the

pendently as was done in the War
Work drive last year.

of the seven organizations taking part
in the United War Work drive to be
held November 11 to 14 were received i
this morning by A. E. Worthy, sec-1
retar} for the V. M. C. A. on tlie cam
pus Vrrangements are being made by
Professor R. L. Green and Mr. Worthy |
to have all of the posters exhibited a' J
the same time in the postoftice if pos
sible. Duplicate copies will be posted
conspicuously around the campus.
A particularly striking poster has i
been designed for the V. W. C. A., rep-1
resentin gthe women in the munition J
factories. In the background is a win- J
(low through which the V. W. C A. j
hut can be seen. The Y. M C. \. has |
used the latest portrait of General Per-j
sbing painted during his active service
in France with a statement from Gen
eral Pershing supporting the work of;
the Y. M C. A. and asking that the j
people of the United States lend their |
financial support to the further work i
of this organization.
President Wilson ha.- authorized that
tlie sum of $170,500,000 lo be raised in
the United War Work campaign be
changed to $250,000,000, according to a
statement made by Dr. John R. Motte
at a meeting of the Central and West
ern departments of the Y. M. C. A.
last Saturday in Chicago.
Dr. Motte went on to explain the
reasons for tlie need of tlie additional
money, especially ii\ connection with the
Y M. C. A. work. The Y. M. C. A.
fund raised last year was exhausted en
tirely by the middle of September. This
means that the association in order to
Carrj on its work in France will have to
go into debt for the three remaining
months of the year before it is allowed
to draw on the funds to be raised in
the coming campaign. This debt will
run into a considerable amount, as $10,-
000,000 a month is needed to keep up
the war activities of the Y. M. C. A.
The same situation faces some of the
other organizations. As a result a new
budget was presented to President Wil
son for the authorization of $250,000.-
000, which the President accepted.

partment was elected chairman of the
United War Work Campaign Commit
tee at a meeting of the committee held

ments to be made for speakers in con

Professor S. I). Townley explained
that the work of the campus committee

money raised on the campus will go in
on the Santa Clara county quota in
stead of the University, working inde
pendently as was done in the War
Work drive last year.
