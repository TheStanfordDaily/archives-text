# MARX CLEARS UP PROBLEM OF S.A. T.C. MEN'S WORK
## FACULTY IS ADDRESSED Instructors Are Reminded of Special Difficulties of S.A.T.C. 
### 
Acting President C. L>. Marx today
issued an announcement to the mem
bers of the instructing body of the Uni
versity, reminding them of the limita
tions and problems facing students at
the present time and suggesting ways
to work out tlie difficulties. The an
nouncement follows:
October 29. 1918.
To the Members of the Instructing
Body:
in relation to Stanford students who
have been inducted into the S. A. T. C.
the Executive Committee of the Aca
demic Council desires to remind in
structors of certain limitations imposed
by the combination of military training
and control with academic instruction,
and of certain special problems of the
present time:
1. The entire control of the stu
dents' time is in the hands of the com
manding officer representing the War
Department.
2. The University is under contract
to furnish (1) food, (2) lodgings, and
(3) instruction, the latter as prescribed,
and within the limits fixed by the War
I )epartment.
3. The War Department is not con
cerned whether an> of the courses of
instruction for S. A. T. C. men be given
university credit or counted toward
graduation. (That is a matter of tit'
University to determine in accordance
with its own standards.) The War
Department is concerned that the in
struction lie given under as favorable
circumstances as possible and that the
progress of the student be furthered in
every feasible way. To this end the
War Department expects hearty co
operation between the military and the
academic.
4. Up to the present time, instruc
tion lias been seriously interfered with,
and the progress of the student hin
dered. by unusual circumstances.
(a) Want of definite information at
the outset as to the programs of studies
required by the War Department. This
has been the cause of much confusion
and delay.
(b) Lack of mess halls throughout
October. This has necessitated a great
amount of K. P. duty, which has pre
vented attendance upon classes and
greatly reduced the time needed for out
side study.
(c) The widespread prevalence of
Spanish influenza. This has withdrawn
from classes for (on the average) half
of the month more than a third of all
the S. A. T. C. men, and has made
extra military demands upon the re
' mainder.
5. With the beginning of November
! the mess halls will be in use. nearly all
| the men who have been out because of
i the influenza will be again in classes.
and it is hoped that the normal routine
; for the remainder of the quarter will
not need to be again interrupted. The
commanding officer believes that in gen
' eral it will not be necessary that K. P.
and other details of tiie men be made
during class and study hours.
6. Assuming approximately normal
conditions for the future, the immedi
| ate question is as to what may be done
! to make up the losses of the first month
I—at least to make it possible that the
students profitably continue from now
on in the courses prescribed or desired
| by the War Department. It is not prob
able that any one plan will work out a
J solution of this problem. The Execu-1
1 tive Committee suggests the following
possibilities:
(a) In some cases »t may be desirable
to begin the course again practically at
! the beginning.
(b) Tn some cases the student may
i be permitted to omit the portion missed.
'where it is possible to go on satisfac
-1 torily withry.it making up the lost work.
, (c) In some courses special classes
! may be formed for those most seriously
| behind, and by means of this extra
: help the back work may be made up and
( regular work carried as well.
(<i) In some cases the necessary ex
i tra help may be given individually
| without forming new classes,
112 The point is that in every way pos
g sible the War Department's programs
| be made practicable for this present
| quarter, and that students be encour
£ aged not to drop courses where there

is any good chance that they may profit
hy the further work. It may be pre
sumed that the personnel adjutant will
he guided in his recommendation to the
commanding officer not so much hy the
final academic mark (grade) for the
quarter as by the reports of progress
made from time to time to the person
nel adjutant. It is suggested that in so
far as possible the reports upon the
work of individual students this quar
ter, even when university credit may
he withheld, state whether the student
has made as satisfactory progress as
could he expected in view of absences
on account of illness or of assigned
military duties conflicting with aca
demic exercises. The personnel adju
tant will thus be less liable to misjudge
the scholarship of students.

nouncement follows:
October 29. 1918.
To the Members of the Instructing
Body:
in relation to Stanford students who
have been inducted into the S. A. T. C.
the Executive Committee of the Aca
demic Council desires to remind in
structors of certain limitations imposed
by the combination of military training
and control with academic instruction,
and of certain special problems of the
present time:
1. The entire control of the stu
dents' time is in the hands of the com
manding officer representing the War
Department.
2. The University is under contract
to furnish (1) food, (2) lodgings, and
(3) instruction, the latter as prescribed,
and within the limits fixed by the War
I )epartment.
3. The War Department is not con
cerned whether an> of the courses of
instruction for S. A. T. C. men be given
university credit or counted toward
graduation. (That is a matter of tit'
University to determine in accordance
with its own standards.) The War
Department is concerned that the in
struction lie given under as favorable
circumstances as possible and that the
progress of the student be furthered in
every feasible way. To this end the
War Department expects hearty co
operation between the military and the
academic.
4. Up to the present time, instruc
tion lias been seriously interfered with,
and the progress of the student hin
dered. by unusual circumstances.
(a) Want of definite information at
the outset as to the programs of studies
required by the War Department. This
has been the cause of much confusion
and delay.
(b) Lack of mess halls throughout
October. This has necessitated a great
amount of K. P. duty, which has pre
vented attendance upon classes and
greatly reduced the time needed for out
side study.
(c) The widespread prevalence of
Spanish influenza. This has withdrawn
from classes for (on the average) half
of the month more than a third of all
the S. A. T. C. men, and has made
extra military demands upon the re
' mainder.

bers of the instructing body of the Uni
versity, reminding them of the limita
tions and problems facing students at
the present time and suggesting ways
to work out tlie difficulties. The an
nouncement follows:
October 29. 1918.
To the Members of the Instructing
Body:
in relation to Stanford students who
have been inducted into the S. A. T. C.
the Executive Committee of the Aca
demic Council desires to remind in
structors of certain limitations imposed
by the combination of military training
and control with academic instruction,
and of certain special problems of the
present time:
1. The entire control of the stu
dents' time is in the hands of the com
manding officer representing the War
Department.
2. The University is under contract
to furnish (1) food, (2) lodgings, and
(3) instruction, the latter as prescribed,
and within the limits fixed by the War
I )epartment.
3. The War Department is not con
cerned whether an> of the courses of
instruction for S. A. T. C. men be given
university credit or counted toward
graduation. (That is a matter of tit'
University to determine in accordance
with its own standards.) The War
Department is concerned that the in
struction lie given under as favorable
circumstances as possible and that the
progress of the student be furthered in
every feasible way. To this end the
War Department expects hearty co
operation between the military and the
academic.
4. Up to the present time, instruc
tion lias been seriously interfered with,
and the progress of the student hin
dered. by unusual circumstances.
(a) Want of definite information at
the outset as to the programs of studies
required by the War Department. This
has been the cause of much confusion
and delay.
(b) Lack of mess halls throughout
October. This has necessitated a great
amount of K. P. duty, which has pre
vented attendance upon classes and
greatly reduced the time needed for out
side study.
(c) The widespread prevalence of
Spanish influenza. This has withdrawn
from classes for (on the average) half
of the month more than a third of all
the S. A. T. C. men, and has made
extra military demands upon the re
' mainder.
5. With the beginning of November
! the mess halls will be in use. nearly all
| the men who have been out because of
i the influenza will be again in classes.
and it is hoped that the normal routine
; for the remainder of the quarter will
not need to be again interrupted. The
commanding officer believes that in gen
' eral it will not be necessary that K. P.
and other details of tiie men be made
during class and study hours.
6. Assuming approximately normal
conditions for the future, the immedi
| ate question is as to what may be done
! to make up the losses of the first month
I—at least to make it possible that the
students profitably continue from now
on in the courses prescribed or desired
| by the War Department. It is not prob
able that any one plan will work out a
J solution of this problem. The Execu-1
1 tive Committee suggests the following
possibilities:
(a) In some cases »t may be desirable
to begin the course again practically at
! the beginning.
(b) Tn some cases the student may
i be permitted to omit the portion missed.
'where it is possible to go on satisfac
-1 torily withry.it making up the lost work.
, (c) In some courses special classes
! may be formed for those most seriously
| behind, and by means of this extra
: help the back work may be made up and
( regular work carried as well.
(<i) In some cases the necessary ex
i tra help may be given individually
| without forming new classes,
112 The point is that in every way pos
g sible the War Department's programs
| be made practicable for this present
| quarter, and that students be encour
£ aged not to drop courses where there

is any good chance that they may profit
hy the further work. It may be pre
sumed that the personnel adjutant will
he guided in his recommendation to the
commanding officer not so much hy the
final academic mark (grade) for the
quarter as by the reports of progress
made from time to time to the person
nel adjutant. It is suggested that in so
far as possible the reports upon the
work of individual students this quar
ter, even when university credit may
he withheld, state whether the student
has made as satisfactory progress as
could he expected in view of absences
on account of illness or of assigned
military duties conflicting with aca
demic exercises. The personnel adju
tant will thus be less liable to misjudge
the scholarship of students.
