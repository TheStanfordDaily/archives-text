# JUNIOR WAR BOARD WILL BE ELECTED TOMORROW NIGHT
## NOMINATE TWENTY-FIVE Saving of Pits and Shells for Gas Masks Urged by Salvage Board 
### 
Twenty-five of the freshmen and
new women have been nominated by
the Women's War Board, from which
will be chosen ten tomorrow night at
Roble Hall, to serve on the junior
War Board, which has just been or
ganized.
This second board will be an aux
iliary to the Senior War Board. It
will train members who will later serve
on the senior board and thus will
strengthen the service which the or
ganization aims to give during the pe
riod of the war.
Salvage work has begun and special
retepticles placed on the campus to hold
contributions.
Fruit pits and nut shells are to be
placed in the red, white, and blue bar
rel in front of the old Zeta Psi house,
which is now the new headquarters of
the war board. House managers are
urged by the salvage committee to have
these pits saved by the cooks. They
are used in making gas masks and are
especially line, as the charcoal obtained
by burning the pits makes the harmful
qualities of the gases practically nega
tive.
Tlie tinfoil campaign is now on, also,
and all pieces, folded Hat, not rolled in
balls, may be left in the boxes which
have been placed in the Women's Club
House, the Union, the cigar store,
women's rest room and in Roble. Large
quantities of tinfoil are needed and the
committee hopes that the campus will
respond to the appeal.
