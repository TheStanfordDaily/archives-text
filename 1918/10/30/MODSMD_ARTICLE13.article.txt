# AMERICAN GAME WITH MATHER FIELD HERE NOVEMBER 16
## MORE DATES EXPECTED Lieutenant Badenoch Will Pick Varsity Squad in a Few Days 
### 
On Saturday, November 16, the Stan
ford S. A. T. C. will tangle with the fly
ers from Mather Field. This is the first
American football game that has been
arranged to be played on Stanford Field.
No first team has been chosen as yet, but
a tentative Varsity is expected soon No
captain has been elected, as it is still
hoped that Captain Lilly will be able to
stay here and play.
The S. A. T. C. athletic officers' staff
had no statement to make on the Cali
fornia game. But there will be no game
with California on November 23, as a
San Francisco paper said this morning,
for Stanford is to play the University of
Southern California, at Los Angeles, on
that date.
Nothing further has been heard from
Santa Clara, but it is expected that at
least one game will be played some time
during the season.
On account of the influenza, no games
have been scheduled with institutions
hereabouts. As soon as the quarantine
lifted several games will be arranged.
