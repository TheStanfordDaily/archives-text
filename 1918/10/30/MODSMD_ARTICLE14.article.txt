## 
### 
\\ ord has been received by President
Emeritus Rranner frotn Frank Warner
Turner, '12. announcing the death of his
younger brother, Thomas Norton Tur
ner, '14. formerly departmental assistant
in geology and mining. The younger
Norton is believed to have been upon
the ship Sophia which was recently
wrecked this side of Skagway, en route
from Alaska. All lives were lost. Frank
states in his letter that as no word has
been heard from Thomas, he was un
doubtedly on board.
Thomas Turner had been in Alaska
and Siberia for some years as a mining
expert. He had just enlisted in Alaska
and was coming to California in the
hope of securing permission to go to
Siberia with an engineering unit.
His death is deeply felt by his former
professors here, because of his sterling
worth as a man and hi.s brilliancy as an
engineer.
