# AN APPRECIATION
## 
### 
The thanks of the University are due
to those who in recent weeks have
given, at great sacrifice to themselves,
their time in combating the epidemic
which has attacked Stanford with un
usual violence. Much of the work, and
many of those who risked their per
sonal safety to aid the victims of the
influenza, must of necessity go unmen
tioned, but a few names call for spe
cial treatment.
In his new capacity as dean of men,
J. E. McDowell has taken it upon him
self to be personally responsible for the
welfare of the men students at the
various hospitals and infirmaries. Ow
ing to the unpreparedness of the com
munity to take care of so many cases
and the consequent disorganization, this
has particularly valuable, and in several
cases, the lives of students stricken
have been doubtless due to Mr. Mc-
Dowell's timely services. For days at
a time the dean of men was constantly
at the bedsides of the influenza patients,
or answering telegrams from parents,
or making arrangements for the com
fort of the men in the hospitals. Mr
McDowell has announced that his con
ception of his new office is that of a
friend and advisor and not a police
man. and in the first weeks in the new
office. this theory has certainly been
carried out.
Especial thanks are also due to Miss
Harriet Bradford for her work among
the women students, and to Dr. von
Geldern, the medical advisor. Himself
a victim of the epidemic. Dr. von Gel
dern worked incessantly treating the
more serious cases in the hospitals when
others better able to be up were recup
erating in bed.
The deaths of nine students have had
a sobering effect upon the whole Uni
versity, but in this time of trouble the
tireless efforts of the men and women
who fought the plague will stand as a
bright page in Stanford annals.
