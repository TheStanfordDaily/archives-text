# WAY BACK, FROSH!
## 
### 
The manner in which some of those
members of the Class of 1922 not eli
gible to the army Stetson wear their
flannel derbies is a crying example of
the difficulties under which the fresh
men struggle without adequate fatherly
advice from the upper classes. The
gray badges of newness were not par
ticularly designed as aids to beauty,
but when they are worn as eyeshades
the general effect is something less than
human.
For the benefit of the new-comers,
the following directions for the correct
location of a freshman cap are offered:
Draw an imaginary line from one ear
to another, through the intervening

void. Draw another straight back from
between the eyes. Erect a perpendic
ular from the point where the two lines
meet. The red button should rest on
the point where this perpendicular irst
meets the light oi day.
