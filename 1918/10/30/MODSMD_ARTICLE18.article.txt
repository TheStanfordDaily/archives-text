To Mrs. Leland Stanford. Stanford
University owes a debt of gratitude for
the endless-sacrifices she made in order
that this institution might live. It was
Mrs. Stanford who took up the work
and carried it on with nobleness of pur
pose when Leland Stanford died. She
carried it through two periods during
which it seemed that Stanford Uni
versity must cease.
Sacrifice was the keynote of Mrs.
Stanford's life. When other financial
sources failed during the time that the
estate was in litigation Mrs. Stanford
paid the faculty with funds reserved
for her household expenses. Professors
and members connected with the Uni
versity stayed when there was no
promise of a salary.
During all the times of financial un
certainty. Mrs. Stanford kept her jew
els asa fund upon which she could rely
if other sources failed. Fortunately,
these were kept intact and she was able
to establish the famous "Jewel Fund."
This fund at one time was dedicated
to the building of the Memorial
Church, but other resources were found
and the money obtained from the sale
of the jewels was "made a permanent
endowment of the library of the Uni
versity."
Stanford University is the. richest
endowed university in the world and
much of this wealth came from Mrs.
Stanford .who received the great wealth

of her husband at his death. The sum
she gained from selling her mansion sin
devoted to the building of a museum
and art gallery, and also land and st
curities were an added gift of $30,000.-
000.
Other institutions received the ben
efit from Mrs. Stanford's philanthropic
nature. She gave freely to schools and
kindergartens and established a hospital
for children at Albany, New York, her
birthplace.
The greatest freedom in administra
tion and teaching was allowed. .Mr-
Stanford realized the error in exercis
ing too rigid a control over the activi
ties of tlie institution, lnorder to give
the trustees greater freedom, she start
ed to tour tlie world in 1904-5. It was
while in Honolulu that she was taken
suddenly ill and died February 28. 1905.
David Starr Jordan gave the follow
ing appreciation at the time of her
death:
"No one outside the University can
understand the difficulties in her wa\
in the linal establishment of the Uni
versity. and her patient deeds of self
sacrifice can be known only to those
who saw them from day to day. Sorye
day the world will understand a part of
this. It will then know her for tin
wisest, as well as the most generou-.
friend of learning in our time. Wise,
devoted, steadfast, prudent, patient, and
just—every good word we can use was,
hers by right."

while in Honolulu that she was taken
suddenly ill and died February 28. 1905.
David Starr Jordan gave the follow
ing appreciation at the time of her
death:
"No one outside the University can
understand the difficulties in her wa\
in the linal establishment of the Uni
versity. and her patient deeds of self
sacrifice can be known only to those
who saw them from day to day. Sorye
day the world will understand a part of
this. It will then know her for tin
wisest, as well as the most generou-.
friend of learning in our time. Wise,
devoted, steadfast, prudent, patient, and
just—every good word we can use was,
hers by right."

To Mrs. Leland Stanford. Stanford
University owes a debt of gratitude for
the endless-sacrifices she made in order
that this institution might live. It was
Mrs. Stanford who took up the work
and carried it on with nobleness of pur
pose when Leland Stanford died. She
carried it through two periods during
which it seemed that Stanford Uni
versity must cease.
Sacrifice was the keynote of Mrs.
Stanford's life. When other financial
sources failed during the time that the
estate was in litigation Mrs. Stanford
paid the faculty with funds reserved
for her household expenses. Professors
and members connected with the Uni
versity stayed when there was no
promise of a salary.
During all the times of financial un
certainty. Mrs. Stanford kept her jew
els asa fund upon which she could rely
if other sources failed. Fortunately,
these were kept intact and she was able
to establish the famous "Jewel Fund."
This fund at one time was dedicated
to the building of the Memorial
Church, but other resources were found
and the money obtained from the sale
of the jewels was "made a permanent
endowment of the library of the Uni
versity."
Stanford University is the. richest
endowed university in the world and
much of this wealth came from Mrs.
Stanford .who received the great wealth

of her husband at his death. The sum
she gained from selling her mansion sin
devoted to the building of a museum
and art gallery, and also land and st
curities were an added gift of $30,000.-
000.
Other institutions received the ben
efit from Mrs. Stanford's philanthropic
nature. She gave freely to schools and
kindergartens and established a hospital
for children at Albany, New York, her
birthplace.
The greatest freedom in administra
tion and teaching was allowed. .Mr-
Stanford realized the error in exercis
ing too rigid a control over the activi
ties of tlie institution, lnorder to give
the trustees greater freedom, she start
ed to tour tlie world in 1904-5. It was
