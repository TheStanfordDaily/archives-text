# College Notes

### 
The University of Washington is to
have a football team this year, it has
been recently announced. There will
be at least two big games, one with
Oregon Agricultural College and an
other not yet decided upon. Nothing is
to be done, however, until the influenza
ban is lifted at Washington

Upon the recommendation of the na
tional secretary of the Red Cross, two
scholarships of $200 each have been
instituted at the University of Califor
nia for Serbian students studying either
medicine, civil engineering, mechanical
engineering, electrical engineering, or
sanitary engineering. The purpose of

these scholarships is to provide men
trained in practical sciences for the re
building of Serbia after the war.
The University of Oregon will meet
the University of California in a benefit
football game some time in November.
The proceeds will be given to the
United War Work funds.
Influenza vaccine made from the
blood of University of California stu
dents has been distributed and inocu
lations will be made free on those who
desire to take precautions against the
further spread of the disease. The num
ber of cases on the campus is on the
decrease.
Although the campus is under mil
itary discipline, the University of Cali
fornia is to have its annual junior class
activities; the prom will be given as
usual, but tin- farce will be replaced
by a one-act play and vaudeville stunts.
I Members of the class are to submit
I manuscripts for the play.
