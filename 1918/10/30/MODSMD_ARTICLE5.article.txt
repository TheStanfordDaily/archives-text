# Hoary "Holdovers" Will be Salvaged This Evening
## 
### 
"Holdovers meet this evening at 7 :3d
p.m. in the Women's Club House, up
stairs."
The campus has salvaged tinfoil, old
clothes, and papers, diligently and put
riotically, but this evening will witness
the most interesting salvage collection
of allâ€”the assembling of all the bat
tered wrecks of humanity that have
been cast up on the shores of time by
action of the faculty axe.
What is to transpire a tthe meeting
is shrouded in deep secrecy. Perchance
the holdovers are planning to guard the
Big Tree from the aerial attacks of
the attaches of Mather Field in antici
pation of the game scheduled with the
aviation eleven.
