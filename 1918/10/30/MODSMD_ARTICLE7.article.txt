Reunions of Stanford men in France
are told of in an interesting letter re
ceived from Lieut. Richard R. Coleman,
Jr., better known as "Dick" Coleman,
who is now in aviation service in
France. Coleman speaks of meeting
"Grubby" Clover, A. C. Kimber, "Stew"
Freeman and Allen Nichols, all of
whom have been killed in action since
the letter was written.
"We were at Tours all winter. I. had
a long delay getitng into the flying
game, so I grabbed a job man-hand
ling a big Packard truck. With the job
I drew a trip to Paris at Thanksgiving
time. On my three-day trip I behaved
myself as any son of Stanford ought to
behave and went to the Follies Ber
gere. liy way of common interest I
might say that 1 met "Grubby" Clover
there and went with him to his uncle's
home for dinner.
"1 also met in Paris at that time

Harry Frantz, 'Skinny' Aupperle, Neil
Petree, Frank Taylor, and half a dozen
Stanford men just back from the
Balkans with the ambulance outfit. At
Tours with me during the winter were
Stew Freeman. Bob Fithian, Joe East
man, Kimbyr. Schulze. Ed Hastingsâ€”
all of Stanford. Joe Eastman is up at
the front now and. I have heard, has
a Hoc he to his credit. Kimber is due at
the front very shortly, having left here
a month ago. Schulze and Bob Fithian
are here now. Ed Hastings is 'some
where' and 'Stew' Freeman, as you have
probably heard, has been killed. Then
there was H. J. Ling at Tours, also, but
his heart went back on him coming over
on the boat and after a two months'
siege at the base hospital in Chateau
reux lie was removed from flying status
on account of bis heart and .is now
