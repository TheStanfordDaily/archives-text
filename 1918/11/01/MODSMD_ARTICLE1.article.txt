# DOROTHY DRISCOLL IS MADE EDITOR OF 1920 ANNUAL
## BRILL ELECTED MANAGER Tryouts to Begin at Once for Officers of Next Year's Quad Book 
### 
Editor and manager of the 1920 Quad
have been selected by the Quad board
of the Junior Class, consisting of Mrs.
Ruth Searcy, chairman; Miss Dorothy
Driscoll, Miss Mary Field, C. E. Ran
dall and Kenneth Crouch. Miss Doro
thy Driscoll will head the publication as
editor. Selling Brill is to have charge
of the financial business as manager, and
Miss Marguerite Roberts will be assist
ant manager.
Under the capable leadership of Miss
Driscoll, the prospects for the 1920 Quad
are splendid. She has been associated
with the Daily Palo Alto since her
sophomore year and is now the manag
ing editor of the paper. She has shown
marked journalistic ability and can make
the year book a big success, though she
will be working under great difficulties
due to war conditions.
The position of manager is one of par
ticular importance, especially during the
war. Brill has proved himself excep
tionally capable of managing the busi
ness end of the annual. Miss Roberts
is now on the business staff of the Daily
Palo Alto.
Tryouts for next year's editor -and
manager will begin immediately. The
successful candidate will be appointed by
the editor of this year's book. Women
who wish to try out for editor should
report to Miss Driscoll, while men try
outees at Sequoia are to report to K. W.
Crouch, room 4, Sequoia, and men at
Encina to C. E. Randall, room 544.
Those trying out for the position of
managing editor are to notify Selling
Brill, this year's manager, at room 21,
Sequoia.
Brill wishes a good turnout for this
competition as the field for choice must
be a large one. Next year will be an
important one in the history of the an
nual and the best must be chosen.
Junior dues for the year have been
set at $6, which includes payment for
the Quad just as it did last year. These
dues should be paid as soon as possible
in order that work on the book may be
gin immediately. The class photog
rapher has not yet been chosen, but pic-
tures will be taken as soon as he is an
nounced. Men who will be leaving for
service should have this done before go
ing.
This book will be published only by
the combined efforts of the Junior Class,
and the difficulties which were great last
year will be even greater this time. As
a matter of class loyalty, the editor and
manager urge all Juniors to pay up at
once, and make this annual equal those
of the previous years.

Encina to C. E. Randall, room 544.
Those trying out for the position of
managing editor are to notify Selling
Brill, this year's manager, at room 21,
Sequoia.
Brill wishes a good turnout for this
competition as the field for choice must
be a large one. Next year will be an
important one in the history of the an
nual and the best must be chosen.
Junior dues for the year have been
set at $6, which includes payment for
the Quad just as it did last year. These
dues should be paid as soon as possible
in order that work on the book may be
gin immediately. The class photog
rapher has not yet been chosen, but pic-
tures will be taken as soon as he is an
nounced. Men who will be leaving for
service should have this done before go
ing.
This book will be published only by
the combined efforts of the Junior Class,
and the difficulties which were great last
year will be even greater this time. As
a matter of class loyalty, the editor and
manager urge all Juniors to pay up at
once, and make this annual equal those
of the previous years.
Editor and manager of the 1920 Quad
have been selected by the Quad board
of the Junior Class, consisting of Mrs.
Ruth Searcy, chairman; Miss Dorothy
Driscoll, Miss Mary Field, C. E. Ran
dall and Kenneth Crouch. Miss Doro
thy Driscoll will head the publication as
editor. Selling Brill is to have charge
of the financial business as manager, and
Miss Marguerite Roberts will be assist
ant manager.
Under the capable leadership of Miss
Driscoll, the prospects for the 1920 Quad
are splendid. She has been associated
with the Daily Palo Alto since her
sophomore year and is now the manag
ing editor of the paper. She has shown
marked journalistic ability and can make
the year book a big success, though she
will be working under great difficulties
due to war conditions.
The position of manager is one of par
ticular importance, especially during the
war. Brill has proved himself excep
tionally capable of managing the busi
ness end of the annual. Miss Roberts
is now on the business staff of the Daily
Palo Alto.
Tryouts for next year's editor -and
manager will begin immediately. The
successful candidate will be appointed by
the editor of this year's book. Women
who wish to try out for editor should
report to Miss Driscoll, while men try
