# THE 						STAFF

The announcement of the Daily Palo Alto Muff, made today after the cus
tomary four weeks' tryout, is a striking indication of war conditions. The names
of only four men appear e>n the whole editorial staff. The usual system of news
editors has had to be temporarily discontinued. The old custom of grading by
classes has been completely abandoned. However, these features, together with
the ncessity of printing only three issues a week, are merely transient, and will
disappear as soon as Stanford reverts to normal conditions again.
The leading name announced at this time is Miss Ruth Searcy, 20. As
University publicity director, Miss Searcy has been and will continue to be of
invaluable aid to the paper in the compilation of news. Miss Searcy has been
connected with the Daily Palo Alto for two years .and her experience is par
ticularly helpful this year, when this quality is greatly lacking in all journalistic
work.
On the news staff. Miss Ruth Lakin. 18. is- to have charge of the "About
Stanford" department, which will be one of the most important departments of
the Daily this year. Her ability as a writer and familiarity with Stanford ideals
make this appointment especially appropriate. The Other old members of the
staff who are back at work this quarter .ind upon whom the success of the paper
largch depends, are: Miss Eleanor Allen, '20, R. W Kenny, '21. Miss. Ellen Cal
houn, '20. Miss Ruth Elsinger, '20, Miss Thelma Carlisle. 20. Miss i>oroth>
Plummer, 19. and Miss Lucy Langdon, '19.
Two men and four women are added to the staff after four weeks of try
outs. The Daily Palo Alto takes pleasure in introducing the following future
highlights of the Stanford journalistic world: R. L. Wiel, '22, J. W. Rhodes,
'22. Miss Margaret McElin. '19, Miss Margaret McCall. '21. Miss Mildred Thomp
son. '22 .and Miss Evelyn Gore, '22. This list of new staff members is shorter
than usual, but makes up in faithfulness and writing ability what it lacks in
numbers.
