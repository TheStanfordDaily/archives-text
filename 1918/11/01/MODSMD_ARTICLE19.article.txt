# THE
						WAR-A WEEKLY REVIEW
## 
### Professor P.J. Treat 
Tlit- European dispatches of the past
week have covered events of the great
est importance. So much has been hap
pening that the over-burdened cables
could only carry the briefest references
to developments which really were en
titled to columns of comment. To
properly analyze the news of the week,
to sift out fact from rumor, and to
grasp the significance of even the
minor items, has been almost impossi
ble.
Three facts stand out pre-eminently:
the unconditional surrender of Turkey,
the break-up of Austria-Hungary, and
the glorious victory of our Italian al
lies. After the surrender of Bulgaria
it was only a question of time when
Turkey would accept the inevitable.
Early in the week she released General
Townshend, who had been taken
prisoner at Kut-el-Amara in 1916, to
present her request for an armistice to
the British admiral at Mudros, in the
island of Lemnos. Later Turkish plen
ipotentiaries proceeded there ,and an
armistice was signed on the 30th, which
went into effect at noon on the 31st.
The full term shave not been published,
but they include the surrender of the
Dardanelles forts, free passage of the
Bosporus to the Black Sea, and the re
lease of prisoners. The final terms will,
of course, be arranged at the general
peace conference.
From Austria comes word of the es
tablishment of independent govern
ments in Hungary, in German Austria,
in Bohemia and Slovakia, and in Crotia
(the Jugo-Slavs). Rioting has taken
place in Vienna, Budabest, and Agram.
In Prague the National Committee of
the Czecho-Slovaks seem to have affairs
well in hand, and the old officials have
been allowed to function provisionally.
The National Council of German Aus
tria has appealed to President Wilson
"to give the German nation the right to
dispose of itself." The dissolution of
the dual monarchy may present diffi
cult problems of boundary adjustment
between the several states. Along the
frontiers, where the nationalities are
mixed, it must follow that racial minor
ities will lie within states made up
largely of other peoples. But if the
new constitutions provide for absolute
equality in civil rights this condition
should not lie a serious one. The new
states, if definitely established before
the final peace, will be expected to
accept the erms laid down for the em
pire as a whole.
So near at hand docs the general
armistice seem to be, that the Italian
offensive may prove the last great vic
tory of the allied arms. The Italian
front had been comparatively quiet
since the repulse of the Austrian offen
sive in June, which, let it be remem
bered, was the first allied success of the
present year. The Italians opened their
offensive, on a small scale, on October
19th, but major operations did not com
mence until the 24th ,the anniversary
of their disaster at Caporetto, a year
ago. The fighting began in the hill
country along the Brenta on a narrow
front. General Diaz followed the suc
cessful strategy of General Foch by
throwing in his armies one after an-

other, widening the front to forty and
then to ninety miles, until all the Ital
ian armies were engaged. With them
were fighting the 10th British army, a
French division, a Czecho-Slovak unit,
and the 332 d American regiment. The
Piave river was soon crossed, and a
rapid advance effected in the presence
of a general demoralization of the Aus
trian armies. By Wednesday the Ital
ians had seized the pass of Follina,
which enabled them to separate the
enemy armies. Yesterday they report
ed a total of 50,000 prisoners and over
300 guns. In the meantime the Aus
trian government announced that, in
pursuance of its peace aims, it was
evacuating all enemy territory. The
Italain government replied that it was
too late in its case, and was apparently
determined to drive out the Austrian*
before any armistice was granted. But
yesterday Austrian representatives were
received by General Diaz, and their
request for an armistice was trans
mitted to the War Council at Ver
sailles.
On the western front the fighting has
shifted from sector to sector. In gen
eral, the Flanders front was quiet, until
it blazed up again yesterday when
French, British, Belgians, and some
Americans resumed the offensive. Tin
main British front has been fairly quiet,
due to the necessity of building roads
and bringing up material. Three French
armies have been pounding away be
tween the Oise and the Aisne, with
such success that in spite of desperate
efforts to stop them, the line of the
Oise has been taken and the Germans
ar efalling back to the Meuse. On the
American front dogged fighting has
been in progress, the first army operat
ing west of the Meuse and the second
army east of it. Now several import
ant junction points on the railway be
hind the German lines are under bom
bardment of American heavy artillery.
Two notes have been received from
Germany during the week. The first,
of the 26th, repeats the assertion that
its peace negotiations are being con
ducted by a people's government to
which the military is now subject. The
second furnished information as to the
development of the constitutional
changes. A number of interesting ru
mors have come out of Germany, in
cluding another report of the Kaiser's
abdication. A remarkable summary, in
a few words, of what has happened to
Germany is ascribed to Maxmilian
Harden, of the Berlin Zunkuft: "We
started the with a dirty trick and all
our subsequent victories have been the
results of dishonesty. William II is a
film hero and Germany a vulgar cine
matograph show. We sit today on the
ruins of thirty years of Hohenzollern
politics."
The representatives of the aliled gov
ernments have assembled at Paris, the
United States being represented by
Colonel E. M. House. Informal con
ferences developed a general unanimity
of opinion, and the first formal meet
ing was held yesterday. The terms of
the armistice will soon be worked out.
and in the meantime journalists the
world over are engaged in guesses as
to their nature.
