# LANE CLINIC APPEALS FOR FINANCIAL AID
## Incomplete Returns From Roble and Sororities Show Big Response 
### 
Although the returns of the amount of
money donated to Lane Clinic Auxiliary
in response to an appeal for aid made in
the sorority houses and at Roble Club
last Monday night are not complete, the
funds already received show a splendid
support from the women. Roble Club
last week subscribed $25 to the Auxiliary
from its treasury and $22.50 has already
been donated by the individual members.
Final reports from the sororities have
not been received.
A minimum of 25 cents per person was
asked for, and D. C. Gardner, treasurer,
feels assured that the amount will be
fully subscribed.
Active work of the various social serv
ice branches of the Clinic will probably
be started next week, according to the
president, Miss Frances Willis. '20. As
there will be no Red Cross work to do,
Miss Willis believes that this will be a
splendid opportunity for campus women
to assist the Clinic work.
Lane Clinic Auxiliary is the one Uni
versity charity and is supported by the
voluntary contributions of the students.
It sends $10 monthly to San Francisco,
where the money is dispersed in a num
ber of worthy means. Part of the fund
is used in the purchasing of crutches,
glasses, and other medical equipment for
the patients who can not afford to buy
these things for themselves. Medical aid
is given free at the Clinic by some of the
best doctors and surgeons in San Fran
cisco, who volunteer their services, but
Stanford's share in Clinic is to augment
its work by the provision of a means of
carrying out the physician's directions.
Over nine hundred cases were handled
by the social service department of the
Clinic last year, and Miss Barnett, social
service chairman, hopes to increase the
extent of her service this year. This will
only be possible by the hearty support of
Stanford.
