# ABOUT STANFORD
## LELAND STANFORD JUNIOR 
### 
Leland Stanford Jr., the only son of
Senator and Mrs. Stanford, was born
on the 14th of May, 1868, in Sacramento,
Cal. '1 he successes which had made his
father's name known throughout the
state had been achieved, and his parents
at this time received widespread con
gratulations.
Leland's infancy was passed in Sacra
mento, but in 1874 the family removed
to San Francisco, where the Stanford
mansion on California street was being
erected. \ he boy at an early age showed
signs of the taste which characterized
his more advanced years. His playroom,
which he always preserved exactly as he
fitted it up when ten years old, gives evi
dence of these characteristics. A toy
steam engine and locomotive, a tele
graphic apparatus, a telephone, a carpen
ter's bench and tools, had prominent
places in the room. The walls were cov
ered with pictures and drawings of ma
chinery of all kinds. His tastes and in
terests in all things especially related to
railroads was marked, and when but
twelve years old he himself laid down a

track four hundred feet long at the Palo
Alto estate. On his last railroad jour
ney from Rome to France, when he was
so ill that the could only lie helpless in
the car, he begged that someone keep
him informed as to the condition of the
bridges crossed, the way the ties were
laid, and the general construction of the
road. lie was constantly in his travels
comparing foreign railway systems with
those in America.
Leland passed most of his childhood,
when not travelling abroad, on the
Stanford estate at Palo Also. As a mere
boy he would roam the country on his
pony, his dogs following him, and a pic
nic among the redwoods of the Coast
range was his idea of happiness. Side
by side with his love of nature was his
love of art and of all things beautiful.
Long before he had been through half
the famous picture galleries of Europe
he had acquired not only taste and judg
ment, but a knowledge of many of the
technicalities of art that made his crit
icisms always shrewd and generally very
correct.
