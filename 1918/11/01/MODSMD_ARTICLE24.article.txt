Experiences of an ambulance driver
are related 1 >\- Horace VV. Culler, '18,
now in France, in a letter received re
cently. His description of driving
through a barrage is particularly in
teresting.
Following are extracts from his let
ter :
"In two long weeks on the hottest
front our section had a casualty rate
higher than the infantry. To know
that we are alive to tell the tale is a
miracle and another proof that a driver
is seldom killed. Our men are seasoned
veterans nujv. Imagine a deadly bar
rage coming up the road, with heavy
explosives tailing first on one edge of
the road and then the other from guns
ten miles away. The explosions occur
about sixty feet apart. One can't stop
to think and I>e safe. If you've a fast
car and you art going in the direction

the barrage is going, speed will win as
the explosions are about thirty seconds
apart. But if the barrage is meeting
you as your car advances toward it, one
had better jump for safety into a ditch
alongside and curl up like a snail, cov
ering as much of the body as possible
with the helmet. Two of our men were
too slow. Both lie in hospitals.
"It is a game. Even the marines say
they would rather be in the rifle fire
rather than an ambulance driver in
shrapnel lire. Shrapnel makes such a
nasty, jagged wound. Our cars are full
of holes. One car in particular was
shrapneled so badly that pieces of shell
went directly through the differential
housing, which is cast iron. Others
went through the metal dust cap which
screws over the valve stem. The body
was broken and spokes cut like matches.
The concussion burst all the tires and
stones and dirt nearly buried it."
