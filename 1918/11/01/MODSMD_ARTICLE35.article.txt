Ten Palu Alto women have organized
a motor corps nnder the supervision of
Miss A. Somers. These women have
given their machines to the use of
carrying people to and from hospitals,
going after salvage and being helpful
in a general way.

women to organize a motor corps here,
because it takes too much time; how
ever, if enough campus women are in
terested in that work they will be per
mitted to substitute on the Palo Alto
divisio nand take charge of the salvage
here. Further information in regard
|to the motor corps can be had from

be in the Women's Club House Mon
