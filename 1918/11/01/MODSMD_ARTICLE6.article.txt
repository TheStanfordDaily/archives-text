# FRATERNITY MEN TO TALK OVER AFFAIRS TONIGHT
## 
### 
Dean of Men J. E. McDowell has
called a meeting of all the fraternity
men on the campus, including those men
in the S. A. T. C., for 7 :30 tonight in
Room 12, Law building. This meeting
is to discuss orders received recently
regarding fraternities by Mr. McDow
ell from the Committee on Education.
These orders follow below.
War Department
Committee on Education and Special
Training.
Washington, October 16, 1918.
I. College Life and College Fraterni
ties.
1. The war has vitall yaffected the
college life of the country. To pro
vide that the •country will not want for
trained and educated men during the
war and in the period of reconstruction
thereafter, the colleges of the country

were invited to co-operate with the War
Department in training for positions of
leadership in the army, the student sol
diers assigned to them. The Students'
Army Training Corps has therefore
been established. Under the plan for
the Students' Army Training Corps it
is evident that the student personnel of
collegiate institutions having a unit of
the corps will, for the period of the
present emergency, consist almost en
tirely of members of said corps. The
plan contemplates that members of this
corps who were twenty years of age
when they registered will remain at
the institutions at which enrolled about
three months; those who were nineteen
about six months; those who were
eighteen about nine months; and that
new increments will be provided to fill
the vacancies as they occur, thus as
suring, by reason of a ocntinually
shifting personnel, the greatest good to
the greatest number and the prompt
supply of trained men when needed. As
the members of the Students' Army
Training Corps will occupy the status
of soldiers on active duty, subject as
such to military discipline at all times
and quartered together in military bar
racks, the effect of the plan will be to
alter the whole character of the educa
tional institutions, to transform them
from colleges, in the meaning that word
has acquired—into an integral part of
the } military establishment. Whereas
heretofore college life was made up of
many different phases—educational, ath
letic, and social—it will now consis only
of intensive military and - academic
training.
Appreciating that fraternity activity
is an important factor in the collegiate
institutions of the country as they ex
ist today, and realizing that it will be
fundamentally affected by the new sys
tem of education and training the War
Department desires to make clear its
position in this regard. The War De
partment, considering that fraternity
activities and military discipline are in
compatible in the very nature of things,
feels that it is to the best interests of
the service that the operations of fra
ternities in institutions where units of
j the Students' Army Training Corps are
established be suspended for the period
of the present emergency. It further
feels that the best interests of the fra
ternities themselves require such sus
pension, considering that the continued
operation of the fraternities must re
sult, due to the rapidly changing per
sonnel and combined circumstances, in
a lowering of the high ideals as to mem
bership fraternities themselves, as well
as in heavy financial loss to them. By
"fraternity activities" and"the opera
tions of fraternities" as above used is
meant the social side of fraternity life
—the living of the members together
in fraternity houses and the functions
and meetings of a social or ceremonial
nature. Realizing, however, that fra
ternity organizations must be kept in
tact to insure the resumption of fra
ternity activities when the present emer
gency has passed, the War Department
interposes no objection to the holding
of such meetings as are a purely busi
ness character.
3. It is confidently felt by the War
Department that the fraternities will
realize the benefits to all concerned to
be derived from the suspension of their
activities in institutions in whose abil
ty the country has reposed its trust to
train its soldiers, and will show the
same spirit of loyalty and service in
the present emergency as has been
shown by the institutions themselves.
By direction of the Committee.
