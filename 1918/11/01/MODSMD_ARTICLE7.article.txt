# CHAPPIE TO APPEAR DEC. 1
## 
### 
Chaparral is to celebrate its twentieth
anniversary with an issue much larger
than ever before. This issue, which is
to appear about December 1, is to be
called the "Blame the Kaiser" number.
It will be the only issue this year.
Members of Hammer and Coffin who
will be responsible for the "Blame the
Kaiser" edition are "Les" Levy, '19, ed
itor; "Babe" Howes, '20, manager;
Eddie Randall, '20, and "Milt" Hagan,
'15. Four years ago Hagan was editor
of "Chappie" and wielded the traditional
hammer himself. One of the honors
that goes with the position of editor of
the Stanford comic is the right to put
one's initials on this hammer. There
are now twenty names on it.

George Kocher, '19, who is in charge
of the art work of this issue, announces
that it will surpass all previous efforts.
One of the special features of the
issue will be contributions from old
Hammer and Coffin men now in the
service, both in this country and over
seas. "Sam" Briggs, '19, last year's ed
itor, has written something for this issue
in his inimitable manner, as also have
"Dink" Dinkelspiel, '20, -and Sam Glik
barg, '19. From overseas there will come
the contributions of men who have writ
ten or drawn for "Chappie" during their
years at Stanford.
Due to the increased size of the
"Blame the Kaiser" edition, the manage
ment has been forced to raise the price
to 35 cents.
