# BIG GAME FOR THANKSGIVING
## Coach Announces Men From Whom Team Will be Chosen 
### 
The Cardinal will meet the Blue and
Gold in an American match on Thanks
giving Day, November the 28th, it was
announced today by the military au
thorities here after the exchange of
many communications between them
and the authorities at Berkeley. Last
night Lieutenant Badenoch sent a tele
gram to California giving them a choice
of two dates, the 7th and the 30th of
November, for the big game. Califor
nia today replied that she would be
willing to play American on Thanks
giving day. It has been announced that
Stanford has accepted this date and
that the match is final. The game will
be played at California. No return
match of Rugby has as yet been deter
mined upon.
The American team is fast coming
into shape and things seem to point to

a good eleven. On the ends Vaughn,
"Randy" Flood, Slater ,and Mangin are
showing speed; Nuss and Holt are play
ing well at quarter. In the line Allen
Hawley and Frank Watts are showing
exceptional bucking qualities. At cen
ter Kaigley is passing the ball. For
backs, Henry, Parker, Long, and Piatt
look like splendid material. These men
are now on the first squad and from
them will be chosen the eleven which
will meet California on the 28th.
One of the members of the Rugby
squad, Box, '22, of Cupertino, Cal., was
seriously hurt yesterday afternoon
while at practice, when he fractured
his leg. He was rushed to the hospital
by Dean McDowell and given treat
ment there. His injury will probably
keep him out of college for the rest of
the quarter.
The significance of the match with
U. C. is plain. It is the first time that
Stanford has played American football
in eight years and it is the first time
in four that there has been any game
between the two colleges.
Coach Badenoch has been practicing
hard with the men for over a week
now and is trying to make them hold
on to the ball when they are tackled
instead of getting rid of it as they used
to do in Rugby.
It was announced late this afternoon
that Dolly, famous football star, has
returned from his furlough and is
showing up well at half-back. As this
position has been very weak, Coach
Badenoch is cheered by his return.
It is also announced that rallies are
being held by the S. A. T. C. men in
preparation for the California game and
that the University song book will be
out in a short time.

Badenoch is cheered by his return.
It is also announced that rallies are
being held by the S. A. T. C. men in
preparation for the California game and
that the University song book will be
out in a short time.
The Cardinal will meet the Blue and
Gold in an American match on Thanks
giving Day, November the 28th, it was
announced today by the military au
thorities here after the exchange of
many communications between them
and the authorities at Berkeley. Last
night Lieutenant Badenoch sent a tele
gram to California giving them a choice
of two dates, the 7th and the 30th of
November, for the big game. Califor
nia today replied that she would be
willing to play American on Thanks
giving day. It has been announced that
Stanford has accepted this date and
that the match is final. The game will
be played at California. No return
match of Rugby has as yet been deter
mined upon.
The American team is fast coming
into shape and things seem to point to

a good eleven. On the ends Vaughn,
"Randy" Flood, Slater ,and Mangin are
showing speed; Nuss and Holt are play
ing well at quarter. In the line Allen
Hawley and Frank Watts are showing
exceptional bucking qualities. At cen
ter Kaigley is passing the ball. For
backs, Henry, Parker, Long, and Piatt
look like splendid material. These men
are now on the first squad and from
them will be chosen the eleven which
will meet California on the 28th.
One of the members of the Rugby
squad, Box, '22, of Cupertino, Cal., was
seriously hurt yesterday afternoon
while at practice, when he fractured
his leg. He was rushed to the hospital
by Dean McDowell and given treat
ment there. His injury will probably
keep him out of college for the rest of
the quarter.
The significance of the match with
U. C. is plain. It is the first time that
Stanford has played American football
in eight years and it is the first time
in four that there has been any game
between the two colleges.
Coach Badenoch has been practicing
hard with the men for over a week
now and is trying to make them hold
on to the ball when they are tackled
instead of getting rid of it as they used
to do in Rugby.
It was announced late this afternoon
that Dolly, famous football star, has
returned from his furlough and is
showing up well at half-back. As this
position has been very weak, Coach
Badenoch is cheered by his return.
