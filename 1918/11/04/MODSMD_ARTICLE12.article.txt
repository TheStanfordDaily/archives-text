# CALIFORNIA WILL HAVE CIVILIANS ON FOOTBALL TEAM
## EVEN SO, WE MEET All Rugby Practice Here to Be Suspended Until December 
### 
With the American football game all
completely settled for Thanksgiving a
new question has arisen between the
two universities concerned in regard to
the eligibility of students for the team.
Despite the fact that the Blue and
Gold squad has had a month's start of
Stanford's men 'in practice on the foot
ball field and had a nucleus around
which to build up her team long before
Stanford issued the call for players.
Stanford has agreed to play American
on the 28th.
California is now insisting that she
be allowed to draw on material not in
the S. A. T. C. As she has over a thou
sand men in that status this would
mean she would have one thousand men
more from which to select her eleven.
As an excuse she says it would make
the game more like old times. Captain
Parker's idea was to have the two S. A.
T. C. bodies meet as representatives of
the colleges, but in spite of California's
position the game will be played, Stan
ford S. A. T. C. versus the University
of California. California wired to
Colonel Rees of the War Department to
find out whether they might use their
non-military men and received an af
firmative reply. Captain Parker does
not wish the civilians here to play.
The men whom Coach Badenoch used
on the first team last Saturday and
their positions are given here:
Flood, r. e.; Slater, 1. e.; Henry,1. h.
b.; Nuss, r. h. b.; Parker, 112. b.; Kaigler,
c.; F. Watts, r. t.; Hanna, 1. t.; Gunn,
1. g.; J. Watts, r. g.; Holt, q. b..
Dolly, who has returned from his fur
lough. is showing up well. He played
last Saturday with the second squad at
half-back, as Coach Badenoch is work
ing him in slowly. Dolly comes from
tlie University of Southern California
and should prove a valuable asset to the
team.
It was announced today that all
Rugby practice will be discontinued un
til December, and all efforts will be
centered in turning out a crack eleven.

centered in turning out a crack eleven.
With the American football game all
completely settled for Thanksgiving a
new question has arisen between the
two universities concerned in regard to
the eligibility of students for the team.
Despite the fact that the Blue and
Gold squad has had a month's start of
Stanford's men 'in practice on the foot
ball field and had a nucleus around
which to build up her team long before
Stanford issued the call for players.
Stanford has agreed to play American
on the 28th.
California is now insisting that she
be allowed to draw on material not in
the S. A. T. C. As she has over a thou
sand men in that status this would
mean she would have one thousand men
more from which to select her eleven.
As an excuse she says it would make
the game more like old times. Captain
Parker's idea was to have the two S. A.
T. C. bodies meet as representatives of
the colleges, but in spite of California's
position the game will be played, Stan
ford S. A. T. C. versus the University
of California. California wired to
Colonel Rees of the War Department to
find out whether they might use their
non-military men and received an af
firmative reply. Captain Parker does
not wish the civilians here to play.
The men whom Coach Badenoch used
on the first team last Saturday and
their positions are given here:
Flood, r. e.; Slater, 1. e.; Henry,1. h.
b.; Nuss, r. h. b.; Parker, 112. b.; Kaigler,
c.; F. Watts, r. t.; Hanna, 1. t.; Gunn,
1. g.; J. Watts, r. g.; Holt, q. b..
Dolly, who has returned from his fur
lough. is showing up well. He played
last Saturday with the second squad at
half-back, as Coach Badenoch is work
ing him in slowly. Dolly comes from
tlie University of Southern California
and should prove a valuable asset to the
team.
It was announced today that all
Rugby practice will be discontinued un
til December, and all efforts will be
centered in turning out a crack eleven.
