# NATIONAL ELECTION
## 
### 
In the most momentous autumn in the history of the world, it is but natural
that the usual interest in the national and state elections should he lacking. How
ever, the results of the Congressional election tomorrow will probably have a
profound influence on the future history of the United States, and any voter
who neglects his duty through being too absorbed in the war news to bother
about it, is at best a questionable patriot.
The issue of the present election are somewhat confused, but in general it
may be said that the choice is between President Wilson and his views for prog
ress in the idea of international co-operation and conciliation, and the adherents
of ex-President Roosevelt and Senator Loodge, who advocate aggressive national
ism and the continuance of a large military establishment after the war.
In California we are electing a Governor, and are to select either Governor
Stephens, Republican, or Theodore Bell, Democrat-Independent. The only ap
parent issue between the two is that Governor Stephens is in favor of prohibition
and Mr. Bell is not. As the Governor has nothing in particular to do witli the
adoption of prohibition, which must be voted upon at a constitutional election,
which is also up for ratification-tomorrow, the choice for governorship is largely
between personalities.
