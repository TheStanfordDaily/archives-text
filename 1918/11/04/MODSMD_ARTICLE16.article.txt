The campus does not seem to be alive to the fact that the biggest athletic
year in the history of the University is about to start. The game with Cali
fornia to be held Thanksgiving Day seems to be definitely settled, despite the
difference in the athletic policies of the two universities. In this regard we should
be chary of our criticisms of the Blue and Gold. That institution is regarding
the athletic teams as representing the whole university, while at Stanford they
represent merely the S. A. T. C„ However, as the S. A. T. C. is the biggest part
of the University, this is no reason why there should be lacking any part of
the old Stanford fighting spirit.
The men out on the field every afternoon are fully awake to the situation,
but the rest of the student body to be asleep. With the Mather Field
game less than two weeks away, and the big game but three and a half, no rallies
have been held, and no Stanford yell leader elected. This officer is the most
important individual at a football game outside of the team itself. An eleven
without a section of vociferous backers in the bleachers is sadly handicapped,
and a rooting section without organization is of little value. Song books will
shortly be issued by the student body, but even before they come out, the new
men particularly should be making an effort to learn the old Stanford yells and
fighting songs.
Doubtless some arrangement could be made in the S. A. T. C. for the
election of a yell leader, and opportunities for practice, for that official, should by
all means be an S. A. T. C. member. The organization by companies adapts
itself readily to an organized rooting section.
The Cardinal is handicapped already by lack of experience in the American
game, shorter time for practice, and differences in eligibility rules. We've got
the stuff to overcome this handicap if the student body will wake up and do
its part.
