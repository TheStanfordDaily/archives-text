# Professor Green Drive Treasurer
## Plans for Canvassing All University Elements Are Compiled 
### 
Professor R. L. Green was elected
treasurer of the funds to he collected
in the coming United War Work drive
from November 11 to 14 at a meet
ing of the executive committee last Fri
day afternoon. Plans were formulated
for a luncheon for the speakers and
those actively engaged in the war drive
plans much the same as that which was
given at the opening of the Friendship
I-und drive of last year. Mrs. Ralph
McGee .secretary for the Y. W. C. A.,
were putin charge of the luncheon.
Professor Green handled the funds
which were collected last year and this
past experience assures a systematic and
efficient arrangement for the collection
and handling of the money this year.
Professor Green plans to have pledge
cards which will allow pledges for this
campaign to be paid on the installment
plan up to the first of March, 1919.
Dean C. E. Huston of the Law
School presented plans for the actual
canvassing of the campus. The mil
itary organization of the S. A. T. C.
will be used to reach the men in the
University if possible, as was done in
the Liberty Loan drive. Those men
not connected with the S. A. T. C.
will be reached through a personal ap
peal.
The women of the University will be
asked to volunteer pledges through the
same organization as was used last
year. Speakers are to be arranged for
to visit all of the living groups on the
campus and it is hoped that one or two
special assemblies for women will be
arranged for to bring home the
women's aspect of war work.
An entirely different organization will
be used to reach the faculty and the
people living on the campus. Plans for
this work will be worked out under the
direction of Dean Huston and a com
mittee taken from the faculty.
No definite quota has been placed on
the campus as yet and on account of
the conditions to be met in a college
community where most of the students
are on limited allowances it is thought
that there may be no quota given. In
speaking of the matter Dean Huston
said: "No specific quota may be
placed on the campus, but we have a
standard which we have set for our
selves in the drive of last year. From
$12,000 to $15,000 is our goal and as
much more of course as is possible."

direction of Dean Huston and a com
mittee taken from the faculty.
No definite quota has been placed on
the campus as yet and on account of
the conditions to be met in a college
community where most of the students
are on limited allowances it is thought
that there may be no quota given. In
speaking of the matter Dean Huston
said: "No specific quota may be
placed on the campus, but we have a
standard which we have set for our
selves in the drive of last year. From
$12,000 to $15,000 is our goal and as
much more of course as is possible."
Professor R. L. Green was elected
treasurer of the funds to he collected
in the coming United War Work drive
from November 11 to 14 at a meet
ing of the executive committee last Fri
day afternoon. Plans were formulated
for a luncheon for the speakers and
those actively engaged in the war drive
plans much the same as that which was
given at the opening of the Friendship
I-und drive of last year. Mrs. Ralph
McGee .secretary for the Y. W. C. A.,
were putin charge of the luncheon.
Professor Green handled the funds
which were collected last year and this
past experience assures a systematic and
efficient arrangement for the collection
and handling of the money this year.
Professor Green plans to have pledge
cards which will allow pledges for this
campaign to be paid on the installment
plan up to the first of March, 1919.
Dean C. E. Huston of the Law
School presented plans for the actual
canvassing of the campus. The mil
itary organization of the S. A. T. C.
will be used to reach the men in the
University if possible, as was done in
the Liberty Loan drive. Those men
not connected with the S. A. T. C.
will be reached through a personal ap
peal.
The women of the University will be
asked to volunteer pledges through the
same organization as was used last
year. Speakers are to be arranged for
to visit all of the living groups on the
campus and it is hoped that one or two
special assemblies for women will be
arranged for to bring home the
women's aspect of war work.
An entirely different organization will
be used to reach the faculty and the
people living on the campus. Plans for
this work will be worked out under the
direction of Dean Huston and a com
mittee taken from the faculty.
