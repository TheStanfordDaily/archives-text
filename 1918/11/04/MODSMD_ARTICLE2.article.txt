# Major Wing Made Lieutenant Colonel
## Former Professor Now in France With Regiment of 23d Engineers 
### 
The news has just reached the campus
that Major Chas. B. Wing, professor of
structural engineering at Stanford Uni
versity and now serving with his regi
ment, the 23d Engineers, in France,
has been promoted to the lieutenant
colonelcy of the regiment. It appears
from the comments made in the High
wayman, the official journal of the 23d
Engineers, which comments are quoted
farther on, that the same qualities which
made Professor Wing one of the most
beloved and successful teachers in the
Department of Civil Engineering have
endeared him to officers and men alike
of his regiment. Character, ability, de
votion to duty and unselfishness have
been recognized in his deserved promo
tion. The Highwayman comments as
follows:
"When Colonel Johnston was casting
about for fit material for the best regi
ment on earth, he saw our Major Wing
toting a pack like a comman man of the
ranks, and knowing that character and
not frills and furbelows went into that
lowly 'travail,' he said, 'I want that man
for my regiment' and got him. And now
a year after Colonel Johnston got him
'for the regiment,' Major Wing is next
door to having that regiment. For this
week, with the promotion of Colonel
Kerr, the major's gold leaves have
turned to silver and the erstwhile major
is now Lieutenant-Colonel Charles R.
Wing."
