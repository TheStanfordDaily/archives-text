# LIEUT. W. B. JENNEY WRITES ABOUT HIS WAR EXPERIENCES
## 
### 
Word has been received from Lieu
tenant W. S. B. Jenney, ex-'lB, telling of
his first personal experience of Hun
tacticsti as follows:
"After crossing the Channel we spent
another night in a rest camp at a French
port and entrained on a toy French
train. The men were in "Homines 3c,
cheveaux B,' while we were in second
class carriage?* The first right, our
train was telescopcd from ti e rear and
eight cars smashed to splint rs. 1 never
expect to see such a sight again, and I
am sure I never want to. All five of the
cars our company was in were wrecked
and we lost twenty killed and fifty-six
wounded. They were the finest bunch
of boys in the land, and didn't even get
a chance to fight. Quite a number are
back from the hospital now, but some
will never return to us.
"The French and Belgian people in a
little village near where the wreck oc
curred gave the dead a wonderful burial
and each grave is being taken care of
by a family in the town. These French
people can't do enough for us and they
certainly do like the Americans."
