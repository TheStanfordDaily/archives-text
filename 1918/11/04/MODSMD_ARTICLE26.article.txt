# GEORGE M. KYLE, EX-'18 FLIES ON FRENCH FRONT
## 
### 
First Untenant George Marion Kyle,
ex-'lB, has been a year in the French air
service, eight months of which were
spent at the front, where he was en
gaged in bombarding and "infantry
strafing," as the British say. This means
flying low and shelling marching col
umns of troops. One exploit in which
the young Stanford officer participated
was when he and five other flyers sud
denly pounced on an artillery regiment
camped in a field and scattered it to the
four winds, killing men and horses or
causing them to rush off.
Kyle went overseas with the Stanford
University unit of the American field
service in February, 1917, later trans
ferring to the French air service. He
recently left for the United States on a
service mission, according to the Field
Service Bulletin of the American field
service, a Paris publication, dated Sep
tember 28.
