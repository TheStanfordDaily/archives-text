The Founding of Stanford
The deep grief of Senator and Mrs.
Stanford for their son found a fitting
and beautiful expression in the creation
of Leland Stanford Junior University,
ft was but natural that they should turn
to this idea, for the establishment of a
school "which might be especially for the
training of California boys and girls"
had been one of young Leland's childish
ambitions. "Henceforth," said Senator
Stanford, "the children of California
shall be our children."
Senator Stanford's own ideas of free
dom and democracy led him to preserve
in the founding the basic principles of
individuality for those who would at
tend.
"The winds of freedom are blowing,"
was his favorite motto, and he believed
firmly that a generous education should
be the birthright of every man and
woman in America. His earnestness and
frankness characterize his every effort

in building Stanford. He and Mrs.
Stanford visited the great universities
in Europe and consulted with the best
minds of the age in securing plans.
It was not small task to transfer thirty
millions of dollars intact to a board of
trustees in a way to insure for all time
a use for its given purpose. Here Sen
ator Stanford's experience as a gifted
lawyer is shown. He himself drew up
the act which was passed through the
California legislature in 1885, permitting
the building of a university. On the
10th of November of the same year the
grant was duly approved and signed in
the library of the Stanford home at San
Francisco, by Senator and Mrs. Stanford
and the majority of the twenty-four
trustees.
Stanford University, as a memorial, is
unique in every way, from the immens
ity of the endowment, which was turned
over in person by the givers, down to
the use of the architecture of the early
Spanish days.
