# Bookstore Announces Arrival of New Book
## 
### 
I he bookstore announces that Smith's
"Industrial Management" has arrived.
The price is $2.60.
On account of delay in transportation,
hooks ordered several months ago have
not arrived. S. A. T. C. men all over
the country are using the same books
and the demand has been greater than
could he supplied. Influenza and gen
eral business conditions are responsible
for late deliveries.
