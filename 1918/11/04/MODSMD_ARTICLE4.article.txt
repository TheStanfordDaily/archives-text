# CAMPUS DANCE TO BE GIVEN SATURDAY AT ENCINA HALL
## 
### 
The first campus dance of the year
will be given at Encina Hall next Satur
day night. It is to be an entertainment
in honor of the S. A. T. C. men. Men
in uniform will be especially honored
guests, and all students are invited to
come and pay their respects to the S. A.
T. C.
It has an added attraction in the fact
that the dance will be the first big social
gathering since the partial quarantine
has been lifted, and it is anticipated by
the committee in charge that there will
be many couples who will be glad to
once more set their feet moving to the
rhythm of a banjo, a piano, a drum and
a few tin pans.
Tickets will be 011 sale at the Stan
ford Bookstore tomorrow. The price of
admission will be only 75 cents plus the
war tax, instead of the usual dollar a
couple.
