# Weekly Fire is But a Weak Affair
## 
### 
The weekly campus fire was staged
yesterday evening at the Kappa Alpha
house building, now famous as the
stamping ground of the Lasucn Eating
Club. An unruly oilstove was the cause
of the conflagration, which did not live
up to the standard of former fires on
the Row. as the damage was princi
pally confined to one room, and no
chance for rescues were offered. A
touch of real comedy was added, how
eve/, by one humorous visiting hero
from a dormitory who playfully sprayed
the audience gathered in the front yard
with chemicals, with the intention,
doubtless, of producing unique effects
in the garment line after the chemicals
had done their work.
