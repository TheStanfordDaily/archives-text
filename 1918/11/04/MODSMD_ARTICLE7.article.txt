# FRATERNITIES ARE NOT TO INITIATE, SAYS M'DOWELL
## PARKER WILL NOT WIRE University Ruling is Made Against Institutions by Fraternities 
### 
Dean McDowell today announced in
an interview with a Daily Palo Alto
reporter that by ruling of Capt. S. M.
Parker and President Wilbur, no fra
ternities would be allowed to initiate.
This follows the declination of Captain
Parker to telegraph to Washington for
specific instructions as regarding initia
tion. A final and definite interpretation
of the recent orders of the Committee
on Education, to the effect that fraterni
ties at Stanford could not initiate, has
been made by Captain Parker, according
to Mr. McDowell.
This interpretation differs from that
of the national inter-fraternity confer
ence, which holds that the ruling of the
War Department does not intend to ab
solutely prohibit fraternity initiations.
At noon today no ruling against fra
ternities had been made at the Uni
versity of California.
All this action follows upon the inter
fraternity meeting held last Friday night.
At this meeting Dean McDowell read
the instructions of the Committee on
Education regarding fraternities. These
instructions prohibit ceremonious meet
ings but allowed such meetings as were
necessary to further the life of the fra
ternity system, such as business meet
ings. Captain Parker interpreted these
orders to mean that fraternities could
not initiate.
W. E. Redwine, '18, Delta Chi, was
made chairman, and a committee of
three was appointed to ask Ciptain Par
ker to wire to Washington for specific
instructions regarding initiations. The
committee was composed of C. Hunter,
'17, Theta Delta Chi; F. Watts, '19,
Theta Xi; R. Flood. '18. Phi Delta
Theta. The fraternities agreed not to
initiate until Captain Parker had wired
and received an answer from Washing
ton.
Greek letter sentiment today was that
the Stanford fraternities would not let
the issue of initiations drop at present
and that some effort would be made to
have the University authorities recon
sider their action.
