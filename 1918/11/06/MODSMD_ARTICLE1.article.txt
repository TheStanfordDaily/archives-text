of those out fo rthe team has been j
grouped together and will tackle the 1

Negotiations are in process lor a bat- j
tie with the sailors at Mare Island. If i
the plans mature the struggle is to he |
held here on Saturday afternoon. The j
game played will be American. Up to I
the time of going to press no answer
to the challenge had been received.
Yesterday a challenge for Saturday j
was received from the marines to play
American on Saturday at Recreation
Park in San Francisco, but owing* to
the prospect of a game with Mare
Island it seemed impossible to play
them.
Plans for the forming of a second
team in American football among the
civilian members of the University to
play the first team in practice are On
foot. It is hoped that a large number
will turn out for it. Several games may I
be played by this team with other col-1
leges. On this team Shl« udemau. Lill\ |
and other men excluded from the first |
team because of their non-membership j
in the S. A. T. C. will probably play.
Another scrimmage is to be held j
this afternoon on the football field !
at the practice. The fastest eleven
of those out fo rthe team has been j
grouped together and will tackle the 1
second half of the squad this after-1
noon. If the scrimmage is anything j
like the one which was held last j
Saturday it will prove an interesting ■
one to watch. Those who will prob
ably make up the first squad this af-'
ternoon are: Flood, r. e., Slater. 1. e.. j
Henry,1. h. b.. Nuss, r. h. b., Parker. I
