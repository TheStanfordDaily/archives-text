# ELECTION OF YELL LEADERS TO TAKE PLACE NEXT WEEK
## NOVEMBER 13 IS DATE Lieutenant Erskine States That Students Will Do Balloting 
### 
Wednesday, November 13, has been
set as the date for the election of a
S. A. T. C. yell leader. The action
was taken following a conference be
tween the Daily Palo Alto and Cap
tain Parker.
Nominations will be made through
the columns of the Daily Palo Alto,
according to Lieutenant Erskine, who
has been placed in charge of the elec
tion, and only S. A. T. C. men will be
allowed to participate in the voting
Details regarding the number of as
sistants and the question of whether
they shall be elected or appointed by
the chief yell leader will be arranged
later.
In former years the yell leaders
were selected after a strenuous ae
ries of tryouts. This year's selection
will be a much less elaborate affair
j and because of this it will be necea-
I sary to have only men of recognized
ability nominated. The students who
have been agitating the election of a
yell leader for some time, say that the
position will be doubly important this
year on account of the resumption of
I a big game with U. C.
