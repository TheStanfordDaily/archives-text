# THE 						QUAD
## 
### 
The Stanford year-book put out by each Junior Class is almost as old a
Cardinal institution as the sandstone quadrangle from which it derives its name,
and no event is more settled in Stanford life than its annual publication. Now
the class of 1920. upon which falls the responsibility for its appearance has
decided that the Quad must be published, despite the rumpus over in Germany.
To put out any sort of a college publication this year is a difficult undertaking,
as can be vouched for by the Daily Palo Alto, but in the case of an expensive
volume, which by tradition must live up to a very high standard of publication
and editing, the mere thought of putting it out would daunt most ordinary
mortals.
But the present Junior Class is fortunate in having as editor and manager of
the Quad the persons who now occupy those offices. They have announced that
a Quad will be published, and if the class is behind them a volume in keeping
with junior traditions. But the unanimous support of the class and the Uni
versity at large is necessary, for there are not the usual facilities for publication,
nor the material to work with, and costs have gone up radically. Junior dues
must be paid at once, and pledges for the book, and many of them, must be
signed immediately.
Let's get behind the Quad and make the book a success this year!
