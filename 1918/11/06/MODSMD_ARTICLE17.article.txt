Mildred Maurer. '21. Miss Beatrice

The absence of Miss Estelle Nis
son, who is now doing government
work In Washington, is deeply re
gretted by all swimming enthusiasts.
Miss Nisson was especially promi
nent in athletics and it was largely
due to her ability that the Chi Omega
house scored the highest number of
points last year.
A large crowd is expected to ap
pear at Roble Swimming Pool for this
meet on November 20. and owing to

the fact that it is the only one to be
held this quarter, particular enthusi
asm and ability will no doube be dis
played.
