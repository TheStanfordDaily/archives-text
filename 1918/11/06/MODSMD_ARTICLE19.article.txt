## Lyrics Written by Milton Hagen, '15, Published in This Issue 
### 
Milt Hagen. editor of Chappie in 1015,
has written a song for the S. A. T. C.
to chant during its spare moments.
Hagen is hack at Stanford and is in
the S. A. T. C. working in the per
sonnel office as athletic publicity man in
that department. The song has :i good
swing to it and humorous lines which
have caused it to be taken up bv Com
pany A, to which he belongs.
Undoubtedly 't will be taken up and
sung as lustily by the members of the
other companies, as Milt says he wrote
it just for the S. A. T. C." The words
of the song are given below :
I'm in the Army (Navy) Now, Gents
By Milt Hagen
(Written especially for the S. A. T. C
by request.)
I
I've got the gun of a Bolsheveek*
1 shine my shoes like any Greek,
United States is what 1 speak—
I m in the army now.
You ought to see my sunburned beak;
Oh, Hades !t How my joints all creak!
My back is weak ! 1 want to shriek—
I'm in the army now.
(Chorus)
I'm in the army now. gents—
I'm in the army now;
Upon my back I tote a pack
As heavy as a cow.
I'm going to be in gay Paree
And meet the girlies, WOW '
For I'm in the army now, gents—
I'm in the army now!
II
I'd like be an Arab shiek
In sunny Asia for a week.
Where all the maidens fair I'd seek—
But I'm in the army now.
My hob-nail Billies, how they leak
And make me cuss an azure streak—
But this is the ONLY life, old Geek—
I'm in the army now.
( Chorus : Same as before except the
fifth and sixth lines, which are) :
I'd like to wrap the stingy chap
Who serves us with the chow.
But I'm in. etc.
