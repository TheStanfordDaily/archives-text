# APPEAL IS MADE FOR MAGAZINES
## 
### 
\ letter of appeal to the Stanford
students and faculty lias been
received from Miss Edith Mirri
elees, former instructor in the Eng
lish department. Miss Mirrielees went j
to France as a member of the Stan-j
ford women's unit and is now serving
overseas in the capacity of a casualty
searcher. She writes:
"Now and then, when you or any
body of kindly nature has finished read
ing a magazine, whether it is the Sat
urday Evening Post or the Scientific
American, put a wrapper and stamp on
it and address it to me at B. H. 115.

A. P. O. 781 Not every one will ar
rive, but every one that does will be
read into rags."
Miss Mirrielees realizes how vital it
is that our soldiers have sufficient read
ing material to foster and nourish their
true American spirit and morale. It
seems but a very little matter for every
Stanford student to send at least one
magazine to the front every month or
once in two months; if the people on
this side can help "our boys" by a very
little exertion', it behooves them to
scour around and hunt up old maga
zines if new ones are not to be had.
