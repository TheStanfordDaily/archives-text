## DAVID STARR JORDAN 
### 
Chancellor David Starr Jordan,
Stanford University's first president,
will always be dear to California men
and women, as the man who is most
typical of the spirit of western educa
tion. Stanford owed the fame of her
name directly to him, for it was Dr.
Jordan who carried out and infused
for all time the broad anil democratic
principles of Senator and Mrs. Stan
lord. Rugged and direct with a touch,
firm and unwavering, his work is just
what he has made it. a path always to
higher things.
The name of Dr. Jordan, then head
of the University of Indiana, was al
ready becoming well known in the fields
of education and science when Senator
Stanford turned to the task of chosing
a president. As was characteristic of
his thorough methods, the Senator went
directly to Dr. Jordan for a personal
interview. Here each discovered that
he was wholly in sympathy with the
other's ideals and plans of education.
"Stanford University," said I )r. Jor
dan, "will not be one of the largest
universities, but one of the most in
tense. It will be an institution in which
exceptional men and women will find

exceptional opportunities. It will not
undertake all kinds of work, hut it will
guarantee that what it does will be done
by the best men in the best way."
"It will be a democratic institution
as befits one with a serious purpose.
Ihe ideals of its founding will guide
its future."
In selecting the first faculty, Dr. Jor
dan adhered to a fundamental principle.
He chose young men who gave rich
promise of fruitful scholastic lives and
who had their names yet to make mi
the world of science and letters. Thus
a strong intellectual tradition for Stan
for was insured. The faculty has at all
'times ranked high and the-carrying out
; of this principle has greatly benefited
j the University.
Many names on the list of the llrst
faculty are familiar to the present cam
pus community. That of Fernando
Sanford, Charles D. Marx, Charles ii 1
Gilbert, Owin Leslie Elliott are at pres
ent well known faculty members. Dr.
J. C. Branner. former president of the
University. Oliver P. Jenkins, Dr J. M
Stillman and Jame O. Griffin, all re
cently retired, are each prominent in
the early growth and later development
of Stanford.

Chancellor David Starr Jordan,
Stanford University's first president,
will always be dear to California men
and women, as the man who is most
typical of the spirit of western educa
tion. Stanford owed the fame of her
name directly to him, for it was Dr.
Jordan who carried out and infused
for all time the broad anil democratic
principles of Senator and Mrs. Stan
lord. Rugged and direct with a touch,
firm and unwavering, his work is just
what he has made it. a path always to
higher things.
The name of Dr. Jordan, then head
of the University of Indiana, was al
ready becoming well known in the fields
of education and science when Senator
Stanford turned to the task of chosing
a president. As was characteristic of
his thorough methods, the Senator went
directly to Dr. Jordan for a personal
interview. Here each discovered that
he was wholly in sympathy with the
other's ideals and plans of education.
"Stanford University," said I )r. Jor
dan, "will not be one of the largest
universities, but one of the most in
tense. It will be an institution in which
exceptional men and women will find

exceptional opportunities. It will not
undertake all kinds of work, hut it will
guarantee that what it does will be done
by the best men in the best way."
"It will be a democratic institution
as befits one with a serious purpose.
Ihe ideals of its founding will guide
its future."
In selecting the first faculty, Dr. Jor
dan adhered to a fundamental principle.
He chose young men who gave rich
promise of fruitful scholastic lives and
who had their names yet to make mi
the world of science and letters. Thus
a strong intellectual tradition for Stan
for was insured. The faculty has at all
'times ranked high and the-carrying out
; of this principle has greatly benefited
j the University.

pus community. That of Fernando
Sanford, Charles D. Marx, Charles ii 1
