## S.A.T.C. INFORMATION Stanford Suffered Lightly From Influenza, Says President Wilbur 
### 
President Wilbur, who returned
this week from Kansas City, where
the conference of representatives
from the western S. A. T. C. dis
tricts was held for two days, reports
that plans for the remainder of the
college year were worked ot at this
meeting. Many problems which arose
from the introduction of the S. A. T.
C'. into the universities and coleges
were settled iu such a way that the
work may be made uniform in the
various institutions.
"Now that the first few weeks of
disorder due to the necessity for
hasty arrangement of many unfore
seen details and the unexpected at
tacks of influenza have been passed,
the S. A. T. C. institutions will pro
ceed to lay the greatest stress upon
academic work," said Dr. Wilbur in
summing up. the discussions in the
conference. Academic courses and
the method of rating the men ready
to go to the officers' training camps
in their relation to each other were
taken up by the representatives.
Academic work will count more than
any other consideration in the rating
of men as candidates for officers."
After the conference Dr. Wilbur
went on to Washington, D. C., where
he consulted with Food Administra
tor Herbert Hoover. Dr. Wilbur re
ports that the Food Administration
lias now before it as great a task as
in conserving food and further
more, in case of peace terms, it will
have to meet with a much larger de
mand for food than at present.
"Should peace be granted," he
said, "we shall have to feed all of
the starving Balkan nations as well
as those we are now suplying with
food."
But although it is incumbent upon
the Food Administration to be pre
pared for the conditions which would
follow peace. Dr. Wilbur says that
the War Department is going ahead
with its plans of warfare as vigor
ously as ever and that it does not
consider any relaxation on the part
of the American forces, regardless
of the enemy's peace propaganda.
Hearing reports of the course the
influenza attack had taken at Stan
ford, Dr. Wilbur said that compared
fo many of the towns and cities
through which he passed, Stanford
lias been fortunate. He reported
that hf wiis satisfied *h;it. patients
had been well taken care of here and
that the death rate was extremely
low fit thr University as compared
to that in many communities in
which it has been often as high as
ten per cent of those taken sick.
