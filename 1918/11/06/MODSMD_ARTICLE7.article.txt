duration of the war. The building will

who are interested, and members of the
"500" are invited to attend.
All the rooms are in readiness for

donated. The various departments of
the war board will have their work on
exhibition and the salvage committee
will carry on an industrious campaign
in the room which has been given to
that work.
Members of the Senior War Board,
and the Junior War Board as well, will
be present to show visitors over the
building. At a meeting of the Senior

were assigned their duties which will
train them for further service later on
the Senior Board. They are requested
to report to the headquarters building
Friday afternoon to finish preparation
of the rooms for the evening.
Red Cross work which was to have
started on last Monday was delayed
until some time next week, due to the
lack of working material which has to
lie received from the Palo -\lto head
quarters. This auxiliary on the campus
is under the direction of the chapter
in Palo Alto and must wait for its
orders, so that the delay is in no way
due to those in charge here
When work is started the rooms will
Ibe open every afternoon from 2:30
until 5:30 and on Monday. Wednesday
j ind Thursday evenings from 7 :30 till 9.
