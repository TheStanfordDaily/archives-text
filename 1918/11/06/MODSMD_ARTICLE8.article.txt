# Tie-Up Postponed by Inoculations
## S.A.T.C. Men Receive Shot in the Arm to Prevent Danger of Typhoid 
### 
Because all the S. A. T. C. men have
been given a "shot in the arm" to pre
vent typhoid, the freshman-sophomore
tie-up will not come off tonight, and has
been postponed indefinitely. The com
panies will he "shot" with the serum
at least live times. Company A and
Company B have already been innocu
lated and Company C will he taken to
day. As most of the freshmen and
sophomores in the S. A. T. C. are in B
or C, there would be almost no men
except those in the dormitories, and
these are practically all freshmen. If
those who have been inoculated are
able the big fight will come on next
Wednesday. The scrimmage between
the Varsity and second football teams
will be played even though the tie-up
cannot be.
