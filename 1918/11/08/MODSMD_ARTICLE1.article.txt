The $300,000 for the library had been
willed to him by Senator Stanford. He

immediately turned it back for the pur

Thomas Welton Stanford turned tc
spiritualism years ago when his wife
died and for a time was one of the lead
ing disciples of the psychic cult in that
part of the world.
In early days Thomas Welton was a
merchant in California wi-h Senator
Stanford and X. T. Smith. They first
introduced the coal oil lamp and the
sewing machine on the coast. Thomas
Stanford went to Australia from here
to introduce those article-- in that coun
try. This was the first for- 'gn experi
ment of the old Stanford tirm of Sacra
mento. Stanford nearly died of sea
sickness going across tlie Pacific Ocean

could never be persuaded to board ;i
