# THE
						FIRST GAME
## 
### 
For the lirst time since the big break an American team will be seen in
action on the Stanford field. The men, nominally representing a military organ
ization, will, in every true sense of the word, be standard-bearers of the Cardinal.
They will confront a formidable aggregation, but the spirit that brought them
out for practice every day while almost everyone else was complaining about not
having enough time to eat and sleep, will overcome many obstacles.
Though circumstances will prevent the celebration which ought to commem
orate this event, there is no reason why the student body should not turn out
en masse for the team's initial baptism of fire.
