# PROBLEMS OF RETURNING PEACE
## 
### 
Reports of the capitulation of Germany naturally turn the current of our
thoughts from the events of the war to what is to come afterwards. How long
it will be before Stanford is back to a peace basis is impossible to predict It
took us a year and a half after war was declared to get on a real military foot
ing. and it is safe to say that it will be several months at the least before the
University begins to resemble what it was in the ante-bellum days..
But Stanford, like all other places, will never return to what it was before
the war began. The world has traveled too fast in the last two years for that.
Our horizon has been tremendously broadened, and things that seemed all im
portant then will appear trivial when we begin our university life anew Two
important local events.â€”the resumption of football relations with California and
the new freshman dormitory rule will in themselves make a big change in campus
life from what it was in 1916.
During the present emergency most of the old Stanford traditions have had
to be temporarily laid on the shelf. Before the boys come back is a good time
to take stock of ourselves an dour existence on the Farm; to discard whatever
is trivial or non-essential in our college life, and to keep whatever is worth pre
serving. Stanford, and Stanford men and women, have played an important
part'in the Great War; we should be prepared to play as important a part in
the period of reconstruction to come.
