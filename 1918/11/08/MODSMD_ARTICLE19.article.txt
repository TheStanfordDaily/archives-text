## Sends Circular Letter as Regional Director of Coast S.A.T.C. 
### 
New regulations for the S. A. T. C..
regarding academic work and admis
sion of new members have been is
sued by President Wilbur as Regional
Director of the Eleventh District.
The circular letter to the presidents
of the institutions having S. A. T. C.
units follows:
Importance of Academic Work
Dear Sir: Now that the first stages
of the organization of the S. A. T. C.
are practically completed and that
the influenza epidemic has subsided,
it is important for the heads of all
institutions where there are S. A. T.
('. units to emphasize the importance
of academic work. This responsibil
ity must necessarily fall upon the
lieud of the institution and must be
worked out in conjunction with the
commanding officer. Under the reg
ulations 42 hours are to be devoted to
academic work and 11 hours to mili
tary training. It will be necessary
for the president of the institution to
see that there is no undue encroach
ment upon academic time by the mil
itary authorities. Certain individual
exceptions will necessarily have to
be made in cases of emergency, but
no student shall have more than bis
share of military duties. It is also im
portant that athletics shall not inter
fere with academic work and shall be
confined to the free periods of the S.
A. T. C. students. Will you be kind
enough to let me know if there are
any difficulties in carrying out this
arrangement in your institution?
Admission of New Members
The Committee on Education and
Special Training has requested that
if possible all S. A. T. C. units be
filled to their authorized quotas. It
is not intended that the entrance re
quirements of the institution shall be
lowered nor standard of instruction
lowered, but it is hoped that many
students may be admitted who though
lacking technical requirements give
promise of ability to maintain the
work required. Such students may
be entered into the S. A. T. C. by
agreement between the commanding
officer and educational authorities of
the institution. It is at the option of
any institution whether such students
be registered as regular students, as
special students not candidates for a
degree, or listed as n. A. T. ( . stu
dents and not entered on- regular stu
dent rolls, provided, however, that
they are admitted to the necessary
«lasses and their class records pre
served. It is evident that students en
rolled in S. A. T. C. during the re
mainder of this term cannot be ex
pected to maintain full academic
work, but emphasis may be placed on
military instruction, while they are
admitted to such classes as they can
attend with benefit. Full hour sched
ule may be maintained by special mil
itary assignments in connection with
class and laboratory work.
Approval of Courses
The District Collegiate Director
will not insist on exactly 4J bouts
when individual reasons make it. im
practicable to work out a satisfactory
course. All such individual cases
should be separately reported to this
office with the reasons for a depar
ture from the rule.
Very truly yours,
R. L. WILBUR,
Regional Director.

no student shall have more than bis
share of military duties. It is also im
portant that athletics shall not inter
fere with academic work and shall be
confined to the free periods of the S.
A. T. C. students. Will you be kind
enough to let me know if there are
any difficulties in carrying out this
arrangement in your institution?
Admission of New Members
The Committee on Education and
Special Training has requested that
if possible all S. A. T. C. units be
filled to their authorized quotas. It
is not intended that the entrance re
quirements of the institution shall be
lowered nor standard of instruction
lowered, but it is hoped that many
students may be admitted who though
lacking technical requirements give
promise of ability to maintain the
work required. Such students may
be entered into the S. A. T. C. by
agreement between the commanding
officer and educational authorities of
the institution. It is at the option of
any institution whether such students
be registered as regular students, as
special students not candidates for a
degree, or listed as n. A. T. ( . stu
dents and not entered on- regular stu
dent rolls, provided, however, that
they are admitted to the necessary
«lasses and their class records pre
served. It is evident that students en
rolled in S. A. T. C. during the re
mainder of this term cannot be ex
pected to maintain full academic
work, but emphasis may be placed on
military instruction, while they are
admitted to such classes as they can
attend with benefit. Full hour sched
ule may be maintained by special mil
itary assignments in connection with
class and laboratory work.
Approval of Courses
The District Collegiate Director
will not insist on exactly 4J bouts
when individual reasons make it. im
practicable to work out a satisfactory
course. All such individual cases
should be separately reported to this
office with the reasons for a depar
ture from the rule.
Very truly yours,
R. L. WILBUR,
Regional Director.

Importance of Academic Work
Dear Sir: Now that the first stages
of the organization of the S. A. T. C.
are practically completed and that
the influenza epidemic has subsided,
it is important for the heads of all
institutions where there are S. A. T.
('. units to emphasize the importance
of academic work. This responsibil
ity must necessarily fall upon the
lieud of the institution and must be
worked out in conjunction with the
commanding officer. Under the reg
ulations 42 hours are to be devoted to
academic work and 11 hours to mili
tary training. It will be necessary
for the president of the institution to
see that there is no undue encroach
ment upon academic time by the mil
itary authorities. Certain individual
exceptions will necessarily have to
be made in cases of emergency, but
no student shall have more than bis
share of military duties. It is also im
portant that athletics shall not inter

A. T. C. students. Will you be kind
