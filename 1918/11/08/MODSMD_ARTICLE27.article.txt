# THE
						WAR--A WEEKLY REVIEW
## 
### Professor P. J. Treat 
The unconditional surrender of Aus
tria-Hungary, the formulation of the
armistice terms for Germany, and the
almost complete liberation of French
territory are the great events of a
memorable week.
Austria-Hungary opened direct nego
tiations with Italy on October 29,
when, under a flag of truce, an Austrian
captain entered the Italian lines and
sought to discuss the eterms of an arm
istice. He was sent back as not pos
sessing full powers. The next day
General von Weber, a corps command
er, and seven other officers appeared.
They were taken to the headquarters
of General Diaz on Thursday and there
stated their mission. The proposal was
submitted to the War Council at Ver
sailles and a speedy reply received, for
ihat evening one of the officers was on
his way back with the terms. The arm
istice was signed on the 3d, and hos
tilities ceased with the next afternoon
at :] o'clock. The terms of the armis
tice were designed to absolutely pre
vent any renewal of military opera
i ions on the part of the Dual Empire.
In addition to the total demobiliza
tion of the army, the surrender of half
the artillery and the effective units of
the fleet, and the evacuation not only
of allied territories but of a wide strip
of Austrian soil, the terms called for
tiie occupation by the allies of certain
strategic points in Austria and the
right of free movement over all the
road and rail and waterways in the em
pire and the use of the necessary
means of transportation. In comment
ing on the latter condition, a German
report assumed that this did not in
clude the right to use Austrian terri
tory for offensive operations against
Germany. But it seems clear that this
is exactly what the allies had in mind

â€”an attack upon Bavaria, through
Austria, if the war were prolonged.
The armistice terms ottered to Ger
many we v re formulated by the repre
sentatives of the allies in Paris, at in
formal and formal sessions. The lat
ter commenced on November 1, and
continued until the details were
agreed upon, and signed on the 4th. It
was decided that President Wilson
should notify the German government
that Marshal Focli was authorized to
communicate to properly accredited
representatives the terms of the arm
istice. And in making this announce
ment lie stated that the allies were
willing to make peace with Germany
on the terms laid down in his ad
dress, with two qualifications. They
reserved full freedom to discuss the
clause relating to the "freedom of the
seas," in the peace conference, and
they also made it clear that Germany
would have to make compensation for
all damage done to the civilian popu
lation of the allies and their property
hy (lie aggression of Germany by land,
by sea and from the air.
Marshal Koch promptly notified
Germany that plenipotentiaries would
be received, and stipulated exactly
how they should approach the allies'
lines. In asking for an appointment,
Germany expressed the hope that the
arrival of their delegation might bring
about a provisional suspension of hos
tilities. According to the latest re
ports. the German representatives
were expected to arrive at Foclrs
headquarters between 8 and 10 o'clock
in the evening of Thursday. However,
on Thursday morning the United Press
c irculated a dispatch to the effect that
the armistice had been signed at 11
n m. that day.and that hostilities
would cease at 2 p. m. This exhibition
of journalistic enterprise, reprehensi
ble in the extreme, was doubtless only

an anti-climax. That Germany will.
promptly accept the terms laid clown,
by the allies is, in my opinion, almost
a certainty.
All the talk of approaching peace i
has by 110 means weakened the blows
of the allies. The Italians continued!
their advance up to the very hour hos-j
tilities ceased, and thus were able to |
occupy Trent and Trieste, the two
cities of Italia Irredenta, while their
toll of prisoners finally reached UOO,-
000. On a seventy-five-mile front be
tween the Scheldt and the Mouse the
savage onslaughts of the British.
French and American armies forced
the (Germans back almost to tno fron
tier. During the week the British took
Valenciennes and Le Quesnoy, the
French took Guise ami crossed the
Aisne at Rethel, and the Americans,!
on Wednesday afternoon, took that
part of Sedan which lies west of the
Meuse. The splendid work of the two
American armies on the most difficult
sector of the whole front has been
generally recognized. Now they have
cut the main German lateral railway.'
Should the war continue, Germany will
try to hold the line of Metz, Mezieres,
Mauberge, but when this is broken the
invasion of Germany will begin. To
the north the line of Mezieres, Namur,
Antwerp marks her last stand. And
her lines of retirement are being con
gested between the southern frontier
of Holland and the Ardennes hills. It
is this military situation, in spite of
no little power of resistance whicn still
remains, which leads one to believe
that any terms of armistice will be
welcomed by what Lloyd George lias
called the "Imperial democratic'" gov
ernment.
In Austria-Hungary the organization
of the independent governments goes
011. German troops in Rumania are
about to retire, unarmed, througu Hun
gary. German sailors at Kiel and
other naval bases are reported to be
in full revolt. Germany has broken
diplomatic relations with the Bolshe
viki, her tools, and the latter have
sought peace negotiations with the

allies. But as the allies have never 1
I
recognized the Bolsheviki, the latter!
will have to deal with the All-Russian
government at Omsk.
