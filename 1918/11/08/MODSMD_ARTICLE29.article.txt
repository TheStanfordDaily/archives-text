I'lying lias Rugby football backed
off ilit.' map lor thrills and sensations,"
writes Jim Wylie, '16, Stanford's var
sity star and former coach from Camp
Borden, Canada.
'Words fail one in describing the
experiences one has handling a plane
aiming the cloudsâ€”in some flights you
can live a lifetime. Straight Hying loses
its sensation after the lirst High! or so
and the only tiling that relieves the mo
notonv of it is the wonderful view you
have of the surrounding country. Just
imagine being up 5000 feet and moving
along at the rate of sixty to seventv
miles an hour.
"1 have been through all the stunts
known to modern aviation with my in
structor. a veteran lieutenant from
I'ranee. Looped the loop, made rolls,
yooms. stall turns, whit stalls, and the
like until I have wondered jusi what
it is all about anyway."
Wylie expects to receive his commis
sion in about six weeks in the Royal
Air Force and is planning on being in
"old Mighty" by the lirst of the year.
