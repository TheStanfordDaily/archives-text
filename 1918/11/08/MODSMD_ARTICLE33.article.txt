## THE 						PIONEER CLASS 
### 
Zah—Zah—Zeer!
We're right here!
'95, 95,
Pioneer!"
I his is the famous yell composed by
the first class to complete a full four
years' course at Stanford. The pionee:
class of 1895 holds a unique position, for
its history is that of the early life of
the University. It was to them that fell
the task of setting precedents and tra
ditions.
"When in future years.' they wrote
in their first yearbook, "the questions
shall be asked, 'Who set the example of
burning the midnight tallow in En
ema?' "Who first decorated the tank?'
'he echo of the past will answer, "95'"
Among the 165 men and 52 women
who graduated in this first class, many
well known names are found, a few of
which are:
Food Dictator Herbert C. Hoover is
perhaps the most widely known mem
ber of his class today. He was the first
student to be enrolled in Enema Hall.

Charles K. Field, editor of the Sun
-et Magaine. was the class poet, writing
under the name of Carolus A irer.
Carl Thomas received here his first
training, which ha* placed him dean of
the engineering school at Johns Hop
kins University.
Susan Brown Bristol became assistant
ind later appointment secretary for the
University, holding the position until
1916.
\\ illiam W. Guth is president of Gou
cher College at Baltimore.
Archie B. Rice has become well
known in journalistic circles.
Benjamin O. Foster is a member of
the present University faculty.
| Edwin B. Copeland was appointed
j dean of the college of agriculture estab
lished by the United States at Los
; Banos in the Philippines.
With such men and women as these
it is not surprising- that 95 won a rep
utation that will live in th< memory of
. 11 Stanford students.
