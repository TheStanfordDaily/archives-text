# WAR BOARD ROOMS OPEN FOR INSPECTION
## 
### 
Red Cross rooms in the old Zeta Psi
house will open Monday of next wPek
from 2to 5. Miss Henrietta Dicky. '20.
announces that she will give out wool
during those hours for the making of
ten pairs of socks and twenty-five
sweaters which have been promised
from the Palo Alto chapter and must
be finished by the close of this month.
In addition to the knitting, considerable
time and effort will of necessity be ex
pended on the darning of sweaters and
the making of pneumonia packs for the
soldiers.
Monday will be the first day this
quarter that the Red Cross rooms have
been opened, and inasmuch as the Stan
ford women have not so far been called
upon for any war work, it is hoped
and expected that each one will now
feel a certain keen responsibility about
signing up for definite hours of Red
Cross work. The rooms are to be open
every day, beginning Monday, between
the hours of 2 to 5
