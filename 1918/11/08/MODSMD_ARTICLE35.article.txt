# Y.W.C.A. SUPPER WILL BE HELD ON TUESDAY
## 
### 
A good time and "good eats" are
promised to all those who attend the
V. W. C. A. supper to be given next
Tuesday afternoon from 5:45 to 7:15
in the Women's Club House.
The supper is being planned by the
Advisory Board of the Y. F. C. A., and
it is necessary for students to buy
their tickets as soon as possible in
order that the board may know how
many to prepare for. An entertaining
program has also been arranged for,
several mysterious stunts to be fol
lowed by a pianologue. In addition
(here will be a clever whistling solo,
given by a talented Chicago woman.
The entertainment will not interfere
with the evening Assembly at 7:30,
as there will be plenty of time to at
tend both.
