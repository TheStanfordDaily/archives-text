# STANFORD GREETS PEACE
## Midnight Parade, Band, Rouse Campus 
### 
Immediately following the news
thai the armistice had been accepted
by the German government, Captain
S. M. Parker issued orders that all
men of the S. A. T. C. report at once
to parade the campus and the streets
of Palo Alto at 1 o'clock this morning.
Up Salvatierra and down Lasuen the
men marched with a preciseness and
regularity which was a credit to any
military group of men. Most of the
entire student body soon,joined the
marching men and made their way to
I J al(. Alto.
The bells and whistles had called
thi- people of Palo Alto together in
the streets, where they were ready
and waiting to recfeive the S. A. T. C.
boys as they came marching down
Palm Drive with red lights swinging
and the band playing. Cheer after
cheer rang through the air as the
men took their places on University
avenue.

Then it was that Goodwin Knight,
'19. Wendell Kinney, '21, U. T. Rob
bins, '19, anil Alfred Johannsen, '19,
a-? yell leaders entered the scene.
Cheer after cheer was given for the
United States army and navy, Gen
eral Pershing, the Allies, and Stan
fort All of the yelling was sponta
neous and filled witli an enthusiasm
such as has not b een seen by the
men and women of Stanford even in j
the- days when the big games were atj
their height.
The demonstration closed appropri j
atelv with the singing of "The Star
Spangled Banner," when the solem
nity and significance of the close of
the world waif was most manifest .
To the high, sharp commands of
the officers the S. A. T. C. men then
maichen back to the campus before
being dismissed. The entire demon
stiation was unique in the history of
student and University life and will
be remembered as such.
