# OUTWEIGHED VARSITY CRUSHINGLY DEFEATED BY MARE ISLAND MEN
## 
### 
Outweighed, out-trained, and out
played, the Stanford S. A. T. C. eleven
went down to overwhelming defeat Sat
urday in the first American football
game played since 1905. From the min
ute the navy men started their first
rush down the field till the final whistle
the result was never in doubt, and the
only question was the size of the score,
the final count, 80 to 0, being about
what the play throughout would indi
cate.
But while the result occasioned dis
appointment among the Cardinal sup
porters. it brought .no discouragement
as to the ultimate prospects of the game
at Stanford, considering the caliber of
the navy team. That the varsity would
be defeated in the initial battle had been
foreseen, though as the Mare Island
aggregation was a dark horse among
elevens, the extent of the defeat could
not be forecasted.
It takes time and experience to de
velope an American team, and this
Stanford has not had. With only one
week of .real practice, and but few men
with previous American experience, the
varsity showed a lack of American
technique which, coupled with the far
superior weight of its opponents, was
responsible for the extent of the catas
trophe. The effects of Rugby were
clearly displayed in the lack of ability
to tackle on the part of the S. A. T.
C. men. Outweighed nearly thirty-five
pounds per man, the Cardinal was able
to offer but little opposition to the
smashing drives of the sailors. Unable
to make progress itself by such tactic?,
Stanford resorted to the forward pass
in those rare moments when it had the
ball, but in no case was successful.
Fighting doggedly to the last man and
the last minute, the eleven never gave
up the hopeless battle, and cut down
the number of points scored against it
from 54 in the first half to 26 in the
second.
