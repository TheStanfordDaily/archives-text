# OUTWEIGHED VARSITY CRUSHINGLY DEFEATED BY MARE ISLAND MEN
## 
### 
Outweighed, out-trained, and out
played, the Stanford S. A. T. C. eleven
went down to overwhelming defeat Sat
urday in the first American football
game played since 1905. From the min
ute the navy men started their first
rush down the field till the final whistle
the result was never in doubt, and the
only question was the size of the score,
the final count, 80 to 0, being about
what the play throughout would indi
cate.
But while the result occasioned dis
appointment among the Cardinal sup
porters. it brought .no discouragement
as to the ultimate prospects of the game
at Stanford, considering the caliber of
the navy team. That the varsity would
be defeated in the initial battle had been
foreseen, though as the Mare Island
aggregation was a dark horse among
elevens, the extent of the defeat could
not be forecasted.
It takes time and experience to de
velope an American team, and this
Stanford has not had. With only one
week of .real practice, and but few men
with previous American experience, the
varsity showed a lack of American
technique which, coupled with the far
superior weight of its opponents, was
responsible for the extent of the catas
trophe. The effects of Rugby were
clearly displayed in the lack of ability
to tackle on the part of the S. A. T.
C. men. Outweighed nearly thirty-five
pounds per man, the Cardinal was able
to offer but little opposition to the
smashing drives of the sailors. Unable
to make progress itself by such tactic?,
Stanford resorted to the forward pass
in those rare moments when it had the
ball, but in no case was successful.
Fighting doggedly to the last man and
the last minute, the eleven never gave
up the hopeless battle, and cut down
the number of points scored against it
from 54 in the first half to 26 in the
second.

The first touchdown of the game was
scored easily by the navy. The kick
<>lT netted them about twenty yards and
after a series of center rushes, in which
the weight oi the gobs clearly showed
itself, Buck, the fullback, took the ball
across.
After tiiat touchdowns came in
storms, something like one a minute,
being only slight exaggeration. The
nav\ had team-work, which their live
weeks' steady practice had enabled them
to get. Bevans made the second and
third touchdowns with little difficulty,

best men on the opponent's team.

game and was replaced by Roland.
Later Holt came back into the game.
\t no time during the game was
Stanford in any position for scoring
and never got nearer than twenty-five
yards to her objective goal The tack
ling on Stanford's part was feeble. At
but two or three times were real tackles
made, most of the time the down was
caused by the stumble of the navy play
er. and not by successful tackling.
No substantial gains were made ex
cept one successful forward pass
caught by Flood, who was immediately
downed by the sailors.

eight hundred being the estimated at

Hart's thrilling swoop down upon the
field in his aeroplane during the first
half of the game. Jimmy De Hart is

\t no time during the game was
Stanford in any position for scoring
and never got nearer than twenty-five
yards to her objective goal The tack
ling on Stanford's part was feeble. At
but two or three times were real tackles
made, most of the time the down was
caused by the stumble of the navy play
er. and not by successful tackling.
No substantial gains were made ex
cept one successful forward pass
caught by Flood, who was immediately
downed by the sailors.

eight hundred being the estimated at

guards paraded on all sides of the field
to keep spectators off the field.

Hart's thrilling swoop down upon the
field in his aeroplane during the first
half of the game. Jimmy De Hart is

Outweighed, out-trained, and out
played, the Stanford S. A. T. C. eleven
went down to overwhelming defeat Sat
urday in the first American football
game played since 1905. From the min
ute the navy men started their first
rush down the field till the final whistle
the result was never in doubt, and the
only question was the size of the score,
the final count, 80 to 0, being about
what the play throughout would indi
cate.
But while the result occasioned dis
appointment among the Cardinal sup
porters. it brought .no discouragement
as to the ultimate prospects of the game
at Stanford, considering the caliber of
the navy team. That the varsity would
be defeated in the initial battle had been
foreseen, though as the Mare Island
aggregation was a dark horse among
elevens, the extent of the defeat could
not be forecasted.
It takes time and experience to de
velope an American team, and this
Stanford has not had. With only one
week of .real practice, and but few men
with previous American experience, the
varsity showed a lack of American
technique which, coupled with the far
superior weight of its opponents, was
responsible for the extent of the catas
trophe. The effects of Rugby were
clearly displayed in the lack of ability
to tackle on the part of the S. A. T.
C. men. Outweighed nearly thirty-five
pounds per man, the Cardinal was able
to offer but little opposition to the
smashing drives of the sailors. Unable
to make progress itself by such tactic?,
Stanford resorted to the forward pass
in those rare moments when it had the
ball, but in no case was successful.
Fighting doggedly to the last man and
the last minute, the eleven never gave
up the hopeless battle, and cut down
the number of points scored against it
from 54 in the first half to 26 in the
second.

Outweighed, out-trained, and out
played, the Stanford S. A. T. C. eleven
went down to overwhelming defeat Sat
urday in the first American football
game played since 1905. From the min
ute the navy men started their first
rush down the field till the final whistle
the result was never in doubt, and the
only question was the size of the score,
the final count, 80 to 0, being about
what the play throughout would indi
cate.
But while the result occasioned dis
appointment among the Cardinal sup
porters. it brought .no discouragement
as to the ultimate prospects of the game
at Stanford, considering the caliber of
the navy team. That the varsity would
be defeated in the initial battle had been
foreseen, though as the Mare Island
aggregation was a dark horse among
elevens, the extent of the defeat could
not be forecasted.
It takes time and experience to de
velope an American team, and this
Stanford has not had. With only one
week of .real practice, and but few men
with previous American experience, the
varsity showed a lack of American
technique which, coupled with the far
superior weight of its opponents, was
responsible for the extent of the catas
trophe. The effects of Rugby were
clearly displayed in the lack of ability
to tackle on the part of the S. A. T.
C. men. Outweighed nearly thirty-five
pounds per man, the Cardinal was able
to offer but little opposition to the
smashing drives of the sailors. Unable
to make progress itself by such tactic?,
Stanford resorted to the forward pass
in those rare moments when it had the
ball, but in no case was successful.
Fighting doggedly to the last man and
the last minute, the eleven never gave
up the hopeless battle, and cut down
the number of points scored against it
from 54 in the first half to 26 in the
second.

The first touchdown of the game was
scored easily by the navy. The kick

after a series of center rushes, in which
the weight oi the gobs clearly showed
itself, Buck, the fullback, took the ball
across.
After tiiat touchdowns came in
storms, something like one a minute,
being only slight exaggeration. The

game and was replaced by Roland.
Later Holt came back into the game.
\t no time during the game was
Stanford in any position for scoring
and never got nearer than twenty-five
yards to her objective goal The tack
ling on Stanford's part was feeble. At
but two or three times were real tackles
made, most of the time the down was
caused by the stumble of the navy play
er. and not by successful tackling.
No substantial gains were made ex
cept one successful forward pass
caught by Flood, who was immediately
downed by the sailors.
A large crowd saw the game, about
eight hundred being the estimated at

guards paraded on all sides of the field
to keep spectators off the field.
Another feature was Jimmy De-

field in his aeroplane during the first
half of the game. Jimmy De Hart is
