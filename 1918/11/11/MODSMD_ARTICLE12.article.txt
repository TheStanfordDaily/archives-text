# War Board Opens New Headquarters
## Exhibition of the Work of Many Departments at Old Zete House 
### 
Exhibitions of work of the various
departments of the Stanford Women's
War Board were attractively placed at
the opening of the new headquarters of
the organization Friday night, in the
old Zeta Psi house. Music ou stringed
instruments by members of the "500"
attracted a large crowd, and the war
organizations formally introduced its
new quarters.
Red Cross work, which is one of the
most important branches, will begin to
morrow. This will consist in making
pneumonia jackets, of which large num
bers are needed, and in mending sweat
ers sent from Camp Fremont, and dis
tributed through the Palo Alto chap
ter.
At present this auxiliary has not
proved its ability to complete a speci
fied amount of work. According to
Miss Henrietta Dickey, the organiza
tion at the University has been placed
on trial and it is up to Stanford women
to prove that the boasted support of
war activities is more than a boast. No
money is asked, merely the time which
may be from one hour a week to one or
more hours each da\. A large attend
ance each day is needed in ordei that
the allotted work may be completed
Competent women will be in charge
dailj to direct the work and inspect it,
as it always has all others. This is the
condition of this auxiliary, as stated
by Miss Henrietta Dickey, 20, who is
the chairman of the Red Cross com
mittee for the University. A large at
tendance is needed each day in order
tbat the work which is expected may
be accomplished. Competent women
will be in charge every day to direct
the work and inspect it. The sweaters
arc those from Camp Fremont and are
given out hy the Palo Alto Chapter.
Salvage work, as shown at the exhi
bition, has proven to be an active de
partment. Already a large amount of
tinfoil has been gathered and nut shells
and fruit pits are being turned in regu
larly. but the committee in charge has
asked that greater care be taken in
saving these articles since the shells and
pits are important in the manufacture
of gas masks, an dthe tinfoil is a very
valuable material. The slogan of this
committee is "No piece too small,"
and with this the branch of the war
board expects to do a great deal of
salvage work.
Stanford scrap hooks which were to
have been made very soon have been
delayed and this work will not be done
until later.
