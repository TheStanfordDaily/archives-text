## 
### 
Tomorrow evening Dr. C. B. Wheeler
will address the men and women of
the University in the Little Theater
on the work of the seven organizations
interested in the United War Work
drive as he has seen it during his work
with the Salvation Army in i-'rance
along the entire battle line from Switz
erland to the North Sea. The Reverend
Father J. W. Geason will also speak
on the work of the Knights of Colum
bus.
Dr. Wheeler has been interested in
the work of the Salvation Army since
the entrance of this country into the
world war. Before his splendid work
in France, Dr. Wheeler was well known
as a famous evangelist in the East for
twenty-five years. He comes from
Evanston. Illinois, and after he com
pletes his work with the United War
Work campaign he will return to
Evanston for a rest before he resumes
his work with the Salvation Army.
All who have heard Dr Wheeler are
impressed with the vivid story he has
to tell and the lecture promises to be
one of the most interesting of the year.
