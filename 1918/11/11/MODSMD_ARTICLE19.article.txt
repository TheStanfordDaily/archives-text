# ST. MARY'S DEFEATED BY CALIFORNIA MEN
## 
### 
California defeated St. Mary's, 40
to 14, last Saturday afternoon. St.
Mary's was greatly outweighed and
from the start there was no question
as to the outcome if California kept
at line plunging. During the first half
rhev refused to try line plunging and
tried forward passes and trie kend
runs. Most of these plays resulted in
fumbles and at the end of the first
half the score stood 14 to 14.
In the second half California contin
ually made their yards through St.
Mary's light line. It was just a ques
tion of how large the score would be.
Sprott. Cordon, and Eels starred for
California. Gordon, the big Bruin
tackle, played practicaly the entire
defense for California. Kauhane, the
little Hawaiian, starred for St
Mary's. The first time St. Mary's had
the ball he went around California's
end â€¢ for seventy yards and a touch
down. Again, he intercepted a for
ward pass and ran forty yards to
touchdown.
