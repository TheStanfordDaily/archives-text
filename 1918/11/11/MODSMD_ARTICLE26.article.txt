# ABOUT STANFORD
## THE 						PALO ALTO STOCK FARM 
### 
Senator Stanford was always a great
lover of fine horses. He became a keen
observer of their characteristics and a
"â– n believer m the great possibilities
: development ti. rough training. In
1877 lie established the Pal" Alto Stock
barm, which, In reason of the original
system of training carried out and the
remarkable results achieved, became
famous the country over.
I he "kindergarten' for the weanlings,
short-distance track for the develop
ment of speed, and the infusion of
thoroughbred blood were the main fea
tures of the Palo Alto system. The
t.irm of ten thousand acres had two
trotting departments, one at Palo Alto,
one at Vina Ranch. There was also a
thoroughbred department at Palo Alto.
In all, the farm contained in stables
and pastures over a thousand fine bred
horses.' The trotting department, of
most interest to visitors, was situated
one-half mile west of the quadrangle,
a village in itself, with its large barns,
long rows of Stables, paddocks, feed
mill and blacksmith shop, cottages for
employes, and perfectly kept mile and
quarter-mile tracks.
Senator Stanford would often sit in
a large chair in the center of the track
ring and have his young favorites
brought out for trial. It was while
watching one of these fast trotters, an
animal which had the enormous stride

of twenty-three feet, that he conceived
the idea of taking pictures in motion.
I he services of a skillful photographer
were secured and an ingenious system
of cameras worked by electricity were
arranged. Thus an instantaneous view
of the animal was given as he passed
the home line. The senator spent $40.-
UOO in these experiments alone. They
resulted in overthrowing all previous
notions on the subject, and the book
which he had written and published,
" Hie Horse in Motion," was a valuable
contributio nto scicnce.
Palo Alto Stock Farm was the home
of many celebrated horses. The great
Electioneer, Arion. Sunol, Palo Alto,
Advertiser .and many others hardly less
famous were bred here.
"I became interested in thoroughbred
horses,' Senator Stanford once said,
"through ill-health. My doctor had or
dered a vacation for me. I could not
leave, so bought a little horse that
I turned out to be remarkably fast, and
| it was in the using of it that I became
! interested in the study of the horse.'
He devoted a considerable portion of
bis vast fortune in this enterprise. The
.annual sale irorn the farm was one of
the greatest events in the world of
horses.
It is of interest to note that the once
famous Palo Alto Stock Farm is now
being used for the breeding of fine
cattle.
