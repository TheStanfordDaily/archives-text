# War's End Starts S.A.T.C. Rumors
## Opinion is Divided as to the Future of the Student Soldier Corps 
### 
Coming with the signing of the* armis
tice lasi night by the German envoys
and the practical ending of the war,
many guesses were immediately made
as to the future of the S. A. T. C. As
yet, however, it ia too early for the
local S. A. T. (J. authorities to be able
to make an\ definite statement.
Opinion regarding the S. A. T. C.'s
future varied widely. The most popu
lar belief at present is that the ST A. T.
C. will lie disbanded oi> the Ist of Jan
uary. The argument advanced for this
is that the S. A. T. C was organized on
tiie idea that the war would last at least
a year and that it was necessary to
have men technically trained for the
arnu. The war now being over, the
exponents of the S. A. T. C.'s disband
ing on the first of the year say that
men are now needed to be technically
trained for civil life.
On the other hand, others believe that
the S. A. T. C. will continue until
1920. Undoubtedly the S. A. T. C. is
the acme of war preparation and ac
cording to thinkers of this view the
best way to prepare for wars to come
will be through the means of the S. A.
T. C.
It is hoped by all that orders will
come from the S. A. T. C. headquarters
at Washington clear up the situation.
