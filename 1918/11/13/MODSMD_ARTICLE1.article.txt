# PLANS ARE MADE BY BAKER TO DISBAND S.A.T.C.
## HOLIDAY IS CUT SHORT Orders Regarding Grading of S.A.T.C. Men Received Yesterday 
### 
A dispatch was received last night
from Washington saying that Secre
tary of War Baker had announced
that he was considering the best way
of stopping the S. A. T. C. with the
least disruption to the institutions in
volved. A policy will be worked out,
the secretary said, that will turn the
colleges back to their regular pursuits
as quickly as possible without causing
losses to the institutions.
Earlier yesterday President Wilbur,
a regional director of the S. A. T. C.,
received the following telegram from
Colonel Itees, head of the Committee
on Education of the War Department:
"S. A. T. C. unit will continue mili
tary and academic work without inter
ruption regardless of armistice. Plans
have been prepared for the future of
the S. A. T. C. under the conditions
brought about by the armistice,
which will be sent you and the college
authorities as soon as authorized."
Various interpretations of these two
communications have been made.
Some of these are to the effect that
the S. A. T. C. will be abandoned at
once, and others believe that it will
continue until June. The local S. A.
T. C., under Captain Parker, has re
ceived 110 instructions as yet.
President Wilbur has also received
orders from Washington that the
grading of the S. A. T. C. men is to
be made up on a basis of academic rec
ord, character, military ability, and
physical and athletic ability. Aca
demic ability, however, will play the
prominent part in the make-up of the
S. A. T. C. grading.
Further instructions were also re
ceived by President Wilbur, as S. A.
T. C. regional director, from the War
Department, to the effect that the
Thanksgiving vacation will be limited
to Thanksgiving Day only. This ap
plies not only to the S. A. T. C., but to
the entire University. This cancels
the local orders of a few days ago to
the effect that the Stanford S. A. T. C.
was to receive a four days' Thanksgiv
ing vacation. No other holidays will
be allowed until Christmas.
