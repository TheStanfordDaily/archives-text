# RED CROSS IN NEED OF MORE KNITTERS
## 
### 
Red Cross rooms at the old Zete
house are open for work, but the
women have not been turning out in
proper numbers. Perhaps this is due
to the fact that the news of peace has
stirred too many hearts. However,
our men will need woolen goods more
than ever now that winter is coming
on, and it is a duty for every Stanford
woman to spend certain hours in Red
Cross work every week.
Ten women are signed up for work
every day.and these women are to be
held responsible for appearing at their
appointed hour. Others are expected
to be present whenever they have free
periods. It is necessary that twelve
sweaters be darned by the end of this
month, and sixteen pneumonia jackets
must be made. Wool will be given out
every afternoon from H to 1 for the
knitting of socks and sweaters which
can be takon home by the women if
they wish Red Cross hours are from
2 to 5 daily.
