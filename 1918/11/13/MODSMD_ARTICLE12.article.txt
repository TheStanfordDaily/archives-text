# AVIATORS TO ARRIVE BY AERIAL ROUTE FOR CONTEST
## TEAM PRACTICES DAILY Coaches Announce Members of Both American and Rugby Squads 
### 
An unusual feature of next Satur
day's same with the Mather Field avi
ators will be the flight of two aero
planes driven by members of the team
all the way from Sacramento to the
Encina gymnasium. As many of the
team as the aeroplanes can accommo
date will come by tliat route; the rest
will be content to come by train at a
slower rate of speed. Jimmy de Hart,
who flew over the field last Saturday
during the game with the sailors, will
drive one of the machines. During
the halves the birdmen are scheduled
to perform stunts over the gridiron at
close range. With one or two excep
tions all the members of the team ar
officers. The game is called for 2:30
p.m.
Stanford will doubtless realize that
the game Saturday will be the moat
difficult one, in all probability, with
the exception of the game with Cali
fornia. that the eleven will play. Un
der the sting of last Saturday's defeat,
the team has been tirelessly practic
ing. trying to remedy its weak pomts.
The squad is taking its military drill
from 7 to 8 in the? morning and is on
the football field all afternoon. Far
from being downcast, the men are urg
ing on to greater effort in preparation
for the games that are to come. Barry,
a new candidate for gridiron honors, haa
become eligible for the team by his
entrance into the S. A. T. C. He is
light but is fast, and looks like val
uable material. He hails from the
Middle West. Several other new men
have appeared, and Coach Badenoch
now announces the men who are on
the squad. The names follow:
Barry, Clark, Holt, Mangin. Noack,
Patrick, Rowland, J. Watts, Burrell,
Flood, Henry, Mattenson, Purcell,
Refus, Slater, F. Watts, Craddock,
Gunn, Kaigler. Moore, Pallot, Envart,
| Vaughn, Parker. Cartmill. Hawley,
Maloney, Nuss, Piatt. Hill. Wilson.
Barlow.
A game for the midweek is prac
tically assured with Camp Fremont.
The rugby squad is also announced
by Coach Flannigan. The men are:
Maillott, Swift, Robertson, Knight,
Ratner, Drury, Shaler, Sheldon, Simp
son, Scofield, Cupid. Kocher, Peckham,
Duckel, Marks, Greenaway. Clark,

An unusual feature of next Satur
day's same with the Mather Field avi
ators will be the flight of two aero
planes driven by members of the team
all the way from Sacramento to the
Encina gymnasium. As many of the
team as the aeroplanes can accommo
date will come by tliat route; the rest
will be content to come by train at a
slower rate of speed. Jimmy de Hart,
who flew over the field last Saturday
during the game with the sailors, will
drive one of the machines. During
the halves the birdmen are scheduled
to perform stunts over the gridiron at
close range. With one or two excep
tions all the members of the team ar
officers. The game is called for 2:30
p.m.
Stanford will doubtless realize that
the game Saturday will be the moat
difficult one, in all probability, with
the exception of the game with Cali
fornia. that the eleven will play. Un
der the sting of last Saturday's defeat,
the team has been tirelessly practic
ing. trying to remedy its weak pomts.
The squad is taking its military drill
from 7 to 8 in the? morning and is on
the football field all afternoon. Far
from being downcast, the men are urg
ing on to greater effort in preparation
for the games that are to come. Barry,
a new candidate for gridiron honors, haa
become eligible for the team by his
entrance into the S. A. T. C. He is
light but is fast, and looks like val
uable material. He hails from the
Middle West. Several other new men
have appeared, and Coach Badenoch
now announces the men who are on
the squad. The names follow:
Barry, Clark, Holt, Mangin. Noack,
Patrick, Rowland, J. Watts, Burrell,
Flood, Henry, Mattenson, Purcell,
Refus, Slater, F. Watts, Craddock,
Gunn, Kaigler. Moore, Pallot, Envart,
| Vaughn, Parker. Cartmill. Hawley,
Maloney, Nuss, Piatt. Hill. Wilson.
Barlow.
A game for the midweek is prac
tically assured with Camp Fremont.
The rugby squad is also announced
by Coach Flannigan. The men are:
Maillott, Swift, Robertson, Knight,
Ratner, Drury, Shaler, Sheldon, Simp
son, Scofield, Cupid. Kocher, Peckham,
