# THE
						LAW STEPS
## 
### 
Now that the war is over, we may expect to see the old customs of the Quad
crawl timorously out o 1 their holes and make ready to resume business at the
old stand. Before the year is over, we may have hopes of seeing an underclass
rush, a "Rough's" day. even a Washington's Birthday peerade. By the time the
boys get back from France we may have got back to the place where freshmen
wear their dinks oftener than occasionally.
A former law student returning from the war might stand it to see smoking
on the Quad, or the old Zete house used as a knitting headquarters, but if the
vision that would greet him on the Law steps would be the same as at present,
it would be apt to cause him to renounce his Cardinal allegiance. From time
when "the memory of man runneth not to the contrary." the Law steps have been
exclusively and sacredly the property of Stanford's embryo attorneys. Here
crimes, torts, and other wrongs have been the subjects for discussion, and even
comments on football or the flight take a legal aspect. But now. from the com
position of the gatherings on the Law steps the absorbing topics are purling and
and how they did things in my high school.
Nothing is more discouraging to a student of the Law than to come out
after a brain-racking hour spent in delving into the mysteries of the subject
prepared for a whiff of the refreshing "Bull" and to find the sacred stones occu
pied by a sorority house meeting or a freshman assembly. If the lawyers don't
assert their rights the Engineering corner will be invaded by such gatherings next
