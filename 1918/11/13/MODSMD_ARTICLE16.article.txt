### 
" 'It can't be done, but here it is.' is
the spirit which makes possible the tre
mendous war work in France today,"
said Dr C. B. Wheeler of the Salvation
Army and prominent evangelist in an
address given last night in the Assem
bly Hall. The Reverend Father J. VV.
Gleason followed Dr Wheeler, discuss
ing the splendid work of the Knights
of Columbus.
Dr. Wheeler told of his many expe
riences with the work of all of the or
ganizations, the Knights of Columbus,
American Library Association, War
Camp Community Service. Salvation
Army, Victory Boys and Girls, Y. W.
C. A., and the Y. M. C. A., which are
interested in the United War Work
drive.
"When you say the Y. M. C. A.," said
Dr. Wheeler, "I think of the hundreds
of huts throughout France which mean
home for the boysâ€”l think of the ho
tels in London which harbor our boys.
"When you speak of the Jewish Wel
fare Board, I think of a Jewish boy
who lay dying and when he called for
his rabbi, the rabbi was there be
cause of this board.
"The Salvation Army brings a pic
ture of a large hut where the women

serve as many as six thousand men a
day and hundreds turned away, the
doughnuts and coffee they themselves
have made."
In the same manner. Dr. Wheeler
brought out the significance of the
work of the other organizations, in each
case sighting a mixed, concrete incident
as an example.
The entire speech was filled with an
unusual dramatic intensity which clearly
showed the breadth and variety of ex
perience which Dr. Wheeler had gone
through during his many months in
France. Dr. Wheeler has donated his
services during the United War Work
drive and he will cover a good portion
of California during this week.
In speaking of the work of the
Knights of Columbus, Father Gleason
said: "Practically all of the work that
is done for the men is so arranged that
although men may receive the benefits
of this organization free. Twenty-five
thousand packages of cigarettes, to
bacco, and candy were dropped from
aeroplanes to the men in the trenches,
marked 'Compliments of the K. of C.' "
Religious boundaries are disregarded
in the work and every man is welcome
in a Knights of Columbus hut. The
work is for all and in this the organi
zation carries on an important part in
the. high morale of the American sol
dier.
