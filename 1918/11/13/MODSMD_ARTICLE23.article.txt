### 
The Untied States Food Administra
tion for California â€¢ has published the
following instructions to the people of
America:
"Don't stop saving food. Don't let
starvation conquer those whom war has
spared. Don't celebrate peace by icing
a cake. Eat no more than is necessary
for health and strength. Use fresh
fruit sand vegetables that are in season.
Don't demand high-priced products thai
are not in season. Mich as oranges be
fore the new crop come-- in. Don't
blame your local grocer for high prices.
By consulting the list of prices posted
in his store you can learn what lie is
paying and see what profits lie makes.
The Food Administration has been
given no price-fixing power over meat,
so that the laws of supply and demand
are regulating the price and in conse
quence many of us must do without it.
Let us be thankful for the Food Ad

ministration's power to fix the price of
wheat and sugar.
"Let us stand by the Food Adminis
tration and he ready to follow its re
quests, uot mandates, for it has proved
that America is a real democracy and
can be counted on for voluntary service.
Take courage for more self-denial in
the knowledge that without your indi
vidual saving the war would not have
been so speedily won."
