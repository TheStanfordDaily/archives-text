"I little dreamed that I would have
the privilege of addressing an audience
on a day which will go down in his
tory as one of the turning points in the
progress of civilization," said Professor
E. H. Krehbiel in an address on "Mod
ern France" at the Assembly Hall last
Monday evening.
After pointing out the significance of
the signing of the armistice by the Ger
man government, Dr. Krehbiel went on
to tell of the conditions in France, par
ticularly in relation to the food prob
lem. He told of incidents where Amer
ican soldiers had given up their food
while marching along the roads of
France to the trenches to the French
children whom they met.
