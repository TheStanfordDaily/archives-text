The famous Monk is back ou the
campus, though but for a short time.
All Stanford has been seen through the
eyes of the cartoons which Monk has
fostered. All the devotees of the
dance have whirled and one-stepped
to the beating of time by Monk. All
barbarians have stopped and won
dered at the apes and woodland
I creatures that swung and crawled
I over Monk's drums, for W. I. "Monk"
Antrim, '19-, is the renowned Cannibal
Creator.
Without Monk, Chaparral would
j have turned in blank sheets instead;
of the splashes of black and white
| that were distinctly his own. The j
j "Blame the Kaiser" edition which will!
, appear in December has been largely
written and drawn in the desert sands
!of Arizona, far from the maddening
! crowd, where Monk has been recover-i
: ing from an illness of last year.
