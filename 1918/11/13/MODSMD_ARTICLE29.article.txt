# ABOUT STANFORD
## THE
						FRESHMEN-SOPHOMORE RUSH 
### 
The right of Stanford sophomores to
enforce the traditional regulations of
governing the actions of the freshmen
dates back to the early history of the
University.
Atlhough there hud been previous
class conflicts, the most notable being
those between '95 and '96. over the pos
session of the famous water tank, the
first so-called freshman - sophomore
rush was held the night of February 10.
1894. The fight took place in the mud
and ooze of a newly ploughed field back J
of Encina Hall. During the afternoon '
several freshmen and one sophomore I
were peacefully engaged in a game of |
cards. A discussion arose, the result!
being that soon a number of freshmen, j
including the class president, were tied. :
their faces smeared with green paint
and their pictures taken. The news of
this "outrage" spread rapidly and soon
the class of '96 was in arms. At 10

o'clock the rush proper began. A jun
ior and senior held aloft glaring torches
for the benefit of spectators and others
of the upper classmen mingled with the
fighters, giving encouragement \t mid
night the treslunen were proclaimed vic
tors. as they had all but one of their
opponents tied.
In the years that followed the class
rush changed into indiscrinate and con
tinues class warfare. Finally, in the fall
of 1910, an organized class rush was
formed, following a series of midnight
rushes and numerous painting episodes.
This rush was held on the old football
field under <he supervision of tipper
classmeti. Each side was providel with
strong band> of cloth and distinguished
by green and red paint, respectively.
Since then the freshman-sophomore
rush has become an annual affair and is
dear to the memory of all Stanford
men.
