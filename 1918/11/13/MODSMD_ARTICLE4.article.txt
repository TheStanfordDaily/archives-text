# Plumber Smelt .. .. Lots to Do at . ... Delta Chis'

What the !"
This was the ponderous decision of
Justice W. E. Redwine. '18, President
Wilbur's prominent law librarian,
j when he entered the deserted shrine
jof Delta Chi last Monday afternoon,
i On the dining-room table, in the bed
' rooms and on the lawn were miles of
.
; pipe.
Somewhere in the wreckage Justice
| Redwine discovered a hard-working
: plumber pulling apart, with laudable
| efficiency, the entire plumbing system
i of the Delta Chi house.
Smiling at Redwine through the
J mass of twisted metal, the plumber au
j nounced that he was looking for"the"
| leak. He hadn't found it as yet, but
jhe expected some kind of develop-
I uients by nightfall.
| Then a horrible suspicion crossed
| the plumber's mind and he turned to
I the bewildered judge and said:
j "Say! This is the—er —let me see,
the Delta Gammer house all right, isn't
it?"
"It is not!" yelled the irate jurist;
"and drop that axe."
Contractors estimate the damage at
! $300.
