# Influenza Again Invades Campus
## Jolly-Ups Postponed Till Next Quarterâ€”Another Stanford Man Dies 
### 
Influenza has once more started on
the campus. Four cases are reported
since last Saturday. Mrs. McGee, the
Y. W. C. A. secretary, developed the
disease last Thursday, which makes
the total number of cases five. No
oases have started among the men as
yet, and a second outbreak in the S. A.
T. C. is being rigidly guarded against.
Three cases are in the Kappa Alpha
Theta house. Miss Lolita Bellingall,
'19, Miss Florence Bills, '19, and Miss
Elsie Lutz. gr., are now under doctors'
orders. Miss Bellingall has returned
to her home in Oakland, while Miss
Bills and Miss Lutz are now at the
Peninsula Hospital. Araxie Vartanian,
who is a transfer, is the fourth case,
and is at Roble Hall. She is too ill to
be removed to the hospital.
Both junior, senior and sophomore
jolly-ups have beeu called off. These
were to be the first dances of the quar
ter since the military dance for the S.
A. T. C. was postponed. These jolly
ups will not come off until next quar
ter, since Saturday was the last open
