# VOLUNTEER DAY WILL OPEN WAR DRIVE TOMORROW
## WAR TALK AT ASSEMBLY Canvass of Living Groups Planned by Speakers at Dinner Hour 
### 
Tomorrow is Volunteer Day for the
campus in the United War Work drive
which will be opened with an assem
bly for the Rev. Dr. Stidger. pastor
of the First Methodist Church of
San Jose. Following the assembly, a
luncheon will be held at the Women's
clubhouse, at which all speakers and
sixty men and women from the cam
pus as well as faculty members wilf be
present.
Tomorrow evening all of the living
groups on the campus and the S. A.
T. C. will be asked to volunteer
pledges. Speakers have been chosen
from the student body for this work.
In the women's organization as speak
ers are: Josephine Welch, '18; Irene
Bonnett. '19; Ruth Chandler, '19;
Dorothy Hanna, '19; Mary Therkelsen,
'19; Frances Willis, '20; Ruth Searcy,
'20; Ruth Lakin, '19; Catherine Wil
liams, '19; Ellen Calhoun. '20; Eva
Crowe, '21, and Mis Helen Fulton, vis
iting secretary from Y. W. C. A. of
San Francisco. Professor R. S. Green
of the mathematics department and
Robert Worthy, secretary for the 112.
M. C. A., are in charge of the men's
organization.
The quota set for the campus is
about $12,000, the same amount as was
raised last year in the Student Friend
ship Fund Drive.
Dr. Stidger will speak on "Silhou
ettes From the Front," a subject for
which his many months in France
have given him a remarkable back
ground.
The War Work Drive has been made
even more imperative by the signing
of the armistice, for with the men in
the trenches idle, recreational advan
tages are a greater necessity than
ever before.
Dean Huston, chairman of the ex
ecutive committee, expresses every
confidence in the ability of the Uni
versity to raise the assigned quota.
There is 110 reason to believe that the
women will not live up to.the standard
of $(J,OOO they set last year, and a
more complete organization has been
worked out for the men.
