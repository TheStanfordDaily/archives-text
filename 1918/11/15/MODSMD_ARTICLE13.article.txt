# A 						STUDENT ORGAN
## 
### 
Owing to lack of knowledge of student body affairs on the part of many
of the new students, it has been deemed advisable to make clear the position
o fthe Daily Palo Alto in Stanford student activities. The newspaper is ex
clusively an organ of the student body, and is responsible to that organiza
tion alone in regards to editing and management, insofar as nothing is pub
lished in it whcih would be a fit subject for investigation by the faculty com
mittee on student affiars or the president of the University. This is set forth
in the A. S. S. U. constitution, Article IV, Section 1, which reads: "The
Associated Students shall publish a paper to be known as the Daily Palo
Alto."
i The editor-in-chief and the business manager of the Daily Palo Alto are
A. S. S. U. officials, whose election is provided for in the student body con
stitution. The business manager is elected by the student council. The
editor-in-chief is by the revised constitution adopted last year elected by the
editorial staff; previous to the change he was elected by the whole student
body at a regular election. Even now, however, the staff election may be de
clared invalid and a geenral election held for the position of editor upon
petition of fifty members of the student body. Regular elections are held in
June and February.
The Daily Palo Alto, as the student body newspaper, is the official pub
lication of that organization. In it notices and results of elections, and nomi
nations must appear, and the reports of the student manager and other
officials.
Nothing in the foregoing, however, should be taken to mean that the
Daily Palo Alto is bound, in its editorial policies, to slavishly follow or de
fend the policies or acts of the student council or other governing bodies. It
has always been the policy of this paper in the past and will continue to
be in the future, to reserve the right to criticise any stand or policy taken
by student body officials with which it disagrees.
The Daily Palo Alto welcomes communications from members of the
student body, and expressions of opinion on any matters of current interest
and is the usual means of expression of any individual or group which de
sires to make its views public.
