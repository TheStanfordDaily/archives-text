# POORLY MANAGED

Now that the election for yell leader is over, the Daily Palo Alto wishes
to congratulate the successful candidate, who was fairly elected, but cannot
refrain from a word of comment in regard to the management of the election,
and to account for the apparent misinformation printed in this paper.
It wa sat first planned to make the election purely an S. A. T. C. affair,
and instructions had been issued to the first sergeants of each company to
take charge of the balloting. One day before that set for the S. A. T. C.
election, the Associated Students, which organization had previously shown
no interest in developments, decided, after consultation with the military
authorities, to make it a student body election, â€”an entirely commendable
step, but somewhat confusing, coming at the eleventh hour. In Wednesday's
issue, the Daily Palo Alto ran in part a signed statement from those in
charge of the election, announcing that polls would be open from 10 to 12
a.m., from 12:30 to 3, and from 4to 4:30 p.m. It was further announced that
the polls would be on the Quad near the Law steps.
But yesterday the polls were open on the Quad for but little more than
an hour, and many who were entitled to vote and who desired to do so were
deprived of their privilege on that account. While the final result would not
have been affected if the polls had been kept open the proper length of time,
the mismanagement shows a slip somewhere. If we are going to have elec
tions, let's hold them right.
