# THE
						WAR-A WEEKLY REVIEW
## 
### Professor P.J. Treat 
To have the collapse come within
three days—the Kaiser abdicated and
flight, a People's Government estab
lished in Berlin, and terms of uncondi
tional surrender acceptedt—hat was a
finale which few would have dreamed
of, no matter how ardent their hopes
and wishes.
The storm began to break within
Germany when, early last week, the sai
lors at most of the naval stations seized
their ships and unfurled the red tlag of
revolution, On Wednesday Prince Henry
of Prussia, the Kaiser's brother, escaped
from Kiel through a shower of bullets.
On J hursday a republic was proclaimed
in Bavaria, and the ancient Wittels
bach dynasty deposed, and the next
night the Kirg of Wurtemburg abdicat
ed. In Berlin the Social Democrats de
manded the abdication of the Kaiser,
but the latter refused to yield. But on
Thursday afternoon an ultimatum from
the Socialists was delivered to Prince
Maximilian, the Imperial Chancellor, it
demanded, in addition to enlarged polit
ical rights, the abdication of the Kaiser
and the renunciation of the Crown
Prince. If these demands were not
granted by Friday noon, the Socialists
would withdraw from the Government,
and this meant rebellion. It was this
ultimatum, reinforced by the rapid
spiead of revolution throughout the
German states, which brought the Kai
ser to terms. And on Saturday the
news was flashed abroad that William
11 had abdicated the thrones of the Em
pire and of Prussia and that the Crown
Prince had renounced his rights. A re
gency was to be established, of which
Depvty Ebert, the Vice President of
the Social Democratic party, would be
Chancellor. But events moved too fast
to make the latter step necessary.
That morning the workmen in Berlin
commenced a general strike. Proces
sions, in which the red flag was car
ried, surged through the city. There
was little bloodshed. And before the
day was over a People's Government
had been established in the city, whether
before or after the news of the Em
peror's abdication arrived we do not
know. Deputy Ebert became Chancel
lor of the new administration, and after
some friction between the Majority and
the Independent Soc.i;dists, a cabinet has
teen established. Similar changes took
nlace in the Prussian government. And
by this time the revolution was in full
swing throughout Germany. The King
of Saxony was dethroned, some of the
Grand Dukes, Dukes and Princes abdi
cated, others were dethroned, and the
free cities of Hamburg, Bremen and
Labeck passed under the control of the
Socialists. According to the latest re
ports only the smaller states remain
unaffected, and these probably have
sincq joined the revolution.
On Sunday morning the former Kai
ser, accompanied by some of his staff,
crossed the Dutch frontier. It was a
humiliating flight. Instead of returning
to Germany, to his faithful people, lie
hurried away from the Great Headquar
ters at Spa, in Belgium, less than twenty
miles from the Dutch border. His en
trance caused some misgivings to the
Netherlands Government, and he has
apparently been interned as a German
fugitive. The former Empress and some
of the late princesses have been protect
ed in Berlin by representatives of the
soldiers and workmen. Various rumors
have been circulated concerning the for
mer Crown Prince, but none as yet con
firmed.
P.arly Monday morning the courier
returned to Foch's headquarters from
the German high command. At 5 a m.
tl'e armistice was signed, and hostili
ties ceased at 11 that morning. Be
cause of the difference in time the joy
ful news reached the Pacific Coast
shortly after midnight, that morning.
The terms of the armistice were read to
Congress at 1 p. m., but later it was
learned that certain changes were made
belore the text was signed, designed
to meet the extraordinary conditions
which had arisen in Germany.
The armistice called for the complete
and unconditional surrender of Ger
many The more important terms pro
vidcc 1 for the evacuation of all occupiet
' territory, including, Alsace-Lorraine ; tin

occupation by the allies 'of the kit
bank of the Rhine, bridge heads on the
othei side, and a neutral zone there; the
surrender of a great quantity of guns,
all the submarines and many other
ships of war, and a great number of lo
comotives, cars and motor trucks; and
reparation for war losses. The armis
tice lasts for thirty days, with the op
tu n of renewal, but it may be de
nounced on forty-eight hours' notice on
tai'urc to execute any of the terms.
Peace has come, therefore, with vic
tory The armistice does not, of course,
mean absolute peace, but it has deprived
( ermany of any means of renewing the
v. We are not informed as to what
German Government accepted the armis
tice, but it is doubtful if any govern
ment which may arise during the pres
ent disorders would repudiate it. The
next step is the carrying out of its
terms. The German armies arc retir
ing, and on Sunday the triumphal en
tn.i.ice of French and American forces
into Metz and Strassburg will take
place Disorder in Brussels has ren
dered the speedy occupation of the cap
ital by the Belgian and allied troops im
perative. And steps have been taken
toward the surrender of the naval units,
in spite of their control by the revolu
tionists.
Then will come the assembling of the
diplomats for the greatest peace confer
ence the world has ever known. Opin
u.ns differ as to how long it will take
to settle the final terms. One authority
has estimated that twenty months will
be required. In my opinion far less
lime will be required. • The Allies, guid
ed by the remarkable state papers of
President Wilson, have worked out the
principles of their terms already. To set
tle the detatils should not- take very
long. All the world cries out' for
peace and the restoration of normal con
ditions. The improved means of com
munication in use today will enable
speedy reference to the home govern
ments during the negotiations. The
conference should be a model of rapid
and orderly procedure.
.Mid thus the hostilities came to a
close. Before the tiring ceased the
American troops had entered Sedan,
scene of the French disaster in 1870 ; the
B".j'sh had advanced beyond Mons,
where they suffered their first reverse in
August, 1914, and the French had
clcareel the Germans out of almost all
th' occupied territory, with the aid of
their British, American, and Italian al
lies. If anyone has failed to read Mar
shal Foch's words when he accepted the
American Distinguished Ser i ••• medal
on Tuesday, he should hasten to do so.
They deserve to be struck off on endur
ing metal and presented to every mem
ber of the American armies, both abroad
and in this country.
And the war lords have gone down
to ignoble disaster: The Kaiser, the
King-Emperor, the Kings and Princes
of the German States, the Czar of TV. 1
garia. Only those Kings who led t'
armies of freedom have won and held
the esteem of mankind. George of En;:
land, the faithful constitutional monarc'
Victor Emmanuel of Italy, the so!
dier king, and Albert of Belgium, wh<
for a time lost all but honor, but hold
ing fast to that he has lived to see the
despot crushed in shame.

view? of the war by Professor Treat.)
