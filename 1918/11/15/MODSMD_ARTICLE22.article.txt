### 
(What is to be done with the for
mer Kaiser is a question which has
furnished the topic for much discus
sion in this country, i he former Em
peror has escaped .into Holland, ac
cording to last reports, and how he
shall be treated there is a problem
that is worrying the Dutch as well as
the Allies and his former subjects.
The following article, giving the legal
aspect of the subject, has been pro
pared expressly for fhe Daily l'alo
Alto by Dean C. A. J us ton of the
Stanford Law School. —Editu 's Note.)
Emperor Wilhelm's flight to Hol
land after his abdication is an appeal
to the right of asylum of political
refugees. This privileg has been ex
ercised before by both the United
States and England, and it is within
the rights of the Queen of Holland
to admit the Kaiser to an asylum,
without such reception being regard
ed as an unfriendly act by the en
tente allies and the United States.
If, however, Holland decides to ad
mit the ex-Kaiser to its protection the
question arises whether lie seeks this
refuge as a civilian or as a member
of the military establishment of Ger
many. In this aspect of the matter,-
the alleged fact that lie is in uniform,
is significant. Since bis abdication
he is no longer the head of the Ger
man armies, but he may retain per
sonally a military status. If this is
the case then, Holland owes the duty
under international law in case it re
ceives him into its territory, of in
terning him as a member of a bellig
erent force.
If. on the other hand, be is to be
regarded as a mere civilian the only

duty of Holland under international
law, in case it grants him asylum, is
to exercise such surveillance over him
as will be a reasonable safeguard
against his becoming the center of a
counter revolution or of a new armed
struggle against the allied victors.
The case of Wilhelm presents cer
tain interesting parallels with that of
Napoleon L After Napoleon's defeat
ui Waterloo and his practical rejection
by the French government fhe ex-
Emperor inquired of an American
ship-captain whose vessel was then in
the Garonne, whether he might have
an asylum aboard the ship. The cap
tain replied that he would be happy
to receive him.
The Prussian general Glueker or
dered that Napoleon should be cap
tured aiid executed, and fearing
treachery in France as well as doubt
ing the protection the young Ameri
can representative could afford him,
Napoleon finally decided to entrust
himself to his generous foe, England.
He inquired' of the vommander of the
British man-of-war, Bellerophon,
whether or not he could,be assured
of a temporary asylum and whether
he could be assured of a home in Eng
land, professing that he wanted to
become an English citizen. The cap
tain replied that he would receive him
and take him to England.
The Tory ministry then in power in
England were responsibleffor.ther r .the ex
iling of Napoleon to the remote Isle
of St. Helena. The act was the a t
of England alone, but it was generally
acquiesced in by her allies. No place
of banishment is now so remote or

secure as was St. Helena then, and
the ultimate disposition of the ex-
Kaiser remains a problem in which
l precedents- give us little aid.

Emperor Wilhelm's flight to Hol
land after his abdication is an appeal
to the right of asylum of political
refugees. This privileg has been ex
ercised before by both the United
States and England, and it is within
the rights of the Queen of Holland
to admit the Kaiser to an asylum,
without such reception being regard
ed as an unfriendly act by the en
tente allies and the United States.
If, however, Holland decides to ad
mit the ex-Kaiser to its protection the
question arises whether lie seeks this
refuge as a civilian or as a member
of the military establishment of Ger
many. In this aspect of the matter,-
the alleged fact that lie is in uniform,
is significant. Since bis abdication
he is no longer the head of the Ger
man armies, but he may retain per
sonally a military status. If this is
the case then, Holland owes the duty
under international law in case it re
ceives him into its territory, of in
terning him as a member of a bellig
erent force.
If. on the other hand, be is to be
regarded as a mere civilian the only

duty of Holland under international
law, in case it grants him asylum, is
to exercise such surveillance over him
as will be a reasonable safeguard
against his becoming the center of a
counter revolution or of a new armed
struggle against the allied victors.
