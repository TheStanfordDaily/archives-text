# WAR WORK DESCRIBED BY MISS MIRRIELEES
## Former English Instructor Writes of Work Done at Medical Base 
### 
Several letters vividly describing the
character o£ one phase of the work
which the Stanford Women's Unit is
doing irf)Franpe ha-Ve recently been, re
ceived from Miss Edith R Mirrielees
now an American Red Cross casualty
searcher in Base Hospital No. 11. Ex
cerpts from her letters follow:
"My official title is casualty searcher
My hunting is done through cards uicl
lists. What happens to got you your
cards is this: Some family in America
gets word that its son is wounded or
killed and gets nothing more. The gov
ernment sends out the fact, but does
not, of course, enlarge on it. The fam
ily then calls on the Red Cross and it
cables to Pari-< to find out more, or the
family cables direct to the Paris office.
Thtn in the office in Paris they make
up a list of inquiries of the day, nut
tl.ern on cards and send them out to the
casualty searchers. I lie searcher gets
her cards, goes to her files, and goes
through the cards, noting any that are
in her hospital.
"Some days the hunting is good and
some days it is poor, but when you find
a card you first record all it says about
a man and then, if he is really still in
\our hospital, you go to see him. After
yo' have talked to him you wire to
Paris his condition and the nature of the
>vonnd, and in the evening you mi.ke
your report. You write a confirmation
of the wire. On a day when you fi »d
eiph 4 or ten it takes most of the day to
see the men and make the reports.
"Besides the cards you get twice a
month a Missing List, with the nan.es
of men lost after battles —either not rec
ognized because of their wounds, or
captured and not known to lie so or mv
of the other hundred things that may
happen to a man in a huge battle. The
Missing List is a thing that appeals to
your imagination more than any of he
other paper work, for you net the clear
est picture of the waiting family at
home with* this Missing List in your
hards, you again go to your files, find
mer of the same company and organi
zation and see whether they know anv
rhit'g about the fate or the man who
lust. Once in a long, long time yen
find tlu m-'.n himself in your hospital,
with his serial number lost and a hand
Mown off or Ms eyes affected or .-onie
other reason why lie 1 as dropped out so
far as his c mpany and family know.
When that \a-ppei. you celebrate inti r
nail) nd go aboi t r a day or two
feeling as though you had created a new
human being: but most of the time you
get only traccs of him.
"ft is only at night that you realize
how o mmonplacely you have heard and
been told of men buried in shell explo
sion* ar.d men wiped out by high explo
sives and men killed in bayonet figl ts,
all jis though ii were the normal thing
in life. I do not get half the sense of
horror of war over here that I did at
home, because it seems so much more
the rormal thing."
