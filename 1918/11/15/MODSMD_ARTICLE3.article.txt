# Stirring Address Opens Campaign
## Rev. Stidger Gives Stirring Pictures of Life at the War Front 
### 
As the opening of Volunteer Hay in
the I'nited War Work drive. Dr. W.
L. Stidger, pastor of the First Meth
odist Church in San Jose, spoke on
"Silhouettes from the Front," giving
graphic experiences which lie went
through during his eight months as
a Â¥. M. C. A. secretary in France.
"This war has wiped out all lines
between religious factions,'* he said,
"and the day of the narrow preju
diced point of view on religious fun
damentals has passed. In the trenches
there are no social differences and it
is under these conditions that we find
the true brotherhood of man."
Dr. Stidger went on to explain the
origin of the unification of the seven
organizations in the present drive.
"It started in France." said Dr.
Stidger. "as the combined spirit of
brotherhood which characterizes all
that has been done in war work on
the other side. All of the organiza
tions have found it impossible to
work without the aid of the others
and the United War Work drive is
the fruition of the spirit that is out
there."
Dr. Stidger went on to give several
intensely partriotic a> well as humor
ous stories of incidents which to him
characterized the type and necessity
of the work which was being done in
the trenches today.
"Are w< j all speaking American?"
asked Dr. Stidger. and told of the
German-American who left his farm in
Oregon. When he arrived at the front
he was seen on a number of different
occasions speaking German to the
prisoners which had been brought in.
Finally Dr. Stidger asked the boy why
he was fighting for the Allies when
he spoke German and so little Eng
lish and seemed so interested in all
that the German prisoners could tell
him.
"Well." said the hoy, "I left my
far mand I probably won't ever see
that again, and I took up the gun for
Uncle Sam and I am over here to
beat up the Huns. If that isn't speak
ing American I can't do any more."
The address closed with an appeal
for a generous response to the call for
volunteer pledges among the stu
dents and faculty.in supporting and
backing up our men in France.
