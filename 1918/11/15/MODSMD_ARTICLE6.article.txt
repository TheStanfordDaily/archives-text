# BOTH VARIETIES ON PIGSKIN CARD
## Tomorrow Cardinal Battles Fliers, Palo Alto Athletics 
### 
"The next best thing to the big game, and the only real spectacle of the s?a
son at Stanford," is thfc way one man characterized the double American and
Rugby carnival at the Cardinal institution tomorrow The Rugby battle between
the Palo Alto Athletic Club and the Varsity will open proceedings at 1:30, and
the American battle with the diers from Mather Field will follow immediately
after.
Probably tomorrow's fracas will be the only one of its kind ever held in the
United States with two teams of different kinds of football from the same univer
sity battling. Fifty cents will admit to the complete affair. In order to top
things off in proper United States, several stunt fliers from Mather Field will add
their stuff to the games.
To start proceedings for the games tomorrow, a big rally will be held in
Encina tonight. Pete Flanagan. Coach Badenoch. Assistant Coach Livernash, Ken
Lilly, and "Sam," known to every Stanford man as long as anyone can remember,
will tell how Stanford used to do it, and will try to put a little of the old >tuff
into the new. Yell Leader Kinney has two or three things up his sleeve that he
is going to spill for the rooting section tomorrow. Both S. A. T. C. and non-S.
A. T. C. men are expected to be out tonight
Tomorrow the same old rooting bleachers will be reserved for the men who
are prepared to add a little noise.

American
The Mather Field-Varsitv game will
he the real test of the American team.
If Stanford can show before the famous
1 )e Hart and the other stars of the
fliers' aggregation, that she can tackle
and run interference in any manner
whatsoever, Coach Radenoch will have
.cored a victory. No one in the world
exm cts the Cardinal to win. Tn fact,
ti'a* would ruin all the dope. But the
Mather Field team is a good one, and
Stanford is new. Therefore there re
: tains hut two things to watch in the
game—one Jimmy De Hart and the!
other the knowledge of football dis
played !)>• Stanford
Dolly, Hawley and possibly Flood will ■
be out of the game, but Coach Baden-1
och has uncovered some new men that j
will help plug things up. Barlow, aj
player from Minnesota, where football'
is second nature, showed up a couple of;
nights ago and although light has been:
playing football which is sometimes
strange in scrimmages these days. j
The Mather Field team played the
University of California today and to
morrow's scramble will furnish the tirst
opportunity of comparing the old rivals. |
