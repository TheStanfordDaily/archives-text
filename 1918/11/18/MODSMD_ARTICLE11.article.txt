# THE 						WAR DRIVE
## 
### 
Presumably the last sacrifice we will be called upon to make for war pur
poses will be to subscribe to the limit to the drive now being conducted for the
United War Work activities which lias been extended till Wednesday. That
it is the last ought to increase rather than diminish our efforts, for the neces
sity for funds has increased rather than diminished since active lighting came
to an end. The preliminary returns indicate that more can be subscribed and
will have to be subscribed if Stanford is to live up to the standard set by other
universities.
But the final amount raised at Stanford must be left to the individual con
science rather than any quota fixed beforehand. Due to the peculiar composition
of a university community, it cannot be called upon to subscribe at the same
ratio as a self-supporting community. Most of the men. and women outside of
the S. A. T. C. are living on rather close allowances from home, and on account
of war times haven't the usual amount of extra money. To subscribe to the war
fund and then write home for a check to cover the amount, thereby cutting
down tin amount of the home subscription, is questionable generosity, and ought
not to be resorted to in order to make a showing for the college.
Luxuries can be dispensed with, and a check given the war drive fund will
produce more satisfaction in the end than an equal amount spent in new clothes
or parties to the city. But as for the subscriptions that mean nothing but a
further draft on the source of supply, let's let the folks at home have the credit
for those.
