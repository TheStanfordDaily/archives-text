# A 						BONFIRE ?

One of the few freshman duties that the first-year classes generally approve
of is that of building and guarding a bonfire for the rally preceding the Big
Game of the season. Its hard work and lots of it. but the friendships formed
during the bonfire shifts, and the joy of achievement, make the whole affair a
pleasure as well as a duty for the wearers of the caps.
Ihe tradition of the freshman bonfire has remained unbroken up to this
year. Whether or not it is possible to build one this year is a matter which
should be decided at once. Reports from Berkeley say that a bonfire is being
constructed by our rival, and if Stanford is to follow suit, no time is to be lost.
To construct a pile like those of previous years is, of course, out of the ques
tion. Rut there are a number of energetic frosh not in the S. A. T. C. ami
these at least might possibly gather together enough combustibles to furnish a
nucleus for the enthusiasm of the big rally. Student body and freshman officials
ought at least to get together and consult with University and military author
itics as to the possibility of some sort of blaze.
