# Chapparal is Written up by Rising Cub!!

Following a well-attended meeting
held at the business establishment of a
well-known Powell street merchant,
Hammer and Coffin society decided to
Hind a new name for the proposed
"Blame the Kaiser" issue of Chaparral.
Undoubtedly something was to
blame for the flat taste everything
was having nowadays, thought the
Chaparral staff, but in lieu of present
events it could hardly be laid at the
ex-ruler's door. From this point the
minutes of the meeting seem rather
blurred.
The Daily Palo Alto representative
was able to make out the fact, how
ever, that orders for the December
number could be made in advance at
the Bookstore. Copies will be sent to
any part of the globe for 35 cents. A
complimentary copy was voted to the
man in the white apron.
(Note. â€”Chaparral was due for a
funny story today, but there wasn't
anything to write about. So the fresh
man reporter looked through all the
Daily files for the past twenty years
to find what a Chaparral story was
like. After an hour of studious en
deavor he produced the above as a
composite copy of all that a "Chappie"
story should be. Judge for yourself.)
