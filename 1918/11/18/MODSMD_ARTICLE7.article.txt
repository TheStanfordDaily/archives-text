# LOUIS H. EATON CALLED BY DEATH FRIDAY NIGHT
## LOCAL MUSICIAN DIES Organist of Memorial Church Succumbs to Illness of Several Months 
### 
Louis H. Eaton, University organist
for the last five years, died at his home
in Palo Alto last Friday night after an
illness of several months.
Dr. Eaton, as organist and choir
master. was a familiar figure to the
Stanford community. His daily organ
recitals were attended and enjoyed In
many. Each year he trained and had
a practically new choir and their re
peated success testified to his musical
ability and leadership. The great ora
torios given annually â€¢by Dr. Eaton
were contributions to the intellectual
life of the University and will be sadly
missed. To play in the services of the
Memorial Church, to give the daily
organ recitals, interpreting the compo
sitions produced today on what has
been for centuries one of the noblest
of instruments, taxed the technical skill
and scholarly taste and judgment of a
man whose life was given to music.
Dr. Eaton will long be remembered and
loved by Stanford students as a great
master.
