# STANFORD DEFEATED BY THE AVIATORS IN FAST AMERICAN GAME
## 
### 
With an improved defense but with
weak offense, Stanford's eleven went
down to defeat 70-0 before the Mather
Field Aviators Saturday, when Jimmy
de Hart, living up to his brilliant repu
tation, scored four of the ten touch
downs against the Cardinal. Twice,
when on their five-yard line, the
eleven held its own against the flyers.
The trick plays and occasional open
ings through center were responsible
for the defeat. Just before the Ameri
can game the fifteen defeated Palo
Alto Athletic Club 22-<>. The fact that
both American and Rugby football
were played on the same day is unique
in Stanford's history.
The fifteen faced each other at 1:45
p.m. and scrapped for ten minutes be
fore Clark on a pass ran the length of
the field for a touchdown which failed
to be converted. A few minutes later
the score was tied by the Pall} boys,
who also failed to kick the goal. Af
ter that the game was easy pickings
for the Cardinal fifteen, and at the
end of the first half the score stood
16-3. During the second half Stanford
made two more touchdowns, making
the score 22-3. With a final effort the
Athletic club took the ball across at
J he close of the game. They failed to
convert or to make further score.
Coach Flannigan, the famous Santa
Clara man, pulled the men who repre
sented the Cardinal together in a re
markably short time, and although
the game was not faultless as played
by either team, he deserves a great
deal of credit for the showing they
made. Sheldon, Ratner, Clark and
Scofield played especially well for
Stanford; Lynn of the Pally fifteen
was easily the best man of that team,
starring in nearly every play and be
ing responsible for one of their touch
downs.
The line-up of the fifteens follows:
Forwards —Palo Alto, Herdman,
Hayes; Stanford, Ratner, Winham.
Lock —Palo Alto. Hughes; Stanford,
Metcalf.
Rear rank —Palo Alto. Gorman, Hut
man; Stanford. Robison, Clark
Breakaways—Palo Alto. Dwight.
Bacus; Stanford, Clifford, Swift.
Wing forward —Palo Alto, Harde
man; Stanford. Meyers.
Half —Palo Alto. Lynn; Stanford,
I Spiers.
Five-eighths—Palo Alto, Green, Gai
raud; Stanford, Scofield. Knight. Shel
don.
Center three—Palo Alto. Boone;
Stanford, Kocher.
Wings—Palo Alto, Carey. Shedd;
I Stanford, Levy, Drury.
Full —Palo Alto. Klein; Stanford,
: Bryan.
If Jimmy de Hart expected to score
eighteen touchdowns against Stanford
las he did in a recent game, he was
sadly mistaken in his reckoning, and
I instead got a real taste of Stanford
' tight and spirit. Tho little all-star half
i played a steady and brilliant game
' nevertheless, but his team worked him
! to death in a way which prevented him
I from pushing the pigskin over more
than the four times which he did. But
there were two other Mather Fold
I men who played a consistent and
| strong game. These were Jacobl. th
giant, full, and Chambers, right end.
The game started at 2:45 p.m. Stan
ford kicked the ball to de Hart, who
was promptly downed, to everybody' •
surprise. d- N Hart included. Several
more rushes failed to gain, and when
Stanford got the ball it looked - it
the Cardinal might put- up a good
game, after all. The ball went back
and forth as neither side gained,
| When the aviators regained th** ball
de Hart ran half the field on a trick
I play around the end to a score. Cham

I hers converted, and the tally was 7-0.
No score was made by either side dur
ing the remainder of the quarter.
In the second quarter Stanford put
up an exhibition of defence operations
Which did her credit. Twice on the
i goal line, with two or three downs to
! go, the Cardinal held the flyers from
I scoring. The fighting was during this
i quarter almost entirely on Stanford's
; five-yard line. Once in a blocked kick
Chambers scored a touchdown which
he converted. De Hart and Jacobi
also scored on heavy attacks through
center. The half closed 28-0.
In the third quarter on a fourth
down, Hoist of Stanford dropped Rose
in his tracks after the Cardinal had
kicked. When the aviators got the
ball a fine forward pass, Chambers to
Bortz, resulted in a touchdown for the
flyers. One other touchdown by Hoag
land was scored during the quarter.
The score at this point was 42-0.
During the last quarter the aviators
scored four touchdowns, all of which
were converted. During the last ten
minutes of play Mather Field tried
three successive forward passes, all of
which were intercepted by Stanford.
As a last result they booted the ball
and the Cardinal regained it. Stanford
then tried three forward passes, the
last of which was completed by put
ting the ball on the aviators' five-yard
line. This was the Only time that a
score on Stanford's part was at all im
minent. Two rushes through center
failed, and the whistle blew. Final
score. 70-0.
The spectators had a great thrill
during the Rugby game and during the
halves of the American contest when
Lieutenants Gray and Long as pilots
performed feats of peril over the
stands. Loop-the-loops were the least
of their exhibitions, which consisted
of tailpins, spirals aud side spins.
With a great roar the machines would
swoop down upon the field and be off
again just as someone in the stand
expected to be crushed to death by
the impact of the airplanes.
The machines arrived near Eucina
! Hall at about 1 o'clock. Jimmy de
Hart and Eddy Wales were the pas
sengers in the machines.
The attendance at the game was
estimated over one thousand. J

! to death in a way which prevented him
I from pushing the pigskin over more
than the four times which he did. But
there were two other Mather Fold
I men who played a consistent and
| strong game. These were Jacobl. th
giant, full, and Chambers, right end.
The game started at 2:45 p.m. Stan
ford kicked the ball to de Hart, who
was promptly downed, to everybody' •
surprise. d- N Hart included. Several
more rushes failed to gain, and when
Stanford got the ball it looked - it
the Cardinal might put- up a good
game, after all. The ball went back
and forth as neither side gained,
| When the aviators regained th** ball
de Hart ran half the field on a trick
I play around the end to a score. Cham

I hers converted, and the tally was 7-0.
No score was made by either side dur
ing the remainder of the quarter.
In the second quarter Stanford put
up an exhibition of defence operations
Which did her credit. Twice on the
i goal line, with two or three downs to
! go, the Cardinal held the flyers from
I scoring. The fighting was during this
i quarter almost entirely on Stanford's
; five-yard line. Once in a blocked kick
Chambers scored a touchdown which
he converted. De Hart and Jacobi
also scored on heavy attacks through
center. The half closed 28-0.
In the third quarter on a fourth
down, Hoist of Stanford dropped Rose
in his tracks after the Cardinal had
kicked. When the aviators got the
ball a fine forward pass, Chambers to
Bortz, resulted in a touchdown for the
flyers. One other touchdown by Hoag
land was scored during the quarter.
The score at this point was 42-0.
During the last quarter the aviators
scored four touchdowns, all of which
were converted. During the last ten
minutes of play Mather Field tried
three successive forward passes, all of
which were intercepted by Stanford.
As a last result they booted the ball
and the Cardinal regained it. Stanford
then tried three forward passes, the
last of which was completed by put
ting the ball on the aviators' five-yard
line. This was the Only time that a
score on Stanford's part was at all im
minent. Two rushes through center
failed, and the whistle blew. Final
score. 70-0.
The spectators had a great thrill
during the Rugby game and during the
halves of the American contest when
Lieutenants Gray and Long as pilots
performed feats of peril over the
stands. Loop-the-loops were the least
of their exhibitions, which consisted
of tailpins, spirals aud side spins.
With a great roar the machines would
swoop down upon the field and be off
again just as someone in the stand
expected to be crushed to death by
the impact of the airplanes.
The machines arrived near Eucina
! Hall at about 1 o'clock. Jimmy de
Hart and Eddy Wales were the pas
sengers in the machines.
The attendance at the game was
estimated over one thousand. J
Thompson and H. White officiated as
. referee and head linesman respective
ly. Both are from the Camp Fremont

With an improved defense but with
weak offense, Stanford's eleven went
down to defeat 70-0 before the Mather
Field Aviators Saturday, when Jimmy
de Hart, living up to his brilliant repu
tation, scored four of the ten touch
downs against the Cardinal. Twice,
when on their five-yard line, the
eleven held its own against the flyers.
The trick plays and occasional open
ings through center were responsible
for the defeat. Just before the Ameri
can game the fifteen defeated Palo
Alto Athletic Club 22-<>. The fact that
both American and Rugby football
were played on the same day is unique
in Stanford's history.
The fifteen faced each other at 1:45
p.m. and scrapped for ten minutes be
fore Clark on a pass ran the length of
the field for a touchdown which failed
to be converted. A few minutes later
the score was tied by the Pall} boys,
who also failed to kick the goal. Af
ter that the game was easy pickings
for the Cardinal fifteen, and at the
end of the first half the score stood
16-3. During the second half Stanford
made two more touchdowns, making
the score 22-3. With a final effort the
Athletic club took the ball across at
J he close of the game. They failed to
convert or to make further score.
Coach Flannigan, the famous Santa
Clara man, pulled the men who repre
sented the Cardinal together in a re
markably short time, and although
the game was not faultless as played
by either team, he deserves a great
deal of credit for the showing they
made. Sheldon, Ratner, Clark and
Scofield played especially well for
Stanford; Lynn of the Pally fifteen
was easily the best man of that team,
starring in nearly every play and be
ing responsible for one of their touch
downs.

With an improved defense but with
weak offense, Stanford's eleven went
down to defeat 70-0 before the Mather
Field Aviators Saturday, when Jimmy
de Hart, living up to his brilliant repu
tation, scored four of the ten touch
downs against the Cardinal. Twice,
when on their five-yard line, the
eleven held its own against the flyers.
The trick plays and occasional open
ings through center were responsible
for the defeat. Just before the Ameri
can game the fifteen defeated Palo
Alto Athletic Club 22-<>. The fact that
both American and Rugby football
were played on the same day is unique
in Stanford's history.
The fifteen faced each other at 1:45
p.m. and scrapped for ten minutes be
fore Clark on a pass ran the length of
the field for a touchdown which failed
to be converted. A few minutes later
the score was tied by the Pall} boys,
who also failed to kick the goal. Af
ter that the game was easy pickings
for the Cardinal fifteen, and at the
end of the first half the score stood
16-3. During the second half Stanford
made two more touchdowns, making
the score 22-3. With a final effort the
Athletic club took the ball across at
J he close of the game. They failed to
convert or to make further score.
Coach Flannigan, the famous Santa
Clara man, pulled the men who repre
sented the Cardinal together in a re
markably short time, and although
the game was not faultless as played
by either team, he deserves a great
deal of credit for the showing they
made. Sheldon, Ratner, Clark and
Scofield played especially well for
Stanford; Lynn of the Pally fifteen
was easily the best man of that team,
starring in nearly every play and be
ing responsible for one of their touch
downs.
The line-up of the fifteens follows:
Forwards —Palo Alto, Herdman,
Hayes; Stanford, Ratner, Winham.

If Jimmy de Hart expected to score
eighteen touchdowns against Stanford
las he did in a recent game, he was
sadly mistaken in his reckoning, and
I instead got a real taste of Stanford
' tight and spirit. Tho little all-star half
i played a steady and brilliant game
' nevertheless, but his team worked him
! to death in a way which prevented him
I from pushing the pigskin over more
than the four times which he did. But
there were two other Mather Fold
I men who played a consistent and
| strong game. These were Jacobl. th
giant, full, and Chambers, right end.
The game started at 2:45 p.m. Stan
ford kicked the ball to de Hart, who
was promptly downed, to everybody' •
surprise. d- N Hart included. Several
more rushes failed to gain, and when
Stanford got the ball it looked - it
the Cardinal might put- up a good
game, after all. The ball went back
and forth as neither side gained,
| When the aviators regained th** ball
de Hart ran half the field on a trick
I play around the end to a score. Cham

I hers converted, and the tally was 7-0.
No score was made by either side dur
ing the remainder of the quarter.
In the second quarter Stanford put
up an exhibition of defence operations
Which did her credit. Twice on the
i goal line, with two or three downs to
! go, the Cardinal held the flyers from
I scoring. The fighting was during this
i quarter almost entirely on Stanford's
; five-yard line. Once in a blocked kick
Chambers scored a touchdown which
he converted. De Hart and Jacobi
also scored on heavy attacks through
center. The half closed 28-0.
In the third quarter on a fourth
down, Hoist of Stanford dropped Rose
in his tracks after the Cardinal had
kicked. When the aviators got the
ball a fine forward pass, Chambers to
Bortz, resulted in a touchdown for the
flyers. One other touchdown by Hoag
land was scored during the quarter.
The score at this point was 42-0.
During the last quarter the aviators
scored four touchdowns, all of which
were converted. During the last ten
minutes of play Mather Field tried
three successive forward passes, all of
which were intercepted by Stanford.
As a last result they booted the ball
and the Cardinal regained it. Stanford
then tried three forward passes, the
last of which was completed by put
ting the ball on the aviators' five-yard
line. This was the Only time that a
score on Stanford's part was at all im
minent. Two rushes through center
failed, and the whistle blew. Final
score. 70-0.
The spectators had a great thrill
during the Rugby game and during the
halves of the American contest when
Lieutenants Gray and Long as pilots
performed feats of peril over the
stands. Loop-the-loops were the least
of their exhibitions, which consisted
of tailpins, spirals aud side spins.
With a great roar the machines would
swoop down upon the field and be off
again just as someone in the stand
expected to be crushed to death by
the impact of the airplanes.
The machines arrived near Eucina
! Hall at about 1 o'clock. Jimmy de
Hart and Eddy Wales were the pas
sengers in the machines.

starring in nearly every play and be
ing responsible for one of their touch
downs.

Forwards —Palo Alto, Herdman,
Hayes; Stanford, Ratner, Winham.

If Jimmy de Hart expected to score
eighteen touchdowns against Stanford
las he did in a recent game, he was
sadly mistaken in his reckoning, and
I instead got a real taste of Stanford
' tight and spirit. Tho little all-star half
i played a steady and brilliant game
' nevertheless, but his team worked him
! to death in a way which prevented him
I from pushing the pigskin over more
than the four times which he did. But
there were two other Mather Fold
I men who played a consistent and
| strong game. These were Jacobl. th
giant, full, and Chambers, right end.
The game started at 2:45 p.m. Stan
ford kicked the ball to de Hart, who
was promptly downed, to everybody' •
surprise. d- N Hart included. Several
more rushes failed to gain, and when
Stanford got the ball it looked - it
the Cardinal might put- up a good
game, after all. The ball went back
and forth as neither side gained,
| When the aviators regained th** ball
de Hart ran half the field on a trick
I play around the end to a score. Cham

I hers converted, and the tally was 7-0.
No score was made by either side dur
ing the remainder of the quarter.
In the second quarter Stanford put
up an exhibition of defence operations
Which did her credit. Twice on the
i goal line, with two or three downs to
! go, the Cardinal held the flyers from
I scoring. The fighting was during this
i quarter almost entirely on Stanford's
; five-yard line. Once in a blocked kick
Chambers scored a touchdown which
he converted. De Hart and Jacobi
also scored on heavy attacks through
center. The half closed 28-0.
In the third quarter on a fourth
down, Hoist of Stanford dropped Rose
in his tracks after the Cardinal had
kicked. When the aviators got the
ball a fine forward pass, Chambers to
Bortz, resulted in a touchdown for the
flyers. One other touchdown by Hoag
land was scored during the quarter.
The score at this point was 42-0.
During the last quarter the aviators
scored four touchdowns, all of which
were converted. During the last ten
minutes of play Mather Field tried
three successive forward passes, all of
which were intercepted by Stanford.
As a last result they booted the ball
and the Cardinal regained it. Stanford
then tried three forward passes, the
last of which was completed by put
ting the ball on the aviators' five-yard
line. This was the Only time that a
score on Stanford's part was at all im
minent. Two rushes through center
failed, and the whistle blew. Final
score. 70-0.
The spectators had a great thrill
during the Rugby game and during the
halves of the American contest when
Lieutenants Gray and Long as pilots
performed feats of peril over the
stands. Loop-the-loops were the least
of their exhibitions, which consisted
of tailpins, spirals aud side spins.
With a great roar the machines would
swoop down upon the field and be off
again just as someone in the stand
expected to be crushed to death by
the impact of the airplanes.
The machines arrived near Eucina
! Hall at about 1 o'clock. Jimmy de
Hart and Eddy Wales were the pas
sengers in the machines.
The attendance at the game was
estimated over one thousand. J
Thompson and H. White officiated as
. referee and head linesman respective
ly. Both are from the Camp Fremont
Y. M. C. A.
The line-up follows:
Center —Mather Field, Knopp; Stan

With an improved defense but with
weak offense, Stanford's eleven went
down to defeat 70-0 before the Mather
Field Aviators Saturday, when Jimmy
de Hart, living up to his brilliant repu
tation, scored four of the ten touch
downs against the Cardinal. Twice,
when on their five-yard line, the
eleven held its own against the flyers.
The trick plays and occasional open
ings through center were responsible
for the defeat. Just before the Ameri
can game the fifteen defeated Palo
Alto Athletic Club 22-<>. The fact that
both American and Rugby football
were played on the same day is unique
in Stanford's history.
The fifteen faced each other at 1:45
p.m. and scrapped for ten minutes be
fore Clark on a pass ran the length of
the field for a touchdown which failed
to be converted. A few minutes later
the score was tied by the Pall} boys,
who also failed to kick the goal. Af
ter that the game was easy pickings
for the Cardinal fifteen, and at the
end of the first half the score stood
16-3. During the second half Stanford
made two more touchdowns, making
the score 22-3. With a final effort the
Athletic club took the ball across at
J he close of the game. They failed to
convert or to make further score.
Coach Flannigan, the famous Santa
Clara man, pulled the men who repre
sented the Cardinal together in a re
markably short time, and although
the game was not faultless as played
by either team, he deserves a great
deal of credit for the showing they
made. Sheldon, Ratner, Clark and
Scofield played especially well for
Stanford; Lynn of the Pally fifteen
was easily the best man of that team,
starring in nearly every play and be
ing responsible for one of their touch
downs.
