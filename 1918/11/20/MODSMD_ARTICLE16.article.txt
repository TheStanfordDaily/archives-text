# THE 						UNDERCLASS RUSH
## 
### 
Since the annual underclass scrimmage was postponed on account of the
inoculations a couple of weeks ago, nothing more has been heard of it.and
the impression seems to be gathering that the idea has died a natural death.
But sore arms have practically vanished by this time, and it would seem an
opportune time to hold the affair while the football seasun is still on, and be
fore the grind for the fall finals begins. Freshman-sophomore fights were
promptly and properly squelched when the influenza epidemic put a stop to
campus activities, but with the promise that a properly supervised rush would
be granted when that danger was over. Now that health conditions are nor
mal again and the inoculations are over, it is time that plans be made for the
traditional vent for underclass enthusiasm.
