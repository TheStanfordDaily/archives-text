						DAILY PALO ALTO

It was in the spring of 1892 that
the plan of starting a daily paper at
Stanford was first proposed. A weekly,
the Sequoia, was already in existence,
but the majority of student felt a need
for some news bulletin which would
record the passing and history making
events in the new university. Adverse
criticisms and objections were made,
however, that Stanford was too young
to support a daily and others be
leved the cost of printing would prove
too great, for the nearest printing of
fice was in Redwood City, ix miles
away.
But these oppositions were finally
overcome and in September, 1892, the
first issue of the D. P. A. was pre
sented. J. C. Capron, '93 pitcher of the
varsity baseball team, was the first
editor-in-chief, and Houghton Sawyer,
'94, his business manager. This first
issue ran seven column of new matter
and nine column of advertising space.
"It will be the purpose and object of
this paper," said the editorial," to run
certin items of interest of the univer
sity, thus spanning the distance be
tween this and other universities. It
will also advertise Stanford in parts
of the country not otherwise reached."
The Daily Palo Alto made the sixth
in number of dailies published in
American universities. There was
only one paper at California, the "Oc
cident," published weekly. Elections

|to positions of editor and manager
| were entrusted to a. board of control
! elected by the student body until
11896, when elections were brought di
j rectly under student control.
Since foundation the paper has been
| the official organ of the students. It
j has not departed either in purpose or
|in policy from the idea which gave
' rise to its origin. It has published
j full and complete news of the Univer
j sity and through its exchanges has re
: fleeted college life and opinion from
j other institutions over the country,
j By means of its editorial columns it
has in part recorded student thought
! and feeling here. Many changes in
! form and typographical make-up have
been made since the first issue. For
two weeks of the first volume the
sheet was printed at the office of the
Redwood City Gazette. Then it was
removed to the University power
house, where J. A. Quelle, a student,
had set up a printing office. After
the earthquake a separate building
situated directly behind the present
Union was provided. A year ago this
fall the paper was again moved into
the new University Press building.
The constant addition of type and ma
terials has enabled the managers to
improve the appearance of the paper,
so that today it is surpassed by few
among the colege dailies of the
United States.
