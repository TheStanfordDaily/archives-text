# YUGO SLAV STUDENTS APPEAL TO AMERICANS
## A 						Letter From Switzerland Contains Appeal From Young Slovenes 
### 
A letter been received from the
central committee of tin- Federated So
cities of the Yugo Slav students resid
ing in Switzerland containing an appeal
from them to the college students "112
America. The majority of these stu
dents are men who have been wound
ed or invalided in the war and have
been sent to Switzerland to recover
their health or have escaped there from
the armies of the Austro-Germans and
Hungarians. Following are excerpts
from their appeal:
"The Yugo-Slavs appear in history
under three names, Serbs, Croats, and
Slovenes. But sprung from the same
origin, inhabiting a continuous stretch
of territory having the same customs
and especially the same national aspi
rations, the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes
form a single and identical nation.
"We are twelve millions in number,
of whom only live millions enjoy an
independent existence in the kingdoms
of Serbia and Montenegro. Ihe rest,
inhabitants of the southeast provinces
of Austro-Hungary, are subjected to
German and Hungarian domination.
"For centuries they have had to sub
mit to a relentless suppression in the
same manner as the Czecko-Slovacks,
the Poles, the Ukranians and the Rou
manians. These, too, are victims of a
similar administrative tyranny and are
equally oppressed and exploited by an
alien German-Austrian minority."
This appeal goes on further to state
that every obstacle possible is placed
in the way of tiie education of the peo
ple of these provinces and that in
Bosnia, for example, 85 per cent of the
population is growing up without edu
cation. The German government per
mits only a single high grade school
to exist for 1,500,000 people and all of
the instruction in this school is given
in German.
With the beginning of the war the
German government has thrown to the
winds all consideration of these peoples
and have done all that they could to
exterminate them. It is for this reason
that the Yugo-Slavs are asking that
they be allowed to unite and have their
own independent government.
The appeal ends by stating that all
of the Yugo-Slavonic people believe
that with the termination of this war
they will have gained this end. viz., the
unity and independence of their nation.
Similar appeals are being sent by the
the Slavic college students to many
American universities.
