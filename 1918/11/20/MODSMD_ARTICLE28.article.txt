publish the lirst Stanford Annual. At
a regular meeting of the Board of Ed
itors on December'6. 1893, the present

stantial." Notice was given at this
time through the columns of the Daily

of $5 was offered for the best cover
design.
H. S. Crocker Printing Company of
San Francisco was contracted to print
850 copies at a cost of $1750. and al
though at tirst it was planned that it
would soil for $1 per copy, it was found
necessary to raise the price to $1.50
and a $2 assessment was levied on all
members of the junior class.
The Quad made its appearance on
the campus on May 15. 1894. It was a

red and white chfth-bound book of
about 250 pa-es and was fittingly ded
icated to Leland Stanford Junior,
"whose early death ,opened for us an
avenue to higher life." The publishers
endeavored to combine in one volume

since the founding. The book con
tained full-paged photographs of young
Stanford and Dr. Jordan, steel aijd
line engravings of the '95 cla-s under
the famous oak, University buildings
and ground and pictures of the various
athletic teams. Statistics and sketches
of the literary, fraternal and educa
tional organizations were given, also a
number of original poems and short
stories of University life. A very good
illustrated josh section completed the
volume.
The general plan of make-up and
characteristic snap and Vigor set by
