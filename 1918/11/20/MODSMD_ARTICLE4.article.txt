# FRESHMAN JOLLY-UP IS BEING PLANNED FOR NOVEMBER 23
## 
### 
The first social event of the year
will be the freshman jolly-up, to be
held this Saturday in the Encina gym
nasium. Due to the prevalence of the
influenza ever since the beginning of
the quarter, no campus dances or
jolly-ups have been allowed. How
ever, the permission of the medical
advisors and campus authorities has
been obtained and, after many post*
ponemens, the freshman jolly-up will
really come off on the 23d.
The committee in charge of the
dance lias planned to have an excel
lent jazz orchestra and to provide
plenty of excitement. Everyone is
urged to come and freshmen are es
pecially invited to put in a joyous ap
pearance.
"Don't wait to be asked; introduce
yourself!" will be the spirit of the
jolly-up, for the main idea is for ev
eryone to get acquainted. Following
the usual custom, tags will be given
with the admission, which is 50 cents
to the men. Women are admitted
free.
"Saturday night at S:30, in the En
cina gymnasium, the freshman jolly
up. Watch the Daily Palo Alto for
further announcements," is the slo
gan of the committee in < barge of tho
first-year party..
