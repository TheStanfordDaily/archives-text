# PEDRO J. LEMOS WILL DIRECT ART WORK OF THE QUAD
## AID OF ARTIST SECURED Junior Pictures Must Be Taken at Franklin's Before Dec. 15 
### 
Pedro J. Lemos, well kuown at
Stanford for his tinted pictures of the
Quad in the junior hook of last year,
will have charge of the art section of
this year's annual aid will co-operate
with Miss Mary Largent, art editor.
Colored plates, more beautiful than
those of last year and dift'ering from
them, have already been planned, as
well as an elaborate dedication plate
to head the book.
Mr. Lemo is an artist of some note
and occupies the position of curator
of the Thomas Welton Stanford art
gallery. His work has won him con
siderable fame and the paintings of
the Quad which he made added a dis
tinctive feature.
All junior class pictures must be
taken by December 15 at Franklin's.
Ii five or more people wish to go in
the evening they can have their pic
tures taken then by appointment.
There must be at least five for the
evening appointments. No appoint
ments need be made for the morning
or afternoon.
Sororities and fraternities may have
their pictures taken by any photog
rapher, but they are urged to have
them done at Franklin' in order that
they may all be uniform. The pho
tographer has made a special rate,
which should be considered.
All S. A. T. C. men will have pic
tures in the Quad, this forming a sep
arate and important section of the
publication. The entire membership
of the S. A. T. C. will also be repre
sented, with pictures of Captain Par
ker and all officers. In order to facil-
itate the arrangement tor appoint
ments the S. A. T. C. men will have
their pictures taken by companies,
Company D having theirs today. Com
pany A will go tomorrow. Company B
on Friday and Company C on Satur
day.
The josh section of the Quad has
already grown to enormous propor
tions. Chaparral writers and college
wits dating back to the lime of Feg
Murray will contribute. The men
have almost all been in France and
will have a fund of laugh-provokers
entirely new. With this outlook the
pages devoted to jokes promise to be
greater in number than ever before.

which should be considered.
All S. A. T. C. men will have pic
tures in the Quad, this forming a sep
arate and important section of the
publication. The entire membership
of the S. A. T. C. will also be repre
sented, with pictures of Captain Par
ker and all officers. In order to facil-
itate the arrangement tor appoint
ments the S. A. T. C. men will have
their pictures taken by companies,
Company D having theirs today. Com
pany A will go tomorrow. Company B
on Friday and Company C on Satur
day.
The josh section of the Quad has
already grown to enormous propor
tions. Chaparral writers and college
wits dating back to the lime of Feg
Murray will contribute. The men
have almost all been in France and
will have a fund of laugh-provokers
entirely new. With this outlook the
pages devoted to jokes promise to be
greater in number than ever before.
Pedro J. Lemos, well kuown at
Stanford for his tinted pictures of the
Quad in the junior hook of last year,
will have charge of the art section of
this year's annual aid will co-operate
with Miss Mary Largent, art editor.
Colored plates, more beautiful than
those of last year and dift'ering from
them, have already been planned, as
well as an elaborate dedication plate
to head the book.
Mr. Lemo is an artist of some note
and occupies the position of curator
of the Thomas Welton Stanford art
gallery. His work has won him con
siderable fame and the paintings of
the Quad which he made added a dis
tinctive feature.
All junior class pictures must be
taken by December 15 at Franklin's.
Ii five or more people wish to go in
the evening they can have their pic
tures taken then by appointment.
There must be at least five for the
evening appointments. No appoint
ments need be made for the morning
or afternoon.
Sororities and fraternities may have
their pictures taken by any photog
rapher, but they are urged to have
them done at Franklin' in order that
they may all be uniform. The pho
tographer has made a special rate,
which should be considered.
