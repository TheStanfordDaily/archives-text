presidents in his district of the S. A.
T. C.
An extract of the letter follows:
"The time freed by discontinuance of
hitherto prescribed courses need not
wholly be devoted to new courses, but
may be utilized within reasonable lim
its for additional study hours. Institu
tions may, if they so desire, reduce the
total of forty-two hours academic
work per, week to not less than thirty
six hours."
The following information regard

"Soldiers who have been transferred
from the S. A T. C. to Central Offi

training schools under control of chiefs
of staff corps and departments, and
chiefs of artillery and field artillery
will be allowed the option of transfer
back to the S. A. T. C., provided they
return to college immediately."
Captain Parker, commenting today
