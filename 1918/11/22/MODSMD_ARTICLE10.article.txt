# TEAM GOES SOUTH TONIGHT TO BATTLE U. OF S.C. ELEVEN
## RUGBY SCHEDULED HERE IN A WEEK Stanford to Migrate Across Bay for Thanksgiving Tussle With Bears 
### 
Eighteen men of the football squad
will leave tonight for Los Angeles to
contest tomorrow with the University
of California eleven for American hon
ors. Coach Badenoch, who left yes
terday to complete arrangements at
Los Angeles for the game, seemed con
fident that the Cardinal would hold its
own.
Secret practice has, for the last
week, been going on and tactics gone
over, in spite of unfavorable weather
conditions.
Yell Leader Kinney, Ray Haig, the
trainer, and Lieutenants Spiegleman
and Livernash will accompany the men
on their southern trip.
Stanford cannot help but realize that
this game with U. S. C. is the last
game before the Big Game next Thrus
day at California Field. The Cardinal
started out poorly, as was only nat
ural, but since the game with the Mare
Island sailors she has been picking up,
so that now she has a team which need
not be ashamed to represent Stanford*
If she loses the game tomorow it will
only be another spur to add to her
effort to turn out a team that will beat
California or at least hold her down
As shown clearly in the preliminary
season thus far, Stanford's defense is
very creditable. But the offense is
weak. Holding the aviators last Sat
urday twice on their goal line showed
considerable strength in defense. But
last Saturday only once was the Cardi
nal within ten yards of her objective,
and that was in the test few minutee
of play, when Stanford succeeded in
completing a forward pasw just before
the whistle blew.
Simultaneous with the American
struggle the Ruggers will hold battle
with Santa Clara at Santa Clara, in the
first of a series of three games. The
second of the games will be played
here; the third is to be held at San
Francisco. Practice in Rugby ha#
been going on under the direction of
"Pete" Flanagan of the Knights of
Columbus. From the way in which
1 Stanford handled the ball last Satur-
I day against the Pally athletes, a great
j is to be expected.
