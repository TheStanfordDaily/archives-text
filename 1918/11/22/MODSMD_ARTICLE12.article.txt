# ARE WE ASLEEP?

A returning alumnus, being told that Stanford is on the eve of the resumption
of athletic relations with the University of California, and that the Big Game is
less than a week in the future, could scarcely understand the apathy of the stu
dent body. Ever since the founding of Stanford, the rivalry between the Cardinal
and the Blue and Gold has been an all-important feature in the student life of both
universities, as Stanford songs and yells in particular will testify . The crowning
glory of the ambition of every Stanford man was to journey to Berkeley before
the Big Game, and to paint the "C" on the hills back of the state institution. Bon
fires at both universities were always guarded with unrelaxing vigilance, for fear
of hostile action by scouting parties of the enemy. The rivalry between the two
big universities of the Coast has been as logical and traditional as that between
Yale and Harvard.
For the past four years Stanford and California have been apart, and both
have suffered thereby. The reasons for the separation it would be worse than
useless to go into here and now, —they can be forgiven and forgotten. The big
thing is that the two universities arc together again, and from present indications
will stay together. In ordinary times the merest rumor of such an event has been
sufficient to cause uproar and excitement on the Farm; now we don't seem quite
lo realize the significance of the fact. Up at Berkeley they are beginning to wake
up, but we at Stanford are slumbering yet, and the fit of the navy's new pcacoats
seems to be a more absorbing topic of campus conversation than prospects of the
Big Game.
Perhaps the reason for the prevailing lack of interest here is the differnt
view the military authorities of the two institutions have taken of student ath
letics; —there the team represents the student body, here merely the Stanford unit
of the S. A. T. C. But such an attitude is narrow and lacking in the true Stanford
spirit. The local S. A. T. C. means Stanford if it means anything; every man on
the team is a Stanford man, and the fact that a few civilians will not be permitted
to play should not affect the loyalty with which the Cardinal supports her cham
pions.
And a word as to the team. Though it would be no disgrace if Stanford were
decisively defeated in her first attempt to play the American game, this result is
not so sure as the prophets of gloom would have us believe. Wonders are being
done in the short time allowed for practice, and the showing made against one of
the strongest aggregations of the Pacific Coast last Saturday was far more encour
aging than the score would indicate. Whatever be the result, we may be assured
that the men in the Cardinal uniforms will give all they've got and fight to the
last, and the eleven is deserving of the heartiest support the student body can
give it.
In the short time remaining before the Big Game, there is the opportunity for
a reawakening of the old Stanford spirit. When Stanford is massed on the bleach
ers of the Berkeley oval next Thursday, let's let the yell leader and the whole
world know we're behind the men on the field.
