Few persons who went through the
great earthquake here at Stanford will
ever forget the terrifying spectacle of
Babylonean ruin which met the eye
everywhere, being created so suddenly
on that morning of April 18, 1906.
The shock occurred at eighteen min
utes past five o'clock, and was pre
ceded by a dull, heavy rumbling, swell
ing into a deafening roar. Although
framed houses probably deceived a
more violent shaking, the stone dormi
tories and buildings were the more
dangerous. The great ornamental
chimneys on old Ruble and Kncina
Halls were torn loose from their foun
dations, falling through from the top
floor to the basements. In both halls
three rooms with their occupants were
carried to the basements. One student
at Encina, J. R. Hanna, was instantly
killed by the tons of stone under which
he was buried, but the others escaped
without severe injury, and a girl who
went to bed on the third floor at Ruble
awoke in the parlor. The great historic
chimney of the University power house
which overlooked the surrounding
country also fell, burying and killing
the fireman, Otto Gerdes, who had re
mained at his post to turn oft' the elec
tric power of the campus. Practically
everyone rushed half clad from the
buildings, yet with all the fright and
confusion the majority of students dis
played remarkable coolness and good
judgment. K
The damage to University buddings
was estimated at about $3,000,000 The
great spire and dome of the Memorial
Church fell, and the concussion of air
thus caused forced outward the three
end walls. The front wall of the nave
also fell, leaving the organ exposed
and sending a bright flood of sunlight
into those precincts formerly unlit save
by the richly stained storied windows.
The famous Memorial Arch which
stood directly at the entrance of Me
morial Court, lost its heavy stone cap
and frieze, "The Progress of Civiliza
tion," designed by Augustus St. Gau
dens, and down the sides gapiny seams
extended even to the base Falling
fragments from the arch brok> down
the adjoining arcades and crushed in a
portion of the roof of the Assembly
Hall On front of the Zoology build
ing, the statue of Louis Agassez, which
stood on a stone shelf above the three
central arches of the arcade, fell head
first. It was imbedded fully two feet
into the concrete pavement below, but
strange to '»>ay, the statue was not
broken and is now back in its old sta
tion. The Chemistry building lost all
of its numerous chimneys and a por
tion of its front wall. Both wings of
the Museum were knocked down, but
the central part stood firm.
By far, however, the worse scenes
of destruction were presented by the
two incompleted buildings, the Gym
nasium and the Library. The great pil
lars that formed the entrance to the
gymnasium crumpled like so much
paper, and the small steel dome that
crowned the edifice was twisted out of
shape. The walls were cracked hope
lessly from roof to basement. The
Library was a complete heap of wreck
age, only the great dome standing up
firm in the center on to steel founda
tions. The ruins of these two build
ings may still be seen lying to the east
of the Quadrangle, and the stone used
in the Art Gallery and new Library has
come mainly from there.
Most of the frame houses on the row
escaped without any substantial •lam
age. The Chi Psi lodge alone was
twisted and bent from its foundation.
In all these buildings the shaking ex
perienced was so violent that it was
difficult to stand alone and several per
sons who leaped from their beds at the
first shock were thrown to the floor.
Almost at once by order of the au
thorities, the buildings were surround
ed by ropes, danger sign*- posted and
guards set. The duration of the quake,
as officially recorded, was forty-seven
seconds. There was in reality two sep
aratr shocks one immediately follow

ing the other and being far greater in
violence.
The Portola fault line, where the
slipping occurred which caused the
earthquake, lies about five miles west
of the campus and is still visited by
many interested people
