## 
### 
As the first of a series of assemblies
to be held under the auspices of the
V. M. C. A. on Thursday evenings from
ti:3o to 7:3U, Mr. C. H. Titus addressed
the men and women of the University
last night in the Assembly llall on
"The Red Triangle at the Front," and
exhibited gas masks and helmets as
trophies taken from the trenches. Sev
eral novel features were introduced,
including moving pictures and singing.
Mr. Titus discussed the work of the
Y. M. 0. A. at the front and told of
many graphic instances where the
men in the trenches enjoyed the home
life and the fun that the Y. M. C. A.
could bring to them. As a "big gun"
of the famous organization, Mr. Titus
lived up to his reputation, in the
opinion of all those who heard him, for

| he spoke in a forceful and compelling
â–  manner.
The entire assembly was tarried on
in. much the same manner that the
the entertainments for the men in
France are managed in the Y. M. C. A.
huts. A comedy on the screen opened
the program, which proved as much of
a success as the tragtdv which, fol
lowed the address. Singing lent a
unique atmosphere to . the affair.
The cooperation of the Y. M.'C. A.
as soon as can be arranged will bo en
listed in making these meetings, which
the military authorities have given
I the time to the S. A. T. C. men to at-
I tend, as.successful as possible. Many!
of them >st prominent men in Califor-1
; uiu will be asked to speak, so that
I ach assembly will warrant a large at- j
tendance. Subjects of current interest
I will be discussed by the speakers and i
i the me tings will not be confined to I
IY.M. ( X, or Y. W. C. A. work
