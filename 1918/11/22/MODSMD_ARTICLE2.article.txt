# Initiation Ban Taken From Men
## Orders to Captain Parker Grant Activities by Fraternities 
### 
Restrictions on fraternity activities
have been removed. Stanford Greek
letter organizations may now proceed
with further pledging and initiations
with the permission of the University
and military authorities.
This action was taken following the
receipt of orders from Washington by
Captain Parker to the effect that fra
ternities may resume their activities.
This order reads as follows :
It is desired that no restrictions
shall be placed on elections to fra
ternities; also that no restrictions
shall be placed on fraternity activi
ties. including initiations and meet
ings .except such as are clearly
necessary to preserve proper mili
tary training and discipline. In de
termining what, if any, restrictions
are essential, commanding officers
will exercise tact and good judg
ment
While removing the ban on intiations
and meetings. Captain Parker wishc
it to be known that S. A T, C. men
are not to use fraternity houses as loaf
ing places during their spare time. Fra
ternity houses may be opened fores
sential business meetings and initiations,
but they are not to lie regarded a
club-houses for S. A. T. C. men, ac
cording to Captain Parker. Captair
Parker regards the use of fraternity
houses as club-houses, that is beinj.
used for recreational purposes only, a?
being incompatible with military organ
ization and discipline S. A. T. C
men seeking recreation during theii
week ends will be permitted to go of
the campus.
Captain Parker's interpretation of tin
recent war order ruling, taken briefly
prevents fraternity men in the S. A. T
C. from using their own houses a
places of rccreation, but does permi
them to pledge and initiate.
