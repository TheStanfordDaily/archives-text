and friends. Professor R. L. Green,
treasurer for the campaign, stated this
morning that he hoped that Stanford
would stiil meet the assigned quota of
$12,000, as only a few hundred dollars
would make the goal. The last $50 of
the $12,000 has been promised if the
rest of the money can be raised. A
number of pledges have been made in
Palo Alto which should have been
made on the campus and which will
eventually be placed to the University
credit as soon as they can be traced
down. This money should bring the
fund very near the $12,000.
