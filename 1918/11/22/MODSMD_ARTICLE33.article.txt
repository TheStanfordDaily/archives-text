# STANFORD PAGEANT IN MEMORIAL COURT
## OTHER SCENES IN HILLS Stanford's Academic, Comic and War History to Be Theme of Spectacle 
### 
By the suggestion of Captain Parker,
head of the S. A T. C., Lieut. Walter
Whittlesey oiet with the English Club
on Wednesday evening to assure the
| cooperation of the S. A. T. C. and to
offer practical suggestions for the rnili-1
j tary scenes of the pageant next spring.
I Lieut. Whittlesey, talented as a com- j
' poser, played several original themes 1
j suggestions for the interpretative j
uiusic for the pageant. Several are to
be orchestrated for the aesthetic danc-'
ing and choruses.
As the pageant will have a greater
significance since the coming of peace, j
it was decided to enlarge the plans for
its presentation. It will be an all-day (
affair. The pageant proper is to be in
two parts, with concessions and a
luncheon for the returning alumni in
tervening.
In the forenoon, the academic Jiis
; tory, —the founding of the University,
and the college history, both serious
and comic,—will be presented in the
, appropriate setting of the memorial
j court. In the afternoon will be drama
tised Stanford's part in military af
fairs and the coming peace. This will
be held in a natural amphitheater in
the Stanford hills.
Lieut. Whittlesey suggested that the
; military scenes consist not only of
j drills, camouflage "stunts," etc., but
of realistic skirmishes, scouting and
sham attacks, for which, he remarked,
the Stanford hills are admirably suit
ed and are much like the hills of
France.
Mrs. Elliot, president of the Belgian
Relief, also met with the English Club
and promised the interest and cooper- J
ation of that society. The Belgian Re
lief is to make the costumes for the
pageant from original sketches of the!
Costume and Design Committee.
Theta Sigma Phi, woman's journalis
tic fraternity, is to have charge of the
publicity end of the pageant. There is
to be an illustrated article on the
pageant in the next number of the
Review.
The following circular letter has
been sent out by the English Club to
its alumni:
"On Pounders' Day in spring, Stan-1
ford is to present a pageant of her his- j
tory, from the romantic legends of the
first landowners and the Farm, to the
climax of her service in these last try
ing years. Now that the war is over,
the presentation will have the full sig-j
nificance of pageantry—a commemora- j
tion, almost a religious rite, and, if we
are so fortunate, it may prove also, to
at least some of the Stanford men in 1
i
service, a welcome home.
"It will be not only a remembrance of
Stanford's part in the war so far. but
a prolongation of her service into the
reconstruction that must continue for!
some time, for the receipts of the per- j
foruiance will be largely devoted to 1
reconstruction activities and Stan-!
ford's favorite charity, the Belgian Re-1
lief.
"The full plan of the pageant is not
complete, but the great divisions will
probably be these: The Land and Its
First Owners; The Farm; The Found
ing; The Early Days; College Accom
plishment; College Life; The Inter
ruption, War; Stanford and the C. It. B.
"English Club is planning and man
aging the work, but it must be in the
broadest sense a community expres
sion ; there must be eager collections
of the old tales, the old proud legends
of early days, the achievements of
classrooms and laboratories, the high
history of the C. R. B.; there must be
new lyrics for choruses and prologues,
and Stanford airs, as well as the faith
ful rendering of old well-known songs
and tunes; there must be dramatic
scenes welded from ihesc to present.

[ the doings of the years in vivid unit*
of expression.
"Will you help? Put down every
thing of romance or of realism of Stan
ford that occurs to you; if you know
the story of that painting of the post
office, of Wallace Irwin and his bucket
of water; if you know the tales of the
Frenchman, legends about the hermit;
if you are one of those who believe
that the miracle of snowfall did hap
pen on the Quad when the suit was set
tled, send in the details. If you can
spare the time, fashion the story into
a dramatic unit, ready to be inserted in
the complete chain. Your name will
then be a part of the historic program.
Imagine your background to be the
Inner Quad, before the church, or that
hollow behind the cedar-tree hill
which rises beyond the Frenchman's
lake.
"All suggestions should be in the
hands of English Club by December
30th. They cannot be used after Janu
ary 10, 1919. Be informal —jot down
your memories on scraps of paper, any
thing—be lavish of frequent postals;
but please let not a single bit of ro
mantic history be lost.
