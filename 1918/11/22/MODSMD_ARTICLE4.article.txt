# Second Varsity Tie Engineers With No Score
## 
### 
Yesterday tf«e L>tatfif®rd second team
held the fast, heavy Camp Fremont
Engineers to a 0 to 0 tie. They not
only held the Engineers but came close
to beating them when Patrick crossed
the line ou an intercepted forward pass,
but was called back because of some
Stanford man holding.
Camp Fremont brought three com
panies of her engineers over for the
game .accompanied by all her officers
and the band. The two Fremont yell
leaders and the yelling that was done
would have been a credit to any col
lege. The Stanford rooting section con
sisted of twenty-seven men, led by C.
W Wherry, '22.
During the first half each team had
the ball about half the time. During
this part of the game, as it was almost
all the time .the ball was iu Camp Fre
mont's territory, or near the center
