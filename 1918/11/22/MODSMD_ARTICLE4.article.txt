# Second Varsity Tie Engineers With No Score
## 
### 
Yesterday tf«e L>tatfif®rd second team
held the fast, heavy Camp Fremont
Engineers to a 0 to 0 tie. They not
only held the Engineers but came close
to beating them when Patrick crossed
the line ou an intercepted forward pass,
but was called back because of some
Stanford man holding.
Camp Fremont brought three com
panies of her engineers over for the
game .accompanied by all her officers
and the band. The two Fremont yell
leaders and the yelling that was done
would have been a credit to any col
lege. The Stanford rooting section con
sisted of twenty-seven men, led by C.
W Wherry, '22.
During the first half each team had
the ball about half the time. During
this part of the game, as it was almost
all the time .the ball was iu Camp Fre
mont's territory, or near the center
of the held. Both teams used straight
football and tried no passing during
the first half. Cartmill, Magin, and
Roland put up the best game during
this half. When the whistle blew the
ball was on Fremont's twenty-five yard
line.
Lieutenant Larkey started out the
second half in .Cartmill's place at left i
half, and tried to prove that a man |
could play the game of football with- j
out knowing the signals. During the [
five minutes that he played he made j
one successful kick of about twenty
five yards, had one kick blocked on
him, and carried the ball three times
for two short gains and one loss. He
showed the Stanford men , something |
of how to run interference, however J
At the end of five minutes he was re-1
placed by Cartmill.
During the second half tiie Engineers |
had the ball more, and substantial j
were made through Stanford's line by j
Reavey, Parrott, and Kircher. Toward I
the end of the third quarter Fremont
had her first chance to score. By line
plunges she carried the ball to Stan
ford's twenty-yard line, where it was
lost on downs.
The only forward passes that were
made during the game were done by
the Engineers in the last quarter.
Twenty-five and fifteen-yard passes by
Reavey to Parry and Pilling brought
the ball to Stanford's fifteen-yard line.
Penalties took the ball back twenty
yard? when Patrick intercepted a for
ward pass and ran the ball the length
of the field before he was called back.
