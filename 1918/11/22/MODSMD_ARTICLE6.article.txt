# S.A.T.C. TO CONTINUE UNTIL JUNE IS BELIEF OF PRESIDENT WILBUR
## 
### 
"The probability as we know now, and the assumption under which we are
going, is that the S. A. T. C. will continue substantially as at present until June
30, 1919, or.the end of the present academic year." This was the statement of
President Wilbur, regional director of the S. A. T. C., in an interview for the
Daily Palo Alto yesterday. Nothing can be positively announced, said Dr.
Wilbur, pending explicit orders from the War Department, but present indications
point to the continuance of the Student Army Training Corps without great
change. Slight modifications will be made in regard to the academic requirements,
however, as the men will not be transferred to the officers' training camps or other
duty as was contemplated when the plans for the S. A. T. C. were laid this 'sum
mer, and this will give more time to complete the academic requirements of the
University.
"The experience of the war has demonstrated the high value of universities
as military assets in wartime," according to the president, "and if any extensive
program is outlined by the government for future national defence, it will doubt
less include some provision for the continuance of the S. A. T. C. in a modified
form as a permanent institution." Any permanent program, in the opinion of Dr.
W ilbur, would not involve the living in barracks by the men, and other phases of
the present rigid military discipline for more than one university year. As to the
present situation, no more inductions into the S. A. T. C. will be permitted with
the exception of the men who have already been transferred from an S. A. T. C.
institution to an officers training camp. These men will be discharged from the
army and on returning to colege will be given the option of reentering the S A.
T C. or returning as civilian students.
FRATERNITIES MAY RESUME ACTIVITIES
In regard to the fraternity situation. Dr. Wilbur said that the University inter
poses 110 objection to fraternity meetings and initiations, and that all such restric
tions have been purely of a military nature. As soon as the military orders pro
hibiting such activities are withdrawn, as recent dispatches from the War Depart
ment indicate they will be, the local chapters will be free to conduct initiations and
other activities not inconsistent with the preservation of military discipline.
President Wilbur leaves for the East tomorrow, primarily on business con
nected with the future of the Student Army Training Corps, and will be gotie
nearly until Christmas. While in the East lie will attend a meeting of the Massa
chusetts Institute of Technology to discuss problems of engineering education.
He will also attend an important meeting of the association of American Univer
sities at Harvard. 1 his meeting is to be held jointly with British delegates and
is to discuss: (1) the organization and international relationship of the universi
ties and colleges; (2) the effect of the war on education; (3) the future place of
the humanities in education. A conference will also be held at Washington to
dcide S. A. T. C. matters.
FOOD ADMINISTRATION WORK CONTINUES
The work of President Wilbur with the Food Administration is by 110 means
over, as tiwt organization will of necessity continue its functions for some time
to come. lomorrow Dr. Wilbur will address the county food administrators of
California and Nevada at San Francisco on the new problems of food administra
tion brought about by changed conditions resulting from the signing of the armis
tice. Monday, on his way East, he will stop loug enough at Phoenix, Ariz., to
speak to the county food administrators of Arizona on the same subject

other activities not inconsistent with the preservation of military discipline.
President Wilbur leaves for the East tomorrow, primarily on business con
nected with the future of the Student Army Training Corps, and will be gotie
nearly until Christmas. While in the East lie will attend a meeting of the Massa
chusetts Institute of Technology to discuss problems of engineering education.
He will also attend an important meeting of the association of American Univer
sities at Harvard. 1 his meeting is to be held jointly with British delegates and
is to discuss: (1) the organization and international relationship of the universi
ties and colleges; (2) the effect of the war on education; (3) the future place of
the humanities in education. A conference will also be held at Washington to
dcide S. A. T. C. matters.
FOOD ADMINISTRATION WORK CONTINUES
The work of President Wilbur with the Food Administration is by 110 means
over, as tiwt organization will of necessity continue its functions for some time
to come. lomorrow Dr. Wilbur will address the county food administrators of
California and Nevada at San Francisco on the new problems of food administra
tion brought about by changed conditions resulting from the signing of the armis
tice. Monday, on his way East, he will stop loug enough at Phoenix, Ariz., to
speak to the county food administrators of Arizona on the same subject
"The probability as we know now, and the assumption under which we are
going, is that the S. A. T. C. will continue substantially as at present until June
30, 1919, or.the end of the present academic year." This was the statement of
President Wilbur, regional director of the S. A. T. C., in an interview for the
Daily Palo Alto yesterday. Nothing can be positively announced, said Dr.
Wilbur, pending explicit orders from the War Department, but present indications
point to the continuance of the Student Army Training Corps without great
change. Slight modifications will be made in regard to the academic requirements,
however, as the men will not be transferred to the officers' training camps or other
duty as was contemplated when the plans for the S. A. T. C. were laid this 'sum
mer, and this will give more time to complete the academic requirements of the
University.
"The experience of the war has demonstrated the high value of universities
as military assets in wartime," according to the president, "and if any extensive
program is outlined by the government for future national defence, it will doubt
less include some provision for the continuance of the S. A. T. C. in a modified
form as a permanent institution." Any permanent program, in the opinion of Dr.
W ilbur, would not involve the living in barracks by the men, and other phases of
the present rigid military discipline for more than one university year. As to the
present situation, no more inductions into the S. A. T. C. will be permitted with
the exception of the men who have already been transferred from an S. A. T. C.
institution to an officers training camp. These men will be discharged from the
army and on returning to colege will be given the option of reentering the S A.
T C. or returning as civilian students.
FRATERNITIES MAY RESUME ACTIVITIES
In regard to the fraternity situation. Dr. Wilbur said that the University inter
poses 110 objection to fraternity meetings and initiations, and that all such restric
tions have been purely of a military nature. As soon as the military orders pro
hibiting such activities are withdrawn, as recent dispatches from the War Depart
ment indicate they will be, the local chapters will be free to conduct initiations and
other activities not inconsistent with the preservation of military discipline.
