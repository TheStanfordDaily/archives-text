# RESERVED SEATS

Among other strayed traditions is the one by which the women of the
University occupy the gallery of Assembly Hall during University assemblies,
leaving the downstairs part of the building to the sterner element of the
student body. How the custom originated is shrouded in the mists of the
past, but the invariable spectacle has been the "500" from above gazing
down upon unbroken masses of masculinity. While some may criticize the
arrangement on the grounds of lack of gallantry in causing the women to
mount the marble stairways to the second floor, the fact that the seating
capacity of the two floors adapts itself more readily to the normal propor
tion of the sexes at Stanford with women above and men below is probably
responsible for it.
But this fall the appearance of scattered islands of femininity, doubt
less freshman women, as yet unlearned in the lore of Stanford traditions,
on the lower floor has caused consternation in the minds of those few who
can remember back to the days of "before the war." The great fear now
is that the bolder spirits will attempt to introduce the institution of queen
ing to assemblies, which ;n itself would be enough to cause the ghosts of
past generations of Stanford roughs to turn over in their graves and dis
tinguished speakers give up the difficult task of making themselves heard
by serious-minded students in the back rows.
