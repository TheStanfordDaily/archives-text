# Stanford Auxiliary Sends Thanksgiving Boxes to Lane Clinic
## 
### 
I hanksgiving chccr was sent to ten
Lane Clinic families by the Stanford
auxiliary in the very substantial form of
hip; wooden boxes packed with all the
staples of a Thanksgiving dinner.
Everything from soda crackers and
canned soup to olives and cranberry
sauce and all imperishable groceries ap
peared t>n the list of eatables which
went up to the Social Service depart
ment this afternoon. The boxes were
the gifts of faculty and friends in Palo
Alto, who contributed the food and
enough money to buy meat and what
ever else seems necessary to the indi
vidual family. The majority of those
receiving boxes are tubercular cases
which are in particular need of substan
tial food.
Plans tor the Christmas work are al
ready being arranged by the auxiliary,
which hopes to make the work as suc
cessful as previous years.
Old clothes are the most urgent need
of the Clinic at present, and if any of
the women can spare any of their dis- !
carded wearing apparel it will be thank- â€¢
fully received. Such gifts may be left j
at the Women's Club House, .and the
only restriction is that the clothes be
clean and mended.
