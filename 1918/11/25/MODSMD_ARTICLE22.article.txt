### 
The story told of the mysterious!
Frenchman, M. Peter Coutes, is one
of the most interesting connected with j
tiie history of Stanford. The pictur-1
esque ruins left and the romance of
the tale early save to the University !
a wealth of traditions usually ac- i
quired after long years of existence. I
It was in the year 1874 that a hand
some and distinguished stanger of
about sixty years of age, and giving
his name as M. Peter Coutts, made
his appearance in Mayfield. Very
soon after he purchased 1400 acres
of land and announced his intention
of building a country home which
would rival the famous baroneal es
tates of Europe. On this estate,
which has since become part of the
University campus, a large force of
men were put to work. His family
consisting of an inValid wife, two
young children and a governess. Eu
genie Chogenson, whose character
and history are equally as interesting
as that of Coutts, soon joined him and
were established in the cottage "Es
condite," the present residence of Dr.
Jordan. In the hills south of the
campus and near the present site of
the Sigma Nu house he had con
structed a small artificial lake with
numerous isles, picturesque bridges
and quaint parapets. On the top of
a near-by hill the old Frenchman ex
pected to build twin chateaux and a
graded road, shaded by poplars, was j
begun. The various tunnels, explored j
by many students, bored into the sur-!
rounding hills and the erection of the
"Frenchman's Tower," with its mys
terious series of loop holes at the
top, gave rise to curious comments
and speculation. In reality it was
merely a search for water and the
prosaic tank, still standing, was for ■
the purpose of supplying the estate '
with water.
As all attempts to inquire into the I
past life of the eccentric foreigner i
were met with silence, only the
barest outlines are known, ft is said,
however, that Peter Coutts was a j

j paymaster of the commissary depart
ment of t lie French army during
j the Franco-Prussian war. The disap-
I pea ranee of $5,000,000 was simulta
neous with the disappearance or
I Coutts from France. It was not until
three years after his arrival in May
i field that M. Coutts was visited by
j the French Consul of San" Francisco.
The Maladero Ranch, as the place
was called, was then famous for its
lavish hospitality and well stocked
wine cellar, and perhaps the combi
nation of the two, together with the
able explanations of the wily French
man. had something to do with til''
satisfying of the inquirers. Shortly
after.this a new French agent was
sent to San Francisco and it is said
that at this news Coutts became ver\
nervous and suddenly in 1880 lie left
for London.
In England, through the efforts of
his brother and his famous cousin,
Baroness Burdette-Coutts, a satisfac
tory adjustment must have been made
with the French government, for
Peter Coutts returned openly to Amer
ica. He now remained on his Califor
nia ranch but a short time and in
1882 returned to France, where lie
sold, through his agent, the Anglo-
California Bank, his entire estate to
Senator Stanford.
The livestock of the Maladero
Ranch was second only to the Palo
| Alto Stock Farm and contributed
! many fine bred cattle and horses to
! the farm. In a specially built stall
he kept an immense coal black ox,
whom he called "Monsieur le Curate."
The old Coutts training tracks were
laid out near the Escondite cottage
and his famous kennels of hunting
dogs was situated on: the site of the
Inner Quadrangle. One of Coutts'
■ chief hobbies was a love of fine stock
! and more than $40,000 was spent
I yearly on this branch of the ranch.
No pictures of this interesting per-j
son were ever obtained and all his
business transactions were- done un
der the name of the governess.
