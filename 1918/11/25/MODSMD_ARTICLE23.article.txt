# BOLSHEVIK RULE IN RUSSIA IS EXPLAINED
## Dean Huston Gathers Report of Radical Socialists From Recent Laws 
### 
j i Mcst of u- know something about
the Bolsheviki as raidcal socialists, and
that they are quickly overturning the
existing social order in Russia, but
there has been little information in re
gard to the actual program they are put
ting through to complete their so-called
, "reforms." The following statement
tront Dean Huston of the Law School
furnishes an idea it what the Russian
radicals are trying to accomplish now
that they are in piwer in the land of the
L zars.—Editor's Note.)
"One of the greatest diculties in
arriving' at an estimate of the character!
of the Bolshevik government in Russia (
i • the scarcity of information about its
actions. In the vast deal of rumor
which has appeared in the European |
and American paper.- very little con
crete information may be found. E>r
this reason I have thought your read
ier- might appreciate a brief description
of some of the legislation of the
i'Workmen's and Peasants' Gov<rn
ment." The information is derived,
from the Official Journal of the gov-;
eminent, and some notes of the law
published therein, which were written
by Mr. J .C. Witenberg, barrister at
law of Warsaw My source of infor
mation is a copy of the Solicitor's Jour
nal for September 14th. which has re
cently come to the Law Library. The
Ru.-sian Journal i- described officially,
las "a collection of Law- and Orders of 1
the Workmen's and Peasants' Govern-!
ment.'
"Aniciig the more interesting "bills"—
there is no evidence that they base- yet
obtained the dignity of laws—are the
I following ::
"A law on Real Property (Xo 154*
I provides that beginning from 18th !)e i
I ceniber. 1'91'7, all private transactions:
i( buying and selling) in land, houses nr
other real property are forbidden, andj
'any offense in this respect is punishable
■ by the confiscation of property . Xote:
.this must refer to confiscation of per
sonal property, since another clause
;ets forth that property tn land is abol-;
i-hetl without compensation.
"A law the Stock Exchange (Xo. j
; 184) forbids all dealing- involving;
j shares of -tock and the payment of j
any dividends or interest to private
persons.
"A Jaw on Eoreign Trade ( Xo. 55) j
forbid- all private commercial transac-1
! tfons of the Ru.-sian Mercantile Ma-|
i rine which involve buying from or|.
I selling to foreigners. Moreover, all such
transactions already entered' into since
July 19, 1914. are declared null ami void
h\ law.
*
"A law on Xationali/ation of Banks
t Xo. 150) enacts that all bank business
i- declared a -fate monopoly and that
all existing banks privately owned are
amalgamated with the state banks, and
;•!! debts and credit balances are trans
ferred to the state banks.
"The law of Industrial Insurance
( Xo. 17) enacts that all insurance con
Itrilmtions shall be paid solely by the
i masters. Another clause set- forth
1 that in the case of a workman who is j
unemployed or disabled, he shall have
the right at Ibust to get full pay during
his period <t unemployment or disable
ment .
"'A law regulating the Law Courts
( Xo. 15) enacts that ill courts, includ
in., justice of the peace courts, shall be,
abolished and that ther.- -hall be no le
al profession or public prosecutors, j
! Local tribunal- are established in the:
v.lace of the court*, the ni.-vnbers to be
chosen by popular election and without
any requirement of professional train
i iug or knowledge. It is set forth gen
erally that tliey are to be guided by pre
v'otis law- 'a- far a- the\ have not been
• brogatcd by the Revolution and as
they are rot inconsistent w'tli the Rev
• htioiiary conscience and the Kevolu
tfnarv idea of laws.' This part < 112 stat
ute or bill does not furni-h any very
clear guidance to pea-ant judges. It i
provided that all laws are abolished
'which contravene the decrees of the
Soviets or the party program of the
Mmimali-t Social Denvcratic Party and
h> Social Revolutionary Party."
, "It is not my purpose to comment on

thi - Bolshevist legislation. but rather
to -et out >-»mc specimen- of it to on
;il'l • y i:r readers to reach their own
ci..iKhi-.i'>ll- as t'>.the nature of the Hoi
shevist philosophy of goveriuuent. This
is. ! believe, somewhat definitely em
bodied in the hill.- I have briefly <le
scribed."
