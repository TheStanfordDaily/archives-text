# Big "C" Changes Color Overnight
## 
### 
When the sun rose over the Berkeley
hills this morning the big "C" hack of
the Greek Theater vied with the rosy
tints of the dawn.
Thirteen gallons of the best red paint,
lavishly applied by two enterprising ex
peditions of Stanford underclassmen,
made a gory spectacle of the sa
cred "C".
Not content with their successful des
ecration of the "C," the young painters
who held the contract for making red
what used to be gold daubed red paint
indiscriminately on the Greek Theater
and spoiled their triumph Over the Cali
fornia guards by painting a flambuoyant
"S"' on the white sides of the Campanile
