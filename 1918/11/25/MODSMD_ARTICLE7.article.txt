# ATHLETICS TO PLAY IMPORTANT PART IN 1920 ANNUAL
## TRYOUTEES ASKED FOR Quad Will Have Pictorial Record of Football History of Year 
### 
Athletics under the reign of the
S. A. T. C. at Stanford will he fea
tured in the 1920 Quad. The return
to the Thanksgiving game with
Berkeley and the attendant rival
spirit has made up for any lack in the
quantity and variety of athletics.
Individual pictures of each football
hero are assured, as well as pictures
of all the games, including the game
Saturday with the University of
Southern California. This pictorial
record of the athletic season will be
uniquely welcome because of the pe
culiar conditions of this season. Pic
tures of the big game promise some
unusual features. There will be an
unprecedented large crow'd at the
Berkeley field with a good rooting
section. Special stunts that are
planned for the rooters will be pre
served in the pictures that have been
arranged for.
Later athletics and all seasonal
sports will be represented in the an
nual. as well. Conditions seem to
indicate that spring sports will have
a better chance to develop than those
this fall, and they will have the usual
pages. Attention, however, will cen
ter on the Thanksgiving game.
Three men are now trying out for
the position of editor of the 1921 an
nual. More are needed, however, as
this hardly furnishes a sufficient field
of choice for the editor, who in real
ity appoints the successful nominees,
subject to the approval of the Quad
board. The final election is held by
the Sophomore Class later in the
year. â€¢
Next year will bring a greater re
turn to the more normal conditions
in college and in editing the Quad
the editor will find many of the con
ditions of getting out a publication
radically bettered. Sophomores should
support their class and make the first
book after the war a huge success.
This can be done only by a large
number trying out this year for ed
itor.
Those who are at present working
under the direction of Miss Dorothy
Driscoll, this year's editor, are Jessie
Thrash. H. I. Mitchell, and R. W.
Kenny. It will be due to Miss Dris
coll's competent leading that the try
outees will receive the training that
will make the Quad of next year t
success.
