## MUSTERED OUT DEC. 4-22 Men Remaining in College to Be Last to Leave the Service 
### 
"The S. A. T. 0. will be dissolved
by Christmas." This was the word
that was passed around this morning,
and which was confirmed by Captain
Parker, who received til substance of
it in a telegram from the War Depart
ment. This means that Stanford, like
all other universities, will be a civilian
college, as in the old days before the
war, beginning at the first of the win
ter quarter. The news was at first
hardly believed, for the prevailing
opinion among local authorities had
been that the Student Army Training
Corps would continue, at least in a
modified form, for the balance of the
academic year.
The telegram from the War Depart
ment orders the demobilization of the
S. A. T. C., beginning December 4,]
which demobilization is to be com-!
pleted by December 22. The men who
desire to leave college and return to j
other occupations will be mustered j
out of the service first, while those j
students who will remain at Stanford j
irrespective of the existence of the.
S. A. T. C. will be kept till the close!
of the quarter. On December 10 all
officers who desire to leave will be
discharged.
Visions of staying in bed till time
for 8 o'clocks will seem good to the
men who have been accustomed to
arising in the darkness by bugle cals.j
but few will regret the short time they j
spent in their nation's uniform. As)
university life in the usual sense will
be begun again in January, today's an-1
nouncement will cause tlie bringing
up of many problems in connection;
with student affairs, athletics, and liv-j
ing conditions.
