# DR. SCHEVILL TELLS OF CONDITIONS IN SPAIN TODAY
## 
### 
" 'We don't know where we're go-
I ing, but we arc on our way,' expresses
i the attitude of the Spanish govern
! ment," said Dr. Rudolph Scherill in
j his address on "Spain Today and Her
; International Problems," given in the
i Little Theater last night.
"Spain recognizes her own fault of
I instability in government and the i
! need of vast reforms and reorganiza-
I tion," said Dr. Schevill. "Her salva
; tion lies in education and the creation j
| of true leaders, but I am doubtful if
! any great change will be possible
i without strife. Spain is torn by much
! confusion. Some big upheaval must
j awaken her.
"Spain's attitude toward the war is
the result of her historical back
ground and internal distractions. She
was not kindly disposed towards the
Allies in previous wars and Germany
conspired to keep her from seeing her
way clear in this one.
' "She believed that America's en
trance into the war was only an ex
tension of the Cuban trouble and was
part of America's expansionist move
ment. Public opinion was divided and
there was no one strong enough to
unite it and give it expression."
Dr. Schevill concluded with the
hope that if any big change in Span
ish government does come about soon,
it will not alter the Spanish nature.
