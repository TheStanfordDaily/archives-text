# INTERESTING SPEECH GIVEN BY DR. JORDAN
## Talk on Nationalism Given to Large Cosmopolitan Club Meeting 
### 
"The treaty of peace of the great war
must provide for a league of nations
whose first duty will he to take off th<*
rough edges of nationalism," was the
statement made by Dr. David Starr
Jordan in an address on "Nationalism
and the Future" at the Little Theater
Monday night.
"There are two aspects of national
