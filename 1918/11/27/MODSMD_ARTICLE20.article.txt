## FOOTBALL RALLY AND BONFIRE 
### 
The celebration last night in the As
sembly Hall marks the twenty-third big
football rally to be held on the campu
\hhough previous mass meetings and
i "jolly-ups" had been held, the most
| notable being that of November 17,
1893. the first so-called "big rally" was
called on November 12, 1895, by order
of the Executive Committee, and was
held in the chapel (Little Theater). A
program was planned with Dr. Jordan
as the chief speaker. This rally was
held for a twofold purpose, that of rais
ing enthusiasm for the game and fun ! ;
for band uniforms.
The rally of November 22. 1899, is
spoken of in the aDily Palo Alto as
'the regular big football rally to the
team," giving evidence that it had al
ready become a Stanford tradition.
Owing to the insufficient seating capac
ity in the chapel the doors were not
opened until 7 o'clock and none but
students and faculty members were ad
mitted.
The "after-rally celebration" dates
also from this 1899 meeting. A group!
of men gathered in the Encina Club
room under the leadership of \\ ill
Irwin, 'U9, and forming in a single
column lock-stepped to the /eta Psi
house, old Roble and Dr. Jordan's resi
dence.
November 27, 19(H), witnessed the lirsl
big rally to be held in the Assembly
Hall. Previous announcement was
made through the Daily Palo Alto that
"the entire balcony will be at the dis

posal of the women. Men students are
requested to occupy the seats down
stairs." Thus another time our Stan
ford custom was set.
hirst mention of an organized bon
fire and serpantine is made at this time
and was held on the old football field.
"Once on the Quad." says the report,
"the enthusiasm had to be vented in
some way. Long lines of students, each
man holding onto the man in front of
him, wound over the campus and foot
hall field shouting and singing. The
building of the bonfire from this time
on was gradually given into charge of
the freshmen and each year classes en
deavored to build a better and bigger
pile. Then in October. I'M7, a plea was
agitated on the campus that the bonlire
be abolished, as it"was wasteful and
unnecessary," especially during war con
ditions and the then present shortage
of wood. The subject was discusse 1
ill an editorial of the Daily Palo Al >
on October 23, and the suggestion was
made that the financial expenditure be
limited. On October 25 action was
taken by the Executive Committee, and
representatives from each house were
appointed to regulate the building . 112
the bonlire.
Various raids from the Cniversity of
California .the most memoriable occur
ring in 1914. when six Berkeley men
succeeded in setting off the pile a few
days in advance, have made it neces
sary to place guards over the bonfire
during e<instructn >n.
