"We arc going into this game to tight and win. The men will give nil
they've got in them. It's up to the student body to do the same."
COACH BADENOCH.

"Stanford may not have a better team, but she has a greater one." These
words of Yell Leader Kinny last night epitomized Stanford opinion regarding
the men who are to wear the Cardinal tomorrow on the field at Berkeley.
When Stanford appears on the gridiron tomorrow it will signify the return
of the Cardinal to its rightful place on the athletic map of the West. Tomor
row's game will be the first "big" game since 1914. It will be a treat that tin
present generation of Stanford men have not experienced.
Throughout the first American football season that Stanford lias participate!
in for fourteen years, the team with unequalled pluck and light has struggled
on undismayed against the most discouraging odds. Cutting down the scores of
the opposing teams in each successive game, the team has steadily improve
from a mass of green material to a football eleven of the first order.
TEAM HAS SHOWN TREMENDOUS EFFORT
It we are defeated tomorrow, it will be no mar on Stanford's athletic rec
ord. A team playing an entirely new game, unfamiliar entirely to many of it;
members, can hardly be expected to go through a winning season. It is this
team that will furnish the nucleus of winning teams in the future. What tin
team lias learned, during the short space of time allotted to it, combined with the
wonderful Stanford spirit, may produce a victory. A failure in the attempt u
pull a winning score out of tomorrow's game will be the fault of conditions, not
of the men involved.
As important as that that happens on the field will be that which is hap
pelting in the Stanford bleachers. The men on the field need the complete sup
port of the rooting section in the game. The behavior of tli Stanford bleachers
in a big game has always been given the most outside comment.
ROOTING STUNTS TO BE FEATURE
Yell Leader Kinny has prepared several rooting stunts. I'or the successful
execution of these it is necessary, that every one be in their places in the rooting
port of the rooting section in the game. The behavior of the Stanford bleachers
but special cars will be placed 011 the sidings so that seats tor all will be assured.
Unlike former big games, profits from the gate receipts will be given to ;•
war work. The United War Work campaign is to be the beneficiary, Buying
a ticket, according to the management, is the same as making a donation, with
the spectacle of the most important football game of the year in the Wert
thrown in.
TICKETS STILL ON SALE
Buttonhole bouquets, with Stanford colors, are to be 011 sale at the gam;' 1\
the Red Cross. Persons intending to purchase flowers are urged to wait until
they arrive at Berkeley.
Tickets for the game are still on sale at the Bookstore and Weingartner's in
Palo Alto. Reserved seats may be had for $2. Holders of season tickets may
get their for $1.50.
The most important phase of this Thanksgiving game is the presence of a
solid Stanford rooting section. Whether or not the team brings home the turkey
depends in the main part 011 the extent of the enthusiasm and forceful hackin.>;

"We arc going into this game to tight and win. The men will give nil
they've got in them. It's up to the student body to do the same."
COACH BADENOCH.

"Stanford may not have a better team, but she has a greater one." These
words of Yell Leader Kinny last night epitomized Stanford opinion regarding
the men who are to wear the Cardinal tomorrow on the field at Berkeley.
When Stanford appears on the gridiron tomorrow it will signify the return
of the Cardinal to its rightful place on the athletic map of the West. Tomor
row's game will be the first "big" game since 1914. It will be a treat that tin
present generation of Stanford men have not experienced.
Throughout the first American football season that Stanford lias participate!
in for fourteen years, the team with unequalled pluck and light has struggled
on undismayed against the most discouraging odds. Cutting down the scores of
the opposing teams in each successive game, the team has steadily improve
from a mass of green material to a football eleven of the first order.
TEAM HAS SHOWN TREMENDOUS EFFORT
It we are defeated tomorrow, it will be no mar on Stanford's athletic rec
ord. A team playing an entirely new game, unfamiliar entirely to many of it;
members, can hardly be expected to go through a winning season. It is this
team that will furnish the nucleus of winning teams in the future. What tin
team lias learned, during the short space of time allotted to it, combined with the
wonderful Stanford spirit, may produce a victory. A failure in the attempt u
pull a winning score out of tomorrow's game will be the fault of conditions, not
of the men involved.
As important as that that happens on the field will be that which is hap
pelting in the Stanford bleachers. The men on the field need the complete sup
port of the rooting section in the game. The behavior of tli Stanford bleachers
in a big game has always been given the most outside comment.
ROOTING STUNTS TO BE FEATURE
Yell Leader Kinny has prepared several rooting stunts. I'or the successful
execution of these it is necessary, that every one be in their places in the rooting
port of the rooting section in the game. The behavior of the Stanford bleachers
but special cars will be placed 011 the sidings so that seats tor all will be assured.
Unlike former big games, profits from the gate receipts will be given to ;•
war work. The United War Work campaign is to be the beneficiary, Buying
a ticket, according to the management, is the same as making a donation, with

TEAM HAS SHOWN TREMENDOUS EFFORT
It we are defeated tomorrow, it will be no mar on Stanford's athletic rec
ord. A team playing an entirely new game, unfamiliar entirely to many of it;
members, can hardly be expected to go through a winning season. It is this
team that will furnish the nucleus of winning teams in the future. What tin
team lias learned, during the short space of time allotted to it, combined with the
wonderful Stanford spirit, may produce a victory. A failure in the attempt u
pull a winning score out of tomorrow's game will be the fault of conditions, not
of the men involved.
As important as that that happens on the field will be that which is hap
pelting in the Stanford bleachers. The men on the field need the complete sup
port of the rooting section in the game. The behavior of tli Stanford bleachers
in a big game has always been given the most outside comment.
ROOTING STUNTS TO BE FEATURE
Yell Leader Kinny has prepared several rooting stunts. I'or the successful
execution of these it is necessary, that every one be in their places in the rooting
port of the rooting section in the game. The behavior of the Stanford bleachers
but special cars will be placed 011 the sidings so that seats tor all will be assured.
Unlike former big games, profits from the gate receipts will be given to ;•
war work. The United War Work campaign is to be the beneficiary, Buying
a ticket, according to the management, is the same as making a donation, with
the spectacle of the most important football game of the year in the Wert
thrown in.
TICKETS STILL ON SALE
Buttonhole bouquets, with Stanford colors, are to be 011 sale at the gam;' 1\
the Red Cross. Persons intending to purchase flowers are urged to wait until
they arrive at Berkeley.
Tickets for the game are still on sale at the Bookstore and Weingartner's in
Palo Alto. Reserved seats may be had for $2. Holders of season tickets may
get their for $1.50.
The most important phase of this Thanksgiving game is the presence of a
solid Stanford rooting section. Whether or not the team brings home the turkey
depends in the main part 011 the extent of the enthusiasm and forceful hackin.>;

"We arc going into this game to tight and win. The men will give nil
they've got in them. It's up to the student body to do the same."
COACH BADENOCH.

"Stanford may not have a better team, but she has a greater one." These
words of Yell Leader Kinny last night epitomized Stanford opinion regarding
the men who are to wear the Cardinal tomorrow on the field at Berkeley.
When Stanford appears on the gridiron tomorrow it will signify the return
of the Cardinal to its rightful place on the athletic map of the West. Tomor
row's game will be the first "big" game since 1914. It will be a treat that tin
present generation of Stanford men have not experienced.
Throughout the first American football season that Stanford lias participate!
in for fourteen years, the team with unequalled pluck and light has struggled
on undismayed against the most discouraging odds. Cutting down the scores of
the opposing teams in each successive game, the team has steadily improve
from a mass of green material to a football eleven of the first order.
