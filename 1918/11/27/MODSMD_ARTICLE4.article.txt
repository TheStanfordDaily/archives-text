"J. K. Lilly,
"President Associated Students,

"I deeply appreciate the outright
manly word of the students of Stan

to the University of California. The
act of defacement was grievous, but
its results will, we hope, not prove
irreparable. With your expression we
have all we could desire. Let me
plead for mercy toward the offenders.
The act was plainly one of impulse.
We have not always been blameless
ourselves. If we can only make this
the end of old irritations and tlie be
ginning of a new friendliness, it will
all have been pretty much worth
| while. Herewith my cordial greetings.
