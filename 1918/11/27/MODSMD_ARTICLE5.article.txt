# OLD TIME SPIRIT IS DISPLAYED AT BIG GAME RALLY
## NOISE GREETS VARSITY Stanford Turns Out to Give Team Good Send-off at Rally and Fire 
### 
From the time that the S. A. T. C.
marched into the assembly until Com
pany D gave the last serpentine around
the big blaze, pep and jazz were in
command at the Big Game rally last
night. The celebration lasted from 8:30
when the S. A. T. C. arrived until the
last ember of the blaze burnt out un
der the guard of the men of the civilian
unit.
To "Sons of the Stanford Red" the
men marched into the assembly and
started in to prove that seats were
made to stand on. With a yell for
Stanford varsity. Captain Holt, Coaches
Badenoch and Livernash, the noise
started. After several minutes of un
organized yelling Yell Leader Kinny
and his assistants succeeded in quiet'ng
the men, until Kinny introduced Van
derlynri Stowe, business manager of
the University and former Harvard
athlete. Mr. Stowe spoke of the Har
vard spirit of clean play and declared
Stanford had always seemed to him to
be the same. During his talk he spoke
of the dirtiest game of football he ever
saw. "It was in the year of '79, during
: the game between Harvard and Yale,
112 never saw dirtier football in my life
and I have seen California plav many
times.'' Again it was some time before
i the lower floor was willing to use the
' seats as they were originally intended,
| The speech ended with the words,
"Treat 'em rough, but play square, and
good luck to you."
The next sjKaker was Captain Parker.
He made himself very popular at the
beginning by proving himself an At
seer, when he opened his speech by
J saying. "Stanford will win the game
Thursday, California will be beaten in
the first quarter and held during the
rest of the game." Though the captain
had 110 such athletic record as Van
derlynn Stowe. he gave several i 111r
esting accounts of his own experience
at football.
Kinny next made a little speech all
by himself, which consisted of a quota
tion by Andy Smith, California coach:
"California has the better team, I think,
but Stanford has the greater team."
Kinny then gave the command for a
skyrocket for the star of the U. S. C
game. Captain "Pret" Holt. Then the
gang went wild. After the skyrocket
was given Holt took the stage.
He started out with his usual re
mark, "Well, gents," and before he could
get any farther the said gents gave him
such an ovation that speaking was im
possible for almost ten minutes. When
speaking was impossible "Prtit"' said
that if the Stanford spirit came out as
strong in the bleacher as it has in the
other games this season, the team would
show the Blue and Gold several ttbings
that they had never thought of before.
Coach Livemash was given a sky
rocket and then followed it with. "If
you boost the team as you've done be
fore California's blue will turn to green
with envy. And if you yell like you
are doing tonight I have little doubts
that the gold will turn to yellow."
Tt was several minutes before Klnnv
could introduce the next speaker. When
he was able to be heard he introduced
Coach Badenoch. The coach said that
he for one knew that Captain Parker
was right in his prophecies. He said
that the team was ready and able to
put up an exhibition of football that
would be worthy of the Stanford ideals.
Six big ones were given Jack Mc-
Dowell before he gave his short talk
to the team. "I have seen every big
game and rally for the last twenty-four
years and you men have one of the
hardest tasks before you. You must
win the California game after defeat,'
he said.
At a signal from Kinny the gang
started the serpentine to the fire, form
ing four abreast in back of the yell
leaders. The line of march led thr< ugh
Memorial Court, into the Inner Quad,
past the mess >all, to the field where
the efforts of '22 were going up in
smoke. Just as the headers of the ser
pentine reached the field the Califor
nian reposing at the end of a rope at
the top of the pile went up in flame.
After serpentin'ng around the bla/e
the gang gathered before Kinny and bis
assistants and sang "Hail, Stanford,
Hail."

"Treat 'em rough, but play square, and
good luck to you."
The next sjKaker was Captain Parker.
He made himself very popular at the
beginning by proving himself an At
seer, when he opened his speech by
J saying. "Stanford will win the game
Thursday, California will be beaten in
the first quarter and held during the
rest of the game." Though the captain
had 110 such athletic record as Van
derlynn Stowe. he gave several i 111r
esting accounts of his own experience
at football.
Kinny next made a little speech all
by himself, which consisted of a quota
tion by Andy Smith, California coach:
"California has the better team, I think,
but Stanford has the greater team."
Kinny then gave the command for a
skyrocket for the star of the U. S. C
game. Captain "Pret" Holt. Then the
gang went wild. After the skyrocket
was given Holt took the stage.
He started out with his usual re
mark, "Well, gents," and before he could
get any farther the said gents gave him
such an ovation that speaking was im
possible for almost ten minutes. When
speaking was impossible "Prtit"' said
that if the Stanford spirit came out as
strong in the bleacher as it has in the
other games this season, the team would
show the Blue and Gold several ttbings
that they had never thought of before.
Coach Livemash was given a sky
rocket and then followed it with. "If
you boost the team as you've done be
fore California's blue will turn to green
with envy. And if you yell like you
are doing tonight I have little doubts
that the gold will turn to yellow."
Tt was several minutes before Klnnv
could introduce the next speaker. When
he was able to be heard he introduced
Coach Badenoch. The coach said that
he for one knew that Captain Parker
was right in his prophecies. He said
that the team was ready and able to
put up an exhibition of football that
would be worthy of the Stanford ideals.
Six big ones were given Jack Mc-
Dowell before he gave his short talk
to the team. "I have seen every big
game and rally for the last twenty-four
years and you men have one of the
hardest tasks before you. You must
win the California game after defeat,'
he said.
At a signal from Kinny the gang
started the serpentine to the fire, form
ing four abreast in back of the yell
leaders. The line of march led thr< ugh
Memorial Court, into the Inner Quad,
past the mess >all, to the field where
the efforts of '22 were going up in
smoke. Just as the headers of the ser
pentine reached the field the Califor
nian reposing at the end of a rope at
the top of the pile went up in flame.
After serpentin'ng around the bla/e
the gang gathered before Kinny and bis
assistants and sang "Hail, Stanford,
Hail."
From the time that the S. A. T. C.
marched into the assembly until Com
pany D gave the last serpentine around
the big blaze, pep and jazz were in
command at the Big Game rally last
night. The celebration lasted from 8:30
when the S. A. T. C. arrived until the
last ember of the blaze burnt out un
der the guard of the men of the civilian
unit.
To "Sons of the Stanford Red" the
men marched into the assembly and
started in to prove that seats were
made to stand on. With a yell for
Stanford varsity. Captain Holt, Coaches
Badenoch and Livernash, the noise
started. After several minutes of un
organized yelling Yell Leader Kinny
and his assistants succeeded in quiet'ng
the men, until Kinny introduced Van
derlynri Stowe, business manager of
the University and former Harvard
athlete. Mr. Stowe spoke of the Har
vard spirit of clean play and declared
Stanford had always seemed to him to
be the same. During his talk he spoke
of the dirtiest game of football he ever
saw. "It was in the year of '79, during
: the game between Harvard and Yale,
112 never saw dirtier football in my life
and I have seen California plav many
times.'' Again it was some time before

fore California's blue will turn to green
with envy. And if you yell like you
are doing tonight I have little doubts
that the gold will turn to yellow."
Tt was several minutes before Klnnv
could introduce the next speaker. When
he was able to be heard he introduced
Coach Badenoch. The coach said that
he for one knew that Captain Parker
was right in his prophecies. He said
that the team was ready and able to
put up an exhibition of football that
would be worthy of the Stanford ideals.
Six big ones were given Jack Mc-
Dowell before he gave his short talk
to the team. "I have seen every big
game and rally for the last twenty-four
years and you men have one of the
hardest tasks before you. You must
win the California game after defeat,'
he said.
At a signal from Kinny the gang
started the serpentine to the fire, form
ing four abreast in back of the yell
leaders. The line of march led thr< ugh
Memorial Court, into the Inner Quad,
past the mess >all, to the field where
the efforts of '22 were going up in
smoke. Just as the headers of the ser
pentine reached the field the Califor
nian reposing at the end of a rope at
the top of the pile went up in flame.
After serpentin'ng around the bla/e
the gang gathered before Kinny and bis
assistants and sang "Hail, Stanford,
Hail."
From the time that the S. A. T. C.
marched into the assembly until Com
pany D gave the last serpentine around
the big blaze, pep and jazz were in
command at the Big Game rally last
night. The celebration lasted from 8:30
when the S. A. T. C. arrived until the
last ember of the blaze burnt out un
der the guard of the men of the civilian
unit.
To "Sons of the Stanford Red" the
men marched into the assembly and
started in to prove that seats were
made to stand on. With a yell for
Stanford varsity. Captain Holt, Coaches
Badenoch and Livernash, the noise
started. After several minutes of un
organized yelling Yell Leader Kinny
and his assistants succeeded in quiet'ng
the men, until Kinny introduced Van
derlynri Stowe, business manager of
the University and former Harvard
athlete. Mr. Stowe spoke of the Har
vard spirit of clean play and declared
Stanford had always seemed to him to
be the same. During his talk he spoke
of the dirtiest game of football he ever
saw. "It was in the year of '79, during
: the game between Harvard and Yale,
112 never saw dirtier football in my life
and I have seen California plav many
times.'' Again it was some time before
i the lower floor was willing to use the
' seats as they were originally intended,
| The speech ended with the words,
"Treat 'em rough, but play square, and
good luck to you."
The next sjKaker was Captain Parker.
He made himself very popular at the
beginning by proving himself an At
seer, when he opened his speech by
J saying. "Stanford will win the game
Thursday, California will be beaten in
the first quarter and held during the
rest of the game." Though the captain
had 110 such athletic record as Van
derlynn Stowe. he gave several i 111r
esting accounts of his own experience
at football.
Kinny next made a little speech all
by himself, which consisted of a quota
tion by Andy Smith, California coach:
"California has the better team, I think,
but Stanford has the greater team."
Kinny then gave the command for a
skyrocket for the star of the U. S. C
game. Captain "Pret" Holt. Then the
gang went wild. After the skyrocket
was given Holt took the stage.
He started out with his usual re
mark, "Well, gents," and before he could
get any farther the said gents gave him
such an ovation that speaking was im
possible for almost ten minutes. When
speaking was impossible "Prtit"' said
that if the Stanford spirit came out as
strong in the bleacher as it has in the
other games this season, the team would
show the Blue and Gold several ttbings
that they had never thought of before.
Coach Livemash was given a sky
rocket and then followed it with. "If
you boost the team as you've done be
fore California's blue will turn to green
with envy. And if you yell like you
are doing tonight I have little doubts
that the gold will turn to yellow."
