The action of an irresponsible group of undergraduates who defaced the
memorial buildings at the University of California last Sunday night is regretted
by every friend of this University. We cannot have it go abroad that Stan
ford is responsible for such conduct, or that the band that daubed the Campanile
is in any way representative of Stanford spirit. That it is not is clearly evi
denced by the fact that the act has been condemned by every student who has
known of the affair. The apologies of Stanford were certainly due the Uni
versity of California for the deed of vandalism committed by a thoughtless few,
and the fact that they were sent by the Student # Council, acting for the student
body, should give satisfaction to all.
It is a curious sidelight on the attitude of the public toward colleges that
the act has been thought of by persons unconnected with the universities as
merely an ordinary "college prank." The general public seems still to get its
ideas of college life from the pages of George Fitch. It is doubtless due to this
fact that Stanford has not come in for more severe condemnation. But inter
collegiate relations have passed beyond the age of barbarism, and mutilation of
university property is no longer regarded as legitimate warfare, even in the pre-
Big Game campaigns.
The Daily Palo Alto, however, is not one of those which howls for blood
when the wrong has been done. In normal times such an act would call for
severe dealing, but with traditions in abeyance as at present, and rules for the
conduct of hostilities with California forgotten, we may conclude that ignorance
and heedlessness, rather than malice, were responsible for the misdeed. The
fact that Stanford has formerly suffered from similar outrages may explain, but
cannot excuse the offense. We assume that the parties who took part in the
affair now realize that their action cast a reflection 011 the Stanford student
body. and. stand ready to make whatever atonement they can. Whatever action
is necessary to California's satisfaction and Stanford's honor should be taken,
and the whole unfortunate episode forgotten as soon as possible.
