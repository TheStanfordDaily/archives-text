Sixteen students from the public
speaking classes who have been special
izing in the "four minute" work have
been selected bv "Professor Bassett to
give four minute talks on the campus.
These students several of whom are
women, have been selected*from among
the best speakers in these classes.
These people have been selected to
do this work in response to a request
from the government that the univer
sities start four minute speeches among
their students. They have already spo
ken in behalf of the fourth Liberty Loan
and the War Work Campaign before
the various campus groups and will in
all probability be called on again to
speak during the next Red Cross drive,

services of those making successful
speeches by awarding them a certificate
and a "Four Minute" badge.
