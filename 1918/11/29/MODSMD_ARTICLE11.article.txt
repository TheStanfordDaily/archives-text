# STANFORD CRUSHED 67 TO 0
## Day Shows Old Spirit of Big Games Returned 
### 
Stanford's first big game with California since the break, and the first Amer
ican game for fourteen years, is over. And the result was just what was ex
pected. Perhaps there was a sneaking hope among some of the adherents of
the Cardinal that the team would spring a surprise on their opponents, and
that Stanford would meet the Blue and Gold on something like equal terms
Such hopes, if hopes they were, were grievously disappointed, for it was appar
ent from the minute play began that California had an eleven superior to Stan
ford's in every department of the game. Occasional spurts of real football were
displayed by the Stanford men, notably in the second quarter, when the team
made its yards consistently for a while. But for the tearing through the Stan
ford line for spectacular gains. That California's final score was 67 was the
result of superior weight and football, and not to luck.
END RUNS ARE DISASTROUS
Contrary to expectations, however ,the greatest gains were made by the
Bruins in end runs rather than line smashes. The invincible Sprott was worked
as hard as ever, but, changing tactics from the game with Oregon last Saturday,
he was sent around the ends of the Cardinal line instead of through the center,
except when near the goalpost, but in every instance for heavy gains. Watson,
Hoover. Gordon, and Barnes of California showed themselves American play
ers of the first order, but the San Diego star was unmistakably the hero of the
day. Stanford could not seem to tackle Sprott, and he was given splendid sup
port. Patrick, Holt, Flood, and Clarke, showed up well for Stanford, but they
were up against a hopeless task and no amount of individual brilliancy could
have radically changed the score. But the men fought to the end without waver
ing or losing spirit, and the bleachers yelled just as hard as though Stanford
had been on the heavy end of the score board numerals.
FINE SPIRIT SHOWN
There was no mistaking the presence of the old Stanford spirit, and after all
that was the main thing the University went there for. Nothing but praise has
been said about the conduct of the crowd in the west bleachers. J. E. McDowell,
speaking for the alumni, said that never in his twenty-two years of Stanford
experience, had he seen a better spirit shown, even in those days when a Car
dinal victory was the regular thing.
The crowd never lost its breath nor its good temper as the score mounted
higher and higher, and a group of sailors who risked their lives by insulting
the Cardinal in front of the rooting section were permitted to walk out un
molested.
Next year, as things look now, there will be another big game, and by
then Stanford will have a team that will be able to fight with any on equal
terms. But the first big game is over .and Stanford has everything to be proud
of and nothing to be ashamed of as to her part in it.
