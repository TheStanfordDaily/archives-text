Those prophets of gloom whose cry it lias been all along that the old Stan
ford spirit was dead were overwhelmed in confusion yesterday. For without
undue self-congratulation, we may well >ay that the conduct of the west bleach
ers in the face of sure and overwhelming defeat was all that could be desired by
the most adrent alumnus. And there was no unpleasantness nor animosity in
California's celebration of triumph in an unequal contest.
It looks as though the big game is back to stay.
