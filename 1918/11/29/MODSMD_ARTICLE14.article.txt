# LET'S BE THERE TOMORROW
## 
### 
Natural interest in the big game with the Berkeley' institution seemingly has
blinded us to the fact that the Rugby series with Santa Clara is going on at
present. Last year we played but one game of Rugby with Santa Clara, and this
was the big game of the year. This year we play a series of three with the
Mission college. The first was won by Santa Clara by an 8 to 3 score. It's up
to Stanford to win the next one on the homegrounds tomorrow. Let's be there
and find out about it anyhow. At any rate the K'ore won't sound anything like
67 to 0.
