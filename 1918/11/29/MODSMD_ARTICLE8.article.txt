# PLAYS OF THE BIG GAME BY QUARTERS
## LIEUT. ARTHUR BADENOCH. 
### 
(Coach of Stanford Team)
"The result was about what I
expected. We had almost all green
men and only twenty-four days in
whiqh to shape them. I want to
thank our boys for fighting as
hard as they could and thanks
are due the Stanford roters for
standing by the team so loyally
when the odds were all in favor of
California."
