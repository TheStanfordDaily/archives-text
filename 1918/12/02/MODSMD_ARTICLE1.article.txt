## DOCTORS TO GIVE TESTS No Men to Be Mustered Out Until Representatives Return With Report

Two officers of the medical corps of
the U. S. Army arrived here today, to
give men in the S. A. T. C. their physi
cal examination prior to their dismis
sal. This action is a part of govern
ment routine in matters of mustering
out. The report of these doctors is to
be filed to prove that men at the time
of their dismissal are in as good physi
cal condition as at the time of their
entrance.
No definite instructions as to the
manner of disbanding the S. A. T. C.
have been received as yet. No men
will be dismissed until Lieutenants
Mitchell and Erskine have returned
from a conference now in progress at
the S. A. T. C. headquarters in the Mo
nadnock building. San Francisco. Rep
resentatives from the five states in the
Pacific Coast division are now settling
the final details of the demobilization
of the S. A. T. C.
Tomorrow night Lieutenant Helm, of
the Committee on Education, Washing
ton. D. C., will address the men of the
S. A. T. C. on the subject of insurance.
He will urge the fact 011 the men that
their insurance taken out in the time
of war with the government will be
just as secure and valuable in peace
times.
As yet no orders have been received
by the naval unit of the S. A. T. C. re
garding demobilization, but word is ex
pected at any time.
