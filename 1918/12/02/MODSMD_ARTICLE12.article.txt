# SECOND GAME OF RUGBY SERIES GOES TO SANTA CLARA
## STANFORD LOSES 14-3 Small Crowd Witnesses Fast Game Saturday Afternoon on Local Field 
### 
In the last of the practice games
with Santa Clara, Stanford was de
feated by the score of 14-3. The game
was hard fought throughout, and if
Stanford can keep up the game that
she put up during the first half, she
will give the mission school a hard
fight for the bacon when the two
teams meet next Saturday in the big
rugby game of the season. Though
beaten in the two practice games this
season, the addition of Flood, Patiick,
Henry, Watts and Nuss, who have
been playing on the American team,
makes the team look one hundred per
cent better.
"Randy" Flood and "Babe" Henry
are of last year's Varsity fifteen and
are the men for their positions. Pat
rick and Watts played on last year's
freshman team, while Nuss carries a
reputation of being as good at rugby
as he is at American football.

Patrick and Henry Are Stars
The work of La Oorte and Larry
featured Santa Clara's game, while
Patrick, Henry and Ratner put up the
best game for Stanford.
Substitutes were used freely by
both sides, by arrangements made be
fore the game. The teams lined up
at the start as follows:
Stanford — Santa Clara —
Van Clief lock La Corte
Wood Breakaway Kerclioff
Clark,
Parker center three* Grace
Schofield fullback Volkmore..
Patrick halfback Pipes
Green five-eighths Diaz
Kocher, Larry,
Ratner front rank Ferrarrio
Henry, O'Connell
Swift rear rank Kaney
Robertson, Hovlev,
Kelly wings Bedolla
Gibbs. Judge,
Meyers .. .winged forward Whelan
Referee, Flannigan.
In the last of the practice games
with Santa Clara, Stanford was de
feated by the score of 14-3. The game
was hard fought throughout, and if
Stanford can keep up the game that
she put up during the first half, she
will give the mission school a hard
fight for the bacon when the two
teams meet next Saturday in the big
rugby game of the season. Though
beaten in the two practice games this
season, the addition of Flood, Patiick,
Henry, Watts and Nuss, who have
been playing on the American team,
makes the team look one hundred per
cent better.
"Randy" Flood and "Babe" Henry
are of last year's Varsity fifteen and
are the men for their positions. Pat
rick and Watts played on last year's
freshman team, while Nuss carries a
reputation of being as good at rugby
as he is at American football.
Saturday's game was and
hard fought, especially during the first
half.
Santa Clara Scores First
The first touchdown was made after
five minutes of hard playing. Stan
ford kicked off and kept the pigskin
in the mission boys' territory until
Diaz, Larry and Captain La Corte
carried the ball almost the entire
length of the field without a stop.
Diaz scored the touchdown, but Volk
more failed to convert it.
After fighting over the ball in the
center of the field for several min
utes, Henry and Patrick succeeded in
pushing the ball over Santa Clara's
goal for Stanford's first and only
score. Henry carried the ball over
the line, but Patrick could not con
vert.
The half ended a few minutes later
with the ball in the middle of the field
and the score a tie, three all. The
first period of the game was featured
by Patrick's fine kicking for Stanford
and by the work of the Santa Clara
team during the scrum, together with
Captain La Corte's fine wortc at lock.
Parker Receives Scalp Wound
During the second half things were
easier for Santa Clara. Larry and
La Corte made touchdowns in the first
few minutes of play, but Volkmore
failed to convert either. During the
play Parker was carried out with a
scalp wound. It is a nasty cut, but
not thought serious. Toward the end
of the game Larry made his second
touchdown, which Volkmore convert
ed. During the last three minutes of
play Stanford made a desperate effort
to put the leather over the Mission
line, but failed on account of the blow
ing of the timekeeper's whistle.
