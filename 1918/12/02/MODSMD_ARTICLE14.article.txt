# THE 						TRANSITION PERIOD
## 
### 
It took eighteen months from the declaration of war for Stanford to trans
form herself completely to a war status, and we cannot hope to return to tlu*
old peace conditions overnight. While the hope is to do away with all vestiges
of war as soon as possible.and start the winds of freedom blowing again at the
first opportunity, certain material facts stand in the way of a return to the Stan
ford of 1916 at once.
The chief reason for the admitted demoralization in student affairs last year
was the absence of any considerable number of responsible upperclassmen. This
condition will again prevail to some extent in the months immediately after the
demobilization of the S. A. T. C. The Stanford men in France, and most of
them on active duty throughout the United States, will not be able to get back
to the farm by the first of Jaanuary, and the student body for the most part will
be composed of women and ex-S. A. T. C. members, consisting of underclassmen
in the very great majority. The duty of student discipline was taken over by
the faculty last spring for the duration of the war. We doubt greatly if it
would prove feasible to return this duty to the students immediately at the lie
ginning of the new year. Certainly the powers of student discipline should be
exercised by no student organization other than a properly constituted body on
the lines of the old Men's Conference.
There are many other problems which will come up in this transitoin period,
Fraternities will probably have to combine to meet expenses during the titru'
before their men begin to return from service. In finding solutions for these
questions all the wisdom of the student body must be brought to bear to avoid
mistakes.
