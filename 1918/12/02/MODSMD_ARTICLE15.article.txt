# ALUMNI APPROVE OF RETURN TO BIG GAME

### 
That the alumni asociations of
both Stanford and California gradu
ates were heartily in favor of the re
turn to the Big Game and supported
the elevens who battled yesterday
was evidenced by a telegram sent
the elevens who battled Thursday
by the Stanford and California alum
ni associations in Washington, D. C.
The telegram was read to the
crowds in both bleachers before the
game was called.
President Ray Lyman Wilbur:
Forty Stanford and California men at
a joint banquet in Washington send
greetings to both varsity teams and
rejoice in the renewal of athletic re
lations. Victory to the better team.
Signed by Frank Hess, president of
Stanford Alumni Asociation of the;
District of Columbia, and Walter P.'
Talyor, president of Columbia Coun
cil of University of California.
It has been the custom for many
years for the alumni associations
throughout the United States to hold
banquets on the eve of the big game
and to send telegrams with wishes
for success. New York, Chicago,
Los Angeles, Washington and other
cities have large Stanford Alumni
Associations who* remain. loyal in
