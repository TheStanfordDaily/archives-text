# DR. JORDAN WRITES PROPHETIC LETTER ON GERMAN AFFAIRS
## 
### 
A letter written by David Starr Jor
dan was sent to Mr. Karl Matlie in
Chicago, secretary of the Friends of
German Democracy in that city, a prom
inent citizen of German descent in the
Middle West and an untiring champion
of the cause of German democracy. In
publishing the letter the American
Friends of German Democracy have in
mind a two-fold purpose, namely, that
this document may be a word of advice
to the Americans of German blood to
whom Dr. Jordan is a true friend, also
a word of warning to the Germans in
German lands, against a system which
nobody knows better than Dr. Jordanâ€”
a system which has poisoned the Ger
man people and caused it to bleed to
death. Extracts from the letter follow:
"Since Hengist and Horsa came over
from Saxony, 1 have not had a single
German ancestor; all are English. 1
have, however, given lectures in Ger
fnany in behalf of democracy and in
what 1 thought was the German lan
guage. This experience showed me that
the spirit of '48 was still alive, in South
ern Germany at least, and ready to burst
forth when the time should come. Not
much is possible in wartime, for every
thing in Germany is clamped down, but
when the soldiers or those that are left
of them return, there will be a demand
for an accounting which no autocrat
can face."
"We may appeal to Americans of
German descent in the name of na
tional patriotism. We may call on
them to rally with other Americans to
the support of this country, their coun
try as well as ours. Very few will be
called to the appeal But there is some
thing more which is quite as important.
We must also plead in the name of the
higher patriotism, the welfare and
progress of the world."
