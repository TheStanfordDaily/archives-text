## THE
						PLUG UGLY 
### 
The Plug-Ugly, the former famous
annual upperclass show and rush, be
came a dead tradition in the fall of
1915 through an overwhelming vote
against it by the seniors and juniors.
There wa sa time years ago when the
Plug-Ugly had a purpose.
The first, given October, 1898. by the:
class of 19(X), was in the nature >112 a|
play and was for the purpose, as staled
in the Daily Palo Alto "of arousing,
class enthusiasm and attempting by
means of this ceremony not only to re-j
vive the custom of the junior plugs, but
to encourage members to wear them
throughout the year.'
The welding together of upperclass
men by a good natured spirit of rivalry, |
mixed with fun, was the idea of the J
founders of the Plug-Ugly .and as such |
they had in mind the establishment of
a college custom that would in time at
least attain high rank. There was no
intention of having a class rush, or of
smashing hats, bnt rather the idea of
a rising and proper dedication of the
plugs. The best literary talent in the
class wrote the production, and hits
were scored on local celebrities, espe
cially members of the senior class.

The custom of a poster was started
by the class of 1903. Referring to the
play of that year the Daily said: "After
the show some good natured smashing
took place on the Quad." The follow
ing year it says, "Seniors rushed from
the bleachers after the play and trii;! to
I smash plugs. The long line of juniors,
as was the custom, wound its way about
j the campus into the Quad, followed by
the seniors and two underclasses."
In 1906 the report says,."The play
was not as good as last year, but the
struggle was the best that has taken
j place." Thus we see tha tthe original
j idea of the Plug-Uglies was slipping
j into the background and the rush and
I fight becoming the main feature.

In 1910 the Student Conference ap
pointed a board to regulate the upper
classmen rush and in 1911-1912 addi
tions were made to these rules. With
the abolition of a s'how in 1914 the
Plug-Ugly lost all semblance of its
former self. It became not only de
moralizing to student activities, but it
was a poor example to underclassmen.
In 1915 the continuance of the Plug-
Uglies was discussed and in an upper
class election it was overwhelmingly
voted out.
