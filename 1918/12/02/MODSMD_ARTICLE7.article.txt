Roscoe Arbuckle folowed on the
screen in"The Country Hero," which
furnished the humor for the evening's
program.
In speaking of the signing of the
armistice and America's part in the
world war. Judge Wilbur said: "In
comparison with the other Allied na
tions who have fought in this war, the
United States has paid but little in
the final toll. It is true that we en
tered at a critical time and that we
did much to turn the tide of the Great
War, but we must not fall into the
American sin of toasting and say that
we won the war. Our greatest work
is yet to come, for the glory of Amer
ica will finally be told in her recon
struction program, when our men and
resources will be taxed to the utmost.
Our responsibility has become the
heavier because we have the re
sources with which to rebuild the de
struction of the Huns as no other na
tion has."
In discussing the reconstruction
problems and methods which of neces
sity are foremost in the minds of the
thinking people of the world, Judge
