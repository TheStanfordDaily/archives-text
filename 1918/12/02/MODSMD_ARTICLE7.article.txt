# Stirring Address Given by Wilbur
## Judge of Supreme Court Is Speaker on "Challenge of the Hour" 
### 
Judge Curtis I). Wilbur, member of
the Supreme Court bench of Califor
nia and brother of President Wilbur,
spoke on the "Challenge of the Hour"
last Friday night at the Assembly Hall
under the auspices of the Y. M. C. A.
Roscoe Arbuckle folowed on the
screen in"The Country Hero," which
furnished the humor for the evening's
program.
In speaking of the signing of the
armistice and America's part in the
world war. Judge Wilbur said: "In
comparison with the other Allied na
tions who have fought in this war, the
United States has paid but little in
the final toll. It is true that we en
tered at a critical time and that we
did much to turn the tide of the Great
War, but we must not fall into the
American sin of toasting and say that
we won the war. Our greatest work
is yet to come, for the glory of Amer
ica will finally be told in her recon
struction program, when our men and
resources will be taxed to the utmost.
Our responsibility has become the
heavier because we have the re
sources with which to rebuild the de
struction of the Huns as no other na
tion has."
In discussing the reconstruction
problems and methods which of neces
sity are foremost in the minds of the
thinking people of the world, Judge
Wilbur pointed out the new aspect
which the missionary work of the
world has taken on. A new world
construction will have to take place,
and the foundation for an understand-!
ing of world ideals and democracy has
been laid by the missionaries of the<
last century and a half.
"The work of the missionary is far
broader than evangelism," said Judg<> j
Wilbur; "it is the building of a new
civilization. It is only through the
work of the missionary in this new;
sense that the hordes of Asia can be'
kept in check and that the world be'
spared the horror of a new German J
menace. Four hundred million people
must be Christianized in the Orient to
meet the new standards of world
ideals, or they will prove themselves'
a greater danger to the civilization of
the world than did Kultur."
