Chaparral's "Rest in Peace" number
will appear tomorrow. It will be on
sale on the Quad, at the Bookstore,
and in the company exchanges. Due
to its increased size, the price of this
issue will be 35 cents.
A clever cover has been executed
by Miss Ruth Taylor, '19, for this
issue. The Kaiser is shown being low
ered into his grave by a jubilant Chap
pie. "Monk" Antrim, '19, also has con
tributed a double-page colection of car
toons entitled "When the Boys Come
Home." The title alone seems full of
rich possibilities, and "Monk" has
made the best of his.opportunity.
"Milt" Hagen, '15, an old Hammer
and Coffin man, has contributed a
poem, "It's 'L' to be a Chappie Man."
"Les'' Levy, '19, and George Kocher,
'19, have both done some good pieces
of work for this issue. Levy's princi
pal contribution is "A Tough Tragedy,"
or "A Romance of Food."
"Chappie' has produced his version
of an University Calendar. Needless to
say, University authorities disclaim
any responsibility for any of the func
tion that he schedules there.
"Sam" Briggs, '19, last year's editor,
has an excellent little poem, "Confes
sion l'Future,'' in the "Rest in Peace"
issue. It deals with the troubles of the
married man who returns from the war
and is trying to find something to do
with his wife. It is a clever situation,
cleverly handled
A large number of contributions by
non-member of Hammer and Coffin is
one of the features of this issue. Some
of the new blood that has contributed
is R. L. Wiel, '22. "Lorry" Hall, *20,
W. J. Classen. '21. and A. J. Harzfeld.
'19.

ral to men in the army camps. Postage
will be paid to any part of the globe
by the Hammer and Coffin society.
Due to the fact of this being the only
issue this year, the "Chappie" men as
sert that this number will surpass all
previous efforts.
