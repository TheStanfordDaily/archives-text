### 
Commandants have been authorized
to release from active duty all naval
reserves in naval units and naval sec
tions of the S. A. T. C. who so desire.
This information was received here
yesterday in a telegram from the head
quarters of the twelfth naval district.
Regular navy men who enlisted for the
perid of the war, who are in these
untis, may also be discharged.
For the time being commanders are
to hold in abeyance the disposition of
four-year men and of reservist and
period of the war men who do not de
sire discharge or inactive duty at the
present time. The exact date of the
release of the local naval unit men has
not been announced as yet, but it will
probably be in the near future.
Final plans for the demobilization of
the S. A. T. C. have not been settled as
yet. Under the order given out a week
ago, however, all men in the S. A. T. C.
have to be mustered out by December
21. Lieutenants Morse Erskine and G.
G. Mitchell who have been attending a
general conference of the Pacific Coast
division of the S. A. T. C. in San Fran
cisco to settle questions arising from the
mustering out of the men have not re
turned as yet. Captain Parker expects
them to return, however, late today.
On their return all the details of the
demobilization will be announced.
In the meantime Captains I'. L. Hum
phreyville and L. A. Anthony of the
medical corps of the U. S. Army, with
the assistance of Drs. Reynolds and
Kirk of Palo Alto, have been examining
men of the S. A. T. C. at the rate of
seventy a day prior to their dismissal.
No policy as yet has been laid down
by the University authorities in regard
to the amount of military training that
will be required from undergraduate
students beginning the winter quarter.
However, Dean McDowell stated to
day that he thought that eventually the
old pre-war requirement of three hours
of military training a week with the
alternative of gymnasium for under
classmen would be in force.

untis, may also be discharged.
For the time being commanders are
to hold in abeyance the disposition of
four-year men and of reservist and
period of the war men who do not de
sire discharge or inactive duty at the
present time. The exact date of the
release of the local naval unit men has
not been announced as yet, but it will
probably be in the near future.
Final plans for the demobilization of
the S. A. T. C. have not been settled as
yet. Under the order given out a week
ago, however, all men in the S. A. T. C.
have to be mustered out by December
21. Lieutenants Morse Erskine and G.
G. Mitchell who have been attending a
general conference of the Pacific Coast
division of the S. A. T. C. in San Fran
cisco to settle questions arising from the
mustering out of the men have not re
turned as yet. Captain Parker expects
them to return, however, late today.
On their return all the details of the
demobilization will be announced.
In the meantime Captains I'. L. Hum
phreyville and L. A. Anthony of the
medical corps of the U. S. Army, with
the assistance of Drs. Reynolds and
Kirk of Palo Alto, have been examining
men of the S. A. T. C. at the rate of
seventy a day prior to their dismissal.
No policy as yet has been laid down
by the University authorities in regard
to the amount of military training that
will be required from undergraduate
students beginning the winter quarter.
However, Dean McDowell stated to
day that he thought that eventually the
old pre-war requirement of three hours
of military training a week with the
alternative of gymnasium for under
classmen would be in force.
