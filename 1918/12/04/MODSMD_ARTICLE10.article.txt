# Big Rugby Battle Coming Saturday
## Stanford Goes Out to Defeat Santa Clara in Last Game of Series 
### 
All Stanford is expccted to journey
to San Francisco next Saturday, when
for the benefit of War Work, Stanford
and Santa Clara will meet for the third
time in a Rugby contest, at Ewing
Field.
Ihe event will be staged on this neu
tral territory as two games have al
ready been played, one at Santa Clara
and the other at Stanford. Both games
resulted in victories for the Mission
college, the first by a score of 8-3 and
the second wheih took place last Satur
day, by a score of 14-3.
Coach Flannagan of the Knights or
Columbus has been working hard with
his men and. although they are doing
good work, they will have to do a great
deal better to beat Santa Clara, as has
been clearly shown by the results of the
preliminary contests. Flood, Henry,
Patrick, Watts and Nuss, who have all
starred in American football this quar
ter, are now out for Rugby and with
their help the Ruggers should be one
hundred per cent better. The first two
of these men were on the varsity last
year ,and all the others have had Rugb\
experience.
