# THE
						REAL STANFORD
## 
### 
It is reported that a large percentage of the freshman members of the S. A.
T. C. say that they will not come back to Stanford after Christmas. If this is
true, it means that they have been imperfectly inoculated with the Stanford
spirit during the weeks that they have been here.
A feeling that college is not as much as it had been reported to be is only
natural in these men. They have not seen the University in other condition than
that of an intensive military camp ,and, valuable though such an institution may
be to the nation, it is not of such a nature that many persons would be anxious
to spend four or live years therein.
But the real Stanford is not a military camp, or anything like a military
camp. This has been its appearance only for a few brief weeks when national
necessity was pressing. When the demobilization of the Students' Army Training
Corps is completed in the next few Stanford will begin the transformation
back to the old Stanford beloved by thousands of men and women throughout
the world,—the old civilian Stanford where the "Winds of Freedom Blow." To
be sure times are changing and universities, like everything else, must change;
with them. Externally, the Stanford of 1919 will perhaps be widely different}
from the Stanford of 1909, but the spirit will be the same, broadened and deep
ened by the crisis we have just passed through.
Men who say they will not return to college because they do not like the»
life they have experienced in the past two months disclose a lack of apprecia-'
tion of what a university is.
