# ABOUT STANFORD
## THE 						STANFORD MUSEUM 
### 
Su university in this country can
boast of so magnificent or famous a
museum as can Stanford. The stately
' Elding situated north of the Quad
rangle. with its massive stone pillars
and beautiful marble vestibule is well
known to all students and sightseers.
The origin of the Museum collection
dates from 1880 when young Leland,
being then eleven years of age, accom
panied his parents to Europe. During
this trip he conceived the idea of
bringing away from each place visited
some object of interest. He had no
definite plan at that time, but later the
idea of making a worth-while collection
arose. He received encouragement
from his mother and on his return to
California in 1882 he set to work ar
ranging and cataloguing the various
purchases he had made.
It now became Leland's chief ambi
tion to establish a collection that would
in time compare with any in this coun
try and even in Europe. In 1883 he
made a second visit to Europe and dur

ing this time some of the most noted
additions were made. The Egyptian
bronzes, Greek statuettes, and Greek
and Roman glass are some of the best
tn i>e found anywhere and show great
judgment in selection. Leland began
the himous Chinese and Japanese col
lection which Mrs. Stanford later com
pleted.
Mrs. Stanford during her life always
took a special interest in the growth of
the Museum and most of her travels
were made with the object' of adding
to it.he bine Arts collection was
gathered mainly by her and the many
Madonnas, copies of old masters, are
especially fine. Additions' have been
made by Charles Lathrop, Anna La
throp Hewes, Thomas Welton Stanford
, and others.
The Stanford Museum is unique in
that it contains the personal papers and
possession of Senator and Mrs. Stan
ford and of Leland, Jr.. all of which
is of especial interest to students. Pe
dro J I.emos, artist and collector, is the
I present curator of the Museum.
