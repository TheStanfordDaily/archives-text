I of anarchy which knows no hounds ex
| cept that of class against class; to
maintain peace in those sections which
are to be policed by our men, thus giv
ing them the protection which they have
a right to demand and expect; and to
j establish a stable government in Ger
many so that she may be able to pay
in time her just debts to the civilized
world."
In speaking of the food conditions
throughout the worljl, Mr. Merritt di
vided the nations of the world into four
groups ,the Allies, the lesser Allies, of
which Serbia, Belgium, and Poland are
in the greatest need, the neutrals, the
enemy countries, and the uncertain
countries as Russia, Norway, and Swe
den. He outlined the conditions in each
group, the most striking of which were
Finland and the Central Powers.
"The greatest tragedy of the war has
come upo nthe world since the signing
of the armistice," Mr. Merritt said,
for in Finland alone ten million people,
according to Mr, Hoover's own per
sonal statement, will starve this winter.
Their ports arc frozen and there is no
means of transportation with which to
reach these people and they have no
food.
"Germany as a whole is not starving.
Curiously enough it is Prussia and
Austria which are reaping the harvest
of their own ambitions. Hungary lias
refused fond to Austria and the Ger
man states, particularly Bavaria and
Saxony, will not permit food to go to
I Prussia."
In conclusion Mr. Merritt made an
'appeal to the people of the United States
to live tip to their unpaid obligation of
sending food to the stricken people of
Europe, which could only be accom
plished through the voluntary co-opera
tion of the people in conservation.
