# FRANK O'CONNEL, '17, NOT AMONG MISSING
## 
### 
A short time ago Lieutenant Frank
O'Oonnel, '17, was reported missing.
However, a letter received from O'Con
uel contradicts this statement. The
letter was written October 20, at which
time he wfÂ»s in the aviation service in
France and in perfect health. The
cause of the false report was a confu
sion of his name with that of a lieu
tenant in the infantry. O'Connel was a
law major and registered from Moun
tain View.
