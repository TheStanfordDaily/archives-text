# "Rest in Peace Chappie Satisfies
## 
### 
That Chaparral is to be congratulat
ed on her "Rest in Peace" issue which
appeared on Quad yesterday is the
opinion of its readers on the campus
yesterday. Ruth Taylor's cover de
picting the Kaiser being hammered into
his coffin by "Chappie" was deliciously
clever as a Hammer and Coffin subject
Antrim's cartoons; "The Guns," a
poem by "Lanse" Warren. '17, and most
of the other contributions were the
equal of any other issues of Chaparral
in more settled times. It was announced
today that a few more issues are still on
sale at the Bookstore.
