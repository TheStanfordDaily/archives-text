# Stanford Raises $8000 Above Quota
## Big Game Brings Stanford War Work Subscription Up to $20,000 
### 
With the $9,000 received from the
receipts of the Big Game, Stanford
has gone considerably over the top in
the United War Work Campaign
Fund, according to the report of Pro
lessor R. L. Green, treasurer. Over
$11,000 out of the minimum quota of
$12,000 was raised on the campus, and
the additional money added gives
Stanford the total of $20,000. Tn com
parison. the University of California
has fallen betow considerably, for she
still lacks $9,000 of her quota.
December pledges are due tomor
row and are payable to either Profes
sor Green at the Y. M. C. A. office in
the Union or to Mrs. Ethel Ewell at
the Women's Club House. Mrs. Ewell
has been appointed assistant treasurer
for the collection of funds to facili
tate the women in paying their
pledges. The money is needed badly
in the war work carried on by the
seven organizations, and an early pay
ment of the pledges will be particu
larly appreciated.
