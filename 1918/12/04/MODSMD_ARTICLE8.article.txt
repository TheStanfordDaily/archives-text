# Dr. Lowman Talks on Reconstruction
## Fremont Surgeon Discusses the Problems of the Crippled Soldier 
### 
A wider vision of the great field of
reconstruction work was disclosed to
an enthusiastic audience by Dr. C. L.
Lowman in his lecture on "Reconstruc
tion Work in Canada," given In the
Little Theater last night. The great
opportunities that are open to all
kinds of specialists in psychology,
physiology, gymnastics, and even eco
nomics, were pointed out. Captain
Lowman urged the responsibility of
every individual in aiding to establish
the proper public attitude towards
crippled soldiers, which, he said, must
be one of logical and helpful interest.
He warned us against the overly senti
mental attitude which is ruinous to the
soldier's mental stability.
"This war has caused more severe
and peculiar injuries than others,'' he
said, "and there is an economic as
well as sentimental reason for aiding
the men to regain their physical c apa
bilities. It is necessary to prepare the
men for work in order that they will
not be a burden on the world and so
that they may become independent for
their own satisfaction."
Various types of cases handled in
Canadian hospitals were reviewed by
the doctor, but he stated that they
were not peculiar to Canada, as all
governments handled their reconstruc
tion work in a similar manner. The
especial apparatus which has been
used in individual cases was explained
as illustrative of the care and atten
tion which is devoted to the men.
Every type of treatment from massage,
electricity, heat and osteopathy to ap
paratus for corrective gymnastics is
available at the reconstruction camps.
The psychological phase of the work
is given due consideration and the
mental condition of the men is often
much improved after attending one of
these camps. Some very striking
cures have been effected since the be
ginning of the war, and many men
have even been restored to combative
strength and sent back to the front.
Captain Lowman is an acting sur
geon at Camp Fremont base hospital
at present. He is an ortheopedist by
profession and especially interested in
all types of corrective gymnastics.
