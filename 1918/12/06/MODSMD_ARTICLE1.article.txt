# TO DISMISS S.A.T.C. BY NEXT WEEK, IS EFFORT
## PERSONAL REASONS ARE CAUSE OF DISMISSAL Physical Examinations of A and B Companies Are Completed 
### 
Lieutenant Morse Erskine. adjutant of
the Stanford S. A. T. C. said today that
every effort would be put forth to have
the S. A. T. C. completely dismissed by
next week. The personnel office iÂ» at
present working out the final records
and reports that are necessary to an or
derly demobilization.
Six men were given complete dismis
sals today, due to urgent personal reas
ons. Individual cases will not be con
sidered by S. A. T. C. for immediate dis
missal except for the most urgent reas
ons, said Lieutenant Erskine today.
Captains B. L. Humphreyville and L.
A. Anthony today completed the physi
cal examinations of A and B companies
of the S. A. T. C. prior to their dis
charge. These examinations are re
garded as necessary by the government
as a matter of record to prove that the
men are in as good condition on their
leaving the army as at the time of their
entering.
Many of the men on their return to
civilian life will remain in their quarters
in Encina Hall. This is due to the fact
that a large majority of this year's male
registration was that of new men, who
will be required by University regulation
to remain in dormitories for one year.
Many guesses have been made as to
general conditions 011 the campus next
quarter. Undoubtedly many old Stan
ford men who have been in the service
will register. Several Stanford men
have appeared on the campus already
from naval aviation camps, and these
men will probably form the vanguard of
the returning soldier students. The
"Grizzlies," the California artillery regi
ment that left here a year ago, will re
turn to Camp Fremont this month with
many old Stanford men in its ranks. The
general feeling on the campu- is tiiat
the University will soon return to nor
mal pre-war conditions.
