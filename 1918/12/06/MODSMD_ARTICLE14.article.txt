Stanford's athletic policy has always, and particularly in recent years, been
to have as large a proportion of the student body participating in some form of
athletics as possible. It was partly for this reason that the change was made
from American football to Rugby, and it has been regarded as the cause for
the adherence to the English game long after other universities had given it up.
Rugby, requiring less intensive coaching and practice, permits a larger number to
participate, while American football has always been regarded as more specialized,
and necessitating more training.
The University is playing American football again, and there is a big place
ior it in university life. There would be ftw indeed who would not regret it if,
after starting the old game again with our ancient rival, we would not be able
to keep it up. But this does not mean that Rugby should be neglected. The game
is as good it ever was, and as valuable. By placing Rugby, tile Uni\ers;ty
policy of general participation in athletics can be maintained, while a chance to
meet California and the other universities of the coast will be furnished through
the American series.
And those of us who have been here before can testify that a "Big Game"
of Rugby, and played with Santa Clara, is by no means devoid of thrills and
excitement, and a failure in arousing college spirit. The battle last year when the
Cardinal won from Santa Clara in almost the last minute of play will long lit
remembered as a classic in "Big Games."
This year again we meet Santa Clara in a Rugby contest. Stanford has beer
defeated by close scores in two preliminary games. Tomorrow the final result
will be known. There shouM be plenty of rooters and plenty of noise from the
tan ford side of the bleachers at Ewing Field when the whistle hlows
