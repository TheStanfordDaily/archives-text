# Junior Pictures Are Due Dec. 15
## Class Records Are to Be Complete in the 1920 Book 
### 
Juniors are reminded by the Quad
management that pictures fÂ®r the 1920
Quad must be taken before December 15
at Franklin's studio in Palo Alto. While
the majority of the clas-. of 1920 have
already attended to the matter, there are
still a number who have not regarded
the announcement that all pictures must
be taken before December 15. For mem
bers of the Junior class who will return
to college for the winter quarter after
bring away, special arrangements will
be made in order that the records of the
class may be complete.
Senior records are also being com
piled, and to secure the college records
of senior men in the service who will
return to college in January the same
arrangement is being made that will be
followed in regard to the Junior pic
tures.
A feature of the 1920 Quad will be a
number of exclusive pictures of the
peace parade and the football games
which will appear for the first time in
the 1920 year hook. Purchasers of the
1920 Quad are promised an unusually
large section devoted to a pictorial rec
ord of the college year
