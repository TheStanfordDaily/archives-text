## THE 						RED AXE 
### 
"Give 'cm the axe, the axe, the axe,
Give 'em the axe, give 'em the axe,
Give 'em the axe—Where?
"Right in the neck, the neck, the neck,
Right in the neck, right in the neck,
Right in the neck—There!"
The origin of tlie "axe rally," cele
brated annually at the University of
California, dates hack to the spring of
1899. At that time a series of three
baseball games were being played off
between the two' universities and each
side had won a game.
The Friday before, the Stanford
baseball enthusiasts gathered on the
campus and decided that the college
was suffering from the harmful influ
ence of a "hoodoo." So a messenger
was dispatched to San Francisco and
an immense red axe was imported. \t
dusk that night a huge funeral pyre of
tar barrels was raised in the middle of
the baseball Field and lighted amidst
husky cheers. Rousing speeches were
made and when the excitement was at
its highest a writhing straw figure was
dragged into the firelight. It was the
"hoodoo." He was hurried through a
solemn trial, but the California sweater
which lie wore condemned him. His
head was laid on a block and the
mighty axe raised. Hundreds of voices
took up the now famous axe song, only
stopping when his head had rolled to
the ground
The new red axe was taken to the
city on the day of the game and borne
aloft by rooters who paraded around the
field. All during the game it was
guarded by a specially provided band.

No sooner had the Stanford man
regained it than he was set upon by the
enemy and again the axe changed

for several hours. The Stanford men
rather than suffer this second defeat
notified the police. Two officers wen
stationed at the Ferry building and all

the trap in time to beg the aid of a

under her coat she took his arm and
the two marched past the police, who
thought they were a happy bridal pair.
Stanford now sent spies across the
i,ay and word at last was sent back
That the axe had been located in the
'Chi Phi house. That night, several score
of men from the campus arrived at
Berkeley. By midnight the Chi 1 hi
bouse was well surrounded. Suspicion
was probably aroused, however, in the
minds of the Berkeley fraternity men,
for they refused to respond to the
knocks on the door, someone instead
calling: "What do you want?"
"We are after the axe." was the grim
reply. A forced entrance was made
and although the house was thoroughly
searched, no trace of the axe could be
found. At daylight the disappointed
crusaders had to leave. Meanwhile the
"red axe" was reposing in the frame
work of a folding door at 11n t hi I'bi

A similar and somewhat more sue
itssful quest was repeated a few years
later, resulting in tlx Stanford men
carrying off the famous ( alifornia

posts and timber, to Stanford.

paraded, the entire campus turning out
to view the procession

"Give 'cm the axe, the axe, the axe,
Give 'em the axe, give 'em the axe,
Give 'em the axe—Where?
"Right in the neck, the neck, the neck,
Right in the neck, right in the neck,
Right in the neck—There!"
The origin of tlie "axe rally," cele
brated annually at the University of
California, dates hack to the spring of
1899. At that time a series of three
baseball games were being played off
between the two' universities and each
side had won a game.
The Friday before, the Stanford
baseball enthusiasts gathered on the
campus and decided that the college
was suffering from the harmful influ
ence of a "hoodoo." So a messenger
was dispatched to San Francisco and
an immense red axe was imported. \t
dusk that night a huge funeral pyre of
tar barrels was raised in the middle of
the baseball Field and lighted amidst
husky cheers. Rousing speeches were
made and when the excitement was at
its highest a writhing straw figure was
dragged into the firelight. It was the
"hoodoo." He was hurried through a
solemn trial, but the California sweater
which lie wore condemned him. His
head was laid on a block and the
mighty axe raised. Hundreds of voices
took up the now famous axe song, only
stopping when his head had rolled to
the ground
The new red axe was taken to the
city on the day of the game and borne
aloft by rooters who paraded around the
field. All during the game it was
guarded by a specially provided band.

called.
No sooner had the Stanford man
regained it than he was set upon by the
enemy and again the axe changed
hands. The axe was now lost to sight
for several hours. The Stanford men
rather than suffer this second defeat
notified the police. Two officers wen
stationed at the Ferry building and all
outgoing passengers searched. W hen
the man with the axe appeared he saw
the trap in time to beg the aid of a
