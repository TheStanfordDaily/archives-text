Editor Daily Palo Alto.
Dear Sir ; After waiting for several
weeks tor the first issue of Chaparral
to appear, and looking forward to the
fulfillment of the press notices promis
ing an unusually clever and artistic edi
tion, it was with surprise and utter dis
gust that we read through the contents
Tuesday.
This issue will go to Stanford men
in -service both in France and in this
country, men for whom, through the Y.
M. C. A., we have pledged our money
to keep up their standard. Will such pic
tures and such jokes aid in this work?
From cover to cover, with but few ex
ceptions tin pictures and jokes represent
a standard of which Stanford should be
ashamed.
Look at any comic magazine now on
the news stands. Punch, Life, and Judge
being three of the most representative.
These would allow no matter of such
low form of wit to be printed. Should
not. then, college men be ashamed to
send such an edition of Chaparral broad
cast over the country?
Put yourself in the place of any future
Stanford student. His ideals and ideas
of this university will be formed more
by this publication, representative of
student life, than perhaps by any other
factor. Granted that Chaparral repre
sents the lighter side, it has been so
lowered as to become vulgar.
From an artistic standpoint the pic
tures are not well executed and decid
edly demoralizing in subject matter.
Neither arc the jokeÂ« clever, new, nor
pointed.
What is it that the Chaparral staff
needs? Perhaps a censor should be ap
pointed from the faculty or the student
body, or women be allowed on the staff,
which would perhaps exert a moral in
fluence. Or perhaps it is. merely neces
sary to help the Hammer and Coffin So
ciety to realize that a higher standard
of literature can be appreciated by the
reading public.
