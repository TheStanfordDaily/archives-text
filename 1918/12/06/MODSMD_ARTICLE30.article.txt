## 
### 
"Stanford Traditions" was the sub
ject of an informal talk which Dr.
Jordan gave before Roble Club Wed
nesday night. He told of the begin
[nings of the University when the fac
ility consisted of fifteen members, and
;ot the days after Mrs. Stanford's
| death when the courts allowed them
salaries only as Mrs. Stanford's serv
ants.
In explaining the origin of the 500
regulation Dr. Jordan said that it was
always the intention of the Stanfords
that men and women should be on a
perfect equality in their new T univer
sity, although in the eighties it was
generally considered that a university
; which admitted women was not a uni
t versity. Considerable influence was
brought to bear to have Mrs. Stanford
endow the girls' school at Menlo
Park and to leave Stanford for the
men, but she rejected the plan.
It was only when the numbers of
women threatened to exceed that of
the men that she asked that the 500
limitation be made. That was during
the time when the estate was in liti
gation and lack of funds made it nec
essary to send advanced medicine,
engineering and law students to east
ern universities.
