# Appointment Secretary Urges Registration of Prospective Graduates
## 
### 
Sometime ago the appointment sec
retary sent out letters to all students
who expect to graduate at Christmas,
requesting that they tile their records
and make known the positions they
are best fitted for. The responses
have been somewhat slow in coming
in and the office wishes everyone who
is included in the following plans to
see the appointment secretary at
once.

The appointment secretary's work
is chiefly to find permanent positions
or those who leave Stanford, whether
hey receive a degree or not. How
ever, the scope of work is being wid
ened to suit the war situation.
Stanford men returning from the
front or from the army camps are
urged to make known their needs at
the appointment secretary's office and
icrmanent employment will be found
for them.
I The office is also planning to lielpi
any Stanford men who have had to
lmve school on account of the war
and it will find temporary employment
far them, thus enabling them to re
jturn to college.
| Anyone who wishes more informa
|tion on this subject, and especially
those graduating at' Christmas, are
j rged to call at the appointment sec
tary's office.
