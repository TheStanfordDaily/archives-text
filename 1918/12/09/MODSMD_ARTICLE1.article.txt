# FINAL RUGBY GAME WITH SANTA CLARA IS HARD FOUGHT
## CARDINAL LOSES 8 TO 5 Poor Support is Given by Students to Team in Contest Saturday 
### 
Stanford's football lioodoo and a
string of defeats still remains unbrok
en. Last Saturday afternoon the Car
dinal fifteen lost the rugby classic of
the year to Santa Clara by a score of
8-5. A small but enthusiastic crowd of |
rooters and spectators braved the rain ;
in order to witness the game. The j
Cardinal players were continually
given advice from the bleachers and
sidelines, but to no avail.
The Santa Clara team outclassed the
Stanford men in the first half and
scored her eight points before the Car
dinal was able to stem the tide. The
slippery field made it necessary to
keep the ball among the forwards.
Santa Clara forwards had the advan
tage of weight and frequently dribbled 1
the ball through the Cardinal pack
for long gains, despite the efforts of j
Flood and Patrick. Patrick was in!
the middle of every ruck and dove
into every dribbling rush. Santa
Clara would dribble the ball to Stan-i
ford's ten or fifteen yard line, but in
their anxiety to score some of the
Missionites would be caught offside.
Patrick's trusty boot would then send
the ball back to the middle of the field
and the play would commence again. |
Korte, Santa Clara's captain, crossed i
the Cardinal line in the middle of the j
first half. He took the ball on a two-j
yard lineout and placed it between j
the goal posts. Larrey converted and 1
the score stood 5-0.
Stanford Loses Chance to
Score in First Half
Stanford's only chance to score in
the first half came shortly after Santa
Clara's first try. Patrick took the ball
through the Mission forwards for sixty
yards. Just as he passed the fullback
and had a clear field he slipped and !
fell. Santa Clara recovered the ball
and Diaz placed the ball in Cardinal !
territory by a pretty kick to touch, i
Santa Clara finished her scoring in j
the last few minutes of the first half.
Pipes, the Mission halfback, intercept
ed a pass and started the only success- 1
ful passing rush of the game. The
ball was handled by five men and was ,
carried fifty yards. Larrey made a
run of twenty-five yards and passed
to Judge, who scored the try. Larrey
failed to convert from a very hard an
gle. The half ended a few minutes
later with the ball in Stanford terri
tory and Santa Clara leading by a'
score of 8-0.
Cardinal Comes Back
In Second Half
If the first half was all Santa Clara,
the second half was all Stanford. The
Cardinal team came back fighting and
frequently carried the ball to scoring
distance, only to fail or lose the ball
by a little hard luck. The referee was!
heard to say after the game that he
had never seen a game in which the
breaks of luck were so one sided. The
Cardinal's only try came at the be
ginning of this half Patrick found
touch at Santa Clara's one-yard line
at the end of a long kick. The Santa
Clara men put up a great fight to keep
the ball from coming across. After
several scrums Sheldon dove over the
line for Stanford's try. It was one of
the most spectacular plays of the
game. Diaz. Pipes and Whalen at
tempted to tackle the Cardinal cap
tain. but his five-yard dive carried him
over their heads. Patrick made the
score 8-5 by converting. Stanford had
only one other chance to score, and
lost that because one of her men was
offside. The Cardinal forwards drib
bled the ball to the five-yard line, but
lost it on an offside, and the free kick
sent the ball back to mid-field. In
this dribbling rush Gibbs wrenched
his ankle and Kelly took his place.
The injury is not serious.
With two minutes left to play, the
ball was dribbled to Stanford's five
yard. Korte picked the ball out of!
the ruck and drove for the line. The'
attempt failed and the game ended !
with the ball in Stanford's territory
for the first time in the second half.
J The handfull of Santa Clara rooters
who witnessed the game held a short
serpentine on the field, and the second
big football game of the year was over
and the Cardinal had been defeated.

the way she came back in the second." j
Coach Diaz of Santa Clara:

the Stanford fifteen. However, the,

on their determination to fight. T was;
