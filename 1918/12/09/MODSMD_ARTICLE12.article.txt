Recent attacks upon the Americanism of Dr. Jordan have stirred the Uni
versity to indignation and puzzled those who know Stanford's first president as
to what possible foundation there copld be for such a charge. Those of us who
have heard Dr. Jordan speak know that far from condoning the crimes of Ger
many, he has emphatically denounced the German aims, methods, and govern
mental system. Stanford knows that no more sincere American patriot exists
than her chancellor emeritus and is apt to grow indignant that reflections should
be cast oh his patriotism by ignorant or narrow-minded persons.
The truth of the matter probably is that Dr. Jordan's well-known connection
with organizations looking toward international cunciliaation and disarmament
has fixed the idea in the minds of the unthinking that he is a pacifist, and hence,
by an illogical but often excusable mental process. pro-German. To call a man
a pacifist is tu use a hard epithet nowadays; we are apt to forget that uj odium
attached to the term before the outbreak of the war. A pacifist, to use the proper
meaning of the word, is one who believes' resorting to peaceful means rather
than war for the solution of international difficulties, and, taken in this sense,
every good citizen is to a greater or less extent a pacifist. We may not all of us
agree with the views of the various "pacifist" associations. But to hold these
views should only subject one to condemnation when pacifiism outweighs patriot
ism. and the pacifist refuses to support his country in a righteous cause.. That
many pacifists, blinded by their creed, permitted themselves to become the con
scious or unconscious agents of German propaganda in this country should not
be a reflection on men who, like Dr. Jordan, saw that the best way to secure
peace was to oppose the greatest enemy of peace, and who actively supported
the government in the prosecution of the war against Germany.
There is a lesson in the unfounded attacks on Dr. Jordan and other leading
educators for the whole nation, and particularly the universities. To call,a man
a pro-German, or accuse him of lack of patriotism is one of the easiest and most
effective charges to make, and one of the hardest to refute. It may be readily
used for partisan and personal purposes, and any man who accuses another of
lack of patriotism except upon well-founded evidence should be looked at with
suspicion.
In most cases where unfounded charges of pro-Germanism have been made
it has been found that the difference between the accuser and accused has been,
not greater or less devotion to the nation's wlfare, but merely difference of
opinion as to more or less important details. Unity of opinion is vital to the
prosecution of a war with the highest degree of efficiency, but now that the war
is over, the necessity for the enforced unity has passed away. Divergence, and
wide divergence, of opinion is essential to the most healthy national progress in
ordinary times. Broadening of the viewpoint is one of the most important func
tions of the universities. After attending one for four years one should be able
to disagree with others without imputing their morals, motives, or patriotism.

be cast oh his patriotism by ignorant or narrow-minded persons.
The truth of the matter probably is that Dr. Jordan's well-known connection
with organizations looking toward international cunciliaation and disarmament
has fixed the idea in the minds of the unthinking that he is a pacifist, and hence,
by an illogical but often excusable mental process. pro-German. To call a man
a pacifist is tu use a hard epithet nowadays; we are apt to forget that uj odium
attached to the term before the outbreak of the war. A pacifist, to use the proper
meaning of the word, is one who believes' resorting to peaceful means rather
than war for the solution of international difficulties, and, taken in this sense,
every good citizen is to a greater or less extent a pacifist. We may not all of us
agree with the views of the various "pacifist" associations. But to hold these
views should only subject one to condemnation when pacifiism outweighs patriot
ism. and the pacifist refuses to support his country in a righteous cause.. That
many pacifists, blinded by their creed, permitted themselves to become the con
scious or unconscious agents of German propaganda in this country should not
be a reflection on men who, like Dr. Jordan, saw that the best way to secure
peace was to oppose the greatest enemy of peace, and who actively supported
the government in the prosecution of the war against Germany.
There is a lesson in the unfounded attacks on Dr. Jordan and other leading
educators for the whole nation, and particularly the universities. To call,a man
a pro-German, or accuse him of lack of patriotism is one of the easiest and most
effective charges to make, and one of the hardest to refute. It may be readily
used for partisan and personal purposes, and any man who accuses another of
lack of patriotism except upon well-founded evidence should be looked at with
suspicion.
In most cases where unfounded charges of pro-Germanism have been made
it has been found that the difference between the accuser and accused has been,
not greater or less devotion to the nation's wlfare, but merely difference of
opinion as to more or less important details. Unity of opinion is vital to the
prosecution of a war with the highest degree of efficiency, but now that the war
is over, the necessity for the enforced unity has passed away. Divergence, and
wide divergence, of opinion is essential to the most healthy national progress in
ordinary times. Broadening of the viewpoint is one of the most important func
tions of the universities. After attending one for four years one should be able
to disagree with others without imputing their morals, motives, or patriotism.
Recent attacks upon the Americanism of Dr. Jordan have stirred the Uni
versity to indignation and puzzled those who know Stanford's first president as
to what possible foundation there copld be for such a charge. Those of us who
have heard Dr. Jordan speak know that far from condoning the crimes of Ger
many, he has emphatically denounced the German aims, methods, and govern
mental system. Stanford knows that no more sincere American patriot exists
than her chancellor emeritus and is apt to grow indignant that reflections should
be cast oh his patriotism by ignorant or narrow-minded persons.
