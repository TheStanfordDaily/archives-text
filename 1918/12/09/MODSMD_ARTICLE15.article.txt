(The "Committer of the 5(10" seems i
to have "stepped into something" in ■
writing the communication criticizing
Chaparral, which appeared in the Daily
last Friday, judging from the response
which has been drawn forth from the
adherents of the college comic. Both l
sides have been presented, and the mer-;

December 6. 1918.
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Dear Sir—lt is with considerable
amusement that 1 read a most inter
esting communication criticising one of
our best known publications. The fact
that - a ."committee" (which- probably
uses the editorial "we") lias wished
upon us a board of censorship, however,
is not to be wondered at. With so
many wicked beings—men who do not
retire until ten at night—on the cam
pus and so much disgrace brought by
them upon the fair name of our be
loved "Farm," it is scarcely anything
to marvel at that some fair guardian of
our morals should arise in righteous
wrath at the ignominious outrages
which have been heaped upon our "500"
;-n(l upon the Stanford representatives
on the soil of France.
The vulgarity of our would-be comic
is not only self-evident, but it stands
embossed on every page of the stupid
publication. I he idea of putting into
print such expressions as "K. P.," N.
C. (). and "A. W. (>. L.," is preposter
ous. Who knows but what these terms
might mean something closely akin to
!>. \. I). and N. (j. And the very au
dacity of writing sentences and openly
ridicule our poor but honest friend,
William Hohenzollern! It is, indee 1,
a low form of humor which endeavors
to wax facetious of a man When down
and out up with the ex-Kaiser, down
with "Chappie!" May the unwhole
some influence which emanates from
its pages never demoralize our boys
across the seas!

Editor oi* the Daily Palo Alto:
Dear Sir—ln your publication of last
Friday 1 regret to note the extremely
narrow viewpoint taken by the "Com
mittee of the '500'" in regard to the
recent edition of Chaparral. After hav
ing sounded the attitude of various
members of the student body and fac
ulty. however, 1 find that this view does
not extend beyond the writers of the
article in question.
The committee claims that the pic
tures arc poorly execttted. They are
asked to visit the Stanford Art depart
ment for a few lessons on the principles
of drawing, for it is evident that they
are not qualified to criticise any artistic
production. As for the jokes, the writ
ers must have been referring to the de
partment of "Clippings," which, as the
title suggests, contains stories taken
from other magazines. Or perhaps the
points were so subtle that it was im
possible for the committee to appreci
ate them.
It might relieve tire writers' minds to
compare Chaparral with other college
magazines (for it competes with these,
not with professional comic publica
tions) and find that its standard ranks
high with the former. Merely to glance
through any such magazine with such
a comparison in mind would leave no
doubt as to the truth of this. Inciden
tally, jokes often reappear in the pages
of Life which came out for the first
time "in the abhorred Chaparral.
To allay any remaining scruples of
the committee, it should be known that
there is already a woman on the staff
and that all doubtful contributions must
pass a censor.
May 1 add that, according to journal
istic etiquette, all communications criti
cising Chaparral should be sent to its
editor in chief.

Edifor Daily Palo Alto:
Chappie is repentant; Chappie is
sad; Chappie realizes the error of his
ways, and is willing to make any
amends the sisters may demand. In
fact, the old boy is anxious to be mor
alized, and imbibe some of the refin
ing influences that go to make the
prudish titter.
Chappie doesn't claim any humor; in
fact, the only funny thing about it is
how it manages to get by so well. If
any member of the committee feels in
an argumentative mood, Chappie is
willing to direct any joke for her, and
convince her wherein the perfection
lies. And as for the drawings, even
old Chappie himself has to cry every
time he thinks of them, all except some
donated by the "500" committee, which
Chappie has just heard isn't 500 at all,
but a select few. Of course, who is
better able to criticise a drawing than
a striving young artist —Chappie
agrees, the choice was wisely made,
and Hammer and Coffin's future stands
the chance of being greatly enriched.
Chappie won't lower himself to a
technical discussion of feminine hu
mor. but there is one thing he most
decidedly takes issue to, and that is
that Chappie is vulgar. Chappie does
n't enjoy discussion on this subject—
but all he can say is that he knows
that campus- opinion is squarely be
hind him, and that in the future he
will continue in the same course of
allowing nothing inconsistent with
Stanford ideals to appear.
If the kindly anonymous writers will
honor Chappie by signing their names,
he will donate a free membership to
Hammer and Coffin as the reward for
this bravery.
Chappie fears nothing and is
ashamed of nothing, and all he "can say
to the "moralizing influences" is "Resl
in Peace."
Yours in shame,
LESTER LEVY,
Managing Editor of the Chaparral.
