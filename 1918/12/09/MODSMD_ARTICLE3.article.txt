### 
J. S. Wilson, ex-mayor of Berkeley
and one of the intellectual leaders in
socialist ranks, will speak at the week
ly meeting held under the auspices of
the Y. M. C. A. and Y. W. C. A. at
Assembly Hall next Thursday even
ing. Mr. Wilson is well known in San
Francisco and throughout the West as
a forceful and interesting speaker, and
the University is unusually fortunate
in being able to have the opportunity
to hear him.
In dealing with the subject of social
ism, of which Mr. Wilson is an ardent
advocate, he upholds the idealistic side
of the question, emphasizing the or
ganized brotherhood of man. and his
theories closely follow those which
have been kept so constantly before
the people of the United States by
President Wilson. In Mr. Wilson, the
thinking and less radical side of social
ism is found, which leaves out the ele
ments of Bolshevikism that are so
often erroneously connected with so
cialism in its higher farm.
Last year Mr. Wilson conducted a
series of "Institutes of Democracy"
throughout the state, which made quite
a sensation because of the sound prin
ciples which Mr. Wilson advocated and
the forceful manner in which he pre
sented them. Each institute was held
for a week, at which Mr. Wilson spoke
twice a day.
The usual singing and get-together
spirit will be featured in the rest of the
program, and this assembly should be
one of the most interesting of the year.
The women of the campus are especial
ly urged to attend.
