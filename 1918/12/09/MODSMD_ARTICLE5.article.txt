# UNJUST ATTACK ON DR. JORDAN MEETS WITH RESENTMENT
## LOYALTY IS IMPUTED Chancellor Indignant Over Attempt to Link Him With Pro-Germans 
### 
Stanford rallied to the support ofi
her Chancellor Emeritus, Dr. .David
Starr Jordan, when his name was in-'
eluded Saturday in an alleged expose l
of pro-Germans in this country. A list,
which included the names of many,
other prominent educators and schol-i
ars, such as Albert Bushnell Hart,!
John W. Burgess, and others, was |
found in the effects of Dr. Karl A.j
Fuehr, a German agent in America, i
and was disclosed by A. B. Bielaski,!
chief of the Bureau of Investigation of i
the Department of Justice.
According to Bielaski's statement, 1
the men in this list, in which Dr. Jor
dan's name as included, are "practical-'
Iv all who were actively pro-German j
prior to our entrance in the war and
a few who were active afterwards". It
is to this implication that Dr. Jordan
objects. Dr. Jordan's own statement,
as given out by him yesterday, fol
lows :
"The recent publication of names of
American professors and others found j
in a private memorandum book (with
out details') from the effects of an ob-'
scure German agent, together with the I
implication that all the persons named'
were necessarily 'pro-German,' seems
to me a wanton injustice. The list ap
parently covers part of those who, like
myself, were deluged with unsolicited
and unconvincing German propaganda I
during the first year of the war. It
contains the names of a number of
men who spoke against Germany be
fore the national economic clubs in the
winter of 1914-15. I was one of these
myself. T heard Dr. Albert Bushnell.
Hart of Harvard, whose name appears ;
011 the list, at Boston. November, 1914,
give an address strongly and unquali
fieldly anti-German.
"No genuine lover of peace has ever
condoned from first to last in any de
gree the operations of the Kaiser's
government. A 'German peace* at any
time would have been a contradition !
of terms, for peace cannot be had by
lying down before aggression."
Press comment Saturday, following
I)r. Jordan's emphatic denial of any,
pro-German sentiment, stated that Dr. j
Jordan "had admitted" having sent a
revolutionary Hindu document through j
the mails. Dr. Jordan has made the j
following statement of his side of the
case:
"The statement in the press that 'Dr. j
Jordan admits having mailed' a cer-,
tain Hindu pamphlet needs a word of
explanation. In a package of material
sent to a Japanese teacher of English
who asked for anything his pupils,
might read, the pamphlet in question|
was said to be found. This paper I
had never read, and for that matter
never seen, and my secretary, who
made up the package, has 110 recollec
tion of having seen it either."
