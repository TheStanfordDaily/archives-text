# THE STUDENT ARMY TRAINING CORPS
## 
### 
Within two days the Student Army Training Corps at Stanford will be a
thing of history, as at other universities throughout the United States. Brief
though its existence was, it marked a new phase in university history. It
means that the government recognizes the importance of the college in na
tional life and takes advantage of it in time of national danger. While the
sudden ending of the war deprived the S. A. T. C. of the opportunity to dem
onstrate its practical usefulness, there is little doubt that the government
is fully satisfied with the showing made in the limited time of the S. A. T.
C.'s existence. If any extensive plans are made for future military prepared
ness, colleges and universities will play a large part in it, particularly in the
training of officer material and the highly specialized branches of the army.
As the student soldiers return to the freedom and joys of civilian life they
may well feel that the time they have spent in the uniform has been time
well spent.
