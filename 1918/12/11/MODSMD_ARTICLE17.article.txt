# Red Cross Wants Paper Collected by Friday
## 
### 
Friday noon is the day set for col
lection of all kinds of newspapers,
wrapping paper and magazines. The
students and faculty are asked to co
operate with the Red Cross and Sal
vage committees by having ready on the
sidewalk as many bundles of such ma
terial as it is possible to get together.
The Red Cross is anxious and ready to
help everyone get rid of these accumu
lated papers, but they must be wrapped
in a bunch and placed outdoors where
the truck drivers can hurriedly gather
them up.
