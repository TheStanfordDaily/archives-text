# Hark, Mates, to a . . . . . . . Sad Yarn of the . . Encina Sailor
## 
### 
The good ship "Eneina" is financially
on the rocks. The rollicking sailor lad
dies are a downhearted crew today, fol
lowing a playful little edict of the pay
master's department ordering them to
pay the University $1.50 a day for their
stay in the Stanford drydock.
Just at a time when the salts were
ready to quit the ocean wave, and to get
into a soft berth as civilians with plenty
of pay left over to buy plum duff and
incidentals that are so dear to the sea
man's heart, the hardy mariners discov
ered that many of them would actually
owe Uncle Sam money for their stay in
his service. The complication came
through the fact that the gobs were
only to be paid from the date of the ar
rival of their induction papers. As a
result, many of the tars, whose papers
arrived late, are stranded high and dry
in a strange port.
The standard is reversed on S. S.
Eneina today, and many a strong man is
washing down the main deck with his
salty tears.
