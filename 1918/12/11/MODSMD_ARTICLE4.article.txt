# Huston Delivers Valuable Address
## Canadian Friendship After War Shown to Be Worth America's Efforts 
### 
"That Canada has ever held any ill
will towards us is hard for the United
States to realize," said Professor C.
A. Huston in his lecture on "Our
Nearest Neighbor—A Problem in In
ternational Friendship," delivered in
the Little Theater last night. "We
have never been unfriendly to her, but
we have not met with the same cor
diality," he said. "Canada has a mind
of her own."
The possibility for international
friendship which was so favorable,
due to the proximity of the two na
tions and the kinship of the peoples
was explained. The interpenetration
of each country by the greatest lead
ers, educators, mechanics, and enter
tainers, of the other, as well as the
great similarity of institutions; po
litical, social, and religious, was shown
to be conducive of good will and sym
pathetic understanding, but the fault
laid ill the ignorance or indifference of
both peoples to the individual differ
ences of the other.
The Canadian attitude of hostility
was traced back to the historical
events which caused Canadians to be
lieve the United States responsible for
the hardships of the founders of Can
ada. This feeling of ill will was only
heightened by unfortunate indifference
and misunderstandings in the eco
nomic arrangement ot' tariff questions
and came into full expression in the
contempt of the Canadians for the
Americans at the beginning of the
war.
Canada founded her opinion of the
United States on the assumption that
her neutrality was based on a lack of
sympathy with the cause of the Alliee,
but she has since learned to respect
the American soldier and has lost
much of the former dislike since our
entrance into the war.
For this reason. Professor Huston
pointed out, this is the proper time
for us to consolidate our friendship
and set the example of two nations
who are neighbors living together in
perfect harmony for a future federa
tion of the world.
Such a friendship he finds abso
lutely essential to the promotion of
our ideals of world peace and pointed
out how it would also have great com
mercial value to the nations involved.

heightened by unfortunate indifference
and misunderstandings in the eco
nomic arrangement ot' tariff questions
and came into full expression in the
contempt of the Canadians for the
Americans at the beginning of the
war.
Canada founded her opinion of the
United States on the assumption that
her neutrality was based on a lack of
sympathy with the cause of the Alliee,
but she has since learned to respect
the American soldier and has lost
much of the former dislike since our
entrance into the war.
For this reason. Professor Huston
pointed out, this is the proper time
for us to consolidate our friendship
and set the example of two nations
who are neighbors living together in
perfect harmony for a future federa
tion of the world.
Such a friendship he finds abso
lutely essential to the promotion of
our ideals of world peace and pointed
out how it would also have great com
mercial value to the nations involved.
