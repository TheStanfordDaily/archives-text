# Christmas Party Is Planned by Clinic Auxiliary
## 
### 
A Christmas party with a real Santa
Claus and lots of the holiday spirit
has been planned by Stanford Lane
Clinix Auxiliary, as the crowning
event of the season's work. Women
of the University who are now busily
engaged in filling stockings for the
poor of San Francisco and are exert
ing their energies to send the Christ
mas cheer to them from Stanford are
to reap a little good from their own
efforts when the work is completed
at this party.
Filling and gathering of Christmas
stockings for Lane Clinic is an annual
charity and is a part of the Stanford
auxiliary's regular work, but at the
request of Y. W. C. A. this special
feature was turned over to the latter
organization and is under the able
care of the Social Service Committee
for this year.
The Lane Clinic party is arranged to
fall on the afternoon when the dona
tions of stockings are due and will
be an entertainment for the workers
and friends as they assemble to turn
in the gifts on Wednesday, December
18, at the Women's Club House. The
event is chiefly for the amusement of
campus children from the campus
school, but is under the auspices of
Lane Clinic.
Christmas carols are to be sung, and
a short selection from the "Birds'
Christmas Carol" will be enacted, fol
lowed by a general social good time.
A second Christmas party will b<s
given by Lane Clinic to the San Fran
cisco children on Friday. December
20. This ifc to be the annual Christ
mas tree for the needy children of
the Clinic Social Service department
and is the entertainment for which
the stockings are being prepared. The
donations from Stanford will be dis
tributed at this time.
Clean and mended clothing in the
greatest need of the clinic at present.
Such articles may be left at the
Women's Club House at any time.
