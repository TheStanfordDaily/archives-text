# A 						WISE MOVE

### 
The action taken by the student body mass meeting this noon is one of the
most satisfactory steps in recent years. If approved by the Board of Trustees, it
will mean that student finances will at last be put on a firm foundation, and that
the activities which should begin immediately next quarter will not have to be
delayed or hampered for lack of sufficient funds. The additional amount to be paid
at registration is triffling, and will be actually much less than if the student paid for
what he will receive for the extra two dollars under the old system, and the advan
tages to the student body are incalculable. The heavy debt can be speedily wiped
out, student finances put under a thorough and efficient auditing system, and the
Associated Students will know exactly where they stand the day after registration,
and will not have to proceed by guesswork and resort to feverish membership cam
paigns.
The student proposition will go 10 the Board of Trustees at its next meeting
with the earnest and unanimous hope that that body will see its way clear to
approve of it.
