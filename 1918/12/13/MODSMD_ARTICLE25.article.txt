# ABOUT STANFORD
## THE
						CLASS PLATE 
### 
1 he laying of the class plate occurs
during commencement week and is one
of Stanford's most honored and irn
pressive customs. The ceremony was
inaugurated by the famous piorteer
class of '95. They laid a bronze plate
bearing the numerals of the class into
the pavement of the quadrangle direct
ly in front of where the Memorial
Church now stands. Each succeeding
class has followed the custom by plac
ing a plate in a line with the original
square.
The dedication of the plate is always
held on class day of senior week and is
attended by the entire class. Here the
class history is read and the heritage
of benefits and responsibilities and the
duty and privilege of placing flowers at
Mrs. Stanford's tomb is reverently
given into the keeping of the follow
ing class. The sealing of the class
records and roll under the plate con
cludes the exercises.
This row of bronze plates marks with
symbolic significance the history of
Stanford, just as, in long years to come,
the ever increasing line of metal pave
ment shall signify the growth and suc
cess of the University. It is an awe
some thing to contemplate that line of
bronze, creeping the slow pilgrimage of
years toward the corner arch, seem
ingly so close at hand and many gen
erations of Stanford im*n and women

will have hurried over them before
that last hronze square shall have been
linked with that of '95.
