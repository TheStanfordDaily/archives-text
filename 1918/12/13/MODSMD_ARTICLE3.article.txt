Through the long arcades of the Quad
this morning there caine a steady swish
ing sound, suggestive of the wind whist
ling gently through the boughs of a pine
tree. It was the new-born upperclass
men walking—not marching— to their 8

All day yesterday in the clothes
market of Palo Alto there was a bull
movement on corduroy and a decided
slump in khaki As a result, today we
were treated to such sights and sounds
as will take our ears and eyes long to
grow accustomed to. Taking everything
into consideration, however, 1920 must
be congratulated on its attempt to gain
that inimitable upperclass air.
The nucleus of a Rough's Corner put
in its appearance also tadav by the En
gineering building. The characteristic
facial shrubbery of the true rough was
lacking as yet.
