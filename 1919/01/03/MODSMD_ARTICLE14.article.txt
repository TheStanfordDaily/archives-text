# RETURNING ATHLETES BRIGHTEN HOPES FOR SPORTS
## RUGBY LOOMS STRONG Baseball to Commence With Practice Tonight at Encina Gym 
### H.G. Swendsen, '20 
From the appcarance of returned ath
letes around the campus, Uncle Sam
must have wished to help Stanford in
atlhetics. Rugby, baseball, track, bas
ketball, swimming and all minor sports
have received their donations of good
men to help the Cardinal during the
spring.
Since the time is short, basketball
will begin informally tonight, but the
other sports will wait until the big sign
up rally scheduled for the near future at
Encina Hall.
For the Rugby battle against the Uni
versity of California, Winham, Long,
Lilly, Adams, Righter, Falk and other
good men arc back. Stanford had a good
team without these men, but there will
be a struggle for positions on the team
now that should bring out a fifteen of
the Stanford 15, Santa Clara 11 caliber.
Winham is a tower at wing-forward,
Long is a crack at half or first five,
Lilly is without a peer as first five, Ad
ams and Righter at side rank and rear
rank respetively are great players, while
Falk at wing will fill up a great hole.
Sheldon, Parker., Patrick, Henry, Sco
fiekl and Kocher will be in the battle
for positions from the S. A. T. C.
Rugby team.
In baseball the fact that Lilly will be
scattered around generally in the out
field will mean the nucleus of a nine.
In addition Davis, Varsity first base
man last year, Charley Doe, keystone
sacker, Tuebner and Kallum of the good
freshman team, will make up the basis
for a good infield
As usual Stanford will be weak in
the pitching and catching divisions.
But as the year goes on some of the
good heavers and back stops of former
days will undoubtedly show up.
In track, affairs look bright. May
nard is back from the naval aviation
corps for the quarter. Lilly and Dinkel
spiel are eligible for the sprints, and
there is a possibility that the undefeat
able House may return. Teitsworth,
captain of the team for the year, Reg
Caughey, shotputter and general weight
man of former years, Pelouze for the
quarter. Wells, a sprinter, Hutchinson
for the pole and Wright, Hertel and
Green of the 1921 team will be on the
job. Against such a combination Cali
fornia will have to work hard if she
is to break her string of defeats.
in basketball the complete last year's
team with the exception of the guards
will be out. Moulton, Hood, Righter,
Pelouze, Bucklin are varsity men, while
Swanhold and Fairchilds of fieshman
The time is .short for indoor sport and
the experience of these men will count
strongly in turning out a good five.
