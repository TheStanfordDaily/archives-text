# COLLEGES AND THE CHANGING ORDER
## 
### 
With the registration for the Winter Quarter, Stanford passes into a new
period in its history,—in common with the whole world, the epoch that begins
with The War's end.
The beginning of this new epoch is a convenient point for radical changes of
all kinds, in colleges as in other things. A feeling seems to be growing up that
colleges are due for a reorganization in the new order of things, that most of what
we call "college life" is frivolous and to be done away with; efficiency has become
a goal and colleges are not efficient. In some quarters it seems to be the opinion
that great universities are wasting their time in giving elementary courses to
youngsters fresh from high schools when they might be devoting their energies
to the more serious problems of graduate and research work. In short, the uni
versities must settle down to business as the intellectual laboratories of the world.
With some of these objections to colleges as they have existed we can readily
agree. Such attitude as regards college only as an excuse to keep from going to
work, such spirit as finds its expression in the painting of campaniles, can gladly
be dispensed with.
But the prospect, however vague and far in the future, of doing away with
the greater part of undergraduate studies, of stopping intercollegiate athletics,
of dispensing with "college life," will be opposed by all who know and love col
leges as they have been, whether at Harvard, at Cornell, or at Stanford.
What is learned in books is by no means all of value to be obtained in a col
lege education. What lingers longest in the memories of the alumni is not the
courses they have taken, but the associations they formed, the friendships they
made, the "culture" they absorbed by contact with men and women from different
places, with dicerent ideas, but united by college bonds. And college activities,
intercollegiate athletics, and opportunities for exchange of views outside of the
classroom are essential to this broader idea of a college education.
Changes there are bound to be, but it is the earnest hope of nearly all who
are attending or have attended college that they may be made without violence
to the things that have made college communities that are something more than
institutions of learning.
