# Two Hundred Men Attend Asilomar
## Stanford Sends Twenty-one Delegates to Annual "Y" Conference 
### 
Almost two hundred delegates from
representative colleges in California,
Utah, Nevada and Arizona met during
the week of December 26-31 for their
annual conference at Asilomar. For
the past twenty-five years these con
ferences have been held by the Y. M.
C. A. for the students of western uni
versities, but according to A. E. Wor
thy, local Y. M. C. A. secretary, this is
the largest conference ever held. Stan
ford was represented by twenty-one del
egates.
The key-note of the conference, in
view of the recent armistice, was a dis
cussion of the possibilities for world
betterment and service. The problem
of reconstruction was also discussed,
and plans for maintaining the principles
for which our soldiers fought were sug
gested.
A large delegation of foreign students
attended the conference, the number be
ing almost sixty.
J. Stitt Wilson gave a series of five
lectures during the conference week, the
main idea of which was the organiza
tion of a constructive Christian democ
racy. David Porter also spoke on the
new student movement of the Y. M.
C. A.
A meeting of the local Y. M. C. A.
was held in Palo Alto last night at the
Palo Alto Hotel. Students, members of
the faculty and local business men at
tended the meeting. David Porter was
the chief speaker, and addressed the
meeting on some of the significant
aspects of the Y. M. C. A. program.
