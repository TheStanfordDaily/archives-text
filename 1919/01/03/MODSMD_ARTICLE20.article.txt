Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Evidently the unequalcd Chappie was
not in a humorous mood when the ar
ticle by the "Committee of the 500" ap
peared in a late issue of the Daily Palo
Alto last quarter, for he failed com
pletely to see the situation comically.
Instead he was grieved that his univer
sally acknowledged reputation for fun
should be doubted even as a joke. The
committee wishes to inform him that it
was a joke and that no malice was in
tended by
The Committee of the 500.
