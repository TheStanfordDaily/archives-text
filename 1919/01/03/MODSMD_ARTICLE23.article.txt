### 
Plans for the dramatic event of the
I
college year, the 1920 Junior Opera, are
in full swing, according to reports from
the committee which held its first meet
ing for the present quarter at the Delta
Gamma house last night. Both the bus
iness and dramatic sides of the coming
musical show were arranged for and
several important appointments were
made.
Leland Pickering, chairman of the
committee consisting of Miss Ruth
Elsinger, Miss Anna Gardner, Miss
Ruth Searcy, James Boyle and M. T. R.
Maynard, conducted the meeting. His
absence from the University last quar
ter prevented his taking the chair at
former meetings.
At the end of the last academic term
Pickering was designated as the director
;of the opera. Other appointments
made last night were that of Arthur
George as business manager and of Miss
I Ruth Searcy as advertising manager,
i George has also been made a permanent
member of the 1920 Junior Opera com
mittee.
Reports' to the effect that several
Stanford men and women are now writ
ing operas to be submitted to the com
mittee were received at the meeting. By
the middle of next week these prospec
tive operas are to have been considered
and one of them decided upon. The
composers for the opera score will then
be designated. It is hoped that the di
rector, the author and the composer will
be able to work together toward the
early completion of this year's opera.
Although a definite date has not yet
been decided upon, in all probability the
musical show will be staged at the end
of the first and second Week of # March.
According to the present plans, it will
be one of the features of the traditional
Junior Week.
