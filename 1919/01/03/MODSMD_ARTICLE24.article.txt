# Sororities Begin Informal Rushing
## 
### 
The women's fraternities last night
began their season of formal, instead of
the customary informal, winter rushing.
The bidding is to be done by the lawyer
system as in the fall. There are prac
tically no restrictions except that the
bids must all be sent in a week from
the time the rushing commenced.
