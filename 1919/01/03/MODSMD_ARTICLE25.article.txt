# ABOUT STANFORD
## THE 						NEW-YEAR 
### 
'College life may be said to begin "with
a running start" after the holidays. The
students know each other and the new
comers arc few. From January on till
Commcnemcnt week in June no one,
event stands out as does the big foot
ball game in the. fall," but in variety and
number of interests this is the high tide
of the collcgc year. .
First, the freshmen and 'sophomores'
meet again in battle, this time in debate.
Late in January the -two universities
meet in the Carnot debate. Soon the
sophomores present some standard Eng
lish comedy, juniors following with an
original light opera and the seniors with
a farce. Song hits and situations from
these are sung and respected on the
campus for many a day. Perhaps mem
bers of the faculty put <>n a comedy and
the English, Spanish, French, German
and Classical clubs may be counted upon
in alternate years to present something
of value from the famous plays of their
respective languages; The glee and man
dolin clubs, combing back from their
holiday trips, usually give a concert in
' the Assembly all.
A generous athletic calendar is of
fered with the intercollegiate track
meet in April, the three baseball games
in May, the tennis singles and doubles
with California and tlie great crew race.
The day the "Quad" conies out—the
yearbook of the juniors, a treasure
house and record for what is best in
the literary, social and athletic life of
the college—the day of the great elec
tion, when the 'student body chooses its
leaders, and "Junior" and "Senior
Week," all come in this period of the
"college year.
Junior week is probably the choice

event in the undergraduate's mind. 'It
then that the junior opera is pre
sented and the four classes compels for
the athletic championship on the track.
Also the junior prom, usually the first
class dance of the new year, is. given in
the Encina clubroonj.
Y.'-M. and Y. YV. C. A. entertain
mcnts, the Encina and Roble receptions
the fraternity and sorority "at liQUJt'.iil
the bi-weekly meethigs of the depalrt
mental clubs and plenty of smaller en
gagements takes good care that Jack
does not become-a dull boy at Stan
ford.'
