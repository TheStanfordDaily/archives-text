# Chappie Wants More Tryoutees to Hand in Names
## 
### 
Hammer and Coffin has elected M. A.
Hagen, '15, as business manager of
Chaparral for the coming quarter.
Hagen in his new position is planning
to issue six more numbers of "Chap
pie" during the school year. The First
issue will be around the middle of this
month, and with the return of many
members of the Chaparral staff to Stan
ford it promises to be an interesting
one.
Hammer and Coffin has entered an
urgent plea for tryoutees for both the
business and editorial ends of "Chap
pie." Any one that can draw, or who
knows some of the rudiments of fun
construction, is eligible to try out for
a position on the staff and should hand
in his name at once to "Les" Levy, '19,
the editor. "Milt" Hagen, the newly
elected business manager, holds the lu
crative position of assistant manager be
fore the eyes of any eager tryoutees on
the business end. "Chappie's" most per
manent address, at present, is P. O. Box
15, Campus.
