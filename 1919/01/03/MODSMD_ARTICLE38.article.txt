# New Pennell Exhibit Opens at Art Gallery
## 
### 
Two new exhibits are to be shown
at the Stanford Art Gallery, commenc
; ing January U, and ending February 3.
One is by Joseph Pennell, a graphic
portrayer of busy industrial scenes,
who will be' remembered for his ex
hibit here last year, part of which will
be again re-exhibited. This set is
â–  made up of views pertafning to the
I food and fuel industries connected
j with America's huge war effort, and
is the second set which Pennell made
at the request of the government.
They are all illustrations of PenneH's
axiom, "Labor is Art." This collection
was especially made for the Stanford
gallery, coming here directly from
New York. After its exhibit here it
will be sent to Seattle, and the north,
later to go to Los Angeles and the
southeast.
Eastern industrial design will be
well represented in the second exhibit,
which comprises work from the Pratt
Institute of Brooklyn, the Rhode
Island School of Design and the Penn
sylvania School of Industrial Art.
These schools are leaders in art in
struction, the Pennsylvania school be
ing the oldest art school in America.
