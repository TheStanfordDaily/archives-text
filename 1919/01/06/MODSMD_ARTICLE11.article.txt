### 
Registration for the winter quarter by
noon today reached 1,260, according to
Registrar Elliott, of which 500 are
women students. The total quota of
women has been filled, so there will be
no more women registered. The regis
tration of men, however, is expected to
reach a much higher figure by tonight,
as a great number have delayed registra
tion until today. The new students num
ber 102, of which 50 are women stu
dents.
