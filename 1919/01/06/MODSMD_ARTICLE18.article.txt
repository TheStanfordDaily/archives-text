# PROFESSOR CAMERON
## 
### 
The University was shocked and saddened this moruing by the announce
ment of the death last night of Henry Lewin Cannon, associate professor of his
tory. The loss, a severe one to the world of letters and historical research and
to the Stanford faculty and History Department, is also deeply felt by those of
the students who knew him, and their numbers are far from small.
Though prevented by delicate health from devoting his full energies to his
University work, his influence was of importance in every held of history as
taught in Stanford. But it was his character, as illustrated in the classroom,
which endeared him to the Stanford men and women who were fortunate enough
to have classes under him. Always sympathetic with the difficulties and troubles
of his students, he was never too busy to give a word of advice and assistance
to those who needed it, and his lectures were always filled with a sympathetic
understanding of human nature that is all too infrequent in this world.
