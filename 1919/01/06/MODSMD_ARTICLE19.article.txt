# DAILY PLANS

### 
Owing to lack of time to complete arrangements for the change, the Daily
Palo Alto will not be able to comc every day this week as originally planned,
but will appear Wednesday and Friday as last quarter. Beginning next Monday,
however, the Daily will revert to its former status, and will put out five issues a
week.
