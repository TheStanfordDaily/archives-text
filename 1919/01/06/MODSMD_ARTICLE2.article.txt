# Basketball Will Commence Tonight
## Williamson Back in College to Add Strength to Cardinal 
### 
Varsity basketball men take their in
itial shot at the indoor sport tonight in
Encina gym. From the appearance of
the gang that turned out for places on
the five, competition will be stronger
than ever before for places. F. W. Wil
liamson, center until he was injured on
the team last year, and a big fast player,
turned up last night and will putin his
oar for a place along with Moulton,
Hood, Bucklin, Pelouze, Lilly, Righter,
Swanholm and Fairchilds.
Student Manager W. I. Ames is al
ready busy arranging a schedule for the
team. Basketball has taken a big jump
around the bay this year, and several
fives have announced their plan of play
ing the Cardinal, providing Stanford is
willing.
Athletics officials are busy at present
negotiating for one of the best men in
the country to coach the team. Word
should be received from the new mentor
within a few days.
While waiting for the coach, informal
practices will be in line. The University
of California and most of the other col
lege teams around the bay started bas
ketball last term, but since the Blue and
Gold institution will not open for busi
ness for some time yet, Stanford will
have an opportunity to catch up on prac
tice. As soon as the coach arrives on
the scene, formal practice will start.

Rugby plans arc still up in the air.
California has announced that she will
play Stanford a game in this sport next
quarter, in line with an agreement made
with the S. A. T. C. last quarter, and
as soon as the Berkeley institution starts
up again, they will probably start prac
ticc. In the meantime Stanford can
back water, for with the list of rugby
men back on the campus, California will
have to go a long way before she can
hope to put up strong competition in
rugby.
