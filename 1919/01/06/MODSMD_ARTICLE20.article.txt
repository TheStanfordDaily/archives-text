# PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT DIES
## 
### 
The world was shocked this mo: - :,
ing by the news of the death of ex-
I'resident Roosevelt. Despite the fact
that Colonel Roosevelt had been ailing
from pulmonary trouble for some time,
the news came as a complete surprise
1. The end came this morning
o'clock.
>fessor E. E. Robinson of the His
department, lias paid the follow
ing tribute to the ex-President in the
accompanying special interview for
the Daily Palo Alto:
"Theodore Roosevelt was the most
remarkable American to appear in our
day. At a time( the middle SO's) when
ambitious men usually entered business.
Roosevelt, an A: B. from Harvard in
1880, 'went into politics.' A political be
ing be remained to the end, distin
guished sportsman and eminent histo
rian though lie was. His 'Winning of
the West,' the first volume of which
was published in 1889, has become a
classic among the studies of the ex
pansion of the United States. His lat
est contribution in book form revealed
in its title the nature of the interests
that have dominated his thought and
action since the spring of 1915. Na
tional Foes and International Duty"
embodied lectures delivered at Prince
ton in 1917.
"But important though his historical
writings were, particularly his biograph
ical" studies, and powerful in effect as
were his editorials and special articles
on public affair , it was as an active
participant in politico that he will ap
pear in American history. Fighter by
nature and preacher by impulse, he car
ried into the legislative halls at Albany,
into his work as police administrator
at New York City, in his work as as
sistant secretary of the navy just prior

to the Spanish war, and to his seven
and one-half years in the presidency,
what seemed at times literally limitless
energy in combatting programs and op
ponents and in urging upon the Ameri
can people the virtues and principles of
simple morality.
"His presidency is too near at hand to
! make helpful, brief comment. Hut all
j who lived through the years that im~
j mediately followed the Spanish War
j know with what heightened feeling the
i American people took up the task of a
world power. It cannot but seem that
Roosevelt was the embodiment of this
new impulse, particularly after he ac
' ceded to the presidency in 1901.
"The period of his great power is of
' course coincident with his presidency,
perhaps the highest point of power im
mediately following his re-election in
1901. But he was a great power long
before that, as far as he could reach
through the offices he held. And since
1919 he has profoundly influenced the
selection of his successors. He named
I'aft in 1909, and it was the introduc
tion of Roosevelt's candidacy'at the head
of the third party that brought about
the elevation of Wilson in 1913. The
influence of Mr. Roosevelt and the char
acter of his appeal have changed some
what since 1915, but in spite of this fact
lie remained to the end the most strik
ing figure of his generation."

I'resident Roosevelt. Despite the fact
that Colonel Roosevelt had been ailing
from pulmonary trouble for some time,
the news came as a complete surprise

accompanying special interview for
the Daily Palo Alto:
"Theodore Roosevelt was the most
remarkable American to appear in our
day. At a time( the middle SO's) when
ambitious men usually entered business.
Roosevelt, an A: B. from Harvard in
1880, 'went into politics.' A political be
ing be remained to the end, distin
guished sportsman and eminent histo
rian though lie was. His 'Winning of
the West,' the first volume of which
was published in 1889, has become a
classic among the studies of the ex
pansion of the United States. His lat
est contribution in book form revealed
in its title the nature of the interests
that have dominated his thought and
action since the spring of 1915. Na
tional Foes and International Duty"
embodied lectures delivered at Prince
ton in 1917.
"But important though his historical
writings were, particularly his biograph
ical" studies, and powerful in effect as
were his editorials and special articles
on public affair , it was as an active
participant in politico that he will ap
pear in American history. Fighter by
nature and preacher by impulse, he car
ried into the legislative halls at Albany,
into his work as police administrator
at New York City, in his work as as
sistant secretary of the navy just prior

to the Spanish war, and to his seven
and one-half years in the presidency,
what seemed at times literally limitless
energy in combatting programs and op
ponents and in urging upon the Ameri
can people the virtues and principles of
simple morality.
"His presidency is too near at hand to
! make helpful, brief comment. Hut all
j who lived through the years that im~
j mediately followed the Spanish War
j know with what heightened feeling the
i American people took up the task of a
world power. It cannot but seem that
Roosevelt was the embodiment of this
new impulse, particularly after he ac
' ceded to the presidency in 1901.
"The period of his great power is of
' course coincident with his presidency,
perhaps the highest point of power im
mediately following his re-election in
1901. But he was a great power long
before that, as far as he could reach
through the offices he held. And since
1919 he has profoundly influenced the
selection of his successors. He named
I'aft in 1909, and it was the introduc
tion of Roosevelt's candidacy'at the head
of the third party that brought about
the elevation of Wilson in 1913. The
influence of Mr. Roosevelt and the char
acter of his appeal have changed some
what since 1915, but in spite of this fact
lie remained to the end the most strik
ing figure of his generation."
