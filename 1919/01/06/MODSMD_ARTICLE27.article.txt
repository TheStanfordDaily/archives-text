# CALIFORNIA POSTPONES OPENING INDEFINITELY
## 
### 
Owing to the sudden increase in the
number of "flue" cases reported in
Berkeley and vicinity during the past
week, (he University of California has
postponed the day of registration until
a week from today, or perhaps later.
Over seventy new cases developed
yesterday in Berkeley alone and as
the number of fases has increased
greatly during the past week, it was
1 thought better to postpone the day of
registration, which was formerly set
for today. Many of the students, not
knowing of the delayed opening, have
already returned and are wondering
what they are going to do to keep
occupied.
No definite date of reopening the
university has yet been announced, al
though it is hoped that the "flu" will
be sufficiently under control to start
work on the 13th.
