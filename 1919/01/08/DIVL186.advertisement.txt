STANFORD SAVINGS BANK
Every family in Palo Alto would do well to have at least one mem
ber as a Savings Depositor in The Stanford Bank, even if the account
were started only with $1. In the pass-book you would find our liberal
rules for computing your interest on savings, which were drawn look
ing from the Depositor's viewpoint as well as the Bank's. No Bank
in the State has more generous provisions for allowing its Savings
Depositors to withdraw their funds without forfeiture of earned inter
est, for the purpose of making an investment at a higher rate or other
use, than The Stanford Bank. We have Savings Depositors who live
as far away as distant Alaska, many who now live in other California
towns, and Washington, Oregon and Idaho, who transact their Savings
business with us entirely by mail, thus securing the protection of our
State Law and advantages of our superior service.
This Hank pays over $4,000.00 a year in interest to thrifty savers.
Are you one of them? If not, this is the time when you could transfer
a part of your funds to this Bank, as a trial deposit, without loss to
yourself.
