# McDOWELL addresses ENCINA CLUB MEETING
## 
### 
J. E. McDowell, Dean of Men ad
dressed the first meeting of Encina Club
of the year Monday night in the club
room. He spoke of the failure with
which student control had met during
the two occasions when it had been tried
before, but stated that one more at
tempt would be made to test its feasi
bility. He asked that the "side-shows"
of college life be cut out and that Stan
ford's scholarship record be 'kept up.
The meeting found many of the old
Encina men returned. The club room
was well filled and those who could not
get inside climbed on the banisters out
side the doors.
