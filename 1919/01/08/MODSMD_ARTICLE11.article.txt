M. C. Evans, "Fighting Bob," as he is
known to sport lovers in the Middle
West, arrived on the campus yesterday
to take charge of spring sports at Stan
ford this year. To welcome the new
coach and to give athletics a good boost
following the reign of S. A. T. C. au
thorities, a big old-time rally will be
held in Encina Hall tomorrow night at
7 :30, when, sign-ups will be held for all
sports and university men will be given
a chance to get acquainted with the new
mentor.
Evans is known all over the country
for his fighting spirit combined with a
thorough knowledge of athletics. He
attended collegc in Illinois and while
there made the all-state team in three
branches of sportâ€”baseball, basketball,
and football. When he graduated from
: college his power was recognized to such
.an extent thae w>-,t)--vui iuT tneir
pitching staffs. He chose to go into
coaching lines, however, and went to the
University of Colorado as athletic di
| rector. In the first year of his stay there
Evans brought a consistent last-place
football team to second place in the
Inter-Mountain Conference, and next
year with an entirely green team dupli
cated his performance. Last year Evans
in basketball turned out the champion
team of the Mountain States.
The new coach is but twenty-nine
years of age, is small, but his every ac
tion impresses one with fighting spirit,
i On the coaching lines he is a strict disci
plinarian in trailing and in obedience to
his commands. However, in opposition
to the old-type of coach, Evans gets his
support from the team by ability to show
I how a thing should be done, rather than
Iby domineering methods,
i Evans will be introduced to the cam
pus Thursday night at the rally in En
cina Hall. Sign-ups for basketball, base
ball, track, and rugby will be held, and
the captains of these various teams will
make their customary appeals for candi
dates for the teams. Evans is extremely
anxious to have all the men who wish
