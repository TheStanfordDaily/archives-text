With the arrival of the coach, Stanford athletics should start off on the
old scale without delay. Spring sports have always been particularly impor
tant at Stanford, and in track have been scored the most consistent string
of Cardinal victories. Now that peace conditions have returned, there is no
reason that the record of the rather unfortunate season of S. A. T. C. athletics
last fall should be repeated. None of the spring sports have been retarded
by the lack of organization last quarter, with the possible exception of basket
ball, and the harm done to basketball need not be serious if proper opportun
ity and facilities are given for practice. All now necessary for the beginning
of a successful season of spring sports is a creditable turnout, both from
freshmen and the older classes.
Formidable lists of former heroes of the track, field, and court returning
from war should not deter other men from going out for the same sports. All
cannot make the first teams, but there are second teams as well, and more
years to come. And by the Stanford athletic policy, the end sought is the
greatest good to the greatest number, and not the putting out of crack teams
in any sport to the exclusion of giving attention to those men who do not
make the Varsity.
With the coach on hand, and the nucleus for the first teams on
hand, a proper turnout and proper support by the student body will make
for a particularly successful season of spring sports at Stanford.
