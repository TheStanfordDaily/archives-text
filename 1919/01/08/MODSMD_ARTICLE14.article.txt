Season tickets for the Peninsula Musi
cal Association concert course, to be
given in the Assembly Hall during the
sale at the campus booKstdre,~' , «nta
should be purchased by intending mem
bers before Saturday next, when season
tickets are exchangeable for reserved
seats at the University Pharmacy in
Palo Alto. Never before, in the seven
years' existence of thi sassociation, has
the student membership been so small
as this year, and it is hoped that a num
ber will take advantage of the con
venience of having the tickets placed on
sale at the bookstore between now and
Saturday.
There are four concerts in the course,
all of them selected from the finest at
tractions offered in San Francisco dur
ing the season. The first is to take place
on Thursday evening, January 16, and
will be given by Miss Lucy Gates and
the Trio de Lutece. Miss Gates is a
Salt Lake City woman who had made a
sensation in grand opera roles in Europe
when the war obliged her to come home.
Her success in this country has been
both brilliant and sustained. She ap
peared as understudy for Galli-Curci
last season, and is rated by the Italian
prima donna as the finest of American
coloratura sopranos.
The Trio de Lutece is made up of
George Barrere, the most famous flute
player in the world; Carlos Salzedo,
harpist, and Paul Kefer, 'cellist. Both
Salzedo and Kefer were for several

I seasons soloists with the Metropolitan
land New York Philharmonic orches-
I tras. Nothing finer is scheduled for the
j Pacific Coast this season than the con
i cert which the Stanford community will
ibe privileged to hear on their own
I ground. The program will be published
next week.
