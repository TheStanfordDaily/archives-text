## Majority of Old Stars Return to the Support of the Cardinal 
### 
Tennis is off again for the new year.
Inter-class and inter-fraternity tourna
ments will be started shortly to enable
the then to work out the stiff joints and
get going with the old-time spirit. Prac
tice has already started and the present
good weather allows a good two hours'
workout in the afternoon on the Encina
courts.
Prospects never looked brighter for
a winning team than they do this year.
Barry and Doolittlc of last year's Vars
ity have not returned, while Turner of
last year's freshman team is likewise un
able to come back, but with these three
exceptions all the old men are back and
a promising lot of new men as well.
Among the old men who have returned
arc Allen Barber, captain of the '17
team; Wylic Bent, last year's captain,
and Art Devlin, captain-elect. Launs
berry Fish, C. C. Crosby, and other old
stars arc also registered this year.
Not to be outdone by the Varsity, the
frosh class has a promising lot of ma
terial, in which arc Tussues, Davies and
Chapman.
Captain Devlin is working hard with
the team and under his aide leadership
Stanford seems about due to put it over
on U. C. this year. However, the hearty
cooperation of all those interested in the
sport is asked to assure a winning sea
son. Those interested in tennis are
urged to get into the game. Practice is
being held every afternoon on the En
cina courts.
