The Chimes
"Through the balm}' air of night,
How they ring out their delight!
From the molten-golden notes,
And all in tunc."
The history of the .Stanford hells is
an interesting one. In 1900 they were
brought to California and placed in the
tower of the newly constructed Me
morial Church. They were ordered by
Mrs. Stanford from the celebrated firm
of Meenelly of Troy, in New York, and
were made by them.
The largest bell weighs nearly three
quarters of a ton, the smaller being
about 400 pounds in weight. They arc
made of copper, tin and antimony, and
are so tuned that they strike the proper
notes in relation to each other. The
music of the chime is the same as "The
Handel lot '~ , >nmosed bv
tower in the House of Parliament in
Westminster, London. The hour bell
bears the following inscription : "Chimes
of the Memorial Church, erected to the

memory of Leland Stanford by his wife,
Jane Lathrop Stanford, A. D. 1900."
Mr. McConncll of San Francisco, an
old watchmaker, was engaged to set
the,bells in position. In the process of)
his work he grew to love them, and j
proudly described "his bells" as "the best'
that had ever come West." In the great!
earthquake of 1906 the bells fell with the
church, and it was not until nine years
later, on May 6, 1915, when they were
restored, that their music floated once
again out over the red-tiled quad. This j
time they were placed in the present I
seventy-foot tower located between the
Mechanics and Machinery buildings, and
directly facing the quadrangle. Only
one facc of the clock, which was made j
by the Sctli Thomas Company, of Con- j
necticut, for a four-faced tower with a
seven-foot dial, is shown. But this is
only a temporary home, and some day,
the bells will be placed in tneir uiu posi
tion once more and the four pair of
hands of the great clock will be seen
from all parts of the campus.
