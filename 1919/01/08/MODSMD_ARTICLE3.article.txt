# Stage Terrific Battle on Row

### 
Dear Pa:
This letter is just to let you know that
if laughter makes one healthy, we up
perclassmen of Stanford ought to just
bubble forth health after such spectacles
as the classes of '21 and '22 so kindly
provided at noon today.
Pa, I'm glad I'm out of the army,
because the war couldn't hold a candle
to what has been going on here today.
In the misty hours of morning botii the
frosh and the sophs got together se
cretly and planned to make a clean
sweep of each other before the after
noon tieup. And like true heroes, both
classes set the time for 12 o'clock as the
right hour to pounce on their unsuspect
ing victims.
Goodnight, Pa. You had ought to of
seen that fight! Why, a Frosh would
come tearing around one corner of a
house and, speeding with the wind, make
for the nearest foothills. Then around
the other corner of the same house a
soph would tear madly in 'the opposite
direction. And, Pa, where all of them
went to so quick I don't know, but in
about less time than it takes to see Pres
ident Wilbur every singk' member of
both classes had vanished.
Well, anyhow, it was lots of fun, but
I kind of wish it had happened after I
had finished my dinner, because my hot
dogs got cold while I was spectating.
Well. Pa. I lioue von well and I
Your dutitul son,
Henry.
