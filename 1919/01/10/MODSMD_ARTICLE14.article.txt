# FOUR SPORTS ARE GIVEN SEND-OFF IN BIG ENCINA RALLY
## MANY OLD STARS BACK 183 Men Sign Up for Track, Rugby, Baseball and Basketball 
### 
Although smaller in numbers, the
spirit shown and the results achieved at
the springs sports rally at Encina last
night would equal that at any rally ever
held by Cardinal enthusiasts. From the
time the noisy procession started down
the Row until the last strains of "Hail,
Stanford, Hail," died away, there was
a spirit of fight and "jazz" that seemed
to sound a death note of warning to the
Golden Bear across the bay.
Old Stars Return
One of the most noticeable features
of the rally was the return to the
j "Farm" of many of the old-time stars
and athletic leaders. "Bobby" Pelouze,
"Swede" Righter, "Reg" Caughey, and
others have returned to add strength to
the Cardinal's ranks.
One hundred forty-three men signed
!up for different branches of spring
sports and others are expected to add
their names to the list.
"Ken" Lilly, '19, president of the stu
dent body and rantain **-- '- ±0
uan team, opened up the rally by outlin
ing the outlook for spring sports. Four
ma.ior sports will be flayed this spring.
They are basketball, rugby, baseball, and
track. Lilly made a call for every man
to get out, stay out, and either make the
team or back it.
j "Cracky" Teitsworth, '19, track cap
| tain, made a call for track candidates,
; but advised the men t.o start in at some
other sport until the weather warmed
up. Active track training will probably
not begin until about the middle of Feb
ruary, as the track meet is slated to
come later this year than usual on ac
count of the full program for the spring
' season. Prospects are bright for scor
ing the eighth straight victory over Cali
fornia. Several old stars are back, and

"Reg" Caughey, captain-elect of last
year's varsity, appealed to new men to
get out for track. He attributes as
much credit to a hard-working third
place man as to a natural star who takes
his fifteen points without any trouble.
"Swede" Righter advised the fresh
men to get out for basketball and help
j score a freshman victory over the Blue
I and Gold.
"Hugh" Galloway, baseball captain,
outlined the baseball hopes and called
for a big turnout of material when ac
tive training begins about January 25.
Evans Praises Cardinal Spirit
"Fighting Bob" Evans, Stanford's new
coach, sounded the keynote of the whole
rally when he said: "I have been
around here about four days, and have
already come to realize that the real
reason for having all these varsity teams
around here is to trim California.
'Everybody seems to be working with
one end in view—to whip the Blue and
Gold."
Evans is enthusiastic over the spirit
shown and believes that he has material
to turn out some of the best teams that
jever wore Cardinal jerseys. One luin
dred per cent, he says, is in getting the
men out.
"It takes brains, not beef, to make a
good athlete. Sixty per cent of a good
athlete is brains, the other forty per cent
is fight."
An exceptionally large number of men
signed for different branches of athletics.
I Track, with sixty-live candidates, at
tracted the largest number. Other
figures were as follows: Rugby, thirty;
J baseball, forty-one; basketball, forty
seven. A few men signed for two or
more sports.

Although smaller in numbers, the
spirit shown and the results achieved at
the springs sports rally at Encina last
night would equal that at any rally ever
held by Cardinal enthusiasts. From the
time the noisy procession started down
the Row until the last strains of "Hail,
Stanford, Hail," died away, there was
a spirit of fight and "jazz" that seemed
to sound a death note of warning to the
Golden Bear across the bay.
Old Stars Return
One of the most noticeable features
of the rally was the return to the
j "Farm" of many of the old-time stars
and athletic leaders. "Bobby" Pelouze,
"Swede" Righter, "Reg" Caughey, and
others have returned to add strength to
the Cardinal's ranks.
One hundred forty-three men signed
!up for different branches of spring
sports and others are expected to add
their names to the list.
"Ken" Lilly, '19, president of the stu
dent body and rantain **-- '- ±0
uan team, opened up the rally by outlin
ing the outlook for spring sports. Four
ma.ior sports will be flayed this spring.
They are basketball, rugby, baseball, and
track. Lilly made a call for every man
to get out, stay out, and either make the
team or back it.
j "Cracky" Teitsworth, '19, track cap

other sport until the weather warmed
up. Active track training will probably
not begin until about the middle of Feb

"Reg" Caughey, captain-elect of last
year's varsity, appealed to new men to
get out for track. He attributes as
much credit to a hard-working third
place man as to a natural star who takes
his fifteen points without any trouble.
"Swede" Righter advised the fresh
men to get out for basketball and help
j score a freshman victory over the Blue
I and Gold.
"Hugh" Galloway, baseball captain,
outlined the baseball hopes and called
for a big turnout of material when ac

Evans Praises Cardinal Spirit
"Fighting Bob" Evans, Stanford's new
coach, sounded the keynote of the whole
rally when he said: "I have been
around here about four days, and have
already come to realize that the real
reason for having all these varsity teams
around here is to trim California.
'Everybody seems to be working with
one end in view—to whip the Blue and
Gold."
Evans is enthusiastic over the spirit
shown and believes that he has material
to turn out some of the best teams that
jever wore Cardinal jerseys. One luin
dred per cent, he says, is in getting the
men out.
"It takes brains, not beef, to make a
good athlete. Sixty per cent of a good
athlete is brains, the other forty per cent
is fight."
An exceptionally large number of men
signed for different branches of athletics.
I Track, with sixty-live candidates, at
tracted the largest number. Other
figures were as follows: Rugby, thirty;
J baseball, forty-one; basketball, forty
seven. A few men signed for two or
more sports.

Although smaller in numbers, the
spirit shown and the results achieved at
the springs sports rally at Encina last
night would equal that at any rally ever
held by Cardinal enthusiasts. From the
time the noisy procession started down
the Row until the last strains of "Hail,
Stanford, Hail," died away, there was
a spirit of fight and "jazz" that seemed
to sound a death note of warning to the
Golden Bear across the bay.
Old Stars Return
One of the most noticeable features
of the rally was the return to the
j "Farm" of many of the old-time stars
and athletic leaders. "Bobby" Pelouze,
"Swede" Righter, "Reg" Caughey, and
others have returned to add strength to
the Cardinal's ranks.
One hundred forty-three men signed
!up for different branches of spring
sports and others are expected to add
their names to the list.
"Ken" Lilly, '19, president of the stu
dent body and rantain **-- '- ±0
uan team, opened up the rally by outlin
ing the outlook for spring sports. Four
ma.ior sports will be flayed this spring.
They are basketball, rugby, baseball, and
track. Lilly made a call for every man
to get out, stay out, and either make the
team or back it.
j "Cracky" Teitsworth, '19, track cap

other sport until the weather warmed
up. Active track training will probably
not begin until about the middle of Feb

"Reg" Caughey, captain-elect of last
year's varsity, appealed to new men to
get out for track. He attributes as
much credit to a hard-working third
place man as to a natural star who takes
his fifteen points without any trouble.
"Swede" Righter advised the fresh
men to get out for basketball and help
j score a freshman victory over the Blue
I and Gold.
"Hugh" Galloway, baseball captain,
outlined the baseball hopes and called
for a big turnout of material when ac

Evans Praises Cardinal Spirit
"Fighting Bob" Evans, Stanford's new
coach, sounded the keynote of the whole
rally when he said: "I have been
around here about four days, and have
already come to realize that the real
reason for having all these varsity teams
around here is to trim California.
'Everybody seems to be working with
one end in view—to whip the Blue and
Gold."
Evans is enthusiastic over the spirit
shown and believes that he has material
to turn out some of the best teams that
jever wore Cardinal jerseys. One luin
dred per cent, he says, is in getting the
men out.
"It takes brains, not beef, to make a
good athlete. Sixty per cent of a good
athlete is brains, the other forty per cent
is fight."
An exceptionally large number of men
signed for different branches of athletics.
I Track, with sixty-live candidates, at
tracted the largest number. Other
figures were as follows: Rugby, thirty;
J baseball, forty-one; basketball, forty
seven. A few men signed for two or
more sports.

Although smaller in numbers, the
spirit shown and the results achieved at
the springs sports rally at Encina last
night would equal that at any rally ever
held by Cardinal enthusiasts. From the
time the noisy procession started down
the Row until the last strains of "Hail,
Stanford, Hail," died away, there was
a spirit of fight and "jazz" that seemed
to sound a death note of warning to the
Golden Bear across the bay.
Old Stars Return
One of the most noticeable features
of the rally was the return to the
j "Farm" of many of the old-time stars
and athletic leaders. "Bobby" Pelouze,
"Swede" Righter, "Reg" Caughey, and
others have returned to add strength to
the Cardinal's ranks.
One hundred forty-three men signed
!up for different branches of spring
sports and others are expected to add
their names to the list.
"Ken" Lilly, '19, president of the stu
dent body and rantain **-- '- ±0
uan team, opened up the rally by outlin
ing the outlook for spring sports. Four
ma.ior sports will be flayed this spring.
They are basketball, rugby, baseball, and
track. Lilly made a call for every man
to get out, stay out, and either make the
team or back it.
j "Cracky" Teitsworth, '19, track cap
| tain, made a call for track candidates,
; but advised the men t.o start in at some
other sport until the weather warmed
up. Active track training will probably
not begin until about the middle of Feb
ruary, as the track meet is slated to
come later this year than usual on ac
count of the full program for the spring
' season. Prospects are bright for scor
ing the eighth straight victory over Cali
fornia. Several old stars are back, and
Tietsworth is' looking for new men to
Teitsworth is looking for new men to
"Reg" Caughey, captain-elect of last
year's varsity, appealed to new men to
get out for track. He attributes as
much credit to a hard-working third
place man as to a natural star who takes
his fifteen points without any trouble.
"Swede" Righter advised the fresh
men to get out for basketball and help
j score a freshman victory over the Blue
I and Gold.
"Hugh" Galloway, baseball captain,
outlined the baseball hopes and called
for a big turnout of material when ac
tive training begins about January 25.
Evans Praises Cardinal Spirit
"Fighting Bob" Evans, Stanford's new
coach, sounded the keynote of the whole
rally when he said: "I have been
around here about four days, and have
already come to realize that the real
reason for having all these varsity teams
around here is to trim California.
'Everybody seems to be working with
one end in view—to whip the Blue and
Gold."
Evans is enthusiastic over the spirit
shown and believes that he has material
to turn out some of the best teams that
jever wore Cardinal jerseys. One luin
dred per cent, he says, is in getting the
men out.
"It takes brains, not beef, to make a
good athlete. Sixty per cent of a good
athlete is brains, the other forty per cent
is fight."
An exceptionally large number of men
signed for different branches of athletics.
I Track, with sixty-live candidates, at
tracted the largest number. Other
figures were as follows: Rugby, thirty;
J baseball, forty-one; basketball, forty
seven. A few men signed for two or
more sports.
