# FOUR SPORTS ARE GIVEN SEND-OFF IN BIG ENCINA RALLY
## MANY OLD STARS BACK 183 Men Sign Up for Track, Rugby, Baseball and Basketball 
### 
Although smaller in numbers, the
spirit shown and the results achieved at
the springs sports rally at Encina last
night would equal that at any rally ever
held by Cardinal enthusiasts. From the
time the noisy procession started down
the Row until the last strains of "Hail,
Stanford, Hail," died away, there was
a spirit of fight and "jazz" that seemed
to sound a death note of warning to the
Golden Bear across the bay.
Old Stars Return
One of the most noticeable features
of the rally was the return to the
j "Farm" of many of the old-time stars
and athletic leaders. "Bobby" Pelouze,
"Swede" Righter, "Reg" Caughey, and
others have returned to add strength to
the Cardinal's ranks.
One hundred forty-three men signed
!up for different branches of spring
sports and others are expected to add
their names to the list.
"Ken" Lilly, '19, president of the stu
dent body and rantain **-- '- Â±0
uan team, opened up the rally by outlin
ing the outlook for spring sports. Four
ma.ior sports will be flayed this spring.
They are basketball, rugby, baseball, and
track. Lilly made a call for every man
to get out, stay out, and either make the
team or back it.
j "Cracky" Teitsworth, '19, track cap
| tain, made a call for track candidates,
; but advised the men t.o start in at some
other sport until the weather warmed
up. Active track training will probably
not begin until about the middle of Feb
ruary, as the track meet is slated to
come later this year than usual on ac
count of the full program for the spring
' season. Prospects are bright for scor
ing the eighth straight victory over Cali
fornia. Several old stars are back, and

"Reg" Caughey, captain-elect of last
year's varsity, appealed to new men to
get out for track. He attributes as
much credit to a hard-working third
place man as to a natural star who takes
his fifteen points without any trouble.
"Swede" Righter advised the fresh
men to get out for basketball and help
j score a freshman victory over the Blue
I and Gold.
