# STUDENT CONTROL
## 
### 
In his talks to the men of the University the Dean of Men dwelt at length on
the subject of student control, but did not outline any definite plan on the subject.
Ibis was his purpose, for the best kind of a workable plan for student control
will be one worked in harmony by the students and faculty together, and certainly
not one of which the student body does not approve in advance.
The student body, owing to the stress and disorganization of last year, was
relieved of the responsibility of student control for the duration of the war. This
action has met with almost universal approval. But as the University returns to
normal conditions, and cords and sombreros are seen with ever-growing frequency
on the Quad, the question of student control is bound to return.
The first difference of opinion is bound to be whether or not student control
is desirable. While the student opinion as to the value of the former system of
control may not be so adverse as that of the faculty, no one believes that this sys
tem was an unqualified success, and a proposal to revert to it will find few sup
porters. As we are not going back to the old scheme, there will be some senti
ment for not returning to student control in any form, and leaving the whole mat
ter of punishment of student wrong-doers to the faculty. The Daily Palo Alto
believes, however, that the weight of opinion of both students and faculty will be
to try to devise a better system of student control ; not because of lack of confi
dence in the faculty committee tn deal justly, fairly, and sympathetically with all
cases before it, but because self-government is one of the most fundamental
courses in training for citizenship, and students in a university such as Stanford
ought to have uh much practice as possible in self-government. What plan shall
be adopted for a new and better form of student self-government?
