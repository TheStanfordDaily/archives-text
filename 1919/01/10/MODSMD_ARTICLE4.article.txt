# Alumni Section for Victory Quad
## Junoir Year Book Will Have Portion Devoted to Stanford Grads 
### 
By working in conjunction with the
manager and editor who were elected
last quarter, the newly appointed editor
and manager are striving to make the
1920 "Victory" Quad the biggest and
best of any Quads that a junior class
has hithertofore put out. Vague plans
of last quarter are beginning to take
concrete shapes and many of the hopes
of last quarter are already realized.
One of the new sections that has
never before been attempted in the
Quad is the "alumni section." This new
part of the yearbook is to be devoted
to the recording of the work of those
Stanford alumni who have done their
part in winning the war by the civilian
work they have done. This section is
to be entirely separate from that part of
achievements of those men who for the
the book that will be devoted to the
last four years have carried the name
of Stanford University "over there"
and into the training camps in this
country and in Canada.
There will lie at least 25 pages set
aside for the "alumni section." The
management is planning to have over 20
pages of pictures of famous alumni of
the University who have not donned
the khaki. The pictures on the first
page of the section will be of Senator
Ltland Stanford, Lelaml Stanford, Jun
ior, and two other members of the
Stanford family who have been closely
connected with the University, and a
picture of David Starr Jordan. On the
first page of the section will be pictures
of such alumni as Herbert Hoover and
President Wilbur.
This section, dedicated to the men
and wflmen of the Stanford alumni who
have served their country in civilian
life, is but one of the many new fea
tnr.c> of the 1920 "Victory" Quad.
