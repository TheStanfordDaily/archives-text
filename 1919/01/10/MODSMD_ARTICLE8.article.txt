Ram's Head Society will stage a mu
sical extravaganza on February 21, the
night before the Washington's Birth
day vacation. This was decided at a
meeting of the society held last Wed
nesday evening.
Like all Ram's Head shows, only
men will participate in the production,

male impersonators. Ram's Head is
urging every man in college who can
sing, dance, or act, to try out for the
show. As it is planned to take the
production out of town following the
local staging of the piece, a large,
well-trained cast is imperative. Any
man who tries out will be given every
opportunity to indicate his ability. The
preliminary tryouts will be conducted
Tuesday evening at 7:30 in the Assem
bly Hall.
