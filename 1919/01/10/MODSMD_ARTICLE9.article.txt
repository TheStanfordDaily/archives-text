# Will Elect Yell Leaders as of Yore
## 
### 
As announced at the rally last night,
prospective yell leaders will be chosen
by the pre-war system of election. In
stead of nomination by the Executive
Committee and election by popular vote
as in the preceding quarter, tryoutees are
to be judged by the results they secure
at the preliminary games of basketball
and rugby. This will give each one a
chance to demonstrate what he can do,
and assures a popular choice.
The position of yell leader this year
offers an excellent opportunity to do
something for Stanford, as there is a
full schedule of sports not only in one
line, but in four, and the job offers all
the advantages that it held in the years
before the war.
Only Juniors are eligible, and those of
the '20 class who possess any kind of
ability to lead a cheer should see "Monk"
Antrim at the Theta Delta Chi house
next Wednesday evening at 7:30.
