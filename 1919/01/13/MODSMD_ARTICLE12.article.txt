# UNIVERSITY SETS ASIDE THE ENTIRE WEEK FOR DRIVE
## AUTHORITIES ASK AID President Wilson Solicits Help for Suffering Armenians 
### 
So urgent is the need for immediate
financial aid in the Near East that this
week has been specially set aside by
the University authorities for the pur
pose of raising money to be used in
Syrian and Armenian relief work. The
State Council of National Defense ap
pointed Miss Isabel McCracken, Dr. D.
Gardiner, Dr. G. Price and Dean G. E.
McDowell to take charge of the Stan
ford drive, and everything has been
done to insure a successful campaign.
The committee is working through the
Women's War Board and other organ
izations to raise immediate money for
use In the East during the months of
January, February and March.
It should be understood that the ap
propriation by Congress of $100,000,-
000 will not be used for Syrian or
Armenian relief work, and it is there
fore all the more important that the
people of America should be liberal
in their contributions for such a cause.
The American government is strongly
supporting the drive, and the follow
ing: proclamation of President Wilson
is in itself an urgent appeal for help:
"For more than three years Ameri
can philanthropy has been a large fac
tor in keeping alive Armenian, Syrian,
Greek and other exiles and refugees of
Western Asia.
"On two former occasions I have
appealed to the American people in
behalf of these homeless sufferers,
whom the vicissitudes of war and mas
sacre had brought to the extremest
need.
"The response has been most gen
erous, but now the period of rehabili
tation is at hand. Vastly larger sums
will be required to restore these once
prosperous, but now impoverished,
refugees to their former homes than
were required merely to sustain life
in their desert exile.
"It is estimated that about 4,000,000
Armenian, Syrian, Greek and other
war sufferers in the Near East will
require outside help to sustain their
homeland. The vast majority of them
are helpless women and children, in
| eluding 400,000 orphans.
I"The American Committee for Re
lief in the Near East is appealing for
a minimum of $30,000,000 to be sub
scribed January 12, 1019, with which
to meet the most urgent needs of these
people.
"T therefore again call upon the peo
ple of the United States to make even
more generous contributions than they
, have made heretofore to sustair
I through the winter months those who
through no fault of their own, have
been left in a starving, shelterless
condition, and to * help re-establish
these ancient and sorely oppressed
people in their former homes on a
self-supporting basis.

So urgent is the need for immediate
financial aid in the Near East that this
week has been specially set aside by
the University authorities for the pur
pose of raising money to be used in
Syrian and Armenian relief work. The
State Council of National Defense ap
pointed Miss Isabel McCracken, Dr. D.
Gardiner, Dr. G. Price and Dean G. E.
McDowell to take charge of the Stan
ford drive, and everything has been
done to insure a successful campaign.
The committee is working through the
Women's War Board and other organ
izations to raise immediate money for
use In the East during the months of
January, February and March.
It should be understood that the ap
propriation by Congress of $100,000,-
000 will not be used for Syrian or
Armenian relief work, and it is there
fore all the more important that the
people of America should be liberal
in their contributions for such a cause.
The American government is strongly
supporting the drive, and the follow
ing: proclamation of President Wilson
is in itself an urgent appeal for help:
"For more than three years Ameri
can philanthropy has been a large fac
tor in keeping alive Armenian, Syrian,
Greek and other exiles and refugees of
Western Asia.
"On two former occasions I have
appealed to the American people in
behalf of these homeless sufferers,
whom the vicissitudes of war and mas
sacre had brought to the extremest
need.
"The response has been most gen
erous, but now the period of rehabili
tation is at hand. Vastly larger sums
will be required to restore these once
prosperous, but now impoverished,
refugees to their former homes than
were required merely to sustain life
