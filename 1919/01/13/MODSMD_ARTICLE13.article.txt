### 
Tt was with great regret that the
news of the death of George Britton,
'06, was received on the campus last
Friday afternoon. Mr. Britton passed
away on January 8, after a brief ill
ness in which Spanish influenza de
\ eloped.
Mr. Britton was well known during
his college days at. the University, and
his record of that time was equaled by
the work he accomplished later in edu
cational lines. At the time of his
death Mr. Britton was the supervising
principal of the South San Francisco
school. His death will be a loss to the
community.
