# QUAD DUES
## 
### 
Collecting dues is always a thankless job, and particularly so when dues
are considerable and times are hard. Hence the task of those juniors who are
attempting to separate each member of the class of 1920 from six dollars is
far from an easy one. Under present circumstances it is positively a painful
act for the average junior to deliver up the money for anything so vague and
indefinite as the prospect of a year-book sometime next June. Later, perhaps,
but now —! '
These facts are only natural and illustrative of human nature, but they
don't help out the Quad management in its struggle to put out a book more
than up to the standards of Quads in normal times in a year when expenses
are heavy and juniors are few.
The 1919 Quad was of necessity a war-sized edition, but plans for the 1920
book contemplate a volume even larger and more extensive in character and
make-up than those of previous years. Expenses are of course heavy, and if
these plans are to be carried out to the full extent the management must have
the support of the clt.ss. If paid in January, the dues Avon't have to be paid
again in May, and will go a lot farther at that.
