The New Students
It will be seen from the above list
that the year's registration, which now
numbers 950 students, has been in
creased this semester by 53, of whom
29 are specials and 24 regulars; also
that H2 men and 21 women have en
tered the University this semester.

Military Department
Owing to the small number who reg
istered for military drill and service,
the organization will be discontinued,]
and Lieut. Pyster will probably hand >
in his resignation at once to President t
Jordan. This will necessitate the
withdrawal of the support from the
band, which he lias hitherto aided. It.
is probable, however, that the latter
organization will be continued.
