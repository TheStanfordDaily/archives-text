## THE 						OLD HERMIT 
### 
i The "old hermit," Domingo Grasso.
J who lived for so many years in the
I foothills directly behind the campus.
| will go down in Stanford history and
I will long be remembered by many past
j generations of students.
I It is said that he was brought to this
country from Genoa in 1869 as a vine
yard expert, by a former president of
the San Francisco French Bank. In
1875 Grasso claimed to have discovered
gold on the estate of the well-known
sportsman, P. 15. MacDonough, near
Portola. After that lie devoted himself
to mining and built his small home in
the nearby foothills.
Stanford students soon named him
the "old hermit" and trips to his small
,
I place became a campus habit and tra
! dition. Grasso never lost his dream
; of a rich gold mine and claimed to have
I located many prospects in the hills. Fie

kept his small hut and garden scrupu
lously clean and took great pleasure in
marking off paths and bordering his
spring of bubbling clear water with
whitewashed stones.
On March 9, 1915, the Daily Palo
Alto made an investigation of a report
that the old hermit was ill and found
that he was close to starvation and was
suffering from dropsy. On April IK,
he became partially paralyzed and was
removed by Mrs. Frank Brecesco to the
Menlo Park hospital, where he died
three days later.
Two characteristics will always stand
out in the Stanford student's memory
of the old hermit; his constant refusal
to pose for a photographer and his
hospitable manner to all visitors. Home
made wine of an exceedingly bitter va
riety, was always offered to the new
comer and to have refused would have
been a serious offense.
