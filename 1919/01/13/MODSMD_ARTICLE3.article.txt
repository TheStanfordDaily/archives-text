# Chappie Mills New Talent In Big Glad Hand Issue
## 
### 
"Glad Hand" will be the name of
January's issue of Chaparral. Begin
ning with this issue "Chappie" will com
mence to make his old-time monthly
appearances, with the jovial mitt ex
tended. The price has been reduced to
25 cents per issue and $1 for the re
mainder of the year.
Many old "Chappie" men, such as
"Bones" McDermott, '17, Lloyd Dinkel
spiel. '20, and "Aimer" Glikbarg, '19,
have returned to college this quarter
and insure the success of this number.
Besides these old men, there has been
an overflow of new contributors, espe
cially in the art line, to this issue. Miss
Ruth Taylor, '19, honorary member of
Hammer and Coffin, will probably draw
the cover.
