# CARDINAL SHOULD HAVE STRONG FIVE IN BASKETBALL
## MANY MEN TURN OUT Team Play Will Predominate Coach Evans Developing Fighting Spirit 
### 
By H. G| SWENDSEN, '20
For the lirst time in years Stanford
will have a basketball team. At least
all preliminary indications are to this
effect. Coach "Fighting Boh" Evans
may not be a mentor of fifty years ex
perience. but he surely can teach basket
ball ,and play the game. Already the
men out for the court game have got
ten into the spirit of the new coach's
methods, and show promise of making
great players.
The first test for the Cardinal five
will probably come next Friday, al
though Student Manager W. I. Ames
lias not arranged a game definitely for
this date. It is more than likely that a
team will be here for a game.
Coach Evans believes that hard work
at first' will make a team, and he is
carrying out his beliefs to the limit. A
! combination of hard workouts and
blackboard talks are being used to get
the men used to the new method of
I play.
Despite the fact that Evans will use
many men in every game, there will be
a hard fight for positions this year,
j Moulton, Hood, Pelouze, Bucklin,
; Dinkelspiel, Fairchilds, and Crosby are
| trying for forward, Righter at present
is the only center, and at guard Wil
: liamson. Caughey, Lilly and Johannseu
j are lighting it out.
| With this list of candidates it would
j take more than an expert to pick the
probable line-up. In the first game'
I Coach Evans will probably use all his
| men to try them out in a game, and
the fans will then be able to get a line
up on the players.
The fact that stands out in this year's
preliminary practice, however, is the
i teamwork Coach Evans is driving into
his men. With such a list of men try -
ing out, and with the coach promised,
;i powerful five should be developed.
