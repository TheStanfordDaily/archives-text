# S.F. Call Editor Speaker Tonight
## Barry to Talk on Relation of Written and Spoken Languages 
### 
J. D. Barry, past editor of the San
I" rancisco Bulletin and now connected
with the Call, will address the Uni
versity tonight in the Little Theater at
7:15. He has chosen to speak on a
topic which he feels has a broad appeal
to everyone, as it is so intimately a
part of everyday lifeâ€”"Speaking and
Writing in Relation to Daily Usage."
Mr. Barry is recognized as a prom
inent essayist, poet and critic. He
writes pithy articles for the Call which
are copied in many other leading news
papers in remote parts of the country.
His contributions to prominent maga
zines invariably meet with success as
lie has written many short stories, nov
els, and poems which have had a wide
popular appeal.
Economic and social problems have
always been of prime interest to him,
as well as all questions connected with
literature. His talk tonight will fcm
body his idea that "speaking ought to
be the standard of writing and that
there has been a divorce between the
two with unfortunate results."
Mr. Barry stands as a living example
of what the happy union should be, as
he has proved himeslf both a lecturer
and a writer. He is always in demand
as a speaker because of Ins clear think
ing and enthusiastic manner of delivery.
The author was born in Boston,
where he received his primary educa
tion. He later attended Harvard Uni
versity to complete his work. The best
known of his novels are "Mile.
Blanche," "The Congressman's Wife,"
"Our Best Society" and"The Intri
guers."
