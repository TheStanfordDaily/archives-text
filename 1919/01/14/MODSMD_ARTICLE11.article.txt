# Y.M.C.A. FEED IS EVENT OF TOMORROW
## Both Women and Men Are Invited to the Affair at the Inn 
### 
A "get together feed" for both men
and women will be held tomorrow
(Wednesday) evening at the Inn at
6:15 sharp, the purpose of which is to
arouse enthusiasm for the Y. W. and
Y. M. C. A. "Christian World De
mocracy" campaign. The treat of the
hour will be an address by John R.
Voris, religious work dirctcor of the
western department of the Y. M. C. A.
War Work Council. Voris is one of
the strongest speakers of the west, and
will talk on the topic, "College Students
Making Democracy Safe for the
World."
The slogan of the Y. W. and Y. M.
C. A. people in their campus-wide
campaign for discussion groups on this
subject is "Make Democracy Safe for
the World." This is part of a move
ment covering all the colleges and uni
versities of the United States. It is in
response to the demand of the students
who are the leaders to be in the "New
Age," for a firmer grip on the essen
tial principles of a just social order,
that they may more intelligently do
their part toward its realization.
The cabinet and special campaign
committees of the Y. M. C. A. meet to
night at 7 o'clock at the Union to per
fect plans and to push measures al
ready under way. It is expected that
every man who has promised or who
will .promise to aid in the campaign
will be present, both at this meeting and
at the dinner tomorrow night.
