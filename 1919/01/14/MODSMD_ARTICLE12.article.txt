Everyone will be given a fair oppor
tunity and the selection of the cast will
be given a fair opportunity and the
selection of the cast will be made on
merit alone.
This Ram's Head show will be pro
duced on the evening of February 21,
just before the Washington's Birthday
vacation. Following the local staging
of the show, it will probably be pro
duced in San Francisco and other
points under professional coaching.
Ram's Head society has for years
produced extravaganzas. They have al
ways been one of the distinctive dra
matic events of the college year. Fe
male parts in these burlesques are al
ways taken by men. In this connection
it is interesting to note that several
good female impersonators are needed
for the present show.
The author of this year's extrava
ganza, Milton A. Hagen, '15, has al
ready assisted in the writing of two
earlier Ram's Head shows. These were
"Routing Razmataz" and "Wooing
Wolma." Hagen is a man of consider
able experience in the playwriting and
the humorous line, having been editor
of Chaparral during 1915 and author of
the 1915 junior opera, "The College
Prince." Since 1915 he has been en
gaged in writing for vaudeville. The
fact that Hagen has written the pres
ent piece almost insures its success.
Another feature of Ram's Head
shows has been the cleverness of its
musical numbers. 1. H. Larsen, '17,
A. 1). Wilkie, '18, L. J. MeDermott, '17,
and E. A. Salzburg, '19, are the mem
bers of Ram's Head who will write
the musical score.
The title of the show has not yet
been announced, but there are hints that
the show will be a revolutionary one.
The importance of trying out cannot
be urged too much, according to Ram's
Head society.
