# THE 						ASSEMBLIES
## 
### 
Among the opportunities for self-improvement offered by attendance at a
university such as Stanford, none is more important than that of listening to
men and women who can speak with authority on one topic or another, A
half-hour's speech by a person whose work carries weight in the field which
he has chosen is of infinitely more value than hours of discussion by people
who don't know what they are talking about. These opportunities are offered
in abundance by the policy of the University in bringing noted men to speak
here at assemblies and meetings, and representatives of the highest forms of
music and art for concerts and dramatic performances.
Another advantage of these university assemblies and meetings is that
they give otherwise impossible opportunities for men preparing for one pro
fession or another to broaden their scope of culture. A prospective engineer
isn't able to keep up with art, nor a budding lawyer with engineering, unless
such keeping up can be accomplished without great loss of time, and for a
man to lose himself completely in his field of specialization to the exclusion
of all other interests narrows his field of vision and lessens his value to the
world. And it is here that the great value of the university meeting is mani
fest. Consistent attendance at assemblies and lectures by the expenditure,
say, of one hour a week, will keep anyone in touch with the latest develop
ments and thought in almost all phases of human activity.
It would be of value to everyone if the Little Theater and Assembly Hall
were better attended than heretofore.
