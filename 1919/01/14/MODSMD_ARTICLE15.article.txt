# UNIVERSITY RANCH LANDS STILL UNDER MILITARY CONTROL
## 
### 
The University still has from six to
seven thousand acres of what is known
as ranch land under the army lease
for war purposes. These ranch lands
comprise all that acreage which lies
back of the Quad in the hills. Under
the present army lease this land will
be under the control of the Govern
ment for a period of five years, the
contract being made out for that
period of time. Indications, however,
point to the fact that the army author
ities are preparing to discontinue the
use of the land for military purposes.
The rifle ranges and many of the vari
ous pits and trenches are being filled
in. That the army intends to move
out, however, has had no otficial con
firmation to date. In case the land
should come under the control of the
university authorities in the near fu
ture it is planned to release the land
for a monetary consideration.
The university gardeners have been
busy the last week or so with planting
operations around the presidential
hill and Roble Hall. The beautifying
of these by planting flowers, trees, and
so forth is planned. On the Quad the
beautifying of the vacant land space
on the west side of Memorial Chapel
has been going on.
