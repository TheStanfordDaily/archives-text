# Roble "Get-together" Party is This Evening
## 
### 
The quarterly "get-together" party
will be given by Roble Club at the hall
this evening. The entertainment will
take the form of a fancy dress affair,
each girl coming to dinner in some
original costume. Dancing and a gen
eral good time will occupy the inter
val between dinner and study hours.
The purpose of the gathering is, pri
marily, to bring the new girls of the
hall into informal contact with the
older girls.
