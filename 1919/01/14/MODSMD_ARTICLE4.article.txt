## 
### 
"Snapp, silly snap-shots for the 1920
Quad" is to be the slogan of "Jesse"
Thrash and "Shorty" Crowe, two of the
editorial tryoutees for the 1921 Quad,
who arc in charge of obtaining pictures
for the senior section of the junior year
book, during the next few weeks.
"Rusty" Ritchie and "Al" Carey will
endeavor to snap as many undignified
snaps of dignified members of the class
of '19 as is possible. These two ambi
tious photographers, who arc endeavor
ing to secure the much hoped for pic
tures, are oiling their trusty "Eastman"
or "Brownie/' as the case may be, and
preparing for a long and tedious siege
of the shy seniors or senioresses.
When the campus camera fiends ap
pear in the offing it is hoped and ex
pected that the victim will not forget
his or her dignity, as the case may be,
and beat a hurried retreat for some
secluded spot in Encina, Roble or on
the Row and wait for the hopeful
hunters to pass.
