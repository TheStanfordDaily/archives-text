# TOMORROW SET ASIDE FOR WAR CAMPAIGN ACTIVITIES
## WAR BOARD ASKS AID Booths on Campus Will Take Pledges for Relief of Needy Armenians 
### 
Tomorrow has been designated as
Armenian Day on the campus, accord
ing to the action taken by the
Women's War Board at a meeting
held in the Women's Club House last
night. The War Board has been work
ing in conjunction with the faculty
committee appointed by the State
Council of National Defense, and final
plans and arrangements were formu
lated for the week's drive.
There will be ten stations for the
collection of pledges and cash dona
tions placed on Quad and at such
other prominent places as the commit
tee thought would reach all of the stu
dents on the campus. The ten mem
bers of the War Board will take
charge of the stations throughout the
entire morning, and the afternoon
work will be handled by the members
of the Junior War Board.
Letters have been sent out to all
organizations on the campus making
an appeal for the Armenian and Serian
relief. No personal canvassing will be
done in the other other war drives
upon the campus this year, but all or
ganlzalluii» will lit: uskeil as a whole
for their support. The faculty com
mittee composed of Miss Isabel Mc-
Cracken, Dr. 1). Gardner, Dr. G. Price
and Dean J. E. McDowell have ex-
pressed themselves as being confident
that the student body will give their
customary support to the drive, which
has always been known as being gen
erous.
President Wilson has made a per
sonal appeal to people of the
United States to support the Armenian
and Serian relief work in this present
drive, on account of the critical condi
tion of these people which has come
about through no fault of their own.
It is estimated that at least 4,000,000
people will need the outside support
of the United States to keep from
starvation. The larger part of these
people are women and children, and
it is thought by many that the exist
ence of the Armenian race in the fu
ture is dependent upon the support
which the allied nations will be able
to give this winter and spring. The
sum of $30,000,000 will be necessary
to carry on the immediate work of the
American Committee for Relief in the
Near East, and it is hoped that this
amount as a minimum will be sub
scribed by January 19. The one solu
tion to the problem which these people
present Is to put the stricken Armeni
ans and Serbs -upon a self-supporting
basis as soon as possible, and this can
be done only if the present drive
proves successful.

It is estimated that at least 4,000,000
people will need the outside support
of the United States to keep from
starvation. The larger part of these
people are women and children, and
it is thought by many that the exist
ence of the Armenian race in the fu
ture is dependent upon the support
which the allied nations will be able
to give this winter and spring. The
sum of $30,000,000 will be necessary
to carry on the immediate work of the
American Committee for Relief in the
Near East, and it is hoped that this
amount as a minimum will be sub
scribed by January 19. The one solu
tion to the problem which these people
present Is to put the stricken Armeni
ans and Serbs -upon a self-supporting
basis as soon as possible, and this can
be done only if the present drive
proves successful.
