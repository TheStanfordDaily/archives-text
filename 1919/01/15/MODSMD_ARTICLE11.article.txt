# Freshman-Sophomore Debate Attracts Many
## 
### 
Much interest is being taken in the
freshman-sophomore debate tryouts, ac- 1
cording to Coach M. L. McClintock, i
who states that more than ten men
from each class have signified intent to
{try for places on the teams. The try
outs occur in Room 100 at 2:30 Thurs
day and hriday afternoons for fresh
men and sophomores, respectively.
In staging the contest this year Coach
McClintock is reviving another of the l
Stanford traditions the* war has for two
years set aside for.this debate was to
old-timers almost as classic as the rush
.or poster fight, and was a stepping stone
to more than one forensic artist's fame.
