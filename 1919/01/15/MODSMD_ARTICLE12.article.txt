# FIRST GAME SCHEDULED FOR VARSITY QUINTET
## TEAM SHAPING UP WELL Oakland High School Five Promises to Furnish Good Competition 
### 
Cardinal fans will have the first chance
of the season to see their basketball
favorites in action, Friday night, when
the Varsity five will go onto the court
against the Oakland High School quin
tet. This game will give the first real
indication of the kind of a basket
shooting maclntie the Stanford squad
is capable of turning out.
Although the visitors arc only repre
senting a high school, that fact should
not be taken as an indication that the
game will be a walk-away for the
Varsity. The Oakland aggregation is
considered as one of the best high school
quintets that ever went into action around
the bay cities, and with the advantage of
several months of training they should
give the Cardinal five a hard battle.
Coach Evans is putting the Stanford
squad through a stiff workout, every
night, and is developing a fighting spirit
among the members that is bound to
show results when the men from the
"Farm" take their place oy the court.
The definite lineup for Friday has not
been announced, but Coach Evans will
probably send a good many of the candi
dates into the game in order to get a
line on the way they show up on the
floor.
"Swede" Rights is the strongest can
didate for center and will probably play
that position in Friday's lineup. Hood,
Pelouze and Moulton are reasonably
sure of a tryout at forward. Coughtv,
Lilly, and Williamson are leading the
fight for guards. The two latter are
showing up well as running guards.
Several other men may be given a
chance to show their ability in the
initial contest. Dinkelspiel, Bucklin,
Fairchilds and Johannsen are showing
good promise.
The game is called for 8 o'clock Fri
day night and all students registered in
the University will be admitted free
upon the presentation of their registra
tion cards.
