THE FRESHMAN RULE
Last fall, though theoretically In force, the one-year dormitory ruling
made no difference in university conditions, owing to the existence of the
S. A. T. C. Now that the Hall and Row are opening up again, it is just begin
ning to be felt. The important thing now is to see that it produces as little
friction as possible while the campus is getting accustomed to it.
Fraternities, being human, are naturally just a little bit resentful that the
rule should be putin force at this particular time, when they are having the
most difficult struggle of their existence to make both ends meet until the
old men return, but the great majority of them realize the advantages of the
rule, and are willing to abide by it in spirit and in letter. The suspension of
the transfer rule has removed the only grievance for the present at least.
What needs to be done now is to meet new conditions in a spirit of mutual
tolerance. Encina is apt to dislike the destruction of the distinctive character
of its organization by the presence at the Hall of the fraternity freshmen,
while the fraternities traditionally resent the assumption of authority over, and
the imposition of freshman discipline on their freshmen by any organization
but themselves.
Such problems will have to be worked out in the course of time, and the
only way they can be solved is by the hearty acceptance of the rule and co
operation with university authorities by all concerned. Any antagonism engen
dered will make things so much harder for the fraternities, for Encina, and
for the freshmen,
