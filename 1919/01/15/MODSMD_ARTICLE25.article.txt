First Practice of the Season
The baseball .game Saturday be
tween the first and second nines was
chiefly interesting because it was the
first of the season. The number of
strikeouts, twenty-five, clearly shower
the length of time since the men have
faced a pitcher. The miserable ground
also prevented good work.

High Livery Rates
For nearly three years the students
of the University have been the vic
tims of high livery rates to and from
the railroad stations. Through the in
flfience of competition the rate to May
field has come done to a fair figure,
but the same old price still obtains
on the Palo Alto lines. It is surpris
ing that some enterprising student
does not take the affair in hand and
settle the matter to his own as well
as to the advantage of the student
body, by running a five-cent line (D.
P. A., January 15, 1914.)
