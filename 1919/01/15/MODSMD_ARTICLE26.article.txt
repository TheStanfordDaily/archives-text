# F.F. RUNYON WRITES ASKING U.S. AID TO HELP THE ARMENIANS
## 
### 
Mr. F. F. Runyon, who has spent
considerable time doing relief work
among the people of Asia Minor,
writes the following impressive story
of the conditions as they have existed
over there:
"It was January 2, 1915, that the
Russians withdrew from where 1
lived. The next day 20,000 helpless
people fled into our yards. They knew
that Germany respects no neutrality.
I have no time to go into the tragedy
of that five months of housing, feeding
and keeping alive the 20,000 helpless
people. But the day after they came
someone knocked at my door excitedly
and said, 'Why don't you arise?'
"I said, 'What's up?'
"Then I went out on the roof and
took my field-glasses, and looking off
to the mountains I saw those great
troops moving down the mountains.
They were ready to swoop down and
devour them. German officers were
egging them on. The people were
frantic. Who could save them from
this great calamity? They were
throwing themselves down on their
faces, weeping, kissing our feet,
drenching them with their tears and
saying, 'For God's sake, save us.'
"We told them no human being
could save them, to appeal to God Al
mighty.
"1 have no reason to doubt the effi
cacy of prayer, and I shall never for
get that sight of those women and
children sobbing there.
"There was no time to lose. We
bade our wives and children good-bys.
Then we took the only emblem of au
thority, 'Old Glory.' Wherever the
missionary goes, Old Glory goes. We
put it on a flag-pole on the gate and
five of our men stood under that flag
and awaited the avalanche.
"The great point was, would they
recognize the flag, for had they passed
by in silence it would have been a sig
nal to kill every man, woman and
child in the yards.
"The man at the head looked up,
saw the flag, and he said 'Halt!'
"The great procession backed up.
"He said, looking up at the flag,
'What flag is that?'
"We said, 'That is the flag of the
United States.'
"He said, 'Who raised that flag?'
" 'We did.'
" 'What right had you to raise that
flag?'
" 'The right of American citizens.
We claim its protection. Under its
folds we have placed 20,000 helpless
people.'
"There was silence for a moment,
then the officer, looking again at us,
then again at the flag, said, 'If it were
not for that flag we would have killed
every one of you today'; and then he
said, 'Forward, march,' and they all
passed by, and before we knew what
was taking place those people were
hugging and kissing that flag, saying,
'Thank God. That flag has saved our
lives and its owners today.'
"The greatest task of all now rests
with the American people, for they
must raise large sums of money in
order to save from starvation the
stricken people of the Near East. The
Syrian and Armenian drive on the
Stanford campus this week will raise
contributions to send East for the
support of these impoverished nations,
and it is hoped that every University
student will do all in his power to
keep high the standard of the Ameri
can flag."

faces, weeping, kissing our feet,
drenching them with their tears and
saying, 'For God's sake, save us.'
"We told them no human being
could save them, to appeal to God Al
mighty.
"1 have no reason to doubt the effi
cacy of prayer, and I shall never for
get that sight of those women and
children sobbing there.
"There was no time to lose. We
bade our wives and children good-bys.
Then we took the only emblem of au
thority, 'Old Glory.' Wherever the
missionary goes, Old Glory goes. We
put it on a flag-pole on the gate and
five of our men stood under that flag
and awaited the avalanche.
"The great point was, would they
recognize the flag, for had they passed
by in silence it would have been a sig
nal to kill every man, woman and
child in the yards.
"The man at the head looked up,
saw the flag, and he said 'Halt!'
"The great procession backed up.
"He said, looking up at the flag,
'What flag is that?'
"We said, 'That is the flag of the
United States.'
"He said, 'Who raised that flag?'
" 'We did.'
" 'What right had you to raise that
flag?'
" 'The right of American citizens.
We claim its protection. Under its
folds we have placed 20,000 helpless
people.'
"There was silence for a moment,
then the officer, looking again at us,
then again at the flag, said, 'If it were
not for that flag we would have killed
every one of you today'; and then he
said, 'Forward, march,' and they all
passed by, and before we knew what
was taking place those people were
hugging and kissing that flag, saying,
'Thank God. That flag has saved our
lives and its owners today.'
"The greatest task of all now rests
with the American people, for they
must raise large sums of money in
order to save from starvation the
stricken people of the Near East. The
Syrian and Armenian drive on the
Stanford campus this week will raise
contributions to send East for the
support of these impoverished nations,
and it is hoped that every University
student will do all in his power to
keep high the standard of the Ameri
can flag."
Mr. F. F. Runyon, who has spent
considerable time doing relief work
among the people of Asia Minor,
writes the following impressive story
of the conditions as they have existed
over there:
"It was January 2, 1915, that the
Russians withdrew from where 1
lived. The next day 20,000 helpless
people fled into our yards. They knew
that Germany respects no neutrality.
I have no time to go into the tragedy
of that five months of housing, feeding
and keeping alive the 20,000 helpless
people. But the day after they came
someone knocked at my door excitedly
and said, 'Why don't you arise?'
"I said, 'What's up?'
"Then I went out on the roof and
took my field-glasses, and looking off
to the mountains I saw those great
troops moving down the mountains.
They were ready to swoop down and
devour them. German officers were
egging them on. The people were
frantic. Who could save them from
this great calamity? They were
throwing themselves down on their
faces, weeping, kissing our feet,
drenching them with their tears and
saying, 'For God's sake, save us.'
"We told them no human being
