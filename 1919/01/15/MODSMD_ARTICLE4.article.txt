# Ram's Head Tryouts Don't Faze K.C.B.
## 
### 
Last night it happened.
That I had nothing to do.
Being an English major.
And so I dropped in.
At the Assembly Hall.
About seven thirty.
And they were holding tryouts.
For the Ram's Head show.
And I sat down.
In the front row.
And bye and bye.
A lot more came in.
And sat down.
And tlien Pickering.
Got on the stage.
And made all the fellows.
Come up in threes
And line up.
And dance around.
And he made them sing.
And feel foolish.
And look foolish.
And outside the door
Were all the women.
Trying to get a look.
At the boys inside. •.
And after all the tryoutees.
Had sung "Smiles."
"PickV looked disgusted.
For out of the sixty.
That tried out.
About twenty.
Couldn't dance.
And could sing.
And twenty more.
Could sing.
Rut couldn't dance.
And all the rest.
Couldn't do either.
And 1 was one of those.
Who couldnit do either.
And so I went out.
And went away.
Feeling foolish.
And I guess looking foolish.
I thank you.
