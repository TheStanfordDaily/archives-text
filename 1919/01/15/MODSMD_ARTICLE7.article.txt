# J.D. BARRY OF "CALL" GIVES INTERESTING TALK HERE
## SIMPLE WRITING URGED Argues in Favor of Speech as Standard of All Printed Work 
### 
In an arraignment of writers who
adopt "print language" as a means of
concealing rather than expressing their
ideas, Mr. John D. Barry, editorial
writer of the San Francisco Call and
author of "Ways of the World," last
night at the Little Theatre pointed out
some of the dangers which young
authors have to face in appearing before
the public in print.
"Most people regard the art of print
ing with awe and an almost sacred rever
ence." he said. "This is a pity, for
print, like the spoken language of the
drama, is just another means of ex
pressing ideas which when once conr
ceived arc common property. But so
many people consider that printing is
intended for the few. It is thought to
be the language of aristocracy," he said.
Mr. Barry told his audience how in
his younger days he spent much of his
time at concerts and the theater, and
it was always a source of wonderment
to him why successful actors were
always the most natural, and why all
actors were not natural. But he learned
that it is not an easy matter to be a
natural actor, and he saw how this
principle applied to writing.
There is an abundance of material
written today which can never be really
understood because the writers mas
querade behind print language. Many
great men have been lost to the world
