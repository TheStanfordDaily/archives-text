## SIMPLE WRITING URGED Argues in Favor of Speech as Standard of All Printed Work 
### 
In an arraignment of writers who
adopt "print language" as a means of
concealing rather than expressing their
ideas, Mr. John D. Barry, editorial
writer of the San Francisco Call and
author of "Ways of the World," last
night at the Little Theatre pointed out
some of the dangers which young
authors have to face in appearing before
the public in print.
"Most people regard the art of print
ing with awe and an almost sacred rever
ence." he said. "This is a pity, for
print, like the spoken language of the
drama, is just another means of ex
pressing ideas which when once conr
ceived arc common property. But so
many people consider that printing is
intended for the few. It is thought to
be the language of aristocracy," he said.
Mr. Barry told his audience how in
his younger days he spent much of his
time at concerts and the theater, and
it was always a source of wonderment
to him why successful actors were
always the most natural, and why all
actors were not natural. But he learned
that it is not an easy matter to be a
natural actor, and he saw how this
principle applied to writing.
There is an abundance of material
written today which can never be really
understood because the writers mas
querade behind print language. Many
great men have been lost to the world
| behind a language that is far above
j the average reader. They write in an
I obscure style ideas which in themselves
, are simple. Ideas are not hard. It is
j the language of the ideas which is hard.
| "It is print language," said Mr. Barry.
Mr. Barry considers William Dean j
I Howells the radical novelist of his time |
I because lie wrote the everyday language
j of the life which he knew, although he
] was criticised by Lowell, the author of
the "Bigelow Papers," for vulgar col-i
j loquuialism.
"Watch conversation," said Mr. Barry,
"ft is better to write colloquial language
than 'print language'."
Although Mr. Barry emphasized the
■ importance of natural, simple diction.
; he pointed out some of the difficulties
i and dangers confronting writer? of the
new literature.
"It is not an easy matter to write
simply. One writer of my acquaintance
1 made a point of constructing short,
i choppy sentences in an affected sim
| plicity of style. But he did not succeed
i because he tried to get a natural effect
| by an unnatural means.
"Young writers are often misled by I
j 'print language'. They adopt it because :
they think it is the thing to do. They
imitate 'print language' in a search of an ;
! adequate mode of expression, but once
| a writer adopts it as a standard there is
j no hope for him.
"Get a point and march straight for j
'that point," he said, in remarking about j
j some of the common mistakes of author
i ship. Many writers stay so long in one
point that they become verbose. They!
don't move fast enough toward their!
objective. Arthur • Brisbane, the most j
widely read editorial writer in the oun- j
try, is great because he has a natural
gift of simplicity.
"There are many personal qualities
that I do not admire about Mr. Bris
bane." said Mr. Barry, "but 1 cannot j
criticise his writing. He can express
ideas so that millions of readers who
would otherwise be excluded may
receive the ft of knowledge."

actors were not natural. But he learned
that it is not an easy matter to be a
natural actor, and he saw how this
principle applied to writing.
There is an abundance of material
written today which can never be really
understood because the writers mas
querade behind print language. Many
great men have been lost to the world

j the average reader. They write in an
I obscure style ideas which in themselves
, are simple. Ideas are not hard. It is
j the language of the ideas which is hard.

Mr. Barry considers William Dean j
I Howells the radical novelist of his time |
I because lie wrote the everyday language

the "Bigelow Papers," for vulgar col-i
j loquuialism.
"Watch conversation," said Mr. Barry,
"ft is better to write colloquial language
than 'print language'."
Although Mr. Barry emphasized the
■ importance of natural, simple diction.
; he pointed out some of the difficulties
i and dangers confronting writer? of the
new literature.
"It is not an easy matter to write
simply. One writer of my acquaintance
1 made a point of constructing short,
i choppy sentences in an affected sim
| plicity of style. But he did not succeed
i because he tried to get a natural effect
| by an unnatural means.
"Young writers are often misled by I
j 'print language'. They adopt it because :
they think it is the thing to do. They
imitate 'print language' in a search of an ;
! adequate mode of expression, but once
| a writer adopts it as a standard there is
j no hope for him.
"Get a point and march straight for j
'that point," he said, in remarking about j
j some of the common mistakes of author
i ship. Many writers stay so long in one
point that they become verbose. They!
don't move fast enough toward their!
objective. Arthur • Brisbane, the most j
widely read editorial writer in the oun- j
try, is great because he has a natural
gift of simplicity.
"There are many personal qualities
that I do not admire about Mr. Bris
bane." said Mr. Barry, "but 1 cannot j
criticise his writing. He can express
ideas so that millions of readers who
would otherwise be excluded may
receive the ft of knowledge."
In an arraignment of writers who
adopt "print language" as a means of
concealing rather than expressing their
ideas, Mr. John D. Barry, editorial
writer of the San Francisco Call and
author of "Ways of the World," last
night at the Little Theatre pointed out
some of the dangers which young
authors have to face in appearing before
the public in print.
"Most people regard the art of print
ing with awe and an almost sacred rever
ence." he said. "This is a pity, for
print, like the spoken language of the
drama, is just another means of ex
pressing ideas which when once conr
ceived arc common property. But so
many people consider that printing is
intended for the few. It is thought to
be the language of aristocracy," he said.
Mr. Barry told his audience how in
his younger days he spent much of his
time at concerts and the theater, and
it was always a source of wonderment
to him why successful actors were
always the most natural, and why all
actors were not natural. But he learned
that it is not an easy matter to be a
natural actor, and he saw how this
principle applied to writing.
