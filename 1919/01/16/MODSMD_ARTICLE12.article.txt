# STANFORD QUINTET TO CLASH WITH TEAM FROM OAKLAND
## SEASON TO BE OPENED "Fighting Bob" Evans Will Give All Candidates an Opportunity 
### 
"Fighting Bob's" proteges will open
up their new basketball to sport fans
tomorrow night against Oakland High
School at 8 o'clock in Encina gym. Reg
istration certificates will admit under
graduates to the game free.
Coach Evans has been working hard
with his men for the last ten days teach
ing them the rudiments of basketball,
and in tonight's game he will open up
all his new stuff, when he uses prac
tically all the men who have made a
showing for the team.
The line-up for the game is in doubt.
Probably Moulton and Pelouze will start
at forward. Righter at center is fairly
sure, and Williamson at running guard
can be banked on. The other guard is
uncertain. Either Lilly or Caughey will
start. Evans has developed two sets of
fast forwards, and probably Esgen and
Hood will play this position during the
second half.
The coach believes in working his
forwards all the time, so in addition to
the two above sets, a third is being de
veloped with Bucklin as the nucleus.
At guard Johannsen and Swanholm are
putting up a hard fight against William
son, Caughey and Lilly.
The Oakland team, while not up to
usual college standards, will offer a
good game for the varsity. The bay
five is reputed to be the fastest high
school team developed around northern
California in years.
Coach Evans is putting a good deal
of attention to the freshmen at pres
ent. Since the varsity practices in the
afternoon, the first year men are taking
the floor every night at 7 o'clock. Some
fast men are out, and the coach prom
ises a good team.
