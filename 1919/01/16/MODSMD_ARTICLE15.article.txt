# A 						WORTH-WHILE WELCOME

### 
Present plans call for a celebration in honor of the Stanford men
returning from the Great War at the close of the school year. The idea
can hardly be too highly commended. Those men who have given one,
two, or three years of their life to the defense of their country, and who
have lost that amount of time out of the constructive years of their lives,
deserve any honor that their university can bestow on them. They have
added pages of glory to the fame of Stanford; they have brought the
name of their Alma Mater to the front among the universities of the
world; they have been willing to give their all that the principles which
Stanford exemplifies should not perish. What could be more fitting
than that those who stayed at home should do their utmost to honor
these heroes? The University officially will pay a tribute to these men
by the decision to present a certificate to all who left college to enter the
service. Proposals for a substantial memorial to the service stars in
Stanford's honor flag have not yet taken concrete form, but doubtless
will be forthcoming.
In the meantime, the student body and all organizations should he
devising plans to make this welcome home planned for next June as wor
thy of the occasion as possible. The English Club is preparing a pageant
illustrative and symbolical of Stanford history from the founding to the
present as a feature of the event. This will doubtless be an important
contribution to the celebration, and should furnish a cue to other organ
izations of such a nature that they are able to contribute something to
the success of the event. Student organizations of all kinds should co
operate with faculty officials to make this welcome to the men returning
to civil life and to their university one of the big events in Stanford his
tory.
