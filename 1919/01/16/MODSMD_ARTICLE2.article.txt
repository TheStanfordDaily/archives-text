# J.R. Voris Speaks at Y.M.C.A. Feed
## Discussion Group Plans to Be Put Into Operation Monday Evening 
### 
Mr. John R. Voris, religious work
director of the Western Department,
gave a very interesting talk to mem
bers of the Stanford Y. M. C. A. last
night at the big "Y" dinner. He
showed how the principles of world
democracy laid down by President
Wilson are but the application to in
ternational relations of the social eth
ice of Christianity, and brought out
the fact that every effort must bo
made to prevent the world from re
lapsing into materialism and selfish
nationalism. He closed with a strong
appeal to "Make democracy safe for
the world with the same spirit of serv
ice and sacrifice that the boys "over
there" have made the world safe for
democracy."
Other speakers were Keith Davis,
'20, who presided, and Miss Frances
Willis, *20.
Plans for the study of the principles
of future world democracy in discus
sion groups arc progressing rapidly, and
the Y. M. C. A. expects to have the
campaign actively in forcc by the early
part of next week. The project will he
discussed in detail Wednesday evening
and the various leaders appointed, so
that the different groups will he able to
hold a meeting as soon as possible.
It is the intention of the Y. M. C. A.
to get at least half of the men in the
University enrolled in these discussion
groups, which will, as far as possoblc,
be conducted by upperclassmen. It is
planned that there shall be a group in
each of the fraternities and sororities
as well as in Encina, so that the mem
bers can meet with the least expenditure
of time in getting to and from the
groups.
The Y. M. C. A. does not intend that
these groups shall be an opportunity
for anyone to lecture, nor are they to
discuss any fixed program. All dis
cussions are to be in an open and
spontaneous way that will interest every
man present. Moreover, the topics are
to be of immediate and challenging
interest in which all will participate.
The program, as now outlined, is that
the sessions shall last about an hour,
and that there shall be six session a
quarter.
The organization of the groups is to
be very simple. There is to be a leader
who will hold the discussion down to
the topics chosen, and a booster, or
publicity man, whose duty will be
principally to work up attendance and
attend to the secretarial end.
The first meeting of the groups will
be held on Monday, at 7:00 p.m. The
meeting places will be announced later.
