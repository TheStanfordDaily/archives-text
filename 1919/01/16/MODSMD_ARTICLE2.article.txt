# J.R. Voris Speaks at Y.M.C.A. Feed
## Discussion Group Plans to Be Put Into Operation Monday Evening 
### 
Mr. John R. Voris, religious work
director of the Western Department,
gave a very interesting talk to mem
bers of the Stanford Y. M. C. A. last
night at the big "Y" dinner. He
showed how the principles of world
democracy laid down by President
Wilson are but the application to in
ternational relations of the social eth
ice of Christianity, and brought out
the fact that every effort must bo
made to prevent the world from re
lapsing into materialism and selfish
nationalism. He closed with a strong
appeal to "Make democracy safe for
the world with the same spirit of serv
ice and sacrifice that the boys "over
there" have made the world safe for
democracy."
Other speakers were Keith Davis,
'20, who presided, and Miss Frances
Willis, *20.
Plans for the study of the principles
of future world democracy in discus
sion groups arc progressing rapidly, and
the Y. M. C. A. expects to have the
campaign actively in forcc by the early
part of next week. The project will he
discussed in detail Wednesday evening
and the various leaders appointed, so
that the different groups will he able to
hold a meeting as soon as possible.
It is the intention of the Y. M. C. A.
to get at least half of the men in the
University enrolled in these discussion
groups, which will, as far as possoblc,
be conducted by upperclassmen. It is
planned that there shall be a group in
each of the fraternities and sororities
as well as in Encina, so that the mem
bers can meet with the least expenditure
