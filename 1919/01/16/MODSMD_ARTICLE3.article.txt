# Stanford to Have Beautifying Done
## John McLaren, S.F. Park Superintendent, Will Have Charge 
### 
John McLaren, park superintendent
of San Francisco, has drawn up the
plans for the campus grounds, and
work is now going forward in carry
ing them out. Professors Abrams and
Campbell of the botany department
are assisting him. Mr. McLaren laid
out the exposition grounds and Golden
Gate park.
As now planned, the arboretum will
extend from one county road to the
other, the new arboretum extending
past the residential section, taking in
the president's mansion and the lake.
A twofold purpose is involved: the one
the beautification of the campus, giv
ing it light and color; the other to,
develop an arboretum for scientific
work, to study trees and shrubs. Each
year it is planned to add to it, both
by means of appropriations and by do
nations.
A live oak avenue similar to that in
front of Encina will separate the old
quad from the new quadrangle, of
which the library and the art gal
lery are units. The' road past the
Women's Club House to Roble will
eventually become one of the leading
avenues, and will probably be a haw
thorne avenue. Already a rule has
been passed by the Board of Trustees
authorizing the removal of the barns.
In the section around the president's
house only trees and shrubs which are
natives of California will be used.
Practically the only open places-that
will be left will be the athletic
grounds.
The grounds around Roble will be
planted to shrubs and trees, with
paths and benches placed throughout.
The overflow ditch from the lake will
be treated as an ornamental creek,
with willows and rustic bridges. Bos
ton ivy will be planted to cover Roble,
and the lawn that is to be in front of
it will be banked along the house by
shrubs. The center circle in the drive
way is to be removed and left as a
portion of the roadbed.
