# War Board Women to Visit Clinics
## Generous Contributions Made to Serbian, Armenian Relief Funds 
### 
As the first steps in formulating some
definite plan for the future work of the
Women's War Board, Miss Margaret
Shedd, '20, Miss Elizabeth Patton, 21,
Miss Caroline Rochfort, '19, and Miss
Harriet Bradford, Dead qf Women,
have been delegated to investigate the
work and conditions at a number of
the clinics in San Francisco next Satur
day. A report will be given to the
Women's War Board concerning the
feasibility of 'attempting to organize
the women of the University into a cer
tain very definite phase of philanthropic
work. In discussing the possibility of
going into this new field, Miss Shedd
said:
"The problem of the future of the
War Board is an extremely difficult one,
but all of the women interested in
directing this work have agreed that
whatever is undertaken must closely fol
low reconstructional lines. Our after
war efforts must just as materially con
tribute to the national cause as our
active war work did in Red Cross and
Food Conservation.
"In this regard Lane Clinic appears
to offer the most immediate opportunity
for active reconstruction. On account
of its close connection with the Uni
versity, every possible advantage would
be given our efforts in this direction.
There has been considerable comment
on the lack of interest on the part of
the students in the Lane Clinic, and if
possible the War Board would like to
eliminate and cause for this criticism
through their active interest in the
clinic."

committee in charge that the response
to the drive was as generour as could
