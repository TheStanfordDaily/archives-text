## Student Council Suggests Nominations Through Daily Palo Alto 
### 
If the four class organizations of the
University adopt the recommenda
tions which were recenUy made by
the Student Council, class elections
will hereafter be held but twice a
year instead of three times. This
measure has been suggested in order
that class elections may be more uni
form.
The Student Council considers that
if the student body elecUons and class
elections are held on the same day
twice a year, there will be a much
larger vote and that the expense will
be decreased. It suggests that nomi
nations be made through the Daily
Palo Alto columns. The council con
siders that this method of naming can
didates is much fairer than the usual
method which is pursued in class
meetings.

ular desire to vote on the above rec
ommendation, it will be considered ac
cepted. In that case no class elec
tions will take place until the middle
of February, when they will be held
simultaneously with the student body
election.
