# CARDINAL QUINTET TO CLASH WITH BAY HIGH SCHOOL
## RIGHTER TO BE CENTER Evans Plans to Use Many Men in Initial Game of Season 
### 
Stanford's basketball season will open
up at 8 o'clock tonight, when the red
shirted players will take the floor
against Oakland High School. As this
will be the first indication of the kind
of game the varsity can put up against
outside competition, an unusually large
crowd of fans is expected to be on
hand to look over their Cardinal favor
ites.
With the abundant amount of mate
rial out for basketball, Coach Evans is
developing several sets of players for
each position. At forward Esgen and
Hood are working together, and are
showing up exceptionally well. Moulton
and Pelouze-are also working in the
forward position and at present have
the edge on the other set. They will
probably start in the game tonight.
Righter is about the only strong can
didate for center, although Williamson
could fit into that position should a ne
cessity arise.
Williamson, Coughey, and Lilly are
the leading candidates for guards. They
are being bucked by Swanholm and
Johannsen. Bucklin is being made the
center for a third set of forwards.
No admission will be charged tonight
to undergraduate students. A registra
tion certificate will admit any student
to the game.
