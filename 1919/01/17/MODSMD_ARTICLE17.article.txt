# THE
						FIRST GAME
## 
### 
Now that it is a major sport, basketball should be placed on the same fooling
as other major sports as regards student interest in the game. The winning or
losing of a basketball series now means as much to the University as the winning
or losing of a baseball series, at least officially. And since this is so, attendance
at the games should justify the raising of basketball to major status.
The first chance to see a team representing the University in a major sport
since last spring will be afforded by the basketball game tonight. It is true it is
but a preliminary match with a secondary school, but it signalizes the revival of
Stanford athletics! Let's give the game a good send-off at the gym tonight.
Not to v violate the unbroken precedent of many years, the Daily Palo Alto
rises to remark on the undulating condition of the sidewalks up Lasuen, particu
larly noticeable when it rains. Perhaps some happy day, about the time 'lie
League of Nations gets to running right and Germany pays off its war debt,
they will be fixed.
