Cigarette Smoking By Dr. Jordan
As a college teacher my experience
j with boys who have formed the cig-
I arette habit is somewhat limited. It,
| however, confirms me in the opinion
that such boys are like wormy apples:
I they drop long before harvest time.
Very few of them ever advance far
enough to enter college. Very few of
those who enter last beyond the first
year. They rarely make fortunes in
after life, because they do not have any
after life. The boy who begins cig
arette smoking before he is fifteen
never enters the life of* the world. When
the other boys are taking hold of the
world's work he is concerned with the
sexton and the undertaker.
There is one grim argument to be
> made for the use of cigarettes by boys:
it helps on the survival of the fittest.
The manly boy does not take to such
things. He has life in him, plays foot
: hall, steals watermelons, goes swimming
on Sundays, hunts ducks—does any
thing but deaden himself with nar-
I coties.
