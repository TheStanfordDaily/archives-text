# Star Shell in No Man's Land Awakens K.C.B.
## 
### 
The other night.
I went to bed early.
To get some sleep.
At Encina.
Having no classes.
The next day.
Until ten o'clock.
And after a while.
I fell asleep.
And had a dream.
About the war.
And I saw myself.
Over there.
In the trenches.
And the shots were flying.
Both ways.
And I felt scared.
And after awhile.
The captain came along.
And asked for volunteers.
To go over the top.
And cut the barbed wire.
And I felt brave.
And volunteered.
And went over the top.
And the star shells burst.
And I fell flat.
Until they burnt out.
And I crawled on.
And all of a sudden.
I heard a noise.
And I woke up.
And looked out of the window
And some blame frosh.
Was firing electric light bulbs.
From the fifth floor.
And I was sore.
At the frosh.
Who threw those lights.
Out of the window.
And woke me up.
And spoiled my chances.
To be a hero.
I thank you.
