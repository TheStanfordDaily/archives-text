# ROBLE CLUB TO GIVE TWO DANCES
## 
### 
On account of the congestion at last
quarter's dance, Roble Club has decided
to divide the attendance this quarter
by giving two dances. These will take
somewhat of the nature of class dances.
The first, which will take place on Feb
ruary 15, will be attended by girls of
the senior, junior and sophomore classes,
with only enough freshmen to com
plete the number limit set, which will
probably be seventy-five or one bun
dred. The second, on March 1, will
be attended only by freshman girls. Tn
case that the number of girls desiring
to attend is not sufficient to merit
division, there will be but one dancc
given, on February 15.
