# MISS LUCY GATES AND TRIO DE LUTECE SCORE SUCCESS
## BIG AUDIENCE ENTHUSED Musical Artists Present Program Showing Great Talent 
### 
In every respect the concert given last
night in the Assembly Hall by Miss
Lucy Gates and the Trio de Lutece, un
der the auspices of the Peninsula Mu
sical Association, was an outstanding
event in musical attainment. The re
cital was one of unusual beauty and
quality, and engendered by the presence
of such noteworthy artists as Miss Lucy
Gates, George Rarrere, Carlos Salgedo
and Paul Kefer, will long remain in the
minds of those who heard it.
The program opened with the bril
liant "Deuxieme Concert" of Jean
Philippe Ranseau. It was played by the
Trio de Lutece with fluent technique
and vigor.
A variety of tone-color was revealed
by Miss Lucy Gates in her first num
ber, "Hymn to the Sun," by Rimsky-
Korsakow. Here she showed the poetic
imagination and the keen emotion that
have made her singing so impressive.
Miss Gates displayed the wonderful
spontaneous and emotional qualities of
her voice in the fourth number, a group
of five songs, "Les Trois Chansons,''
by Gabriel Pierne. This was so admir
able that the audience repeatedly re
called her and finally secured a repe
titon of the song.
"Dolly," by Gabriel Faure, as the last
number, was given by the Trio de
Lutece with brilliance and a fine inter
pretative sense which reached a climax
in the last composition of the suite, "Le
pas Espagnol."
