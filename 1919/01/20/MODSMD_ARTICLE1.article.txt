# VARSITY QUINTET WINS FIRST GAME FROM SANTA CLARA
## FINAL SCORE IS 45 TO 7 Righter Stars at Centerâ€” Moulton and Lilly Put Up Fight 
### 
Stanofrd opened the 1919 basketball
season with a 45 to 7 victory over a team
picked from Santa Clara University.
While the opposition furnished the
Varsity was strong, there was enough
ability on the part of the Santa Clara
men displayed to show the Varsity will
have a powerful combination this year.
The one outstanding feature of the
game was the teamwork put up by the
Cardinal at times. Coach Evans will,
if these signs do not fail, develop a team
that will not be built around a star, but
will be strong all the way through. On
the defense the Varsity helped their
opponents to two field goals, one each
half. And Coach Evans used every man
on his squad. On offense, the team
after a time worked the ball under the
basket, but could not ring up a bigger
score because the forwards have not
found their eye so early in the season.
Righter at center, Moulton at forward
and Lilly at guard put up perhaps the
best game, although it is hard to pick
a sta'r from Coach Evans' style of play.
Righter with his height and weight is
a tower of strength both on offense and
at defense.
The score at the end of the first half
was 16 to 3, but during the second period
the Cardinal hung up 29 points to Santa
Clara's 4.
