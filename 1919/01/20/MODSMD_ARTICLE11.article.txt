# VARSITY TRACK MEET IS SET FOR THIRD OF MAY
## OUTLOOK IS OPTOMISTIC Many Former Track Veterans Have Been Released From Army 
### 
May 3 has been set as the date for
the Varsity track meet with the Uni
versity of California. The freshman
meet between the Cardinal and B'ue and
Gold will be held April 19, two weeks
before the big fracas.
Coach F.vans and Track Captain Tiets
worth will start their men working in
about two weeks, and expect to hare a
fast team lined up by May. Rc'eases
from the army have turned back to the
University some of the best men that
ever represented Stanford in track, so
their optimism is well justified.
In the 100-yard dash, Lilly, Wells and
Dinkelspiel will be good for from fi to 9
points. Both Lilly and Wells are food
for around ten flat. The 220 will be
anyone's race, although Wells and
Dinkelspiel will give any California man
a hard battle.
Rogers will add at least six points in
the hurdles. The big sprinter, last year,
was star in the freshman meet and
should be able to duplicate this season.
The quarter will be taken care of by
Maynard Miller, a transfer from Ohio
State, and possibly Hertel and Wright,
the latter captain of the 1921 team.
Geoppart is back at California, and this
event will undoubtedly be the best of
the meet. Stanford can count on at least
four points, perhaps six.
The half-mile with Teitsworth and
Hertel looks strong, although California
in Sprott lias a runner hard to beat.
In the mile and two mile the Cardinal
is strong, as usual. Westwick and Teits
worth at first glance will take first and
second place in the mile, while Wets
wick and Sharp in the two-mile should
add at least six more.
In the broad jump Rogers can go 22
feet, and will take at least second place.
The high jump is weak. Sheldon is the
only man who shows up before the
season starts.
The pole vault can be counted on with
such a combination as Hutchinson,
veteran of past meets; Green, star of
the freshman team last year; and Bul
wer, a new man.
In the shot the old, reliable Caughey
will be out again. This means at least
first in the shot and second in the
hammer. Coonse will be on deck to back
Caughey up.
The relay, many times the deciding
race of big meets, looks to be hopeful
with Maynard. Teitsworth, Wright,
Hertel and Miller competing fof places.
Early season dope is often upset, but
on the face of matters Stanford should
duplicate her victories in track.
