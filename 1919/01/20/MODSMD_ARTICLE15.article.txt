# USELESS ORGANIZATIONS
## 
### 
In the reconstruction' of the organized phase of student life at Stanford an i
excellent opportunity is afforded to give many student organizations a thorough j
overhauling. Previous to the war there existed on the campus nearly a hundred j
student organizations of all varieties, ranging in size and importance from the!
Associated Students to the smallest departmental society. During the war a large i
number of these have been inactive. As things return to normal the natural i
tendency will be to revive these organizations as nearly as possible along the
old lines.
But to bring student life to a higher state of efficiency than it was before the |
war a little thought should be given to this revival: elimination, combination re-,
organization should be resorted to.
Many, probably a majority, of the numerous organizations which have sprung j
up in the fertile field of Stanford student activities have a delinite purpose and a I
definite reason for existence. With them this editorial has no concrn. But there: j
are other organizations which are scarccly heard of outside of their own mem
bership, and which seem to have been organized merely for the purpose of being
organized and giving a few individuals a chance to be elected to an office, how- |
ever insignificant. Their influence has been of no consequence, internally or ex-1
ternally, and their continued existence would seem to be so much wasted energy.
There is plenty of room for all kinds of student organizations at this Uni
versity, provided they have some purpose to serve. But one good live society of
tliis kind is worth ten insignificant or fossilized ones. And let's remember that!
â€¢when it comes time to reorganize the crokinole society and the pi I tie club.
