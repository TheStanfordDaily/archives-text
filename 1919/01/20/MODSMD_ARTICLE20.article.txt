The National Collegiate Athletic
Association has adopted a resolution
recommending that colleges do away
with paid coacbes. This action, how
ever, will not mean that colleges will
not be allowed to have any paid coaches;
it simply means that colleges will not
be allowed to have a special paid coach
for each branch of sports. This action
is strictly in accordance with Stanford's
policy of the last few years of having
one paid coach on the campus for several
different sports
