Pershing, who has been in communica
tion with the commanders-in-chief of
the twenty-one nations with whom the
United States has been allied during the
war.
The meet will be putin charge of a
committee to be appointed by General
Pershing, and this body will be the
supreme authority in all matters pertain
ing to the games. The meet will be
financed entirely by the United States
Army in co-operation with the welfare

competing nation is that of training,
transporting, equipping (and rationing
