No longer do Gamma Phis close their
eyes in peaceful slumber with the ring
ing of the 10:30 chimes. These are
nights of perilous watching for the oc
cupants of their house. Visions of pig
tailed yellow men," knife drawn, and
hands dipped in the blood of fresh vic
tims, haunt their waking hours and lurk
in every shadow. Windows and doors
are closed tight and bolted every night
at dusk, while the women retire to their
rooms and wait with bated breath for
the onslaught of a mob of crazed Ori
entals.
S. O. S. calls for help were sent to a
carpenter who was engaged to fortify
the house against attack, as the building
of a heavy barracade at all basement
openings, the attempt to murder their
cook to take place as a result of the
tong war which is now raging in near
by localities, and are taking precautions
against it.
