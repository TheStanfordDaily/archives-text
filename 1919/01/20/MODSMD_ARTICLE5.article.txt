# PROF. J.S. TATLOCK SPEAKS TOMORROW
## 
### 
Professor J. S. Tatlock will lecture
tomorrow evening at the Little Theater,
using as his subject "Attacks on Lincoln
and Other Presidents". The lecture
presents the results of extensive re
search work among such materials as
Civil War newspapers and records of
debates in Congress. According to
Professor L. E. Basset, who is familiar
with the lecture, it shows the astonishing
amount of suspicion, distrust and accu
sation which Lincoln had to endure,
including not only attacks on his choice
of men and his firmness, hut also on his
character. Professor Tatlock hopes,
with the help of the amazing facts of
this period and their comparison to
modern history, to throw a new light
on the present-day situation.
