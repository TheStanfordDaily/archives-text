# Bribes Win Slow Game From Pally
## 
### 
In a slow contest staged at the Encina
gymnasium Saturday afternoon, the
freshman five defeated the Palo Alto
High School 27-11. In spite of the fact
that the freshmen were not playing
their hardest, the game was one-sided
and Coach Evans declared that he was
satisfied with the material on hand, and
that with it he expected to turn out a
team capable of defeating the U. C.
yearlings.
The line-up follows:
Stanford—Sliriver, Holsten, Davies,
Mead, Neer, Greenway, forwards; Ger
son. Wright, center; Austin, Reeder,
Stern, Mangin, Larsen, guards.
Palo Alto — Franklin, Aydelotte,
Hughes, forwards; Waterman, CardufT.
center; Hardeman, Hayes, Crocker,
cuards.
