# DR. ANGELL OUTLINES ELIGIBILITY RULES FOR ATHLETICS
## REGULATIONS FOR HOURS ARE GIVEN Stanford Governed by Rules of Pacific Coast Conference 
### 
In a letter to the Daily Palo Alto Dr.
Frank Angell, chairman of the faculty
athletic committee, has outlined the
rules for eligibility to Stanford teams.
Stanford, says Professor Angell, is a
member of the Pacific Coast Conference
and is therefore bound by its rules in
the sports that the conference governs.
The letter follows:
Editor of Daily Palo Alto:
"1 am always glad to make the ac
quaintance of the young men who tramp
down to my end of the Quad to find out
where they stand on rules of eligibility
for Stanford teams. But it may save
their time to give here a little resume
of some of the more important rules af
fecting eligibility.
Stanford is a member of the Pacific
Coast Conference and the conference
governs the sports of baseball, football
(intercollegiate), track, basketball,
wrestling, and rowing. The rules do not
apply to soccer, Rugby football, swim
ming, boxing, and tennis.
A student to compete on varsity teams
under conference rules must be taking
at least twelve hours of work, have pre
sented fifteen Carnegie units for en
trance and satisfactorily completed at
least twenty hours of academic work.
He must have passed in 11/16 of his
hours of work in the term previous to
that in which he seeks to participate. A
sophomore having eight hours of total
failures, a junior twelve hours and a
senior sixteen hours are thereby ineli
gible.
Student assistants are ineligible,
whether academic or of the gymnasium.
The latter are also ineligible under the
amateur clause, but students doing cler
ical work for the University, and paid by
the hour are not affected. Students from
junior colleges (not giving a degree)
are eligible to varsity, but not to fresh
man teams. Students from other uni
versities must be in residence a year if
they have played on a varsity team. No
one can compete on varsity teams unless
he has been in residence a year. (Fresh
man fule.) No football training is al
lowed before September 15 of the year
in which the intercollegiate matches are
to take place.
Universities are of course free to
make local rules adding further limita
tions.
For the non-conference sports the
amateur and local rules only are appli
cable.
