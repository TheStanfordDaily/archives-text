### 
''Attacks on Lincoln and Other Presi
dents" is the subject on which Professor
J. S. P. Tatlock will lecture at 7:15 in
the Little Theater, tonight. The
material for this address has been gath
ered by him from the original records,
such as Civil War newspapers and con
gressional debates, and represents some
of his best research work.

time that Lincoln was president with
those of today, lie hopes to make the
present situation a little more easily ap
preciated. He will attempt to show a
parallel between the difficulties that
confronted Lincoln in the way of popu
lar distrust, suspicion, and accusation,
and those with which Wilson is contend
ing. Tie will show the amazing number
of attacks which Lincoln had to endure,
in regard to his character, choice of men,
and his firmness.
