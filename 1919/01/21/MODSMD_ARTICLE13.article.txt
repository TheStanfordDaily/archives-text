# MANAGER W.I. AMES ANNOUNCES SPORT SCHEDULE
## WILL PLAY U.C. THREE GAME SERIES St. Mary's, St. Ignatius, and California-Nevada League Will Be Included 
### 
Arrangements for athletic events dur
ing the spring season have been com
pleted by W. I. Ames, student man
ager. Tlie details and preliminary games
in a few instances are still to be worked
out, but on the whole the schedule is
pretty well settled.
The California-Nevada intercollegi
ate basketball league has been revived
and will play its usual schedule of
games during February. In this con
nection the varsity basketball team will
take a trip to Reno during the latter
part of February.
A three-game series has been ar
ranged with California in basketball.
The first contest will take place at
Berkeley 011 February 15; the second
here on March 1; and if a third game
is necessary, it will be held at Stanford
on March 5. League basketball begins
on February 1, when the Cardinal five
will travel to Davis to play the State
Farm quintet.
As yet February 25 is an open date,
but Student Manager Ames promises
that some kind of a preliminary contest
will be arranged to furnish the varsity
some competition.
011 account of the crowded season
this spring only a three-game series is
being arranged with California in base
ball. The dates are somewhat later in
the season than usual and will insure
better training conditions and faster
games. The second game of the series
is to be held at California 011 the morn
ing of the varsity track meet, May 3.
