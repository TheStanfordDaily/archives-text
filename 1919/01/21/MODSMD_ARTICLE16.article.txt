The suggestion made by the Student Council to the four classes that they
hold their class elections twice a year at the same time as the Associated Stu
dents election will, if adopted, be one of the best steps taken in student-body
affairs for many years. The chief difficulty in past student elections has not
been graft or log-rolling or unfit candidates, but merely lack of interest on
the part of the qualified voters. And colleges are no exception to the uni
versal truth that lack of interest produces poor government, which in turn
induces disgust and even less popular interest in political affairs. That these
conditions go hand in hand was strikingly illustrated last year, when student
government, oppressed by war conditions, sank to the lowest level, probably,
in Stanford history. In that year of election scandals, back-stairs intrigues,
and official unfitness, an election was held which resulted in the adoption of
the present student constitution. At this election, out of a student body of
over a thousand, some forty-nine took the trouble to cast ballost to determine
their future form of government!
Conditions here are now decidedly better than they were at that time;
the war is over and students are free to devote more time and interest to
university affairs; there is no reason why student government should not rise
to a plane befitting to a great university whose graduates are presumably to
play an active part in the government of the world. To put the organization
of and election for student government on an efficient basis should be the
immediate task. And the apathy of the voters, the chief obstacle to this task,
can be more easily overcome by combining elections and making them of
more importance to everyone than by any other method. When student elec
tions for different offices occur at different times, the University, like the
general public under similar circumstances, is apt to forget about them.
When they are held at once the elections become an event in the selection
of candidates, and more intelligent interest in the final event.
Class elections are important; to combine them with the Associated Stu
dents elections and make the whole an event in which all will be interested
and take a part will be a step the benefits of which will be great and cannot
be doubted.
