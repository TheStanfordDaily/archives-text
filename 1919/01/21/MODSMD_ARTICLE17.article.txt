# MORE VANDALISM
## 
### 
Vandalism on the University grounds is just as bad as anywhere else, I
though it may not cause quite so much comment. And when the object of
the vandalism is not mere buildings of brick or stone, but rare trees and
plants which cannot be replaced, there is no reason why campus opinion
should be any more lenient on the offenders than when the good name ot' the
University is harmed by deeds committed outside its bounds.
The students, if students they were, who destroyed some live hundred
dollars' worth of rare plants and shrubs in the arboretum a few days ago
while laboring under the delusion that they were engaged in "college life"
should realize that student sentiment does not regard such acts in such a
light.
