Editor of the Daily Palo Alto,
Stanford University, California.
My Dear Mr. Editor: In the course
of personal readjustment to Stanford
life that all of us who have been away,
even for as short a time as the writer
of these lines, must undergo, there are
many things in the new Stanford that
we must accustom ourselves to.
Among these things are ideas and
methods that did not exist before and
exist now, and institutions that used
to exist, and exist now no longer.
Conspicuous in the latter class of
things peculiarly Stanford that are no
longer features of our student life, is
Student Control. The fatal words

have slipped and I have admitted thai
I am tramping where angels (01
should I say students?) fear to tread
Student Control â€”I am afraid the
mere mention of the phrase has senl
the sage heads to their higli-brow vol
umes and leave me but the common
place student as a reader.
Rut I am forgetting that I am ad
dressing this communication to you
Mr. Editor, in the hopes that you in
turn may bring it before Mr. Com
mon-place Student. 1 am writing
merely in the spirit of suggestion
suggestion for the future, which, in
this case, involves gentle criticism ol
the past and vague reference to the
present.
Admittedly student control in its
unwise form was a failure at Stanford
University. I was somewhere in the
neighborhood when it left for regions
unknown. But to assume that because

student control failed at Stanford
when it was tried in an imperfect
form, it will necessarily fail under all
conditions, is a faulty and narrow hy
pothesis.
Stanford has not stood still while
; the rest of the world has grown in its
j ideas of government and of individual
j responsibility. Stanford men and
women have not been mere spectators
in the recent world struggle. Many
of them, most of them in fact, were
part and parcel of it in some way or
other. As active participants or as
helping assistants they have imbibed
something of responsibility, something
of the new meaning of "men and
women.'.' To return to Stanford and
j be told that they may not control and
{discipline themselves is almost a di
i reet insult to their present selves, or
a denial of their past work. The man
j who takes or who gives an order in J
It he army or in the navy certainly
should know how to cast a ballot or!
j abide by a decision of his representa
! tives in student life.
I
i The most active argument used to j
! curb any agitation to reestablish Stu-j
dent Control at Stanford University i
has been a so-called lack of interest j
in Student Control on the part of the
; students. The powers-that-be have al
: ways neglected to note that the mere !
I undercurrent of agitation for student J
j control is surely a sign of awakening
| student interest.
But if, as is claimed, student inter-
Jest. is still not sufficiently aroused, is
there any objection to creating an In
telligent interest? And it is this that!
! is the entire gist of my letter.
Mr. Editor, where citizens have j
failed to respond in a community'
ito the affairs of that community, I
leagues have been formed for the cre
ation of interest. Such a league might
not be out of place'at Stanford Uni
versity, where there is a small com- j
raunity in existence. I believe some
such idea has been growing in the
minds of certain student leaders at
Stanford, and so I am only taking this
opportunity of suggesting it to you,
Mr. Editor, for you to foster its
