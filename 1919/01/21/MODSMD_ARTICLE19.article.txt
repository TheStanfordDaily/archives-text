Street Car Line
The electrical engineering depart
ment has a project on foot which will
materially affect the relation of the
University to Palo Alto, being noth
ing less than a proposition to build
an electrical railroad to that place. j
Numerous plans have been suggested.
Now it is proposed that the University
build and operate the road.
Professor Perrine has given out
specifications for his class to work up
in groups of two. The plan is to as
sign different electrical systems in lieu
of theses, when the one best adapted j
|to the situation can be chosen and;
' the details worked up in the same:
1
i manner by the class.

A Safety Wheel
A. C. Pillsbury, '96, of the mechani
ical engineering department, is at work
!on a new safety for ladies, of which
the chief feature will be a light and
very strong leverage joint in the frame
at the crank shaft. The wheel, when;
| completed, will weigh a little over
twenty-five pounds—a very light wheel
for a ladies' style safety, and will be
, made entirely by him. He intends to
have his invention patented.

Communication
; Editor of the Daily Palo Alto.
Dear Sir: In a recent issue of the
! Daily I have noticed discussions on
the running track and on ways and
means of raising the necessary money
,to complete it.1 would like to pro
pose the following method: We have
here in the neighborhood of one hun
dred to one hundred and fifty wheel
men and no suitable track on which
to develop the speedy one. Now, by
: combining the track into a running
and cycling track an opportunity
would be afforded the wheelmen, who
would, I believe, willingly contribute
their share financially.
