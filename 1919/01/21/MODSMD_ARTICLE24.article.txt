# PROFESSOR ROBINSON ENDORSES EDUCATION
## 
### 
"Times of 'crisis of war puts a pre
mium on true leadership, and to have
leadership to save democracy we must
have leadership education, education
definitely in public affairs,' said Pro
fessor E. E. Robinson in his talk on
"American Leadership" last night at the
Cosmopolitan Club. There must be an
enlarging of the interest of the mass of
people in the facts, not opinions, of our
public business."
In reviewing the Presidents since the
Civil War, whose military record was
not a determining factor, Professor
Robinson dwelt on but two, Roosevelt
and Wilson.
"Roosevelt was informed; he knew
public affairs, not as a politician, but as
a statesman; his general information
even characterized his private conversa
tion. Wilson," he said, "is like Roose
velt, only greater."
Professor Robinson then quoted the
four essentials that Harvey ascribed to
Wilson: (1) a grasp of fundamental
principles, (2) the ability to fit these
principles to changing conditions, (3)
cogency of thought, and (4) breadth of
understanding. These characteristics
distinguished our true leaders from
those having the three general qualifi
cations: Personal initiative, personal
ambition, and a quality of will-power
that keeps them going.
"Our leaders, especially those in Cali
fornia, are men of initiative, men rarely
without personal gain, and characterized
by a strong will power. This leadership,
however, has failed because of their
narrowness of vision, a class-conscious
ness and prejudice."
Professor Robinson also laid empha
sis on the urgent necessity of students
to acquire a knowledge of other peoples,
other governments, a need to know the
world as it exists. If these qualities are
cultivated they will become leaders, not
primarily because of initiatives, personal
ambition and will power, but because
they are prepared to lead.
