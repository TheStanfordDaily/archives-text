# WOMEN'S WAR BOARD TO FORMULATE PLANS
## Report Will Be Heard From Committee Concerning Clinic Prospects 
### 
Possibly the most important meet
ing of the Women's War Board dur
ing the year will be held this evening
at 7:30 in the Women's Club House.
The important feature of the even
ing's work will be a report from the
committee who investigated the op
portunities in San Francisco for the
women of the University to give im
portant aid in clinic work. Miss Har
riet Bradford, Dean of Women, Miss
Caroline Rochfort, '19, and Miss Mar
garet Shedd, '20, chairman, gave over
the entire day last Saturday to visit
ing the clinics which were considered
as possible in the line of work which
the Women's War Board wished to
pursue. Considerable valuable in
formation was gotten and plans were
discussed at length with the authori
ties who would consider cooperating
with the University women.
The War Board will decide as to
whether or not it will consider the
plans which the committee has to
offer, and if the plans are approved
they will then be presented to the
Lane Clinic Board on the campus for
their sanction. Passing these two
bodies successfully, the plans will
then be regarded as satisfactory
enough to be presented to the Asso
ciated Women Students and the W T ar
Board will make the request that a
mass meeting of the women students
of the University be called for the
purpose of discussing at large the fu
ture of the philanthropic work of the
board on reconstructional lines.
