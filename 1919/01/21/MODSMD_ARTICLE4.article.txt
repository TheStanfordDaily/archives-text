Positions on the famous "Joffre" de
bating squad will be strenuously con
tested for this year, according to
Coach M. L. McClintock, who states
that names of several more able fo
rensic artists have been added to the

intercollegiate debates other than the
Joffre, and is a member of Delta Sigma
Rho. C. O. Fenalson, '19, and J. D.
Wise, '19, are new men to formal de
bating at Stanford, but have consider
able reputation as speakers.
These names, together with those
of Miss Margaret Shedd, '20, W. F.
Leiser, '21, S. Yamate, '20, H. A. Davis,
'20, and H. A. Fendler, '22, promise
that this year's tryout will be one of
the best patronized in the history of
the Carnot or Joffre medals.

France," and the specific question will
