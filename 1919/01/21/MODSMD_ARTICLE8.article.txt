# 1919 Boxing Squad Looks Like Winner
## Chances Appear Good for the Coming Tournament With California 
### 
Nineteen nineteen bids fair to be a big
year for the boxing squad which is speed
ily rounding into shape. Joe Murphy, a
Stanford boxer of considerable note, Eric
Pedlcy, who made the team two years
ago, "Babe" Henry and Mark Evans,
both point winners, will no doubt put the
home team in a position to battle with
any of the Cardinal's old opponents.
Beside this old material on hand, there
are considerable more men coming out
for consistent training in the ring on
Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays; no
doubt this material will furnish added
strength to the team.
An official schedule of meets has not
been announced as yet. However, it is
known that there will be two meets with
the S. F. Olympic Club in a few weeks.
One will be staged on home territory
and one in the city. The California
tournament will probably come off in
the early part of the spring quarter.
