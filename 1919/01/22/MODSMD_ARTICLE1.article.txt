# CRITICISMS OF LINCOLN RECALLED BY J.P. TATLOCK
## COMPARISON IS DRAWN TO WILSON Speaker Presents Surprising Material Obtained in Research Work

"Criticism is inevitable, for criticism
is the fuel under the boilers of a Demo
cratic Government, and the present
administration under Woodrow Wilson,
is suffering, has and will suffer
from hostile attacks of criticism," said
Professor J. P. Tatlock in his lecture

months the attacks on the administration
were very heavy. "There were times
when one wished Woodrow Wilson a

After a clear cut picture of present
conditions, the speaker turned to Lin
coln's administration, to which he devot

made of Civil War newspapers and
