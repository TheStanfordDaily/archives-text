# CRITICISMS OF LINCOLN RECALLED BY J.P. TATLOCK
## COMPARISON IS DRAWN TO WILSON Speaker Presents Surprising Material Obtained in Research Work 
### 
"Criticism is inevitable, for criticism
is the fuel under the boilers of a Demo
cratic Government, and the present
administration under Woodrow Wilson,
is suffering, has and will suffer
from hostile attacks of criticism," said
Professor J. P. Tatlock in his lecture
last night at the Little Greek Theatre.
The lecturer drew a vivid comparison
between the present hostile accusations
of the President and the almost forgotten
attacks made on Lincoln during the
Civil War.
Explaining that the extensive re
search work on which the lecture was
based had been gathered while in Wash
ington tins last year, the speaker gave
his hearers an inside view of public life
there. He said that underneath its ap
parently placid surface, YY ashington was
in a turmoil last summer and many even
feared that the war would be ended lie
fore we were effectively in it. bor some
months the attacks on the administration
were very heavy. "There were times
when one wished Woodrow Wilson a
Republican because of the attacks suff
ered," continued the speaker. "These
attacks started up again a month ago
and we may be sure they will come again
in 1920."
After a clear cut picture of present
conditions, the speaker turned to Lin
coln's administration, to which he devot
ed the remainder of his talk. "The
biographies of Lincoln say but little of
attacks on him," said Professor Tatlock,
"but it is surprising what an amount of
distrust and suspicion it is found Lin
coln had. to on dure, when a research is
made of Civil War newspapers and
records of Congressional debate. 1 have

| tinned, "because a great man is attacked,
|ue may not be sure every man who is
attacked is great."

plained, "we see the Civil War as ever
! progressing forward toward a goal. We
j do not see the vicissitudes through which
it passed. We are apt to forget the wide

"Criticism is inevitable, for criticism
is the fuel under the boilers of a Demo
cratic Government, and the present
administration under Woodrow Wilson,
is suffering, has and will suffer
from hostile attacks of criticism," said
Professor J. P. Tatlock in his lecture
last night at the Little Greek Theatre.
The lecturer drew a vivid comparison
between the present hostile accusations
of the President and the almost forgotten
attacks made on Lincoln during the
Civil War.
Explaining that the extensive re
search work on which the lecture was
based had been gathered while in Wash
ington tins last year, the speaker gave
his hearers an inside view of public life
there. He said that underneath its ap
parently placid surface, YY ashington was
in a turmoil last summer and many even
feared that the war would be ended lie
fore we were effectively in it. bor some
months the attacks on the administration
were very heavy. "There were times
when one wished Woodrow Wilson a
Republican because of the attacks suff
ered," continued the speaker. "These
attacks started up again a month ago
and we may be sure they will come again
in 1920."
After a clear cut picture of present
conditions, the speaker turned to Lin
coln's administration, to which he devot
ed the remainder of his talk. "The
biographies of Lincoln say but little of
attacks on him," said Professor Tatlock,
"but it is surprising what an amount of
distrust and suspicion it is found Lin
coln had. to on dure, when a research is
made of Civil War newspapers and
records of Congressional debate. 1 have
