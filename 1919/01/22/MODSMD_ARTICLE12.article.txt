# BARONESS HUARD WILL RELATE HER WAR EXPERIENCES
## TO SPEAK FRIDAY NIGHT AT ASSEMBLY "My Year at the Front" Will Be the Subject of the Lecture 
### 
Baroness Huard, the American
woman who married the well-known
French artist, anil who for three years
of the Great War lived in Prance and
suffered along with the French people,
will speak at the Assembly Hall Fri
day evening, January 24, when she
will tell of her experiences in the fight
ing zone.
Madame Huard's books, "My Home
in the Field of Honour" and "My
Home in the Field of Mercy," have al
ready a fast hold on the hearts of all
Americans who have read them. Just
back from France with tlie memories
of her experiences fresh in her mind,
lier story should be of interest to
everyone on the campus.
The Baroness (who was, before her
marriage, Miss Frances Wilson) was
living near Chateau Thierry when the
war broke out in August, 1914. The
story of finding herself absolutely
alone, save for a few servants, in the
army zone, her awakening to the hor
rors of war caused by the sudden ap
pearance of thousands of reugees, her
unwillingness to believe in the fright
fulness of German kultur, and her
hair-breadth escape from France has
thrilled many an audience.
When she and her little nartv had
reached Melun the tide of battle
turned. Then followed the triumphant
return across the smoking battlefields,
the despair at finding her beautiful
chateau in ruins, every treasure stolen
or defaced, and the cleaning up and
Installation of a hospital.
Madame Huard will tell all this in
her talk Friday night. Luckily, she
has also a large number of slides re
produced from photographs taken by
her during her flight and afterwards,
and these will supplement her lecture.
The community is afforded an un
usual opportunity in hearing this first
hand story of the war. Admission is
free.
