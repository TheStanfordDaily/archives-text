# A 						CALL TO ACTION
## 
### 
In yesterday's Daily Palo Alto was published a communication
from one of the many Stanford men who, exchanging the lieutenant's
uniform for cords, have returned from positions of authority in the
service to resume their studies on the "Farm". Their point of view is
that of those accustomed to he entrusted with powers of command, and
it is only natural that they should chafe at the slightest suggestion of
being treated as incapable of self-government. The Daily does not
believe that such is the intention or policy of university authorities. In
order to obtain any sort of student government, the students must show
that they are interested enough in the subject and sincere enough in
their desire for it to work out a plan for student control which will be
satisfactory to the authorities and free from the disadvantages of the
old form of student control. In this connection the Daily Palo Alto
cannot endorse too highly the suggestion in yesterday's communication
that some sort of a league be formed to discuss the question, consider
suggestions, and work out a plan for proposal to faculty and students
for adoption. This league could be formal or informal, large or small,
restricted or unrestricted in its membership. The only prerequisite for
it should be that it thoroughly represent student opinion.
The chief difficulty in campaigns of this kind is always to start the
log rolling. If a league such as suggested was once organized, the work
would continue of its own momentum. Happily, there now exists the
machinery to start the movement. As the only official representative of
the whole student body, the Student Council should take the initiative
in the organization of this league, whatever form it is to take.
Events of the past week have, in the opinion of the Daily Palo
Alto, demonstrated the desirability of some form of student control.
During this time, several acts of hoodlumism have been committed on
the campus, of which the overwhelming majority of the campus com
munity thoroughly disapproves, and concerning which students would
like to take action if there were any way in which they might do so. At
the present time there is no way in which the voice of the student body,
which is most deeply concerned in these acts, can be heard. There are
no means by which the offenders can be made to feel the weight of pub
lic disapproval besides admonition and advice by individuals, which is
.bound to be uncertain and ineffectual. The only alternative to this is
by furnishing information on fallow-students to superior authorities,
which is contrary to the most fundamental principles of student ethics
and thoroughly distasteful to a Stanford man. The right kind of stu
dent control could handle cases like these.
