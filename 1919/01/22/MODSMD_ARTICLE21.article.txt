# At Stanford 25 Years Ago

### 
The Roble ladies were at home on
Saturday evening and pleasantly enter
tained the one hundred and thirty-five
gentlemen who acceptcd the invitations
which have been sent out. Conversa
tion wa<Â» the order of the evening, and
cards with interesting topics were
among the guests.
Today J. A. Rice of San Diego, a
special student, opened a confectionery
and general nation store near the co
operative book store. If the students
accord this new enterprise the same
patronage which two fruit wagons have
been accustomed to receive, another
opportunity will have been afforded a
student to make money in a community
where all possible means of making
money should be controlled by those
who compose the community.
It seems necessary to give certain of
the professors another reminder about
keeping classes after the ringing of the
electric bells. This habit is particularly
disagreeable when indulged in the last |
hour of the morning. Several times
lately students living in Palo Alto and
Mayfield have complained of missing the
noon buses because a careless professor
had detained the fourth hour class. In
rainy weather this is obviously annoying.
