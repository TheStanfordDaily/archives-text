# PRICE RAISED ON ENGLISH PUBLICATIONS
## 
### 
The rise in price of all books of
English publication is announced by
the Bookstore. This general rise is
due to the recent decision of the Cus
toms department in regards to techni
cal differences between American and
English publishers, and a still greater
rise is predicted.
The latest English published book to
arrive is Cohen's "Theoretical Organic
Chemistry," which was ordered last
fall and has just arrived. Tt is retailed
at $2.75.
In accordance with the increase in
prices, Everyman's Library has also
advanced, and cloth-bound books are
now selling at 90 cents and leather
bound at $1.50. This is a decided in
crease in the old price of 70 cents and
$1.25.
A branch of the county library is
now at the Bookstore, and over one
hundred volumes are at hand, compris
ing books of travel, fiction and biogra
phy, and the county and state libraries
may be called upon to furnish special
books upon request.
