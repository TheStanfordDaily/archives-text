# Cant Get Any Line On Roble
## 
### 
Dear Pa:
This is to let you know that I am
an a receiving mood for a little check
again, and this time it's to buy shoes
with. You remember I told you that
I knew a nice little frosh? Well,
all these freshmen girls and lots of
other nice ones, too, live over in a
big hall called Roble. The trouble is
that Roble isn't exactly in my every
day path, and whenever I want to
make a date over there I have to walk
clear over there and back. And you
know how women is. Half the time
they're not home, and then I have to
chase back about four or five times.
Gee, Pa. sometimes I get plumb dis
gusted with life. I'd phone Roble and
save all this walkin', only I did it once,
and never again! I had to confess all
my sins for the past six years and had
to swear to any innocence of motives.
Then I was told that young women
couldn't talk over the phone unless
their professor's mother-in- law was
about to die. One other night I told
central I would take her to the movies
if she would give me the Roble line
again, so she connected me. 1 told
Mrs. Roble that I was long distance
and that I had an urgent message for
one of the inmates. But I guess Mrs.
Roble was suspicious; anyhow, she
said it was the first "he" central she
ever heard of, and then banged up the
phone. So, Pa, I walk over there when
I make any dates now, and you can
see why I have lost weight since I
came I hope you will tell my
cousin Mary Anne to come here to
college, 'cause it beats a girls' semi
nary all hollow. She wouldn't get to
make more than one or two dates a
year, anyhow. And I don't believe in
dates much more now, Pop. College
girls should be careful.
Dutiful as ever,
HENRY.
