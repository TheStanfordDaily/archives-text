# LANE CLINIC MAY SUBSTITUTE FOR WAR ACTIVITIES
## SUGGESTIONS OFFERED WAR BOARD San Francisco Work Appeals as Practical Solution to Difficulties 
### 
Seven different suggestions for work
in the Lane Clinic -vere submitted to
the Women's War Board at the meet
ign held last night in the Women's
Club House by the committee appoint
ed to investigate the opportunities for
philanthropic work in San Francisco.
Of these, the most important is that
of making clothes for the children who
are constantly coming into the clinic.
All of the patterns for this work are
very simple and could easily be han
dled by inexperienced women who
would be willing to do the work.
Scrap-books for the children waiting
to be examined are badly needed and
would offer temporary work for the
college women.
Mrs. Katherine Barnett, with whom
plans for the campus work were dis
cussed, pointed out the great need at
the clinic for entertainment. She sug
gested that a movie fund be raised
which would allow most particularly
the mothers who come into the clinic
for recreation the opportunity to enjoy
a moving picture performance. Many
of these women have never been in
side of a moving picture theater be
cause all of the extra money in the
family budget goes to the amusement
of the children. A visiting committee
was suggested on account of the need
which the bed patients have for a
cheerful word or a bouquet of flowers.
If any emergency work came up Mrs.
Barnett would call upon the War
Hoard for aid if she considered it ad
visable.
Looking further into the future,
plans for a convalescent home were
suggested, to be maintained almost en
tirely by the students of the Univer-
I sity. This work would be particularly
! important during the summer session
j when the children could get out into
the-fresh air during the school vaca
tion.
All of these plans will be submitted
to the Lane Clinic Association at a
joint meeting of the two organizations
to be held next Monday evening. As
soon as the substitute for the war
work of the board is worked out the
War Board will probably recommend
to the Women's Conference that it be
dissolved as a war board but that the
! nucleus be retained in the formation
of a new organization for philan
thropic work on the campus.
