# BARONESS HUARD WILL SPEAK AT ASSEMBLY FRIDAY NIGHT
## WAR EXPERIENCE TOPIC Home Near Chateau Thierry Was Twice Invaded by the Germans 
### 
Relating the actual experiences of a
woman whom the mobilization left
alone in her chateau at Villiers, near
Soissons, Baroness Huard will present
her illustrated lecture, "My Year
Among the Fighters," Friday night at
8 o'clock in the Assembly Hall.
In this lecture Madame Huard will
tell of the refugees, the alarm, her
escape from the invaders, the battle of
the Marne, her return across the smok
ing battlefields to her home after the
bombardment and the looting, an emer
gency hospital in the wilderness, and
her life there shut off from all commun
ication with the outside world from
September, 1914, to the end of the war.
The Baroness, although American by
birth, was educated in France and there
married the well-known French painter,
Baron Huard. She was living in her
beautiful home near Chateau Thierry
when the war broke out in 1914. That
part of the country was twice invaded,
once at the time when the Baroness
lived through the terrible experiences
which she will relate in her lecture here.
The second time her home was overrun
by the enemy she was lecturing in this
country, and was in ignorance of what
had happened for some time.
Baroness Huard is perhaps better
known here as a writer than as a lec
turer. In the wealth of books dealing
with the war there are none more wide
ly read by the American public than
her two works, "My Home in the Field
of Honor" and "My Home in the Field
of Mercy." The first is a simple narra
tive of a woman left at home in her
chateau sixty miles northeast of Paris,
during the perilous times of the inva
sion and great retreat; the second, the
story of the glorious rehabilitation of
the home into a home of mercy and
succor for the French wounded.
Admission to the lecture will be free.
