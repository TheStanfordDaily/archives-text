# VARSITY SWAMPS Y.M.I. QUINTET IN FAST GAME
## 
### 
Stanford came home with her second
basketball victory of the year last night,
when the Y. M.1 team from San Fran
cisco went back with a 50 to 16 defeat
hanging around its neck. And the beat
ing would have been much greater, had
it not been for one Morton on the Y.
M. I. team, who alone made 12 points
for his team, shooting from all angles
of the floor.
The Varsity in its game last night
used a brand of teamwork never seen
in this part of the world before. Every
man seemed to know just where his
partner was to be all the time, and
there the ball went, with a basket the
next result. Big Swede Righter. play
ing center, made nine field goals, and
in addition wore out two centers put
against him. Hood at forward and
Pelouze, his partnfcr, each put the ball
in live times. And the guards, Lilly,
Caughey, and Williamson, not needed in
the basket-shooting line, put up a pretty
game in the enemy's part of the field.
There are good men on the Varsity,
mighty good men, but Coach Evans is
j anxious to have a larger turnout. "I
can use every player that shows up
here," was his comment last night.
"There should be plenty of good men

in college who should be put out for the
team.''
The squad will not be cut down
through the season, so every man out
at the present realizes he has to work
for his job. Result, a fast basketball
team.
Provided something unexpected does
not happen to players or coaches of
either university, this season's series
with California should be a battle that
will be worth driving from the North
Pole to see. Hjelte, star center of the
Oakland Y. M. C. A., is back at Califor
nia, and this man will be pitted against
Righter. The result of the play between
these two alone will be worth the game.
Then Majors and Symes of the 1921
team at Berkeley will play forward for
the Blue and Gold. Majors weighs some
180 pounds, and Symes has worlds of
speed. But at Stanford there is Lilly,
and Caughey, and Williamson, and three
or four others. It will take more than
speed and weight to make baskets
against such a combination of guards.
California under Stanford's goal will
depend on Captain Green and possibly
Gordon to keep Hood, Pelouze, Moul
ton, Esgen, Bucklin et al. from ringing
in the baskets. The question here will
