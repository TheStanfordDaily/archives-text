# FAST SWIMMING IS LOOKED FOR IN THE MEET TOMORROW
## 
### 
That the swimming meet to be held
Friday afternoon at the Encina swim
merv will be one of the fastest inter
class meets of the year, is the candid
| opinion of Coach Brandsten, when speak
ing of the possibilities of lining np new
; material for a 100 per cent Varsity team.
As far as is known there will be an un
i
; usually large number of mermen to try
! for places in Friday's splash.
This meet, though but preparatory to
the spring events scheduled will show to
a large extent what the prospects will be
for a winning nineteen team. Those
' men who arc out to the First meet of
the year and show marked ability in the
sport will undoubtedly make the team.
Men in the swimming classes have shown
up well in the past few weeks and no
! doubt with this consistant work some
neat exhibitions in high diving, distances,
and sprints, will be run off. Coach
Brandsten has made a call to all the
i men who expect to enter the line-up and
1 urgently requests that these men sipn up
I with him immediately.
