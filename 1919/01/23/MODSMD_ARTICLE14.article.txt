holes of hiding to resume their activities with all the old-time youth and
vigor. Hence our disappointment has been profound to see time and
again shining and unabashed faces topped by the familiar gray vacuum
cap walking almost arm in arm with equally unabashed members of the
"500" junior, who, to do them justice, are probably unaware of the pit
falls they are laying in the paths of the callow youths by such encour

who still queen on the Quad and smoke in public on the campus.
By the way, the Daily Palo Alto would like to find some one who
can explain those cigar and cigarette stubs found lying around in the
center of the Quad.
