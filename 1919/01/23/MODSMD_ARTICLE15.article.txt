## 
### 
"America's part in world politics has
always been an idealistic dream, but
somehow those dreams always come
true," asserted Professor Robinson in
his talk on "America's Part in the
European Conference" at an open meet
ing of the Nestoria Debating Society
last night.
H. H. Hoss, '18, who was visiting,
gave a talk on the purposes, customs and
history of the society.
After the regular meeting a business
meeting was held, in which the future
policy was discussed. It was decided
that in the future the debates would be
short and snappy and the meetings as
interesting as possible.
