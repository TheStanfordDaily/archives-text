# "GERMANY IN AFRICA" APPEARS IN OUTLOOK
## 
### 
An article by Mrs. Anita Allen Per
rine, ex-'l7, whose death occurred
recently, is appearing in the Outlook for
the current week, under the title of
"German Africa and the Peace Con
ference," in which is sketched the history
of Germany's expansion in Africa from
1884 to 1904. Mrs. Perrine believed that
tmhe African colonies should not be
given back to Germany not only because
of her ambitions, but because of the
essential selfishness of Germany's colonial
policy.
