Harvard University
Short of Funds
Harvard University is facing a se
ious shortage in funds for carrying
cn her spring athletics, due to the fact
that her usual annual receipts, aver
aging $100,000 or more, from the foot
ball season, have not been turned in.
Since 1916, when Yale treated the
Crimson to a 6 to 3 defeat, Harvard
has not had an athletic team that has
even approached paying its expenses.
As this is the case, the amount of
money that Harvard has to spend this
spring will be small in comparison
with other years, and therefore sports
of all forms will have to submit to a
nithless cutting of expenses."
The Harvard crew rac3-i that have
been held on the Thames have always
reached high figures. The last pre
war season cost $31,000 and the re
ceipts were but one-sixth of the total
expenditure.
