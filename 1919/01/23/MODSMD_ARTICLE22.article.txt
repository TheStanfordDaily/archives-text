# At Stanford . . . . . 25 Years Ago

### 
The Pioneer Class
Over one hundred and forty mem
bers of the pioneer class were present
in the chapel this afternoon at the
semester's election of officers. This
meeting was in marked contrast to the
one of last week that brought out but
thirty-seven persons. Another inter
esting part was the presence of nearly
forty young ladies.
Chester Magee, in an appeal for
representation of "that large body of j
our best students that is so little rec- j
ognized," nominated Thomas Code —a
very evident surprise, and one that
later developments in the election
made more so. Cox placed in nomina
tion J. J. Hollister, also of the En
gineering department.
Rice nominated Miss Steffens for
second vice-president; Collins nomi
nated Hoover for treasurer.
At California
The young ladies of the senior class
at the U. C. created a sensation yes
terday by appearing in mortarboard
and gown. They hope to convert their
brother seniors to the idea of wearing
the cap and gown on commencement
day. j
