# BASEBALL MEN BEGIN WORKOUTS UNDER EVANS
## MORE PITCHERS NEEDED Former Varsity Men Return to Strengthen Ranks of Cardinal 
### 
With the beginning of consistent
workouts and training by battery aspir
ants for the varsity baseball team, fol
lowers of the national pastime are be
ginning to dope the outlook for the
spring season.
A number of candidates for pitchers
and catchers are working out every
morning under the direction of Coach
Evans. Gillis and Fairchilds, twirlers
for last year's freshman nine, are at
present likely candidates for the mound.
Baker, a junior in the University, is
also out for the position. Although he
has never tried out for baseball here,
Baker made a good showing two years
ago among the Sacramento Valley high
schools.
C. W. Teubner. '21, first baseman on
the 1921 freshman team, is considered
by Coach Evans as likely material for
the box. He is as yet the only left
handed man to come into the field.
"Bobby" Pelouze will be out as soon
as the basketball season is over.
For catcher there are five candidates.
Filly, Ncwland, and Classen, who acted
on the receiving end of the freshman
nine last year, are working out. Repath,
former rugby man, and Stuart, a trans-j
t'er frÂ®m Santa Barbara Junior College,]
nrc showing up well. As a transfer,
from Junior College, Stuart will be elig-1
ible for the varsity.
There is a need for twice as many
pitching aspirants as are not out, ac
cording to Coach Evans. He is particu- j
larly anxious to get hold of more left
handed candidates.
"When the season opens up there are
going to be two or three games a
week." the mentor said today, "and I
can use any number of men on the
mound." One or two good pitchers will
not be able to stand the grind, and I
will give any man who can toss a base
ball a chance to make good."
Several of last year's varsity players
have returned to battle for other posi
tions around the diamond. Active prac
tice for the whole team will begin about
the middle of February if the weather
warms up a little.
"Cash" Davis, who held down the
first sack last year, will be back in his
usual position and will battle with Teub
rrer for the initial sack. Doe will be
back at second. Galloway will hold down
the short field position, and Kallum
should be able to win out for third. In
the field, Lilly, Kline, Parker, Knox,
and several other men are on deck.
