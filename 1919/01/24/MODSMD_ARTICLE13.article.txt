# VARSITY QUINTET WILL BUCK MARE ISLAND AGGREGATION
## SAILOR TEAM HEAVY ONE Game Will Give Dope on Varsity's Ability to Handle Big Men 
### 
Stanford varsity will go up against
one of the strongest service teams in
the west tonight, when they lock
horns with the Mare Island sailors
quintet. This team is considered one
of the strongest around the bay and
is heavy enough to match the varsity
in weight.
This will be the first time the Car
dinal team has played against a team
of equal weight, and as the sailors are
about a match in speed, the game is
likely to be hotly contested.
The contest will give fans an op
portunity to see what kind of a show
ing the Cardinal five can make against
a heavy combination and should give
considerable dope on the probable out
come of the series with the Blue and
Gold five.
Although California has played no
games as yet, with such men as Hjelte,
Majors, Symes, Green and Gordon, the
Golden Bear will undoubtedly turn
out a heavy, yet fast aggregation.
The Cardinal men are relying upon
"Fighting Bob's" invincible system of
teamwork to give them the edge on
the team from across the bay.
The lineup for tonight is not certain,
but "Swede" Righter will undoubtedly
play at his usual place. The big cen
ter has been putting up a brand of
fight in the past few games which has
worn down every man that his oppo
nents could put against him.
"Bill" Hood and "Bobby" Pelouze
will probably start at forward. "Fred
die" Williamson, "Reg" Coughey, and
"Ken" Lilly are sure of a chance to
work out in the enemy end of the
court.
The game tonight will be called at 8
o'clock. Students will be admitted
free.
