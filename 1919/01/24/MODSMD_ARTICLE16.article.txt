# THE
						KIND NOT TO HAVE

### 
College students have tlie reputation of being the most conservative
people in the world when it comes to making any change in their insti
tutions and traditions. Stanford is no exception to this rule, and when
the proposition for working out a new system of student control begin.s
to be actively discussed, there is bound to be a strong tendency to revert
to the system of before the war as a guiding model. Such a tendency
will be unfortunate, and, if followed out, is apt to result in the failure of
the whole project.
For whatever differences of opinion there may be in regard to the
desirability of student control in the future, or the form it should take,
in one thing all who have given thought to the matter are agreed,â€”
that the student control of the past has not been a success, and should
not be resorted to again.
Student control as it existed prior to I'MB was based on the system
of group affiliations, the student conference, the central body of the sys
tem, was made up of the presidents of living groups and a proportionate
number of representatives elected from Enema and non-affiliated stu
dents. Each representative, elected from a group, had the interests of
the whole student body. Ihe result was that the actions ol this disci
plinary body became finally, not a matter of justice, but of bargain and
sale. Alliances between living groups were a matter of course, and a
man who had a sufficient "pull" with a sufficiently important section of
the conference could violate almost any regulation with impunity, while,
to justify its existence, the conference meted out summary vengeance to
the unfortunate offender who lacked a pull. 1 his somewhat exag
gerated statement represents the natural tendency of any body so con
stituted even under the best conditions.
In discussion for a new form of student control, some plan should
be worked out which would result in the selection of men for their merit
and judicial ability, and not for their group affiliations.
