have large enrollments, according to re
ports from the gymnasium department
The hockey team will meet Mills Col
lege on February 14, when a large crowd
is expected to accompany the players
there in order to give support as root
ers. The team, which is composed main
ly of upperclassmen, is in excellent prac
tice. and there is every reason to expect
that Stanford will be the victor.
Interclass tennis is scheduled for
some time in February, and the teams
picked as a result of this contest will
meet Mills later. The University of
Nevada has also signified its desire to
compete with Stanford varsity players
in tennis. Signing up for the interclass
games is already in progress, and Miss
Ruth Garland, '20, president of the ten
nis club, urges that all the women take
an active interest in this quarter's ten
nis activities.
Tryouts for basketball teams have be
gun in earnest, and strenuous competi
tion will undoubtedly be a noticeable
feature.
