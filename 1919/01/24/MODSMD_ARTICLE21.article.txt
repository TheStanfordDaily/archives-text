# DR. JORDAN TALKS ON IRISH POLICY
## Failure of Constitutional Committee Explained by Ex-Chancellor 
### 
"The constitutional committee ap
pointed by Lloyd George to fix home
rule for Ireland failed because the men,
English and Irish, excellent as a whole,
were not selected by Ireland," said Dr.
Jordan, in an informal talk on Ireland,
at his home last night.
"The only way the question can be
settled is to make the committee wholly
and representative Irish. The different
counties of Ulster and of the west of
Ireland should choose their own repre
sentatives in a constitutional conven
tion, according to population, and with
in the range of the British Empire, they
should adjust Irish affairs. England
should keep hands off while they are
doing it. Every other method is bound
to fail, and every year of dallying
makes this more uncertain and diffi
cult."
"No legislation that the Imperial
parliament has made has ever been
framed by Irish members. They could
sometimes prevent unwelcome legisla
tion, but could originate nothing."
Sir Horace Plunkett of Dublin, says
Dr. Jordan, is the greatest and most use
ful man in Ireland, and lias done the
most for the people. It was lie who
planned to buy up the land-holders, and
to sell their estates to local buyers,
thereby solving the land question which
England is still confronting.
"Ireland has a great deal of history
|to forget, and England a great deal to
| remember," Plunkett said to Dr. Jor
! dan. "It is said that there are three
peoples who can't govern themselvesâ€”
; the Irish, Jews and Poles. If this were
i true, then the remedy is to force them
|to learn self-government."
Dr. Jordan pointed out the fact that
jof the four parts of Ireland, Ulster
comprises about one-half of the total
wealth, and is Protestant. The remain
ing three southern divisions are manly
Catholic, and are very poor, Dublin
having the most hopeless slums of any
city in Europe.
Dr. Jordan also mentioned Sir Ed
ward Carson, as the head of the faction
endeavoring to suppress Irish self-gov
ernment, who was responsible for the
resistance in Belfast, and especially for
| the "gun-running" from Hamburg.
