Editor I). P. A., Dear Sir:â€”
Three years ago the Stanford Unit of
the R. O. T. C. was established in the
University and since that time it has
served Stanford and Stanford men in a
manner which no other Campus organiza
tion lias or has been able to do. This
was during the unusual times it was true,'
but in these times it proved its worth |
and its right to existence. Now it is
about to die for lack of support, as only'
eighty-three men are registered for |
military when 100 are needed to keep the
unit. This seems hardly a just reward
for services rendered, and not at all a
due for a faithful servant.
Then again, within the last few days
quite a number of men have received
extra hours in military on the basis of
work done in the army. Then when
they have had their petitions signed by
Captain Parker, they boast that they
have grafted the hours from a depart
ment which they never expect to enter
again and which they hope to see die.
They forget, however, that if the de
partment does die there will lie hundreds
of Stanford men, now in France, who
will be "strictly out of luck" when they
do return, and who will have to look
elsewhere for their extra hours than to
a defunct military department, a fine
show of gratitude.
The writer of this article docs not
wish to take the argument of benefits
derived, although they are many, as the
i basis of his plea for more enlistments,
' but rather to make a plea to the patriot
ism of the Stanford student. Patriotism
not only for the nation but for Stanford
as well, for it is a sad commentary on
our school spirit if we allow an organiza
tion to die which has brought as much
fame to Stanford as any or all of her
athletic teams, and which in no way con
flicts with athletics. Many men have
gone out from the Stanford R. O. T. C.
to take command of troops in action,
while others have gone from its ranks
to die in the mud of France, and in so
doing have shed everlasting glory in their
Alma Mater.
"Rut," says the underclassman of the
present. "I served in the S. A. T. C. and
know all about drill and besides I'll be
too old if there ever is another war.'
This argument hardly goes with anyone
who has seen any real service, but
granted that he is too old when the next
war does come, Stanford men will not
be too old, for there are generations and
generations of Stanford men yet to
come, who are entitled to the same ad
vantages as their predecessors. So why
let a good dog die? W. C. F., '19
