# Ram's Head Show to Appear First in San Jose
## 
### 
Ram's Head Society of Stanford Uni
versity will stage a performance of its
musical extravaganza at San Jose at the
Victory theatre shortly before the cam
pus production.
A wire from Julian Eltinge received
Thursday by M. A. Hagen, '15, author
and director of the play, summoned both
the latter and Leland Pickering to San
Jose last night where the famous female
impersonator was playing. Upon El
tinge's recommendation, Mr. Barton, the
former's manager, completed arrange
ments whereby Ram's Head would pro
duce its show there.
Julian Eltinge's interest in the local
play is only natural considering the fact
that lie began his theatrical career with
the coaching of Harvard university
students of an organization similar to
Ram's Head Society.
One of the big features of the extrava
ganza will he the music of I. H. Larsen,
17 and A. D. Wilkie, '18, who have com
posed some unusually catchy numbers.
he next rehearsals of the female
chorus will be held at the Stanford
Assembly Hall uesday evening at 7
o'clock. The male chorus will meet at
the same place at 8. All members are
urged to be present at every rehearsal if
they wish to retain their places in the
cast, says the director, M. A. Hagen
