# RUDOLPH GANZ TO MAKE FIRST VISIT TO UNIVERSITY
## 
### 
Rudolph Ganz, the great Swiss pi
anist and composer, who will appear
at the Assembly Hall Friday even
ing, February 7th, under the auspices
of Frank W. Healv of San Francisco,
has never visited Stanford before, al
though he has made three successive
tours of the United States. During
these three seasons he has played
with the leading orchestras and with
most of the principal musical organi
zations and clubs of the country.
Mr. Ganz is recognized as one of the
best musicians among the pianists
now before the public. His distinctive
qualities from a standpoint of tech
nique are absolute clarity, the uncon
.onal accuracy which never deserti
him in the most difficult technical
tasks, and the splendid carrying qual
ity of the tone.
Musically considered, his work dis
plays strong rhythms and sound mu
sical conceptions. His work is singu
larly free from exaggeration and his
readings are dominated by a strong
unwavering will.
Tickets for the concert are now on
sale at the Bookstore and at Robinson
& Crandall's in Palo Alto at $1,
and 50 cents.
