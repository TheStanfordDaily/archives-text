# MME. HUARD TO SPEAK ON DEVASTATION IN WAR ZONE
## BARONESS FROM FRANCE "My Year Among the Fighters" Will Be Subject for Illustrated Talk 
### 
"My Year Among the Fighters" will
be the subject of the illustrated lec
ture in the Assembly Hall tonight at
8 o'clock, by the Baroness Huard, an
American woman who married a well
known French artist and lived for
three years in the war zone of France.
Just back from the battle fields,
with the memories of her terrible ex
periences fresh in her mind, the
baroness has lectured to record crowds
all through the east, and it will be a
great privilege for Stanford to be able
to hear her.
When the war broke out in 1914,
Madame Huard was living at her
home near Chateau Thierry. The
story of suddenly finding herself in
the midst of the army zone, alone ex
cept for the presence of a few serv
ants, and her escape with thousands
of other refugees, has held many au
diences spell-bound.
When she and her little party
reached Melun the tide of battle
turned. Then followed the trium
phant return across the smoking bat
tlefields, the despair at finding her
beautiful chateau in ruins, every treas
ure stolen or defaced, and the clean
ing up and installation of a hospital
there. Her second book on the war,
"My Home in the Field of Mercy," de
scribes conditions in this hospital. Her
first book, "My Home in the Field of
Honor," is a narrative of the perilous
times she experienced during the in
vasion and the great retreat.
Madame Huard will tell of all thi*
in her talk tonight. She will illus
trate her lecture with slides re pro
duced from photographs which ohe
took herself during her flight and her
return. There will be no admission
charged for the lecture.
