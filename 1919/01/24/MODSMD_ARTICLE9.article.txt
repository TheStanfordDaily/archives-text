# Greenleaf Players Act Here Friday
## New Drama Under Direction of Armfield Secured by English Club 
### 
Something wholly unique, modern, j
and yet artistic will come to Stanford |
in the first dramatic performance of the j
year, which is to be given by the Green-J
leaf Theater players in the Assembly |
Hall a week from tonight. The fact;
that a processional play in verse, a
moonlight fantasy, dancing, gesture-1
poems, and art songs make up the pro- j
gram of this Little Theater production
betrays the individuality of the Green- J
leaf Theater idea.
The strolling players of England in
the time before Shakespeare suggested
the Greenleaf Theater, and Mr. and
Mrs.-Greenleaf are especially interested
in the evolution of a distinctly Ameri-i
can drama based on the same simplicity
and spontaneity. Mr. Armfield was â– 
here looking over the stage yesterday'
with members of the English Club. A
program of a recent performance given
in Berkeley, where the players have
been for the last month, says: "The
Greenleaf Theater aims at giving pro
grams that delight and cheer; it is not
afraid to be serious, nor is it afraid to
be gay."
Mr. Greenfield is an artist of note
who has pictures in the Luxembourg
Gallery in Paris, and Mrs. Armfield is
an author of verse, writing under the
name of "Constance Smedley."
