The following selection will be requir-
< <1 of those trying out, and may be either
read or recitcd :
"• Ml the world's a stage," as Shakespeare
said one day—
"The stage a world" was what he ,meant
to say.
Here suffering virtue ever finds relief,
And hiack browed ruffians always come
to grief,
When the lorn damsel with a frantic
speech.
\n<l cheeks as hueless as a brandicd
peach,
Cries, "Help! ky-ind Heaven," and drops
upon her knees,
On the green-baize beneath the
trees.
See to her side avenging Valor fly,
"J fa! Villain! Draw! Now Terraytor,
yield or die!"
When the poor hero flounders in despair.
Some dear-lost uncle turns up million
aire,
Clasps the young scape grace witl
paternal joy.
Sob- on his neck, "My boy! My boj
-MV ROY!"
