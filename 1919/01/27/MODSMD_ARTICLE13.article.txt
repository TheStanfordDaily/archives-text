# MARE ISLAND FIVE LOSES TO VARSITY IN FAST CONTEST
## 32-25 IS THE FINAL SCORE "Swede" Righter Big Point Winner for Stanford Quintet 
### 
Mare Island's basketball men put a
scare into the Varsity five last Friday
night tbat was not finally dispelled until
Swede Righter had made his eleventh
basket of the game and thereby put
Stanford into the lead 32 to 25. The
Sailors proved to have the fastest and
one of the heaviest teams seen on the
Cardinal court for some time, and they
proceeded to use all their speed and
weight on the Varsity.
At the end of the first period the vis
itors led by a count of 17 to 13. How
ever, between halves Coach Evans must
have used several shots of "hop' on his
men, for, following their rest, the Var
sity came back with more speed on of
fense than the Navy men could fathom,
with the result that nine baskets were
added to the count column, enough to
win the game. At the same time the
defense tightened up, and the Sailors
made but three baskets.
Friday's game was the best seen this
year. The play was fast, both fives used
team work in good shape, and the final
score was simply the result of superior
playing.
The principal trouble with the Var
sity at present seems to be foul shoot
ing. Only two shots were putin the
basket out of five attempted in the Navy
game. In past California series the
matter on two or three points often has
decided a contest.
Moulton sprained his ankle in the
game and may be out for some time.
