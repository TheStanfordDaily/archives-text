# THE
						R.O.T.C.
## 
### 
In their natural reaction from four and a half years of war, uni
versity students, like most other human wish to forget as much
of things military as they can. The universal desire to lay down the
bayonet and automatic and take up the pen and slide rule is commend
able and shows the innate wholesomeness of American life.
But this natural desire may be carried too far, and to drop 4 military
altogether at this time would be a mistake, and a misfortune to Stan
ford. During the whole period of the war the University was rated by
the government as one of those who contributed the most toward the
winning of the war. Its record was surpassed by none, and in many
ways the government showed its appreciation of the work done here.
Now it is announced that, owing to the small number registered, the R.
O. T. C. unit is in danger of being lost. A few more registrations will
insure its continuance, for one hundred is the minimum required by the
government, and over eighty have so far enrolled in the unit.
Whatever is to be the future of military training in this country it is
certain that colleges and universities will play an immensely important
part in it. To those interested, participation in a R. O. T. C. unit will
be of great advantage in the case of a future war, or in case the outcome
of the Peace Conference is such that an extensive policy of military
training will be adopted in the United States.
The University should not lose its present military status at a time
like this.
