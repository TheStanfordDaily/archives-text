# R.O.T.C. AFFAIRS IN CRITICAL CONDITION
## Stanford May Lose the Unit Unless Registration Increases 
### 
According to Captain S. M. Parker,
commandant of Stanford's R 0. T C.,
military affairs at the University have
leached a critical period in their ex
istence. The registration for military
courses has been so- low up to date
that Stanford is in danger of losing
the right to maintain an R. O. T. C.
of junior and senior grade. It is point
ed out that unless the number of men
taking military is augmented, the
government may demand discontnu
ance of the R. O. T. C. at Stanford.
The R .O. T. C. has been a big fac
tor in the development of officers in
the past, and was a big item in ob
taining men admittance to officers'
training camps throughout the coun
try. For the past two years Stan
ford -has been on the distinguished
list of universities with R. O. T. C.
institutions and this factor did much
in qualifying Stanford men for train
ing camps.
Providing an interest in the Uni
versity military body reawakens, there
is possibility of an artillery unit be
ing established at Stanford, similar to
that which won such decided favor at
Yale. Tt is highly probable that ma
chine guns may be secured for train
ing purposes.
Equipment to be supplied the men
this year will be of the best available,
according to statement from the sup
ply office of the unit. Enfield rifles -
used by the troops in camps and over
seas, are to be secured. Ball ammu
nition for extensive range work will
be supplied.
Commutation of rations for men ob
taining a ranking as senior member?
of the R. O. T. C. is paid by the gov
ernment and amounts to approxi
mately $12 a month.
