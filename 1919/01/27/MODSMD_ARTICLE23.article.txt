Amherst alumni are planning a
great welcome home for the former
students of the college who served
with the eoloj-s. More than a thou
sand of these men will be invited to
attend the New York reunion on Feb
ruary 21. They will be the guests of
the graduates of the college.
A memorial volume, containing the
name and service record of every
graduate or student of the college who
took part in the war Avill be published
by the undergraduate honorary socie
ties of Tufts.
Yale has finally fixed February 24
and -25 as the dates for the junior
prom. It is now expected that one of
the dormitories will be used to pro
vide accommodations for the guests.
Although the freshman class is the
largest of the undergraduate classes
at Harvard, it is still considerably
smaller than was expected. Most col
leges in the year of returning peace
report small senior, junior and sopho
more classes, but entering classes as
somewhat approaching normal in size.
At Harvard, on the contrary, the
contrary, the freshman class is
smaller even than it was last year, the
total registration of the college to
date being 1740.
