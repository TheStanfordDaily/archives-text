### 
The "I'lu Mystery" is the title of the
public health service's record of experi
ments which have just been carried on
in San Francisco and P>oston by navy
physicians. They called for volunteers
who would expose themselves to the
"flu" germ as the band of heroic phy
sicians in the famous "yellow fever'
squad" did in solving the mystery of
yellow fever. One hundred bluejackets
responded and exposed themselves to
the deadly germs in every known form.
But to the astonishment of the phy
sicians of the navy and of the public
health service, not a man so exposed or
inoculatcd developed any symptoms of
the "flu."
