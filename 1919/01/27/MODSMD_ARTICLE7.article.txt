# BARONESS HUARD RECOUNTS STORY OF WAR HORRORS
## LECTURE GIVEN FRIDAY Writer of Two War Books Gives Exepriences in Hospitals 
### 
"Here is my home, twenty-eight
miles from Soissons, fou from Cha
teau Thierry," said Modsrae Huard as
the first of a series of pictures was
thrown on the screen before a large
crowd in Assembly Hall Friday night.
"It has served as a shelter for refu
gees; it has been a hospital; it shel
tered a victorious German army for
nine days. Later it was the scene of
a stubborn resistance when the Ger
mans were repulsed by the Ameri
cans."
Madame Huard remained behind
with five servants when her husband,
who is one of the inventors of cam
ouflage, enlisted a few days after the
declaration of war. "Railways, daily
papers, telegraph and telephone no
longer existed for us. We knew less
than yoy in America.
Down the road past Madame
Huard's house a stream of women and
children, refugees from Belgium and
from French towns near the fighting
continually passed by. They were all
in wretched physical condition arid
some were mad from their suffering.
Then the word came that the Ger
mans were coming down that same
road and it was necessary to flee.
As Madame Huard with her serv
ants came to each village, it was only
to learn that it had been evacuated
the day before.
Madame Huard served as official in
terpreter for a commissiariat division.
Though she was quite near the fight-1
ing, it was not until after the battle j
of the Marne, however, that she knew j
how the war was resulting.
Then there came what she expected j
to be the happy return to her home,!
but a victorious German army had j
lived there for nine days; the interior I
of the house was in ruins. After '
wards the ehampaigne bottles found I
in the house and yard were counted; ;
there were 9000. Two hundred quarts |
lof jam had been poured inside the;
1 piano. Her husband's paintings, in-1
tended for an exhibition, the work of 1
twenty years, were torn from their
j frames.
In the town and neighborhood there j
was none able to stand on his feet,!
| so the house was fitted up for a hos-:
pital; immediately there were twenty
j cases of malignant typhoid. During
i the following year five hundred ty- j
phoid cases were treated and only one
i patient died. As the government al
: lowed but 36 cents a day for a patient, i
the hospital was mostly dependent on !
gifts, and Madame Huard decided to >
j come to America to enlist the syrn
! pathies of the people here.
"The hospital lias been moved to
Paris now," Madame Huard said in
j closing. "It has done wonderful
i things and no white person there has |
j received the slightest remuneration,
i I have seen one of the most prom- {
ising young French violinists brought ]
in, the hand that held the strings but!
a mass of useless flesh. The doctors!
grafted his skin, removed a piece of!
the wrist bone from his other hand,
and not long ago I heard him play his
first concert."
After the assembly Madame Huard
showed drawings of war scenes made
by her husband. The money from
their sale is to go to the hospital fund,
which it will be necessary to support
for two months more.
