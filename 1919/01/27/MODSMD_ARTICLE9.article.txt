# "Glad Hand" Issue of Chaparral to Appear Tomorrow
## 
### 
In accordance with Chaparral's re
cently adopted constructive policy, Ed
itor Les Levy, '19, announces that when
the "Glad Hand" issue appears tomor
row it will be featured by a poem writ
ten by Sam Briggs, '19, in a Pasadena
sewer, where he is now doing construc
tion work.
The Glad Hand motif will run
through the entire issue, including ed
itorials, cover and poems. The cover,
which was drawn by Miss Ruth Taylor,
ex-'l9, is printed in three tasteful colors,
purple, green and buff, and depicts the
returned Stanford soldier in his newly
donned cords receiving Chappie's glad
hand.
A. H. Harzfeld, '20, has written a
poem, "The Glad Hand," that is one of
the choicest bits of tomorrow's issue.
Sam Glikbarg, '19, li as produced several
foolish little pieces of verse that will
also tend to brighten Chappie's looks.
Considerable campus interest has been
aroused by the announcement of the
Chaparral staff that Chappie intends to
constructively criticise the "Stanford Il
lustrated Review" in an editorial in their
"Glad Hand" number. The hook will be
on sale 011 the Quad tomorrow at the old
price of 25 cents.
