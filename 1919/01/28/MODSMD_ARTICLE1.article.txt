Coach Evans has announced that
formal baseball practcie will start
February 8. Pitchers and catchers
have been working out for several
days, and will by the end of ihe month
be able to start in with the remainder
c: the candidates for the nine.
The baseball season wi'l start some
where around February 15, and from
then on through February, March,
April, and May the national game will
be dished up regularly. Two games
with the Olympic Club, five with the
nine from Santa Clara, a series with
St. Mary's, and individual contests
with the San Jose Bears, Bank of
Italy, and other fast teams around the
bay will be on deck.
The California series starts April 2f>
at Stanford. Then come games May
3 at California, and May 10 at Stan-1
ford.
Possibilities are that a soccer team
will be organized at the University j
this spring. California has found
enough players to put out an eleven j
in the sport, and has challenged Stan- j
ford to a series of games.
Gymnasium Director Knollin has
taken the matter into his hands and
has issued a call for soccer men to
sign up with him. There is a dearth
of old material on hand, but if a large i
number ot candidates turn out, a team i
will be organized and games sched-1
uled both with California and with j
bay soccer clubs.
At present Pillsbury and Boyle are :
the only men who have had experi-1
ence in soccer, who are back in col
lege.
Prospective soccerites can hand in j
their names at the gymnasium.
