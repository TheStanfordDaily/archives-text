# AUXILIARY BOARD FOR LANE CLINIC IS REORGANIZED
## 
### 
A complete reorganization of the
| Lane Clinic Auxiliary Board came
j about as the result of a joint meeting
!of the Lane Clinic and Women's War
! Board representatives in the vestry last'
night. A new organization issued forth'
with the passing of the old, and all
members present agreed that this or-!
iganization will be stronger and more 1
: extensive than the former one.
The Stanford Lane Clinic Auxiliary
has been heretofore composed of repre-;
sentatives from the women's living units
on the campus and from the faculty. I
j They have attempted to accomplish as
I much work as possible, but have always
| felt that there was a much larger field
I than they could cover successfully.;
When the proposal from the Women's
! War Board came to the clinic, that the
| work be enlarged by placing it in the j
hands of the Associated Women Stu
j dents instead of depending entirely upon j
'representatives from the houses, it was
welcomed as a solution to the problem, j
Under the new plan, the board will
Ibe composed as follows: Dr. R. P.
Wilbur, president ex-officio; Mrs. R. L.
Wilbur, permanent member; Chaplain
P. C. Gardner, treasurer, with two mem
| iters to be elected to the board from
each of the following constituencies: j
J The Faculty Club, the Associated
[Women Students through the Women's
IW ar Board, the Alumni Association, and
the Palo Alto Auxiliary.
The work of the C litiic is to be divided
among these different units, the faculty
i and alumni concerning themselves with
| investigating the advisability of estab
lishing a permanent convalescent home
for clinic children on the campus; the
I'alo Alto friends will provide baskets
jof food and boxes of provisions at
Christmas and Thanksgiving; while the
Women's War Board will probably de
vote its efforts to such activities as mak
ing scrapbooks and sending flowers to|
the ill. However, the specific work of
j this organization will be decided by the
women, in the meeting to be called in
| the near future.
