## GAME TOMORROW NIGHT Varsity to Journey to Davis for Game Saturday With Davis Farm 
### 
Basketball will not hold forth at
Encina gymnasium tomorrow night,
although the varsity five will prob
ably play the San Jose Y. M. C A. at
San Jose. Unless a change in plan
ic made the team will not be in action
on the local floor until next Tuesday.
The first game in the California-
Nevada League is scheduled for next
Saturday, when Stanford plays Davis
Farm School at Davis. Manager Ames
is endeavoring to make arrangements
with the farm school team to play at
Stanford, however, since Santa Clara
is to play Stanford at Stanford next
Tuesday, and Coach Evans wishes to
give his men all the practice possible
at the gym before the contest with
the Red and White.
Since the California-Nevada League
will be going full tilt after Saturday,
the game with the San Jose team will
be the last scheduled contest outside
the league.
Davis Farm School has a rather
weak team, and should cause the vars
ity no trouble, unless a big slump
comes into the Stanford camp. Santa
Clara, however, has her usual quota
oi stars, and will give the Cardinal a
real run for her money. On present
prospects, the Red and White will just
about defeat Stanford unless Coach
Evans is able to put a larger amount
of fight into the team. The forwards
are not going up to the standard of
the rest of the team, and will need
to work hard if they are to beat the
mission school.
