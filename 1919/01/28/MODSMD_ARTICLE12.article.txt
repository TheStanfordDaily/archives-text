# TENNIS SEASON TO OPEN UP SATURDAY
## OLD VETERANS RETURN Good Prospects for Giving Californians a Hard Battle 
### 
Stanford tennis fans will have their
I lirst opportunity of the new year to
view this season's stars, in the inter-club
and inter-fraternity tournament to be
staged at the Encina courts next Satur
day at 10 o'clock. The meet will be in
doubles and will be a handicap affair,
thus allowing each fraternity and club
j almost an equal show.
This meet will be the first opportunity
to get a real line on this season's tennis
i
players, as the previous practices held
have served merely to unloosen a little
jÂ«>f the stiffness from the joints of the
players. The contest, however, will fur
nish some good competition. With such
men as Barber. Bent, Captain Devlin,
Fish, Crosby and others the meet should
prove interesting enough.
So far, everything this quarter seems
to point to a swamping of the cohorts
of the Blue and Gold. The turnout has
been unusually large and the fine weath
er has made nearly two hours of prac
tice possible every day. The meet on
Saturday comes after four weeks of
stiff training, and .judging from recent
showings, promises to give a good line
on the players.
Captain Devlin announces that all the
fraternities and clubs have not yet made
entries, and he urges all to do so today
or tomorrow. This inter-fraternity
meet will enable him to pick the squad
to represent Stanford in the approach
ing tournaments, and every man who
can wield a racquet is urged to sup
port his club or fraternity on Saturday.
