# POLITICS
## 
### 
Between now and the second Wednesday in February, barely two weeks off,
candidates for class and Associated Students offices must be selected and groomed
for their races. Politics, in the broad sense, cannot be eliminated, and it is too
much to expect that the aspirants for office will spring up of their own accord or
by unanimous thought of the student body. They will be selected, most of them,
by a relatively small number, and the decision will be arrived at by a process of
agreements and understandings. It cannot be otherwise anywhere this side of
Utopia.
But this is no reason why the student body should let politics get completely
out of their hands and permit the political slate to be made up at a series of back
stairs conferences, influenced by considerations entirely foreign to the best inter
ests of the University and the fitness of the candidates for the offices they are to
occupy. Such has, unfortunately, sometimes been the case in the past; it ought
to be avoided in the future. If they knew that the whole voting population would
be more interested in the outcome, those most active in politics would be more
careful of the selections they make for offices.
The coming elections concern every student registered in the University. If
every student realized this, there would be no chance of a repetition of some <5f
the unfortunate experiences of the past.

Not being concerned with affairs outside the boundaries of the Farm, the
Daily can only attempt to voice the dull but ever-growing protest of the inhab
itants thereof at the lack of car service with which the University is being sup
plied. But perhaps the railroad company feels that it would be monotonous for
the passenger to travel in one direction all the time. And they may try to make
up for the casualness with which the red kindling boxes run by supplying a pleas
ant afternoon's or evening's journey, with many stop-over privileges, for the
nickel and the penny.
