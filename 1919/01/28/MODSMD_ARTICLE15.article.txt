# QUESTION SUBMITTED FOR U. S. C. DEBATE
## 
### 
"Rosolved, that the United States
Government should establish a corpora
tion for the employment of surplus la
bor in the construction of public works,"
is the question submitted by Stanford
to the University of Southern Califor
nia for the annual debate. Though no
formal approval has yet been received
from the southern university, Coach
McClintock expects it at any time, and
believes that prospective tryoutees may
do well to investigate this subject.
Debating teams from the University
of Southern California have an unusual
record in the winning of forensic con
tests, and there is consequently much in
terest in developing a Stanford team
which can win from them.
