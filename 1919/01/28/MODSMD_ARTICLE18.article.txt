# At Stanford 25 Years Ago

### 
Brilliant Affair at Olympic Club
Eleven out of the fifteen athletic
clubs composing the Pacific Associa
tion of the A. A. A. sent representa
tives to the convention held in San
Francisco last evening. The object of
the convention was the adoption of a
constitution to be submitted to the
A. A. A. for approval, and the award
ing of the medal won at the the last
championship meet, Oct. 14, 1893.
After considerable changing, the
constitution, which is posted on the
Quad bulletin board, was finally adopt
ed. The U. C. and Stanford represen
tatives were voted down in their at
tempt to exclude professionals from
becoming officers in any club of the
association. Stanford was represent
ed by Maynard, Rice, and Cox, as del
egates to the convention.
Dr. Elliott gives the total registra
tion for the year as 953; for this
semester 837. â€” (D. P. A., January 26,
1894.)
