# GREENLEAF PLAYERS WILL ACT HERE
## HIGH DRAMATIC TYPE Music and Dancing Parts Are Cleverly Combined With Simple Art 
### 
Tickets for the program to be given
by the Greenleaf Players in the Assembly
11 rill Friday night were placed on sale
today at the Stanford Bookstore and at
Robinson and Grandad's in Palo Alto.
.Mr. and Mrs. Armlield, the leaders of
the Greenleaf Players, have a clearly
defined ideal, the evolution of a distinctly
American drama which will unify world
traditions. They desire to combine the
simplicity of the old Troubadour produc
tions with the highest art of the modern
age and to perfect a form of drama
suitable for the home. This differs from
many of the modern movements hi
drama and literature, in that the sole
aim is not "to be different."
Any art to be complete must appeal to
all of the senses, the directors believe.
Consequently they have embodied music
and dancing, as well as speaking, in
their plays. To give charm and simplicity
in the setting, the Aritifields carry their
own hand-embroidered curtains, which
lend an exquisite blending of color.
Mr. Armfield is well-known to Cali
forniatis as an artist as well as an actor.
Many of his paintings were on exhibit
at the Panama Pacific International
Exposition.
The prices of the tickets arc $1, 75c
and 50c.
