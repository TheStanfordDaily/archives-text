# Chappie Writhes in Toils of the Censorship!!!
## 
### 
A little word, inoffensive enough to
some, but liable to misinterpretation by
others, was seized upon by Chaparral's
own Committee on Construction yester
day evening just as the book was ready
to come out. As a result, the members
of the "Chappie" staff have been labor
ing night and day in an effort to expur
gate the offensive wordlet from their
"Glad Hand" edition.
When "Chappie" appears tomorrow lie
will be one hundred percent pure, the
product of contented funsmiths, one
thousand feet above sea level. "Chap
pie," with his modest constructive pol
icy, is guaranteed to pass the strictest
censorship in the world without re
proach.
If the painstaking Construction Com
mittee does not find some other expres
sion that might give "Chappie's" readers
a wrong conception of its true purpose,
its appearance on Quad at 25 cents a
copy is assured.
