## 
### 
| Professor Frank P. McKibben lias |
j been granted permission by the 1919
! Quad management to take certain pic
j tures to he used in the yearbook as sub
jects for his lantern-slide lectures, ac
cording to a statement issued today. A
majority of the pictures are service or
jS. A. T. C. snap-shots. The Quad de
j partment in charge has an unusually
1 large collection of typical pictures taken
[ while the military authorities were in
full control at Stanford, illustrating,
j very accurately, it is said, the peculiari-1
j ties of such a regime.
Professor McKibben's lectures are to
Ihe given tirst at* Lehigh University.
I Though they include views of military
! control from other universities, the 1919
I year-book collectors will furnish pro-
I portionallv large contribution, the man
j agement asserts.
The management also points out and
| urges that it is imperative that all
! juniors who have not done so should I
j have photographs taken at "Pop"
| Franklin's at once. No junior, fratern
ity group or organization pictures will
I be taken for the Quad after February 1.
The management believes that sufficient
publicity has been given this time limit,
and that a fair arrangement has been
I made for organizations which cannot
| pay for reservations immediately, in per
| mitting them to reserve the space now,
I take pictures at once, and pay later.
