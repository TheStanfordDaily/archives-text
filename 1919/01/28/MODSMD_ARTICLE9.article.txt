# Dr. Jordan Gives Views on 14 Points
## "Wilson Acted Wisely in Going to Europe," Says Chancellor 
### 
"President Wilson acted wisely both j
in going to Europe to open peace dis-j
cussions and in addressing the confer-]
ence as he did."
This statement was made by Dr.!
David Starr Jordan to a representative'
of the Daily Palo Alto last night in a
discussion of the President's aims and
views of the League of Nations pre
sented at the Paris meeting on Janu
ary 25.
Dr. Jordan believes that the Presi-'
dent's wisdom is again displayed in his |
continued use of general terms to bring j
his ideas on the league to the attention
of the conference delegates. It would
be good policy for Mr. Wilson to make!
explicit declarations of principle for the I
leaders at the conference to follow. The'
definite ideas will be formed as the con
gress progresses.
Dr. Jordan gave as a side light some
of his own views of the immortal Four
teen Points, interpreting the clauses j
which have caused such widespread dis
cussion. By open diplomacy, the Presi
dent meant that agreements made be- j
tween nations should always be made |
public once they have been established, j
It did not mean that every word or ex-;
change of thought made in the confer
ence should be disclosed.
Regarding the principle of self-deter
mination of peoples, he cited a case
which he had in mind which by race and !
tradition has always belonged to Tyrol. |
It is a portion of Switzerland just south j
of Lake Constance. This section de
sires to incorporate under the laws and
government of Tyrol. It is an example
of the principle that small countries may
transfer allegiance to another country
where it is the will of the inhabitants,
he said.
Great Britain's idea of freedom of the 1
seas is one in which the nation reserves
the right of maintaining a police protec- i
tion for its colonial interests. Ger- j
many's idea is to have a large enough
navy to swallow up '.he British.
By a few examples chosen at random,
Dr. Jordan explained how the league
will work in practice, particularly in re
gard to nationality and trade inter
course. "There must be a smoothing off
of the rough edges of nationalism," he
said.
In answer to a question as to the feasi
bility of a federation of Europe at this
time, he said: "The united states of
Europe should not be formed until the
League of Nations is in full swing. Just
at present serious reactions would fol
low its establishment. Such a federation
would be a good thing for all concerned.!
It would deal mainly with trade and
transportation problems. One of the |
constant sources of friction between
Germany and Russia was the high tariff
which the kaiser placed on wheat. The)
free nations of Europe must be permit
ted to trade freely with one another.
Regarding the attitude of neutral na
tions which fear their exclusion from
peace discussions. Dr. Jordan said:
"There are no neutral nations now.
Sweden and Spain were neutral during
the war, but their rulers supported Ger
j many while their people favored the Al-
I lies. The small nations are to partici
! pate in the formation of the League of
J Nations. It cannot be expected that
| they will take as important a part at the
i peace table as the actual participants."
Dr. Jordan has made a great many
prophecies which have come true, and,
as he says, a great many which haven't
been so good. He foresaw the collapse
of Bulgaria, Turkey and Austria-
Hungary, but he did not expect Germany
to collapse so soon. It will take some
time for Germany to establish a stable
government he said, since Germany has
to learn to govern herself. There has
never been an honest-to-goodness elec
tion in Germany and when that time
comes there will be a different country
to deal with."
