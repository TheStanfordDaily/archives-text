Notice to Depositors
As a depositor of this Bank you are inter
ested, and entitled to know, the safeguards
we have adopted for the protection of your
funds.
First—We have been established for 14
years, and are an incorporated State Savings
and Commercial Bank, operating under the
Strongest State Bank Law of any State in the
United States, and are subject to most care
ful scrutiny and rigid examinations of the
State Banking Department.
Second —The State Bank Law is incompara
bly stronger than the National Bank uw,
especially so far as Savings deposits are con
cerned. It is a new law drawn by the late
Gov. Johnson progressive legislature, and mod
eled after the New York and Massachusetts
Savings Bank Laws, with many safeguards
added. The public is not yet generally aware
of its protective features. Under its rules, our
Savings Bank must secure with collateral, your
deposits, when loaning its funds, the law spe
cifically defining the security we must take.
No such provision exists cither in the Na
tional or Commercial Bank laws. Thus the
word Savings printed on our advertising and
stationery means Security to you.
Third—All our Cash on hand is fully in
sured against Burglary and hold up, so that
this Bank in case of robbery could not lose.
But in addition to this we carry two bottles
of high-powered chemicals in our safe, which
any explosion would break and the fumes
would prevent the criminals from securing the
money.
Fourth—Our Officers, who have the custody
of the Bank's funds, arc all bonded in the
American Surety Co. of New York, so that
the Bank is protected against possible loss both
from within and without.
Fifth —Our buildings and fixtures are all
adequately protected against fire, and we also
carry Employers' liability and compensation
insurance on our employes.
Sixth—Our vaults are modern and fireproof,
and our money safes arc equipped with the
best three-clock time locks.
Seventh—Our loans are all approved by a
conservative Finance Committee before they
are made, and all Real Estate must be ap
praised at twicc the value of the amount loaned
on same.
Eighth—Our Bank has $50,000.00 Capital,
an amount greater in proportion to its deposit
liability than any other bank in Santa Clara
County.
Ninth—We arc members of the American
Bankers Association and also the California
State Hankers Association, which gives us
additional protection, as well as the paid serv
ices of the Burns National Detective Agency
to run down any criminals operating against
us.
Tenth—Any statement contained herein can
be verified by addressing the State Superin
tendent of Banks, San Francisco, to whom we
respectfully refer.
Eleventh—All banks do not guard their de- !
positors with the same safeguards The Stan
ford Bank does. Are you doing all your busi
ness with us? Or part of it with some bank
which docs not protect you so adequately?
Your money on deposit with us is as safe as
though invested in a Government Bond.

Commctcial and Savings
PALO ALIO AM) MAYFIELD ,
Notice to Depositors
As a depositor of this Bank you are inter
ested, and entitled to know, the safeguards
we have adopted for the protection of your
funds.
First—We have been established for 14
years, and are an incorporated State Savings
and Commercial Bank, operating under the
Strongest State Bank Law of any State in the
United States, and are subject to most care
ful scrutiny and rigid examinations of the
State Banking Department.
Second —The State Bank Law is incompara
bly stronger than the National Bank uw,
especially so far as Savings deposits are con
cerned. It is a new law drawn by the late
Gov. Johnson progressive legislature, and mod
eled after the New York and Massachusetts
Savings Bank Laws, with many safeguards
added. The public is not yet generally aware
of its protective features. Under its rules, our
Savings Bank must secure with collateral, your
deposits, when loaning its funds, the law spe
cifically defining the security we must take.
No such provision exists cither in the Na
tional or Commercial Bank laws. Thus the
word Savings printed on our advertising and
stationery means Security to you.
Third—All our Cash on hand is fully in
sured against Burglary and hold up, so that
this Bank in case of robbery could not lose.
But in addition to this we carry two bottles
of high-powered chemicals in our safe, which
any explosion would break and the fumes
would prevent the criminals from securing the
money.
Fourth—Our Officers, who have the custody
of the Bank's funds, arc all bonded in the
American Surety Co. of New York, so that
the Bank is protected against possible loss both
from within and without.
