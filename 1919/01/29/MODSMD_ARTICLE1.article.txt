# WOMEN'S WAR HOARD ASSUMES WORK OF LANE CLINIC
## CONFUSION ARISES AS TO JURISDICTION Future War Work Becomes Issue Between Y.W.C.A. and Conference

be taken over by the Y. W. C. A., the
only alternative which was offered was
that the president of the Associated
Women Students appoint another or-j

War Board to handle the activities

board Monday night.

are two organizations on the campus
which assume the right to carry on
these activities. According to Miss
Margaret Shedd, '20. chairman of the
Women's War Board, the distinction
