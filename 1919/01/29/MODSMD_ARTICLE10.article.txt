# WRESTLING ARTISTS ROUND INTO SHAPE
## 
### 
Chances for the new enthusiasts in
the Stanford wrestling world to make
a place on the '19 team are exceeding
ly good, both from the fact that very
few of last year's wrestlers have re
turned to college this quarter and that
the wrestling activity will undoubtedly
broaden its scope of work this year,
under the able instruction of Coach
Jones.
Novice tournaments will be held be
fore each of the big meets this year,
giving all the men in the sport a suf
ficient opportunity to display their
ability in wrestling. Material for a
team will then be chosen and quickly
rounded into shape.
Among the old veterans back to bat
tle for the Red and Â»\Vhite are Lind,
Egami, Fenlason and Kakimoto, all of
whom are 100 per cent men in the
activity. Fugi, last year's team star,
will not be back 011 the mat this
spring, due to a severe attack of the
tine. S. Yamate, who is skilled in jiu
.iitsu, will strengthen the wrestling
line-up, however.
The various weight classes that will
bo chosen are 105 pounds and under,
115, 125, 135, 145, 158, 175 pounds and
[under, and the unlimited class. To
date the men who have shown up for
the activity are averaging middle
weight.
