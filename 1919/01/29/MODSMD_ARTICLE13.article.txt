# WOUNDED SOLDIERS TO RECEIVE CHEER
## Stanford Women to Provide Comforts for Men at Base Hospital 
### 
The Stanford "500'' have volun
teered to send cheer and comfort to
the convalescing soldiers of Camp
Fremont, and committees with such a
purpose in view have already been or
ganized with Miss Henrietta Dickey,
'20, as chairman.
Many of the soldiers at Fremont,
have just returned from overseas, and
they are more or less depressed, due
to their wounded condition. It. will
lie the aim of the women to send boxes
of fruit and home-made cooking to the
different wards, and also to furnish
them with magazines and scrapbooks.
Every week several women will go to
tlie Red Cross rooms at the camp and
will there help entertain the men.
A meeting of the committee was
held last night and it was decided that
this week food would be sent by three
of the houses, Kappa Kappa Gamma,
Kappa Alpha Theta and Pi Beta Phi.
The Alpha Omicron Pis and the
Sigma Kappas have been asked to
supply the wards with flowers and
greens, while the Delta Gamma house,
Alpha Phi, Chi Omega and Gamma Phi
will furnish reading material. All
these provisions are to be left in the
locker room of the Women's Club
House by 2 o'clock of Friday after
noon. when they will immediately be
sent, over to the camp. Contributions
fr, in other sources should be left in
the same place.
lloble Club and members of the Tri
Delta House are planning some forms
of entertainment for the men and will
spend Sunday at the camp.
