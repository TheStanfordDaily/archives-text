It is reported that the referees of the California-Nevada basketball league
have protested against the unfair tactics of the spectators in nagging opposing
teams at the games, and this protest is supposed tu refer to Stanford as much
as any other institution.
To charge Stanford with unsportsmanlike tactics is to raise instant protest,
for clean sportsmanship is perhaps the one quality above all others upon which
the University has always prided itself. Probably what the referees mistook for
intentional hampering of the opposing teams was merely a little unrestrained
enthusiasm, mixed with what was intended to be only good-natured chaffing.
If the student body had thought it was anything else, public sentiment would
not have stood for such conduct.
Bt'it the referees and the opposing team are not apt to weigh the intent of
the spectators very careiully, and are likely to judge by appearances. So lets
confine the noise down at the gym after this to giving the proper amount of noise
at the proper times to the Cardinal quintet, with now and then a word or a hand
for the other fellow.
