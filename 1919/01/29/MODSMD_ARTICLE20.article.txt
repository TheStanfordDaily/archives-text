Boxing Class Holding

A schedule of boxing tournaments
has not been arranged as yet, but it is
thought that within a week a list of
meets can be published. In the mean
time the boxing classes are working
into fighting trim, and putting every
effort into bringing out some promising
material for the team which will meet
the S. F. Olympic Club in one of the
first tournaments of the year. The men
from the city will no doubt be a picked
crew and will give the Stanford boxers
a speedy tournament.
There will be a change in the line
up for the Stanford-Olympic Club meet
over the tournament of last year. In
stead of supporting representatives
from all the different weights on the
team, there will be men picked from
only several of the weight classes.
This plan will no doubt limit the team
to fewer men, but at the same time it
will put forth those men who are the
best skilled in the boxing game.
