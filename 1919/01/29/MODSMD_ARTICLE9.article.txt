# PHYSICAL EDUCATION IS LECTURE SUBJECT
## C. W. Hetherington Explained Relation of Training to War Problems 
### 
"Physical Education and the War"
was the theme of a lecture given by
j Clark W. Hetherington, '95, state su
pervisor of physical education, at the
Little Theater last night.
"Children have forgotten how to
play," said Mr. Hetherington. "The
old-fashioned, vigorous life of our
grandparents has been narrowed into
a cramped city existence and we must
| find a fitting substitute for the old
freedom, if our boys and girls are to
grow into efficient citizens." The re
sult of the neglect of the physical de
velopment of children was not realized
until the recent war brought to light
the fact that 33 per cent of our young
manhood was unfit for military serv
ice, and that over 90 per cent of this
unfitness was due to negligence, the
speaker went on to explain. Now that
the public has been aroused to the im
portance of physical training, means
of supplying the deficiency are being
worked out. The plan which is at
present being circulated under Mr.
Hetherington's supervision is one of
devoting a certain amount of time
daily to teaching children games and
"stunts" which they may carry on out
side of school hours. The old despised
forms of gymnastics are disappearing
to a great extent, to be supplanted by
the new and attractive games. It is
Mr. Hetherington's desire to get public,
opinion effectively behind his plan so
that he may be able to carry it to a
successful culmination.
