# TRACK PRACTICE WILL START SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 1
## GOOD SEASON EXPECTED Wealth of Material Is Outâ€”Prospects for Another Victory Over U.C. 
### 
By L. W. Dinkelspiel, '20.
With the announcement that track
workouts will start Saturday, February
1, early winter dopesters are beginning
their annual task of sizing up the pros
pects. That there is a constantly in
creasing wealth of track material on
the Farm there is no doubt, but whether
this material will be in sufficient shape
to make it seven straight wins from the
Bears is another question.
With Rugby added to the lists of
spring sports, Stanford athletes who in
dulge in more than one form of Varsity
competition will be forced to decide
whether or not they will appear in the
Cardinal track jersey. The task of the
dopester is correspondingly complicated
with the problem of "who will be in
which" sport.
Captain Cracky Teitsworth, '19, will
be in actual charge of the squad, with
Coach Evans on hand to lend the need
ed guidance. Reg Caughey, captain
elect 1918, will be around the oval to
aid in coaching the weight men and to
bring home his five points in the shot
put.
Merlin Maynard, '20, sensational
quarter-miler, will appear in his favorite
event throughout the season and is al
ready working out on the cinders. Mil
ler, a transfer from the Ohio state,
comes to Stanford with a splendid repu
tation as a sprinter and quarter-miler,
and can he expected to show consider
able stuff. Rob Pelouze will probably
run with these boys in the quarter.
The sprints are uncertain, with the
exception of Ken Lilly, '19, whose re
markable feat of winning the century
in fast time after a strenuous game last
year has stamped him as a track man
of exceptional ability.
Juss Wells, '20, star of his freshman
team, will considerably strengthen the
