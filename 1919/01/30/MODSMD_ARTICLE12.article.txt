# VARSITY FIVE DEFEATS SAN JOSE Y.M.C.A. 36 TO 31
## 1922 HAS GOOD TEAM Game With Davis Saturday Night to Be Played On Stanford Court 
### 
Stanford Varsity quintet added an
other victory to her list last night when
the San Jose Y. M. C. A. team went
down to defeat before the red-shirted
players to the tune of 36 to 31. Al
though tlie score was close, the Varsity
showed a superior brand of basketball
and teamwork at all times during the
game.
The contest started off with a bang
and the Cardinals were able to score
ten points before the San Jose players
got their bearings. The referee allowed
the game to g'et rather rough during the
remainder of the first half, and although
the Varsity played their usual brand of
clean teamwork, the half ended 20 to 18
with the Y. M. C. A. in the lead.
Stanford came back in the second
round and completely outplayed the San
Jose aggregation, making 18 points to
their opponents' 11.
"Bobbie" Pelouze showed that one of
the Varsity's weak points had been im
proved last night when he dropped ten
free goals through the ring out of eleven
chances. Pelouze also had four field
goals to his credit.
Johannsen played at forward during
the first part of the game and dropped
two field goals through the ring. Buck
lin and Fairchilds worked out forward
during the latter part of the game. This
is the first time that Evans has used
these men in a game, but he was well
pleased with their showing. Hood
played at forward during the second
half.
"Swede" Righter, who was elected
captain before the game, had the mis
fortune to sprain an ankle during the
contest, but was able to go back into the
game. The sprain will not keep him out
of the game Saturday. Righter played
his usual brand of basketball last night
and had four goals to his credit.
Coughey, Williamson and Lilly did
good work for the Varsity in the de
fensive end of the court.
Student Manager Ames has succeed
ed in making arrangements with Davis
State farm to play the first game of the
intercollegiate series here Saturday
evening instead of at Davis. A fresh
man game will he arranged at that time,
if possible, so that local fans can see
both teams in action at the same time.
The freshman basketball season will
open' tonight with a game with Palo
Alto high school, at 7 :30 o'clock, in the
Encina gymnasium. The babes will go
up against the Lowell High quintet to
morrow night.
Palo Alto lias already been defeated
by the freshmen in two practice games
this season. The high school team has
been strengthened by the addition of
several new-players, so the game tonight
will give the frosh a strong fight.
Twenty-five men are out for the
squad, and according to the announce
ment made by Coach Evans this morn
ing, ten of these men would constitute
the squad that will go up against the
U. C. freshman team.
Those that will start in the game to
night will be Davies and Mead, for

February.
