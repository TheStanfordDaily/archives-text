# VARSITY FIVE DEFEATS SAN JOSE Y.M.C.A. 36 TO 31
## 1922 HAS GOOD TEAM Game With Davis Saturday Night to Be Played On Stanford Court 
### 
Stanford Varsity quintet added an
other victory to her list last night when
the San Jose Y. M. C. A. team went
down to defeat before the red-shirted
players to the tune of 36 to 31. Al
though tlie score was close, the Varsity
showed a superior brand of basketball
and teamwork at all times during the
game.
The contest started off with a bang
and the Cardinals were able to score
ten points before the San Jose players
got their bearings. The referee allowed
the game to g'et rather rough during the
remainder of the first half, and although
the Varsity played their usual brand of
clean teamwork, the half ended 20 to 18
with the Y. M. C. A. in the lead.
Stanford came back in the second
round and completely outplayed the San
Jose aggregation, making 18 points to
their opponents' 11.
"Bobbie" Pelouze showed that one of
the Varsity's weak points had been im
proved last night when he dropped ten
free goals through the ring out of eleven
chances. Pelouze also had four field
goals to his credit.
Johannsen played at forward during
the first part of the game and dropped
two field goals through the ring. Buck
lin and Fairchilds worked out forward
during the latter part of the game. This
is the first time that Evans has used
these men in a game, but he was well
pleased with their showing. Hood
