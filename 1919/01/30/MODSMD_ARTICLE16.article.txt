# THE 						STAFF

Today's announcement of the staff of the Daily Palo Alto marks the end
of the war period in Stanford journalism. During the existence of the S. A. T. C.
the Daily was forced to struggle with a makeshift organization and a staff too
small to adequately cover the University news. Great credit is due to the war
staff, composed principally of women, for their untiring efforts when the big
fight was to get out a paper at all. But now conditions have reverted to normal,
and the Daily is able to return to its pre-war status, and to welcome back to
news-gathering ranks those who have laid aside the sword for the typewriter.
The staff is headed, as in former years, by five news editors, H. G. Swendsen,
'20; L. W. Dinkelspiel, '20; Miss Ruth Scarcy, '20; C. E. Randall, '20, and Miss
Ruth Lakin, '19. All five have had previous news-editing experience, and it is a
real pleasure to be able to announce the return of Swendsen, who was elected last
year for the present editorial term, but was forced to resign when his duties as
first sergeant of Company A prevented his holding office, Dinkelspiel, who returns
to Stanford from his position as S. A. T. C. instructor at the University of Cali
fornia, and Randall, a member of the local naval unit.
J. E. Thrash, '21; E. E. Crowe, *21; J. W. Bucklin, '20; B. F. Sharp, '21;
H. F. Ormsby, '20; S. P. Hollingsworth; Miss Jean Frickleton, '20, and A. I.
Townsend, '21, have returned to the reportorial staff from absences of varying
lengths, and R. W. Kenny, '21; Miss Ellen Calhoun, '20; Miss Ruth Elsinger, '20;
Miss Thelma Carlisle, '20; J. W. Rhodes, '22; R. L. Wiel, '22; C. W. Jenks, '22;
Miss Margaret McCall, '21; Miss Florence Hocking, '22; Miss Mildred Thomp
son, '21; Miss Margaret McElin, '19, and Miss Evelyn Gore, '22, who have been
on the staff last quarter, will continue their work this quarter. It is with deep
regret that the announcement of the resignation of Miss Eleanor Allen, '20; Miss
Dorothy Plummer, '19, and Miss Lucy Langdon, '19, due to overcrowded scholas
tic schedules, is recorded.
At the end of the usual tryout period, the Daily takes pride in the announce
ment of the addition of nine new names. The journalistic freshmen are: W. F.
Leiser, '21, of Twin Falls, Idaho; R. D. Campbell, '22, of San Jose; Miss Clytie
Sweet, '21, of Palo Alto; F. S. Reeder, '22, of Fresno; Miss Helen Stote, '21, of
Colorado Springs, Colo.; G. Chamberlain, '22, of Salt Lake City, Utah; Miss
Olive Brooking, '22, of San Francisco; U. S. Thalheimer, '22, of Phoenix, Ariz.,
and Miss Bernice Frankenheimer, '20, of Stockton.
Present plans call for the enlargement of the scope of the Daily in the not
distant future. With such a staff, these plans should be easily carried out.
