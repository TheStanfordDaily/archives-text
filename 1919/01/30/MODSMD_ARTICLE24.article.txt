# ABOUT STANFORD
## THE 						INNER QUAD 
### 
I iithc early clays of Stanford, before
the inner quadrangle was bisected by the
wide cement walks and before the gravel
was laid, bicycles were stacked two and
three deep along the arcades. Students
awheel and afoot hurried about to and
from their classrooms in all directions,
or sat hobnobbing on the low stone curb
ing of the big circular flower-beds, while
others occupied chairs set under the tall
shrubs inside.
The court was originally covered with
asphaltum, but afterwards it was
thought best to cover it with course
gravel. The Inner Quadrangle is 586
feet in length by 246 feet in width.
The Camp
When the first University buildings
were in course of construction, two long
rough one-story wooden structures, at
right angles to each other were run up
to accommodate the workmen. They
were located on the present site of the
Electrical Engineering building. When
the work was over these were vacated
by the men ajjd were taken possession of
by a number of students who had small

allowances, or who wanted to work their
way through college. There was always
a student in charge of the place, who
was responsible for the order, cleanliness
and so on, and the room rent was paid
to him. A Chinaman kept a restaurant
where good, plain meals could be had
cheap, and there were eating clubs there
too, sometimes, ut a good many of the
l>oys "batched"—two in a room usually—
and they managed the cooking between
them.
The story is told that the first cam
pus eating club was run by two
brothers, students in the University.
They soon became famed for the
abundant table which they set Chicken,
squab and pheasants were often on their
bill-of-fare. It finally became known
that while one brother managed the
kitchen, the other one went out each
night and visited the neighboring farms.
Some of the most prominent fellows
in college were camp men. It was an
institution particular to Stanford Uni
versity, and it would, perhaps, have been
possible nowhere else. The buildings
were torn down in 1897.
