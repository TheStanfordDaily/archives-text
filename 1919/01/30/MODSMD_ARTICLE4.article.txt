Prospects for a speedy swimming
meet between the Varsity and the
Freshmen to-morrow afternoon at the
Encina plunge are very good, due to
the large number of men who have sign
ed up for the various events. To date
16 freshmen and 26 varsity men have
signed up with Coacli Brandstein. Many
new stars iti the Stanford swimming
world, as well as a number of the
older team men, will make the contest a
particularly interesting one. According to
Coach Brandstein who has been putting
the some of tryoutees through a rigid
course of training .the Freshmen stand
good chances to pull down first honors.

the meet, the lineup for the same being

No regular swimming meet will be

school will probably meet the locals the
following week on borne territory. Fol
lowing this a schedule of meets will
probably be arranged with Lick high
in San Francisco, Olympic Club, Peid
mont Club, San Jose high, Concordea
Club of San Francisco, and a meet with
the socalled "Old Star High School"
team, also of San Francisco. The latter
consists of two of the best men from
each of the high schools of that city.
Chances fur winnfng the California;
swim are considered good by local fans.
However, it is the opinion that the!
Blue and Gold has a speedy freshman!
team, due to the addition to their mini-1
her of one star sprinter and one holder
of the Coast Championship. Stanford's i
varsity team is this year coming along
in splendid shape. With the team work
of Mills, the mainstay of the team in the
100 yards and 220 yards, Goddard in
diving, Mills and Newman in the plunge,
and Winham, last year's captain, the
team from the farm should have an easy
time running off with all honors.
