# A 						RUGBY PRACTICE IS SCHEDULED FOR TONIGHT
## MANY OLD STARS BACK Prospects for Winning in California Game Are Bright 
### 
Rugby practice will commence tomor
row night, when all candidates for the
fifteen which will battle against Cali
fornia show up on the football field.
No coach will be on hand for the First
workout, but in a few days the Board
of Athletic Control expects to have
Peter Flanagan, who handled the S. A.
T. C. team, or some other good rugby
man out to help the players. '
If the men in college eligible for the
fifteen turn out, one of the best varsi
ties ever seen around the "Farm" will
develop. For forwards there are Henry,
from the last year's freshman team, at
front rank; Howell, a star from Santa
Clara, who will probably be eligible for
the same position; and for the rest of
the positions in the pack there are Flood,
Watts, Clark, Wallace. Patrick, Meyer,
Cochrane, Curtise, Williamson, Righter
and Adams. Flood, Curtise, William
son, Righter and Adams were on the
Varsity last year. These men alone
would form a pack that would be as
good as those in former years. Curtise
is a crack front-ranker. Flood and
Adams at side rank are heavy, fast and
are fighters to the last ditch. William
son is an excellent candidate for lock,
while Righter is almost a Pettingill at
rear rank.
However. Clark. Wallace and Patrick
from the 1921 fifteen will be in the bat
tle strong, while Meyer and Cochrane
are clever players.
In the backfield Doe will have no
competition for halfback. The remain
der of the places will be filled from the
following: Nagel, Sheldon, Long, Pe
louze, Falk, Scofield, Parker, Repath,
Lilly and Kenny. From this list men
can be picked who are strong as the
forwards. If Lilly plays first five, Cali
fornia will need several extra men to
hold him down. Such old stars as Pe
louze, Long, Falk and others will com
plete a powerful combination of backs.
