# PLAYLETS AND SONGS TO BE GIVEN TOMORROW
## Unique Entertainment to Be Offered by Players in Assembly Hall 
### 
The two plays, "The Grassblade" and
"Pierrot's Welcome," which the Green
leaf Theatre will preseni in Assem
bly Hall tomorrow evening at 8
o'clock, were written by the directors
Mr. and Mrs. Maxwell Armfleld.
Mrs. A. C. Huston, who saw these
plays given in La Holla last summer,
says that they were something dis
tinctly new in drama, highly fantastic
and romantic.
"Above all,' Mrs. Huston said, "the
plays were cheerful, the kind of
things that would be done if a com
munity got together to choose its own
entertainment. There is the difference,
of course, that these actors are ex
tremely well trained, not in any sense
amateurs.
"in between plays old English bal
lads, folksongs, and recitations were
given. The whole program was de
cidedly free from the artificialities of
stngn-arting, for throughout the play
ers were natural."
At La Holla the players carried out
their idea of getting on close, inti-
mate terms with the audience. Be- j
fore the program they ushered, wear
ing their naive and interesting cos
tumes.
Reserved seat tickets are on sale at
the Bookstore and at Robinson &!
