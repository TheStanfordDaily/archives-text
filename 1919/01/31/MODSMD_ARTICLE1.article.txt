# FORMER PRESIDET TAFT ASKED TO LECTURE HERE SOON
## MAY ADDRESS ASSEMBLY Former Ambassador Gerard and President Lowell of Harvard Also Invited 
### 
Every effort is being made by the
University authorities to obtain as
many as possible of the welllknown
men who are expected to attend the
conference on the League of Nations
in San Francisco during the early part
of February. Among these appear the
names of ex-President William H.
Taft, President Lowell of Harvard
University, and Ambassador Gerard,
author of "My Four Years in Ger
many," who did so much to expose
German propaganda through his ex
perience as German ambassador from
the United States in Berlin.
Invitations have been extended to
all three of these men to address uni
versity assemblies at any time which
may suit their convenience. President
Wilbur extended the invitation per
sonally in a wire to ex-President Taft
yesterday and the public exercise com
mittee expects to have some definite
information as to the possibility of
the assemblies within the next few
days.
In case more than one of these men
are available it has been recommend
ed that if necessary two assemblies
within the week be held owing to the
unusual opportunity to give the stu
dents of the University the chance to
hÂ«ar men of national importance in
the thought of the country as a whole.
The poor attendance evidenced last
ouarter has made the student assem
blies appear to be unappreciated by
the students of the University, accord
ing to Professor L. E. Bassett, chair
man of the public exercises commit
tee. The University is willing to ar
rangefor the student assemblies to
come at frequent intervals if the stu
dents themselves are willing to pat
ionize an institution in Stanford life
which should be one of the most im
portant features of the educational ad
vancement in the University.
