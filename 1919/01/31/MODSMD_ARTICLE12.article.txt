# CARDINAL QUINTET TO MEET DAVIS TEAM SATURDAY
## PELOUZE IS IMPROVING Varsity Will Play Santa Clara Tuesday for Second Game 
### 
Davis Farm School will play the Var
sity five tomorrow night at 7 o'clock in
F.ncina gym in the first game of the
California-Nevada Basketball League.
Phe Farm School contest was originally
scheduled to be played at Davis, but
Student Manager Ames has arranged
the game at Stanford since Santa Clara
is to meet the Cardinal on the local
court next Tuesday in what will be one
of the hardest battles of the season, and
Conch Evans does not wish to weaken
his team with a trip.
Registration certificates stamped with
the word "ticket" will admit to the Davis
game.
Since thf winner of the California-
N'evada League is decided on a per
centage basis, Stanford must win both
the Davis and Santa Clara contests if
she is to stay at the top of the league.
The Farm School five was not depleted
this year by the war, since all the play
ers last year were men who had just
entered college. As a result, an unusu
ally fast team has been turned out. The
visitors should cause no trouble for the
Stanford team, however, if the style of
play is put up that Coach Evans has
taught his men.
A big hole in the Varsity scoring ma
chine has been plugged since Pelouze
has found his basket-shooting eye. This
forward is one of the hardest fighters
on the team, but, due to an absence from
the court game for two years, he has
lost his ability to drop the ball in regu
larly. The game against the San Jose
Y. M. C. A. demonstrated the fact that
practice has brought back Pelouze's
ability, however, and he should give a
good account of himself from now on.
Probably most of the team will be
given a chance against the Davis five.
P-ucklin, Fairchilds and Johannsen put
ii]) a good fight against the San Jose
team, and unless the Davis combination
proves to be unusually strong they will
be used.
Hood will probably start the game at
forward with Pelouze. Captain Righter
will be at center, and the two guards
will be chosen from Lilly, Williamson
and Caughey.
