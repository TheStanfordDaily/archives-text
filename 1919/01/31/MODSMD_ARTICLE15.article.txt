President Lilly has appointed the committee to investigate student control,
but this should not have the effect of making the rest of the student body feel
that they are relieved of responsibility in the matter. A committee cannot work
to good advantage unless it has the hearty support of the organization backing
it—in this case the Associated Students. The committee, besides investigating
conditions elsewhere, will doubtless call meetings to sound out student sentiment
here; at any rate that is what it was formed for. These meetings must be well
attended, and a more than perfunctory interest shown.
For in drawing up plans for a future system of student control, problems will
have to be met which will necessitate careful treading and harmony of opinion
reached by threshing out of differences, not by glossing them over. A consider
able section of the faculty, and even a considerable section of the student body,
out of patience with the results of student government under the old system, will
view any step toward the resumption of such government with at least latent hos
tility. This faction will have to be convinced that the desire is for real student
government, and not merely another opportunity to break university rules with
impunity if the offenders are influential. A committee of seven, no matter how
representative, cannot do this; it must be done by the whole University.
