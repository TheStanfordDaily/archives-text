# UNIVERSITY HEADS FAVOR COMPULSORY MILITARY TRAINING
## 
### 
Over 350 colleges and universities
haverequested an R. O. T. C. unit and
have made application to the War
Department for the establishment of
a corps, according to a memorandum
issued by the committee on education
and special training. A majority of
the colleges are highly in favor of the
plan.
At a recent meeting of the Southern
California College Presidents, resolu
tions were adopted in favor of the R.
O. T. C. The resolution recommended
that the first two years of military
should be made compulsory and the
last two years elective. A commuta
tion of subsistence for members of
the basic course as well as the ad
vanced course was favored.
More than two hundred college
presidents and delegates in attendance
at a meeting of the Association of
American Agricultural Colleges and
Experimental Stations at Baltimore
adopted the following resolution in
favor of military training:
"That the colleges of this associa
tion, adhering to their long estab
lished practice, heartily support the
continuanceof military instruction in
thecolleges and urge the adequate pro
vision for carrying into effect the
principal features of General Orders
No. 49 under the authority of the Na

tional Defense Act of June 3, 1916.
Special emphasis will be laid on
physical training in the R. O. T. C.
Statistics compiled by draft boards
show that approximately 30 per cent
of the young men within the draft age
failed to qualify for full military duty.
It will be the work of the R. O. T. C.
to train men along both the physical
and military lines, and efficient in
struction will be given in both.
