# CALIFORNIA WILL NOT PUT OUT 1919 CREW
## 
### 
The University of California has de
cided to abandon the putting out of a
crew. Last year the Californians
dropped rowing, as the war made it im
perative. Graduate Manager Watson
said that the Blue and Gold had lost
about $3,000 yearly in putting out a
crew. The fact that the Blue and Gold
would have to obtain a paid coach was
also a factor, as they had previously had
a volunteer in that capacity.
The A. S. U. C. is to offer for sale
all shells, rowing machines, oars, and
the boathouse now standing on the Oak
land estuary. The University of Cali
fornia has had a crew in competition
since 1907.
