# Democracy Needed Says Dr. Jordan
## Ex-Chancellor Points Out the Weaknesses of Autocracy 
### 
"Autocracy or any other form of aris
tocratic government can never satisfy
the political needs of a people; democ
racy and democracy alone can fulfill
their demands," declared Dr. David
Starr Jordan yesterday evening in his
lecture on "Idealism and the Future De
mocracy" in the Stanford Assembly
Hall.
"Only through a democratic form of
government can a just and equitable
state be established," he continued.
T:i pointing out the various examples
of good and bad states, Dr. Jordan cited
the German Government. The failure
of the German state was due to the fact
that the fundamental principle was au
tocracy; a nation trained to have their
mode of living overseen by a central
group of statesmen cannot take an in
terest in their local affairs which a dem
ocratic people can do. This was an im
portant factor in the downfall of Ger
many
"The success of the United Stales is
a vivid example of what democracy can
do," said Dr. Jordan. "Only a free peo
ple can take a cause to heart and carry
it through, and democracy alone will
give them that necessary freedom."
Dr. Jordan's lecture is the first of a
series which will be given every other
Thursday night in the Assembly Hall
under the auspices of the Y. M. C. A.
The lectures are to be on the general
subject of democracy, and speakers will
be allowed considerable latitude in giv
ing their views. It is hoped that the
speakers' ideas will furnish ground for
argument in the "Y" discussion groups
which meet every week in the Hall and
on the Row.
