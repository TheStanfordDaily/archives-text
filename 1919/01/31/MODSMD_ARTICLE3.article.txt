# Date for '19-'20 Jolly-Up is Set For February 7
## 
### 
Friday, February 7th, the upperclass
jolly-up will be held at Encina Hall.
The junior-senior affair will commence
at 8:30.
The upperclass jolly-up will more
than fulfill all expectations for a good
dance. The senior committee, head
ed by C. S. Long, and the junior com
mittee, of which Selling Brill is chair
man, have met and are planning to
make this the biggest event on the
campus for some time to come.
To this end an excellent orchestra,
headed by Monk Antrim, will provide
the jazz music.
The feature of the dance will be the
frequent drawing of lottery tickets
during the evening, which will entitle
the holders to a "jolly-up special" at
Wilsons. Wilson's is planning a spe
cial concoction under this name which
promises to be entirely new.
The committee claims that the jazz
music, lottery tickets ,and other fea
tures to be announced later, will make
the affair most successful.
Fifty cents plus war tax will admit.
