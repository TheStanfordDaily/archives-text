## 
### 
Lieutenant James Adams, '16. after a
year and a half in the aviation service,
flying over German lines, and being cap
tured by Austrians, returned to the cam
pus last night. He was met at the train
by his father, Professor E. D. Adams,
head of the history department.
Adams was a law major at Stanford
and received his A. B. in 1916. The fol
lowing year he took up law at Harvard,
at the end of which year he entered the
aviation service. He belongs to Delta
Chi.
Adams was flying over the German
lines one morning, only 200 feet in the
air, photographing the enemy's trenches.
His photographer was injured, and later
found to have ten bullets in his body.
While making a dash for home,
Adams found his feet getting hot, and
upon investigation he found the ma
chine afire. He made a nose dive into
a swamp, and was immediately taken
prisoner by five Austrians and put in a
prison camp. At the signing of the
armistice he was released and sent home
through Switzerland.
