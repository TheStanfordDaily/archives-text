# RUGBY FIFTEEN HELD INITIAL WORKOUT LAST NIGHT
## PROSPECTS ARE BRIGHT Galloway Gives Promise of Developing Into Star Fullback 
### 
Anxious to get into shape for games
against the Blue and Gold, the varsity
Rugby hopefuls jumped the gun, and
turned out for a practice last night.
Even though the workout had not
been announced there was a large
turnout of good men for the fifteen.
A possible player to fill Teinpleton's
shoes at fullback was uncovered last
night when "Jim" Galloway, baseball
captain, turned out in a Rugby suit.
Galloway is a noted American football
player, but has not been out for the
fifteen-man game before. He is re
puted to be a hard tackier, and
showed last night that lie has a boot
to reckon with in any game.
There was a possibility that Doe
would have to be moved back from
halfback to full in order to plug up
the hole. Such a switch would con
siderably weaken the team, however,
and should Galloway be able to work
himself into a fullback, the team will
be 20 per cent stronger.
From now on the Ruggers will be
out on the turf every night. A coach
should arrive on the in the very
near future, and the battle for places
will begin.
California has been practicing for
some time in anticipation of a game
with the Cardinal. Although no names
are mentioned, the Blue and Gold fans
say they will have a team fully as
strong as any that can be turned out
here. Frank Boek, from Oakland
High School, a well-known Rugby man,
is coaching the Berkeley men, and is
bubbling over with confidence.
California's one wish in the world
at present seems to be to beat Stan
ford in everything. To that end
squads are being cut down and
coaches are working night and day.
