"I have noted the remarkable record
established by Evacuation Hospital No.
7 from June 15 to August 11, during
which time the largest number of pa
tients, battle casualties, that has yet re
ceived attention from a like unit in the
same length of time was cared for and
evacuated by hospital train or motor
transport.
"The hard work and tireless energy
of the enlisted men, . . . who during
times of greatest stress worked continu
ously, often without sleep and without
food, have resulted in saving many lives
and deserves the highest praise. Such
loyal and efficient service by medical
units directly contributes to winning the
victory, not only by saving the lives of
many men, but also by inspiring a confi
dence in your service which enables
them to brave the greatest dangers.
"I desire my appreciation of the serv
ices of your unit to be conveyed to each
member thereof who assisted in making
this enviable record."
The above letter was forwarded by
Lieutenant Colonel W. H. Tefft, who ac
companied it with the following mes
sage :
"I am more than pleased to have the
honor of forwarding you the above true
copy of commendation from the com

ditionary Forces, because T feel that the
earnest and loyal effort of S. S. U. No.
578 contributed largely to the success
of Evacuation Hospital No. 7 during
those days of stress.
"I would be glad if you would convey
the substance of this commendation to
each member of your unit, that they may
know that the effort put forth was not
unseen, or its result unfelt, and I take
this opportunity to express my personal
appreciation."
Lieutenant Berl, who was the officer
in charge, wrote the following-communi

U. No. 578, expressing his gratitude for
their loyal services:
"That your work has never been sur
passed in the enviable history of the
United States Army Ambulance Service,
T know. That it has not been equaled,
is my belief. I would not attempt to
hazard an estimate of the number of
American lives which have been saved
to our army and to their families be
cause of you. They have been surely
many, and if it has been unusually your
lot to do your duty without ostentation,
and without attracting the recognition
which could have been accorded you, the
fullest satisfaction of all will be found
in the realization of this.
"On the occasion of my leaving you, I
should like you to know how much I
have grown to love you as men, and how
highly honored I feel myself to be to
have served as your commanding of
ficer."

United States Army Ambulance Service,
T know. That it has not been equaled,

hazard an estimate of the number of
American lives which have been saved
to our army and to their families be
cause of you. They have been surely
many, and if it has been unusually your
lot to do your duty without ostentation,
and without attracting the recognition
which could have been accorded you, the
fullest satisfaction of all will be found
in the realization of this.

same length of time was cared for and
evacuated by hospital train or motor
transport.
"The hard work and tireless energy
of the enlisted men, . . . who during
times of greatest stress worked continu
ously, often without sleep and without
food, have resulted in saving many lives
and deserves the highest praise. Such
loyal and efficient service by medical
units directly contributes to winning the
victory, not only by saving the lives of
many men, but also by inspiring a confi
dence in your service which enables
them to brave the greatest dangers.
"I desire my appreciation of the serv

of Evacuation Hospital No. 7 during
those days of stress.
"I would be glad if you would convey
the substance of this commendation to
each member of your unit, that they may
know that the effort put forth was not
unseen, or its result unfelt, and I take
this opportunity to express my personal
appreciation."
Lieutenant Berl, who was the officer
in charge, wrote the following-communi
