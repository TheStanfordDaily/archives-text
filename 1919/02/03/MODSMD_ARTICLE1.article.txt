# STANFORD EASILY DEFEATS DAVIS QUINTET 55-5
## RIGHTER AGAIN STARS Coach Evans Expects Hard Fight Tomorrow Night With Santa Clara 
### 
Stanford's fighting varsity opened
the California-Nevada intercollegiate
basketball series with a burst of speed
and a brand of basketball of stellar
caliber when it defeated the Davis
State Farm quintet by the overwhelm
ing score of 55 to 5, at Encina gym
Saturday night. The visitors were so
far outclassed that only once were they
allowed to drop a field goal through
the ring.
Had Coach Evans kept in his best
men ,and pressed them to the limit
it is estimated that lliey could easily
have piled up seventy-five points
against the visitors, who showed a
lack of coaching and training.
The work of Captain Righter at
center stood out as the pre-eminent
feature of the game. The big center
was always in the right place and
succeeded in dropping twelve baskets
through the ring. Hood came next
with seven baskets to his credit, while
Pelouze rung in six.
Pelouze was not up to his usual
form in shooting free goals and only
made two out of six chances.
During the last half, Caughey at
guard, and Leiser and Esgen as for
wards, were worked into the game.
If their brand of basketball improves
as fast as it has the last few days.
Coach Evans will have at least three
sets of forwards to work in the series
against California.
The local five will fight one of the
hardest contests of the season tomor
row night .when they lock horns with
the Santa Clara quintet. Several old
time veterans have returned to
strengthen the ranks of the Mission
team, and the combination represent
ing the Red and White is beginning to
look like one of the best teams in the
entire league.
The game is scheduled to be held
at Encina gym and should draw an
unusual large crowd of fans, as it will
probably be one of the hardest fought
contests of the intercollegiate series.
It will be necessary for the Stanford
team to win every game if it is to re
tain a place at the top of the percent
age column among the teams of the
league.

ing the Red and White is beginning to
look like one of the best teams in the
entire league.
The game is scheduled to be held
at Encina gym and should draw an
unusual large crowd of fans, as it will
probably be one of the hardest fought
contests of the intercollegiate series.
It will be necessary for the Stanford
team to win every game if it is to re
tain a place at the top of the percent
age column among the teams of the
league.

Stanford's fighting varsity opened
the California-Nevada intercollegiate
basketball series with a burst of speed
and a brand of basketball of stellar
caliber when it defeated the Davis
State Farm quintet by the overwhelm
ing score of 55 to 5, at Encina gym
Saturday night. The visitors were so
far outclassed that only once were they
allowed to drop a field goal through
the ring.
Had Coach Evans kept in his best
men ,and pressed them to the limit
it is estimated that lliey could easily
have piled up seventy-five points
against the visitors, who showed a
lack of coaching and training.
The work of Captain Righter at
center stood out as the pre-eminent
feature of the game. The big center
was always in the right place and
succeeded in dropping twelve baskets
through the ring. Hood came next
with seven baskets to his credit, while
Pelouze rung in six.
Pelouze was not up to his usual
form in shooting free goals and only
made two out of six chances.
During the last half, Caughey at
guard, and Leiser and Esgen as for
wards, were worked into the game.
If their brand of basketball improves
as fast as it has the last few days.
Coach Evans will have at least three
sets of forwards to work in the series
against California.
The local five will fight one of the
hardest contests of the season tomor
row night .when they lock horns with
the Santa Clara quintet. Several old
time veterans have returned to
strengthen the ranks of the Mission
team, and the combination represent
ing the Red and White is beginning to
look like one of the best teams in the
entire league.
