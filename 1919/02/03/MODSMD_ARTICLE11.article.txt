Tomorrow is the last day on which
juniors may have photographs taken
for the 1920 year-book, according to
the management's statement that no
further extension of the time limit,
will be made. Fraternity, group, and
organization pictures, however, may
be taken until Friday of this week.
All organizations or groups who
have not yet returned negatives or
proofs of the pictures to "Pop" Frank
lin's, are requested to do so at once,
making their selection of the one to be
used in the Quad. It is also consid
ered important that such organizations
complete all the necessary business
arrangements with the manager of the
year book as soon as possible.
