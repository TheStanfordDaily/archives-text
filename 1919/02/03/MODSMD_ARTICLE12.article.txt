# STANFORD MEMORIAL IS PLAN PROPOSED BY COMMITTEE OF 50
## RECOGNITION OF SERVICE Co-operation to Make 1919 Commencement Week a Home-Coming Event 
### 
In recognition of war service ren
dered by Stanford men and women, and
to take action toward providing a per
manent memorial to the service and
sacrifice of Stanford—a memorial wor
thy of the high service and great sacri
fices, and commensurate in dignity and
importance with the greatness of the
event it commemorates, a committee of
fifty, composed of faculty and local
alumni and headed by Dr. J. M. Still
man, has been instituted by authority
of the President of the University to
mature and execute plans for such me
morial. When some plan has been ap
proved by this committee and endorsed
by the President and Trustees of the
I niversity, local campaign committees
will be established in all localities
where former Stanford students are
resident.
Some 3,000 of Stanford men wore the
uniform of army or navy in the war.
Hundreds of others—men and women,
faculty, alumni and students—were in
government service in various civilian
employments connected with the prose
cution of the war. More than 'sixty
have laid down their lives in field or
camp.
"It seems safe to predict," says Dr.
Stillman, judging by the attitude of
those who thus far have expressed a
sentiment that this campaign will call
for and should receive the most enthusi
astic support that lias been thus far
given to any Stanford enterprise. If
the memorial structure, whatever it may
be, is worthy of the event and the occa
sion, it should be something to com
mand respect and to do honor to the
University as to the service it commem
orates for all time. My own hope is
that as it commemorates high service,
this monument shall also be a thing of
service in itself. It is very manifest
that if this memorial is to be what it
should be, we shall need not only the
enthusiastic support of all Stanford peo
ple, hut of many friends of Stanford
or of the Stanford men and women who
so freely and gladly gave service and
even life at call of country and human
ity. We shall even hope that many upon
whom .Stanford University has no di
rect claim will help us because they re
spect and sympathize with our ambition
to make our memorial worthy of the
events it commemorates and the high
service to which it is to bear tribute."
While several ideas have been already
suggested by individuals, the first and
immediate business of the local commit
tee will be to consider the practicability
and desirability of plans that may be
suggested. When the committee has
agreed upon a plan which meets the ap
proval of the President of the Univer
sity and the Board of Trustees, then
will come the organization of all of
Stanford the world over to promote the
object desired.
Another object of the committee will
be to cooperate with the faculty com
mittee on public exercises and with the
executive committee of the Alumni As
sociation to make the commencement
week, next June, the greatest home-com
ing celebration of Stanford history—
that her sons and daughters from the
scattered fields of war service may re
ceive evidence of the pride, affection
and gratitude which their Alma Mater
feels for her returning crusaders.

have laid down their lives in field or
camp.
"It seems safe to predict," says Dr.
Stillman, judging by the attitude of
those who thus far have expressed a
sentiment that this campaign will call
for and should receive the most enthusi
astic support that lias been thus far
given to any Stanford enterprise. If
the memorial structure, whatever it may
be, is worthy of the event and the occa
sion, it should be something to com
mand respect and to do honor to the
University as to the service it commem
orates for all time. My own hope is
that as it commemorates high service,
this monument shall also be a thing of
service in itself. It is very manifest
that if this memorial is to be what it
should be, we shall need not only the
enthusiastic support of all Stanford peo
ple, hut of many friends of Stanford
or of the Stanford men and women who
so freely and gladly gave service and
even life at call of country and human
ity. We shall even hope that many upon
whom .Stanford University has no di
rect claim will help us because they re
spect and sympathize with our ambition
to make our memorial worthy of the
events it commemorates and the high
service to which it is to bear tribute."
While several ideas have been already
suggested by individuals, the first and
immediate business of the local commit
tee will be to consider the practicability
and desirability of plans that may be
suggested. When the committee has
agreed upon a plan which meets the ap
proval of the President of the Univer
sity and the Board of Trustees, then
will come the organization of all of
Stanford the world over to promote the
object desired.
Another object of the committee will
be to cooperate with the faculty com
mittee on public exercises and with the
executive committee of the Alumni As
sociation to make the commencement
week, next June, the greatest home-com
ing celebration of Stanford history—
that her sons and daughters from the
scattered fields of war service may re
ceive evidence of the pride, affection
and gratitude which their Alma Mater
feels for her returning crusaders.
In recognition of war service ren
dered by Stanford men and women, and
to take action toward providing a per
manent memorial to the service and
sacrifice of Stanford—a memorial wor
thy of the high service and great sacri
fices, and commensurate in dignity and
importance with the greatness of the
event it commemorates, a committee of
fifty, composed of faculty and local
alumni and headed by Dr. J. M. Still
man, has been instituted by authority
of the President of the University to
mature and execute plans for such me
morial. When some plan has been ap
proved by this committee and endorsed
by the President and Trustees of the
I niversity, local campaign committees
will be established in all localities
where former Stanford students are
resident.
Some 3,000 of Stanford men wore the
uniform of army or navy in the war.
Hundreds of others—men and women,
faculty, alumni and students—were in
government service in various civilian
employments connected with the prose
cution of the war. More than 'sixty
have laid down their lives in field or
camp.
