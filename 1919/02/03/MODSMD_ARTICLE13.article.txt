# Ganz Coming Here Direct From East
## Swiss Pianist Is Appearing Only Three Times in This Part of State 
### 
Rudolph Ganz, the great Swiss pianist
who will give a concert Friday night in
the Assembly Hall, is coming direct
from his triumphs in New York. Boston
and Chicago. He appeared in a recital
!in San Francisco yesterday which
I proved satisfying in every rcspcct. This
! concert, the Stanford concert and one
I which he will give in Oakland next
j Thursday, are the only performances
j \lr. Ganz is giving in this part of the
jstate.
Charles L. Wagner, the manager of
j Rudolph Ganz, in a personal letter to his
local manager, Frank VV. Healy, said
that in his opinion Mr. Ganz is without
a peer as a pianist. He states that Stan
ford may anticipate a sensational per
formance when the artist appears here
Friday evening. Mr. Wagner is also
manager for Galli-Curci, the greatest
i coloratura singer, and John McCor
j mack, the popular tenor.
The program arranged for Friday
j evening will he different from the one
which Mr. Ganz gave in San Francisco
yesterday.
