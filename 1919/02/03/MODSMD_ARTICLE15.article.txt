Basketball victories have aroused the old Stanford fighting spirit, and the
outlook for spring sports has never been more promising than now. All that
<o ot nroaQiit lacking to restore conditions to their former status is the definite
e as to what will be the University's policy in the future in regard
3 matters. Students are asking each other what is going to be done
mil, Rugby ,and crew, but those in authority maintain a policy that
_.ke a company of Sphinxes seem like a sewing-circle.
Will Stanford play American football next fall ,and with California? If
so, as a major or a minor sport? What will be the future of Rugby? Is there
any prospect of the resumption of crew? What basis, if any, is there for the
rumor that a faction of the powers that be is opposed to the resumption of
intercollegiate athletics? These questions are being asked repeatedly, and
answered never. The Board of Athletic Control was supposd to meet during
the Christmas vacation to decide the University's future athletic policy. Did
it meet ,and if, what did it decide?
Stanford students, those most vitally interested in the situation, are being
kept in the dark as to what is going to happen to Stanford athletics. If this
is necessary for the present, well and good, but the student body is at least
entitled to know why it is necessary.
