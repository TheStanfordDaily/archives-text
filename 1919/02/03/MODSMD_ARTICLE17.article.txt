# FROSH BEAT LOWELL HIGH TEAM 28 TO 25
## 
### 
The freshman quintet defeated the
Lowell high basket tossers 28 to 25 last
Friday night in the Encina gymnasium.
The game was so closely contested that
neither team was sure of the game until
the final whistle sounded. It was only
the perfect teamwork of the freshmen
that saved them from defeat.
Many of the weak points of the fresh
man team were brought out, and Coach
Evans is planning to give them special
attention this week. Those playing in
the game were: Austin, Reeder and
Larsen, guards; Gerson, center; Davies,
Meade and Neer, forwards.
