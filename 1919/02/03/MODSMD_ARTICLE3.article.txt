# Dramatic Wriggles of the New Drama
## 
### 
Dear Pa:
I sure saw some hair raisin' perform
ance last Friday night. I was feeling
kind of like the last of the Mohicigans
and so decided to invest a buck in pas
toral enjoyment. And hearing of some
"Famoux Players" who had learned
their art in some desolate part of the
earth, I decided to impart a little of
their drams into myself. This perform
ance they gave was supposed to be the
Evolution of the American drama, but
it seems a shame to blame it on Amer
ica. These works of art were also sup
posed to perfect a sort of drama suit
able for the home. And in that, pa,
they done well, for that kind of drama
ought to be for the home and it ought
to be kept there, with tlie doors locked
if necessary. These here players said
that their chief aim was "not to be dif
ferent," and by the looks of things I
should say tliey weren't different, but
nevertheless they weren't like anything
I ever saw before. Nother thing, Pa,
these here new fangled players said they
carried along some hand embroidered
scenery with charming blended colors.
Man, those were sure some scenery. In
one scene a couple of gunnysacks was
s'.uck up with sticks, and this was a
Japanese effect. In another scene in
which a heroine was_ supposed to be in
a tall castle, looking out of the window
a! her husband, the castle window was
a cider barrel on which was piled some
cotton battin'. Anyhow, Pa, this was
highly edifying and is an entirely new
kind of drama animal, and if it don't
die will go down to posterity, and they
will wonder what kind of creatures' vie
were. Goodnight, Pa, I got an ex to
morrow. HENRY.
