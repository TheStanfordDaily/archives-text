Rudolph Ganz, the great Swiss pianist,
who will give a recital at Assembly Hall,
Stanford, Friday evening, February 7,

W. Healy, is winning new admirers
with each performance.
Mr. Ganz, while en route west, stopped
off at Chicago to appear as soloist witli
the Chicago Symphony Orchestra,
where he played the two Liszt Con
certos. That he played them well is at
tested to unanimously and enthusiastic
ally by the Chicago public and critics.
The following press notices selected at
random will give some idea of the en
thusiasm aroused:
"Mr. Ganz has acquired a masterly
command of the mechanics of the piano,
in this respect making the mere dexter
ity of the virtuoso a secondary element
in his playing, ft is a certain bigness,
a ripe maturity, a musical setting forth
of the thoughts of the composer which
he projected in his playing yesterday
which places him among the foremost
pianists of our time. There was not
only brilliance, but imagination, emo
tional sway, and a singing of the melodi
ous passages in both concertos which,
while not a new pliase in the art. was
never so strongly accentuated or elab
orated before. He lias made the deeper,
more noble A major concerto particu
larly his own, and his interpretation of
it stands forth unrivalled. He was ac
corded a cordial reception by the audi
ence, which recalled him many times."—
Chicago Daily News.

of power that is stunning."—Chicago
