# RIVAL VARSITIES WILL TANGLE AT GYM TONIGHT
## PELOUZE MAY BE OUT Santa Clara Five Promises to Furnish Strong Competition 
### 
Santa Clara and Stanford will battle
for basketball supremacy in Encina
gymnasium tonight at 8 o'clock. Regis
tration certificates will admit free to the
game.
I he Red and White, stronger than
usual, is coming up determined to break
the string of basketball victories enjoyed
by the Cardinal. Since the Varsity and
Mission fives seem to be two of the
strongest, if not the strongest, teams
in the California-Nevada Basketball
League, tonight's game will have a big
influence on the league title
Bobbie Don, Scholz and Diaz form
the backbone of the Santa Clara com
bination. Don is known as one of the
best basketball men around the bay.
He played on the Olympic Club team,
and has been a power on the Santa
Clara five for several seasons. Scholz
is no less strong on the floor, while
Diaz, a slippery, fast man, will add con
siderable to the visitors' strength.
Stanford may be weakened by the loss
of Pelouze, at present the best forward
on the team. He injured his foot in
practice several nights ago. and may not
be able to get into the line-up. In audi
tion, Moulton is just recovering from a
sprained ankle, and will not be at his
best. The main forward work will thus
fall on Hood. Center will be taken care
of by Captain Righter, while Lilly and
Williamson, or Lilly and Caughey will
play the guard positions.
The Cardinal will have to depend on
Coach Evans' teamwork to win the
game tonight. Righter is, of course, at
his best, and with the guards going
strong, the loss of speed on the part of
the forwards will not be felt so strongly
as might be expected.
Santa Clara is bringing a big rooting
section up for the game tonight, deter
mined to help defeat the Cardinal.
