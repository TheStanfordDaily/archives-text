# THE 						SERVICE MEMORIAL
## 
### 
No amount of praise or recognition by the University can ever be adequate j
for the tnen and women, living and dead, who went from it to fight the fight of
America and democracy. The most magnificent memorial that could be erected
would not be a recompense for the sacrifices they have made. But that whatever,
we do will be inadequate should not prevent us from doing what we can. The!
campaign just started for a war memorial will meet with the hearty support of <
all, alumni and students, faculty and friends.
The University is extremely fortunate in having at the head of the memorial
committee Dr. Stillman, vice-president emeritus, whose name is intimately asso- j
ciated with the Stanford of the past and of the present. His expressed opinion
that the memorial should be something of service assures us that the structure,
whatever it is to be, will not be a mere perfunctory compliment to those it is in
tended to honor—not a meaningless ornament to attract the eye.
But could not the idea of service enter into the campaign for the erection of
the memorial? Mere money is a poor reward for blood. Stanford's tribute to
her war heroes would have a deeper significance if into its erection would go as
much as possible of service and as little as possible of unearned money.
