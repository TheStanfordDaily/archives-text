# NURSING URGED AS COLLEGE PROFESSION
## Public Health Nursing Is a Natural Growth of the Great War 
### 
A letter has been received in the I
President's office from Ella Phillips!
Crandall, executive secretary of the Na-|
tional Organization for Public Health!
Nursing, asking that the problem of
public health nursing be placed before I
the women of the University. This let- j
ter has been released by Miss Bradford!
and contains the following message:
In these times of reconstruction the ;
work in the devastated districts of the!
Allied countries and in the cantonments
here at home all points to the need of!
public nurses in the future. The work
of the army nurse has shown how much ;
more can he done when the services of'
the nurse are equally available in all
parts of the community. The public
health nurse stands for equal distribu-'
tion, according to need, of nursing care, i
and this means that the health of the j
community will greatly improve. Ac- 1
cording to Surgeon General Rupert
Blue, there should be at least one public
health nurse in each county, and for
this reason the women are asked to vol
unteer for this service as they did for
overseas work in the time of war.
A considerable sum of money has
been voted by the organization to be I
given as scholarships to nurses leaving'
military service and to nurses who have j
completed their courses and arc about'
to graduate, in order that they may take j
post-graduate courses in public health j
work. The National Organization, to-j
gether with the National League for
Nursing Education, urges a complete re
vision of training courses in hospitals
in order to make room for public health
work and to give credit for preparatory
courses taken in colleges and universi
ties. It is, in short, a profession for the
college trained women that is being of
fered, and for this reason the appeal is
made to the college student.
