ENCINA HALL
The hall, which was one of the first
buildings finished, was full when the
University opened in the fall of 1891.
It accommodated three hundred stu
dents. At first the men boarded in
the building, the dining room being on
the first floor and the kitchen in the j
basement, but this plan did not prove j
feasible and eating clubs were estalv
lished. All the men in the hall are j
entitled to belong to Encina Club; the j
dues pay for the magazines and enter
tainments. The name "Encina" means
oak.
At the time of the opening of the
University the nearest postoffice was ■
at Mayfield, and the mail was brought j
by private carrier from Menlo Park. |
There were only one or two houses in j

Palo Alto and only four trains a day,
and they had to be flagged.

The ourying ground of Senator
Stanford's famous trotters is still a
source of interest to many students
at the old stock farm. The monument
of the great Electioneer stands in the
center of the little enclosure where
so many of his illustrious descendants
lie buried; but his skeleton is set up
in the Museum. Electioneer died in
1890. By 1892 every trotting record in
the world was held by his sons and
daughters. Palo Alto, the Senator's
favorite, made the stallion trotting
record to a high-wheeled sulky of
2:08 3-4. Waxana trotted a mile to a
high-wheeled sulky in 2:08 1-4, a
world's record.
