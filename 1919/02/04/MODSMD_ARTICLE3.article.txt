# A
						Sad Story With Forgotten Moral
## 
### 
Work, work and a little more work
was the lot of the hall freshmen last
week. For ten (?) long, weary hours
the downtrodden babes toiled to change
the Encina club rooms into dance halls.
Did I say all? I meant all but one
toiled. That one man sat on the softest
couch that could be stolen from the
rooms of Encina and calmly smoked his
corncob. With disdain he surveyed the
toilers that sweated before him. Once
he condescended to advise on the deco
rations.
Yea, 'twas a lowly freshman. And this
is where the action of the story com
mences to speed up. We are now ap
proaching the climax. Our hero who
neither toiled nor spun did not sleep
well that night. Our policy being always
to discourage the use of the obvious, we
will close our tale here and let the reader
think deeply on what a nice little frosh
our wero zuas.
There is a moral to this story, too.
The writer, however, has forgotten for
the moment just what it is. It has
something to do, however, with bath
tubs and first-year students.
