At the last meeting of Pan-Hellenic j

houses that are farthest apart. The first
set of dinners will be given as follows:
Alpha Omicron Pi will exchange with
Gamma Phi Reta, Delta Delta Delta with
Pi Beta Phi, Alpha Phi with Kappa
Alpha Theta, Kappa Kappa Gamma with
Delta Gamma, and Chi Omega witli I
Sigma Kappa.
