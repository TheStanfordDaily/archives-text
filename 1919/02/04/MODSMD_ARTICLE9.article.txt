# RUGGERS TURN OUT TO SWAMP CALIFORNIA
## Contest Due to Be Fought Here on Washington's Birthday 
### 
Although as yet the rugby squad is
coachless, practice has been held daily
at the field since last Thursday. In spite
of the fact that those who are to battle
with the Blue and Gold fifteen on
Washington's Birthday, less than three
weeks off, must be without a coach for
a few days, negotiations arc on foot and
soon the Board of Athletic Control ex
pects to land Pete Flanagan, who so
ably directed the S. A. T. C. ruggers.
Flanagan is well known to all those
out for the sport, and knows the game
as thoroughly as he knows how to teach
it. Although Pete did not turn out a
winning team last quarter, with the ex
tra material on hand from this output
should come up to all expectations in
the big game with California.
If everyone turns out to the support
of the coach, whoever he may be, one
of the best teams ever put out may be
developed. Henry and Howell are in
line for positions at forward, and for
the other positions are Mood, Watts,
Clark, Wallace, Patrick, Meyer, Coch
rane, Curtice, Williamson, Righter and
Adams.
In the backficld Doe will probably
capture half-hack. The coach will not
find a dearth of material in Nagel. Shel
don, Long, Pelouze, Falk, Scofield,
Repath, Lilly and Kinney.
