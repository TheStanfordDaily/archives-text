# DR. JORDAN DELIVERS LECTURE ON ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON
## TELLS ROMANTIC STORY OF AUTHOR Adds Personal Touch to Unusual Experiences of "Tusitala" 
### 
"Tusitala in Samoa" (Robert Louis
Stevenson) formed the theme around
which Dr. Jordan last night in the Lit
tle Theater wove a romantic story illus
trated with pictures which he had him-,
self taken. "This is a little story of a
ship that I passed in the night," said
Dr. Jordan. The tale which he told is
as follows:
"Just forty years ago it was my for
tune to be sent to California by Presi
dent Hayes, for the purpose of finding
out for the United States government
what California was as an economic as
set of America. I had my office on
Montgomery street in San Francisco,
mi the site of the Old Occidental Hotel,
lust above this was the old Bush street
restaurarft. And this is of interest, for
just above this restaurant lived my
Friend. Here he.used to eat —a cup iff
coffee and a roll for breakfast, a 25-
cent'dinner and a ham-and for supper.
1 once ate there with him and had about
as bad a dinner as one ever gets.
"My Friend was not very prosperous;
lie was busy giving San Francisco a cos
mopolitan air, by writing things that no
body would then buy. He was rather
undersized, with sloping shoulders, long
dark hair like a poet, and two large
very bright eyes.
"Ham-ands didn't agree with him, and
after touring Europe on a donkey and
trying the climate of various parts of
the coast, he finally found a home on
an island where he could endure the
weather much better. My Friend de
scribed this island as the 'second place to
the left as you came out from San Fran
cisco.' On the island everything was new
and everyone 'fed on honey dew and
drank the milk of Paradise.' It was
surrounded with palms and with white
coral reefs.
"There on this tropical island my
Friend made the acquaintance of a
pirate, w ho formerly carried on the sim
ple. honest business of selling stolen na
tives as slaves. This pirate was full of
all kinds of slories of the seas, and to
him my Friend used to listen by the
hour.
"The people of the island were col
ored just like varnished leather and
dressed in cocoanut oil from the. waist
up. These natives grew very fond of
my Friend and built a road up to his
home, which was on one of the hills of
the island. They then placed a sign on
the path saying it was 'the road of lov
ing kindness.' After a while the natives
held a solemn banquet and gave my
friend his name 'Tusitala,' or, translated,
me who talks lengthwise—a story-teller.
That is the highest honor he ever re
ceived. I was also christened by the
same natives at a similar ceremony, and
it is the highest honor I have, except
the honor gained while an alderman of
May held. They called me 'the one who
tells fish stories.'
" 'Tusitala' was never very strong.
Tuberculosis crowded him more and
more and he finally died. The people of
this island, however, loved and appre
ciated him. When he died, they cut a
long trail through the brush—a stupen
dous undertaking in that tropical tangle
and carried him up to the top of a
mountain, where he was buried. The
stone of the region is poor material for
a monument, so they constructed a
tombstone of made rock. <)n one side
was carved the native flower of the
island, and below it was written 'To the
World's Renowned Story-Teller.' On
tin other side was inscribed the thistle
oi Scotland, together with his name and
the epitaph which lie wrote, and which
is familiar to everyone of us. It starts
as follows: 'Under a wide and starry
sk\. dig me a grave and let me lie,' etc."
Dr. Jordan concluded the lecture with
lantern slides of Stevenson himself, to
gether with various pictures of the
Samoan islands, showing the coral reefs
and the abundant vegetation of the re
eion.

"Tusitala in Samoa" (Robert Louis
Stevenson) formed the theme around
which Dr. Jordan last night in the Lit
tle Theater wove a romantic story illus
trated with pictures which he had him-,
self taken. "This is a little story of a
ship that I passed in the night," said
Dr. Jordan. The tale which he told is
as follows:
"Just forty years ago it was my for
tune to be sent to California by Presi
dent Hayes, for the purpose of finding
out for the United States government
what California was as an economic as
set of America. I had my office on
Montgomery street in San Francisco,
mi the site of the Old Occidental Hotel,
lust above this was the old Bush street
restaurarft. And this is of interest, for
just above this restaurant lived my
Friend. Here he.used to eat —a cup iff
coffee and a roll for breakfast, a 25-
cent'dinner and a ham-and for supper.
1 once ate there with him and had about
as bad a dinner as one ever gets.
"My Friend was not very prosperous;
lie was busy giving San Francisco a cos
mopolitan air, by writing things that no
body would then buy. He was rather
undersized, with sloping shoulders, long
dark hair like a poet, and two large
very bright eyes.
"Ham-ands didn't agree with him, and
after touring Europe on a donkey and
trying the climate of various parts of
the coast, he finally found a home on
an island where he could endure the
weather much better. My Friend de
scribed this island as the 'second place to
the left as you came out from San Fran
cisco.' On the island everything was new
and everyone 'fed on honey dew and
drank the milk of Paradise.' It was
surrounded with palms and with white
coral reefs.
"There on this tropical island my
Friend made the acquaintance of a
pirate, w ho formerly carried on the sim
ple. honest business of selling stolen na
tives as slaves. This pirate was full of
all kinds of slories of the seas, and to
him my Friend used to listen by the
hour.
"The people of the island were col
ored just like varnished leather and
dressed in cocoanut oil from the. waist
up. These natives grew very fond of
my Friend and built a road up to his
home, which was on one of the hills of
the island. They then placed a sign on
the path saying it was 'the road of lov
ing kindness.' After a while the natives
held a solemn banquet and gave my
friend his name 'Tusitala,' or, translated,
me who talks lengthwise—a story-teller.
That is the highest honor he ever re
ceived. I was also christened by the
same natives at a similar ceremony, and
it is the highest honor I have, except
the honor gained while an alderman of
May held. They called me 'the one who
tells fish stories.'
" 'Tusitala' was never very strong.
Tuberculosis crowded him more and
more and he finally died. The people of
this island, however, loved and appre
ciated him. When he died, they cut a
long trail through the brush—a stupen
dous undertaking in that tropical tangle
and carried him up to the top of a
mountain, where he was buried. The
stone of the region is poor material for
a monument, so they constructed a
tombstone of made rock. <)n one side
was carved the native flower of the
island, and below it was written 'To the
World's Renowned Story-Teller.' On
tin other side was inscribed the thistle
oi Scotland, together with his name and
the epitaph which lie wrote, and which
is familiar to everyone of us. It starts
as follows: 'Under a wide and starry
sk\. dig me a grave and let me lie,' etc."
Dr. Jordan concluded the lecture with
lantern slides of Stevenson himself, to
gether with various pictures of the
Samoan islands, showing the coral reefs
and the abundant vegetation of the re
eion.
