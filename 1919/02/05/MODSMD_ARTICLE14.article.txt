# VARSITY DEFEATS SANTA CLARA IN WHIRLWIND GAME
## WILLIAMSON DROPS FOUR LONG GOALS St. Mary's Five Promises to Put Up Stiff Game on Saturday Night 
### 
Stanford varsity defeated the quintet
from Santa Clara last night to the
tune of 53 to 22, in the fastest basket
ball game played on the local court
this season. The contest was fought
hard to the last, and it was only a
spurt in the latter part of the second
half that set the varsity so far ahead.
The mission five were forced on the
defensive during most of the game,
but put up a stubborn opposition until
the last eight minutes, when their
style of play was completely broken
up and Stanford scored almost twenty
points.
Coach Evans' training is beginning
to bring results, as was shown by the
perfect scoring machine which he
turned out for last night's game. The
passes used by the Cardinals out
witted the Santa Clara aggregation at
every angle, while the long shots
which were dropped into the basket
by Williamson were enough to un
nerve the visitors.
The visiting team was not as well
balanced as the locals. Manelli, who
was easily their stellar player, made
eighteen of the visitors' twenty-two
points. Hood scored seventeen points
l'cr the Cardinal team.
Pelouze dropped five field goals
through the ring during the first half
and then had to leave the game on ac
count of an injured foot. Moulton and
Esgen were used during the second
half and fitted perfectly into the scor
ing combinations.
Williamson came to his own during
the second half and dropped in four
goals fro mthe center of the court.
If his work continues to improve, it
will be a formidable obstacle for the
Blue and Gold basket tossers to face
when the big series begins.
Captain Righter played his usual
type of game and accounted for ten
points for Stanford.
St. Mary's will be the next uni
versity to put a team against the var
sity. They play here Saturday night.
According to reports coming from Oak
land, this game should be even closer
than the one last night. St. Mary's
has a league of old veterans back and
intends to put up a hard fight for hon
ors in the intercollegiate league.

eighteen of the visitors' twenty-two
points. Hood scored seventeen points
l'cr the Cardinal team.
Pelouze dropped five field goals
through the ring during the first half
and then had to leave the game on ac
count of an injured foot. Moulton and
Esgen were used during the second
half and fitted perfectly into the scor
ing combinations.
Williamson came to his own during
the second half and dropped in four
goals fro mthe center of the court.
If his work continues to improve, it
will be a formidable obstacle for the
Blue and Gold basket tossers to face
when the big series begins.
Captain Righter played his usual
type of game and accounted for ten
points for Stanford.
St. Mary's will be the next uni
versity to put a team against the var
sity. They play here Saturday night.
According to reports coming from Oak
land, this game should be even closer
than the one last night. St. Mary's
has a league of old veterans back and
intends to put up a hard fight for hon
ors in the intercollegiate league.

Stanford varsity defeated the quintet
from Santa Clara last night to the
tune of 53 to 22, in the fastest basket
ball game played on the local court
this season. The contest was fought
hard to the last, and it was only a
spurt in the latter part of the second
half that set the varsity so far ahead.
The mission five were forced on the
defensive during most of the game,
but put up a stubborn opposition until
the last eight minutes, when their
style of play was completely broken
up and Stanford scored almost twenty
points.
Coach Evans' training is beginning
to bring results, as was shown by the
perfect scoring machine which he
turned out for last night's game. The
passes used by the Cardinals out
witted the Santa Clara aggregation at
every angle, while the long shots
which were dropped into the basket
by Williamson were enough to un
nerve the visitors.
The visiting team was not as well
balanced as the locals. Manelli, who
was easily their stellar player, made
eighteen of the visitors' twenty-two
points. Hood scored seventeen points
l'cr the Cardinal team.
Pelouze dropped five field goals
through the ring during the first half
and then had to leave the game on ac
