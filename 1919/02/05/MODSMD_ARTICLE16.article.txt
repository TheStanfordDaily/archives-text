# HOW ABOUT IT, COMMITTEE?
## 
### 
Hopes for a speedy resumption of student control have been considerably
dampened by the realization that the committee appointed over a week ago
by the president of the associated students to consider the matter has not
yet met. One of the essentials to a successful campaign of this kind is that
a committee such as this should have frequent meetings, and that they should
be open to the public. The public, the Stanford student body, is interested in
student control just at present, and are willing to support any movement
or any group which will take up the matter in earnest. But public interest
cannot be kept up indefinitely in a proposition which is being neglected by
those whose especial duty it is to take care of it.
It may be answered that the system of student control to be put up for
adoption will be decided upon by a series of informal conferences between
members of the committee, and there will be no need for formal public meet
ings. To argue in this line will be very apt to result in the failure of the
whole movement. To have student control there must be support, and sup
port by the whole public, not by any group, however select of representative.
Student government in the future must be a genuine democracy, and not an
oligarchy in which the satisfied many are ruled by the energetic few.
The committee on student control should regard itself as representing
and guiding student opinion, and not as a group of wise men who are to retire
to a dark cave and emerge presently with a full-grown, hand-carved scheme
for ptudent control.
