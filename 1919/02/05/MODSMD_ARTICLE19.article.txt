LAKE LAGUNITA
Lake Lagunita was originally a swamp
dug out and enlarged by Senator Stan
ford. The water which collected during
the winter was used in the summer to
irrigate vegetable gardens in the vicinity
of Palo Alto.
Since the first days of Stanford, stu
dents have enjoyed water sports and
canoeing on the lake. The opening day
in Junior week is looked forward to by
all students with keen anticipation, the
celebration on the lake being the initial
event, followed the next day, which is
usually Saturday, by sport activities on
it. interclass regattas and aquatic sports
are engaged in, tilting contests provid
ing a cource of continued amusement to
both the immediate parties and to the

spectators. The class of 1911 conceived
the idea of starting the big celebration,
on the opening day, with music on the
lake. The class of 1912 brought the in
novation of fireworks, and in the last
few years the Stanford Band, the Glee
Club and Mandolin Club provide the
musical accompaniment to the display of
fireworks. Canoes glided over the lake,
and searchlights on the bank, in the
hands of inquisitive "roughs,"' helped to
disclose the identity of "queeners."
The boathouse on the bank was once
inhabited by some Stanford students,
who familiarly called it "Villa de La
gunita."
Last year the sports on the lake could
not be held, due to lack of water, and
class races were held instead.
