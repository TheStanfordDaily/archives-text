### 
A new book of war poems, "En Repos
and Elsewhere," verses, written in
France in 1917-18 by two Stanford stu
dents, Lansing Warren and Robert Don
aldson, both '16 men, has just made its
appearance, and may be had at the
Hookstore.
The verses were written in the midst '
of heavy fighting, shell-fire and destruc
tion, many scribbled in star-shell 1 iv?ht i
and by lightning flashes of the guns. J
They arc the reflections, now playful, |
now serious, of the typical American
youth upon the surrounding life on;
the French front.
"En repos," say the authors, is when j
the soldier has to spend anywhere from
one-half to two-thirds of his valuable
time resting in some half-forgotten vil j
lage; sometimes .after a trick on the line
when something has "been doing," this
"repos" is very grateful.
The verses were originally printed in
the American Field Service Bulletin,
which is a weekly publication in France,
printed for the amusement of the edit
ors and their comrades.
