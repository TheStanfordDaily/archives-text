### 
Phi Delta Phi takes great sorrow tn
announcing the loss of its life-long friend
and brother, the Reverend John Walker
Barleycorn. (Belmont papers please
please copy.)
It was a most touching scene this noon
when John Barleycorn's funeral cortege
passed up the Row. Eight somber fig
ures, garbed in black robes and hoods,
bscorted the venerable old gentleman to
his last resting place on the post office
steps. It was a solemn occasion, and
[in the large crowd of mourners that fol
lowed there was not one light heart.
John Barleycorn was a man loved by all.
Reverend William Russell, his voice
choked with tears, spoke a simple eulogy,
over the dear departed one, and the
wailing of the mourners grew defeaning,
I'J'he seven pallbearers, Mr. Barleycorn's
pest friends in life, were Robert Pelouze
I. T. Murphy, J. Sturgeon, Benjamir
Wood, C. A. Doe, C. R. Long anc
C S. Davis.
Today is a sad one on the Farm, anc
the campus is shrouded with gloom. The
Daily Palo Alto extends to Phi DelU
Phi all condolences in their recent be
reavement.
