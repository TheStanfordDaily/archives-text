# Musical Critics Praise Ganz' Art
## Theodore Thomas Writes of Warmth and Moderation of Pianist 
### 
Rudolph Ganz, the eminent Swiss
pianist, who wdl be heard in a recital
at the Assembly Hall on Friday even
ing, combines in equal measure natural
gifts and artistic ability. When the late
Theodore Thomas selected Mr. Ganz to
introduce the Mountain Symphony of
D'lndy with the Chicago Symphony Or
chestra. the great conductor took up his
pen after the performance and wrote on
the score:
"You have shown today that it is pos
sible to" play with warmth and modera
tion simultaneously."
This has been the secret of Mr. Ganz'
success, the power to produce emotion
in others and to govern it in himself.
The musical critics have been delight
ed to coin phrases about him. They
unite in praising his art, but their de
scriptions of it are so widely at variance
that one might suppose him to be the
artistic puzzle of the age.
He is "the most progressive of the
day's pianists," according to the critic
of the Chicago American. "He is the
embodiment of classicism," says the
critic of the Minneapolis Journal. He
is really not a puzzle, but simply an
artist of wonderful versatility who never
overlooks an opportunity and never for
gets his art. He was a modernist before
it was fashionable to be one, and he is
a modernist or a classicist as he chooses
to be.
