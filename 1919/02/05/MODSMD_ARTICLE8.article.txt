# BOARDS ASK FOR REVISION
## 
### 
Steps were taken at a meeting of the
Women's War Board last night to form
ulate the recommendation to he sent to
Women's Conference, that the War
Board be dissolved and a new organiza
tion he created in its place to be known
as the "Service Board,' under the
auspices of the Associated Women Stu
dents of Stanford University. A com
mittee has been appointed to draw up
the resolution and have it ready in the
final draft to he approved at the next
meeting of the War Board, so that it
may he presented at the next meeting
of Women's Conference.

Under this new plan the Associated
Women Students will retain all of the
! work which the War Board lias carried
I on, and in addition to these activities
! the new board will undertake the Lane
Clinic work. The new hoard, according
to the present plans, will retain a num
ber of the members of the old organ
ization and only new girls will'be put
in where it is considered most advisable
from an efficient point of view. Those
who are most actively interested in this
new plan feel convinced that the new
reorganization on the campus will stimu
late the interest of the women in the
University in philanthropic work.
