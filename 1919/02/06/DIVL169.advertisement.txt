Midnight and quiet reigns at Itoble
one minute, the next pandemonium
and terror. Women, aroused from the
varying occupations of 11:30 p.m. flee
panic-stricken down the halla. One
carries shoes under one arm, another
a lamp, and still another a package of
love letters.
The reason?
Some one rang the fire bell.
The result?
Some one doesn't queen for two
weeks.
