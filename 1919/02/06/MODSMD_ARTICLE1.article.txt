# SAN FRANCISCO MUCH IMPRESSED BY GANZ CONCERT
## AUDIENCE IS DELIGHTED WITH PROGRAM Critic From San Francisco Chronicle Declares the Pianist a Genius 
### 
Rudolph Ganz, the eminent Swiss
pianist, who will appear here Friday
evening at the Assembly Hall, created
great enthusiasm in his concert in San
Francisco last Sunday, both by his won
derful playing and by the pleasing se
lections that comprised his program.
His program for Stanford is equally
delightful.
"Whether the fame of Ganz has been
retarded unduly because he wears his
hair short, or because he sits at the
pianoforte with his head erect and an
upright back, or because be travels
through art with sanity seeking purity
and beauty carrying no lily or sunflower
in his hands, I do not know; but it is
true that he lias never been as popular
with the masses of music lovers as he
ought to have been. He has offered
them no showmanship, and those who
hear music with their eyes have missed
and will always miss the aureola that
illumines heads 110 better than his in
music, but wiser in the crafty ways of
self-exploitation. Gradually, however,
Ganz has made his way by virtue of a
genius that never shone so brightly as
yesterday when he played at the Colum
bia Theater. Gradually he has added to j
lii.s disciples, multiplied his admirers,
and extended the influence of his recti- ;
tude in music until he competes with
any of his confereres as a "drawing"
virtuoso, and this is all the more re-j
markable and mutually creditable to!
player and audience because he has
scorned with princely superiority to
smirch his muse with mendacious com
promise.
"Be sure he is still the intellectual
player, for he who is not drivels and
drools. Be sure that his brain is in
every measure presiding with admon
itory control and passionless discrimi
nation over the emotions of his offer
ings. Be sure that the weight and pow
er of his passion become doubled in
pressure and effectiveness by reason of
the judgment that conquers, controls
and then lets loose the torrents of
tone."
