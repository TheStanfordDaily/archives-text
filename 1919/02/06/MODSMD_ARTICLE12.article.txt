# BATTERY MEN ARE WORKING OUT DAILY WITH COACH EVANS
## NEWLANDS IS SHOWING GOOD FORM Bundy, Yale Transfer, Will Be Eligible for Varsity Baseball Team 
### H. G. Swendsen, '20 
Determined to develop some good
heavers for the Varsity nine, Coach
Evans is trying the whole Varsity squad
out in the gymnasium to see if any of
them are pitching material. The coach
declares that at least 80 per cent of a
nine is in the pitcher's box, and is de
termined to have 75 per cent of the
eighty good material.
The catching department is being
handled nicely by Bundy, a player from
the Yale Naval Unit of the S. A. T. C.
He has never represented a university
on a team, but played with the navy, so
is eligible for the Varsity here.
Gillis, Fairchilds, -Newlands and
Tuebner are at present ..working out in
the gymnasium for the heaving staff.
Gillis and Newlands are the two best
possibilities. Newlands has worlds of
speed, and although lie never pitche 1
before, is being shown some real stuff
by Coach Evans.
Gillis and Fairchilds were on the
freshman nine last year. Gillis has a
good arm, but will need worlds of
coaching before he can take the box
against a strong team. Fairchilds, al
though small, has pitched good ball in
the past, and should help out with the
\ arsity. Tuebner is a good first base
man, but his pitching ability is an un
known quantity. Evans is determined
to have a port-sider on his staff, and
may turn Tuebner into the man.
The pitchers and catchers have been
working out for two weeks in the gym,
and are ready for outside practice. The
weather, however, is much too cold for
stiff arms at present, and the Varsity
candidates will probably turn out within
the next two weeks on the Varsity lot
to get ready for the season.
