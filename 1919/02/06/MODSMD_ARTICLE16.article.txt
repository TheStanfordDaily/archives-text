# ELECTION HISTORY

### 
While extending the hand of editorial congratulation to the editor-elect,
it may be well to say a few words regarding the history of Daily Palo Alto
elections. From the earliest times the editorship of the Daily was regarded
as a political, as well as a journalistic office. The editor was elected by vote
of the whole student body, and sat in the executive committee of that organ
ization. This combination -of functions resulted in considerable confusion and
often caused the infusion of journalism into politics ,and politics into journal
ism, to the detriment of both. The system would have had obvious advantages
if it could have been conducted without intrigue, but to try to run a college
student body without intrigue is like trying to run a dairy without cows.
So, after a couple of campaigns for editor, in which political ambitions
played a greater part in deciding the issue than journalistic ability, the elec
tion was, in the new constitution adopted last year, taken away from the stu
dent body and given to the editorial staff. To provide a check on possibly
office politics, the constitution provides that upon petition by fifty voters, the
student council may, within a week of the staff election, declare that election
void, and call a general election of the whole student body to fill the office.
There has not yet been time to give this new system a thorough tryout, but
the only obvious danger is that the deadening system of absolute seniority in
place of real ability will be the controlling factor in staff elections.
