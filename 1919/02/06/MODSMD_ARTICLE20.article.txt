# BASKETBALL DOPE FOR QUINTET FANS
## 
### 
Stanford would have a basketball
team about 50 per cent stronger if the
designers of Encina gymnasium had
used ordinary ability. The concrete
foundation over which the gymnasium
floor is built has put two good men
on the Cardinal team out, possibly for
the season, and has slowed up other
players considerably.
Pelouze injured his foot on the hard
floor, and is on crutches, while Moul
ton was hurt much the same way, and
is just recovering after two weeks off
the court. Righter and Lilly are suf
fering with sore legs, with the result
that the whole team has been ham
pered.
It would behoove the University,
with the number of students using the
Encina floor to remodel it to such an
extent that men can play on the floor
without being injured.
The varsity is improving with every
game. Coach Evans is not working
his men between contests, satisfying
himself with correcting their faults.
The team-work isasserting itself as
the team uses it, and the play is tight
ening up all around.
The playing of Esgen in the Santa
Clara game was a revelation to fans
who have not been following the bas
ketball season closely. The coach de
veloped Esgen from an inexperienced
man and this forward only lacked con
fidence to drop them in. Although he
played only part of the second half.
Esgen made four baskets.
The freshman team will have strong
competition when they buck against
San Jose High School preliminary to
the varsity-St. Mary's game Saturday
night on the local court. The first
year players have shown up well in
their games so far, although they have :
been pitted against rather weak I
teams. Davies, Mangin, Neer at for- j
ward, Gerson at center, Reeder. Aus
tin, and Larsen at guards, form the
'22 squad.
