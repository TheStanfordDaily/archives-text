# France and the War Subject of Lecture
## Experiences With the French Infantry Are to Be Related 
### 
Jean Alcide Picard, a Frenchman who
served two years with the French army,
including the battle of the Marne and
the first battle of Ypres, will address a
university assembly next Wednesday
morning in the Assembly Hall at 11
o'clock. Mr. Picard is a well-known
author and lecturer. He has lectured
all over the United States on different
aspects of the war, but he feels that
perhaps he is best qualified to speak
upon "The Spirit of France,' which will
be his topic for the coming assembly.
Mr. Picard was in America at the out-
Ibreak of the Great War in 1914, but he
returned immediately to France, where
he enlisted and saw service in the in
fantry and the hospital corps. Being
; disabled, he came to this country to pro- J
mote an interest in France and, through!
| his knowledge of conditions in his home |
J country, aid in giving information
j which would bear upon the solution of:
American problems. For that reason
Mr. Picard has been sent to practically;
| all of the training camps in the country
under the Educational Bureau of the
jY. M. C. A.
Mr. Picard is said to speak with an
unusual force and energy, which has
brought him enthusiastic audiences
wherever he has gone. Professor L. E.
Bassett. chairman of the public exer
cises committee, considers the Univer- j
sity fortunate to have the opportunity to
hear the Frenchman, who will undoubt
edly be able to give a new light on the
relation of the spirit of France to post
war conditions. A good attendance is
hoped for from the students in order to
make the assembly the success that it
deserves to be.
