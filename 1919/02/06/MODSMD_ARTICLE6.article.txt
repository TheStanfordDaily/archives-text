"BifT! Bang!! Bulsheveek!!!" is the
title of the Ram's Head musical extrava
ganza that will be given in the Assembly
Hall on Friday, February 21. The book
and lyrics are by M. A (Milt) Hagen,
'IS. The music has been written by
J. H. (Swede) Larsen, '17, and A. D.
Wilkie, '18. The cast and chorus will
be coached by Leland L. Pickering, '20.
Besides Pickering's coaching, special
professional assistance will be given the
show by Ralph Allen, the Orpheum
headliner. Julian Eltinge, the famous
female impersonator, has also given
much valuable advice regarding the fe
male impersonation which is always a
feature of Ram's Head shows. Pro
fessor H. D. Grey of the English de
partment, an honorary member of Ram's
Head, will also assist in the production.
The extravaganza will consist of two

acts. W. E. (Monk) Antrim, president
of Ram's will feature the show
by many of his comic cartoons. A jazz
orchestra under the direction of L. H.
Salzburg, '19, and organized by Sterling
Clark, '21 will be another attraction.
The Committee on Student Affairs
has decided not to permit the produc
tion of the Ram's Head shows in San
Francisco and San Jose. The dates
that have been previously announced at
those towns are therefore cancelled.
As the title suggests, the motif of the
show will be vodka, vooman and voice,
the Russian version of the famous
phrase, according to Milt Hagen, the
author. Ticket drawings will be held
in the usual way at the Bookstore and
Robinson & Crandall's in Palo Alto.
The date of the sale has not been an
nounced vet.
