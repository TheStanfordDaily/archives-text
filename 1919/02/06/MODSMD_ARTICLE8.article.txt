# NOVICES TO MEET IN MAT CONTESTS ON FEBRUARY 14
## 
### 
One week from Friday the first
wrestling tournament of the season will
come off, when men will be chosen for
the coming spring events. The meet
will be for novices alone, the older men
in the activity taking no part in the
tournament. From all the dope obtain
able the meet should be a particularly
interesting one, due to the fact that
some of the new men that are out for
the sport this quarter are showing up in
excellent shape and bid fair to make the
Cardinal team. Coach Jones believes
that it will.be a fight from beginning to
end.
The duration of the bouts will prob
ably be five minutes, while the finals
will be about seven minutes. Tourna
ments of this kind will be held previous
to all the corning spring meets.
