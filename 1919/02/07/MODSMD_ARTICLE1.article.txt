Three more characters are provided

"His Majesty, Bunker Bean," a
comedy in five episodes, from the
novel by Henry Leon Wilson, has been
selected by the Sophomore Class for
the 1921 play, which will be given at
the Assembly Hall on March 7. An
nouncement of the cast was made late
last night after the final tryouts.
Miss Dorothy Johnston and E. L
McElroy will take the leading parts
in the play. Miss Johnston, who will
play the part of Marie, the Flapper,
will appear for the first time on a
Stanford stage, but has had consider
able experience in amateur dramatics.
McElroy will take in the role of "His
Majesty, Bunker Bean," and is partic
ularly adapted to the part.
Lively action, many complications,
and a wholesome plot are the charac
teristics of the play on which the
1921 class is banking for success.
Frank L. Mathieu of San Francisco,
who will coach the play for the sopho
mores, is highly enthusiastic over its
possibilities and thinks that it is one
of the best modern comedies avail
able for amateur production.
"His Majesty, Bunker Bean," is a
type of play that plays itself, and lias
been classed as a rival of "The Seven
Keys to Baldpate,' ''Ready Money,'
and"It Pays to Advertise," all of
which have been produced at Stan
ford.

present date and March 7, and re
hearsals for the 1921 show are sched
