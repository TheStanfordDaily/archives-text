# VARSITY FIVE WILL MEET ST. MARY'S TOUGHEST
## PELOUZE OUT OF GAME Oakland Team Considered One of Strongest in the League 
### 
Stanford Varsity basketball team will
take the floor tomorrow night against
the St. Mary's five in one of the most
critical games of the intercollegiate
series. The game will be called at 8
o'clock, and, as usual, registration tickets
will admit students to the contest.
Stanford's hope of finishing at the
head of the California-Nevada intercol
legiate league will largely depend on the
outcome of Saturday's game. Word
from Oakland has it that the St. Mary's
team considers California out of the
running for the championship, and is
coming down to the Farm with the in
tention of sewing up her chance for hon
ors in the race.
With "Bobbie" Pelouze permanently
out of the game the Varsity will be play
ing under a considerable handicap.
Moulton is also suffering with an in
jured foot and may not be able to start
in the contest tomorrow.
From the present outlook, Hood and
Esgen will have to do most of the work
in the scoring end of the court. Cap
tain Righter will play his usual position
at center, and Williamson and Lilly, will
start as guards. Leiser, Bucklin and
Coughey will lie on hand to do relief
work.
Very little is known of the merits of
the Oakland five, except that there are
three former veterans back on the team
and that the St. Mary's aggregation
considers itself one of the strongest
contenders for the league championship.
As this is the last league contest sched
uled before the game with California on
February 15, arrangements are being
made to accommodate a large number of
spectators who are expccted to be on
hand to size up the outlook for the big
series.
The Blue and Gold league has secured
a new coach, and are said to be show
ing marked improvement in their style
of play. Symes, captain of last year's
freshman team, is probably the most
dangerous man on the California var
sity. Hjelti, the big California center,
is said byb enthusiasts from across the
bay to be an even match for Righter,
and the two will undoubtedly put up a
royal battle for the supremacy of the
court.
No games have yet been scheduled to
fill the gap between tomorrow night and
February 15. but Student Manager
Ames promises that some good competi
tion will be secured to keep the Varsity
in shape.
The Olympic Club and several service
teams around the bay cities are anxious
for a chance to tangle with the Cardi
nals.
As a preliminary event, the freshman
team will go tip against the fast San
I Jose high quintet. Neither team has
i been defeated this season, so a close
I game is expected. A return contest will
be played in San Jose next Wednesday
I night.
Last night the babes held the Varsity
Ito a very low score. 1 hose playing last
! night will probably go into the Satur
| day game. They are : Davies, Neer, Man
! gin, Gerson. Austin, Reeder, Larson and
i Holsten.

dangerous man on the California var
sity. Hjelti, the big California center,
is said byb enthusiasts from across the
bay to be an even match for Righter,
and the two will undoubtedly put up a
royal battle for the supremacy of the
court.
No games have yet been scheduled to
fill the gap between tomorrow night and
February 15. but Student Manager
Ames promises that some good competi
tion will be secured to keep the Varsity
in shape.
The Olympic Club and several service
teams around the bay cities are anxious
for a chance to tangle with the Cardi
nals.
As a preliminary event, the freshman
team will go tip against the fast San
I Jose high quintet. Neither team has
i been defeated this season, so a close
I game is expected. A return contest will
be played in San Jose next Wednesday
I night.
Last night the babes held the Varsity
Ito a very low score. 1 hose playing last
! night will probably go into the Satur
| day game. They are : Davies, Neer, Man
! gin, Gerson. Austin, Reeder, Larson and
i Holsten.
Stanford Varsity basketball team will
take the floor tomorrow night against
the St. Mary's five in one of the most
critical games of the intercollegiate
series. The game will be called at 8
o'clock, and, as usual, registration tickets
will admit students to the contest.
Stanford's hope of finishing at the
head of the California-Nevada intercol
legiate league will largely depend on the
outcome of Saturday's game. Word
from Oakland has it that the St. Mary's
team considers California out of the
running for the championship, and is
coming down to the Farm with the in
tention of sewing up her chance for hon
ors in the race.
With "Bobbie" Pelouze permanently
out of the game the Varsity will be play
ing under a considerable handicap.
Moulton is also suffering with an in
jured foot and may not be able to start
in the contest tomorrow.
From the present outlook, Hood and
Esgen will have to do most of the work
in the scoring end of the court. Cap
tain Righter will play his usual position
at center, and Williamson and Lilly, will
start as guards. Leiser, Bucklin and
Coughey will lie on hand to do relief
work.
Very little is known of the merits of
the Oakland five, except that there are
three former veterans back on the team
and that the St. Mary's aggregation
considers itself one of the strongest
contenders for the league championship.
As this is the last league contest sched
uled before the game with California on
February 15, arrangements are being
made to accommodate a large number of
spectators who are expccted to be on
hand to size up the outlook for the big
series.
The Blue and Gold league has secured
a new coach, and are said to be show
ing marked improvement in their style
of play. Symes, captain of last year's
freshman team, is probably the most
dangerous man on the California var
sity. Hjelti, the big California center,
is said byb enthusiasts from across the
bay to be an even match for Righter,
and the two will undoubtedly put up a
