# NOMINATIONS BY MONDAY
## 
### 
Trying to arouse interest in an election when the public refuses to be aroused
is one of the most hopeless jobs that ever confronts a weary reformer. The his
tory of American politics in the past century furnishes countless illustrations of
this fact. It is only human nature not to become greatly excited over an election
when no vital issue is to be decided, and no factions are in evidence to stir up
matters.
Such is the Stanford public in regard to the semi-annual election next week,
with the exception that there are not even heard the voices of the weary reformers
crying in the wilderness.
Nominations for several seats in the Student Council to be filled at the
Wednesday election must be made by Monday, according to the provisions of the
constitution of the Associated Students. The nominations must be made to the
chairman of the election board, and must be published in the Daily Palo Alto of
that date. Furthermore, almost all class officers are to be elected in the same man
nerâ€”nominations mailed to the chairman of the election board, published in the
Daily Palo Alto, and the elections themselves to be held on Quad. This change
was made recently, but the classes don't seem to have wakened up to the fact yet.
At least, let's not let the election go by default because the student body didn't
wake up to the fact that nominations were due.
