# LIFE MEMBERSHIP IN CLUB HOUSE IS ASKED
## 
### 
The Board of Directors of the Wom
en's Club House have started a drive
among the women of the campus for
life membership in the clubhouse.
The clubhouse was founded by a
group of women alumnii who saw the
necessity of a woman's building on the
campus, and thereafter the majority of
women took a life membership in the
clubhouse. However, since the war and
since one dollar from the fees of each
woman student has gone towards the
upkeep of the clubhouse, there has been
a decrease in the numher of life mem
berships.
It was decided that the sixteen dollars
paid as fees during the four years of
residence on the campus can be used to
ward payment of the twenty-five dol
lars. All women who arc interested
are asked to see Mrs. Euell or one of
the Board of Directors for further par
ticulars.
It was planned at the last board meet
ing to resume the monthly teas and ben
efits at the clubhouse that were discon
tinued because of the war.
