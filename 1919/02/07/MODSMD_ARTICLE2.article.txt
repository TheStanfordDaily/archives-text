# Noted Swiss Pianist Plays This Evening
## Rudolph Ganz to Entertain With Unusual Programs at Assembly Hall 
### 
Rudolph Ganz, the great Swiss pianist,
will begin his concert in the Assembly
Hall at 8:15 this evening.
Ganz' unusual pianistic qualities have
often been recognized, but that which,
above all other things, makes his work
of value, is his absolute renunciation of
sensational effects. His readings are en
tirely free from arbitrary affectation
and exaggerated sentimentality, and yet
are widely remote from mere superfici
ality.
His effects are the outcome of honest
conviction ; his working out of a com
position is logical, and clearly reveals
liis fervent feeling, which glows alone
for the art of his work.

selected a varied and entirely pleasing
