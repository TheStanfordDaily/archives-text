# Japan Is Subject of Talk by Dr. Jordan
## Japanese Situation Discussed at Informal Gathering at Jordan Home 
### 
"Japan will never do anything to which
America ;fnd Great Britain will seriously
object," said Hr. Jordan in an informal
talk on "Japan" at his home last night.
"Japan is dependent upon the United
States, over one-third of her exports
going to San Francisco and Seattle. As
to the immigration, the fact is true,
that wc don't want California stratified,
with Americans on top and Japanese
and Chinese laborers in lower social
scales."
The Magdalena Bay question was also
analyzed by Dr. Jordan, who showed that
at the time of the* commotion in tlic
Senate there was nothing there but one
cannery for crabs and turtles, with about
100 men, six of whom were Japanese.
The cannery was owned by a Los An
geles friend (if Dr. Jordan, the Japanese
mostly from San Diego.
In speaking of the Japanese students.
Dr. Jordan said that at the pre present
time tbcre are some 200 Stanford men
in Japan, who all occupy prominent
places. Altogether there are about 2000
graduates from the rest of tbe United
States. Tbe type that comes here, says
Dr. Jordan, are mostly .descendents of
the Snmuraki, or feudal retainers, in tbe
earlier times, but who were left with
out property when dismissed at the end
of the regime.
"The sound wisdom and wide infor
mation of these Japanese teachers of
democracy is a solid guarantee of na
tional good-will."
