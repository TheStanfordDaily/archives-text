Editor D. P. A.:
We have hail to witness some very
poor work on the part of officials at
the gym this year and it is hard to j
blame any one for letting out a cry;
at bad decisions such as we have no-1
ticed, especially those who understand
the game, and realize that some of|
the officials have let the games get
away from them, or rather refereed
according to their own rules and not
the rule book. One official admitted
after the game to the coach that he
had not read the rules in four years,
| while there has been changes each of
these years.
When a good official comes here
! such as Mr. Kearns, who handled the
Davis game, and shows for two-thirds
! of the game that he knows how, and
is absolutely impartial, and then re
: ceives a hoot from the Stanford men
if he calls a foul, shows poor sports
; mansliip on our part.
Referees are human and none will
admit they can go through a whole
! (:ame without making one mistake or
more, but if they do, it is 110 excuse
Jto hiss at him. Be a sport and stick
I up for the official unless he is abso
lutely hopeless, and then never agree
10 him again if he is not capable.
Mr. Harris of Oakland has been
1 chosen to referee the St. Marys game
tomorrow night. Stanford has three
first-string 111011 011 the disabled list
and may lose the game, but it won't
jbe Harris' fault if we do. If we are
i unfortunate in not having our best
men in the game we can stand to lose
if our opponents have a better team,
as it takes a real man to stand defeat,
j but any one can be a good winner.
I We know Mr. Harris is a good official
and let's back him up tomorrow night
and see a nice clean game of basket
ball.
