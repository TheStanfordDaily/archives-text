# Fable of the Hunt for the Beauty Chorus
## 
### 
I heard that the Ram's Head were
going to give a musical extravaganza on
the day before Washington's birthday,
so I went around to see if they wouldn't
let me see the beauty chorus practice.
11 always was curious to see how it felt
to be a stage-door Johnny.)
Well, I went into the Assembly Hall
and started in to look for the beauty
chorus. I saw Mickey McDermott and
a lot of freshmen wriggling around upon
the stage, but T didn't pay much atten
tion to them. I hunted for quite a while
but couldn't find anything that looked
like a beauty. Then I ran into the night
watchman and I said, "Where do they
keep their beauty chorus?"
He said, "That's them," and pointed
to Mickey and the freshmen. They did
n't look anything like Lillian Russell to
me, so I quit hunting for the beauty
chorus and sat down to watch the boys
try to dance and sing.
Then I noticed that there was a lone
audience to watch them. I found out
that it was Leland Pickering, the di
rector. He was giving a wonderful
monologue. First he said: "Smile,
dern ye, smile! If you can't see any
thing to laugh at, look at me. Mickey,
tell the boys a funny story. Yes, the
main idea is to keep in time with the
music when you dance (Dots
show a lapse of two hours, the mono
logue going strong all the time.) . . . .
That will be all for tonight. Show up
tomorrow, and be sure and have that
new song I just gave you learned."
Then 1 went back to my hard bed in
Encina, being thankful that I wasn't a
part of the beauty chorus that didn't
look like beauties. Anyway, I guess
they will be beauties some day. I hope
so.
