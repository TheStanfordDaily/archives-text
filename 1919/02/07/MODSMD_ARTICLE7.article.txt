# Press Club Is to Be Re-Organized
## L.W. McDermott, '18, as Only Old Member, Will Be in Charge 
### 
One of the active honor societies of
the pre-war campus is to be revived in
the Press Club, which will again make
its appearance within the next few
weeks, according to S. W. McDermott,
'18, who is at present the only member
at Stanford.
The announcement is important to
Stanford journalists, and for some time
the University has needed an active
group of representative men to further
the development of journalism at Stan
ford.
The Press Club has been the big honor
society for journalists since the early
history of Stanford. Its members have
always taken an interest in the progress
of Stanford publications and have en
deavored to shape their policies so that
every field of news will be completely
covered.
The members of the club are selected
from the staffs of the various University
publications. As a result of the club's
activities, "Al" Griffin, '17, a member of
the society, started the Illustrated Re
view, an important student paper, two
years ago.
McDermott plans to call a meeting
of representative journalists of Stanford
within the next week or so and to reor
ganize the club so that it may resume its
work by the first of next month. The
policy of the society will be along the
same lines which characterized its suc
cess in the davs before the war.
