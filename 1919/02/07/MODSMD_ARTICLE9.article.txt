# '19-'2O Jolly-Up Tonight Promises Plenty of Jazz
## 
### 
According to the committee in charge,
the Upper-Class Jolly-up to be held at
Encina tonight will be one of the biggest
things that has been attempted on the
campus for some time. Nothing has
been left undone to make the affair an
unqualified success.
.Monk" Antrim with his jazz orches
tra of five pieces will outdo any of his
former efforts. If reports are true, the
music will be of a quality as good or
better than that provided by the Palace
Hotel Orchestra that was brought down
from the city for one of the jolly-ups
last quarter. .'Sticky" Wilson has con
cocted a wierd dish that is reputed to
be such a palate tickler as has not been
discovered in many days. The ingredi
ents are:
Strawberry syrup
Orange ice
Salted olmonds
Vanilla ice cream
Whipped cream
Maraschino cherries
All upper-classmen are requested to
wear their cords. If cords are not worn,
dinks or sophomore caps are to be used
to show the breed of the wearer. All
the windows are to be opened so the air
will be in good condition.
Everyone is invited, including the
wearers of the gray dink. The price of
admission will be 50 cents, including
war tax.
