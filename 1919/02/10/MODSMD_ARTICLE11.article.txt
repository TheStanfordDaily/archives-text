# Movement Started to Bring Crew Back to Standing Before War
## Will Make Canvas of Living Groups Students Must Support Sport by Subscription for First Year 
### 
Under the supervision of a committee
of live men, crew activities will start
tonight. The first work-out for Varsity
and freshmen eights will be held next
Thursday afternoon at 4:30 at the boat
house on Lagunita, but the committee
will commence at once to raise the neces
sary money to maintain the crew through
the season.
No sport in the history of the Uni
versity has meant so much to the Uni
versity in the way of publicity and clean
sportsmanship as the water activity, and
those back of the sport are determined
to put it over.
The Board of Athletic control will not
be able to finance a crew this season,
and the money necessary, some thousand
dollars, will have to be raised by sub
scription from the students to keep the
crew in existence this year, while finan
cial difficulties are so important.
lo this end, all living groups on the
campus have been put in charge of one
of the following men, composing the
crew committees: L. C. Rogers, '17,
chairman; F. A. Watts, '19; W. C. Bent,
'19; W. I. Ames, '18, and E. R. Caughey.
bS. J hese groups will be canvassed for
funds, and the results of this canvass
will be published in the Daily Palo Alto
from time to time. Early next quarter
a crew jolly-up will be given, the total
proceeds of which are to go to the crew
fund.
One thousand dollars will be the goal
set for the fund. A minimum of this
amount is necessary if the season is to
be successful, according to an estimate
of Varsity crew men, and the committee
will go out for the limit.
Following is the division of living
groups: Encina Hall will be taken care
of by Ames and Caughey; Watts will
handle Phi Gamma Delta, El Camino,
Delta Tau Delta, Phi Kappa Psi, Theta
Xi, Alpha Omicron Pi, Delta Delta
Delta, Pi Beta Phi, Gamma Phi Beta,
and Alpha Tau Omega; Rogers will be
in charge of Roble Hall, Delta Chi,
Theta Delta Chi, Alpha Delta Phi, Alpha
Phi, Kappa Alpha Theta, Delta Kappa
Epsilon, Kappa Alpha, Kappa Sigma,
Kappa Kappa Gamma, and Sigma Chi;
Bent will handle Delta Gamma, Phi
Delta Theta, Delta Upsilon, Alpha Sigma
Phi, Beta Theta Pi. Chi Omega. Phi
Kappa Sigma, Zeta Psi, and Sigma
Kappa.
At present the University of Washing
ton has started the organization of var
sity and freshmen crews, and has chal
lenge! the Cardinal to races. Califor
nia's crew policy is up in the air, but
with Stanford back in the sport the
Berkeley institution will probably vote
to go in for the sport. At any rate
Stanford is certain of strong competi
tion from the northern university Cali
fornia has practically been out of the
running in crew for the last eleven
years, and the race for supremacy in the
west has been between Stanford and
Washington.
Stanford crews have been the pride
of the University. In the spring of 1916
Stnnford was close second to Cornell
a* Poughkeepsie in the race for national
championships. The cardinal eights have
been East on other occasions, and have
.acquitted themselves with glory.
This year an excellent eight should be
developed. Rogers, captain-elect of the
Varsity, is one of the strongest oars
ever turned out here. Watts, from the
'17 Varsity, is a power, and Williamson,
from the freshmen three years ago, will
help along. In addition to these men,
Davis, Swift and McGilvray of the 1920
eight are in college. With these men as
a nucleus, possibilities are excellent for
a strong crew.
