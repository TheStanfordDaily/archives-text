News that crew will be resumed if it can obtain the proper financial sup
port from the student body sends a thrill through all acquainted with the past
glories of the Cardinal. The memory of Poughkeepsie is still fresh in the
minds of many Stanford men and women of the present generation. In that
event the prestige of Stanford, already high throughout the East, rose to a
height never before attained by a western university. The name of Stanford,
noted for its purpose, equipment, and high academic standards, became also
famous for the qualities of muscle and spirit which brought the crew to the
edge of the American chimpionship.
Unfortunately, however, the nature of crew is such that it is practically
impossible to make the sport self-supporting. In normal years the profits
from other student body activities should be enough to offset the losses of the
water sport. Until financial conditions have returned completely to normal,
which may be several years, the alternatives will be a crew supported by
other sources than Associated Students' funds and no crew at all. The Stan
ford spirit will not let crew die.
