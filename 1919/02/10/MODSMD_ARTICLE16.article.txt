### 
Professor lan B. Stoughton Houghton
of Oxford University expressed deep in
terest in the Ram's Head musical extrav
aganza that is to he given on the night
before Washington's birthday, when he
lectured here a short time ago. The por
trayal of both the female and male roles
by male actors in "Biff! Bang!! Bull
sheveek!!!" was the source of interest
to the professor, since it is a reversion
to the classical mode of dramatic pre
sentation employed by the Greeks and
the actors of the Elizabethan period.
"The portrayal of female characters."
said Professor Houghton in a conversa
tion with Milton Abel lfagen, the author
of the play, "calls for the finest sort of
acting. In one of Shakespeare's come
dies a male actor portrays the role of a
woman who disguises herself a a man
To play such a part calls for dramatic
skill (if the highest type.
'.T am deeply interested in the activi
ties of your society, since it reverts to
the early classical drama."
In "Biff Bang!! Bulsheveek!!!"
there are several roles of female imper
sonation which call for unusually good
acting, since the parts are not of the or
dinary burlesque type, hcncc the stu
dents of the drama as well as the "tired
business man" type will find features ot
great interest in the Ram's Head play.
Scats go on sale at the Bookstore and
at Robinson's and Crandall's next Thurs
day, and it is predicted that the tickets
will be sold out at an early hour.
