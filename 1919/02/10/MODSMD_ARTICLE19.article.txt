# CAMP FREMONT NOW WRECKING BUILDINGS
## 
### 
The wrecking of Camp Fremont is
now going ahead with full force. All
the buildings, save those of the quar
termaster warehouses and those in its
vicinity, must be off the ground by
March, and the land restored to its
original state, according to the terms
of the government lease.
The camp is now a quartermaster
sub-depot, the zone supply office being
at Fort Mason. From there supplies
and equipment are distributed and re
quistioned throughout the United
States, Philippines, and Hawaii. There
are now on hand at the sub-depot over
6,500 gas masks, of which no disposi
tion has as yet been made, although
experiments are being made as to
their efficiency in mining. Of the lum
ber, around seventy carloads are to be
shipped to Fort Mason, some 1,000
tent floors being retained to be used
at the Presidio in demobilization.
The water, gas and sewer system
is to remain intact, but the eltctric
wiring will be removed. Most of the
roads, for which over 800 carloads of
gravel were brought, are to be torn
up and the gravel removed, in order
that the fields may be again used for
agricultural purposes.
The Red Cross House will be sold,
and the Liberty Theater, which was
erected from a portion of the proceeds
of the song festival, was sold for $600,
ahd is now being rapidly wrecked.
