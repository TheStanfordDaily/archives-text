# San Jose Quintet Defeats Freshmen
## San Jose High Team Gives Babes First Defeat of the Season 
### 
The freshman basketball squad was
defeated for the first time this season
last Friday night in the Encina gym
nasium, when the San Jose High
School team was victorious by a score
ol' 39 to 20. The defeat was not a
total surprise, because a close game
was anticipated with San Jose, which
is one of the best high school teams
iis the state. The freshmen will have
a return game with them in San Jose
next Wednesday afternoon.
The babes were outweighed by fif
teen pounds to a man. The team be
ing light and with no individual stars,
relied almost entirely on its perfect
teamwork. This teamwork seemed at
a loss Friday night, partly because of
a general slump of the players, and
partly because of the loss of Meade,
one of their forwards, who is eligible
for the varsity.
Coach Evans will probably give spe
cial attention to the freshman team
this week to get them in the prime of
condition for the 1922 Stanford-U. C.
basketball game, to be played in the
Encina gymnasium Saturday night,
February 15. The University of Cal
ifornia is laying more hopes of vic
tory with their freshmen than their
varsity.
Those playing for the frosh were:
Mangin, Neer, Davies, and Frank
heimer, forwards; Gerson, center;
Austin, Larson, Ileeder. and Holsten,
guards.
