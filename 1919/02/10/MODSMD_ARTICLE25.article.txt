# Stanford Men Play Rugby In France
## 
### 
Rugby hasn't lost its interest in
France, according to a letter just re
ceived from Sergeant Foster Weeks,
'20, who is now serving with a base
hospital unit in France. Weeks tells
of a game in which the California
boys played the champion Rugby team
of central and southern France, beat
ing the champions S to 6. The team
representing the Americans was com
posed of Stanford and California men,
with one or two other California men
Among the Stanford men Weeks
mentioned were "Red' Hauser, Sam
ple, Heron, Marks, Debenhan, Ostran
der and Darrah. The second try of
the game was made when Hauser
broke away for a run, passed to
Weeks, then to Downe, and finally to
Heron, who carried the ball across the
| line.
I Just before the game the boys got
I together to see if they remembered
I any of the Stanford yells, and as a re-
I suit gave the spectators the benefit of
i tlie famous "give 'em the ax" with
; such pep that some of the Frenchmen
hurried up to find out if a scrap was
imminent.
Weeks did not mention just when
1 lie boys expected to return, but it it
presumed that it will not be for sev
eral months, as they are swamped
with work.
