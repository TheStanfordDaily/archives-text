# ST. MARY'S GOES DOWN BEFORE THE CARDINAL FIVE
## FINAL SCORE 44 TO 20 Stanford Hopes Look Good For Winning California-Nevada Championship 
### 
Stanford gained another hold on the
much-coveted California-Nevada Bas
ketball League title last Saturday night
when the St. Mary's five went down to
defeat before the Varsity 44 to 20. The
Cardinal men outplayed their opponents
at every stage of the game. Had it not
been for Ritchie on the St. Mary's team,
who shot six baskets from the center of
the floor, the count would have been
greater in favor of the Stanford team.
Last Saturday's game demonstrated
an important fact, namely, Stanford's
guards work so well together that a
team opposing them cannot expect to
make points under the basket. They
must depend on long shots. Such was
the case in the Y. M. I. game, the Davis
Farm contest, the Santa Clara game and
in the St. Mary's battle. If the Varsity
can keep up this style of play, Califor
nia will not win the series, for not team
can pile up a score on long shots.
Coach Evans was forced to use Esgen
at forward in the game Saturday, but!
this forcing was a lucky thing, for the!
long forward played a stellar game. He
rang up two baskets and worked into'
the team play in fine style.
Righter was on deck with his usual
powerful offensive work. He made nine j
baskets, and held the St. Mary's center
down to no score. Hood at forward
with Esgen was at top form. He made j
six baskets and shot nine fouls for a :
total of 21 points.
California. College of Pacific, and the
University of Nevada are the only teams i
left in the league at present that Stan- j
ford has not defeated. The latter two I
fives should prove easy for the Cardinal, |
