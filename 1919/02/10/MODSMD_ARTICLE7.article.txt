Pledges for the United War Work
Campaign which was sonducted here by
the Y. M. C. A. and Y. W. C. A. last
quarter are now payable, and money
should be sent to the associations on or
before March 5, which was set as the
date for making all payments.
To date, there is a total of $4,500 in
outstanding pledges, the greater part of
which is due from the men. The
amount netted by the drive was $12,035,
and of this sum $7,550 has been paid.
This is divided as follows: Women
$1,740, men $1,189, faculty $.3213. friends
$1344. and miscellaneous sources $65.
The prevailing idea that the Y. M. C.
A. has a surplus of two or three millions
is entirely misleading, according to A. E.
Worthy, the local secretary at Stanford.
The facts are that the "Y" used up all
its available funds by January Ist and
has been forced to borrow five millions
so that it could continue its work. In
order to take care of this debt it is ab
solutely necessary that all pledges be
paid as soon as possible. Collectors will
be appointed for each living group on
the campus, and the money can be paid
either f o them or in the association's
rooms at the Women's Club House and
Stanford Union. Checks may be mailed
directly to R. L. Green, the local treas
urer of the Y M. C. A.
