# RUDOLPH GANZ PLEASES WITH HIS ORIGINALITY
## 
### 
Showing a perfect technique, a clear
cut tone and great emotion, controlled
however, ajt all times by a fine neutrality
Rudolph Ganz, the great Swiss pianist
made his first appearance before a Stan
ford audience Friday night.
In its healthy and sane interpretation,
his music reflected the bigness of his
native mountain country. His playing
was unaffected and clear, without mor
bity. At the same time it was not lack
ing in dramatic force or in tenderness.
His active work, as shown by the
range of his entire program, was won
derful. With great power lie made the
piano sing or storm at will. His light
playing in the third and fourth num
bers, made up of groups of short pieces,
was sparkling in brilliancy, and there
seemed to be no limit to his speed.
Interpreted with an individual style
and forcefulness of character, probably
the most pleasing number on Ganz's pro
gram was the sonata in P. minor by
Chopin. The four movements displayed
the wonderful versatility that has done
much to extend his fame.
His playing throughout showed spon
taneity and interest strength. His read
ings were entirely free from arbitrary
affectation and exaggerated sentimen
tality. He worked his compositions out
in a logical manner and with a modest
sincerity that carried absolute convic
tion to his audience. He produced emo
tion in others but at the same time gov
erned it in himself.
