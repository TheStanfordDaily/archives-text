# HAPHAZZARD GOVERNMENT
## 
### 
The action of the associated students' government in postponing elections for
a week is startling, to say the least. Article V, Section 1, of the A. S. S. U. Con
stitution provides in part: "Regular elections for the election of members of the
Student Council, as provided in Article 11, Section 1, shall be held on the first
Wednesday in June and the second Wednesday in February. All nominations
shall be mailed to the chairman of the election board and shall be published in
the Daily Palo Alto not later than the second day preceding the election." The
second Wednesday in February, 1919, is February 13, and the second day preced
ing the election was Monday, February 11, as all not disposed to quarrel with the
calendar will admit. Nominations for members of the Student Council, and,
according to suggestion, class officers, were made to the chairman of the election
board and published in the Daily Palo Alto. Now the announcement is made that
the election will be postponed for a week, because of the lack of interest shown in
the nominations.
That there was a deplorable lack of interest shown in the nominations is only
too true. The student body didn't seem to wake up to the situation, and in sev
eral cases nominations had to be forced to get any candidates for the offices at all.
Everyone will admit that it is a public benefit to postpone the nominations and
election. Thus the question is squarely brought up whether or not the constitu
tion should be broken if in the interest of better government.
Breaking constitutions is bad business outside of Central America, dnd leads
eventually to having no constitutions to break. And a constitution was never
broken except with the excuse that it was done for the public benefit. And it is
especially dangerous when it is done by a small number who decide what is the
public benefit. In the present case, the Daily thinks postponing the elections will
meet with popular approval. But to make the matter legal a mass meeting or
some form of concerted student action should be held to sanction, as far as possi
ble, the illegality of today's action.
