# TRACK MEN TO MEET FRIDAY AFTERNOON
## 
### 
Captain C. S. Teitsworth has called a
meeting for Friday afternoon at 4
o'clock, in the lecture room of Encina
gymnasium, of all candidates for the
freshman and varsity track squads. E.
R. Caughey, track captain-elect for 1918.
and Coach Evans will speak.
It is the intention of Captain Teits
worth to start lecture work on condition
before actual practice is begun. Incle
ment weather during the last few days
has prevented any practice on the track.
It is imperative that all candidates be at
the meeting Friday.
