# Elisha Brooks Is to Speak Tonight
## Lecturer Will Tell Narrative of Pioneer Days of America 
### 
Tonight in the Little Theater an old
man—nearly 80 years of age—will tell
a story of history and adventure that
promises to be of unusual interest to
every member of the University.
"Crossing the plains" now is not a
rare occurrence and is not fraught with
hardship. But how different was the
case when the pioneer of 1852 drove a
lumbering ox cart over the rolling
swells of the eastern praries and
through the mountain passes of three
great ranges. For a woman to attempt
this perilous trip with her five small
children was a feat that took all of the
courage and fortitude characteristic of
the American pioneer woman.
Elisha Brooks was one of the five chil
dren that a courageous mother took
across the continent in the days when
buffalo and Indians roamed the Middle
West. The narrative he will tell is one
of consuming interest; he is possibly the
last living man in the United States who
is lecturing on this early day history.
The speaker has given the story in vari
ous places throughout the country, and
everywhere he has been spoken of with
unusual appreciation.
