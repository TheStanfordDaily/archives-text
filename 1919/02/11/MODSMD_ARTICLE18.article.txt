# JUNIOR PROM TO BE NOVEL FUNCTION
## 
### 
This year's Junior Prom promises to
be a real prom in every sense of the
word, if the present plans of the com
mittee go through. At a meeting held
last night it was decided to provide
something entirely new and distinctive
in the decorative line, which it is said
will outshine anything ever produced at
Stanford. The Prom is to be held in
Encina gym and will be, as before the
war, formal. Tickets will cost $5.
Definite plans were also made in re
gard to the music to be furnished. Al
though the committee refused to divulge
any of these plans, it has been learned
that the musical portion of the evening's
entertainment will be looked after by
outside talent. The committee say at
any rate it will be "something entirely
different."
