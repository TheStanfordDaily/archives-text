Daily Palo Alto Success
Cited by Eastern Paper
If any one fails to see why Leland
Stanford Junior University is so for
tunate as to be able to issue a first
class daily in addition to other papers,
let him glance over the advertising
columns of the Daily Palo Alto and
the mystery is unraveled. The Stan
ford papers are a credit to the insti
tution and one of the best advertise
ments it has. â€”Indiana Student.

Quad Costs Discussed
The cost of producing "The Stan
ford Quad" will be $1750. This sum
covers the publication of 850 copies.
From this fact it can be seen that the
'95 annual will cost a little over two
dollars per copy, though it will prob
ably be yold at one dollar per copy.
Last year the class of '94 at the
University of California found it neces
sary to levy an assessment, it is said,
of .$l4 per capita upon members of
the class in order to emerge success
fully from their undertaking.

Examiner Offers $100 for
Oratorical Contest
The San Francisco Examiner has
offered $100 in gold to the winner
of an oratorical contest between the
U. C. and Stanford. A joint commit
tee of six, three from each university,
is to decide upon the details. A com
mittee of three will probably be ap
pointed at the next meeting of the
Associated Students to challenge
Berkeley upon the publication of the
Examiner's offer in its own columns,
and to make all arrangements accord
ing to the conditions named by the
Examiner.

Giee Club Serenades Roble
There is nothing more delightful
than an evening serenade by a well
trained chorus. Glee Club stock has
risen appreciably in Roble since last
night's serenade.
*******
The Roble Club launched its new
boat on Lagunita Saturday afternoon,
amid characteristic ceremonies. The
boat was christened "Freyja."
