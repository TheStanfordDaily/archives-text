# Second Assembly of Year Tomorrow
## Jean Alcide Picard Will Speak on "The Spirit of France" 
### 
Tomorrow morning at 11 o'clock the
second assembly of the present quar
ter will be held in the Assembly Hall,
at which Lieutenant Jean Alcide Pic
ard will speak on "The Spirit of
France." Considerable interest should
be evinced by the men and women
ot' the University on account of the
few assemblies which have been held
during the entire year. Mr. Picard is
an unusual speaker, according to the
statement which has been received
from Mr. A. M. Souby, educational di
rector. Southwestern Department, of
the United States Army, who says:
"It is the opinion of all who have
heard him. headquarters staff included,
that Mr. Picard is possibly the finest
influence that has come to any of our
camps. He seems to be the incarna
tion of the spirit of France and 110 one
can listen to him without, the deepest
emotion and pride that we are asso
ciated with such an ally. All he says
ir, reinforced by the background of
Christian experience."
J. Courtney Anderson, general camp
secretary of the Y. M. C. A. at Camp
McArthur, Texas, in speaking of Mr.
Picard, states that in his opinion "110
man of greater energy, enthusiasm
and intelligence has come to us since
my coming to the camp. He was en
thusiastically received in all of the
meetings and made a deep impress
upon the minds of those who heard
him."
Lieutenant Picard has spent most of
bis time, since he was put on the list
for inactive service on account of
wounds received, touring the United
States. He has visited practically all
of the camps in the East and in the
South, where he has spoken to the
men on the problems which appeared
to be the most vital at the time and
which concerned the relation of
France to the United States. All of
the press comment has been very
favorable and Professor L. E. Rassett
considers the University unusually
fortunate in being able to hear such a
speaker as Mr. Picard promises to be.
As a well-known writer and lec
turer, Mr. Picard will be able to give
his experiences at the battles of Ypres
and the Marne in such a graphic man
ner that the spirit of France may
really be appreciated to a fuller extent
than is usual with the average speaker
who lacks the training which Mr.
Picard has had. Mr. Picard is inter
ested in the social and educational
aspects of the war and is particularly
interested in the effect the war will
have in the matter of religion.
