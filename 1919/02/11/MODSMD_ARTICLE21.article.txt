# INTERCLASS BOXERS TO MEET NEXT WEEK
## Will Be Followed Later by Bouts With Olympic Club 
### 
Boxing artists will hold the first in
ter-class tournament of the season one
week from next Friday, when many of
the old team men as well as the younger
lights will once again step into the ring
for honors. The meet will be just pre
vious to the first bout of the year, when
the boys on the Farm will probably com
pete for ribbons with the San Francisco
Olympic Club. However, at the present
time it would be highly inadvisable, ac
cording to Coach Murphy, to have the
home boys meet the Olympic Club's
speedy aggregation, until they have
rounded into perfect condition. With
two more weeks hard workout, Stan
ford's boxing speedsters should be able
to handle any of her opponents in good
style.
In the light-weight class, Fcnnelson
is showing up remarkably "Veil, and in
all events will be one of the mainstays
of the team. Neer is making a name
for himself in the feather-weight class
Besides these men, there are many oth
ers who are coming along in fine shape,
which indicates a winning season for
the Cardinal in the wrestling world.
