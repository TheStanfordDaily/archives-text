# DEBATING SOCIETIES WILL MEET TONIGHT
## 
### 
A protest has been registered by the
University of Southern California
against the question, 'Resolved, that
the United States government should
establish a corporation for the utili
zation of surplus labor," which was
submitted by Stanford for the annual
debate. They propose, instead, a dis
cussion of the retaining of the rail
roads by the federal government.
Coach McClintock hopes, however, by
rcphrazing the original question to
mould a proposition that will suit the
southern university.
The Euphronia Debating Society,
under President P. P. Erickson, will
discuss these questions tonight in
Room 12 of the Law building. Eu
phronia will also take up the matter
of pins for the club, and will discuss
plans for a new typo of parliamentary
work in the future.
Nestoria, in Room 90, will conduct
tonight an argument on the proposi
tion that immigration to the United
States should be restricted for four
years. The affirmative will be upheld
by W. C. Fundenburg, '19. and the
negative by A. T. Albouze, '20.
