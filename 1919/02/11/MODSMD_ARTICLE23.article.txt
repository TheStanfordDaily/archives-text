The outlook tor aerial commerce in
the United States the subject of an
article in the New Republic for Feb
ruary 1, written by Frank E. Hill, in
structor in the English department.
Mr. Hill, who has been in the aviation
service during the war, says that cer
tain types of business are already
eagerly considering air commerce, the
advantages to be gained in some cases
being cheapness and in others in
creased safety.
The most immediate demand for air
plane service, Mr. Hill thinks, is that
for passenger-carrying. "The airplane
goes at from two to three times the
speed of the passenger train. If one
service will work twice as fast as an
other, it is worth twice as much in
these times, and most cautious ob
servers say air service can be run for
less than double the cost of railroads.'
Germany, although said to be in the
throes of revolution, is already run
ning mail and passenger airplanes. In
the United States, Captain Lipsner,
formerly manager of aerial mail route,
announces an inter-city passenger
service to be put at public disposal
May 15.
The United States is eighteen
months behind Great Britain, Mr. Hill
writes. "Today the British Air Min
istry is professedly engaged in com
pleting a full set of regulations for
aerial traffic, while our Congress, tem
porarily supreme authority on aero
nautical matters, sits inert before the
situation."
