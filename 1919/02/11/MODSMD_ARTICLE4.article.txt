# CAMPUS IS BACKING UP CAMPAIGN FOR CREW
## LIVING GROUPS COMING THROUGH WELL Crew Jolly-Up Being Planned for Second Friday in April 
### 
Evidence that the campus is squarely
behind the campaign to raise $1000 for
the crew during the season was furnished
today when the lirst three living groups
to report their totals to date showed a
total of $1 for each man in he group.
Since there are some fourteen hundred
students in college, if this record is kept
up, the drive will go over the top.
To boost the crew and all other spring
athletics, a rally will be held in Encina
Hall Friday night at 7:15. "Husky"
Guerena, crew coach for the last five
years, and Leland Cutler, at present head
of the Alumni Association, and member
of the Board of Control of Athletics,
will be on hand as speakers.
The crew jolly-up planned by the com
mittee in charge will he held Friday,
April 11. the earliest possible date next
quarter. The place where the dance will
be held has not been selected as yet.
W. C. Bent,, '19, has been selected by
the old crew men in college as crew
manager. A petition was drawn up by
the crew committee this afternoon to be
presented to the Board of Athleic Con
rol, urging he continuance of the crew
at the University, and calling attention to
the fact that the students arc so much
in favor of the sport that they propose
to finance it themselves.
In order to reach all commuters, Bent,
L. C. Rogers and F. Watts divided these
students between themselves today, and
will try to reach each one.
The first results of the campaign will
be published in the Daily Palo Alto to
morrow. The complete sum bf money
raised will be given out in the rally Fri
day night, when the campaign closes for
the present quarter.
