# Failure of League of Nations Predicted
## Professor V.J. West Feels Opposition in U.S. to Peace Plan 
### S. P. Housings worth, '20 
With the skies emptying buckets of
water throughout tihe day yesterday,
and with the general dampness pervad
ing. certain quarters of the University
buildings were found more acceptable for
indoor athletics than others.
It was in such a corner of the "Econ"
building that 1 found Prof. Victor J.
West, long after quitting time for him.

his door so that he could wade through
the sawdust and water to safety.
1 had been trying for the past week
to get him to disclose some predictions
on the past, present and future of the
League of Nations, and from such a
trying situation as this he could not
very readily escape.
"There is a strong opposition to a
League of Nations in this country," lie
said. I was convinced at this utterance
of the professor's frame of mind. But he
continued, "No one knows this better
than President Wilson himself. It is
something more than mere political oppo
sition. There is a strong reactionary
group opposed to the plan, although men
like William Howard Taft. F.lihu Root
and Governor McCall of Massachusetts
favor its adoption as a means of pre
venting tuturc wars.
"When ex-President Taft, President
Lowell of Harvard and other prominent
men and women have spoken for the
idea as they expect to do in the next
few weeks, and when the President has
addressed the American people in the
ten big cities of the country, there isn't
likely to be any opposition to the League
of Nations. This first group of speakers
will clear the way for the President, who
will come along later an ddrive home
any of the points that arc left on the
surface which might tear our clothes.
"The Presiden is a very convincing
speaker. He talks so that everyone can
understand him, nad when he finishes
there isn't much that remains to be said
on the subject." ,
• 1 asked Mr. West if he thought a
satisfactory form of government can be
made from the League of Nations idea.
"No doubt the machinery for a League
of Nations can be devised," he said,
"but getting the nations to accept that
machinery will be a different matter.
The senac in this country may not satify
the treaty unless it is assured that the
nation as a whole supports it."
Many examples for the commissioners
in France may be drawn from our own
experiences in constitution making, Mr.
West believes. When our citizens are
called on to defray the expenses of run
ning this league, there is likely to be
more serious bucking than there is at
presen.t
One of the chief difficulties in colonial
times was raising money to support a
standing army and pay bills for the cen
tral government. This is likely to be
the major argument of the conservative
opposition in attacking the plan. The
people may not want to pay for main
taining a capital somewhere in Europe
or for keeping an army in all parts of the
world.
Mr. West expressed surprise that the
smaller countries are to be admitted
with the same vote as the larger. This
is going to be a real bone of conten
tion, he thinks.
