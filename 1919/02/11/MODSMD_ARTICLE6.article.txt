# STANFORD QUINTET TO MEET PACIFIC TOMORROW NIGHT
## 
### 
The Stanford varsity quintet will take
the floor tomorrow night against the
College of the Pacific at San /ose. This
will be the fourth game of the Califor
nia-Nevada intercollegiate series.
The Cardinal team should have no
trouble in disposing of the San Jose
team as it is considered one of the weak
est fives in the league. The game will
give Coach Evans an opportunity to
work out some of the newer men who
may be needed in the California series.
California will meet Santa Clara to
night in a league contest, and out
come of this game should give some real
indication of the strength of the team
from across the bay. This is the first
time that California has gone up against
one of the stronger teams of the league.
Catighey, Lilly and Williamson will
make the trip tomorrow night as guards.
Esgen, Moulton, Hood. Meade. Lciser
and Ormsby will also go to the Pacific
game and will probably all get a work
out at forward. Righter will be at his
usual place at center.
Coach Evans now considers Esgen as
one of the best prospccts on the quad.
He is one'of the most accurate shots on
the team, but is a little weak on defen
sive work.
The Stanford guards a:v doing their
share of defensive work, and it will be
necessary for the forwards to stop the
long shots like those made by Ritchie
of St. Mary's in Saturday's game. Symes
of California is particularly dangerous
in this respect.
Stanford freshmen will meet the San
Jose high school tomorrow afternoon.
The varsity game is scheduled to be held
at 8 o'clock.
