# NOMINATIONS REOPENED FOR STUDENT COUNCIL AND CLASS OFFICERS

### 
Postponement of all student body and
class elections until next Wednesday,
February 19, was made today by an
order issued by J. K. Lilly, '19, president

publicity concerning the election was
given as the reason for the delay.

the new election methods, where all
student body and class elections are to

publicity concerning the nominations was
given out until Friday, and as nomina
tions closed Monday there was not
enough time for them to be made.
Nominations for all class offices and
for junior and sophomore representa

open, according to the announcement by
President Lilly, and may be made to the
chairman of the Election Board, C. S.
Long. '19, any time before 1:30 p. m.
Monday, February 17. They should be

Postponement of all student body and
class elections until next Wednesday,
February 19, was made today by an
order issued by J. K. Lilly, '19, president
of the Associated Students. Lack of
publicity concerning the election was
given as the reason for the delay.
Many students were not familiar with
the new election methods, where all
student body and class elections are to
be held at the same poles on the same
day, and as a result most of the class
offices would have gone by default. No
publicity concerning the nominations was
given out until Friday, and as nomina
tions closed Monday there was not
enough time for them to be made.
Nominations for all class offices and
for junior and sophomore representa
tives on the Student Council are again
open, according to the announcement by
President Lilly, and may be made to the
chairman of the Election Board, C. S.
Long. '19, any time before 1:30 p. m.
Monday, February 17. They should be
made directly to Long and not through
tiie Daily Palo Alto office.
A considerable increase of interest in
the elections is expected as a result of
the postponement, which will give the
students time to get together and think
over the candidates.
