# New Method Used in Joffre Debate
## "Future Colonial Policy of France" to Be Question for Discussion 
### 
A new method will be used this year
in the selection of the specific ques
tion for the Joffre debate. Coach Mc-
Clintock will request either Professor
Winans or some equally well-known
eastern authority 011 public speaking
to select a definite topic from the
general question, which is "The Fu
ture Colonial Policy of France." The
special question will be mailed to
President Wilbur, and will be opened
in the presence of representatives
from the two Universities at 6 o'clock
on the night of the debate.
Heretofore a committee of repre
sentatives from California and Stan
ford has met and selected the specific
question between 4 and 6 o'clock in
♦he afternoon of the contest. This
has led frequently to encroachment
on the time of the debators, as was
the case last year when the question
was not given to the speakers till
0:45 p.m.
It is hoped that the French consul
jit San Francisco will preside over the
argument, as Coach McClintock will
extend him an invitation.
The squad has not yet entered into
intensive training for the coming con
test. but is merely making a general
survey of the field to be covered. It
will be seriously handicapped in the
tuture by the loss of Miss Margaret
Shedd, '20, who has been forced to
give up her position because of urgent
academic work. Miss Shedd has been
prominent in debating circles since
her freshman year, and was consid
ered one of the strongest members
of the squad.
The California squad has not yet
been selected, tryouts being an
nounced for March 4.
