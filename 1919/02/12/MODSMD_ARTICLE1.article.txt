# LIEUT. PICARD SPEAKS BEFORE LARGE ASSEMBLY
## TOPIC IS THE REBIRTH OF FRANCE Substantial League of Nations is Advocated by France, He Says 
### 
"We are the sons and daughters of
those men who went to war in 1870
and because they were defeated in that
war we arc to win this war that our
children may live in peace and happi
ness." This was the statement of Lieu
tenant Jean Alcide Picard, who spoke at
the assembly ibis morning in the As
sembly Hall on the "Spirit of France."
In discussing the League of Nations and
the work of the peace conference, he
said:
"A League of Nations —certainly!
France ratified that idea in 1905 in both
houses of the Chamber of Deputies. A
League of Nations—certainly, but that
league must be built upon something
practical and substantial so that if one
nation goes crazy all of the others may
be strong enough to sit upon her. Ger
many went crazy on the subject of
militarism, and because her insanity was
a disease there is a cure. Until that
cure is affected, however, Germany has
no place at the peace table. The peace
must be a just one and it cannot be a
charitable one."
Mr. Picard dates the rebirth of the
spirit of France from the year 1894.
when France first realized that there
was something else in the world besides
the material interest of the nation and
the sacred character of the army, and
that something was justice. Our knowl
edge of France in 1914 was the France
previous to 1870. We judged France
on the court of life of the nineteenth
century and not upon the facts of to
day. The war has given us a new
viewpoint on the matter which must
lead to a more sympathetic understand
ing between the two nations.
As the one big factor in the spirit of
France, Mr. Picard emphasized the im
portance of compulsory military service.
Discipline is the crying need of the
age. "Discipline in the army is team
work in civil life," he said. "We can
not speak of our rights until we are
ready to assume our duties."
The assembly closed with the singing
of "1 fail, Stanford, 1 fail."
