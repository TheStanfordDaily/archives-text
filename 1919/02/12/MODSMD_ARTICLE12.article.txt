Today's issue marks the end of Volume 54 of the Daily Palo Alto. It has
been at once the most unusual and the most trying period the paper has had
to go through in its whole varied career. Begun while the fate of the world
was still undecided, and while Stanford, in khaki, was preparing to do more
than its bit in that decision, it has seen swords turned into plowshares, and
"puts" and leggings changed for cords. Judged by peacetime journalistic
standards of the campus, Volume 54 has been surpassed by many former
volumes; judged by the spirit and the energy of the staff it is unequaled.
For it is 110 easy work to get out a college daily, even under the most
promising conditions, and the Daily Palo Alto was one of the few college pub
lications which did not suspend publication during the S. A. T. C. Then the
work of thirty was done by ten. That a paper came out at all was due to the
faithfulness and untiring diligence of last quarter's staff, whose work cannot
be too highly commended.
For the past six weeks the work has been of reconstruction; now the
reorganization of the staff has been almost completed and preparations made
for extensive improvements in the paper and a considerable widening of its
scope. Under able guidance and management, the immediate future of the
paper should see it brought to the highest plane of college journalism.
With a final word of thanks to the men and women who kept the paper
alive, ends Volume 54.
