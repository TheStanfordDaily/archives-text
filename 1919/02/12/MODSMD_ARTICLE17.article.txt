Carruth of the English department of
the University has turned off a new
poem—an optimistic gem—which has
attracted much attention. It is as fol

BE NOT AERAID
All creation lias travailed together
To bring the great Present to birth,
With no faltering May-be or Whether,
The Kingdom of Heaven on Earth ;
It is ours; let us follow the vision
Lest we perish, as Solomon said;
And go forward with dauntless decision
Of the average man unafraid.
What wonder, when palaces totter,
When war-lords and tsars turn to
clay,
When privilege pulps like a blotter
And titles and charters decay,
I-. the coronet wearer of profit
Grow needlessly nervous with dread
Lest Demos compel him to doff it
And don a red nightcap instead.
This war is the end of the error
That Earth was designed for the Few,
The end of the tenure of terror;
The deed to the world is made new.
Wo are blind if we stop with the Kaiser,
While we practice our burdens to
shirk;
To begin at the bottom were wiser
And condemn all who live without
work.
World-ruin, il seems to the spoiler,
To the prophet a new age begun;
For the burden-hearer and toiler
\rc taking their place in the sun.
So fear not, though palaces totter
And the scheme of the past is un
made ;
The same voice that stilled Galilee's
water
Calms the tempest now: Be not
afraid!
Wiu-iam Herbert Carruth.
