# Varsity Five to Play College of Pacific Tonight
## 
### 
Stanford varsity basketball players
will meet the College of the Pacific at
San Jose tonight in their fourth attempt
to climb toward the top of the Califor
nia -Nevada Intercollegiate League The
freshmen team played the San Jose
High School this afternoon.
The varsity should have no trouble in
disposing of the Pacific team as it is
not one of the strong contenders in the
league. Coach Evans will play about
two teams in the game in order to give
newer men experience for the Califor
nia series.
Several members of the varsity five
went to Santa Clara last night to see
the Missionites and the Blue and Gold
team mix, but the game was not played
as the lighting system in Santa Clara
failed about 8 o'clock.
Californians were confident that they
would be able to defeat any team that
Stanford could put out, and arc bank
ing strongly on taking all honors in the
big scries. Coach Evans, however, is
just as confident that his proteges will
come through with a brand of basket
ball that will spring many surprises for
the Bruins.
