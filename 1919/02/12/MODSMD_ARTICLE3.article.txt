# Proving That Music is Not Always Music

### 
Night shrouded the landscape as two
sylvan figures hurried up the row last
night. A cloud hid the moon and an
air of profound mystery thrilled the
senses as these two knights of the dusk
sped on their way tow;ird the Pi Phi
house. Suddenly a clear note of celes
tial music rang out, startling the atmos
phere and causing the moon to peep
forth to sec the cause. Again the soft,
melodious strains of Chopin's waltz re
verberated in the atmosphere and then
was followed by a moment of silence
as hurried figures in the Pi Phi house
rushed to the windows to learn the
cause of this weird performance. The
two noble creatures from whom these
sounds were proceeding proved to be
our heroes of the darkness, and the Pi
Phis breathed gasps of relief as they
learned the end of the world had not
come. The question that now purturbs
thoir peaceful quiet is, "Could this real
ly have been love?"
