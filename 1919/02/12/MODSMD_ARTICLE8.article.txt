# SPEAKS LAST NIGHT AT LITTLE THEATER
## Times Tried Hearts of the Stoutest," Said the Speaker 
### 
Telling a graphic tale of trials, of
hunger and thirst, of storms and
floods encountered, of escapes from
death at the hands of the Indians and
of the final arrival of the little party
of a mother and six children in the
"Golden West —the land of promise,"
an old man whose head was white
with age, held the close attention of
an audience that crowded the Little
Theater last evening.
"What the wilderness meant in 1
those «lays you can hardly compre
hend now," said Mr. Brooks. "You
call but dimly realize that from the
Missouri to the Sacramento not a
white man dwelt. It required stout
hearts to stem this tide and it took
all of my mother's fortitude to push
alone into the wilderness, casting her
self and six little children on the
mercy of the Indians and the pesti
lence of the prairies."
The lecturer explained that the fath
er had come "West" two years pre
vious, and in order to join him the
mother disposed of all they had in
Michigan and started on the long trail
from New England to California. Buy
ing an ox cart and several teams of
oxen the little party began the jour
ney that was to them over 2800
j miles of prairies and mountains. The
family made its way along the south
ern shore of Lake Michigan and
! crossed the Mississippi on a small
! ferry, arriving after several weeks in
| lowa, where they were all taken down
! with the measles. From there they
made their way to Council Bluffs,
j which was then the last outpost of civ
ilization. Up until the time they had
reached Council Bluffs they had been
traveling in company with several
other parties, but hearing the blood
curdling stories told by haggard and
I worn people returning from the desert,
many became afraid and returned. The
courageous mother, however, deter
mined to go on, and although deserted
b> her teamster who had been driv
ing the ox cart for her, decided to
push on alone, where a new home in
the West awaited her coming.
"It was a time to try men's souls,"
said the speaker. "In one day's drive
of fourteen miles we passed twenty
two new-made graven, marked with a
board and showing that the cholera
was raging over the prairies. The
trail was marked with ruin from this
on," he continued. "Almost every day
we met parties returning home with
pitiful tales of massacre, hunger and
pestilence."
Mr. Brooks said that the worn little
party struggled on slowly, meeting
with one party and another, and some
times traveling several weeks in com
pany wtih other settlers. He ex
plained how the Indians often hung
on their trail for days, and how at
night the wagons were picketed in a
circle and a guard posted. But. the
old ox team and six ragged children
with their mother could not keep the
pace of the other travelers and sooner
or later always watched their friends

go on ahead. Finally, after enduring
the strain of the long journey and the
poor feed in many places, four of the
oxen died and cows were yoked in
their place. Finally the cows died,
and the remaining oxen were just able
to drag their rattling skeletons on
ward. Everything except absolute ne
cessities were cast aside, and even
the ox cart changed for a lighter one
from the plentiful supply that lined
the emigrant trail. Then one night,
with the Sierra mountains in sight,
the last bit of flour and the last slice
of bacon were eaten. At this critical
stage they were met by the father,
who had ridden 300 miles to meet
them, bringing a supply of food in his
saddle bags. Just six months to a day
from the time the journey had begun
the reunited family crossed the Sierras
and reached the West —California.

courageous mother, however, deter
mined to go on, and although deserted
b> her teamster who had been driv
ing the ox cart for her, decided to
push on alone, where a new home in
the West awaited her coming.
"It was a time to try men's souls,"
said the speaker. "In one day's drive
of fourteen miles we passed twenty
two new-made graven, marked with a
board and showing that the cholera
was raging over the prairies. The
trail was marked with ruin from this
on," he continued. "Almost every day
we met parties returning home with
pitiful tales of massacre, hunger and
pestilence."
Mr. Brooks said that the worn little
party struggled on slowly, meeting
with one party and another, and some
times traveling several weeks in com
pany wtih other settlers. He ex
plained how the Indians often hung
on their trail for days, and how at
night the wagons were picketed in a
circle and a guard posted. But. the
old ox team and six ragged children
with their mother could not keep the
pace of the other travelers and sooner
or later always watched their friends

go on ahead. Finally, after enduring
the strain of the long journey and the
poor feed in many places, four of the
oxen died and cows were yoked in
their place. Finally the cows died,
and the remaining oxen were just able
to drag their rattling skeletons on
ward. Everything except absolute ne
cessities were cast aside, and even
the ox cart changed for a lighter one
from the plentiful supply that lined
the emigrant trail. Then one night,
with the Sierra mountains in sight,
the last bit of flour and the last slice
of bacon were eaten. At this critical
stage they were met by the father,
who had ridden 300 miles to meet
them, bringing a supply of food in his
saddle bags. Just six months to a day
from the time the journey had begun
the reunited family crossed the Sierras
and reached the West —California.
Telling a graphic tale of trials, of
hunger and thirst, of storms and
floods encountered, of escapes from
death at the hands of the Indians and
of the final arrival of the little party
of a mother and six children in the
"Golden West —the land of promise,"
an old man whose head was white
with age, held the close attention of
an audience that crowded the Little
Theater last evening.
"What the wilderness meant in 1
those «lays you can hardly compre
hend now," said Mr. Brooks. "You
call but dimly realize that from the
Missouri to the Sacramento not a
white man dwelt. It required stout
hearts to stem this tide and it took
all of my mother's fortitude to push
alone into the wilderness, casting her
self and six little children on the
mercy of the Indians and the pesti
lence of the prairies."
The lecturer explained that the fath
er had come "West" two years pre
vious, and in order to join him the
mother disposed of all they had in
Michigan and started on the long trail
from New England to California. Buy
ing an ox cart and several teams of
oxen the little party began the jour
ney that was to them over 2800
j miles of prairies and mountains. The
family made its way along the south
ern shore of Lake Michigan and
! crossed the Mississippi on a small
! ferry, arriving after several weeks in
| lowa, where they were all taken down
! with the measles. From there they
made their way to Council Bluffs,
j which was then the last outpost of civ
ilization. Up until the time they had
reached Council Bluffs they had been
traveling in company with several
other parties, but hearing the blood
curdling stories told by haggard and
I worn people returning from the desert,
many became afraid and returned. The
courageous mother, however, deter
mined to go on, and although deserted
b> her teamster who had been driv
ing the ox cart for her, decided to
push on alone, where a new home in
the West awaited her coming.
