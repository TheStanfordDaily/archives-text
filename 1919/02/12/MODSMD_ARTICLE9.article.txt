# AMERICAN FOOTBALL POLICY IS DECIDED BY THE ATHLETIC BOARD
## Stanford to Enter Pacific Coast Conference for Next Schedule HIGH PAID COACHING SYSTEMS WILL NOT BE USED IN NEWEST SPORT 
### 
American football, played along the same lines as other sports at
Stanford, will be a part of athletics here in the future as result of a
policy adopted by the Hoard of Control of Athletics last nigh, and ap
proved by the president today. No dual arrangements with California
will be made, but Stanford will apply to the Pacific Coast Conference
of which the I niversity is already a member, for a schedule in the
newest sport at Stanford.
Stanford's peculiar system of non-professional coaching which has
been used so successfully in track, Rugby, and other sports will be in
troduced into the American game. Rugby will not be discontinued, but
the Hoard of Control will endeavor to foster this game among the other
universities, because it has demonstrated its value as a form of exercise
for universities.
Following is the official statement given out through the president's
office regarding American football:

For many years Stanford University, under the guidance of
Dr. Angell and his fellow members of the Faculty Athletic Com
mittee. has been developing a schedule of athletics with the fol
lowing primary objects in view:
1. General physical development of the students.
2. Participation by all students in some form of athletic
exercises.
3. The development of a plan of healthy contests, both
intra- and extra-mural, that would harmonize with academic life
and ideals.
The Hoard of Athletic Control, representing equally the stu
dents, alumni and faculty, has been organized and it has now
completed plans for the control of the finances of the gymnasium
and of the various contests, and has put into effect a system of
instruction in sports that obviates most of the objections to the
intensive coaching system. All coaches appointed have the ap
proval of the president of the University, are on annual appoint
ment. and are not men confining themselves exclusively to one
game or one particular type of sport.
Stanford's ideals in athletics are now so well founded and
understood that it is the feeling of the Hoard of Athletic Control
that any form of legitimate sport can be conducted under them
without serious difficulty. Without in any way relaxing interest
in and enthusiasm for Rugby as a tyi>e of football particularly
well adapted to the colleges, they feel that they can now add
American football to the list of sports. In pursuance of this
plan, application will be made to the Pacific Coast Conference
Schedule Committee for games with various western institutions.
It is also probable that some of them can be interested in taking
up Rugby, since it has proven itself such a great flatural game.
There has recently been an exchange of letters between the
presidents of the two universities in regard to a common stand
ard for athletic arrangements at Stanford and the University of
California, but at present the local conditions are so different on
the two campuses that no uniform plan acceptable to both institu
tions could l»e decided upon. Hy mutual agreement there will be
in the future no dual arrangements with the University of Cali
fornia, but it is not improbable that the University of California
will apply through the conference for games with Stanford.

Dr. Wilbur lias also made public the
report of the faculty Committee 011 Ath
letics. upon which the Board of Control
has largely made its decision as to a
policy in athletics. Following is the text
of this report:
Stanford University, Cal..
December 19, 1918.
President R. L. Wilhur, Stanford Uni
versity.
Dear Dr. Wilbur: Experience has
shown that the following beneficial ef
fects may, and should, result to stu
dents in schools and colleges from ath
letic sports, rightly conducted:
1. Physical benefits —quarter of a
century ago regarded by academic au

thorities as the tnaiti or only benefit.
2. Recreation and enjoyment of sport
for sport's sake—which include a gener
ous satisfaction in winning from a wor
thy foe or of doing one's hest in a los
ing game
3. Knowledge of men and develop
ment of tact and consideration in deal
ing with one's fellows—regarded as the
chief benefit in English public schools.
4. As an outgrowth of the preceding,
the development of a sense of "fair
play"—the fundamental trait for citizens
of a democracy.
5. Development of powers of leader
ship.
6. Training in powers of enduring—
effort and "grit."
Together these" constitute what is
known as the "educational value" of
athletics.
Of these benefits tlie first and, to a
minor extent, the lust may be secure";
by gymnastic training; nothing, it would
seem, but competitive sport, so organized
and controlled as to bring its benefits
within the reach of the largest possible
number of students, can secure them all.
But competitive sport as organized in
most American colleges merely realizes
the last, and to a questionable extent the
firs' and that for a minority of the stu
dents only; the remaining benefits are
usually not rea'ized and are frequently
inverted into their opposites. Recreation
and enjoyment and the spirit of sport
for sport's sake have been drilled down
to vanishing point; fair play and a con
sideration for one's fellows have been
replaced by bitter and often unscrupu
lous partisanship; the development of
leadership has been atrophied; and
[throughout the entire country college
j sport has been commercialized.
The agencies leading up to this state
of affairs may be severally considered;
I practically they interact or coalesce. Two
I in particular may be emphasized:
1. The "big game." As it has existed
in the past, this has bulked largest in
the way of obstacles in bringing about
general participation in sport in the Uni
versity. Through its influence other
matches are regarded as practice games
and the players as "material." Major
sports in most universities have been
narrowed down to the drilling of rela
t'veK few men for intercollegiate games.
j Through insistent pressure the commit
! tee here has in a measure negatived this
j tendency, but the organic growth of the
spirit of general participation in the stu
dent body is not in itself strong enough
I for self-support, nor is it possible that
it should be under the big game regime.
Outcomes of this regime have been a
spirit of intense partisanship, a loss of
the spirit of sport for sport's sake, de
moralization of some players, and a
serious disturbance to academic work.
Big games which are a legitimate out
come of general participation and inter
est in a sport we commend; but a big
game which is the reason for the exist
ence of a sport we would abolish.
2. The coach. The existence of the
coach is bound up in the nature of the
big game; it is his reason for existence.
He is employed to train a team for an
intercollegiate game, and even where he
is personally broad-minded and in favor
of "general participation," the spirit of
the student body under the big game re
gime forces him into the position of a
special trainer for a few men. The
commercialization of sports has gone
hand in hand with the development of
the coach system, and it is the coach
who is generally responsible for the col
onizing and "inducing" of venal ath
letes. He is by all odds the most sinister
figure in amateur athletics and the
growth of sport for sport's sake is prac
tically incompatible with the presence of
the varsity team coach. Under the coach
system, team captaincies have been re
duced to merely formal honors, the de
velopment of leadership has been killed,
and university competition in games has
become a competition of coaches—most
ly hired. We are speaking, of course,
of the general situation throughout the
country.
By commercialization is not necessar
ily meant the corrupt use of gate receipts
derived from intercollegiate games : most
colleges have found it necessary to place
athletic business wholly or partly in the
hands of the faculty or business men. and
funds are commonly handled in a busi
ness-like way, the colonization of play
ers being usually brought about through
funds supplied by wealthy alumni. Com
mercialization has come in various ways:
through extravagant expenditure for
training and equipment, and through the
necessity of paying for huge stadia erect
ed for the games. Business men have
brought pressure to bear on college fac
ulties to "stage" games in large towns
to benefit business interests; manufactur
ers of athletic goods have worked be
neath the surface in behalf of commer
cialized sport to further lavish expendi
ture in equipment; and sporting editors
have supported the system for the value
to the columns of sporting news. Last
but not least, coaches and trainers in
their own interests have persistently
worked and schemed for big games and
big gate money, and through their influ
ence over the students they have been a
compelling power in intercollegiate
agreements. The effects of the com- ]
mercialization are naturally manifold: |
one of the most remarkable is the de- ;
maud that colleges shall furnish amuse- j
mcnt to the public in the shape of big!
games, regardless or without thought of j
the welfare of the students, or the pur
pose for which universities exist.
• • I
Beside the question of the develop
ment of athletics from the university
standpoint, there has arisen, as an out-1
come of the war, the consideration of >
physical training from the national point
of view. One of the most important
questions on the recruiting blanks \
seemed to have been that in regard to
leadership. The recruit was asked to j
name the rank he had held in .school'

and college sports. The import of the
question for military purposes is obvi
ous, but the development of the powers
j and qualities of leadership under the
i coach system prevailing in our colleges
i is not only not obvious but hard to find.
Again, the most important factor in
I determining the fitness of a candidate
| for the army was his physical condi-
I tion, of which an essential element was
■ physique. But to what extent have the
so-called major sports as carried on in
most American universities been opera
tive in developing men lit for military
duty? lo what extent, for example,
lias fooball assisted in the physical de
velopment of students throughout the
country? In some universities to the
extent of 1 per cent of the men, in
some 2 per cent, few beyond 3 per cent.
Kurther, it is to be noted that these mea
ger numbers are made up from men
who need least of all physical training,
exercise, and development. They arc
for the most part composed of students
who are picked athletes in the high
schools, and, further, picked by the uni
versities for intercollegiate events.
Now, whatever is to be the outcome
of the war as regards athletic training
in colleges, this committee cannot at
present determine, but signs are not
wanting that the concentrated commer
cialized system now obtaining is going
to meet with rude shocks.
The National Collegiate Athletic As
sociation has just called a meeting for
the 27th of this month (December) in
New York, and the letter of notification
does not leave much doubt as to the
purposes and intent of the meeting. It
says:
"There has been an immense amount
of talking and writing on the part of
academic authorities and others about
the educational values of physical train
ing and athletics, and at the same time
most of the institutions of the country
have calmly proceeded on their way of
promoting and encouraging the develop
ment of star athletes and representa
tive teams, without paying very much
attention to the matter of securing for
the mass of their students the educa
tional values of an experience in system
lzed physical training."
The intent of the meeting of this
highly representative body, therefore, is
-to combat the present concentrated form
of athletics prevailing in our universities,
and to further the general participation
in sports which this committee x for over
12 years has been earnestly endeavoring
to establish.
In the physical training of its students,
therefore, this committee feels with deep
conviction that the University has a two
fold duty to perform, one to the coun
try at large and one to its own educa
tional ideals—both seriously in conflict
with prevailing tendencies in intercol
legiate athletics.
To remove the evils attendant upon
intercollegiate athletics, as at present
conducted, without going to the length
of abolishing extramural competition al
together, this committee makes the fol
lowing recommendations:
1. The University through its gym-
I nasium force should provide adequate
j technical instruction in the various forms
of sport, and should maintain adequate
athletic fields.
2. The function of the gymnasium
instructors is primarily to organize
sports and instruct in games within the
university itself, which does not pre
clude their assisting in the organization
of intercollegiate teams, or in advising
I team captains in a way that the Director
. of Physical Training does not consider
j works against the development of leader
and against general participation.
But the employment of team coaches for
I the main purpose of training and drill
ing teams for intercollegiate games is
inimical to the principles. For such
games the instructor's function is advis
ing and not directing.
3. Believing that the competitive feat
ure of intercollegiate sport, rightly con
ducted, possesses genuine educational
value, we recommend that intercollegiate
contests he fostered, but that a series
of games rather than a single "big game"
be arranged with our opponents, in order
that the intense partisanship, which is
such a disturbance to academic work
and so demoralizing an inuence upon the
university community, may be avoided.
4. All sports must lie conducted in a
spirit of generous sportsmanship. If
unscrupulous partisanship leads mem
bers of teams, or the student body at
large, to indulge in or to condone un J
sportsmanlike conduct, the contest or I
the series should immediately be called
off. lo lie specific, we may refer to the
manner in which baseball has been car ;
ried on in this university of late, as an I
instance of the way in which a worthy
form of sport may be degraded by i. j
lack of good sportsmanship on the part |
of players and spectators,—especially the
latter.

5. The commercialization of college
sport has become so common and wide
spread that its deadening effect on sports
manship and the enjoyment of the game is
hardly noticed. In many intercollegiate
arrangements for matches the question
of gate receipts bulks larger than the
games themselves, and this condition re
acting on the play makes it a matter of
serious business and work rather than
of recreation and enjoyment. The pleas
ure of the players is a factor that is
rarely considered in the councils of team
managers and coaches.
I o meet this situation the Committee
would urge two measures which may
come under the head of general poljcy:
<1 ) I hat all games, large or small,
played on the Stanford campus hi- free
to all students; (2) that in games played
on outside grounds the charges levied
be limited to an amount sufficient to
fairly cover the expenses of the events.
Is is, of course, not for us to say
what should be the prices of admission
to games played elsewhere, but we de
sire to record our conviction that, once
the principle of arranging intercollegiate
events witli a view to making money is
admitted, there is no limit to the abuses
that may, and almost certainly will, creep
handling of athletic funds has by no
means prevented a thorough commer
cialization of athletics in many colleges
in this country.
6. If these suggestions meet with the
approval of the President of the Uni
versity. we further recommend that they
be given the widest publicity, together
with the reasons for adopting them.
The general public knows little of the
comparative merits of rival games or
the inner workings of big games, but it
would be quick to realize the moral
value in decommercializing sport and
making it democratic. Further, such
possibility would be helpful to the high
schools throughout the state who for
years have been striving to withstand
the tendencies generated by the athletic
regime in the universities.
