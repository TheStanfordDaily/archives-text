# AMERICAN FOOTBALL POLICY IS DECIDED BY THE ATHLETIC BOARD
## Stanford to Enter Pacific Coast Conference for Next Schedule HIGH PAID COACHING SYSTEMS WILL NOT BE USED IN NEWEST SPORT 
### 
American football, played along the same lines as other sports at
Stanford, will be a part of athletics here in the future as result of a
policy adopted by the Hoard of Control of Athletics last nigh, and ap
proved by the president today. No dual arrangements with California
will be made, but Stanford will apply to the Pacific Coast Conference
of which the I niversity is already a member, for a schedule in the
newest sport at Stanford.
Stanford's peculiar system of non-professional coaching which has
been used so successfully in track, Rugby, and other sports will be in
troduced into the American game. Rugby will not be discontinued, but
the Hoard of Control will endeavor to foster this game among the other
universities, because it has demonstrated its value as a form of exercise
for universities.
Following is the official statement given out through the president's
office regarding American football:

For many years Stanford University, under the guidance of
Dr. Angell and his fellow members of the Faculty Athletic Com
mittee. has been developing a schedule of athletics with the fol
lowing primary objects in view:
1. General physical development of the students.
2. Participation by all students in some form of athletic
exercises.
3. The development of a plan of healthy contests, both
intra- and extra-mural, that would harmonize with academic life
and ideals.
The Hoard of Athletic Control, representing equally the stu
dents, alumni and faculty, has been organized and it has now
completed plans for the control of the finances of the gymnasium
and of the various contests, and has put into effect a system of
instruction in sports that obviates most of the objections to the
intensive coaching system. All coaches appointed have the ap
proval of the president of the University, are on annual appoint
ment. and are not men confining themselves exclusively to one
game or one particular type of sport.
Stanford's ideals in athletics are now so well founded and
understood that it is the feeling of the Hoard of Athletic Control
that any form of legitimate sport can be conducted under them
without serious difficulty. Without in any way relaxing interest
in and enthusiasm for Rugby as a tyi>e of football particularly
well adapted to the colleges, they feel that they can now add
American football to the list of sports. In pursuance of this
plan, application will be made to the Pacific Coast Conference
Schedule Committee for games with various western institutions.
It is also probable that some of them can be interested in taking
up Rugby, since it has proven itself such a great flatural game.
There has recently been an exchange of letters between the
presidents of the two universities in regard to a common stand
ard for athletic arrangements at Stanford and the University of
California, but at present the local conditions are so different on
the two campuses that no uniform plan acceptable to both institu
tions could l»e decided upon. Hy mutual agreement there will be
in the future no dual arrangements with the University of Cali
fornia, but it is not improbable that the University of California
will apply through the conference for games with Stanford.

Dr. Wilbur lias also made public the
report of the faculty Committee 011 Ath
letics. upon which the Board of Control
has largely made its decision as to a
policy in athletics. Following is the text
of this report:
Stanford University, Cal..
December 19, 1918.
President R. L. Wilhur, Stanford Uni
versity.
Dear Dr. Wilbur: Experience has
shown that the following beneficial ef
fects may, and should, result to stu
dents in schools and colleges from ath
letic sports, rightly conducted:
1. Physical benefits —quarter of a
century ago regarded by academic au

thorities as the tnaiti or only benefit.
2. Recreation and enjoyment of sport
for sport's sake—which include a gener
ous satisfaction in winning from a wor
thy foe or of doing one's hest in a los
ing game
3. Knowledge of men and develop
ment of tact and consideration in deal
ing with one's fellows—regarded as the
chief benefit in English public schools.
4. As an outgrowth of the preceding,
the development of a sense of "fair
play"—the fundamental trait for citizens
of a democracy.
5. Development of powers of leader
ship.
