# PACIFIC FALLS BEFORE CARDINALS BY 37-11
## TEAM WARMS UP SLOWLY San Jose Five Puts Scare Into Varsity During the First Half 
### 
Stanford and California varsity and
freshman teams will test their
strength for the first time Saturday
night, when the '22 fives meet at En
cina gym, and the varsities play at
California. Both contests are sched
uled to start at 8 o'clock. Arrange
ments have been made to phone the
results of the piay at California to
Stanford so they can be announced
between halves of the freshman game.
Thiswill insure a large turnout to
see the first-year men play.
Both games Saturdiay should be
hair-raisers. The victories of the Car
dinal and Dlue and Gold teams in the
California-Nevada League so far have
made it plain that the championship ot
the league will be decided in the se
ries. At present Stanford leads with
a margin of two games, having de
feated Davis Farm, Santa Clara. St.
Mary's, and College of Pacific by a
large score. California, on the other
hand, has beaten Davis and College of
Pacific by large counts.
The freshmen are always an un
known quantity until they meet, but
Coach Evans has put a goodly a lount
of team-work into a rather weal; com
bination, and the Cardinal first-year
men will put up a hard fight against
anything California ran turn out.
Whether the babes are victorious or
not depends largely on the turnout for
Saturday's game.
Stanford played and won from Col
lege of Pacific at San Jose last night,
:'.7 to 11. Coach Evans used all his
men in the game, and this may have
slowed up the five, but from their
showing last night California will not
have such a hard time defeating Stan
ford as was supposed at the first, cf
the year. The forwards were not
working well together, mid the rest
of the team seemed to go at the game
half-heartedly .
The score at the end of the first
was nine all. During the second pe
riod the varsity tightened up, and ran
up a larger count on the Pacific five.
In the afternoon at San Jose the
freshmen lost to the San Jose High
School, 36 13. Coach Kvans ran his
squad through one after another, but
the high school men were too fast.
