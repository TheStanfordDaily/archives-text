Casals was horn in Vendrell, Spain, in
1876. He reached the age of twelve
before he decided to devote his career to
the 'cello, and even then his actual tui
tion consisted of hut few years under
Jose Garcia. Previously he had studied
the flute, violin and piano, and even
today he is a fine performer on each
of those instruments. As a boy he sang
in the choir of the church of which
his father was organist and choirmaster,
and occasionally he took his father's
place at the organ.
All this formed a ground-work for
developing the artistic sense so pre
dominant in him. Within three years
of his choice of the 'cello as his medium
of expression, he had carried off the
first prizes at the Conservatoire of Barce
lona for 'cello, counterpoint and com
position.
Since that time he has plrr
