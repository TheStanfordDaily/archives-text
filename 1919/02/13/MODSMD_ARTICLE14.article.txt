# PRO-STANFORD
## 
### 
WITH yesterday's issue of the Daily Palo Alto, Volume 54 officially termi
nated its journalistic career. The birth of a new in the middle of a
college quarter volume does not call for radical change in the policy of the
paper. The Daily is primarily a news organ, with a fixed and determined
policy to present the news of the campus to the people of the campus in a
representative fashion. This is the one unchanging policy of the Daily; the
actual results, sometimes more successful than at other times, are merely
expression of this purpose.
Editorially, the policy of a newspaper changes to a greater or less extent
according to the views behind the editorials. Differences in the editorial
policy of the Daily Palo Alto are merely difference between the views of suc
cessive editors. The purpose of the publication as a news organ is unchang
ing. The purpose of the paper as an expression of public opinion in the edi
torials is likewise fundamentally unaltered. Method of procedure only changes
from one year to the other.
The Daily Palo Alto stands for all things that are distinctly pro-Stanford.
It is anti-nothing except what is not pro-Stanford. It officially recognizes no
factions and no groups, no divisions and no splits, except upon the basis of
what is pro-Stanford and what is not pro-Stanford. Volume 55, born with this
issue, asserts the right of self-expression in all matters pertaining to the
University, providing the basis of such expression is an ultimate benefit to
Stanford. It recognizes no check or no rein except where it oversteps the
fixed boundaries of right and reason.
Volume 55 is particularly fortunate to exist in a year of college reorgan
ization or readjustment, at a time when everything is returning to the basis
of the "good old days." It welcomes back those days and is thankful for ex
istence at a time when they are rapidly returning, when athletic affairs are
once again on a rock foundation, when teams are promising victory, when the
students are promising support and the University authorities' co-operation.
There has never been a more opportune time to be pro-Stanford.
