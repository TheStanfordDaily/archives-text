Board of Safety
To Investigate Police
The resignation of Chief of Police
Chester C. Noble and his assistant, Wal
ter .Camp, has been recommended by
the committee appointed to investigate
police conditions in Palo Alto. The
Board of Public Safety, of which Pro
fessor J. C. L. Fish of the engineering
department is chairman, intends to go
into the evidence itself, because of the
committee's refusal to detail the reasons
for its recommendation. The same wit
nesses examined by the investigating
committee are to be called.
The charges against Noble, which

recommend his dismissal and that of his
assistant, arc signed by four of the five
investigators in a special committee
named by Mayor Cooley some time ago
as a result of rumors which had come
to him from time to time for four
months in regard to lax conditions in
the police department.
The city council decided that the char
ter gives the Board of Public Safety the

I power to dismiss the chief of police, but
if the council was not satisfied with the
verdict of the Board of Public Safety,
it could dismiss the board. The Board
of Public Safety is composed of Pro
| fessor J. C. L. Fish, J. E. Sloan, a garage
i man of Palo Alto, and J. W. Roller, a
! retired undertaker.
