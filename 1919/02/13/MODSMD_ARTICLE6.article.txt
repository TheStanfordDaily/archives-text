## Captain Devlin Prophesies An All-Star Lineup For Season 
### 
A continuation of the inter fraternity
tennis tournament took place this after
noon on the Encina courts, when the
Alpha Delts met the El Camino Club
racket wielders, and the Faculty Club
men played the Phi Kappa Sigs in dual
combats of considerable interest. The
faculty men, much to the surprise of
tennis fans and enthusiasts, have come
to the front in marked style and have
splendid chances for scoring in the final
meets.
The winners of the Alpha Delts vs.
the EI Camino Club will play the Delta
Upsilon's tennis champs in the upper
half of the semi-finals, while the Zeta
Psi will contest the winning team of the
Phi Kappa Sigmas vs. the Faculty Club
tournament. The final contests will un
doubteiMWje ones of considerable inter
est, due iF> the well-matched ability of
all the teams engaged.
The interfraternity tennis tourna
ments have brought out a number of
the old racket men to the ring once
again, and due to their all-star ability
as well as that of several new"lights of
prep school fame, prospects are loom
ing big for a winning aggregation in
the farm's '10 meets. Allyn liarber is
again on the court with his usual form
and pep. Paul Kinney, a '22 man of
ability, and Phil Neer of Portland, who
has made a name for himself in the
light of his stellar playing, have come
forth from their winter hibernation to
once more take up the racket for the
Cardinal. Such men as Da vies, P>ent
and Crosby will no doubt uphold the
upperclassmen's reputation.
The match with Lowell high of the
city will be called within the next two
weeks. A snappy meet will be evi
denced at that time, is the view of this
year's tennis pilot, Devlin.
All men who are interested in the
court game and who have any ability in
tennis are requested to meet at' the En
cina gym on Mondays, Wednesdays and
