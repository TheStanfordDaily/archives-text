# FIELD GIVES IDEAS FOR PAGEANT
## 
### 
Service as it has found expression on
what is now Stanford soil has been sug
gested by Charlie K. Field as a motive
for the History Pageant which is being
planned as a part of the reunion cele
brations to be featured during com
mencement weak. In a letter to the Eng
lish Club Mr. Field gives out this idea
to "the dramatic geinuses who throng
the campus":
"The first land expedition from Monte
rey to San Francisco paused by the
brink of the San Francisquito. The
stream was flowing sweetly—camou
flaged by winter rains—and the great
tree stood beside it, wits its roots in ap
parently living water. So they planted
a cross and marked it for the site of a
mission. When another expedition came
to the cross-marked site, the stream's
gravelly bed was shining sweetly in the

summer sun. and the project was aban
doned. It was left for a day when an
other stream should he found; when an
unfailing spring of golden wealth poured
out from the dark recesses of a jjreat
sorrow to build the mission dreamed of
by those early visitors.
"The first cross was planted with the
idea of service; the development of the
farm contained this idea in the crude
sense of improving a breed; and then
came 'The Mission,' consecrated to serv
ice culminating in the manifold service
of the war period and the vision of the
peace service to come."
The pageant committees are now at
work learning as much as possible of
the Stanford legendry. The English
J Club is anxious to receive any ideas as
;to plan or themes. Suggestions should
I be sent to Miss Margery Baily.
