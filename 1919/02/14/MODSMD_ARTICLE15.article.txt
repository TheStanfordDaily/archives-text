# GOOD LUCK!!
## 
### 
WHEN the reftree's whistle blows tomorrow evening on the University of
California basket court and simultaneously in Encina gymnasium, Cardinal
rooters and Bruin sympathizers will have their first opportunity for mutual and
expressed rivalry since the S. A. T. C. football disaster of the fall quarter.
The basketball teams of the two institutions have been trained to a point that,
for Stanford at least, has hitherto been unknown in the bay and peninsular re
gions. Stanford's five is a systematized, fighting quintet; Coach Evans has seen
to that. Chances of victory are promising. Here's to good luck!
But the best means of wishing a team success is to promise it support. When
the Cardinal team takes the floor, the Cardinal rooters become essential parts of
its chances. Their encouragement is a material help in the work on hand and an
aid to the prospects of victory.
One thing is urged of the rooters, other than the actual support of the team.
Fair play and good sportsmanship are equal attributes of both players and spec
tators. Less hooting and more cheering should be a fixed idea of the Stanford
spectators, even should the men from across the bay be less inclined (and we hope
not) to favor this view of sportsmanship.
