# Ram's Head Show Gets Final Touches
## Biff! Bang!! Bullsheveek!!! Is Polishing Up for the Big Night 
### 
"Biff Bang!! Bullsheveek!!!" is in
the final stages of preparation and is
being polished up for the big day 011
Friday, February 21, just one week
from today. All members of the cast
are working hard and putting in many
good hours of practice in order that
this Ram's Head production may be
a great suceess.
"Biff! Bang!! Bullsheveek!!!" is
something entirely revolutionary in
character, according to L. L. Picker
ing. '20, who is coaching the extrav
aganza, and puts the present state of
Russia in an extremely ludicrous as
pect. The scene is laid in Russia, and
the central action takes place around
the famous "Rush-in-Inn"; the spo
where the conspirators, as played by
Robert McConaughy, '21, Jack Shnier,
'20. Robert Armstrong, '21, hatched
their fiendish plans. The humorous
situations in this type of a production
are very extreme, and it will be the
purpose of the cast to keep the entire
audience in a constant state of lauj- 'i
ter.
"Biff! Bang!! Bullsheveek!!!" is a
musical extravaganza, and something
new in campus dramatics. It has bee.i
a number of years since a play featur
ing men in women's parts has been at
tempted; "Rambling Ramesis" aiiil
"Routing Razmattaz" were two simi)
types of play produced by Rani s
Head in previous years, and publh
opinion is that they were sensation
in Stanford dramatics. Next Fridaj
"Biff! Bang!! Bullsheveek!!!" prom
ises to eclipse the record of these tw<
successes.
Tickets have been put on sale at th
Stanford Bookstore and at Robiuso
and Crandall in Palo Alto, and all pre;
ent indications point to a full house o*
that night.
