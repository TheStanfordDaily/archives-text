# RIVAL QUINTETS WILL CLASH TOMORROW NIGHT
## Cardinal Varsity to Meet U.C. Team Harmon Gym to Be Scene of Fast Basketball Game Tomorrow Night 
### H.G. SWENDSEN, '20 
COACH EVANS and the Stanford
varsity basketball team will have
their first real test of strength tomor
row night when the California Bears try
their hand with the Cardinals in Har
mon gym at Berkeley. Both the series
between the two universities and the
championship of the California-Nevada
League will be at stake when the fives
clash. The results of the game will be
phoned to Encina gym and will be an
nounced at the freshman contest.
On paper at present, Stanford should
win. California is very confident she
has an unbeatable combination, but that
belief is largely based on performances
of past years, when the Blue and Gold
has won consistently. The Cardinal
five is the fastest and cleverest ever
turned out here. The team work is ex
cellent, and Coach Evans has used the
weight of his guards and center to great
advantage in developing the team.
Stanford May Win Game
Stanford may win tomorrow night's
battle. But whether she does or does
not, the final result of the series will not
be greatly settled by this one game. Tn
any case if the Cardinal beats the Blue
and Gold in this first test of strength,
there is very little doubt that one of the
other two contests will come to the
Stanford camp.
The Cardinal team is unlike anything
that has been seen on courts around
here, and this fact is going to have a
great affect in deciding the result of the
series.
Comparative Scores Unimportant
Comparative scores have little to do
with the comparison of the two fives,
though they throw some light on the
odds at least. Stanford beat Davis
Farm School on the local court. 55 to 7.
California beat the same team at Berke
ley, 51 to 6. The Cardinal men on the
floor at College of Pacific beat the .San
Jose team 37 to 11. California won over
Pacific at Harmon gym 46 to 23. These
are the only combinations which have
played both Stanford and California.
Stanford will line up tomorrow night
with Esgen and Hood at forwards,

Righter at center, and Lilly and Wil
liamson at guards. California's at pres
ent will start Symcs and either Goodrich,
Horstman or Jap Symes at forward,
Anderson at center, and Captain Green
and Majors at guards. Both teams av
erage about the same in weight. Green
and Majors about equal Lilly and Wil
liamson in power, Righter is probably
fifty per cent better than Anderson, and
the forwards are about equal. This is
man for man. but there is serious doubt
if California can develop the power in
team-work Stanford has.
At any rate, the game tomorrow will
be extra fast, and extra good to watch.
The festivities are scheduled to start at
8 o'clock. Referee Harris of Oakland
will handle the whistle.

Comparative Scores Unimportant
Comparative scores have little to do
with the comparison of the two fives,
though they throw some light on the
odds at least. Stanford beat Davis
Farm School on the local court. 55 to 7.
California beat the same team at Berke
ley, 51 to 6. The Cardinal men on the
floor at College of Pacific beat the .San
Jose team 37 to 11. California won over
Pacific at Harmon gym 46 to 23. These
are the only combinations which have
played both Stanford and California.
Stanford will line up tomorrow night
with Esgen and Hood at forwards,

Righter at center, and Lilly and Wil
liamson at guards. California's at pres
ent will start Symcs and either Goodrich,
Horstman or Jap Symes at forward,
Anderson at center, and Captain Green
and Majors at guards. Both teams av
erage about the same in weight. Green
and Majors about equal Lilly and Wil
liamson in power, Righter is probably
fifty per cent better than Anderson, and
the forwards are about equal. This is
man for man. but there is serious doubt
if California can develop the power in
team-work Stanford has.
At any rate, the game tomorrow will
be extra fast, and extra good to watch.
The festivities are scheduled to start at
8 o'clock. Referee Harris of Oakland
will handle the whistle.
COACH EVANS and the Stanford
varsity basketball team will have
their first real test of strength tomor
row night when the California Bears try
their hand with the Cardinals in Har
mon gym at Berkeley. Both the series
between the two universities and the
championship of the California-Nevada
League will be at stake when the fives
clash. The results of the game will be
phoned to Encina gym and will be an
nounced at the freshman contest.
On paper at present, Stanford should
win. California is very confident she
has an unbeatable combination, but that
belief is largely based on performances
of past years, when the Blue and Gold
has won consistently. The Cardinal
five is the fastest and cleverest ever
turned out here. The team work is ex
cellent, and Coach Evans has used the
weight of his guards and center to great
advantage in developing the team.
Stanford May Win Game
Stanford may win tomorrow night's
battle. But whether she does or does
not, the final result of the series will not
be greatly settled by this one game. Tn
any case if the Cardinal beats the Blue
and Gold in this first test of strength,
there is very little doubt that one of the
other two contests will come to the
Stanford camp.
The Cardinal team is unlike anything
that has been seen on courts around
here, and this fact is going to have a
great affect in deciding the result of the
series.
