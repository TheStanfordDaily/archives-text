# FRESHMAN QUINTET TO MIX WITH BRUIN BABES AT ENCINA
## 
### JESSEE E. THRASH, '21 
STANFORD freshmen will meet the
California first-year five in their
first battle of the season tomorrow
night on the Encina court at the same
time as the varsity teams play at
Berkeley. The game will be called at
8 o'clock.
In the enthusiasm over the varsity
little attention has been given this
year to the 1922 quintet, yet they have
developed what looks to be one of the
strongest first-year teams that has
represented the Cardinal for several
years.
Team Light but Fast
This year's team is not as heavy as
the average freshman five, but are
noticeably above the average in speed
and teamwork. The article of team
work is usually conspicuously absent
among freshmen quintets, but this
year's team, under the tutelage of
Coach Evans seems to have corrected
that, fault.
In bucking the Blue and Gold five,
the freshmen are going against a much
heavier team, but expect to make up
the difference in accurate shooting
and teamwork.
California Confident
Californians are confident, as usual,
and have 110 doubts about the out
come of the 1922 series, but those who
have seen the Stanford five working
the last week believe that the "babes"
will give Bruin a hard fight for his
life.
As the two teams have played hut
very few preliminary games it is im
possible t6 dope the outcome on com
parative scores, so that there will be
few odds either way when the two
teams take the floor tonight. Much of
the responsibility of the game will
fall on Captain Austin, of the first
year five, as he will have to take en
tire charge of the team in the ab
sence of Coach lOvans, who will be at
Berkeley. Austin plays at guard and
is one of the strongholds of the 1!>22
quintet.
Oavies and Mangin will play at for
ward in this game and should spring
some surprises for the visitors. Both
111011 are excellent shots and are like
wise good on the defensive. Larson
will work with Austin in the defensive
end of the court and either Boeder or
Gerason will take center.
Mangin is perhaps the best goal
shot 011 the team and can be counted
on to drop several shots through the
ring. If substitutes are needed Neer
will probably be used at forward. Al
though fast, lie is a little too light to
he a sure bet.
