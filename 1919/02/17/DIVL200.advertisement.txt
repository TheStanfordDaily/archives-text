"The Style Shop of_ the_ Peninsula"
ONE TIME THE REGENT WAS BORN
Croakers Said it Would Not Last, But They
Have Since Passed Quietly Away
Circumspect Stanford gents ratified the birth of the clothes
nation and team vork made a healthy child of the infant
Bill Pemberton was photographed in the first juvenile automobile that the child gave away when it was
a yearling, and Louie McDermo! initiated its growth from swaddling clothes in a motorcycle that made
the old-timers jump sideways all the way out to Manzanita!
Tough Arrell, Buck Sundll, Harry Horton, Cub Minturn, Babe' Crawford, Here" Cheda,
John Fitting and other pow< rs called daily and moved the show cases out on the sidewalk to convince
Ihe public that a REAL STOI .h, was in this neck of the woods —and then they moved them back in again
and swore that the old shop was here to stay!
Happy days when the writer's head polished the floor, with his two legs up where his head ought to be,
held thus by husky football giants!
And every year since then 112 le roil of real gents who have been proud to wear Regent duds has in
creased and they have been worn in every corner of the earth and by the bravest of the brave!
The Regent has been and always will be the most consistent advertiser of Stanford periodicals and of
Stanford events; always to be relied on and a fertile spot where the timid advertising solicitor always
gets a smile and an ad.
Men and women of Stanforc, there is no more complete or better equipped shop anywhere on earth to
serve you than the grown-ujj Regent today.
The Regent idolizes its traditional ideals and thanks the Stanford man and woman of today who favors
us with patronage that keeps us alive and growing institution.
Some of us are getting alorg in years, but oh, boy! it's a grand feelin' to be young with the young.
