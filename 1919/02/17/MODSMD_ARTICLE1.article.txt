# PRESIDENT LOWELL OF HARVARD TO ADDRESS ASSEMBLY WEDNESDAY
## 
### 
President A. Lawrence Lowell of
Harvard University will address a
regular University assembly on Wed
nesday, February 19, at 3:30, accord
ing to word received this morning in
a telegram from Montana, where Pres
ident Lowell is giving a series of ad
dresses in company with the other
members of the League to Enforce
Peace. This comes as a result of sev
eral months' efforts on the part of the
University authorities, who have been
doing everything possible to secure
one or more speakers from the con
ference on the League of Nations
which is to be held in San Francisco
this week.
Invitations were extended to ex-
President William H. Taft, Ambassa
dor Gerard and President Lowell of
Harvard early in January. At that
time President Taft promised to ad
dress a university assembly if the time
permitted. He explained, however,
that his program was well filled, and
it seemed highly probable Stanford
would not secure any of these well
known speakers. The University au
thorities are therefore highly gratified
at the results of their efforts and the
unusual opportunity it gives Stanford
students to hear a man of national im
portance speak on a subject which is
just at this time occupying the minds

of all thinking Americans.
President Lowell comes to the Pa
cific coast under the auspices of the
League to Enforce P<tace. Meetings
of this Pacific Coast Congress for ,a
League of Nations are being held at
the Exposition Auditorium in San
Francisco on February 19 and 20.

Filene, Rabbi Martin A. Meyer, Henry
Van Dyk< former minister to the
