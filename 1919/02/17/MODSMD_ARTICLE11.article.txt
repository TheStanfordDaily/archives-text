# Stanford to Hear Famous 'Celloist
## Pablo Casals Recital to Be Given Thursdayâ€”Attracts Much Attention 
### 
Pablo Casals, who will give his re
cital 011 Thursday evening in the As
sembly ITall, has been widely ac
knowledged as one of the few great
masters of the 'cello, and has done
much todawrds showing that the
' 'cello performs more functions than
any other stringed instrument.
The reason the 'cello has not at
tracted the art of more musicians is,
no doubt, because the difficulties it
offers are too great, for its size and
the length of its strings make it un
wieldy. Toscha Seidel, the young
Russian violinist, said: "The greatest
instrument is the 'cello, and there is
only one Pablo Casals." And when
asked why he had not studied it, he
answered, "It takes too long."
Leopold Godowsky, the famous pian
ist, declared that "the 'cello more
than any other instrument demands
the infinite capacity for taking pains."
But. strangely enough, Casals, con
ceded to be the king of the 'cello,
played it in a cafe in Barcelona when
he was but fourteen years old, at
which time he had a complete mastery
of it, for playing it in cafe in Spain
is equivalent to playing in a concert
here.
