THE aftermath of a defeat is a gloom; there is nothing lo contradict this
statement in the light of recent events since the defeat of the Stanford bas
ketball team at the hands of the Bine and Gold last Saturday night. Fighting
hard to overcome the disadvantages a small court made on their style of play, the
Stanford team put up a hard, clean game from start to finish; there is little gloom
in this respect other than over the actual loss of the contest.
The California rooters likewise fought hard, but at the same time hardly
clean. It is unfortunate that in the stress of excitement over a big game, a few
rooters can cast discredit upon the athletic enthusiasm of a whole university, but
such is the unfortunate impression that one derives from the attitude of the Calil
fornia sympathizers Saturday night. That they were desirous of helping their
team win., there is no doubt; that their team did not solicit anything other than
actual encouragement from the grandstanders there is likewise no doubt, but the
rooters went so far as to hiss at the Stanford men shooting foul baskets, and
continued this to such an extent that the referee threatened to call an additional
foul if the procedure did not stop, was doubtless unsolicited by the players.
However, unfortunately it occurred and unforunately it cast reflection upon the
spirit of rivalry that exists between Stanford and California.
The columns of the Daily Palo Alto sought to impress upon the minds of
the Stanford rooters that cheering, not jeering, was wanted by the players; the
Stanford rooters gave their team what it wanted; unfortunately the California
rooters did not. This is one of the principal glooms that went with us from the
game Saturday night.
There is an additional little Stanford gloom that concerns us alone. Where
is the organized rooting once a big part of all intercollegiate events? California
had it, yell leaders and all; but, despite the large turnout for basketball games in
the past few weeks in Encina gymnasium, there has been no organized rooting,
and none was in evidence in the big game Saturday. Let's have it in the future:
With a yell leader on hand to guide a team to fight and rooters to support there
is no reason for reappearance of the Stanford glooms in future athletic contests.
