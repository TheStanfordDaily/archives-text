Instead of a rugby game with the
Palo Alto Athletic Club Saturday, Coach

against the second team. Ilolt was
shifted from full back to first five, and
Kirry played bull back. Long was
changed from first five to second five.
The game with the University of Cali
fornia will be played on the Stanford
turf Saturday. Flanigan intends to put
his men through a good deal of hard
work on Monday, Tuesday and Wednes

Friday.
