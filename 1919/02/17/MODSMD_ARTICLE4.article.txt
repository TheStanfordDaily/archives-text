# California Will Organize a Crew
## 
### 
California has decided to organize a
crew under llie auspices of a Boating
Association, according to reports from
the Berkeley Campus. As is the case at
Stanford, no money is avaiablc through
regular channels to handle the water
sport for the Blue and Gold, and the
season will he handled by the students
themselves apart from their student hody.
I nder the impression that rain was
detrimental to the crew, several candi
dates who have signed up for Varsity
and freshmen eights were not on hand
for practice Friday and Saturday. Cap
tain Rogers put the men who were on

hand throu It i hard preliminary work
out, and will start the complete squad
off tonivht i.nd tomorrow i n
Sixt w' men have si iki| up to date
for the crev , but several mm ire ex
pect' (1 io hand in their in thin the
next day or so. There ire nnugh pros
pective cox wains on t piel a crew
of 100-poundcrs. bu< then is still a
scarcity of heavier m n for the '22 and
Varsity boats.
In preparation for il rally scheduled
for Wednesday, the crew fund committee
is working hard to gather up odds and
ends of money.
