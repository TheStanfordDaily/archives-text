# WEDNESDAY SELECTED FOR RELIEF DRIVE IN CLOTHING
## MRS. L.L. BURLINGAME TO HAVE CHARGE All Durable Garments and Bedding Needed to Be Sent to Belgians 
### 
Next Wednesday has been designated
for Belgium Relief Day under the direc
tion of Mrs. Leonas Burlingame and the
Woman's War Board. Contributions in
the form of old clothes of any kind
vvlli be asked for on the campus. Any
one having old clothes to give will tele
phone Mrs Burlingame at PA 1144 to
that effect and she will call for the con
tribution
Many of the women on the campus arc
planning their spring wardrobes and will
have a number of half worn garments
left from winter which would naturally
aid in the tremendous shortage in Bel
gium. Men's shirts with worn collars
or cuffs are especially in demand, as
they are easily ct and remodeled. Shoes,
hats (except straw) and bedding will
be of great assistance and any scraps
of yarn or material can be turned into
good use.
Since the devastation of Belgium there
have been no imports other than thase
the Commission for Relief in Belgium
has been permitted to make, and these
have never been sufficient. Now the
world is short both of clothing and
of raw material. What is needed can
not be purchased, therefore it must be
and can be given.
Every household has some spare cloth
ing, worn or outgrown, of little value
there, but desperately needed by the des
titute there in Belgium . They have been
reduced to fashioning garments from
flour sacks, old blankets, sheets, and
tablecloths; all of which now have almost
disappeared, and shoes from scraps of
carpet. Today it costs $8.00 to have a
pair of shoes resoled in Belgium.
The committee in charge hopes for a
generous response. Contributions should
be ready between 10 and 12 in the
morning or 2 and 4 in the afternoon.
