## Basket Game Hard Fought—Score 29-26 
### 
By JESSEE E. THRASH, *21
THE University of California five
defeated the Stanford basketball
team Saturday night by a score of 29
to 26 in the hottest court battle that
has marked the intercollegiate series
for two years. It was a "no man's
game" until the final whistle closed
the contest with the score in favor of
the Bruins.
During the first thirty minutes of
the game not more than four points
separated the rival varsities. The ad
vantage wavered first from the side
of the Cardinal to that of California
and then back again, and was equal
during several long intervals.
First Half Ends 15-14
At the end of the first half the score
stood 15 to 14, with the advantage
claimed by the Blue and Gold war
riors. At the middle of the second
half the score-board read 20-20. Cali
fornia then spurted seven points
ahead and two changes were made in
Stanford's lineup.
Pelouze was sent in at forward in

place of Hood, and a minute later
Caughey took" Williamson's place at
guard. The Stanford play improved
from that point on, but the Cardinal
quintet was unable to overtake the
lead and the game ended with the
Bruins three points in the lead.
Symes and Majors Dangerous
Symes and Majors were the two
stellar players on the Blue and Gold
team. Their entire system of team
work was built around Majors, • Cali
fornia guard, who was the bulwark of
j the five. Symes was the most dan
■ gerous basketshooter, and dropped in
j nineteen of California's points, but
I was unable to play a clean game and
j went out during the second half on
| personal fouls.
' The attitude shown by the Califor
nia rooting section during the shoot
ing of free goals caused the referee to
stop the game on one occasion and
warn the spectators that silence must
be maintained or the visiting team
would be given another shot.
