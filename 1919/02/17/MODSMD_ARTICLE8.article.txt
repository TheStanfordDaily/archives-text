# Stanford Babes Lose to Cal. In Basketball, 27-7 Score
## 
### 
California took the first game of the
Stanford-U. C. freshman basketball
series, by winning over the Cardinal
"Frosh," 27 to 7, at the Encina gym
nasium Saturday night. A return game
will be played at Berkeley next Satur
day night at 8 p'clock, in the Harmon
gymnasium.
The Stanford team was left in con
trol of Captain Austin, Coach Evans
having gone along in charge of the
varsity team. Austin undoubtedly
played the most consistent game on
the floor last Saturday night, saving
the babes from having a much larger
score piled up against them.
A wonderful defensive game was put
up by the freshmen, who held the
Bruin babes to a score of 6 to 2, the

first half. However, their defense
broke up in the second half, the fresh
men losing hope of victory under the
strain of two main faults, which were
not remedied. Davies was hurt in th
first of the game, which left the team
in the offensive end of the court with
out a man who could hit the basket.
Then, again, the offensive work of the
freshmen was at a standstill, because
they were not able to handle the ball
when they had it. The whole of the
offensive playing was left to Mangin
and Davies. Mangin made the only
Stanford field goal, the rest of the
points being free shots.
Those playing for Stanford were:
Davies, Mangin and Neer, forwards;
Gerson, center; Austin and Larsen,
guards.
