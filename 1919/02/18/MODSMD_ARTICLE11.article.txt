rence Lowell of Harvard will speak on
"The Responsibility of the American
Democracy for Establishing a League
of Nations." In addition to the lec
ture, President Lowell will give sev
eral addresses before members of the
League to Enforce Peace, which is
meeting tomorrow and Thursday in
the Exposition Auditorium in San
Francisco.
The party of prominent men with
whom President Lowell came from
the East will leave soon on its tour
of the United States, going from San
Francisco south and returning by way
of the southern states. In all, nine
different congresses will have been
addressed by the party when the trip
is ended. The attendance at the meet
ings already held has been unusually
large, and San Francisco has made
plans to accommodate large crowds at
the coming meetings.
President Lowell to Speak '
Early in January, when it was first
learned that there was a possibility
of President Lowell and ex-Presid ?nt
Taft coming to San Franciscc ele
grams and letters were sent asking
the mto address a university assem
bly. Ex-President Taft wrote in reply
that at that time it seemed almost im
possible for any of them to make the
trip down to Palo Alto, as they were
to be in the city only two days, dur
ing which time they had a full sched
ule.
The telegram stating that President
Lowell would be able to make an ad
dress before the student body, there
fore, came as a distinct surprise, as
, the university authorities had given
! up hope of securing any of the speak
ers. It was for a time hoped that ex-
President Taft would also be able to
come, but later word from him says
that he will be unable to make a visit
to the university.
Address Much Praised
The address that President Lowell
will make has been given in many
places throughout the East, where it
has been judged good enough to be
printed entire in many of the Eastern
papers. It is said to be an unusual
opportunity for Stanford students, and
It is hoped that the entire student

body will avail themselves of the op
portunity to hear the lecture. As it
is to be classed as a regular assem
bly, all classes will be dismissed.
After his speech here, President
Lowell will return to San Francisco,
where he speaks again before the con
ference on Thursday morning, leaving
for the south either Thursday night
!or Friday morning.
