### 
Pablo Casals, the 'cellist whose con
cert on next Thursday evening will
form the second of the Peninsula
Musical Association's series for the
present season, is regarded as a very
human person, despite the fact that
he is one of the greatest living virtu
osi. He is especially noticeable for
an excellent sense of humor which en
dears him to all his associates.
As a boy he played the 'cello in an
orchestra in Barcelona. The con
ductor was a fussy old person who
was exceedingly difficult to satisfy. It
happened that the cadenza, an impro
visation for the 'cello, was given to
Casals for a certain performance. The
first time that Casals played it in a
rehearsal, the conductor snapped,
"Too long!" Patiently the youth tried
it again, whereupon he was rewarded
with "Too short!" Casals looked up
and inquired innocently, "What about
the width?"
Casals has studied the 'cello since
he was twelve years of ago, and Is
especially noted for his rapid progress
| in developing the ground work for the
artistic sence so predominant in him.
