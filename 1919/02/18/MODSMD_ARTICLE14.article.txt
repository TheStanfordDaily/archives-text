# OUT OF BED, SLEEPERS!
## 
### 
WHEN the average Stanford alarm-clock rings each morning, the average
Stanford student wakes up and promptly falls to sleep again. This is but
figuratively speaking and refers only to the intense amount of lack of interest
taken by the average being on the campus in affairs of the campus.
Periodically some fearless person comes out editorially or verbally and en
lightens his more dead brethren that such and such a group is running the campus.
Immediately a flare of interest is created and a few men and women actually cast
"their ballot on one side or other. It is strange that this cry of control by an
individual group is practically the only thing that ever seems to create interest
ill elections and events of that sort. The politicians, if they really exist here,
otherwise than in their own imagination, are cognizant of the fact that control
by a group is only possible where the student body as a whole takes no active
interest in affairs. When universal interest is created there can be no such bug
bear as group control. There is now no cry of a political ring to be-downed,
but there is an urgent call for the sleepers of the campus to wake up.
And by sleepers, one does not refer alone to the 2 o'clock grind, or the milk
train sport, asleep as both these probably are in their individual way; by sleepers,
we mean the average men and women of the campus. There is here no minced
words, no censored eulogy of the college student's worth. There is merely a
trying plea to get out of bed, sleepers!

- -lection on the Quad tomorrow; this is the first opportun
:ect of a worth-while alarm clock. For one of the tirst
nford history the entire student body is eligible to vote
; candidates. Will the student body vote? Or will such
p or organization be the only ones to send its members
to the pons r Ine candidates are up on their merit. Let's wake up nad choose
them.
Not alone are student officers to be selected on the morrow, but the tirst
blow for student control may then be struck. The University administration
wishes to see student control in a good and virile form once again at Stanford:
the only argument against it is lack of interest and consequent failure in admin
istrating the system.
By voting tomorrow in large numbers; by showing a reawakened interest in
the government of the Stanford community, an unassailable argument for student
control can be set up. It is not on the ballots, but it is there in invisible form, for
student interest means student control.
