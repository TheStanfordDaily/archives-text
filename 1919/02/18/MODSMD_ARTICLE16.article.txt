# MAX ROSEN TO APPEAR HERE ON FEBRUARY 27
## Pupil of Leopold Auer Has Won Much Praise Since Debut Last Year 
### 
Max Rosen, the great violinist, will
appear at Stanford on Thursday even
ing, February 27, as the first player in
the new series of concerts which
Frank W. Healy of San Francisco is
offering.
Rosen made his debut in New York
on January 12, 1918, with the Philhar
monic Orchestra, and since that time
has been highly praised by musical
critics. In speaking of his first ap
pearance, the Boston Christian Science
Monitor has said:
"Much as one has been led to look
for from pupils of Leopold Auer, (he
first tone uttered from Max Rosen's
violin at his debut on Saturday was a
surprise. The young artist disclosed a
degree of the brilliancy of his school
and at the same time a wholesome,
honest approach to his work. lie does
not chisel out his rapid passages as
does Heifetz; he has not that player's
forbidding perfection or his deceptive
ease. He does not seem so self-confi
dent as Heifetz, nor so self-sufficient
as Elman; it is likely that he will find
a large public, for he touches the
hearer with something besides amaze
ment and invokes an immediate legiti
mate response. This quality makes
defects hardly worth mentioning, and
Mr. Rosen has few defects, appar
ently."
