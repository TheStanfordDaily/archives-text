# BELGIAN RELIEF HAS SENT NOTE OF THANKS
## 
### 
Following the announcements re
cently made in San Francisco papers
that Belgian relief work, except for
the collection of clothing, is to cease
in the near future, the local Belgian
Relief Committee wishes to explain
the situation. The general Commis
sion for Relief in Belgium has sent
word that Belgium will not need help
after April 1.
In April, therefore, the
Palo Alto Belgian Relief Committee
will no longer collect funds for the
several charities having to do with
the needs of the Belgians. Some re
adjustment will be necessary on ac
count of this change, the committee
announces. Much of the money and
interest have gone heretofore to
northern France, where the devastat
ed Peronne district has been Califor
nia's special responsibility. This re
gion still needs help in reconstruction
work and will need it for many
months to come, according to recent
reports. But now, both new and sec
ond-hand clothing is greatly desired
in Belgium. The factories of Belgium
lie in ruins, and it will be some time
before the Belgians can clothe them
selves. This task will be the chief
aim of the committee during the next
month or two.
The local committee asks its
pledged contributors to send in their
monthly sums exactly as usual during
February and March. If the rapidly
changing conditions in Europe make
some radical change advisable in fur
ther plans, the committee will an
nounce it at that time.
The committee is deeply apprecia
tive of the confidence given it by the
community, and has wished the fol
lowing to be published:
"We have taken our work seriously,
feeling that through our reasonably
! convenient organization the Palo Alto
and university people have expressed
their good-will and helpfulnessâ€”their
longing to relieve suffering. We hope
i to continue this service of go-between
as long as there remains on the one
J side the desire to aid and 011 the other
side serious distress."
ELLEN COIT ELLIOT,
General Chairman.
MRS. E. B. TOWNE,
Chairman for Palo Alto.
