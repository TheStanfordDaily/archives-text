# STANFORD BACKFIELD IS WEAKENED BY INJURIES
## Long, Sheldon, and Nagel Will Probably Be Out of Big Contest 
### 
Owing to injuries to Sheldon, Nagel
and Long, Stanford's backfield will
probably be weakened for the rugby
game with the California pack on the
Stanford field Saturday. Long is the
latest man to go out with an injury,
but to offset these losses, the Cardinal
forwards are playing top-notch foot
ball.
VVrenn, Henry, Watts, Adams, Flood,
Clark, Van Cliffe and Patrick are
showing excellent form in their posi
tions in the scrum. If the injured
backfield men are unable to get back
in the game by Saturday, it will be up
to the forwards to do the brunt of the
work against the Blue and Gold com
bination.
Despite the probable loss of the
three backs, Coach "Pete" Flanigan
has the edge on the Californians in
the matter of experience. The major
ity of the Cardinal players are veter
ans in the English game, while the
California ruggers as a whole are in
experienced.
Captain Doe will hold down the po
sition of halfback, and Holt, a mem
ber of the S. A. T. C. American foot
ball team, will probably play first five.
Kinney is playing fullback at present
and Falk and Repath are stars in the
wing positions.
Walter von Monderscheid of the
Olympic Club and former Santa Clam
rugby coach, will probably referee thr
game.
