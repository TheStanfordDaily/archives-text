Company G, 62d Infantry,
Camp Lee, Virginia,
February 9, 1919.
Editor of the 1). P. A.
Dear Sir: In reading the I). P. A. of
January 24, I was very much surprised
to see that the Stanford R. C). T. C. was
about to die from lack of support by the
students. This came as a shock to one
who was a member of the R. O. T. C.
when it was a vital part of Stanford life.
The training gained while at school has
been of inexpressible value to the mam
Stnaford men now in the service.
Many will claim that as the war is
over the need for military training is
over. That premise should not be too
eagerly expected. The course of time
only can prove whether all need for
armies is past. There is another side
of military training, however, that should
pr< sent itself for the consideration of
the Stanford Studenty Body. Military
training possesses an educational value
that cannot be ignored. In the develop
ment of the mind, it deserves a place
among the other sciences. It supplies
a self-reliance and an alertness that
cannot be gained from any other aca
demic subject. On the other hand, mili
tary training furnishes a type of physical
exercise that is hard to beat.
When we come right down to the
question of whether the R. O. T. C.
is to be a permanent factor of life at
Stanford or not, some consideration
should be given to the men tha tdevci
oped the "Stanford Army." Most of
these men are still in the army and
will not be able to speak for themselves
until next fall. Can't the present Stu
dent Body stand behind the R. O. T. C.
until these men can speak for them
selves? It is my opinion that they will
want to keep up the tine organization
that Major Bugge started and Captain
Parker has so ably developed.
Sincerely.
S. E. Hays. *20.
