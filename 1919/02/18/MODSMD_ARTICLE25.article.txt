# SENIOR RECORDS FOR THE QUAD MUST BE COMPLETED NOW
## 
### 
The task of collecting senior records
is now the main problem confronting
editorial tryoutees now working under
Co-editor L. W. Dinkelspiel, '20, of the
1920 Quad. Blanks for the senior rec
ords have been issued to the proper
men of Encina Hall, and they are re
quested to fill these out as fully as
possible and to turn them in now at
the custodian's office. Seniors in the
hall are asked to attend to this at once,
as tryoutees will not be sent to gather
these records at Encina.
Seniors on the Row who have been
issued blanks are asked to fill them
out, and to hold them till approached
by the collectors. Those who have not
obtained blanks will receive them in
the near future, and any who should
have them and do not get the blanks
soon should request the same from
some staff member or tryoutee.
Organizations which have taken pic
tures for the Quad at "Pop" Franklin's
should send a representative to the
studio at once to select the finished
picture to appear in the year-book, and
to see that this picture gets into the
hands of one of the staff tryoutees.
