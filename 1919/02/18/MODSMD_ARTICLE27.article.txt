# HOSTESS HOUSE IS TO BE COMMUNITY CENTER
## 
### 
The Hostess House will become a
community center in Palo Alto, ac
cording to word received from Mayor
Cooley yesterday. The assignment of
$4,375, a part of the proceeds realized
from the song festival, has been made
to the Palo Alto Community Center.
A mass meeting will probably be
called to take over the responsibility
as a community centor. The Y. W. C.
A. has donated the Hostess House
buildings at Camp Fremont, and the
cost of removal has been estimated at
varying between $2,000 and $3,000.
The wings of the building will be de
tached, and the main structure cut
into small sections, making nine sec
tions in all to be removed to the city
land near the Southern Pacific station.
Palo Alto will be the first city in the
United States to establish a commun
ity center, and the securing of the
fund for Palo Alto is largely due to
the initiative taken by Professor R. E.
Swain, of the chemistry department,
who represented the War Camp Com
munity interests in this locality.
