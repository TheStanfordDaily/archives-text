# PRACTICE FOR "BUNKER BEAN" PROGRESSING SUCCESSFULLY
## SOPHOMORE PLAY RIVALS FORMER YEARS Coach Believes Leads Are Best Amateurs to Be Found for Parts 
### 
"One of the snappiest comedies that
has ever been put on a Stanford stage,
and a real competitor to 'The Seven
Keys to Baldpate' and 'It Pays to Ad
vertise,' " is the way that Frank L.
Matheiu, who is coaching "His Majesty,

Bunker Bean," the 1921 Sophomore play,
characterizes the production.
Rehearsals for the play, which is sched
uled to he held at the Stanford Assem
bly Hall on the evening of March 7,
have been going on for the past two
weeks and the production is fast round
ing into shape.
In selecting the leads for the play,


Miss Dorothy Johnston of San Jose
and E. L. McElroy of Willits, Cal.,
who take the leading parts in the
1921 play, "His Majesty, Bunker
Bean," which will be produced at
the Assembly Hall on March 7.
Coach Matliciu has picked out two stu
dents whom he believes will make one
of the best adaptations that he has ever
found among amateur talent
Miss Dorothy Johnston, *21, who takes
the part of Marie, the Flapper, in Harry
Leon Wilson's comedy, is expected to
spring many surprises. Miss Johnston
has had considerable experience in ama
teur dramatics before coming to Stan
ford and was selected for this part from
a list of mÂ®re than fifty candidates.
E. L. McElroy, '21, playing opposite
Miss Johnston, takes the part of "His
Majesty, Bunker Bean." McElroy takes
the lively role to which he is assigned
with a naturalness which promises to be
one of the leading attractions of the
play.
The success of the play does not hinge
to any extent on the leads, for the cast
is a well balanced one and several char
acter roles will add considerable interest
to dramatic enthusiasts.
