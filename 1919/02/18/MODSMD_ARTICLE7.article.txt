# TRACK MEN BEGIN REGULAR PRACTICE
## Weekly Meets Between Frosh and Varsity Will Be Arranged by Coach 
### 
Track practice for the 1919 season
started off officially last night under
the supervision of Captain "Crackie"
Teitsworth. From now on the sched
ule of practice will include some form
of workout six times a week.
Weekly informal meets to provide
competition among members of the
varsity and freshman squads will be
arranged. These meets will be held
Saturday afternoon instead of Satur
day morning as was the case last year.
Afternoon training is known to have
more bencficial results than that done
in the morning, and Captain Teits
worth is anxious to have the men get
accustomed to running during the
time of day that meets regularly take
place.
The big meet with the nine and
Gold is only two and one-half months
away and the freshman contest is
scheduled two weeks earlier. It will
require constant training, especially
on the part of distance mnn, to round
into shape by that time.
Some men have already done con
siderable training, but the condition
of the weather has kept most of the
mon off the track.
Captain Teitsworth gave the track
candidates a talk Friday afternoon, in
which he outlined some simple train
ing principles and gave general dope
on getting into shape for the coming
season. At present, distance men will
do considerable cross-country work
before starting steady training on the
oval.
