# Ram's Head Show Promises Laughs
## Biff! Bang!! Bullsheveek!!! Gives Indication of Being Success 
### 
"Biff! Bam!! Bullsheveek!!!" the
Ram's Head musical extravaganza, j
which will be seen on the local boards j
next Friday night in the Assembly <
Hall, is fortunate in having some of j
the cleverest dramatic talent seen on!
a Stanford stage in years, according
to those who have been watching the
rehearsals.
Robert McConaughy, '21, playing
the laugh-making part of Czar Sambo
of the Russian Bolshevik, is a transfer
from Yale, where he scored several
successes in dramatics. He has an
excellent voice and his song, "I've
Gotta Stop Rollin' Them Bones,"
seems certain to be a hit.
The two Russian dictators, "Linen"
and "Trotsky," are played by J. â€¢ P.;
Schnier, '20, and R. A. Armstrong,!
'21, and they are expected to bring
down many laughs from the audience.
R. G. Wheaton, '19, who has just
returned from the navy, will take the
straight lead in "Biff! Bang!! Bull
sheveek!!!" He has taken part in
many junior operas of former years.
From all present indications this first!
campus production since the war
looks like it will be a tremendous
laughing success. Tickets are on sale
at the Bookstore and Robinson &
Crandall's in Palo Alto. There are
still several good seats left.
