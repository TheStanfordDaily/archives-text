A musical concert will vary the usual
Tuesday evening lecture tonight, when
Miss Grace G. Becker, 'cellist, and Miss
Madeline Becker, pianist, of Berkeley,
will render a short program. These
young women have worked together in
concerts throughout the Pacific coast
and have been highly spoken of. The

intonation. She gives evidence that she
is sufficiently endowed with comprehen

endeavors." ,
