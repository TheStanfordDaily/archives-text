# RUGBY FIFTEEN IS IN PRIME SHAPE FOR "BIG GAME"
## VARSITY TO PLAY PALO ALTO TEAM TONIGHT Flanigan is Satisfied With the Work of His Team in Practice 
### 
COACH "Pete" Flanigan put his
rugby fifteen through a stiff prac
tice last night and will end the weeks'
work tonight with a game with the Palo
Alto Athletic Club. After a stiff game
for forty minutes with the second team.
Manigan practiced the forwards in drib
bling and receiving the ball from line
outs. The backs received instruction in
passing rushes and kicking to touch.
Long will probably be able to get into
the game Saturday at first five. The
contest with the Palo Alto Athletic Club
tonight will decide several positions in
the scrum and also whether Sheldon or
Scofield will start at second five and
Parker or Gillette at center three-quar
ters. Falk and Repath are certain of
their berths on the wings, according to
present indications, and Kinney and
Holt are contesting for the fullback po
sition.
Last night's practice was full of light
and pep, and for the first time this sea
son Flanigan was satisfied with the
work-out. The forwards are working
together in "big game" style and the
backs showed brilliant form.
Part of the strength of the Cardinal
team is in the weight of the forwards,
| since the scrum will easily average I/O
pounds. Nothing is known of the
I strength of the California pack, but it
j is doubtful if they can rcach this mark.
"The big game" will start at 2:30 on
| Saturday and admission will be 50 cents
| plus war tax. Registration certificates
j will not admit.
