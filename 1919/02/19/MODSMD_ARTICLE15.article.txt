# FINAL PULL
## 
### 
WITH the crew campaign reaching a conclusion this evening, the hard work
of digging extra hard in holey pockets is once again up to the students.
The crew committee has industriously scoured the campus and picked up some
of the available cash. There is still a deficit of several hundred dollars; this has
to be met tonight at latest.
If Stanford wants another crew to enhance its reputation back East in a
future Poughkeepsie, or even in a Western intercollegiate regatta, the decision
rests with the results of the rally this evening. With Coach Husky Guercna as
one of the speakers, those Stanford men who are strangers to crew successes will
have the actual proof put before them of the good of crew work for the individual
as well as the general reputation of the University. With the famous Guerena
coxing, the final pull on the oars is at Encina tonight.
