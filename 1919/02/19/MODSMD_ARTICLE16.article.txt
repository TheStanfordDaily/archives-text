ACTION by the Student Council at a meeting last evening against excessive
roughing at campus dances is a step in the right direction. The council took
pains to point out that roughing as a custom was not censured, but conduct unbe
coming to any student in the University was distinctly criticized.
Roughing is an institution peculiarly Stanford, that we at Stanford wish to
see remain; riotous action and unnecessary forceful entries into dance and other
parties is hardly a part of that roughing system that one would want to encourage.
The action of the council in its attempt to curb unseasonable roughing conduct
is headed in the right direction, since it is timely action of this sort that, if prop
erly observed and followed, would ultmately result in the maintenance of customs
in their original and intended form rather than in their exaggerated and overdone
recent development. Let's keep roughing, but let's keep it in a form that will not
make us ashamed of it.
