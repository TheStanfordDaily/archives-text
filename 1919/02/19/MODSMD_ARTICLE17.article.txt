# Professor Martin Addresses Club on Latin America
## 
### 
"The response of Latin America to
the cause of the Allies in the Great War
has been extremely gratifying, not so
much in actual accomplishment as in
willingness to help," said Associate Pro
fessor Percy Martin of the history de
partment in his talk before Cosmopoli
tan Club last Monday night. "In re
sponse to President Wilson's appeal to
all neutrals to follow the example of the
United States in entering the war. eight
out of twenty Latin-American republics
entered the war. These republics com
prise two-thirds of the total area and
three-fifths of the population of the
Latin-American states."
Professor Martin ascribes the favor
able attitude of the Latin-Americans to
three things: respect and admiration for
France and Belgium; the instinct of self
preservation, for they recognized that
the defeat of the United States would
be their own defeat; and third, "Pan-

American solidarity," which recognizes
certain common ideals among all Ameri
can states. The unfavorable element
was caused by successful German propa
ganda, a hostile attitude of the Catholic
clergy against the Allies, and a latent
suspicion of the United States which
smoulders among some Latin-American
states.
Professor Martin concluded his lec
ture by discussing the actual parts
played in the war by Latin-American
states, dwelling particularly upon Bra
zil, Cuba and Panama.
