# S.L. SEWARD WRITES OF GERMANS' EFFECT ON ALSATIAN LIFE
## 
### 
Professor L. S. Seward, who is in the
ambulance division in Alsace, tells of
the family life there in a recent letter
to Dr. W. H. Carruth, head of the
English department:
"After the first delirium of emanci
pation is past," he writes, "life resumes
its sense of serenity in neighborly pleas
ures, free from the degrading con
sciousness of a constant menace. You
come to feel it, little by little, what a
genius these Germans displayed, here as
in Belgium, for poisoning the lives
brought under their influence. Victory
is worth the winning, when it trans
lates itself into a resumption of happy,
neighborly life; and whatever it may
gain of miss in tlie way of political ef
fects, this it has already gained should
not be forgotten."
In speaking of the attitude of the
Germans as it appears to one in Eu
rope, Professor Seward writes:
"What strikes me most is the amaz
'tig stupidity of the Germans in their
failure to realize that they are thor
oughly beaten, and that the Allies hold
a veto on any given act they can con
template. Sooner or later the peace
terms will shock them into a sense of
ealization. Germany, at present, after
the armistice, reminds me of the man
whose head was severed by so clean a
stroke that it stayed in its place with
ut even inconveniencing him. But
when he learns the peace terms it'll
make him sneeze—and then!
"Some American senators, if correct
reports reach here, seem impervious
to the fact that something really has
happened in the world, and their nar
row, carping criticism furnishes a pa
thetic spectacle."
