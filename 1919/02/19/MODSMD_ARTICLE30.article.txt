# ABOUT STANFORD
## 
### 
The nucleus of the Stanford Mu
seum collection was first kept in a
number of rooms 011 the top floor of
I he former famous Stanford mansion
in San Francisco.
This collection was begun by Le
land when he made a trip to Europe
in 1880. After his death his parents
added to it, planning to transfer the
collection as soon as the University
museum was completed.
The articles came from every quar
ter of the globe. Art, science and in
vention were represented. From
dusty Egyptian tombs were wheat
cakes that were digestible 3,000 years
ago. Young Stanford spent a good
deal of his time in Egypt, and he col
lected many strange, rare and beauti
ful things from that country.
American relies were very numer
ous. There were stacks of the earli
est books printed in this country, be
sides specimens of the first ones print-

Ed in Europe. Orders signed by Pres
ident Washington and his generals,
the coat and vest worn by General
Grant at Appamattox, Indian arms,
totums, works of art and household
furniture.
The daintiest articles of the Greek
collection were the Tanagra "figuri
ner," terra-cotta figures excavated
near Tanagra, Greece. Baron Roths
child had the best collection in exist
ence, but Mrs. Stanford did her best
to duplicate it. To her mind these
I figures were among the most beauti
ful works of art placed in the mu
seum.
The collection became so extensive
that not all of it could be shown at
the Stanford home. "There are cases
and cases stored away downstairs,"
I Mrs. Stanford said when showing a
' party of guests through the rooms.
She later had the entire collection ar
ranged and classified in the museum
1 where they are now on exhibit.
