# Lake Still Too Low; Crew Practice Postponed
## 
### 
Inquiries have been coming in daily
to the manager of the women's crew,
Miss Emelie Anderson, '19, as to
whether or not there will be a crew
this year. At the present time, the
manager states that the boathouse and
t lie shell are in condition, but the
water in the lake must rise at least
four feet more, before crew practice
will be practicable.
Women's crew has always been an
integral part of women's athletics, un
til last year, when the lake was too
shallow for practice. Another storm
will add the necessary depth to the
lake and make crew possible.
With several old members of the
crew still in college, there is a good
foundation for crew. Eliner Eppich,
'19. bow; Ellen Calhoun, '20, bow;
Irene Pauly, '18. bow; Agnes Ander
sen. '20. stroke; Emelie Anderson, '19,
stroke, and Doris flyer, bow, were all
on former crews and are eligible for
crew this year.
