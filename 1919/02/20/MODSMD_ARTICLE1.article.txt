# LOWELL EMPHASIZES POST-WAR PROBLEMS IN ADDRESS
## DISCUSSES STUDENT DUTY "Revulsion of Feeling" Must Be Met by Idealism in Universities 
### 
"The biggest problem of the war has
come after the signing of the armistice
and that is, how are we going to meet
the revulsion of feeling which brings
about an intense condition of moral
lassitude in the community?" This was
the question which Dr. A. Lawrence
Lowell, president of Harvard University,
emphasized in his address at the all
university assembly held yesterday after
noon in the Assembly Hall.
"It is in the solving of the after
war problem that the university has an
obligation. Destruction in war is tangi
ble and intangible. The material loss is
more often the first consideration of a
nation coming out of a war, but the in
tangible destruction is by far the most
important consideration. A nation which
has been worked up to a high state of
spiritual exaltation must inevitably feel
the reaction, and there is no better place
to meet this reaction than in the univer
sities themselves."
President Lowell went on to outline
the past history of post-war reactions.
In the wars of Napoleon, England was
left her factories and France a sordid
tradition of intense extravagance. In
our country, politics never sank to so
low an ebb as in the period immediately
following the civil war. The wars of
'66 and 70 in Germany produced a
materialism in whicli philosophers were
allowed to teach that nothing could be
higher than the state and that all indi
vidual effort was only for the material
advancement of the taste.
"Were these results accidents?" Dr.
Lowell continued. "That is the problem
'of the victor. The signs of moral lassi
tude have already come from the great
conference across the sea. Commerce
and other material demands have al
ready been made, and the great danger
of materialism is again at hand.
"Whose duty is it to keep the ideals
of men alive, the ideals of men fresh,
if not ours at the universities? Here
it is that young men dream dreams and
the older of us have visions, and it is
our sacred duty to see that these dreams
and these visions are passed along to
the coming generations. Our universi
ties are the foundations of learning, and
it is our dreams and our visions through
which the lighthouses of human knowl
edge will be kept burning."
