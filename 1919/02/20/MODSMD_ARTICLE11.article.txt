# OLD BASEBALL STARS WILL RETURN FOR NEXT QUARTER
## INFIELD TO BE STRONG Stevens, Shriver, Hoever, and Pike Will Be on Deck for Varsity 
### 
"Mush" Stevens, '17, captain-elect of
the 1918 baseball team; "Mel" Shriver,
'19, former varsity second baseman;
"Rill" Pike, '20, first baseman on his
freshman team, and "Gus" Hoever, '18,
varsity pitcher, are baseball stars who
intend to return to college next quar
ter and will be eligible for the varsity
baseball team. With these men,

Coach Evans will have a nucleus for a
strong varsity.
Stevens can play either third base
or shortstop and is considered a star
in either of these positions. With
Captain "Jim" Galloway and Stevens
holding down the difficult corner and
the short field, the Cardinal infield
will be impenetrable on the left side
of the diamond. Shriver is known as
a clever fielder and a strong hitter
and either he or Doe will be an able

guardian for the keystone sack. Pike
and Teubner will have to fight it out
for the first base position.
With Hoever back, Evans will have
a man who will be able to do the brunt
of the twirling work. Newlands and
Gillis are candidates for the box, and
are showing good form. On the re
ceiving end of the battery there are
several new men working out. Stew
art, Fdley and Smith, and probably
Dundy, are the candidates here, and
from among them Evans will be able
to select an abler catcher.
"Ken" Lilley, captain of last year's
varsity, will be back in center field
after the close of the basketball sea
son, and his bat will be a big aid to
the scoring machine which Coach
Evans hopes to build up. The other
outfield positions will be filled by sev
eral promising men who are working
out for the garden positions.
On Saturday morning at 10:30 the
varsity will play its first game of the
season with a team from the Bank of
Italy. Several of the new men will
be given an opportunity to show their
ability in this contest.
