# OLD BASEBALL STARS WILL RETURN FOR NEXT QUARTER
## INFIELD TO BE STRONG Stevens, Shriver, Hoever, and Pike Will Be on Deck for Varsity 
### 
"Mush" Stevens, '17, captain-elect of
the 1918 baseball team; "Mel" Shriver,
'19, former varsity second baseman;
"Rill" Pike, '20, first baseman on his
freshman team, and "Gus" Hoever, '18,
varsity pitcher, are baseball stars who
intend to return to college next quar
ter and will be eligible for the varsity
baseball team. With these men,

Coach Evans will have a nucleus for a
strong varsity.
Stevens can play either third base
or shortstop and is considered a star
in either of these positions. With
Captain "Jim" Galloway and Stevens
holding down the difficult corner and
the short field, the Cardinal infield
will be impenetrable on the left side
of the diamond. Shriver is known as
a clever fielder and a strong hitter
and either he or Doe will be an able


"Gus" Hoever,
Varsity
Moundsman,
who will be
back next
quarter to
strengthen
the
Cardinal
Pitching
Staff.
