# CASALS CONCERT TO BE AT 8:15 TONIGHT
## Celebrated Spanish Cellist Will Present Classical Program 
### 
Pablo Casalß will begin his concert
in the Assembly Hall this evening at
8:15.
There are few great masters of the
'cello because the difficulties it offers
are too great, and.it is safe to say,
that Casals has been more widely ac
claimed by musicians than any of his
colleagues. He has been acknowl
edged to be the greatest living inter
preter of the classics, and because of
this, two numbers on the following
program offers especial interest:
1. Sonata Haendel
Grave
Allegro
Sarabande
Allegro
2. Concert in A Saint-Saens
Allegro non troppo
Allegretto con moto
Terfipo I—Allegro
(Without interruption)
3. Suite in C Major Bach
Prelude
AUemande
Courantc
Sarabande
Bourree
Gigue
(For 'cello alone)
4. (a) Air Jean Huvc
lb) Papillons Faure
(c) Mazurka Popper
(d) Tarantelle Popper
