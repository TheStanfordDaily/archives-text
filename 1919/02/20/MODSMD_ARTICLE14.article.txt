# BIG MEN IN BIG GAMES
## 
### 
PERSONAL touch with big men helps to make big men. This is one of the
reasons why people go to colleges and why often one person prefers one col
lege to another. Contact with big men of the community, the state, or the nation is
something that everyone looks forward to in a university. It is part of university
life, it is part of the constant struggle for education, it is part of the more per
sonal work of self-development.
The proof of these statements lies in the well-filled Assembly Hall that greet
ed President Lowell of Harvard yesterday. The mere mention of a big name and
a big person sufficed to fill the lower tloor and balcony. No further proof is
needed that the university community welcomes the opportunity to hear from
people of standing and of reputation.
There has seldom if ever before been a time when the universities in the
country were crying for information from authorities upon big questions such as
at present. And, as pointed out yesterday, there never has been a time when such
instruction could accomplish more good than at present.
The facilities for such instruction are at hand. The big men of the country
are working with that end in view. Instruction on the principles of the League
of Nations,"reconstruction and other problems is their purpose. The very distin
guished group of visitors in San Francisco are there for that purpose.
Stanford represents one of these communities that is crying for instruction
and inspiration in undertaking the work that is to come. Stanford men and
women want to hear big men and women, to learn of future tasks from them.
If the university administration can manage to bring these people to Stanford,
they will be doing the biggest thing in the college career of the present generation.
Stanford should not be second to other institutions on the Pacific Coast in
the matter of greeting and hearing distinguished strangers. If the University of
California can hear from William Howard Taft, cannot Stanford also be afforded
this privilege?
The weekly assembly was successful to a ccrtain point. It was successful
when the speakers appealed because of their reputation and standing. It was suc
cessful when the time was such that as many as possible could attend. VVe are
not calling for a fixed weekly assembly, nor are we urging any fixed time for
assemblies. We merely wish to propose that big men be brought to Stanford in
big times.
