# PROFESSOR DURAND RETURNS TO CAMPUS
## Engineers Plan Smoke to Welcome Department Head Wednesday 
### 
An elaborate smoker is planned for
Wednesday to welcome back to the
University Professor William Fred
erick Durand, who will return Satur
day from extensive work in govern
ment service.
Professor Durand was head of the
Mechanical Engineering department at
the outbreak of the war, when his
duties as head of the National Ad
visory Committee on Aeronautics took
him to Washington. In this capacity
he was sent to France, where he
worked continually during the prog
ress of the war.
More recently Mr. Durand has been
acting as scientific attache to the
American legation at Paris. Here his
department acted as a clearing house
for scientific and technical informa
tion between the two nations, for
America and France attempted in this
way to exchange the resutls of great
war research work.
The big smoker at the Union Wed
nesday will be given by the local stu
dent branch of the American Society
of Mechanical Engineers. The society
expects, however, to extend invitations
to the geology, mining, civil and elec
trical engineering students and faculty
as well. They desire to make this the
best attended and most enthusiastic
smoker in months, for it is in honor
of one of the most distinguished mem
bers Stanford has in American en
gineering circles.
Professor Durand has been in
Washington for the last few days clos
ing his official duties, and he now
comes direct to San Francisco, his ar
rival being dated for Saturday. It itf
not certain that he will at once as
sume his position as head of the me
chanical engineering department, but
it is announced definitely, however,
that he will be at his old post during
the spring quatrer.
