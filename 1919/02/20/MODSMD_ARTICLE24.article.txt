# FRESHMAN CLASS ELECT OFFICERS AT NOON ON FRIDAY
## 
### 
Tomorrow at 12:45, in Room 214,
the Freshman Class will hold its first
meeting of the quarter. N. Au√ütin,
who was elected secretary and treas
urer, has resigned. As this position
entails too many responsibilities for
one person, the office will be divided
and two people will be elected to fill
them. This is the first time in many
years that the position of secretary and
treasurer has not been held by one
person.
Committees will be appointed for
the 1922 jolly-up and the Irish mara
thon. A jazz commmittee will also be
appointed for inter-class debates and
athletics. An upperclassman will open
the meeting, and will speak to the
freshmen for a few minutes on Stan
ford customs and traditions.
