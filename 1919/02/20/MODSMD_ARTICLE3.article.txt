# Henry Can Now Get a Line on Roble Damsels

### 
Dead Pops:
I have some very extraordinary fine
news for you this time, Pops. That's
why I am writing to you. It is that
I think I am going to need some more
party dresses now pretty soon. You
see, Pops, my intuition, which never
fails, as you know, is telling me that
Henry will be coming hack on the joh
right away quick now. You remember
I told you about Henry before. Henry
was awful nice to me until that shoe
refixer that lives between the post
office and the Lake (it is a lake now,
Pops) took away all his money from
him and Henry couldn't afford to be
awful nice to me any more. But now
Henry won't have to bother about the
price of leather any more. All Henry
needs is patience. We got phones in
Roble now, and all Henry has to do is
to wait until one of those three lines j
isn't busy any more with fellows want
ing to talk to me. Then if I haven't
accepted all the other fellows first, !
Henry can tell me what parties he wants
me to go to with him without wearing
any of the plush ofT the divan, and I (
can get all dressed up and goâ€”if I have
anything to dress up in. Henry is an
awfid fine fellow, Pops, and when I
come home this summer, and he comes
over to wear some of the plush off our i
divan, don't ask him what salary he
gets, will you. Pops? He might think
of the price of twice as much shoe
leather then and, well anyway, don't ask
him, Pops.
Yours till the phone brings better
results.
Clarinda.
P. S. You don't need to make the
dresses yourself, Pops. There is a fine
dressmaker her in California who will
do all that cheerfully if you give her a
little encouragement. You know the
kind, Pops.
