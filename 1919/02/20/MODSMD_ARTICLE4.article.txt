# VARSITY QUINTET WILL MEET NEVADA SATURDAY NIGHT
## 
### 
Stanford varsity five will leave the
"Farm" tomorrow evening for Reno,
fwhere they will play their fifth league
of Nevada team. The game is sched
: uled for Saturday night in Reno.
Very little is known about the merits
i .of the Nevada team. They are not
likely to give the Varsity any serious
trouble unless they can spring some
surprises. The Reno floor is known to
be a particular slippery one and has
been a source of serious handicap to
teams playing there in the past.
Seven players will make the trip.
Williamson, Caughey, and Lilly as
guards; Righter as center; Esgen, Moul
ton, and either Hood or Pelouze as
forwards, will go to Nevada.
The freshman quintet will go to
Berkeley Saturday night to play the
second game of their series with the
Blue and Gold yearlings. With the
overwhelming defeat of last week, the
freshmen will have to come through
with a lot of new stuff if they are to
have a chance with the Bruin "babes."
Pelouze will make the trip and will be
in charge of the team if he does not
go to Reno with the Varsity.
