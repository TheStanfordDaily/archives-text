# F. S. MURRAY WILL HELP COACH 1919 TRACK CANDIDATES
## MALONEY IS EXPECTED BACK FROM ENGLAND Plenty of Coaching Material Assured for Men on the Oval 
### 
F. S. "Feg" Murray, '17, four-star
Stanford athlete, and one of the best
sprinters and hurdlers that ever
donned a Cardinal jersey, will act as
assistant coach for the track team dur
ing the coming season. Murray will
devote most of his time toward help
ing the sprinters and hurdlers.
Murray has just returned from
Prance, where he was a sergeant in
the American camouilage service, and
is going into training for the next two
months in order to compete in meets
for the Olympic Club in San Fran
cisco. He will do his training on the
Stanford oval and has volunteered to
help coach the sprinters and hurdlers
while he is getting into condition.
Thinks Outlook Good
Last night for the first time since
the war began Murray worked out on
the Stanford oval. He is enthusiastic
over the candidates who have shown
up for the track team and believes he
can turn out some excellent sprinters
and hurdlers from the material pres
ent.
Murray's presence at this time is
particularly fortunate for the track
men as Coach Evans and "Reg"
Caughey are too busy with basketball
to help with track until after the first
of March.
Maloney Will Return
H. Wilfred Maloney, for ten years
a trainer of Stanford athletic teams,
is expected home the first part of
March from England, where he has
been engaged in physical training in
connection with the army. Maloney
will resume his duties here and will
be on hand to help train and condi
tion the track men.
Plenty of supervision for track men
will be assured from now on. Captain
Teitsworth will be on hand to handle
the distance and middle distance run
ners. Murray will take care of the
sprinters and hurdlers, and as soon
as the basketball season is over
Caughey will devote all of his spare
time working with the new men on
the weights. Hutchins and Green will
help out the pole vaulters.
Track practice is being held every
day this week and in informal meet
over shortened distances will be held
Saturday morning if the weather does
not interfere. This meet will include
competition in all events except the
hurdlers.
Captain Teitsworth has called the
meet for 10:30 a.m., just after the
Washington Birthday parade by the
fraternity freshmen.
