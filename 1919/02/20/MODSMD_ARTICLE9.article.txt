# FEATURES FOR JUNIOR WEEK
## 
### 
Plans for a live Junior week at the
end of the fourth week of April, the
24th, the 25th and the 26th, are being
carefully worked out, and final arrange
ments are nearly in completion, accord
ing to the various committees in charge.
L. L. Pickering, '20, is chairman of
the Junior Opera Committee, and the
opera will come on the first of the three
days set aside for Junior week. The
author of the plot has been selected, and
is now working on the different scenes,
but the name will not be divulged until
next week. Musical selections and song
specialities are also being written, and
it is the aim of the committee to have
everything in readiness for the tryouts
at the end of the present quarter.

Elaborate preparations are being
made for the Junior prom which is
scheduled for the 25th, and which will
be a formal affair in all respects. S. G.
Pillsbury heads the Prom Committee,
and announces that the music will be a
special feature of the evening, and some
thing entirely novel on the Stanford
campus. Encina gymnasium will be ar
tistically decorated for the occasion, hut
these plans are for the present being
kept secret.
April 26th is Junior day and Athletic
day. H. G. Swendsen is in charge of all
the athletic events, and promises some
exciting lake sports on that day. There
will also be a freshman track meet with
the University of California and one be
tween the Olympic Club and the Varsity.
