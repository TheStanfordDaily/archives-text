# BROWN ADVOCATES LEAGUE OF NATIONS TO INSURE IDEALS
## ASSEMBLY ENTHUSIASTIC Hun Sentimentality Scored as Speaker Outlines Basis for Peace 
### 
i 4 '"p HE abdication of the Kaiser
I marked the passing of a sys
tem, but tiie guilt did not lie with one
man alone. The guilt lies upon the
nation which supported that system,
and no acknowledgment has come
from the German nation that they
were wrong. Some acknowledgment
must come, and the people of the
world must not be swept from their
moral moorings by the slothy senti
mentality of the German people."
These were the sentiments of Dr.
Charles R. Brown, Dean of the School
of Religion at Yale University, which
brought enthusiastic applause at the
student assembly held yesterday after
noon in the Assembly Hall.
Dr. Brown Outlines League
Dr. Brown made four leading points
in his remarks concerning the League
of Nations. As a background, he out
lined the passing of the system of mil
itarism and the balance of power. The
passing of this system demonstrated
the essential soundness of morality in
the human makeup and also empha
sized the fact that there is such a
thing as divine justice. With these
results of the war in mind, the next
natural question to consider is the
manner in which to make these re- j
suits permanent, which formed the
last point in the address.
"There are three methods which j
may be considered to insure the peace |
of the world," said Dr. Brown. "The !
first has already been tried and found
wanting. That is the. method of im
perialism. Germany attempted it and
Rome came nearest to making it a
success. But the system has failed
and therefore cannot be further con
sidered.
"The second possibility is the bal
ance of power. The trouble with that
method is that the system is played
out. It broke down during the latter
part of the nineteenth century and
cannot be revived.
-"The only alternative left is the
League of Nations, an expression of
true internationalism, based 011 law
and mutual cooperation. We all ad
mit that there are tremendous difficul
ties. There must be faith in our fel
low men and in human nature, and it
is the men of faith who will remove
these mountains of difficulty. Through
faith alone will the realization of this
Utopian dream be made possible.'
In conclusion Dr. Brown spoke of
the significance of the Statue of Lib
erty and the tremendous importance
of keeping the ideals of the American
nation before the world.
"Let that torch shine on," he said,
"and may its rays never be dimmed
until all the nations of earth walk in
it."
