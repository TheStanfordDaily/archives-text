# RAM'S HEAD WILL PRESENT ITS FIRST SHOW SINCE WAR
## SCRIPT BY M.A. HAGEN "Biff! Bang! Bullsheveek!" to Be Given Tonight in Assembly Hall 
### 
TONIGHT in the Assembly Hall at
8:15 the curtain will raise on "Biff I
Bang!! Bullsheveek!!!" Ram's Head so
ciety's musical extravaganza. This will
mark the first piece of campus dramatics
since the close of the war.
The author of "Biff! Bang!! Bull
sheveek!!!" is M. A. Hagen, 'IS, and
the musical score has been written
mainly by I. H. Larsen, '18, and A. D.
Wilkie, '18, L. L. Pickering, '20, coached
the show.
The plot of the show is just what the
title suggests. It conccrns the doings
of three Bolshevik conspirators, "Linen,"
"Trotsky" and "Czar Sambo," played
by R. A. Armstrong, '21, J. P. Schnier,
'20, and R. E. MacConaughy, '21. The
curtain raises on the scene of the Bol
shevik army headquarters. The second
act takes place in the "Rush-in Inn," the
rendezvous of the three plotters. The
plans of these three are very much up
set by a Bolshevikess, Maggieovitch
Pippsky, played by A. S. Glikbarg, '19.
As regards lavishness of costume
there has been nothing on the Stanford
stage for some time to equal the pres
ent Ram's Head production. The out
fitting of the Bolshevik army reaches
the acme of the outlandish. The cos
tumes of the chorus girls are guaran
teed to pass any rigid censorship.
The music, of which I. H. (Swede)
Larsen, '17, is in charge, is replete with
many tuneful hits. Among them are
the "Red Revolutionary Rag." "Czar
Sambo of the Russian [ Bullsheveek."
"I'm in Love with a Girl Like You" and
J "Dainty, Dimply, Darling, Dears."
A few seats still remain to he sold at
I the ticket window this evening.
