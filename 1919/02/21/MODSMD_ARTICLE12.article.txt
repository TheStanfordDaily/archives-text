# Boxers Will Hold Tourney Monday
## Scott and Leib Show Speed— Many Novices to Try for Honors 
### 
Next Monday afternoon at 4 o'clock
the first of a series of boxing tourna
ments will be called in the gallery of
the Encina gym. At this time all the
men of tl*- training classes will be al
lowed to participate. The meet is to
be staged in preparation for the big
tournament with California.
The tournament will in all probability
bring many new stars to the foreground.
Already some of the men have shown
surprising ability in class bouts and
will probably play close to older team
men, when it comes to the final tryouts.
Lineups for next Monday's tourna
ment have been made, the names of the
participants being as follows:
130-pound class—T. H. Topman vs.
J. W. Spratley.
140-pound class—S. Gardiner vs. T.
-J Ballinger.
150-pound class—L. M. Scott vs. L. 1,.
Leib.
160-pound class—J. 1- Porter vs. R.
I P. Hayes.
j 145-pound class—D. S. Cahn vs Jack
Strausse.
125-pound class P. 1. Aguerreve vs.
j A. H. Goldstone.
j In the boxing classes, Scott and Leib
are probably the best known for their
speed in "putting it over." P>oth men
have put up strong offensives and should
be well matched for a three-round bout
next week. Others of the class men.
such as Drew and Gardiner, have put
up strong fights all along.
Decisions of the various bouts will be
decided by the members of the class
after each of the bouts. The next tour
nament will be held in about two weeks.
