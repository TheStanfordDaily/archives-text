# STILL PLAYING
## 
### 
WITH an overwhelming defeat at American football at the hands of the
California eleven in the S. A. T. C. game of last quarter as something
to be atoned for in tomorrow's contest, the Rugby fifteen is presented with a
difficult problem.
The sudden loss in interest in Rugby on the campus has been very marked
in the past year; there is no denying the fact that Rugby no longer holds the
place that it once did. But Rugby still is a major sport, and a major sport
distinctly Stanford's.
Rugby this year should be Stanford's game, as American football was
Stanford's last quarter. It is in the hope of wiping out the sting of the over
whelming defeat in the other game that the team will take the field tomorrow
and the Stanford student body, we hope, pack the bleachers. There is a game
to be won, and it is Stanford's task to do this.
Not attempting to discuss the various merits of Rugby or American foot
ball, there is no denying the fact that Rugby is a game of intense interest to
spectators; a game with the University of California, and a game with such
a purpose as the contest tomorrow, should certainly create sufficient interest
to show that, while Stanford is to compote in the big American games of the
fall, it yet realizes that it is still playing Rugby.
