# STANFORD SHOULD DEFEAT BERKELEY BY 50-0 COUNT
## 
### H.G. SWENDSEN, '20 
That Stanford and California will
meet each other in competition in foot
hall should be enough to satisfy most
Cardinal fans, but Stanford has a j
chance to beat the Blue and Gold by at
least fifty j>oints in the big rugby battle!
tomorrow should be enough to fill the
stands with tooters.
Taken all in all, Stanford has turned
out few more powerful fifteen than is:
playing this year. Of course, new men!
never sound so good to college ears, \
equal those of the last two years, and i
as old men, but the forwards this year
the backs arc fast, heady players.
And California has nothing that looks!
like a rugby combination. There are j
some fast high school men playing on 1
the Blue and Gold squad, but that
knowledge of the game displayed by'
such men as Doe, Patrick, Flood, Long,
Parker, Falk, etc., cannot be found in
California players.
At Berkeley, the Blue and Gold sup
porters say they are "raw meat guys,"
and that delight in nothing better than
to humble Stanford in the dust, miles
deep if necessary. But from the out
look Stanford robbed the Golden Bear's
butcher shop in this case, for unless
something radical happens, the red
sweatered men will be eating the meat
out on the turf Saturday.
California has not taken enough inter-,
est in Rugby to turn out a decent squad!
for practices. Nevertheless, they claim .
they have fast, heavy, clever players.
If this is so, Coach Boek must have been '
keeping these men in the background all
season. i
The game starts at three o'clock to-'
morrow. By four the score-board I
should read, Stanford 50, California 0.
