# SMOKE-UPS AGAIN TAKE AN INTEREST IN STUDENT LIFE
## 
### 
"Smoks Ups" have been issued from
the Registrar's office, and are now
waiting to be called for at the post
office. These articles are a new thing
for this year, and it will undoubtedly

be difficult for students to get used to
them again after last quarter's leni
ency.
Due to the fact that there was so
much illness last quarter and because
so many students were stricken with
the influenza, the Committee 011 Schol
arship voted not to send any unsatis
factory notices. Now, however, mat
ters have returned to their normal
status, and again the traditional
"smoke up" demands recognition.
