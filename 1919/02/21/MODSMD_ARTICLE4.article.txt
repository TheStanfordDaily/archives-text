# Zeke Has Troubles While He is Hashing at a Girls' "Eating Club" on the Row
## 
### 
Der Parents:
Wei now at last I am being recog
nized at this colliche. They are going
to give me a chance at last to earn my
bread and oleomargarine. I can now
write yon with pride in my voice that
I am a heaver. I wait on the table at
the eating club of a collection of girls,
i I don't eggsactly know the name of
1 this eating club, but it sounds something
' like Lwful Lowe. Der flks, I hezitated
some time before i gave in, becaze I
realize that a boy haz to be very care
ful when he enters a colliche not to
ruwin hez reputashun right at the be
ginning by getting mixed up with a
dizzy bunch of wimmin. But I really
don't think there is anything the matter
with them. They are probably just try
ing to be modest and pretend they aren't
very much, when they really think they
are: I Mil be able to tell you more
about these girls in my next letter as I
will probably know them much better
then.
There is one girl that is—no not fat
becaze a prof, told us that it is not
tackful to call a lady fat, wun shuld say
stout —this girl is just sort of thick,
but she smiles and smiles.
I wear an apron white an ptire and
now and now I find it rather difikult to
heave and to listen to the steady flow
of wit that rolls off of twenty tongues
and gurguls up from twenty lungs.
These wimmin certainly have all reck
kords beat for conversashun. Then j
after they finish eating they ups and
sings—"WE love thee derssorere —ere —|
i—tea." I could have wept it was so
touching, onlie they didn't all sing, some
just played with their napkin rings.
Also der parents I must tell you
about the mens' eating clubs, at this
unionversary. They have houses of dif
ferent shades up on a street called the
Roe. They have been hastening—no, I
mean rushing me to several of these
clubs. "Yell and Grab' seems to be
their motto. The names of these mens'
clubs arc just as queer as the wimmins'.
Once of these places is Bet-A-Pie Club,
but don't wurry paw I won't join any
gambling joint like that.
Yours ever dootiful son,
Zf.ke.
