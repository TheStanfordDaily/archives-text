Tomorrow's rugby game should give
plenty of excitement and thrills to
Stanford fans. It is hard to figure
what the result will be, having no line
on California's team, but in the two

weeks that our team has been practic
ing they have shown some great im
provement.
While the team is not as mature as
the teams of 1917, they will show up
very favorably.

"Charlie" Doe, halfback and captain
of the Varsity fifteen, whose playing
and knowledge of the game will be
a big factor in tomorrow's play.
with the confidence that means much
winning a game.
The team will not be selected till
this evening, when 1 will select one that
will do credit to Stanford. Tomorrow
1 am expecting sensations from Long,
Doe and Falk in the backfield, and the
forwards as a whole will hold any op
position. As I remarked before, it is
hard to figure out who will win, but
I have confidence in the Stanford pack
to put up an up-to-tandard fight.
