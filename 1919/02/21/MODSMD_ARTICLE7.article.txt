# CARDINAL SET TO MEET BERKELEY PACK IN BIG RUGBY SCRAP TOMORROW
## STANFORD VICTORY IS PREDICTED BY COACH FLANIGAN 
### PETE FLANAGAN 
Tomorrow's rugby game should give
plenty of excitement and thrills to
Stanford fans. It is hard to figure
what the result will be, having no line
on California's team, but in the two

weeks that our team has been practic
ing they have shown some great im
provement.
While the team is not as mature as
the teams of 1917, they will show up
very favorably.
Every player will go on the field


"Charlie" Doe, halfback and captain
of the Varsity fifteen, whose playing
and knowledge of the game will be
a big factor in tomorrow's play.
