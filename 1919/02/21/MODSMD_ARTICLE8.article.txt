## 
### C.E.CROWE, '21 
Coach "Pete" Flanigan has an
nounced the foliowing as the prob
able line-up for tomorrow's game:
Henry and Wrenn, front rank.
Watts, lock.
Adams and Clark, side rank.
Flood and Boulware, rear rank.
Doe, half.
Long, first five.
Nagel, second five.
Parker, center three-quarters.
Falk and Repath, wings.
Kinney or Holt, fullback.

Upon the above fifteen men.and sev
eral substitutes, "Pete" Flanigan
places his hopes for a decisive victory
over the rugby pack from the Univer
sity of California on the Stanford turf
tomorow afternoon at 3 o'clock. Flan
igan has trained his men to the min
ute, and with the advantage of expen
ence and knowledge of the game, he
is confident of a Stanford victory over
the Blue and Gold warriors.
With Captain Charlie Doe at half
back, Stanford has a skipper who is
worthy to direct the team on the field.
Doe played on last year's victorious
team, and his tackling and skill in get
ting the ball away characterized him
as a star in the halfback position. He
can be counted upon to keep the back
field in smooth working order and di
rect the forwards in their play.
Long at first is a veteran in the
backfield, and if his leg holds up un
der the strain, he can be counted for
several tries in the course of the game.
Long is able to keep the backs in or
der and gets the ball away fast. N'agel
at second five, although light, is one
of the best backs on the team. He is
a shifty runner and his speed enables
him to advance the passing rushes In
fast style.
Parker at center three-quarters is
an able kicker and his weight is a big
asset in passing rushes. One of Par
ker's best qualities is the knowledge
of the right time to pass the ball. On
the wings, Falk and Repatli are two
of the best men ever seen on a Stan
ford team. They are fast and heady
runners and each of them are good
for several tries.
The forwards count as a large fac
tor of the team both on the offensive
and defensive. Patrick, Adams, and
Flood are excellent dribblers and Pat
rick and Clark and Adams are good
men in the lineouts. Henry and
Wrenn are good at hooking the hall
hack in scrum formation.
Kinney and Holt arc the two full
lacks. Both of these men arc able play
ers and the final choice for the position
is still in the air. Holt is a strong
tackier but he is not as good as Kinney
in kicking to touch. Both players will
probably get into the game.
Several substitutes may be given an
opportunity by Flanigan to get into the
game. Scofield Gillette, and Sheldon, if
his leg is strong enough, may get into
the game in the backfield. Bacon, Van
Cliffe and several other players will be
ready to fill vacancies in the scrum.
"Monk" Antrim will be on band to
conduct the yells. "Johnny" Sturgeon,
"Doc" Martin, "Sell" Brill, and "Art"
Devlin, candidates for the job of as
sistant yell leaders, will work out under
the direction of Antrim.
The admission will be 50 cents plus
war tax.
