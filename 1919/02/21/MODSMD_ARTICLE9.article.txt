# VARSITY VIVE TO PLAY NEVADA
## 
### 
STANFORD basketball quintets will
play two more games tomorrow
night when the Varsity five mixes with
the University of Nevada team, and
the freshmen play their second game
with California. Both contests will be
played away from home.
The Varsity left this afternoon for
Nevada and will get to Reno in time
to have a workout on the Nevada floor
before the game tomorrow. Seven
men besides Coach Evans are making
the trip. Hood, Esgen, Moulten as for
wards, Righter as center, and Wil
liamson, Lilly and Caughey as guards
will be on hand for a part in the con

test against the Reno five.
Varsity's Fifth Game
This is the fifth league game for
the Varsity, and it will be necessary
to win it in order to maintain the
Cardinal's present standing in the
league. Stanford, California and
Santa Clara are now tied for first hon
ors. Each team has won four games
and lost one. If Santa Clara wins the
remainder of her games, the Mission
ites will be assured second place in
the league, while the winner of the
Stanford-California series will take
first place and the loser will shift
down to third.
The game tomorrow with Nevada
and the one next Thursday with St.
Ignatius will end Stanford's part in
the series except for the remaining
games with California. Neither of the
first two teams should give the Var
sity and trouble, while the Bears' style
of play seems to be somewhat erratic
and inconsistent by the way they
showed up this week in their game
with Santa Clara.
Freshman Outlook Doubtful
The freshman team will go to Cali
fornia under the coaching of R. F.
Pelouze, who will not make the trip
to Reno as he is not anxious to take
any more chances with his injured
foot before the next Varsity game
with the Blue and Gold.
The yearlings have been working
hard this week, and promise to put up
a game fight against the Bruins, al
though their prospects for winning
are somewhat doubtful after their
showing last Saturday night. Should
California win, this game will end the
freshman series.
