# STANFORD FIFTEEN WINS FROM CALIFORNIA TEAM
## Cardinal Is Victorious 21 to 8 
### 
IN the last big rugby game with the
University of California, the Stan
ford ruggers defeated the Blue and Gold
by the score of 21 to 8 Saturday after
noon. The game was not as fast a?
some of the rugby battles that the two
universities have had in the past, but
nevertheless both packs played good
football.
As was expected, the Cardinal for
wards outweighed their opponents and
displayed superior ability in the line
outs and in the rucks. The California
scrum offset this advantage somewhat
by the ability of their forwards to se
cure the pigskin in scrum formations.
The backfield of the Bears was unable
to advance the ball, however, and most
of the California gains were made by
forward rushes and touch kicks.
Wren Gees Over First
In the first few minutes of play, the
Stanford team marched down the field
to the California 25-yard line, aided by
kicks to touch by Doe and Kinney. A
forward rush nearly took the ball over
the line. Tildon of the Blue and Gold
team drop-kicked from the 25-yard line,
and a moment later Wrenn went over
the line for a try as a result of a pass
ing rush, Doe to Long to Wrenn. Pat
rick converted.
Flood and Patrick were especially
strong in the rucks and line-outs at this
point in the game. Brewer, California
lock, and Captain Raggio, break-away,

were strong men among the California
forwards.
Raggio Scores for Visitors
Shortly after Stanford had scored, the
California men succeeded in advancing
down teh field to the Stanford 25-yard
line, where Captain Raggio of the visit
ors took the ball over for a try. Tildon
converted, tying the score.
The California team made several
gains on account of numerous free kicks
given against the Stanford team. Brew
er. fullback for the Blue and Gold team,
made his free kicks count. These gains
were nullified a moment later by a pass
ing rush of the Stanford backs, Flood
to Patrick to Wrcnn, which took the
play to the California 5 yard line. Here.
Falk took the ball over for a try from
a scrum formation in the far corner of
the field. Patrick failed to convert.
In the second half, Sheldon went in
at center threePquarter in place of Par
ker. After a few minutes of see-saw
play, the California forwards took the
ball down to the Stanford line and Til
don. wing forward, was shoved over for
a try. Tildon failed to convert.
California Front Rank Strong
The front rank of the opposing scrum
was successful in most scrum formations
in getting possession of the ball, but
good offensive play on the part of the
Stanford scrum succeeded in breaking
