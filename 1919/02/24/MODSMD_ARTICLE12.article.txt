# STUDENT COUNCIL TO PROHIBIT FUTURE "PEERADES"
## TREE POSTERS BANNED Assistant Student Manager Tryouts Will Be Held Soon by W.I. Ames 
### 
U-THAT in the future, the Washing-
I ton's Birthday Parade of Fra
ternity freshmen be prohibited," was the
P.ction taken by the Student Council at
a Special Meeting held last night. In
addition the Council voted that posters
cannot be luing on campus trees or tele
phone posts, and that try-outs for As
sistant Student Manager be opened at
once to last through the present quarter.
The Council after voting that the
freshmen parade be prohibited in the
future, discussed the possibility of dis
ciplining freshmen whose display, last
;S- turday, was outside the pale. It was
decided by the body that 110 action would
be taken, although the Student Council
was strongly opposed to the display in
i the parade. The difficulty of fixing re
sponsibility, and the large number of
men involved, were given as the reasons
by the Council why none of the partici
pants in this year's parade would be dis
ciplined.
No More Posters
In order to prevent an unnecessary
| cluttering of the campus with posters
; and signs, the Council voted that trees
; and telephone posts on the campus
! would in the future be restricted terri
tory for such advertising.
An Assistant Student Manager is to
be chosen by the Council either the last
part of this quarter or early next. In
order to secure a number of men to se
lect from, the Council voted that names
of try-outees for this position be handed
in to Student Manager VV. I. Ames, '18,
at once. The try-outs will continue for
; the present quarter.
