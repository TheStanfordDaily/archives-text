# U.C. Babes Take Basketball Series
## Stanford Freshman Quintet Loses Second Game to Bearsâ€”45 to 26 
### 
The Stanford freshman quintet again
met defeat from the California babes,
by a score of 45 to 26. in a game Satur
day night at the Harmon gymnasium,
j This being the second victory of the
j Hi ars over tin- Cardinal, it gives them
the freshman basketball series.
Although Stanford was steadily losing
| during the game, the freshmen put up a
; strong fight until the final whistle blew,
i They were somewhat handicapped by the
size of the California floor, which is
i about two-thirds the size of the Encina
! court. Not only was the floor small, but
it was slippery, having been polished for
ja dance Friday evening.
A marked improvement was shown in
the game, over the first game of the
series. Stanford was ahead of the Blue
and Gold five, until Eggleston went into
the game. Kggleston is the star forward
!of the U. C. team, and going into the
game fresh in the middle of the first
helf, helped to roll up a lead of ten
(points for California. After that Stan
ford started going again and played a
j steady game to the finish.
There seemed to be no individual stars
; for the 1922 team, but according to
| "Hob" Pelouze, who went along in
Icharge of the team, all of the Stanford
plavers played a fine game.
Those playing for the Stanford
freshman team were: Captain Austin.
| Davies, Reeder. Neer, Moisten, T arcn,
i Mangin and Gerson.
