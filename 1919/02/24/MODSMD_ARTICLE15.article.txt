# CONDEMNED AND CLOSED
## 
### 
WITH Washington's Birthday past but hardly forgotten, the Stanford student
body found itself confronted with the unpleasant experience of a very
rattly family skeleton in its closet. The parade furnished for the campus amuse
ment, as per ancient tradition and usual custom, had left a skeleton that, unless
disintegrated, would not have exactly added anything to Stanford University's
family name.
It is to be regretted that underclassmen of the University, acting under the
guidance of supposedly wiser upperclassmen, should present a spectacle of the
sort brought forth last Saturday morning. Campus opinion is against such affront
to a person's decent sensibilities. There is an undoubted sentiment that the limit
was overstepped. There can be little excuse for what was done, and none is
offered. The remedy is what is sought.
And, in finding the remedy, we, can feel one element of satisfaction from
an affair that presents little enough satisfaction. The action of the student
Council, as representative of the student body, is expressive of student sentiment
in the incident in question. Not waiting for any other body's action, the Council
met last evening and condemned the Washington's Birthday parade as presented
this year; it went further than this, it condemned the Washington's Birthday
parade idea in its entirety; henceforth, if their action stands, the Father of his
Country will not turn in his grave because of any action by Stanford freshmen.
The parade has gone the way of Plug Ugly,—condemned by student sentiment.
When taking this action, the Council was presented with the difficulty of
either censoring all future parades of this sort or of abandoning them. The
idea of censorship was to place responsibility. Feeling, however, that something
fundamentally evil in principle, of no actual benefit other than a doubtful,
momentary enjoyment, could not be permanently remedied by the uncertainty of
an arbitrary censor, the Council decided to eliminate the evil at its root.
* ********
THERE is an element of satisfaction in this action by the council. It shows
that there is a student response to affairs concerning the students. No
tardy delay for faculty action was waited for. It is to be hoped that there will
be no action taken by the faculty committees other than a support of the attitude
of the Council. The matter has been met by the students in a manner that we
hope is satisfcatory to both students and faculty.
To attempt to sift the responsibility to its base will only end in unfortunate
disagreements and the usual list of student "martyrs." The responsibility is
divided; there is no one group responsible; the custom alone is to blame, Satur
day's demonstration unforunately having been merely the ultimate expression
of a useless and wrongly encouraged custom.
A remedy alone has not been found, but a permanent cure in the action of
the studenty body. To attempt to punish individuals now or to find an ever
evasive responsible party or parties would only result in unfortunate reopening
of an event that we hope is closed.
The Washington's Birthday parade is passed, it has been condemned ; it will
not reappear in the future. Students and faculty, let us call the incident closed.

parade idea in its entirety; henceforth, if their action stands, the Father of his
Country will not turn in his grave because of any action by Stanford freshmen.
The parade has gone the way of Plug Ugly,—condemned by student sentiment.
When taking this action, the Council was presented with the difficulty of
either censoring all future parades of this sort or of abandoning them. The
idea of censorship was to place responsibility. Feeling, however, that something
fundamentally evil in principle, of no actual benefit other than a doubtful,
momentary enjoyment, could not be permanently remedied by the uncertainty of
an arbitrary censor, the Council decided to eliminate the evil at its root.

THERE is an element of satisfaction in this action by the council. It shows
that there is a student response to affairs concerning the students. No
tardy delay for faculty action was waited for. It is to be hoped that there will
be no action taken by the faculty committees other than a support of the attitude
of the Council. The matter has been met by the students in a manner that we
hope is satisfcatory to both students and faculty.
To attempt to sift the responsibility to its base will only end in unfortunate
disagreements and the usual list of student "martyrs." The responsibility is
divided; there is no one group responsible; the custom alone is to blame, Satur
day's demonstration unforunately having been merely the ultimate expression
of a useless and wrongly encouraged custom.
A remedy alone has not been found, but a permanent cure in the action of
the studenty body. To attempt to punish individuals now or to find an ever
evasive responsible party or parties would only result in unfortunate reopening
of an event that we hope is closed.
The Washington's Birthday parade is passed, it has been condemned ; it will
not reappear in the future. Students and faculty, let us call the incident closed.
WITH Washington's Birthday past but hardly forgotten, the Stanford student
body found itself confronted with the unpleasant experience of a very
rattly family skeleton in its closet. The parade furnished for the campus amuse
ment, as per ancient tradition and usual custom, had left a skeleton that, unless
disintegrated, would not have exactly added anything to Stanford University's
family name.
It is to be regretted that underclassmen of the University, acting under the
guidance of supposedly wiser upperclassmen, should present a spectacle of the
sort brought forth last Saturday morning. Campus opinion is against such affront
to a person's decent sensibilities. There is an undoubted sentiment that the limit
was overstepped. There can be little excuse for what was done, and none is
offered. The remedy is what is sought.
And, in finding the remedy, we, can feel one element of satisfaction from
an affair that presents little enough satisfaction. The action of the student
Council, as representative of the student body, is expressive of student sentiment
in the incident in question. Not waiting for any other body's action, the Council
met last evening and condemned the Washington's Birthday parade as presented
this year; it went further than this, it condemned the Washington's Birthday
parade idea in its entirety; henceforth, if their action stands, the Father of his
Country will not turn in his grave because of any action by Stanford freshmen.
