# LEAGUE OF NATIONS CONFORMS WITH CONSTITUTION
## SOVEREIGNTY TO REMAIN Treaty-Making Power Permits Entering League, Says Law Professor 
### A.M. CATHCART Professor of Constitutional Law 
Could the United States join the
proposed League of Nations without
violating its own Constitution? Sena
tors Borah, Reid and Poindexter vocif
erously assert that it could not. This
was to he expected from these hitter op
ponents of the League. But what is their
argument ?
Senators Declare Sovereignty
Abridged
They say that a treaty accepting the
so-called Constitution of the League
would he unconstitutional because it
would involve a surrender of sovereignty
to the League. It is urged that the dec
laration of war is the exercise of a sov
ereign power, that this is by our
Constitution vested in Congress, and
that the proposed League would limit
this power by requiring the observation
of a certain procedure, necessarily in
volving delay, before war is declared.
One obvious trouble with this argu
ment is that it proves too much. It
would invalidate a score of treaties al
! ready ratified by the Senate. Has the
I world so soon forgotten the "breathing
i spell" treaties of Secretary Bryan that
| were ratified about the time of the out
break of the Great War?
Agreement Overlooks Treaty-
Making Power
j It is indeed not too much to say that
I the same reasoning would invalidate
every treaty to which the United States
has ever become a party. Every treaty
; involves in its very nature an agreement
upon the part of the government to do
lor refrain from doing what, but for such
agreement, it might freely do or refrain
i from doing as an exercise of its sover
| eign will.
Wide Treaty Powers Wouid
Permit Joining League
As an attribute of sovereignty the
United States has as complete a treaty
' making power as any nation. The power
ito make treaties is vested in the Presi-
dent and Senate without any express
limitation. This does not, of course, ex
clude the possibility of an implied lim
itation, although no such limitation has
ever been established by judicial de
cision. The Supreme Court has said re
peatedly that the treaty-making power
extends to every proper subject for in
ternational negotiation. If tbe mainten
ance of the peace of the world is not a
'proper subject for international negotia-
I tion, what is ?
Congress May Still Declare War
The Senators need not worry. If we
joined the League of Nations Congress
would still retain the power to declare
war. If that body decided to regard the
Peace Treaty as a "scrap of paper" and
to declare war contrary to its principles,
we should constitutionally be at war. A
sovereign power may always break a
treaty if it is willing to accept the con
sequences. The consequences may be
war or the execration of the world.
Super-Sovereignty Dependent on
Member Nations
Tbe much-dreaded super-sovereign
will itself have no vestige of sovereign
ty. Tt will be as dependent upon the
member nations as was the Continental
Congress upon the member states under
the Articles of Confederation. It cannot
levy taxes; it cannot declare war; it can
not raise or equip an army or a navy.
All it can do is to ask the member na
tions to live up to their agreements. It
will succeed if they do; it will fail if
they do not.
