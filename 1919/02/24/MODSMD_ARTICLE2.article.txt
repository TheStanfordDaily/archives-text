## 
### 
Stanford's varsity quintet added
another victory to its list Satur
day night by defeating the University
of Nevada by a 40-24 score. The Ne
vada team put up a hard fight, but
their playing was too loose to match
up with the team work of the Cardinal
five.
The varsity's teamwork and speed
showed up in this game better than in
any previous contest of the season.
The score would have been at least
fifteen points more in favor of the
Stanford team had not the Reno um
pire made a practice of calling fouls
on the Cardinals just us a successful
shot was leaving a player's hand for

the basket.
Hood and Moulton played at for
ward and accounted for six goals be
tween them. Hood's style of play was
considerably improved over that he
showed in the California game. Moul
ton came through in shooting free
goals and made six out of nine trys.
Righter made his usual fine showing
and accounted a good part of the Stan
j ford score. Lilly, Williamson, and
j Caugliey at gaurd each made several
| baskets.
The varsity's next game will take
! place Wednesday evening against St.
i Ignatius. Coach Evans will take the
! regular varsity squad to San Fran-
I cisco.
