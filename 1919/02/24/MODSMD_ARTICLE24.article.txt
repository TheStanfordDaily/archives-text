Langford family, whose home was
burned recently. At present there is
about $200 in the fund and it is hoped

six little children.
The first part of the program will
consist in music and stunts, and the
latter part in nickel dances. Stanford

and elaborate plans are being made
to insure its success. People of the
vicinity have been contributing gen

become one of community interest.
