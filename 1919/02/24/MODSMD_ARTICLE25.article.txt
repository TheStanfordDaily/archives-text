### 
Tickets for the new series of con
certs under the management of Frank
W. Ilealy of San Francisco are now
on sale at the Bookstore and at Rob
inson and Crandall's in Palo Alto.
This series is to he composed of
three concerts, in which Max Ilosen,
Madame Frances Alda and Miss Ethel
Reginska will appear.
The Rosen concert will take place
on Thursday night in the Assembly
Hall. The New York Evening Sun
has said of him: "The virtues of
playing which could command so
quick and huge an appeal must be ob
vious. Mr. Rosen, outside of his high
degree of talent is endowed with a
flow of temperament which doubtless
belongs to him by right of youth, and
which colors the mere essentials of
technique with a more than occasional
loveliness."
