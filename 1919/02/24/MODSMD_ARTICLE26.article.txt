# Baseball Game With Bank is Not Played
## 
### 
Owing to the falure of the Bank of
Italy team to appear, the varsity base
ball team held a stiff practice Satur
day morning instead of the game
which was scheduled.
The first game of the season will
be played on Wednesday with the
Santa Clara varsity. A four-game se
ries has been scheduled between the
two teams by Student Manager W. l.
Ames.
