# Track Prospects Hold Workout
## 
### 
Stanford's track prospects had their
first competitive tryouts on the oval Sat
urday morning. The entire squad was
not present for the informal meet, but
some good material showed up.
All distances were shortened on ac
count of the earliness of the season, and
no competition was held in the hurdles
and some field events. The time in all
events was slow on account of the soft
condition of the track.
A large number of new men were out
to show their wares, and from the pros

pects a good many of these men will
develop into real varsity material.
Maynard and Wells were the fastest
men in the sprints, while Wilkie, West
wick, Keetch, and Hartman showed up
well in the distances.
These informal Saturday meets will
he a regular thing for the next few
weeks, and Captain Teitsworth is plan
ning to get every track prospect out for
competition in them. The experiences
gained in these meets will have a good
deal to the candidates showing outside
competition.
