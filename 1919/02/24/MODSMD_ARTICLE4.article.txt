## 
### 
Dr. Harry 15. Reynolds, '96, will give
an informal lcctnr;- in the Little Theater
tomorrow night at 7:30. The subject
that Dr. Reynolds has chosen is "F.x
periences With the First Army in tin
Argonne Offensive"
Almost immediately after enlisting
Dr. Reynolds was sent across and spent
about six months on the actual tiring
front. In his position as surgeon he was
especially qualified to judge conditions

on the battle line. The informal narra
tive he will tell tomorrow night will em
body his experiences on the front, and
will without doubt interest a large por
tion of the student body.
The Tuesday evening lectures havt
been unusually interesting this quarter
and have largely taken the place of the
former Assemblies. It is promised thai
the lecture tomorrow night will do it:
share to maintain this interest in the
Tuesday evening lectures.
