# CAMPUS AUDIENCE SAYS RAM'S HEAD SHOW IS SUCCESS
## SEIB SCORES A BIG HIT Highest Praise Is Given Author, Cast, and Chorus of the Show 
### R.W. KENNY, '21 
6 FF! Bang!! Bullsheveek!!!"
D me first campus dramatic pro
(luction since the war, set a standard
of excellence last Friday niglit that
will make future campus theatricals
work hard to equal. Ram's Head so
ciety must he congratulated on its
selection of the play, the finished
work of its cast and chorus, and the
many tuneful musical numbers.
Credit is due primarily to. Milton
IJagen, the author of the play, and
part of the musical score. He is a
past master in producing shows of a
"revolutionary" nature. In 1914 he
wrote another Ram's Head show,
"Routing Razmataz," which concerned
itself with turbulent Mexico. Thus,
when he selected the subject of Bol
shevik Russia, his was a practiced
hand in things anarchical, and he was
fully aware of all the possibilities in
such a subject.
Its setting in such a land of interest
as Bolshevik Russia would alone have
carried the show to some measure of
success. But besides the local color,
Hagen contributed an excellent com
edy filled with many sparkling lines.
A good deal of Vie humor was
choice, if not subtle. At times, though,
Hagen, through lack of inspiration,
was obliged to fill in the dialogue witli
some rather feeble puns. But Hagen's
debt to Jos Miller is small and there
seems to be no danger of a foreclosure
in his future work. There was enough
"sure fire" fun in the show to make
it a laughing success.
It cannot be but regretted from the
audience's standpoint that the faculty
Committee on Student Affairs prohib
! ited the presentation of the show in
I
j San Jose on the night previous to the
campus production. One trial of "Biff!
Bang!! Bullsheveek!!!" on the San
Jose dog would have given a final pol
ish to the piece. The fault of all cam
i pus dramatics is that they are by
! nature first-night performances,
j Easily, the hit of the evening was
Lester Seib, playing the part of the
persecuted Russian heroine. His voice
hud the tone qualities of a real emo
tional tragedienne. His action had
i the stately grace of a Nazimova. Peg
Whealton, who played the straight
i lead opposite Seib, was given the
colorless and conventional part of the
I American newspaper correspondent,
j He used his clear voice to good ad
| vantage in sentimental duets with
! Seib.
The novel part of a Russian negro
i was played by Robert McConaughy.
He has a carrying stage voice and his
1 song, "I Stop Rolling the Bones," was
' the best novelty song in the show. At
times the slowness of his actions
seemed a trifle prolonged and exag
gerated.
The tall "Linen," played by Robert
; Armstrong, and Jack Schnier's diminu
tive "Trotsky" were two good parts
well played. If the show was meant to
be historically correct, however, we
would learn that "Trotsky" is guilty
of some very poor footwork for a Rus
sian dictator. Hugh Boyd, the news
paperman in female disguise, had a
| part rich with possibilities, but failed
1 to make a very strong impression.
Artliur Harzfeld gave a very ori
| g'nal conception of a town crier. Sam
; Glikbarg and Lester Levy played their
minor female roles fairly well. Seib
had raised the level of Ram's Head
female impersonation so high, how
ever, that their efforts seemed crude
in comparison. Milward Hunkin
played his brief part of the inn-keeper
Iso well that we would like to have
j seen more of him.
; The chorus did its work well, al
though that of the female chorus was
j somewhat marred by a tendency to
; wards individuality among some of its
\ members. The music was catchy and
original.
There was no doubt of "Biff! Bang!!
| Bullsheveek's!!!" success. After the
final curtain had dropped, with the
last kick of the Bolshevik chorus.
| there was not one person in the au
! dience that left the Assembly Hall
j without the regret that there was to
bo no more.
