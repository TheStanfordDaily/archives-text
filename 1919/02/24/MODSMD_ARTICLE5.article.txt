6 FF! Bang!! Bullsheveek!!!"
D me first campus dramatic pro
(luction since the war, set a standard
of excellence last Friday niglit that
will make future campus theatricals
work hard to equal. Ram's Head so
ciety must he congratulated on its
selection of the play, the finished
work of its cast and chorus, and the
many tuneful musical numbers.
Credit is due primarily to. Milton
IJagen, the author of the play, and
part of the musical score. He is a
past master in producing shows of a
"revolutionary" nature. In 1914 he
wrote another Ram's Head show,
"Routing Razmataz," which concerned
itself with turbulent Mexico. Thus,
when he selected the subject of Bol
shevik Russia, his was a practiced
hand in things anarchical, and he was
fully aware of all the possibilities in
such a subject.
Its setting in such a land of interest
as Bolshevik Russia would alone have
carried the show to some measure of
success. But besides the local color,
Hagen contributed an excellent com
edy filled with many sparkling lines.
A good deal of Vie humor was
choice, if not subtle. At times, though,
Hagen, through lack of inspiration,
was obliged to fill in the dialogue witli
some rather feeble puns. But Hagen's
debt to Jos Miller is small and there
seems to be no danger of a foreclosure
