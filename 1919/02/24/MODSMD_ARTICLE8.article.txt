# The
						Blood Red Flag Proves Too Much For the Bruins
## 
### 
The brilliant cardinal has proved
too much for those whose eyes can
focus only for the Blue and Gold.
Even so much as a casual display of
our glowing colors on the highways
and byways of Berkeley has such dire
effects that their very appearance
gives unto the undertaker new
charges. A flash of red â€”the blinded
victims pale and fall.
For humanity's sake the City Coun
cil has passed the red flag act. By
this act the display of the red flag or
other insignia of the blood red aggre
gation brings upon the head of the
transgressor the penalty of $50 to
$500 line, or thirty days in jail, or
both.
But the San Francisco Examiner in
forms us tha tthis humane statute was
not directly aimed at the wearers of
the Cardinal from our institution, but
designed to curb the activities of the
I. W. W.'s. The rooters for the Blue
and Gold, however, comprehending
the havoc wrought upon their warriors
by the sight of the blood red banner,
clamor madly that the shoe fits and
Stanford must wear it or suffer con
sequences behind the bars of the
municipal bastile.
