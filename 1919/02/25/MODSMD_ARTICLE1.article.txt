# WOMEN'S MASS MEETING PLANNED FOR NEXT THURSDAY
## TO BE IN LITTLE THEATER Discussion of the Future of Women's War Board to Take Place 
### 
Miss Ruth Chandler, '19, lias called a
women's mass meeting to be held next
Thursday afternoon at 4:15 in the Lit
tle Theater. The future work and or
ganization of the Women's War Board
will be the topic for discussion, and a
number of new features will be outlined
and explained in regard to the future
philanthropic work to be done by women
on the campus.
Arrangements have been made with
the Lane Clinic Auxiliary 011 the cam
pus and with the authorities in the city
that a new organization may be able to
take over more extensive work in this
connection, and it is the belief of those
who have worked 011 the new plan that
a distinctly unique institution can be
built up on the campus which will be
long entirely to Stanford.
Considerable discussion is expected on
the advisability of allowing all post war
work except that of the Lane Clinic to
return to the Y. W. C. A., under whose
auspices the Women's War Board was
originally organized. This question will
be presented from both the organized
women's point of view and that of the
Y. W. C. A. Action will probably be
taken at the mass meeting to decide the
question either one way or the other.
Those who have the meeting in
charge consider that this meeting is one
of the most important which has come
to the organized women for some time,
as the whole future policy under which
philanthropic work is to be carried on
largely depends upon the decision which
the women make at the present time.
Therefore all living groups are urged to
see that all women attend so far as is
possible, in order that the work in hand
may be accomplished with the greatest
possible thoroughness.
