# A 						MOMENT OF THOUGHT

### 
THE plea to consider the unfortunate Washington's Birthday parade as a
condemned, never-to-be-repeated, and closed issue regrettably has not
been accepted in the light in which it was sent. In view of recent develop
ments, we find that the sincere appeal to consider the action of the Student
Council in banning Washington's Birthday parades in the future as a sufficient
remedial measure has not been so considered by the faculty committees. A
thorough investigation of culpability in the incident of the past week-end is
now proceeding, under the assumption that soon the guilty will feel the
weight of the faculty axe. In the frame of these developments, the Daily
Palo Alto seeks once again to make known its stand upon the matter, in the
hopes that the faculty committee may see in this repeated assertion a view
point supported by the students (if we may take the action of the council as
indicative of that) expressed through the student daily publication in the
earnest hope that it may stay the faculty axe just long enough to determine
whether or not there is justice in its execution.
To repeat, the Daily Palo Alto deplores, upon the part of the student body,
the disgraceful action of the fraternity freshmen in the parade of Saturday
last. An outrage to decency has been performed in the excitement of un
thinking "mob smartness." The campus condemns such action, and condemns
itself the perpetrators.
But, upon the other hand, the Daily Palo Alto appeals to the members
of th 6 Faculty Student Affairs Committee to refrain from expulsion of the par
ticipants and others upon the grounds: (1) that action has already been taken
by the Student Council, such action being in the nature of a permanent rem
edy, (2) that responsibility cannot definitely and justly be fixed, despite con
fessions and denials, and (3) that there are not sufficient benefits to be de
rived from such expulsion to warrant it in the face of the most palpable harm.
We have already discussed our stand upon the question that the Student
Council's action was sufficient in that it permanently remedied the reoccur
rence of such a deplorable incident. After all, the object of punishment is
remedy; if the remedy has been found, why punish further?
To say that responsibility cannot be justly and definitely fixed is likewise
mere repetition. The questions presented last evening to the fratenlity fresh
men have been answered. Where there is guilt and manly admittance of that
guilt, there may still be expulsion, else why the questions? Where there is
deceitful denial (and there always are black sheep) there is no other course
but punishment. What of the upper-classmen, for freshmen brains alone
could not have devised the entire parade? How are they to be found in jus
tice? To punish a few would be merely punishment for force of example and
unjust; to punish many would be to make a collection of individuals responsi
ble for the foolishness of ''mob smartness."
Clearly, then, as we evolve the situation, the manifold harm from expul
sion of a few of the guilty, and maybe some of the doubtfully guilty far out
weighs the ultimate possible good. After all, a university is not buildings
alone; it is composed of students, individuals, and exists for the benefit of
these individuals. The last remedy after all should be expulsion, and then
even it should not be undertaken if possibly avoided. Men are sent to uni
versities to develop, not to be sent home unsuccessful because of the thought
less degeneration of a few moments. To calmly ruin futures for even as
serious an affair as that of the parade is at best cold blooded business. When
another remedy has been suggested and is applicable, it then has no excuse.
To say that we cannot tolerate what occurred, in the face of Stanford's
name? True, we cannot tolerate it, and we have not; for prevention of re
occurrence certainly is not tolerance. What is this Stanford name but the
name of its students? To throw half a hundred of them from the University
gates brings notoriety that surely does not enhance this name. And is this
name impaired, if the students themselves defend it by such action as that
that they have already taken?
