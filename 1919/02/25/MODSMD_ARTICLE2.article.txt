The freshmen exponents of the na
tional pastime will tomorrow afternoon
wage battle on the Palo Alto High
School pill-chasers. The two teams will
undoubtedly put over a good game; the
Paly High boys have been practicing
for some weeks past and are developing
speed, the local frosh horsehide heavers
have got the pep and speed that wiU
usually put any team over the top, con
sequently a good game is looked for.
The local men who will play in the
game will not be a picked nine, but un
doubtedly the entire squad will be put
through the traces. This will give each
<>112 the men out a good chance to make
a permanent place for himself on the
frosh lineup.
Coach Cass is coaching the '22 men
every afternoon ami expects to bring
out a speedy nine. Cass is working bis
men up especially in the daily batting
practice. Good results have already
shown up.
The game tomorrow will be the first
of a series of three games with Paly
High. One week later the second game
will be staged at the high school dia
mond.
