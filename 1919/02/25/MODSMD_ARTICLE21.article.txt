To tin- Editor of the Daily Palo Alto:
Dear Sir: No one is defending the
parade. It was admittedly a very serious
breach of moral convention, and should
be dealt with as such. However, the
real issue must be found before ;
remedy is applied, otherwise no satis
factory adjustment may be anticipated.
The actual participants were no more
guilty than the audience who approv
ingly laughed at them, or the inventors
of the stunts, or those who failed to nip
the affair in the bud.
The fraternities are not guilty, for
they took no formal action prior to the
event, and the most that can be said
against them is that certain of their men
were involved, and necessarily their
men only, because it was traditionally a
fraternity parade.
To expel any particular individuals,
i would be, in effect, to say that those
i men are morally unlit to remain on
i the Stanford campus, and that is not
I true, unless you accept different de
, grees of culpability and imm'orality as
determining their fitness to remain.
Most of us realize that those involved
in the parade are no different than
the general run of college men.
Xo, the issue lies deeper. Tt is in
the conditions that make such demon
strations possible on the campus. It
may be in the coeducational system and
. it may lie in partial faculty and partial
! student control, but one thing at least
| is apparent and a guide in searching
for the solution. The women are the
' ones offended, and the offense is of a
' social nature. Tf they choose to do so,
i they may openly resent the insult in ;>
way that would prevent its recurrence,
j Tn this the Dean of Women might offer
| some good advice. Tf the women fail
jto take action then the university
officials should go to work on th£ con
ditions that hold them from asserting
their feminine rights to freedom from
such affronts.
Kxcept in th<■ case of degenerates and
habitual offenders, expulsion is an an
tique, though easy to use. remedy. Let
11s do some thinking instead of deal
ing with an intricate condition in the
intolerant, faculty-axe fashion.
