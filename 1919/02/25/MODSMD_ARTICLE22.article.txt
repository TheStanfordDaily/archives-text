# SOCCER TEAM WILL BATTLE CALIFORNIA ON NEXT SATURDAY
## 
### 
The Stanford and the U. of C. soccer
teams will meet on the Farm field next
Saturday morning in open combat.
Though both teams have not been out
for training more than several weeks,
it is expected that a lively scrap will
take place.
Prospects for the Cardinals are fair.
The home men have only been out fur
practice a few times in the last two
weeks, but with the fight and "go" that
they have demonstrated in those few
j practice games, show that Saturday's
j game will be no slow affair. A consid
erable number of the men have come
out very consistently and are showing
surprising improvement in each new
practice game.
"Doc" Martin and Green, playing at
| forward, have been demonstrating their
j lighting spirit to a marked degree. Dur
j rey, Goddard, and Pillsbury are espec
ially strong point makers. Meyers,
i playing fullback, will no doubt come
r through with some quick playing. As
far as the men are concerned, the team
is in splendid shape for the coming bat-
I tie. Team work is what is needed now.
j The men are fighting hard, but as indi
, viduals and not collectively. With sev
j eral workouts during the week, and a
1 possible chance of having a game with
the S. F. Olympic Club before the Cali
! fornia meet, the men by the week-eqd
| should be pulling together.
The game will be called at the soccer
i field at 10:30. There will be no admis
! sion.
