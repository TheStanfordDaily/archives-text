# NEW SYSTEM IS USED BY ATHLETIC BOARD
## Track Men to Buy Their Own Equipmentâ€”Refund for First Team Men 
### 
A new arrangement for furnishing
track equipment has been worked out
by the Board of Athletic Control to be
putin effect for the spring season.
This arrangement provides for rebat
ing half the cost of equipment to men
who make the freshman or varsity track
squads. In the days before the war
thousands of dollars were spent in fur
nishing what was known as "dead-head"
equipment to all men who were track
candidates. Under the present circum
stances, cost of equipment for those who
make the squads will be partially paid
for.
Men wishing to purchase track shoes
can consult with Captain Teitsworth or
Coach Evans and order them through
the gym store. If these men are put on
a squad they will be refunded half the
cost of the shoes. Men who fail to
make squads on account of sickness or
injury will receive the same considera
tion.
Trainers have now been secured and
will be at the gym regularly during the
afternoon. All track candidates will be
given the advantage of rub-downs, but
must report to Captain Teitsworth first
The object of this ruling is to prevent
men who are merely signed for gym
classes getting the benefit of the rub
ber's time.
