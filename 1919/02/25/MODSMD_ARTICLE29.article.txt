The Flat Car Escapade
The flat-car escapade is a well
known one. in early Stanford history.
So famous has it become that at a
recent alumni gathering the number
claiming participants in the affair
were double the original number.
The event occurred on a mild day in
November in the year 1892, when a
large number of students happened to
pass by a flat car standing on a spur
track of the Southern Pacific Com
pany. The opportunity was a golden
one and not to be overlooked. No
single student grasped the idea first,
but the whole company realized it at
the same moment.
As many as could find room crowded
on the car. The rest clung to the
sides and end. The brakes were loos
ened and to the tune of the new col
lege cry:
Wah-lioo. Wah-hoo,
L. S. J. U. —Stanford,
the car gained motion and started

down the track. Soon the speed be
came too rapid for pleasure—the best
opportunity in reach was the hand
brake. The wheel was hastily turned
and the car brought to a stop near
the Palo Alto station. Leaving it, the
party tramped back to Encina well
satisfied with their labor.
The next morning an empty flat car
was reported missing. The division
superintendent was notified and men
sent to trace it. When the lost car
was finally discovered an engine from
San Jose had to be summoned to haul
the car back to its original place.
Senator Stanford was far from
pleased when he heard of the affair.
He ordered that all students who had
taken part were to be expelled. The
order- would have affected nearly 200
students, over half of the University
attendance. Fortunately, Mrs. Stan
ford interceded for the sportive "wah
hooers" and induced the Senator to
withdraw his severe edict.
