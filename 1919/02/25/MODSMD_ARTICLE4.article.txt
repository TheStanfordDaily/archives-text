# LIFE STORY OF MAX ROSEN SHOWS MANY UNUSUAL CONTRASTS
## 
### 
The career of Max Rosen, who is al
ready conceded to be one of the world's
greatest violinists and who will be heard
at Stanford Thursday night on his first
tour west of Chicago, reads more like
the pages from some fairy tale than a
story of real life.
Max Rosen was the son of a poor
Jewish East Side barber in New York.
He was first heard of in the little bar
ber shop, where his father was attend
ing a chance customer, Solomon Dis
mond, journalist and music lover, who
happened in one day. This gentleman
heard some unusual violin playing in
what appeared to be the back room of
the shop. He was about to ask who the
player was when the music suddenly
ceased and a ragged little boy about ten
years old ran into the room and said
"Father, 1 am going out to play mar
bles. I have done enough practicing."
Before any remonstrance could lie
made he was out of the door, shouting
to his playmates with all the lusty
lunged abandon of the East Side street
urchin.
Now at eighteen years of age this
Jewish boy has successfully passed
through a period of intensive instruc
tion at the hands of Leopold Auer, the
world-famous teacher, and by his won
derful playing is stirring up memories
of the great violinists of the past gen
eration.
His playing has the elements of lofty
beauty that touches the heart, and Auer,
who has taught Elman, Zimbalits, Par
low and Heifetz, says of Rosen: "1
consider him a violinist of absolutely
the lirst class and one of the best tech
nicians in the world today. In fact, in
all of our lessons I do not remember
that Rosen ever played a false note."
