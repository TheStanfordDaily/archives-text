MAX ROSEN
The Phenomenal Violinist
Born in poverty, but loved by the
gods and dowered witli their rarest
gift, the ability to reach men's hearts
with his music.
Read what the San Francisco crit
ics in their Monday reviews said o/
Rosen's recital at the Columbia:
Walter Anthony in the Chroniclc:
"Max Rosen seems to have the gift
of at) individualistic expression,
bringing to our consciousness some
thing that 110 other violinist can say
in quite the same pure, chaste, and
winsome manner. To miss him is to
be deprived of a musical experience
that no other violinist can provide.
He will play again ;it the Columbia
Sunday."
Ray Crown in the Examiner;
"Therefore be it said, emphatically,
that a new poet of the violin was in
troduced to San Francisco yesterday
afternoon in the presence of Max
Rosen. Those who heard him in the
Columbia Theater were fortunate,
for it is not often that young winged
spirits like his are glimpsed while
still fresh and eager.''
Walter Borden in the bulletin: "In
him San Francisco found a true
poet, a poet of the violin. He has all
the youth and fire, and colorful im
agery of the born poet, the artist
super-natural. All the dreams and
beauty of the youth of I<X (somehow
or other one feels he cannot grow
older in lii.s heart) seem to flow
throilgh his marvelous fingers into
the chords of his instrument."
