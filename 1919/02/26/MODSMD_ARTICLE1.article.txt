# WOMEN CALL IMPORTANT MEETING IN ASSEMBLY HALL FOR TOMORROW
## 
### 
On account of the large number of
women who are expected to attend the
women's mass meeting tomorrow af
ternoon at 4:15, the meeting will not
be held in the Little Theater as an
nounced, but in the Assembly Hall.
Miss Margaret Shedd, '20, chairman of
the Women's War Board, and Miss
Ruth Chandler, '19, president of the
Organized Women, are both anxious
that the women of the University feel
the responsibility and the importance
of the coming meeting.
The philanthropic work on the cam
pus will probably form one of the most
important factors in the future activi
ties of the campus. The Stanford
Clinics have never received the sup
port that they should from the Univer
sity students, considering the fact that
the clinics are really a part of the Uni
versity, and every opportunity is given
Stanford students who are willing to
take an interest in the work done in
San Francisco. Steps have already
been taken toward the establishment

of a home where children can be taken
at least during the summer months for
a vacation. A careful investigation
has been made by members of the
War Board to determine just what
kind of work the women of the Uni
versity would be able to take up imme
diately, and a full report of these in
vestigations will be given at the mass
meeting.
The Stanford Clinics' work will form
the main branch of the reconstruction
work which will be done on the cam
pus, but the question which will be
open for debate is whether or not the
rest of the post war work, which will
come up from time to time, will be
done by the new board, or revert back
to the Y. W. C. A. Definite action will
have to be taken on this question im
mediately.
There will be no weekly meeting of
the Y. W. C. A. tomorrow on account
of the mass meeting, but nominations
for the coming election of Y. W. C. A.
officers will be read at the close of the
mass meeting.
