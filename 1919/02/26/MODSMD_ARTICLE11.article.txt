# ELABORATE PLANS ARE ANNOUNCED BY PROM COMMITTEE
## 
### 
A definite date for the junior annual
"terpsichore par excellence" may be
set tomorrow, according to a state
ment from the prom committee which
met yesterday. This decision was
because of the conflict with the dates
of the big track and crew meets, and
the committee is desirous of arrang
ing a date which will allow all of the
athletes to attend.
It was also decided to engage for
the event the uest outside music ob
tainable, probably an eight- or nine
piece orchestra from the city. The
decorations are to bo 011 a scale al
most double to that of any former
prom in the matter of time, energy
and money expended, Encina gym has
been selected as the place, and special
attention will be devoted to having
the floor in the best possib'o shape for
dancing.
The old custom of elaborate and
! original invitations for this function
!is to be revived, and the committee
now has some particularly original de
j signs in this line.
