# LACK OF SUPPORT
## 
### 
Visitors at Stanford for athletic games during the last year have remarked
on the lack of interest shown by Stanford students in the success of Cardinal
teams. These men point to the organized rooting by student bodies at other
institutions, even when teams were losing, and further to the large support given
athletics by townspeople where other universities are located, and argue that
Stanford does not show the same interest.
That lack of proper support is evident in some cases on the "Farm" there
is no doubt but that this lack should be so notcieable as to cause comment from
other universities is a serious charge to the wearers of the Cardinal. Even dur
ing the war, when the best the University had to offer was given to the support
of the country, Stanford turned out successful teams in the different
branches of athletics. But even if defeats were administered there should be no
slack in the support given to the men fighting, out on the fields.
Stanford has always been proud of her spirit. Old graduates coming back
for visits have told the present generation of teams that represented the Car
dinal, and, winners or losers, these teams always received the whole-hearted sup
port of the students.
Already this year, Stanford has had several important games played here,
and proper support has not been given. The war is over, old men are back,
Stanford is turning out successful teams. There should be no lack of interest.
A game in which a Stanford combination is playing is more than a spectacle. It
is a test of strength in which every man and woman at the University is inter
ested.â€”H. G. S.
