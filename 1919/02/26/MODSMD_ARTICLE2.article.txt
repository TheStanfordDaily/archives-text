"No one can ever go through an of
fensive like the Argonne one and come
out with the same idea of national life,
nor can he ever look at the American
doughboy in the same light," said Dr.
Harry 15. Reynolds last night in his ad
dress before an audience which was so
large it had to ad journ to the church, in
order to provide room for those who
wished to hear the speaker. "The tre
mendous fortitude and bravery of the
men of the American army was won
derful. When you see those men com
ing back with their uniforms, arms
and faces covered with mud, when
they have been without food for three
days, and when suffering the most
grievous wounds, yet not one man
complain, you have a new idea of the
American soldier," said the speaker.
Dr. Reynolds first told something of
the working of the administration of

the American army abroad, and then
followed this with an intimate story
of his own experiences. Dr. Reynolds
left America 011 the Olympia in July
with 7,000 other TT. S. troops. He was
with the 316 th Sanitary train from
Camp Lewis, and had the rank of lieu
tenant-colonel. These troops were
first landed at South:: mot mi En pln'H
going from there to France, where
they were trained for a little over a
month in the same training center
where President Wilson ate Christmas
dinner with the American troops. From
this place the unit was sent directly
to the front, going to the Argonne for
est region, about forty miles northwest
of Verdun. The speaker graphically
told how the troops were transported
almost entirely by the wonderful or
ganization of French motor trucks, by
means of which the French in seven
days placed 250,000 troops 011 the Ital
ian front.
A most interesting picture was
drawn of the field hospital which Dr.
Reynolds' unit established in the
woods which were under gunfire. The
place for the seventeen tents of the
hospital had to be cut out of the thick
undergrowth and brush of the forest,
and for nearly, a week there was no
way to evacuate the wounded. There
was but one road and, as Dr. Reynolds
explained, ammunition was more im
portant than men.
"The one thing that impressed
every American officer, as well as the
French and English, was the remark
able way the American enlisted men
came through literally 100 per cent."
said the speaker. "The American peo
ple do not yet realize what the United
States soldier meant to the French.
The French people were disheartened.
They had practically planned to evacu
ate Paris when the 2nd division went
in. They stopped the Germans, hut
lost 1 5.000 men out of the total 25,000
in one week," said Dr. Reynolds.
Perhaps the most vivid portion of
the lecture was the description of the
offensive opened by the Ist army with
which Dr. Reynolds was connected on
the Argonne front. "When the bom
bardment opened," said the lecturer,
"we had no idea of its immensity. Yet
it was the greatest concentration of
artillery the world has ever seen. The
French 7Fis were practically wheel to
wheel. The sky was one blaze of
light. It seemed almost impossible
for any one to survive this rain of shot.
One could hardly help feeling sorry for
anyone against whom this inferno of
leaden hail was directed, even though
he was a German.."
