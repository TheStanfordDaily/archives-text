# AUSTRALIAN LETTER EXONERATES JORDAN
## 
### 
(Clipping from the Melbourne Age.)
Following is a letter received by
Miss Helen Davis, which explains the
invalidity of the various remarks and
accusations attributed to Dr. Jordan,
in regard to his views on the German j
Empire that was. The letter was writ
ten from a clipping taken from the
"Melbourne Age." The letter follows:
To the Editor of the Age.
Sir: A recent cable from America
published in "The Age" (9th Decern j
ber) contained the report that Dr. D. J
S. Jordan, chancellor of the Stanford
University, California, had protested)
against an inclusion of his name in
Count Bernstorff's list of those favor
able to the German cause, stating that |
the only time lie had ever communica
ted with the ex-ambassador was when
he forwarded an Australian lady's pro
test against German atrocities. In
this matter I should ask you for the
opportunity to elucidate Dr. Jordan's
position, as I am the writer of the let
ter referred to. The substance of the
letter was a comparison of the causes
of disappearance of many high civil
izations, which have left not even a
trace of themselves, and the holocaust
of the white races that was going on
during the war in J<]urope, noting the
shattering of their biain power, their
supreme resistance, and the over
whelming increase in the colored
races, making the way open for bar
baric conquest and the closing of the
slightly open door of civilization 9 " By
whose hand was this done?" was asked,
and a picture was comprehended ofj
the Kaiser's descendants sharing the
common fate with the children of
those who had been wantonly sacri
ficed. The subject seemed to be in
a measure inspired by one ever pres
ent to us "white Australia," and the
necessity of our constitution in main
taining its importance, biologically,
ethnologically and strategically. The
letter weighed sufficiently with Dr.
Jordan for him to send it to Count
Bernstorff, who undertook to forward
it to Germany to reach the Kaiser,
and whether it told or not on the
minds of those that ruled in the war,
it was coincident with some first talk
of peace, where similar arguments
were discussed. In connection with
this letter, Dr. Jordan expressed ac
tive sympathy with the cause of the
Allies, even at a time when America
stood neutral. The fact also of his
instrumentality in helping on condi
tions favorable to the Allies may not
be depreciated even by political fac
tions. Yours, etc.,
HELEN DAVIS.
