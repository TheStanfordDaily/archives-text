Interesting Facts
It is not generally known that Sen
ator and Mrs. Stanford were planning,
before the death of Leland, to build a
magnificent villa of Italian style. The
plans were complete and the site of
the mausoleum chosen as the location
The arboretum was to be laid out in
extensive gardens and seventeen miles
of drives about the estate were
planned. According to Senator Stan
ford, the villa was to be the hub and
the avenues would radiate from it as
the spokes of a wheel. Some of the
avenues were laid out, which account
for the present wide open ways to be
seen in the arboretum.
With the death of young Leland in

Italy the plans were given up and the
Stanfords gave all their attention to
the founding of a fitting memorial. The
"Cottage," the residence of the family
on the estate, was enlarged. In the
great earthquake of 1906 it was this
new part that fell, the original section
of the house remaining unharmed.
The old Stanford residence was ori
ginally owned by a mysterious English
man by the name of Goroon. He was
chiefly known for his hospitality and
the lavish entertainment of bis guests.
He called bis estate Palo Alto, as the
two big redwood trees, one of which is
now standing, were on his property.
The name Palo Alto means "tall tree."
