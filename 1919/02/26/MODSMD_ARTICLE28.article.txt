Some expression of the attitude of a
University woman in regard to the
freshman parade Seems to be called for
since the matter does not appear to have
been definitely closed by the action of
the Student Council in prohibiting
future parades.
Every woman who saw even a part
of the parade on Saturday or who has
heard it discussed since then realizes
that it was a serious affront to her and
to social decency. She can also appre
ciate the fact, generally recognized, that
the actual participants in the affair were
not the sole offenders—that the fra
ternity upperclassmen who lent assist
ance or toleration to the affair as well
as those who as spectators made no
effort to break it up, were guilty of
equal violations of respect and decency.
So keenly do the women feel the in
sult that was forced on them, and
even more than the personal offense,
the revelation of the existence on the
campus of an element untrue to Stan
ford ideals, that endorsement of any
just action taken by the authorities to
prevent recurrence of such an affair,
and of any efforts to eradicate the root
of the evil, follows naturally. While
to permit the guilty to go unpunished
holds no satisfaction for those who were
offended, nevertheless, it can readily be
seen that in such a case responsibility is
so diversified that it can never be fully
and justly placed.
In spite of the offending nature of
the parade and the disagreeable noto-1
riety given it locally and beyond the J
campus reflecting on the name of the j
University, there is one phase of the!
situation which may bring actual bene
fit. Surely all the revulsion of feeling
and decent indignation of the men not
in sympathy with the element responsi
ble for the parade and also for the
acts of destructive vandalism commit
ted on the campus during the last quar
ter can be used as a basis for a perma
nent welding together of the studenl
body and a co-operation with llie faculty. I
culminating in the restoration of a per
fected form of student control. How
ever unsuccessful student control may
have proved in the state into which it
degenerated during the last years of its
existence, in view of the events of the j
last four months, faculty control can- j
not be said to have proved any more j
successful.
However severely the women of the
University condemn the men fir par
ticipating in and permitting such an ex
hibition before the public, they still re
tain enough confidence in them to sup
port the belief that the men will be
equal to the task of wiping out th
events which now mar the name of
Stanford and starting afresh.

to social decency. She can also appre
ciate the fact, generally recognized, that
the actual participants in the affair were
not the sole offenders—that the fra
ternity upperclassmen who lent assist
ance or toleration to the affair as well
as those who as spectators made no
effort to break it up, were guilty of
equal violations of respect and decency.
So keenly do the women feel the in
sult that was forced on them, and
even more than the personal offense,
the revelation of the existence on the
campus of an element untrue to Stan
ford ideals, that endorsement of any
just action taken by the authorities to
prevent recurrence of such an affair,
and of any efforts to eradicate the root
of the evil, follows naturally. While
to permit the guilty to go unpunished
holds no satisfaction for those who were
offended, nevertheless, it can readily be
seen that in such a case responsibility is
so diversified that it can never be fully
and justly placed.
In spite of the offending nature of
the parade and the disagreeable noto-1
riety given it locally and beyond the J
campus reflecting on the name of the j
University, there is one phase of the!
situation which may bring actual bene
fit. Surely all the revulsion of feeling
and decent indignation of the men not
in sympathy with the element responsi
ble for the parade and also for the
acts of destructive vandalism commit
ted on the campus during the last quar
ter can be used as a basis for a perma
nent welding together of the studenl
body and a co-operation with llie faculty. I
culminating in the restoration of a per
fected form of student control. How
ever unsuccessful student control may
have proved in the state into which it
degenerated during the last years of its
existence, in view of the events of the j
last four months, faculty control can- j
not be said to have proved any more j
successful.
However severely the women of the
University condemn the men fir par
ticipating in and permitting such an ex
hibition before the public, they still re
tain enough confidence in them to sup
port the belief that the men will be
equal to the task of wiping out th
events which now mar the name of
Stanford and starting afresh.
