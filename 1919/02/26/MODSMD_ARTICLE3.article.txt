# MAX ROSEN TO GIVE CONCERT THURSDAY
## Career of Violinist Shows Unusual Contrasts of Fortune 
### 
Max Rosen, the young violinist, who
will give a recital tomorrow night at
Assembly Hall, lias a most romantic
life story. Born of a poor Rumanian
barber in the Side of New York,
lie has risen by virtue of his wonderful
gift with the bow to be one of the
greatest living violinists.
Itosen is a healthy, red-cheeked
youngster, still in his teens, and it is
said of his playing that no other artists
with the exception of such great vocal
ists as John MeCormack or Galli Curci
have ever called forth the unrestraint
of enthusiasm.
The Chicago Evening Post says:
"Rosen's tone quality is beautiful,
warm in color, of carrying power and
with variety in the shading. His tech
nique is clean and sure. It is virtuoso
playing. There is the dash in his way
of doing with a good solid bottom of
control. He has the stuff in him. the
feeling for music, the Angers and the
instinct for the violin." The Chicago
Journal in commenting on his first ap
pearance in Chicago writes: "He
knows how to smile when he is ap
plauded. . . . There was plenty of
chance for him to smile yesterday, for
his audience applauded him to a point
of frenzv."
