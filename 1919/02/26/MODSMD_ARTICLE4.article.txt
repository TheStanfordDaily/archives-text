fessor Robinson discuss "An Objec
tion to the League of Nations."
Professor Robinson stated today
that the objections to the League of
Nations may be grouped into three
classes of argument, constitutional,
economic, and political. Of these the
third type of reasoning is likely to
appeal most widely to the peope. The

arguments do so largely by use of his

of such tradition and precedent to the
present day situation that will form
the subject of the lecture this eve
ning.

eral discussion in which all present
may participate. The meeting vill bo
called sharply at 7:30 in room 12 of
the Law building.
