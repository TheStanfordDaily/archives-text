Action to further the readoption of
student control at Stanford was taken
by the permanent Student Control "ad
visability" committee in their first meet
ing last night.
It was the opinion of the committee
that student self-government is advis
able, and action to bring about its re
establishment was determined upon
along the following three lines: First,
that the committee should correspond
with other universities where this form
of control is in existence, for the pur
pose of finding out their methods and
the degree of success in which it re
sults ; second, that Stanford's former
system be investigated and the rules
codified; and third, that measures be
taken to interest and instruct the stu
dent body at large in these matters.
The committee is planning a number
of open meetings to be held in the
future.

'20, secretary; L. C. Rogers, '17; E. R.
