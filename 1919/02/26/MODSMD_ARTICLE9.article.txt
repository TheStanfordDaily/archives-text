## 
### 
Stanford varsity ring tossers will bat
tle the St. Ignatius Five tonight in the
last intercollegiate league game before

the final games of the Stanford-Califor
nia series. The contest will take place
in San Francisco.
St. Ignatius has a fair combination,
but it has not shown enough ability thus
far during the season to look dangerous
to the Cardinal varsity. If the Stanford
team can show their usual wares there
should be no trouble in walking away
with tonight's game.
If the varsity wins this game it will
leave Stanford, California, and Santa
Clara tied for first place in the league.
The outcome of the next two games
with the lilue and Gold will determine
the final standing. The Missionites have
a pretty sure hold on second place, and
Stanford and California must battle to
see which live will take first or third
place.
The usual varsity men will make the
trip to San Francisco tonight. Esgen
probably will not go on account of his
infected knee but hopes to be able to
>lay Saturday in the game wit!) the
Bruins.
