# ST. IGNATIUS WINS FROM THE STANFORD QUINTET
## SCORE STANDS 33 TO 27 Swanholm, Pelouze, and Moulton Star in Game Last Night 
### 
Stanford varsity lost its chances of
finishing first in the California-Nevaik
basketball series last night when it went
down to defeat before the St. Ignatius
ring tossers by a score of 33 to 27. This
defeat officially put Stanford out of run
ning for the basketball championship.
Interest during the rest of the series
will be centered on the remaining two
games between Stanford and California.
It is almost impossible to "dope" the
outcome of this series; Stanford de
feated Santa Clara and the Missionites
came back strong and downed the
Bruins. California defeated the same
team which downed the local five last
night.
The St. Ignatius defeat was due to a
combination of poor playing and the
conditions on the St. Ignatius court.
The varsity was against the same propo
sition at San Francisco as California
was at Santa Clara. It is almost im
possible to beat these teams on their
undersized courts.
Stanford forwards played a stellar
game during both halves, but the Cardi
nal defense broke down, and the defeat
was largely due to the shooting of the
St. Ignatius forwards. Moulton am
Pelotize both played good games and
shot enough baskets to have won the
game, had the guards put up a strong
enough defense.
Swanholm, who went into the game
during the first part <>112 the second half
in place of Lilly, who went out on per
sonal fouls, played the best defensive
game of anyone on the team. His show
ing in this game came as a surprise, as
he had not been used in many pre
vious games. Coach Evans now consid-
crs him a good prospect for the Cali
fornia series.
Stanford was outplayed during the
first fifteen minutes of the first half,
when St. Ignatius rolled up a score of
22 to 5. The play tightened up in the
second round, and the Cardinals came
through until the score stood 27 to 26
in their favor when only two minutes
were left to play. St. Ignatius spurted
up and was able to convert several long
shots from the middle of the flood, leav
ing the final score 33 to 27 in their
favor.
