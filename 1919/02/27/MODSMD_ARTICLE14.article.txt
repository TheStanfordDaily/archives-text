## Famous American Violinist Wins Commendation From Soldiers 
### 
Music lovers have a rare treat in
store for them in the violin recital of
Max Rosen, the young violinistic sen
sation, at Assembly Hall tonight.
Young Rosen, who on his very first
| appearance in San Francisco last Sun
-1 day has jumped into popularity and
| whose playing reveals him as an artist
with a well-nigh flawless technic and
j a tone of the most beautiful melting
, loveliness, has arranged a most won
derful program for tonight.
The San Francisco critics have com-
I plimented his Sunday's performance
and all agree that ibis young Ameri
can violinist is a genius of the highest
! rank.
Walter Anthony of the Chronicle:
"Max Rosen seems to have the gift
of an individualistic expression, bring
ing to our consciousness something
I that no other violinist can say in quite
the same pure, chaste and winsome
manner. To miss him is to be de
prived of a musical experience that
no other violinist can provide."
Walter Bodin in the Bulletin: "In
him San Francisco found a true poet.
a poet of the violin. He has all the
youth and fire and colorful imagery
of the born poet, the artist supernal.
All the dreams and beauty of the
youth of 18 (somehow or other, one
feels he cannot grow older in heart)
seem to flow through his marvelous
fingers into the chords of his instru
ment."
I Ray Brown of the Examiner: "While
a certain quantum of poesy is assumed
, in the temperament of every musician,
1 it is only when that quantum is large
enough to dominate other cliaracteris
j tics that the title of poet is warrant-
I able. Therefore be it said, emphat
ically, that a new poet of the violin
I was introduced to San Francisco yes
terday in the person of Max Rosen."
The San Francisco Call: "Tone
poems might very well be the term
used to describe the performances of
the youthful violinist. Max Rosen,
who appeared in San Francisco for
the first time yesterday afternoon un
der the management of Frank W.
Healy at the Columbia Theater. But
it would be difficult to find any short.
I comprehensive phrase by which to
characterize the performances of this
remarkable artist, and express their
| full value."

i Kmanuel Balahan, and his father, will
