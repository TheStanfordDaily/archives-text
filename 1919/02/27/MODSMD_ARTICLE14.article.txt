Music lovers have a rare treat in
store for them in the violin recital of
Max Rosen, the young violinistic sen
sation, at Assembly Hall tonight.
Young Rosen, who on his very first
| appearance in San Francisco last Sun
-1 day has jumped into popularity and
| whose playing reveals him as an artist
with a well-nigh flawless technic and
j a tone of the most beautiful melting
, loveliness, has arranged a most won
derful program for tonight.
The San Francisco critics have com-
I plimented his Sunday's performance
and all agree that ibis young Ameri
can violinist is a genius of the highest
! rank.
Walter Anthony of the Chronicle:
"Max Rosen seems to have the gift
of an individualistic expression, bring
ing to our consciousness something
I that no other violinist can say in quite
the same pure, chaste and winsome
manner. To miss him is to be de
prived of a musical experience that
no other violinist can provide."
Walter Bodin in the Bulletin: "In
him San Francisco found a true poet.
