# A
						CALL FOR GOOD MEN
## 
### 
A call has been sent out from the Student Council through the student man
ager for men to try out for positions as assistant student manager, and assistant
managers of the Daily Palo Alto. The best talent in the University should re
spond to this call, and report to the student manager for the tryouts.
There is no undergraduate or student position in the University which de
termines to such a large degree the opinions of other universities on the student
policy at Stanford as that of student manager. Since the new constitution was
adopted by the student body a year ago, this fact has been recognized, and now
men are chosen for the position solely by competitive tryouts to which all men
in the University are eligible.
The success of the Daily Palo Alto depends on its managers, and in the
tryouts for assistants on the paper strong underclassmen have a chance to make
good.
Success of student government, or any government, depends on the interest
shown by those entitled to have a part in government. Good men are needed in
the positions open at present. The best should try out. â€”H. G. S.
