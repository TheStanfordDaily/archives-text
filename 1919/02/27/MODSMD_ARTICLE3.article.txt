# Junior Week Will Be Held May 7, 8, and 9
## 
### 
Junior Week lias been postponed un
til May 7, 8, and 9. This change was
made because, had it been held as ori
ginally planned, it would have conflict
ed with the athletic activities on the
campus. This new date makes it pos
sible for the men in the crew and the
track team to attend the festivities.
