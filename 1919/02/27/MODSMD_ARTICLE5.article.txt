# ROBINSON SPEAKS ON PEACE LEAGUE
## ATTENDANCE IS LARGE Many Objections to Peace Plan Are Explained in Lecture 
### 
"Objections to the League of Na
tions" was the subject used by Assist
ant Professor Robinson in his lecture
before the Euphronia debating club
last night. The meeting was open and
was the best attended of the year, the
seating capacity of room 12 being
taxed almost to the limit.
Professor Robinson classified the
arguments against the proposed
league into constitutional, economic,
and political groups. He explained
each in a measure, and then elaborat
ed largely on the third class.
The lecture in substance first differ
entiated between "principles" and
"policies," in that the latter are deter
mined by attendant circumstances
which may change, and which when
they do change fundamentally must
be met by adequate new policies.
An example was cited in the portion
of Washington's Farewell Address ad
vising against "entangling alliances"
abroad, which is often quoted as an
objection to the new league. Rut in
Washington's time Europe was a con
tinent of struggling monarchies, and
the United States was the world's
newest and weakest nation. Today
monarchy is gone in Europe, and the
United States is the most powerful
country in the world. It was pointed
out that if Washington were liv
ing today he might well change his
policy in view of the highly altered
circumstances.
In the same manner Professor Rob
inson showed how other political argu
ments from history, such as the Mon
roe Doctrine, apply or fail to apply in
the face of present day conditions.
