# CALLING THE KETTLE BLACK

i' l an editorial following the first basketball game
with California to bemoan the absence of good sportsmanship 011
~ the part of the Berkeley rooters, it now seems an opportune mo
ment to call the attention of the Cardinal sport followers to the purpose for
which the article was written.
If Stanford spectators should tomorrow evening in the excitement of
the intercollegiate contest revert to the tactics for which we reproached our
opponents it would be an unfortunate repetition of the cat calling the kettle
black.
It may seem like tiresome and unnecessary advice, this constant harping
on old fashioned ideas of good sportsmanship. Some people may even think
that to remind a Stanford man of what true sportsmanship is, is really an
Insult; unfortunately, however, such reminder is at times necessary, for even
in a student body composed of Stanford men and women, with Stanford ideals
of sportsmanship, there are those who have not become imbued with the
spirit of Stanford.
It is this spirit of Stanford that is called "the Fighting Spirit." It is
fighting spirit, from the start to the finish, of each contest; it is the fighting
spirit that we distinguish from the Berkeley spirit so unfortunately displayed
in the first basket contest.
It is this Stanford fighting spirit that will prevent any action on the part
of the Cardinal sympathizers in the game tomorrow evening that may pos
sibly present an odious comparison to unfair tactics on one's own home court.
The Cardinal is host tomorrow; the entertainment for the visiting team will
probably be hot enough during the time of play, but let it be clean entertain
ment on their part as well as of the spectators.
Support of the Stanford quintet should be expressed by rooters and yell
leaders, by spectators and band, but rather in & Stanford way than in any
other more lamentable fashion. Support of the Stanford basketers does not
mean jeers for the opposition players or foul-shooters, or even the well-mean
ing. misunderstood referee; it means simple attendance and noise for the
Stanford team.
