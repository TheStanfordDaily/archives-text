# Santa Clara Five Will Play Here
## First Varsity Baseball Game Will Be on Stanford Field Tomorrow 
### 
THROUGH the efforts of Student
Manager Ames, the first Santa
Clara-Stanford baseball game will be
played on Stanford baseball lot
morrow afternoon at 2:30. The game
was originally scheduled for the Santa
Clara diamond, but since the contest for
last Wednesday was called off on ac
count of rain, the Mission athletic au
thorities consented to having the game
played here.
Coach Evans intends to start New
lands in the box and Smith on the re
ceiving end. Teubner, candidate for
the initial sack, will be unable to re
main in college the rest of the quarter
on account of sickness in his family,
and so his loss will make a hole in the
infield'. Captain "Jim" Galloway will
play first base tomorrow.
Although the Santa Clara squad has
been working out for about six weeks,
the Cardinal team will undoubtedly
make a good showing in the first game
of the season. Hickey, Santa Clara
southpaw, and O'Neill, right-hander,
will work out on the slab for the Mis
sion team.
The Stanford players will step to the
plate in the following order tomorrow:
Kallum, ss; Stevens, 3b; Galloway, lb;
Kline, cf; Crowe, If; Doe, 2b; Bundy,
rf; Smith, c; Newlands and Gillis, p.
In order to arouse the baseball fans
on the campus, an inter-fraternity series
of baseball games will start next week.
Captain Galloway is arranging a sched
ule which will be announced next week.
Student body tickets will admit to the
game.
