# STANFORD'S PLACE IN LEAGUE IS NOT DETERMINED
## CANNOT REACH THE TOP Cardinal May Defeat Bears Twice and Yet Leave Title Uncertain 
### 
Standings in the California-Ne
vada League in basketball are more
mixed up this year than ever before.
At the present, Santa Clara, St. Ignatius,
and California are leading the league,
while Stanford has a chance by defeat
ing California in the next two contests
to put herself near the top.
Until the Cardinal-Blue and Gold
series the standing was simple. Neither
Stanford nor California had lost a
game, and it seemed as though the series
between these two universities would
settle the till. California won the first
game, and was in the lead.
Then Santa Clara upset the dope by
beating California, after Stanford had
defeated the Mission five. Thus three
teams were tied for first place. Stan
ford then won from the University of
Nevada, and went into first place by
virtue of five wins and one defeat, as
against four wins and one defeat for
California. Then Stanford played St.
Ignatius and lost, after California had
won from the same team,
j. This game left the Cardinals with two
beatings, California with one, Santa
Clara with one. and St. Ignatius with
one. The league standing is as follows,
for the leaders.
Won. Lost.
California 4 1
Santa Clara 3 1
St. Ignatius 2 1
Stanford 5 2
Should California win the series from
Stanford, Santa Clara would be declared
champions of the league, since the Blue
and Gold would have defeated every
team in the league except Santa Clara.

If Stanford wins the series from Cali
fornia, St. Ignatius would land at the
top of the league, for this team lias
beaten the Cardinal. All this despite the
fact that Stanford has beaten Santa
Clara, and California has won from St.
Ignatius.
Ihe league dope was further upset
when Pavis Farm School won from St.
Mary's. The Oakland school was sup
posed to have one of the strong lives
in the league, and Davis was doped to
be very weak. Yet Davis won. This
game had no effect on first place, yet it
further mixed up the whole standing.
