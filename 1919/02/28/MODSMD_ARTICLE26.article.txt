# Rosen Concert Pleases Audience
## 
### JEAN FRICKELTON, '20 
Pure music was what Max Rosen
gave his audience in the Assembly
Hall last night—pure music unadul
terated by the cold technique so com
mon to many great artists. Rosin
played with singing warmth and hu
man emotion that caused his hearers
to lose their hearts and made them
loathe to leave at the end of the pro
gram .
His youth and graciousness com
bined with hi sartistic touch —now
vigorous, now tender —made his work
last night marvelously effective. It
was a delight to hear his performance
of the melodious B minor concerto by
Saint-Saens. His facile technique was
evident in the charm and apparent
simplicity of the most difficult pas
sages.
With poetic sensitiveness he played
the beautiful Summer Idyll by Bur
leigh and Blgar's fascinating La Oa
pricieuse. These received so much
admiration from the audience that
Rosen was called back for two encores
—the immensely popular Schoen Rob
warin and Caprice Viennois, both bv
Kreisler.
The familiar Spanish Dance by
Sarosate, as the last number on the
program, reflected Rosen's fascinating
individuality and left all who heard
him firmly convinced of bis unusual
genius.
