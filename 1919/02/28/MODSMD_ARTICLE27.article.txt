# "International Law Will See Important Changes"—-Huston
## 
### C.A. Huston, Dean of Law School 
Anyone who has speculated as t<
the future order of the world must cer
tainly have thought about the future
of international law. Regardless of the
adoption of the League of Nations, the
changes that have come about since the
war make a more secure form of pro
cedure in international law essential to
our safety. Dean Huston of the law
department has presented the Daily
L J alo Alto with some of his views in
the following article which he believes
are the essential changes that are to be
made:

"The changes that the adoption of
the covenant of nations will make in
international law are essentially changes
in emphasis. International law is the
body of rules and principles by which
civilized states are considered bound in
their intercourse with each other. In
ternational law, therefore, presupposes
some kind of a League of Nations and
the common consent of civili/.ed nations
to abide by the rules and principles of
international law constitutes an already
existing covenant, in part unwritten but
in large part already embodied in
treaties between these states.
"It must be remembered in considering
these changes, first of all, that peace is
the normal and war the abnormal inter
national situation. International law is,
therefore, principally and normally con
cerned with international relations in
time of peace. The international law
ot' peace is in part substantive, dealing
with restrictions imposed in the general
interest on the individual state's right
of jurisdiction within its own territory;
the protection of national interest
abroad; the regulation of immigration,
travel, sojourn, and of commerce; the
protection of the general interest by co
operative action such as provisions for
extradition and the regulation of means
of communication; and finally, the sub
stitution of peaceful means, diplomatic

or judicial, for force in the settlement
of international disputes.
"In addition to this substantive law
there is much procedural international
law of peace, dealing with the ordinary
diplomatic intercourse between states
and the method of procedure in the
settlement of international disputes by
peaceful means. With respect to all of
this the more important division /of
international law, the covenant of na
tions greatly extends the area of co
operative action for the general good,
especially with respect to the treatment
of the backward peoples not yet ready
for admission to full status in the fam
ily of nations.
"Needed machinery is provided in the
covenant for the definition and codifica
tion of many fields of international law
in which the rules are now either vague
or in dispute. This difficulty, which
characterizes international law to ia
greater extent than other law, is due
to the fact that no permanent body has
hitherto existed to perform the quasi
legislative functions of formulation and
codification of international custom.
"But the principal effect of the cove
nant upon international law is that it
puts a relatively effective sanction back
of the rules and principles which con
stitute this law. By means of the great
extension of the principle of concerted
action in preventing recourse to war and
of concerted action to redress an inter
national wrong if need be by resort to
war, the community of nations has been
provided with new international organs
having more than merely moral author
ity. International law has hitherto
lacked any well-defined ultimate physi
cal sanction except self-help by an in
jured nation.
"The covenant provides not merely a
means of making the moral sanction of
world public opinion more effective, but,
further, it provides the only physical
sanction now possible, the co-operative
action of the states adhering to the cove
nant, —a co-operative action regulated

and controlled by an informed public
opinion and a defined l and orderly legal
procedure.
"Finally, provision is made for the
establishment of a world court to ad
minister the system of international law.
At present international law is enforced,
so fa ra sit is juidcially enforce dat all,
in the municipal courts of the various
nations or in special tribunals created for
the settlement of a particular dispute.
The provision of a world court will ob
viously crown the structure of interna
tional law so far as its judicial adminis
tration is concerned."
