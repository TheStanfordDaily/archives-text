# BRUIN-CARDINAL QUINTETS TANGLE IN SECOND GAME
## Contest In Gym To-morrow Night 
### JESSEE E. THRASH, '21 
STANFORD and California varsity
fives will clash at Encina gym
nasium tomorrow night in the critical
court battle of their season. If the Blue
and Gold team wins, California will have
first place in the intercollegiate league.
Stanford is out of running in the
league, but the local players have deter
mined to take the dual series from the
Bears.
Whether or not the Cardinals will
twist Bruin's tail tomorrow night de
pends to a large extent on the way tin-
Stanford guards come through. Lack
of defense lost the game with St. Igna
tius, and the contest tomorrow night
will be won or lost by the guards.
Forwards Are Strong
The Cardinal forwards are going as
well as usual and should be able to put
a mighty fast game against Califor
nia.. Esgen, who is the best shot on
the team, has recovered from an in
fected knee and will be able to go into
the game. Moulton and Pelouze are
capable of playing a fast game, but
have not so good an eye for the basket.
Righter can be depended on to do his
part at center even though he is con
stantly shadowed by two or three of the
opposing players.
Responsibility on Guards
If the guards will play the game as
they know how, the odds will be on the
side of the Cardinal. Defensive work
to keep the California forwards from
piling up a high score on long shots i;
absolutely necessary.

Coach Evans has four good men to
draw on for the defensive end of the
court. Williamson and Lilly will prob
ably start, and Caughey and Swanholm
will be held in reserve. The latter

player has come through so well in the
last few practices that Coach Evans
now considers him one of his hcst men.
California Confident.
According to a recent issue of the


Captain Swede Righter, upon whom
the brunt of the Cardinal offensive
will fall.
Daily Californian, Coach Hollander of
the Bruin aggregation is "absolutely
sure of the result of the final score."
He has recently added "Jap" Symes to
his list of first-team men and believes
that he has made the big find of the
season. Symcs will play at forward
as a teammate of his brother, "Jack"
Symes.
"Jack" Symcs is the most dangerous

member of the Blue and Gold combina
tion and possesses ability to shoot from
any angle of the court. Majors may
not be able to play on account of an in

fected knee. His absence would he a
serious handicap to the California live.
Coach Evans is not so confident over
the outcome of the contest tomorrow
night.
"If the Stanford team will play the
game as they have been taught there
will be no difficulty in taking this game
and eventually the series. The players
know the game and it is only a ques
tion of coming through with a good
brand of teamwork and defense."
The game will be called at 8 o'clock
tomorrow night. The usual admission
will be charged.


Coach Evans, whose system of play
will have a thorough test tomorrow
night.
