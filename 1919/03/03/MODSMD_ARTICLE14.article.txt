# STANFORD FIVE LOSES THE SERIES WITH CALIFORNIA
## GAME SPOILED BY FOULS Coach Hollander's Quintet Outclasses Evans' Men In Fast Game 
### H. G. Swendsen, '20 
STANFORD lost the basketball
championship to California last
Saturday night in Encina gymnasium
when the Blue and Gold won the sec
ond game of the series, 34 to 25. The
basketeers from across the bay won
the game and series in the second hall!
when Stanford lost her stride com
pletely, and allowed California to
make 22 points to 9 for the Cardinal,
all these on l'oul shots.
Captain Righter was the only Stan
ford man who scored consistently for
the "Farm" team, and even he, dur
ing the second half, failed to make a
basket.
Forwards Weak
Stanford's weakness throughout the
series, that of lack of forwards who
could score, came to the front more
strongly Saturday than ever before.
The Blue and Cold realized they need
not fear anyone on the offensive but
Righter. Had there been one other
man in the game who was dangerous,
California would have been forced to
cover him at all times, Righter would
have been left alone, and Stanford
would have won.
Team Fights Hard
The team fought hard during the
first half, and led at half time by .i
score of 1G to 12. But immediately
after the whistle blew to start the
second period, the Cardinal players
seemed to rest on their laurels, and
Califofrnia quickly slipped into tin?
lead.
Officials Kearns and Harris were
kept busy all through the game calling
fouls. "Jap" Svmes, Captain Green,
and Majors went out of the game for
roUgh playing by California, while ,i
like fate came to Pelouze and Lilly
