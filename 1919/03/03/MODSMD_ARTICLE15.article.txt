### 
California soccer men defeated the
local aggregation last Saturday morn
ing by the score of 7 to 2. The game
was one of the speediest workouts held
in the local soccer field for some
months.
At the end of the tirst half, prospects
for the Cardinal walking off with the
long end of the score was almost as
sured. The score stood 7 to 1 in favor
of the Bruins, and the farm boys were
just making their second goal when
Captain Drury, the Stanford's mainstay
and all-star player, was severely injured
and could not play the rest of the game.
As soon as the local captain was out
of the lineup, it was clear that the Car
dinal was doped to lose. Ankelsmith,
California forward who played opposite
to Drury and who came recently from
a Holland soccer team, practically won
the game for the Blue and Gold.
• The game from the beginning to the
end was probably the speediest soccer
game played on the local field. The
home boys fought to the very last whis
tle.
The Stanford soccer team will meet
the Californians again this coming I ri
day in the second game of the series,
and it is thought by the farm dopemak
ers that the Cardinals will cotne through
just a little stronger than the "up bay"
team.
