# DISCUSSIONâ€”INTEREST-SUCCESS

### 
Committee on Student Control makes announce
> ment today of its intention to call for two Univer-
Assemblies at which to invite general discussion of student
control in its application to Stanford, with an idea of its ultimate
re-adoption, there is a feeling of renewed confidence that student control will
soon again become a vital part in student life. Realizing that student control
would eventually be missed in its absence, and realizing that public discus
sion and public interest were essentials to its successful adoption, we have
assumed the fixed policy of advocating such open discussion as that outlined,
as the best manifestation ot such interest.
It takes an unusual event to crystalize large, slow-moving organs, such as
a student body, into activity. Regrettable in all other respects except this
one, the Washington Birthday parade, still hanging fire in its solution, has
clearly shown the need of student control as a part of student organization.
As communicated to these columns in an article in a recent edition ex
pressive of student opinion would have been vastly more emphatic and of
vastly greater influence upon the ultimate solution had the students possessed
the actual power wherewith to enforce rather than merely to plan or con
demn. There could Jiever have been any such threat to the peaceful' condition
of the campus through continued agitation had the students felt that theirs
was really the responsibility, the power and the force to immediately cure
existing evils.
Being reawakened to the need for student control, the call for University
discussion comes most appropriately. Discussion is ever a source of devel
oping success; discussion will bring ideas, plans and remedies; furthermore,
discussion will convince any "doubting Thomases" that the students are in
earnest in their desire for student control.
Once discussion has developed sufficient interest, student control will no
longer be vaguely doubtful in its chances of reappearance on the campus; it
will be almost an actuality. With interest aroused to a sufficient point, suc
cess even is no longer a possibility merely, but a probability.
Since discussion leads to interest and interest to success, the Daily wel
comes the action of the Student Control Committee in its call for university
discussion.
