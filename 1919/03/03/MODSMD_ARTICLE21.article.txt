# NEW SERVICE BOARD WILL HOLD MEETING TOMORROW NIGHT
## 
### 
Following the adoption of the resolu
tion which provides for the Women's
Service Hoard at the mass meeting last
Thursday, Miss Margaret Shedd, '20, has
called the first meeting of the l>oard for
tomorrow night at 7:30 in the Women's
Club House. Plans for the immediate
work in philanthropic lines will be dis
cussed and definite action will be taken
in regard to the Stanford Clinics.
Women eligible for new committees will
be discussed and the general reorganiza
tion of the Women's War Board will be
considered and probably decided upon.
The work for the Stanford Clinic will
be begun at once on the campus and
committees will be formed to cover the
different branches of the work. A cer
tain number of women will be expected
to visit the Clinics each week and take
the comforts which will be provided by
another committee on the campus. All
of the work will be of a practical na
ture and should be of considerable in
terest to the women of the campus.
