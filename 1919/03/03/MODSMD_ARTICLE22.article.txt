# Women Will Hold Inter Class Basketball Game
## 
### 
There will be a basketball game be
tween the sophomore and freshman
women tomorrow afternoon at 1
o'clock. All women who have been
trying out are urged to be there. Miss
Henrietta Hoever is freshman captain
and Miss Marie Hutton is sophomore
captain. Miss Fanny Knox, '19, will
act as referee.
A game was planned for Friday with
San Mateo High School, but was post
poned on account of the rain. The
game will be played soon, however,
and the team will be picked from
among those playing in the interclass
games.
