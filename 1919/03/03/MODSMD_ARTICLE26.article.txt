# Charles Woodbury Lectures Tomorrow
## 
### 
Something new will he furnished for
the Tuesday lecture audience this week
by Charles J. Woodbury, who will give
personal reminiscences of Ralph Wahid
Emerson. The lecture will be held in
the Little Theater tomorow evening at
7 :30.
It is promised that this talk by Mr.
Woodbury will be entirely different.
Not even one of the anecdotes is found
in any biography. The talk will be given
without notes, and will be entirely in
formal.
"A man may bring knowledge to us
by conveying to us what he has studied,
or what he has read in a book; but the
electric currents are transmitted through
us by those who tell what they have seen
with their own eyes, the voices they
have heard with their own ears." The
intimate and vivid presentation that the
speaker will give of Emerson in his daily
life and characteristics is said by
those who have heard him make his
hearers feel Emerson's very presence.
Mr. Woodbury has given this talk
throughout the United States with much
success everywhere.
