## Noted Organist Will Give a Recitial Next Friday in Memorial Church 
### 
Joseph Bonnett, the distinguished
French, organ virtuoso, who has come
to America under the auspices of the
French-American Association for Mu
sical Art, will play for a University
assembly next Friday morning at 11
o'clock in the Memorial Church.
Through the artistic success of Jo
seph Bonnett the organ recital has
enjoyed an unprecedented popularity
in the musical world which has not
been found since the days of the
famous Guilmant. Throughout the en
tire east, Bonnett has i>Jayed to en
thusiastic audiences and it is only be
cause of a considerable amount of e£-
lort on the part of the Public Exer
cises Committee that the University
has been able to secure an engage
ment with him.
One of the most remarkable fea
turee of Bonnett's playing is that all
of his selections are rendered from
memory and he is said to have tht 3
largest repertoire of any artist in liis
line. During the season of 1910-1911
Bonnett gave more than forty recitals
at St. Eustaclie in France, no single
piece being played more than once and
all of the recitals rendered from mem
ory. These recitals proved the means
of inaugurating in Paris a great popu
lar movement in favor of organ music
and the same attempt has proved suc
cessful in the United States as far as
Joseph Bonnett is concerned.
Bonnett io saiu to have a remark
able personality, which is one of the
causes for his phenomenal success. He
is a master of technique and his pow
ers of interpretation have given him a
style comparable only to the famous
Guilmant almost one hundred years
ago.
