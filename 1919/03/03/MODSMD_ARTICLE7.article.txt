# S.A.T.C. Men Will Get Sixty Dollars
## 
### 
Students who were in the Stanford
S. A. T. C. will receive a bonus of $60
from the government by a hill that was
recently passed in congress and signed
by President Wilson. All men dis
charged from military forces will re
ceive the compensation; no distinction
will be made between officers and pri
vates.
The government will issue blanks
which will be tilled out and sent to
Washington accompanied by discharge
papers. There have been no specific in
structions for the army as yet, hut it is
understood that application blanks will
be obtained from Captain Parker at the
R. O. T. C. headquarters. The law
provides that only those who have been
discharged after April 6, 1917, or who
entered the service before November 11,
1918, can receive the bonus.
A naval circular has already been is
sued on the subject. "The beneficiaries
of this act are," it reads, "officers and
enlisted men of the regular navy, all re
servists, male and female, all persons in
the service of the Coast Guard and Geo
detic and Lighthouse service who
have performed active duty during the
present war.
"In case the original discharge or or
ders to inactive duty are lost it will be
necessary to obtain a certified copv from

the Bureau of Navigation, Navy Depart
ment, Washington, D. C., and a certifi
cate from the officer by whom final set
tlement of pay accounts was made, that
no credit of this gratuity was made to
him." It will be noted by this that naval
reservists will receive compensation by
the application with orders to inactive
duty since they have no discharge pa
pers.
