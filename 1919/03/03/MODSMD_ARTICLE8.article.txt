# STUDENT CONTROL COMMITTEE ASKS FOR TWO ASSEMBLIES
## AIM TO AROUSE INTEREST Hope to Start Feeling of Responsibility in Students 
### 
TWO student-body assemblies for
stimulating interest and discus
sion of student control are to be asked
for by (he student control committee,
according to a decision reached last
night in a meeting at the Stanford Inn.
A? these student body meetings all
phases of the student government
question will be discussed.
While continued investigation of the
methods of student control in other in
stitutions and in this University in the
past is essential, the committee be
lieves that the most important prob
lem at the present time in this con
nection is the arousing of interest
among the men and women of Stan
ford in student problems. The pro
posed assemblies will be the first
move to this end.
According to the opinion of the com
mittee arrived at in last night's meet
ing, the machinery for student control
is the simple part of the problem. '1 he
important concern is the establish
ment of a feeling of responsibility in
the students such as is felt in the
law department in regard to the honor
system. Consequently frequent stu
dent body meetings are to be urged
to keep the interest up.
The mips of tl>Â° tormer student
conference are being codified by the
committee, in accordance with the
plans made at the first meeting. Let
ters have been sent out to a large
number of other universities asking
the opinion of both the faculty and
students as to their methods of stu
dent control.
