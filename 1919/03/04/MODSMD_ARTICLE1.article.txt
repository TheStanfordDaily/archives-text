# 1920 YEARBOOK WILL BE LARGEST YET PUBLISHED
## LEMOS HAS CHARGE OF ART SECTION Quad to Contain 460 Pages of Reading Matterâ€”Snaps Requested 
### 
The 1920 Quad is to he one of the
largest ever published at Stanford was
the announcement made by the manage
ment today which states that the book
will contain no less than 500 pages, with
at least 460 pages of reading matter.
Six editorial and four managerial try
outees are kept busy collecting and co
ordinating details in the construction of
the yearbook, and results of their efforts
are plainly indicated by the rapidly fill
ing "dummy" under the care of the
editors.
One big feature of this year's Quad
will be the art section, which is wholly
in charge of Pedro J. Lemos, whose
prints in the 1919 yearbook were among
its principal attractions.
Junior photos and most of the organi
zation pictures have been taken and are
ready for the engraver.
The management states, however, that
no very great response was made to a
recent appeal for any snaps of promi
nent activities during the last two quar
ters. The tryoutees are very anxious to
get any views of the song festival of
last June, or of any of the more im
portant initiations of campus honor
societies, and any persons having in their
possession such snaps are asked to hand
them to one of the tryoutees. Pictures of
Stanford men of recent years who served
in responsible positions in this country
or who were in service overseas are
likewise desired.
