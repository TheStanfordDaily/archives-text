# NEED MORE MATERIAL FOR VARSITY EIGHT, SAYS CAPTAIN
## CREW PRACTICING DAILY ON LAGUNITA "Les" Rogers is Coaching Shell Men This Season 
### 
More material is wanted for the
varsity shell .according to Frank
Watts, 1919 crew captain. Although
practice has been in full sway for the
last few weeks, Captain Watts wants
it understood that it is not too late to
sign up for water sport. "Les" Rog
ers' ineligibility for this year's crew
greatly handicaps the varsity boat.
However, Rogers is taking charge of
lue coaching.
There are seventy-two men out for
crew, but a large proportion of these
are out for the freshman shell. It is
hoped to raise the number of candi
dates to a hundred before the end of
the present week. Those wishing to
sign up must see Rogers or Watts im
mediately, because the date set for
the race on the Oakland estuary is
May 3, allowing the new men only two
months' training.
Regular practice will continue every
afternoon on the lake, until Saturday,
March 15, for the final examination
week. Practice will be resumed at
the Redwood City estuary March 22
or 23. It is thought that the men will
be sufficiently accustomed to the
water at that time to venture on the
rougher waters of the bay.
