# CHARLES J. WOODBURY WILL SPEAK TONIGHT
## Talk Will Throw New Light On the Life of Ralph Waldo Emerson 
### 
An evening of intimate, personal
memories of Emerson may be enjoyed
tonight, when Charles J. Woodbury
speaks in the Little Theatre at 7:30.
Although it is promised that this lec
ture talk will be delightful, yet thos<:
who have heard the speaker say that the
man behind the address is best of all.
His whole-hearted, quaint way adds
much to the pleasure of listening.
Mr. Woodbury was a personal friend
of Ralph Waldo Emerson for many
years. As a result the speaker is able
to make it seem almost as if Emerson
stood before the audience. Mr. Wood
bury gave Stanford one of his popular
lectures several years ago. At that time
Professor Gray of the English depart
ment said of him, "Mr, Woodbury's
address was of great value. T haev re
ceived more downright gratitude for
having brought him to Stanford than
anvthinu else 1 have ever done here "
