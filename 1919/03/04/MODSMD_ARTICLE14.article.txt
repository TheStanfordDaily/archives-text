# STUDENT BODY OWNERSHIP

the student body to overlook ati opportunity for betterment
any condition, however trivial, is a gross mistake. That
j!ll-~r_there is much room for improvement in many conditions
•Jpi iat the University is undisputed, but the person suggesting the
improvement unfortunately always runs against that undefeated bogey,
campus tradition.
Now as to those campus dances. If anything is said about them the unfortunate
speaker or writer runs the risk of either making weight of a frivolous subject
or of running counter to an actually young "age-old" tradition. But to the
casual, averagely social individual some impression must be made by the con
stant appearance of those artistic signs and announcements of campus dances,
hybrid jollyups, taggy informals and other novel social stunts that litter up our
week-ends. We like them and urge their continuance, but feel that there is a great
deal of wasted opportunity for the student body in permitting these constant and
weekly functions to remain ever private in their monetary end.
The great ease with which any person may sign up for an event of the
week-end, by simply attaching an appropriate title in the date book, by procuring
some ever ready music, and equally ready publicity from an ambitious reporter,
proves the truth of the assertion that, if organized and regulated, the campus
dance fund of enjoyment and gain could be sccurcd for the student body.
This idea is not new to campus thought and the Daily takes no credit for
its appearance (although the blame for it will undoubtedly fall upon us). In
tangible form we make, however, this suggestion, viz., that the student body
through some appropriate and trustworthy organ secure the right to present
those campus dances which are neither private and invitational in thein uature
nor ttie special prerogative of some recognized campus organization; and that
the student body furthermore regulate these affairs so that they will lose none
of their novelty, but rather develop some, that they will lose none of their enjoy
able characteristics, but at the same time run under the supervision of a proper
student body organization and become productive of some gain to the student
body is a suggestion most urgently asked for by these columns. The public
ownership of utilities theory is becoming in many places an actuality. Let us
have student body ownership of dance floor utilities.
