# COSMOPOLITAN CLUB HEARS PRES. WILBUR
## Speaker Discusses College Education in Relation to Future Tasks 
### 
One of the tilings learned in this war
is the need of more real education," said
Dr. Wilbur in discussing universities
and education, at the Cosmopolitan Club
meeting, held at his home last night.
"War is full of realities; material
things that are true come to the front,
and colleges and universities are organ
ized primarily for discerning facts and
not opinions."
Unless we discern the facts of nature
we cannot get on, somebody must know,
I)r. Wilbur believes. Serbia is an ex
ample, he claims, of a people helpless
against the coordinate education of the
many, on account of her lack of uni
versities. The United States, however,
has a general educational average high
er than that of other countries, because
our educational institutions are dis
persed throughout our state universities.
The effect of college education upon
the individual, observed through a study
of the work accomplished on the food
commission by Dr Wilbur, showed the
marked ability of the college man of
adapting himself to new kinds of work,
and of meeting and solving new obsta
cles. This was due primarily to the
training of the mind to absorb facts, that
had been received while in college, rath
er than to any particular subject.
"()ne of the great advantages of this
war. that will come from the association
with the allied nations, will be the form
ing of an internationalism of university
personnel, cooperating and disseminating
understanding." Reference was made to
the fact that various universities arc
now planning to exchange professors.
