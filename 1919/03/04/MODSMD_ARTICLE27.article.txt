# THURSDAY IS LAST "Y" NIGHT THIS QUARTER
## Billie Burke in a Five-Reel Movie Will Feature the Program 
### 
Thursday evening, March 6, has been
set as the final "Y" night of the quarter.
The Y. M. C. A. plans to make this the
best all-university entertainment of the
winter quarter, and for the purpose has
secured a number of interesting slides
and a clever "movie."
The slides consist of colored plates
illustrating the progress toward Chris
tianizing World Democracy. They will
show the radical changes which are oc
curring in the lines of religions, educa
tional, industrial and political develop
ment in foreign lands. Dr. F. E. Mor
gan, the local head of the Y. M. C. A.,
will explain the slides.
The "movie" secured for the occasion
will be a five-reel comedy drama featur
ing Miss Billie Burke. "In Pursuit of
Polly" is the title of the picture.
As the entertainment will commence
promptly at 7:15, all those expecting to
attend are urged to be at the Assembly
Hall on time.
