wait until the representatives of the vari
ous houses could meet to discuss the
forming of an inter-fraternity confer
ence.
There will be a meeting of representa
tives of the various Greek letter houses

Union at 8:30, for this purpose.

is formed it will mean that the time and
methods of rushing, the time of initia
tions, and other such affairs that con

settled by the conference.
