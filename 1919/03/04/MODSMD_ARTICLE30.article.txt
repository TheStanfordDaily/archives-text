# FRATERNITY WOMEN ACCOMPLISH MUCH WAR RELIEF WORK
## 
### 
Practically all women's fraternities
have been carrying on some definite kind
of war work, although few people know
just what the Greek sisters have been
doing.
Kappa Alpha Theta has raised a war
fund of $5,470, of which $3,800 was sent
to Miss Jane Delano, head of the De
partment of Nurses of the American
Red Cross.
Chi Omega has already raised $6,(K)(>
and has instituted a new drive vvitli
which to support its representatives in
France.
Everyone has heard of Delta Gamma's
"mile of dimes" by which it lias secured
$13,416 for work among the destitute
children of Belgium and France.
Kappa Kappa Gamma has been asso
ciated with Dorothy Canfield Fisher in
her French relief work. It has furnished
her with material help in the line of
clothing and supplies to assist in carry
ing on her work of mercy.
Delta Delta Delta has established a
large home in France for girls who work
in munition factories.
\The Gamma Phi Beta campaign has
been unique and was a suggestion of an
active alumnae. Its work has been cen
tered around the "Milk Bottle Cam
paign." Large wooden stands bearing
milk bottles with a plea to help the
starving children of Belgium and France
have been placed in front of theaters and
restaurants. The aim is to establish a
Gamma Phi Beta shelter with the money
obtained.
