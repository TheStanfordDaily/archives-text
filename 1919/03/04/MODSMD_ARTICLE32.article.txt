# CAMPUS DANCE WILL FOLLOW SOPH PLAY
## 
### 
Arrangements for a campus dance to
be given at the Women's Club House
after the sophomore play are being com
pleted by several prominent campus mu
sicians.
"His Majesty's Rail," as the dance is
being termed, will be similar to the
Ram's Head dance, and the best jazz
music on the campus has been secured
for the occasion. The dance will be a
1 o'clock affair and several special stunts
are being arranged.
