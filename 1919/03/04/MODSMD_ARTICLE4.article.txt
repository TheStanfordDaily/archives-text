# '21-'22 WILL HOLD INTERCLASS DEBATE ON THURSDAY NIGHT
## 
### 
Thursday, March 6, is the date set for
the annual freshman-sophomore debate
which will constitute the last exhibition
of inter-class rivalry for the present
quarter. As this class forensic was sus
pended during the war period, the con
test Thursday will mark the revival of
one more of Stanford's traditions.
The question to be argued is, "Re
solved. that Ireland should be allowed a
plebiscite on her political future." Nine
teen twenty-two will be represented by
A. Garrett. L. W. Gerson and S. G.
Trimble, while L. W. Hodges, R. T.
Cowell and Miss Dorothy Webster will
uphold the sophomore position. Miss
Webster was a member of the winning
College of the Pacific team last year, and
Hodges was a member of Euphronia's
victorious inter-society team for 1918.
Of the freshman trio, both Garrett and
Trimble were members of the varsity
squad during the S. A. T. C. period at
Stanford.
The debate will be held in the Little
Theater and will begin promptly at 8
o'clock. Coach McClintock states that
the speakers are well prepared on the
question, and he advises that students
interested in speaking and forensic work
will do well to hear the arguments of
the underclassmen.
