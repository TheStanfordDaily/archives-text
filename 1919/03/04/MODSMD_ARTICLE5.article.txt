# CALIFORNIA MEETS STANFORD FRIDAY ON SOCCER FIELD
## 
### 
A return game between the Stanford
and Blue and Gold soccer hooters is
scheduled for next Friday afternoon at
the "up hay" university. Daily workouts
are putting the locals fairly on their feet.
With the speed that they displayed last
week, they should treat the California
hoys to a severe drubbing in the second
game of the series.
The farm team is at a disadvantage to
battle with its old opponents due to the
injury sustained by Captain Drury in last
week's game. Drury had been playing
forward center and was the bulwark of
the team. It is not expected that he will
be able to play in Friday's game, and
Strauss will likely take his place. At the
present time the left wing of the lineup
is weak, though it has come through
considerably better in the last two prac
tice games. Green and Pillsbury, play
ing forward, are improving and will
give the locals a good bout in the next
game.
The Stanford record-breakers will
show the Berkeley team just about where
it stands. In last week's game, Ankle
smidt. who is the Bay college star, ran
right through the locals and easily put
the ball in the coop. In the coming game
the locals will greatly strengthen their
defensive and the goals for the farm's
opponents will not be so nicely made.
The game will be called at the Berke
ley soccer held at 4 o'clock on Friday.
