# 1921 Play Is Excellent-Mathieu
## 
### 
Frank Mathieu, who is coaching the
cast of "His Majesty Bunker Bean" for
its presentation at the Assembly Hall
next Friday evening, lias reported that
he has unearthed some very promising
dramatic talent in the sophomore class.
According to him, the 1921 play, com
bining a clever comedy and a well
trained cast, should prove irresistible as
a fun-maker.
"Bunker Bean" is perhaps the most
famous of Harry Leon Wilson's many
books. It appeared serially in the Satur
day Evening Post a few years ago and
lias been since dramatized and played
with enormous success throughout the
country. Its main theme, that of the
influence of an Egyptian mummy com
ing down through the shades of time, on
the love affairs of a modern broker's
stenographer, is amplified by many
unique situations.
Coincident with the fact that the plot
of "His Majesty Bunker Bean" concerns
itself with a sarcophagus beneath a mul
berry tree on the banks of the Nile, the
world's greatest left-handed baseball
pitcher makes his appearance in the
story. Arthur Townsend plays this part
of "Bud Mathews," the great ball player.
The title role is taken by Floyd Mc-
Elroy. Miss Dorothy Johnston plays op
posite him in the part of the "Mapper."
Seats for the 1921 production are ob
tainable at the Bookstore and Crandall's
in Palo Alto. The management has an

tiounced that there are many good seats
left in spite of the large sale following
the drawings Friday.


Miss Dorothy Johnston, '21, who
takes the clever part of Marie "His
Majesty Bunker Bean," which will be
produced at the Assembly Hall next
Friday evening.
