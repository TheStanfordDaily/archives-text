l ' lc lirst ste P correction is criticism, as indicative
|^^^yi|Jn of interest, there is constantly a plea for public ex-
MT pression of public approbation or discontent. It is continually pointed
out that there are things in the student organization that need cor
rection; if criticism will in any way lead to correction, let us then have criticism.
There are all types of criticism, some desirable, and some undesirable; but crit
icism with a good purpose and beneficial object is always wanted and needed.
In making a plea, monotonous as it is now becoming, for student interest in
student affairs, we cannot overlook the fact that student interest finds expression
largely through verbal and written criticism. In an endeavor to nurse a little
interest in Stanford affairs, the Daily desires to make public at least one of its
columns to any articles upon matters of average interest that any one with some
thing worth while to say may use. The authors of articles will, if so desired, be
kept behind the protection of the press, but it is essential for the safety and well
being of the editorial authorities that the writer be known at least, even if he pre
fers to keep his name unwritten.
In endeavoring to obtain a bit of public expression and criticism let us be
thoroughly understood. This is not an appeal for the development of a play
ground in the public eye for ardent Bolshevists, or radical and inspired young
demagogues; we do not either desire long and tiresome articles upon ideals and
duties of which we may all be aware; we need, and we feel that the student body
wants, expression of opinion upon subjects of interest and importance to us, small
as they may be to an outsider. We would value faculty opinion expressed through
our columns or other medium, since we always have felt ourselves at times too
far removed from the faculty to impress them with our presence.
In concluding a call for a reawakened and re-expressed criticism, let us urge
upon readers, and other targets of criticism, that they take it in the light that it
is sent; every man is entitled to an opinion, even strangely if it be in a university,
and providing that opinion is not offensive in its nature, it should be accepted as
the sincere and earnest opinion of a person who has taken the time to think, and
who possesses the liberty of expressing bis thought.
Let us have criticism, for this means interest. Let us receive and take this
criticism in the light that it is sent; let us realize that the college man has a right
to think, and that this right is not limited alone to simple thought, but to the writ
ten and oral expression of such thought.
