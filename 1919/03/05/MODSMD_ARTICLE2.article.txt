# VARSITY CREW NEEDS MORE SHELL MATERIAL
## "Les" Rogers Wants Greater Support of the 1919 Crew 
### 
"Crew must be supported by the stu
dent body, both financially and by more
men reporting for practice," said "Les"
Rogers, coach of the 1919 Stanford
shells.
Rogers stated this morning that a
number of men answered the call of
Captain Watts for more varsity shell
material yesterday. It is thought that
several of these new men will develop
into possible material for the eight, but
more men are needed, if Stanford is to
have her usual strong team. At least
twenty-five new men are wanted to re-
port fur tlie varsity shell practice before
the end of the present week.
Practice will start with the eight-men
shells, at the Redwood City estuary, the
week after the final examinations. Cap
tain Watts 'wants all the prospective
crew men to report immediately, in or
der that they may he sufficiently used to
the water before venturing on the bay.
Workouts in the two- and four-men
shells will continue on the Lagtinita lake
until Saturday. March 15. There will be
no crew practice during the entire final
examination week.
All outstanding crew funds must be
turned in to "Lis" Rogers this week, in
order that the committee on tin- crew
fund may get definite figures to work
upon. There are a large number of the
living groups, that still have -"in money
to turn into the fund. Rogers also
wants all of the members of the cri w
fund committee to report their collec
tions to him, within the next two (lays.
At present there is ,v5O in tin fund. It
has not. however, reached the mark set
as tin necessary running expenses for
this year's crew. The SI.IHHI mark must
be raisud before March 23, when tin
training at Redwood City commences.

According to advices received from
the University of California, Washing
ton has offered to send a crew down for
a triangle meet with California and
Stanford. The Purple and Cold will
agree to pay all expenses if the two
universities will give them a return race
next year at Washington.
If the Moating Association can put the
sport on a firm enough financial basis
this year. California is confident that,
as far as they are concerned, arrange
ments can be made for the meet. They
are now awaiting the decision of Stan
ford.
