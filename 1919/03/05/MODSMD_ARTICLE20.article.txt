### C.E.R., '20 
"Feg" Murray lias been giving the
sprinters practice in starting. It reminds
us of old times when "Feg" steps out in
front of the hoys in a practice 50-yard
race.

Ken Lilly will hoost the hitting
strength of the ball cidb. Now that
basketball is over, "Ken" will probably
be out for the old job in centerfield.

A prospective outfielder was tearing
back for a long fly. As he looked over
his shoulder, his feet slid out from under
and he sat down at the same time the
ball hit his glove. lie was so surprised
that he forgot to hold on to it. "Not
so bad," Coach Evans was heard- to re
mark. "He knew when to stop, any
way."
******
Sam, the genial caretaker of Stan
ford's football field, diamond, track, etc.,
lias a new job. He is doing a little
spring plowing 011 the , inside of the
track. By putting in a layer of saw
dust and cinders the track will have
some spring to it, thereby eliminating
the usual crop of shin-splints.

If the soccer game here Saturday is
a criterion of what the next game at
California is to be like, a couple of am
bulances at the field would be a good
idea. Pillsburv, Brill and Drury were
all on the injured list.
