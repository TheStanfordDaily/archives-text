# EMERSON PICTURED IN UNIQUE TALK BY DR. J. WOODBURY
## 
### 
Dr. Charles J. Woodbury, in his
friendly reminiscences and charming
i and sympathetic talk on Emerson and.
the Concord school in its glory, last
night at the Little Theater, did much to
! bring these great Americans out of the
! vista of unreality into which they are
wen so soon receding.' Mr. Woodbury
' sinned to represent Emerson and the
group of which Emerson was a part. In
the real picture he painted of this tall
! essayist, the speaker did not place him
- on a pedestal, but showed him as he was
I— a man.
I For many years Dr. Woodbury was a
| close personal friend of Emerson, and
lie had a chance to know him us 110 other
living man could know him. He de
scribed the essayist as a quiet.old gen
jtlcman, with a cordial greeting for
everyone, despite the fact that he hated
! callers, with whom he was overrun. He
was pictured as tall and spare, with
i shrewd introspective eyes. "But what
won you to the man was the voice," said
tile speaker, "for what Emerson said he
made live. This strong persuasive voice
carried the speaker's spirit in it, although
he had not one of the tricks that orators
hold dear." The lecturer told how Emer
son read his essays before an audience.
He was gestureless, motionless, his voice
never fell at a period, and he never
looked at his audience. "But," said Dr.
Woodbury, "his audiences soon forgot
his lack of oratory in the solicitations of
his sentences. He was one of that time
less group of whom there have been but
eight or ten since the world began."
The lecturer said that Emerson was
always prompt to keep an appointment
The first appointment to go for a walk
'that Dr. Woodbury had with him, he
j found Emerson with his coat and hat on
waiting for him. although lie was exact
ly punctual. The speaker said further
that he had never known Mr. Emerson
!to be one minute late. Emerson told
him one day that he could not be late,
' because of his "respect for man as man."
From picturing Emerson, the lecturer
turned to Thoroe. "If," said Dr. Wood
bury. "Emerson was wintergreen flavor,
Thoroe was cranberry. His redeeming
feature was his eyes. His fault was he
kept everything at a distance, for he be
lived all society diseased. Nevertheless,
, no keener observer of external nature
| ever lived than Henry Thoroe. He had
j the trained sense of the Indian."
i Dr. Woodbury last brought before the
audience the characters and lives of the
Alcott family. He explained some of
the great difficulties that Louisa worked
under, and how she worked to accom
-1 plish what she did.
"California has the most stupendous
scenery on the American continent, but
it lacks the historic touch that the scen
ery of Concord possesses by the trans
formation of those who have gone be
fore," said the speaker. He told how
the home of Louisa Alcott in Concord
has been purchased and restored exactly,
j Emerson's home has been opened to the
public, having been sold to the Pittsbury
railroad.

lie had a chance to know him us 110 other
living man could know him. He de
scribed the essayist as a quiet.old gen
jtlcman, with a cordial greeting for
everyone, despite the fact that he hated
! callers, with whom he was overrun. He
was pictured as tall and spare, with
i shrewd introspective eyes. "But what
won you to the man was the voice," said
tile speaker, "for what Emerson said he
made live. This strong persuasive voice
carried the speaker's spirit in it, although
he had not one of the tricks that orators
hold dear." The lecturer told how Emer
son read his essays before an audience.
He was gestureless, motionless, his voice
never fell at a period, and he never
looked at his audience. "But," said Dr.
Woodbury, "his audiences soon forgot
his lack of oratory in the solicitations of
his sentences. He was one of that time
less group of whom there have been but
eight or ten since the world began."
The lecturer said that Emerson was
always prompt to keep an appointment
The first appointment to go for a walk
'that Dr. Woodbury had with him, he
j found Emerson with his coat and hat on
waiting for him. although lie was exact
ly punctual. The speaker said further
that he had never known Mr. Emerson
!to be one minute late. Emerson told
him one day that he could not be late,
' because of his "respect for man as man."
From picturing Emerson, the lecturer
turned to Thoroe. "If," said Dr. Wood
bury. "Emerson was wintergreen flavor,
Thoroe was cranberry. His redeeming
feature was his eyes. His fault was he
kept everything at a distance, for he be
lived all society diseased. Nevertheless,
, no keener observer of external nature
| ever lived than Henry Thoroe. He had
j the trained sense of the Indian."
i Dr. Woodbury last brought before the
audience the characters and lives of the
Alcott family. He explained some of
the great difficulties that Louisa worked
under, and how she worked to accom
-1 plish what she did.
"California has the most stupendous
scenery on the American continent, but
it lacks the historic touch that the scen
ery of Concord possesses by the trans
formation of those who have gone be
fore," said the speaker. He told how
the home of Louisa Alcott in Concord
has been purchased and restored exactly,
j Emerson's home has been opened to the
public, having been sold to the Pittsbury
railroad.
Dr. Charles J. Woodbury, in his
friendly reminiscences and charming
i and sympathetic talk on Emerson and.
the Concord school in its glory, last
night at the Little Theater, did much to
! bring these great Americans out of the
! vista of unreality into which they are
wen so soon receding.' Mr. Woodbury
' sinned to represent Emerson and the
group of which Emerson was a part. In
the real picture he painted of this tall
! essayist, the speaker did not place him
- on a pedestal, but showed him as he was
I— a man.
