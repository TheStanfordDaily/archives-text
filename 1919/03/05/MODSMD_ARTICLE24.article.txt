1 lie Daily Palo Alto, Stanford Univer
sity.
Gentlemen: Even history should he
corrected sometimes, while yet there is
time.
in the flat-car episode of 1891, the car,
with some twenty boys, ran down to the
main line at Mayfield (there was no
Palo Alto). The culprits were picked
out by the keen-eyed Master of Encina
(Bert Fesler) by their guilty looks next
morning, and turned over for reprimand
to the proper committee.
Governor Stanford was somewhat
worried over the possibility of such a
prank being on a train wreck. It is not
true, however, that he asked to have the
boys punished nor that Mrs. Stanford
interceded for them. It was not the pol
icy of either to make suggestions in mat
ters of University discipline.
Yours truly.
