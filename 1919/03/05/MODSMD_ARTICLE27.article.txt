The Boston Herald, in a review of
American educational institutions in
1 ill 4, printed the following of Stan
ford University:
"Eastern people have no idea what
a 'howling' little atmosphere the
young university lias acquired in its
brief existence; it dons not rival that
of Harvard's 2F>S years of cultured ex
istence, but it is ventable, it is there
to stand, it is of the right sort. Stan
ford claims, as does every other col
lege in the country, to be the most
democratic, in the best way, and while
easterners who imagine it placed in a
wild wilderness are apt to think this
necessary, it is preference which su
perintends this state of things. Mid
way between Menlo Park, which con
sists of large estates and is too tony
on the one hand, and Maylield, which
is inhabited largely by 'signoritas' on
the other, is growing up the charming
middle-class typical college town,
Palo Alto. It will hereafter acquire
importance to the university by being
the residence place of the students."

Hard Times
The "hard time" period is one that
will long be remembered by students
and faculty here at that time. The
crisis was brought on by the famous
suit of the federal government against
the Stanford estate, in l«S!). r >, for the
sum of $15,000,000. If it had not have
been for the heroic efforts of Mrs.
Stanford, who defrayed the expenses
ol' the University, the doors of the
University would have been closed.
To what sacrifices Mrs. Stanford
had to go may be gathered from an
interview which took place at her
home at the Palo Alto estate.

"1 saw in one of the papers yester
day," said Mrs. Stanford, "that I was
giving the University $1000 a day. I
am not. I haven't that much money in
the world. If 1 had I should not give
i! now, for I do not believe in extrav
agance. The University costs just
$15,000 a month.
"Yes, 1 am furnishing that money.
I must furnish it —I can not let the
University close. It would kill me to
.-tee those doors shut. Why, that is all
I have to live for. I must keep it
open. I do not know what I should
do if it were not for my boys. They
come to see me and they are not
afraid to ask me for anything. They
know that I will do anything that 1
can for them. You know I did not let
them know at first how little money I
really have or what a struggle it was
to keep things going, but it had to
come out."
Mrs. Stanford signed over most of
her property to the University and
spoke of herself as the steward. She
discharged over half of her servants,
closed her town house and sold her
personal horses and carriages, in or
der to save money.
"I don't own a stick of furniture in
this house," she said. "Every chair,
every picture, every carpet in it be
longs to the state for the University.
I am glad that I have given them
away, for it will help the University
when I am gone."
After many trying months the suit
was decided in favor of the Stanford
estate by Judge Ross of the United
States circuit court. There was great
rejoicing over the victory on the cam
pus and in Palo Alto. It was generally
felt that the University had been
saved to the people of California.

Hard Times
The "hard time" period is one that
will long be remembered by students
and faculty here at that time. The
crisis was brought on by the famous
suit of the federal government against
the Stanford estate, in l«S!). r >, for the
sum of $15,000,000. If it had not have
been for the heroic efforts of Mrs.
Stanford, who defrayed the expenses
ol' the University, the doors of the
University would have been closed.
To what sacrifices Mrs. Stanford
had to go may be gathered from an
interview which took place at her
home at the Palo Alto estate.

"1 saw in one of the papers yester
day," said Mrs. Stanford, "that I was
giving the University $1000 a day. I
am not. I haven't that much money in
the world. If 1 had I should not give
i! now, for I do not believe in extrav
agance. The University costs just
$15,000 a month.
"Yes, 1 am furnishing that money.
I must furnish it —I can not let the
University close. It would kill me to
.-tee those doors shut. Why, that is all
I have to live for. I must keep it
open. I do not know what I should
do if it were not for my boys. They
come to see me and they are not
afraid to ask me for anything. They
know that I will do anything that 1
can for them. You know I did not let
them know at first how little money I
really have or what a struggle it was
to keep things going, but it had to
come out."
Mrs. Stanford signed over most of
her property to the University and
spoke of herself as the steward. She
discharged over half of her servants,
closed her town house and sold her
personal horses and carriages, in or
der to save money.
"I don't own a stick of furniture in
this house," she said. "Every chair,
every picture, every carpet in it be
longs to the state for the University.
I am glad that I have given them
away, for it will help the University
when I am gone."
After many trying months the suit
was decided in favor of the Stanford
estate by Judge Ross of the United
States circuit court. There was great
rejoicing over the victory on the cam
pus and in Palo Alto. It was generally
felt that the University had been
saved to the people of California.
