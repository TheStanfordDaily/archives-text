# CRYSTAL-GAZING COUNTESS FIGURES IN BUNKER BEAN
## 
### 
"His Majesty Bunker Bean's" second
act takes place in the shrine of the
Countess Cassanova, a spiritual medium.
Miss Inez Wood will play this part of
the crystal-gazing -countess in the sopho
more play next Friday night.
"Bunker Bean," played by Floyd Mc-
Elroy, visits this worthy soothsayess
and learns much concerning his former
existences. "Bean" had a very check
ered career in the past and the Countess
Cassanova allows him to select a suit
able reincarnated self from a wide as
sortment of great men ranging from
Napoleon to Alexander the Great. He
finally settles on Rum-Tali, a ruler of
ancient Egypt. Immediately the influ
ence of this age-old Egyptian exerts it
self on the modern "Bunker."
The 1921 class seem to have been very
fortunate in selecting this comedy of
Harry Leon Wilson's for the annual
sophomore play. Although it has been
played professionally with great success,
it is exceptionally suited to amateur
production. Tickets are on sale at the
Bookstore and Crandall's in Palo Alto
