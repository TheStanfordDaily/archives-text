# Advertisement Brings Results

Dear Editor of the D. P. A.:
1 saw an advertisement in your paper
that the sophomores wanted a mummy to
sit under a mulberry tree. The ad also
said that the part didn't require any
brains. Now the part of sitting under
a tree sounded good, and when they
said "no brains needed" I knew that they
wanted me especially.
Well. I went down to the play rehears
als, and after T had' looked around for
a while, someone came up to me and
said, "Whadda you want around here?"
•"Well," says 1, "I want the job of
being an Egyptian mummy in your
show."
"All right," says he, and he takes me
over in one corner and wraps me up in
a lot of bandages. T didn't mind that
much, except that it was awful hot. But
when they put me in a big box that
looked like a coffin (they told me that
it was only a sarcophagus) T began to
feel funny, but I let them crate me.
Everything went O. K. until I found
out that I lost my head in the third act.
I was going to leave right off, only they
told me that the way I lost it was a
trick.
Now. Sir Editor. I want to thank you
for your part in giving me a chance to
be an Egyptian mummy.
Yours truly,
JOE STARCH.
P. S.—You may use any of my re
marks for advertising purposes.
JOE.
