# COMMITTEE ON STUDENT AFFAIRS TAKES ACTION
## FORTY-THREE SUSPENDED Four Houses Reprimanded as a Result of Parade 
### 
A careful investigation has been
made by the Student Affairs Com
mittee of certain features of the
recent freshman fraternity parade
that were of such a character as
to warrant summary dismissal from
the University of all participants.
It has been decided to modify the
discipline originally planned be
cause of the wholesome spirit that
has been reawakened in the fra
ternities and only to suspend until
next fall forty-three men whose
conduct can under no circum
stances be overlooked by the Uni
versity. Some of the other partic
ipants and four fraternity groups
have been reprimanded by the
president.
This parade was the final culmi
nation of a false sense of tradition,
together with abuses that have
sprung up in groups that have lost
a large proportion of their upper
class leaders because of the war.
With reforms that are now being
discussed and will soon be inaugur
ated we look to a fine growth of
sentiment and idealism in the stu
dent body and to a condition of
affairs that will make such an in
cident impossible in the future.

The above statement by Dr. Wilbur,
issued from the President's office at
noon today, sums up the action taken
