# COMMITTEE ON STUDENT AFFAIRS TAKES ACTION
## FORTY-THREE SUSPENDED Four Houses Reprimanded as a Result of Parade 
### 
A careful investigation has been
made by the Student Affairs Com
mittee of certain features of the
recent freshman fraternity parade
that were of such a character as
to warrant summary dismissal from
the University of all participants.
It has been decided to modify the
discipline originally planned be
cause of the wholesome spirit that
has been reawakened in the fra
ternities and only to suspend until
next fall forty-three men whose
conduct can under no circum
stances be overlooked by the Uni
versity. Some of the other partic
ipants and four fraternity groups
have been reprimanded by the
president.
This parade was the final culmi
nation of a false sense of tradition,
together with abuses that have
sprung up in groups that have lost
a large proportion of their upper
class leaders because of the war.
With reforms that are now being
discussed and will soon be inaugur
ated we look to a fine growth of
sentiment and idealism in the stu
dent body and to a condition of
affairs that will make such an in
cident impossible in the future.

The above statement by Dr. Wilbur,
issued from the President's office at
noon today, sums up the action taken
by the Faculty Student Affairs Commit
tee in its deliberations of the past week
and a half. The committee undertook
a thorough investigation of the affair of
Washington's Birthday and reached its
conclusion after thorough investigation
of evidence and facts.
Campus and alumni opinion has been
reaching the committee since it first met,
some in advocation of sterner measures
and others in support of less rigid disci
pline. The action taken by the commit
tee has been supported by the President
and is made the basis of his announced
intention of constructing for the future.
Dr. Wilbur points out that the action
was more modified than at first planned
and the result of wholesome reawaken
ing of a constructive spirit on the cam
pus. The suspension of forty-three un
derclassmen and the reprimanding of
certain groups and upperclasstnen was
the extent of the drastic acti<ui of the
committee. No men were expelled.
Dr. Wilbur emphasizes that the action
of the committee was an action for the
future welfare of the University, at the
same time that it ought to eliminate J
completely the unfortunate affair of the'
past.
