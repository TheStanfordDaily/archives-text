# JUNIOR SECTION OF QUAD IS COMPLETED
## 1920 Pictures in Year-Book Are Much Larger Than Previous Cuts 
### 
Over 200 pictures are now completed
in the nearly finished junior section of
the 1920 Quad, which makes that sec
tion one of the largest in the yearbook,
and probably gives it more space than
has heretofore been devoted to a junior
class.
The photographs arc to be consider
ably larger than they were last year,
showing less background and more of
the person. What background there is
will be of oxford grey. Little will be
shown except the face, and nothing be
low the collar will be visible.
Due to the revival and activity of
numerous campus honor societies and
organizations which were suspended for
the war period, the Quad section deal
ing with them will be another big feat
ure of the book. Providing all these
societies take space, the management
states that this department will be com
parable in size to that section in the
1918 Quad, and infinitely larger than
that of 1919.
