# CONDEMNED AND CLOSED

### 
was fitting a week and a half ago to consider the unfor
tunate Washington's Birthday parade as a condemned and
B closed affair, it is fitting to repeat today, after Dr. Wilbur's
statement of the Faculty Student Affairs Committee action upon
-— the parade incident, "Condemned and Closed.
We do not care to discuss editorially whether or not the action of the
committee was lenient or harsh, just or unjust, in relation to the fraternity
freshmen who are to be temporarily suspended. Let us examine the action
only in the light of its relation to student sentiment and to the future.
We cannot help but note, however, that the action was the most stringent
in the history of the University. Forty-three suspensions are two more than
the loss in 1908, hitherto the maximum of stringency.
As regards student sentiment, the Daily sought to impress upon the minds
of the Faculty Committee that expulsion was not wanted by the student body;
that the responsibility was too divided to be fixed and that the remedy had
already been found by the student body. The last suggestion was completely
overthrown by the action of the committee. In regard to the other two sug
gestions, the question is presented as to whether or not suspension is really
a modified form of expulsion. It is difficult to determine therefore whether
the action was in accord with student sentiment.
There is, however, one basis upon which to consider the action of the
Faculty Committee and Dr. Wilbur's subsequent statement thereon, that is
its relation to the future. It has always been our contention that such reme
dial action should be made as would eventually work for a benefit.
While part of the action of the council may not be applauded in its
stringency, still the statement of Dr. Wilbur points towards something big
in the future.
The president of the University has come out openly with awakened con
fidence in the student body. Awakened confidence means successful effort in
student body activities rightly conducted in the right direction.
We may like the action of the Faculty Committee or we may not; but
the action has been taken, if it is unfortunate, we can at best be sorry; if it
is correct, there is much to be happy over. The judgment upon it rests with
individuals.
Let us consider the incident condemned and closed, let us bury the Wash
ington's Birthday hatchet.
