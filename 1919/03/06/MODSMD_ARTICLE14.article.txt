jlißWjn t.oday's issue of the Daily Palo Alto, readjustment of
Irer the stall' of the paper is announced. The Daily is to
,~^W:' %•' ... I return to the class system of rating of the reporters and news
editors; the leaders in each class being grouped on the staff ac
cording to their rank in relation to others in their same class. In judgment
of the rating of the staff, therefore, consideration need only be taken of the
individual's position in relation to others of his or her year in college.
It is the additional pleasure incumbent upon today's issue to note the
appointment of J. E. Thrash, '21, to the position of news editor; he has
worked up to that position since the reportorial tryouts of his freshman year.
Ti. W. Kenny, '21, and E. E. Crowe, '21, have both demonstrated their fitness
to the other news editor's position now open on the staff. They are to be
made associate news editors until such time when either one or the other
or possibly both can be selected for the news editor's position. Miss Ellen
Calhoun, '20, has demonstrated her right to be considered the ranking mem
ber of the reportorial staff, having merited this through displayed marked
talent and ability in covering her assignments.
