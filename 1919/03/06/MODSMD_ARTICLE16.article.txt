To the Editor of the Daily Palo Alto:
Dear Sir: I recently noticed in your
columns a brief and unconspicuous an
nouncement to the effect that the regu
lations in regard to women's conduct
which were made upon the advent of
Camp Fremont to the community are to
remain in force.
Although the action to which I refer
was treated as a story of little news
value, and although it received no edi
torial comment, it appears to me to be
most significant. The permanent in
graftation of the restrictions which this
action imposes upon Stanford
means one more step in the direction
of that unreasoning and unyielding con
servatism toward which Stanford stu
dents have been unwillingly moved in
the last few years.
Yet not a protest has been uttered,' —
possibly because students are indiffer
ent as to this action, but probably be
cause so many of them feel that the
result of the use of an open forum would
mean more conservatism in the way
of depleting their ranks. Such is the
power of the powers that be!
Presumably the regulations which
were made when the soldier element
entered the community were expressly
to protect Stanford women from possi
ble advances which might offend them.
There must also be some definite pur
pose for permanently retaining these
rules, now that there is nothing to be
feared from the men who were sta
tioned at Camp Fremont.
It is the unexpected motive which 1
am seeking to determine. Can it be that
tlu authors of the restrictions and of
the action for their retention believe
that in the last year and a half Stan
ford men have deteriorated to such a
point that the women must be protected
from them in the same way as they were
from the lower element of drafted army
men? Can it be that these authors hid
behind the- possibility of offense from
the soldiers in order to impose restric
tions for which they were not willing to
take the entire responsibility?
Whatever the motive, it is certain that
this action lias made Stanford just so
much more narrow and conservative,
contrary to the ideals which it sup
posedly supports, —democracy and liber
ality
An editorial or discussion through
your columns on this subject would be
much appreciated
Yours very truly,
A Stanford Student.
