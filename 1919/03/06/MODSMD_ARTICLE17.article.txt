Gene Schnell is out on the track get
ting in shape for the spring meets.
Schnell won the half against Califor
nia both in the 191G and 1917 meets.
Although he will not be eligible for
the big meet, he will probably run for
the Olympic Club and should make
Captain Teitsworth and the other 880-
yard men step to beat him.
******
"Lil Reginald" Caughey, as the San
Francisco papers call him, is greatly
worried over the shining orb he got
out of Saturday night's basketball
game. The memory lingers. How
ever, the shot traveled out about forty
five feet today in practice, so he
should worry.
*******
Bacon looks like a possibility in the
hammer throw this year. He is a
hard worker and with a little coaching
should get into the money.
*******
As in former years, the quarter
promises to be close the whole dis
tance. California is banking heavily
on Goeppert to win, but those who
have seen Maynard do close to 50
flat, believe he will lead the Blue and
Gold sprinter to the tape.
