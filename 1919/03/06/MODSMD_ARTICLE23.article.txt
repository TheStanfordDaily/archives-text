# UNDERCLASSMEN WILL MEET IN ARGUMENT
## Freshmen Are Prepared for Brain Clash Tonight With Sophomores 
### 
J. G. Driscoll, Jr., '18, has been
secured to preside over the annual clash
of brains which the freshmen and
sophomores will have in the Little
I heater tonight. Driscoll is one of
Stanford's foremost debators, having
represented the university in many inter
collegiate contests and having won the
coveted JofTre medal last year. The
fact that he will officiate is considered a
valuable addition to tonight's event.
The freshman team is composed of
A. Garrett, S. G. Trimble, and L. W.
Gerson. The committee on debating
for the class of '22 believes that in these
three men they have a trio that will
avenge in a measure certain sufferings
and oppression to which for a year they
have been forced to acquiesce at the
hands of '21. They point out that the
present contest, however, is one of
brains alone, and that they will there
fore be able to make the geratest show
ing of year for the freshmen class
tonight. On the other hand R. T.
Cowell, Miss Dorothy Webster and
L. \\. 1 lodges, debaters of experience,
will be on hand to establish the posi
tion of the sophomores.
