# PLANS PROGRESSING ON FOUNDERS' DAY DINNER AND PROGRAM
## 
### 
Plans for the Founders' Day celebra
tion are progressing rapidly and all but
the final arrangements have been made
by the committee in charge. According
to the present plan, the committee in
charge aims to make the affair as simple
as possible because of the strain under
which the University has been working
since the influenza epidemic.
The annual Pounders' Day banquet
will be held Saturday evening at 6:30 in
the mess hall. A special program has
been arranged and toasts will be given
by prominent alumni. The dinner will
be 50 cents a plate.
Sunday evening the formal exercises
will be held in the Memorial Church, at
which Chancellor Emeritus David Starr
Jordan and Bishop Paige will be the
speakers of the evening. Special music
has been arranged for by Professor L.
E. Hassett, chairman of the public exer
cises committee, and the church choir
will render an anthem. All are cordially
welcome to the service.
