# UNIVERSITY ASSEMBLY WILL HEAR BONNET IN RECITAL
## WILL PLAY IN CHAPEL Noted Organist Has Caused Sensation in Musical Circles in East 
### 
Tomorrow morning at 11 o'clock the
University assembly will feature Jo
seph Bonnet, the celebrated French
organist, in a recital in the Memorial
Church. Mr. Bonnet is considered the
finest living organist of the French
nation today, a statement amply sub
stantiated by the fact that he was
asked to take the place of Guilamont
in the Paris Conservatory of Music at
the time of that famous organist's
death. As a musical treat, the Uni
versity assembly should prove one of
the most interesting affairs of the
university year.
Mr. Bonnet is famed for his remark
able memory and his great versatility
in the kind of music he plays. His
sympathetic interpretation of music
which heretofore has been considered
too subtle in shading and technique
for the organ, has been played in the
east by Mr. Bonnet with the greatest
success. Mr. Bonnet has marked a
new epoch in a distinct revival of in
terest in organ recitals, both in Eu
rope and in the United States.
Mr. Bonnet has selected a particu
larly interesting- program for the as-
sembly tomorrow, covering a wide
range in choice, and most of the num
bers have a distinct popular interest.
The Memorial Church organ is con
sidered one of the finest organs in the
country and with such an instrument
to play upon, Mr. Bonnet's recital
should prove more than interesting.
