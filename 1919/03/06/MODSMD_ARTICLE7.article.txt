# Cardinal to Meet Bruins in Soccer
## Contest to Be Staged at Berkeley Tomorrow is Second of Series 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon the local soccer
players will journey to the Berkeley
field, where they will meet their old riv
als, the Bruins. The game is the second
of the scries and will be a speedy affair.
The Cardinals are looking with deter
mination at the long end of the score.
California showed up well last week,
due in a large degree to their constant
training. Their team was also strength
ened by work of the "up bay" star, An
klesmidt, who played a fast game in
center.
Stanford, though somewhat weakened
by the loss of Drury in the early part
of last Saturday's game, put up a con
sistent fight. With the work of the lo
cal captain, the farm team would have
easily carried off the honors of the day.
Drury has recovered from his injury
last week and will be on tomorrow's
lineup. With favorable weather condi
tions, the locals will in all events bury
the Blue and Gold ruggers in their own
field.
The lineup for the game will be as
follows:
Esgen, lw.; Martin, rw.; Tom Green,
If.; Strauss, rf.; Drury, center; Metcaif,
Pillsbury, crouch, Brill, centers; Finley,
1. fullback; Gould, r. fullback; Boyle,
goal. Substitutes, Meyer, Rotner, and
Sturgeon.
