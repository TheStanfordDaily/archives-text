# ORGAN RECITAL GIVEN BY JOSEPH BONNET
## Noted Musician Plays Before University Assembly This Morning 
### 
Joseph Bonnet scored a distinct suc
cess at the student assembly held this
morning in Memorial Church. His
program was varied and the organist
was given the opportunity to display
his remarkable powers of interpreta
tion which certainly came up to the
expectations of the most critical. Bon
net's technique is deceiving in the
facility with which he renders the
most difficult passages, and his shad
ing and variation in tone lent his
playing a color which is seldom found
in the organ.
Bach, Purcell, Clerambault, and N.
de Grigny were used for the first half
of the program, representing the
standard and more classical selections
of organ literature. Of these, perhaps
the most pleasing selection was that
of Clerambault's Prelude, which was
distinguished by the charming grace
of its running melody and bell-like
tones of the delicate theme.
he Bach Prelude and Fugue in I>
minor is considered one of the most
difficult compositions that has ever
been written for the organ and of the
out ire program this number furnished
the keenest interest to those who un
derstand and appreciate the technique
and scholarly side of organ music. In
this same connection the last num
ber of the program might be men
tioned which was composed by Bon
net himself.
The last half of the program was
devoted to the more modern com
posers. Alexandre Guilmant's sonata
was an exquisite example of the com
bination of the classic and lyric in
which a great variety of tone and in
terpretation were the predominate
features.
