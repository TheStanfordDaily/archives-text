# THE 						RIGHT WAY

### 
: ¥ assumption that there is always more than one way of
doing anything is counterbalanced by the infinitely more
11, \ reasonable assertion that after all there is usually but one way of
doing things to get the desired result. That is, the right way. The
student body of Stanford University is awakening to the fact that there are
many things to be done; they must also wake to the fact that there is but
one way to do them; that is, the right way.
The upperclass meeting of last evening brought out a few of the matters
of interest that now confront the student body, and that will in the future
confront the student body. Student control, student government, enthusiasm
for athletics, proper presentation of a student viewpoint to the faculty and
other problems are all only capable of a successful solution if handled in the
correct way.
If the students object to any attitude by the faculty or faculty committees
it is up to the students to prove the supremacy of their viewpoint to that of
the faculty aspect. This can only be accomplished If handled in the correct
way, What then is the correct way of handling this and other problems?
Useless and senseless agitation without head or purpose is not the right
way. A common purpose upon a firm and sane basis is the foundation for
the settlement of all of our problems. Once this common purpose has been
found, public interest muot ho printed; public interest is expressed through
enthusiasm, criticism, not necessarily agitation. The quiet workers in the
student body, the leaders of student opinion are confronted with this task
of creating interest and enthusiasm in the proper solution of the problems
of the student body.
If we are confronted with a problem now, let us apply the right way to
solve it; if we are confronted with problems In the future, let us apply the
right way for their solution.
But let us remember that it is enthusiasm not agitation, reason not un
thinking rashness, quiet workers not soap-box orators, public interest not
group desires that comprise the right way for the ultimate successful solution
of our problems.
