# TRACK MEN MEET ON CINDERS TOMORROW
## Will Hold Irish Marathon on Next Saturday Morning 
### 
Track candidates will again demon
strate their wares when they meet on
the oval tomorrow for the third in
formal meet of the season. All events
will be lengthened to the usual dis
tances except the hurdles, and com
petition is expected to be keener than
in the past two weeks.
('aj)tain Teitaworth has issued a call
for every track candidate to be pres
ent tomorrow. The possibility of a
trip to Southern California during
spring vacation has not entirely van
ished and it will be necessary for
every man to get out every day in
order to be in condition if this meet
is arranged. Men will be selected
from these tryouts for the southern
meet, if it is held.
Marathon Next Saturday
The annual Irish marathon will be
held next' Saturday, and class captains
are keeping their eyes open in an
effort to select the twentv-five best
quarter-milers in their class. Juniors
and seniors will not combine this year
as they did last, but will enter sep
arate class teams. "Peg" Murray has
been declared eligible for the mara
thon and will run with the team need
ing him most.
From the present outlook the soph
oruores and juniors should have the
strongest teams. The present junior
class won the marathon last year.
The meet tomorrow will be called
at 2:15 unless there is a baseball
game here in the afternoon. In that
case it will begin about an hour
earlier.
