# STANFORD RIFLE MEN ORGANIZE FOR MEET
## 
### 
A rifle club has been formed at the
University under the supervision of
Captain Samuel M. Parker. The fol
lowing officers were elected at the
first meeting, held March 5: Presi
dent, W. C. Pundenberg, '18; vice
president, Max Steinike, '21; secre
tary, E, D. Barton, '20; treasurer, Ray
Ground, '20.
The object of the club is to develop
a team of riflemen to meet California
in the near future. The Bruins al
ready have an excellent association ot
expert shots who are desirous of meet
ing the Cardinal. The Stanford ag
gregation includes among its number
several ex-lieutenants who wear the
highest medals conferred by the gov
ernment for good shooting, as well as
members who have distinguished
themselves in other ways, as Steinike,
who won top place in range competi
tion with 1,000 men at the first Pre
sidio R. O. T. C. camp.
With Captain Parker as its head
and instructor, the club is expected
to form a first-class team, as he him
self wears several decorations of high
character, and his ability to lead and
teach his men is well recognized.
