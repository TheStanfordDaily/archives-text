# Excess of Funds Endangers Life of Quad's Co-Manager
## 
### 
J. T. Murphy, *20, co-manager of the
1920 Quad, engaged in financial business
for the year-hook, was yesterday skid
ding along the highway and in a driz
zling rain. When traveling at the in
tensive speed necessary in carrying a
Quad agent on collections, the staff Lo
comobile overturned and pinned the
manager and his companion in the mud
and mire beneath it.
For some time they struggled for free
dom, but owing to the weighty quantity
of Quad funds in their possession, both
men sank deeper and deeper into the
snggy wet soil, at last giving up in de
spair.
The Quad photographers then arrived
on the scene and after a short half
hour of carefully recording the situation
with their cameras, finally separated the
victims from their muddy environment.
It is considered extremely fortunate
that many organizations of the campus
have not paid for their Quad space, for
with these additional funds on the per
son of the manager, he would have been
weighted down beyond the possibility of
extrication long before the photogra
phers arrived. The manager points out
that, with the advent of dry weather, ex
cess gold will not longer encumber him,
and urges organizations to pay for their
Quad space.
