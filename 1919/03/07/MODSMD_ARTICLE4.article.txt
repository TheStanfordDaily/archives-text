Professor J. Milton O'Neil of the
University of Wisconsin will phrase
the specific question for the annual
Joffre debate with California, provid
ing the task is acceptable to him.
Professor O'Neil is head of the de
partment of public speaking at the
University of Wisconsin. He has
written one of the standard books on
public speaking and is editor of the
National Journal of Speech Education.
He is thus considered especially able
to select from the wide subject, "The
Future Colonial Policy of France," a
definite proposition which should be
debatable and fair to all contestants.
The "Jofre" contest is not a team
debate. The six speaksrs draw for
the side of the question to be taken,
establish a case for that side, and de
fend it against all men of the opposi
tion. As the debaters necessarily find
themselves opposed to men of their
own squad as well as to speakers from
the rival university, the authorities
are particularly anxious to secure a
question allowing equal opportunity
! for affirmative and negative argument.
