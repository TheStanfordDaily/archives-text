Dr. Jordan's Address
No one is better prepared to speak
on Founders' Day than is Chancellor-
Emeritus Jordan. He was intimately
acquainted with Senator and Mrs.
Stanford and carried the University
through the most critical period of
its financial career. Dr. Jordan has a
fund of experiences to draw upon
which are related to the early and
later days of Stanford history, many
of them humorous and others pa
thetic. The committee in charge feels
confident that all those who feel the
finer obligations of university life, will
take a distinct pleasure in making an
effort to hear Dr. Jordan's reminis
cences.
