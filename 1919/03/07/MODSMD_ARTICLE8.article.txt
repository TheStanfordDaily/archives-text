# 1921 PLAYERS AWAIT CURTAIN
## His Majesty Bunker Bean to be Presented 
### 
ail IS MAJESTY, Bunker Bean,"
11 will reign supreme tonight on
the stage of the Assembly Hall. The
1921 sophomore play is one of Harry
Leon Wilson's cleverest comedies and
has been coached by Frank L. Mathieu,
the coach of many former campus suc
cesses.
Finishing touches were put on the

play yesterday afternoon and special
attention was given to improving the
lighting effects and color schemes.
Stage Manager Pickering promises to
produce a startling, weird effect in the
psychic scene of the second act.
Fourteen-Piece Orchestra
The sophomore play management
has arranged for a fourteen-plece or
chestra. N. J. Nathanson, "21. will be
the leader. Judging from the melody
turned out at several practices, it

seems sure that the musical end of the
program will play no minor part in the
evening's entertainment.
The two leads in "Bunker Bean" are
played by Floyd McElroy, who has the
title role, and Miss Dorothy Johnston
as "Marie Breed," the "Flapper." Mc-
Elroy is an amateur actor of much ex
perience, having in one instance played

in another of llarrv Leon Wilson's
comedies. "The Man From Home.'
Miss Johnston has appeared several
times in amateur theatricals in San
Jose and is absolutely at home on the
stage.
"Pops" is Old-School Broker
The part of "Marie's" father is
played by Robert lteid. "Pops," as "Mr.
7. B. Breed," of Wall Street, is known
to his friends, as a conservative, old
school broker, with one big dream left
iij life, that is, to "cut a melon" in
"Associated Express Company" stock.
"Bunker Bean" is his favorite stenog
rapher.
"Bulger," another stenographer in
"Pops'" office, forms a distinct con
trast to the very efficient "Bunker."
"Bulger" is played by Melvin Doyle.
He has a lazy disposition which, com
bined with his fifteen-a-week salary,
makes him jump at a cliaace to do
"Bunker" out of his share of "Pops' "
melon. The means by which he pro
ceeds to do this are amazing.
Bulger Does "Bunco Work"
It is "Bulger's" "dirty work" that
brings poor "Bunker" to the Oriental
smelling den of the Countess Cassa
nova and her slave, "Balthazar." Inez
Wood plays the part of the mysterious
countess and Lloyd Howard takes the
part of "Balthazar." Ilere the famous
mummy enters into "Bunker's" life.
Coach Mathieu is well pleased with
the way each member of the cast is
peculiarly adapted to the characteriza
tion of his role. The significance of
this statement is shown by taking one
look at the cast of characters of
"Bunker Bean." There are represent
atives of different professions, from
baseball pitching to fortune-telling.
Following the play, "His Majesty's"
ball will be given in the Women's
Club House. Tickets for the play will
be on sale at the door just before the
performance.
