realized at the present time. He
pointed out the great beauty in the
form of Stanford University and the
high degree of fineness which the
many courses offered have obtained.

gave an address following the talk by
Dr. Jordan. He emphasized the ex

of college professors to give out as
much knowledge as possible.
Special music by the church choir
and soloists completed the program.

was held Saturday. The following
Founders' Day telegram was received
by President Wilbur from the Stan
ford Women's Unit:
"Birthday greetings from St. Na
