was weak in pinches, so that the babes
got what seemed to be a safe lead early
in the game and were never headed.
Pratt struck out ten men and issued but
one walk. His wildness showed when
he hit six men.
Neer struck out three men and gave a
like number of walks, while Sibley was
credited with a score of one and five.
The hitting star of the game was Gomez,
the babes' second baseman. He knocked

out two doubles, a single, and got hit
once in five times at hat. Sibley proved
his right to number three on the batting
list when he showed his ability in sacri
ficing.

Lick H. S.—Sullivan, 2b; Johnson, c;
Reich, ss; Aghen, 31); Heale, 11); Gomes,
