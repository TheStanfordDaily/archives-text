# ABOUT THE WOMEN

the receipt and publication of a communication to
mMf ' /*§»» *■»'■#•»*> J these columns the other evening of an article signed
by "A Stanford Student" and admittedly written by a Stanford
woman student in a position to know whereof she wrote, our minds
once again centered upon the women of the University. In moments of stress
and excitement over affairs that arc selfishly regarded as appertaining to the men
of the University only, we are prone to forget the vital part that the women of
the University take in the problems and life of the University.
The women can no longer he regarded as queening mediums only, since we
are repeatedly being made to become aware of the actual participation of the
women in other events than those social. We must realize that the women share
the problems of the University in addition to possessing some very real problems
of their own besides.
It is one of these latter problems, really possessed by the women alone, but
likewise concerning the men of the University in that respect ourselves, that the
communication of Thursday evening dealt.
Restrictions upon the women of the University seem to have been imbibed
gradually into the University, until one would be inclined to feel the absence of
these restrictions once they were no longer with us. We might feel their absence,
but we certainly would not miss them. Women who need restrictions of the sort
imposed and still maintained by the Women's Council are not of the caliber that
is wanted at Stanford or of the caliber that is at Stanford. When a woman stu
dent attends a university it is generally understood that she possesses sufficient
responsibility to be the guardian of her own actions. If she does not, there are
always house restrictions and dormitory restrictions possible.
It was pointed out that the restrictions on late motor riding, walking in the
hills, and other so-called minor vices might have been comprehensible at a time
when there was a certain element of danger to the women of the University
through the proximity of thousands of soldiers at Camp Fremont. That excuse
has now practically disappeared. To continue these rules now is either to imply
that the men of the University are not to be trusted in the making of their own
rules with the women or the University, or that these women themselves are not
to be trusted without the guiding apron strings and binding rules of an imposed
chaperonage.
Let it not be understood that the Women's Council is to be impugned through
these columns, for the Women's Council has shown the men the way to Student
Control. Let it not either then be understood that the character of the men or
women of Stanford University is such that the women need to be protected from
themselves or from the men of the University. Let it not be understood that we
advocate unlimited, unregulated queening, but let it be understood that we do
stand for the abandonment of played-out and needless regulations.
