Dear Sir: It is significant that not a
woman ventured to out-tradition tradi
tion hy speaking in the upperclass meet
ing Thursday evening, although the
chairman invited opinion from the wom
en. Doubtless they were taken by sur
prise. And certainly the atmopsere of
surprise would ha\e increased if a femi
nine voice had been lifted. It has for so
long been taken for granted that women
constitute a subordinate and gallantly
tolerated section of the Stanford student
body, that the slightest implication to the
contrary comes as a shock to all. Per
haps the chairman was not aware of his
implication; perhaps he was only being
gallant once more.
However that may be, the time has
comc when the women of Stanford must
arouse themselves to the responsibility
of citizenship in the Stanford student
body. At present their attitude of indif
ference is a threat to the future of stu
dent government at Stanford. The
women are not only disinterested in mat
ters pertaining to the student body as a
whole. They arc so indifferent to their
own affairs that manifestly inconsistent
rules must be imposed upon them by the
guardians of the University. As long as
such a lack of personal responsibility is
evident on the part of Stanford's student
body which has not been disrupted by
war conditions, no effort of the men will
be powerful enough to convince the Uni
versity authorities that Stanford stu
dents arc capable of self-government.
We are not interested in the causes of
the traditional aloofness of women from
student body affairs. The present mo
ment demands their cooperation with the
men. The indications are that the men
will welcome such copoeration. It is
time for the women of Stanford to prove
that they arc not a threat to student con
trol. A STANFORD WOMAN.
