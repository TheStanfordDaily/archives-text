# JIMMY LANAGAN IS BACK FROM FRANCE
## 
### 
"Jimmy" Lanagan, who coached the
winning Cardinal teams from 1903 until
the advent of rugby in 1908, has arrived
in New York on his way home from
France. Lanagan had a phenomenal
record during his stay at Stanford, hav
ing made from a collection of inexperi
enced men a team that met the veteran
players of California and defeated them,
and continued to do so for the next five
years.
Lanagan was in the midst of the fight
"over there" from the early part of the
war until its close, and returns in pos
session of a major's stars. He has de
veloped into an expert trapshooter, and
it was from his battery that the first
anti-aircraft gun was fired.
After having received his discharge
from Washington, he plans to return to
San Francisco, where he is law partner
of William Thomas.
