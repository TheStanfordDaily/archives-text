# Irish Marathon Tryouts Wednesday
## Dinkelspiel Makes the Best Time Last Saturday in Informal Meet 
### 
First competitive tryouts for the Irish
Marathon were held Saturday afternoon
instead of the regular informal track
meet. The condition of the weather and
track made a full distance meet im
practical.
Further tryouts for the annual" mara
thon classic will he held on the oval
Wednesday afternoon. Class captains
arc getting up their lists of available
men fort lie marathon and will super
vise the tryouts Wednesday.
Work on repairing the track will he
completed by tomorrow night and the
tryouts will give a real indication of
speed. A springy cinder path two feet
in width is being laid around the in
side of the track over a base of straw.
This will speed the track up consider
ably for distance men and will help pre
vent the usual crop of shin-splints which
have been coming from the old track.
Time made in the meet Saturday
could only be estimated, as the 440-yard
heats had to be run down the straight
away and then around the outside of
the oval. Dinkelspiel made the best
time of the day, covering the distance
in 54.1 seconds, which, according to
Captain Teitsworth, would have been
about 52 flat under normal circum
stances.
Wilkie made the round of the oval in
55 3/5 seconds and Carlsmith was caught
at 56 flat. Men who were training for
the distance events made the time at
various figures from 57 to 60 seconds.
