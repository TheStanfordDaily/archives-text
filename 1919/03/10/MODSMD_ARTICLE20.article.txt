# MADAME ALDA WILL BE HEARD HERE MARCH 27

### 
Madame Frances Alda, the popular
Metropolitan Opera House star, who
will be heard Thursday evening, March
27, at the Assembly Hall, contributed an
article reecently to "The Musical Ob
server" in which she advocated the
establishment of a government subsidy
for the opera in the larger cities. In
this article she says:
"What this country needs, more than
anything else, to further its musical
advancement is for the government to
do something for the furtherance and
control of the opera. As the case now
stands, different companies of individ
uals get together and map out operatic
plans. They say, 'We will give a season
of opera here or there.' They organize,
engage singers, get started and run for
a little while —they cannot go further.
There is nothing sure about the
venture and we never hear about the
opera company afterwards. One com
pany T could mention, in another city,
started out with the brightest plans and
prospects. Their beginning was most
propitious. But soon the scheme was
tried of bringing Caruso, Farrar, my
self and others, from the Metropolitan
for guest performances. This was a mis
take for several reasons, financial and
otherwise. It also made the task ex
tremely difficult for the singers who
were scheduled to follow us the next
evening, and who were thereby obliged
to compete with our performances. This
plan could not succeed and was one
cause for the failure of the enterprise.
"What the government could do would
be to subsidize opera in the larger cities,
say in cities of five hundred thousand.
Lot them have regular seasons of per
haps ten weeks every year. Then native
singers would be able to secure their
opportunity to gain experience, to exer
cise their talents. It seems to me only
in such ways as this can the young
American singer find the longed-for
field and the people themselves learn to
know, appreciate, and love opera."
