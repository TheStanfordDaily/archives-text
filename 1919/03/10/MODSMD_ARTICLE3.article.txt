# Cardinal-Mission Game Ends in Tie
## Coach Evans' Baseball Squad Shows Up Well in Game Saturday Afternoon 
### 
In the last game of the Santa Clara
i series, the Stanford varsity baseball
! team tied the Mission team in a seven
inning game by the score of 3to 3. By
playing an excellent brand of ball, the
Stanford team demonstrated that it is
rounding into mid-season form.
Stanford scored in the first inning,
| when Kallam and Stevens crossed the
j rubber with two runs as a result of a
walk, a stolen base, an error and a sacri
fice fly. The Santa Clara hitters were
unable to touch Fairchilds' offerings un
j til the fourth inning, when a run was
marked up. The second run was scored
I in the sixth inning on hits by Perasso
and Manelli.
Stanford took the lead in the first half
I of the sixth when Lilly walked, stole sec
ond and scored when Varni, the Santa
Clara backstop, threw the ball into cen
ter field. The Mission aggregation tied
the score in the seventh, and according
to agreement the game was stopped at
the close of the seventh inning.
Fairchilds pitched the best game this
season for the Cardinal team. The
Santa Clara hits were scattered, and ex
cellent control prevented any free passes
â– to first base. Ciillis went into the box in
! thi last part of the game and held the
j Santa Clara batters down. Bundy
worked on the receiving end and held the
pitchers up in good style.
Although the Stanford batters succeed
ed in hitting the ball better than they
have done at any time this season, only
two safe hits were made off of O Neil,
the Santa Clara right-hander. Kallam
and Stevens were the successful men.
Owing to the absence of Captain
" I'm" Galloway, the infield was changed
around and Masters played first base,
Green second base, Kallam shortstop, and
Stevens played third.
The Stanford-Santa C lara contest was
part of a double-header in which the San
Francisco "Seals" played the Olympic
Club.
The Seals will play Stanford here 011
Wednesday.
