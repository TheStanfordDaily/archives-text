# CAMPUS DECLARES SOPHOMORE PLAY COMPLETE SUCCESS
## MUCH CREDIT DUE COACH Miss Dorothy Johnston and Floyd McElroy Star in Leading Roles 
### R.W. Kenny, '21 
" r),UNKER BEAN/' who loved to
D 1 ileal in superlatives, and al
ways introduced hi» friends with some
prefix as "world's greatest" pitcher or
"world's biggest" medium, would prob
ably have called the ly2l Sophomore
play last Friday the "best" comedy
ever given on the campus. It is to the
credit of the cast and coach of "His
Majesty Bunker Bean," that such an
apparently inflated verdict would not
go tar wrong. For a class production,
with the attendant limitation of dra
matic material, the play was a reve
lation.
The Sophomore Play Committee
made a very wise choice in selecting
Harry Leon Wilson's "Bunker Bean."
It was an ideal farce for campus pre
sentation. A good farce, one that can
hold an«audience's interest for two and
a half hours is rare. "11. M. Bunker
Bean" performed that feat, in spite of
four long stage waits between scenes.
In general, the acting was not
marred by the usual slips that mark
campus theatricals. Of course, the
major part of the credit for this
smoothness is due to the coach, Frank
L. Mathieu. Good coaching will work
wonders with any kind of material.
If there was any unqualified success
in the play it was that of the leading
lady, Miss Dorothy Johnston, playing
the part of the "Flapper." This is not
said out of conventional courtesy to
leading ladies in general. Miss John
ston has the happy faculty of being
delightfully at home on the stage. Her
part was one that, above all, demand
ed naturalness and throughout all four
acts she lived up to its demands. A
little affectation would have spoiled
the charm of her ingenue role. Miss j
Johnston cannot be complimented too
highly on her charming and graceful
work.
Floyd McElroy, in the title role,
"Bunker Bean," gave a very complete
cone ption of a difficult character. To
act the part of a credulous fool is
much harder on the stage than in real
life. If there was anything that would
have helped the characterization of
this part it was the dramatist's fault,
not McElroy's. A subtler "Bunker
Bean" without so many broad comedy
lines would have raised the whole tone
of the play.
Campus theatricals have suffered
much from the natural limitation of
money to be devoted to scenery. But
with the scenery in hand and a little
good taste the results have usually
been pleasing. When the curtain lift
ed on Bunker Bean's room in the sec
ond act the audience was stunned by
the atrocity. The scene looked more
like a bare spot in a hotel lobby than
a man's private apartment. On the
walls there was one picture, and that
a mounted photograph, a "prop" nec
essary to the plot. It was a painful
example of somebody's very poor
taste.
Robert Reul had a comparatively
easy part as the blustering, gouty old
broker, "Pops." As long as the lines
called for straight acting Reid did
very well, but he did not seem en
tirely capable of the big emotional
scenes demanding intense rage. Pa
ternal wrath demands much of an
actor and Reid's fits of rage were not
quite as convincing as they might
have been.
The part of "Bulger," played by M.
E. Doyle, might have been handled
with a little more polish. If "Bulger"
had been a little more of the slick vil
lain type than Doyle's conception*of
the part, it would have had much more
success. A. I. Townsend as "Bud
Mathews" was very fresh and natural.
Perhaps the two most striking char
acters in the play were the "Countess
Casanova" and "Professor Balthazar."
The countess was played by Miss Inez
Wood and the professor by Lloyd
Howard. In their capacities as mys
tics, they were excellent. However,
it seemed that the comic effects of
their scene where they step out of their
mystic personalities and begin to
wrangle over the proceeds might have
been heightened. Howard's "Sven
gali" make-up bordered a little too
much oil the slap-stick to be in tune
with the rest of the play.
Miss Fern Weaver put plenty of
force into her part of the "Flapper's"
mother. Miss Elizabeth Strong as the
big sister was superb in her portrayal
of the shallow society girl.
Typical farce characters such as the
young minister, played by R. C. Alex
ander, the broker's son, the waster,
played by C. H. Harrington, and the
"Lizzie Boy," played by M. B. Kildale,
were handled with the correct comic,
spirit. "Mira," the maid, Miss Kirby
Ingoldsby, and "Louis," the butler, G.
F. Bartle, would solve the servant
problem in any suburban community.
M. V. Wood, as "Larabee," also de
serves very honorable mention. Miss
Eleanor Beach was very good as the
spirited old grandmother. Her acting
at times, however, was marred by a
tendency to pose.
It takes considerable effort to avoid
the logical conclusion of something to
the effect of "long live His Majesty."
But in fact last Friday's audience was
more than pleased with the play, and
the work of the cast and coach. Con
gratulations are in order.

the effect of "long live His Majesty."
But in fact last Friday's audience was
more than pleased with the play, and
the work of the cast and coach. Con
gratulations are in order.
" r),UNKER BEAN/' who loved to
D 1 ileal in superlatives, and al
ways introduced hi» friends with some
prefix as "world's greatest" pitcher or
"world's biggest" medium, would prob
ably have called the ly2l Sophomore
play last Friday the "best" comedy
ever given on the campus. It is to the
credit of the cast and coach of "His
Majesty Bunker Bean," that such an
apparently inflated verdict would not
go tar wrong. For a class production,
with the attendant limitation of dra
matic material, the play was a reve
lation.
The Sophomore Play Committee
made a very wise choice in selecting
Harry Leon Wilson's "Bunker Bean."
It was an ideal farce for campus pre
sentation. A good farce, one that can
hold an«audience's interest for two and
a half hours is rare. "11. M. Bunker
Bean" performed that feat, in spite of
four long stage waits between scenes.
In general, the acting was not
marred by the usual slips that mark
campus theatricals. Of course, the
major part of the credit for this
smoothness is due to the coach, Frank
L. Mathieu. Good coaching will work
wonders with any kind of material.
If there was any unqualified success
in the play it was that of the leading
lady, Miss Dorothy Johnston, playing
the part of the "Flapper." This is not
said out of conventional courtesy to
leading ladies in general. Miss John
ston has the happy faculty of being
delightfully at home on the stage. Her
part was one that, above all, demand
ed naturalness and throughout all four
acts she lived up to its demands. A
little affectation would have spoiled
the charm of her ingenue role. Miss j
Johnston cannot be complimented too
highly on her charming and graceful
work.
Floyd McElroy, in the title role,
"Bunker Bean," gave a very complete
cone ption of a difficult character. To
act the part of a credulous fool is
much harder on the stage than in real
life. If there was anything that would
have helped the characterization of
this part it was the dramatist's fault,
not McElroy's. A subtler "Bunker
Bean" without so many broad comedy
lines would have raised the whole tone
of the play.
Campus theatricals have suffered
much from the natural limitation of
money to be devoted to scenery. But
with the scenery in hand and a little
good taste the results have usually
been pleasing. When the curtain lift
ed on Bunker Bean's room in the sec
ond act the audience was stunned by
the atrocity. The scene looked more
like a bare spot in a hotel lobby than
a man's private apartment. On the
walls there was one picture, and that
a mounted photograph, a "prop" nec
essary to the plot. It was a painful
example of somebody's very poor
taste.
Robert Reul had a comparatively
easy part as the blustering, gouty old
broker, "Pops." As long as the lines
called for straight acting Reid did
very well, but he did not seem en
tirely capable of the big emotional
scenes demanding intense rage. Pa
ternal wrath demands much of an
actor and Reid's fits of rage were not
quite as convincing as they might
have been.
The part of "Bulger," played by M.
E. Doyle, might have been handled
with a little more polish. If "Bulger"
had been a little more of the slick vil
lain type than Doyle's conception*of
the part, it would have had much more
success. A. I. Townsend as "Bud
Mathews" was very fresh and natural.
Perhaps the two most striking char
acters in the play were the "Countess
Casanova" and "Professor Balthazar."
The countess was played by Miss Inez
Wood and the professor by Lloyd
Howard. In their capacities as mys
tics, they were excellent. However,
it seemed that the comic effects of
their scene where they step out of their
mystic personalities and begin to
wrangle over the proceeds might have
been heightened. Howard's "Sven
gali" make-up bordered a little too
much oil the slap-stick to be in tune
with the rest of the play.
Miss Fern Weaver put plenty of
force into her part of the "Flapper's"
mother. Miss Elizabeth Strong as the
big sister was superb in her portrayal
of the shallow society girl.
Typical farce characters such as the
young minister, played by R. C. Alex
ander, the broker's son, the waster,
played by C. H. Harrington, and the
"Lizzie Boy," played by M. B. Kildale,
were handled with the correct comic,
spirit. "Mira," the maid, Miss Kirby
Ingoldsby, and "Louis," the butler, G.
F. Bartle, would solve the servant
problem in any suburban community.
M. V. Wood, as "Larabee," also de
serves very honorable mention. Miss
Eleanor Beach was very good as the
spirited old grandmother. Her acting
at times, however, was marred by a
tendency to pose.

It takes considerable effort to avoid

more than pleased with the play, and
the work of the cast and coach. Con
gratulations are in order.
" r),UNKER BEAN/' who loved to
D 1 ileal in superlatives, and al
ways introduced hi» friends with some
prefix as "world's greatest" pitcher or
"world's biggest" medium, would prob
ably have called the ly2l Sophomore
play last Friday the "best" comedy
ever given on the campus. It is to the
credit of the cast and coach of "His
Majesty Bunker Bean," that such an
apparently inflated verdict would not
go tar wrong. For a class production,
with the attendant limitation of dra
matic material, the play was a reve
lation.
The Sophomore Play Committee
made a very wise choice in selecting
Harry Leon Wilson's "Bunker Bean."
It was an ideal farce for campus pre
sentation. A good farce, one that can
hold an«audience's interest for two and
a half hours is rare. "11. M. Bunker
Bean" performed that feat, in spite of
four long stage waits between scenes.
In general, the acting was not
marred by the usual slips that mark
campus theatricals. Of course, the
major part of the credit for this
smoothness is due to the coach, Frank
L. Mathieu. Good coaching will work
wonders with any kind of material.
If there was any unqualified success
in the play it was that of the leading
lady, Miss Dorothy Johnston, playing
the part of the "Flapper." This is not
said out of conventional courtesy to
leading ladies in general. Miss John
ston has the happy faculty of being
delightfully at home on the stage. Her
part was one that, above all, demand
ed naturalness and throughout all four
acts she lived up to its demands. A
little affectation would have spoiled
the charm of her ingenue role. Miss j
Johnston cannot be complimented too
highly on her charming and graceful
work.
Floyd McElroy, in the title role,
"Bunker Bean," gave a very complete
cone ption of a difficult character. To
act the part of a credulous fool is
much harder on the stage than in real
life. If there was anything that would
have helped the characterization of
this part it was the dramatist's fault,
not McElroy's. A subtler "Bunker
Bean" without so many broad comedy
lines would have raised the whole tone
of the play.
Campus theatricals have suffered
much from the natural limitation of
money to be devoted to scenery. But
with the scenery in hand and a little
good taste the results have usually
been pleasing. When the curtain lift
ed on Bunker Bean's room in the sec
ond act the audience was stunned by
the atrocity. The scene looked more
like a bare spot in a hotel lobby than
a man's private apartment. On the
walls there was one picture, and that
a mounted photograph, a "prop" nec
essary to the plot. It was a painful
example of somebody's very poor
taste.
Robert Reul had a comparatively
easy part as the blustering, gouty old
broker, "Pops." As long as the lines
called for straight acting Reid did
very well, but he did not seem en
tirely capable of the big emotional
scenes demanding intense rage. Pa
ternal wrath demands much of an
actor and Reid's fits of rage were not
quite as convincing as they might
have been.
The part of "Bulger," played by M.
E. Doyle, might have been handled
with a little more polish. If "Bulger"
had been a little more of the slick vil
lain type than Doyle's conception*of
the part, it would have had much more
success. A. I. Townsend as "Bud
Mathews" was very fresh and natural.
Perhaps the two most striking char
acters in the play were the "Countess
Casanova" and "Professor Balthazar."
The countess was played by Miss Inez
Wood and the professor by Lloyd
Howard. In their capacities as mys
tics, they were excellent. However,
it seemed that the comic effects of
their scene where they step out of their
mystic personalities and begin to
wrangle over the proceeds might have
been heightened. Howard's "Sven
gali" make-up bordered a little too
much oil the slap-stick to be in tune
with the rest of the play.
Miss Fern Weaver put plenty of
force into her part of the "Flapper's"
mother. Miss Elizabeth Strong as the
big sister was superb in her portrayal
of the shallow society girl.
Typical farce characters such as the
young minister, played by R. C. Alex
ander, the broker's son, the waster,
played by C. H. Harrington, and the
"Lizzie Boy," played by M. B. Kildale,
were handled with the correct comic,
spirit. "Mira," the maid, Miss Kirby
Ingoldsby, and "Louis," the butler, G.
F. Bartle, would solve the servant
problem in any suburban community.
M. V. Wood, as "Larabee," also de
serves very honorable mention. Miss
Eleanor Beach was very good as the
spirited old grandmother. Her acting
at times, however, was marred by a
tendency to pose.
It takes considerable effort to avoid
the logical conclusion of something to
the effect of "long live His Majesty."
But in fact last Friday's audience was
more than pleased with the play, and
the work of the cast and coach. Con
gratulations are in order.
