# CAMPUS WILL HONOR CLIFF IRELAND'S STARS SATURDAY
## HOLDOVER SHOW COMING AFTER MARATHON Varsity Baseball Team to Stage Stag Party at Union 
### 
Saturday will be "Ireland's Indepen
dents Day" on the campus in honor of
Cliff Ireland, who will bring his aggre
gation of big league baseball stars to
Stanford for the twenty-seventh time
since 1892 for a game with the varsity.
The varsity played the Independents this
afternoon in the first game of the two
game series. The final game will be
played Saturday afternoon as part of
the program of the day. The traditional
Irish marathon race will be held Satur
day morning, and the Holdover Show
will be held on the baseball field after
the marathon race.
Saturday night Cliff Ireland will be
the host at a stag party which will be
given for the Stanford varsity baseball
team. High-class entertainment from
San Francisco will be provided and
prominent speakers will be present for
the affair, which will probably be held
at the Union. Invitations are being sent
out to a few campus people.
The baseball game in the afternoon
will give Stanford people an opportunity
to see a number of baseball stars in ac
tion, such as Harry Heilman of the De
troit Tigers, "Duffy" Lewis of the New
York Americans, "Lefty" O'Doul of the
same team, and numerous Coast League
stars. Cliff Ireland will play second
base, and lie is said to be one of the
best comedians that ever appeared on a
ball field.
Tomorrow afternoon the varsity will
play the San Francisco Seals. Dim
mock, former University of California
pitcher, will Work on the slab for the
San Francisco club. The Seals defeated
the Santa Clara team last Sunday by
the score of 10 to 2. Coach "Bob" Evans
is optimistic over the outcome and is
confident that the varsity will make a
good showing against the fast Seal play
ers.
