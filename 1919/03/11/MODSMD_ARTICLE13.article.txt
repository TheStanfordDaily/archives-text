## UPPERCLASS TEAMS MAY COMBINE Holdover Show to Be Held in Conjunction With Baseball Game 
### 
I ryouts for the Irish marathon by
team captains will be held on the track
tomorrow afternoon. Every man who
expects to run in the quarter-mile classic
on Saturday should be out to give his
time to his class deader.
Plans for the marathon are not com
plete. Captain Westwick of the '19 run
ners is not yet sure that he can turn
out a team to represent the seniors,
and the two uppcrclasses may combine
to form one squad. The juniors under
Captain Maynard have several good
quarter men, but may not have enough
to form a complete team.
The two underclasses will both be
able to enter full squads. The sopho
mores under Carlsmith are confident
have several men who come well undei
sixty seconds.
I he freshmen are an unknown quan
tity, but Captain Jenks has a list of some
thirty men at present from which to
pick his team of twenty-five.
All the team captains will have stop
watches out on the track tomorrow to
get times.
A gold medal will be given to both the
varsity and novice entries making the
fastest time in the marathon.
The "holdover" show, usually a part
of the marathon, will be sacrificed this
year to the national pastime, since it
will be held on the baseball diamond
in conjunction with the game with Cliff
Ireland's Independents.
