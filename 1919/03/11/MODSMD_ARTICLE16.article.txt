B the future. It is an old Cardinal institution to instill into the
2 underclassmen of the University that desire to plan for the futui*
which is essential for the future development of athletics.
It used to be an old cry at California that Stanford always managed to get
the athletes to come to the Farm rather than across the bay. The solution was
simple; Stanford men impressed visitors on the Farm that Stanford was the logi
cal place for men of high type, that there always was opportunity for men in
athletics and in activities.
Furthermore, something that is often neglected, the upperclassmen kept in
stilling into the minds of the sophomores and freshmen of the University the fact
that it was up to the underclassmen to look ahead to the day when they in turn
would be the guiding force behind the activities of the University. It is for such
a purpose that the underclassmen of the University have been called to a rally
this evening.
How about the future? The underclassmen of the University can best an
swer that question. They have upon their shoulders the responsibility for the
future development of the activities of the University. It is up to the underclass
men to talk up activities among themselves, to develop some of the principles of
Stanford spirit; to develop this spirit in its old place in Stanford life; once in its
place, instilled into the underclassmen, there will no longer be any need to worry
about the future.
1921 and 1922 have a splendid opportunity at the enthusiasm rally this even
ing; let's see them take it.
