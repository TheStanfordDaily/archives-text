In the hig field of Stanford tradition there is so much forgotten and
overlooked that it would be but wasted time to attempt to recall every offense to
old tradition.
However, there are one or two traditions that have not disappeared. The
good old one, "lifting the lid" when passing Dr. Jordan, has never been abandoned
although it is sometimes forgotten. Let us call attention to the fact that Stanford
tradition has developed the idea of showing some outward respect for the Chan
cellor-Emeritus of the University; the expression of this respect as handed down
from the days when the Doctor was a constant ligure on the Quadrangle was for
the men to raise their hats when passing him.
This certainly is no hardship, especially today when we rarely have the pleas
ure of seeing Dr. Jordan upon the Quad; the least we can do is to show him upon
these rare occasions that Stanford men today respect him as Stanford men of the
past did. Let us raise the lid.
