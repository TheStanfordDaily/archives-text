# RIFLE SHOOTING MEET POSTPONED
## 
### 
Captain Parker has received permis- j
sion from the National Rifle Associa
tion to delay the first inter-collegiate
meet for two weeks longer than was
previously agreed, because target rifles
have not yet been received for practice.
The shoot will be attended by every
college in the association. Each college
will do the shooting at the home range,
under supervision of a judge, and then
send the scores to Washington.
A match is now being arranged with
California in which regular army calibre
shells will be used, in all other matches
only .22 calibre being used. Consider
able enthusiasm is being aroused over
the prospects of this meet; it will take
place either at the Stanford or the Cali
fornia range.
The squad is to be composed of
twenty men and out of this number ten
will be selected to make up the team,
This ten will be changed as the
scores of the squad members vary. The
club will not meet again until next quar
ter. In the meantime, anyone wishing
to join the association may do so by
signing at the R. O. T. C. headquarters.
All experienced rifle men are especially
urged to trv out for the team.
