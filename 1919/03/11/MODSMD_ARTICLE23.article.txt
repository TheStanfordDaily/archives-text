To the Editor of the Daily Palo Alto:
Last night's timely and generous
editorial cannot help but arouse some
comment. There is no doubt but that
the restrictions placed on Stanford
women are of a stricter nature than
might be expected or liked, but after
all, these restrictions have little or
nothing to do with the status of the
women so far as their "participation
in other events than those social."
The criticism of the chaperonage reg
ulations is very just, but the question
iis purely a side issue. If the women
j of the University want to participate
!in student affairs they can do so in
j spite of the theater train rule. And to
I carry the issue a step farther, it is
possible that if the women did demon
| strate greater concern over campus
affairs the proof of their responsibil
ity might be complete enough to war
! rant the removal of unnecessary re
; strictions.
On the other hand, there is certain
ly an exaggerated idea current con-
I cerning the hopeless position of the
women. Given the normal conditions
i at Stanford —three times as many men
as girls—it is reasonable to expect the
girls' interest in student body affairs
:to be a minority interest. The writer
jof last night's "Another Viewpoint"
! comments on the significance of the
J fact that "not a woman ventured to
: speak in upperclass meeting." I fail
to see anything so dire in that fact,
i Perhaps the women felt that the sit
uation had already been admirably
presented by the men. Their silence
was no sign that they were uninter
ested.
What seems to be the issue at stake
lis this: Let us treat the situation
, with more naturalness. There is no
doubt in the minds of many of the
women on the campus that they would
like to do what they can to help in
campus affairs. After all there is no
i great question about the women.
Granted that there is a general apathy
among them just as there is among
the men. The need seems to be for
every one to pull together. The
women want to take their place in the
campus machinery and there seems
no reason to doubt but that they will
do so.

To the Editor of the Daily Palo Alto:
Amateur plays' and critics beget one
another, it seems. However, we are of
the opinion that not all of the changes
advised by our sophomore critic would
be acceptable to us, as the audience, to
his friend Mathieu, as the coach, or to
Harry Leon Wilson, as the author.
It has come to our ears that for sun
dry reasons—political or otherwise—the
amateur critic docs not admire various
members of the sophomore cast. How
ever. we are glad to note that at least
one man was "fresh and natural." Simi
larly our sophomore critic under the
style of the Metropolitan endeavors to
establish a reputation for his own
"freshness" —somewhat admirably, wc
may say.
The purpose of the writer is not to
discuss style and mode so much as to
protest against articles written supposed
ly for one purpose and undoubtedly for
another. Politics and criticism go to
gether, but they should be properly la
beled. Advertising should lie paid for.
