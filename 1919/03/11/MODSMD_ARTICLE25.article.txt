### RUTH LAKIN, '18 
SUNDAY marked the twenty-fifth
Founders' Day to be celebrated on
the Stanford campus. The first of
ficially announced Founders' Day ex
ercises were held in the men's old
gymnasium 011 March 9, 1894. The
principal address was delivered by ex-
President Benjamin Harrison, who had
been a personal friend of both Senator
and Mrs. Stanford.
Previous to this, Memorial Day had
been held on May 14, Leland, Jr.'s,
birthday, in the years 1892, '93, and
'94. But at the request of Mrs. Stan
ford Memorial and Founders' Day were
merged into one and the date, March
9. Senator Stanford's birthday anniver
sary, was chosen.
Passed Endowment Act
It is interesting to note that the En
dowment Act, which legalized the es
tablishment of a university, "being an
act to advance learning, art, and sci
ence and promote the public welfare,"
was approved b ythe state legislature
on the same date, March 9, in the year
1885. The Grant of Endowment, care
fully drawn up by the Senator, was
duly signed and approved by the Stan
fords on November 14 of the same
year.
The first meeting of the Board of
Trustees was held also 011 this day. In
the short speech with which the Sen
ator opened the meeting, the reasons
for his selection of the Palo Alto estate
as the location for a university were
given. "First, because of personal as
sociations, and also for the excellent
climate and its accessibility.

Land Endowment Valuable
"The endowment of lands," he stat
ed, "were made because they are in
themselves of great value, and on their
proper management will insure to the
University an income much greater
than would be realized if their value
were put into any reliable interest
bearing security."
The articles of the* endowment pro
hibit any sectarianism, but both Sen
ator and Mrs. Stanford were anxious
that a church of worship be estab
lished 011 the campus. They were also
anxious that the education of both men
and women should be equally full and
complete. The Grant of Endowment is
intended to be in the nature of a con
stitution for government and guidance
of the Board of Trustees in all general
matters.
Cornerstone Laid May 14
The University cornerstone was laid
on May 14, 1887, by Senator Stanford,
while a choir sang the hymn beginning
'Heirs of Unending Life." The cere
mony was an impressive one and was
witnessed by a large number of people
gathered from every part of the coun
try.
Just four years later, on October 1,
1891, the opening exercises of the first
collegiate school year were held. The
400 students seated together near the
platform rose en mass as Senator and
Mrs. Stanford appeared, and for the
first time a united, enthusiastic expres
sion of the Stanford spirit was heard.
"Wahoo! Wahoo! L. S. J. U.
Stanford!"
Leland Stanford Junior University

been held on May 14, Leland, Jr.'s,
birthday, in the years 1892, '93, and
'94. But at the request of Mrs. Stan
ford Memorial and Founders' Day were
merged into one and the date, March
9. Senator Stanford's birthday anniver
sary, was chosen.
Passed Endowment Act
It is interesting to note that the En
dowment Act, which legalized the es
tablishment of a university, "being an
act to advance learning, art, and sci
ence and promote the public welfare,"
was approved b ythe state legislature
on the same date, March 9, in the year
1885. The Grant of Endowment, care
fully drawn up by the Senator, was
duly signed and approved by the Stan
fords on November 14 of the same
year.
The first meeting of the Board of
Trustees was held also 011 this day. In
the short speech with which the Sen
ator opened the meeting, the reasons
for his selection of the Palo Alto estate
as the location for a university were
given. "First, because of personal as
sociations, and also for the excellent
climate and its accessibility.

Land Endowment Valuable
"The endowment of lands," he stat
ed, "were made because they are in
themselves of great value, and on their
proper management will insure to the
University an income much greater
than would be realized if their value
were put into any reliable interest
bearing security."
The articles of the* endowment pro
hibit any sectarianism, but both Sen
ator and Mrs. Stanford were anxious
that a church of worship be estab
lished 011 the campus. They were also
anxious that the education of both men
and women should be equally full and
complete. The Grant of Endowment is
intended to be in the nature of a con
stitution for government and guidance
of the Board of Trustees in all general
matters.
Cornerstone Laid May 14
The University cornerstone was laid
on May 14, 1887, by Senator Stanford,
while a choir sang the hymn beginning
'Heirs of Unending Life." The cere
mony was an impressive one and was
witnessed by a large number of people
gathered from every part of the coun
try.
Just four years later, on October 1,
1891, the opening exercises of the first
collegiate school year were held. The
400 students seated together near the
platform rose en mass as Senator and
Mrs. Stanford appeared, and for the
first time a united, enthusiastic expres
sion of the Stanford spirit was heard.
"Wahoo! Wahoo! L. S. J. U.
Stanford!"
Leland Stanford Junior University
was truly in existence.

ficially announced Founders' Day ex
ercises were held in the men's old
gymnasium 011 March 9, 1894. The
principal address was delivered by ex-
President Benjamin Harrison, who had
been a personal friend of both Senator
and Mrs. Stanford.
