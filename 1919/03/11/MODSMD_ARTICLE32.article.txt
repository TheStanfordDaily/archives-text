# COSMOPOLITAN CLUB ELECTS NEW MEMBERS
## 
### 
Cosmopolitan Club met for the last
time this quarter in the Women's Club
house last night, and one of the most
successful and well attended meetings
of the year was held. Vocal solos by
Miss Gladys Marriott, '21, and C. L.
McCormick, '19, were rendered as part
of an informal program. General plans
for next quarter were discussed, and
the programs for five meetings outlined.
The advisability of joining the National
Association of Cosmopolitan Clubs was
discussed but no definite action was
taken upon the matter. Eight new mem
bers were voted into the club. Refresh
ments were served, and the meeting con
cluded with the singing of Stanford
songs.
