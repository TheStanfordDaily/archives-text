# YEARLING NINE TO MEET PALO ALTO IN THIRD CONTEST
## 
### 
The yearlings will pit their nine for
the third time tomorrow against Palo
Alto High School on the local field.
Those who have seen the first two
contests staged between the two ag
gregations can testify to the evenness
with which the teams are matched.
The first game played resulted in a 2-1
defeat for the freshmen, the second
ended in a 1-1 tie. The third match
should prove interesting, according to
Coach Cass. Although several men
have been lost from the team by the
suspensions, Cass has a number of
men who give promise of being good
material. The line-up for the babes
follows: Gomez, 2nd; Stevenson, 1.f.;
Sibley, c.f.; Holsten, r.f.; Holmes, 3rd;
Hawks, Ist; Connolly, ss. The bat
teries are not yet certain.
