# UNDERCLASS MEETING IN ROOM 214 TONIGHT
## 
### 
Underclassmen of the University
will meet tonight in Room 214 (not
the Assembly Hall, as previously an
nounced) at 7:15, in accordance with
the action taken by the student coun
cil last week. The purpose of this
meeting is to bring the problems of
student government, student control
and effective participation in student
activity before the Stanford sopho
mores and freshmen. Open discus
sion will be in order.
J. K. Lilly, '19, president of the A.
S. S. U., will preside; L. C. Rogers,
'17, crew man and member of the
studeut control committee; W. I.
Ames, '18, student manager; C. S.
Teitsworth, *19, track captain; F. W.
Williamson, '19, basketball man, and
F. A. Watts, '19, crew captain, will be
among those who will present ideas
of student government and the revival
of Stanford spirit in short talks.

As in the meeting of upperclassmen
which was held last Thursday night,
"enthusiasm will be the object of this
underclass gathering." The part that
the first and second year men can
play in bringing Stanford up to the
pre-war standard in spirit and partic
ipation in student activities will be
pointed out by the upperclass speak
ers.
Last week's meeting of the upper
classmen was a decided success in
1 that it brought to the men the neces
sity for continual endeavor on their
part to see that the underclassmen
take sufficient interest in all matters
concerning the University.
The gathering of the underclassmen
tonight is of even greater importance,
however, for upon the younger men
| depends the formulation of the ideas
j which will govern the student body
| in the future.
