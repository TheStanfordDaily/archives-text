# Metropolitan Star to Sing Here
## 
### 
Madam Frances Alda, the gifted so
prano, who will be heard Thursday,
March 27, at the Assembly Hall, is in
private life the wife of Gatti-Gasazza,
manager of the Metropolitan Opera
Company. Because of her many acts of
kindness to young singers who have be
come assiciated with that great organ
ization—many of them through her in
fluence—she has frequently been re
ferred to as the "lady bountiful" of the
Metropolitan.
When Madam Alda speaks of the fu
ture of American singers she does so
with more than ordinary authority. In
a recent interview she is quoted as say
ing :
"The future looks very bright for na
tive singers in this country, because they
have very good voices to start with and

both the pluck and determination to cul
tivate their natural gifts. The great
drawback is the lack of experience and
drill, which are, owing to present con
ditions here, difficult to obtain.
"Strictly speaking, there is but one
opera house for the entire country; to
gain a footing at the Metropolitan is the
aim of every young singer who longs
and hopes to do something in opera.
The prize appears so enticing, so glitter
ing, that the singer quite overlooks the
years and years of study, labor, effort
and struggle those of us who are there
have gone through in order to reach this
goal. American girls are gifted studi
ous and ambitious; but one thing they
must realize—they cannot all sing at
the Metropolitan; the sooner they learn
this the better."
