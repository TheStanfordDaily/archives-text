# ROW MEN TO MEET FACULTY GROUP
## 
### 
At a meeting held last night the
Interfraternity Organization, which was
organized on last Tuesday, met with the
Student Affairs Committee for the pur
pose of discussing the conditions affect
ing fraternities.
The whole campus situation in respect
to fraternities and fraternity men was
considered with the idea of bettering
campus conditions. Some very satis
factory results were obtained from the
joint meeting, and a closer harmony will
be established with the Student Affairs
Committee.
This meeting with the Student Af
fairs Committee was in line with the
recent resolutions adopted and passed

by the Interfraternity Organization in
which they hoped to give active support
to the administration in promoting the
highest efficiency on the campus.
At this meeting last night the resolu
tions adopted by the Interfraternity Or
ganization last week were discussed at
length. The Student Affairs Committee
announced itself in complete accord with
the construtcivc measures for the pre
vention of gambling and the bringing
of liquor into the fraternity groups.
Those who attended the meeting say
that student body activities cannot help
but benefit as a final result of this
movement to better the fraternities and
to aid the administration in every possi
ble way.
