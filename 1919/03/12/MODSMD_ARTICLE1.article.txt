fans that gathered to witness the game.

loway took part. The Stanford team
made four miscues in the field while

CLIFF IRELAND'S Independents
were vanquished by the varsity
yesterday afternoon in the first battle of
a two-game series by the score of 6 to 3.
The Stanford sticksmiths found their
batting eyes and hammered out nine
safeties off from the deliveries of
"Lefty" O'Doul and Kelly, while the
Independents found Newlands for five
hits. The last game of the scries will
be played Saturday afternoon as part of
•the program of Ireland's "Independ
ents' " Day.
One of the features of the game was
Cliff Ireland's hit in the second inning
with the bat that was presented to him
by "Duffy" Lewis of the Roston Red
Sox. It was the same piece of hickory
that Lewis used in breaking up one of
the games in the last world's series
with the Chicago Cubs. Ireland's com
eyd also provided amusement for the
fans that gathered to witness the game.
'I lie varsity played in good form and
some excellent baseball was displayed.
Two double plays were executed tin
which Stevens, Kallam, Green, and Gal
loway took part. The Stanford team
made four miscues in the field while
Ireland's men slipped up six times.
