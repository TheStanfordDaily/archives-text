# Frivolous Chappies . . . . . to Wax Serious in . . . . . "Formallest" Dance
## 
### 
Waxing serious for the first time in an
advertisedly distinctly frivolous career,
Hammer and Coffin last evening decided
to blossom forth socially during one
of the spring evenings of May with one
of the most formal and most unusual
dances ever staged in the neighborhood
of the campus. From present plans the
dance may be in the neighborhood of
the campus, but will not be too close.
( 1 his refers to botli locality and money
to be spent.) If prophecies are ever ful
filled, Chappie promises the most un
usual stunts of a very spirited social
season.
The vaguest of rumors point to the
affair to be held as a culmination to the
juniors' efforts in Junior Week and may
be said to have as a motive making
the Junior Prom resemble a jolly
up in comparison to Chappie's effort.s
Hammer and Coffin points out that
this is not mere publicity in order to
draw a prospective crowd, since the
dance is to be stritly invitational in its
nature, and the number of bids limited
to the selectness of the affair.
