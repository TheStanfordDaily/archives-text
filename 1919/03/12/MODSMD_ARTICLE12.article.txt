# GYM CLUB WILL BE REORGANIZED NEXT QUARTER BY KNOLLIN
## 
### 
According to the plans of Athletic
Director Knollin, the old gym club will
be reorganized at the beginning of
next quarter. A call will be made at
that time for men to come out for the
organization and as formerly, regular
drill will be held.
Among the old clubmen on the cam
pus are Curtice, '19, Rakestraw, *17,
Owen, '19, Hutchinson, '19, and Lu
ellen, '21. These men, as well as a
number of graduates, composed the
gym team. The club trained in all
athletic activities, including basket
ball, track, gym work, wrestling, and
boxing. From this gym club many of
the athletic instructors have been
chosen in the past.
Tryoutees for the new gym class
need not have had previous experience
in athletic work.
