## 
### 
Fourteen boxes of serviceable gar
ments have been shipped for the relief
of the women and children of Belgium
and northern France, as the result of
the recent drive by the Stanford-Palo
Alto C. R. H. Over 272 pairs of shoes
wore included in the shipment, which
will be of great value to people paying
as much ns $8 to have shoes resoled.
Every Wednesday from 10 a. m. to
5 p. m.the I'alo Alto Woman's Club
will open their clubroom. The time will
he spent in fashioning clothes out of the
material brought in. These will be sent
wherever a demand is made Any
woman who can sew is urged to come
and assist. Tea will be made for all
who can spare the time to bring their
lunches and remain all day.
