# VOICES WITH A PURPOSE

P ract, ' ca ' uses an organization ceases to exist after it
>?s • •*" r loses its purpose. According to this doctrine, many organ
, J';' izations on the campus would have long ago ceased to he. The con
verse of this doctrine, then, is that where there is a purpose, there
is opportunity for an organization to exist.
Not seeking to find what organizations that are still decorating their initiates
with pins really have a right to exist, let us look for one moment at the purposes
that fail to have organizations to support them.
To call the ertswhile Stanford Glee Club an organization with a purpose
might be a stretch of the imagination, but such the Glee Club undoubtedly was.
Glee Clubs may be relics of a former collegiate era; it cannot be denied, how
ever, that a Glee Club is something still characteristic of all colleges and univer
sities. Besides being an opportunity for the concentration of otherwise trouble
some talent, a Glee Club surprisingly lends to the social and dramatic features of
a university. A Glee Club adds something to a university's name; it is something
that furnishes permanent source of amusement and entertainment; there is value
in a Glee Club to its members, there is value and use to the University. The pur
pose existing, therefore, is a good basis for its reorganization.
