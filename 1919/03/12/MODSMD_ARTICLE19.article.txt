# WHY NOT THE NAME?

l ' ie appeal was made by these columns for open criti
cism of anything that merited criticism, the Daily has
been fortunately the recipient of many letters and communications from
members of the student body upon subjects of student body inter
est. The Daily has welcomed these as being an expression of interest.
It was pointed out, however, that the writers of communications should be
known to the editor at least, since communications are addressed to the editor.
However, it was likewise noted that the names of parties writing communications
would not be divulged if the wish of the writers was to the effect that they were
not to be made known.
However, the Daily takes this opportunity of requesting people to refrain from
assuming any obviously fictitious names and urges them rather to permit their
articles to appear under the authorship of the person writing. We do not wish to
discourage communications and, in fact, urge their continuance, but we wish to
point out that for the articles appearing to have weight and force it would be a
matter of policy to have them appear under the name of the writer.
Let us have no communications, such as have been reaching us. If a com
munication is wortk publishing it is worth bearing the name of the person writing
it; if it is worth bearng this person's name, there should be no objection to the
addition of the real name to the article that appears in the "Another Viewpoint"
■column. Names will be suppressed, if it is so desired, but for the benefit of the
communication itself, let us hope there will be no need to suppress the name. If
the ideas and words are there, why not the name?
