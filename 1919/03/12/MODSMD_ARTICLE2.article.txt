# CAPTAIN WATTS CUTS NUMBER OF CREW MEN
## Large Amount of Material Forces Reduction in Both Shells 
### 
Owing to the fact that there is such
a large number of men out for crew
this season, Captain Watts has found
it necessary to make a, reduction in
the amount of material. This after
noon he is making this cut, and the
men to remain on the crew will prob
ably constitute the first and second
string shell men, until the end of the
season.
Watts is making the cut early in the
season in order that, the men whose
chances of making the final linenp
are not sufficient to warrant them
staying in college over the spring va
cation. All men remaining on the
squad will be required to stay here, in
training, during the entire vacation.
There will be no workouts next
week on account of the final examina
tions. Practices will be resumed
again at the Redwood City estuary
March 22 or 23. Freshmen affected
by the recent faculty ruling will be
permitted by the captain to get an
other chance at ere wduring the spring
vacation. None of the crew men will
be permitted to run in the Irish mar
athon, according to "Les" Rogers,
crew coach for this year.

to report for the varsity shell: Davis,
Cary, Ells, McGillvray, Moore, Wilbur,
