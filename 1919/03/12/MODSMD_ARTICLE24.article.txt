The following communication from
Lieut. Albert G. Bower, '12, at present
with the American army in Germany,
has been received in regard to the
' awarding of the distinguished service
cross to Lieutenant-Colonel Casey H.
; I'ayes, '12, who at the time of his cita
i tion was a major in command at Greves
j Farm, France:
|"7'o the Editor of the D. P. A.:
"It's a long while since 1 have had the
i pleasure of dropping a line to the above
titled gentleman, in fact not since leav
ing college, but I believe I have some
thing to relate which will be worthy
| of interest.
"On February 5, of this year, 1 re
.
ceived an order to assemble with all
other officers of these headquarters, in
! the general's private office to see the dis
tinguished service cross awarded in the
■ name of the President to an officer for
I extreme bravery.
"1 went down, having no idea who the
lucky man was, and who should it be
but my old friend and classmate, Casey
Hayes, Stanford '12, Phi Gamma Delta.
What the general said in his praise had
enough real shine to it to have bright
ened the niches Casey cut in the table
1 edge at Charlie's, back in 1912, for Casey
had a good start on the right track
even as a freshman, before they made
the United States dry and safe for the
j men of the A. E. F. to return to. Rut
I aside from this matter of so little inter
| est, you might like to have a little of
| Casey's record—that is, of the record
of Lieutenant-Colonel Hayes, now hold
| ing an extremely important position of
I great trust.
I "Casey arrived in France June 13, 1918,
as a captain in command of a detach
ment of the 10th Field Artillery, to
which regiment he belonged. He was
promoted to a major in this outfit July 3,
and he commanded the 2d Battalion in
a defensive action at Chateau Thierry
on July 14, and from then on to the
Ourcq. He commanded this same bat
talion on September 11 and 12 at St.
Mihiel and later in the first part of the
action in the Argonne Meuse. He was
ordered to General Staff College and
on November 14 promoted to lieutenant
colonel. He graduated from the staff
college in December, and was then or
dered to the fourth section of the gen
eral staff at general headquarters of the
A. E. F., and from there to the advance
section of these same headquarters in
Germany. The distinguished service
cross was awarded him February 1,
119.
"Needless to say, I'm proud of said
Casey as a friend, as a classmate, and as
a man, and I don't think it'll hurt any
; body's feelings but those that deserve it
to say that there ire others I can think
of that I am sorry to state I don't feel
j that way about. Put up the hammer.
"Yours for the Cardinal,
(Signed) "Albert G. Bower,
"Stanford '12."
Dear Editor:
The "amateur sophomore dramatic
rritic" is a profoundly sorry man, but
a grateful one. First of all. he wants
to thank "An Engineering Major" for
his interest in his article to the extent
of reading it all the way through. He
also wants to take this opportunity of
apologizing publicly for his criticism
i of the sophomore play. His only de
fense is his erroneous impression that
a critic wrote as he thought and not
as the enthusiastic friends of the cast
j thought, I suggest that you take a
straw ballot of criticisms among the
friends of the leading man or lady of
the next campus play and print the
most favorable and sirupy of the lot
as the criticism. I am,
Repentently,
R. W. KENNY, *21.
