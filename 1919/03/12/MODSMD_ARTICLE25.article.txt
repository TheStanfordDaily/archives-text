# ABOUT STANFORD

### 
The average student seldom stops to
think of conditions as they must have
been on the campus preceding and
during the first year of Stanford.
This year is often spoken of by
members of the "old guard" as one of
organization. Many of the first fac
ulty appeared in the summer months
in order to "get settled." As there
was no town of Palo Alto and only
one available house on the University
grounds, Escondite Cottage, living
proved a serious problem. During that
first year many a "prof." tramped to
his class room from Mayfield or Menlo
Park, carrying his lunch basket with
him.
Roble Hall was planned in June and
hastened to completion in September.
It was filled with girls almost before
the plaster was dry. In July workmen
were swarming through the buildings
of the Quadrangle and Alvarado Row
was part of an unbroken grain field.
The library of President Jordan at
his cottage was the first work room.

Here Registrar Elliott first set up his
office and here, on the veranda, the
first entrance examinations were held.
Three students applied, one girl, Miss
Longley passed, but the two men
failed. The first student to enroll at
Stanford was P. J. Bachelder, a trans
fer from Cornell.
Ground was broken for faculty cot
tage and Palm avenue was begun in
September.
Concrete pavements appeared in the
Quadrangle, the museum grew rapidly
and the now familiar aspect of build
ings and grounds developea. On the
opening day in October 465 students
were registered. Students listened to
lectures during that first year with
the ever present sound of chisel and
hammer coming through the windows.
A triangle suspended in an archway
sounded the change of classes, with a
musical angle. A delightful account
of this period called "The First Year"
may be found in the library, being
published in book form some years
ago by English Club.
