# H.V. AUPPERLE, EX-'17, WRITES FROM SERBIA
## Tells How College Men of Europe Drink Tea for a Diversion 
### 
Telling of a most interesting acquaint
ance with some first-hand information
as to the famous murder plot that
brought about the world war, and giving
some of the peculiarities of the colleges
of that country where he is now located,
a letter has been received from Harold
V. Aupperle, ex-'l7, who is now in Bel
grade, after eighteen months spent in
the Balkan country.
Portions of the letter is as follows:
"Belgrade, Serviea,
"Jan. 26. 1919.
"This week has been a very busy one
and very satisfactory as well. I like the
work here at Belgrade much better than
at Salonica and am surely kept busy.
I am now aide to Colonel Farnham, and
it keeps me on the jump. We will
leave before long for a trip to Salonica
via Mitrovitza, and I am looking for
ward to it with pleasure, as T am not
acquainted much with the interior of
Servia. We will go by auto to Mitro
vitza and take the train from there down
through Uskub and Vcles."
At this point in the letter Aupperle
told of meeting the sister of the youth
that did the shooting in the murder plot
which was the proximate cause of the
world war. He explained that the plot
ters were mere boys, and it is hard for
Americans to realize how they could
have committed such a deed. Tt must
be borne in mind that both boys and
girls mature much earlier in this coun
try than in our own, and also that the
life of the students is much different.
Students here interest themselves al
most solely with economic and political
quesions. College athleics are unknown,
and it is the little coffee houses and
wine shops that the students frequent
instead of the athletic fields as with us.
I bis is true of all central Europe, as
near as I can learn, although those with
whom 1 have talked here readily aeree
that the American and English system
of college sports is much preferable.
"Well, it is almost noon and I have a
date to take lunch with an officer of the
new Bohemian army. He was formerly
in the Servian army, having deserted
into Russia from the Austrian forces at
the outbreak of the war and worked
his way around to Servia via Archanprel
and England. Will write again as soon
as I get material for an interesting
letter. Good luck to everyone.
H. V. AuprF.RLE,
"Belgrade, Servia."
