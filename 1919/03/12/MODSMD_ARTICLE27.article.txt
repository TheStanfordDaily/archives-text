# PROGRAM OF MUSIC PLEASES AUDIENCE AT ASSEMBLY HALL
## 
### 
With the last notes of Randegger's
"Pierrot Serenade" still ringing in their
ears, the audience who heard Nathan
Landsberger and Warren D. Allen last
night at Assembly Hall left the building
with a feeling of gratitude for an even
ing well spent. The quaint sympathy of
his hearers and his generous response
to all encores was no small factor in
making the program a success. Those
who have heard Mr. Allen on the Me
morial church organ thought he could
play, but after his rendering of Mr.
Landsberger's accompaniments last night
there is no longer any doubtâ€”he can
olay, and in a way to bring out all the
best in the music.
The expressive emotional quality and
true youthful fervor of Mr. Lands
bcr' er, despite his wrinkled brow and
his whitened locks combined in unusual
ly perfect balance. His old-fashioned
daintiness and his friendly smile dif
fused an atmosphere intimately artistic.
Playing in such perfect harmony, both
Mr. Allen as accompanist and Pro
fessor Landsbersrer had such an ability
to ii/erpret the true spirit of music, that
thev c.mld not fail to establish them
selves fin.-'y in the good graces of music
lovers.
