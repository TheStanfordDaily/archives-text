Cliff Ireland Intends bringing down
a better aggregation Saturday than lie
had yesterday. Now that he knows
the mettle of the varsity, there will
be no fooling in Saturday's game; this
ought to be a battle from the firtt.
Cliff was in good humor yesterday
and handed out a good line of chatter
along the first base line all during the
game. Reports that Cliff had his bat
ting eye back were vindicated when
he got. a safe blow to left the first
time up the "youngster" looks like he
was due for a successful season with
the willow.

"Mush" Stevens figured in a nice
double play in the fourth inning. With
a man on first the batter lined a hot
one down third base. "Mush" speared
it with one hand and with a snap
throw doubled the man on first.
Let us havo some good umpiring in
Saturday's game. The big leaguers
are good sports and didn't crab, al
though some of the decisions looked
bad from the bleachers.
