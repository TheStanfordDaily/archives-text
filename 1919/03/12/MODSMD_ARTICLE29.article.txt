# PENINSULAR CONCERT NEXT MONDAY NIGHT
## Chamber Music Society Was Organized from Former Quintet Club 
### 
The Chamber Music Society of San
I-rancisco, which appears as the third nf
the Peninsula Musical Association's at
tractions next Monday evening, March
17, was founded early in 1911 under the
name of the San Francisco Quintet Club,
the prime mover being Elias M. Hecht.
There was at that time no thought of
public appearance, the members simply
coming together at Mr. Hecht's home
once or twice a week to read through,
study, and discuss the various classical
and modern chamber music works.
Their interest soon developed to the
point of daily rehearsals, and in the
winter of 1912 the Pacific Musical So
ciety, hearing of the artistic private
work of the organization, engaged it to
play at one of their evening concerts.
Their success was instantaneous; pub
lic and private critics alike were delight
ed with the wonderful blend, youthful
fervor, and smooth ensemble of the play
ers, and a leading manager promptly
placed the organization on his schedule.
The first season was a great success,
and with daily rehearsals during the
summer, the ensemble was further de
veloped, so that the second season was
even more successful. The organization
found itself in demand for out-of-town
engagements, which it could not always
fill, and the present season has set-n a
multiplication of dates which has neces
sitated the Palo Alto association's tak
ing Monday instead of the customary
Thursday for the local concert.
