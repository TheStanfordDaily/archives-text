# UNDERCLASSMEN FILLED WITH "JAZZ" AT MEETING
## PLAN TO "GET ON BOAT" "Les" Rogers, '17, Urges a More Hearty Support of Athletics 
### 
The need of an awakening among
the underclassmen of the University
and a better mutual understanding
between students and faculty was the
keynote of the freshman-sophomore
"enthusiasm" meeting held last night.
That student government could be
successfully inaugurated only among
wideawake and responsible students
was brought home in the numerous
speeches by upperclassmen.
W. I. Ames, '18, vice-president of the
student body, presided at the meeting
and called on "Les" Rogers, '17, to
open the discussion.
Outlined Situation
Rogers spoke of the present indiffer-.
ence of the students to activities in
general and especially that of under
classmen toward athletics. He empha
sized the fact that the type of Stan
ford man had been changing since the
war and asked the lower classes to get
awake and help bring back the "once
upon a time" spirit.
F. W. Williamson, '19, was the sec
ond speaker. He met the issues of
the present situation squarely in ad
mitting that Stanford spirit was in a
slump. Too much indifference is the
reason for the failure of student gov
ernment in the past, he said, "and an
awakening is necessary before it will
ever be successful." He believed that
better mutual understandings between
the students and faculty would be one
th 3 best ways to solve the present
problems.
Must "Get on the oBat"
That the underclassmen need to "get
on the boat," become acquainted wtih
Stanford, its ideals, and its type of
men of past years was the admonition
of the chairman when he introduced
the remaining speakers.
Frank Watts, '19, crew captain and
"Crackie" Teitsworth, '19, track cap
tain, finished the talks for the evening.
Watts emphasized the fact that the
students need to wake up, get out for
some activity and back it.
Teitsworth spoke again of the need
of a closer mutual understanding be
tween faculty and students and made
a call for more track candidates for
both freshmen and varsity teams.
