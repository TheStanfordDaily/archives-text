# NO BLOCK LETTERS FOR RUGBY MEN, SAYS PETITION
## "S" MEN TAKE STAND Call for Assembly to Act on the Student Council Motion 
### 
That the rugby men who played
against California should not receive the
varsity "S" is the stand which has been
taken by several varsity "S" men in a
petition circulated on the campus last
night and today. The Student Council
at its regular meeting last Tuesday voted
rugby a major sport for this year, and
it is to this action that the petition ob
jects.
The fact that the lack of interest in
rugby and the short period of training
which the men went through does not
place rugby on the same basis as in past
years, is the reason assigned for oppos
ing the Student Council's action.
The petition states that a student body
meeting should lie called in the near fu
ture. at which time the sentiment of the
entire student body can be secured on
the subject.
Following is the petition:
"We, the undersigned varsity "S"
men, wish to declare ourselves un
qualifiedly opposed to the granting
of the block S to the men who
played on the rugby team against
California 011 February 22d. We be
lieve this action on the part of the
Student Council is such an error as
to warrant a special student body
vote 011 the matter.
"We take this stand because we
believe the standard should not be
lowered by short periods of training
or by such a lack of interest as was
shown in this game.
