# STANFORD NINE LOSES SPEEDY GAME TO THE SEALS
## LOCALS STAGGER IN 7TH Cardinal Team Leads Seals a Merry Chase in First Innings of Game 
### 
NINE errors allowed the San Fran
cisco Seals to score five runs
against the Stanford varsity yesterday
| afternoon and win the game by the
score of 5 to 1. Gillis let the Coast
Leaguers down with six hits, and if he
had heen given air-tight support the
varsity would have probably won the
game.
The Seals scored in the first inning
'on an error and a single to center,
j Stanford scored in the fifth when Ste
-1 vens crossed the plate after registering
a hit to left field. Casey Smith, the
Seal pitcher, pitched shut-out hall dur
ing his four innings in the box, and
the only Stanford run was made on the
curves of Dimmock, the one time star
for the University of California, who
occupied the box during the last three
innings.
In the seventh inning the varsity con
tracted a streak of errors, after they
had been playing first-class baseball, and
four runs were scored. A three-base
smash by Corhan, the Seal shortstop,
and singles by Harper and Connolly
accounted for part of the four runs.
The Stanford hitters annexed five
blows from the offerings of the Seal
twirlers. Stevens. Captain Galloway,
Newlands and Bundy were the men who
hit safely.
The cardinal infielders worked like
veterans and the combination of Stev
ens, Kallam, Doe and Galloway looked
good. One double play was executed in
which Galloway and Doe tigured.
Saturday afternoon the varsity will
play Cliff Ireland's Independents again.
Saturday has been declared "Ireland's
Independents Day,"and the baseball game
j will be played after the Irish marathon
I race. Ireland intends to bring several
new men down for the game, including
"Dutch" Leonard, the Boston Red Sox
southpaw twirler, said to be the best
left-handed pitcher in the big leagues.
Leonard is a former St. Mary's pitcher.
