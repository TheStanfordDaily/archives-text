# SETTLED IN A BALLOT BOX

l ' lc act ' on ta^cn by tlie Student Council at a meeting
the other evening in deciding to award the block "S"
to men playing in the recent rugby contest against California, discus
sion pro and con of this action has been rampant. From out of ex
pressed dissatisfaction wtih the Council's decision has come a petition suggesting
the holding of a student body election to decide upon the subject.
That there is dissatisfaction with the ruling to award the coveted "S" to men
playing in the featureless game against California, there can be little doubt after
such open discussion as has taken place the last few days. Undoubtedly, how
ever, there is some support for the action of the Council. If so, there is but one
possible solution, and that has already been suggested by the petition from the
varsity men published this evening. The only solution of the problem is an open
test of student opinion. A student body election on the subject should be held at
the earliest possible moment to settle the question now and for all time.
The "S" is the highest tribute that Stanford pays its athletes. As such, the
"S" is voted by the Student Council; when this body is unable to act in the man
ner called for by the students, or where the sentiment is evenly divided upon the
question, then there is no other solution than an open test of student sentiment.
This test cannot fail in determining the will of the sovereign student body in the
award of its highest.
Let us then have a student election upon the question. There are two ways
of calling such an election: cither by the petition of fifty members of the student
body, or by the call of the student body President; the latter person should hardly
wait for a petition. He has heard discussion undoubtedly of the question; it is
within the scope of his duty and power -to put the matter up to the students them
selves; let's settle the question in the ballot box.
