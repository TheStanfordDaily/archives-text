# FRESHMEN AND SPRING

### 
«<wwpiHMOT the advent of spring each year and the appearance of
m-Wnice green grass and all the other equipment attendant
upon spring, the freshmen of the Daily Palo Alto staff appropriately
blossom forth in the green garb of a freshman and spring.
The difficulties and worries of one issue of the Daily Palo Alto are being
entrusted to the delicate care of the freshmen of the staff by the older men thereon
in the hopes that the young blood will continue in the footsteps of precedent and
publish a green sheet that will rival in freshness and verdant charm those that
have preceded it. It is not a vain boast, nor is it modesty, that prompts us to add
that the freshmen, despite the greenness of the sheet, present more real laughs
than even the unintended errors of other editions.
It is hoped that the freshmen will make good use of the responsibility entrust
ed to them; the laughs or the groans for tomorrow's issue go to the freshmen.
