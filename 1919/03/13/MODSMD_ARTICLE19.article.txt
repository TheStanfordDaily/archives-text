Dear Editor:
It seems necessary to back the Stu
dent Council's action by a word or
two. It is to be regretted that satis
factory action regarding the rugby
situation was not taken prior to the
game against the University of Cali
fornia. As it was, the council did the
only tiling that could be done, support
the major sport policy of the past year
and not originate a new one after the
rugby season was closed. The means
that is at present being sought to recall
the action of the Student Council in
[granting the block "S" to nineteen rugby
men for two weeks' work is the only
satisfactory action that can be taken
under present conditions. When men
work years for their letter they feel dis
satisfied to see others win theirs in two
weeks; when the coast and captain of a
rugby squad are opposed to granting the
coveted block "S" to a chosen team;
when the major portion of the team
feel that they do not deserve the prize
that was granted them, and when the
largest per cent of the student body feel
that rugby as carried on this year was
not on a major sport basis, the only
satisfactory action is to follow up the
petition that is being published in to
day's2paper by a student body vote. Let's
have it.
