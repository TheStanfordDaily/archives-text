### C.E.R., '19 
Coach Evans is working hard to de
velop the hitting strength of the club.
All the men have been meeting the
ball on the nose in the last two games
and as long as they hit the ball the
safeties are bound to come.

Captain Galloway had a good day
yesterday at the bat and in the field.
He fielded his position in good style
and it was his long single to left In
the fourth inning which scored Stev
ens from second.

The boys took rather kindly to Dim
mock's offerings. In every inning he
pitched they were able to get a man
around to third, but the necessary hit
was not forthcoming.

In the sixth inning Newlands nailed
a man at the plate with as pretty a
throw from left as any one could
wish to see.
**»*•••
Kallam at short speared a liner In
the fifth inning that looked good for a
hit in any league.
