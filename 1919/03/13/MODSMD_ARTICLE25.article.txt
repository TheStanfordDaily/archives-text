# ALDA IS TO SING AT ASSEMBLY HALL ON 27TH OF MARCH
## 
### 
Madame Frances Alda, the famous
Metropolitan soprano, who will sing at
the Assembly Hall on Thursday evening.
March 27, has sung at thirty concerts for
charitable movements in addition to her
concert work this season.
It was Mme. Alda who arranged the
mammoth benefit for Uncle Sam's jackies
given at the Metropolitan Opera House
the evening of June 10, the proceeds of
which went to supply the men of the
navy with everything needed in the way
of music. Five tenors appeared in
Mme. Alda's concert, including Caruso,
John McCormack, Giovanni Martinelli,
Hipolito Lazaro and Lucien Muratore.
Mischa Elman, the violinist, and Harold
Bauer, the pianist, also appeared. The
trio from Faust, the quartet from Rigo
letto, and the sextette from Luccia were
each sung by double sets of singers.
Those taking part were Mme. Alda,
Claudio Muzio, Sophie Braslau, Anna
Case, Mabel Garrison, Kathleen How
ard, Lenora Sparks, Amado Didur, An
tonio Scotti Pasquale Amato, Leon
Rothier, Giuseppe de Luca, Andreas de
Segurola, John McCormack, Giovanni
Martinelli, Enrico Caruso, Hipolito
Lazaro and Lucien Muratore. Mme.
Alda also supplied the Metropolitan
Opera House orchestra and the bands
of the United States Marine Corps with
Lieut. John Phillip Sousa conducting,
and Roberto Moranzotii and Pierre
Monttaux conducted the Metropolitan
orchestra, and the full chorus of the
opera company. Ethel Barrymore re
cited. and the closing feature of Mme.
Alda's mammoth concert was living
statuary, symbolizing "The Spiril of the
Navy."
Alda's amazing versatility is one of
her most conspicuous gifts. A mere
list of the operas in which she has sus
tained leading soprano roles would fill
a paragraph. She has made over forty
red seal records for the Victor, among
which are the famous Trovatore-Mise
rere duet with Caruso, Chanson
d'Amour by Bizet, and Gounod's Ave
Maria.
Mme. Alda made a splendid impres- [
sion when she appeased at Stanford a
few years ago. Like McCormack and
Galli Curci, she is under the manage
ment of Charles L. Wagner and the
local management of Frank W Healy.
