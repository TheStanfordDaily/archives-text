# Feg Murray Draws Cover of Purity Girl for Chappie
## 
### 
"Fcg" Murray, '16, has drawn the
Cover of the "Purity" issue of Chaparral
I which will appear on the Quad next
i Tuesday. This work was done while
; Murray was in France, and typifies the
I Purity Girl, according to his lights. Ihe
! work will appear in live colors, blue,
j black, pink, yellow, and white, making
altogether a beautiful combination.
The frontispiece is "A Toast to the
Purity Girl." The entire issue is moved
by a spirit of purity, even in the matter
of poetry, which predominates over the
other material in the book. No free
verse is to appear, nothing but that
which is animated by a pure, classic
spirit will be in Chappie's "Purity" issue.
"It Could Have Been Better, if It
Hadn't Been so Bad" is the title of one
nonsensical jingle. Starting with this
issue. "Crazylogucs," a new feature of
limericks, and short bits of verse by
"Abner" Glikbarg, '19, will be instituted.
There are four editors in the issue in
stead of the usual three, because of the
fact that the staff is doing its own
editing ni the absence of "Les" Levy, 19.
"Monk" Antrim, '19, has contributed
his usual two-page series of cartoons,
this one being of a sensational nature,
entitled "It's Hell to Be Pure." The
j "Purity" issue will be out just before
[ final examinations. The Chappie staff
' promises that their own issue will be a
I relief for the brain-weary. It will be
on sale on the Quad I uesday.
