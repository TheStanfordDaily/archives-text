# UNDERCLASSMEN LOOK STRONG FOR MARATHON
## Holdover Stunts to Precede the Annual Six-Mile Classic 
### 
That the real contest for Irish mara
thon honors will probably be between
the freshmen and sophomore classes was
developed in the tryouts last night. Both
the juniors and seniors have a collection
of good men, however, and their com
bined teams will be able to give the
underclassmen a hard race.
Twenty-one candidates for the fresh
man team covered the distance last night
in an average of 59 seconds. The sopho
more candidates made their average in
a little over 5.S seconds. Both teams
have good men who have not yet been
timed for quarter mile, and the winning
team should be able to reduce the time
per lap Saturday to an average of about
57 seconds.
The junior-senior combination has
some of the fastest men in the Uni
versity but will hardly be able to keep
up the average and will put up a hard
light if they can get a few more good
I runners to keep up their average.
Captain Teitsworth has set the time
for the marathon at 2:30 sharp Satur
day afternoon. The holdover show will
precede the race, and various stunts will
be held on the baseball field immediately
i after its conclusion.
As usual, the Quadrangle Club will
offer two gold medals. One will be
J awarded to the varsity runner who cov-
I ers tiie quarter mile in the fastest time
! and the other to the best non-varsity
! man.
