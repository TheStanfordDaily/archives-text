# Freshmen Sure to Win the Annual Irish Marathon
## UPPERCLASSMEN COMBINE "FEG" MURRAY HAS NOT DECIDED CLASS TO RUN FOR 
### 
Marathon, will be staged on the track
Tomorrow afternoon at 2:30 Stan
ford's annual relay classic, the Irish
oval. At present, the track is in poor
condition, but if it does not rain tonight,
it is hoped that it will not be necessary
to postpone the race.
The real race will probably be between
the underclass teams. The upperclass
men are having considerable trouble in
getting enough men together for even
one team, and will probably have to use
several slow men in order to have the
necessary twenty-four men on the track.
The FRESHMEN team has the best
chance of winning the marathon this
spring. The class of 1917 is the only
class that has ever won the relay in their
FRESHMAN year, but by tomorrow the
honor will be a duel one, shared by the
classes of '17 and '22. In the tryouts,
thirty babes showed up, and their aver
age time was a little under fifty-eight
onds. Several of the men are doing 55
and 56, and it is expected that one or
two of the first-year men will do 53,
or better, in the race. Gerson ,Larson,
and Faville are among the best of the
FRESHMEN in the quarter mile. They
all did between 55 and 56 in the tryouts
and should better this time when they
run tomorrow.
The sophomores have several very
good men, but lack second string men
to back their good up. This lack of
second string men will probably mean
the defeat of the class of '21 by "the
grandest and most glorious class 1922."
Baxter Sharp made the best time in the
tryouts, running 440 in 53 3/5 seconds.
He was not pressed in his heat of the
tryouts and will probably better this
time in the race. Carlsmith, the sopho
more captain. Thrash, and Hertel also
made good time in the preliminaries.
The average time of the sophomore
team, however, is slower than the
FRESHMEN time of about 58 seconds.
It will be necessary for the juniors
and seniors to combine and enter as an
npperclass team. The lack of available
runners in either class made this action
necessary. Maynard and Westwick will
captain, jointly, the team representing
the classes of 1918 and 1919. Dinkel
spiel. Dells, and Teitsworth have been
showing exceptionally well in the try
outs and should make a good bid for
the varsity medal.
"Feg" Murray lias promised to run,
and will compete for the team that most
needs his services. From present ap
pearances lie will probably represent the
upperclassmen Tn case Maynard and
Westwick succeed in having twenty-four
men ready to run at 2:30. Murray will
undoubtedly help out the FRFSTTMAN
runners.
Mark F.vans will run for the sopho
mores. In rubbing down the men, he
lias noticed that the class of '21 needs
his services more than any other team
in the race tomorrow, and so has con
sented to run for next fall's wearers of
the cords.
Two medals will be given to the men
who make the best tiir° •" Iri^h
marathon. The varsity akes
the best time will rece the

medals, the other going to the non
varsity man making the distance in the
shortest space of time. Maynanl won
the non-varsity medal last spring, and
has a good chance of capturing the
varsity trophy this year. Carlsmith.
Hertel. and Sharp will probably fight
it out for the nnn-vnrcitv

needs his services. From present ap
pearances lie will probably represent the
upperclassmen Tn case Maynard and
Westwick succeed in having twenty-four
men ready to run at 2:30. Murray will
undoubtedly help out the FRFSTTMAN
runners.
Mark F.vans will run for the sopho
mores. In rubbing down the men, he
lias noticed that the class of '21 needs
his services more than any other team
in the race tomorrow, and so has con
sented to run for next fall's wearers of
the cords.
Two medals will be given to the men
who make the best tiir° •" Iri^h
marathon. The varsity akes
the best time will rece the

medals, the other going to the non
varsity man making the distance in the
shortest space of time. Maynanl won
the non-varsity medal last spring, and
has a good chance of capturing the
varsity trophy this year. Carlsmith.
Hertel. and Sharp will probably fight
it out for the nnn-vnrcitv
Marathon, will be staged on the track
Tomorrow afternoon at 2:30 Stan
ford's annual relay classic, the Irish
oval. At present, the track is in poor
condition, but if it does not rain tonight,
it is hoped that it will not be necessary
to postpone the race.
The real race will probably be between
the underclass teams. The upperclass
men are having considerable trouble in
getting enough men together for even
one team, and will probably have to use
several slow men in order to have the
necessary twenty-four men on the track.
The FRESHMEN team has the best
chance of winning the marathon this
spring. The class of 1917 is the only
class that has ever won the relay in their
FRESHMAN year, but by tomorrow the
honor will be a duel one, shared by the
classes of '17 and '22. In the tryouts,
thirty babes showed up, and their aver
age time was a little under fifty-eight
onds. Several of the men are doing 55
and 56, and it is expected that one or
two of the first-year men will do 53,
or better, in the race. Gerson ,Larson,
and Faville are among the best of the
FRESHMEN in the quarter mile. They
all did between 55 and 56 in the tryouts
and should better this time when they
run tomorrow.
The sophomores have several very
good men, but lack second string men
to back their good up. This lack of
second string men will probably mean
the defeat of the class of '21 by "the
grandest and most glorious class 1922."
Baxter Sharp made the best time in the
tryouts, running 440 in 53 3/5 seconds.
He was not pressed in his heat of the
tryouts and will probably better this
time in the race. Carlsmith, the sopho
more captain. Thrash, and Hertel also
made good time in the preliminaries.
The average time of the sophomore
team, however, is slower than the
FRESHMEN time of about 58 seconds.
It will be necessary for the juniors
and seniors to combine and enter as an
npperclass team. The lack of available
runners in either class made this action
necessary. Maynard and Westwick will
captain, jointly, the team representing
the classes of 1918 and 1919. Dinkel
spiel. Dells, and Teitsworth have been
showing exceptionally well in the try
outs and should make a good bid for
the varsity medal.
"Feg" Murray lias promised to run,
and will compete for the team that most
needs his services. From present ap
pearances lie will probably represent the
upperclassmen Tn case Maynard and
Westwick succeed in having twenty-four
men ready to run at 2:30. Murray will
