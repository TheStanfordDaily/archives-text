Program for Ireland's Independ
ents' Day at a Glance:
2 p.m.—Holdover Show.
2:30. p.m.—lrish Marathon.
3 p.m.—Freak races and chicken
catch.
3:30 p.m.—Baseball—Stanford vs.
Ireland's Independents.
7 p.m.—Banquet for baseball men
at Union.
8 p.m.—Smoker upstairs in
Union.

Ireland's Independents' Day will be
full of spectacular events, and will hold
especial interest for all Cardinal men
this year, when, for the twenty-seventh
time. Cliff Ireland brings his ball players
to the campus on Saturday. No one can
certainly accuse the day of being lacking
in events, and if old Jupiter Pluvius
holds off his thunderclouds, the features
planned may be carried out. The hold
over show will be staged at the track
field at 2 o'clock Saturday afternoon;
the Irish Marathon will follow at 2:30.
The freak races and chicken catch are
scheduled for 3 o'clock, and the baseball
game for 3:30.
Cliff Ireland and his Independents
will be the hosts at a banquet, which will
be given at the Union at 7 o'clock, to all
who have ever played on Stanford base
ball teams since 1892. when Cliff first
visited the campus. This dinner will be
the reunion of many old-timers, and over
a hundred are expected to attend. As
guests of honor are none other than the
Seals, who will come down as Cliff's
guests to celebrate the return of Stan
ford men from the service.
Immediately after the banquet a smok

er will be held, to which all members of
the University are invited. A lively pro
gram for the evening has been arranged,
and Monk' Antrim is in charge of an
entertainment to he given by campus tal
ent. Cliff Ireland and Kennedy, the In
dependents' first baseman, will be the
chief speakers. Several boxing and
wrestling matches have also been ar
ranged for by the committee in charge
of the evening.
Ireland's Day has always been a part
of Stanford tradition in past years, and
although Cliff Ireland is not a Stanford
man himself, he has always shown him
self a true friend of the Cardinal. At
Tuesday's game with the Independents
only a handful of spectators witnessed
the victory of the Reds, and it is hoped
that a large number will turn out for
Saturday's events.
The first event will be the holdover
show, and owing to the large number of
holdovers in college the affair should be
a success. "Chuck" Kerr, '18, is in
charge of the show and promises thea
tre-lovers a good performance. Follow
ing the holdover show, will begin the
Irish Marathon, for many years a feature
of the Independents' Day, in which twen
ty-four men compete from each class.
The baseball game will be the chief event
of the afternoon. Ireland is bringing
down some new men to try on Stanford,
to get revenge for last Tuesday's de
feat. including Reuther, a pitcher of
considerable ' speed; Harry Heilman,
famous batsman; and Krause, a pitcher
who will be pitted against the local nine
if O'Doul gives out.

ents' Day at a Glance:
2 p.m.—Holdover Show.
2:30. p.m.—lrish Marathon.
3 p.m.—Freak races and chicken
catch.
3:30 p.m.—Baseball—Stanford vs.
Ireland's Independents.
7 p.m.—Banquet for baseball men
at Union.
8 p.m.—Smoker upstairs in
Union.

Ireland's Independents' Day will be
full of spectacular events, and will hold
especial interest for all Cardinal men
this year, when, for the twenty-seventh
time. Cliff Ireland brings his ball players
to the campus on Saturday. No one can
certainly accuse the day of being lacking
in events, and if old Jupiter Pluvius
holds off his thunderclouds, the features
planned may be carried out. The hold
over show will be staged at the track
field at 2 o'clock Saturday afternoon;
the Irish Marathon will follow at 2:30.
The freak races and chicken catch are
scheduled for 3 o'clock, and the baseball
game for 3:30.
Cliff Ireland and his Independents
will be the hosts at a banquet, which will
be given at the Union at 7 o'clock, to all
who have ever played on Stanford base
ball teams since 1892. when Cliff first
visited the campus. This dinner will be
the reunion of many old-timers, and over
a hundred are expected to attend. As
guests of honor are none other than the
Seals, who will come down as Cliff's
guests to celebrate the return of Stan
ford men from the service.
Immediately after the banquet a smok

er will be held, to which all members of
the University are invited. A lively pro
gram for the evening has been arranged,
and Monk' Antrim is in charge of an
entertainment to he given by campus tal
ent. Cliff Ireland and Kennedy, the In
dependents' first baseman, will be the
chief speakers. Several boxing and
wrestling matches have also been ar
ranged for by the committee in charge
of the evening.
Ireland's Day has always been a part
of Stanford tradition in past years, and
although Cliff Ireland is not a Stanford
man himself, he has always shown him
self a true friend of the Cardinal. At
Tuesday's game with the Independents
only a handful of spectators witnessed
the victory of the Reds, and it is hoped
that a large number will turn out for
Saturday's events.
The first event will be the holdover
show, and owing to the large number of
holdovers in college the affair should be
a success. "Chuck" Kerr, '18, is in
charge of the show and promises thea
tre-lovers a good performance. Follow
ing the holdover show, will begin the
Irish Marathon, for many years a feature
of the Independents' Day, in which twen
ty-four men compete from each class.
The baseball game will be the chief event
of the afternoon. Ireland is bringing
down some new men to try on Stanford,
to get revenge for last Tuesday's de
feat. including Reuther, a pitcher of
considerable ' speed; Harry Heilman,
famous batsman; and Krause, a pitcher
who will be pitted against the local nine
if O'Doul gives out.
