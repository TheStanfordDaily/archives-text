# Queening at Roble Cause Scathing Rebuke For Scandalous Poster Scenes
## 
### 
The old "after meeting" custom of
criticising been revived at Roble.
It seems that in the good old days,
when true upperclass discipline
reigned supreme, the fair upperclass
flamsels criticised publicly, after every
house meeting, little indiscreet acts of
the lower classmen. The custom has
come into its own once more.
Tuesday night, as the meeting was
nearing a close, one maiden arose, and
addressed "Madame President" in a
most impressive manner, begging per
mission to kindle anew the old words
of advice. Permission granted, she
faced the wondering audience, and in
stern tones the shocking criticism is
sued forth, "Girls, if you have to muss
your boy friend's hair and hold his
hand, retire in privacy and enjoy your
self, but the front parlor is hardly the
place to stage such scenes."
The offensive bit of criticism was
received on "all sides by gasps of as
tonishment. No names were men
tioned. The question that is now up
permost in every innocent "Robleite's"
mind is, "Who's guilty?"
