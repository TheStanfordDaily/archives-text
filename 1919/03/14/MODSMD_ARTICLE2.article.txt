## 
### 
Marching out of a class meeting in
columns of fours, California's fresh
men put her sophomores to rout. The
battle took place 011 the sophomore's
lawn, which has, from time immemo
rial, been held sacred by that class.
It has been rumored that several sec
ond-year men have been seen slinking
along the California campus well
swathed in bandages with a halo of
arnica following them hither and
thither, wherever they might go.
The freshmen were well organized,
as are all freshmen, and when they
emerged from the hall the sophomores
were stricken with fear. On, 011 went
that band of heroes, until they felt
the turf beneath their feet. They
stopped and tossed the few enemies
who had not already fled oif the lawn.
Then right merrily they set to and
kicked up the grass, even to the last
blade.
When last heard from, the sopho
mores were raising a fund to set up a
tablet to commemorate the "Lawn."
