# OUR POLICY AND CAPS
## 
### 
Contrary to the usual policy of the "FRESHMAN ISSUE," which is to
razz every one in general -.and the class that happens to occupy the position
of the sophomore class in particular, we will endeavor to publish a Bheet that
cannot hurt the feelings or be objectionable to any â€¢one. But despite our firm
resolve to keep to the straight and narrow path, we cannot help but remark
on the cap that is worn by some of the members of the class of 1921.
We weren't going to take any notice of the unworthy class of '21 at first
but the caps are of such brilliant hues and so harmonizing in color, that not
to mention them would be a crime that would be beyond recall. If we are
rightly informed, no other class has ever had any caps that are so worthy of
notice.
A short time ago an upperclassman was heard to remark that he was
going to buy up all the stock of "official 1921 caps," that the members of the
class has refused to wear, and take them home with him. He then went on
to say that he did not love the caps or the sophomores himmself, but that
he could make a fortune selling them to the colored element in"the home
town."
Now, we wouldn't have had the audacity to say such things about the
haberdashery of the sophomores, but following the principal that words of
wisdom, and only words of wisdom, flow from the mouths of the wearers of
cords, we cannot but take the above remark at its face value.
