Tho opening words of the firßt editorial of the "Freshman Issue" of the
class of 1920 were, "We are presenting to you today, the Freshman Issue Ol
the Daily Palo Alto, undoubtedly the best paper that has ever been published
at Stanford University." We agree that up to that time they might have
been right, and will let them have that small honor. But the claim that is
put forth now 1b that the "FRESHMAN ISSUE" of the Daily Palo Alto, pub
lished by the grand and glorious class of 1922 is not only the best issue of
the paper that has yet been published, but we are confident that it will remain
the best for yearß to come.
Realizing the responsibility, that is, that we must provide laughs and
groans for the campus for a day, we hereby present this edition to the world.
Let come what may, we'll stand to our guns even though we'be taken to the
lake for It.
