Being a reeder of newspapers and col
lege literachure, I suppose you have
learned how the FRESHMAN class is
becoming like Mr. Finnigan, so cele
brated in poetry and song, but don't
worry, we are at the in-again lap, just
now, and yoor son will once more be a
student at Young Leland's University on
April's Fool Day.
All the trouble started when my older
brothers in Skwasha Fli told me and
the rest of the innocence that we would
have to give a birthday peracie in honor
of the late mr. Washington. And I'll
bet. if he'da seen it, he wouldn't have
been honored at all. The idea was to
put on something pneu and startling
& it even startled me. I was represent
ing Venos, Rising from the Mist, but
of corse there wasn't any mist there
at all. Gosh, pop, I'll bet your glad
you went to school when you did, so
that ybu wouldn't get suspended for
doing nothinat all like me.
Well, pop, I am going to need a lot
of money next month. Hoping there is
a lot of checks around the country and
that you will send
Yours quickly.
