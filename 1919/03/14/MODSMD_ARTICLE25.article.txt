"This year's administration of the
class of '22 will be characterized by
strength, dispatch in attending to busi
ness, and by efficie?icy," was the key
!er's interview to a representative of
the Daily Palo Alto last night,
note of FRESHMAN President Fend-
He further stated that an attempt has
been made to do away with the com
mon weaknesses and disinterestedness
of scholastic committees, which are a
very scholastic committees, which though
a very important part of the class organi
zation are usually very inefficient. How
ever, the FRESHMAN class has used
discrimination in this department,
selecting those who are imbued with
the enthusiasm of the administration,
and will co-operate with it in the fullest
All of the activities are backed with
the whole-hearted support of Mr. Fend
ler. He takes a personal interest, doing
what he can for each in the way of sup
port and helpful suggestions. The jolly
up has interested him far more than any
ordinary class president. He has thought
up many new stunts to please and sur
prise the students at the coming func
tion.
The president is not one whom you
would naturally pick out of a crowd
as a leader. He is small, wiry and not
bad looking. There is a gleam of
joviality and good humor in his blue
eyes. His forehead is broad and low,
denoting great forensic ability and a
great strength of virile masculinity. He
is a common man, destined to be the
man of the people and the leader of the
people.
