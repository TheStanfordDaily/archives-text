New U. S. Stamp
On Issue at Postoffice
Victory three cent postage stamps
may be now obtained at the Palo Alto
postoffice, to those who make a spe
cial request. Stamp collectors, take
notice. The supply is very small.
A standing figure of Liberty vic
torious, helmeted, the upper part of
her body encased ni scale armor, and
a flowing skirt falling to her feet, is
presented on a purple stamp .about
1 x 3-4 inch in size. The right hand
grasps a word, the point of which
rests on the ground at her feet; the
left arm is partially extended, and the
hand holds a balance scale, represent
ing justice.
Back of the figure appears the
American flag, at the left are draped
the British and Belgian flags, at the
right the tlalian and French flags.
One letter free, in every three, will
be the rule after July 1. 1919, when the
two-cent postage rate goes into effect.
