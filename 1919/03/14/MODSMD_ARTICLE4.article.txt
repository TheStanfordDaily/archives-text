# CHALLENGE IS ISSUED FOR A BEAUTY CONTEST
## To Settle Dispute Next Quarter 
### F.S. REEDER, '22 
I am positive that I am the most handsome young lady amongst
the 500. There are several that doubt my supremacy along the beauty
lines, so I hereby defy them with an open challenge to meet me in a
beauty contest.

MISS CUTIE SWENSON, '20.

The above is a copy of a challenge which Miss Cutie Swenson, '20, wished
the editor of the Daily Palo Alto to make public, in an endeavor to settle the
long-disputed question as to whether or not she was the beauty queen of the
campus.
Miss Swenson is a short, although not too short, young person (that is,
she claims to be young), with light brown hair and a pleasing complexion.
She has one of those pleasing temperaments that must always go along with
such a chubby, moonshaped face.
After an interview with Miss Swenson, it was ascertained that there were
four other beauties on the campus that claimed equal honors with her. Prob
ably the most notable of these is Miss L. W. Donkeysqueal, '20, who was once
a dippy editor of some small town paper. Neither of these two young people
are members of any sorority; however, it is rumored that Miss Donkeysqueal

is being rushed by one of the leading
sororities 011 the row. The last state
ment is based on the grounds that she
is continually hanging around the
ladies of a certain house.
It was only after deep deliberation,
and much concentration that Miss
Swensen gave out the names of the
other candidates. She thought that
they were so homely that their names
were not worth publication. Neverthe
less the Daily Alto stands 011 the
grounds of equal rights, and is willing
to publish their names, although we
believe that Miss Swensen is right in
the assumption that they are not up
to the high beauty qualifications set
by her. They are: Miss Alberta
Weeds, '20, Miss Roberta Kinny, '21,
and Miss Jessie Trash, '21 .
These last three named young ladies
have procured some of the renowned
campus politicians to run their elec
tion. Miss Weeds will be assisted in
her campaign by Miss Dorothy Driss
ling-Cold, '20, while Miss Trash has
gotten the ever-smiling political boss,
Peggy McChronicle, '21, to run her
campaign. Miss Roberta Kinny has
nas not yet announced her manager,
not yet announced her manager,
engineering major will do the work.
If all goes well the election will be
held next spring, when all the candi
dates will be in the prime of their

beauty. Miss Swensen is running on
the Socialistic platform; Misses
Weeds, Kinny and Trash are running
on rickety platforms; and Miss Don
keysqueal is running on a hay loft.


Miss Cutie Swensen, who bids fair
to win first prize in our Beauty Con
test.

ably the most notable of these is Miss L. W. Donkeysqueal, '20, who was once
a dippy editor of some small town paper. Neither of these two young people
are members of any sorority; however, it is rumored that Miss Donkeysqueal

is being rushed by one of the leading
sororities 011 the row. The last state
ment is based on the grounds that she
is continually hanging around the
ladies of a certain house.
It was only after deep deliberation,
and much concentration that Miss
Swensen gave out the names of the
other candidates. She thought that
they were so homely that their names
were not worth publication. Neverthe
less the Daily Alto stands 011 the
grounds of equal rights, and is willing
to publish their names, although we
believe that Miss Swensen is right in
the assumption that they are not up
to the high beauty qualifications set
by her. They are: Miss Alberta
Weeds, '20, Miss Roberta Kinny, '21,
and Miss Jessie Trash, '21 .
These last three named young ladies
have procured some of the renowned
campus politicians to run their elec
tion. Miss Weeds will be assisted in
her campaign by Miss Dorothy Driss
ling-Cold, '20, while Miss Trash has
gotten the ever-smiling political boss,
Peggy McChronicle, '21, to run her
campaign. Miss Roberta Kinny has
nas not yet announced her manager,
not yet announced her manager,
engineering major will do the work.
If all goes well the election will be
held next spring, when all the candi
dates will be in the prime of their

beauty. Miss Swensen is running on
the Socialistic platform; Misses
Weeds, Kinny and Trash are running
on rickety platforms; and Miss Don
keysqueal is running on a hay loft.


Miss Cutie Swensen, who bids fair
to win first prize in our Beauty Con
test.
I am positive that I am the most handsome young lady amongst
the 500. There are several that doubt my supremacy along the beauty
lines, so I hereby defy them with an open challenge to meet me in a
beauty contest.
(Signed)
MISS CUTIE SWENSON, '20.

The above is a copy of a challenge which Miss Cutie Swenson, '20, wished
the editor of the Daily Palo Alto to make public, in an endeavor to settle the
long-disputed question as to whether or not she was the beauty queen of the
campus.
Miss Swenson is a short, although not too short, young person (that is,
she claims to be young), with light brown hair and a pleasing complexion.
She has one of those pleasing temperaments that must always go along with
such a chubby, moonshaped face.
After an interview with Miss Swenson, it was ascertained that there were
four other beauties on the campus that claimed equal honors with her. Prob
ably the most notable of these is Miss L. W. Donkeysqueal, '20, who was once
a dippy editor of some small town paper. Neither of these two young people
are members of any sorority; however, it is rumored that Miss Donkeysqueal

is being rushed by one of the leading
sororities 011 the row. The last state
ment is based on the grounds that she
is continually hanging around the
ladies of a certain house.
It was only after deep deliberation,
and much concentration that Miss
Swensen gave out the names of the
other candidates. She thought that
they were so homely that their names
were not worth publication. Neverthe
