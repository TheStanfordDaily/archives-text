# Wrestlers To Clash on Next Monday for Interclass Honors
## "Beat California" — Jones BUNDS, SIMS SHOW SPEED IN TRI-WEEKLY PRACTICE BOUTS ON MAT 
### Ralph D. Campbell, '22 
Next Monday afternoon the last pre
wrestling tournament of the year will
be called at the Encina gymnasium,
when all the men of the various weights
and classes will fight for mat honors,
The meet is planned to bring out the
older team men, as well as the younger
lights, and to furnish competitive try
outs, in order that the best may be
cho%en for the '19 Car final lineup.
Keen competition is looked for in the
tourney.
For the past two months the local
wrestlers have trained regularly in the
tri-weekly workouts. The squad shows
its strength from this early training, and
will undoubtedly furnish excellent ma
terial from which to pick a winning
team. With each week's workouts the
individual men have come through with
more "light and go."
Coach Jones is probably the biggest
asset to the farm squad of wrestlers
Jones has not only coached the men in j
the science of wrestling, but has trained
them in numerous exercises and drills.!
This work has been highly beneficial to |
the team. It is the consistent training j
that has put the locals on their feet.
Egami and Fenlason Coach
Through the efforts of Egami, last ;
year's team star who won several bouts
>ff of the Californians in the light-j
eight group, the wrestling class has |
. en receiving some very practical in-j
stiuction. Egami has worked individu-i
ally with the men showing them the j
"tricks of the trade" and instructing
them how to take advantage of their
opponents.
Fenlason has also helped the wrest-1
lers a great deal in his work with the i
men. He has had considerable experi-i
ence on the mat and through his exhibi
tion bouts with Jones and Egami has
helped to give the squad a good under
standing of the game.
Wrestlers Make Record
hi the previous class bouts individual
members have shown marked ability on
the mat. Some of them have had previ
ous experience in the work but on the
most part are novices. The-success of
the men has been largely due to their
interest in wrestling and the spirit that
they have putin their practice bouts.
Sims in the light-weight class has j
come through with surprising ability in j
the chanceree and scissors hold. He has I
wrestled with Kgami considerably, and
this, no doubt, has given the "hop" in
tlu art of self-defense. Erickson has
made a record for himself in the 145-
pound class. He has tackled some of
the men in the heavy-weight classes,
and has more than once come out on
top. Brazil, who is a good man in the
125-pound class, is a natural born wrest
ler. He takes to the game like a fish
does to water—goes into the bout with
a "biff-bang zip" that usually wins him
his mark. May, Meyers, and Fendler
(FRESHMEN* Class President) arc
also making their mark in their indi
vidual weight classes. Sonic of the
speediest bouts have been held in the
'■'<ses. There Arc three men

who have been stepping side by side I
for honors in this class, namely, Bunds,'
Demond, Knapp. Up to date, Bunds has
shown the upper hand, having won from
his two close opponents in several bouts
a few weeks ago.
With such men as these on the squad,
it will not be difficult to pick all point
winners for the local aggregation.
That the Californians will get the
small end of the score in the coming in
tercollegiate meet, is the opinion of
Coach Jones. The California team has
had little training in the past weeks,
though it is true that they have some
experienced men on their lineup. Stan
ford will have representatives in all the
weight classes, while it is thought that
the up-bay university is especially weak
in some of her lighter-weight classes.
The locals have fine chances ahead of
them, and with the speed that they have
been displaying of late, should walk
home with a of 49 to 0 score in their
favor.
The Stanford freshmen will hold a
tournament with the babes from Cali
fornia some time near the scheduled
meet which is to occur in the last of
April. This will no doubt be the big
gest event in the Northern California
sporting world

most part are novices. The-success of
the men has been largely due to their
interest in wrestling and the spirit that
they have putin their practice bouts.
Sims in the light-weight class has j
come through with surprising ability in j
the chanceree and scissors hold. He has I
wrestled with Kgami considerably, and
this, no doubt, has given the "hop" in
tlu art of self-defense. Erickson has
made a record for himself in the 145-
pound class. He has tackled some of
the men in the heavy-weight classes,
and has more than once come out on
top. Brazil, who is a good man in the
125-pound class, is a natural born wrest
ler. He takes to the game like a fish
does to water—goes into the bout with
a "biff-bang zip" that usually wins him
his mark. May, Meyers, and Fendler
(FRESHMEN* Class President) arc
also making their mark in their indi
vidual weight classes. Sonic of the
speediest bouts have been held in the
'■'<ses. There Arc three men

who have been stepping side by side I
for honors in this class, namely, Bunds,'
Demond, Knapp. Up to date, Bunds has
shown the upper hand, having won from
his two close opponents in several bouts
a few weeks ago.
With such men as these on the squad,
it will not be difficult to pick all point
winners for the local aggregation.
That the Californians will get the
small end of the score in the coming in
tercollegiate meet, is the opinion of
Coach Jones. The California team has
had little training in the past weeks,
though it is true that they have some
experienced men on their lineup. Stan
ford will have representatives in all the
weight classes, while it is thought that
the up-bay university is especially weak
in some of her lighter-weight classes.
The locals have fine chances ahead of
them, and with the speed that they have
been displaying of late, should walk
home with a of 49 to 0 score in their
favor.
The Stanford freshmen will hold a
tournament with the babes from Cali
fornia some time near the scheduled
meet which is to occur in the last of
April. This will no doubt be the big
gest event in the Northern California
sporting world
Next Monday afternoon the last pre
wrestling tournament of the year will
be called at the Encina gymnasium,
when all the men of the various weights
and classes will fight for mat honors,
The meet is planned to bring out the
older team men, as well as the younger
lights, and to furnish competitive try
outs, in order that the best may be
cho%en for the '19 Car final lineup.
Keen competition is looked for in the
tourney.
For the past two months the local
wrestlers have trained regularly in the
tri-weekly workouts. The squad shows
its strength from this early training, and
will undoubtedly furnish excellent ma
terial from which to pick a winning
team. With each week's workouts the
individual men have come through with
more "light and go."
Coach Jones is probably the biggest
asset to the farm squad of wrestlers
Jones has not only coached the men in j
the science of wrestling, but has trained
them in numerous exercises and drills.!
This work has been highly beneficial to |
the team. It is the consistent training j
that has put the locals on their feet.
Egami and Fenlason Coach
Through the efforts of Egami, last ;
year's team star who won several bouts
>ff of the Californians in the light-j
eight group, the wrestling class has |

stiuction. Egami has worked individu-i

"tricks of the trade" and instructing
them how to take advantage of their
opponents.
Fenlason has also helped the wrest-1
lers a great deal in his work with the i
men. He has had considerable experi-i

helped to give the squad a good under
