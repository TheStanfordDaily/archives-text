## DR. MOSHER RETURNS TO RESUME DUTIES 
### 
I )r. Celia Mosher, who was head in
structor of women's athletics on this
campus for many years, and who took
out a leave of absence when war broke
out to do war work in France, has re
cently returned. Yesterday afternoon
she gave a decidedly interesting talk on
her experiences, to the women of the
gymnasium claess.
Dr. Mosher has been in France for a
year, and the subject of her talk was,
"Women and War Work." The inter
csting point about Dr. Mosher's talk
was the decided informality of it. She
grouped the girls about her and talked
in a friendly manner, every now and
then stopping to answer any questions
that the girls wished to ask.
Dr Mosher spoke of the wonderful
work that women were accomplishing
in Pranee. "Women of all nations."
she said, "have combined for a great
cause." Especially did she mention the
French and American women in France.
"Many wealthy French women" said
Dr Mosher, "have turned their beauti
ful chateaus into hospitals, and are de
voting all their time to caring for the
sick and wounded The American
women are working alongside the
French women, and many fine things
have been accomplished by them."
Everyone who heard Dr. Mosher was
charmed and fascinated by her account
of her wonderful experiences.
Dr. Mosher will resume her duties as
head gymnasium instructor next quar
ter
