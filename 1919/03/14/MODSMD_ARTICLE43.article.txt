## IS SECOND APPEARANCE LIFE OF PUPIL OF MARCHESI PRESENTS MANY ORIGINAL POINTS 
### 
A Stanford audicnce will hear
Madame Alda, the great Metropolitan
Opera soprano, for the second time on
Thursday evening, March 12. Madame

other places.
The career of Madame Alda is a most
interesting one. Born in New Zealand,
she completed her first studies in Mel
bourne, Australia, and then became a
pupil of Maiches in Paris. Following
this, in 1904, Alda made her debut in
1 aris, in Nanon,' a role for which the
composer, Massenet, personally chose
her.

ful, Madame Alda went to Brussels,
where she was immediately given im
portant roles. Following engagements
at London Parma, and Milan, the al
ready noted soprano went to South
America, to Buenos Aires Since 1908,
when Alda made her debut at tiie Met
ropolitan Opera House in New York,
she has been a member of that world
known company.
Madame Alda has arranged a special
program for Stanford, and since she
comes during vacation, doubtless all
those remaining on the campus will
deem it a rare treat to hear her. She

A Stanford audicnce will hear
Madame Alda, the great Metropolitan
Opera soprano, for the second time on
Thursday evening, March 12. Madame
Alda sang here several years ago, under
the Pacific Musical Association. The
appearance of this noted singer, under
Charles L. Wagner, will doubtless be
greeted here with the enthusiasm which
press reports show she has received in
other places.
The career of Madame Alda is a most
interesting one. Born in New Zealand,
she completed her first studies in Mel
bourne, Australia, and then became a
pupil of Maiches in Paris. Following
this, in 1904, Alda made her debut in
1 aris, in Nanon,' a role for which the
composer, Massenet, personally chose
her.
Her first year being highly success
ful, Madame Alda went to Brussels,
where she was immediately given im
portant roles. Following engagements
at London Parma, and Milan, the al
ready noted soprano went to South
America, to Buenos Aires Since 1908,
when Alda made her debut at tiie Met
ropolitan Opera House in New York,
she has been a member of that world
known company.
Madame Alda has arranged a special
program for Stanford, and since she
comes during vacation, doubtless all
those remaining on the campus will
deem it a rare treat to hear her. She
will be accompanied by Miss Erin Bal
lard, described as "that exquisite bit of
human cameo "
