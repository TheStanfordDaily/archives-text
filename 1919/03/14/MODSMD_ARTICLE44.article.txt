## 
### 
Mr. Charles KL Field, '95, editor of
the Sunset Magazine, spoke to the
classes in editorial and news writing
yesterday afternoon.
Prof. Carruth, in introducing Mr.
Field, said, "One of the advantages of
receiving a diploma from Stanford is
the privilege of calling the editor of the
Sunset Magazine 'Charlie.' Mr. Field is
a model alumnus." "The model alum
nus" explained that he is a '95 model.
His talk was valuable, clearing up points
and settling questions that bother the
minds of would-be writers. Mr. Field
made two emphatic statements, saying
that a college education is vitally neces
sary, but that it is not necessary to be a
major in Fn√ülish in order to fully pre
pare to enter the writing game.
