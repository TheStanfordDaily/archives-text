# Freshmen Have Unusually Good Crew Out This Year
## CAPTAIN IS CONFIDENT LARGE AMOUNT OF MATERIAL CAUSES BIG CUT IN SQUAD 
### F.S. Reeder, '22 
From the present outlook of the dope
on crew, it seems fairly impossible for
the Stanford FRESHMAN shell this
year to do anything else, but to show her
supremacy over the California babes'
eight. Since 1904 the University of Cal
ifornia has only been able to win two
of the regattas against the Cardinal
FRESHMEN.
There was such a large supply of shell
material out for the 1922 boat that Cap
tain Watts and Coach Rogers were
forced to make a reduction in the num
ber of men last Wednesday afternoon.
Notwithstanding the fact that they are
cutting down the number of men, all
FRESHMEN affected by the recent
student affairs committee ruling will be
given another opportunity to try out for
crew.
Crew practice on the Lagunita lake
ends this week, and there will be no
training during the entire examination
week, except that done by the individual
men themselves. The practice will be
resumed on March 22, at the Redwood
City estuary, where work will be started
on the rougher waters of the bay. There
are five eight-man shells at the estuary,
md the crew men will be given intensive
training from then on, until the big race
with California and Washington.
The Stanford varsity eight has as
good chances as the FRESHMEN in
this year's regatta. The coach and cap
tain were also forced to cut men from
this squad on account of the number
out for the eight.
Since 1909 the California varsity shell
lias never won in the big race against
Stanford and Washington, while Wash
ington has only captured three of the
races. The chances are looking slim for
both the University of California
eights.
The big triangle regatta for 1919, be
tween the University of California, the
University of Washington, and Stan
ford, will be held at the Oakland estu
ary. The event will take place on the
morning of May 3, followed by the Stan
fcrd-California track meet in the after
noon. Both the varsity and FRESH
MEN shells will race on that date.
California is having considerable trou
ble w'th crew this year, since it is not to
be supported by the student body. How
ever, the crew men have handed togeth
( rand formed a boat association, and
the student body is going to sanction the
sport as one of the regular school events,
provided enough money is raised by the
association to completely finance the
project.
In the Daily Palo Alto issue of last
Wednesday, through an error in print
ing. the names of the men left on the
varsity shell, trying out for coxswain,
were left off. They are: Shipp,
Coombs, Eikhoff. Schnier and Willis
The men out for FRESHMAN cox
swain are: V'alci. Wells, Boucher, Zer
tuche and Cunha.
There are a number of men showing
up exceptionally well for the I'RESH
MAN ciiiht. They are: Adams, Clark,
Cornish, Gray, Hancock, Maloney. Mc-
Kinnon, Saunders, Snow, Osen. Sayre.
Preston, Dunbar, Stern. Briggs. Clute,
Merrill, LaForgue.

FRESHMEN affected by the recent
student affairs committee ruling will be
given another opportunity to try out for
crew.
Crew practice on the Lagunita lake
ends this week, and there will be no
training during the entire examination
week, except that done by the individual
men themselves. The practice will be
resumed on March 22, at the Redwood
City estuary, where work will be started
on the rougher waters of the bay. There
are five eight-man shells at the estuary,
md the crew men will be given intensive
training from then on, until the big race
with California and Washington.
The Stanford varsity eight has as
good chances as the FRESHMEN in
this year's regatta. The coach and cap
tain were also forced to cut men from
this squad on account of the number
out for the eight.
Since 1909 the California varsity shell
lias never won in the big race against
Stanford and Washington, while Wash
ington has only captured three of the
races. The chances are looking slim for
both the University of California
eights.
The big triangle regatta for 1919, be
tween the University of California, the
University of Washington, and Stan
ford, will be held at the Oakland estu
ary. The event will take place on the
morning of May 3, followed by the Stan
fcrd-California track meet in the after
noon. Both the varsity and FRESH
MEN shells will race on that date.
California is having considerable trou
ble w'th crew this year, since it is not to
be supported by the student body. How
ever, the crew men have handed togeth
( rand formed a boat association, and
the student body is going to sanction the
sport as one of the regular school events,
provided enough money is raised by the
association to completely finance the
project.
In the Daily Palo Alto issue of last
Wednesday, through an error in print
ing. the names of the men left on the
varsity shell, trying out for coxswain,
were left off. They are: Shipp,
Coombs, Eikhoff. Schnier and Willis
The men out for FRESHMAN cox
swain are: V'alci. Wells, Boucher, Zer
tuche and Cunha.
There are a number of men showing
up exceptionally well for the I'RESH
MAN ciiiht. They are: Adams, Clark,
Cornish, Gray, Hancock, Maloney. Mc-
Kinnon, Saunders, Snow, Osen. Sayre.
Preston, Dunbar, Stern. Briggs. Clute,
Merrill, LaForgue.
From the present outlook of the dope
on crew, it seems fairly impossible for
the Stanford FRESHMAN shell this
year to do anything else, but to show her
supremacy over the California babes'
eight. Since 1904 the University of Cal
ifornia has only been able to win two
of the regattas against the Cardinal
FRESHMEN.
There was such a large supply of shell
material out for the 1922 boat that Cap
tain Watts and Coach Rogers were
forced to make a reduction in the num
ber of men last Wednesday afternoon.
Notwithstanding the fact that they are
cutting down the number of men, all
FRESHMEN affected by the recent
student affairs committee ruling will be
given another opportunity to try out for
crew.
