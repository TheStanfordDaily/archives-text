### 
Mules will be plentiful, and serenades
from the Rocky Mountain canaries will
fill the air, if the general public takes
advantage of the last sale of stock to be
held at the Remount Depot No. 332,
on March 27 and 28. Three hundred
and twenty-five mules guaranteed to be
of sound mind and limb, will be auc
tioned from the block, commencing at
10 a.m., by Captain Jones, G. M. C., auc
tioneer.
One hundred horses, representatives
of Camp Kearny stock, and 75 local rep
resentatives will also be sold. Stock
will be sold to the highest bidder. Part
payment must be made at the time of
the sale, and the remainder at the close
of the day. Halters will be furnished
each animal. Owners must "remove"
their stock by the close of the day,
and can not call upon outside aid. Gov
ernment insurance is for the benefit of
those employed with government stock
only. Between April 1 and IS, 240 horses
and 290 mules will be sent to the Philip
pines. After sales and shipments arc
completed, the Fremont depot will be
abandoned to the Utilities department
for salvage.
