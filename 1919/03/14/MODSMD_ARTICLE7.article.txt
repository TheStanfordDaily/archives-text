# Old Timer Tells Experiences Of His University Days
## I.M.A. GOOF, '98, VISITS THE CAMPUS 
### 
Mr. I. M. A. Goof, class of '98, is
visiting his prominent sophomore son,
Mac Goof, on the campus this week.
Mr. Goof, who is one of the founders
of the Gottamaka Dee Club, expressed
delight upon seeing the numerous
FRESHMEN in the house, and hoped
these men would stay long enough to
become sophomores. While being
shown about the campus, Mr. Goof
told many of his remembrances of the
early days on the farm,
"I well remember the day I first
came to college," said he."The stu
dent body, all twelve, came in a group
to meet me. By way of a welcome to
college life, the student body took me
under the only tree on the campus and
breaking off a limb, gave me my first
paddling. To make the ceremony com
plete, some one suggested that I be
putin to a tub of water; but they had
no tubs on the grounds then, so I was
thrown in the lake. That was," said
Mr. Goof, expanding his chest, "the
first tubbing on the campus."
When the honored alumnus was
shown Roble Hall, where the women
live, he was astonished. "You don't
mean to say the place is full of
women?" he exploded. "Why, you
niu:t have nearly enough to go
around." Then came his story of early
"queening."
"There were only a few women on
the campus in those days, and they
were divided among the seniors. The
rest of us were 1 told to keep away, so
we used to drown our time in Mayfield,
or go swimming in the lake."
Mr. Goof admitted that things had
changed since his time, but he said
he thought all would be for the better.
Mr. Goof will live for the rest of the
week on the Gottamaka Dee Club,
when he will return to his home in
South San Francisco.
