# Rhodes Scholarship To Be Resumed in 1919
## 
### 
The Rhodes scholarship appoint
ments which have been discontinued
during the war are to be resumed in
October, 1919, according to a letter
from Frank Andelotte, American sec
retary to the Rhodes Trustees. There
will be an election of one scholar in
each state in the Union, and in sixteen
states, each of which would have had
a scholar for both 1918 and 1919 under
normal conditions, there will be two
scholars appointed. California is one
of these sixteen states.
According to the Rhodes will there
is provision made for two scholars
from each state in the Union to be in
constant attendance at Oxford. Each
scholar to be appointed stays for three
years and receives Â£300 a year, which
he may spend as he wishes, no restric
tions as to the course of study being
made. Candidates must be unmarried,
between 19 and 25 years of age, and
must have completed at least two
j years of college work.
Formerly candidates for the scholar
ship had to pass a qualifying exami
nation, but this has been abandoned
and the only qualification needed now
i is the formal application endorsed by
j the authorities of the students' college
or university.
The selection is based upon the stu
dent's record in school, according to
' scholarship, character, interest in out-
I
i door sports, and interest in one's fol
lows and the instincts for leadership.
The selections will he made by a
committee in each state and a list of
| the men to whom application should
, be made will be posted in June. Copies
of these will be sent upon application
to Mr. Frank Andelotte, Institute of
Technology, Cambridge. Mass. Any
further question that may arise before
then should be addressed to any col
lege president., or ex-Rhodes scholar,
ior to the American secretary. Candi
dates may try for the appointment
either from the state in which they
reside or from the one in which they
have received the major part of the
education.
