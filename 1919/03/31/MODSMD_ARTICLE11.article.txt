# BASEBALL PROSPECTS LOOK BETTER WITH OLD MEN BACK
## "BILL" PIKE, '20, RETURNS Varsity Will Play Olympic Club Two Game Series Starting April 5 
### 
Baseball prospccts assumed a brighter
outlook over the spring vacation with
the addition of "Bill" Pike, captain and
first baseman of the 1920 baseball team
and Teubner, first baseman on the 1921
team. The addition of these two men
to the squad makes it possible for Coach
"Bob" Evans to work several infield
and outfield combinations.
At present the squad is composed of
Newlands and Fairchilds, pitchers;
Bundy, Stewart and Filley, catchers;
Pike, Teubner, Kallum, Galloway, Doe,
Green and Stevens, infielders, and
Lilly, Crowe, Needham, Parker and
Smith, outfielders. Coach Evans has
been working with these men during
vacation and will be able to pick his
team within a week or so.
Several infield combinations will be
tried during the next few days. Pike
can be worked at first base, Kallum at
second, Captain "Jim" Galloway at short
stop and "Mush" Stevens at third.
Another combination will be Galloway
at first, Green or Doe at second, Kal
lum at short and Stevens at third. Pike
and Teubner will alternate between
first and the outfield.

Bundy, Stewart and Filley are the
catchers. Bundy is a good receiver and
hitter, but is weak on base-throwing.
Stewart is a fair base-thrower and re
ceiver but is rather weak with the stick.
Filley, the "Germany" Schaffer of the
minor leagues, is a poor receiver, but
according to him, it takes a "goin'
piece of furniture" to steal second on
his arm.
Newlands and Fairchilds are the
twirlers that are on the squad at pres
ent. Hoever may return within a few
days and Parthum, who is said to he a
good pitcher, is expected to register
this quarter. Another good man on the
pitching staff will be a big aid to the
team.
Two practice games were played dur
ing the vacation with the Palo Alto
high school, in which the Varsity team
emerged victorious. The Varsity was
defeated by Cliff Ireland's Independents
on "Ireland's Independent Day," by the
score of 4 to 1. Fairchilds and New
lands worked in the box for Stanford
and Krause and Kclley pitcher for
Iredand's team.
On April 5 and 12, the Varsity plays
the Olympic Club, on the Stanford
field. There is also a possibility for
another Santa Clara game.
