# CARDINALS TO FIGHT BLUE AND GOLD BOXERS
## Tournament Scheduled for April 25â€”Team to Be Chosers in Contest 
### 
The California-Stanford varsity box
ing tournament will be called at the up
bay University on April 25, when the
champions on the rival teams will battle
for inter-collegiate honors. The meet,
according to Coach Joe Murphy, will
be a hot get-together competition and in
the five weight classes it will be very keen.
Team men have not been chosen to date.
Freshmen enthusiasts will not have a
chance to meet the California freshmen
It his year, as previously planned, al
though the varsity boxers may be picked
partly from the freshmen men who are
now working in the classes.
Much enthusiasm has been shown by
all the men who expect to tryout for
the Stanford lineup. Prcticc bouts and
several inter-class tourneys have put the
locals in good form and it will be an
easy matter, according to tin coach, to
pick some speedy point winners for the
coming contest. Among the men who
arc looking for a position on the team
and who have a good chance to make
their mark are "Fat" Howell, Mark
Kvans, "Babe" llenry, "Mike" Scott.
These men have shown their metal
more than once in the practice workouts
and will no doubt strengthen the local
lineup. Present plans call for the men
in the welterweight class and two in the
middleweight class.
Previous to the California meet, the
lrcals will meet the San Francisco
Olympic Club in a tournament on April
IS. Wilbur Herzog, former fighting
champion in the navy, will fight for the
clubmen in the contest to be staged here.
There will be four matches in the meet.
