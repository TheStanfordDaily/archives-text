# MEN FOR THE FUTURE
## 
### 
mIjSK the opening of the spring quarter, Stanford finds itself
mj|#' more than ever adequately fit to meet the events of
the quarter; to even the casual observer, the number of old faces
on the Quad this morning, was a distinct surprise. It appears that
many of the old Stanford men, absent for some time, are to be back on the
job (or jobs) again.
The big complaints of the past year aqd a half have ultimately reached the
same conclusion, viz: that there was not the adequate number of real Stan
ford men around to attend to the real Stanford jobs. Rut the real Stanford
men have been constantly increasing in number recently and seem once again to
have reached a natural state. There need be no present cry for real Stanford
men. There should be a good ground work in these men to help solve all the
so-called problems dependent upon the best men in college for their solution.
While we are satisfied with the numbers of old-timers and others present
for the opening quarter knowing that their number augurs well for successes
in the spring, let us not forget future quarters. Unnatural war conditions de
prived Stanford of some of the virile elements in its student body; with the
return of many of these elements, the present is taken care of. The problem
for the future, is to get other virile men to enter Stanford and build for a
future Stanford.
Wc know now how difficult it is to succeed with the absence of so many
of the college leaders; let us plan to prevent reoccurrence in the natural course
of events what the war alone excused. We want to keep a certain type of
student leader always at Stanford; let us get this leader here. It is by talking
Stanford, talking about Stanford, Stanford work, life, sports, traditions and
ideals that we can show the side of Stanford that will bring the proper type of
men here in the future.
There is in this an opportunity for every Stanford man; the task is to bring
big men here in the future. Let us make Stanford the place that these men
wish to attend and then bring them here.
