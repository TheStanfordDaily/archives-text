# 1920 JUNIOR OPERA TRYOUTS SCHEDLED THIS WEEK
## ORIGINALITY OF PLOT MARKS SHOW Name of Production Will Be Announced Some Time in Near Future 
### 
Tryouts for the 1920 Junior Opera
I will be held this Wednesday afternoon
! and again on Friday, as announced by
| Leland Pickering, '20, who is chairman
of the committee.
The author of the opera, Miss Kirby
Ingoldsby, '21, is putting in many hours
of constant work giving certain finishing
i touchcs to the play, and there is no
I doubt in the minds of the committee but
! that this 1920 production will rival all
j previous shows in originality and ability.
J The scenes as they are being worked
j out present very striking and peculiar
I situations, and there will be unusual
j character plot which is being developed
along with the peculiarity of the situa
tion. Because of this, the individual
members of the audience will be kept
busy guessing as to the final outcome of
the show. Clever specialities and mu
sical numbers are now in readiness, but
nothing further will be announced in re
gard to the music until a later date.
The name of the opera is also being kept
secret for the present, but when divulged
will probably come as a surprise to the
Stanford campus.
It is the wish of the committee that
all eligible students will keep the date
of the tryouts in mind, and that they will
appear before the committee to display
their talent. Preliminary tryouts come
on Wednesday of this week. The time
and place will be announced tomorrow.
