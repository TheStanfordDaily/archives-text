# SACRAMENTO TEAM WINS AT TENNIS
## 
### 
Last Sunday the Sacramento Tennis
Club whitewashed the Stanford team
on the Encina courts. The farm men
were completely outclassed by the Sen
ators, Turner and Hubbard being the
only men forcing til eopponents to three
set series. The team would undoubted
ly have made a b'etter showing, had all
the players been present. Barbour,
Kinney, Davies, Hawkes and Fish had
not yet returned from their vacations;
so inexperienced players had to be put
on as substitutes. Captain Devlin put
up a good game against Roberts, Sac
ramento's captain and last year's
champion.
Hubbard, '17, showed flashes of old
time form and forced Bennett of Sac
ramento to play three games before he
was finally beaten. Turner put up a
good game against E. McSwain but
could not keep up the pace and lost
the last set to the man from the Capital
City. Rimpau was one of the newer
men that showed up to good advantage.
A new system lias been inaugurated
by Captain Devlin whereby those on the
team will always have one. of the Ln
cina courts to their disposal.
A list of ten names will be published
