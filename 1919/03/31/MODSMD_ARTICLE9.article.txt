# Chapparal to Have National Publicity
## International News to Handle "Chappie" in the U.S., Canada, Australia 
### 
Chapparal will rcceive publicity
throughout the United States, Canada,
and Australia, through its arrange
ments, just completed, with the Inter
national News Company of New York.
Fifty thousand news dealers are to be
circularized by the news company with
regard to the details of Chapparal and
the University.
This was accomplished as a result
of the standing that Chapparal has at
tained as one of the leading college
comics in America. Its verses and
jokes have been clipped, borrowed or
stolen by magazines, writers and act
ors in all pars of the country. Some
vaudeville writers have made it a point
to subscribe to Chaparral in order to
filch its uncopyrighted material, and
it is no extraordinary occasion to find
some of the local wit and humor re
cited from the Orpheum stage.
Chaparral will be placed on sale
throughout California, on the news
stands, ferryboats, and probably all
trains. The tremendous advantage to
advertisers is apparent, and such firms
as the Arrow Collar Co., the Coco Cola
Co., Anheuser Bush, Bevo Co., De-
Muth Pipe Co., General Electric Co.,
Higgins Ink Co., Fiicman's Fund In
surance Co., and others, are among
Chaparral's largest supporters.
Subscriptions are new being solicited
on the Quad, at fifty cents for the
spring quarter issues.
