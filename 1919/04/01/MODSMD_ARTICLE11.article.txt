# Quad Space Must Be Ordered Now
## Management Will Publish the Names of Groups That Do Not Report 
### 
Owing to the indecision on the part
of certain honor societies and other or
ganizations of the campus, in regard to
the amount of space to be taken in the
1920 Quad, and to tardiness on the part
of other groups in paying for space,
the management states that the pub
lication of the year book is being held
up indefinitely.
Announcement is made that during
the present week space may yet be re
served by such organizations and honor
fraternities as have not done so, and
the Quad manager is ready to make
arrangements with all comers in regard
to payment for space.
Next Monday the management prom
ises to publish the names of the groups
which have not indicated that they
either will or will not take a page or
more of the yearbook. According to
the manager, the problem is very im
portant, and may, if not settled at
once, delay publication of the Quad
for several weeks. With the return of
many upperclassmen this quarter, it is
pointed out that the bigger honor or
ganizations should boom to some extent,
and the management is very anxious of
including all of the important ones in
the publication.
The management states also that
juniors returning to college this quarter
may have their pictures taken at "Pop"
Franklin's, and pay their dues to any
of the managerial tryoutees at once.
The remainder of this week will be re
served for this purpose.
