# WHATS WRONG, FROSH?

### 
,ffggj a track captain to be forced to announce that lack of
candidates and support might necessitate the calling off
a chcduled intercollegiate freshman meet with the University
of California is almost unprecedented in recent Stanford history.
It is a sad blow to a University just recovering from the unsettled conditions
of a war-time to find itself with a freshman class that is unable to live up to
the traditions of the University. It is a sad blow to an institution to find that
its freshmen are so little imbued with its ideals and spirit that they sit idly
by while the university officials announce that lack of material may interrupt
intercollcgiate competition.
If it is true that a university depends for its future upon the freshman class
of the present, then Stanford's future does not look any too bright. If the
freshman class carries with it its present inability or disinclination to compete
in intercollegiate activities in its future college years, then it appears as if the
University of California may have to look elsewhere than to Stanford for its
competition during the next four years.
It is difficult to understand, this utter indifference to the wants and de
sires of the University. It is difficult for the present generation of upper
classmen and past generations of Stanford men to understand the utter lack of
Stanford spirit displayed by these latest enrolled at Stanford. The past un
settled conditions might account for some disinterestedness of the freshman
class. It cannot, however, be offered as an excuse for all of it.
But we cannot believe that the present freshmen are inferior in any way
to freshmen of past years. Their attitude towards the University seems differ
ent however then that of previous classes since they are palpably failing in their
duty towards this University. They are not entering into the spirit of Stan
ford, they are not entering into the activities of Stanford.
The time for remedy has come; there is one quarter of 1922's freshman-year
left; let's see the freshmen come back. Let's see them forget they are individuals
in remembering that they are part of the Stanford Student Body; that they are
that vital part of the student body upon which the future depends. Let's go.
frosh!
