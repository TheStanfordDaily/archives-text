# MANY SURPRISES IN FRESHMAN JOLLY-UP
## 
### 
New arrangements for music, prizes,
entrance cards, and stunts have just
been made for the Freshman Jolly-Up
on April 5 in Encina Hall. The en
trance cards will have a novel cartoon.
Encina's new dancing floor will be
used for the first time and a platform
will be built for the jazz band which
will render all parts of the floor avail- J
able for dancing.
Sticky Wilson has prepared a new
concoction for the occasion to be
known as the '22 Special. It consists
of: â– 
Two kinds of ice cream
One ice
1922 Special syrup (secret)
Twenty-two nuts
Whipped cream
Cherry crown.
In addition to ten Special, two boxes

of "Co-Eds" will be given as prizes.
Numbers on the entrance cards will
not determine the winners, but an en
tirely different system than that used
heretofore has been devised by the
committee. Dancing will begin at
8:30 sharp and every one is welcome.
Admission is 55c, including war tax.
