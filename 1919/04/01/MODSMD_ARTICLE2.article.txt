# Freshman Baseball Team Looks Good
## Babes Will Elect Captain Following Practice Tonight 
### 
Freshman baseball prospects are as
suming a brighter aspect. After the
Washington's Birthday parade the
team looked as if it were in a pretty
bad fix. Several of the infielders and
one of the gardeners in the outfield
were banished from the campus and
it looked for a time as if one of the
pitching candidates would have to
take an enforced vacation.
The fight for positions will probably
bo particularly strong for the infield
and battery positions. Neer, Sibley,
and Shamberger are the most prom
ising of the pitchers that are out at
present. Sibley is the only southpaw
of the lot and seems to be at home in
the box. His greatest weakness, as
is the case with most left-handers, is
that his control is rather poor. Me
makes up for this in his change of
speed and with the stuff that he puts
on the ball. Neer has all the control
that Silby lacks, though he has not
shown as much speed as the south
paw. These two men will probably
be the mainstays in the California se
ries. Shamberger will act as the sec
ond string pitcher, unless he shows
more stuff than he has thus far this
season. Itousselot and Spires are run
ning about neck and neck for the re
ceiving position.
Hawkes seems to have first base
cinched. Gomez is putting up the best
game at second, and Edwards will in
all probability hold down third. Con
nolly and Davies ar*> fighting hard for
the position at short. In the outfield
Holmes, Stevenson, and Holsten are
putting up the best game.
