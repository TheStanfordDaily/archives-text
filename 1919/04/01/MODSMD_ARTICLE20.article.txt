# BASE HOSPITAL CARES FOR DISCHARGED MEN
## 
### 
The Public Health and Marine Hos
pital Service is the official title of the
organization that is to take over the
base hospital at Camp Fremont, accord
ing to word received from headquart
ers today.
The Public Health Service is a new
departure from the old system of
handling soldiers suffering casualties
overseas, and has been installed by the
Treasury Department throughout the
United States in place of the Base
I lospitals, in order to better enable
them to take care of discharged sol
diers, sailors and marines, who have
suffered from shell shock, etc., and who
suffer a return of their old malady,
after their discharge from the army.
Under federal control, it is semi
military, the uniforms worn by the of
ficers. being slightly different by reason
of their insignia, from that of the
regular army.
