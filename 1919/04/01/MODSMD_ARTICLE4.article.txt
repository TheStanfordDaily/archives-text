# Y.W.C.A. Campaign For Ten Thousand Dollars Opened on Peninsula
## 
### 
The campaign to raise $10,000 on the
Peninsula, for the Y. W. C. A. work,
opened yesterday. The Peninsula has
been divided into five districts, the
local district containing all the terri
tory from Builingame t<"> Mayfield. To
each is assigned a quota of $2000, of
which Palo Alto lias subscribed $8000
in advance, and Stanford over $500,
leaving $700 to be secured in this sub
division.
The enlarged program of the national
association, made necessary if activi
ties started during the war, are to be
continued on a peace basis, will include
the maintaining of field secretaries,
buildings in every city, town or com
munity where an organization exists,
where any girl at any time of the day
or night will be admitted, with or with
out money, and given lodging and work
if she wants it. Free information and
employment agencies, accommodations
and even creative work for tubercular
girls in Arizona, will also be included,
as well as caring for the foreign-born
who have lost track of their families
during the war or have been thrown
out of employment since the closing
of the munition plants.
The principal portion of the sum col
lected in this district will go towards
satisfying the two immediate local
needsâ€”the Redwood City Girls' Center
and the Stanford Y W. C. A.
Mrs. J. H. Merritt of Menlo Park
is the chairman in charge of the drive,
and as Palo Alto received the free gift
of the Hostess House at Camp Fre
mont, from the Y. W. C. A., the senti
ment in favor of a generous subscrip
tion is quite general.
