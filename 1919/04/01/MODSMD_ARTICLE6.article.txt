# U.S.C. MEET ON OVAL FRIDAY
## Maynard Out of Running For the Season 
### 
University of Southern California's
speedy track aggregation will engage in
a return meet with the Cardinal hopes
on the Stanford track, on the after
noon of Friday of this week. The
Trojan team will have two meets in its
trip north taking on the Stanford team
Friday and the Berkeley speedsters on
Saturday. The meet with the U. S. C.
boys will give the dopestcrs the first
real opportunity to judge of the relative
merits of the Blue and Gold and the
Cardinal, since it will be the first time
of the season that both with have met
a common rival.
Aside from its value as a possibility
for comparison, the meet Friday prom
ises to furnish competition of a caliber
that does not appear often on the Stan
ford oval during the practice season.
The win of the locals in their trip south,
while creating confidence in Stanford
track chances, still should not be over
estimated. Both teams were handi
capped by injuries; Gassner of U. S. C.,

being out of the hurdle competition, and
Maynard being unable to compete for
the Cardinal because of injuries to his
leg. It is even feared that the speedy
quarter-miler will be unable to parti
cipate in any of the meets this year. His
loss will be felt as he was a big factor
in the sprints, quarters and relay.
Friday's meet will give- the Cardinal
fans an opportunity to see the speedy
Paddock in action. This youngster has
a reputation of being one of the fastest
men on the Pacific Coast, having estab
lished several interscholastic sprint
records while attending Pasadena high
school. lie showed a clean pair of
heels to Cardinal sprinters in the dual
meet last week-end.
Another U. S. C. man who runs in a
fashion calculated to draw a cheer from
the grandstand is Schiller, the quarter
miler. He is officially credited with
having broken 50 seconds in the quarter.
! He won this event in 51 seconds, Sat
j urday, on a track that is not conducive
I to fast times.
