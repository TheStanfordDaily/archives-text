# FRESHMEN TRACK MEN NEEDED FOR U.C. MEET
## 
### 
Stanford freshman track team may
not meet the University of California
this year, according to the conclusion
announced by Captain Teitsworth this
morning. Unless a big increase of in
terest is shown immediately by fresh
man track men it will be necessary to
forfeit the meet to the Blue and Gold
yearlings.
Only two freshmen track men
stayed at the University during spring
vacation for training and from the
present outlook it will be impossible
to put out a team. Only an imme
diate turnout of a large number of
freshmen will save the track situation.
Men who were suspended from the
University on account of the freshman
parade were given permission to re
main and continue training in athlet

ics, but not a track man remained.
The same situation exists in regard
to baseball. Not enough men were
around during vacation to hold con
sistant practices and the chances for
producing a first-year baseball team is
very slight.
This i« the first time in tlif* history
of the University that a freshman
class has not shown enough spirit to
have a big turnout in all branches of
athletics and the captain of varsity
teams ire greatly disappointed in their
efforts to get hold of ireshman ma
terial.
Only two more week.- remain be
fore the freshman track meet wiLi
California. The meet will be called
off unless a big turnout of first-year
men »s secured immediately.
