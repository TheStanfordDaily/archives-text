A feature of the affair will be the
dance which will follow the perform
ance. The play is short, and the dance
will begin at 9 o'clock, with Whitmer
and McDermott furnishing the "jazz"
music.

The club ha;- selected the Palo Alto
Women's Cluh house at the corner of
Homer avenue and Cowper street as the
best place in which to stage the produc
tion, as the stage is good and the tloor
one of the best on the Peninsula for
dancing.
Parts will be taken by some of the
cleverest amateurs among the faculty
people whose names on the cast insure
the success of the play.
Since the affair is to be a benefit for
