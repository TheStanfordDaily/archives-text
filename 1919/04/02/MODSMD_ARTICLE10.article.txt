## 
### 
When the president of Eucitia Club
refused to permit the class of '22 to hold
their jolly-up on Encina's new unpol
ished floor, it was decided to hold the
jolly-up in the Woman's Club House.
Last night F. R. Caughey came to the
chairman of tlie jolly-up committee and
informed him that the freshman jolly
up could not be held on Encina's floor.
In accordance with this edict, all of the
posters on the campus today were
changed, and it is hoped, that the supe
rior floor and facilities at the Woman's
Club Mouse will not materially influence
the expected crowd, except to Make it
greater.
