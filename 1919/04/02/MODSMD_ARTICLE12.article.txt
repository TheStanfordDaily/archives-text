# MEN CHOSEN TO ENTER JOFFRE DEBATE AT CALIFORNIA
## TRIO WELL QUALIFIED California Squad Not Yet Picked From Six Trying Out 
### 
HG. BLOTE, '18, G. J. Knight, '19,
â€¢ and W. F. Leiser, '21, were selected
yesterday as the men best qualified to
enter the Joffre debate with the Uni
versity of California to be held the end
of this month. J. D. Wise, '20, and D.
G. Goodman, '22, also made excellent
showings in the three-hour elimination
contest which closed at 5:05 yesterday
afternoon. Wise was chosen as alter
nate and Goodman as librarian for the
squad.
Coach McClintock and Professor L.
E. Bassett, who acted as judges yes
terday, agree that the trio chosen to
contest with the speakers from across
the bay is one of the strongest that
Stanford has ever sent into a Joffre or
Carnot forensic battle.
Blote in his freshman and sophomore
years debated on several regular inter
collegiate teams. He went to France
with the first Stanford ambulance unit,
but since that time has been engaged
by the Red Cross and other organiza
tions in various speaking campaigns in
the west. He is considered an espe
cially able member of the present team.
Knight and Leiser are botli members
of Delta Sigma Rho. The former has
keech and Westwick arc rounding
into good shape in tlie distance events,
; nd Captain Teitsworth looks good to
run one of the best mile events that has
been seen on the Stanford oval for somc (
years. "Mill" Samis. '20. has returned
to the University and will further
strengthen the rank- <>112 the twn-milers.
"I luck" llurtel. '18, has returned from
service overseas, ;ind will strengthen
Stanford's hopes in the quarter mile and
relay. With such men as Dinkelspiel,
Maynard, Wright, Scoiield, Carlsnuth,
and llurtel brothers, this year's relay
team should be about the fastest (level
open here for some time.
