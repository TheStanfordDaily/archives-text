# SERVICEABLE TRIBUTE TO SERVICE

announcement by the committee of fifty appointed to plan
—~ <l sll 'table Stanford Memorial to the men a.nd women of
Stanford who served their country in the world war that a Memorial
Hall is to be erected as a permanent tribute to their service cannot but
be greeted with enthusiasm by the alumni and students of the University.
When the committee was deliberating upon what was desired and what was
fitting as the memorial, it was hoped that the final choice would be something
both suitable and practical. It appears that the committee's choice gives oppor
tunity for a memorial with this twofold possibility.
1 here is no doubt but what a Memorial Hall will possess the dignity, sol
emnity and grace essential for a structure in which service is to be honored. But,
this being a practical age, it seems advisable, from the student standpoint at least,
that the memorial be of some practical benefit. After all, the tendency in all gifts,
donations, bequests and tributes of the present time is for something of real and
practical use. What is more fitting as a tribute to service than something service
able?
There is in the choice of the committee of fifty the possibilities of something
of this serviceable nature. In the suggestion that there is to be a Memorial Audi
torium within the Memorial Hall, there is a hint that a great need of the Uni
versity is to be met. Stanford lias been peculiarly behind in supplying a (it place
for assemblies and important speakers. The Stanford student, possessed of a
certain amount of pride in his institution, has blushed often at the shabby and
ancient appearance of the Assembly Hall. The church has not been a practical
place for lectures, since it presents architectural difficulties in the suitable accom
modation of a large crowd.
The opportunity to remedy this defect of the past is presented through the
Service Memorial. A Memorial Auditorium, as outlined, would take a position
in the Stanford life that is essential to an institution. We would need no longer
be ashamed before visitors if we once have an auditorium of size and adequate
structure to entertain them in.
The Memorial Hall idea is a good one and we congratulate the committee on
their choice. We congratulate them because the hall will furnish a dignified
tribute to the men in service and, with the addition of a Memorial Auditorium,
a serviceable tribute for service.
