those men who were in the S. A. T.

fault of their own, as to their chances
of receiving the sixty dollar bonus

Headquarters District Military inspec
tor, District., No. 11., San Francisco,
I Cal., March Gtli, 1919.—The following
| matter received from the committee
is repeated for the information of all
concerned:
1. When further inductions into
the army were suspended at the time
of the.signing of the armistice, there
were a number of men who had re
ported for duty with the S. A. T. C.
Unit, hut whose induction had never
been technically completed, through
no fault of the men themselves. On
| November 22, 1918, the Provost
J Marshal General was directed to in
| struct local boards to complete the
induction into the Students' Army
Training Corps prior to December 1,
1918, of all registrants from whom
form 2007-A was received, which was
dated October 31, 1918, or before that
date, and which were then in the
posession of the local boards. This
extension of time terminated Decem
ber Ist, and did not provide for the
men who were inducted on forms
other than 2007-A. As a result, since
December Ist, there have been
brought to the attention of the Com
mittee many cases of non-inducted
men who claim* that they should rave
received the status and benefits of
a soldier on active duty, because of
having actually participated in the
work of S. A. T. C. Units.
2. An effort was made to secure
a remedy for these cases through the
action of the War Department. The
Judge Advocate General ruled, how
ever, that congressional action would
be necessary and steps were taken to
recommend the necessary legislation.
Those efforts failed owing to the con
gestion of legislation and the short
ness of the time remaining before the
adjournment of Congress.
3. Owing to the uncertainty re
garding the date of the next session
of Congress, no statement can now
be made as to when, if at all, it will
be possible to secure authority for
the remedial action desired. The
Committee will, however, continue its
efforts and will notify all concerned
when a final decision is reached.

Headquarters District Military inspec
tor, District., No. 11., San Francisco,
I Cal., March Gtli, 1919.—The following
| matter received from the committee
is repeated for the information of all
concerned:
1. When further inductions into
the army were suspended at the time
of the.signing of the armistice, there
were a number of men who had re
ported for duty with the S. A. T. C.
Unit, hut whose induction had never
been technically completed, through
no fault of the men themselves. On
| November 22, 1918, the Provost
J Marshal General was directed to in
| struct local boards to complete the
induction into the Students' Army
Training Corps prior to December 1,
1918, of all registrants from whom
form 2007-A was received, which was
dated October 31, 1918, or before that
date, and which were then in the
posession of the local boards. This
extension of time terminated Decem
ber Ist, and did not provide for the
men who were inducted on forms
other than 2007-A. As a result, since
December Ist, there have been
brought to the attention of the Com
mittee many cases of non-inducted
men who claim* that they should rave
received the status and benefits of
a soldier on active duty, because of
having actually participated in the
work of S. A. T. C. Units.
2. An effort was made to secure
a remedy for these cases through the
action of the War Department. The
Judge Advocate General ruled, how
ever, that congressional action would
be necessary and steps were taken to
recommend the necessary legislation.
Those efforts failed owing to the con
gestion of legislation and the short
ness of the time remaining before the
adjournment of Congress.
3. Owing to the uncertainty re
garding the date of the next session
of Congress, no statement can now
be made as to when, if at all, it will
be possible to secure authority for
the remedial action desired. The
Committee will, however, continue its
efforts and will notify all concerned
when a final decision is reached.
4. District Inspectors will trans
mit this information to institutions
and individuals interested.
By order of
COLONEL MORROW.

I)ituimation has just, been received
as to the status, or lack of status, of
those men who were in the S. A. T.
C., not properly inducted, through no
fault of their own, as to their chances
of receiving the sixty dollar bonus
offered by the government to all dis
charged soldiers. According to the
letter all such cases have been re
ferred to the Judge Advocate General
who has ruled that congressional
action is necessary before any defin
ite action can be taken.
