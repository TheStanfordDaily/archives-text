# Roble Pool to be Reopened Friday
## All Freshman Women Must Take Swimming for One Quarter 
### 
The Roble gymnasium pool is again
open this quarter. Due to the absence
of Mrs. Eddie Brandsten, swimming in
structor, the pool was closed during the
winter quarter. All freshman women
are required to take swimming during
the ensuing nine weeks, but outside of
this number, the enrollment has been
exceptionally large.
L'ppe; classmen may sign for both
crew and swiming, but lower classmen
may sign only for one of these. Fresh
men desiring to participate in crew,
while they cannot register for it, may
go out for the freshman team as an
outside activity. Crew tryoutees may
sign up at the Roble gymnasium.
