# Tuesday Lectures to Be in Assembly Hall
## 
### 
After the unusual success of ttie
Tuesday Lecture programs last quar
ter, it is planned to provide a program
for every Tuesday night this quarter,
starting with next Tuesday. They
will be held in Assembly Hall, as the
Little Theater proved inadequate for
the attendance. The time will be the
same as usual â€”7:30.
An exceptionally fine number of
programs have been arranged for,
some of the speakers being procured
at considerable expense, and it is
hoped that the interest manifested
last quarter will continue this term,
j The lecturer for next Tuesday will be
' announced tomorrow.
