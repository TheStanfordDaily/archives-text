# FRATERNITIES ADOPT INITIATION RULE
## Resolution Says Pledge Must Make C Average Before Initiation 
### 
Resolutions which were adopted by
the iuterfraternity organization last
quarter will go into effect at once,
according to action by that body in
its meeting last night. These resolu
tions include the making of a C aver
age, by the pledge, before initiation,
condemnation of the bringing in of
liquor, of gambling and the use of
obscene language in fraternity houses,
support of the administration, and a
number of other points designed to
better the fraternity conditions.
At the time these resolutions were
passed by the organization of fra
ternity representatives, no time was
set for them to go into effect. At
last night's meeting, they were voted
to go into effect with the beginning
of the spring quarter. Each of the
fraternities, by its representative in
the iuterfraternity organization,
pledged itself to abide by the resolu
tions last night.
The problems of rushing and pledg
ing were discussed last night but
there was such a difference of opinion,
that no definite action could be taken.
A new constitution committee to
draw up a document for the organi
zation, as yet un-named, was elected.
It is composed of the following men:
H. C. Blote, '18, Chairman; W. E.
Redwine, '18, and C. H. Dunn, '19.
