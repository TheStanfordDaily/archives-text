# HARRY WADSWORTH TO HAVE CHARGE OF JUNIOR OPERA MUSIC
## 
### 
In the musical sketches now ready
for the Junior Opera the committee
announce that everything in the mu
sical line of former years will be com
pletely outdistanced. For this import
ant part of the Opera, the services of
Harry Wadsworth have been secured.
Wadsworth is a member of Delta Chi.
This is his first quarter at Stanford,
but he has been prominent in musical
circles elsewhere. Among his achieve
ments have been numerous musical
sketches on the Orpheum circuit, and
the committee feel that they have
given the music into competent hands.
In addition to the work of Wads
worth, Ambrose Whitmer, has contri
buted several songs which promise to
make real hits. Just what the nature
of these songs are, the committee, at
present, refuse to divulge, but promise
that they are unusually good.
Trvouts for the opera were con
ducted this afternoon, until 6 o'clock,
in order to accommodate all those
wishing to try for a place in the cast.
The successful candidates will be an
nounced tomorrow.
