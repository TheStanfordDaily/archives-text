AFTFR six weeks of careful deliber
ation, the Committee of Fifty of
Stanford Alumni and Faculty has de
cided upon the erection of a Memorial
Hall for the Stanford men and women
who had their part in the winning of
the Great War.
Dedicated to the 3000 members of the
University who participated, it is felt
that this building will most effectively
commemorate their great devotion, in
that it will house the records of great
achievements, it will draw attention of
all succeeding generations to the part
played by college men and women in a
great crisis, and it will mark the love
and veneration of the community in
the presentation to the University of
an object of architectural beauty.
It is planned that in this building
there will be a room noble in propor
tions, beautiful as to windows, on the
walls of which will be placed flags,
trophies and portraits. This room will
contain the historical records of the
Stanford War History Committee. In
this building also there will be a Me
morial Auditorium, recording in has
relief and inscription the ambition,
names and achievements and dedicated
to the service of the University to the
nation.
The Committee of Fifty launches at
once its campaign for funds, and com
mittees of Stanford men and women
are being arranged in every state in
the Union. California itself has been
divided into eight regions, each with a
chairman and subcommittee.

who died in service will be held at the
University in June. The gretaest home
