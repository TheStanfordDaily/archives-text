# MEET ON STANFORD OVAL WITH U.S.C. TOMORROW
## 
### 
CAPTAIN TEITSWORTH lias not
decided just which men will rep
resent the Cardinal in the various events
in the track meet with the University of
Southern California, scheduled for the
Stanford oval tomorrow afternoon, but
local track enthusiasts can be assured
that a strong aggregation will com
pete against the southerners. The close
ness of the meet run at Los Angeles last
week between these two teams assures
speedy competition tomorrow.
The Southern California tracksters
will arrive Friday morning on the 9
o'clock train, and will leave for Berke
ley after the meet here to be in readi
ness to contest the Blue and Gold run
ners on Saturday. The two meets will
give the dopstcis a chance of compar
ison of the Stanford and California
squads. Stanford won the meet in the
south by a close score, with Gassner, the
U. S. C. hurdler, out of the competition.
He is credited with :15 flat in the high
sticks, and good time over the low
hurdles, so should swell the southerners'
score with firsts in these events. Pad
dock took both the sprints in the first
meet, and may do the same tomorrow,
but with Lilly rounding into shape, the
Stanford chances loom brighter.
Graduate Manager Ames has sched
uled the meet for 2:30 p.m., and it is
expected that most of the students will
attend. It is the first real track event
of the season, and promises to be speedy
from the first starter's gun to the relay.

j This latter event may be the deciding
I race of the day, and with the quarter-

milers making the lap faster every day,

in the track meet with the University of
Southern California, scheduled for the
Stanford oval tomorrow afternoon, but
local track enthusiasts can be assured
that a strong aggregation will com
pete against the southerners. The close
ness of the meet run at Los Angeles last
week between these two teams assures
speedy competition tomorrow.
The Southern California tracksters
will arrive Friday morning on the 9
o'clock train, and will leave for Berke
ley after the meet here to be in readi
ness to contest the Blue and Gold run
ners on Saturday. The two meets will
give the dopstcis a chance of compar
ison of the Stanford and California
squads. Stanford won the meet in the
south by a close score, with Gassner, the
U. S. C. hurdler, out of the competition.
He is credited with :15 flat in the high
sticks, and good time over the low
hurdles, so should swell the southerners'
score with firsts in these events. Pad
dock took both the sprints in the first
meet, and may do the same tomorrow,
but with Lilly rounding into shape, the
Stanford chances loom brighter.
Graduate Manager Ames has sched
uled the meet for 2:30 p.m., and it is
expected that most of the students will
attend. It is the first real track event
of the season, and promises to be speedy
from the first starter's gun to the relay.
