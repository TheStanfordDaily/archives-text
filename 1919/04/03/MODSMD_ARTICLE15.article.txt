# NO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT
## 
### 
the Student Council has announced its intention to
t distribute questionnaires upon student control, this
latter subject once again comes before the student body. The discus
sion upon this subject featured the closing weeks of the winter quar
ter and ought surely feature the opening weeks of the spring.
It is true, as pointed out often in these and other columns, that talk on and
about Student Control is the first essential to Student Control, liut once this
talk has been started, and it was started last quarter, the time for action presents
itself. Talk and discussion are vital to the understanding of a subject and to the
creation of the necessary interest. It is just as important, however, not to carry
this talk and discussion too far, not to let the real intention grow cold, viz., in
this case, the adoption ultimately of Student Control. It was considered too late
last quarter to do anything active towards adopting Student Control, and possibly
it is considered too early this quarter to do anything yet.
"There is no time like the present;" this is often misquoted, but seems to
apply in the solution of this one of Stanford's problems. Let us not merely dis
cuss, until our discussion grows cold. Let us act while there is opportunity to
act a'd while there is interest in acting.
" ,hile realizing that the distribution of questionnaires upon Student Control
may prove a wise step in the determination of campus feeling upon the subject,
the Daily Palo Alto would much rather have applauded the announcement that
one of the Student Control Assemblies was to be held in the near future instead.
First-hand information in the Assembly Hall is more desirable than second-hand
correspondence in the mail box.
Let us have discussion, but let us not overdo this discussion idea. There
is opportunity to act rather than to discuss. Let us act.
