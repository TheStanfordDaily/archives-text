Mayfielci to Spend
$40,000 on Streets
May field is to have $40,000 worth
of street paving putin this summer,
and a special session was held by the
trustees with the city engineer, to
discuss plans and specifications. There
is to be a good deal of water and
sewer pipe expense, in replacing
smaller waterpipe with a large size,
and larger sewer connections, so as
to protect the new street paving
against being broken into.
