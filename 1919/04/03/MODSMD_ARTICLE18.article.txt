### C.E.R., '19 
The meet tomorrow with University!
of Southern California should be pro- J
ductive of some close races if it is
anything like the meet between the
two universities in Los Angeles, last
Saturday.
The quarter-mile was the closest
race of the meet. Early in the race
Schiller of U. S. C., established a
lead. As the runners came into the
stretch both Dinkelspiel and Pelouze
began to gain so that at the tape, a
blanket, not a big one either, would
have covered the three men. A dis
agreement btween judges followed and
whn the argument cleared away, Schil
ler was awarded first; Dinkelspiel,
second; Pelouze, third. These three
will bear watching if they meet again
tomorrow.
Wells won both hurdle races in
good time and Paddock of U. S. C.
took the 100 and 220 in fast time.
Paddock was pressed in both events
and good races are expected.
The Chicago White Sox, the "hitless
wonders," have absolutely nothing on
Stanford's ball club, Hickey, Santa
Clara's twirler, did not allow a hit or
anything resembling a hit. In the
sixth, however, with the aid of a
couple of walks and errors, Lilly,
Stevens and Galloway scored. Santa
Clara's catcher and first baseman
aided in the presentation. Outside
of this inning, Santa Clara played
errorless ball, but when they did start
booting the ball, the Stanford men
sure took advantage of them.

Teubner and Pike are putting up
a good fight for the initial sack. Both
men got in the game yesterday and
each put up a nice exhibition.
"Huck" Hertel and "Milt" Samis,
are working hard on the track and
will probably appear in the U. S. C.
meet. Hertel will be a big boost in
the relay which in years past has
often decided the big meet with Cali
fornia.
