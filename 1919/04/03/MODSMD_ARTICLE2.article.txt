# MAJOR HAY BEITH GIVES IMPRESSIONS OF WAR
## 
### 
"I have seen considerable fighting
in the last four years, but if there ever
was a natural born fighter, that man
is the American soldier." This
was the statement made by Major
lan Hay Beith, Head ot' the
American Section of the British Min
istry of Information, at one of the
best attended assemblies of the col
lege year, yesterday afternoon, in the
Assembly Hall. Major Beith's address
was of a delightfully informal nature
in which he reviewed the first im
pression of the "doughboys" and the
work which they had accomplished
during the war.

Perhaps the most significant part of
Major Beith's address was his dis
cussion of what the Allies had gotten
out of the war now that peace is here.
Belgium, he said, has changed her po
sition from just one of the small
European countries to one of the most
famous nations in -all history.
France, before the war, had the
reputation of being unstable with a
more or less frivolous population. She
has had the chance, said Major Beith,
to prove the falsity of this accusa
tion by the remarkable, unflinching
determination which the French peo
pie have displayed in every instance.
England with a casualty list of 650 i
, has a new outlook within the com
munity. "In our beloved country,"
said Major Beith, "we know how we
stand one to another as we never
knew before." Major Beith went on
to tell of the failure of Germany's con
jecture that the British colonies would
refuse to send troops and how an
army of 2,000,000 men was raised
within the British Empire.
"And America, with a quarter of a
million men on her casualty list, what
has she gotten out of the war?" asked
Major Beith, and then he went on to
say, "the late Theodore Roosevelt
once said that America was not a
country, she was a continent. The
war has changed you from a conti
nent into a country. The American
has felt the spirit which won the orig
inal independence of this country from
the tyranny of a king, and the import
ed American has had his first taste
of personal liberty. The war has
turned out thousands of American
citizens."
In conclusion Major Beith empha
sized the understanding which was to
exist between Great Britain and the
United States so that as a memorial
to those who have given their lives
for the common cause, the world "will
find the two great English-speaking
nations standing side by side, speaking
with one voice upon every issue."
