# TENNIS TOURNAMENT ON ENCINA COURTS SATURDAY MORNING
## 
### 
Instead of the regular inter-club ten
nis matches this week-end the racketers
of the campus will engage in a tourna
ment of singles. The upperclassmen will
fight it out among themselves in om
court while the freshmen will he en
gaged on another of the courts. A
large number of entries are expected
for the tournament, as the teams that
will meet the California varsity and
freshman team will he picked from the
winners of the tournament. An ad
mission of 50 cents will be charged for
the tournament to provide for the price
of the balls used .
The tournament will be the last
chance for the campus to see the team
in action before they go up against the
Berkeley teams a week from Sunday.
The Berkeley match will be the fourth
tournament of the Interclub Tennis
League. Thus far this season the Car
dinal team has lost every tournament
that it has played. Last Sunday all nine
of the matches were lost to the Sacra
mento club. The main cause for this
defeat, according to Cajwain Devlin, was
that the team was minus the services of
Barber, Kenney, Davies. Hawkes. and
I'isli, who had not returned from their
vacation. Even without these men to
do their share of the work every one
of the matches was close and hard
fought. Rimpau, Hubbard, and Thomas
were used to replace the absent stars
and showed great possibilities.
The matches in the Interclub League
have shown a lack of steadiness in the:
playing of the varsity. Hard practice
is necessary to overcome this before the
California series if Stanford is to stand'
any chance of carrying away the bacon.
For this reason Captain Devlin is plan-'
ning to work the men especially hard

the rest of this week and up to the time
of the tournament. If the varsity show
such form for a whole tournament that
they show at times the California
matches will be very close affairs.
After the tournament Saturday a
varsity and freshman list will be pub
lished and one of the Encina courts will
be reserved for these men to use at any
time they wish. The first matches will
start at 10 o'clock sharp on Saturday.
Three courts will be reserved for the
tournament play.
