# Palo Alto High Beats Babes 5to3
## 
### 
Yesterday afternoon the freshman
baseball team was again defeated by the
fast aggregation of ball tosscrs from
Palo Alto high school. The final score
was 5 to 3, the game being a pitcher's
battle throughout. The babes were only
able t<> secure five hits from Howe and
Shed who pitched for the high school
boys. Shamhergcr and Sibley were
touched for two and four hits, respect
ively. Shamhergcr and Shed each had
five strikeouts and three bases on balls
to their credit? while Sibley had a score
of three and one, and Howe was chalked
iip with four and one.
In the field the honors were about
even. The freshmen made three errors
and the Pally boys had one lioot to their

crcdit. Two of the freshmen errors
were, however, the result of Gomez at
second and Russelot at third making al
most impossible stops and not being
able to quite hold on to the ball. Dur
ing the first innings of the game the
Pally boys stole second on Holsten sev
eral times, but as the game progressed
the high schoolers got used to being
callcd out at second.
The 1922 team is improving rapidly.
With Captain Hawkes for a nucleus, the
infield is becoming almost impregnable.
Gomez at second is getting them any
place between the first base foul line
and the outfield fence. Connolly, Mc-
Cullough and Davies are putting up a
lively game at short, and it is a close
race for the position. At third Rus
selot and Stevenson are putting up good
steady game and Hawkes at first is
showing a brand of baseball that is go
ing to i>e hard for California to equal.
Sibley, Holmes and Spires arc putting
up an almost errorless game in the out
field. \\ allace is a new man trying out
for one of the garden positions and
looks good.
In yesterday's game Shamberger
showed more stuff than any time this
season. His underhand ball is begin
ning to work well and he is showing
lots of headwork. Sibley pitched his
usual style of ball in yesterday's game.
1 Ic seems to be putting the ball where
lie wants to more easily than he did
earlier in the season. Kach of the men
will pitch a major portion of one of the
California games. Moisten put up a
good game on the receiving end of the
deal.
I lie two teams line up in the following
order:
Palo Ai.to—Cline, ss; Proctor, 2nd;
Schofield, rf; Hardman. Ist; Green, c;
Franklin, 3rd; Clark and Dwight, cf;

selot and Stevenson are putting up good
steady game and Hawkes at first is
showing a brand of baseball that is go
ing to i>e hard for California to equal.
Sibley, Holmes and Spires arc putting
up an almost errorless game in the out
field. \\ allace is a new man trying out
for one of the garden positions and
looks good.
In yesterday's game Shamberger
showed more stuff than any time this
season. His underhand ball is begin
ning to work well and he is showing
lots of headwork. Sibley pitched his
usual style of ball in yesterday's game.
1 Ic seems to be putting the ball where
lie wants to more easily than he did
earlier in the season. Kach of the men
will pitch a major portion of one of the
California games. Moisten put up a
good game on the receiving end of the
deal.
I lie two teams line up in the following
order:
Palo Ai.to—Cline, ss; Proctor, 2nd;
Schofield, rf; Hardman. Ist; Green, c;
Franklin, 3rd; Clark and Dwight, cf;
Phippen, 2nd; flerdman, If; Howe and

Yesterday afternoon the freshman
baseball team was again defeated by the
fast aggregation of ball tosscrs from
Palo Alto high school. The final score
was 5 to 3, the game being a pitcher's
battle throughout. The babes were only
able t<> secure five hits from Howe and
Shed who pitched for the high school
boys. Shamhergcr and Sibley were
touched for two and four hits, respect
ively. Shamhergcr and Shed each had
five strikeouts and three bases on balls
to their credit? while Sibley had a score
of three and one, and Howe was chalked
iip with four and one.
In the field the honors were about
even. The freshmen made three errors
and the Pally boys had one lioot to their

crcdit. Two of the freshmen errors
were, however, the result of Gomez at
second and Russelot at third making al
most impossible stops and not being
able to quite hold on to the ball. Dur
ing the first innings of the game the
Pally boys stole second on Holsten sev
eral times, but as the game progressed
the high schoolers got used to being
callcd out at second.
The 1922 team is improving rapidly.
With Captain Hawkes for a nucleus, the
infield is becoming almost impregnable.
Gomez at second is getting them any
place between the first base foul line
and the outfield fence. Connolly, Mc-
Cullough and Davies are putting up a
lively game at short, and it is a close
race for the position. At third Rus
selot and Stevenson are putting up good
steady game and Hawkes at first is
showing a brand of baseball that is go
ing to i>e hard for California to equal.
