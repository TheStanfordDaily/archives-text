# STANFORD TO SWIM OLYMPIC CLUB
## 
### 
Stanford mermen will swim one of
the most important meets of the pre
liminary season Saturday morning at
11 o'clock at the Kncina Pool, when they
will contest for aquatic honors with
the Olympic Club of San Francisco.
The Olympic Club ih reputed to be of
the highest caliber and, although the
Cardinal was defeated in its first meet
with the club, it is hoped that the score
will be reversed this time.

Coach Brandsten lias gotten together
what appears to be a good aggregation
which has proven to he very success
ful during the last quarter. A lively
meet is to he expected and all students
including the women arc urged to attend
and support the team.
The following are the men whom
Coach Brandsten except to swim in
the various events: 50 yards, Caughcy.
Pike and Teubner played first base and
Needham, Lilly, Parker .and Kline
worked out in the garden positions. The
Cardinal infield looked good, although
a couple of costly slips were made.
The Stanford club is handicapped by
the absence of Coach "Hob' Evans, who
lias been ill for the past week. The
team is in the critical part of the sea
son and Evans' absence is a hindrance
to the progress of the squad.
The score:
R. H. E.
Stanford 3 0 4
Santa Clara 4 10 4
Batteries—Ncwlands, Pelouze, and
Bundy, Jourg; Mickey and Varni. Um
pire—Pratt.
