# JUNIOR OPERA TRYOUTS TO BE CONTINUED THIS EVENING
## FINAL TRYOUTS MONDAY Committee Urges That More Men and Women Show Up at Club House 
### 
PRELIMINARY Junior Opera try
outs were held yesterday afternoon
at the Delta Gamma house. Although
the announcement of the tryouts were
published in the Daily Palo Alto several
days previous, and it is customary for
a large percentage of Stanford students
to turn out for these tryouts, the com
mittee reports that only sixty people
put in an appearance, and states that
unless more men and women manifest
enough interest in the junior opera to
try out, it will he very difficult, if not
impossible, to stage a -luccessful show.
Leland Pickering, '20, chairman of the
committee, and to be coach of the opera,
has announced keen disappointment in
the numbers of yesterday's tryouts. Sev
eral of the fraternity houses failed to
send any representative and the percent
age of women was also exceedingly
small. The committee believes this lack
of interest in the 1920 opera is only an
other manifestation of general indiffer
ence towards student body activities as
seen last quarter, but fails to under
stand why such a condition should con
tinue to exist.
It has, accordingly, been deemed ad
visable by the committee to hold further
preliminary tryouts, and these will be
conducted this evening, beginning at 7
o'clock, on the second floor of the
Women's Club House. There are un
usual possibilities for both men and
women who try out for the opera, and
the committee urges that any one who
has the slightest bit of talent either in
singing, acting, or dancing, will take
enough interest in the future of the
1920 opera to be present this evening
for tryouts.
Next Monday afternoon has been set
as the date of the final tryouts to be held
at the Delta Gamma house, and previous
to that time announcement of all eligi
ble persons will be made through the
Daily Palo Alto.
