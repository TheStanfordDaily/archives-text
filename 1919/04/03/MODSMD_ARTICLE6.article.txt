# Crew Dance to be at Encina April 11
## Dance Will Be Given to Raise Money for Crew Table 
### 
Encina is to be thrown open Friday
evening, April 11, for the crew dance.
Arrangements are under way to make
this the first big dance of the quarter.
Captain Frank Watts and Coach "Les"
Rogers are to be in charge of the af
fair, and the entire proceeds are to lie
turned over to the crew fund.
The floor of Encina will be in ex
cellent condition fur the "hop", since the
whole dance floor and lower hallway lias
been sandpapered and repolished. Unique
decorations and special music are to be
feature of the evening.
Crew, unlike the other athletic sports,
is supporting itself this season without
help from the Board of Athletic Con
trol. A training table is to be estab
lished for the members of the fresh
man and varsity eights two weeks prior
to the Regtta, with California, which
will be on the morning of the track
meet, May .3. The table will be in the
Theta Xi house, and the crew fund
must be raised sufficiently by that time
to make the success of the table possi
ble. "Daddy" Marx, who rowed on the
varsity shell of Cornell in his days,
urges the entire student body to get
behind the crew men of this year, in
order that it may be said that the Uni
versity of California eight hasn't won a
regatta against Stanford since 1908.
Captain Watts' men are showing up
in unusually good form at their daily
workouts at the Redwood Estuary. On
account of the large number of men re
tained on the squad, some of the men
are forced to practice on the lake. The
wood tonight are: Shipp, Cox: King,
first shell varsity men to go to Red-
Stroke; Watts (Capt.), 7; Adams, 6;
McGillvray, 5; Davis, 4; Williamson, 3;
Moore, 2: Victor, Bow.
