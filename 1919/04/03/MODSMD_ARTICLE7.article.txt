# Faculty Causes Grief to Henry
## 
### 
Sizzlin' syncopation, Pa, you can't
guess what's happened. There's been
a kind of peculiar tingling in the at
mosphere here lately, and now it's
hatched. From this time on we've
got to be gentle and keep our voice
low around here. Pa, 1 guess us boys
have been gettin' too bold and so
figuring that we must be unhappy
without a woman to see that our socks
are all darned, the faculty got busy
for us. Yes sir, Pa, we're going to
get a house mother. Sure. A real
live one. Don't know what her name
will be, but I hope it ain't Miss For
tune. Anyhow, I expect we'll have to
be so good from now on that we'll al
ways be lonesome. Sure is dread
ful what the world is comin' to, ain't
it Pa? With July Ist jumpin' right
along and then this. What's worrying
me now is whether we got to kiss
her good night. Say, I guess we'll
have to fold our "tents like the Arabs,
and silently steal away" to get any
peace now. Pa, just as sure as
water's wet, I'll bet this here, gentle
sex makes us fellows shave twice a
week. Dad, if you get an opponrtunlty
I wish you'd get me a job as post
man, 'cause I can't stand the strain
here any longer.
Still on the Campus,
HENRY.
