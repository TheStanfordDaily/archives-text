Graveure's musical career has been a
strange and interesting one. Horn in
Belgium and educated in England, he
began his life work as a sculptor. Due
to interest which the family in whose
home lie lived, displayed, in his beauti
ful voice, he was persuaded to give up
art and take up music.
After many years of struggle and
study he was stricken and lost his
voice, which did not return until years
later when he was working on a Canadi
an ranch.
A few years later Graveure ventured
to put on some concerts in New N ork
and Boston, where his success was in
stantaneous. This is his first tour of
America.
