appearances are deceptive, Stanford is lucky in at least one
r - respect. It would work a hardship on the University to be
judged by its appearance. The nucleus of good looks exists
Ip at Stanford, but that is about all. There are everywhere
/aMLi apparently collections of rubbish, piles of lumber, mortar, bricks,
common dirt and straight dust.
From the cherished inner Quadrangle, where rain and time are having a
decidedly ill effect upon the sidewalks and cement, to the region of the lake
there is an unprepossessing area of backyards, and even front yards, with ap
pearances like like backyards.
In the midst of our impressive buildings and almost on top of the latest
constructive effort of the University exist some very painful eyesores. If the
University mess hall is going, as we have joyfully heard, where is the excuse
for retention of the Stanford Inn? It has remained with us as one of our
most permanent kicks, despite the opposition of succeeding generations of
protesting students.
There are other eye-sores which can just as easily be eliminated, how
ever. Back yards can be cleaned up and kept clean without much additional
hardship upon house freshmen. The walks and paths about the University
can be cleaned of papers and unnecessary dirt with very little additional labor.
They can be kept clean with very little extra care 011 the part of students
using them.
In the light of the beneficial results of a clean appearing grounds in com
parison with the small effort required to keep the Farm in presentable condi
tion, there is no argument against cleaning up. It may be more difficult to
do, but let us carry the Inn away at the same time with the mess hall. While
that is being done, let us keep the walks in holiday condition, the gardens in
their natural state and the whole University independent of unnecessary rub
bish, lumber, bricks, dust, and dirt. Let's clean up!
