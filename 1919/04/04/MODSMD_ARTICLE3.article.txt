# FRESHMAN NINE TO HAVE PRELIMINARY GAME TOMORROW
## 
### 
Freshman baseball men will journey
to San Jose tomorrow to play the high
school team. The southern boys are
unusually strong so that the babes will
get good practice for the series with
the California cubs.
San Jose has met the Palo Alto
High School twice this year and have
split the games. The freshmen have
been beaten twice by the Pally boys,
so how the game will end tomorrow
is a toss-up.
On Wednesday the freshman team
will meet Mountain View High School
at Mountain View. This will be the
last competition before the babos meet
the bruin yearlings on Saturday, April
12, on the home grounds.
The infield will be shifted around
for tomorrow's game. Captain Hawkes
and Gomez will play at first and sec
ond as usual; Russelot will be shifted
from third to short, and Connolly or
Holmes will be putin at third. Spires,
Sibley, Holmes, and Wallace will he
tried out at outfield positions. Holsten
will do the catching and Sibley. Sham
berger, or N'eer will pitch. If the babes
can do a little heavier batting a fast
winning team ought to be out to meet
the Illue and Gold cubs.
