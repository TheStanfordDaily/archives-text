# 1922 May Not Meet Bruin Track Men
## Freshmen Must All Turn Out for Tomorrow's Meet, Says Teitsworth 
### 
Freshmen tracksters will have their
last chance to turn out for track tomor
row afternoon. If there is not a marked
increase in the number of freshmen on
the oval at tomorrow's workouts, the
freshman meet with the University of
California will he called off, according
to announcement made today. At pres
ent there are less than twenty-five men
that come out every night, and many of
these men are inexperienced. In pre
vious years there have been at least
twice* this number out and often more
than three times as many. The Cali
fornia babes have over ninety men to
pick their team from.
Efforts have been made to secure some
high school team to compete with the
freshmen tomorrow, and there is still
a possibility that one can be gotten. If
there is none available, Captain Teits
worth of the varsity will have those
men who are out, if a sufficient number
show up, compete among themselves.
Only two men stayed at the University
to practice on the oval during vacation,
and it seems from reports that prac
tically none of the other men even took
the trouble to keep in training. Men
who were suspended from the University
last quarter did not take advantage of
the chance when they were allowed to
stay and practice during their enforced
vacation, but several of these men are
showing up to good advantage now.
There are now less than ten men out
for the dashes. In spite of this small
number, several of the men arc making
the hundred at a fast count, while others
are covering the two-twenty in between
22 and 24 seconds. The team now needs
some men who are second and third
places to back up the big point winners.
Only four men are out for the hurdles.
Meade and Overacker are making the
best time of late in the stick races.

Here again is the need of second string
men. The 440 is in the best shape of any
of the events. .Five men are out for this
race, but more men can be used with
very little effort. There are only five
men out for the distances. With three
long races to be run, more are needed.
Overacher, Schlaudenian, and Barker
are trying to take care of the field with
out the necessary assistance from oth
ers. Overacher and Barker are regis
tered in the shot and the discus;
Barker also is throwing the javelin;
and Schlaudeman is jumping and doing
the pole vault. There are practically no
other men out for field events, and as
all three of the tracksters who are mak
ing up the field part of the team are
working on the cinders also, there seems
to he less chance for the Stanford babes
in the field events than on the track.
Captain I eitsworth expects every
freshman who has even seen a track
suit to be out on the oval tomorrow to
show what he can do.

to practice on the oval during vacation,
and it seems from reports that prac
tically none of the other men even took
the trouble to keep in training. Men
who were suspended from the University
last quarter did not take advantage of
the chance when they were allowed to
stay and practice during their enforced
vacation, but several of these men are
showing up to good advantage now.
There are now less than ten men out
for the dashes. In spite of this small
number, several of the men arc making
the hundred at a fast count, while others
are covering the two-twenty in between
22 and 24 seconds. The team now needs
some men who are second and third
places to back up the big point winners.
Only four men are out for the hurdles.
Meade and Overacker are making the
best time of late in the stick races.

Here again is the need of second string
men. The 440 is in the best shape of any
of the events. .Five men are out for this
race, but more men can be used with
very little effort. There are only five
men out for the distances. With three
long races to be run, more are needed.
Overacher, Schlaudenian, and Barker
are trying to take care of the field with
out the necessary assistance from oth
ers. Overacher and Barker are regis
tered in the shot and the discus;
Barker also is throwing the javelin;
and Schlaudeman is jumping and doing
the pole vault. There are practically no
other men out for field events, and as
all three of the tracksters who are mak
ing up the field part of the team are
working on the cinders also, there seems
to he less chance for the Stanford babes
in the field events than on the track.
Captain I eitsworth expects every
freshman who has even seen a track
suit to be out on the oval tomorrow to
show what he can do.
Freshmen tracksters will have their
last chance to turn out for track tomor
row afternoon. If there is not a marked
increase in the number of freshmen on
the oval at tomorrow's workouts, the
freshman meet with the University of
California will he called off, according
to announcement made today. At pres
ent there are less than twenty-five men
that come out every night, and many of
these men are inexperienced. In pre
vious years there have been at least
twice* this number out and often more
than three times as many. The Cali
fornia babes have over ninety men to
pick their team from.
Efforts have been made to secure some
high school team to compete with the
freshmen tomorrow, and there is still
a possibility that one can be gotten. If
there is none available, Captain Teits
worth of the varsity will have those
men who are out, if a sufficient number
show up, compete among themselves.
