# VARSITY BASEBALL TEAM TO PLAY WINGED O MEN
## 
### 
SATURDAY afternoon the varsity
will play the Olympic Club base
ball team in the first contest of a two
game series. Newlands will occupy
the mound for the varsity and Jourg
will work behind the bat. The Olym
pic Club has a strong battery and the
rest of the team is made up of Coast
League and semi-professional players.
The Winged O'men defeated the Uni
versity of California team last Wed
nesday; so the game here on Saturday
will give Stanford fans an opportunity
to see how the varsity stacks up
against the U. C. men.
The infield will be composed of Pike
at first, Kallam at second, Galloway
at short and Stevens at third. Lilly,

Needliam, and Parker will work in
the outfield.
Newlands has been pitching top
notch ball and has been hitting the
horsehule for safeties. He will bat in
the clean-up position tomorrow. Fair
childs and Pelouze will be ready to
take the slab in an emergency and if
the Olympic men take too strongly to
their offerings, "Mush" Stevens may
take a try at the pitching game.
The Stanford hitters will step to the
plate in the following order: Lilly,
cf.; Stevens, 3b; Galloway, ss.; New
lands, p.; Kallam, 2b; Needham, If.;
Parker, rf.; Pike, lb; Jourg, c.
The game will start at 3.
