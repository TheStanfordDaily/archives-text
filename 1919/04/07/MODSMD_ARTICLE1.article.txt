No exceptional times were made, al

competition in the sprints and hurdles.
The javelin, hammer throw, and two
mile events were not held.
Stanford's showing was not what it
ordinarily would have been, on account
of injuries which kept several men out
of the meet. Dinkelspiel and Maynard
are temporarily out of the sprints and
quarter, while Hutchinson is unable to
pole vault on account of an injured
wrist.
Wells Wins Hurdles

not so fortunate in clearing the sticks

a hurdle, leaving U. S. C. the first two
places.
Paddock, the Southern sprinter, took
the hundred yard event from Lilly, in
10;l-5 seconds. He likewise nosed out
Wells in the 220-yard dash.
