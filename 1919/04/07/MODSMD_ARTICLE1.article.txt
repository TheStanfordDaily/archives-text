# STANFORD ARTISTS DEFEAT U.S.C. BY SCORE OF 72 TO 41
## GREEN IS CARDINAL STAR Wells of Stanford Noses Out Southern Man in High Hurdle Race 
### 
STANFORD'S track and field artists
easily defeated the University of
Southern California aggregation, Fri
day afternoon, by a score of 72 to 41.
No exceptional times were made, al
though the Trojans furnished strong
competition in the sprints and hurdles.
The javelin, hammer throw, and two
mile events were not held.
Stanford's showing was not what it
ordinarily would have been, on account
of injuries which kept several men out
of the meet. Dinkelspiel and Maynard
are temporarily out of the sprints and
quarter, while Hutchinson is unable to
pole vault on account of an injured
wrist.
Wells Wins Hurdles
The feature event of the day was the
high hurdles in which Wells for Stan
ford nosed out Gasner of U. S. C, by
a little less than one foot. Wells was
not so fortunate in clearing the sticks
in the 220-yard event and tripped on
a hurdle, leaving U. S. C. the first two
places.
Paddock, the Southern sprinter, took
the hundred yard event from Lilly, in
10;l-5 seconds. He likewise nosed out
Wells in the 220-yard dash.
Green Clears 12 Ft. 6 In.
Norman Green, '21, performed the
most remarkable feat of the day, when
he cleared the bar in the pole vault at
a height of 12 feet 6 inches. He was
high score man of the meet, making
16 points by taking first places in the
discus and high jump, and third in the
high hurdles.
Westwick won the mile in 4:45.4, with
fifty yards to spare and Teitsworth was
easily the best man in the 880-yard,
making 2:04.1, without being pressed.
