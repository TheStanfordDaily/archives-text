# 1922 Meet With Bruins Uncertain
## Poor time Made in Informal Workout on Saturdayâ€”Schlaudeman Stars 
### 
Though many freshmen turned out for
the informal meet last Saturday after
noon, the chances for a freshman meet
with California are still uncertain unless
the babes turn out in good shape for
the interclass meet next Saturday. If
the 1922 runners cannot show a hun
dred per cent more speed in the two
meets this week than they showed in
the meet Saturday, the chances for win
ing the California meet are very slight.
1 112 more class is not shown, Captain
Teitsworth of the varsity will call off
the meet with the California freshmen,
lie said today, "I would rather not have
any meet at all than to see the fresh
men beaten by a score of 90-9, and this
will surely happen if the team that goes
up against California is anything like
the team that ran Saturday."
The freshmen will not have lack of
coaching to lay the blame to if they
ire not successful for next week Coach
Evans, Captain Teitsworth and "beg'
i Murray will devote all their time to
| helping the freshmen that are out on the
track. Tluis far this season there have
been too many men coming out on the
track and trying to work out Without
j any instruction as to how to go about it.
\s the varflty is coming along in good
iit tliis week and the babes will be taught
il this week and the babes wil lbe taught
the rudiments of track. According to
Teitsworth, there are very few men in
the freshman class that are at home on
j the track.
If Saturday's meet did nothing else, it
showed just how much would have to
be done before a team would be ready
to meet the I?ruin cubs. Only one man,
