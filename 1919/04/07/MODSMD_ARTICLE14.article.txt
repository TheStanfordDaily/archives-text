# PLANS FOR WEEK-END

### 
"j|j& plans that are being laid for the coming week-end of
\<«[AJSrj student 'body activity cannot but meet with the hearty
e I support and approval of the students on the campus. Starting
Friday with the crew dance and extending Saturday through the
interclass track meet and the athletic carnival at the lake in the evening,
there is sufficient to demand the entire attention of the students sufficiently
to deter them from other pursuits for once, and help make the undertakings
of the student body the unqualified success that they deserve to be made.
Now is the time to start thinking about the coming week-end, and to reach
a definite conclusion to help in the making of this week-end one of the biggest
in recent history of the University. There is exceptional opportunity to com
bine business with pleasure without subordinating either.
The finances of the student body cry for assistance; this assistance is
sought, not through campaigns for the raising of funds, but through the sale
of wares that ought to bring sufficient recompense for the outlay of the indi
vidual in each case. The crew calls for support, the track team calls for
Bupport, all the athletic teams call for support. This time it is not mere at
tendance at games or regattas that is desired. It is the painful separation
from hard eamcu, 1)111 easil y spent, nickels that Is wanted in support of the
University activities.
In return for spending time and money on the campus during the next week
end, the Stanford student can look forward to three main sources of reward.
(1) The satisfaction of having been a Stanford student and of having helped
Stanford activities, (2) the enjoyment of the actual time spent, and (3) the
ultimate benefit of seeing Stanford crews once again victorious in representa
tive regattas, a Stanford track team represented at the Pacific Coast Confer
ence meet in Seattle and other Stanford activities booming.
It is not often during a college year that college activities call for real
financial support. When the call is made, however, it is for a purpose that
cannot be doubted as a good purpose and on a basis that cannot be regarded
other than as a good basis. The crew dance, the athletic carnival at the lake
are here for that purpose next week-end. It is time to lay plans to attend
both of these.
