# CARDINAL PROSPECTS LOOK GOOD ON TRACK AND FIELD
## Old-Timers Add Strength to Team 
### Jessee E. Thrash, '21 
Now that Stanford and California
have met a common rival on the cin
derpath, track fans are beginning to
add up alternate columns of figures
with the usual comments that this or
that man looks better than the other.
The remarkable feature of these dop
stcrs figures is that with every day the
season nears May 3, the total of the red
column grown larger while the blue
sum looks correspondingly smaller.
True enough, California piled up a
higher score against the Trojans in
the meets last week-end than the Stan
ford track men, but a careful study of
the comparative results shows the
Cardinal and Blue and Gold forces
evenly matched at present.
Several points should be taken into
account in comparing the scores of the
recent meets. In addition to getting
the slower part of the competition with
the U. S. C. team, California piled, up
an additional eighteen points in the

javelin, hammer throw, and two-mile
events, in which tho Trojans could
furnish no entries.
Stanford Men Out
On Injuries
Stanford's line-up in Friday's meet
was considerably weakened by men who
were temporarily out of the running
on account of injuries. Dinkelspiel and
Maynard would both have been good
for additional points in the sprints and
quarter-mile while Hitchinson in the
pole vault could have easily taken a
second had he been in the meet.
None of these men are out perma
nently and all three can he counted on
to take points in the hig meet on May
3. Observers of the meet at Berkeley
on Saturday are confident that the
Bruins put all the effort they possessed
into the contest.
Old Men Return to
Cardinal Ranks
Many former track and field stars
have returned to fill up gaps in the
Cardinal line-up. In the quarter-mile
and relay, Ht R. Hurtel, '18, and Kin
ney Wright, '21, who have just register
ed, can he depended on to do the one
lap event around 51 seconds. "Milt"
Samis. '20, adds additional strength to
the squad of men in the distances while
George 1. Lynn, '18, will count for
points in the broad jump.
Perhaps the best bit of news to Stan
ford track fans is the arrival of "Dink"
Templeton. '18, on the campus. Tempe
ton announces that he will register and
will be eligible for the track varsity.

This gives the Cardinal additional
strength in the jumps, which are the
weakest events at the present time.
California Runners
Not Yet in Condition
It would not be just to the reader to
convey the impression so early in the
season that the supporters of the Car
dinal are the only ones who look op
timistically at the coming athletic clash.
Californians point out with very good
reason that their men began training
later than the athletes on the "Farm,"
and that they have a bigger margin
for improvement than the Stanford
team. Coach Christie lias always been
famous for developing "hark horses"
and can be counted on this year to
spring the usual number of surprises.
Ihe Bruins will be competing on
their own oval and, knowing the ground,
will have the edge on a visiting team.
California looks unusually weak in
tlie sprints. Purnoll, the dusky sprinter
on last year's squad, seems to be out
of the running and leaves Cantelow as
the only Blue and Gold prospect in the
sprinting field. With Lilly, Maynard,
and Dinkelspiel, Stanford should figure
at least sixteen points in these events.
In the hurdles, "Jess" Wells, could
take two first places without surprising
anyone down the Peninsula who has
seen him clearing the sticks this year,
lie is also a good prospect for the 220-
yard dash.
Carl Geoppart, the Bruins' favorite
in the quarter-mile, is the most likely
candidate for first honors in that event,
although he will have to force the pace
quite a bit faster than he has done so
far this year to keep Dinkelspiel and
Wright behind him. Geoppart also
figures as a prospect in the half-mile.
Sprott May Make
Good in 880
"Pesky" Sprott, star 880-yard man in
last year's freshman meet, will be able
to give Captain Teitsworth and Carl
smith some fast competition in that
event. By May 3 it will probably be
necessary to torce the time under two
minutes to beat the speedy football
hero. Sprott also figures in the mile
run hut one thing is certain, if lie makes
the mile under 4 minutes and 40 sec
onds, which will undoubtedly be neces
sary to get in among the first three
places, he will be unable to figure in
the running in the 880. As the outlook
now stands, Sprott will be a strong con
tender for first in one of these two
events.
In the two-mile, California has very
little to offer in the way of competition
and with Westwick, Keech, Samis,
Perkins, and Hartman in the field it
would not be surprising to see the
Cardinal men repeat last year's perform
ance and take all three places.
In the field events, the Berkeley team
promises to put up a harder fight than
in the races. Merchant. Majors and
Jackson are the leading stars in this
field and all of them are sure point
winners. Stanford is reasonably sure
of two places in the pole vault but will
have to earn everything else on the field.
Caughey is probably good for first in
the shot, and Green seems to be able to
equal Merchant in discus. *
Jackson should put a blue mark across
several points in the broad jump and
high jump although the return of
Templcton nad Lynn cuts down the
probable number of points for the Blue
and Gold prospects.
The relay this season should be one
of the fastest in years. California
claims several speedy quarter-milers to
back up Geoppart in this event and with
Dinkelspiel and Maynard back on the
oval, Stanford should be able to put a
51-flat team in the field. Wright and
Seofield both promise to make that good
a record by the time the meet is sched
uled.
With the cardinal hue slowly pushing
the blue off the dope sheet, Stanford
track and field men are not slowing up
in their training, but arc redoubling
their efforts every day to repeat the per
formance of the past six years and
make this the seventh straight victory
over the Blue and Gold track forces.
