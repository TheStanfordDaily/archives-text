# HEADWAY MADE IN PERMANENT TIES FOR FRATERNITIES
## SUCCESSFUL IN THE EAST Conference Idea Expected Soon to Be Working Organiation 
### W.E. Redwine, '18 
During the past month there lias been
considerable discussion at Stanford con
cerning an interfraternity conference. A
great deal of headway has been already
made toward the permanent organiza
tion o fsuch a conference.
The interfraternity conference idea,
although never worked out before at
Stanford, is not new. In various East
ern communities it has been tried with
considerable success "and benefit, There
is no question but tht there are func
tions which a conference of this nature
can perform, and it is the keen realiza
tion o fthis fact which has led the fra
ternities on the Stanford campus to
resolve themselves to form such an or
ganization. While there are many bene
fits to be derived by such action, it
should not be forgotten that there are
likewise many inherently perplexing
problems in connection, not only with
its formation but also with its continued
and successful operation. And it is upon
these problems that the fraternities are
now working.
Mutual Interest Eixists
Between Fraternities
In any university community where
fraternities exist there arises immediate
ly a mutual and common interest be
tween the university and the fraternities.
And as between the fraternities them
selves, there are mutual interests, inter
ests which cannot be fully and com
pletely developed without some form of
strong, centralized organization. These
facts are recognized today as never be
fore, and it is with the determination
to develop these interests, the interests
of the university, the interests of the
fraternities and university community
life that the fraternities are now in the
process of forming a conference.
Several meetings have been held com
rising representatives of all the fraterni
ties on the campus, an da broad out
line of the organization and its policy
has practically been formulated. Lee
Rogers, 17, has been ably acting as
chairman of these meetings. For the
past week an appointed committee has
been busy drafting a constitution for the
proposed conference. This constitution
will be submitted to the representatives
of the various fraternities at an informal
meeting this week. They will in turn
place the constitution before their re
spective chapters for ratification. Upon
ratification by the fraternities, the inter
fraternity conference will come into ex
istence, something new in the history
of the University and the local chap
ters and something which is hoped and
expected will do much to foster and ad
vance the interests of both the Uni
versity and the fraternities.
An Experiment, But Not
A Speculative One
In one sense of the word an inter
fraternity conference at Stanford is an
experiment, but it is not a hazy specu
lative experiment; it is rather an ex
periment upon which the fraternities
have determined and resolved themselves
to make a success. And with the con
fidence of the community and the loyal
and united support of the fraternities
there is no reason why this proposed
conference should not soon be a confer
ence in fact, to the betterment of all
concerned.
