# THE 						VARSITY NINE IS STRONG
## California Series Will Start on April 19 
### E.E. Crowe, '21 
Comparisons between the Stanford
varsity baseball team and the California
varsity do not look favorable for the
Cardinal men at present ,if the com
parison is made on the basis of games
won and lost this season. But Coach
"Bob" Evans has been experimenting
in all the games so far in an effort to
find the right combinations for his club.
He has used his whole squad in several
games and has played the men in several
different positions trying to find the
best team to put on the field for the
California series.
The return of "Bill" Pike, captain
and first sacker on the 1920 team, and
Jourg, catcher on the same club, is a
big aid to the varsity. "Gus," however,
has failed to register, so the pitching
department remains in much the same
condition as it was last quarter.
Infield is Playing
Airtight Ball
Teubner and Pike are putting up a
hard fight for the first base. Teubner
seems to have the edge in fielding, but
Pike takes the lead in hitting and in
experience. Kallam is a fixture on sec
ond, and his speed around the keystone
sack is the best seen* here since the days
of "Mel" Shriver. He has also been
stepping into the ball of late for bingles.
"Jim" Galloway, skipper and shortstop,
has the strongest throwing arm of any
man on the squad and his fielding in the
short field is the most reliable in the
infield. Galloway gets his hits regularly
and is hitting third in the batting order.
"Mush" Stevens on third base is the
oldest man in point of service on the
team. "Mush" takes them from all sides
and is probably the best hitter on the
club. Doe and Hunter are two other
candidates for the infield who arc show
ing up well.
In the outfield, Evans has been work
ing several different men. Lilly is a
fixture in center in fielding, but he ha£
been hitting far below his past record,
left and right gardens have been
jpied by Needham, Parker, Crowe,
ne, Pike, and Caughey with varying
ults. Most of these men arc weak
KJI I fly balls.
Newlands Probably
Will Open California Series
Pelouze has shown lots of stuff in the

last two games. He has worked in the
box and if he keeps the present gait,
he will figure in the California series.
He mixes up a slow curve with a good
fast ball, and succeeded in puzzling both
the Santa Clara hitters and the Olympic
Club men. With a little more work,
he will develop into a first-class twirler.
Newlands has been showing the best
form of any of the pitchers and he will
probably open the California series on
the 19th of this month. "Mush" Stevens
is doing some work in the box in case
of an emergency, and Fairchilds and
Knox arc hooking 'em over in good
shape.
Bundy is hard to beat when it somes
to back-stopping and holding up the
pitchers. He is a fair hitter, bu,t his
greatest weakness is base throwing.
Lately he has shown improvement, and
his arm may round into shape in time
for the big series. Jourg is a fair re
ceiver and throws to bases like a veteran
catcher. He is weak on hitting, how
ever, but with a little more practice
he may get his eye on the ball.
Ellison and Murchio Show
Great Form for California
The Blue and Gold men have a great
advantage in having a strong battery.
Ellison and Murchio worked in last
year's series and are capable and re
liable pitchers. Dexter is a good catcher
and is a veteran on the California
varsity. The of the team is fairly
good with Captain Claude Rowher in
the infield and Myers playing a sensa
tional game in centerfield. According
to those who have seen the California
club in action, they appear to be a better
hitting club than the Cardinals, but
weaker on the defensive.
Coach Evans' Illness
Handicaps Varsity
The Stanford club has been handi
capped the last ten days by the absence
of Coach Evans on account of illness,
but he is back on the field now and
working with the squad. His problems
will be to get the right combinations and
develop more hitting power, and if this
is done, Stanford will have nearly an
even break in the big series.
The first game will be played on the
Stanford diamond on April 19. The
second game will be played at Berkeley
on April 26, and the final game will be
played here on' May 2.

find the right combinations for his club.
He has used his whole squad in several
games and has played the men in several
different positions trying to find the
best team to put on the field for the
California series.
The return of "Bill" Pike, captain
and first sacker on the 1920 team, and
Jourg, catcher on the same club, is a
big aid to the varsity. "Gus," however,
has failed to register, so the pitching
department remains in much the same
condition as it was last quarter.
Infield is Playing
Airtight Ball
Teubner and Pike are putting up a
hard fight for the first base. Teubner
seems to have the edge in fielding, but
Pike takes the lead in hitting and in
experience. Kallam is a fixture on sec
ond, and his speed around the keystone
sack is the best seen* here since the days
of "Mel" Shriver. He has also been
stepping into the ball of late for bingles.
"Jim" Galloway, skipper and shortstop,
has the strongest throwing arm of any
man on the squad and his fielding in the
short field is the most reliable in the
infield. Galloway gets his hits regularly
and is hitting third in the batting order.
"Mush" Stevens on third base is the
oldest man in point of service on the
team. "Mush" takes them from all sides
and is probably the best hitter on the
club. Doe and Hunter are two other
candidates for the infield who arc show
ing up well.
In the outfield, Evans has been work
ing several different men. Lilly is a
fixture in center in fielding, but he ha£
been hitting far below his past record,
left and right gardens have been
jpied by Needham, Parker, Crowe,
ne, Pike, and Caughey with varying
ults. Most of these men arc weak
KJI I fly balls.
Newlands Probably
Will Open California Series
Pelouze has shown lots of stuff in the

last two games. He has worked in the
box and if he keeps the present gait,
he will figure in the California series.
He mixes up a slow curve with a good
fast ball, and succeeded in puzzling both
the Santa Clara hitters and the Olympic
Club men. With a little more work,
he will develop into a first-class twirler.
Newlands has been showing the best
form of any of the pitchers and he will
probably open the California series on
the 19th of this month. "Mush" Stevens
is doing some work in the box in case
of an emergency, and Fairchilds and
Knox arc hooking 'em over in good
shape.
Bundy is hard to beat when it somes
to back-stopping and holding up the
pitchers. He is a fair hitter, bu,t his
greatest weakness is base throwing.
Lately he has shown improvement, and
his arm may round into shape in time
for the big series. Jourg is a fair re
ceiver and throws to bases like a veteran
catcher. He is weak on hitting, how
ever, but with a little more practice
he may get his eye on the ball.
Ellison and Murchio Show
Great Form for California
The Blue and Gold men have a great
advantage in having a strong battery.
Ellison and Murchio worked in last
year's series and are capable and re
liable pitchers. Dexter is a good catcher
and is a veteran on the California
varsity. The of the team is fairly
good with Captain Claude Rowher in
the infield and Myers playing a sensa
tional game in centerfield. According
to those who have seen the California
club in action, they appear to be a better
hitting club than the Cardinals, but
weaker on the defensive.
Coach Evans' Illness
Handicaps Varsity
The Stanford club has been handi
capped the last ten days by the absence
of Coach Evans on account of illness,
but he is back on the field now and
working with the squad. His problems
will be to get the right combinations and
develop more hitting power, and if this
is done, Stanford will have nearly an
even break in the big series.
The first game will be played on the
Stanford diamond on April 19. The
second game will be played at Berkeley
on April 26, and the final game will be
played here on' May 2.
Comparisons between the Stanford
varsity baseball team and the California
varsity do not look favorable for the
Cardinal men at present ,if the com
parison is made on the basis of games
won and lost this season. But Coach
"Bob" Evans has been experimenting
in all the games so far in an effort to
find the right combinations for his club.
