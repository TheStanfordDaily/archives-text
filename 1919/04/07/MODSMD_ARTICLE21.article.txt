# Schubert Club Wants Tryoutees
## 
### 
With the incoming "pep" of this
quarter, and with the aroused interest
in athletics and campus affairs in gen
eral, how about Schubert Club, girls?
Once, not very long ago either, this
organization was actually prominent in
campus life. We've survived the war,
too, but we only need reviving after
our noble amazon struggle. Did you
notice all the names of girls who tried
out for Junior Opera? If only half
of them would come and try out for
Schubert we could stage an opera our
selves. Who knows until you try?

The point is: Schubert still IS, and
is going to be great in the future. The
members are planning a stunt for the
carnival. It will be something on the
order of fair, strolling, minstrel maids,
with an aim to fill in the cracks (pardon
you) left by the jokes of others. Also
it will give you a rare treat of real
music. We need help tho.
Get enthused 500, and let's have a
real thing. Here's a chance for the wo
men to show some old-time spirit. Try
out at least! You might even surprise
yourself with your ability.
