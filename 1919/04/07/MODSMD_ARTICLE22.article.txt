# 1920 QUAD TO BE LARGEST EDITION EVER PUBLISHED
## MANY NEW DEPARTMENTS Service and Alumni Pages Will Be Features of Yearbook 
### W.F. Leiser, '21 
"No less than 564 pages will appear in
the 1920 Quad," was the definite an
nouncement made by the editors of the
Junior Book, Miss Dorothy Driscoll
and L. VV. Dinkelspiel, in an interview
today. This will make the new year
book by a considerable margin practic
ally the largest ever published at Stan
ford. "At least 522 pages will consti
tute solid reading matter without ad
vertisements," is the further statement
of the editors.
The dummy is now nearly complete,
and as outlined is one of the most
elaborate on record. All of the better
and more popular sections of previous
Quads are duplicated and enlarged in
this, and together with several distinct
ly new departments make up the con
tents of the publication. The abundance
of cuts, snaps, and pictures which are
to appear in the book is also a great
reason for its increase in volume.
Junior Photographic Section
Of Normal Size
The Junior photographic section is of
normal size, exhibiting some 235 or more
students of the '20 designation. The
cuts are larger and of a slightly differ
ent character than previously, however,
both in the type of picture shown, and
in the quality of engraving. Practically
all Juniors will be included as arrange
ments have been made to take care of
those who have just returned this!
quarter.
The new alumni or "Stanford Men"
section has developed in fine style, as
the statement has been made that the
graduates have responded magnificent
ly to the letters and questionnaires sent
out by the management to learn of the
activities and successes of those who
have gone from the Cardinal ranks.
Pictures of the most prominent and
successful graduates who have distin
guished themselves both in private busi
ness and in government service other
than military will appear in this depart
ment. The well-known Stanfordites,
such and Herbert Hoover and Charles
Field, together with a number of men
who though not so well-known on the
campus, are just as distinguished, as
Mr. Henry Suzzallo, now president of
the University of Washington, and also
certain prominent athletes as R. Lindley
Murray of national tennis fame, arc in
cluded in this section.
Art Work is One of the
Stellar Features
One of the stellar features of this
year's Quad will be found in the art
work, owing to the fact that Mr. Pedro
J. Lemos, curator of the Stanford Mu
seum, and known to be one of the best
artists in California, has complete charge
of the work, and is devoting a great part
of his time and ability to making this
portion of the yearbook distinctive and
superior in character. All of the work
is done by or under the personal direc
tion of Mr. Lemos, while Miss Mary
Largent is the student supervisor in
charge of this department.
Among the work of Mr. Lemos are
four full-size color plates, somewhat
similar to those of last year's book. The
plates of the 1919 Quad are well-known
for their excellence in portraying Stan
ford views, while the new color prints
are declared to be of even finer quality.
Mr. Lemos has worked out a number of
additional color features.
11. G. Swendsen has charge of the
Athletic Section, and with the assist
ance of Jessee E. Thrash, '21, is mak
ing this one of the Quad's largest de
partments. The fall and winter varsity
sports are already completed, written
up and arranged for printing, while
Swendsen has his assistants busy tabu
lating the results of, and preparing sec
tions for the acitivitics now in progress.

Cuts of atheletes and of the Cardinal
and opposing teams in action will abound
in the completed work.
Service Section Will Be One
Of Yearbook's Best
The large service section, will, how
ever, be one of the finest in the year
book. The staff has in its possession
pictures and snaps of Stanford soldiers
and officers taken near scenes of action
in France, in Germany, and on other
fronts, as well as a number of interest
ing snaps of men in training camps and
other stations of the states. This sec
tion is still in the process of accumula
tion, as additional cuts and stories are
arriving daily. It is possible that not
all the material available can he included
in the space allotted to this section; but
the best, the most typical and repre
sentative of the various fields of activity,
together with the more novel portray
als of interesting and peculiar circum
stances and adventures at the front and
elsewhere abroad, will be printed in the
service department.
It is rumored-that the management
has evidence to show that not the least
exciting of the episodes in the careers
of our fighters abroad were enacted in
such places as Paris or others equally
distant from the firing line and the
Boches. The staff has a very complete
history, and some new snaps of the
ambulance units which operated in Italy,
France, and other fields.
Only a portion of the Quad contents
is accounted for above, according to the
co-editors, who assert that other feat
ures of the book are of a similar high
character. It will be the policy of the
management to announce the nature of
the various other sections rnd elements
as soon as they arc completed in suf
ficient degree to make certain their exact
character.

and L. VV. Dinkelspiel, in an interview
today. This will make the new year
book by a considerable margin practic
ally the largest ever published at Stan
ford. "At least 522 pages will consti
tute solid reading matter without ad
vertisements," is the further statement
of the editors.
The dummy is now nearly complete,
and as outlined is one of the most
elaborate on record. All of the better
and more popular sections of previous
Quads are duplicated and enlarged in
this, and together with several distinct
ly new departments make up the con
tents of the publication. The abundance
of cuts, snaps, and pictures which are
to appear in the book is also a great
reason for its increase in volume.
Junior Photographic Section
Of Normal Size
The Junior photographic section is of
normal size, exhibiting some 235 or more
students of the '20 designation. The
cuts are larger and of a slightly differ
ent character than previously, however,
both in the type of picture shown, and
in the quality of engraving. Practically
all Juniors will be included as arrange
ments have been made to take care of
those who have just returned this!
quarter.
The new alumni or "Stanford Men"
section has developed in fine style, as
the statement has been made that the
graduates have responded magnificent
ly to the letters and questionnaires sent
out by the management to learn of the
activities and successes of those who
have gone from the Cardinal ranks.
Pictures of the most prominent and
successful graduates who have distin
guished themselves both in private busi
ness and in government service other
than military will appear in this depart
ment. The well-known Stanfordites,
such and Herbert Hoover and Charles
Field, together with a number of men
who though not so well-known on the
campus, are just as distinguished, as
Mr. Henry Suzzallo, now president of
the University of Washington, and also
certain prominent athletes as R. Lindley
Murray of national tennis fame, arc in
cluded in this section.
Art Work is One of the
Stellar Features
One of the stellar features of this
year's Quad will be found in the art
work, owing to the fact that Mr. Pedro
J. Lemos, curator of the Stanford Mu
seum, and known to be one of the best
artists in California, has complete charge
of the work, and is devoting a great part
of his time and ability to making this
portion of the yearbook distinctive and
superior in character. All of the work
is done by or under the personal direc
tion of Mr. Lemos, while Miss Mary
Largent is the student supervisor in
charge of this department.
Among the work of Mr. Lemos are
four full-size color plates, somewhat
similar to those of last year's book. The
plates of the 1919 Quad are well-known
for their excellence in portraying Stan
ford views, while the new color prints
are declared to be of even finer quality.
Mr. Lemos has worked out a number of
additional color features.
11. G. Swendsen has charge of the
Athletic Section, and with the assist
ance of Jessee E. Thrash, '21, is mak
ing this one of the Quad's largest de
partments. The fall and winter varsity
sports are already completed, written
up and arranged for printing, while
Swendsen has his assistants busy tabu
lating the results of, and preparing sec
tions for the acitivitics now in progress.

Cuts of atheletes and of the Cardinal
and opposing teams in action will abound
in the completed work.
Service Section Will Be One
Of Yearbook's Best
The large service section, will, how
ever, be one of the finest in the year
book. The staff has in its possession
pictures and snaps of Stanford soldiers
and officers taken near scenes of action
in France, in Germany, and on other
fronts, as well as a number of interest
ing snaps of men in training camps and
other stations of the states. This sec
tion is still in the process of accumula
tion, as additional cuts and stories are
arriving daily. It is possible that not
all the material available can he included
in the space allotted to this section; but
the best, the most typical and repre
sentative of the various fields of activity,
together with the more novel portray
als of interesting and peculiar circum
stances and adventures at the front and
elsewhere abroad, will be printed in the
service department.
It is rumored-that the management
has evidence to show that not the least
exciting of the episodes in the careers
of our fighters abroad were enacted in
such places as Paris or others equally
distant from the firing line and the
Boches. The staff has a very complete
history, and some new snaps of the
ambulance units which operated in Italy,
France, and other fields.
Only a portion of the Quad contents
is accounted for above, according to the
co-editors, who assert that other feat
ures of the book are of a similar high
character. It will be the policy of the
management to announce the nature of
the various other sections rnd elements
as soon as they arc completed in suf
ficient degree to make certain their exact
character.
"No less than 564 pages will appear in
the 1920 Quad," was the definite an
nouncement made by the editors of the
Junior Book, Miss Dorothy Driscoll
and L. VV. Dinkelspiel, in an interview
today. This will make the new year

of the editors.
The dummy is now nearly complete,
and as outlined is one of the most
elaborate on record. All of the better
and more popular sections of previous
Quads are duplicated and enlarged in
this, and together with several distinct
ly new departments make up the con
tents of the publication. The abundance
of cuts, snaps, and pictures which are
to appear in the book is also a great
reason for its increase in volume.
Junior Photographic Section
Of Normal Size
The Junior photographic section is of
normal size, exhibiting some 235 or more
students of the '20 designation. The
cuts are larger and of a slightly differ
ent character than previously, however,
both in the type of picture shown, and
in the quality of engraving. Practically
all Juniors will be included as arrange
ments have been made to take care of
those who have just returned this!
quarter.
The new alumni or "Stanford Men"
section has developed in fine style, as
the statement has been made that the
graduates have responded magnificent
ly to the letters and questionnaires sent
out by the management to learn of the
activities and successes of those who
have gone from the Cardinal ranks.
Pictures of the most prominent and
successful graduates who have distin
guished themselves both in private busi
ness and in government service other
than military will appear in this depart
ment. The well-known Stanfordites,
such and Herbert Hoover and Charles
Field, together with a number of men
who though not so well-known on the
campus, are just as distinguished, as
Mr. Henry Suzzallo, now president of
the University of Washington, and also
certain prominent athletes as R. Lindley
Murray of national tennis fame, arc in
cluded in this section.
Art Work is One of the
Stellar Features
One of the stellar features of this
year's Quad will be found in the art
work, owing to the fact that Mr. Pedro
J. Lemos, curator of the Stanford Mu
seum, and known to be one of the best
artists in California, has complete charge
of the work, and is devoting a great part
of his time and ability to making this
portion of the yearbook distinctive and
superior in character. All of the work
is done by or under the personal direc
tion of Mr. Lemos, while Miss Mary
Largent is the student supervisor in
charge of this department.
Among the work of Mr. Lemos are
four full-size color plates, somewhat
similar to those of last year's book. The
plates of the 1919 Quad are well-known
for their excellence in portraying Stan
ford views, while the new color prints
are declared to be of even finer quality.
Mr. Lemos has worked out a number of
additional color features.
11. G. Swendsen has charge of the
Athletic Section, and with the assist
ance of Jessee E. Thrash, '21, is mak
ing this one of the Quad's largest de
partments. The fall and winter varsity
sports are already completed, written
up and arranged for printing, while
Swendsen has his assistants busy tabu
lating the results of, and preparing sec
tions for the acitivitics now in progress.

Cuts of atheletes and of the Cardinal
and opposing teams in action will abound
in the completed work.
Service Section Will Be One
Of Yearbook's Best
The large service section, will, how
ever, be one of the finest in the year
book. The staff has in its possession
pictures and snaps of Stanford soldiers
and officers taken near scenes of action
in France, in Germany, and on other
fronts, as well as a number of interest
ing snaps of men in training camps and
other stations of the states. This sec
tion is still in the process of accumula
tion, as additional cuts and stories are
arriving daily. It is possible that not
all the material available can he included
in the space allotted to this section; but
the best, the most typical and repre
sentative of the various fields of activity,
together with the more novel portray
als of interesting and peculiar circum
stances and adventures at the front and
elsewhere abroad, will be printed in the
service department.
It is rumored-that the management
has evidence to show that not the least
exciting of the episodes in the careers
of our fighters abroad were enacted in
such places as Paris or others equally
distant from the firing line and the
Boches. The staff has a very complete
history, and some new snaps of the
ambulance units which operated in Italy,
France, and other fields.
Only a portion of the Quad contents
is accounted for above, according to the
co-editors, who assert that other feat
ures of the book are of a similar high
character. It will be the policy of the
management to announce the nature of
the various other sections rnd elements
as soon as they arc completed in suf
ficient degree to make certain their exact
character.
