# SERVICE BOARD WANTS VISITORS AT CLINIC
## 
### 
As the opening feature of tho new
quarter, the Service Board decided
that they would inaugurate a campaign
during the coming week, in an attempt
to make the women of tho campus
realize the great necessity of campus
women visiting the wards of the Stan
ford Clinics in San Francisco. If pos
sible some system by which the liv
ing groups on the campus, may be
held responsible, may be worked out
in the future but at the present time
all of the visiting will be done 011 a
voluntary basis.
This afternoon women were work
ing on the clothes which were col
lected yesterday, and the work will
continue tomorrow. Considerable
mending is necessary and the clothes
have to be packed into the boxes in
which they are to be sent to the
city.
This week-end several boxes will be
sent to the Stanford Clinics, contain
ing clothes, jellies and jams, and flow
ers. All of these contributions from
the campus women make the wards
bright and attractive and some few
patients a little happier. It is hoped
that the campus women will follow up
this work by personal visits to the
Clinics. Mrs. Katherine Barnett is
always ready to welcome the women
of the University and will show them
through the wards.
