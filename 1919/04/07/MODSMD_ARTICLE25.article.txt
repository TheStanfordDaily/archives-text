# EXCUSE FOR EXISTENCE
## 
### 
! appearance of today's edition of the Daily Palo
A <Jk> Alto, the enlargement of the field of the Daily is offi
! AMWiM cially begun. Without attempting to be pretentious in its aspira
tions; without endeavoring to encroach upo nthe field of other
1 publications, the Monday edition of the Daily will attempt to fill a temporary
vacancy in the field of expression of public opinion upon the campus.
Whether the enlarged scope of the campus daily publication is to be per
i manent depends upon whether or not the need for such an nlarged scope con
j tinues to exist. What is this need? That perhaps is the first quqstion that
has to be solved in presenting the campus with something new. The excuse
for existence must be found. It has been th presumption, and an accurate
presumption it most certainly appears to be, that there are many problems
connected with the University student's existence. It has furthermore, been
| the confident assertion that thse problms hav not evadd Stanford in their
disribution. Whether tSanford has more problms or less than other institu
tions is of little prime importance as long as we know that we have some
problems and that these problems most naturally demand solution.
Discussion of Student Problems Desired
With the ralizatlon that we have problems, that these problems demand
solution has come the added suggstion that the best method of solving prob
lems, of clearing the ground for the ultimate constructive solution, at any
raie was open discussion of these problems by members of the student body.
Where was this open disecussion to come from? The Daily threw its columns
open to opinions from members of the student body faculty, and alumni.
'\ he opportunity was probably not formally enough presented and probably
not backed by sufficient incentive to meet with a ready response. There was,
however, some response, and of a sufficient nature to convince us that the
expression of public opinion was but waiting the properoutlet. It is this out
let that the Monday edition seeks to provide recognizing unfortunately that no
other journalism organ on the campus gives this unqualified outlet. Therein
lies the keynote of its existence. It is th oft-attempted and often succssful
forum for discussion idea that prompts the appearance of the four addiional
Monday pages. The other publications upon the campus each exists in its
field and it is not encroaching upon the rights of any to stablisli a forum for
discussion, information, enlightenment, and interest.
Having thus shown that the reason of existence was the need for the
opportunity of discussion and the need of discussion itself let us now see what
the scope of the Monday Daily is to be. The news of the campus will be pre
sente<Mo the campus as usual; the additional four pages are thrown open to
the best articles most appropriate for each week, turned into the paper and
signed by the authors. If any one has an opinion that is worth while express
ing the Daily invites unqualified expression of it. There is to be no censor
ship within the bounds of reason; the praise of censorship of the student body
is all that is needed.
Scope Is Not Intended as Narrow
The scope is not to be a narrow one, however, for, despite the contrary j
belief, college students are interested in matters beyond the ken of their col
legeiate existence. The Daily would welcome articles from any of the faculty,
from any of the alumni, from any of the prominent visitors at the University
who care to discuss any problem of interest to the student in the University,
either as a student of the University or as a future citizen of the community.
There is no special type of article required, there is no spcial type even de
sired, other than that it be an article that will interest people.
Thus we have found one of the needs upon the campus to be discussion
and opportunity to discuss, and thus have we attempted to broaden *he scope
of the Daily so that it will meet this need so that in meetng this need, it
will help in the solution of problems of the "University and the problems of
the University students.
