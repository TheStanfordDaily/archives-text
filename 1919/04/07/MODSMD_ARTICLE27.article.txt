# PLANS MADE FOR CARNIVAL
## Concessions and Dancing to Draw Crowds 
### 
. With the committees appointed, amj
many or the plans already made, the
Lake Carnival is proceeding towards
a successful climax. Being something
[entirely new in the way of entertain
ment, the carnival is attracting un
usual interest and attention, since any
future carnival will depend largely
ypon the financial success of this, the
first one.
The committee appointed by Chair
man Roy Hill, '21, met yesterday and
made tentative plans. The chairmen
of these groups will discuss their plans
with Hill tonight, and after that, defi
nite announcements will be made. The
short space of time allowed for the
arrangements to be made in necessi
tates quick work, and every one con
cerned is showing a spirit of co-opera
tion.
According to the latest word, there
will be an interclass track meet in the
afternoon and promptly at 8 o'clock
111 the evening the booths at the lake
will open ,and all kinds of amusements
and concessions will attract the eye
and purse. Canoeing, swimming, and
all manner of lake shorts will hold

sway, and even the crew will partici
pate.
Mysterious rumors are afloat as to
the various concessions. Roble prom
ises a dance which will excel any ever
held before in the way of good music
and uniqueness. The Zete house will
also be open for dancing, both up
stairs and down. Persistent remarks
about the D. IT. booth, with its oriental
dancing specialty, are arousing much
comment, while there are other equal
j ly interesting rumors in the air.
The purpose of the meeting which
will be held in the Union at 7:30 to
night will be to see that no plans con
flict, and that all areapproved, as also
to discuss lighting conditions and the
erection of booths.
The proceeds from this event will
go towards supporting crew, track,
baseball and other activities. Tickets
will be secured from each booth, of
which there will be about ten. Both
boat houses will be utilized, and spe
cial lighting arrangements made. This
is a closed date and dancing and
merrymaking will continue until the
early hours.
