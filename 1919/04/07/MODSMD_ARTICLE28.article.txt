# AMERICANS NOW HAVE RESPONSIBILITIES AS WORLD CITIZENS
## AWAKEN NEW ATTITUDE Backward People Need Help of Our Institutions and Culture 
### S.P. Hollingsworth, '20 
A new lease of life has seized upon
our country as a result of develop
ments at the Peace Conference. It is
safe to say that American thought now
moves the world. Although a South
African officer in the British army de
vised the League of Nations principle,
American statesmen have given the
principle life through intelligent sup
port and criticism.
The World
Looks to America
The eyes of the world today are
turned toward America. The starv
ing peoples of central Europe look to
this country for assistance in their
hour of misery. The poor suffering
vestige of humanity that populates the
southeastern section of Europe awaits
expectantly the decision of America.
Proud and powerful Britain must bow
to America whose ideal interpretation
of the war has won an enviable fol
lowing among the weaker nations of
the world.
President Wilson has advanced a
policy of world government. If this
American people accept it. If it fails,
policy isaccepted, it is because the
it will be because our people have
failed to give it a majority support.
Changed
Responsibilities
This change in importance of the
United States in world affairs has
brought a corresponding change in the
American citizen. A change in point
of vieww has been accompanied by a
change in responsibility. The men
and women of this country now feel
it their duty to perform the work of
world citizens as creditably as they
have performed national citizenship.
It is by the degree of responsibility
which American citizens can display
that the younger nations are to be
guided to security.
This Country Can
Help Backward Peoples
It is this country which has been
asked to perform the monumental task
of restoring peace and order in the
world. We are eminently fitted for
the work because America is blessed
with leaders, organizers, and re
sources. It is American ideas, money,
manufacturers, and raw materials that,
are being used to restore, to feed and
will he operative as soon as the peo
ple of Europe. Those people who are
dependent on us now will very likely
he dependent on us for years to come.
The Influence of
American Institutions
A tremendous influence will he ex
erted by this gratuitous assistance. It
will be followed by other extensions of
American culture. Our system of edu
cation will open the door of knowl
edge to millions of human beings. The
republican â€¢ principle of government
will be operative as soon ts the peo
ple learn something of the way it is
conducted. Industries and a civilized
form of living will flourish where bar
barity existed before.
American engineers will be sent out
to build railroads, to span river
gulches, and build bridges across wide
rivers. The prospectors will be the
vanguard of the settlers, men and
women who will carry froward the
American idea.
The world is watching America. The
people of this country are setting an
example in citizenship that the back
ward people are going to follow. Our
responsibility then is doubly great.
Aside from our own interests to watch,
we must now look after the interests
and needs of other pooples.
