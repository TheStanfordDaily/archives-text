# CREW PROSPECTS LOOM BRIGHT FOR VARSITY AND FRESHMAN SHELLS
## 
### Neil H. Petree, '19 
Cardinal crew prospects loom
brighter every day, and after watching
the rival oarsmen work out, and pe-
I rusing the opposing list of eligibles,
one comes to the conclusion that Stan
ford is going to be well up amongst
them on the morning of May 3d. Not
only the varsity, but the freshmen,
are going in a way that Coach Les
Rogers and Captain Watts have noth
ing but priase for them.
On the varsity there are now
twelve men showing form that leaves
little to choose as to which ones will
be on the final eight. Roy King, who
has just returned from service over
seas, will undoubtedly row in his old
position at stroke, with Captain
Frank Watts behind him at number 7.
McGillvray, Davis, and Williamson
have been holding down the 5, 4, and
3 positions regularly of late, and may
sit in the final boat in these places
but there are chances of shifts even
here. At number G, Adams and Wy
choff are putting up a good battle, and
for number 2 Moore, Patrick, and Gary
all look good. In the bow, Wilbur and
Vietor appear to be the best bets.
Stamp and Tauser are old men who
have recently returned to the Uni
versity, and may figure in the com
petition yet.
Many Good Candidates
For Coxswain
For the important place of coxswain,
Coach Rogers is fortunate in having
a number of good candidates out. At
this writing Robbins, Coombs, and
Shipp have excellent chances of mak
ing the boat, but Svlinier, Eickoff, and
Willis are all good with the mega
phone. Rogers has been riding with
the varsity himself a good deal to give
them the advantage of the many point
ers he has picked up in his long serv
ice as a Stanford crew man.
Over at California the varsity is
beaten by the freshmen regularly.
Whether this means a weak varsity
or an exceptionally strong freshman
aggregation is hard to say, but with
only one veteran —Stebbins —back in
the shell, the Cardinal need not have
the fear that we will be up against a
crew of experienced oarsmen. The
Berkeley freshmen eight is undoubt
edly a better crew than the Blue and
Gold have put out in recent years, ex

elusive of the 1919 boat, but will have
their hands full when they meet the
Cardinal "babes."
Freshmen Have
Strong Crew
Captain Watts says that the Stan
ford freshmen have the strongest
crew that a first-year class has turned
out since he has been in college. The
final eight is a long way from being
picked, but Olmstead at stroke, Han
cock, McKinnon, and Snow are all
showing stuff that practically assures
them of places in the boat. Adams,
Sayre, Cornish, Maloney, Dunbar, and
Clark are working in the first shell
regularly. In the coxswain's position,
Bowcher appears to be the best bet,
but Valci has been used some of late.
The whole squad journeys to Red
wood every afternoon of the week, and
on Sunday mornings. Two weeks be-
Theta Xi house and Watts expects to
crew training table will start at the
Theta Xi house and aWtts expects to
have his men in fine shape for the
three-mile grind on the Oakland estu
ary. As has been the custom for the
past few years, the race will be held
the morning of the intercollegiate
track meet, May 3d, and the graduate
managers are making plans to take
care of the immense crowds that at
tend the races. Special trains will
follow the boats down the course, and
tugs will patrol the estuary to keep it
clear of traffic.
1919 Crew Is
Self Supporting
For the importance of the sport, the
amount of work that the participants
putin on it, and the interest that it
carries with it outside the University,
the crew has far too small a following
on the campus. Nearly all the students
go to the big event against the Uni
cally self supporting, as far as the
have little realization of the amount
of work that has been necessary for
the Cardinal oarsmen to do, to build
up a winning boat. Differing from past
years, the 1919 crew will be practi
concerned. With the money subscribed
management of the college finances is
concerned. With the mony subscribed
by the students last quarter, the funds
derived from the crew dance next Fri
day night at Encina, and half of the
proceeds of the lake carnical, it is
hoped that the crew will be able to
meet its expenses.

the rival oarsmen work out, and pe-
I rusing the opposing list of eligibles,
one comes to the conclusion that Stan
ford is going to be well up amongst
them on the morning of May 3d. Not
only the varsity, but the freshmen,
are going in a way that Coach Les
Rogers and Captain Watts have noth
ing but priase for them.
On the varsity there are now
twelve men showing form that leaves
little to choose as to which ones will
be on the final eight. Roy King, who
has just returned from service over
seas, will undoubtedly row in his old
position at stroke, with Captain
Frank Watts behind him at number 7.
McGillvray, Davis, and Williamson
have been holding down the 5, 4, and
3 positions regularly of late, and may
sit in the final boat in these places
but there are chances of shifts even
here. At number G, Adams and Wy
choff are putting up a good battle, and
for number 2 Moore, Patrick, and Gary
all look good. In the bow, Wilbur and
Vietor appear to be the best bets.
Stamp and Tauser are old men who
have recently returned to the Uni
versity, and may figure in the com
petition yet.
Many Good Candidates
For Coxswain
For the important place of coxswain,
Coach Rogers is fortunate in having
a number of good candidates out. At
this writing Robbins, Coombs, and
Shipp have excellent chances of mak
ing the boat, but Svlinier, Eickoff, and
Willis are all good with the mega
phone. Rogers has been riding with
the varsity himself a good deal to give
them the advantage of the many point
ers he has picked up in his long serv
ice as a Stanford crew man.
Over at California the varsity is
beaten by the freshmen regularly.
Whether this means a weak varsity
or an exceptionally strong freshman
aggregation is hard to say, but with
only one veteran —Stebbins —back in
the shell, the Cardinal need not have
the fear that we will be up against a
crew of experienced oarsmen. The
Berkeley freshmen eight is undoubt
edly a better crew than the Blue and
Gold have put out in recent years, ex

elusive of the 1919 boat, but will have
their hands full when they meet the
Cardinal "babes."
Freshmen Have
Strong Crew
Captain Watts says that the Stan
ford freshmen have the strongest
crew that a first-year class has turned
out since he has been in college. The
final eight is a long way from being
picked, but Olmstead at stroke, Han
cock, McKinnon, and Snow are all
showing stuff that practically assures
them of places in the boat. Adams,
Sayre, Cornish, Maloney, Dunbar, and
Clark are working in the first shell
regularly. In the coxswain's position,
Bowcher appears to be the best bet,
but Valci has been used some of late.
The whole squad journeys to Red
wood every afternoon of the week, and
on Sunday mornings. Two weeks be-
Theta Xi house and Watts expects to
crew training table will start at the
Theta Xi house and aWtts expects to
have his men in fine shape for the
three-mile grind on the Oakland estu
ary. As has been the custom for the
past few years, the race will be held
the morning of the intercollegiate
track meet, May 3d, and the graduate
managers are making plans to take
care of the immense crowds that at
tend the races. Special trains will
follow the boats down the course, and
tugs will patrol the estuary to keep it
clear of traffic.
1919 Crew Is
Self Supporting
For the importance of the sport, the
amount of work that the participants
putin on it, and the interest that it
carries with it outside the University,
the crew has far too small a following
on the campus. Nearly all the students
go to the big event against the Uni
cally self supporting, as far as the
have little realization of the amount
of work that has been necessary for
the Cardinal oarsmen to do, to build
up a winning boat. Differing from past
years, the 1919 crew will be practi
concerned. With the money subscribed
management of the college finances is
concerned. With the mony subscribed
by the students last quarter, the funds
derived from the crew dance next Fri
day night at Encina, and half of the
proceeds of the lake carnical, it is
hoped that the crew will be able to
meet its expenses.
