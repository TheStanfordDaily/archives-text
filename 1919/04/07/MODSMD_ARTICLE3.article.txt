# Mme. Buffet and M. Ferrier Give French Concert
## 
### 
Pleasing and popular was the concert
given by Madame Buffet and Andre Fer
rier Friday night in the Assembly Hall.
The program, which was given entirely
in French, consisted of French songs
which have been papular with the sol
diers during the war. Madame Buffet
was well fitted to sing these since she
has been giving concerts for some time
in the trenches and hospitals.
Both Madame Buffet and Monsieur
Ferrier displayed talent and t ra i"i"g-
Their dramatic ability only added to the
interest of the program, for they acted
their songs as well as they sang them.
Monsieur Ferrier has been associated
with the Opera Comiquc of Paris, and
Madame Buffet has also had a great deal
of experience in the field of opera.
Madame Buffet will shortly leave for
tour.
