politics. Nationally the labor problem—
a part of the history of engineering—
is more the problem of the engineer
than of any other professional group.
If the engineer does not develop a sense
of social direction and economic growth,
one of his greatest opportunities will
have been lost.
There seems to be a wide gulf between
student affairs and the national affairs.
One is almost inclined to smile at the
presumption of linking the one with the
other. As a matter of fact, procrastina
tion is both the cause and the effect of
any difference there is between the two
No solution of any problem was orig
inally worked offhand. No worthy
thing is ever represented by anything
but experience and plain work. Ex
perience, by definition, begins at the
bottom every time.
Up to the Engineer to
Solve His Problems
It is the engineering major's duty to
solve his own difficulties—not mention
them to someone else. He must get
out his freshman year and "show some
thing." A little more each year there
after and finally he will be in a position
potentially equal to that of the student
lawyer. Then he can in fact solve his
own problems and, not stopping there,
even solve other people's problems for
them.
The thing to keep in mind is merely
that there is no such state as a monopoly
on management' and that the way to a
vantage point is not by narrowing down
I lie view but by broadening it out. Study
your mathematics and some economics
nn the side. Get out on the track and
run whether you arc young or old. Vote
whenever there is an election. Talk
about it. Have an opinion. Show some
initiative.
As one gentleman has said, "When
you get out of here, don't merely have
something to sell; be able to sell it."
