Up to the Engineer to
Solve His Problems
It is the engineering major's duty to
solve his own difficulties—not mention
them to someone else. He must get
out his freshman year and "show some
thing." A little more each year there
after and finally he will be in a position
potentially equal to that of the student
lawyer. Then he can in fact solve his
own problems and, not stopping there,
even solve other people's problems for
them.
The thing to keep in mind is merely
that there is no such state as a monopoly
on management' and that the way to a
vantage point is not by narrowing down
I lie view but by broadening it out. Study
your mathematics and some economics

run whether you arc young or old. Vote
whenever there is an election. Talk
about it. Have an opinion. Show some
initiative.
As one gentleman has said, "When
you get out of here, don't merely have
something to sell; be able to sell it."
There are two widely diverse types of
education. There is what may be called
cultural education on the one hand and
on the other, practical eductaion. This
to cither the one or the other variety.
Modern pedagogy ranges from the one
limit to the other and by the laws of
averages most often midway. It is only
when a definite effort is made that either
limit is approached. The engineering
school must of human necessity consider
only that culture with which it deals
directly.
Engineer Differs from Other
Professional Men
The same may be said of any other j
professional school such as the school
of medicine or of law.' Here, however,
we consider that the lawyer must asso
ciate- with all factions and all people;
his profession has existed so long that
law is by nature partially custom, par
tially precedent; somewhat legislation,
and somewhat technical opinion. If the
lawyer be perfect as such, he must know
all culture. This is not so with the
engineer. There can be no custom, 110
preccdtn, no legislation in engineering.
There is never any equity but always
natural law.
As this natural law becomes more
thoroughly appreciated and is set down
in books that arc wlways subject to
change, an engineering procedure grows
up about it. Hut the foundation is not
visibly as broad as the foundation of

law. Engineering is a younger pro
fession.
Hence the law major, we find, pos
sesses a wider field to choose from cul
tural education than the engineering
major. The engineer must limit himself
to mathematics, mechanics, and analyt
ical subjects. The lawyer includes these
and ;ill other cultural subjects—partialh
qualitative, partially quantitative. It is
therefore to be expected that the law'
major in the University is more apt to
lie interested "outsid of his hooks" than
the engineering major. Discussion,
sports, politics are an integral part of
the lawyer's sphere. The engineer's in
terest in them is not so evident. It is
accepted in the custom that has grown
up that the lawyer must interest him
self in politics and the engineer must
refuse to he bothered So it i>.

Up to the Engineer to
Solve His Problems
It is the engineering major's duty to
solve his own difficulties—not mention
them to someone else. He must get
out his freshman year and "show some
thing." A little more each year there
after and finally he will be in a position
potentially equal to that of the student
lawyer. Then he can in fact solve his
own problems and, not stopping there,
even solve other people's problems for
them.
The thing to keep in mind is merely
that there is no such state as a monopoly
on management' and that the way to a
vantage point is not by narrowing down
I lie view but by broadening it out. Study
your mathematics and some economics
nn the side. Get out on the track and
run whether you arc young or old. Vote
whenever there is an election. Talk
about it. Have an opinion. Show some
initiative.
As one gentleman has said, "When
you get out of here, don't merely have
something to sell; be able to sell it."
There are two widely diverse types of
education. There is what may be called
cultural education on the one hand and
on the other, practical eductaion. This
to cither the one or the other variety.
Modern pedagogy ranges from the one
limit to the other and by the laws of
averages most often midway. It is only
when a definite effort is made that either
limit is approached. The engineering
school must of human necessity consider
only that culture with which it deals
directly.
Engineer Differs from Other
Professional Men
The same may be said of any other j
professional school such as the school
of medicine or of law.' Here, however,
we consider that the lawyer must asso
ciate- with all factions and all people;
his profession has existed so long that
law is by nature partially custom, par
tially precedent; somewhat legislation,
and somewhat technical opinion. If the
lawyer be perfect as such, he must know
all culture. This is not so with the
engineer. There can be no custom, 110
preccdtn, no legislation in engineering.
There is never any equity but always
natural law.
As this natural law becomes more
thoroughly appreciated and is set down
in books that arc wlways subject to
change, an engineering procedure grows
up about it. Hut the foundation is not
visibly as broad as the foundation of

law. Engineering is a younger pro
fession.
Hence the law major, we find, pos
sesses a wider field to choose from cul
tural education than the engineering
major. The engineer must limit himself
to mathematics, mechanics, and analyt
ical subjects. The lawyer includes these
and ;ill other cultural subjects—partialh
qualitative, partially quantitative. It is
therefore to be expected that the law'
major in the University is more apt to
lie interested "outsid of his hooks" than
the engineering major. Discussion,
sports, politics are an integral part of
the lawyer's sphere. The engineer's in
terest in them is not so evident. It is
accepted in the custom that has grown
up that the lawyer must interest him
self in politics and the engineer must
refuse to he bothered So it i>.

The engineer must take the time to
broaden his own foundation. Intuition
tells us that natural law is the basis of
all law, and we know that natural law
is engineering. The engineer must enter
politics. Nationally the labor problem—
a part of the history of engineering—
is more the problem of the engineer
than of any other professional group.
If the engineer does not develop a sense
of social direction and economic growth,
one of his greatest opportunities will
have been lost.
