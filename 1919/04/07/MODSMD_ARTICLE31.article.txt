THE UNWRITTEN LAW
One of the first rules that a freshman
learns, is that no Stanford man smokes
on the 'Quad.' This became an un
written law when the university was in
its first stages of construction. Then
Mrs. Stanford expressed the wish, that,
as the university was to be a co-edu
cational intsitution, there should be no
smoking on the quadrangle or near the
recitation buildings.
Until the buildings were completed
there was 110 trouble. But smoking is
a part of the student's life that he never
entirely gives up, and gradually, between
classes, men would gather for a smoke
at the eastern entrance of the quad
rangle, not realizing that they were
breaking a sacred precedent. Dr. Jordan
saw this, and in December 1904, the fol
lowing order was issued:
"Until very recently the students of
the university have respected the un
written law against smoking in and
about the inner quadrangle. Recently
this has been disregarded at the ends
of the arcades and at different places.
I trust that the students will not make
it necessary to change that unwritten
law into a written one, but in any case
the university will not tolerate sticking
about the recitation bulidings, nor on
the steps leading to them.
Since then, except for an occasional
blunder by an uninformed freshman or
stranger, Stanford's unwritten law has
been strictly upheld.
UNCLE JOHN
Almost as famous as the "French
man" and probably better remembered
by most Stanford students, was "Uncle
John."
Uncle John came here in the tirst
days of the university and for many
years before the street cars, drove a
bus from Palo Alto to the campus. He
liked to talk, and especially about Stan
ford Occasionally he said something
true, but this was seldom. His explana
tions of the university, buildings and
college traditions to .the tourists he
drove about, were unexpected and al
ways entretaining.
Tiic story is told that, when Dr.
Blodgett, the famous musician and, for
many years - organist at Stanford, ar
rived, lie was driven out to pay his first

call on Mrs. Stanford, by Uncle John.
They did not find her at home. "Never
mind," said Uncle John, "I'll find her."
And soon Mrs. Stanford's carriage was
seen. Then said Uncle John, with a
flurish of the whip, "There is Jane
now."
The old man had no idea of figures,
and the costs of the various buildings
always ran into the millions. He al
ways emphasized the democratic spirit
at Stanford. "Twenty girls live to
gether in one house," lie would say
when driving up the "Row"; "and the
boys, all millionaires' sons, why any day
you can see them mowing their own
lawns."
t Uncle John's lectures became very
famous and tourists from tbe east would
seek him out as their conductor about
Stanford. He was very benign in ap
pearance with a full white beard and
mild blue eyes. He was seldom reparat
ed from his two-seated carriage and a
pair of sleepy horses he drove. All his
conversations were punctuated at reg
ular intervals by loud "gidaps."
