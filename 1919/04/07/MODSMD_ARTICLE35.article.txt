# STANFORD JOURNALISM WINS BACK PRE-WAR CONDITIONS
## PETREE AGAIN ON DAILY Press Club, Sigma Delta Chi, Revived With Return of Men in Service 
### 
With the return of men to college this
quarter, Stanford ha sstarted back to
her former journalism standards. Frank-
Taylor, J larry Frantz, "Bob" Donaldson,
Lance Warren, "Skin" Auperle and
Carl Randau have set a record both in
and out of college that is difficult to
i ival, but enough old men are returning,
and enough have been developed on
the campus to considerably brighten the
journalism situation.
eFaturcs of last quarter in journal
ism were the reorganization of Press
Club, long the important society of jour
nalists on the campus, and Sigma Delta
Chi, the national journalistic fraternity.
Four men were elected to Press Club
and three to Sigma Delta Chi.
I his quarter the return of Niel Petree,
a former Daily Palo Alto man, to the
campus gave a big boost to journalism.
Of importance this quarter is the
broadening of the scope of the Daily
Palo Alto to somewhat take the place
of the former Illustrated Review for the
expression of student thought. Eight
pages will be put out each Monday, and
four o fthese will be devote dto articles
of general interest.
