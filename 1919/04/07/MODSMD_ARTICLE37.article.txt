# Dramatic Reviewer Contributes Article On Campus Criticism
## 
### R.W. Kinny, '21 
Why campus dramatics, musicals, and
candy pulls should be immune from
criticism is one of Stanford's inscruti
hle mysteries. Amateur effort seems to
Ik- sacred, far above the profane touch
of the benighted one who ventures to
suggest that it might have been better.
Any one with a complete vocabulary of
phrases, "excellent voice," "splendid cos
tuming," and "clever lyrics." can pose
as a campus dramatic critic and get by
with no end of credit, especially from the
cast.
The people who get out for amateur
theatricals admittedly work hard. This
year's work, as shown in the Ram's
Head extravaganza and the Sophomore
Play, was especially meritorious. The
acting was smooth, the general staging
away above par. The result of much
hard work was very clearly shown.
Criticisms Disapproved
Because Unfavorable
Without dealing with the merits of
the criticisms that appear in the Daily
Palo Alto, the fact remains that they
met with disapproval principally because
in many instances they were unfavorable
to certain ones of the cast, not because
they praised any one overmuch. There
are two kinds of criticism. One relies
on candor and the impressions of the
individual critic. The other serves as
a bouquet and a reward to the hard
working east. The conventions of this
latter kind of criticism demand that the
poor reviewer perjure his undying soul
and say that the French maid, who ap
pears once and then to mumble inco
herently something about dinner being
served, was excellent in her character
part, and adorable in her costume.
Campus dramatics are far above the
average an dit should be that they could
stand the pittiless glare of mediocre
but real amateur criticism. The review
might be poor and unjust, but at least
it is tending in the directing of better
campus theatricals.
Many Improvements
In Setting Possible
As for setting, with the modern
genre of scenery which features siin
plicitv. it should he an inexpensive mat
ter to get much better effects than many
of the atrocities that are wished on the
audiences at present. A plain grey drop
for a batchelor's hall bedroom would be
just a> easy to conceive as the morgue
effect anteroom that was used in the
second act of "Hunker Mean."
This article is not an attempt to re
hash any old criticism. Rather the much
scarred critic is trying to inform an un
interested public as to what he i-- trying
to do and in what spirit any further
criticisms should be received
