"Washington's freshmen class will
subscribe $60(), if Stanford's freshman
class will subscribe $100, in order to
send a Washington freshman crew to
compete in the annual bay regatta." This
was the substance of the telegram re
ceived last night by Student-Manager
Ames from Washington University. It
was immediately turned over to the
president of the freshman class and, in
a hurried meeting of the executive coun
cil this noon, it was decided to appro
priate the hundred dollars. Because of
the success of the freshman jollyup on
Saturday night, the class treasury will
be able to stand the appropriation with
very little trouble.
