# DOUBLE STANDARD AT STANFORD CONDEMNED
## Attention Called to Difference Between Men's and Women's Rules 
### 
It is generally admitted that the mind
of youth comes to college to be molded
by at least some of the good principles
laid forth. At Stanford and, unfortun
nately, at a good many other universities
one of the first principle's to be imbibed
is that of a double standard for college
men and women. The new student's
attention is soon attracted to the multi
tude of rules governing the conduct of
college women and to the few govern
ing the conduct of college men.
The children brought up in a family
which will ultimately send them to col
lege are usually taught that whether
boy or girl commits some small sin, it is
equally unlawful and equally punishable.
Early school training as a rule, bring 9
out the same point. Roys and girls are
disciplined alike for their wrongs. High
schools cannot he said to be more len
ient with one sex than with the other.
Having received home and school
training which leave him or her with a
sense of the equality of the sexes ,as far
as the moral quality of conduct goes, the
average student feels that there is in
justice somewhere when he sees the
different standards for men and for
women which have been created at Stan
ford ; after which the average student
takes a resentful attitude toward the
authorities responsible for the rules or
he gradually allows himself to drift to
ward t he acceptance of the double
standard.
Yet the very same authorities who up
hold different moral standards for col
lege men and women probably would
say that they did not believe in the
double standard if they were asked to
express an opinion on the subject. It

is safe ta state that the majority of
the Stanford faculty members feel that
the acts of men and women are good or
had according to one and the same
principle. Nevertheless, each year this
body is responsible for the placing of a
few more restrictions on college women,
thus constantly making the difference
broader.
If the single standard for conduct is
one of the good principles, which it is
now generally conceded to be, would it
not be a commendable thing for Stan
ford to inaugurate this principle? As a
democratic and as a progressive institu
tion, it could send men and women from
the University with a secure sense of
their equality, if such a principle were
demonstrated in practical life as well as
taught in its courses in education, psy
chology—nowhere better than Stanford,
cither, for the proo fthat one of its own
theories of democracy will work!
