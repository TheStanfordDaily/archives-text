# STUDENT CONTROL DATA PRESENTED TO STUDENTS
## 
### Walter I. Ames, '18 
Questionaires on student control have
been prepared by the Committee on
Student Control, and are officially pre
sented to the student sof the University
through the medium of the Daily Palo
Alto. This evening, according to the
plans laid by the committee at its meet
ing Sunday night, twenty men from as
many fraternities will take up the sub
jec to utfsdent control in the fraternity
houses up the liow. Men in every house
will be requeste dto fill out the ques
tionaires and turn them in to the heads
of the houses. Encina men will be pro
vided with a box wherein to deposit the
answered questions.
The questionaire ss planned by the
committee is not simply an effort to
obtain interesting answers. It is an ef
fort to test the interest of the men of
the University in the whole question of
student control; t is an effort to deter
mine whether or not the men in the
University really are awake in the solu

tion of the student control problem If
the test is successful, the possibility of
student control looms stronger than ever
before.
•Yes" and "No" Answers Are
Not Desired
The questions that the committee de
sire sansvvered arc so framed that "yes"
and "no" answers are not of the type
conducive to obtaining the best results.
Yes or no is not an indication of inter
est in the subject. And then when it
is considered that some helpful informa
tion is after desired from the question
aires, it is clear that "yes" and "no"
answers will not suit th epurpose.
There are five questions asked by the
committee. The first of these is the
simple, direct question: "Do you favor
student control for men?" This is prob
ably the only question where yes or
no will suffice as an answer. The second
question, "Do you think stludent con
trol would be a success?" implies a rea-
son as wcl las a simple assertion for an
answer. It is in this question as prob
ably in no other asked that the whole
future of student control really rests. If
opinion is that control would not be a
success, there is then an insurmountable
obstacle to student control.
"Why Did Old System Fail?"
Is Asked.
"Why did the old system fail?" is
asked for a purpose as the third ques
tion. It will test how great the inter
est in the old form of control really
was, why it failed, and thus what is to
be avoided in the future form of stu
dent control. Naturally this question
will present less obstacles for upper
classmen to answer than for lower
classmen.
"What method of choosing men for
a disciplinary body would you favor?"
puts an issue clearly up to the person
responding. It is a clear test of any
' plan an individual may have evolved. It
will further test whether individuals
have been sufficiently interested to evolve
any particular plan.
"Should cases of discipline eb tried
publicly or in secret." is more specific
than the other questions but presents a
phase of student control that is bound
to appear, no matter what system of
control may ultimately be adopted.
The questions, if properly answered,
will not be hastily answered. There
will be some thought behind each and
every response It is this thought that
is desired. A thinking student body is
the first essential to student control. It
is the first necessity towards obtaining
student conrol and the greatest need in
retaining it.

no will suffice as an answer. The second
question, "Do you think stludent con
trol would be a success?" implies a rea-
son as wcl las a simple assertion for an
answer. It is in this question as prob
ably in no other asked that the whole
future of student control really rests. If
opinion is that control would not be a
success, there is then an insurmountable
obstacle to student control.
"Why Did Old System Fail?"
Is Asked.
"Why did the old system fail?" is
asked for a purpose as the third ques
tion. It will test how great the inter
est in the old form of control really
was, why it failed, and thus what is to
be avoided in the future form of stu
dent control. Naturally this question
will present less obstacles for upper
classmen to answer than for lower
classmen.
"What method of choosing men for
a disciplinary body would you favor?"
puts an issue clearly up to the person
responding. It is a clear test of any
' plan an individual may have evolved. It
will further test whether individuals
have been sufficiently interested to evolve
any particular plan.
"Should cases of discipline eb tried
publicly or in secret." is more specific
than the other questions but presents a
phase of student control that is bound
to appear, no matter what system of
control may ultimately be adopted.
The questions, if properly answered,
will not be hastily answered. There
will be some thought behind each and
every response It is this thought that
is desired. A thinking student body is
the first essential to student control. It
is the first necessity towards obtaining
student conrol and the greatest need in
retaining it.
Questionaires on student control have
been prepared by the Committee on
Student Control, and are officially pre
sented to the student sof the University
through the medium of the Daily Palo
Alto. This evening, according to the
plans laid by the committee at its meet
ing Sunday night, twenty men from as
many fraternities will take up the sub
jec to utfsdent control in the fraternity
houses up the liow. Men in every house
will be requeste dto fill out the ques
tionaires and turn them in to the heads
of the houses. Encina men will be pro
vided with a box wherein to deposit the
answered questions.
The questionaire ss planned by the
committee is not simply an effort to
obtain interesting answers. It is an ef
fort to test the interest of the men of
the University in the whole question of
student control; t is an effort to deter
mine whether or not the men in the
University really are awake in the solu

tion of the student control problem If
the test is successful, the possibility of
student control looms stronger than ever
before.
•Yes" and "No" Answers Are
Not Desired
The questions that the committee de
sire sansvvered arc so framed that "yes"
and "no" answers are not of the type
conducive to obtaining the best results.
Yes or no is not an indication of inter
est in the subject. And then when it
is considered that some helpful informa
tion is after desired from the question
aires, it is clear that "yes" and "no"
answers will not suit th epurpose.
There are five questions asked by the
committee. The first of these is the
simple, direct question: "Do you favor
student control for men?" This is prob
ably the only question where yes or
no will suffice as an answer. The second
question, "Do you think stludent con
trol would be a success?" implies a rea-
son as wcl las a simple assertion for an
answer. It is in this question as prob
ably in no other asked that the whole
