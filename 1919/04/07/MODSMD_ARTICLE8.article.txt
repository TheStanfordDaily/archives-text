# San Jose Beats 1922 Ball Tossers
## 
### 
Still pursued by their jinx, the fresh
man baseball team dropped another
game, this time to the San Jose high
school, to the tune of 7 to 5. It looked
for a while as if the jinx was taking a
Saturday vacation, for until the seventh
inning tlit' high school boys only secured
three hits off of Shamberger who pitch
ed the whole game.
In the unlucky seventh. Spires drop
ped a pop-fly when two men were out
and the bases empty. Until the end
of the inning the San Jose players tired
themselves running bases, and when the
dust had cleared away four runs on
five hits were securely tucked away.
Saturday's game showed that the babes
could hit if they were made to. Cap

tain Hawkes was lite hitting star of the
game, getting three singles out of four
tries. .Holmes hit the ball hard for a
a percentage of .500. Gomez brought
in two runs without making a hit.
Outside the seventh Shamberger
pitched one of the best games of the
season and allowed but four hits. He
struck out several men and made two
hits in four times at bat.
On Wednesday the babes go up
against Mountain View in preparation
for the California game on Saturday.
The team lined up: Stevenson, cf;
Sibley, cf ; Rousselot, ss and 3d; Spires,
r 112: Holmes, If; Gomes, 2d; Wallace
3d; Davies, ss; Holsten, c; Hawkes,
Ist; Shamberger, p.
