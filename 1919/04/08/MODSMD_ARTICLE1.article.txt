# DEBATERS WILL TRY OUT IN LITTLE THEATER TOMORROW
## TEAM WILL BE CHOSEN TO MEET U.S.C. Men to Combat in Friday's Forensic War Will Be Picked Wednesday 
### 
I ryouts for the debating team which
it to meet the University of Southern
California begin promptly at 1:15 to
morrow afternoon. Coach McClintock
states that all men who are able to do
so should appear at the Little Theatre
at this time, when he will arrange for
the competition to be rnn in units of six
men each.
froyoutees who cannot come at 1:15
can appear at 3 o'clock, or even later.
However, McClintock urges that all
speakers report as soon as possible in
order to lessen complications, and in
order to aid in effecting a better speak
ing arrangement. All speakers must
report as some time Thursday, for if
necessary to run the competition through
two days, the debate for Friday will be
arranged between those men who
demonstrate the best ability tomorrow.
In case of a particularly large number
of new men try for the squad Friday,
the judges will arrange for the best
of these to meet those who have previ
ously participated in intercollegiate de
bates on the following day.
The question io be discussed tomorrow
is, "Resolved, That the Federal Govern
ment should provide employment for
surplus labor." A main speech of seven
minutes and a rebuttal of three minutes
will be made by each contestant.
McClintock states that he expects to
choose the team rather than the squad
tomorrow, that is, the judges will choose
the men who are definitely to take part
in the intercollegiate contest, instead of
choosing a squad of six for further
competition for first places. probably
one alternate will lie selected.
The contest with the University of
Southern California is always a very
keen one, and this year the trio from
Los Angeles is particularly strong. The
debating authorities here are for this
reason very anxious that a large num
ber report for the tryouts Thursday, and
the few experienced men in the universi
ty in particular are urged to come out.
