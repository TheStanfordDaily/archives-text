# JUNIOR CLASS WILL MEET THIS WEEK
## 
### 
A meeting of the Junior Class has
been decided upon for the last of this
week. The purpose of the meeting will
he to arouse spirit and to assure the
success of the coming Junior Prom.
I Mans as announced by the Prom com
mittee today call for, by far, the most
elaborate decorations and preparations
that have ever been worked out at any
of these annual dances. To carry out
this program successfully the committee
announces that it must have the sup

port and co-operation of the entire
Junior Class.
Almost every large class dance given
at Stanford runs behind in the expense
account. This year's committee an
nounces that they do not intend to run
behind in spite of tlie enlarged scope
and preparations planned for the Junior
Prom. But, they urge, this can only
be done by the co-operation of every
member of the 1920 class, and it is for
this reason that a meeting is to be
called. Ihe time and place of meeting
will be announced tomorrow.
