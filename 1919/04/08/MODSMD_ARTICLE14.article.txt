llTiiiii to merciless denunciation of brains vastly more developed than
■ |—j his own. This condition is unfortunate, to say the least, but is
probably mainly the result of the college student's apathy in regard
to affairs in general. College existence is to a college student in the nature of a
shell into which he closes himself and in which he believes himself immune from
the discussions and problems of the world in general. It is this attitude towards
college existence that exposes the newly labeled college graduate to the accusa
*•"— K„;.,or impractical and inefficient until he has forgotten a little of his
more specific. We at Stanford concern ourselves with affairs of
even neglect, for instance, the affairs that go on about us in the
Palo Alto. We are not citizens legally of that city, and we neglect
to interest ourselves in what transpires in a community even as closely connected
with the University as this city it> itself.
We seem to forget that Palo Alto means Stanford to many oitfsiders, and
what transpires in Palo Alto of a beneficial or detrimental nature casts a ccrtain
amount of praise or disfavor upon the University. We cannot help this, since
geographically Palo Alto and Stanford are close together and must ever remain so.
In the Palo Alto vice crusade of recent date there was not a word of protest
from any organ of the University, either because of a delicacy in handling a
dangerous subject, or because of an utter lack of interest. In the matter of the
Palo Alto car system, inefficient and inadequate as this is, there is seldom more
than a whispered rutnor of discontent. And in this latter there is a real problem
of a practical nature. Twenty-minute service, and a rather irregular twenty
minute service at that, is not conducive to catching trains or eight o'clock classes;
it might help the taxi people, but it does not help the University; it is therefore
a problem of a semi-outside nature for the students of the University.
In the meeting of some problems of this sort, the University student might
possibly break through the shell of isolation that he has built around himself and
might eventually work up to the position of becoming a useful citizen immediately
upon graduation rather than five years after graduation.
