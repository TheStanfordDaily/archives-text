# Sweeping Reforms Urged on Campus
## 
### 
Spring has arrived. No more does
the moon hide its pale face behind a
dark cloud, but shines forth in a way
that invites one to wander beneath its
soft radiance. So out of a deep interest
for the "have-beens," the "are nows"
and the "may bee's" we are prompted
to speak of reform. Once, and once
only do we pass through this toilsome
world. Alas ! Therefore we are tempted
to suggest the reform. Did it ever occur
to you that the Cactus Garden is entirely
devoid of benches? Surely it was never
intended to be thus! Particularly now
that Spring is in our midst do we feel
the glaring need. So in the spirit of
kindness we have resolved to start a
public subscription to supply the defici
ency. Hand your contributions to any
member of the D. P. A. staff. No more
than $5 will be accepted from each per
son. On to victory!
