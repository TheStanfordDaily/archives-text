# U.C. PROFESSOR WILL SPEAK HERE TONIGHT
## Carnoy Will Lecture on Social Conditions in Belgiam 
### 
Tonight, in the Little Theatre, Pro
! fessor A. J. Carnoy of the University
.
|of California, will give a lecture on
social conditions in Belgium. The lec
ture will give a vivid representation of
conditions in Belgium at the outbreak
of the war and previous. Those who
have heard the speaker, say that his
talk makes it possible to realize for the
first time just how the heroic Belgians
were able to stand so unified against a
common invader.
Professor Carnoy remained in Bel
gium until his home fell before the
German hordes. At the invasion of
Louvain he fled to America, and the
University of California soon after se
cured his services as professor of
Romanic Languages.
The talk tonight is an unusual oppor
tunity to hear of Belgian social con
ditions. first hand, from a native of
Belgium, and particularly as Professor
Carnoy is said to be an expert in this
field, having devoted much of his life
in studying and in endeavoring to im
prove social conditions of his people.
Tonight's lecture will begin at 7:30
and will be given in the Little Theatre
unless the attendance warrants holding
it in Assembly Hall. By holding the
Tuesday evening lectures at 7:30, the
authorities thus plan to make it pos
sible for all Stanford students to at
tend, and yet not seriously interfere
with their university work. A wide
variety of splendid numbers will be of
fered this quarter and those who have
jseen the list of speakers to appear here
promise that the time will be well spent
in regular attendance at these meetings.
