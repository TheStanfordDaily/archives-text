# PROSPECTS IN TENNIS BRIGHTEN SLIGHTLY
## ”Art” Devlin Is Defeated by Fish, '21, in Varsity Tournament 
### 
The good weather of the past two
weeks has been taken advantage of by
the men on the tennis squad to round
out their game. Among the players
showing improvement over their early
season work is Lounsberry Fish '21, who
defeated Devlin in the second round of
the Varsity Tournament, by the score
of 6-1; 6-4. Fish is especially strong
in service, and is a consistent volleyer,
making inpossible "gets" in this match.
He covers a great deal of ground and
gits to the net at every opportunity
and once there, it is very difficult to
pass him.
Kinney showed Well in his match
with Crosby, in the first round, defeat
ing the latter, 6-1 ; 6-3.
Crosby is a bard worker and should
with practice develop into a formidable
contestant for the team. Kinney's ser
vice worked well in this match, and
he, like Fish, plays a strong game at
the net.
Allen Barber, though unable to play
in the tournament, has been out on the
courts consistently and is showing the
effects of practice by bis steadiness and
judgment of distance in driving and
volleying.
"Skee" Turner, Wylie Dent and Dev
lin have been working-out daily. Turner
is showing a pretty game. His playing
against Eliot Mac Swain in the match
with Sacramento, where he was pitted
against an experienced veteran who
stands among the best in the State,
left little to be desired.
Captain Devlin has been trying out
various double combinations. Barber
and Turner work well together, and
after winning the inter-fraternity doub
les with a handicap of over 30, they
made a creditable showing aganist
Griffin and Detrick of the Olympic
Club, forcing them to deuce sets.
Kinney and Devlin worked together
against the Olympic Club, and though
there is much room for improvement,
they showed well.
Bent and Fish have not as yet played
together in a tournament, but the way
they are cleaning up their opponents in
practice shows that they are a combina
tion hard to beat. »
Hubard. Rimpau. Thomas, J. N'eer,
Nathan, Whitemore and Corderlev, are
all showing up well.
Jimmy Davies, of the Frosh Squad,
won the special singles at Coronado
during the spring vacation.
Phil Neer, Hawks, Tussing and Con
rad have been showing well for the
Freshmen. Their match with California
comes on Saturday, April 26, and is to
be played on the Stanford courts.
