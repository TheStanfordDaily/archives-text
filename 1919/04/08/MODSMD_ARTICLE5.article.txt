# JUNIOR PROM PLANS ANNOUNCED
## 
### 
Evidently the coming of Spring put
new life into the already peppy Junior
Prom, for at a meeting held last night,
the committee reported several new feat
ures that will do much to make this
year's Junior Prom distinctive from all
previous ones.
I In- date previously set for the Prom
is the 9th of May. By this time loads
of flowers and greens can be secured
for decorative purposes. The committee
refused to divulge the decorative plan.
I>ut did state that it was to be so elabor
ate that a fleet of motor trucks had been
engaged to haul greens, potted plants
and ferns for the occasion. A hint was
also given that something entirely novel
in the way of opportunities to enjoy the
moonlight would be on the program.
A nine-piece orchestra from San Fran
cisco was definitely engaged last night.
The pieces will consist of a piano,
drums, three saxaphoncs, two banjos, a
violin and trombone. This orchestra has
played together for live years and is
said to be /inc of the best in the City
of San Francisco.
Onesteps will be the favorite at the
Prom; nine out of sixteen dances being
one-steps, and live foxtrots, while two
waltzes will be thrown in.in the way of
variation. It was felt that by having

but sixteen dances, longer dances could
be given, and better results would be
obtained than by having eighteen dances
of shorter length. The intermission will
come between the ninth and tenth dances.
hats for the occasion, the committee
states, will likewise be imported from
San I' rancisco. What they will consist
of yet remains a mystery.
Programs for the dance have been
designed in the East. They will be all
leather with twelve pages, also of leath
er. The cover will be of light blue with
a special silver design. It will be lined
with blue silk and the insert pages will
be of thin white sheepskin.
<)n the night chosen for the Prom
many outside attractions have been an
nounced, but the committee plans to do
everything possible to make this dance
prove strong enough to invite attend
ance despite the counter attractions.
One hundred and fifty tickets will be
sold. In order to come out even, the
committee announces that every ticket
must be sold, but as expenses will just
be cleared by the one hundred and fifty
couples, no more tickets will be obtain
able after these run out. Programs will
be obtainable one week before the event,
and tickets will be on sale about the end
of next week
