# FRATERNITY COUNCIL ACCEPTS PROPOSED CONSTITUTION
## EACH HOUSE TO BE GIVEN PRINTED COPIES Deferred Pledging and Initiation Rules Are Adopted 
### 
At a meeting of the interfraternity
council last night it was voted to accept
the constitution as drawn up and pre
sented by the committee recently ap
pointed to work it out. The committee
further voted to provide that lineograph
copies of this constitution shall be drawn
up and copies furnished for each house.
Several new and important features
were embodied in this constitution as
finally adopted by the fraternity repre
sentatives. Among them was the policy
of deferred pledging, and deferred
initiation. No man can now be pledged
his first quarter in the university and
not at all unti lhe has secured at least
a C average. No man can be initiated
until he lias been at the university for
two quarters. The constitution also
embodies a clause prohibiting gambling,
obscene language, etc., in the fraternity
houses.
In order to enforce this constitution
when it is finally adopted by each fra
ternity, several penalties have been
adopted. Any offense of a fraternity
may be published either hi the Frosh
Bible, or the D. P. A., for five con
secutive issues. Further penalties would
be the prevention of the initiation of
men wrongfully pledged, the prevention
of men wrongfully initiated from liv
ing in the fraternity house and finally
prohibiting any man in a house delib
erately violating any rule, from particip
ating in any student body activity.
The lithographed copies of the con
stitution will be presented to each house
the last of this week. The house fra
ternity as a whole will then vote on the
proposition, when another meeting of
the committee will be called.
