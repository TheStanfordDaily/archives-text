es are expected to enter a good nnany
candidates. .
Upperclasses Strongest
This meet will be of especial import
ance to Freshmen track men as their
showing in the interclass will decide
definitely whether they will meet Cali
fornia in the intercollegiate Freshman
contest. If their showing is satis
factory, a freshman captain will be
elected after the meet.
Many former track men who have
returned to college will compete for the
first time in this meet. Several of these
men promise, to furnish some strong
competition for those who have been
here all season. Kinney, Wright and
H. R. Hurtel in the 440-yard dash;
"Milt" Samis in the two-mile; Charlie
Carlisle in the mile; "Dink" Templefon
in the jumps, and George Lynn in the
bro?d jump and hurdles will all aid
to the keeness of the competition.
The upperclassmen will probably be
able to put out the strongest teams, as
they have most of the experienced men
in their ranks. The seniors will be
especially strong if the holdovers arc
added to their team. The sophomore
team should not be very far behind.
Wright, Green, Scofield, and Carlsmith
will form a nucleus for a strong com
bination.
The outlook for the freshmen is not
so bright, but they have a few good
men who should be able to come in for
ijoints.
No announcement has yet made
regarding the winning of class numer
als in this meet, but it is understood that
the classes may grant numeral sweaters
as usual to those who place in the meet.
