# Tickets on Sale For Crew Dance At Encina Hall
## 
### 
1 ickcts for the Crew Dance went on
sale at all fraternity houses and in the
Hall yesterday. The purpose of the
dance is to raise sufficient money to
enable the crew to maintain a training
table in the Theta Xi house for at least
two weeks prior to the big regatta. The
crew is self-supporting this year, and
so far, the student support in the way
of contributions to the crew campaign
last quarter has been excellent, and the
new demand for funds will, no doubt,
be met in a satisfactory manner.
Captain Frank Watts, and "Les"
Rogers are in charge of the arrange
ments for the dance, and Wade Stamp,
at Encina, is expending 110 little effort
on having the floor in shape for Fri
day night. This will be the first dance
to be held at Encina since the new
floor has been laid, and both the hall
and the lobby will be used for dancing.
The big fireplace at the end of the hall
will be opened for the first time in
years. Three orchestras will play for
the dance, each playing a third of the
evening. These orchestras are the best
that can be secured in the way of jazz
music. The decorations will be origin
al, as will be also the refreshments.
The committee on the crew fund is
urging that everyone, who possibly can
attend the dance, do so. as the funds
are badly needed. The entire proceeds
will be for the crew fund. The price
of admission is to be one dollar.
