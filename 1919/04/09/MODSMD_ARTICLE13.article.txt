# CARDINAL 1922 NINE TO MEET U.C. BABES SATURDAY AFTERNOON
## COACH CASS CONFIDENT First Game of the Freshman Baseball Series at Stanford 
### E.E. Crowe, '21 
ON Saturdpv afternoon the first
game of the California-Stanf6rd
freshman baseball series will be
played on the Stanford lot. Coach
Cass has gathered a strong club of
1922 men together and is confident
that his team will beat the cubs from
Berkeley in the opener.
Although it is uncertain as to the
man who will start the game for the
Stanford freshmen in the box, the re
mainder of the team will line up as
follows: Stevenson, cf.; Wallace, 3b;
Spires, rf.; Holmes, If.; Gomez, 2b;
Rousselot, ss.; Holston, c.; Hawkes,
lb; Shamburger, Sibley, and Neer, p.
The Cardinal freshmen have a good
average club without any stars. The
pitchers are inexperienced, but seem
to have a good deal of stuff on the
ball. The club has been hitting the
ball on the nose for the last two or
three games, and if they keep up the
present gait they will give the Cali
fornia freshmen a good race for the
hitting honors. Holmes in left field is
probably the best man with the war
