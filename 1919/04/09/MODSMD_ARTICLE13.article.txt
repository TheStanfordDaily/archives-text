### E.E. Crowe, '21 
ON Saturdpv afternoon the first
game of the California-Stanf6rd
freshman baseball series will be
played on the Stanford lot. Coach
Cass has gathered a strong club of
1922 men together and is confident
that his team will beat the cubs from
Berkeley in the opener.
Although it is uncertain as to the
man who will start the game for the
Stanford freshmen in the box, the re
mainder of the team will line up as
follows: Stevenson, cf.; Wallace, 3b;
Spires, rf.; Holmes, If.; Gomez, 2b;
Rousselot, ss.; Holston, c.; Hawkes,
lb; Shamburger, Sibley, and Neer, p.
The Cardinal freshmen have a good
average club without any stars. The
pitchers are inexperienced, but seem
to have a good deal of stuff on the
ball. The club has been hitting the
ball on the nose for the last two or
three games, and if they keep up the
present gait they will give the Cali
fornia freshmen a good race for the
hitting honors. Holmes in left field is
probably the best man with the war
club, with Spires and Holston press
ing him for honors. The freshmen
annexed eight hits in their game Sat
urday with tho San Jose High School
team and every man on the team at
least hit the ball.
Stevenson, center fielder and lead
off man, is the fastest man on the
club. He runs bakes well and is able
to use his head when he gets on. Wal
lace is playing third and hitting sec
ond in the batting order. He is an
experienced player, has a good arm
and is hitting well. Spires works in
right field and hits third in the bat
ting order. He is a reliable hitter,
and has an average of at least one
hit a game. Gomez is hitting fifth and
holding down second base. He has the
record of making the most runs and
has the ability to look the pitcher's
offerings over before hitting. Rous
selot at shortstop is an uncertain hit
ter, but is fielding his position well.
Holston is one of the best players on
the club and is equally good behind
the bat and with the stick. Hawkes
plays a reliable game on first base and
his hitting has been improving in the
last two games played. He is the
skipper for the freshmen.
Shamburger, Neer, and Sibley are
the twirlers who will probably work
in the series. Coach Cass has not de
cided on the man who will start the
game Saturday. His choice will de
pend on the showing they make to
night against the Palo Alto High
School team. Neer has a good fast
bull and a sharp hook, but is new at
the pitching game. Shamburger has
a good underhand ball and is able to
get liis fast one over also. Sibley
tosses from the port side and has had
more experience than the other two.
There are no fielding stars in the
infield. The combination of Hawkes,
Gomez, Kousselot, and Wallace works
:• uoothly and should be able to hold
down the California babes. The out
field is strong with Stevenson. Holmes,
and Spires covering the clover
patches.
Davies, McCollough, and Connolly
will be held in reserve by Coach Cass.
They may break in the game as pinch
hitters or start in the line-up for the
second game on the 19th. which will
be played at Berkeley.

ing him for honors. The freshmen
annexed eight hits in their game Sat
urday with tho San Jose High School
team and every man on the team at
least hit the ball.
Stevenson, center fielder and lead
off man, is the fastest man on the
club. He runs bakes well and is able
to use his head when he gets on. Wal
lace is playing third and hitting sec
ond in the batting order. He is an
experienced player, has a good arm
and is hitting well. Spires works in
right field and hits third in the bat
ting order. He is a reliable hitter,
and has an average of at least one
hit a game. Gomez is hitting fifth and
holding down second base. He has the
record of making the most runs and
has the ability to look the pitcher's
offerings over before hitting. Rous
selot at shortstop is an uncertain hit
ter, but is fielding his position well.
Holston is one of the best players on
the club and is equally good behind
the bat and with the stick. Hawkes
plays a reliable game on first base and
his hitting has been improving in the
last two games played. He is the
skipper for the freshmen.
Shamburger, Neer, and Sibley are
the twirlers who will probably work
in the series. Coach Cass has not de
cided on the man who will start the
game Saturday. His choice will de
pend on the showing they make to
night against the Palo Alto High
School team. Neer has a good fast
bull and a sharp hook, but is new at
the pitching game. Shamburger has
a good underhand ball and is able to
get liis fast one over also. Sibley
tosses from the port side and has had
more experience than the other two.
There are no fielding stars in the
infield. The combination of Hawkes,
Gomez, Kousselot, and Wallace works
:• uoothly and should be able to hold
down the California babes. The out
field is strong with Stevenson. Holmes,
and Spires covering the clover
patches.
Davies, McCollough, and Connolly
will be held in reserve by Coach Cass.
They may break in the game as pinch
hitters or start in the line-up for the
second game on the 19th. which will
be played at Berkeley.
ON Saturdpv afternoon the first
game of the California-Stanf6rd
freshman baseball series will be
played on the Stanford lot. Coach
Cass has gathered a strong club of
1922 men together and is confident
that his team will beat the cubs from
Berkeley in the opener.
Although it is uncertain as to the
man who will start the game for the
Stanford freshmen in the box, the re
mainder of the team will line up as
follows: Stevenson, cf.; Wallace, 3b;
Spires, rf.; Holmes, If.; Gomez, 2b;
Rousselot, ss.; Holston, c.; Hawkes,
lb; Shamburger, Sibley, and Neer, p.
The Cardinal freshmen have a good
average club without any stars. The
pitchers are inexperienced, but seem
to have a good deal of stuff on the
ball. The club has been hitting the
ball on the nose for the last two or
three games, and if they keep up the
present gait they will give the Cali
fornia freshmen a good race for the
hitting honors. Holmes in left field is
probably the best man with the war
club, with Spires and Holston press
ing him for honors. The freshmen
