# KEEP OFF THE GRASS
## 
### 
l ' K AJ a 'ly appears today with the statement, "Keep
the Grass," there will very probably be those who
will seek some hidden or subtle meaning in the edi
torial statement. Disappointing as it may be to some, there is no
subtle allusion to anything but the straight facts, "keep off the grass"
In asking students of the University to be more sacred in their observance of
the green spots about the University, we seek merely to see the student display
the same care and appropriate regard for the surroundings of the University as
they would display towards anything sacred in their homes.
The decent appearance of the University is essential from all standpoints. It is
necessary that this appearance be such as to meet with the favorable approval of
visitors to the University as well as students of the University.
The grass in front of the Quad and near the Chemistry building seems to be a
common walking grounds of the student. It is difficult enough to keep this grass
in good and presentable shape without the retardation of careless students. Let us
not discourage the care of the groundkeepers by trampling on his weeds and pet
grass. Let us not carelessly overlook an opportunity to improve the appearance
of Stanford.
