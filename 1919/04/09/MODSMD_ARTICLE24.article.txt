### C.E.R., '19 
Green was the most consistent, win
ner for the Cardinal in Friday's meet
with U. S. C. His mark of 12 l'eet G
inches in the pole vault is within three
inches of the Stanford-California rec
ord and looks like sure points against
California. His mark of 119 feet in
the discus and G:1 in the high jump
surpass the marks of 117 feet and 5:8
which took firsts in the same events
at the U. S. C.-California meet last
Saturday.

Wells led Gansner of U. S. C. to the
tape in the high hurdles in the most
exciting race of the day. Both men
ran neck and neck until the final
stretch, where Wells won out by a
scant foot. Gansner was laid up with
blood poisoning when the varsity
was in Los Angeles, so this was their
first meeting.

"Dink" Templeton turned up yester
day and lost no time getting down to
the track. Among other things he
went over to the high jumping pit and
cleared the bar at G feet. "Dink"
seems to be just as good an athlete as
he ever was.
