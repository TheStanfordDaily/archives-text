# Famous Singer Tomorrow Night
## Louis Graveure Has Stellar Careerâ€”Regains Voice After Long Period 
### 
Louis Graveure, the famous Belgian,
who is to appear In concert in the
Stanford Assembly Hall tomorrow
night, is recognized as one of the
few really great baritone singers in
the musical world today. His reputa
tion is world-wide, and nas continued
ever since Ills remarkable concerts in
New York and Boston some years
ago, where he met with instantaneous
success.
This concert was given after several
years spent in seclusion on a ranch in
Canada, where he went soon after an
illness which resulted in the complete
loss of his voice. This occurred just
as he was attaining success in his
chosen field and was so severe that he
eventually gave up all thought-of ever
returning to the concert stage. When
it did come back much better than be
fore, with far more strength and
richer in quality, he was claimed once
more by the world of music.
Graveure is an artist in every sense
of the word. He is talented not only
in music, but has considerable ability
as a sculptor. He was forced to choose
between these two fields of expres
sion early in his life, and thus sculp
turing lost a talented artist which the
musical world gained.
Season tickets for this Peninsula
concert may be exchanged for re
served seats at the University drug
store in Palo Alto. Tickets for this
single concert may be obtained there
as well.
