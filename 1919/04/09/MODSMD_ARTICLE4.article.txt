# Encina Hall Goes on Ostrich Chase
## 
### 
"Ostrich, a long-necked bird with
beautiful plumage, whose most strik
ing characteristic is its habit of hid
ing its head at the approach of dan
ger," so says Webster, and unhappily,
so says Encina. The Zete dog and
the Delta Tau mastiff, not being
enough for the soon-to-be-famous En
cina concession at the carnival, they
must needs seek such birds and not
even those of the well-known barnyard
few type will do.
The snake, who wn. wind itself
around the neck of the snake charmer,
has already been found in the person
of a prominent campus man, who has
a peculiarly snaky character and dis
position. In size and length of neck,
trouble is found in securing an ostrich
or three ostriches, but apparently no
Stanford man has that so essential
characteristic of hiding his head upon
the approach of danger.
The Encina committee has spent
long hours on the postoffice steps
watching the antics of the roughs, but
whenever danger approaches in the
form of some luring female, these
prospective ostriches exhibit quite the
wrong characteristics. All the rest of
the body may be hidden, but never,
never the head.
So, Encina Hall is advertising for
tryoutees for the important position
of ostrich in the Encina concession.
Any one who has a long neck, sleek
plumage, and a disappearing head,
may qualify.
