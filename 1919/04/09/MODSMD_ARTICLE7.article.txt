# MANY STUNTS BEING PLANNED FOR LAKE CARNIVAL
## DANCING WILL FOLLOW Row, Encina, and Roble Hall Combine to Make Affair Great Success 
### 
Definite plans were formulated for
the Lake Carnival, to be held next Sat
urday evening, at a meeting of repre
sentatives, held last night at the Union.
Concessions of a bewildering variety
will be offered for the public's amuse
ment, between the hours of 7 and 9:30
on Saturday evening, which will in
clude every possible entertainment which
may lure the money from the students'
pockets.
All of the concessions will be situated
between Roble find the Men's Boat
house, according to the latest decision.
After the closing of the concessions at
9:30, nickle dancing at Roble and the
Zetft house will offer possibilities for the
remainder of the evening.
Encina will offer one of the most
elaborate concessions of the evening,
in the form of a side show circus. No
inside "dope" has been let out as yet,
but the concession is thought to offer
infinite possibilities. Once again the
women of the campus will be able to
enjoy the novel sensation of traveling
over the county road at night without a
chaperone, when the old crew bus starts
out on its numerous trips for the small
sum of five or ten cents. Canoes will
be rented for the evening and, as a
moon is scheduled for Saturday night,
this concession should prove to be one
of the most popular features of the
carnival.
Candies and ice cream will be sold
at a number of booths, while soft drinks
will be dispersed from a number of
bars Nigger-babies will tempt thQse
who consider themselves good shots,
and it is rumored that the Alpha Phi's
will preside over the ever popular slide.
More concessions have been promised
for the evening's entertainment and
every indication seems to point to fi
nancial prosperity for athletics during
the spring quarter.
