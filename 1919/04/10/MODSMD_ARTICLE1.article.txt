# "BOB" EVANS IS CHOSEN TO COACH NEXT YEAR'S ELEVEN
## 
### 
44 Q OB" EVANS was chosen by the Board of Athletic Control at a meeting
D hold last night to act as the Stanford football coach next year. He will
be allowed one assistant. The board also arranged for a definite football
schedule between Stanford, the University of Oregon, and the Oregon Agricul
tural College. The student manager has been authorized to sign a two-year
contract with the two northern universities, one game a year to be played with
each. The games will alternate, one being played on the Cardinal field, and
one on the opponents' gridiron. The home eleven will guarantee $1500 ex-

penses to the visiting football team.
The spring practice will last for six
weeks, and it is expected that all former
Stanford rugby players and American
football men will be out. The equipment
will be ordered immediately, and Stu
dent Manager Ames is making all ar
rangements for a few games in the
spring.
The selection of Evans as the head
football coach will undoubtedly be popu
lar among the students. Evans turned
out a good basketball team, and his
track squad is strong. Football is his
best* event, and his past record as a
player in Illinois, and later on as a
coach, goes a long way towards assuring
Stanford football followers of a well
trained eleven wearing the Cardinal.
The student manager wa salso author
ized to arrange a game with the Uni
versity of Southern California, and to
purchase equipment fo rthe spring foot
ball practice that will start immediately
after the track, anew, and baseball activi
ties with California are finished. Coach
Evans will have charge o fthe spring
practice, and will endeavor to build up a
nucleus for a victorious team next year.
