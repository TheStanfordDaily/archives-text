# "49" Camp Will be One Feature at Lake Carnival
## 
### 
If Palo Alto comes out and gives our
Lake Carnival the once over next Sat
urday night, and if that glance is a
hasty one, he is liable to jump into
a flivver and cliug-chug back to town
for the police. On the banks of La
gunita there will be a "49"' camp. But
if he stops to take another look he
will feel it his duty to get out of Lizzy
and go right over to investigate.
The foremost attraction of this con
cession will be the Red Gulch Bevo
Emporium, where the thirsty pros
pectors may quench their thirst with
"nothing proof" liquor served by smil
ing maids from the Row. The bar is
genuine but defunct, and has been
especially imported from Redwood,
brass rails and all!
Should he feel gamblish he may
watch the roulette wheel as it whirls
around to the tune of.
"Around and around
the little ball goes;
Where it stops
Nobody knows."
