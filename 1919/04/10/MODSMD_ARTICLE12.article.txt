# Site for Staging of Pageant Chosen
## Garnet Holme, Director, Finds Suitable Place at Entrance Into Memorial Court 
### 
Garnett Holme, who is now coach
ing the Garden and Garret Players in
San Francisco and who also was at
the head of the recent big pageant in
San Jose, has agreed to be pageant
master for Stanford's Historical Pa
geant. Last week, after carefully look
ing over the ground and the bill site,
he selected as the place for the pa
geant the entrance into Memorial
Court from Palm Drive. He pro
nounced this place, with its vista, its
winged collonades and terraced stairs
in the foreground one of the most
ideal pageant sites he had ever seen.
The Stanford pageant is to be an
historical representation of Stanford.
The very early history which paves
the way for Stanford, itself, is neces
sarily, from its very distance symbol
ical, it portrays the meeting of Por
tola with the Indians —the coming of
the Padres, etc. As the pageant prog
resses into actual Stanford history it
becomes more realistic. There is the
Suit, the Hard Times, with a comic
interlude of the boys living in the
workmen camps and the origin of the
Pajama Parade, after an obnoxious
freshman, who stole too scrawny a
chicken.
But breaking upon the alternating
seriousness and fun of Stanford life
come the calls of war, college life is
broken up and the men report for serv
ice. And Service is appropriately the
theme of Stanford's pageant, for it is
planned largely as a commemoration
for and welcom to the Stanford men
serving in the recent war.
The date of the pageant has been
set for Commencement Week in June.
