# STUDENTS FOR A STUDENT UNDERTAKING

### 
the announcement that a student committee had been
lUf r appointed to take charge of the campaign on the cam
-I)US tor funds for the Stanford Memorial, there.cannot fail to be
an element of satisfaction that the students of the University are
to be entrusted with the entire management of the student campaign for funds.
The Committee of Fifty for the Memorial showed a conspicuous absence of
undergraduate names, which may possibly be accounted for by the fact that
after all the preliminary plans involved consideration of all angles from all
standpoints, making the student element only one of the many to be con
sidered.
With the understanding that a campaign for funds is to take place on
the campus at some unannounced date in the future, the realization has
come that at last the real student share in the Memorial plans has been de
cided. This student share will undoubtedly be a big one, since after all, of
all the factors interested, the students vie with the alumni for immediate
interest in* the project.
The appointment of the committee shows careful consideration of all
the elements on the campus available to be drawn from. Members of the
student committee should learn that the announcement that they are mem
bers of the committee is not an honorary announcement, is not a college
honor, but is an imposed duty of a nature that must be considered a duty,
however pleasurable, until the task making it a duty is completed. t
It is not sufficient, however, that the members of the committee be awake
to the fact of what is required of them, but it is essential from the start of
the enterprise that the students in the Universiy realize that the committee
Is entrusted with acting in the coming campaign as merely the representative
body of the whole student organization, and can exist only as representatives
of the organization while it is backed by that student organization. It is
essential that the committee understand the nature of its work and it is essen
tial that the student body understand that the committee is only acting for
them and can only succeed through them.
No definite plans have been announced for the campaign, other than that
there is to be one, guided by a student committee and backed by a student
interest. This is the groundwork that preceds the main structure. Let us
lay this foundation solid enough to eventually support a worthy Memorial Hall.
