# LOUIS GRAVEURE TO SING HERE TONIGHT
## Famous Baritone to Give the Concluding Peninsula Concert Program 
### 
As a brilliant conclusion to the series
of concerts of the Peninsula Mussical
Association, Louis Graveure will give a
concert of exceptional musical interest
to the Stanford and Palo Alto audience
in the Assembly Hall tonight.
Graveure, a Belgian by birth, has had
wide technical training, which, added to
the inherent beauty of his voice, makes

him one of the greatest baritones of the
day. The tones which he secures, and
over which he has excellent control are
perfect throughout a wide range. T1 is
powers of interpretation are constantly
evidenced and he wins his audience to
him from the first. He enters at once
into the spirit of his work.
Graveure enjoys his singing, expressed
by a happy, bouyant spirit. His pro
gram tonight, at once varied and novel,
contains songs both familiar and new to
music lovers.
