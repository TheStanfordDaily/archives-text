# 1922 BASEBALL TEAM BEATEN BY PALO ALTO
## High School Carries Away Another Game From Freshmen 
### 
Without making an earned run the
Palo Alto High School defeated the
freshman baseball team by a 4-0 score.
In the third inning a base on balls, a
man hit, and a sacrifice brought in
two runs without the high school men
getting a hit. Several times the fresh
men got men on bases, but they were
not able to add the necessary stick
work to push the runs across.
Shamberger pitched a good game for
three innings and then was taken out
to give Neer a chance to warm up
against competition before the Cali
fornia series. Neer pitched two in
nings and allowed one run to cross the
plate. Sibley was then put in. His
arm was sore and he only lasted two
innings. He allowed one run to come
in. Mangin pitched the last two in
nings of the game. From the brand
of ball he showed last night it looks
as if he would have made a place on
the team had he been out all season.
Howe and Sliedd, pitching for Palo
Alto, had the babes completely at their
mercy, and allowed only three hits
in the nine irtnings. The freshman
pitchers were nicked for five hits. The
game was featured with errors on both
sides. Though the freshmen did not
show their usual class in the field,
their work was far from being poor.
The teams lined up as follows: Palo
Alto —Schofield, 2b; Proctor, cf.;
Hardeman, lb; Green, c.; Klein, ss.;
Sliedd, 3b and pitcher; Herdman,
If.; Dwight, rf.; and Howe, p.
Stanford —Stevenson, cf.; Wallace,
3b.; Spires, rf.; Holmes, If.; Davies
and Gomez, 2b; Russelot, ss.; Holston,
c.; Hawkes, lb; Shamberger, Neer,
Sibley, and Mangin, p.
