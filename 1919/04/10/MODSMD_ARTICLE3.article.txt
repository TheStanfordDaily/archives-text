# LISSNER TO JAZZ AT CREW HOP
## 
### 
Encina's new dance floor will be
thrown open for the first campus
dance this quarter tomorrow evening,
when the crew dance starts at 8:30
o'clock. The floor has been complete
ly relaid with highly polished hard
wood boards, and the large fireplace
at the end of the room will once more
come into use.
The dance is to be a crew benefit,
the entire gate receipts going to the
boat fund. Tickets have been placed
in the hands of representatives in all
the houses on the Row and at Enctna.
The price of admission is $1, and
everyone is expected to buy a ticket
whether he can attend the dance or

not, especially those who were not in
school last quarter, and did not get
the opportunity to donate to the crew
fund.
A five-piece orchestra will furnish
the music for the occasion. Louis
Lissner has donated his "jazz orches
tra," which will play the entire even
ing, instead of the previously an
nounced three orchestras. There will
be no refreshments or decorations, on
account of its being a benefit dance,
in which every possible cent is needed
by the crew.
Wade Stamp has been placed in
charge of the dance, and he is using
every effort to make the affair a suc
cess. He will probably be forced to
put the lower hallway into use, so
that the floor will not be too crowded.
Training rules may be taboo for this
one evening to let the crew men at
tend their own dance.
The student body does not get a
chance to see the crew in its work
ing until the big regatta, since there
are no preliminary matches, as in the
other sports. The only thing the stu
dents can do, is to donate to the crew
fund in the first part of the season and
then see the shell at the big race.
However, this year, Captain Watts is
planning a way to show the men and
women of the campus just what they
are subscribing for. As soon as the
eights are polished up a little more,
probably next week. Watts is going to
have his men give an exhibition on
the Redwood estuary.
