# LISSNER TO JAZZ AT CREW HOP

Encina's new dance floor will be
thrown open for the first campus
dance this quarter tomorrow evening,
when the crew dance starts at 8:30

wood boards, and the large fireplace
at the end of the room will once more
come into use.
The dance is to be a crew benefit,
the entire gate receipts going to the
boat fund. Tickets have been placed
in the hands of representatives in all
the houses on the Row and at Enctna.
The price of admission is $1, and
everyone is expected to buy a ticket

be no refreshments or decorations, on

in which every possible cent is needed
by the crew.
Wade Stamp has been placed in
charge of the dance, and he is using
