# INTERCLASS TRACK MEN WILL RUN IN MEET TOMORROW
## SENIORS ARE STRONGEST Varsity Stars Are Expected to Win for Upperclass Aggregation 
### 
STANFORD track fans will have an
opportunity to see one of the most
keenly contested meets of the season
when both varsity and freshman
squads clash on the oval Friday after
noon in the annual interclass meet.
This will be the first time of the year
that the entire squad has been on the
field and will give enthusists a
chance to see what the team looks
like as a whole.
Returned athletes who have not
taken part in former contests are now
rounding into condition and will speed
up the competition in this meet. May
nard and Hutchinson are the only men
on the squad who may not be able to
take part in Friday's contest.
Meet Called at 4 p.m.
Captain Teitsworth has set 4 p.m.
as the time for the meet and asks that
all contestants and officials be there
promptly at that time.
The showing made by the freshmen
in this meet will determine wwhether
or not they will hold their annual meet
with the University of California first
year men. The "babes'" interest in
track has increased considerable dur
ing the past week, but most of their
men came out so late that they have
not had a good chance to get into con
dition.
Seniors' Team Strongest
The team entered by the seniors will
be the strongest by far if that class is
allowed to claim all the holdovers who
have returned to college and the
fourth-year men should have no diffi
culty in piling high score. The 1921
team looms up as the next strongest
competitor in the field, but will hardly
he able to keep apace with the nine
teeners.
While appearing to be a little weak
er than the sophomores, the junior
team may be able to spring some sur
prises and defeat the underclass team
for second honors. The freshmen have
a few good men and will probably
come in for a good, many scattered
points.
The seniors are basing their claim
for supremacy on such men as "Ken"
Lilly for the sprints, Hertel in the 440,
Captain Teitsworth in the middle dis
tances, Westwick in the two-mile, and
('aughey, Curtice, Lynn, and Temple
ton in the field events.
Among the strongest men on the
junior lineup are Wells in the 220 and
hurdles, Dinkelspiel in the sprints and
quarter-mile, Wilkie in the half, Ter
man in the mile, with Shlaudeman,
Metcalf, and Byron in the field events.
Norman Green will be the strongest
contender for the sophomores and will
probably be high point winner of the
meet. Green is especially strong in
the pole vault, broad jump, discus, high
hurdles and javelin. Carlsmith,
Wright, Scofield, and Hertel will be
strong men in the middle distances,
while King may figure in the hurdles.
The second-year men are weak in
the distances, Perkins being the only
man who has run consistently in that
field. Teubner can be figured on for
points in the shot-put and Hartman
may show up for a place in the two
mile.

Seniors' Team Strongest
The team entered by the seniors will
be the strongest by far if that class is
allowed to claim all the holdovers who
have returned to college and the
fourth-year men should have no diffi
culty in piling high score. The 1921
team looms up as the next strongest
competitor in the field, but will hardly
he able to keep apace with the nine
teeners.
While appearing to be a little weak
er than the sophomores, the junior
team may be able to spring some sur
prises and defeat the underclass team
for second honors. The freshmen have
a few good men and will probably
come in for a good, many scattered
points.
The seniors are basing their claim
for supremacy on such men as "Ken"
Lilly for the sprints, Hertel in the 440,
Captain Teitsworth in the middle dis
tances, Westwick in the two-mile, and
('aughey, Curtice, Lynn, and Temple
ton in the field events.
Among the strongest men on the
junior lineup are Wells in the 220 and
hurdles, Dinkelspiel in the sprints and
quarter-mile, Wilkie in the half, Ter
man in the mile, with Shlaudeman,
Metcalf, and Byron in the field events.
Norman Green will be the strongest
contender for the sophomores and will
probably be high point winner of the
meet. Green is especially strong in
the pole vault, broad jump, discus, high
hurdles and javelin. Carlsmith,
Wright, Scofield, and Hertel will be
strong men in the middle distances,
while King may figure in the hurdles.
The second-year men are weak in
the distances, Perkins being the only
man who has run consistently in that
field. Teubner can be figured on for
points in the shot-put and Hartman
may show up for a place in the two
mile.
STANFORD track fans will have an
opportunity to see one of the most
keenly contested meets of the season
when both varsity and freshman
squads clash on the oval Friday after
noon in the annual interclass meet.
This will be the first time of the year
that the entire squad has been on the
field and will give enthusists a
chance to see what the team looks
like as a whole.
Returned athletes who have not
taken part in former contests are now
rounding into condition and will speed
up the competition in this meet. May
nard and Hutchinson are the only men
on the squad who may not be able to
take part in Friday's contest.
Meet Called at 4 p.m.
Captain Teitsworth has set 4 p.m.
as the time for the meet and asks that
all contestants and officials be there
promptly at that time.
The showing made by the freshmen
in this meet will determine wwhether
or not they will hold their annual meet
with the University of California first
year men. The "babes'" interest in
track has increased considerable dur
ing the past week, but most of their
men came out so late that they have
not had a good chance to get into con
dition.
