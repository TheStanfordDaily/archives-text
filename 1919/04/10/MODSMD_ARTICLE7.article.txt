the campaign for funds will be laid.
It is announced officially that the Com
mittee of Fifty intends to leave the
campus campaign entirely in the hands
of the students. When the call for
funds comes, a great response is ex
pected, as by that time it is consid

definite results are expected to be pub

was to be in the nature of a Memorial

memorial was announced as depending
