OFFICIAL announcement of the undergraduate committee which is to have

Memorial has been made by the undergraduate members of the Committee of
Fifty that is in general charge of plans and details for the Memorial.
Every living group upon the campus is represented in the committee list,
great care having been taken, according to the statement given out today, in
the selection of the men and women who are to have charge of the details of
the drive. Each fraternity and sorority upon the campus has one representa
tive on the committee; Japanese Club, Philippine Students, Chinese Students,
each have one, Roble Club and Palo Alto has two representatives, and Encina
Club, as the largest living group on the campus, has nine committeemen.

Committee to Meet Monday
The committee will hold its first
meeting Monday night in the Men's
Union at 8:30, when definite plans for
the campaign for funds will be laid.
It is announced officially that the Com
mittee of Fifty intends to leave the
campus campaign entirely in the hands
of the students. When the call for
funds comes, a great response is ex
pected, as by that time it is consid
ered as certain that sufficient interest
will have been created to insure ready
response to a student call. After the
committee's meeting Monday night,
definite results are expected to be pub
lished, outlining the campaign.
Tne announcement was made a
week ago that the Stanford Memorial
was to be in the nature of a Memorial
Hall, as something deemed a fitting
tribute to the men who were in serv
ice. The size and caliber of the
memorial was announced as depending
upon the support received from alumni
and students. The importance of the
work of the student campaign com
mittee was thus enphaslzed.
