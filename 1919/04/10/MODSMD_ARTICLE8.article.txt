# TRAPSHOOTING WILL BE STARTED ON FARM
## 
### 
Trap shooting is to be started at
Stanford, according to a decision reached
by th 6 Board of Athletic Control, last
night. The board authorized the pur
chase of all the necessary apparatus for
the trap.
The field in back of the Encina eat
ing clubs will be used for this sport.
There is a large number of students
interested in shooting, so the board took
this opportunity to start some competi
tion. It is probable that meets will be
held with other schools and clubs. The
traps are to be set up in the near future.
