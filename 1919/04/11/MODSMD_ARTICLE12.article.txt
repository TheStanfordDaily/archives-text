## BLUE AND GOLD FRESHMEN ARE STRONG Coach Cass Expects 1922 to Win Battleâ€”Batteries Uncertain

By J. W. Rhodes, '22
WHEN the 1922 nine goes up
against the Bruin cubs on Satur
day afternoon their chances of win
ning are about even. Coach Cass has
gotten a bunch of good horse-hide
chasers together and, though they
have not won many of their practice
games, it has been because the coach
has been trying the men out in vari
ous positions to see where they fit in
best, ('ass is confident of winning the
first game of the California series it'
the "babes" put up the brand of ball
lie has taught them.
As yet it is uncertain who will pitoli
the opening game. Unless Sibley can
get the soreness out of his arm the
mound will be handled by Shamberger
and Neer, with Mangin as the relief
pitcher. The rest of the team will
line up in the following order: Stev

Hawkes Best Infield Man
Coach Cass has developed a good
team out of very little material to
work with. The Cardinal "babes" are
an ail round fast team with few stars.
Captain Hawkes at first base is easily
the best man in the infield. He is field
ing them anywhere between second
base and the edge of the diamond.
Best of all, he is on his toes every
minute and keeps the rest of the men
on the jump. His weakest point is his
batting, but in the last two games he
seems to have found himself. The
greatest weakness of the team as a
whole is in their stick work.
In several ol' the games the 1!(22j
players hit anything that was offered j
to them. Against the pitchers of the I
varsity and those from Sail Jose High
School. Mountain View, and IJck their
hitting was Al.
The best man with the war club on
the team is Holmes. He has hit the
ball for one or more safeties in almost
every game and when his bat meets
the ball he hits it hard. He is closely
pressed for the batting honors by
Spires and Holston. This trio can be
depended upon to make it hot for the
Bruin pitchers during the series.
Stevenson Fast on Bases
Stevenson, the lead-off man and cen
ter fielder, is the fastest man on the
club. Me has a trick of getting on
base without hitting the ball, so
though his batting average is small,
he makes many runs. Gomez, at. sec
ond, is another hitless wonder. He
has scored more runs than any man
on the team on fewer hits. Sibley
and Holston hold the record for sac
rifice hits.
1 lie "babes" have a good infield. At
first Captain Hawkes is an all-star
player. Gomez and Davies are both
good second basemen, though they are
each weak with the stick. Rousselot
at short is putting up a fast game and
is showing his ability to hit in a
pinch. Wallace completes the infield
with a good record at third.
I lie outfield, made up of Holmes,
Spires .and Stevenson, is a hard hit
ting, sure fielding lot. Kew long flies
are missed. Holmes especially has a
strong throwing arm and cuts oft'
many possible runs at the plate with
nis long throws.
Shatuberger, Neer, and Sibley are
the twirlers who will in all probability
pitch the series. Cass will not decide
which man to use until he sees how
they work out before the game Sat
urday. Shamherger lias an underhand
ball that is a wliizzer and very good
control. Neer has a fast ball that is
known as lightning and his curves
have sharp hooks. Sibley is a south
paw and has a change of' pace that
fools most batters. He has better con
trol than most left-handers and is the
best batter of the trio. Holston is a
capable man for the place behind the
bat.
Connolly and McCullough will be!
held in reserve. They may get a i
chance to get their numerals in the
second game of the series or break l
into the first game as pinch hitters.

Hawkes Best Infield Man
Coach Cass has developed a good
team out of very little material to
work with. The Cardinal "babes" are
an ail round fast team with few stars.
Captain Hawkes at first base is easily
the best man in the infield. He is field
ing them anywhere between second
base and the edge of the diamond.
Best of all, he is on his toes every
minute and keeps the rest of the men
on the jump. His weakest point is his
batting, but in the last two games he
seems to have found himself. The
greatest weakness of the team as a
whole is in their stick work.

to them. Against the pitchers of the I
