## BLUE AND GOLD FRESHMEN ARE STRONG Coach Cass Expects 1922 to Win Battleâ€”Batteries Uncertain 
### 
By J. W. Rhodes, '22
WHEN the 1922 nine goes up
against the Bruin cubs on Satur
day afternoon their chances of win
ning are about even. Coach Cass has
gotten a bunch of good horse-hide
chasers together and, though they
have not won many of their practice
games, it has been because the coach
has been trying the men out in vari
ous positions to see where they fit in
best, ('ass is confident of winning the
first game of the California series it'
the "babes" put up the brand of ball
lie has taught them.
As yet it is uncertain who will pitoli
the opening game. Unless Sibley can
get the soreness out of his arm the
mound will be handled by Shamberger
and Neer, with Mangin as the relief
pitcher. The rest of the team will
line up in the following order: Stev
enson, cf.; Wallace, 3b; Spires, rf.;
Holmes, If.; Gomez or Davies, 2b;
llousselot, ss.; Holston, c.; Hawkes.

Hawkes Best Infield Man
Coach Cass has developed a good
team out of very little material to
work with. The Cardinal "babes" are
an ail round fast team with few stars.
Captain Hawkes at first base is easily
the best man in the infield. He is field
ing them anywhere between second
base and the edge of the diamond.
Best of all, he is on his toes every
minute and keeps the rest of the men
on the jump. His weakest point is his
batting, but in the last two games he
seems to have found himself. The
greatest weakness of the team as a
whole is in their stick work.
