### 
Louis (iraveure fulfilled the highest
expectations of the large audience in
his concert last night. As a conclusion
1o the Peninsula musical season this
noted baritone gave a program full of
varied interest and appeal. His inter
pretation of the Russian, French, Irish
and gipsy songs was clear and sympa
thetic. Mis magnificent personality add
ed charm and dignity.
(iraveure showed himself the confident
artist, sure of his tones throughout his
wide range and was always assured of
the interest and sympathy of his hearers,
lie commanded his powerful force with
perfect case, and technical perfection was
the result.
Although a Helgian, Graveure speaks
English without an accent, as a result of
a long period spent in England and
Canada. While singing in French he
felt himself perfectly at home, as he did
no less in English, and lifted his songs to
such a high plane through his remark
ahle interpretive ability that the mood
and feeling of the whole composition
was keenly and instinctively felt by
those who had little understanding of
the language.
\n interesting feature of the concert
was the inclusion of two songs com
p< -i d by the talented accompanist.
ISryceson 1 reharne. Throughout the en
tire program his playing was in accord
with the spirit and feeling of the violin
ist. and added to the charm and delight
of Uie evening.
