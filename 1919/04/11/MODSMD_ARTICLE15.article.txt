a announcement of the University authorities early in the
\ winter quarter that credit was to be given for war work
*JH corresponding with college work was very generous and deemed so
at the time. On the whole, the plan for distributing credit for
service has been successful, but unfortunately not to the extent that was con
templated. Examination of the results of the petitions handed in by the men
returning to college exposes grave, although probably unintentional, in
justices.
It is difficult to know when and where to draw the line; the discrepancies
do not appear to originate in this difficulty, however, but rather in the basis
for estimating university credit. In comparing the work a man did in the
army with courses in the university there is bound to be grave injustice upon
the man who did little technical work and yet saw much actual service. It
was the aim of every man in the service to see some action; some were more
fortunate than others in this respect. It is not fair, however, to penalize the
man who attended fewer specialists' schools and yet saw more service. On
the other hand, it is not right to penalize the man who remained in camps
without ever seeing service. The desire was the same with both; there should
be no injustice to either.
The basis of the estimate for credit seems to be wrong and unfortunately
appears to be working injustice upon those who attended fewer technical
training schools, despite the service that they may have seen. The sacrifice
in valuable time from college careers should be estimated on the same basis,
the choice of service was not with the idea of ultimate college credit. The
basis should not be entirely upon the grounds of actual college work learnt
in the service. There are other valuable assets to a college career derived
in the army and navy than those taught in training schools. If credit is given,
these assets should not be overlooked.
It is not too late to change this basis, since those who are now returning
are more liable to be done an injustice than those who returned before. Let
ns not penalize service; let us not, on the other hand, disparage those whose
overseas orders did not arrive in time. Let us manage to favor neither and
to give both their due in the apportionment of hours.
