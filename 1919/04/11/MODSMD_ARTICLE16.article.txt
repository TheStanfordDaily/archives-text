Freshmen interested in forming a

in back of Encina Hall on Monday night

interest has been exhibited in indoor
baseball that the idea of forming a
freshman team to play the different
fraternities, eating clubs, and other cam
pus organizations has found favor with
many 1922 men. Practice will be held
for an hour on every week-night if the
team is formed. An upper-classman has
volunteered his services as coach.
