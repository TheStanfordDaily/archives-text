# Big Hay Ride After.... ..Dance by Carnival... .....Transportation Co.
## 
### 
Three husky, red hay wagons will
await the trippers of the light fantastic
after the Roble (lance tomorrow night
for special delivery service up the Row
and around the campus. On the dot of
twelve the lights in the Hall will blink—
then'll come the dash for seats and
the long, long hay-ride over the hills and
far away and back again to home.
All of this, according to the presi
dent's office, will occur in exactly one
half an hour, but a lot can happen in
30 minutes, especially when the moon is
as and round as it will be tomorrow
night.
Down in the cactus, so silent and still,
up to Roble bridge, around the lake,
over roads that are never traveled in
the daytime—that's where the hay riders
will so. And the one dignified indi
vidual on the whole party will be the
tnan who drives the horses.
Machines and taxis aren't going to
be in it for transportation with these
carnival vehicles. Anyone can get an
Andrus taxi or a Ford, but it only hap
pens once in a lifetime that Mr. Hus
ton's big wagons arc used for hay-rides
in the small wee hours of the morning.
Twelve midnight—outside Roble—a
girl, a man and a hay-rider!!! .
