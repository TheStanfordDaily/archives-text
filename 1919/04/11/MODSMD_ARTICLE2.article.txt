# Benefit Crew Dance At Encina Tonight
## Newly Laid Floor Will Be Used for the First Time 
### 
The big crew dance will hold full sway
of the campus tonight on the Eneina
Hoor. when the music of Lissner's five
piece orchestra starts playing at 8:30
p.m. This is to he the lirst campus
clance on the newly laid hardwood Hoor.
The entire door receipts arc to go to
the crew fund, which is still in need
of more money. Ihe orchestra iias been
donated, and in order to increase the
dance profits, there will be no decora
tions or refreshments.
Captain Watts is turning out an ex
cedent eight, and is particularly anxious
for the student body to show the men
that they are being backed. A public
exhibition is being planned which will
give the campus an opportunity to see
the three shells working out on the Red
wood Estuary.
Since the Board of Athletic Control
has sanctioned the having of a crew
for the next four years, Watts is ex
tremely anxious to make it a success
this year and hopes for a big attendance
at the benefit dance tonight.
'I he crew men will not be permitted
to dance during the evening, on account
of training, but it is thought that they
will be in attendance. The dance is to
he a strictly informal affair with no
programs. However, for the benefit of
those wishing to make out programs in
advance, it has been announced that
there will be fifteen dances, with an
intermission between the ninth ami tenth
dances.
