# Illustrated of Today and of Yesterday
## 
### Henry Eickhoff, Jr., '18 
AMONG the official bulletins of the
University, catalogues of the mu
seums. and departmental reports, a
harsh critic might class the Stanford
Illustrated Review of today. Its col
umns contain vital statistics, other
historical items ,and correctly written,
boiled-over articles on campus affairs.
Famed in elaborate art work may be
found photographs of prominent
alumni, prominent "ex's," and other
by-gones.
Would the casual reader believe that
this self-same periodical once sold on
the campus faster than "Chappie" ever
dreamed of, and practically put two
other treasured publications in the
shade? It was known by many col
leges as one of the livest publications
produced by students anywhere. A
paper with a punch. And why?
To answer that question we must
return to the days that gave birth to
the "Illustrated," the time when "fol
low the leader" was not the game, but
the students believed that some of the
responsibility of running the Uni
versity fell upon their shoulders, and
accordingly co-operated by offering ad
vice and assistance.
Some of the brainiest men on the
campus, who afterwards edited the
paper, feeling the need of an organ to
represent student opinion in a pure
and unadulterated form, decided to
found a publication which might serve
as a perennial forum of debate. Its
columns were thrown wide to any
writer who dealt with a subject of in
terest, and handled it in a reasonable
manner. The photographic section
was to be an up-to-date record of all
Stanford activities.
And so the "Illustrated," as the stu
dents called it, was launched, For
two semesters it thrived, was gener
ally read by students and faculty alike,
and picked up in circulation with
amazing rapidity. It contained criti
cism which was constructive and well
taken, and the entire Stanford com
munity felt the stimulating effect of
this new independent periodical.
Then came the war and with it
financial difficulties.
The alumni had become interested
in this small "New Republic," and
many had subscribed. It was suggest
ed that with the financial hacking of
the "Alumnus" a very good result
would be attained. By a combinaation
of the two papers, the Illustrated
would be given a new lease on life,
its permanence practically would be
assured. While the "Alumnus" would
lose no subscribers but rather would
gilin through being sold on the cam
pus.
The amalgamation was put through
on these strict conditions: (1) That
the students continue to edit the paper
free from faculty supervision and cen
sor. (2) That the material necessary
to the "Alumnus" merely be incor
porated in the magazine. (3) That
as long as nothing repugnant occurred
in the columns, this agreement should
continue.
That is the history of the Illustrated
with the exception of the last link.
The board of editors went to war.
Control was assumed by the Alumni
representatives, and they published
the Illustrated Review we see today,
a good paper, but one entirely missing
the spirit of the original magazine.
| Note: After complimenting the
founders and original editors of the
Stanford Illustrated Review, the writer
feels called upon to state that he was
not one of them, merely becoming
staff photographer at a later date.l

as long as nothing repugnant occurred
in the columns, this agreement should
continue.
That is the history of the Illustrated
with the exception of the last link.
The board of editors went to war.
Control was assumed by the Alumni
representatives, and they published
the Illustrated Review we see today,
a good paper, but one entirely missing
the spirit of the original magazine.

AMONG the official bulletins of the
University, catalogues of the mu
seums. and departmental reports, a
harsh critic might class the Stanford
Illustrated Review of today. Its col
umns contain vital statistics, other
historical items ,and correctly written,
boiled-over articles on campus affairs.
Famed in elaborate art work may be
found photographs of prominent
alumni, prominent "ex's," and other
by-gones.
Would the casual reader believe that
this self-same periodical once sold on
the campus faster than "Chappie" ever
dreamed of, and practically put two
other treasured publications in the
shade? It was known by many col
leges as one of the livest publications
produced by students anywhere. A
paper with a punch. And why?
To answer that question we must
return to the days that gave birth to
the "Illustrated," the time when "fol
low the leader" was not the game, but
the students believed that some of the
responsibility of running the Uni
versity fell upon their shoulders, and
accordingly co-operated by offering ad
vice and assistance.
Some of the brainiest men on the
campus, who afterwards edited the
paper, feeling the need of an organ to
represent student opinion in a pure
and unadulterated form, decided to
found a publication which might serve
as a perennial forum of debate. Its
columns were thrown wide to any
writer who dealt with a subject of in
terest, and handled it in a reasonable
manner. The photographic section
was to be an up-to-date record of all
Stanford activities.
And so the "Illustrated," as the stu
dents called it, was launched, For
two semesters it thrived, was gener
ally read by students and faculty alike,
and picked up in circulation with
amazing rapidity. It contained criti
cism which was constructive and well
taken, and the entire Stanford com
munity felt the stimulating effect of
this new independent periodical.
Then came the war and with it
financial difficulties.
The alumni had become interested
in this small "New Republic," and
many had subscribed. It was suggest
ed that with the financial hacking of
the "Alumnus" a very good result
would be attained. By a combinaation
of the two papers, the Illustrated
would be given a new lease on life,
its permanence practically would be
assured. While the "Alumnus" would
lose no subscribers but rather would
gilin through being sold on the cam
pus.
The amalgamation was put through
on these strict conditions: (1) That
the students continue to edit the paper
free from faculty supervision and cen
sor. (2) That the material necessary
to the "Alumnus" merely be incor
porated in the magazine. (3) That
as long as nothing repugnant occurred
in the columns, this agreement should
continue.
