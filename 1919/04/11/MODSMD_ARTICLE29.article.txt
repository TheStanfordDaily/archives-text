# THE
						MODERN POET HAS NOTHING ON OLD EURIPIDES

### Evelyn Gore, '22 
EVEN people not related to Mr. Gil
bert Murray will agree that Euri
pides, in a way, is a modern poet, not
withstanding the fact that he wrote
more than two thusand years ago.
Fashions in poetry and music change
as much as do fashions in hats and
neckties. It is interesting, especially at
this time to compare Euripides' way of
expressing himself with t lie prevalent
mode of today.
If for instance, Euripides wished to
represent, as lie does in Medea, a wo
man's rejection of the affections of a
certain man, he puts into the mouth of
that character such words as these:
"I will have naught to do with [
thee.
(>r friends of thine; naught will 1 j
receive of thee,
Offer it not to me."
How would a modern poet treat a |
similar topic? Probably as has re
cently been done, like this:
"You can have it,
I don't want it.
1 mean your love and sympathy.
Take it away."
Clytemnestra's fears that her husband
Agamemnon, in the play by that name,
may not be content to rest at home after
the sack of Troy, might be rendered in
a modern song, â€”changing the scene of
action from Troy to Paris:
"How are you goin' to keep 'em
down on the farm,
After they have seen Paree?"
Admetus, two thousand years ago,
could say to Alcestis:
"Steel not thy heart to leave me,"
but a poet of today, to be avowedly
great, must express the same idea in the
following terms:
"I hate to lose yoli.
I'm so used to you now."
Yeah, except in a few minor details,
Euripides has much in common with the
modern poet.
