# Outlook for Spring Sports
## 
### Jessee E. Thrash, '21 
AS the crunch of spikes on the track, the crash of ball and bat, and the rythmic
dip of tlu* oars become more and more intensive, sport enthusiasts arc
beginning to dope out the possibilities of the Cardinal teams in their spring
athletic clashes. In two of the biggest sports of the season, crew and track,
the Stanford teams look like winners. In other sports the odds are even, while
still others have a decided Blue and Gold appearance.
Ju all branches of sports exceptionally good

teams are being developed, many of which look
as if they could outshine the fatuous Cardinal
teams of pre-war days. California is
starting out on a new athletic era with particularly
strong material. From the present outlook this
season's contests will he some of the hardest fought
clashes in years.
The chances for winning a seventh straight vic
tory over the Blue and Gold in track loom up
brighter every week as Stanford track men round
into better condition. The California team is
stronger than last year and will without a doubt
furnish some of the fastest competition that it has
put forth in years. All around men like Merchant
and other stars, such as Johnson and Sprott, will
be a big factor in piling up points for the Rlue and
(iold.
With the return of "Dink" Templeton to the
"Farm", Stanford's weakest spot, the jumps, have
been considerably strengthened. Other returned
athletes have strengthened the team at various
places until the present squad looks about twice as
strong as did the turnout for track at the beginning
of the season.

On the estuary the varsity and freshman squads are turning out crews that
will be as strong as any of past years.. The members of the varsity eight are
improving in condition every day and are sending the shell over its two-mile
course with more and more speed. California's varsity this year does not seem
to be as strong as usual. Only one former oarsman, Stebbins, has returned for
a place in the boat.
According to reports coming from across the bay, the California freshman
crew is daily outdistancing the varsity combination. Captain Watts and Coach
Rogers are confident that Stanford's first-year oarsmen are stronger than they
have been for many years, but they will have to put up a mighty hard fight if
they keep up the old-time precedent of defeating the Berkeley "babes". It would
not be at all surprising to sec the California first-year men come through and
upset the dope by covering the two-mile course in the best time.
Very little is known of the strength of the crcws which are being turned
out by the University of Washington. The. northern oarsmen will enter three
crews, a varsity, a freshman, and a second varsity eight. Their unknown strength
Now that four-year contracts have been made with California and Washing
ton, the water sport promises to come back with all the old-time importance.
