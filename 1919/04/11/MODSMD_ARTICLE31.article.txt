# Seniors Take New Hold on Activities
## 
### Neil H. Petree, '19 
WAKING from that sleep that
dates hack to the time the United
States went into the war, the 1919 class
is rapidly coming back as the leader
in university activities. This spring
quarter brought back many of the
nineteeners and now college affairs
again find the members of this class
among the lights. Running over the
list of the present seniors, one finds
little dead wood, and regardless of
the effect of the war, the graduating
class promises surprise in its manner of
conducting the various events that Stan
ford tradition requires of a class about
to leave the University.
R. F. Pelouze was selected to be the
leader of the class last quarter. His
enthusiasm lias a splendid opportunity
to show itself in his present work, and
with the class both numerically and in
dividually strong, Pelouze will have lit
tle trouble in accomplishing much dur
ing the next three months. He has
selected the senior committees, and work
is already under way toward making the
Senior Ball, the Farce, and other promin
ent senior events successes long to be
remembered.
In university activities, the 1919 class
has been a leader from entrance. De
feating the sophomores in the poster
fight rush, the class immediately won a
name. Later when the 1919 freshman
baseball team not only defeated the
second year men in the annual game,
but successfully returned the baseball
after the rush, its reputation as a class
with not just pale pink spirit, but that
of the real Stanford red, was made.
With Cowan, Lilly, Shriver, Messick.
Reagan, Ryan. Draper, Peterson, and
Mitchell on the baseball nine, the follow
ers of the game on the campus voted
the 1919 team the prize aggregation of
recent years. Altho defeated by the
Santa Clara University first year team,
the freshman ruggers proved to be one
of the strongest combinations Stanford
had turned out. Pelouze, Davis, Zane,
Swarts. Boulware. Flugel, Sayre, Long,
and Wark were players that went to
make a speedy fifteen. In track, one
has but to name House, Teitsworth,
Wark, Price, Pelouze, Wilcox, and Ba
con to demonstrate the 1919 cinder men'>
ability to take points. In crew, the class
I turned out a boat that would do credit
to any varsity shell. Six of the oars
men have since rowed on Stanford var
sity crews. In dramatics, journalism,
and other college activities, the class of
1919 showed exceptional strenght in its
initial year.
In its second year at college, the class
produced several men whose reputation
will last long in journalistic records.
Carl Randau and Sam Briggs have bail
few equals on the campus, and their
work on the Daily Palo Alto. Illustrated
Review, and Chapparal has been an in
spiration to the younger university jour
nalists of today.
Badly scattered as a result of the war,
it looked for a time as though the spring
of 1919 would roll around with few of*
the original members of the class read\
to graduate, or even in the University.
Contrary to expectations, over two hun
dred nineteeners are in college, and the
number on the list to graduate at the
conclusion of this quarter is consider
able. Many of the seniors who have
been out of college for over a year
serving in the army and navy, will be
able to graduate by Christmas, thus
finishing in 1919.
Teitsworth. Lilly, Watts, King. Pe
louze. Williamson. Antrim, and Whca!
ton. are some of the seniors now doing
their share in reviving the old spirit
around the campus that seemed to be
on its last legs a few months ago. It
Stanford is able to vanquish the Uni
versity of California in tin spring sports,
if the students are able to again take
over the control of their own affairs
which the faculty took from them when
thoy were weak as a result of the in
roads of war; if the old pep bucket of
Cardinal paint is again spilled on the
campus so that every Stanford man has
a real Stanford spirit; and if all collegt
activities again assume a pre-war ap
pearance, the class of 1919 will do a
greater part of the work, for the seniors
have waked from more than a year's
sleep, and the graduating class is again
imbibed with the enthusiasm and spirit
that marked its progress during its first
two years at Stanford.

with the class both numerically and in
dividually strong, Pelouze will have lit

ing the next three months. He has
selected the senior committees, and work
is already under way toward making the
Senior Ball, the Farce, and other promin
ent senior events successes long to be
remembered.
In university activities, the 1919 class
has been a leader from entrance. De
feating the sophomores in the poster
fight rush, the class immediately won a
name. Later when the 1919 freshman
baseball team not only defeated the
second year men in the annual game,
but successfully returned the baseball
after the rush, its reputation as a class
with not just pale pink spirit, but that
of the real Stanford red, was made.
With Cowan, Lilly, Shriver, Messick.
Reagan, Ryan. Draper, Peterson, and
Mitchell on the baseball nine, the follow
ers of the game on the campus voted
the 1919 team the prize aggregation of
recent years. Altho defeated by the
Santa Clara University first year team,
the freshman ruggers proved to be one
of the strongest combinations Stanford
had turned out. Pelouze, Davis, Zane,
Swarts. Boulware. Flugel, Sayre, Long,
and Wark were players that went to
make a speedy fifteen. In track, one
has but to name House, Teitsworth,
Wark, Price, Pelouze, Wilcox, and Ba
con to demonstrate the 1919 cinder men'>
ability to take points. In crew, the class
I turned out a boat that would do credit
to any varsity shell. Six of the oars
men have since rowed on Stanford var
sity crews. In dramatics, journalism,
and other college activities, the class of
1919 showed exceptional strenght in its
initial year.
In its second year at college, the class
produced several men whose reputation
will last long in journalistic records.
Carl Randau and Sam Briggs have bail
few equals on the campus, and their
work on the Daily Palo Alto. Illustrated
Review, and Chapparal has been an in
spiration to the younger university jour
nalists of today.
Badly scattered as a result of the war,
it looked for a time as though the spring
of 1919 would roll around with few of*
the original members of the class read\
to graduate, or even in the University.
Contrary to expectations, over two hun
dred nineteeners are in college, and the
number on the list to graduate at the
conclusion of this quarter is consider
able. Many of the seniors who have
been out of college for over a year
serving in the army and navy, will be
able to graduate by Christmas, thus
finishing in 1919.
Teitsworth. Lilly, Watts, King. Pe
louze. Williamson. Antrim, and Whca!
ton. are some of the seniors now doing
their share in reviving the old spirit
around the campus that seemed to be
on its last legs a few months ago. It
Stanford is able to vanquish the Uni
versity of California in tin spring sports,
if the students are able to again take
over the control of their own affairs
which the faculty took from them when
thoy were weak as a result of the in
roads of war; if the old pep bucket of
Cardinal paint is again spilled on the
campus so that every Stanford man has
a real Stanford spirit; and if all collegt
activities again assume a pre-war ap
pearance, the class of 1919 will do a
greater part of the work, for the seniors
have waked from more than a year's
sleep, and the graduating class is again
imbibed with the enthusiasm and spirit
that marked its progress during its first
two years at Stanford.
WAKING from that sleep that
dates hack to the time the United
States went into the war, the 1919 class
is rapidly coming back as the leader
in university activities. This spring
quarter brought back many of the
nineteeners and now college affairs
again find the members of this class
among the lights. Running over the
list of the present seniors, one finds
little dead wood, and regardless of
the effect of the war, the graduating
class promises surprise in its manner of
conducting the various events that Stan
ford tradition requires of a class about
to leave the University.
R. F. Pelouze was selected to be the
leader of the class last quarter. His
enthusiasm lias a splendid opportunity
to show itself in his present work, and
with the class both numerically and in
dividually strong, Pelouze will have lit
