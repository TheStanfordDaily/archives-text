## WHAT IS IT? 
### 
iff agitation for it was started with the winter quarter
& and the return of men from service, we have heard
; i great deal about Student Control. We have heard much of how
;o get it, why we should have it, its benefits, its failure under stringent
conditions before, its possibility of failure or success in the future. We have
heard no definite viewpoint upon the fundamentals of the case. What is Stu
dent Control? What do we want with Student Control?
What Is Student Control?
As to "What is Student Control?" Definitions are at best only vague and
intangible things; definitions of a system are vastly more vague and intangible
than even any other definitions. And Student Control is a system. That is its
■ rst essential. It is a system of self-government l}y the students of the Uni
versity. In this it must be distinguished from student government of which
it may or may not be a part. More than government it is a system of control
• r regulation of student conduct in spheres in which a casual student govern
ment cannot actually, or seldom does, at any rate, interfere. It is a regulation
• i the conduct of the individual of the University, and naturally involves the
subject of discipline of the individual when he breaks the rules of conduct which
it lays down. No definition is absolutely complete without comparison to what
it is opposed to. Student Control is opposed to no control and to Faculty Con
trol. No control has proved its undesirability in past ages, one might say. and
Faculty Control has proved its undesirability both from student and faculty
standpoint in its former and again in its very recent incarnation.
Student Control Is a System of Regulation
Thus we find that Student Control in its essentials is a system whereby
the students of the University regulate their own conduct and provide for
punishment for violation of these regulations of conduct through self-discipline.
Furthermore, we find that Student Control is opposed to no control on the one
hand and to Faculty Control on the other. A further limitation might be added
in that agitation for Student Control is in this instance limited to the men of
the University, since the women have clung to their form of student control
adopted several years ago.
