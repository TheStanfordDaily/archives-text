# WHAT DO WE WANT?
## 
### 
the continuation of this agitation, we find that the
I second fundamental question after "What is Student
\jWRA Control?" is "What do we Want?" With the agitator's customary
inconsistency all the talk and discussion on Student Control seems
"Why do we want it?"
to have slipped by these first two questions and gone on to answer a third, viz:
Having attempted to answer what is Student Control, let us now see what it
is that we really want. First of all, we do not want to make the mistake of
the past: we do not want a Student Control such as fell into such disfavor and
disgrace in the last period of its existence. It is a toss-up as to whether Faculty
Control with all its unpleasantness is more disfavorable and unsuccessful than
a poor Student Control. We do not want a poor system of Student Control.
We do not want a system that will be a failure. We do not want a system that
will be a farce. We do want a system that will be a success.
Sudcessful System Is Wanted
We want a system that will be a success because it succeeds, because it
operates efficiently and courageously, because it operates in'line with the better
-entiment of the student body in accord with the regulations laid down for that
student body. It will make its mistakes, since no system in which humans are
concerned is perfect, but these mistakes ought surely to be discounted by its
greater benefits. We want therefore a system that will succeed in its operation,
as a system succeeding within itself.
But in looking for the ultimate success of Student Control, let us go beyond
its outward success, beyond its succeeding as a system, and let us look towards
success of Student Control as an institution. As an institution Student Con
trol will not be a mere disciplining body. It will be a training body. It will be a
school for citizenship. It will be an institution for the development of that
independent type of American manhood which can come from the most demo
cratic University in the country. It is a system that will develop into an insti
tution characteristic of Stanford University, characteristic of the western type of
democracy of which we are beginning to be so proud, and characteristic of the
\merican democracy of which we are already so proud.
Institution of Western Democracy
Student Control to us and to the studeot body at large, we feel, should not
be a failure in the past, not a farce as mayhap at the University of California,
but a real success. It is this success that we want when we say we want Stu
dent Control. We want its success as a system of meeting student regulatory
and disciplinary problems and we want its success as an institution for the
development of the better, more efficient and more democratic citizen.
