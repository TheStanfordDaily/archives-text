# NEED FOR INFORMATION CONCERNING STUDENT CONTROL EVIDENT ON CAMPUS
## 
### W.F. Leiser, '21 
A Freshman yesterday remarked, "I
am often advised by upperclassmen
that I should support student control,
and that it will do us a great good; hut
having lived on the campus just three
months, I have only a hazy idea of
what such government means. What is
student control?''
I answered that he knew probably as
much about it as I did, explaining some
of the few principals that 112 under
stood. "What is your trouble?" I asked.
"My trouble," he said, "is that I am
unable to learn anything about student
government. Whenever I ask. T am
told that it is a fine thing; but no one
tells me what it is, how it works, or
why it presents the benefits that it pur
ports to give. I came from a school
where we had certain ideas about stu
dent control, but they don't seem to ap
ply here. I wish that some one would
explain to me just what student control
here means, why wc need it, and just
how it is different from the present
method of governing the student body.
I went to the underclass meeting a few
weeks ago hoping to learn something of
student affairs. I heard several prom
inent athletes tell us that we needed

"jazz," and that it was up to us to get
it. As far as student control is con
cerned. I believe we could get more jazz
if we knew what it was."
ft seems that in some ways the fresh
man may be right. When new men ask
about student control they often get
such enlightening answers as "Why!
(jet on the boat," or "That is just what
we want you to think about.". In other
words "Student Control" seems to im
part an impression somewhat similar to
the "League Â«>f Nations," which stands
for an ideal with which most people
agree in principle, but about which the
common man doesn't get much concrete
information, Perhaps student control
could be considerably advanced by some
one who would explain quickly, or pub
lish an exposition of the meaning, neces
sity, and advantages of student govern
ment as seen by foremost upperclassmen
who are promoting it, together with a
consideration of the more important
difficulties in the way of its attainment.
Or the present method of governing stu
dent activities and conduct might be ex
plained in an understandable fashion.
At any rate, there can be no harm in
oresentine the freshman's viewpoint.
