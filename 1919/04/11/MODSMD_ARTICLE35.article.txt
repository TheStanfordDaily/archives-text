# CAN THERE BE FOUND A SUBSTITUTE FOR WATER?

### Floyd L. McElroy, '20 
46 11 has been the presumption—
1 that there are many problems
connected with the university stu
dent's existence." It is a known fact
that, the presumption of society is
against anything new. Stanford so
ciety, especially, is true in this re
spect. In years gone by certain events
of a similar character occurred each
year, and through custom and usage
this oral transmission of events and
practices, through successive genera
tions without written memorials he
came known as tradition. It might be
said that. Stanford society's presump
tion is against anything that breaks
down her long practiced and dearly
cherished tradition.
For many years it has fallen upon
the shoulders of the sophomores, both
in the hall and in the fraternities, to
discipline the freshmen, i. e., there
were certain duties that had to be
pei formed, certain inalienable rights
of upperclassmen that had to be main
tained and .above all, traditions that
had to be taught. Sophomores in the
past have been thoroughly disciplined
in Stanford ideals, democracy and tra
ditions, and they felt it their duty, in
ract they enjoyed, perpetuating such a
spirit.
But this year two rules, probably
well founded and based on fact, have
taken freshman discipline out. of their
hands: (1) The one-year dormitory
rule. (2) The absolute prohibition of
"tubbing" as a means of discipline.
These are good rules. But they bring
up several problems that are loom
ing larger and larger as time passes.
How are the fraternities going to dis
cipline their freshmen? By discipline
we don t mean an. eternal or contin
ual imbibing of aqua for the first year,
but a method by which Stanford tra
ditions may be thoroughly instilled
into the new generation.
Freshman discipline itself is a tra
dition. Can the hall rightly discipline
the fraternity freshmen? What is the
status of a fraternity freshman in the
hall, in regard to "freshman duties"?
These are a few of the small yet an
noying problems. Why annoying?
Because, unfortunately, the members
of the Class of 1922 appear to know
no more about Stanford tradition, de
mocracy, and spirit than if such things
never existed. It isn't their fault. It
is their training that is to be consid
ered. The sophomores have rightfully
obeyed "Daddy," and they have not
given their younger brothers the right
training in their new Stanford home.
Like adopted children they must be
reared. If they know no traditions
now what will they know when they
are seniors?
Encina Hall has certain traditions
or its own in respect to frosh duties.
For instance, it has a "frosh phone
schedule." Each freshman is expect
ed to do one hour of phone duty a
week. Not much of a hardship, is it?
Bnt whenever the phone bell rings and
there doesn't happen to be a man on
duty—this very frequently happens
now that the tubs are soldered up—
you have to politely ask one of the
freshmen to please answer the phone.
He may ask, "Why don't you answer
it yourself?" The answer is that it
isn't tradition. That is a freshman
duty and a privilege. Well, anyway,
you get back a haughty, "This ain't
my hour on," and off he struts.
Freshmen are not supposed to play
pool at Encina after 8 o'clock in the
evening. Time and again a cigar-like
roll of small gray caps is seen circling
the tables after 9:30, while upperclass
men patiently take back seats. Trunks
often remain in the lobby for days be
fore freshmen can be found to carry
them upstairs, and these same frosh
think nothing of asking you for a
cigarette. "Dinks" are probably un
known to a great many of them.
However, we believe the class is
capable of learning. It nun-its some
consideration, but first it must loam
the rudiments of Stanford tradition.
The way upperclassmen have almost
begged them on their knees to get out
for athletics with no response has
been disappointing.
Will the Class of 1922 forfeit the
track meet to the Bruins? Is this a
way to learn Stanford spirit? Fresh

men should remember that Stanford
is known for her men. and that this
year's beginning class is the nucleus
for her future men. This class will
run student affairs in 1922. Stanford
traditions must be preserved.
There are two months and two days
left in which to instill Stanford spirit
into the coming generation. The
freshmen are eager to learn, and soph
omore traditional discipline is stand
ing silently in abeyance. What both
are looking for is a means which will
serve the same purpose as did the old
time tubbing. But is there a substi
tute for water? It's up to the sopho
mores to find out.
