# Who Pays for Physical Training?
## 
### E.R. Caughey, '19 
SLV LRAL lessons have been learned from the late world war, but
probably none was more self-evident or acted upon *o universally as the
fact that in order to have a fighting army you must build up and keep men in
good physical condition. Various governments adopted means of doing this,
but the American system of physical training and athletic games of all forms
gave the best results. With the ending of hostilities and the return of soldiers
to their homes that lesson has not been forgotten. A popular wave in favor
of clean athletics has gone over the country. Many state legislatures have
passed compulsory physical training laws—to be sure, not all worded the same
but all realizing that in order to have a strong, sturdy race we must have clean
bodies and clear minds. Ihe best way to reach such a result is physical educa
tion or, in other words, athletics.
Stanford University, and when I use that term I use it in the abstract
sense, has never made physical training a part of its curriculum and made it a
separate department. Ihe majority of the large institutions of the country
have long had a separate department for physical training and have maintained
it out of the university funds. Our great rival across the bay has such a
system at present and was able to furnish competent assistants to the govern
ment from tliat department.
Who does pay for physical training at Sanford? There is only one answer
to that and that is "the students . 1 here are two minor exceptions to this
which I will mention later. Xow as to how much we pav and where it goes.
Every quarter as part of our registration fee we pay $5. One dollar of this
is set aside to pay off the student body debt and interest on the same which
has to be met. 1 do not think anybody will begrudge that money. Tt is true that
we did not ourselves incur the debt, but as Stanford men and women, we
take up the burden of past years in the same spirit as we would have enjoyed a
surplus if conditions had been different. That dollar to my mind is a contribution
of the present Stanford generation showing that it has the fighting spirit and
had missed the opportunity to be up in that branch of knowledge.
Two dollars goes for student body tickets which entitle the holders to
admittance to practically all contests in which Stanford men participate. The
money from this source is used to pay the coaches, to keep up the athletic fields
and to meet incidental expenses lnctnred in all branches, such as visiting teams'
expenses, purchase of equipment, etc.
Ihe remaining two dollars is used to pay the running expenses of the
gymnasium, which include the expenses of the various officials. The University
here does pay the medical director and the head of the gymnasium, which are
the exceptions I have been able to discover. University credit is given for
subjects taken under these men who arc paid by the students and the hours go
toward graduation. It is on the same basis in that way as the economic, law
or any other department, and I can see no valid reason why the University should
not treat it as such.
Under the present law in California, physical instructors will be needed
throughout the state. The time is surely coming when every high school of
any size will have a physical director. We want to be in a position to fill that
need, and the only way we can do so is to have physical education as a
separate department in which all students would have an opportunity to enroll.
1 o say that such a department is not necessary would not be speaking the truth.
One has only to look at the summer-school classes conducted by the University
of California to see that. Many high school professors have taken this course
during the last few years realizing that when they graduated from college they
had missed the opportunity to be up in that branch of kowledge.
Anybody who has made a semi-quarterly pilgrimage to the business office
and who is "fined" for a slight delay will realize that the financial side should
not be forgotten. Goodness knows that living conditions are high enough, and
it seems to me that the University is getting all the money from students it
possibly could expect, keeping in mind the purpose of the founders of this
institution, —to enable all persons at a minimum expense to get the benefit of
their bequest.
After the earthquake, with its tremendous loss and cost of rebuilding, the
University funds were at a low ebb. Consequently, when the present gym
nasium was built the students agreed to pay for the running of the gym if
the University would build it. It appears to me though that, regardless of any
such agreement, the University should have built the gymnasium as something
which was a necessity not to the sudents, but to the institution itself.
The time to institute a new policy toward physical education has arrived
A period of general reconstruction is at hand and nobody can afford to lag
behind. Stanford University cannot afford to lag behind; and if the University
officials would make this change they would be putting us on a better basis
to meet the future problems. They would insure to incoming students that
when they graduated from here and perchance taught school they could com
pete against anybody in their line. Tt is not a question of a new department
being instituted, such as installing an agricultural college, but simply that of
changing the present system svligh'tly, for we already have on hand the essential
makings.

1 o say that such a department is not necessary would not be speaking the truth.
One has only to look at the summer-school classes conducted by the University
of California to see that. Many high school professors have taken this course
during the last few years realizing that when they graduated from college they
had missed the opportunity to be up in that branch of kowledge.
Anybody who has made a semi-quarterly pilgrimage to the business office
and who is "fined" for a slight delay will realize that the financial side should
not be forgotten. Goodness knows that living conditions are high enough, and
it seems to me that the University is getting all the money from students it
possibly could expect, keeping in mind the purpose of the founders of this
institution, —to enable all persons at a minimum expense to get the benefit of
their bequest.
After the earthquake, with its tremendous loss and cost of rebuilding, the
University funds were at a low ebb. Consequently, when the present gym
nasium was built the students agreed to pay for the running of the gym if
the University would build it. It appears to me though that, regardless of any
such agreement, the University should have built the gymnasium as something
which was a necessity not to the sudents, but to the institution itself.
The time to institute a new policy toward physical education has arrived
A period of general reconstruction is at hand and nobody can afford to lag
behind. Stanford University cannot afford to lag behind; and if the University
officials would make this change they would be putting us on a better basis
to meet the future problems. They would insure to incoming students that
when they graduated from here and perchance taught school they could com
pete against anybody in their line. Tt is not a question of a new department
being instituted, such as installing an agricultural college, but simply that of
changing the present system svligh'tly, for we already have on hand the essential
makings.
SLV LRAL lessons have been learned from the late world war, but
probably none was more self-evident or acted upon *o universally as the
fact that in order to have a fighting army you must build up and keep men in
good physical condition. Various governments adopted means of doing this,
but the American system of physical training and athletic games of all forms
gave the best results. With the ending of hostilities and the return of soldiers
to their homes that lesson has not been forgotten. A popular wave in favor
of clean athletics has gone over the country. Many state legislatures have
passed compulsory physical training laws—to be sure, not all worded the same
but all realizing that in order to have a strong, sturdy race we must have clean
bodies and clear minds. Ihe best way to reach such a result is physical educa
tion or, in other words, athletics.
Stanford University, and when I use that term I use it in the abstract
sense, has never made physical training a part of its curriculum and made it a
separate department. Ihe majority of the large institutions of the country
have long had a separate department for physical training and have maintained
it out of the university funds. Our great rival across the bay has such a
system at present and was able to furnish competent assistants to the govern
ment from tliat department.
Who does pay for physical training at Sanford? There is only one answer
to that and that is "the students . 1 here are two minor exceptions to this
which I will mention later. Xow as to how much we pav and where it goes.
Every quarter as part of our registration fee we pay $5. One dollar of this
is set aside to pay off the student body debt and interest on the same which
has to be met. 1 do not think anybody will begrudge that money. Tt is true that
we did not ourselves incur the debt, but as Stanford men and women, we
take up the burden of past years in the same spirit as we would have enjoyed a
surplus if conditions had been different. That dollar to my mind is a contribution
of the present Stanford generation showing that it has the fighting spirit and
had missed the opportunity to be up in that branch of knowledge.
Two dollars goes for student body tickets which entitle the holders to
admittance to practically all contests in which Stanford men participate. The
money from this source is used to pay the coaches, to keep up the athletic fields
and to meet incidental expenses lnctnred in all branches, such as visiting teams'
expenses, purchase of equipment, etc.
Ihe remaining two dollars is used to pay the running expenses of the
gymnasium, which include the expenses of the various officials. The University
here does pay the medical director and the head of the gymnasium, which are
the exceptions I have been able to discover. University credit is given for
subjects taken under these men who arc paid by the students and the hours go
toward graduation. It is on the same basis in that way as the economic, law
or any other department, and I can see no valid reason why the University should
not treat it as such.
Under the present law in California, physical instructors will be needed
throughout the state. The time is surely coming when every high school of
any size will have a physical director. We want to be in a position to fill that
need, and the only way we can do so is to have physical education as a
separate department in which all students would have an opportunity to enroll.
