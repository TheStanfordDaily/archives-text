MRS. STANFORD AS A BUSINESS
WOMAN
As trustee of the immense Stanford
fortune Mrs. Stanford won the repu
tation of being the foremost business
woman in America of her day. "She
knows what she wants and sees that
she gets it," said the San Francisco
Examiner. She did not save the money
for herself, but for the University.
Her sole purpose was to get the en
dowment properties in a condition to
yield the largest possible returns.
Senator Stanford owned three big
ranches, <lie Gridley property, compris
ing some 14,000 acres of choice wheat
land, the Palo Alto estate and the Vina
ranch. Of the three the Vina ranch
in Butte county was the most famous.
With the Senator's death it became
necessary to reduce expenses and to
make the property productive. Hith
erto Vina had been a show place, con
ducted more as a city park than as a
farm. The Senator was kind-hearted
and disliked to discharge men from
his service, and consequently he kept
gathering and increasing his forces
about him. He never tried to market
his famous brandy, because be wished
to store it until it became rich with
age. Immense quantities were dis
tilled at the Vina ranch. At the time
of his deatli the cellars contained
something like $500,000 worth of
brandy. Mrs. Stanford had this put

on the market when it had a ready
sale. Other expenses were cut down
on the ranch. Of the 70,000 acres all
but about 20,000 acres were used for
grazing land. Most of that land was'
utilized and made to be productive.
Mrs. Stanford took over direct man
agement of the 6,000 sheep and hun
dreds of dairy cattle of Vina and of
4,000 acres of vines which yielded as
much as 1,700,000 gallons of wine in
one season.
It.was said that nothing escaped
Mrs. Stanford's notice during her first
visit. She walked into the blacksmith
shop and finding about seventy-five
"horses being shod, inquired of the me
chanics on whose authority they were
acting. Then she ordered the shoes
taken off and the horses turned into
pasture. Over 150 men were dismissed
at this time and all the salaries cut.
It was natural that these improve
ments did not meet with approval at
Vina. But the reforms inaugurated
had direct results.
Everything possible was put upon a
financial basis. The liot-houses, vege
table gardens, grounds and orchards
of the Palo Alto estate were leased to
the long-trusted Chinese foreman,
Jun Mok Toey You. At the same time
100 other Chinese employed by Sen
ator Stanford were discharged.
Last Monday the Vina ranch was
sold by the trustees and passed from
under the Stanford name after a lone
period of years.
