"Mr. Orabcoin. I've saved up $3,000
and I want t6 marry your daughter."
"Do you realize that $3,000 won't
last long nowadays?"
"Oh .yes, sir. But. it ought to take
care of us for at least six months and
at the end of that time if I haven't
convinced you that I am an ideal son
in-law you needn't do a thing for ns."
