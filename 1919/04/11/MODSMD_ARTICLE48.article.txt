# Removal of Restraint Essential
## 
### M.L. Samis, '20 
ONE of the most serious questions
for old students returning to Stan
ford to decide is the issue of student
body control. They are now being call
ed upon by President Wilbur to deter
mine whether the student body is to
be self-governing, or whether faculty
control shall continue.
In considering the question one natur
ally asks why student control was done
away with. Of course we know that
the principal immediate cause was the
lack of a sufficient number of upper
classmen due to the war. But student
body control was standing on wobbly
legs long before we went to war. Its
abolition had been pending foi some
time.
It is natural to assume, therefore that
the faculty will not look with approval
on any proposal which will bring a re
turn of the old system. I lut governing
student affairs is a distasteful job to any
faculty man. Playing "detective" doesn't
tend to elevate him in the eyes of the
students, nor in the university commun
ity as a whole. Members of the faculty
are often heard to remark that they
would never serve on any student af
fairs committee. It is plain that the
faculty would welcome any system that
gave promise of success.
I believe that student body control fail
led because the students did not feel that
they had real control, and that any sys
tem will fail unless students are made
1 fully responsible to themselves for their
conduct.
I he office of student adviser should
be dropped. The main trouble of the
old system was that students never felt
responsible for their conduct to their
own governing body. If they broke
university rules they were "slipping one
over" on the student adviser, or possibly
the chairman of the student affairs
committee. The student adviser was re
garded as a detective from the presi
dent's office. With a few notable ex
ceptions, his influence as an adviser
among the students was nil. The term
"student adviser" was a misnomer. He
took away the feeling of responsibility
that should be felt by the student dis
ciplinary body. The failure of the sys
tem was largely due to the psychological
effect of the presence of the student ad
viser.
The removal of the student adviser
would enable the president to deal di
rectly with the elected representatives
of the students, and this would undoubt
edly be a more satisfactory method.
