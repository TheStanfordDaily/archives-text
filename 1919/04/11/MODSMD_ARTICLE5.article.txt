# BASEBALL FIGHT TO TAKE PLACE MONDAY BETWEEN 1921-1922
## 
### 
Freshmen and sophomores will clash 1
Monday afternoon at 4:30 in their an-!
nual baseball fight.. In accordance ]
with precedence, as soon as the Sophs!
are ahead, the game will be broken \
up and the fight will be on. The scrim
mage proper will center around the j
Zeta Psi house, where Captain Jim
Galloway will be awaiting the return
of the marked ball.
New rules for the fight were made
recently by a combination conference
between the executive heads of the
respective classes in conjunction with
Captain Galloway and Dean McDowell.}
No sophomores will be allowed inside j
the fraternity house and fighting will j
thus be restricted to the outside and
the porches. Because of the necessity j
for practice for both varsity and fresh-,
man baseball teams, the members ol' j
both who are eligible to play in the]
game will be immune from capture!
until after Sunday afternoon practice, j
As soon as that is over, however, hos- :
tilities may begin.
Because of tbe lawlessness exhibited !
in the fight last year, any member of
either class who does any damage or
seals a machine or does anything of
the sort will have to pay all bills of
damage himself, for his class will re
fuse to assume the responsibility and
will repudiate all debts made in this
way. The ball must tic handed to Cap
tain Galloway by midnight Monday or
the fight will he called a draw. This
is rather unlikely, however, in the
light of jiast baseball fights.
Moth classes have appointed com
mittees to make arrangements for the
fight and because of these pre-ar
rangements a high type of class organ
isation may be expected from both
freshmen and sophomores. The
bleachers will be optn to the public
and everybody is invited to attend the
game.
