# DAILY PALO ALTO MERIT SYSTEM SERVES TO ELIMINATE POLITICS
## 
### A.W. Leeds, '20 
"inside workings" of the Daily Palo Alto seem to he shrouded in
1 mystery to the majority of the student body, and the idea is more or less
prevalent that to get to the top of the staff of that journal a course of under
ground staff politics is necessary, As a matter of fact, the system rests on
merit as nearly as can be worked out consistent with the frailties of human
nature.
The aspirant for the staff of the Daily appears during a tryout period,
and is assigned a "beat" by the editor which he covers for the rest of the period.
!: is usually small and. when there are many tryoutees, often duplicated. At the
end of a tryout period the editor-in-chief, with the advice of the managing
;.nd news editors, selects those of the tryoutees who have done the best work
for positions on the staff. In thus making out the list of new members, writing
ability, energy in reporting, accuracy, faithfulness in covering assignments, and
personality ( are the chief factors considered. Those making the staff are given
larger beats and are ranked according to the ability they display. The grading
is by classes usually, and the reporter who leads his class on the staff is
regarded as the most prominent aspirant for journalistic honors. From time to
lime the ranking of the staff is changed as the individuals 011 it display more
or less ability than their rivals.
After a year or more of service 011 the staff, those showing the most
ability are made assistant news editors and are given the experience of assisting
the news editors in their work of reading copy, assigning stories and heads,
and so forth. When a vacancy occurs in the news editors' positions (there arc
normally five news editors, one for each day the paper comes out) tryouts are
In id trotn among the assistant news editors for the promotion.
The news editors are usually juniors and sophomores; from their number
thc incoming editor selects the managing editor, whose duties under the system
of the Daily Palo Alto are principally confined to supervising the makeup of
the paper in the composing room. The editor selects and ranks the news editors,
and the managing editor is ordinarily the ranking news editor of the previous
1 ditorial term.
Under the student body constitution adopted in May, 1918, the editor-in-chief
of the Daily Talo Alto is elected by the staff, and under that system three elec
tions have already been held. The purpose of this change was to take the
Daily out of politics and to insure the selection of an editor 011 a basis of
journalistic ability rather than popularity or group affiliations, which to some
extent had been the tendency under the system of election by the student body
a? a whole. The election is held by secret ballot, and without nominations.
Ordinarily, and following precedent, the managing editor will be selected by
the staff, but this rule is by no means rigid, and the staff is free to use its
discretion in regard to elections. A method of weighed voting is in force in
these staff elections, the news editors and those who have been on the staff for
some time having more votes than the journalistic freshmen.
It will be seen that in the matter of assignments and promotions the power
01 the editor is very great; and if he wishes to play favorites or politics there
is every opportunity for him to do so. While the editors of the Daily have
been only human, and it is impossible to deny that there has been a certain
amount of politics on the Daily staff, the writer feels that in this respect the
Daily will compare favorably with any organization on the campus. There have
been, at least within the past three years, 110 glaring instances where personal
lather than journalistic qualifications have been the determining factor in im
portant matters. Also, as during three years of service on the staff, six editors
will have passed on any individual, there is little chance of permanent injustice
being done. The opinion and influence of the other members of the staff would
also act as a restraining influence upon any editor who wishes to play politics.
To eliminate politics is the biggest problem for any college publication,
as well as for other college activities. In this respect the Daily Palo Alto may
claim to have been more than usually fortunate.

Under the student body constitution adopted in May, 1918, the editor-in-chief
of the Daily Talo Alto is elected by the staff, and under that system three elec
tions have already been held. The purpose of this change was to take the
Daily out of politics and to insure the selection of an editor 011 a basis of
journalistic ability rather than popularity or group affiliations, which to some
extent had been the tendency under the system of election by the student body
a? a whole. The election is held by secret ballot, and without nominations.
Ordinarily, and following precedent, the managing editor will be selected by
the staff, but this rule is by no means rigid, and the staff is free to use its
discretion in regard to elections. A method of weighed voting is in force in
these staff elections, the news editors and those who have been on the staff for
some time having more votes than the journalistic freshmen.
It will be seen that in the matter of assignments and promotions the power
01 the editor is very great; and if he wishes to play favorites or politics there
is every opportunity for him to do so. While the editors of the Daily have
been only human, and it is impossible to deny that there has been a certain
amount of politics on the Daily staff, the writer feels that in this respect the
Daily will compare favorably with any organization on the campus. There have
been, at least within the past three years, 110 glaring instances where personal
lather than journalistic qualifications have been the determining factor in im
portant matters. Also, as during three years of service on the staff, six editors
will have passed on any individual, there is little chance of permanent injustice
being done. The opinion and influence of the other members of the staff would
also act as a restraining influence upon any editor who wishes to play politics.
To eliminate politics is the biggest problem for any college publication,
as well as for other college activities. In this respect the Daily Palo Alto may
claim to have been more than usually fortunate.
