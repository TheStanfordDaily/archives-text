## 
### 
By Earl Crawe, '21.
COACH Carl Zamlock of the Cali
fornia Bears has been teaching Russ
Ellison, his big pitcher, a few new
tricks, according to reports from the
Berkeley diamond. Ellison has been de
veloping a new curve ball which is said
Lo be better than the one he had last
season. The big [flue and Gold hurler
is pitching a high class brand of baseball
this year, and Zamlock is counting upon
him to start the California-Stanford
scries.
Zamlock lias George Murchio, slow
curve artist to start in the second game
of the scries. Murchio is a good pitcher,
has lots of control and works the cor
ners. A couple of second rate twirlers
till out the California pitching staff.
Dexter, the veteran backstop, is a de
pendable receiver and is able to hold El
lison's fast balls in good style. He is
one of the best hitters on the club and
possesses a good arm. Ellsworthy is
the second string catcher. He has work
ed in several of the games this season
and is to be a good catcher.
In the infield, California has good men
at third and first base. Lais, at third,
lias been playing a strong game all seas
on and White, who pitched on last year's
freshman team, is playing short stop.
White is a good fielder but only a fair
sticker. Cantv at first base has shown

up well with the bat.
Tn the outfield, Meyers is the star
performer. He has played a good deal
of baseball and grabs fly balls anywhere
in center field. He is said to be the best
hitter on the team. Champion in left
field is a good hitter, but does not ap
proach Meyers in the fielding side *of
the game.
1 he California coach iias a team uf
good hitters and a strong battery, but
the way the Stanford hitters pounded
the St. Mary's pitcher on Wednesday
would seem to indicate they have found
their batting eyes and will be in the run
ning for hitting honors in the series.
Coach Evan's team annexed more runs
from the St. Mary's team than the Cal
ifornia players did in'their game with
the Catholic boys, but the Cardinals al
lowed more runs to cross the plate than
the Berkeley team did. However, one
game is not sufficient to make any sort
of a comparison between the strength of
the rival teams.
Newland and Pelouze are showing
better form every day. Both men pitch
ed good ball in the.St. Mary's game. Pe
louze holding the opposing hitters in the
pinches.
Stewart played better in the St. Mary's
game than he has worked all season. Hi
held the pitchers up, hit and threw to
bases well. He may work in the series
if he keeps up this standard.

the second string catcher. He has work
ed in several of the games this season
and is to be a good catcher.
In the infield, California has good men
at third and first base. Lais, at third,

freshman team, is playing short stop.
White is a good fielder but only a fair
sticker. Cantv at first base has shown

up well with the bat.
Tn the outfield, Meyers is the star
performer. He has played a good deal
of baseball and grabs fly balls anywhere

hitter on the team. Champion in left
field is a good hitter, but does not ap
proach Meyers in the fielding side *of
the game.

By Earl Crawe, '21.
COACH Carl Zamlock of the Cali
fornia Bears has been teaching Russ
Ellison, his big pitcher, a few new
tricks, according to reports from the
Berkeley diamond. Ellison has been de
veloping a new curve ball which is said
Lo be better than the one he had last
season. The big [flue and Gold hurler
is pitching a high class brand of baseball
this year, and Zamlock is counting upon
him to start the California-Stanford
scries.
Zamlock lias George Murchio, slow
curve artist to start in the second game
of the scries. Murchio is a good pitcher,
has lots of control and works the cor
ners. A couple of second rate twirlers
till out the California pitching staff.
Dexter, the veteran backstop, is a de
pendable receiver and is able to hold El
lison's fast balls in good style. He is
one of the best hitters on the club and
possesses a good arm. Ellsworthy is
the second string catcher. He has work
ed in several of the games this season
and is to be a good catcher.
