# LAKE CARNIVAL A CUSTOM

greatest privilege that can befall a college generation
' s the establishment of some new and beneficial custom.
/**|K JSTAJBr The present generation of students at Stanford has this
J opportunity exceptionally offered. To overlook such an opportunity
is overlooking much in college life of the present and of the future.
It would be nothing short of neglecting such an opportunity to fail to make
the Lake Carnival an annual affair at Stanford.
The Carnival cannot be regarded in any other light than as a success. Con
sidering the minimum of expense and even of individual effort involved, the
proceeds certainly merit its continuation and even perpetuation in Stanford life.
In determining whether the Carnival should become an institution of Stanford,
let us see for a moment what was derived from the Carnival as held this year
iMid its predecessor of the year before.
Monetarily the Carnival was a success; under more extensive management
and more comprehensive plans, the Carnival of the future, and we hope there
will be a Carnival of the future, will be still more of a financial success. But
from another standpoint the Lake Carnival netted proceeds; it cannot be doubted
but what an event of this kind, bringing with it a certain characteristic spirit, is
a big asset to the college life of the University.
Everything that tends to bring the people of the I niversity togethi 1
prompted by any one common spirit is a decided benefit to the University. It is
this common spirit in any event that ultimately develops a Stanford spirit. In
this respect, then, the Carnival most certainly netted proceeds.
Let us not fail to make this event an annual one; let us not overlook the
opportunity of perpetuating something that will improve and develop the spirit
of Stanford. There is no reason why the Lake Carnival should not annually
rank with Junior Week, Senior Week and other typical Stanford events. In
f;i.ct, there is no reason why the Lake Carnival should not ultimately outrank
these class affairs, since the Carnival is one distinctly appealing to all classes
in the studenty body. The Carnival has twice proved its success, and each time
in two distinct ways, viz: as a financial success and as a spirit generator. Let us
make tradition. Let us create the Lake Carnival as a custom.
