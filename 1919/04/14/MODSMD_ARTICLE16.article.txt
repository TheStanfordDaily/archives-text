# STANFORD DEFEATS PACIFIC BASKETERS
## 
### 
In a game which was characterized
by excellent team work and fast pass
ing, the Stanford women's basketball
team defeated the College of the Pa
cific sextet, on the local court Satur
day morning by a score of 21 to 16.
At the end of the first half, the San
Jose team was in the lead by the nar
row margin of 11-9. but Stanford came
through with some well planned plays
in the second half, and secured the
game.
Considering the fact that the team
had only one practice together, and
that on the day preceding the game,
and that this was the first game of
the season. the teamwork dis
played by the Stanfordites was more
than worth mention. Henrietta Hoe
ver, '22, at side center, and Marie
Hutton, '21, at guard, were especially
clever. A much larger score could
easily have been piled up had it not
been for the exceptionally strong
guards, which the College of the Pa
cific had with them. Very few fouls
were made by either side, and conse
quently the game was fast and
snappy.
The referee for the first half was
Fanny Knox, '18
A return game is hoped for in the
near future. The Stanford line-up
follows: Forwards, Myra Waterman,
'21, and Irene Bonnett, '10; guards,
Captain Nellie Shultz, '19, and Marie
Hutton. '21; touch center, Isabel
Craig, '22; side center, Henrietta
Hoever, '22.
