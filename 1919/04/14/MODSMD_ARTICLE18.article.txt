# THRIFT STAMP DRIVE TO BE NEXT THURSDAY
## 
### 
Under the direction of the Women's
Service Board and Professor W. A.
Cooper, considerable enthusiasm
should be aroused for the thrift stamp
campaign which will be launched on
Thursday. The Faculty Club has en
tered into the plans for a successful
drive by promising a prize to the liv
ing group on the campus who, in pro
portion to the number in the group,
buys the largest amount of stamps.
Tables will be placed on Quad which
will be presided over by the women
on the Junior Service Board.
Representatives have been appoint
ed in every house to explain and pro
mote the drive. Since the signing of
the armistice, communities have had
to face the problem of the lack of
interest of a large percentage of the
people. To arouse a new interest in
the obligations which this nation still
has to meet financially, the United
States government has asked that a
thrift stamp drive be carried on in all
parts of the country ,and the commit
tee in charge feels confident that
Stanford will do her share in this
work.
In giving money to this campaign
a loan is made to the government
which will be redeemed in five years.
In other words, it is a small edition of
the Liberty Bond. The government is
promoting this campaign to promul
gate thrift among the less wealthy
communities as well as to aid in the
meeting of financial obligations.
