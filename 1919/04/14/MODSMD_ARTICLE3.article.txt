# Rivals Prepare for Bloody Game
## 
### 
Spurred on by the accusations of the
Daily Palo Alto, the track captain, the
student manager, the president of the
student body, and a guilty conscience,
the 1922 class apparently is out for
blood. At the moment of writing, how
ever, little blood has been spilt. Today
the fracas and combat is probably the
quietest day in the whole year from its
early afternoon appearances.
The object of a baseball light was un
doubtedly to join the sophomores and
freshmen in combat of some kind; this
juncture lias very carefully been avoided,
however, and until the toss of the hasc
ball gives the signal for the fray, all
apparently is doomed to quiet. Visions
of 1918, 1919 and 1920! Great and
glorious classes, when the spirit of en
gagement was a real and vital factor in
the baseball Fight.
What a contrast! Formerly machines
roamed the campus looking for mem
bers of the opposition; trucks and Fords
vied with each other for supremacy.
Now we arc told that the Freshmen are
out for blood; apparently so ,but ap
parently the only way they can get it is
to have it mailed to them in a test tube.
The two classes haven't mixed in the
preliminaries sufficiently for any dust
to be displaced.
