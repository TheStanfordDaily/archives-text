## Varsity, Second Crew and Frosh to Race at Redwood Campus Invited 
### 
! Xcxt Sunday lias been set as the datel
1 for the throwing of the crew courses]
open to visitors. At that time there will
be niih and half mile races, among- the
lirSt and second varsity and freshman
j shells. The course selected .along the
j Redwood Estuary is known to the crew
men as the half mile mile straight away
along the salt beds. This is the only
straight way course that is visible from
the beach.
Distance has prevented the general
public from taking much interest in
the crew workouts in the past years.
Captain Watts is urging all the campus
to take their Sunday afternoon ride out
to die Estuary instead of going into the
mountains. Next Sunday's practice will
be changed from morning to afternoon,
in order to put on this exhibition. Some
of the "Dollar Fords" of Palo Alto have
already been chartered, to take some
of the queeners to the course. Extra
coxswains will be on hand to explain
the different points of the races to the
visitors.
Yesterday morning's workout was
probably the most successful of the sea
son thus far, and with the gradual im
provement that the shells are showing,
three winners arc certain. Coach "Lcs"
Rogers is making every possible effort
to polish .tip the eights to perfection,
so that Stanford can take all three
races. The varsity will row a three
mile course on the Oakland Estuary, on
the morning of May 3. against the Uni
versities of California and Washington.
The second varsity and freshman shells
will row a two mile course.
Rix Maurer, old varsity stroke and
one time all American stroke, and
"Raldv" Greene, varsity man. have.re
viewed the boats during the past week.
"Husky" Guerrcna, for several years
the crew coach, is to be on hand over
the next week end, to help out in the
putting on of the final touches.

! Xcxt Sunday lias been set as the datel
1 for the throwing of the crew courses]
open to visitors. At that time there will
be niih and half mile races, among- the
lirSt and second varsity and freshman
j shells. The course selected .along the
j Redwood Estuary is known to the crew
men as the half mile mile straight away
along the salt beds. This is the only
straight way course that is visible from
the beach.
Distance has prevented the general
public from taking much interest in
the crew workouts in the past years.
Captain Watts is urging all the campus
to take their Sunday afternoon ride out
to die Estuary instead of going into the
mountains. Next Sunday's practice will
be changed from morning to afternoon,
in order to put on this exhibition. Some
of the "Dollar Fords" of Palo Alto have
already been chartered, to take some
of the queeners to the course. Extra
coxswains will be on hand to explain
the different points of the races to the
visitors.
Yesterday morning's workout was
probably the most successful of the sea
son thus far, and with the gradual im
provement that the shells are showing,
three winners arc certain. Coach "Lcs"
