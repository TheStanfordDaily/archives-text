# TWO CARDINAL NINES WIN
## Varsity Defeats Winged "O" 4-3 
### 
From their showing against the
Olympic Club last Saturday the var
sity nine has a combination that can
play baseball. The game went into
extra innings, and Stanford, meeting
a fast team, won because the Cardinal
played baseball. Pelouze in the box
l'or nine innings, held the visitors
down 3 to 1 until the first part of the
ninth nining, when the Olympics tied
the score on an error and two hits.
Then in the last part of the tenth,
a single, a stolen base, a sacrifice, and
another single by Captain Jim Gal
loway, put the game on ice.
A feature of the game that prom
ises well for the California series was
the pitching of Pelouze. While he
was in the box the Olympic Club
made but two earned runs, and live
hits. Pelouze was pitching with his
head as well as with his arm. and
when there were not errors behind
him stood the visitors down in good
shape.
Lilly Hits Homer
Lilly with his home run, and
Caughey with his single and three
bagger, were the feature players for
Stanford. It will be a big help in the
California series to feel that Lilly is
getting back to his old form. And
the fact that Coach Evans has uncov
ered in Caughey a man who has bat
ted seven hundred in the last three
games argues well for some hits
to win from the Blue and Gold.
Caiiforniu beat Santa Clara lust Sat
urday, 2 to 1.the Red and White men
getting but two hits off the delivery
of Ellison. Santa Clara has a strong
team ,and this game is an indication
that Stanford will have some battle
to win fro mthe Blue and Gold.

From their showing against the
Olympic Club last Saturday the var
sity nine has a combination that can
play baseball. The game went into
extra innings, and Stanford, meeting
a fast team, won because the Cardinal
played baseball. Pelouze in the box
l'or nine innings, held the visitors
down 3 to 1 until the first part of the
ninth nining, when the Olympics tied
the score on an error and two hits.
Then in the last part of the tenth,
a single, a stolen base, a sacrifice, and
another single by Captain Jim Gal
loway, put the game on ice.
A feature of the game that prom
ises well for the California series was
the pitching of Pelouze. While he
was in the box the Olympic Club
made but two earned runs, and live
hits. Pelouze was pitching with his
head as well as with his arm. and
when there were not errors behind
him stood the visitors down in good
shape.
Lilly Hits Homer
Lilly with his home run, and
Caughey with his single and three
bagger, were the feature players for
Stanford. It will be a big help in the
California series to feel that Lilly is
getting back to his old form. And
the fact that Coach Evans has uncov
ered in Caughey a man who has bat
ted seven hundred in the last three
games argues well for some hits
to win from the Blue and Gold.
Caiiforniu beat Santa Clara lust Sat
urday, 2 to 1.the Red and White men
getting but two hits off the delivery
of Ellison. Santa Clara has a strong
team ,and this game is an indication
that Stanford will have some battle
to win fro mthe Blue and Gold.
