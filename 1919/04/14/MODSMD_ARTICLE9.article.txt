# Cardinal "Babes" Defeat U.C. Nine
## 
### 
The Stanford freshman ball players
walloped t heir California rivals last
Saturday afternoon to a hard fought for
score of 3 to 2 on the Cardinal diamond.
The game proved spectacular through
out, being featured by a double play by
Ronsolot to Gomez in the eighth inning
and two base hits by Rouselot of the
locals and Mcllenry and Hutton of the
Blue and Gold frosh.
In the eighth there were three men
on bases and by the featured double piny
let th '22 men in for the game. A swift
throw to home in the ninth made the
score for the Stanford babes.
Coach Cass used one of the best
possible lineups for the first of the
freshmen scries with California. The
babes, having lost several games to high
schools on the peninsula, seem to have
niven them the necessary batting prac
tice that was badly needed. Rouselot.
Wallace and Stevenson brought up their
batting averages in last Saturday's game.
In Shiblet and Shanburger, Coach Cass
used two of his best horsehide heavers,
both pitching a good brand of ball.
Coach Cass will probably use the same
lineup for the next game of the series
with the California frosh on Saturday
afternoon.
