### 
I.eland Pickering, '20, was chosen by
flie Junior Opera Committee for the
director of tlie 1920 show, has been
called east very suddenly and expects
to leave this week. His departure is
deeply regretted by all members of the
committee, who feel that he had the in
terest of the Junior class at heart, and
had lie continued in trie capacity of
coach would have produced a very fin
ished and successful Opera. For the
work that he lias already done as chair-
I man of the committee, in choosing the
cast, and giving valuable suggestions as
to the structure of the plot, the remain
ing members of the Junior Opera Coni
j mittee wish to extend to him their
thanks in behalf of the Junior Class.
Gordan A. Davis, '17, who has just
recently returned to the campus, has
(agreed to accept the directorship of the
Opera, and there is every reason to be
j lieve that under his supervision the 1921!
show will not suffer any for the loss of
Mr. Pickering. Those who have seen
Mr. Davis in the lead of Justice two
years ago, have some idea of his un
usual dramatic ability, Gordan is like
vise the author of many one-act plays
in vaudeville, and has taken part in sev
eral stock ilu'rftt icals in San Francisco.
He is a member of Sword and Sandals,
and lives at thÂ»* Alpha Delta house, on
the campus.
