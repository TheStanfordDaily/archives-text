# POLICE FOR THIEVES

### 
the increasing number of complaints of articles lost,
Â»JkjF' <#> strayed or stolen from the neighborhood of the lake
they used to be. It has long been a cherished boast of Stanford
or campus comes the added realization that things are not what
men and women that twenty dollar gold pieces were as safe on the Quad as
in fish-hooked lined pockets. It seems decidedly out of keeping with the
spirit of reawakened Stanford to find articles disappearing when a person
negligently turns his hack on his property.
Unfortunately this is the state of affairs upon the campus. The losses
at the Carnival the other evening must from all accounts have been sufficient
to equip a full-sized concession. Everything from electric torches to ten
dollar bills and borrowed tables cloths seem to have disappeared.
It would undoubtedly be a great injustice to even accuse any Stanford
man or woman of theft, since thieves are not tolerated at Stanford. It is
not an injustice, however, to assert that theft by others should not be per
mitted to get by on the campus and its environs, and it would not get by if
the proper means were taken to prevent it. Realizing that theft in the neigh
borhood of the campus exists should be but the preliminary step towards the
elimination of theft and its ultimate prevention. There is a campus fire de
partment that helps to eliminate fires, and it has always been the assump
tion that there were campus watchmen and others to prevent careless and
intentional thieving.
Galling as it is to the pride of the University that theft has taken place
in the neighborhood of the University, still there is no reason why steps
should not be taken to eliminate it. Painful as it might be to see the star
of the law in the neighborhood of all large crowds and places of entertain
ment and amusement, unfortunately that is less painful than the actual loss
that occasions the call for help from the law.
