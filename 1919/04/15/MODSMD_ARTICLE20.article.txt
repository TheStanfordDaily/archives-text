# LISNER'S ORCHESTRA TO FEATURE WOMEN'S CLUB DANCE FRIDAY
## 
### 
If present arrangements are carried
out. the Women's Club House benefit
dance next Friday night will be one
ot' the biggest informals of the quar
ter. Xo effort of the committee in
charge is being spared to make every
feature of this dance attractive.
Louis Lissner's orchestra will fur
nish syncopation for theoccasion and
several special attractions are prom
ised. A closed date has been secured
for Friday night and that fact alone
should assure an exceptionally large
attendance.
All the proceeds from the dance
will go toward the $7,000 debt which
the Club House Association still owes.
N'o effort was made during the war to
decrease this debt, only the interest
being kept up. A large attendance
Friday night will give the campaign
to pay off the debt a successful start.
An admission of $1.10 a couple will
be charged. According to present
plans the dance will last till 1 o'clock
and will be held in the clubhouse.
