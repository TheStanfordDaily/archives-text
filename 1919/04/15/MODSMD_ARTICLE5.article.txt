After a meeting of the student man

was decided that a tennis tournament be
held on the morning of April 26, the
varsities at the California courts and

Five varsity matches, three singles and
two doubles, will be played. The num

changed to five, instead of three, as was*
formerly the case.
The return of 1). N. Barry, Jr., '20,
who was captain of the varsity last year,
