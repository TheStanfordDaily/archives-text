# Class of '21 Wins Baseball Fight
## "Mel" Doyle Hands Ball to Captain Galloway After Hard Fight 
### 
Making a quick change! the base
ball fight last night was switched
from the old Zete house, where it was
originally planned to have it, to the
visitors' pit on the baseball field. Fol
lowing up their victory in last year's
fight, the class of '21 was again vic
torious. "Mel" Doyle was able to slip
the bail through the "barb-wire" de
fences to Captain Galloway after
twenty minutes of hard fighting.
Following the preliminary skirmish
ing. that started in immediately after
the freshmen finished their game with
the Bear cubs last. Saturday, the two
classes had their teams on the base
ball field yesterday afternoon at 4:30
sharp. At 4:15 the freshman team ap
peared on the field in a large bus that
they had chartered. Before and after
the bus were several autos filled with
freshmen that were there to "do or
die."
The game lasted two innings, when
Galloway threw the ball in the air.
The ball rolled into the hands of one
of the players on the '22 t'eam, and,
as he had not been informed of t lie
plan of attack, he threw it to one of
the '21 men.
On a relay of motor cycles the soph
omores carried the ball into Palo Alto
by a roundabout route and there it was
kept until late last night, when it was
brought out to the campus.
Using a battering ram, the sopho
mores rushed the barricade erected
by the freshmen and eventually forced
their way to Galloway. The freshmen
fought well, but they were outnum
bered two to one.
