# BIG ASSEMBLY HEARS WILL IRWIN, '99, ON WAR PHASES
## HAS LARGE AUDIENCE Declares League of Nations Essential to Prevent Future Wars 
### 
Will Irwin, '99, discussed the League
of Nations, its purpose and its possi
bilities this morning before one of the
largest assemblies ever held at the Uni-
I
versity. Dr. Jordan's more or less
humorous introduction of Mr. Irwin as
"one of the most distinguished, the
sanest and the cleverest newspaper cor
respondents of America" adequately
paved the way for the enthusiastic re
ception which the audience accorded
Mr. Irwin.
The first point which Mr. Irwin
emphasized about the peace conference
was the great amount of unfortunate
information which had been sent to this
country by correspondents who have
gone to Europe with the deliberate in
tention to embarrass and break Presi
dent Wilson. Correspondents had no
background for the great European con
flict and consequently press reports have
suffered.
The one dominant desire in Europe
today, according to Mr. Irwin, is to
prevent such a disaster from being re
peated again. Millions have died and
these millions can not have died in vain.
When this idea was dominating all
Europe, President Wilson appeared with
a feasible plan and, as a natural result
the peoples of Europe have centered
their hopes in him. The older parties
in politics arc prejudiced against the
league because they know that their
very existence is at stake. Such theories
as the balance of power and spheres of
influence have been the excuse upon
which the nobility have carried out their
creed of war, and the time has now
come when these systems must pass.
Mr. Irwin discussed the form which
modern warfare lias taken and what pos
sibilities the next war will offer in hor
ror and the annihilation of the human
race. Unquestionably, the world will not
be able to stand such a conflict as has
been promised for civilization by science
and invention. "This war," said Mr.
Irwin, "will be just a game of tiddle-dc
winks if we have another. The Ameri
can mind is run 011 a single track, but
it runs pretty straight, and we are try
ing to put this thing through. This
plan is just about the most worthwhile
thing that has ever been started in the
world, and if we don't back this, we're
not Americans, we're quitters. The
League of Nations is a hope and rt is
going through if it is not wrecked in the
United States Senate, and it won't be
wrecked if the people of this country
back it."
Mr. Irwin concluded his discussion by
an appreciation of the national charac
teristics of the Alliesâ€”England, France,
and Italy. He accentuated the courtesy
of the French at all times and told one
or two pathetic stories of the valor and
gratitude of those "professional pessi
mists".
The English are beloved by the Amer
ican because they hide their sentimental
ity and kindly natures under an assumed
gruffness just because they are shy.
The journalist told of the unsual valor
of a British staff officer directing traffic
under lire who, when awarded the Vic
tory Cross, was' too shy to go and
claim it.
In speaking of Italy, Mr. Irwin said.
"The Italian campaign in the Alps was
tin' only romantic thing in the war.
< Hherwise the war for me was just
about as romantic as a hot day in the
Chicago stockyards. I lie Italians are a
wonderful and a coming people living
under one of the worst governments in
Europe. They are essentially demo
cratic. and there have been more evi
dences of genius in Italy than in all j
the rest of Europe put together. Ihe
Italians have a collective geniifs and an
instinct which is always curiously rii>lit.
