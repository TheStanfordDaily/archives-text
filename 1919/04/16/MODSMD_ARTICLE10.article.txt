# BABES READY FOR BRUIN CUBS
## 
### 
In an effort to even up the games
with San Jose, the freshman baseball
team will meet the high school boys
on the home diamond tonight. The
babes, fresh from their victory over
the Bruin cubs, stand a good show of
carrying off this last practice game
before the second game of the Cali
fornia series.
The freshmen seem to have lost
their jinx that has followed them
through most of the season and are
hitting and fielding the ball better
than is the custom of most freshman
teams. The San Jose men have a fast
team and are out to carry away the
game, but the babes seem to have
found their stride and are playing to
win.
Coach Cass is very optimistic over
the chances of winning the next game
with wearers of the Blue and Gold.
"We will beat 'em by a score of 10-1,
if the boys play their best game," he
said yesterday. Cass expects to put
the same team on the field for the
second game of the series that won
from the Bears last Saturday. The
only probable switch, barring acci

dents, will be the substitution of
Davies for Gomez at second. The
change will depend largely on the
style of ball that Davies plays against
San Jose tonight.
The coach has not picked the
pitcher for the California game as yet.
Cass is planning to use all four of his
men in the box against the San Jore
boys tonight. Shamberger, who
pitched the first seven innings of the
game last Saturday, will start to
night's fracas; Sibley, who pulled the
game out of the fire in the eighth, will
have a chance; and Neer and Mangin
will get an opportunity to show what
I they have up their sleeves. The man
who makes the best showing tonight
is the one that is likely to start
against California next Saturday.
Tonight's game will be the last one
that will be played before the babes
meet the Bear cubs in their own den
across the bay. The team will line up
tonight as follows: Stevenson, cf.;
Wallace, 3b; Spires, rf.; Holmes, If.;
Davies, 2b; ltousselot, ss.; Holston.
c.; Hawkes, lb; Shamberger, Sibley,
Neer, and Mangin, p.
