though J. J. Posner and W. M. Qreen
of last year's trio are expected to

speak. Posner is noted for his smooth
speaking, and Green for his hammer
ing qualities.
McClintock is banking on the diver

win the big medal. He attrbiutes to
H. G. IJlote, '18, qualities of good an
alysis and logical presentations. G.
J, Knight, '18, is credited with lluent

which he sometimes uses to great ad
vantage.
The general question this year is
"The future colonial policy of France,",
from which Professor O'Neil of the
University of Wisconsin will choose a
spccial proposition upon which the
debaters will argue.
