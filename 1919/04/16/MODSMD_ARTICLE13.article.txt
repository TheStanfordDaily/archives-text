# AUDITORIUMS AND CROWDS
## 
### 
the Will Irwin Assembly this morning had been especially
planned as a boost for the Stanford Memorial, it could not
have dove-tailed better with discussion of the Memorial
than the event unintentionally did. In extending the hand of wel
come to one of Stanford's most distinguished alumni, and certainly
one of Stanford's best-liked alumni, the crowd that turned out in interest for
the occasion and welcome for the guest unknowingly was boosting for one
big feature in plans for the Memorial. The packed auditorium, with the use
less side-area and the out-of-earshot rear balcony, was a real appeal for an
auditorium of size and capacity when the time for Memorial construction
comes.
Will Irwin undoubtedly talked to the largest crowd that has been in the
auditorium for an Assembly in many months, but the crowd was only typical
of what may be expected when the privilege of hearing and seeing big men
is afforded. To spoil an event of this importance through lack of capacity
for students detained late in classes and who therefore failed to beat their
Palo Alto neighbors to the downstairs seats certainly is something that
should not be tolerated when the means to rectify is at hand.
And this means most certainly is at hand. The announcement of the
start of the drive for funds for Memorial Hall was made in these columns last
evening. The minimum set by the committees is a quarter of a million dol
lars. This money should be raised and to help raise it undoubtedly will be
the effort of every Stanford man and woman. But in assisting in the big
task of the campaign, the definite assurance that there is to be a Memorial
Auditorium of size and capacity suitable to present and future needs of Stan
ford students is an essential.
We need an auditorium of such dimensions; what could be greater trib
ute to the men and women in service than filled tiers of benches listening to
ftt'ure speakers who will likewise be serving? We are preparing for the big
drive that is to surpass anything that has taken place on the campus within
the memory of recent generations; at the same time, we should prepare upon
the basis that the drive will ultimately bring Stanford something serviceable
in its tribute to service. We should prepare for the campaign with the as
surance of the Committee of Fifty that an auditorium of size and capacity to
meet our present and future needs will be provided in the Memorial Hall
through the generosity of the subscribers and the plans of the originators.
