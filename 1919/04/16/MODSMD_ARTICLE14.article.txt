# SIX HUNDRED CATTLE ARRIVE FROM RANCH
## 
### 
Nearly 600 head of cattle from the old
Vina ranch have arrived in 19 special
cars at the Palo Alto Stock Farm as
the result of the resent sale of the
famous Stanford ranch.
This ranch was the last of the three
big ranches established by Senator Stan
ford in other parts of the state, and
comprised at the time of the sale about
40,000 acres. The first wine grape vine
yard in California was started here, but
in recent years the ranch has been used

for cattle, sheep, grain, alfalfa and prune
raising.
The Palo Alto Stock Farm is planning
to specialize in the breeding and dairy
interests, bringing the farm to a pre
eminence for fine cattle. Aside from the
Shorthorns, several other breeds of cat
tle. Percheron horses and high grade
hogs arc being raised, all of which have
attained high standing among fanciers.
The farm now includes 4600 acres, and
on it are kept about 900 head of cattle.
