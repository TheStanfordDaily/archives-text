Over thirty men of the University
interested in organizing a new band at
Stanford met yesterday with Captain

to be secured as soon as a suitable
musician can be found. Sergeant Miller,
who lead the band during the S. A. T. C.
period, has been called away.

evident on the campus regretting the
lack of a really good band to represent
Stanford at the coming track meet and
crew races with the University of Cali

a university organization. N. J. Nathan

a leader is obtained.

work.
