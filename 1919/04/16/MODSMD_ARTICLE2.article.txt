## 
### 
Garbed in various species of night
attire, accompanied by a bombard
ment of torpedoes and pistol shots,
200 Encina revelers broke loose and
celebrated the annual pajama peerade
last night. Starting from the hall at
8:30 precisely, with night-caps fixed,
horns, whistles, and fireworks, the
peeraders started quietly for the
Quad, where pandemonium reigned
for several minutes in front of the
library. The line then proceeded to
Roble Hall, where the fair sex was
greeted with much enthusiasm.
The next place visited was the
Kingscote Apartments, where Coach
Evans was loudly cheered, and across
the way at the Zete House Captain
"Jim" Galloway, of the baseball team,
received a big ovation. The peerade
continued up the row, serpentining
among the sororities and fraternities
to the tune of a hundred whistles and
horns.
After cheering Captain Watts of
the crew at the Theta Xi House, the
peeraders swung around into Salva
tierra and after running through
Greene's and "Stickey's," proceeded
homeward.
