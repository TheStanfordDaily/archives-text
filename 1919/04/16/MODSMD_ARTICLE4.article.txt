# Bears Have Bad Slump In Batting Before Big Game
## 
### 
Coach Zamlock's Bears are in a hit
ting slump at present, according to
reports from the Berkeley diamond,
lie has made various shifts in his line
up in order to increase his offensive
power, but still the Blue and Gold
men are not connecting as good as
they were at the first of the season.
Zamlock intended to shift Ells
worthy, the second string catcher, to
the outfield on account of his ability
to hammer out safeties, but Ells
worthy forestalled this move by slid
ing into second a little too hard and
spraining his ankle enough to prob
ably keep him out of the series. An
derson, the second-sacker, is in the
hospital nursing a sore head, but he
will be able to start Saturday.
Claude Rowher, the California hard
hitting infielder, is ineligible on ac
count of having played his quota of
years on the varsity; so Zamlock will

be minus his services in the big se
ries. From the way the Berkeley team
has been lining up in the last few
games, Dexter will open the series
behind the bat, Ellison will pitch,
Morrissey will play first, Anderson
second, Lais on third and White at
shortstop. Champion Myers and But
ler will probably hold down outfield
berths.
Coach "Bob" Evans will either start
Newlaiul or Pelouze in the box against
the Bears Saturday. Stewart or
Bundy will catch, Tcubner will play
first, Kallam second, Stevens on third,
Galloway on shortstop, and Pike, Lilly,
and Caughey in the outfield. The
Stanford varsity is playing a great de
fensive game, and the hitting seems
to improve with every game.
The varsity played the Oakland
Technical High School nine this even
ing in a practice game.
