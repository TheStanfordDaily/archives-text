# CREW RACE PLANS ARE MADE
## 
### 
Final arrangements for the clash on
tlie water with the Universities of Cal
ifornia and Washington, at the Oak
land estuary on May 3, have been
made. The regatta is to be in the
morning of the big track meet be
tween Stanford and U. C.
Coach "Les" Rogers looked over the
course last Saturday, and it is prob
able that the race will be up stream,
in order to assure smoother water.
There will be three races. The varsi
ties will row over a three-mile course,
while the freshman eights and second
varsities will cover a two-mile s,tretch.
The Stanford training table will
open the first of next week at the
Theta Xi house, and will continue to
eat there until the day before the
lace. The Stanford crews will go

up to Berkeley on May 2, and remain
overnight at the Chi Phi house.
Rogers will probably name the men
to sit in the different boats, when
they are assigned to the training
table. He wants to wait a few days
before naming the different oarsmen,
on account of the close competition
between several of the seats in the
varsity boat.
According to all reports, the Cali
fornia crow is working out in fine
shape. Their training table has been
in operation for the past few weeks.
Every morning they are required to
take a several mile run. Coach Wal
lis, the Bruin coach, as usual, is feel
ing confident of victory. Tilton, row
ing oar number six, is the only old
varsity man that California has in its
boat this year.
