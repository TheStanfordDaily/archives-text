# TICKETS FOR JUNIOR PROM TO BE SOLD ON MONDAY
## LIMIT IS 130 TICKETS Unique Method of Finding Partner on the Floor to Be Introduced 
### 
I ickcts for the Junior Prom go on
sale next Monday morning at 8 o'clock,
according to the announcement of the
committee today. Only 130 tickets will
be sold, and after these are gone no
more will be obtainable. The programs
have alr'eady been ordered from the
East and will be obtainable a week be
fore the dance.
The Prom will be held at Encina
Gym, on Friday, May 9, which will be
an open date. Festivities will last from
9:00 to 1:00. There will be sixteen
dances, the music being furnished by a
nine-piece orchestra brought down from
San Francisco for the occasion.
As it is a full-dress affair, flowers and
taxies will not be in "tabou", and it is
hoped that the Prom will be more than
a revival of the Junior Proms of former
years. Nothing is being spared by the
junior class to make this dance a suc
cess in every way. In spite of the fact
that the Prom is costing nearly twice
the usual sum, only 130 tickets will be
sold, thus doing away with any possible
chance of crowding the big Encina gym
floor.
Tickets for the dance will be on sale
at the Campus Bookstore, at the usual
price of $5. The committee states ab
solutely that when the tickets are gone
no more will be sold under any condi
tions, and their advice is to buy early.
In order to facilitate couples finding
each other between dances, a new idea
will be in use. Spaces between the
upright girders on the sides of the gym
will be transformed into booths, eacli
of which will be named after some
sororiety house. One other booth will
be called Roble, while the cactus gar
den. the lake and the women's boat
bouse will be represented by booths.
Over tlie top of each booth will be the
name, and by arranging previously ;it
which booth they will meet, couples can
avoid much of the usual confusion.
Spaces have been provided on the pro
grams for setting down the place of
meeting. Thus when a njan is exchang
ing dances, in addition to writing down
the name, he should write down the
place of meeting. By this arrangement
and by having but sixteen dances .in
stead of eighteen, it is hoped that all
confusion in finding partners can be
avoided.
