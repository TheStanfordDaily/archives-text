EASTER
and
New Clothes
Last Easter was a martial Easter. Brass buttons and
braid, khaki and blue were all the go. But this year
styles have changed. A new type of clothes for the
new type of men. Renewed by the events of the war,
American men require clothes to set off their vigor and
their ambitions—clothes brisk and buoyant in design
—styles with vim and go and punch.
THE HOUSE OF
KUPPENHEIMER
has created such clothes for the men of this community
—clothes that interpret the times, "ace-high" in de
pendability and accuracy of fit; fabrics that have life;
smart patterns and color tones. The kind of clothes
that will fully satisfy your careful regard for your ap
pearance at Easter or any time. Values equally sat
isfying.
