# CREW EXHIBITION RACES OPEN TO PUBLIC SUNDAY
## 
### 
EVERYONE will have an opportunity to look over and become better ac
quainted with the Stanford crew next Sunday afternoon, at the exhibition
crew races between the different Cardinal boats. Machines will be able to
drive clear up to the edge of the bay, where the races are to take place,
along the half-mile straiglit-away near the salt beds.
The numbers or positions of the oarsmen, the duties of each man, the
orders of the coxswain, and many other things about the shells that are not
generally familliar to the average college man or woman, will be fully ex
plained by the extra coxswains on the beach.
This will be the only chance to see the three crews in action before the

big regatta on the Oakland estuary-
Mile and half-mile races are being ar
ranged for the Sunday exhibition by
Coach "Les" Rogers. All are urged
to take their Sunday afternoon .trip
down to the estuary at Redwood, to
give the crew men all the encour
agement possible.
The men in the different boats next
Sunday will probably row in the same
positions that they will work in on
the 3d of May. The training table will
start on the following day, and the
following two weeks the men will be
taken through the most intensive
training by Coach Rogers.
Captain Watts and Roy King have
their seats in the varsity shell
cinched. King is rowing stroke, while
Watts is rowing oar number seven.
These are the only old varsity crew
men in the boat, but the remainder
of the men out rowed in their fresh
man year, but were unable to row
last year on account of there being
no crew.
When King returned from war the
crew outlook brightened considerably,
but. with the return of "Jimmy" Mont
gomery, coxswain of the 11)19 fresh
man crew, the outlook is still brighter.
"Don" Robbins and "Fred" Shipp,
however, are doing excellent work as
coxswains, and Montgomery is far
from having his position cinched.
McGillivray, Moore, Adams, Davis,
Williamson and Wilbur are the other
men that have been working out in
(he varsity boat during the greater
part of the last week. There are sev
eral men that have been showing up
extra well with the second varsity,
and it will not be possible to name
the first boat correctly until the final
announcement is made by Coach
Rogers, within the next few days.
"Husky" Guerena is to help coach
the men over the week-end, with the
hopes of getting the shells in perfect
running order for the final two weeks
of practice. This will assure the
crowd ol' a well-run series of exhibi
tion races next Sunday afternoon at
Redwood.

crowd ol' a well-run series of exhibi
tion races next Sunday afternoon at
Redwood.
EVERYONE will have an opportunity to look over and become better ac
quainted with the Stanford crew next Sunday afternoon, at the exhibition
crew races between the different Cardinal boats. Machines will be able to
drive clear up to the edge of the bay, where the races are to take place,
along the half-mile straiglit-away near the salt beds.
The numbers or positions of the oarsmen, the duties of each man, the
orders of the coxswain, and many other things about the shells that are not
generally familliar to the average college man or woman, will be fully ex
plained by the extra coxswains on the beach.
This will be the only chance to see the three crews in action before the

big regatta on the Oakland estuary-
Mile and half-mile races are being ar
ranged for the Sunday exhibition by
Coach "Les" Rogers. All are urged
to take their Sunday afternoon .trip
down to the estuary at Redwood, to
give the crew men all the encour
agement possible.
The men in the different boats next
Sunday will probably row in the same
positions that they will work in on
the 3d of May. The training table will
start on the following day, and the
following two weeks the men will be
taken through the most intensive
training by Coach Rogers.
Captain Watts and Roy King have
their seats in the varsity shell
cinched. King is rowing stroke, while
Watts is rowing oar number seven.
These are the only old varsity crew
men in the boat, but the remainder
of the men out rowed in their fresh
man year, but were unable to row
last year on account of there being
no crew.
When King returned from war the
crew outlook brightened considerably,
but. with the return of "Jimmy" Mont
gomery, coxswain of the 11)19 fresh
man crew, the outlook is still brighter.
"Don" Robbins and "Fred" Shipp,
however, are doing excellent work as
coxswains, and Montgomery is far
from having his position cinched.
McGillivray, Moore, Adams, Davis,
Williamson and Wilbur are the other
men that have been working out in
(he varsity boat during the greater
part of the last week. There are sev
eral men that have been showing up
extra well with the second varsity,
and it will not be possible to name
the first boat correctly until the final
announcement is made by Coach
Rogers, within the next few days.
"Husky" Guerena is to help coach
the men over the week-end, with the
hopes of getting the shells in perfect
running order for the final two weeks
of practice. This will assure the
crowd ol' a well-run series of exhibi
tion races next Sunday afternoon at
Redwood.
