# BRUIN AND CARDINAL VARSITIES MIX ON SATURDAY
## BATTING AVERAGES HIGH Ellison, Pitcher for U.C., Said to Be Throwing New Speed Ball 
### 
SATURDAY California and Stanford
meet in the first game of the 1919
baseball series. At present the dope
points to the Blue and Gold as having
the edge over the Cardinal, but the
Varsity has been coming up steadily in
later games and may slip a surprise
over Berkeley.
I his quarter the team has hit for an
average of .262. Caughey, with a hit
every trip to the plate but once, far out
strips the team with a batting average
of .875. One of the big problems in
the series is whether Caughey can make
safeties as regularly as he has since he
has been playing on the team. He has
made hits with consistency against such
pitchers as Ifollis, Bliss, Medcraft,
Valencia and Cartwright, but whether
lie can hit the fast ball delivered up
by Ellison is another question. New
lands, hitting in but two contests, is bat
ting .500; Bundy in the same two games,
.400. Lilly has played through every
game and is hitting a consistent .312.
Following are the complete batting
averages of the men who may start
against the Blue and Gold:
Caughey, .875; Newlands, .500; Bundy,
.400; Lilly, .312; Kallum, .200; Pelouze,
.200; Pike, .111; Teubner, .100; Kline,
.000: Crowe, .000; Parker, .000.
Batting averages give little indication
of the ability to hit against California,
however, for there is no doubt that such
men as Stevens, Galloway, and Lilly will
be able to find safeties.
