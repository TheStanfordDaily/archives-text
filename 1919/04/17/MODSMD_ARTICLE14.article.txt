# 1922 Team Meets San Jose on Diamond in Last Practice Game
## 
### 
Hard hitting on the side of the San
Jose high school defeated the fresh
man baseball to the tune of 6-0 in the
game yesterday. Thirteen hits were
scored off of Shamberger and Neer in
the first four innings, while Judson,
pitching for San Jose, held the babes
to one hit. After the fourth inning the
babes tightened up and played something
approaching respectable ball, and were
able to hold the high school boys but
could not gather the necessary num
ber of hits needed to push a run across
the plate.
In the seventh inning Gomez was hit
in the mouth by a ball and will be out
of the game for the rest of the season.
This accident will give Davies a chance
to get into the California game on next
Saturday. As Davies has been running
Gomez a close race for the position on
the keystone sack, the loss of Gomez
will not be felt as heavily as it might
have been.
Shamberger started last night's game,
hut was knocked out of the box in the
second inning. Neer, who went in as
relief, did not do much better and gave
way to Mangin, who was able to hold
the high school hoys. Judson pitched
a good game for San Jose, allowing
otdv three hits.
