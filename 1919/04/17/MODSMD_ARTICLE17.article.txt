f roni the fertile brain of the originator to fertile soil ot the
bone yard is another not to be disputed verity. ,0 ° common
to us, even at Stanford, to doubt the fact that a mass of
suggestions never even see the daylight, being smothered at birth.
Happily, very many brilliant and even plausible ideas originate in the
fertile brains that gather for mutual effort around the Student Council table.
Unfortunately, however, some of these possible and even useful ideas are
smothered at birth through objection at the start, or through the medium of
the ever-handy "committees." When time presses, and time is apt to press
on spring Tuesday nights, the best apparent solution of many of these ideas,
so troublesome in their possibilities of argument (and argument takes time),
is appoinment of some committee of investigation.
Committees are useful if they can accomplish something that the larger
body as a whole cannot accomplish. But a body of nine thinking members
is certainly not large enough to be subdivided constantly into those numer
ous committees. Committees are further useful if they ever report upon the
subject under investigation. Otherwise they are useful as a medium solely
of preventing troublesome arguments on nice Tuesday evenings.
Let us take one particular subject that has apparently been side-tracked
somewhere in the maze of committees. The subject of awarding the vaisity
"S" to the basketball team came up recently for discussion. There has been
much conflict of opinion as to whether basketball men should be awarded
the "S" for one California game, for two games, or for playing the majority
of the games of the league season, irrespective of the big series. This ques
tion was decided one way last year, and another way this year, leaving the
status of the block letter in one of our major sports still in dispute. The
same trouble is bound to occur in football, now that Stanford is to play moi e
than one big rival. In answer to what was to be done in this matter, a pos
sible argument was foreseen and even attempted; the usual committee is
probably now sleeping somewhere upon the subject.
This is only one of those questions that is dying from old age somewhere
in some committee's hands. The status of the block letter should be defi
nitely determined; the status of Rugby should be definitely settled. The
methods of the Student Council should be conducive towards the solution of
problems rather than the death from old age of all ideas connected with them.
