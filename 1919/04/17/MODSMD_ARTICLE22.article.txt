# MIKE GIBBONS TO BOX AT ENCINA GYM TOMORROW
## IS WORLD'S CHAMPION George Green and Six Other Olympic Club Boxers to Appear Also 
### 
MIKE GIBBONS, for six years the
middleweight champion of the
world and at present holding that title,
will give an exhibition at the Encina
gym tomorrow night. In addition,
George Green of the Olympic Club with
six of the best boxers from that organi
zation will also appear here on tomor
row's ring program.
Gibbons's last official bout was with
"I'acky" McFarland in New York City,
where he fought before the best house
ever drawn by a championship fight. The
purse at this match, which amounted to
$15,(XX). was the largest ever put up for
a ten-round bout.
During the war the champion has
been acting as an instructor at Camp
Grant. This is his first trip to the
coast since being- discharged, and he
will make only one professional ap
pearance while here, when lie will meet
Soldier Bartfield, who is a strong con-
I tender for the championship. After this
match Gibbons leaves at once for the
east, where lie has numerous engage
ments.
Gibbons will bring his own sparring
partner with him tomorrow, and ac
cording to Coach Murphy will present
one of the exhibitions such as Stanford
fans have not had a chance of witnessing
for a long time.
George Green is boxing instructor at
the Olympic Club, and he will bring
six competent men who will put on
matches between themselves. These
lighters arc also well qualified and are
expected to give an exhibition of first
class.
The tournament tomorrow evening
begins at eight o'clock, and will be free
of charge to campus enthusiasts. The
authorities are staging these bouts for
the reason that the Stanford-California
match is to be held across the bay this
year, and outside of the possible fresh
man matches, May 2, there will be no
opportunity for Stanford fans to see a
bout of real class. For this reason the
exhibition with Gibbons as the star has
bee nscheduled .
