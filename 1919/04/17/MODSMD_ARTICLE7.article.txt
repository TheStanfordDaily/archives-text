# WILL IRWIN TELLS ENCINA MEN OF EARLY DAYS
## "WINE STORY" FEATURE Speaker Also Discusses Politics in Foreign Countries 
### 
Will Irwin, '99, discussed both changes
and progress in "New Europe" and
anecdotes of Stanford history of the
nineteenth century at a meeting with
his "brothers" at Encina Club last night.
One of the most enjoyed of his ac
counts was the "wine story". This epi
sode occurred when ex-President Har
rison occupied ground rooms in Encina,
when he was giving a course in inter
national law here. President Harrison
lived very well, and had a quantity of
fine wines stored in the Hall. One night
the wines disappeared. Considerable
discussion was at once evolved and there
was talk of Senator Stanford's closing
the University. Finally after much agi
tation and apology the affair was con
sidered closed, and a new store of wine
was secured from the city.
But two weeks later this quantity was
also found missing. More discussion
and sentiment than ever was developed.
Then a well known student, whom Irwin
did not choose to name, was approached
because of his high standing and moral
qualities, to take charge of the affair
and secure, if possible, a satisfactory
settlement. A great meeting was held
in the hall, at which high resolutions and
universal condemnations were passed
unanimously. A collection was taken
to defray the cost of the stolen wine.
I lien the well known student, the leader
of the meeting spoke, saying: "Gentle
men, I know that you are all worried,
depressed, and worn out with the labors
of the evening * * * and if you will
all step up into the 'bull pen' we will all
have a little refreshment."
Irwin also described the life of a
former Stanford student at Harvard,
who was known there as a "Big West
erner with all the characteristics im
plied with that name. This man first
gained distinction when asked in a law
class for a proposed action in a case
where a gentleman lost at sea for eight
years returned to claim a wife, who in
the meantime had married another man.
The westerner suggesed that if the judge
was fixed, and the jury bribed, he would
prove the returned man a ghost in two
and a half minutes.
This supposed westerner capped the
climax by having a negro waiter at a
banquet expose a bad break in a Latin
inscription on one of Harvard's famous
monuments, "a foolish mistake where
any fool nigger would know better."
The war correspondent then took up a
consideration of the British labor prob
lem, showing that this is not at all
identified with bolslievism, which con
ceives of three strata of human society,
the upper two classes living far above
the average standard of comfortable ex
istence, while the lowest class compris
ing the majority of the people live in
poverty. I bis conception demands abso
lute destruction of all forms of exist
ing government and organization before
a new scheme fair to all may be estab
lished.
Irwin then explained how Lloyd
George "sprung" an election immediately
on the close of the war, when the en
thusiasm for the government which won
the war defeated the labor party. A
new and powerful labor organization
was soon built, however, which was
strong enough to force the government
to concede to its demands for shorter
bourse and higher wages in mining, rail
roads, and other industries.
As a result, the laboring men of Eng
land, no longer afraid that the govern
ment is going to "slip something over"
on them, and consequently, instead of
calling for decreased production, and
calling for industries to slow down, they
are crying for more production. This
seems to be the solution in England of
the labor problem which before the war
threatened seriously the whole economic
situation in England, according to Irwin.

thusiasm for the government which won
the war defeated the labor party. A
new and powerful labor organization
was soon built, however, which was
strong enough to force the government
to concede to its demands for shorter
bourse and higher wages in mining, rail
roads, and other industries.
As a result, the laboring men of Eng
land, no longer afraid that the govern
ment is going to "slip something over"
on them, and consequently, instead of
calling for decreased production, and
calling for industries to slow down, they
are crying for more production. This
seems to be the solution in England of
the labor problem which before the war
threatened seriously the whole economic
situation in England, according to Irwin.
Will Irwin, '99, discussed both changes
and progress in "New Europe" and
anecdotes of Stanford history of the
nineteenth century at a meeting with
his "brothers" at Encina Club last night.
One of the most enjoyed of his ac
counts was the "wine story". This epi
sode occurred when ex-President Har
rison occupied ground rooms in Encina,
when he was giving a course in inter
national law here. President Harrison
lived very well, and had a quantity of
fine wines stored in the Hall. One night
the wines disappeared. Considerable
discussion was at once evolved and there
was talk of Senator Stanford's closing
the University. Finally after much agi
tation and apology the affair was con
sidered closed, and a new store of wine
was secured from the city.
But two weeks later this quantity was
also found missing. More discussion
and sentiment than ever was developed.
Then a well known student, whom Irwin
did not choose to name, was approached
because of his high standing and moral
qualities, to take charge of the affair
and secure, if possible, a satisfactory
settlement. A great meeting was held
in the hall, at which high resolutions and
universal condemnations were passed
unanimously. A collection was taken
to defray the cost of the stolen wine.
I lien the well known student, the leader
of the meeting spoke, saying: "Gentle
men, I know that you are all worried,
depressed, and worn out with the labors
of the evening * * * and if you will
all step up into the 'bull pen' we will all
have a little refreshment."
Irwin also described the life of a
former Stanford student at Harvard,
who was known there as a "Big West
erner with all the characteristics im
plied with that name. This man first
gained distinction when asked in a law
class for a proposed action in a case
where a gentleman lost at sea for eight
years returned to claim a wife, who in
the meantime had married another man.
The westerner suggesed that if the judge
was fixed, and the jury bribed, he would
prove the returned man a ghost in two
and a half minutes.
This supposed westerner capped the
climax by having a negro waiter at a
banquet expose a bad break in a Latin
inscription on one of Harvard's famous
monuments, "a foolish mistake where
any fool nigger would know better."
The war correspondent then took up a
consideration of the British labor prob
lem, showing that this is not at all
identified with bolslievism, which con
ceives of three strata of human society,
the upper two classes living far above
the average standard of comfortable ex
istence, while the lowest class compris
ing the majority of the people live in
poverty. I bis conception demands abso
lute destruction of all forms of exist
ing government and organization before
a new scheme fair to all may be estab
lished.
Irwin then explained how Lloyd
George "sprung" an election immediately
on the close of the war, when the en
thusiasm for the government which won
the war defeated the labor party. A
