# WILL IRWIN TELLS ENCINA MEN OF EARLY DAYS
## "WINE STORY" FEATURE Speaker Also Discusses Politics in Foreign Countries 
### 
Will Irwin, '99, discussed both changes
and progress in "New Europe" and
anecdotes of Stanford history of the
nineteenth century at a meeting with
his "brothers" at Encina Club last night.
One of the most enjoyed of his ac
counts was the "wine story". This epi

rison occupied ground rooms in Encina,
when he was giving a course in inter
national law here. President Harrison
lived very well, and had a quantity of
fine wines stored in the Hall. One night

discussion was at once evolved and there
was talk of Senator Stanford's closing
the University. Finally after much agi

because of his high standing and moral
qualities, to take charge of the affair
and secure, if possible, a satisfactory
settlement. A great meeting was held
in the hall, at which high resolutions and
universal condemnations were passed
unanimously. A collection was taken
to defray the cost of the stolen wine.
I lien the well known student, the leader
of the meeting spoke, saying: "Gentle
men, I know that you are all worried,
depressed, and worn out with the labors
of the evening * * * and if you will
all step up into the 'bull pen' we will all
have a little refreshment."
Irwin also described the life of a
former Stanford student at Harvard,
who was known there as a "Big West
erner with all the characteristics im
plied with that name. This man first
gained distinction when asked in a law
class for a proposed action in a case
where a gentleman lost at sea for eight
years returned to claim a wife, who in
the meantime had married another man.
The westerner suggesed that if the judge
