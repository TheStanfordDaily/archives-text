## WADSWORTH IS AUTHOR OF CLEVER SONGS Rehearsal by Members of the Cast Has Shown Real Operatic Ability 
### 
THE music of the Junior Opera, as
has been the usual custom in the
past, will be pubilshed by the Junior
Opera Committee in book form, pro
viding the committee can have assur
ance of enough sales to warrant the
cost of publication. This means that
the members of the student body will
be expected to subscribe for one or
more copies at as early a date as possi
ble.
Seven "hit songs" of the play written
by Harry WadswOrth, '20, are to be com
bined in this book, which will also con
tain the names of the members of the
cast, and a program of the oprea. The
songs are destined to be one of the
most attarctive features of Abe 1920
show, for Mr. Wadsworth has evolved
some startlingly clever lines, and, in
combination with the different airs
which are entirely original and ex
tremely catchy, they are not likely to be
sonon forgotten on the Stanford campus.
"Kiss Song" a Favorite
"The Kiss Song," which the noted
singer, Madam Noe, complimented Mr.
Wadsworth 011, and which Mr. Belasco
considered to be one of his bests com
positions, will lie included in (the
collection, and should in itself be con
dusive of buying the book.
It is the plan of the Junior Opera
Committee to cooperate with the Junior
I Prom Committee, so that the opera
I mtttfc can lx.- played ;it the formal dance.
1 The committee feels assured 4.liat the
Stanford community will be delight
fully surprised with the seven song hits
of the Junior Opera, and urges that a
little old-time spirit be revived among
the students; so that one and all will
be eager to own the song book which is
to be published and on sale the night
of the show for $1 a copy.
Rehearsals are going on steadily with
the cast and members of the choruses.
Gordon Davis, 17, has taken the situa
tion in alind and is proving himself a
capable and efficient coach, so that there
is every reason to believe that the 1920
production will rival all previous Junior
Operas in both originality of plot and
dramatic ability displayed. Miss Jean
Long, '1.3, has prepared several new and
distinctive dances which are unlike any
heretofore combined with a Junior
()pera.
Originality is a characteristic of the
whole show, according tu those in
charge., who have seen the growth of
the plot and who are now convinced of
the future success of the Tunior Onera.

of the Junior Opera, and urges that a
little old-time spirit be revived among
the students; so that one and all will
be eager to own the song book which is
to be published and on sale the night
of the show for $1 a copy.
Rehearsals are going on steadily with
the cast and members of the choruses.
Gordon Davis, 17, has taken the situa

capable and efficient coach, so that there
is every reason to believe that the 1920
production will rival all previous Junior
Operas in both originality of plot and
dramatic ability displayed. Miss Jean
Long, '1.3, has prepared several new and
distinctive dances which are unlike any
heretofore combined with a Junior
()pera.
Originality is a characteristic of the
whole show, according tu those in
charge., who have seen the growth of
the plot and who are now convinced of
the future success of the Tunior Onera.
