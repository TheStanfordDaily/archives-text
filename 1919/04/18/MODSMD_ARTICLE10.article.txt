first game, and from the dope sheet
it appears that the outcome will de
pend on the breaks of the game.
Coach Zamlock's Blue and Gold
team worked out on the Cardinal dia
mond yesterday afternoon for about
two hours. The entire squad was pres
ent with the exception of Butler, right
fielder, and Murchio, the second string
pitcher. Claude Rowher, former cap
tain of the California team, was in
charge of the sqnad.
Bruin Infield Looks Weak
From the way the Berkeley men
worked out yesterday, Dexter, (he
skipper, will catch, Schmitz or Mor
rissey will play first base, Anderson
on second, either White or Murray on
short, and Lais on third. Champion,
Meyers and Butler will play in the
outfield. The California men went
through a stiff infield practice, and in
contrast to the Stanford infield they
looked decidedly weak. None of the
infielders is a finished ball player, and
they are all new men on the varsity.
Zamlock's combination does not. be
gin to compare with Evans' infield on I
the defensive side of the game, and j
from tne way they hit in batting prac- i
tice, the Cardinal infielders will out
hit their opponents.
The California outfield is a strong,
trio, both on the defensive and on the
offensive. Butler is a .300 stickman 1
and Champion and Meyers are rated
as dependable hitters. Both Cham
pion and Meyers hit the ball hard in
practice yesterday, and covered lots
of ground in the outfield practice.
Hack Dexter was throwing good in
practice, but the infielders seemed to
have trouble in handling his throws.
Detxer gets his throws off quick, but
he did not grab 011 to the low ones
like Bundy does. "Russ" Ellison
tossed a few over to the batters and
seemed to have his customary smoke
behind the ball.
Student Manager Ames has secured
Crother, an experienced umpire, to
officiate in tomorrow's contest. Croter
was recommended by President Baum
of the Coast League.
The game will start at 3 and the
admission will be 50 cents.
