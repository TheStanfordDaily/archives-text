The three Cardinal shells will make
their first, last and only public show
ing, before the big regatta, next Sun
day afternoon at 3:30 o'clock. Races
are being planned between the first
and second varsities and the fresh
man crews, along the bay straight
away, near the salt bed of Redwood
City. This is the first time a crew
has ever given any sort of a demon
stration to the University before the
race with California.
Captain Frank Watts is anxious to
have the men and women become ac
quainted with and to get behind the
different eights. It is , planned to
have extra coxswains along the beach
to explain the various points of the
boats, the men and their positions in
j tlie shells ,and what the orders of the
j coxswains mean.
The easiest way to the course will
! be to take the Middlefield road out
