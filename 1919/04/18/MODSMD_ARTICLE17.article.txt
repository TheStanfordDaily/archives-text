With the United States treasury confronted with completing a task be
gun when Pershing's veterans first left America, Stanford finds itself a part
of a great system that will during the next few weeks show that it cannot
and will not quit what it has thus far done.
The Liberty Loan Drive will test all in the big attempt to put it
over. There is but one standpoint to be taken 011 the drive and one state
ment that insures its success, "It cannot fail." Failure would mean repudia
tion by the American people financially at this late hour of what the Ameri
can people have successfully done thus far through their arms and dollars.
Stanford is an integral part of this system. Stanford has its quota and
this quota must be reached. Monday is the day the drive starts. Monday is
the day to prove that Stanford men and women are Americans and never quit.
