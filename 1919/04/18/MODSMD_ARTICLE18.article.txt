# SAY IT WITHOUT FLOWERS

statement by the Junior Prom committee of its plans
for the Junior Prom has undoubtedly created a degree
IfiJLjf of interest around the campus becoming to the announcement.
There is one element in the announcement of the committee that
cannot but be taken with a large grain of salt if not direct dissatisfaction.
Junior Proms have been Junior Promms for a considerable past number of
years without all those former artificial embellishments at one time deemed
essential to the success of any social affair, viz., flowers. !
Present ideas of social events are saner and less inclined towards the
unnecessary and overelaborate. With the realization that the campus belle
charmed sufficiently without the additional ornamentation of flowers from her
escort the practice of the preliminaries of flowers to an evening's engagement
was dispensed with several years ago, and wisely so.
We hope that the committee was not serious in Its announcement that
the custom of flowers would be attemptedly revived. We hope that they at
any rate will follow the wise custom of recent years and taboo flowers as
before. It is only by prohibiting them that embarrassment will be saved
those who do not want to, but feel that they ought to, give tjie flowers that
the committee hinted at.
It is not economy that prompts this editorial. It is an attempt to com
ply with a good custom established of recent years, putting all on the same
footing as much as possible. It is an effort to avoid rigid compliance with
a passe and useless custom. Say it with Liberty bonds and Memorial sub
scriptions is infinitely better social custom than by any attempt to speak
with flowers.
