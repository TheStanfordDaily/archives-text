# Progress on Quad Greatly Retarded
## Campus Organizations Fail to Take Space in Year Book Promptly 
### 
Progress in the publication of the 1920
Quad is being much retarded owing to
the fact that a large number of campus
organizations are either indifferent in
their attitude toward taking space in
tlie yearbook, or to their tardiness in
remitting for the space already taken
by the society or. groups in question, the
management stated today.
In accordance with the management's
statement of some time ago, the follow
ing organizations are announced as not
having satisfactorily concluded nego
tiations with the business management
of the 1920 book:
The Breakers, Juniperro Serra Club,
Foil and Mask, Camera Club, Economics
Club, Spanish Club, Electrical Engineer
ing Society, Stanford Band, Stanford
Music Club, Women's Mandolin Club,
Skull and Snakes, Press Club, Sword
and Sandals. Xu Sigma Xu, Plii Chi,
Sigma Delta Chi. Phi Delta Kappa.
Liana Chess Club, Women's Debating
Delta Sigma Rhn. Y. \V. C. A., La
Club.
Sixty societies, including thirty-seven
Greek letter societies, have paid for
Quad sections . The amounts due from
those who have not settled with the
management arc, for two pages, $20.00;
one page, $12.50; half page, $7.50.
The management wishes to state em
phatically that only a few more days
can be allowed for the closing of nego
tiations with the'sc groups and organiza
tions, and those who do not make some
definite decision in the near future will
not appear among the pages of the year
book. Any checks should be made pay
able to the 1 '>20 Quad and mailed at once
to the 1920 Ouad. Stanford University.
