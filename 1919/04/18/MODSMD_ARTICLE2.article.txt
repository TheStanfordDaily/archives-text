# Progress on Quad Greatly Retarded
## Campus Organizations Fail to Take Space in Year Book Promptly 
### 
Progress in the publication of the 1920
Quad is being much retarded owing to
the fact that a large number of campus
organizations are either indifferent in
their attitude toward taking space in
tlie yearbook, or to their tardiness in
remitting for the space already taken
by the society or. groups in question, the
management stated today.
In accordance with the management's
statement of some time ago, the follow
ing organizations are announced as not
having satisfactorily concluded nego
tiations with the business management
of the 1920 book:
The Breakers, Juniperro Serra Club,
Foil and Mask, Camera Club, Economics
Club, Spanish Club, Electrical Engineer
ing Society, Stanford Band, Stanford
Music Club, Women's Mandolin Club,
Skull and Snakes, Press Club, Sword
