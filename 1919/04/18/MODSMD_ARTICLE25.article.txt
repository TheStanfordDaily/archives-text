# Stanford and Palo Alto Complete Y.W.C.A. Drive
## 
### 
Stanford and Palo Alto share the
honor in being the first district to go
over the top in the matter of raising
funds for the Y. W. C. A. in the recent
campaign. Stanford returns are not
all in, but $300 of the $500 has been
collected. Palo Alto has responded
generously ,and the $2000 asked for
this, district has been assured.
A realization of the important peace
work reconstruction program, as apart
from the funds secured from the
United War Work drive, is the reason
attributed to this district as being
the first to go over the top. The cam
paign was in response to an appeal
by Secretary Lane to the Y. W. C. A.
to take charge of a peace program
for girls in rural and industrial dis
tricts. A committee of eleven, rep
resenting all the war work agencies
engaged in the European War, agreed
that no money collected in the War
Work drive can be used on recon
struction and peace programs.
