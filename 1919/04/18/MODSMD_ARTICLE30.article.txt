## DAILY PALO ALTO Council Ruling Causes Scarcity of Block "S's" 
### J.W. Bucklin, '20 
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, CALIFORNIA, FRIDAY, APRIL 18, 1919

DURING the w;ir many Stanford cus
toms had to be given up. Among
those things relinquished was the grant
ing of sweaters to winners of the varsity
S. However, now that Stanford is grad
ually drifting back to many of the good
things that it was deemed best to give
up for the period of the war, it seems
a good time to suggest that once more
the student body should grant varsity
sweaters to winners of the block S.
The granting of the mere privilege
to wear the S has distinctly proven a
failure. Tt means that in nine cases out
of ten the man is either unable to pur
chase the sweater or is negilgent in do
ing so. As a result, the old \ arsity S
sweaters are now getting to be a rare
sight indeed, and it is now only one
year since they were last granted. One
is tempted to think how much rarer they
will be if this mistake is indulged in for
a longer time.
The mere giving a man the privilege
to wear the S is and always will be,
more or less oaf nimmateriality, while
the conferring of sweaters is a very de
finite form of appreciation granted by the
student body to the man who has achiev
ed success in athletics. This sweater
has always been one of the most treas
ured of college honors. It speaks to its
owner of an ambition realized, of hard
work and of the giving of the best he
had for the Cardinal.
As in the past, the varsity sweater
will be a definite goal for which a Stan
ford man can strive, and when it is
reached the sweater will be the emblem
of victory, conferring on its owner a,
feeling of something definitely accom
plished.
Participation in athletics admittedly
takes sacrifices. It means that a student
must give up things. It includes hard
work as well as play, and it is but right
that there should be a reward. Even
now that spring is here the athlete must
still sacrifice. The average student feels
the spring fever in his bones and gently
breaks his Big Ben on the floor, turns
over and gloatingly goes to sleep, while
the athlete must get up and study that
he may have the time later in the day
to devote to practice. At best a sweater
cannot be a reward; it is but a small
sign of appreciation of the particular
student's efforts in behalf of his I uni
versity.
No Stanford man ever forgets his var
sity S sweater. Perhaps ten years after
graduation he comes across it—old and
worn —and even then the thrills of by
gone days return.
Tf the former custom >of granting
sweaters to winners of the S is not re
turned to, it is plain that ultimately
the varsity S will become only a mem
ory. Stop and think what this will mean
to Stanford; what it would mean to
any great University. Stanford is rep
resented in the mind of the average high
school student, by this very block S.
It is one of the distinctive parts of col
lege life, and is associated with every
healthy university just as a uniform is
regarded as part of the equipment of an
army. Future athletics needs the stimu
lation offered by a chance to win an S.
Let us not forget now that American
football has once more come into its
own. The big game will hereafter be a
reality, and the lack of funds which so
seriously hampered athletics during the
war will not be felt in the future. The
small expense that the granting of the
sweater will entail can now easily be
taken care of, as it could not before.
It is only fitting and just, therefore, to
return to winners of the varsity Sin the
future the privilege of wearing a token
provided by the student body in recog
nition of their athletic ability combined
with hard work.

that there should be a reward. Even
now that spring is here the athlete must
still sacrifice. The average student feels
the spring fever in his bones and gently
breaks his Big Ben on the floor, turns
over and gloatingly goes to sleep, while
the athlete must get up and study that
he may have the time later in the day
to devote to practice. At best a sweater
cannot be a reward; it is but a small
sign of appreciation of the particular
student's efforts in behalf of his I uni
versity.
No Stanford man ever forgets his var
sity S sweater. Perhaps ten years after
graduation he comes across it—old and
worn —and even then the thrills of by
gone days return.
Tf the former custom >of granting
sweaters to winners of the S is not re
turned to, it is plain that ultimately
the varsity S will become only a mem
ory. Stop and think what this will mean
to Stanford; what it would mean to
any great University. Stanford is rep
resented in the mind of the average high
school student, by this very block S.
It is one of the distinctive parts of col
lege life, and is associated with every
healthy university just as a uniform is
regarded as part of the equipment of an
army. Future athletics needs the stimu
lation offered by a chance to win an S.
Let us not forget now that American
football has once more come into its
own. The big game will hereafter be a
reality, and the lack of funds which so
seriously hampered athletics during the
war will not be felt in the future. The
small expense that the granting of the
sweater will entail can now easily be
taken care of, as it could not before.
It is only fitting and just, therefore, to
return to winners of the varsity Sin the
future the privilege of wearing a token
provided by the student body in recog
nition of their athletic ability combined
with hard work.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, CALIFORNIA, FRIDAY, APRIL 18, 1919

DURING the w;ir many Stanford cus
toms had to be given up. Among
those things relinquished was the grant
ing of sweaters to winners of the varsity
S. However, now that Stanford is grad
ually drifting back to many of the good
things that it was deemed best to give
up for the period of the war, it seems
a good time to suggest that once more
the student body should grant varsity
sweaters to winners of the block S.
The granting of the mere privilege
to wear the S has distinctly proven a
failure. Tt means that in nine cases out
of ten the man is either unable to pur
chase the sweater or is negilgent in do
ing so. As a result, the old \ arsity S
sweaters are now getting to be a rare
sight indeed, and it is now only one
year since they were last granted. One
is tempted to think how much rarer they
will be if this mistake is indulged in for
a longer time.
The mere giving a man the privilege
to wear the S is and always will be,
more or less oaf nimmateriality, while
the conferring of sweaters is a very de
finite form of appreciation granted by the
student body to the man who has achiev
ed success in athletics. This sweater
has always been one of the most treas
ured of college honors. It speaks to its
owner of an ambition realized, of hard
work and of the giving of the best he
had for the Cardinal.
As in the past, the varsity sweater
will be a definite goal for which a Stan
ford man can strive, and when it is
reached the sweater will be the emblem
of victory, conferring on its owner a,
feeling of something definitely accom
plished.
Participation in athletics admittedly
takes sacrifices. It means that a student
must give up things. It includes hard
work as well as play, and it is but right
that there should be a reward. Even
now that spring is here the athlete must
still sacrifice. The average student feels
the spring fever in his bones and gently
breaks his Big Ben on the floor, turns
