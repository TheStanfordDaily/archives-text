# Side Lights on Hospitals
## 
### Katherine Ames, '19 
HOSPITALS have their seasons just
as small boys have theirs. Instead
of baseball, marbles, or kites, sometimes
it is tonsilitis which is the prevailing fad
or rage—again it is appendicitis, but al
ways, with the Peninsula hospital—and
You can't mke a mistake about it. It is
spring in the air—poison oak is in vogue,
the most reliable, most plebian, most
overworked, and cheapest means of en
trance to that institution. While young
love buds, —poison oak blooms and the
hospital's wards are sure to be full of
itching, swollen, disfigured patients. It
as as regular as the foil moon and quite
often follows it.
Unlike scarlet fever or chicken pox, a
single severe dose of this ailment does
not leave one immune and graduated
to a new malady. On the contrary, like
gambling, you are apt to contract the
habit. • It spreads alarmingly, like Bol
shevism, and works havoc externally, in
ternally, eternally and infernally.
Now there is nothing dignified about
having poison oak. but having poison
oak or a tooth-ache in a hospital invests
it with a shade of respectability. There
is everything in the background. Doctors
seem to realize this and reward you, if
you prolong your hibernation from the
mocking world for a week or more, by
dignifying your case with a new and
beautiful name. You no longer suffer
with poison oak but are recovering from
a slight attack of "Vinsaxiginia" or some
such evil. You feel better but you sound
worse.
Next to the hospital "smell"—reeking
of doctors, antiseptics, rubber mats, de
pressing in its suggestion of millions of
murdered germs, the most characteristic
thing about a hospital is its food. Verily,
it is so painfully hygienic and nourish
ing that it is a bore to have to eat it.
Hospital meals may be a delight to some
methodical and systematic person, but
to the average human they are a curse.
They rob life—and hospital—of its mys
tery. After your first season you can
croon resignedly on Monday the menus
for every meal until the following Mon
day, unless you are lucky enough, to be
on a diet. But though all mystery is
gone, hope springs eternal and there
still remains the delightful possibility
that the cook may take a fleeting glance
at his calender, confuse his milk-toast
and corn-soup days, and upset calcula
tions for a week!
It is easy to get into a hospital—but
getting out again, aye, there's the rub.
I suspect sometimes that doctors and
hospital authorities have formed a coali
tion to prevent the escape of their vic
tims. Hospitals must be maintained—Q.
K. D. —patients must be detained. Until
the ranks are full again your chances
for immediate acquital are slim. Ihe
doctor smiles knowingly at your eternal
question and answers, tomorrow may
be!" You smile back more knowingly—
and a bit pathetically—for alas! you
have begun to realize when that tomor
row—may be!
