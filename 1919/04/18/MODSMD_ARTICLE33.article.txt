# FAILURE OF STUDENT CONTROL DUE TO STUDENTS' LACK OF INTEREST
## 
### E.R. Caughey, '18 
STUDENT control, when one first thinks of it, seems very simple. To the
minds of many all that has to be done is to turn the government of stu
dent affairs over to the students, let them organize a form of constitution
and run things to suit themselves. That is one of the reasons why affairs
on this campus today are in a chaotic state. Recent events have shown this
to be only too true. The students do not think seriously enough about the
question. We are here at this University to get knowledge from books, but
to gather other viewpoints as well, and unless a working majority can be
made to see that student control is a really big problem and a vital problem,
there is no use trying to initiate it, because those same men would fail to
support it after its initiation.
An ideal situation is easily conceivable is that of the students running
their own affairs, uninfluenced by the faculty, meting out punishment to those
who deserve it and seeing that those who deserve it get the punishment,
with the faculty standing back watching a group of chosen students call all
offenders before it, and regardless of any personal feelings or tie§, doing the
right thing. An ideal state of affairs always sounds good, but it is when it
is placed on a working basis that the difficulty arises and I wish to point out
some of the evils which have arisen in the past and which will have to be
avoided in the future.
Student control as first started here worked well for two or three years.
That was because there was a sufficient number of influential men who
started it to insure that all the provisions would be carried out, and especially
because there were several men who had the confidence of both the students
and the faculty. As soon as this college generation passed others appeared
who were not interested in student control as were its founders, but who
regarded their positions more as honorary ones, forgetting that they had a
duty to fulfill. It was not very long before a few students could get away
with anything short of murder and rest assured that they would have a de
fender on the Student Council. It is always easier to condone an offense in
a person whom you know. Now we can apply that to this whole campus,
because we are a big family and know each other in a general way and are
prone to forgive the acts which if done by a student in another university
would call for most severe punishment were we to try the case. For instance,
a man who is being tried for a crime is not tried by twelve of his best
friends; but that is in reality the situation we have to meet here which de
veloped after a few years of student control.
The faculty quickly saw the trend of affairs and Jost confidence in the
Student Council. Losing confidence, it did the logical thing—that is, stepped
in and began to tell the Student. Council just what it should do. I do not
say it did this openly, but any one who served on the council knows that it
amounted to that. Then the council rebelled and tried its very best to let
the guilty students off scot free, feeling that it was now an organization to
protect students from the faculty instead of punishing students when they

did wrong.
This brand of democracy and the lack of confidence both 011 the part of
the students and the faculty, is something that we must avoid, because as
the other attempt failed this certainly will do so if the same conditions arise.
Many people doubt the wisdom of ever attempting to bring back student
control and I am certainly opposed to the old method as it worked out. But
the lack of confidence between the students themselves and between the
faculty and students has Increased so much during the last few years that. I
am inclined to think that another try can at least do 110 harm. If I were 011
the faculty I certainly would want the students to govern themselves if they
possibly could. That would mean that the onerous task of getting evidence
and punishing offenders would be done away with. For instance, any nation,
our own, for example, is loath to take over foreign territory because such
rule is always misconstrued and the people in that territory always feel better
if their own people are running affairs. That is exactly the position here.
The faculty does not want the job of playing detective and we do not want
them to do it. As soon as the faculty is assured that we have a means by
which we can govern ourselves as we should be governed, then I feel that it
will be only too glad to turn over the reins. This means is what we are
striving for. Whatever system is tried out can only succeed with the back
ing of all the students. Such backing cannot be obtained until it is realized
that student control means more than just plain governing. But it goes to
the very foundation of our university, which is a co-ordination between all
of its branches.
1 have not laid down any personal views here as to what kind of a system
I think we should adopt, but have only written because I feel that the stu
dents as a whole do not understand the vital issues lying in the background
which are, as I see them: First, a lack of confidence exists which has re
sulted in a misunderstanding between students and faculty; second, that mis
understanding has spread until it involves the good name of the University
throughout the state; third, an efficient student control system will do much
to abolish the above-mentioned evils.

the guilty students off scot free, feeling that it was now an organization to
protect students from the faculty instead of punishing students when they

did wrong.
This brand of democracy and the lack of confidence both 011 the part of
the students and the faculty, is something that we must avoid, because as
the other attempt failed this certainly will do so if the same conditions arise.
Many people doubt the wisdom of ever attempting to bring back student
control and I am certainly opposed to the old method as it worked out. But
the lack of confidence between the students themselves and between the
faculty and students has Increased so much during the last few years that. I
am inclined to think that another try can at least do 110 harm. If I were 011
the faculty I certainly would want the students to govern themselves if they
possibly could. That would mean that the onerous task of getting evidence
and punishing offenders would be done away with. For instance, any nation,
our own, for example, is loath to take over foreign territory because such
rule is always misconstrued and the people in that territory always feel better
if their own people are running affairs. That is exactly the position here.
The faculty does not want the job of playing detective and we do not want
them to do it. As soon as the faculty is assured that we have a means by
which we can govern ourselves as we should be governed, then I feel that it
will be only too glad to turn over the reins. This means is what we are
striving for. Whatever system is tried out can only succeed with the back
ing of all the students. Such backing cannot be obtained until it is realized
that student control means more than just plain governing. But it goes to
the very foundation of our university, which is a co-ordination between all
of its branches.
1 have not laid down any personal views here as to what kind of a system
I think we should adopt, but have only written because I feel that the stu
dents as a whole do not understand the vital issues lying in the background
which are, as I see them: First, a lack of confidence exists which has re
sulted in a misunderstanding between students and faculty; second, that mis
understanding has spread until it involves the good name of the University
throughout the state; third, an efficient student control system will do much
to abolish the above-mentioned evils.
STUDENT control, when one first thinks of it, seems very simple. To the
minds of many all that has to be done is to turn the government of stu
dent affairs over to the students, let them organize a form of constitution
and run things to suit themselves. That is one of the reasons why affairs
on this campus today are in a chaotic state. Recent events have shown this
to be only too true. The students do not think seriously enough about the
question. We are here at this University to get knowledge from books, but
to gather other viewpoints as well, and unless a working majority can be
made to see that student control is a really big problem and a vital problem,
there is no use trying to initiate it, because those same men would fail to
support it after its initiation.
An ideal situation is easily conceivable is that of the students running
their own affairs, uninfluenced by the faculty, meting out punishment to those
who deserve it and seeing that those who deserve it get the punishment,
with the faculty standing back watching a group of chosen students call all
offenders before it, and regardless of any personal feelings or tie§, doing the
right thing. An ideal state of affairs always sounds good, but it is when it
is placed on a working basis that the difficulty arises and I wish to point out
some of the evils which have arisen in the past and which will have to be
avoided in the future.
Student control as first started here worked well for two or three years.
That was because there was a sufficient number of influential men who
started it to insure that all the provisions would be carried out, and especially
because there were several men who had the confidence of both the students
and the faculty. As soon as this college generation passed others appeared
who were not interested in student control as were its founders, but who
regarded their positions more as honorary ones, forgetting that they had a
duty to fulfill. It was not very long before a few students could get away
with anything short of murder and rest assured that they would have a de
fender on the Student Council. It is always easier to condone an offense in
a person whom you know. Now we can apply that to this whole campus,
because we are a big family and know each other in a general way and are
prone to forgive the acts which if done by a student in another university
would call for most severe punishment were we to try the case. For instance,
a man who is being tried for a crime is not tried by twelve of his best
friends; but that is in reality the situation we have to meet here which de
veloped after a few years of student control.
The faculty quickly saw the trend of affairs and Jost confidence in the
Student Council. Losing confidence, it did the logical thing—that is, stepped
in and began to tell the Student. Council just what it should do. I do not
say it did this openly, but any one who served on the council knows that it
amounted to that. Then the council rebelled and tried its very best to let
the guilty students off scot free, feeling that it was now an organization to
protect students from the faculty instead of punishing students when they
