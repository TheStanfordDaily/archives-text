# FAILURE OF STUDENT CONTROL DUE TO STUDENTS' LACK OF INTEREST
## 
### E.R. Caughey, '18 
STUDENT control, when one first thinks of it, seems very simple. To the
minds of many all that has to be done is to turn the government of stu
dent affairs over to the students, let them organize a form of constitution
and run things to suit themselves. That is one of the reasons why affairs
on this campus today are in a chaotic state. Recent events have shown this
to be only too true. The students do not think seriously enough about the
question. We are here at this University to get knowledge from books, but
to gather other viewpoints as well, and unless a working majority can be
made to see that student control is a really big problem and a vital problem,
there is no use trying to initiate it, because those same men would fail to
support it after its initiation.
An ideal situation is easily conceivable is that of the students running
their own affairs, uninfluenced by the faculty, meting out punishment to those
who deserve it and seeing that those who deserve it get the punishment,
with the faculty standing back watching a group of chosen students call all
offenders before it, and regardless of any personal feelings or tie§, doing the
right thing. An ideal state of affairs always sounds good, but it is when it
is placed on a working basis that the difficulty arises and I wish to point out
some of the evils which have arisen in the past and which will have to be
avoided in the future.
Student control as first started here worked well for two or three years.
That was because there was a sufficient number of influential men who
started it to insure that all the provisions would be carried out, and especially
because there were several men who had the confidence of both the students
and the faculty. As soon as this college generation passed others appeared
who were not interested in student control as were its founders, but who
regarded their positions more as honorary ones, forgetting that they had a
duty to fulfill. It was not very long before a few students could get away
with anything short of murder and rest assured that they would have a de
fender on the Student Council. It is always easier to condone an offense in
a person whom you know. Now we can apply that to this whole campus,
because we are a big family and know each other in a general way and are
prone to forgive the acts which if done by a student in another university
would call for most severe punishment were we to try the case. For instance,
a man who is being tried for a crime is not tried by twelve of his best
friends; but that is in reality the situation we have to meet here which de
veloped after a few years of student control.
The faculty quickly saw the trend of affairs and Jost confidence in the
Student Council. Losing confidence, it did the logical thing—that is, stepped
in and began to tell the Student. Council just what it should do. I do not
say it did this openly, but any one who served on the council knows that it
amounted to that. Then the council rebelled and tried its very best to let
the guilty students off scot free, feeling that it was now an organization to
protect students from the faculty instead of punishing students when they

did wrong.
