# An Informal Discussion by Will Irwin
## 
### Ellen M. Calhoun, '20 
CONSIDERING the fact that Will
Irwin's senior year was "encored,"
it might well be said that the journalist
returned to his Alma Mater yesterday
with all the graciousness that European
diplomacy could have taught him. I
I could not help but wonder if perhaps
he did not unconsciously contrast this
scene, when at every turn someone was
waiting to hang upon every word he
uttered, with that scene about twenty
five years ago when he wandered over
the campus as an undergraduate, by the
faculty, "known" but "unsung". But
whether or not Mr. Irwin indulged his
sense of humor, he gave an unusual
amount of pleasure to the students of
the University.
It was natural that Will Irwin should
have returned to Encina, but surely he
displayed the height of gentlemanly
chivalry when he appeared for an in
formal talk at Roble. As a member of
the second generation whose early
, history had been more or less intimately
connected with Will Irwin's humble
residence in San Francisco, I was rather
abashed as T stood listening to the won
derful experiences Mr. Irwin related so
simply. His ineffable humor always
came just as the lump in our throats
grew the most uncomfortable, like clear
sunshine pouring through the rain.
The story of the courage and valor
of the French and English women, I
think, will always thrill the American
1 girl. In speaking of the French women
particularly, Mr. Irwin said, "The
French woman is a wonderful executive,
and she had a good time running the
villages during the war. But in nurs
ing and in the munition factories which
were constantly raided, you realized
that she didn't like it. In France the
| family is a close, tight circle in which
| tHere is a keen pride, and the work in
the munition factories necessitated the
women getting out into the world.
"At first they lacked organization, but
after a year they forgot all this about
family position not allowing them to
do this or that, and they got along very
well. Each woman went to her job like
a man. There is one example which
Mrs. Irwin and I always think of in
this connection. One day we met a
truck coming down the road, and driv
ing it was a sixteen-year-old girl in a
pink smock. To us that typified the
spirit of the women of France."
There were other things Mr. Irwin
told us which made us stronger in the
belief that after all we might enter into
competition with the male of the species
in this man-made world.
Mrs. Irwin graciously told us of a
wonderful party given in a railroad sta
tion for the French poilu, and then it
was that I finally screwed up courage
enough to speak to the celebrity. I
think it was that schock of reddish
brown hair and his genial smile that
gave me the nerve. As soon as I told
him that he once knew my father and
mother in college and timidly mentioned
my name, he grasped my hand and I
knew we were friends. By this time he
was already backing toward the door.
Just before he escaped lie turned toward
me and said with a roguish twinkle in
his eye which made me suspect him of
deliberate intent, "You know this isn't
the first time I met you. When your
mother was living I used to take care of
you and hold you in my arms!" You
could easily hear the feminine gasps
around me. My embarrassment was
worth the admission .however, for I was
rather proud of the fact that Will Irwin
had given me a start in life.
