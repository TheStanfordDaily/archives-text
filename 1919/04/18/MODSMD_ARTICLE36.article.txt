## Why is a Diplomat? 
### 
tl le Peace Conference silting in Paris, the dean of
JmrJ men in liis office, the student manager before his
W.\M desk, the Student Council meeting on Tuesday night and the
president of the University leaving for the east mysteriously, the
qquestion naturally presents itself, who and why is a diplomat? If a diplomat
is some one mysterious, constantly saying, "Sh-sh-sh" in response to direct
questions and"I know, but can't tell you right now; wait a few months" to
other questions, then the Peace Conference delegates are fighting it out neck
and neck with some of Stanford's representatives on the field of diplomatic
incognitos and whispers.
The real diplomat is undoubtedly the man who accomplishes what he
sets out to accomplish and does it by the best means possible for the solu
* tion of his problem. The journalists will not scourge him for his necessary
tactful silence.
Diplomat Exists for a Purpose
Why >s a diplomat? Apparently a diplomat exists for a purpose, that
purpose being to accomplish desired results. If he fails in this purpose, his
excuse for existence vanishes. Why is a Stanford diplomat? Apparently to
solve problems connected with the University. Now these problems exist,
and we are cognizant that these problems need solution. But do these prob
lems need secrecy? Is it essential to their successful determination that they
be discussed always in private, that the newspapers are told, "You may pub
lish this, but not that, and tell about this man, but not that man, since we do
not. want to interfere with the deliberations of the grand and high delibera
tors." This is all very well when problems do not demand the public voice
and the public sentiment to be in accord with their solution. When, how
ever, public sentiment is necessary to the success of the plans that the mighty
are evolving it is essential that public sentiment be taken in on the deal and
public expression let itself be heard.
When we are told that student control is still in the making, and that
plans are being laid, that does not satisfy us and that does not tend to create
great confidence in the studonts. We want to know something about these
plans, how far they are progressing and what they may ultimately amount to.
When we are told that we are to play certain games of football, and one date
is left blank, and are coincidentally told that complete arrangements have
not been entered into with California, we want to know something about the
blank and what the difficulties with California are. After all, they're our dif
ficulties and our problems and the diplomats are only working them out
for us.
Sounds Involved? It is Involved
When we are told that our criticism is destructive criticism, that appar
ently means that we are interfering with something about which we know
nothing, but about which somebody probably knows something, which we
will learn sometime later. This sounds involved. Well, it is involved. So
is Stanford diplomacy. It is not alone involved, it is confused and unneces
sary. There is destructive criticism because there are some things to be
destroyed before anything else can be constructed.
We do not want publicity for what would be damaged through publicity,
unless what is damaged is what we want damaged. But if we had more open
discussion, less "Not today, but tomorrow; the committee is meeting an
swers to our requests for information, then ultimately we might have less
sleeping committees, less unpleasant and sudden exposures, less unsatisfac
tory results. It is easier to correct before than to erase after making. Open
discussion might sometimes bring results different from secret sessions;
sometime these results might not be the best, but in the long run these
results will be what is desired. There is, then, no Stanford answer to "Why
is a diplomat?"

Why >s a diplomat? Apparently a diplomat exists for a purpose, that
purpose being to accomplish desired results. If he fails in this purpose, his
excuse for existence vanishes. Why is a Stanford diplomat? Apparently to
solve problems connected with the University. Now these problems exist,
and we are cognizant that these problems need solution. But do these prob
lems need secrecy? Is it essential to their successful determination that they
be discussed always in private, that the newspapers are told, "You may pub
lish this, but not that, and tell about this man, but not that man, since we do
not. want to interfere with the deliberations of the grand and high delibera
tors." This is all very well when problems do not demand the public voice
and the public sentiment to be in accord with their solution. When, how
ever, public sentiment is necessary to the success of the plans that the mighty
are evolving it is essential that public sentiment be taken in on the deal and
public expression let itself be heard.
When we are told that student control is still in the making, and that
plans are being laid, that does not satisfy us and that does not tend to create
great confidence in the studonts. We want to know something about these
plans, how far they are progressing and what they may ultimately amount to.
When we are told that we are to play certain games of football, and one date
is left blank, and are coincidentally told that complete arrangements have
not been entered into with California, we want to know something about the
blank and what the difficulties with California are. After all, they're our dif
ficulties and our problems and the diplomats are only working them out
for us.
Sounds Involved? It is Involved
When we are told that our criticism is destructive criticism, that appar
ently means that we are interfering with something about which we know
nothing, but about which somebody probably knows something, which we
will learn sometime later. This sounds involved. Well, it is involved. So
is Stanford diplomacy. It is not alone involved, it is confused and unneces
sary. There is destructive criticism because there are some things to be
destroyed before anything else can be constructed.
We do not want publicity for what would be damaged through publicity,
unless what is damaged is what we want damaged. But if we had more open
discussion, less "Not today, but tomorrow; the committee is meeting an
swers to our requests for information, then ultimately we might have less
sleeping committees, less unpleasant and sudden exposures, less unsatisfac
tory results. It is easier to correct before than to erase after making. Open
discussion might sometimes bring results different from secret sessions;
sometime these results might not be the best, but in the long run these
results will be what is desired. There is, then, no Stanford answer to "Why
is a diplomat?"
tl le Peace Conference silting in Paris, the dean of
JmrJ men in liis office, the student manager before his
W.\M desk, the Student Council meeting on Tuesday night and the
president of the University leaving for the east mysteriously, the
qquestion naturally presents itself, who and why is a diplomat? If a diplomat
is some one mysterious, constantly saying, "Sh-sh-sh" in response to direct
questions and"I know, but can't tell you right now; wait a few months" to
other questions, then the Peace Conference delegates are fighting it out neck
and neck with some of Stanford's representatives on the field of diplomatic
incognitos and whispers.
The real diplomat is undoubtedly the man who accomplishes what he
sets out to accomplish and does it by the best means possible for the solu
* tion of his problem. The journalists will not scourge him for his necessary
tactful silence.
