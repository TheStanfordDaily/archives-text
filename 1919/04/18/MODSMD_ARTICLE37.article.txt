# Wherefore and Why?

### M.L. Levy, '19 
THERE has developed recently a sentiment on the campus somewhat in
opposition to the old form of student control, as it is known to some of
us. The grounds and fears of a return to this farcical management of our
own affairs are well founded for the most part. For it is a well-known fact
that student control, such as it was immediately before the war, did not. ful
fill the requirements of the Stanford institution.
But because of the failure of student control under handicap, it does not
signify that the system of government would be essentially wrong, if prop
erly worked out. The whole matter seems to resolve itself into the funda
mental American weaknessâ€”a community of people too busy with their own
individual interests to pay any attention to public welfare.
The present committee appointed to investigate the feasibility of handing
over student control to its rightful owners has either gone to sleep on the
beat, or perhaps it does not consider the project worth while. In either case,
a report should be forthcoming.
No thinking person would suggest reverting to the old regime of "stu
dents proposing and faculty disposing," which simply means that there was
never any particle of power vested in the students according to the old plan,
when it did not coincide with the viewpoint of the faculty. The council
seemingly was all-powerful, but full well it knew that it was up to them to
see that such punishment was meted out, before the faculty committee had
a chance to bring its big guns into action.
Regardless of the flaws in the old system, the present system is even
worse, and the students are deprived of all semblance of power and repre
sentation. Now, men and women do not in the majority of cases come to an
institution of higher learning for the purpose of being arbitrarily managed
much as is in vogue in some nice up-to-date reform school, but they become
university students to learn to control themselves. Of course they will make
mistakes, and in all probability the present system has made its blunders,
too; who knows?
The lack of trust in the students by the powers that be is well found
ed and is based upon the same well-known lack of confidence by the faculty
as regards children's ability to take care of themselves. In all probability
the episode of February 22 would never have been perpetrated had there at
that time been an efficient system of student control.
This article does not intend to put forth any plan, but simply shows the
dire and sore straits into which we have allowed ourselves to fall, when we,
a college community, will not take enough interest in our own affairs to ask
for and formulate an efficient system for our own government.
