# VARSITY AND FRESHMEN READY TO CLASH WITH BLUE AND GOLD NINES; TRIANGULAR TRACK MEET FOR 1922
## "Babes" Will Meet Bears at Berkeley First-Year Men Can Take Series by Winning the Second Game 
### 
W HILE the Stanford and California
Varsities are meeting on the Car
dinal diamond, the freshman baseball
team will journey to Berkeley for the
escond game of their series with the
Bruin cubs . If the babes are able to
carry off this game, it will mean that
the series go to them.
Last Saturday the freshmen pulled
the unexpected when they scored a win
over the Bruins; for it is seven years
since a freshman baseball team wearing
the Cardinal colors has won a first
game in the California series. If the
babes can win the scries it will be the
first time in over ten years that the
Stanford freshmen have carried off such
a series.
Infield to Be Switched
The infield that faces the Bears will
be somewhat different from the one
that went up against them last Satur
day. Because of the injuries received
by Gomez in the San Jose game, the
team is without a second baseman.
Davies, who has been actin'g a general
utility man in tlie infield, will be sent
in as short, and Rouseslot will be shifted
to bis old position at third. Wallace,
who played third in the last California
game, will play the keystone position.
I lawkes will be 011 first, as usual.
The infield for the second game is
even stronger than that which was put
on the field last Saturday. I lawkes, the
babes' skipper, is a tower of strength on
the initial sack and his hitting has begun
to be a factor again. Wallace is equally
as good on second as he was on third.
Davies, the new man of the combination,
is faster on his feet than was Gomez
and hits about as hard, kousselot is
thoroughly familiar with the ground
around third and will put up a good
game there.
Outfield Looks Strong
The Cardinal outfield compares w r ell
with that of the Bruins. The Stanford
gardeners hit the ball harder in the last
game than did the Blue and Gold fielders.
In center field Stevenson showed up
as a much more valuable man than did
Deeds in California's center garden, lie
got two hits to Deeds' none and played
a faster game in the field. Spires and
Foster appear to be about on a par.
Holmes hits the ball harder than David
son and covers a lot more ground.
Cubs Have Edge on Batteries
The cubs seem to have an edge on
the Card freshmen in the box. Mc-
Henry pitched a better game, outside the
first two innings last Saturday than
did either Shambergcr or Sibley. He
struck out seven men to Shambcrger's
one and Sibley's nothing. I lis hitting
is far superior to that of any of the
Cardinal pitchers, with the possible ex
ception of Sibley. Holston is about on
a par with Cline .the Bruins' captain,
behind the hat.
The teams line up as follows:
Stanford —Stevenson, cf; Wallace. 2b;
Spires, rf; Holmes, If; Davies ,ss; Rous
selot, 3b; Holston, c; Tlawkes, lb;
Mangin, Sibley, Shambergcr or Neer, p.
California —Deeds, cf: Geary, lb;
Cline, c; McTlenry ,p; FMs, ss; David
son, rf; Foster. If; Mutton, 3b; Fergu
son ,2b.
