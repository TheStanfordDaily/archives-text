# THEODORE HOOVER IS MADE HEAD OF NEW DEPARTMENT
## 
### 
AT the meeting of the Hoard of
1 rustees, held March 28, Theodore
Hoover was appointed Professor of
Mining and Metallurgy. This appoint
ment marks a new period in the develop
ment of the teaching of Mining and
Metallurgy at the University. Plans
are now being formulated so that these
subjects will be handled under Profes
sor Hoover's direction, rather than in
close association with Geology, as has
been the case in the past.
The aim is for Mining and Metallurgy
to he organized as a graduate course
leading to the degree of Engineer (of
Mines). Candidates '.for admission will
be largely trained in the Departments of
Geology, Chemistry, Engineering, etc.,
and such candidates will present as qual
ifications for admission the degree of A.
B. from Stanford or its equivalent from
some other institution. There will be
active cooperation with the Departments
of Geology, Chemistry and others, and
the pre-mining courses will be designed
to give prospective mining engineers a
broad foundation in science, language.
English, economics and history, upon
which foundation will be superimposed
the two years' work leading to the de
gree of Engineer of Mines.
Special attention will be given to the
mining and metallurgy of the metals and
emphasis will be continued on the
branch of petroleum technology, in
which lines of activity Stanford gradu
ates have been pre-eminently successfull
in all parts of the world. In addition
to technical education, the division of
technical research as it applies to the
unsolved problems in the utilization of
the natural resources of California will
receive active attention.
Theodore Hoover was born at West

Friends Pacific Academy at Newberg.
Oregon, and Pcnn College (Friends) at

veloped the flotation process of ore
concentration and applied it successfully
to the treatment of the ores at Broken

This period also gnve him the op
portunity and material for bis book on
the "Concentration of Ores," which has
run through three editions and is still
an authoritative text on this art.. Dur

Tn all of these positic ns he has demon
strated great executive and administra

financial and engineering skill. In the
course of his professional work 1 ro
fessor Hoover has travelled extensively
in England, Australia. Mexico, Finland,
Germany, France, Russia, India, and
Asia Minor, and has thus visited prac

countries.
AT the meeting of the Hoard of
1 rustees, held March 28, Theodore
Hoover was appointed Professor of
Mining and Metallurgy. This appoint

Metallurgy at the University. Plans
are now being formulated so that these
subjects will be handled under Profes

close association with Geology, as has
been the case in the past.
The aim is for Mining and Metallurgy
to he organized as a graduate course
leading to the degree of Engineer (of
Mines). Candidates '.for admission will
be largely trained in the Departments of
Geology, Chemistry, Engineering, etc.,
and such candidates will present as qual
ifications for admission the degree of A.
B. from Stanford or its equivalent from
some other institution. There will be
active cooperation with the Departments
of Geology, Chemistry and others, and
the pre-mining courses will be designed
to give prospective mining engineers a
broad foundation in science, language.
English, economics and history, upon
which foundation will be superimposed
the two years' work leading to the de
gree of Engineer of Mines.
Special attention will be given to the
mining and metallurgy of the metals and
emphasis will be continued on the
branch of petroleum technology, in
which lines of activity Stanford gradu
ates have been pre-eminently successfull
in all parts of the world. In addition
to technical education, the division of
technical research as it applies to the
unsolved problems in the utilization of
the natural resources of California will
receive active attention.
Theodore Hoover was born at West

Friends Pacific Academy at Newberg.
