THE TANK FIGHTS
There were many fights between the
classes of '95 and '96, but the most
celebrated became known as the "tank
lights." The first of these famous con
flicts took place during an interclass
baseball game in the year 1894. In the
midst of the game it was noticed that
the large white figures "94" were being
painted on a water-tank near by.
A general stampede for the bleachers
resulted, and in a very few moments
the tank was fairly buried under a mass
of waving arms and legs. The score
of the game was never known.
Hereafter it became the object of each
succeeding class to keep their numerals
freshly painted on the tank. This
famous relic, long since disappeared,
was located in the fields southwest of
Encina.
THE PALO Al-TO FIGHT
Another well remembered conflict be
tween these same classes took place in
Palo Alto in a partially built house.
After wrecking the house the '96 class
got the sophomores well tied up. They
then made preparations to celebrate the

occasion by taking a flashlight. Just as
the fatal picture was to be taken one
of the 95 men jerked away from his
captors and heroically kicked the camera
over. Thus the honor of the class was
saved and the deed will ever go down
in Stanford history.
Considerable trouble came up later
on account of the damage done to the
house, and the two classes were finally
forced to pay for it.
the '95 OAK
So well known was it that even the
present generation of Stanford students
have heard of the '95 Oak. It was a
large, stately tree, which stood just out
side of the original quad" on the road
to old Roble Hall. The bench under it
was only one of the reasons for its be
coming a favorite place for "queeners".
1 he class of '95 decided to adopt the
tree and put a bronze plate to this effect
on it. When the outer quad was built
the oak was cut down. Many mem
bers of the class objected seriously at
the destruction of such an old landmark.
It was said that the main part of the
tree could have been saved. Charles
Field was one of the most indignant
members of the class.
