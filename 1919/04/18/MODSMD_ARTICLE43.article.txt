# PAST FAILURES POOR ARGUMENT AGAINST ATTEMPTS IN FUTURE
## 
### J.K. Lilly, '19 
LITTLE more can be said on the sub
ject of student control than has
already been said. Student control
lias been offered to the students and
the next step is up to them. Natu
rally the program should be construct
ed and pushed forward by the stu
dent leaders, but unless the student
body as a whole shows interest in the
undertaking the matter will drop be
fore it proceeds any further.
The failure of student control in the
past has been cited by many as an
argument for attempting it again.
That is a very poor argument, for
student control in the past was noth
ing more nor less than a farce, lij
fact, there never was student control
here. The faculty has always re
tained unto itself the power to con
trol the students. It is true that the
students disciplined themselves, but
they did this under rules laid down

by the faculty, and the students' de
cisions were nothing more than rec
ommendations subject to approval of
the faculty. In the old days of so
called student control there was con
tinual strife and distrust between the
faculty and students, and this will re
main so until real student control is
established.
Student control should give the stu
dents power to make all rules regard
ing the conduct of student life; they
should also have the power to make
decisions on all questions and more
than that, should have the power to
enforce these decisions. Not only
should the discipline of the students
be placed in their hands, but also all
finances, all student activities, and in
short anything concerning the stu
dent body as a whole. This is a big
proposition and requires a large
amount of serious consideration.
