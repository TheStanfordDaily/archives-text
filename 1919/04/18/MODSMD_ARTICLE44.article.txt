# THIRTEENTH ANNIVERSASARY OF BIG SHAKE
## 
### Evelyn Gore, '22 
IT is thirteen years almost to a day
since Stanford went through the
Valley of the Shadow of Death in the
earthquake of 1906. Architecturally the
Stanford before that time was a differ
ent place from the Stanford we know
today. Buildings have changed, monu
ments have been moved, but the spirit
of "the greatest university in the West"
has continued strong and beautiful, —not
to be weakened or devitalized even by
a great calamity.
The earthquake began at seven min
utes past five on the morning of April 18,
1906, and lasted for twenty seconds.
During that time damage amounting to
$3,000,000 was done to campus buildings.
The new library had just been ac
cepted. Tt was a handsome structure,
large, four-storied, and with an im
mense glass dome. It was completely
wrecked, oidy the dome, standing high
on a naked trestle of steel, remaining.
The new gymnasium, the interior not
quite finished, was a terrible ruin. This
building also boasted a dome, of falling
masonry. Tt pulled down the front wall
of the building from the roof to the
first story.
Memorial Arch, one of the most
beautiful features of the Quad, was
broken and cracked beyond hope of
reapir. It was lowered to the frieze. —
that famous frieze representing the
march of civilization across the Ameri
can continent. Two huge cracks, one
on each side, split the arch open to the
interior.
The marble canopy above the Weeping
Angel was struck to the ground. How
ever, only one finger of the statue was
lost. "Gleaming whitcly, kneeling low,

amid the trees in its secluded spot, the
Angel of Grief breathes a prayer."
Memorial Church suffered more se
verely than any other building on the
campus. Ihe clock tower was shattered
in half and fell into the body of the
church, piling up a mass of stones and
timbers on the altar. Ihe front mosaic,
portraying then, as it does now, the
Sermon on the Mount, fell but upon
the pavement of the inner quadrangle,
leaving the organ loft exposed, but only
slightly damaging the organ. If the
front had fallen in, instead of out, the
organ would never have been used again.
Stained glass windows, buttresses and
ornamental supports were utterly demol
ished. In many places the roof fell in,
leaving the interior open.
Stanford today is—different.' All that
remains to remind us of the fallen
library is a pile of stones beyond the
art gallery. The new library of our
own time is nearing completion. There
is no longer a Memorial Arch, and the
family group has been removed from
the court. Encina and Roble were
ready in August of 1906 as dormatorics
for returning students, and since that
time have been in almost constant use.
The Angel of Grief has wept without
her canopy for thirteen years. Me
morial Church is restored, the roof hav
ing been rebuilt in the Mission style
rather than with a high tower.
Fall registration in 1906 almost
equaled the registration of the previous
semester. Stanford students responded
to the call for reconstruction and re
turned to build up the spirit of Stan
ford as the buildings of the University
had been rebuilt during the summer.
