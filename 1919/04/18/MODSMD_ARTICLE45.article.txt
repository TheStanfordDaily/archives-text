# STANFORD'S FIGHTING CHANCE
## 
### Neil H. Petree, '19 
SPRING intercollegiate athletics will be ushered in tomorrow afternoon when
the varsity baseball teams of Stanford and the University of California
tangle on the Cardinal diamond in the initial game of the 1919 series. The old
Stanford spirit has been a decided minus quantity this year, but local enthusiasm
has been gradually rising since the freshmen nosed a win from their baseball
rivals across the bay in the lirst of their series of games. The "pep" displayed
in the bleachers tomorrow will be the best proof of the actual state of affairs
j.s regards the students' interest in what is going on in the world of college
activities.

I he dopester who has hut casually followed the play of the opposing 1 nines
and who places his hets on the team that has the greatest percentage of wins in
the season's practice contests will undoubtedly favor the Blue and Gold. He will
probably more than favor them, he will back them for a cinch victory, for the
Cardinal tossers have played a poor brand of ball all year, while the Berkeley
aggregation has defeated teams, such as the University of Santa Clara, which
easily smeared the Stanford club.
College Ball Teams After Blow-Up
Dope o fthis order docs not always work when summing up the chances of
college ball teams, for after all college baseball nines are what they arc, not
real teams with every man a cog in a machine, but just ordinary clubs with lots
of enthusiasm, and apt to play away over their heads or decidedly under form
st any minute. Stanford teams seem to have a happy habit of playing a better
game when opposed to their Berkeley rivals than they put up during the
season. They come thru as only Stanford teams can come thru, and it is just
this that gives the writer hopes of a Cardinal victory tomorrow. Frankly, the
University of California nine, with a strong battery, a fair bunch of fielders and
a good hitting club looks much stronger than what Stanford has to Offer; lmt
the mere fact that the opening contest is on the home diamond, that the bleachers
will have a predomincnce of madly cheering Cardinal supporters, and that a
tradition seems to exist around the University that Stanford teams rise to meet
the occasion, 110 matter what it may he, may turn the tide, and give the short
ender a victory over the much touted and over-praised opponents.
Coach Lvans has had a hard row to hoe this season. 1 he playing year was
badly broken up by the final examinations at the end of the winter quarter. The
fact that new men registered in April, and came out for baseball, made it practically
impossible to pick a combination and pay it steadily for a long period of time.
In fact, the present varsity men have played together for but two weeks, and
are hardly acquainted.

Nevertheless, the squad has shown a
phenomenal improvement in the past few
weeks, and from a gang of hitless won
ders, they have developed until Evans
has a nine that will keep Ellison, the
Berkeley chucker, working every minute
to keep the total of base hits down. Lilly
is a typical slugger, and is just as liable

to connect for a home run as. the average
man is for a lowly single. Then, again
he is fast, and will beat out a slow
ground ball. Stevens is the oldest vet
eran on the club, and is not only a good
fielder, hut a sticker who will be well
worth watching during the coming
series. Captain Galloway is the next bats
man, and will probably make his pres
ence felt ;it the plate. Caughcy and
Kallum have hit consistently, and Pike,
while weak so far this season, is known

to have met the ball with great regu
larity in the past, and may take a brace
against California.
From a defensive point of view, the
squad looks much stronger. The pitch
ers arc not the best in the world, but
Pelouze and Newlands will be in there
working all the time; both have shown
stuff against some of the strong teams
which have opposed Stanford, demon
strating that they have more on the ball
than just "four lingers and a thumb.''
Meyers, Dexter and White are hitters
with good reputations, but they will
have to at least "look them over" when
facing the Cardinal tossers this year.
I he infield looks to the writer to be
a far better combination than any that
Stanford has turned out lately. Tueb
ner play/ a nice first base, while Kallum
at the next bag, is a finished ball player.
Galloway, the captain of the squad, is
stationed at short, and consistently fields
well, and is unequaled around these
parts in throwing. Stevens completes
the inner wall of defense at third, and
needs no sporting writer's compliments.
1 fe has played against California for
three years,,and has been a star through
out. He will more than hold up his
corner of the diamond tomorrow.
In the outer pastures, Lilly at center
will miss no balls possible of fielding,
while Pike in left is about as good.
Caughcy, handicapped with a badly
on the club, not because he can pick off
sprained ankle, is slow in fielding. He is
would be baschits, but because he can do
a Lit of slugging himself. After all, this
is what baseball fans pay admission to
see, so any little oversights that Caughey
may make in the right garden can well be
excused. Crowe, Kline, and Parker arc
good flychasers, and may" figure in the
series.
Behind the bat, Evans has two men
capable of handling the receiving end
of the struggle. Bundy and Stuart will
lioth play in the series, and will come
through for a certainty. Bundy is a weak
thrower to bases, but is a better hitter
â€¢han Stuart. Both catchers hold up the
pitchers well, and in case the California

batters go on a rampage, will do a great
deal to settle the team.
The number of games won and lost
during the season shows the Blue and
Gold team to be the better of the two
nines, while the opposing battery is re
puted to be superior to Stanford's. In
addition, the Berkeley gang has, a habit
of hitting when hits mean tallies, while
the Cards have nearly rivaled the famous
hitless White Sox with their lack of
base swats. Nevertheless, baseball games
are not won on Underwood typewriters,
and no dopester has ever yet picked a
college winner with any degree of cer
tainty. But the paper goes to press
with the Stanford team confident; for it
has a fighting chance, and that is all
that any Stanford team ever arked for.
