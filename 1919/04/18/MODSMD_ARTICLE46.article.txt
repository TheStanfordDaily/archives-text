# WAR HEROES WILL BE COMMEMORATED IN MEMORIAL HALL
## 
### Marguerite Roberts, '20 
SIANFORD'S Memorial Hall will
commemorate the part played by
Stanford men and women in the world
war. It will be a monument to the three
thousand Stanford men who fought and
the sixty-five who died for ideals which
appealed to Stanford people. In the
desire to express our appreciation for
the service, the Memorial I tall, in which
Stanford people of today and tomorrow
may gather together in an atmosphere
which will be fittingly appropriate, has
been conceived.
The campaign plans for this Memorial
Hall have been worked out and will be
presented to the University at an assem
bly to be held on April 23. Students,
faculty alumni and friends of the Uni
versity will be permitted to contribute ti
the memorial fund. That they will con
tribute generously, we feel assured. As
they have met the many war demands of
the past months .so they will meet the
demands for the Stanford memorial.
The task will not be completed in a
month or a year; many present students
may not, as students, see the finished
work. To them will only come the privi
lege of giving for Stanford, and the
satisfaction of returning in after years
to view the strutcure with a feeling of
pride, as those who contributed and
aided in order that it might be erected.
The Memorial Hall will serve as a
school through which, as time goes on,
the youth of America may become in
structed in the democracy for which
those sixty-five Stanford men gave their
lives. Not in a shapeless mass of granite
or bronze, but in a living monument, will
tlie pride and glory of Stanford go down
through the years.
Representative men and women in uni
versity activities will be asked to sit on
the platform at th eassembly which
will take on a strictly student body tone
and will be the first big step in the stu
dent campaign. A faculty committee is
carrying on a branch of the work among
its own members. Every effort is being
concentrated on the memorial campaign
in order to assure complete success,
