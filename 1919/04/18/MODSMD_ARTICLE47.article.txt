# ANGLO – AMERICAN ALLIANCE
## 
### Ruth Searcy, '20 
FOR the best interests of the world
at large, it seems lit that Great
I»ritain and the U. S. should combine to
form an Anglo-American alliance to un
dertake the enforcement of the terms
which will bp finally concluded by the
Peace Conference. This alliance need
not be formal, but rather in the form of
an understanding with a mutual purpose
in view. Possibly such an association
would come about as a natural result;
but if it comes with the conscious effort
of tlie peoples of the two nations behind
it, it will be just so much the better.
Now is the time for the combination
to take place. Good feeling resulting
from tlie recent war cooperation exists
in abundance between England and
America at the present time. In fact,
the two nations are now more friendly
than they have ever been. This very
good will should lie taken advantage of
and utilized while it is still at its height.
Not that Great Britain and the United
States are likely to resume the more or
less strained feelings toward each other
which they have experienced the last
century and a half! That is impossible
since they have fought side by side for
the last several years. To illustrate
this point, the problem of many, every
day families might serve. The parent
and child cleave to each other closely
during the first period of tlie child's
life. Then the child learns gradually
how to take care of himself; and at
length feels the weight of his own
knowledge so heavy that he asserts his
independence and strugggles for his own
livelihood. The parent resents this at
titude in the child, while at the same
time the child resents the parent's at
titude. There follows some disagree
ment and discord. But when a common
danger or foe present; itself, parent and
child strive together against it. Through
cooperation in this single instance, they
realize that at heart their interests are
the same and infinitely bound up in
each other. A compete reconciliation
ensues.
Great Britain as the parent and the
United States as the child may be said
to have gone through just such an ex
perience, which, by the way, is not at
all uncommon, but quite the natural
thing. The American Revolution may
be called the point of strife between
parent country and child colony; while
the recent war brought on a common
foe and danger pointed out the
mutual interests of the two countries.
Great Britain and the United States
have much upon which to base an al
liance. The fact that they are related,
one being the author and founder of
the other, counts for much. By dint
of this fact they are holders of the
same or similar ideas on the subjects
$112 morals, institutions, government,
philosophy, lows, conventions, religion,
education, and the progress of civiliza
tion in general. Their common speak
ing and written language makes them
understood by each other as no other
two great nations are at present. Re
cent steps taken in both countries, such
as the granting of the vote to women

and the advance of labor unionism,
show that their minds run along the
same channels in regard to the great
political and economic problems of the
day. Another note of similarity may be
touched in the fact'that at last the
common people are tl»c sovereign power
in England as they are in this country.
So. considering that Great Britain and
the United States were reconciled on the
battlefield in the late war and that they
have so many common attributes and
interests, an alliance between them
would come as a natural thing. Indeed,
the accomplishment of such a union
lies in the line of least resistance, since
the two countries art provided with so
many common advantages.
I luis far England and America have
stood together in the points coming be
fore the Peace Conference. ft is ex
pected that they will continue to do so.
Should they not. there will be no League
of Nations. These are certainly the
two largest and politically and economic
ally the two most important nations of
all those represented at the Conference.
And, fortunately, they are just about
equally important, all things considered.
It can be seen, then, that their division
would be ruinous to the proposed
League, while their combination would
mean that it would be founded firmly.
Great Britain and tlie United States
are prepared to be the leaders in the
enforcement of the League's terms. In
fact, no other nation "has now the power.
Devastated France, depopulated Italy,
broken Russia and conquered Germany,
—what can they do? Nothing at pres
ent. It, therefore, will devolve upon
these two nations to carry out the
League's terms. As members of such a
League, it will be their duty to assume
entire responsibility until the other na
tions are able to share it.
r Admittedly, war has made the powers
that control the seas supreme. Great
Britain and America happen to be the
only nations now supporting large na
vies. It seems, accoiding to her naval
program, that within a few years the
United. States Navy will equal the Brit
ish Navy; but even now it is an appreci
able force. Some persons have felt that
the increase on America's part may be
disturbing Great Britain. It is possible;
but instead of jealous thinking, how
much better would be a conscious plan
for a combined power to insure justice
and maritime freedom. Not a greater
contribution toward a lasting peace and
a permanent world organization could
be made. Not only duty, then, but also
honor and credit face the two nations
who are now hesitating before, starting
in on the task before them.
In order to do the service they are
called upon for, the two nations must
feel that theirs is a common motive and
a common aim. And it is the people
of each who will or will not show such
a feeling. No governmental union can
be declared. Only sympathy and a com
mon understanding arising from the
people will accomplish the Anglo-Amer
ican alliance, which, if effected, will be
the greatest force of the present age
for international good.
