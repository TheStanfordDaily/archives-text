# S.F. TEAMS SLATED FOR FIRST CONTEST WITH 1922 ON OVAL
## 
### 
STANFORD freshman track men
will meet their first outside com
petition of the season tomorrow after
noon at 2:30, when they will hold a
triangular meet with the teams from
Lick-Wilmerdine and Ban Francisco
Polytechnic High Schools.
The freshmen have had no outside
meets previously on account of the
general weakness of the team and the
slowness of the members in rounding
into condition. A considerable in
crease in interest during the past few
weeks has brought many new men
onto the track and it would not be at
all surprising for the first-year men
to show up better tomorrow than has
been expected of them.
Visiting Teams Strong
According to previous performances
of the year the "prep" school teams
have several good all round men who
will make the "babes" work tomor
row. Minishall, Larson and Shlaude
/
man are sure point winners for the
1922 team.
Several other men have been show
ing up well and should count in to
morrow's mpet Vaughn in the hifeh
jump and Jenks in the quarter are do
ing good work. Chapmen and Ed
wards showed up well in the javelin
