# BEAR CUBS DEFEAT CARDINAL BABES ON BRUINS' DIAMOND
## NINTH INNING RALLY WINS FOR U.C. Mangin Pitches Good Game, But Gets Poor Support 
### J.W. Rhodes, '22 
A ninth-inning rally on the part ,of
the California freshmen, aided by
the jinx that has heen pursuing the Car
dinal freshmen ball team all season, gave
the Bear cubs a 5-4 victory over the
Stanford freshman baseball men last
Saturday. This victory will mean that
the series must go f(,r three games, as
the teams have each won one and lost
one game.
The winning of the game by the cubs
is right in line with old Stanford tra
ditions and gives the California babes
a chance to come through with a win
for the series, as they have done for
the past twelve years. The tradition
seemed to have lost its power for this
year—for at the beginning of the last
half of the ninth inning the score stood
5-3, with the Cardinal babes on the long
end of the score, and Magnin, the Stan
ford pitcher going strong. Ten minutes
later the game was over and the grand
stand was singing "All Hail, Blue and
Gold."
Cards. Fail to Hold Lead
In their half of the second, the Stan
ford boys, through the presentation of
two walks, a man reaching first on a
fielder's choice, and an error on the part
of the Rruin pitcher, filled the bases
with only one man out. At this point
Mangin came to hat, and, pulling an un
usual stunt for a pitcher, he dropped
a Texas leaguer hack of short for a
single that brought in two runs. With
two men on and two out, Hawkes was'
caught off second, and so the babes re 1
tired with a two run lead.
In their half of the same inning, the!
cubs came right back and scored two
runs and three hits off Mangin, and tied j
the score. After one man had gone I
out, Hells hit one down the foul line, i
called a fair ball by the umpire, and got j
to second before the hall could be re
layed back t(t the infield. A walk and
two singles brought in two runs.
An error by Davies, and a single, coup-'
led with a sacrifice, gave California an
ther run in the fourth and at the same
time a one-run lead.
Cards. Regain Lead
In the first half of the sixth, the first
man up, Spires, got a Holmes
singled and advanced him to third—and
n error by Hutton, California's third
baseman, filled the baks. A sacrifice
by Holston brought Holmes home after
Rousselot had bunted and sent Spires |
icross the plate with the tieing run. An I
error allowed Hawkes to reach first and
Rousselot to score his second run
nt" the day. Further scoring was pre
vented by McHenry, catching Hawkes
off second.
From tlie fourth inning until the be
ginning of the last half of the ninth,
Mangin pitched air-tight ball and al
lowed only four hits. All through the i
game. Mangin seemecf to have the Cali
fornia batsmen completely in his power.
Especially in pinches, or when there
were men on bases, he would tighten up
and force the batter to hit a weak
grounder or a pop fly. The defeat can
only be charge to lack of support and
confidence on the part of the rest of the
team.
Ninth Inning Rally Wins Game
The first man up in the California's
half of the ninth laid a clean single down
between third and short. Ferguson then
hit the ball to Rousselot who threw it
to Wallace at second for a double play.
Wallace dropped the ball and both men
were safe. The next man up was given
a walk. With the bases full and two
runs needed to tie the game, Mays was
sent in to hat for Deeds. He hit a hot
grounder to Rousselot who fumbled it
Two overthrows were made, and when
the dust cleared away, California had
scored three runs and wun the game.

A ninth-inning rally on the part ,of
the California freshmen, aided by
the jinx that has heen pursuing the Car
dinal freshmen ball team all season, gave
the Bear cubs a 5-4 victory over the
Stanford freshman baseball men last
Saturday. This victory will mean that
the series must go f(,r three games, as
the teams have each won one and lost
one game.
The winning of the game by the cubs
is right in line with old Stanford tra
ditions and gives the California babes
a chance to come through with a win
for the series, as they have done for
the past twelve years. The tradition
seemed to have lost its power for this
year—for at the beginning of the last
half of the ninth inning the score stood
5-3, with the Cardinal babes on the long
end of the score, and Magnin, the Stan
ford pitcher going strong. Ten minutes
later the game was over and the grand
stand was singing "All Hail, Blue and
Gold."
Cards. Fail to Hold Lead
In their half of the second, the Stan
ford boys, through the presentation of
two walks, a man reaching first on a
fielder's choice, and an error on the part
of the Rruin pitcher, filled the bases
with only one man out. At this point
Mangin came to hat, and, pulling an un
usual stunt for a pitcher, he dropped
a Texas leaguer hack of short for a
single that brought in two runs. With
two men on and two out, Hawkes was'
caught off second, and so the babes re 1
tired with a two run lead.
In their half of the same inning, the!
cubs came right back and scored two
runs and three hits off Mangin, and tied j
the score. After one man had gone I
out, Hells hit one down the foul line, i
called a fair ball by the umpire, and got j
to second before the hall could be re
layed back t(t the infield. A walk and
two singles brought in two runs.
An error by Davies, and a single, coup-'
led with a sacrifice, gave California an
ther run in the fourth and at the same
time a one-run lead.
Cards. Regain Lead
In the first half of the sixth, the first
man up, Spires, got a Holmes
singled and advanced him to third—and
n error by Hutton, California's third
baseman, filled the baks. A sacrifice
by Holston brought Holmes home after
Rousselot had bunted and sent Spires |
icross the plate with the tieing run. An I
error allowed Hawkes to reach first and
Rousselot to score his second run
nt" the day. Further scoring was pre
vented by McHenry, catching Hawkes
off second.
From tlie fourth inning until the be
ginning of the last half of the ninth,
Mangin pitched air-tight ball and al
lowed only four hits. All through the i
game. Mangin seemecf to have the Cali
fornia batsmen completely in his power.
Especially in pinches, or when there
were men on bases, he would tighten up
and force the batter to hit a weak
grounder or a pop fly. The defeat can
only be charge to lack of support and
confidence on the part of the rest of the
team.
Ninth Inning Rally Wins Game
The first man up in the California's
half of the ninth laid a clean single down
between third and short. Ferguson then
hit the ball to Rousselot who threw it
to Wallace at second for a double play.
Wallace dropped the ball and both men
were safe. The next man up was given
a walk. With the bases full and two
runs needed to tie the game, Mays was
sent in to hat for Deeds. He hit a hot
grounder to Rousselot who fumbled it
Two overthrows were made, and when
the dust cleared away, California had
scored three runs and wun the game.
