Public Exhibition is Success.
The exhibition crew rexes at the Red
wood channel yesterday proved to be a
big success, both in the crowd and in
the. 1 working of the three shells. There
was one real race, besides a number of
workout sprints before a crowd of sev
eral hunrded people. In the race, the
\ arsity started, giving the other boats
a handicap of several langths. passed
them, and was about three lengths ahead
at the end of the half mile.
When (lie Varsity shell started sprint
ing. it fairly leaped out of the water.
Spectators commented on the fact that
this year s boat is already working better
than any they have put out at Stanford.
Coach Rogers said that the men did good
work, but did not come up to their usual
style, <111 account of thf bad wind and
lough waters.
Men Make Fine Showing
Captain Watts and Roy King are the
standbys of the \ arsity boat. They arc i
the only two old Varsity crew men from j
the 1917 boat. With King setting the [
pace at stroke and Watts sitting back!
of him jit number seven, the Varsity!
oarsmen row like clockwork.
According to "Husky" Guerena, who)
has been helping with the daily work
outs during the last few days. Fred
Adams is a second Newton. Newton
is a big lumber jack, who rowed with
Washington for three years and was
picked for the all American crew. Gue
rena -aid that Cash Davis is rowing as
smooth an oar as he has ever seen
pulled. Wilbur. Williamson, Moore and
McGillisray. who rowed with the Var
sity yesterday, are all coming along in
excellent shape.
Other oßats Fast
Tin second Varsity and freshman
shells are unusually fast and well balan
ced with good oarsmen. The positions

the men rowed in yesterday, do not
necessarily mean that they are to have
those seat- for the big race. With the
improving of several men on the sec
ond Varsity, some of the men on the
las'. line string, will have to light hard
to retain their number.
Patrick, at oar number four, has been
improving daily, while Wooster at num
ber seven is showing good form. Olm
stead. Snow, Adams and Brieson
are the strongest men on the freshman
boat: however, Sayre, Hancock, Maloney
and McKinnon are working up into good
form.

Public Exhibition is Success.
The exhibition crew rexes at the Red
wood channel yesterday proved to be a
big success, both in the crowd and in
the. 1 working of the three shells. There
was one real race, besides a number of
workout sprints before a crowd of sev
eral hunrded people. In the race, the
\ arsity started, giving the other boats
a handicap of several langths. passed
them, and was about three lengths ahead
at the end of the half mile.
When (lie Varsity shell started sprint
ing. it fairly leaped out of the water.
Spectators commented on the fact that
this year s boat is already working better
than any they have put out at Stanford.
Coach Rogers said that the men did good
work, but did not come up to their usual
style, <111 account of thf bad wind and
lough waters.
Men Make Fine Showing
Captain Watts and Roy King are the
standbys of the \ arsity boat. They arc i
the only two old Varsity crew men from j
the 1917 boat. With King setting the [
pace at stroke and Watts sitting back!
of him jit number seven, the Varsity!
oarsmen row like clockwork.
According to "Husky" Guerena, who)
has been helping with the daily work
outs during the last few days. Fred
Adams is a second Newton. Newton
is a big lumber jack, who rowed with
Washington for three years and was
picked for the all American crew. Gue
rena -aid that Cash Davis is rowing as
smooth an oar as he has ever seen
pulled. Wilbur. Williamson, Moore and
McGillisray. who rowed with the Var
sity yesterday, are all coming along in
excellent shape.
Other oßats Fast
Tin second Varsity and freshman
shells are unusually fast and well balan
ced with good oarsmen. The positions

the men rowed in yesterday, do not
necessarily mean that they are to have
those seat- for the big race. With the
