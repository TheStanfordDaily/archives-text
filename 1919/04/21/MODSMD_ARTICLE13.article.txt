# A 						WEEK OF PLEDGING
## 
### 
<lie realization that the Liberty Loan drive starts na
aiTlx tionally and locally today comes the additional realiza
tion that Monday of this week opens what is destined to he re
membered as a week of financial pledging. Liberty Loan buttons
and Memorial contributions are to take the place of the pledge pins generally
characteristic of rushing weeks. To say that a week of constant demands
upon the pocketbook is a strenuous one upon the college student is no ground
less assumption; but it is no more difficult upon the college students than it
is upon the community in general.
We are confronted with the task of supporting the worthy enterprises
that demand support. We have two of them this week. Starting with the
national demand for Liberty Loan subscriptions and ending with the local
demand for support for the Memorial fund, each calls for support and each
should get support.
Financially, the Fifth Liberty Loan, the Victory issue, offers the best in
ducement that any of the issues has offered heretofore. It is expected in
moneyed circles that the loan will be greatly oversubscribed through large
subscriptions. To commercial houses, the three and four-year notes of the
United States government offer greater inducement in the matter of interest
and security than the savings banks throughout the country. But it is the
small investor that Uncle Sam really seeks to interest in his financial scheme.
A fifth issue bond, exempt from taxation, paying 4%% interest and payable in
1922-23, backed by the word of the treasury of the United States government,
is a financial investment that should not be overlooked.
Thus in calling for support for a Libery Loan issue, it should be unnec
essary to appeal to the patriotism of American citizens. It should be only
necessary to show them the beneficial character of the government's notes,
of the desirability that the small investor partake of the issue that is sure to
be grabbed up by the larger subscribers.
In starting a week of financial pledging, let us make the right investment
from the jump. Victory notes of the fifth issue offer exceptional opportuni
ties that should not be overlooked.
