## Stanford is Selected With Twelve Universities of the Country 
### 
Following a brief announcement
Thursday that three fiiold artillery of
ficers had arrived to prepare for an
artillery unit at Stanford, there came
today the news that the government
was preparing to establish here at a
cost of $250,000 an artillery school
that will be the finest in the West.
The school will open next fall.
Twelve colleges, of which Stanford
is one, throughout the United States
have been selected by the government
for the purpose of establishing these
artillery schools. Stanford, because of
its situation in the country, is pecu
liarly fitted for such a school, accord
ing to Colonel Leroy P. Collins, F. A..
11. S. A., who is here now working out
the plans.
A staff of five artillery officers has
been assigned to the school at Stan
ford. It consists of Colonel Collins,
Major Howard Eager, Captain Edward
A. Flanders, and two more officers
who will arrive in the near future,
Captain Paul G. Putty and Paul 11. I)e
llart. Captain Flanders is an old
Stanford man of the class of 1906.
The equipment for the artillery
school will cost over .$250,000. There
will be one battery of four guns, com
pletely equipped with gun carriages,
range finders, fire control, and all
kinds of optical instruments. Besides
this, there will be four guns of for
eign make, a French 55 milimetre, a
55 G. P. F., a French 75, and a British
75. This will make a total of nine
guns. These may be expected at Stan
ford in the very near future. They
will be placed on exhibition on their
