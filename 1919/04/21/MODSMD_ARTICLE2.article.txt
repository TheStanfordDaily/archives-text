# Artillery Unit to be Started Here
## Stanford is Selected With Twelve Universities of the Country 
### 
Following a brief announcement
Thursday that three fiiold artillery of
ficers had arrived to prepare for an
artillery unit at Stanford, there came
today the news that the government
was preparing to establish here at a
cost of $250,000 an artillery school
that will be the finest in the West.
The school will open next fall.
Twelve colleges, of which Stanford
is one, throughout the United States
have been selected by the government
for the purpose of establishing these
artillery schools. Stanford, because of
its situation in the country, is pecu
liarly fitted for such a school, accord
ing to Colonel Leroy P. Collins, F. A..
11. S. A., who is here now working out
the plans.
A staff of five artillery officers has
been assigned to the school at Stan
ford. It consists of Colonel Collins,
Major Howard Eager, Captain Edward
A. Flanders, and two more officers
who will arrive in the near future,
Captain Paul G. Putty and Paul 11. I)e
llart. Captain Flanders is an old
Stanford man of the class of 1906.
The equipment for the artillery
school will cost over .$250,000. There
will be one battery of four guns, com
pletely equipped with gun carriages,
range finders, fire control, and all
kinds of optical instruments. Besides
this, there will be four guns of for
eign make, a French 55 milimetre, a
55 G. P. F., a French 75, and a British
75. This will make a total of nine
guns. These may be expected at Stan
ford in the very near future. They
will be placed on exhibition on their
arrival.
A complete motorized enuinment.
including a five-ton tractor, will be
furnished by the government to go
with the school. In connection with
this, a course in gas engines will be
included in the curriculum of the
school.
An appropriation will probably be
made by the Board of Trustees to
erect gun sheds, stables, and barracks.
Over sixty horses are to be used in
connection with the artillery school.
The barracks to be erected are for
the thirty men in the enlisted detach
ment who will be sent to Stanford by
the government.
A brief sketch of the course was
made by Colonel Collins. The course
will last for four years, at the end of
which a reserve commission in the
United States army will be Riven to
the successful candidate. The work
taken at Stanford during the regular
school year will be more of a theo
retical nature. The practical side of
the work will be taken up at three
summer camps.
At present it is the plan to offer
four hours of university credit for
work in the artillery school. The
work will consist of three hours of
lecture work and five three-quarter
hour periods of physical training. In
the middle part of the course horse
manship will be substituted in the
place of ordinary physical training
work.
Commutation of rations amounting
to about 40 cents a day will be given
the members of the school. Those
who attend the summer camps will
probably get the usual candidate's pay
of $00 a month. The curriculum of
the artillery school has been so ar
ranged that it will not. interfere
vitally with the usual University work.
Men who sip;n up for military train
ing with the University will he given
their option of joining either the in
fantry of the R. O. T. C. or the field
artillery unit. In the artillery school
no drills or military formations will
bo rcqquired during the academic
year, other than that which may be
necessary in connection with physical
training. Complete information an to
the field artillery unit and the course
of training may be had at the It. O
T. C. headquarters, in the Encina gym
nasium.
