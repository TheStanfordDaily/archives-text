# Chappie Delays Publication for Bone Dry Article
## 
### 
Chaparral's "Dry" number will not
j appear until Thursday. The date ori
! ginally set was today, but as an after
thought, the editor decided that such
a weighty document in the fight
against liquor, as the April "Chappie" \
will be, should not be without an
article from the "dry" pen of William
J. Bryan. Consequently, publication
has been held up until Mr. Bryan's
latest arid article, "In Dryest Kan
sas," could arrive.
The size of this issue has been con
siderably increased because of the in
creased advertising space taken by
the grape-juice manufacturers. Some
of the familiar "Meet me at —" ad
vertising will be missing, but this
space will be taken up by the. offers
of contractors to build cellars at short
notice.
The Chaparral management wishes
to kill the rumor that because this is
a "dry" number, the editorials will
lack their usual inspiration. Even
if it is a "dry" number, the price of
inspiration a quart is still not pro
hibitive.
