# STANFORD NINE OUTPLAYS U.C.
## Superior Baseball Defeats California in First Game 
### E.E. Crowe, '21 
BY playing a superior brand of base
ball. the Stanford Varsity defeated
the University of California team Satur
day afternoon by the score of 5 to 3 in
the first game of the Stanford-California
series. Better pitching and better sup
port, aided by hitting in the pinches, won
the game for the Cardinal players. The
second game of tiie series will be played
at Berkeley on Saturday.
Newland, hurling for Stanford, pitched
in the big league form. He allowed the
California hitters to gather only four
safeties and annex one earned run. His
own error counted for two of the Cali
fornia scores, when he threw wild to
the plate on a squeeze play. The Blue
and Gold batters were unable to hit
Newland in the pinches, and excellent
support behind him held down the size
of the Berkeley run column.
Stanford Gets Three Hits
Stanford got three hits and five runs
off the deliveries of Ellison, Trefts and
Murchio. Errors in the California in
field kept the pitchers in the hole, and
as the Stanford stickmen were hitting
Ellison, Coach Zamlock jerked his star
tvvirler in fav(»r of Trefts. Trefts tried
the game for a while, and then gave
away to Murcrio, who finished up the
fracas.
The California infield proved to be

the weak point in the Berkeley com
bination. Three errors were made alto
gether, and two of this number were
made by the infield at critical points.
The Stanford team made four bobbles,
but Newland's wild throw was the only
serious one.
Stanford Scores First
Stanford scored the first run of the
game in the first inning when Lilly
walked, and went around to third when
Ellison dropped Steven's pop blunt.
Ellison threw wild to first and Lilly
crossed the plate, but the umpire sent
him back to third because he had run
into Kallum, who was coaching at third.
Lilly scored when Kline hit to Ellison.
Stanford scored again in the third on a
wild throw to first by Lais on Lilly's
ground ball. Lilly went third and scored
on Steven's sacrifice Hy. The third run
came in the fourth inning when Ellison
hit Bundv, who went to first, and then
to third when Ellison threw wild to
first in an attempt to catch him off
the bag. Bundy scored on the squeeze
play with Caughey at the bat.
The fourth and fifth runs came across
the plate in the fifth inning. Stevens
singled and went to second on Kline's
infield out. He scored on Whites' wild
throw to first 011 Galloway's ground
ball. Galloway stole second and scored
on Kallam's single. Kallam was caught
at second.
California Scores on Error
California scored in the second, when
Butler singled and stole second, and
went to third on Dexter's Infield out.
Champion walked and stole second.
Both men scored when Newland threw
the ball wild to tlie plate on Lais' bunt
on the squeeze play signal. The third
and final run came in the eighth inning.
Smith, the California lirst sacker, who
has been hitting bad all season, con
nected with one of Newland's curves for
a home run to left center field.
Stanford Team Superior
Coach Evans' club outplayed the Blue
and Gold men. Newland pitched better
ball than his rivals, and Bundy threw
to bases better than he has at any time
this season. Bundy's work behind the
bat is responsible to a large extent for
Newland's victory. The red-capped play
ers hit when hits meant runs and played
better defensive ball than California.
Stanford has not won a baseball series
from California since 1913, when "Zeb"
Terry's team annexed the big series.
From the exhibition put up Saturday,
the Varsity team looks better than the
California team, and stands the best
chance of winning this year and breaking
the long string of California victoies:
