# STANFORD NINE OUTPLAYS U.C.
## Superior Baseball Defeats California in First Game 
### E.E. Crowe, '21 
BY playing a superior brand of base
ball. the Stanford Varsity defeated
the University of California team Satur
day afternoon by the score of 5 to 3 in
the first game of the Stanford-California
series. Better pitching and better sup
port, aided by hitting in the pinches, won
the game for the Cardinal players. The
second game of tiie series will be played
at Berkeley on Saturday.
Newland, hurling for Stanford, pitched
in the big league form. He allowed the
California hitters to gather only four
safeties and annex one earned run. His
own error counted for two of the Cali
fornia scores, when he threw wild to
the plate on a squeeze play. The Blue
and Gold batters were unable to hit
Newland in the pinches, and excellent
support behind him held down the size
of the Berkeley run column.
Stanford Gets Three Hits
Stanford got three hits and five runs
off the deliveries of Ellison, Trefts and
Murchio. Errors in the California in
field kept the pitchers in the hole, and
as the Stanford stickmen were hitting
Ellison, Coach Zamlock jerked his star
tvvirler in fav(Â»r of Trefts. Trefts tried
the game for a while, and then gave
away to Murcrio, who finished up the
fracas.
The California infield proved to be

the weak point in the Berkeley com
bination. Three errors were made alto
gether, and two of this number were
made by the infield at critical points.
The Stanford team made four bobbles,
but Newland's wild throw was the only
serious one.
Stanford Scores First
Stanford scored the first run of the
game in the first inning when Lilly
walked, and went around to third when
Ellison dropped Steven's pop blunt.
Ellison threw wild to first and Lilly
crossed the plate, but the umpire sent
him back to third because he had run
into Kallum, who was coaching at third.
Lilly scored when Kline hit to Ellison.
Stanford scored again in the third on a
wild throw to first by Lais on Lilly's
ground ball. Lilly went third and scored
on Steven's sacrifice Hy. The third run
came in the fourth inning when Ellison
hit Bundv, who went to first, and then
to third when Ellison threw wild to
first in an attempt to catch him off
the bag. Bundy scored on the squeeze
play with Caughey at the bat.
The fourth and fifth runs came across
the plate in the fifth inning. Stevens
singled and went to second on Kline's
infield out. He scored on Whites' wild
throw to first 011 Galloway's ground
ball. Galloway stole second and scored
