# JOFFRE CONTEST NOW AWAITS MEDAL FROM PARIS
## DEBATERS ARE ALARMED Gold Trophy, Alarm Clock in Size, to Be Given Best Speaker 
### 
STANFORD debaters arc somewhat
worried over the fact that the
Joffre Medal, to be presented to the
best speaker of the Stanford-California
trios, next Friday night, has not yet
arrived from France. The big trophy
is made each year in Paris, as provided
by the late Baron de Coubertan, and is
sent each year to the university at which
the contest is held. In diameter it is
about as large as an alarm clock, and
contains a gold equivalent of over $100,
as it is 24-karat fine.
California has selected a team com
posed of Miss Mildred Littlem, J. J.
Posner, and W. M. Green, all of whom
have debated in intercollegiate argu
ments. and all worked on the Joffre
squad last year, though Miss Littlem did
not speak in the contest.
Coach McClintock considers the Stan
ford team this year a well-qualified one,
including two men, H. G. Blote,' 18, and
G. J. Knight, '19, who have not only
participated in many intercollegiate de
bating contests, but who have had much
valuable experience in practical public
speaking. W. F. Lciser, '21, is the third
man of (lie combination, and according
to the coach, should be able to more
than hold down his end of the debate.
The squads have for two months pre
pared on the general question, "The
Future Colonial Policy of France." and
will argue on some particular question
on this topic which will be given them
at 6 o'clock, Friday evening. M. Julien
Neltner, French consul-general of San
Francisco, will preside at the contest,
while three particularly able judges have
been secured to determine the medal
winner. One speaker only, "the most
skillful debater," wints the "Joffre Med
aille."
