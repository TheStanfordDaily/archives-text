# COMMITTEE OF FIFTY TO START MEMORIAL DRIVE AT ASSEMBLY TOMORROW
## 
### 
PLEDGES were taken from the student committee of fifty as the opening
feature of the student campaign for the Memorial Fund, at a meeting of
the committee held last night in the Union. Results showed that an average
of about $33 per person has been pledged which came to a total of $1015. With
this as a starter, the committee has every hope of a big assembly tomorrow
morning which should result in an enthusiastic response from the student body.
Respect for Service Stars to Be Shown
The fund for the Memorial Building is one of the biggest opportunities which
the University has ever undertaken in the name of Stanford spirit. For this
reason .those most vitally interested in the success of this drive, are very anxious
that the students of the University come out to the assembly more as as a sign of
respect for those men who gave their lives in service than from any other motive.
Professor Cathcart Forceful Speaker
Every effort has been made by the committee in arranging the program to
make the assembly as interesting as possible. Professor M. A. Cathcart will speak
for the faculty and the students 011 what this Memorial will mean to the men
and women of the University. Professor Cathcart has been intimately connected
with all the work which has been done in connection with the Memorial, and
he is well qualified to address the student body.
Students to Speak
Miss Ruth Chandler, . '19, will speak for the women of the University and
will try to express the sentiments of the women as well as their attitude toward
the coming campaign. L. E. Rogers, '18, and F. R. King, '19, will represent
the men 011 the campus and will give short addresses on subjects pertinent to the
Memorial.
The group representatives on the student committee of fifty will be held
responsible for the attendance of their group at the assembly. It is the hope
of Rogers as chairman that the hearty cooperation of the students will obviate
any necessity for pressure in this connection.
