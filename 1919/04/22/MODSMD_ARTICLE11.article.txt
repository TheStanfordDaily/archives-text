# CAFETERIA WILL FEATURE BELGIAN BENEFIT SATURDAY
## 
### 
Supper and dancing will feature the
benefit that the Delta Gamma sorority
will give next Saturday night from
5:30 to 8 o'clock. Food will be served
cafeteria style, and there will be
dancing during and after dinner. Good
music and good eats are being planned
by the committees in charge. The
time is early enough, so that cam
pus and Palo Alto people can come,
and can later attend" eveÂ«ins dances
and other affairs. However, there will
be dancing later for those who wish
to stay after 8 o'clock.
The benefit is for the Belgian babies
which the sorority have undertaken
to support. Last year a carnival ben
fit was given and a mile-of-dimes cam
paign was inaugurated which swelled
the fund greatly. This year Delta
Gamma hopes to raise as much, if not
more, money for the fund, that the
children in Belgium may still have the
food and clothing that the sorority
provides, and that the children's home
in Ossendrecht, Holland, may be still
maintained.
