# Accident Delays the Delivery of D.P.A.
## 
### 
Owing to the power getting out of
order, the issue of the Daily Palo Alto
for Monday was delayed, and therefore
few of the papers were delivered. Any
one wishing a paper can get one by
calling for it at the Daily office, or
sending some freshman after it.
