# NO EXCUSE TO FAIL

### 
the student drive for funds for the building of the Memorial
Hall is to succeed, the first steps in the drive must go over
8 with enthusiastic response. This was the decision reached by
l ' le committee in charge of the campaign for funds, when it
was decided that if the Assembly Hall is not crowded tomor
row morning when the big appeal is to be made, there is little or no
chance of raising the minimum of $50,000
Admitting that for some it might be too early to demand immediate response
to the appeal for funds, on the grounds that they have not become sufficiently
enthused with the project, or have not become sufficiently aware of the purpose
and ultimate plans, there still remains the truth that here is no excuse for any
to neglcct an opportunity to find out about he Memorial and to absorb some
of this enthusiasm.
The drive is to be purely voluntary and contributions are to be asked, not
demanded. The whole spirit of the drive is to be a voluntary one. Surely there
is no excuse for any to neglect to learn about the drive. The student assembly
planned for tomorrow morning furnishes opportunity to learn first hand of the
project. The project will not call for support until it is thoeoughly understood
and appreciated. But the project does demand a right to be heard by the students
of the University. Not alone is a right to be heard demanded, but a right to be
heard by everybody, irrespective of present personal opinions on the nature or
plans of the Memorial, is demanded. The least that the students can do is to
find out what the speakers and committee ar eonly too anxious to tell them,
find out what the speakers and committee are only too anxious to tell them,
but to fail to attend the Assembly tomorrow and to learn of the Memorial has
no possible excuse.
