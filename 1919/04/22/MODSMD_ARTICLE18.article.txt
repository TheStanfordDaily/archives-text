						STANFORD WELCOME
## 
### 
the return today of the 363 d and 347 th regiments of the
WWTf 91st Division, Stanford justly responds to the warmth
¥ — w"*'-*". of the reception and welcome given the Wild West
J' I fighters upon their return to San Francisco. To fail in joining the
larger community in welcoming the men who performed so great
a share in the success of the -American armies would he to fail in giving credit
to where credit is due. Stanford then justly welcomes back those who return
now to the west after the months of actual fighting.
But not alone is this Stanford welcome an echo of the San Francisco recep
tion; it is something more, for Stanford counts in regimental rosters of officers
and men many who formerly attended the University. While welcoming all with
the same warmth and feeling, Stanford cannot help but be justly proud of being
able to welcome back once more to the west and to the Farm the Stanford men
who helped to make the 91st one of the famous fighting divisions of the war.
