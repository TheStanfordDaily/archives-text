## 
### 
Junior Prom tickets were placed on
sale yesterday at the bookstore and a
considerable number have already been
sold. The price of the tickets is $5.
The committee who have the Prom in
charge are authority for the following
statement:
"You may have seen the glories of
art and architecture of river and moun
tain. You have seen the glorious Cali
fornia sunrise, and the rnoon set over
the lake. But the fairest vision on
which your eyes will ever rest, will be
the Junior Prom. Beautiful as a flower,
will be the decorations, wonderful will
be the music, and slick will lie the floor.
Terrible will it lie for those who do not
go, while the lucky 130 couples will
never forget its wonders. The sun's
heat will give out in ten thousand years
or more, but it's nothing to worry about, j
So, too, that $5 the Junior Prom is to
cost, will not cause anyone to prema
turely seek his grave."
According to the committee a meeting
is being held today to determine whether
or not flowers and taxies will be in
order. Indications at present point to
the doing away with this usual and un
necessary custom. The decision reached
will be given tomorrow.
