## 
### 
Frank B. Johnston, '17, sent the fol
lowing letter yesterday to the D. P.
A.:
Bendorf, Germany, March 30, '19.
Editor D. P. A.:
Enclosing copy of first 9t.li Infantry
paper. Probably from now on the
regiment will have a paper as long
as it lives. Will send you a copy
weekly from now on in case any of
our news might interest you.
Yours,
FRANK B. JOHNSTON, '17.
"The 9th Infantry Cootie" was the
title of the paper enclosed by Johns
ton. It is edited on the banks of the
Rhine, and appears oft Saturday. Its
motto is well in keeping with the title
of "Cootie." It is called the closest
thing to a soldier, the motto being
"It strikes unawares and irrespective
of rank." This paper boasts of being
the first and only regimental news
paper in the army of occupation.
