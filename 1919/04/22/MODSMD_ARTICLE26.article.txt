# Y.W.C.A. SELLS "EATS" TO SWELL FUNDS FOR CLUB HOUSE
## 
### 
All (lay today the Social Service
committee of the Y. W. C. A. served
sandwiches, cake and fruit to the girls
in the rest room in the English build
ing. A small sum was charged for
a slice of cake, a sandwich or an or
ange, and the proceeds of the day's
work were turned over to the Wom
en's Club House fund.
The sorority houses and Roble Hall
contributed the food, so no expense
was incurred. Mrs. Ralph Mc.Gee,
the Y. W. C. A. secretary, and Miss
Evelyn Flowers, '20, chairman of the
Social Service committee, assisted by
the other members of the committee,
were in charge.
Bei re the war sandwiches were
served every day by the Y. W. in the
rest room, and now the committee
hopes to be able to serve something
of this nature two days a weekâ€”
probably Tuesdays and Thursdays.
The purpose of doing this is to bring
the girls in closer touch with each
other and to help swell the clubhouse
fund.
