# Walt Whitman Takes a Ride to Palo Alto
## 
### 
The Palo Al£o Streetcar! Our fearful
trip is done,
The car has weather'd every curve
the campus now is won,
The Quad is near, the chimes we hear,
the passengers all exulting,
While follow eyes the steady keel, this
car so grim and daring:
But O heart! Pay as you Enter!
A nickle and a penny red
Where at the box the Motorman lies
Fallen cold and dead.
(From overexertion.)
O Motorman! O Motorman! Rise up
and hear the bells:
Rise up—for you we give a royal
cheer —for you our glad heart
thrills;
For you brought us back in an hour
and a half —despite the awful
crowding!
For you they call, the swaying mass,
their eager faces turning.
Hear, Motorman! Dear Man!
This arm beneath your head!
Such wonderful time you have made
That you've fallen cold and dead.
(It might have been.)
