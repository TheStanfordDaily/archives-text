# "Strangler" Lewis May Wrestle Here
## Locals Hold Competitive Matches, "Y" Spreads Feed for Team 
### 
Varsity wrestlers traveled to San
Francisco last Saturday night and met
the team of the city "Y", with the re
sult that Stanford loiit three out of the
five bouts held on the organization's
mats. Stanford sent up ten men.
The Y. M. C. A. furnished some good
competition for the local wrestlers in
the matches, after which they treated
the Stanford men loyally to a "feed."
There were insufficient city men to meet
all of the Cardinal men, and accordingly
Coach Jones worked some of his men in
separate matches.
In the first bout Sims defeated Bra
zil by the use of the wrist lock, the hold
proving fatal to the later's chance of
winning the bout, in the 135-pound class.
Kakamoto and Gonzales furnished good
match in the 110 and 115 class. In the
matches with the "Y" men, Egami
threw his San Francisco opponent in his
usual style of wrestling. Erickson had
a clean walkaway in the 135-pound class.
Lind lost his match in the 145 class,
due to a fluke hold in the last part of
an exciting match. Demond wrestled
in the 158 class, and being his first time
out in an official match, lost thru inex
perience to his opponent. In the un
limited class, Drake of Stanford and
Ardouin of the "Y" put on a clean,
hard-fought match, the latter winning
a fall. According to Coach Jones, the
meet with the city "Y" was a predit to
Stanford.
In the Stanford-California freshmen
meet planned for the week of the Big
Track Meet, there will be no competi
tion in the 110-pound class. The line
up for the matches has not been chosen,
but some world-beaters are now in
evidence at the local gallery, who will
no doubt make the team.
Sims is probably putting up the best
fight for the freshmen. Improvement
j has been noted from the lirst in his use
'of the two winning holds, the wrist lock
and the scissors. Sims has shown much
interest in the sport and with his reg
ular practice should develop into a lirst
: class Varsity man.
Word has just been received from
wrestling headquarters at the Enema
gym, that there is a possibility that
Ardouin of the San Francisco Y. M.
C. A. may accompany "Straglcr Lewis
to Stanford within a weeks for several
exhibition matches. The matches will
in all probability be held at the Gym.
Lewis is a contender for the heavy
weight championship and should be a
big drawing card to Stanford fans and
fannies, in case the "big" man from the
city decides to take a journey down the
peninsula.

: class Varsity man.
Word has just been received from
wrestling headquarters at the Enema
gym, that there is a possibility that
Ardouin of the San Francisco Y. M.
C. A. may accompany "Straglcr Lewis
to Stanford within a weeks for several
exhibition matches. The matches will
in all probability be held at the Gym.
Lewis is a contender for the heavy
weight championship and should be a
big drawing card to Stanford fans and
fannies, in case the "big" man from the
city decides to take a journey down the
peninsula.
Varsity wrestlers traveled to San
Francisco last Saturday night and met
the team of the city "Y", with the re
sult that Stanford loiit three out of the
five bouts held on the organization's
mats. Stanford sent up ten men.
The Y. M. C. A. furnished some good
competition for the local wrestlers in
the matches, after which they treated
the Stanford men loyally to a "feed."
There were insufficient city men to meet
all of the Cardinal men, and accordingly
Coach Jones worked some of his men in
separate matches.
In the first bout Sims defeated Bra
zil by the use of the wrist lock, the hold
proving fatal to the later's chance of
winning the bout, in the 135-pound class.
Kakamoto and Gonzales furnished good
match in the 110 and 115 class. In the
matches with the "Y" men, Egami
threw his San Francisco opponent in his
usual style of wrestling. Erickson had
a clean walkaway in the 135-pound class.
Lind lost his match in the 145 class,
due to a fluke hold in the last part of
an exciting match. Demond wrestled
in the 158 class, and being his first time
out in an official match, lost thru inex
perience to his opponent. In the un
limited class, Drake of Stanford and
Ardouin of the "Y" put on a clean,
hard-fought match, the latter winning
a fall. According to Coach Jones, the
meet with the city "Y" was a predit to
Stanford.
In the Stanford-California freshmen
meet planned for the week of the Big
Track Meet, there will be no competi
tion in the 110-pound class. The line
up for the matches has not been chosen,
but some world-beaters are now in
evidence at the local gallery, who will
no doubt make the team.
Sims is probably putting up the best
fight for the freshmen. Improvement
j has been noted from the lirst in his use
'of the two winning holds, the wrist lock
and the scissors. Sims has shown much
interest in the sport and with his reg
ular practice should develop into a lirst
: class Varsity man.
