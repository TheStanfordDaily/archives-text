# 1922 NINE TO PLAY FOR CHAMPIONSHIP
## 
### 
With the series at stake, the Sanford
and California freshman baseball t â–  ims
will battle at Berkeley tomorrow after
noon. This game will be the deciding
name of the series, as both teams have
won one game and lost one. The Stan
ford babes won the lirst game, while the
Bruin took the second contest by a ninth
inning rally.
When the teams meet it will be the
lirst time in over ten years that the
freshmen have stood such a good
chance of winning a series. The two
teams are evenly matched and it is just
the team that gets the benefit of the
breaks that will carry off the series.
Outfields About Even
The loss of the second game of the
series was through the ragged work of
the infield. Mangin pitched good ball
and allowed but seven hits and three
earned runs. Six infield errors threw
the game away. The infield had to be
shifted when "Shorty" Gomes was hit
in the mouth with a pitched ball in the
last San Jose practice game. This shift
threw the usually smooth working com
bination off its feet and they blew up
in the last half of the ninth inning and
gave the game to the Bruins.
Hawkes, who usually plays an all
star game at first, allowed one to go
through him, when a hit meant run.
Wallace could not get used to second
base and so when lie got the chance to
retire California in the ninth on a double
play he dropped the ball. Davies, the
man of the combination, played the best
ball in the infield; though he was credit
ed with one error. Rousselot play
ed a good game at third, but made his
error at the most crueical moment of
the game.
The California infield worked like a
well-oiled machine in the last game.
Geary, at first, who was credited with
two errors in the first game, was pulling
them in from all directions. Eells, the
short-stop, also made up for his errors
of the first game. Ferguson and Hut
ton, roud-out an infield, that is not
superior to the Cardinal infield when it
is working right, but'is one hundred per
cen betted than babes were last
Saturday.
Card Infield Ragged
Stevenson, Spires, and Holmes form
a combination in the outfield that al
most equals the Cubs' collection of
gardeners. The total number of hits
made by the California gardeners were
two, and were not good for any runs.
The Stanford outfielders made one hit
which was good for one run.
in fielding, the two sets are almost
even. Out of four chances, the Cali
fornia men got by without any errors.
The Cardinal gardeners had but one
chance to show what they could do; but
the throwing to plate of Stevenson and
Holmes on hits, cut off runs
Cardinal Pitchers Best
Since the beginning of the series.
Coach Cass has developed several good
hurlers from among the candidates.
Shamberger and Sibley, who pitched the
first game, were almost entirely made
by Cass' coaching, and Mangin and Neer
have improved greatly under his direc
tions. While the cubs have made more
hits than the farm boys in each game,
the Cardinal pitchers have been showing
the most stuff.
Holston has developed into one of
the best catchers that has been seen on
a freshman team for several years. His
pegging to second in the game Satur
day kept many of the Blue and Gold
players clinging close to first base. His
hitting is easily on a par with the stick
work of C.line. California's catcher.
The team will line-up as follows:
Stevenson, cf; Wallace. 2b; Spires, rf;
Holmes, If; Davies, ss; Rousselot, 3b;
Holston. c; Hawkes, lb; Shamberger,
Mangin, Sibley, or Neer, p.
