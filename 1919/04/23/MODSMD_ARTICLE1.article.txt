# FROSH TO MEET BLUE AND GOLD BABES SATURDAY
## WILL USE LOCAL OVAL Shlaudeman, Maier, and Parmelee Are Expected Point Winners 
### 
PROSPECTS for a strong showing
by the freshman track team in the
meet against California first-year men
nc\t Saturday are growing brighter
every day. Although the prospects of
a freshman victory over the Blue and
Gold is slight, the 1922 squad has been
coming through the last few weeks with
as good a show of interest as could
be expected from any freshman class.
The main weakness with the first
year track team is lack of condition due
to their late start in the training season,
but their showing against Lowell and
Polytechnic high schools last Saturday
shows that they are developing several
men who may spring big surprises on
the California "babes''.
According to reports from across the
bay, the Blue and Gold freshmen have
one of the strongest teams in years and
are able to try conclusions with their
Varsity with considerable success. If
these reports arc true, the best the Car
dinal first-year men can expect is to
make a good showing against their
rivals.
"Bob" Schlaudeman, '22, will prob
ably be the most dangerous man on the
Cardinal team and can be counted on
to annex a good number of points for
the freshmen. He is the same sort of
athlete as Greene of Stanford and Mer
chant of California, and may be big
point winners of this year's meet.
Maier is showing increased form in
the mile and should be able to give the
California distance men a hard run for
first place. Other sure point winners
for Stanford arc Minshall, Overacker,
Larsen, and Parmelee.
I lasselbach, Lupton, and 1 lendrixson
are California's strongest bets in the
sprints and hurdles. The Blue and Gold
freshmen are banking on Nesbit to buck
against Schlaudeman in the field events.
All of their sprinters are reported to be
able to do around 10 and 2/5 esconds
in the hundred.
