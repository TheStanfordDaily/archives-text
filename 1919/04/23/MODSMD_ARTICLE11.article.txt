# BEAR'S BATTING ORDER IS BEING CHANGED THIS WEEK
## ZAMLOCK IS CONFIDENT Cardinal Team Has Practice Game With St. Mary's This Afternoon 
### 
Coach Carl Zamlock of the California
Varsity is confident of winning Satur
day's game from the Cardinal team, ac
cording to reports - from the Berkeley
diamond. Zamlock is working his club
hard this week and is trying to correct
certain faults in his lineup.
Meyers, the center-fielder, has shifted
from fourth in the batting order to
third, and Butler, the best hitter on the
Blue and Gold team, is hitting fourth.
Other changes in tlie batting order will
probably be made before the week.
Ellison will probably start the game
Saturday with either Trefts or Muchio
a possibility. Coach "Bob" Evans will
probably start Newlands against the
Bears, and Bundy behind the bat. If.
Pclouze is working, Evans may start
him in the box instead of Newland.
The Stanford Varsity played the St.
Mary's Varsity this afternoon at Oak
land. In the morning the Varsity went
through a stiff workout on the Cali
fornia diamond in order to get familiar
with the enemv srrounds.
