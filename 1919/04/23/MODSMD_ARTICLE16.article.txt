# PERPETUATE A RECORD

the assembly this morning there van no longer be
:m " ou ' )t as *° t ' lc> s P' r ' t an( l t' lc motive of tl«e drive
5 for funds for the Memorial. Probably no undcr
taking within the memory of the present generation of college students
has been as big, as difficult, and as promising of so much in return
for all effort and funds'expended, with the exception of the war itself, as the
undertaking for the Memorial. Something permanent and lasting is in the
making, and it is a great privilege to be classed as constructors of a lasting
undertaking.
To succeed, it has been pointed out, the drive must start from the first with
the entire cooperation of the students of the University. Present pledges are
needed and must be had; present pledges for future sums of maximum amount.
There is no demand, there is merely a request for funds.
The start of this drive today and tomorrow will test the merit of Stanford
men and women; it will test their response to an undertaking that is essentially
worthy of more than it will be possible for us to give. It is up to us, however,
to give it as much as is possible. Tf the students themselves do not respond,
what chance of success is there when the ultimate appeal comes to the alumni
and faculty? The way must be paved by those most greatly concerned.
Let us not fail when we are put to the test. We know Stanford's war
record; it is indeed this knowledge that has prompted the Memorial. It will not
do then in the face of Stanford's war record to fail in tribute to this war record.
Nothing that can be asked is too much; nothing that can be given is too much.
It is only what is due and what voluntarily we feel we can and ought to give to
commemorate and perpetuate a record.
