# PASMORE SISTERS GIVE BRILLIANT MUSICAL PROGRAM
## 
### 
Last night's musical program which
replaced the usual Tuesday evening lec
ture afforded campus people a musical
offering of exceptional interest and
value. The hearty appreciation with
which the numbers were encored evi
denced the approval of the audience.
The audience, although not as large as
the program merited, proved very appre
ciative.
From 1 lie lirst note until the last
strain had died away the Pasmore Trio
gave a splendid example of their ability
in interpretation, and showed with fine
effect the power, clarity and emotion
which they seemed to call to their aid
at will.
At the piano Mrs. Suzanne Pasmore-
Brooks played with a style that showed
an excellent technical equipment and a
firm, clear touch, as well as an intimate
knowledge of the difficult intricacies of
classical music.
Miss Dorothy Pasmore, handling the
'cello, endeared herself to the audience
by her expressive tone-work, bringing
out with wonderful clarity the brilliance
and pathos of every piece played.
As a violinist, Mrs. William Poyner
played with a musical surcness and a
poetic feeling that added much to the
evening. Her delightfully clear, clean
I technique was particularly appreciated
by her hearers.
