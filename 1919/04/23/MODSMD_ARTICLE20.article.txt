## 
### 
■ •
Plans have been made for a women's
'>aseball game with Mills, to be played
it re on Saturday morning, May 26. This
will be the first baseball game of the
season, and since the team is disorgan
zed at present, it is necessary for those
who intend to come out for this or
other games, to notify Miss Ruth Chand
ler, as early this week as possible. Or
ganization will be effected immediately.
I and a captain and manager elected.

The 14t'e of Senator and Mrs. Stan
ford in Washington, I). C., was natu
rally a very prominent one. They
first went there to reside in 18S5, two
years after the death of young Leland
in Florence, Italy.
During the first part of their stay in
Washington (he Stanfords occupied
the old Beverly Johnson's annex of
the Arlington. Afterwards they leased
the house, No. 710 K street, and made
many changes and improvements in
it. The sumptuous style in which
Mrs. Stanford entertained, won for her
a widespread reputation—even in that
city of brilliant affairs. The Stanford
dinners were always notable events,
and perhaps no banquet in that city
has ever exceeded in elegance the
dinner given in honor of President
and Mrs. Harrison. The Stanfords
and Harrisons were warm friends and
formed a friendship which lasted long
after both families had left Washing
ton.
The famous afternoon receptions
given each winter were always crowd
ed. Here the humblest visitor was
made as welcome as the most favored,
and the resources of the entire estab
lishment were at the pleasure of the
great throngs of people who always
came. The story is told that Senator
Stanford always made it a rule to get
home early from 'the Senate on these
days. He took the same pleasure in

having crowds of strangers enjoying
what he had to offer them, as if he
had personal acquaintance with each.
Mr. Stanford thought Washington
the prettiest city in the world and
often talked of the developments that
he himself had observed since lie had
taken residence there. His only piece
of property was his stables, situated
on L street near Eighteenth, where he
kept a number of very fine blooded
driving horses.
