Professor Catchcart Principal
Speaker
Professor A. M. Cathcart of the Law
department was the principal speaker
of the morning. As an alumnus of Stan
ford and not on the committee of fifty,
Professor Cathcart wa fitted
to give a general aspect of the proposed
Memorial. He spoke of the Memorial
as "a challenge to American patriotism
and Stanford loyalty".' The building is
to be a gathering place fo;- Stanford
men and women on un> ersity occasions
which will be consistent with the dignity
of the spirit of the Me norial.
"Shall we forget the magnificent par
ticipation of the American people in the
Great War?" Professor Cathcart asked.
He answered the question by pointing
out lite remarkable work which the men
and women of this country have accom
plished. When the draft was put
through riots were predicted, but the

ten million men upon whom the draft
wa simposed said "No," and they went
forward in the spirit that the job was
theirs and they would do it.
Service of Stanford Men
And Women
Professor Cathcart coninued his ad
dress by poining out what the men and
women of the University have given to
the Great War in service. "Sixty-three
Stanford men gave their lives for the
war. They went out strong, vigorous,
and hardy, yet they were only boys.
Is a memorial to them worth'while?
The greatness of these men is not in the
fact that they died, but in the fact that
they were willing to die. Other Stan
ford men went in the same spirit. The
Stanford Memorial is to that spirit
which carried the. name of Stanford
into the battlefields of France."
In speaking of the women, Professor
Cathcart citcd the Stanford women's
unit as exemplifying the same spirit
among the women as was found at every
turn among the men in the service.
Every Stanford woman if she had had
the chance would have given as much to
the wa ras did the women who went
with the unit.
King Speaks for Students
The most impressive and spontaneous
speech of the assembly's program came
from F. R. King when speaking of the
part that Stanford men had played in
ths war. He told of the graves of Stan
ford men which he had seen in France
and recalled the thoughts which come«to
every person's mind who has lost a dear
friend in the service and most particu
larly those emotions which have come
to the men who have buried comrades.
The Memorial Hall. King said, will
express the best that is in every one of
us as the tribute from the men and
women of the Unicvrsity. The Me
morial Church is the one show spot of
the campus now, and it is the desire
of the Memorial committee that the
Memorial Hall, as representing the
principles which carries the men of Sinn
ford into the service, will be another

building of which Stanford may be
proud.
L. E. Rogers, '18, Speaks
L. E. Rogers. '18, hacirman of the
student committee of fifty, presented
the facts of the campus campaign to
the student body and told what was
expected of the men and women in
pledging. The students of the Uni
versity are expected to assume as their
share of the entire fund $50,000. If this
sum is to be raised, an average has to
be struck of each student pledging an
average of $6 per year for four years.
Many of the student sof the campus will
be able to give much more than this
and others will not be able to give
any at all. Every student on the campus
is asked to give all that he can and no
more.
Miss Josephine Welch, '18, expressed
the spirit which carried the women
through their share of the responsi
bilities of the war and she expressed
the hope that the women of the campus
would back up that spirit by showing
what they could do in this campaign.
