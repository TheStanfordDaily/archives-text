# Bone Dry Issue of Chappie Will Appear Tomorrow
## 
### 
Chemistry, according to a theory ad
vanced in the "Dry" number of Chap
arral. which appears on Quad tomor
row, will be the most popular major
subject in college after the prohibition
amendment goes into effect. "Chap
pie" figures that the "dry" era will he
an age of substitutes, and that the
"chemic," who is always surrounded
with distilling apparatus and who has
pure alcohol always within reach,
stands in a good way of discovering a
proper one.
The cover, which is chiefly con
cerned with Uncle Sam in the act of
wringing out the Great American
Desert, has been drawn by "Bones"
McDermott, '17, and is easily the most
striking thing that has appeared on
"Chappie's" front this year. "Monk"
Antrim, '19, has contributed a remark
able two-page cartoon ihat is "Dedi
cated to the Memory of John Barley
corn."
In the way of sheer nonsense this
April number of "Chappie" excels.
With the return of the "Snoppyquops,"
drawn by "Feg" Murray, 'lf>, a feature
of the Chaparral of two years ago, is
back. The "Snoppyquops" are a myth
ical race of beings that seem to pride
themselves on their fanciful varieties
of form. Another choice bit of non
sense has been contributed by "Sam"
Glikbarg, '19, in his "Crazylogue."
As this is the first issue of "Chap
pie" under the new arrangements
with the International News Co.,
whereby "Chappie" is to go on sale
throughout the United States and
Canada, a special effort has been put
forth by the staff to make the issue a
success. One of the results of this
will be the Increased number of car
toons in the issue. The price will be,
as usual, 25 cents.
