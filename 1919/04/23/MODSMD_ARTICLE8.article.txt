# FRESHMAN NINE TO PLAY BRUIN BABES TODAY
## 
### 
At noon today the freshman base
ball team left the campus for Berke
ley to play the final game of the se
ries with the California freshmen.
This deciding game will be played on
the California field.
Coach Cass and the team are con
fident that they will come home with
the cubs' hide and the first freshman
series in twelve years. Cass has not
decided who will pitch as yet. Man
gin, who pitched last Saturday, is the
probable choice. He showed more
real pitching ability than either Sham
berger or Sibley did in the first game
of the series, and only lost the game
on infield errors. If Mangin is not
able to pitch, Cass will probably send
Sibley or Shamberger into the box.
If Neer shows up well in warming up,
he may get the chance to hurl a few.
The babes will either go against
McHenry or Lowe. In both games
McHenry has been wild and the Stan
for freshmen have had little trouble
in hitting him in pinches. Lowe put
up a good exhibition of baseball in
the three innings that he pitched last
Saturday and so he may start this
game.
