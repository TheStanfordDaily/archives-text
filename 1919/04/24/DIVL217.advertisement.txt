Here's the event that everybody has been waiting for. It will answer the
question that has been on many of our customers' tongues — "What new
ideas have those famous style creators,
THE HOUSE OF KUPPENHEIMER
produced for Spring." The styles are here, now. And we can assure you
that they will far surpass your expectations.
What's the style hit of the season? The Waist-seam models, and we
have a half dozen smart variations to pick from in all the season s fashion
able patterns and beautiful colors. As in past seasons our values are un
equaled.
