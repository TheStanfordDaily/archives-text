# Belgian Benefit Will Feature Good Eats and Dancing
## 
### 
Several houses on the Row have
planned to close their dining' rooms
Saturday night in order that ;i 11 the
members can patronize the Delta Gam
ma benefit for Belgian babies. Good
food and a chance to help support the
poor children of Belgium make an ap
peal that everyone in Palo Alto and on
the campus wishes to answer.
Besides the Mexican dishes which will
be the real feature of the supper, there
will be home-made cakes and pies, to
say nothing of home-cooked meats and
real cofTce. For the more frivolous
there will be dancing during the sup
per hours of 5 to 8:30 o'clock, and
after the hours for food, anyone who
wishes to stay and dance will be urged
to do so.
That there may be more proceeds to
send to the reconstruction workers at
Ossendrecht, Holland, many people have
donated food for the affair. Present
indications point to a 1 arge crowd
Saturday night, and the committee in
charge has been urging everyone to come
early to get a large choice of menu.
