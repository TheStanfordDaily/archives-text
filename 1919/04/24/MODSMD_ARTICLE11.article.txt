# STANFORD TEAM IS READY FOR JOFFRE DEBATE TOMORROW
## IS BIG WESTERN MATCH Blote, Leiser, Knight Will Meet California Team In Assembly Hall 
### 
TOMORROW night in the Assembly
Hall at 8 o'clock Stanford and Cali
fornia meet in the biggest debate west
of the Mississippi, the Jofifre. This con
test is a real sporting *«»st of brains, be
ing an extemporaneous argument on
some phase of the "Gonial policy of
France.
There are but three debates in the
United States of the magnitude of the
Joffre, and both others arc dual de
bates, the medals of which as is the case
in this one, are presented directly by
the Republic of France.
Each university is represented by
three contestants, but the debate itself
is an individual one; that is, the man
or woman who puts up the best line of
argument is picked by the judges as
winner.
Coach McClintock of Stanford has in
Blote, Leiser and Knight three men who
will put up a great fight for Stanford
against the Blue and Gold. All three
men are experienced speakers, and are
prepared to the last notch for the de
bate tomorrow. California, with two
men who were in the Joffre battle last
year and one woman who is heralded as
a sure winner, is no less prepared for
llie big contest.
I o add to the occasion tomorrow,
French Consul-General Neltner from
San Francisco will preside, and will pre
sent the $100 gold medtal to the winner.
In the past Stanford has been rather
unfortunate in the Jnffre debates.
While the Cardinal lias been successful
time after time in a contest in athletics,
the brains of California have usually
resulted in a victory in debate. Last
year, however, Stanford carried off the
medal and will put up a rard fight to
repeat it this year.
The specific question for the debate
will be given out at six o'clock, and
(lie lirst speaker will take the platform
at eight in the Assembly Hall. No
admission is to be charged for the con
test.
