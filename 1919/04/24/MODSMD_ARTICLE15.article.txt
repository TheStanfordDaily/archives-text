# WHAT WAS WRONG?

the news of the fiasco at California and the slaughter
'WfFTTF'PtS®"] ie Stanford "babes" at the hands of the Blue and
112 GdUl, the question naturally presents itself: What was
™ wrong? It is not the defeat that rankles, despite the largeness of
the tally and the unprecedented scoring rccord of the Berkeley nine.
Defeats are probable in all contests, and we are not inclined to weep or cry
after receiving one.
21-0 points clearly that the loser was outplayed. There must, however, have
been something more than mere inability to comc through from the appearance
of the score. That the "babes" did not possess that essential known as Stanford
tight is an unfortunate implication. It has seldom been known before in Stan
ford athletic history that any man playing on the team has become disgusted
enough with the outcome of the game to request the coach to remove him from
the contest. We are not ashamed of the score in last evening's game, providing
the 1922 nine gave all they had ; however, if any men on the team quit, they
are deservig of our heartiest censure. No accusations are made; every man
knows best himself whether he gave his all for his college.
While we arc regretting the loss of one game, let us not forget the Varsity
game at Berkeley Saturday that, if won, will do much to eliminate the sting of
the freshman defeat. Men on the Varsity announced that the stands did a large
share in winning last Saturday's contest; California stands will probably try
their hardest to save the series in the second game. A Cardinal rooting section
is absolutely essential; a ball player's nerves needs steadying and support will do it.
To be the laughing stock of the Blue and Gold twice in one week would be
too much; we can prevent this by being at Berkeley. Saturday and help make
the transbay folk forget the record of the Stanford freshman nine.
