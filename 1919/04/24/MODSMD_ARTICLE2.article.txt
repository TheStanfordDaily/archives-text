# BABE TRACKSTERS READY FOR CALIFORNIA FRACAS
## 
### 
That the freshman tracksters are go
ing to meet California's "babes" on the
oval here Saturday with the expecta
tion of holding their own is the opinion
of "Bob" Shlaudeman, captain of the
Cardinal yearlings. Although at the
first of the track season the outlook
for a good team was poor, the meet
last Saturday against Lowell and Poly
technic High Schools renewed the con
fidence of those who have been anxious
ly watching the "babes". According to
the dope, Stanford has almost an even
chance aganist the transbay aggregation.
Shlaudeman has a new man in Parme
lec, who won the 100 last Saturday in
10 4/5 seconds. He has only been out
for a little over a week, and was sur
prised to discover that he could run. He
has done 10 2/5 seconds in practice, and
before long should cut that down.

Hasselbach, Lupton and Hendrixson
will be the representatives of the Blue
and Gold in the dashes, and the Cardinal
will depend for these races chiefly on
Parmelee, Larsen and Overacker.
Shlaudeman, who captured 24 out of
58 points scored in the meet against the
high schools last Saturday, will be a
hard man to beat in the jumps and the
pole pault. In the high jump he did
six feet one, and holds the California
pole-vault record of 11 feet six. Nesbit
is the chief California man in the field
events.
Minishall will undoubtedly capture
the hurdles, and Overacker will place in
the shot put.
The longer runs are weak, but Maier
will probably figure for a place in the
mile run. There will be no two-mile
run, javelin, or hammer throw.
