# NESTORIA DEBATES SOVIET CONDITIONS
## 
### 
Nestoria last night held a debate on
the proposition, "Resolved, that the
de facto soviet government should be
recognized," after which the society
engaged in a general discussion of
this subject. Certain members proved
to be exceptionally well posted on the
question, and the informal debate
lasted for more than a half. hour.
During the latter part of the even
ing the club took up a consideration
of plans l'or the remainder of the
quarter, following which the Nesto
ria lis lent their full oratorical powers
to a criticism of the Daily Palo Alto
reportorial methods. The club will
meet next Wedresday in Room 12.
