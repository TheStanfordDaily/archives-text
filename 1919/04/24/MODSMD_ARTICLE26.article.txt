To the Editor of the Daily Palo Alto:
One hundred and eighteen subscrip
tions to the Victory Liberty Loan were
received from the residents of the cam
pus, the total amount subscribed being
$16,750. The amount subscribed is dis
appointingly sm;>ll and is much less than
half the sum subscribed on volunteer
day for the Fourth Liberty Loan. A
large number of the subscriptions were
obtained through the untiring efforts of
Mr. J. E. Hewston.
An analysis of the subscriptions shows
the following interesting facts: Thirty
members of the faculty and assistants
subscribed $6450; sixty-seven members
of the business administration and cam
pus workmen subscribed $4300; campus
residents, including Stanford Bookstore,
subscribed $5850; and one student sub
scribed $150. 1 think we should recom
mend to Congress that this student be
given a medal for "distinguished serv
ice. The campus workmen came through
in fine style, but the students and the
faculty <lid not. Several members of
the faculty signed for very liberal
amounts, but 57 per cent of the faculty,
not including assistants, resident upon
the campus subscribed nothing whatever.
We had hoped that the campus quota
would be subscribed on. volunteer day
so that the business might he finished.
We should raise at least double the
amount subscribed on Monday. How
shall it be done? The chairman of the
committee will be glad to reccivc sug
gestions. Any who wish to subscribe
nay obtain blanks from the Registrar's
Office, the Business Office or the chair
man of the committee.
Let us not forget that the government
is asking for a loan and not a gift. The
loan is a good one, the rate of interest j
hi"h, the security the best in the world,
t' • payments, spread over a period of
revi-n months Is only one student ort
of !;00 to save $50 in seven
months? The boys at the front did
their part . Will we fail to do ours?
