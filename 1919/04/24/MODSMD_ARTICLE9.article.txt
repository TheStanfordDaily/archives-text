# California Makes Three... .Touchdowns in Freshman . ...Baseball Gameâ€”Babes. .....Hold Cubs to 21-0

### 
The freshmen that traveled to
Berkeley yesterday did not seem to be
sure just what game they went across
the bay to play. During the first
frame of the game the team seemed
to have a general idea what the game
was. After that the easiest thing to
say is that the Stanford freshmen
were beaten by a very large football
score (as a baseball score it was un
mentionable). The infield got the
idea in some way that they were
playing Rugby and from that time
on their game was featured by the
dribbling that was made.
Several substitutions had to be
made during different parts of the
melee. The pitchers, who were very
successful at hitting the California
bats, were pulled in rapid succession.
The shortstop got the idea that it was
a circus and did several tumbling
stunts before he would consent to
throw the ball. The rest of the in
field kave a remarkable exhibition of
juggling.
The California team acted as
though they were at a track meet
instead of a football game. Good
time was made by several of the Blue
and Gold batsmen in running buses.
Casey, the U. C. rightfielder, after he
had made his fourth circuit, refused
to hit more than a single, as he said
he had a dance on for the evening and
didn't want to get tired out.
