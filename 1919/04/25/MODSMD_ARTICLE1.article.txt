# "THREE OF A KIND" PROMISES NEW AND NOVEL SITUATIONS
## NAME FOR JUNIOR OPERA SELECTED Finishing Touches Are Being Given 1920 Show by Coaches 
### 
fc fc r ~n HREE of a Kind," suggests
1 something very interesting in
in the way of Junior Operas, and it not
only suggests things, but, according to
the Junior Opera committee, the name
of the 1920 show is indicative of the
fact that there will be some startlingly
involved situations, and that there will
be more than one hero or villain, which
ever it may be, to deal with,
Miss Kirby Ingoldsby, '21, has given
this most fitting name to the Junior
Opera, and promises that the Stanford
community will not be disappointed in
plot or character sketch, which are both
not only modern in every detail but very
futuristic as well. Gordon Davis, '17,
has the cats in excellent condition for
putting on the finishing touches, and the
dances as worked out by Miss Jean
Long, '13, show extreme variety of
movement and grace. The choruses are
proving themselves masters in the art
of stage dancing.
Leads Fit Parts Well
Miss Margaret Wood, '21, who will
take the lead opposite "Peg" Whealton,
19, has shown herself to be a perfect
type for the part which she carries, and
will reveal some remarkable pantomime
acting. Her pose for a period of five
minutes will tend to startle the Stanford
audience. There exists, in other words,
only beauty and grace of action for the
heroine of the plot.
"Three of a Kind" ! ! The committee
believes there is much in a name, and
in this case, at least, their supposition
is true. Jnst who or what the three
"kinds" are, is a matter for each person
to find out for himself by purchasing
a ticket for the opera. They are to be
on sale next week at the campus book
store, and first come, first served, as
has always been the custom in the past.
The date of the opera has been post
poned until the evening of Friday, May
19, and this means that the Junior Prom
will come on Saturday night, instead of
Friday. It has been necessary to make
this change in dates due to the ruling
of the student affairs committee, but
there should be no difference one way
or the other, as to the success of both
the opera and the prom.
The 1920 opera promises something
big in Stanford dramatics, its name sig
nifies a mysterious plot, the cast of char
acters could not have been better, and,
everything considered, this year's show
will no doubt make one of the biggest
hits that has ever been made in the
history of Stanford Junior Opera.

Leads Fit Parts Well
Miss Margaret Wood, '21, who will
take the lead opposite "Peg" Whealton,
19, has shown herself to be a perfect
type for the part which she carries, and
will reveal some remarkable pantomime
acting. Her pose for a period of five
minutes will tend to startle the Stanford
audience. There exists, in other words,
only beauty and grace of action for the
heroine of the plot.
"Three of a Kind" ! ! The committee
believes there is much in a name, and
in this case, at least, their supposition
is true. Jnst who or what the three
"kinds" are, is a matter for each person
to find out for himself by purchasing
a ticket for the opera. They are to be
on sale next week at the campus book
store, and first come, first served, as
has always been the custom in the past.
The date of the opera has been post
poned until the evening of Friday, May
19, and this means that the Junior Prom
will come on Saturday night, instead of
Friday. It has been necessary to make
this change in dates due to the ruling
of the student affairs committee, but
there should be no difference one way
or the other, as to the success of both
the opera and the prom.
The 1920 opera promises something
big in Stanford dramatics, its name sig
nifies a mysterious plot, the cast of char
acters could not have been better, and,
everything considered, this year's show
will no doubt make one of the biggest
hits that has ever been made in the
history of Stanford Junior Opera.
