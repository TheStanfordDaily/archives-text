# JOFFRE MEDAILLE CONTEST WILL BE STAGED TONIGHT
## COACH HAS DEVELOPED STRONG SQUAD Blote, Knight, and Leiser Will Represent Stanford 
### 
SFANFORD and California debaters
will clash tonight in the biggest
contest of the year, the Joffre extem
poraneous argument on the "Future
Colonial Policy of France," the exact
question which will be announced this
evening. The large "Medaille Joffre"
has arrived from Paris and will be pre
sented to the best speaker after the clash
tonight.
1 he California representatives are J.
J. Posner, W. M. Green and Miss Mild
red Little, who arrived from across the
hay late this afternoon. Posner and
Green were members of last year's
Joffre team, while Miss Little is con
sidered no less able than her colleagues.
Definite Question Under Seal
The definite question the argu
ment was selected by Professor O'Neil
of.the University of Wisconsin, and is
now under seal in President Wilbur's
office. The University Librarian will
break the seal in his office tonight at
6 o'clock, at which time the debaters
will receive the proposition, and will
draw for sides to be taken and for order
of speaking. They will then take sep
arate rooms in which each contender
is allowed two hours for the preparation
of an argument, using only what ma
terial he brings in his suitcase. The
JofTre is not a team debate as the draw
ings are so arranged that one Stan
ford man will be arguing against two
of his colleagues.
j Each speaker is allowed fifteen min
utes to divide as he chooses between a
main speech and a rebuttal. The whole
argument lasts slightly less than two
hours, the new medal winner should be
announced by 10 o'clock this evening.
The first speaker will afJpcar on the
Assembly Hall platform at exactly 8
o'clock.
Though the trio from California is
well prepared tonight, Coach M. M. Mc-
Clintock is banking on the experience
and the diversified character of his team
composed of Blote, Knight, and Leiser,
to win the second JofTre medal. Before
last year the JofTre was known as the
Carnot debate, so the second real JofTre
medal will be presented tonight.
