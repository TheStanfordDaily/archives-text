# CURATOR LEMOS IS TO BE NEW EDITOR OF ART MAGAZINE
## 
### 
Stanford's Museum curator, Pedro J.
Lemos, has been made editor of the
School Arts Magazine, for the new
volume commencing next July.
The School Arts magazine is one of
the leading periodicals dealing with ap
plied art in the schools, and forms a
part of the library of practically all art
departments throughout the United
States.
Mr. Lemos has won considerable fame
as an illustrator. He has been a con
tributor to various art magazines; is the
author of "Simplfied Art," a work that
has revolutionized teaching methods;
and is at present working on a larger
and more comprehensive study of art.
Previous to coming to Stanford to
take charge of the museum, Mr. Lemos
was director of Mark Hopkins Institute
of Art, in San Francisco. His work for
the Quad has probably made him best
known on the campus.
