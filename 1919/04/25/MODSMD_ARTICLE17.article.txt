# SHIMMIE AND SCANDAL
## 
### 
il is a well-recognized fact that public opinion is
one of the greatest remedial forces, as great pos
sibly as most artificial rules of even our august student law-mak
ing bodies, it is always a source of regret to us to see oiie of these
bodies attempt to do what in time public opinion will do much more satisfac
torily. We have a living example of one of these attempts to precede public
opinion in the resolution of the Women's Conference last evening. In regard
to that creation of the dance faddists and parlor conversationist, the "Shim
mie," public opinion was fast dooming it to disappearance.
In the natural course of events we might have expected to see the shim
mie take its respected place with the turkey trot and the bunny hug in the
ranks of the "has-beens," if not even the "never-wases." No action by any
disciplining or governing body was necessary to hasten its departure. We
are inclined to believe that any action suggesting condemnation and ultimate
abandonment of the dance was an unnecessary mistake. We may vote with
the Conference in abandoning the dance, but we know that the dance would
have disappeared by itself without any action by the Women's Council.
We cannot help but remark that public opinion against the shimmie
may possibly even swerve in its favor now that we are told that it is to be
denied. It is human nature to want what you cannot have. Many people
would not want the shimmie unless somebody told them that they could not
have it. The Woman's Conference seems to have forgotten the force of pub
lic opinion and the peculiarities of human nature.
But, we are told, the action of the woman's disciplinary body was more
in the nature of expressed disapprobation than real action. This to us is
even less appropriate than an actual ruling. A suggestion lacks the force and
good points of a ruling, whereas a suggestion of this nature will tend pri
marily to aggravate discussion and agitation. The publicity that the San
Francisco newspapers gave to the Council's action received the same ap
plause that all scandal receives from the metropolitan press. Scandal is not
beneficial to a university. It was one of the functions of the Conference to
be far-sighted enough to see the news value to any action upon the shimmie,
especially action from the standpoint of the college woman.
The shimmie would have died a natural death and undoubtedly would
have joined the great unmourned. As it is, the shimmie may be removed
from people's feet, but discussion of it is still upon people's tongues and in
all the news columns in the vicinity. Scandal does not help us and we are
sorry that the Women's Conference failed to take advantage of natural ten
dencies and thus failed to avoid another possibly unpleasant period of agi
tation.

may possibly even swerve in its favor now that we are told that it is to be
denied. It is human nature to want what you cannot have. Many people
would not want the shimmie unless somebody told them that they could not
have it. The Woman's Conference seems to have forgotten the force of pub
lic opinion and the peculiarities of human nature.
But, we are told, the action of the woman's disciplinary body was more
in the nature of expressed disapprobation than real action. This to us is
even less appropriate than an actual ruling. A suggestion lacks the force and
good points of a ruling, whereas a suggestion of this nature will tend pri
marily to aggravate discussion and agitation. The publicity that the San
Francisco newspapers gave to the Council's action received the same ap
plause that all scandal receives from the metropolitan press. Scandal is not
beneficial to a university. It was one of the functions of the Conference to
be far-sighted enough to see the news value to any action upon the shimmie,
especially action from the standpoint of the college woman.
The shimmie would have died a natural death and undoubtedly would
have joined the great unmourned. As it is, the shimmie may be removed
from people's feet, but discussion of it is still upon people's tongues and in
all the news columns in the vicinity. Scandal does not help us and we are
sorry that the Women's Conference failed to take advantage of natural ten
dencies and thus failed to avoid another possibly unpleasant period of agi
tation.
