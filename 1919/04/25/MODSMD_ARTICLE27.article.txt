Belgian babies, good food, dancing—
; All these sound like new words until
they are properly linked together. Now
see how they sound. At the Cafeteria
supper Saturday night, at the Delta
(lamma house, good food will be in
j abundance. The proceeds of the bene
fit will go to the support of Belgian
: babies, who are being cared for at Os
i sendrecht, Holland. Besides the supper.
I there will be a nickle dance during the
j supper hours of 5:30 to 8 o'clock, and if
,any care to stay after 8, they can en
joy more good dancing,
j . Here is just a hint of what the menu
I will be—cold sliced ham, meat loaf and
other cold sliced meats cooked in real
honest to goodness homes, fruit and po
tato salad, steaming hot coffee, beans
l (not the Army-kind), and hot tomales.
: There is just a hint out that there will
be pie—real pie—and even a pie a la
mode.
I Another secret was let out today about
, this benefit, when one of the committee
let go, unaware, the fact that there
would be music from the city. As to the
nature of that music, it was impossible
to discover, only that it would be great.
| Present signs indicate that there will
be a "capacity house, with the S. R. O.
sign" outside. Every one in Palo Alto
and on the Campus is urged to attend
and get the best Saturday night supper
ever.
