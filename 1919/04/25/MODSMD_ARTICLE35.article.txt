# JUNIOR PROM COMES ON SATURDAY, MAY 10
## 
### 
As a result of the faculty ruling that
the Junior Opera cannot lie held on
Thursday night, the Opera date has been
changed to Friday, necessitating the
moving of the Junior Prom until Sat
urday, May 10.
1 his action necessitates several dis
tinct changes. In order to avoid dancing
on Sunday, the dance will be run oft"
without any intermission until 12 o'clock.
At that time the refreshments will be
served, and music w ill be enjoyed around
the pool.
As formerly planned, an intermission
of one hour was to intervene between
the ninth and the tenth dances. These
new plans will allow a Prom of the
same length as was at first planned,
but with the intermission coming at
the end, instead of the middle.
The dance will begin promplv at 9
o'clock. Music will be provided by the
special orchestra of nine pieces that
will be brought down from San Fran
cisco for the purpose.
