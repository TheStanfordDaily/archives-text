# 1919 CREW SEASON REVIEWED
## 
### Frank Watts, '19 
IT was not until the latter part of
January of this year that a commit
tee under the guidance of present
Coach Rogers formulated definite plans
to solicit the campus for funds necessary
to carry a Stanford crew through a crit
ical season. The Board of Athletic
Control had already placed the equip
ment on the market for sale to the
highest bidder. This action was met
by obstinate criticism on the part of
students interested in the water sport.
Some influential students on the cam
pus, claiming that crew was a financial
drag on the University and that it dis
tracted men from other forms of ath
letics, favored the action of the Ath
letic Board and attempted to discour
age the launching of a campaign for
funds. Realizing that the Student
Body was going through a period of

rehabilitation and reconstruction and
that everything that had a successful
past should be reintroduced in the Uni
versity, a student committee launched
the dollar campaign, which netted some
seven hundred dollars to place on the
credit side of the books. On account of
large expenses the crew dance was
later given, which brought in an addi
tional eighty-six dollars. Sampus and
Palo Alto merchants donated about
lltty dollars without being canvassed.
When the campaign, backed by the
Daily Palo Alto, was at its height the
newspapers came out stating that the
Universities of Washington and Cali
fornia had their crew arrangements
under way. Soon after this Student
Manager Ames received communica
tions from the respective universitiies
asking information about Stanford's
prospective season and desiring a date
for the triangular regatta. May 3 was
chosen. A contract was drawn up
whereby the regatta be held on the
Oakland Estuary two years and at
Washington one year; this included a
four year schedule between the respec
tive universities, each university tak
ing its turn to finance the race.
February 8 saw Stanford's first sixty
four crew men working out on the ma

chines and shells on Lake Lagunita.
This number was strengthened when the
rugby season ended on February 22
and later at the close of the basketball
series. After results of the Washing
ton Birthday parade were announced it
was necessary to appeal for additional
material. Results of this brought the
crew squad to one hundred. Due to
shortage of equipment it became neces
sary to announce the first cut in the
squad, when it was reduced to' forty
four men including eight coxswains.
During the spring vacation the men,
through their own initiative, put three
of the eight oar shells in condition to
use and workouts were commenced on
the Redwood sloughs. This left sixteen
men continuing practicing on the lake.
It then became necessary to bring the
squad down to twent/-eight men, from
which the varsity and freshman crews

were to be chosen.
During the past season the Student
Body has backed the crew to the limit
and in turn the squad has backed the
University, in choosing a coach who
knew the sport from the beginning to
the finish and yet was a student here.
The men doing their own repair work,
expenses were cut down more than
fifty per cent over previous years, the
largest crew turnout given individual
attention and kept on the squad as long
as conditions would permit.
With a past that is envied at Pough
keepsie, to say nothing about the Pa
cific Coast, the present squad feel
nothing other than duty bound to up
hold the reputation of previous years.
The aims of the University have been
realized by the present squad and now
the aims of the crews are to be at
tained â€”to win the races on May 3.
Everything points toward that end, for
the crews have been covering the three
mile course in time that is being set
down as a new standard and there is
yet a week of training to put the fin
ishing touches on the men. They are
out to win and nothing short of crews
that are superior to any that have
rowed the Estuary will defeat them.
