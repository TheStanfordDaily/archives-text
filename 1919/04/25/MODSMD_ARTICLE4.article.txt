# FRESHMAN-U.C., VARSITY-OLYMPIC TRACK CONTESTS HERE TOMORROW
## Second Baseball Battle Scheduled at California 1922 RUNNERS FACE STRONG COMBINATION Have Chance to Make Good Showing Against the Californians 
### 
JUST what kind of a showing the
1922 track team will make against
the California freshmen Saturday after
noon it is impossible to predict. Coach
Coach Christie of the Bruin squad is
not boasting of any particular stars like
Schlaudeman, but claims a good al
round team that can put up a mighty
good contest against the Blue and Gold
Varsity.
It is in the particular of consistant
placing in all events that makes the Cali
fornia freshman tracksters look formida
ble. Interest among the first-year men
at Stanford has increased considerably
the last few weeks, and after their show
ing last Saturday it looks like their
hopes of having an even break with
California might find some ground for
support.
Bruins Have All-Round Team
The Blue and Gold first-year men
have had the advantage of better coach
ing and closer watching, and it is highly
probable that Christie has developed an
all round team from his raw material
and has filled up weak spots that slipped
by unnoticed with the Cardinal babes.
In psite of the gloomy outlook, Cap
tain Schlaudeman of the freshman team
hopes to sprin some surprises for
Cousin Bruin. His biggest find of the
season is Pannclee in the hundred and
twenty yards. Those who have been ob
serving the latest freshman protegee ex
pect that he may lower his time in the
century to the neighborhood of 10 1/5
seconds.
Schlaudeman himself will be a big
scoring machine for the 1922 team and
can be depended on for points in the
high jump, pole vault and discus. Lar
sen, Jenks and Moulton are all doing
good work in the quarter and should
form the basis of a strong relay team.
Ovcracker may be able to figure in the
shot, and Minshall has a good chance in
the hurdles. The two-mile, hammer and
javelin throw have been left out of the
list of events.
I'he meet is scheduled for 1:30 p.m.
mi the local oval and an admission of
30 cents will be collected. Varsity track
men will assist as officials.
