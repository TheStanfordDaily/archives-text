# STANFORD'S GREAT CHANCE IN BASEBALL
## 
### H.C. Galloway, '20 
STANFORD feels more confident
than ever since its win of last
Saturday, of beating California to
morrow? Both pitchers, Newland and
Pelouze, are in great shape, and
Coach Evans is staying awake at
night trying to figure out which one
to start. It will probably be decided
by letting them draw straws for it.
That is just how close it is.
There has been one change in the
line-up since last Saturday, ill Pike
will occupy left field in place of Reg
Coughey, who has a bad ankle and
needs rest from the track meet. Pike
showed that he found his batting eye
when he crashed out a triple and a
couple of singles against St. Mary's.
What's more, he looks good for three
more against California.

In the batting order, Mush Stevens
lias been moved down from second to
third place, as with the addition of
Pike, who can lay them down when
needed, our hitting strength will be
improved. Pike will bat second in
Stevens' old place.
At present, every one on the club
has his eye on the ball, as the game
with St* Mary's proved. Fourteen
safe licks were garnered by the sup
posedly "hitles√ü wonders," and most
of them were for extra bases. Pike
and Lilly both had nice workouts run
ning out triples.
As to the fielding, that will take
care of itself. The infielders this
year, when they get going, look about
as good as anything Stanford has had
