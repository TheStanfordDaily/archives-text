# STANFORD'S GREAT CHANCE IN BASEBALL
## 
### H.C. Galloway, '20 
STANFORD feels more confident
than ever since its win of last
Saturday, of beating California to
morrow? Both pitchers, Newland and
Pelouze, are in great shape, and
Coach Evans is staying awake at
night trying to figure out which one
to start. It will probably be decided
by letting them draw straws for it.
That is just how close it is.
There has been one change in the
line-up since last Saturday, ill Pike
will occupy left field in place of Reg
Coughey, who has a bad ankle and
needs rest from the track meet. Pike
showed that he found his batting eye
when he crashed out a triple and a
couple of singles against St. Mary's.
What's more, he looks good for three
more against California.

In the batting order, Mush Stevens
lias been moved down from second to
third place, as with the addition of
Pike, who can lay them down when
needed, our hitting strength will be
improved. Pike will bat second in
Stevens' old place.
At present, every one on the club
has his eye on the ball, as the game
with St* Mary's proved. Fourteen
safe licks were garnered by the sup
posedly "hitles√ü wonders," and most
of them were for extra bases. Pike
and Lilly both had nice workouts run
ning out triples.
As to the fielding, that will take
care of itself. The infielders this
year, when they get going, look about
as good as anything Stanford has had
since Zeb Terry left. Every member
of this combination has played enough
ball to be cool and steady, no matter
what the California bleachers may
say or do. The balls hop a little
faster on California's grass infield, but.
when we worked out up there Wed
nesday morning everybody managed
to hold on to them. The outfield rep
resented by Pike, Lilly, and Kline,
looks as good as California's; they
will have 110 trouble handling any
thing that comes out to them.
California heretofore has won in
baseball bcause it has always had
strong pitching staffs and hard-hit
ting clubs. This year its hitting is
weak as compared to its old teams,
while the pitching is about medium.
Allison is a good chucker against out
side clubs, but goes to pieces against

Stanford, hence cannot be considered
as good a pitcher as lie really is for
this reason. Murchio, in my opinion,
is the best bet California has to use
against Stanford and seems to be the
logical man to start Saturday. Trip,
the third man of its staff, has a good
curve ball and be used in place
of Murchio. However, none of these
men have enough to keep Stanford
from scoring.
This is our great chance this year
to beat California in baseball, and
with the first game on ice, there's
nothing to do but make it two in a
row. However, at California the
woole school is behind its team and
will "hock their watches" on it. This
is the spirit we need. What we need,
and need badly, is a bunch in the
stand that will keep the fire going
and the team will take care of win
ning the ball game.
