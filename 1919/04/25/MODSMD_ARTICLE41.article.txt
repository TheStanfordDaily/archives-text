# Shimmee in Extreme Form is Disapproved
## 
### Irene B. Bonnett, '19 
WHEN a few steps of the so-called
"shimmee" were first introduced
on the campus into the regular one
step dances, there was nothing particu
larly objectionable about it. Contrary
to the fate of every new dance, it was
not greatly opposed on its first appear
ance.
It is only as it has grown more ex
treme and finally appeared in its undi
luted form before the eyes of the cam
pus that sentiment against it has arisen,
grown very strong, and pronounced it
utterly disgusting. We feel confident
that the sentiment against it is practi
cally universal on the campus, though
all of us may not yet have expressed
our opinions on the subject.
The name, shimnwe, to the least,
is anything but elegant, though 1 do
not suggest a change in the name as a
solution to the problem. The dance can
not lie upheld from an aesthetic stand
point, for there is nothing artistic nor
graceful in it. In fact its only asset is
that it merely requires standing room,
and therefore more couples can lie upon
| the floor, provided, however, they are
doing the shimmee. For those who do
not see fit to try this latest dance, it is
impossible to progress around the room
in the conventional fashion. There is
plenty of room on "The Farm," so that
we do not have to resort to shimmeeing
in order to conserve space!
But assuming that some of us do not
see that the dance, —if such it may be
called, —under discussion is question
able, let us consider the opinion held by
people elsewhere. In New York there
has been a great deal of agitation, and
serious consideration of passing a law
to line everyone found doing the shim
mee dance in any public place.
That gives it rather a serious as
pect, does it not? Shall what is con
demned in New York flourish here?
Apparently it is also not done in the
best circles of France, for an American
officer who has just returned from there
was perfectly horrified to find that it
was permitted here at Stanford. That
this cheek-to-cheek dancing was ex
actly such a scene as one would expect
to view in the Bowery in East Side,
New York, rather than on our campus,
was his comment.
"What is the matter with the Stan-
Tord girls?" he said. "In my day they
had higher standards than I see in evi
dence now."
Perhaps our standards are just as
high, but it is only that we do not have
the courage of our convictions. One
girl on the campus has the courage of
(hers, at least. She was opposed to the
dance and tried in a kindly way to get
the idea over to her partner during a
certain dance. Her third attempt was.
"Sir, I do not shimmee." Whereupon
he looked at her in utter contempt and
suggested that they sit out the rest of
the dance. It's rather unfair to show
disgust or contempt when a woman lives
up to her convictions, and to ignore the
fact that anyone else has a right to an
opinion.
Colleges and universities are for the
education and uplift of men and wo
men. Is Stanford serving this purpose?
If definite action has been taken on
the subject of the shimmee in New
York, and will no doubt also be taken in
: San Francisco, we can be sure that the
faculty of Stanford will do the same
unless we ourselves settle the situation.
The women at least have student
control. Shall we not rise to this occa
sion and show the faculty that we are
'capable of settling our own problems?
Don't "sit on the fence." Everyone who
is not against shimmeeing is for it.
