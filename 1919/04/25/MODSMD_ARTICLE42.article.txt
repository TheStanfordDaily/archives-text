# OUTLOOK FOR TRACK SEASON
## 
### Clark Teitsworth, '19 
This season lias been rather unique
in athletic history. Starting back
in February with only a handful of ath
letes, men have gradually returned
from the service until we have what
seems to be a well-rounded Varsity.
Track' practice started in earnest
along about the first of March with sev
eral informal meets. It ended for the
winter quarter with the Irish marathon.
The time made in the marathon was
rather slow this year due to the bad
track and the early part of the season
in which the meet was held.
Another informal meet was held the
Saturday following finals. A team of
eleven men was chosen to represent
Stanford against U. S. C. in tlie south.
When it came to an actual count, how
ever, we had only ten men, Maynard be
ing left home on account of injuries.
There was a good turnout and good
weather for the meet. U. S. C. was de
feated by a score of 55-48. This meet
brought out the first real performances
of the year. Dinkelspiel ran tin- quar
ter in 51 flat. Caughey put the shot
44 feet S inches, and Green vaulted 12
feet.
Another meet was held with LI. S. C.
on the home track the following week,
which resulted in a 71-40 victory. B\
this time the team had been strength
ened by the addition of Templeton, Sa
mis, Wright, Linn and, Tauzer. These
men were not yet in shape, having
trained for only one week. Dinkelspiel.
was incapacitated with a bad leg.
Greene vaulted 12 ft. 6 in.in this meet
and also cleared the bar at 6 ft. 6 in.
in the high jumps. Wells won over the

U. S. C. captain in the high hurdles and
the high jump. The team as a whole
showed improved form.
The interclass has been the only meet
since the second U. S. C. meet. Wells,
Lilly and Pelouze showed much im
provement in the sprints and Westwick
ran the mile in 4:40 and 3-5.
Since the interclass Maynard and
Dinkelspiel have both returned to the

track and are in good condition again.
Templeton has also cleared 6 ft. in the
high jump.
On April 26 we meet the Olympic
Club.i his will be a real chance for
comparison for the California meet the
week following. The Stanford team
will lie weakened by the absence of
Lilly, Pelouze and Caughey, as they are
scheduled to play ball with California
that day. With these men out, the

Stanford team will have a difficult time
holding its own with the Olympics, who
were only beaten 3-4 of a point by Cali
fornia on April 19. Dopesters will do
well to see this meet.
It is my opinion that track meets are
difficult to dope by events. However,
that the Varsity this year compares fair-

ly well with those of past years and
that the public will witness the seventh
straight victory over Cadifornia on
May 3.
1 112 the team shows as well as we ex
pect in this meet it will lie held together
for the P. A. A. meet which takes place
at Berkeley on May 10 and the Pacific
Coast Intercollegiate meet at Seattle on
May 31.

Saturday following finals. A team of
eleven men was chosen to represent
Stanford against U. S. C. in tlie south.
When it came to an actual count, how
ever, we had only ten men, Maynard be
ing left home on account of injuries.
There was a good turnout and good
weather for the meet. U. S. C. was de
feated by a score of 55-48. This meet
brought out the first real performances
of the year. Dinkelspiel ran tin- quar
ter in 51 flat. Caughey put the shot
44 feet S inches, and Green vaulted 12
feet.
Another meet was held with LI. S. C.
on the home track the following week,
which resulted in a 71-40 victory. B\
this time the team had been strength
ened by the addition of Templeton, Sa
mis, Wright, Linn and, Tauzer. These
men were not yet in shape, having
trained for only one week. Dinkelspiel.
was incapacitated with a bad leg.
Greene vaulted 12 ft. 6 in.in this meet
and also cleared the bar at 6 ft. 6 in.
in the high jumps. Wells won over the

U. S. C. captain in the high hurdles and
the high jump. The team as a whole
showed improved form.
The interclass has been the only meet
since the second U. S. C. meet. Wells,
Lilly and Pelouze showed much im
provement in the sprints and Westwick
ran the mile in 4:40 and 3-5.
Since the interclass Maynard and
Dinkelspiel have both returned to the

track and are in good condition again.
Templeton has also cleared 6 ft. in the
high jump.
On April 26 we meet the Olympic
Club.i his will be a real chance for
comparison for the California meet the
week following. The Stanford team
will lie weakened by the absence of
Lilly, Pelouze and Caughey, as they are
scheduled to play ball with California
that day. With these men out, the

Stanford team will have a difficult time
holding its own with the Olympics, who
were only beaten 3-4 of a point by Cali
fornia on April 19. Dopesters will do
well to see this meet.
It is my opinion that track meets are
difficult to dope by events. However,
that the Varsity this year compares fair-

ly well with those of past years and
that the public will witness the seventh
straight victory over Cadifornia on
May 3.
1 112 the team shows as well as we ex
pect in this meet it will lie held together
for the P. A. A. meet which takes place
at Berkeley on May 10 and the Pacific
Coast Intercollegiate meet at Seattle on
May 31.

This season lias been rather unique
in athletic history. Starting back
in February with only a handful of ath
letes, men have gradually returned
from the service until we have what
seems to be a well-rounded Varsity.
Track' practice started in earnest
along about the first of March with sev
eral informal meets. It ended for the
winter quarter with the Irish marathon.
The time made in the marathon was
rather slow this year due to the bad
track and the early part of the season
in which the meet was held.
