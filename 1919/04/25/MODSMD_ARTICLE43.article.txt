# CAMPUS MEMORIAL DRIVE BRINGS RESULTS
## 
### L.W. Dinkelspiel, '20 
UP to Wednesday of this week, the
Stanford Memorial was lo the
average student of the University more
or less of a project in which he was
interested but not vitally concerned.
The student assembly in mid-week
turned the project from one of interest
only to one of vital concern to the stu
dents.
Alumni, faculty and students are to
share in the work of constructing the
Memorial. In this way the building will
become in reality a Stanford Memorial
in which all classes of Stanford men and
women are represented. Being possibly
the more directly concerned than any

others in the undertaking as it is ulti
mately to develop, the campaign for
funds has been thown open to the stu
dents.
Memorial Depends on Students
Thus wWind the Memorial dependent
first upon the students for its success.
1 112 the student drive for funds should
fail, although we are told that it cannot
fail, we may as well say that the Me
morial I fall will never be built and
Stanford never outwardly pay its tribute
to the sons and daughters of the Cardi
nal who served. There would be no
calamity in the history of the University
