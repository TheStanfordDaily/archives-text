# CAMPUS MEMORIAL DRIVE BRINGS RESULTS
## 
### L.W. Dinkelspiel, '20 
UP to Wednesday of this week, the
Stanford Memorial was lo the
average student of the University more
or less of a project in which he was
interested but not vitally concerned.
The student assembly in mid-week
turned the project from one of interest
only to one of vital concern to the stu
dents.
Alumni, faculty and students are to
share in the work of constructing the
Memorial. In this way the building will
become in reality a Stanford Memorial
in which all classes of Stanford men and
women are represented. Being possibly
the more directly concerned than any

others in the undertaking as it is ulti
mately to develop, the campaign for
funds has been thown open to the stu
dents.
Memorial Depends on Students
Thus wWind the Memorial dependent
first upon the students for its success.
1 112 the student drive for funds should
fail, although we are told that it cannot
fail, we may as well say that the Me
morial I fall will never be built and
Stanford never outwardly pay its tribute
to the sons and daughters of the Cardi
nal who served. There would be no
calamity in the history of the University
comparable to failure in an undertaking
such as the building of Memorial Hall.
I his is recognized as one of the great
est bits of constructive endeavors under
taken by the combined branches of the
I niversity since—well, in Stanford's
early history. All the more reason whv
it should not fail! The greater the
undertaking and the more important it
is, the greater the reason why it can
not fail.
Thus we find ourselves tangibly with
the question up to us. What are we
to do and how are to do it? Cearly the
answer to one part of that question is
the answer to the other phase. What
we are to do is support the Memorial,
and how we are to do it is primarily
through funds to enable the Memorial
to ultimately exist. In support of the
Memorial two things are demanded.
Naturally to dig deep into our pocket
books is the first. Tt is the unfortunate
realization of men undertaking big
things that money is always an essential
from the start of the undertaking. Even
something with as noble a purpose and
as worth> an object as the Memorial
will not spring up over night without
the incentive of considerable funds.
Student Drive for Funds Started
The student drive has started; fifty
thousand dollars has been named as the
minimum of contributions. Considering
that there are only 1540 students regis
tered in the University, this quota is
considerable. But, on the other hand,
the whole undertaking of the Memorial
is a considerable undertaking and the
students' share in the fund only con
sistently great. To raise the fund
thus becomes a problem and a large one
at that. The problem is in fact so large
that it deninads universal interest. It
cannot succeed if only a few subscribe.
People must pledge the maximum of
available and potential funds. The
period of four years permitted for pay
ment. if desired, should tend to make
subscriptions considerably higher than
otherwise, since six or eight dollars a
year is considerably less trying on the
pocketbook than $24 or $32 paid now.
Subscriptions should not be based upon
what funds are now available, but what
funds plus those on hand will ultimately
be available.
Maximum of Subscribers is
Essential
It is clear, then, that from a practical
standpoint the maximum of subscribers
at the maximum amount of subscription
is an essential in the student drive. In
addition to being a Stanford Memorial,
it must be built through funds from
practically all of Stanford. There is lit
tle doubt but what some wealthy
alumnus or friend of the University
could be persuaded to beqeuath or en
dow large sums for the purpose of the
Memorial, but that is not the motive or
intent of the Memorial. It must come
from Stanford and from all of Stanford.
The second thing demanded in support
of the Memorial is something additional
to financial help. It might be called
moral assistance. It is the voluntary
help in all ways of the students of the
University to the project now under
taken. It is the support of the students
in the project through interest in the
project and enthusiasm for its work.
This enthusiasm and support are desired
on the same ground that voluntary, not
compulsory, subscriptions are desired.
The Memorial comes from the heart of
the men -and women of the University.
As such, expressive of the sentiment and
favor of Stanford people, as expressive
of the thanks of the Stanford family for
the work of its sons and daughters who
served and especially of the work of
those who completed their service with
out returning, the Memorial will then
become a worthy, if still inadequate
tribute to the work which no monument
can ennoble, but can only help to per
petuate.

from Stanford and from all of Stanford.
The second thing demanded in support
of the Memorial is something additional
to financial help. It might be called
moral assistance. It is the voluntary
help in all ways of the students of the
University to the project now under
taken. It is the support of the students
in the project through interest in the
project and enthusiasm for its work.
This enthusiasm and support are desired
on the same ground that voluntary, not
compulsory, subscriptions are desired.
The Memorial comes from the heart of
the men -and women of the University.
As such, expressive of the sentiment and
favor of Stanford people, as expressive
of the thanks of the Stanford family for
the work of its sons and daughters who
served and especially of the work of
those who completed their service with
out returning, the Memorial will then
become a worthy, if still inadequate
tribute to the work which no monument
can ennoble, but can only help to per
petuate.
UP to Wednesday of this week, the
Stanford Memorial was lo the
average student of the University more
or less of a project in which he was
interested but not vitally concerned.
The student assembly in mid-week
turned the project from one of interest
only to one of vital concern to the stu
dents.
Alumni, faculty and students are to
share in the work of constructing the
Memorial. In this way the building will
become in reality a Stanford Memorial
in which all classes of Stanford men and
women are represented. Being possibly
the more directly concerned than any

others in the undertaking as it is ulti
mately to develop, the campaign for
funds has been thown open to the stu
dents.
Memorial Depends on Students
Thus wWind the Memorial dependent
first upon the students for its success.
1 112 the student drive for funds should
fail, although we are told that it cannot
fail, we may as well say that the Me
morial I fall will never be built and
Stanford never outwardly pay its tribute
to the sons and daughters of the Cardi
nal who served. There would be no
calamity in the history of the University
comparable to failure in an undertaking
such as the building of Memorial Hall.
I his is recognized as one of the great
est bits of constructive endeavors under
taken by the combined branches of the
I niversity since—well, in Stanford's
early history. All the more reason whv
it should not fail! The greater the
undertaking and the more important it
is, the greater the reason why it can
not fail.
Thus we find ourselves tangibly with
the question up to us. What are we
to do and how are to do it? Cearly the
answer to one part of that question is
the answer to the other phase. What
we are to do is support the Memorial,
and how we are to do it is primarily
through funds to enable the Memorial
to ultimately exist. In support of the
Memorial two things are demanded.
Naturally to dig deep into our pocket
books is the first. Tt is the unfortunate
realization of men undertaking big
things that money is always an essential
from the start of the undertaking. Even
something with as noble a purpose and
as worth> an object as the Memorial
will not spring up over night without
the incentive of considerable funds.
Student Drive for Funds Started
The student drive has started; fifty
thousand dollars has been named as the
minimum of contributions. Considering
that there are only 1540 students regis
tered in the University, this quota is
considerable. But, on the other hand,
the whole undertaking of the Memorial
is a considerable undertaking and the
students' share in the fund only con
sistently great. To raise the fund
thus becomes a problem and a large one
at that. The problem is in fact so large
that it deninads universal interest. It
cannot succeed if only a few subscribe.
People must pledge the maximum of
available and potential funds. The
period of four years permitted for pay
ment. if desired, should tend to make
subscriptions considerably higher than
otherwise, since six or eight dollars a
year is considerably less trying on the
pocketbook than $24 or $32 paid now.
Subscriptions should not be based upon
what funds are now available, but what
funds plus those on hand will ultimately
be available.
Maximum of Subscribers is
Essential
It is clear, then, that from a practical
standpoint the maximum of subscribers
at the maximum amount of subscription
is an essential in the student drive. In
addition to being a Stanford Memorial,
it must be built through funds from
practically all of Stanford. There is lit
tle doubt but what some wealthy
alumnus or friend of the University
could be persuaded to beqeuath or en
dow large sums for the purpose of the
Memorial, but that is not the motive or
intent of the Memorial. It must come
from Stanford and from all of Stanford.
