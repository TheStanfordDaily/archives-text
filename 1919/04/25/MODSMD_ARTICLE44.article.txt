## An Old Cry, But Spontaneous 
### 
'"W ttyyyPyffjEy each succeeding week of the spring quarter passing,
Alli we cannot help but note that warm weather does not
in an y way seem to influence the car service to and from the Uni
versity. Monopoly in one of its unpleasant aspects seems to have
gripped transportation around the University in a very disagreeable grasp
and the students of the University struggle along as best they can within this
grasp.
It is an old cry, this cry of monopoly, but at times it just bursts forth
spontaenously after periods of slight or material sugering at the hands of the
ogending party. We cannot help but note, however, that the students of the
University are not catching their trains to San Jose and San Francisco or
reaching their homes or the stores in Palo Alto as easily as in the ante
bellum days. We may add that when cars do arrive, and we have seen one
or two in a day at times, they are driven by the sole and lonesome motor
man-conductor-gripman-ticket-agent combination, who draws your change in
one hand and the starting lever in the other.
Talking about change, at that, presents another phase in the service
offered by the Peninsular car system for the benefit of the people moving to
and from the University. The change of one dime has for some time become
four cents when a ride to Palo Alto is included; what have we derived from
the wasted cent?
We do not wish to be unfair towards the carrier company, but we cannot
help but make some comment upon what it is they offer the university com
munity in the way of car service and what it is they should offer and do not.
Twenty-minute service is at best undesirable; but when this twenty-minute
service is furthermore aggravated by ten-minute delays and additional rates,
it becomes sarcasm to call it service. We could understand the inability to
supply the university people with all their wants during the period of the
war, when people were accusomed to sacrifice non-essentials. We cannot
see that any similar excuse exists at present. It may be economy to raise
the rates and cut down on service and conductors, but it certainly is not con
forming with the duties of a public-service corporation in providing carrier
facilities for the public.
The university community is most certainly justified in resenting the in
difference of the company towards its wants. If six cent rates are to be con
tinued, service should improve; if one motorman-conductor combination is
to continue, then the service should become better; if the service does not
improv or even equal old standards, then most crtainly we cannot sympathize
with the Peninsular Railway Company's economizing at the expense of people
about the University.
