# WHY NOT ABOLISH THE SHIMMEE UNAIDED BY FACULTY REGULATIONS?
## 
### Elizabeth Allen Patton, '21 
Everybody shimmies now,
Everybody's learning how,
Brother Bill, —Sister Kate,
Shiver like jelly on a plate.
Shimmee dancing can't be beat,
Moves everything except your feet;
Feeble folks, mighty old.
Shake the shimmie
And they shake it bold.
Oh, honey, won't you show me how?
'Cause everybody shimmies now.
These are the words to one of the
new popular pieces.
At first people shimmied and thought
nothing of it; it was merely a new
dance step. Most of us didn't know
enough about it to even enter into an
argument on the subject. Lately there
has been talk about prohibiting the
shimmie on the campus. Lots of stu
dents still think "oh, what's the rum
pus about? If T want to stand still in
the middle of the floor and shuffle my
feet in time to the music—it's no one's
business but my own."
At first consideration that is all very
well; it does seem perfectly all right
if the man is merely keeping time to the
music and adding a little diversion to
the dance—he may be, and probably is.

doing it without a thot in his head to
any of the vulgar and common refer
ences that have been made to the step.
But can't he see that as long as sugges
tive and vulgar things can be and are
being said about the dance, he is plac
ing his partner in a most peculiar and
embarrassing position, although he him
self may be perfectly unconscious of
any such thots? One man on theccarm r
pus said that no decent girl would
shimmie; another that no man who re
spected a girl would ask her to shim
mie with him. Certainly the words to
the song quoted above do not express
the most refined sentiments.
Probably all of us have shimmied and
thought nothing of it—but I think it's
time for us to take a stand one way or
the other on the question. It certainly
is easy enough for a woman to say to
her partner, "I'd rather not shimmie,
please"—and I doubt very much if
there is any man on the campus who
would not be glad to comply with her
wishes when he realizes the embarrass
ing position in which he is placing her.
Can't we be clean minded without
having to have the University authori
ties or Women's Council tell us to be?
