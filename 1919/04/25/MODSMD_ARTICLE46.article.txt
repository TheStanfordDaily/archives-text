A PROTEST will rise, no doubt,
against the stand taken by Wo
men's Council and Conference on this
engrossing subject of the shimmee.
That protest will in its way be justified.
An interference with anything so per
sonal is bound to cause some slight
feeling. However, there is little ques
tion but that if the protestor pauses
for a moment, he or she will conclude
that after all the position taken by
Council and Conference is warranted

and is not the result of a mighty pug
ishness.
The original beauty and worth of
anything may he perverted by the in
terpretation, and so with the art of
shimmeeing. Doubting not that it may
be very admirable, as executed by some,
it has apparently been over-interpreted
by others. It is sad, indeed, that for
the sake of a few, the whole community
must suffer. But perhaps even without
the shimmee Stanford will be able to
amble along in a state of comparative
happiness.
