# ONCE AGAIN! STANFORD CAMPUS HOBBLED!
## 
### Eleanor Allen, '20 
THE campus is hobbled again!
We have passed from one limiting
sphere to another, until now confined
action constantly dogs our steps even
in the early walk to an eight 6'clock.
Faculty control is as nothing when
viewed in comparison with the most re
cent affliction. This time the control is
exercised from the interested and influ
ential "outside." When this limitation
will be removed and a wider freedom
allowed is as yet unknown, but latest

reports from New York and Paris
fashion shops, the centers of the con
trol, predict an early campus release.
This local release will be granted
largely from necessity. A considerable
falling off in the attendance at Chapel
and early morning classcs.
The widening of the daily walks of
life as practiced on the campus is sin
cerely hoped for, as a result of the an
ticipated shortening of the now length
ened and narrowed restrictions.
