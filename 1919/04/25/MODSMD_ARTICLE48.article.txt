# Plans Made for Early Practice in American Game
## 
### Coach "Bob" Evans 
AS soon as the present baseball and
'track season conies to an end, spring
football practce will begin. Some new
equipment has been purchased within
the last week and outfits for about
seventy-live men have been gathered to
gether ; and, although I expect to see
more than that number on the field, I
believe some of the men have equipment
of their own that will do this spring.
Next fall when the squad is picked they
will be equipped with the best that can
he obtained. 1 believe that to be one of
the most important and prime requisites
for a successful team. Such equipment
has already been ordered for next fall.
Stanford's team next year will depend
upon the way the men in school who
have had actual experience in playing
the game come out for the team. Al
though there have been instances where
formers Rugby players have turned into
good American footballers (and no
doubt some former Rugby men will be
stars on Stanford's American teams),
the odds are all in favor of the boys who
have played the game in high school.
It will, depend largely on the number
of these men we have in school as to just
how soon we get 011 the map in the
game.
Next week a rally will be held to get
the proper "pep" among the students to
walk off with the track meet and crew
races to be held at Berkeley on Saturday.
Incidentally, we hope to celebrate the
winning of the baseball series this week.
At this rally men will be asked to sign
up for spring practice, giving weight,
experience, etc., so we will have an idea
just what to expect when the men put
011 the togs. This means that every
man in school who is naturally an ath
lete, whether he has ever played ball
or not, should come out and try for the
team. Such work as passing, kicking,
tackling (for which a dummy has al
ready been purchased), open field run
ning, charging, blocking and work cover
ing all the fundamental parts of the
game will be worked 011, and it is hoped
that some signal work and team play
may be taken up also.
But the big idea is to see who makes
a showing and to spot those men so
that they can be gathered together at
once next fall to start intensive training.
Some of the men who will be a great
help to us next year and who have
played the game, now in scholo, are:
"Reg" Caughey, who played two years
on the Allentown Army team, probably
011 c of our best bets, as he is big and
fast aind has had experience; Lilly;
Pelouze; Swanholm; Holt; Schaude
man; Falk; Reynolds; Ronnie; and
Greene, a transfer from Wabash, all
men who have had experience in the
back field and should certainly develop
into some going machine, as most all are
fast men.
But the success of the team lies in
whether we have a good line or not,
and means that some effort will have to
be made and hard work done to get
that much neede dline. Such men as
Righter, Adams, Winham and Patrick
of Rugby fame have the size ami ability
to develop into as good American play
ers as they were at the other game;
while Koonz, Curtis, Schaudeman.
Brooks, Pallett, Robinson, the Cary
brothers, "Fat" Howell, Larson, Noack,
and others have bad experience in the
line. To find out how many more 'are
available we wish to know at present.
The sooner you come around and get
acquainted with the American prospects,
the better. Men like Parker and Man
gin and others who played on last year's
army team are expected to make a
strong bid for a place on the team, for.
although the team as a whole did not
have much success, some of the men
were known to play a good game at
ijreat odds.
.Some old students who have already
sent word that they will be back next
fall, and who are eligible, are: "Bob"
Johnson, "Dick" Coleman, "Fat" Levi,
and "Red" Bets, all experienced men
who should help to make a good line.
Stanford should have a high-class
freshman team. Lois of men who have
wanted to come to Stanford in the past
have given other schools the final prefer
ence because they played the American
game and naturally were persuaded to
go to California instead. This difficulty

has now been abridged. Another thing
sure is that a coach will be here to
handle the team and most likely to stay
the year out and give all of his time to
the "frosh" teams in football, basketball
and track.
Last fall Encina gym loaned the foot
ball team 144 sweaters and at the end
of the season the lieutenant in charge
could only find forty-eight to turn back.
This means that most of the men

thought that the equipment issued to
them had befn given to them. Under
the circumstances no one can collect
them, as they cain\ot be identified for
sure. Men who have sweaters and
other football equipment arc urged to
wear same instead of having more issued
to them, in order that all men who want
to come out this spring can be outfitted.
Next fall plenty of equipment for every
body will be on hand, but at present it.

seventy-live men have been gathered to
gether ; and, although I expect to see
more than that number on the field, I
believe some of the men have equipment
of their own that will do this spring.
Next fall when the squad is picked they
will be equipped with the best that can
he obtained. 1 believe that to be one of
the most important and prime requisites
for a successful team. Such equipment
has already been ordered for next fall.
Stanford's team next year will depend
upon the way the men in school who
have had actual experience in playing
the game come out for the team. Al
though there have been instances where
formers Rugby players have turned into
good American footballers (and no
doubt some former Rugby men will be
stars on Stanford's American teams),
the odds are all in favor of the boys who
have played the game in high school.
It will, depend largely on the number
of these men we have in school as to just
how soon we get 011 the map in the
game.
Next week a rally will be held to get
the proper "pep" among the students to
walk off with the track meet and crew
races to be held at Berkeley on Saturday.
Incidentally, we hope to celebrate the
winning of the baseball series this week.
At this rally men will be asked to sign
up for spring practice, giving weight,
experience, etc., so we will have an idea
just what to expect when the men put
011 the togs. This means that every
man in school who is naturally an ath
lete, whether he has ever played ball
or not, should come out and try for the
team. Such work as passing, kicking,
tackling (for which a dummy has al
ready been purchased), open field run
ning, charging, blocking and work cover
ing all the fundamental parts of the
game will be worked 011, and it is hoped
that some signal work and team play
may be taken up also.
But the big idea is to see who makes
a showing and to spot those men so
that they can be gathered together at
once next fall to start intensive training.
Some of the men who will be a great
help to us next year and who have
played the game, now in scholo, are:
"Reg" Caughey, who played two years
on the Allentown Army team, probably
011 c of our best bets, as he is big and
fast aind has had experience; Lilly;
Pelouze; Swanholm; Holt; Schaude
man; Falk; Reynolds; Ronnie; and
Greene, a transfer from Wabash, all
men who have had experience in the
back field and should certainly develop
into some going machine, as most all are
fast men.
But the success of the team lies in
whether we have a good line or not,
and means that some effort will have to
be made and hard work done to get
that much neede dline. Such men as
Righter, Adams, Winham and Patrick
of Rugby fame have the size ami ability
to develop into as good American play
ers as they were at the other game;
while Koonz, Curtis, Schaudeman.
Brooks, Pallett, Robinson, the Cary
brothers, "Fat" Howell, Larson, Noack,
and others have bad experience in the
line. To find out how many more 'are
available we wish to know at present.
The sooner you come around and get
acquainted with the American prospects,
the better. Men like Parker and Man
gin and others who played on last year's
army team are expected to make a
strong bid for a place on the team, for.
although the team as a whole did not
have much success, some of the men
were known to play a good game at
ijreat odds.
.Some old students who have already
sent word that they will be back next
fall, and who are eligible, are: "Bob"
Johnson, "Dick" Coleman, "Fat" Levi,
and "Red" Bets, all experienced men
who should help to make a good line.
Stanford should have a high-class
freshman team. Lois of men who have
wanted to come to Stanford in the past
have given other schools the final prefer
ence because they played the American
game and naturally were persuaded to
go to California instead. This difficulty

has now been abridged. Another thing
sure is that a coach will be here to
handle the team and most likely to stay
the year out and give all of his time to
the "frosh" teams in football, basketball
and track.
Last fall Encina gym loaned the foot
ball team 144 sweaters and at the end
of the season the lieutenant in charge
could only find forty-eight to turn back.
This means that most of the men

thought that the equipment issued to
them had befn given to them. Under
the circumstances no one can collect
them, as they cain\ot be identified for
sure. Men who have sweaters and
other football equipment arc urged to
wear same instead of having more issued
to them, in order that all men who want
to come out this spring can be outfitted.

Next fall when the squad is picked they
will be equipped with the best that can
he obtained. 1 believe that to be one of
the most important and prime requisites
for a successful team. Such equipment
has already been ordered for next fall.
Stanford's team next year will depend
upon the way the men in school who
have had actual experience in playing
the game come out for the team. Al
though there have been instances where
formers Rugby players have turned into
good American footballers (and no
doubt some former Rugby men will be
stars on Stanford's American teams),
the odds are all in favor of the boys who
have played the game in high school.
It will, depend largely on the number
of these men we have in school as to just
how soon we get 011 the map in the
game.
Next week a rally will be held to get
the proper "pep" among the students to
walk off with the track meet and crew
races to be held at Berkeley on Saturday.
Incidentally, we hope to celebrate the
winning of the baseball series this week.
At this rally men will be asked to sign
up for spring practice, giving weight,
experience, etc., so we will have an idea
just what to expect when the men put
011 the togs. This means that every
man in school who is naturally an ath
lete, whether he has ever played ball
or not, should come out and try for the
team. Such work as passing, kicking,
tackling (for which a dummy has al
ready been purchased), open field run
ning, charging, blocking and work cover
ing all the fundamental parts of the
game will be worked 011, and it is hoped
that some signal work and team play
may be taken up also.
But the big idea is to see who makes
a showing and to spot those men so
that they can be gathered together at
once next fall to start intensive training.
Some of the men who will be a great
help to us next year and who have
played the game, now in scholo, are:
"Reg" Caughey, who played two years
on the Allentown Army team, probably
011 c of our best bets, as he is big and
fast aind has had experience; Lilly;
Pelouze; Swanholm; Holt; Schaude
man; Falk; Reynolds; Ronnie; and
Greene, a transfer from Wabash, all
men who have had experience in the
back field and should certainly develop
into some going machine, as most all are
fast men.
But the success of the team lies in
whether we have a good line or not,
and means that some effort will have to
be made and hard work done to get
that much neede dline. Such men as
Righter, Adams, Winham and Patrick
of Rugby fame have the size ami ability
to develop into as good American play
ers as they were at the other game;
while Koonz, Curtis, Schaudeman.
Brooks, Pallett, Robinson, the Cary
brothers, "Fat" Howell, Larson, Noack,
and others have bad experience in the
line. To find out how many more 'are
available we wish to know at present.
The sooner you come around and get
acquainted with the American prospects,
the better. Men like Parker and Man
gin and others who played on last year's
army team are expected to make a
strong bid for a place on the team, for.
although the team as a whole did not
have much success, some of the men
were known to play a good game at
ijreat odds.
.Some old students who have already
sent word that they will be back next
fall, and who are eligible, are: "Bob"
Johnson, "Dick" Coleman, "Fat" Levi,
and "Red" Bets, all experienced men
who should help to make a good line.
Stanford should have a high-class
freshman team. Lois of men who have
wanted to come to Stanford in the past
have given other schools the final prefer
ence because they played the American
game and naturally were persuaded to
go to California instead. This difficulty

has now been abridged. Another thing
sure is that a coach will be here to
handle the team and most likely to stay
the year out and give all of his time to
the "frosh" teams in football, basketball
and track.
Last fall Encina gym loaned the foot
ball team 144 sweaters and at the end
of the season the lieutenant in charge
could only find forty-eight to turn back.
This means that most of the men

thought that the equipment issued to
them had befn given to them. Under
the circumstances no one can collect
them, as they cain\ot be identified for
sure. Men who have sweaters and
other football equipment arc urged to
wear same instead of having more issued
to them, in order that all men who want
to come out this spring can be outfitted.
Next fall plenty of equipment for every
body will be on hand, but at present it.
is hard to get.
