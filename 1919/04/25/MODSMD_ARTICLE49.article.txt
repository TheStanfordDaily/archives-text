# CREW IS PICKED TO WIN
## 
### F.S. Reeder, '22 
VARSITY and freshmen crews are both picked for winners for first hon
ors in the triangle regatta between the Universities of Stanford, Wash
ington, and California. According to "Husky" Guerena, Rix Maurer, "Baldy"
Greene and several other ex-varsity men that have been assisting Coach "Les"
Rogers during the last few weeks, the 1919 boats have better form than any
ever put out by Stanford.
Two veterans, three men who rowed 011 their freshman crews, and three
new men will be the probable line-up for the varsity slill. Captain Watts and
Le Roy King are the two old varsity men in the line-up, and are the main
standbys of this year's crew. Davis, Williamson and McGillivray rowed in
their freshman year, while Adams, Moore, and Wilbur ar.e new men 011 the
water. "Jimmy" Montgomery, who was coxswain 011 the 1919 freshman boat
and the 1917 second varsity, will steer this year's shell.
Watts Working Fine
Captain Watts has been working hard all season trying to get all his
men in the prime of condition, as well as getting back into his old form. This
is Watts' third year at Stanford to sit at. oar number seven. He seems to be
born to the position, according to "Husky" Guerena.
\\ atts is not only a star at the oars, but he also takes an active part in
the other sports. Last fall he was one of the strongest men 011 the football
field, in the American game against California.
King Shows Old Form
Roy King, who will stroke this year's boat, is the same old King that
stroked the 1917 varsity and the 1919 freshman shells. Like Watts, he is
born to his position. It would seem almost impossible to think of a Stanford
crew to go up in the air, with King setting the pace.
King returned to the farm just two months ago, but he started crew train
ing 011 the day of his arrival. The first night out he took his old position at
stroke, and at the end of his first week he was able to stroke Hie men over
a seventeen-mile course. For the past year he has been in the air service,
and along with other things, he seems to have brought back that French en
thusiasm with him. When he steps into the boat and takes hold of his oar,
the boats literally shudders under the strokes he can get from the men.
With Watts and King setting the pace at number seven and stroke, noth
ing short of victory can be thought of. They make a perfect running pair.
Other Men Strong
"Babe" Adams, at oar number six, although a new man in the boat, looks
to be a veteran sitting behind the two "vets." Guerena said that Adams is
a second Newton. Several years ago Newton was an all-Western oarsman,
and a man who sat in the University of Washington boat for three years.
Adams is being compared to Newton 011 account of their relative size. Adams
is the heaviest man in the shell.
McGillivray, Williamson, and Davis, the trio tnat rowed in their freshman
year, are rowing in their usual form. Williamson, while working in the boat,
seems to have an endless line of endurance. Davis rows the smoothest oar
in the boat, while McGillivray pulls the steadiest of the eight.
Wilbur and Moore, two new men in the boat, are working themselves
into excellent shape for the three-mile grind 011 the Oakland estuary.
Freshman Eight Fast
The freshman eight is working itself up into line shape, and it is begin
ning to look as if the California and Washington babes will have to fight it
out for second and third places in the big race. This season's first-year boat
is only a few pounds lighter than the varsity shell, which means that there
will be just as much beef behind the movements of our babes.
Olmstead is working fine at stroke, and Hancock is giving him excellent
support at oar number seven. With these two setting the pace for the first
year men, a strong stroke has been developed in the shell.
Adams, Snow, Brieson, Sayre, McKinnon and Maloney are the other men
at the freshman oars. All of these men are huskies from head to toe, and
an even stroke has been worked out by Coach Rogers.
Second Varsity Will Race
A large amount of the credit for this year's good crew is due to the faith
ful second varsity boat. They come out to the daily workouts without receiv
ing much appreciation from the student body. This year the second varsity
is to row against the corresponding boats of California and Washington. Cap
tain Watts is making an effort to get some sort of a letter for these men
They will probably receive a circle or German S.
Patrick, at number four, and Wooster at number seven, were picked by
"Husky" Guerena as the strongest men on the second varsity. The line-up
for the second varsity is: Cary, stroke; Wooster, 7; Pehl, 6; Vietor, 5; Pat
rick, 4; Hill, 3; Dunbar, 2; Briggs, bow; Robbins, coxswain.
