# CARDINAL BOXERS PRONOUNCED IN TIPTOP SHAPE FOR TOURNAMENT
## 
### Joe Murphy, '20 
HO< )K.S. jabs, hard straight lefts,
and terrific right crosses will reign
supreme at Harmon gymnasium at Ber
keley tonight, when sixty worthy repre
sentatives from Stanford will don the
padded mits for the yearly clash with
the selected opponents of the Blue and
gold in the roped arena.
Yesterday the Cardinal boxers aban
doned their training and were pro
nounced in tip-top shape by all the box
ing enthusiasts. A repetition of last
year's tournament, when Stanford men
won four out of the six bouts, is
looked for this year.
This year's team is composed of all
new men, with the exception of the
welterweight division, but the shoes
of past gladiators such as "Shorty"
Ross, Wheatley, Kegley, and Lytel. has
been successfully filled by men pos
session all the requisites of a fighting
man.
This year the Cardinal has been handi
capped in not having a full-fledged
heavyweight, but is blessed in being
able to put a contender in the ring for
heavy weight honors, who, while not a
heavyweight, is a worthy contender for
lirst place in this event. "Fat" Howell
is the man. He tips the scale at 158
pounds, but carries around with him
such a 2000 pounds of nerve and kick in
either hand as would make a mule en
vious. "Fat" will cross horns with
Morsehead of California, a little fellow
weighing 187 pounds.
Van Cleaf will endeavor to duplicate
Kegley's act of last year when he
climbed into the ring with California's
light heavyweight. Van will he a
little lighter than his opponent, but
his gameness welded with a terrific
right punch will make him almost for
midable against the average amateur.
Hassler, another new man, will fly
Stanford colors in the middleweight di
vision. Hassler meets one of the best
California men in the tournament. In
fact Max Felix, who will be Hassler's
opponent, has a reputation holding over
from last term, when he won several
matches between the Army and Navy
units stationed in California. This bout
has the ear marks of a rip-roaring good
encounter.
Ingram, the California bear-cat seek
ing honors in the welterweight divisioin,
will be taken care of by Joe Murphy
This promises to be a closely contested
match; California is giving Ingram a
little the edge of the pre-fight chances.
Mike Scott and Joe Mandle will rep
resent Stanford in the lightweight and
featherweight divisions. Mike has
shown consistent progress during the
year and is one of the most likely box
ers in Stanford's aggregation. Mandle
has a fighting heart that will prove an

asset when the gong rings tonight.
After looking over the eligibles, a
prophecy as to the outcome of the meet
is in order; but prophecies in boxing
tournaments in which new men are
contenders are too easily upset to make
it worth while. Stanford men have all
the requisities of good boxers. Every
man entering tonight is known to be
game; each one has a sufficient
knowledge of the game to make him a
worthy contender in ordinary amateur
tournaments. However, the newness
of the game to the men and the added
fact that the\ are pitted against stran-

gers for the first time, in strange sur
roundings, may detract slightly from
their real ability. The experienced
boxer is prone to listening to the crowd
surrounding him and consequently for
gets many of the finer points of the
game. Nevertheless, the fighting heart
possessed by all the Cardinal men will
be a dependable factor in to-night's en
gagement, and another Cardinal victory
is looked for.
George Green, boxing instructor at
the Olympic Club, will not act as ref
eree as was lirst supposed, but will ac
company the Cardinal men and act as
chief second in their corner. This will
guarantee the men the advice of one
who has spent a lifetime in instructing
boxers and guiding them in the ring. A
good second in a boxer's corner instills
confidence in the boxer.. The second
on the other hand is able to see many
things from the outside that the boxer
misses, and can advise the contender
between rounds. Green knows boxing
from every angle, and is a cool, collect
ed second.
The freshman boxing team will ac-'
company the Cardinal boxers across the
bay and compete with California's
young Hercules' to-night.

Ross, Wheatley, Kegley, and Lytel. has
been successfully filled by men pos
session all the requisites of a fighting
man.
This year the Cardinal has been handi
capped in not having a full-fledged
heavyweight, but is blessed in being
able to put a contender in the ring for
heavy weight honors, who, while not a
heavyweight, is a worthy contender for
lirst place in this event. "Fat" Howell
is the man. He tips the scale at 158
pounds, but carries around with him
such a 2000 pounds of nerve and kick in
either hand as would make a mule en
vious. "Fat" will cross horns with
Morsehead of California, a little fellow
weighing 187 pounds.
Van Cleaf will endeavor to duplicate
Kegley's act of last year when he
climbed into the ring with California's
light heavyweight. Van will he a
little lighter than his opponent, but
his gameness welded with a terrific
right punch will make him almost for
midable against the average amateur.
Hassler, another new man, will fly
Stanford colors in the middleweight di
vision. Hassler meets one of the best
California men in the tournament. In
fact Max Felix, who will be Hassler's
opponent, has a reputation holding over
from last term, when he won several
matches between the Army and Navy
units stationed in California. This bout
has the ear marks of a rip-roaring good
encounter.
Ingram, the California bear-cat seek
ing honors in the welterweight divisioin,
will be taken care of by Joe Murphy
This promises to be a closely contested
match; California is giving Ingram a
little the edge of the pre-fight chances.
Mike Scott and Joe Mandle will rep
resent Stanford in the lightweight and
featherweight divisions. Mike has
shown consistent progress during the
year and is one of the most likely box
ers in Stanford's aggregation. Mandle
has a fighting heart that will prove an

asset when the gong rings tonight.
After looking over the eligibles, a
prophecy as to the outcome of the meet
is in order; but prophecies in boxing
tournaments in which new men are
contenders are too easily upset to make
it worth while. Stanford men have all
the requisities of good boxers. Every
man entering tonight is known to be
game; each one has a sufficient
knowledge of the game to make him a
worthy contender in ordinary amateur
tournaments. However, the newness
of the game to the men and the added
fact that the\ are pitted against stran-

gers for the first time, in strange sur
roundings, may detract slightly from
their real ability. The experienced
boxer is prone to listening to the crowd
surrounding him and consequently for
gets many of the finer points of the
game. Nevertheless, the fighting heart
possessed by all the Cardinal men will
be a dependable factor in to-night's en
gagement, and another Cardinal victory
is looked for.
George Green, boxing instructor at
the Olympic Club, will not act as ref
eree as was lirst supposed, but will ac
company the Cardinal men and act as
chief second in their corner. This will
guarantee the men the advice of one
who has spent a lifetime in instructing
boxers and guiding them in the ring. A
good second in a boxer's corner instills
confidence in the boxer.. The second
on the other hand is able to see many
things from the outside that the boxer
misses, and can advise the contender
between rounds. Green knows boxing
from every angle, and is a cool, collect
ed second.
The freshman boxing team will ac-'
company the Cardinal boxers across the
bay and compete with California's
young Hercules' to-night.
