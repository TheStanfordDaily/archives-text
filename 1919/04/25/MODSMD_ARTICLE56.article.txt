# STANFORD TO DEBATE FOR JOFFRE MEDAL
## 
### Miller L. McClintock, '17 
THE first post-war Medaille Joffre debate is of unusual significance. The
purpose of Baron Pierre de Coubertin, who founded the debate in 1894.
was to give the students of Stanford University not only an intimate knowl
edge of French political and social affairs, but to stimulate a love and rever
ence for the noble institutions of the Republic of France.
Today, when so many of our friends and fellow-students have fought and
died on French soil, this feeling of fraternity with France is stronger and
deeper among Stanford students than had ever been hoped by Baron de Cou
bertin.
The second Joffre debate, which will be held in the Assembly Hall tonight
at S o'clock, affords Stanford students, in addition to the pleasure in hearing
a keen fight, the opportunity to pay reverence to "Papa" Joffre, the hero of
the Marne, through M. Julien Neltner, Consul General of France, who will
be the presiding officer.
The debate is known to old Stanford men as the Carnot. The name
was changed to the Joffre last year. The following extract from a letter by
Baron de Coubertin at that time gives interesting details of the change:
"The medal which it lias afforded me great pleasure to give to the California
universities since 1894 will henceforth be known as the Medaille Joffre.
'Marshal Joffre kindly consented, and wrote me a letter of acceptance,
using the most friendly words toward California and expressing his best
wishes for both universities and their students.
"President Poincare will hand over the medals ... to the American
Ambassador; and I hope Marshal Joffre will be present, although it is done
in a rather intimate way, owing to the circumstances."
The severity of the regulations governing the discussion are in keeping
with the honor which accrues to the individual speaker winning the medal.
The Stanford and California contestants have been studying the general
question of "The Future Colonial Policy of France" for the past two months.
But it is not until 6 o'clock tonight that the final question will be taken from
its sealed package and given to the contestants. As soon as the sides and
places have been chosen by lot, the individual debaters are locked in separate
rooms to prepare their speeches for presentation at 8 o'clock.
The debate has always been noted for the high type of speaking ability
which it has been able to stimulate, despite the rigid regulations.
It is significant that during the twenty-six years which the medal has
been awarded, it has gone seventeen times to speakers from the University
of California.
