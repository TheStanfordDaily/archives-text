# THE 						TRUTH ABOUT THE SITUATION AT CHATEAU THIERRY LAST SUMMER
## 
### George M. Kyle, '18 
IN the month of June last year our
squadron was stationed ■ north of
Paris on the borders of the Picardy
country. 1 lie great German drive
which broke the French lines along the
C hemin-de-Dames had just taken placfc
and the front went in a deeply curved
salient from Reims to a little north of
Noyons. The war had reached a criti
cal period and both sides were staking
everything on desperate chances: the
I'rench by trying to hold the front with
as few men as possible, and the Boches
by throwing in all they had in a last
desperate effort to break the Allies be
fore the \nnricans arrived in force.
In two tremendous efforts they had
forced the British within striking dis
tance of Amiens and the French within
striking distance of Paris. The prob
lem before hoch was to determine
where the new attack was going to take
place. This was answered by the Poche
themselves. In their anxiety to rush
matters to the issue they threw aside
the careful precaution they had former
ly employed in their movement of
troops and material. The allied ob
servation planes soon possesed a rather
detailed knowledge of the features of
the forthcoming drive.
Marshal Foch was now in a position
to count on some definite plan of .offen
sive as well as defensive action. With
the knowledge he possessed of the Ger
man preparations he knew they were
staking everything on this coming at
tack and knowing that, now, with the
aid of the American forces, he possessed
a numerical superiority, he decided to
launch the allied attack as soon as he
had smothered the enemy's effort.
In defending a large semi-circular
front such as the one which faced the
Allies at this titne, the great and vital
necessity was to hold firm on the two
wings. The attacking force does not
dare advance too far in the centre if the
wings are stationary, for they thus ex
pose themselves to being caught in a
trap should the defenders suddenly
counter-attack on the wings. This was
what Marshal Foch was planning on.
He placed his crack divisions on the
two important sectors and in the centre
put the remaining French troops bol
stered up with a couple of American
divisions.
The attack took place July 15, but
these preparations were being made as
far back as June 15 or immediately fol
lowing the French disaster along the
Chemin-de-Dames. The countryside
around our aerodrome was filled with
American troops and the old peasants
gazed with curiosity, war-tired as they
were, at the spectacle of their roads and
walks filled with these khaki clad stran
gers. These men were representatives
that the country could be proud of. If
they had been allowed to tell the story
of Chateau-Thierry instead of sensation
seeking of Hearst-paid reporters, we
would not have had al the wild tales of
the battle that we now possess.
The American troops at the start of
the battle held about four miles of a
forty-mile front. They were in the cen
tre, placed no doubt to bolster up the
mediocre French troops there, and were
not in the position of importance that

the American journals would have us
believe. The first impact of the
Bodies' drive wreckod itself on the
clever defense that General Gouraud
had prepared in the sector from Cham
pagne to Reims and also was stopped
with no appreciable gain in the part
south of Soissons. In the centre, how
ever. they made quite a bit of progress
and at last attained the village of Cha
teau Thierry. The French general
commanding in the centre saw that he
was up against better troops for the
moment, but allowed a momentary re
treat to take place. He knew that with
tlie wings holding the Bodies would not
dare follow too far. -The little block
of American troops had now been
rushed into the fray. Knowing that
they were directly north of Paris and
only seventy miles away, and seeing
French troops retreating, they thought
that the whole fate of the battle rested
in their hands. They refused to re
treat with the others therefore and put
up a desperate resistance against the
Germans, who were in overwhelmingly
superior numbers. It was a marvelous
exhibition of fighting and one that
ranks with that of Thermopylus, but
it was not entirely necessary. The
Americans suffered terrific losses .and
some regiments were nearly annihilated,
but this was counterbalanced by the
optimism infused into the allied soldieirs
in seeing that their new men could
fight so well. The next r''iy Marshal
Foch counter attacked, and if the Ger
mans had advanced too far in the cen
tre after the retreating French, lie
would have caught almost an entire
army in a trap, because they had 110
idea that the Allies were in a position
to counter attack.
This is the story of the battle as I
saw it and had it explained by the
French officers in the squadron who
were in a position to know what the
French plan of attack really was. The
position of America jumped from a
low place to a very high one as a re
sult of this and the succeeding battles.
Europe, having only our newspapers to
judge us by, had classified us as a na
tion of blusterers and braggarts. Ac
cording to the journals we had l". ...
ands of aeroplanes and guns and an
army of organization that, was the mar
vel of the world. They being in a posi
tion to see this organization, could
hardly fit the facts with the headlines.
But Chateau Thierry and St. Mihiel
and the Argonne showed to the world
the American as he is, and that he does
have a thought about something other
than self-interest from time to time.
Speaking of self-interest, the Europeans
are 110 half-hearted exponents of this
little game themselves, and as for ideals,
whenever they find any new ones to
exploit, they always end up by coming
to this "tyrannical" country. It may
be run by self-seeking capitalists but
the revolutionists never find the "free
dom" to hatch their revolutions save
here in the land of iniquity.

Marshal Foch was now in a position
to count on some definite plan of .offen
sive as well as defensive action. With
the knowledge he possessed of the Ger
man preparations he knew they were
staking everything on this coming at
tack and knowing that, now, with the
aid of the American forces, he possessed
a numerical superiority, he decided to
launch the allied attack as soon as he
had smothered the enemy's effort.
In defending a large semi-circular
front such as the one which faced the
Allies at this titne, the great and vital
necessity was to hold firm on the two
wings. The attacking force does not
dare advance too far in the centre if the
wings are stationary, for they thus ex
pose themselves to being caught in a
trap should the defenders suddenly
counter-attack on the wings. This was
what Marshal Foch was planning on.
He placed his crack divisions on the
two important sectors and in the centre
put the remaining French troops bol
stered up with a couple of American
divisions.
The attack took place July 15, but
these preparations were being made as
far back as June 15 or immediately fol
lowing the French disaster along the
Chemin-de-Dames. The countryside
around our aerodrome was filled with
American troops and the old peasants
gazed with curiosity, war-tired as they
were, at the spectacle of their roads and
walks filled with these khaki clad stran
gers. These men were representatives
that the country could be proud of. If
they had been allowed to tell the story
of Chateau-Thierry instead of sensation
seeking of Hearst-paid reporters, we
would not have had al the wild tales of
the battle that we now possess.
The American troops at the start of
the battle held about four miles of a
forty-mile front. They were in the cen
tre, placed no doubt to bolster up the
mediocre French troops there, and were
not in the position of importance that

the American journals would have us
believe. The first impact of the
Bodies' drive wreckod itself on the
clever defense that General Gouraud
had prepared in the sector from Cham
pagne to Reims and also was stopped
with no appreciable gain in the part
south of Soissons. In the centre, how
ever. they made quite a bit of progress
and at last attained the village of Cha
teau Thierry. The French general
commanding in the centre saw that he
was up against better troops for the
moment, but allowed a momentary re
treat to take place. He knew that with
tlie wings holding the Bodies would not
dare follow too far. -The little block
of American troops had now been
rushed into the fray. Knowing that
they were directly north of Paris and
only seventy miles away, and seeing
French troops retreating, they thought
that the whole fate of the battle rested
in their hands. They refused to re
treat with the others therefore and put
up a desperate resistance against the
Germans, who were in overwhelmingly
superior numbers. It was a marvelous
exhibition of fighting and one that
ranks with that of Thermopylus, but
it was not entirely necessary. The
Americans suffered terrific losses .and
some regiments were nearly annihilated,
but this was counterbalanced by the
optimism infused into the allied soldieirs
in seeing that their new men could
fight so well. The next r''iy Marshal
Foch counter attacked, and if the Ger
mans had advanced too far in the cen
tre after the retreating French, lie
would have caught almost an entire
army in a trap, because they had 110
idea that the Allies were in a position
to counter attack.
This is the story of the battle as I
saw it and had it explained by the
French officers in the squadron who
were in a position to know what the
French plan of attack really was. The
position of America jumped from a
low place to a very high one as a re
sult of this and the succeeding battles.
Europe, having only our newspapers to
judge us by, had classified us as a na
tion of blusterers and braggarts. Ac
cording to the journals we had l". ...
ands of aeroplanes and guns and an
army of organization that, was the mar
vel of the world. They being in a posi
tion to see this organization, could
hardly fit the facts with the headlines.
But Chateau Thierry and St. Mihiel
and the Argonne showed to the world
the American as he is, and that he does
have a thought about something other
than self-interest from time to time.
Speaking of self-interest, the Europeans
are 110 half-hearted exponents of this
little game themselves, and as for ideals,
whenever they find any new ones to
exploit, they always end up by coming
to this "tyrannical" country. It may
be run by self-seeking capitalists but
the revolutionists never find the "free
dom" to hatch their revolutions save
here in the land of iniquity.

American troops and the old peasants
gazed with curiosity, war-tired as they
were, at the spectacle of their roads and
walks filled with these khaki clad stran
gers. These men were representatives
that the country could be proud of. If
they had been allowed to tell the story
of Chateau-Thierry instead of sensation
seeking of Hearst-paid reporters, we
would not have had al the wild tales of
the battle that we now possess.
The American troops at the start of
the battle held about four miles of a
forty-mile front. They were in the cen
tre, placed no doubt to bolster up the
mediocre French troops there, and were
not in the position of importance that

the American journals would have us
believe. The first impact of the
Bodies' drive wreckod itself on the
clever defense that General Gouraud
had prepared in the sector from Cham
pagne to Reims and also was stopped
with no appreciable gain in the part
south of Soissons. In the centre, how
ever. they made quite a bit of progress
and at last attained the village of Cha
teau Thierry. The French general
commanding in the centre saw that he
was up against better troops for the
moment, but allowed a momentary re
treat to take place. He knew that with
tlie wings holding the Bodies would not
dare follow too far. -The little block
of American troops had now been
rushed into the fray. Knowing that
they were directly north of Paris and
only seventy miles away, and seeing
French troops retreating, they thought
that the whole fate of the battle rested
in their hands. They refused to re
treat with the others therefore and put
up a desperate resistance against the
Germans, who were in overwhelmingly
superior numbers. It was a marvelous
exhibition of fighting and one that
ranks with that of Thermopylus, but
it was not entirely necessary. The
Americans suffered terrific losses .and
some regiments were nearly annihilated,
but this was counterbalanced by the
optimism infused into the allied soldieirs
in seeing that their new men could
fight so well. The next r''iy Marshal
Foch counter attacked, and if the Ger
mans had advanced too far in the cen
tre after the retreating French, lie
would have caught almost an entire
army in a trap, because they had 110
idea that the Allies were in a position
to counter attack.
This is the story of the battle as I
saw it and had it explained by the
French officers in the squadron who
were in a position to know what the
French plan of attack really was. The
position of America jumped from a
low place to a very high one as a re
sult of this and the succeeding battles.
Europe, having only our newspapers to
judge us by, had classified us as a na
tion of blusterers and braggarts. Ac
cording to the journals we had l". ...
ands of aeroplanes and guns and an
army of organization that, was the mar
vel of the world. They being in a posi
tion to see this organization, could
hardly fit the facts with the headlines.
But Chateau Thierry and St. Mihiel
and the Argonne showed to the world
the American as he is, and that he does
have a thought about something other
than self-interest from time to time.
Speaking of self-interest, the Europeans
are 110 half-hearted exponents of this
little game themselves, and as for ideals,
whenever they find any new ones to
exploit, they always end up by coming
to this "tyrannical" country. It may
be run by self-seeking capitalists but
the revolutionists never find the "free
dom" to hatch their revolutions save
here in the land of iniquity.

went to France in February 1917 in the
first Stanford Ambulance Unit. He
later served with a French Squadron for
ten months over the lines.
IN the month of June last year our
squadron was stationed ■ north of
Paris on the borders of the Picardy
country. 1 lie great German drive
which broke the French lines along the
C hemin-de-Dames had just taken placfc
and the front went in a deeply curved
salient from Reims to a little north of
Noyons. The war had reached a criti
cal period and both sides were staking
everything on desperate chances: the
I'rench by trying to hold the front with
as few men as possible, and the Boches
by throwing in all they had in a last
desperate effort to break the Allies be
fore the \nnricans arrived in force.
In two tremendous efforts they had
forced the British within striking dis
tance of Amiens and the French within
striking distance of Paris. The prob
lem before hoch was to determine
where the new attack was going to take
place. This was answered by the Poche
themselves. In their anxiety to rush
matters to the issue they threw aside
the careful precaution they had former
ly employed in their movement of
troops and material. The allied ob
servation planes soon possesed a rather
detailed knowledge of the features of
the forthcoming drive.
Marshal Foch was now in a position
to count on some definite plan of .offen
sive as well as defensive action. With
the knowledge he possessed of the Ger
man preparations he knew they were
staking everything on this coming at
tack and knowing that, now, with the
aid of the American forces, he possessed
a numerical superiority, he decided to
launch the allied attack as soon as he
had smothered the enemy's effort.
In defending a large semi-circular
front such as the one which faced the
Allies at this titne, the great and vital
necessity was to hold firm on the two
wings. The attacking force does not
dare advance too far in the centre if the
wings are stationary, for they thus ex
pose themselves to being caught in a
trap should the defenders suddenly
counter-attack on the wings. This was
what Marshal Foch was planning on.
He placed his crack divisions on the
two important sectors and in the centre
put the remaining French troops bol
stered up with a couple of American
divisions.
The attack took place July 15, but
these preparations were being made as
far back as June 15 or immediately fol
lowing the French disaster along the
Chemin-de-Dames. The countryside
around our aerodrome was filled with
American troops and the old peasants
gazed with curiosity, war-tired as they
were, at the spectacle of their roads and
