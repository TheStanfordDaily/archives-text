# CARDINAL TENNIS MEN ENTER SOUTHERN MEET
## 
### 
Allyn Barber, '18, and Jimmy Davies,
'22, arc representing Stanford at the
tennis tournament that is being fought
at Santa Barbara today and tomorrow.
All the best players on the coast will
be seen in action at this tournament
and so some of the fastest sets of the
year are usually played.
Barber and Davies have entered in
both the collegiate and open singles and
doubles. Last year Davies won the
collegiate singles and was a member of
the team that was the runner-up in the
doubles. Barber's game is one of the
best that has been seen around this part
of the country this year.
