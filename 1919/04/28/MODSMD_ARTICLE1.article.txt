# VARSITY AND FROSH TRACK MEN LOSE TO VISITORS
## Cardinal Varsity Loses to Olympic Club 70 4-5-57 1-5 
### 
STANFORD'S Varsity track team
team fell a victim to the Olympic
Club's speedy aggregation, Saturday
afternoon, by a score of 70 4-5 to 57 1-5.
The entire meet was the hardest fought
one that has been seen on the local
oval this season, and showed the
Cardinal's weeknesses and strong points
up to good advantage.
Although California defeated the
Winged "O" runners a week ago, the
results of this meet do not necessarily
show that the Cardinal squad is weaker
than the Blue and Gold team. The
presence of I.illy, Caughey and Pelouze,
who were playing with the baseball
team, would have transferred at least
thirteen points to Stanford's side of
the score, materially changing it's
aspects.
Improvement in Times
Times and distances of this meet
were considerably faster than those in
the contest between the Olympic Club
and California. In the two-mile. Farm
er and Churchill came through with a
wonderful exhibition of speed and easi
ly took two places.
Eddie Stout, Winged "O" miler, won
both the mole, and half-mile, nosing
out the Stanford runnens in each case
on the final spurt, just before reaching
the tape. Saturday's performance show
ed a good comparison between t lie Stan
ford and California mile runners. Al
though Sprott was able to beat Stout
in 4 minutes and 40 seconds, the Cardi
nal distance men forced him to do 6
and 3-5 seconds faster to place here.
Wells was off form in the hurdles in
Saturday's contest and disqualified in
the 120-yard event.
Several foimier Stanford men com
peted for the Olympic Club among
whom were Johnny Norton, famous
hurdler. Harry Lockmond. and Dever
aux, an ex-'2l-man. Norton came
through in his old-time style, taking both
hurdle events.
Stanford won the relay by default.

both the mole, and half-mile, nosing
out the Stanford runnens in each case
on the final spurt, just before reaching
the tape. Saturday's performance show
ed a good comparison between t lie Stan

nal distance men forced him to do 6
and 3-5 seconds faster to place here.
Wells was off form in the hurdles in
Saturday's contest and disqualified in
the 120-yard event.
Several foimier Stanford men com
peted for the Olympic Club among

aux, an ex-'2l-man. Norton came
through in his old-time style, taking both
hurdle events.

STANFORD'S Varsity track team
team fell a victim to the Olympic
Club's speedy aggregation, Saturday
afternoon, by a score of 70 4-5 to 57 1-5.
The entire meet was the hardest fought
one that has been seen on the local
oval this season, and showed the
Cardinal's weeknesses and strong points
up to good advantage.
Although California defeated the
Winged "O" runners a week ago, the
results of this meet do not necessarily
show that the Cardinal squad is weaker
than the Blue and Gold team. The
presence of I.illy, Caughey and Pelouze,
who were playing with the baseball
team, would have transferred at least
thirteen points to Stanford's side of
the score, materially changing it's
aspects.
