# VARSITY AND FROSH TRACK MEN LOSE TO VISITORS
## Cardinal Varsity Loses to Olympic Club 70 4-5-57 1-5 
### 
STANFORD'S Varsity track team
team fell a victim to the Olympic
Club's speedy aggregation, Saturday
afternoon, by a score of 70 4-5 to 57 1-5.
The entire meet was the hardest fought
one that has been seen on the local

both the mole, and half-mile, nosing
out the Stanford runnens in each case
on the final spurt, just before reaching
the tape. Saturday's performance show
ed a good comparison between t lie Stan
ford and California mile runners. Al

in 4 minutes and 40 seconds, the Cardi

and 3-5 seconds faster to place here.
Wells was off form in the hurdles in
Saturday's contest and disqualified in
the 120-yard event.
Several foimier Stanford men com

whom were Johnny Norton, famous
hurdler. Harry Lockmond. and Dever
