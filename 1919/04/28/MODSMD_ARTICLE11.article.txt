# STANFORD VARSITY WINS BASEBALL SERIES
## Cardinal Takes Second Game From California by 5to2 
### 
FOR the lirst time since 1913, the
Stanford baseball Varsity annexed
the series from the University of Cali
fornia, by winning the second game of
tiie series on the Berkeley grounds, by
the score of 5 to 2. Pelouze worked in
the box for the Cardinals, and his ex
cellent work, coupled with errorless sup
port on the part of the team behind
him, held the Blue and Gold team down
and won the game for Stanford. The
first game was won at Stanford by the
score of 5 to 3.
Pelouze held down the California men
to five hits, while Stanford collected
six off from the delivery of Trefts, the
California hurler. Pelouze worked well
in the pinches, and pulled out of several
holes with the ease of a veteran. Trefts
pitched a good game, but his support
weakened at critical moments, and piled
up three boots in the error column.
Captain "Jim" Galloway scored the
lirst Stanford run in the fifth inning,
when he singled, stole second, went to
third on Kallam's infield out, and scored
on Hundy's safe blow through third.
Three runs were score in the eighth in
ning by Kallam, Kline and Teubner.
which put Stanford ahead, and won the
game. Kallam singled and advanced to
second when Kline walked. Both men
advanced on Bundy's infield out and
scored when Teubner's smash over sec
ond base was booted by the short stop.
Teubner scored on Pelotize's hit to the
infield, which White threw wild to first
base.
The final run of the game was made
in the ninth inning. Pike got to first on
an error and stole second. He advanced
to third on Kallam's grounder to sec
ond and scored on Kline's fly to left
field.
California scored the first run of the
game in the second inning. Champion
beat out a ground ball to short stop and
stole second. He went to third on Dex
ter's infield out and scored on Smith's
deep fly to center field. Other Cali
fornia run came across the rubber in
the seventh inning while the California
rooters, according to custom, stood up
during the critical inning. Dexter, cap
tain of the Blue and Gold team, con
nected with one of Pelouze's fast ones
for a drive to left center field which
netted him three sacks. Lilly, who had
already made two sensational catches,
was unable to reach the ball. Dexter
| scored on Smith's fly to Lilly, closing
California's run column and her chance
for the series.
Since this is the first baseball series
that Stanford lias won in six years,
members of the Varsity are trying to
secure a trip for the team in place of
the proposed journeys California Varsi
ty had lined up. Executive Manager
Watson of California had planned a trip
through the Northwest and also tenta
tive arrangements have been made for a
trip to the Hawaiian Islands. However,
California has dropped the seiies to
Stanford, and the Cardinal team is the
lobical.club for either of these journeys.
