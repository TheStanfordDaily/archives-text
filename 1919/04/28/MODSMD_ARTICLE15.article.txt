# HOLIDAY FOR A BIG DAY
## 
### 
ihe victorious return of the Stanford ball team from
«k MjS unexpected triumph across the bay, the Daily takes
l^is opportunity of extending the hand of congratulation to the
coach, captain, and players for the first series won since 1913.
With one more major test of the athletic year coming in a dual dose next
Saturday, the hopes of the Cardinal are centered on a triple victory for the
spring year, baseball, track, and crew.
In an endeavor to foster the coming contests in a manner fitting the im
portance of the event, we hope that the university authorities will grant a
holiday for the occasion. Holidays are not too prevalent in the college cal
endar to be unwelcome when they are finally granted. For the big athletic
fiesta of the year, the hopes of expectant members of the student body are
that the faculty will co-operate in making Saturday a big day for Stanford by
declaring a university holiday.
It would be unfortunate if any were prevented from attending the crew
race in the morning or in journeying to California in time for the track meet
in the afternoon because they were blessed with Saturday morning classes.
It is not a spirit of evading work that prompts the appeal for a university
holiday, but merely a desire towards co-operation between all branches of
activities and enterprises of the university. Even the athletic enterprises
have their due and respectd places in the ranks of public activities.
The events of Saturday comprise the big athletic contests of the year
and make Saturday the big day in the spring calendar. Rather than leave the
matter to the discretion and leniency of the various proffessors a more uni
form and thus more beneficial result would be obtained by the declaration of
the day as a university holiday. The moral effect would be exceptionally
great in showing the co-operation of the faculty in the clean and worthy en
terprises of the student body and in impressing the importance of the day
upon the members of the Stanford family.
