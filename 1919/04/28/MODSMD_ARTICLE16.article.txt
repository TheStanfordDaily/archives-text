# STANFORD WRESTLERS TO MEET U.C. FRIDAY
## 
### 
Stanford wrestlers meet their Bruin
ite rivals on â€¢tlfe Encina mats on Fri
day evening for the annual intercol
legiate matches. The locals are show
ing fighting spirit, and, according to
the coach, chances for winning the meet
are exceedingly good this year. A
strong team and the large number of
men out for the activity have secured
the necessary support that a winning
Cardinal needs.
Word has just been received at Stan
ford from Ardouin of the San Fran
cisco* "Y," that arrangements have been
made to have the Stanford varsity and
freshmen wrestlers perform before the
various army headquarters in the city.

Beginning on May 7, Coach Jones will
take a full team of first string wrestlers,
two jiujitsu experts, and two Japanese
fencers to San Francisco for exhibition
performances before one of the army
cantonments. The performances, of
which there will be four and the ex
penses of which will be paid by Ar
douin of San Francisco, will be given
for the benefit of the soldiers in these
cantonments. The trips will afford the
men on the wrestling teams some good
experience.
