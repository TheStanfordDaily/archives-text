## 
### 
DEFEATED by the largest score that
lias been seen in the five years of
competition between the freshmen of
Stanford and California, the Bruin
cubs walked over the Cardinal babes
on the oval to a tune of 89-24. Though
the freshmen have never won a meet,
the score made by the California
babes last Saturday was the largest
on record.
The stellar work of Captain Schlau
deman for the Stanford babes was a
feature of the meet, preventing the
score from being even worse than it
was. One-half the points that were
made by Stanford were credited to
Schlaudeman. He was entered in five
efents and placed in three of them.
Two seconds and a tie for first was
credited to him. He would have un
doubtedly been able to take first in
the pole vault if he had been forced
to it.
Because of Parmalee being declared
ineligible, the Bruins walked away
with all the sprints. Minshall and Pur
cell came through in the low hurdles
for second and third, respectively.
Larson took third in the 440 and
Meyer captured second in the mile.
Hays sprung the big surprise for Stan
ford when he tied for first with
Schlaudeman in the pole vault. Ger
son placed second jn the half after
giving Saunders of California a hard
fight, for first. Carson was the in
dividual star of the meet, scoring
eleven points for California.
