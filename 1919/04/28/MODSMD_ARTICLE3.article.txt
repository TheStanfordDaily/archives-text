# WASHINGTON EIGHTS AT U.C.
## 
### 
Washington's three crews arrived in
Berkeley yesterday afternoon, to put
in several clays of practice on the
Oakland estuary, before the big re
gatta next Saturday morning. The
varsity, second varsity and freshman
crews left by boat last Friday night,
and thereby only lost one day of train
ing.
Owing to the fact that all three uni
versities have unusually strong fresh
man crews, the race between the first
year boats is to be one of the features
of this year's races. California has a
strong 1922 shell, and during the first
part of the season the U. C. varsity
paddlers were being beaten by it.
Very little dope has been received
about the northern oarsmen, but it

is rumored that their babes have the
usual fast boat.
"Husky" Guerena said that he was
proud of the Cardinal freshman shell,
because it had hard working men
from bow to stern. . Hancock and Olm
stead are probably the two strongest
rowers on the eight. Olmstead is
stroke, while Hancock sits at number
seven. They set the pace for the boat
and according to Coach Rogers, it is
some fast pace.
All the other men in the boat are
in the prime of condition for the two
mile grind on May 3. There are no
weak spots in the boat, nor is there
any particular star. Rogers is de
pending on the combined strength of
(S), third. Time, :17.1.
440 yards—Gallagher (C), first;
Leonard (C), second; Larson (S)
third. Time, :53.4.
220 yards—Lupton (C), first; Hen
drickson (C), second; Railsback (C),
third. Time, :22.3.
Shot-put—Nesbit (C), first; Jacob
son (C), second; Schiller (C), third.
Distance, 40 feet 1 inch.
220-yard hurdles —McDonald (C),
first; Henderson (C), second; Gal
braith (C), third. Time, :26 flat.
880 yards—Saunders (C), first; Uer
son (S), second; Hanniford (C), third.
Time, 2:08.1.
Discus —Nesbit (C), first; Schiller
(('). second; Carson (C), third. Dis
tance, 108 feet lit inches.
High jump—Carson (C), first;
Schlaudemau (S) and Hutchinson (C),
tied for second. Height, 5 feet 8
inches.
Pole vault —Schlaudeman (S) and
Hays (S), tied for first; Peterson (C).
third. Height., 11 feet 5 inches.
High jump—Carson (C), first;
Schlaudeman (S), second; Field (C),
third. Distance, 21 feet 4 1-2 inches.
Relay—Won by California. Time,
3:40.
Score —California, 8!); Stanford, 24.

the eight men for a Cardinal victory.
The eight will probably be lined up
for the race against the U. C. and
Washington freshmen as follows:
Olmstead, stroke; Hancock, seven;
McKinnon, six; Snow, five; Brieson,
four; Adams, three; Sayre, two; Ma
loney, bow; and Boucher, coxswain.

the eight men for a Cardinal victory.
The eight will probably be lined up
for the race against the U. C. and
Washington freshmen as follows:
Olmstead, stroke; Hancock, seven;
McKinnon, six; Snow, five; Brieson,
four; Adams, three; Sayre, two; Ma
loney, bow; and Boucher, coxswain.
Washington's three crews arrived in
Berkeley yesterday afternoon, to put
in several clays of practice on the
Oakland estuary, before the big re
gatta next Saturday morning. The
varsity, second varsity and freshman
crews left by boat last Friday night,
and thereby only lost one day of train
ing.
Owing to the fact that all three uni
versities have unusually strong fresh
man crews, the race between the first
year boats is to be one of the features
of this year's races. California has a
strong 1922 shell, and during the first
part of the season the U. C. varsity
paddlers were being beaten by it.
Very little dope has been received
about the northern oarsmen, but it

is rumored that their babes have the
usual fast boat.
"Husky" Guerena said that he was
proud of the Cardinal freshman shell,
because it had hard working men
from bow to stern. . Hancock and Olm
stead are probably the two strongest
rowers on the eight. Olmstead is
stroke, while Hancock sits at number
seven. They set the pace for the boat
and according to Coach Rogers, it is
some fast pace.
All the other men in the boat are
in the prime of condition for the two
mile grind on May 3. There are no
weak spots in the boat, nor is there
any particular star. Rogers is de
pending on the combined strength of
(S), third. Time, :17.1.
