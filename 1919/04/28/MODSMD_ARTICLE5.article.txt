# CALIFORNIA WINS JOFFRE ARGUMENT
## 
### 
The twenty-eighth Medaille Joffre
Debate, which it is said by old debat
ing men was the best attended forensic
ever held on the Stanford campus, was
won last Friday evening by Joseph J.
Posner of the University of California.
The outstanding feature of the dis
cussion was the lighting spirit shown
by the speakers of both universities.
The subject, which was given out at
6 o'clock, "Resolved, that Morocco
should be internationalized, with France
as a mandatory responsible for its af
fairs,'' was excellently chosen by Pro
fessor O'Neil of the University of Wis
consin, because of tis present-day im
portance.
It was approached by all of the
speakers, not as a subject for an ora
tion, but as a vital issue worth fighting
for.
William Leiser, the first affirmative
speaker, delivered a spl ndid expository
speech, giving the proper basis and tone
for the entire debate.
Knight, the first speaker on the nega
tive, gave what was considered by many
as the most spirited speech of the even
ing.
Posner's speech was marked by an
easy delivery and clear, forecfnl argu
ments, combining well the elements of
force and thought.
Blote was at hi sliest. His speech was
one of the best of the evening, and was
undoubtedly a close second in the minds
of the judges.
Miss Little and W. N. Green delivered
interesting discussions.
The most delightful feature of the
debate was the charming manner in
which M. Julien Neltner, Consul Gen
eral of France, introduced the subject
and the speakers. In intorducing lÂ»lote.
he paid a tribute to him and the other
members of the First Stanford Ambu
lance Unit for their services to France.
The judges, Judge John J. Van
Nostrand, Marshall Hale and (). K.
Cushing, were in conference for less
than five minutes, Posner having been
apparently the choice of all.
Coach McClintock was entirely satis
fied with the work of his men. While
Stanford failed to get the medal, the
Stanford men undoubtedly averaged
higher than their opponents.
Ihe enthusiastic audience of more
than 600 insures that with continued
support for the coming U. S. C. debate,
it will be possible to have competition
with Columbia or Harvard or some
other eastern university next year.
