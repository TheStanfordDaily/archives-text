### 
With the backing of a large number
of St. Mary's rooters the St. Mary s
College swimming team, with its Lane-
Kruger-Schroth combination, had not
much difficulty in defeating the Stanford
swimmers at Neptune Beach last Satur
day, to the tune of 40 to 28 . Stanford
was greatly handicapped by the absence
of Caughey. Pelouzc and Kline, who
were unable to swim because of their
participation in the Stanford-California
baseball game.
Both Lane and Kruger arc champions
in their particular events, —the dashes
and the back stroke, respectively. Lane
captured the 50 yards and 100 yards
free style without much difficulty, and
Kruger won the 100 back storke and the
220 yards.
Lange succeeded in beating out God
dard for iirst place in the diving, to the
surprise of the spectators. Brooks
swam a great race, capturing the breast
stroke, and Webster was beaten out for
second place by a narrow margin. Web
ster captrued first in the plunge, with
Ankele second.
Kruger and Lane were the stars of
the meet for St. Mary's with two first
place each, for Stanford Webster scored
six points. Brooks and Lange each
scored five.
