Large Scale Expected
The meet Saturday will he the first
track opposition between the two uni
versities in two years not marred by
the back ground of war. Interest in
track has been reviving of recent months
and the big pre-war crowd is expected
to duplicate itself in the bleachers around
the transbay oval. Dopesters of the i'.lue
and Gold and Cardinal have been suf
ficiently energetic with their pencils of
recent date to create much speculation
upon the probable outcome of the meet.
Confidence in Stanford's chances were
stronger a week previous than they are
today, due to the defeat of the team at
the hands of the Olympic speedsters.
Saturday. There is still a feeling of
confidence, however, that the Stanford
team, strenghtened by the return of
Lilly, Caughey and Pelouze, will be able
to come through in sufficient style to
make it seven straight wins for the
Bruin speedsters. The novelty of hav
ing a track team actually living in a
training house is expected to bear fruit
in the meet against California as present
indications point to a better conditioned
team than even many of the victorious
groups of recent years.
