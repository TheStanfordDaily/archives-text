# WHY IS A JOLLY-UP?

nl IPrl^^ilM^MT l t ' le l -" uo when the All-Blacks, the visiting ltugby
teara from New Zealand, were 011 the campus and
prompted the first university jolly-up, jolly-ups have become a fea
ture of Stanford life and are now regarded in the nature of a tra
dition. It is the universal opinion that jolly-ups have in the recent occasions
of their appearance lost much of the charm that made them typical of Stan
ford democracy and informality.
One of the first features that appeals to the incoming class of both men
and women students annually has come to be the nature and character of
the jolly-ups. As get-together affairs they have not an equal. To acquaint
the men and women of the campus with each other in an informal manner
characteristic of the University itself, the jolly-up idea was ii great success.
When, however, as has happened conspicuously of recent times, the jolly-up
appears as a purely monetary consideration, it fails absolutely in its purpose.
It is easy to understand why an event of this sort becomes commercal
ized. Its very popularity tends to this. However, the time has come to either
abandon the jolly-up or revert to the jolly-up as originally intended. We
might suggest some changes, not the least of which would be abandonment
of new-fangled improvements to the jolly-up.
The jolly-up is not an institution for queeners, for introductions, for prize
dances, for stiff collars. It is an institution for informal enjoyment and de
velopment of a good democratic spirit. As such it is spoilt by those who
attempt to make it one of the "affairs" of the year, who queen to it, who em
barrass the roughs by wearing stiff collars and other luxuriant accessories.
It is spoilt by the desire of women of the campus to wait and be queened
rather than appear unescorted. It is spoilt by attempting to make a financial
success where only an informal get-together is desired.
Let's revert to the good old jolly-up of unescorted women, informal in
troductions, cords and semester shirts, and thus learn why a jolly-up exists.
