# FILMS OF WIRELESS APPARATUS WILL BE SHOWN AT MARQUEE
## 
### 
Films displaying the wireless appa
ratus of tlic Federal Wireless Station
in Palo Alto, and pictures of some of
the remarkable work produced there,
will be shown tonight and tomorrow
night, at the Marquee Theatre, under
the new release for public information
given by the government.
Extensive experiments have been go
ing on at the station, but tjio govern
ment censor lias withheld the results
from the public. Perhaps the greatest
work accomplished is the production
recently of an electric spark nine feet
in length which drives to the earth
500,000 volts and contains oscillations
of 65,000 cycles per second. This is
the first time in the history of the
scientific world that a spark of such
a length has ever been produced. It
was developed in special, high-voltage
laboratories constructed about a year
ago.
Experts on wireless telegraphy have
been sent here from Washington to
investigate the experiments. Radios
from the local station have been sent
to France, one having been sold re
cently to the city of Bordeaux for
$4,000,000; and the wireless equipment
oil the President's ship, George Wash
ington.
Three Stanford men have played an
important part in the work, A. L. An
derson, '17, working with Roland Marx,
'11, as electrical engineers, and H. I*.
Elliott, '10, acting as chief of the draft
ing department and production man
