"I sprained my ankle getting off the
street car the other day," remarked
a certain young woman to her most
confidential friend.
"That's nothing," remarked the
other, "I almost broke my perfectly
good neck trying to catch a jitney in I
the city yesterday.1 could only take j
little steps in this narrow skirt, and j
the situation called for long ones. 1
tried, but 1 missed that jitney by a j
j long way, and I felt more like an;
| order 112 r an ambulance when I picked j
myself up than anything else."
Why do you suppose women wear j
clothes like that? The only possible
answer, is that they want to be in
style, and this, whether necks and
ankles are sacrificed on the altar of
health and common sense or not.
Women (and incidentally, co-eds)
fuss and fume at the discomfort of
the present fashions, vow they can't
walk a block without becoming tired,
and then put on a dress with a low
neck reaching—well, very low —a
long, tight skirt one and one-fourth
yards in width, and go hobbling pain
fully but nevertheless triumphantly
down the street.
When short, full skirts came into
vogue some four or five years ago,
women breathed honest sighs of re
lief, shed the long, tight ones, and
complimented each other on the good
sense each showed. They began to
get into automobiles and street cars
easily and inconspicuously, for the
feet and limbs were comparatively
free; loose waist and bust lines al
lowed free respiration and natural de
velopment.
But now that the hated tight, long,
narrow skirted gown has again poked
its unwelcome nose into feminine
fashions, why haven't the women the
courage and common sense to ignore
it. Why do they groan, and wear it?
Why don't they rave, and "can" it?
Clothes of such a description are
not only unsightly to the asthetic eye,
but they are serious handicaps to
good health. Mrs. J. Milton said in a
talk on the subject to the Twentieth
Century Qlub, "Dresses which
women now are wearing the causing
them to become knock-kneed, knock
armed and sway-backed."
If there is any one who can, and
should set the example in the art of
dressing, it is the college woman.
Certainly she is the one who should
take the initiative, for she is well qual
ified to direct her energies in the
right, nay, sane direction.
Stanford women, why not lead the
way? MERE MAN.
