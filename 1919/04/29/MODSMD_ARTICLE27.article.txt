represented the Cardinal and was
only defeated after reaching the

Johnson and Ketcham, the University
of Southern California champions,
who took the doubles championship.
Stanford fared 110 better in the in

Davies lost to Peterson of Pomona.
In the intercollegiate doubles Graven
and Levi of California scored a win
