# Crew Coach Wants a Fast Motor Boat
## 
### 
WANTEDâ€”A super-powerful motor
boat or hydroplane to follow the Stan
ford crews at their daily workouts. For
further information see Coach Rogers.
The boats had lined up for the race,
Les Rogers and his crew,
A motor boat to keep the pace,
He thought that it would do.
Where's Les? The cry rose loud and
strong,
To find him and his mate,
The oars were raised, the race was
stopped,
For Les they had to wait.
Far, far, away down yonder stream
A speck appeared in view,
It grew and grew and nearer came,
Till Les had reached his crew.
Coach "Les" Rogers is looking for
some means of conveyance that can
keep up with his three crews. He is
finding his work coaching the men
growing more difficult daily, because
he is unable to follow the shells
around the bay. At the first of the
season he was able to watch the men,
by acting as coxswain of the second
varsity boat. But as the big regatta
is drawing near, he has been forced
to turn his seat over to one of the
regular coxswains. And now "Les"
is looking for a motor boat.
