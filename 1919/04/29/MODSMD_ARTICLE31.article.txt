stall of experts. The findings were
brought out in six volumes by the
Russel Sage Foundation. In 15)17 Mr.
Kellogg went to Europe to look into
war relief and kindred activities.
While there he organized an editorial
and historical division for the depart
ment of civilian affairs, American Red
Cross, Paris, and was one of a com
mittee of three â€”the other mem
bers being Edward T. Devine,
head of the Bureau of Refu
gees, and Earnest P. Bicknell,
commissionr for Belgium, who made
a tour of Italy from the Piave south to
the "toe," immediately following the
invasion of November, 1917, as a basis
for a constructive program of Amer
ican help for refugees in conjunction
with the Italian government plans.
Before returning to this country, Mr.
Kellogg visited England and attend
ed the Nottingham conference of the
British Labor party ,at which time its
program, "Labor and the New Social
Order," was first made public. He is
