# STUDENT COUNCIL TO TAKE OVER DATE BOOK
## 
### 
That the Student Council of the A. S.
S. U. will take over the date book, will
follow from the action taken by that
body in their regular meeting last night
All applications for dates hereafter will
have to be made to the student manager
and acted upon by the student council.
It is planned that systematic handling of
the date book will prevent any future
mixups and last minute changes such
as occurred this year in the case of the
Junior Opera. Rules governing the use
of the date book are to be drawn up.
President Lilly named a committee for
investigation and drawing up of regula
tions for the awarding of letters for
participation in collegiate athletics. The
committee is as follows: Rix Maurer,
'17. chairman; L. W. Dinkelspiel, '20,
H. C. Galloway, '20, N. H. Petree, 19,
M. F. Samis, '20.
