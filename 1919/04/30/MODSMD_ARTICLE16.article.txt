T~W] victur y the Stanford baseball team over the Blue and
B~\j_Gold on Saturday last has reawakened the question of
11 <*jfe> J what the University can do and what it actually does for its vie
torious teams. The first win in baseball since 1913 should most
certainly be celebrated with something more definite and tangible than the "S"
certificate of merit or whatever it is that is to be given the team, according to
present indications.
Ihe disappearance of the varsity "S" sweater was a war-time measure,
and as such heartily approved. But to eliminate the sweater in peace time as
an economy cannot be as heartily approved. We are told that the finances of
the student body are in bad shape because of constant demands upon the student
body and efforts that are being made to pay off a past deficit.
The financial future of athletics is brighter, however, than one might at
first glance suppose. The football season next year, despite the expenses that
are bound to occur, is almost certain to be productive of financial gain. The
athletic events of the spring and winter quarters have drawn well. The meet
Saturday, from present accounts, will probably see exceptionally well-filled
Lleahcers.
With financial conditions improving, it most certainly seems out of keeping
with the big athletic revival to fail to pay to Stanford teams the small tribute
that a student body feels it owes them.
It is no bribe, this giving of Varsity sweaters; it is not even a marked
incentive to athletics. Winning a letter is as much honor as winning a sweater.
But from a practical standpoint of standardizing in a presentable manner the
tribute of the university to the athletes that represent, the University the varsity
sweater is placed high above the "S" certificate that has been used as its substitute.
Tt is an old tradition that the exigencies of circumstances temporarily sus
pnded; these circumstances being removed, there is hardly longer any reason
why, in the light of additional expenditures, the Stanford team should not receive
what the University was formerly, only too glad to give them.
