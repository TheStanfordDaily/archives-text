## 
### 
Miss Bradford has recently received
a letter from Miss Amy L. Luce, secre
tary of the Training School of Psy
chaitric Social Work, regarding the
courses open to under-graduate students.
This training school was established
hy the authorities of Smith College and
*the Psychopathic Hospital under the
auspices of the National Committee for
Mental Hygiene. The second training
course is to be held at Northampton,
Mass., this summer.
The 1919 course is primarily to meet
the needs of the reconstruction period
and designed to deal with not only the
immediate psychaitric problems of the
aftermath of the war, but also with
those of every-day life as well. The
work will deal with not only those
problems found in an army hospital,

but with child welfare, community work,
and medical social service.
The curriculum requires basic courses
in psychology and sociology and in
cludes specialized courses in social psy
chaitry, social medicine and community
organization. The course covers two
months' academic training in theory
during July and August, 1919, at Smith
College, nine months' practical field
work, followed by two months of ad
vanced theory at Smith College during
July and August, 1920.
Inquiries about this trainiitg should
be addressed to Dr. F. Stuart Chapin,
Smith College, Northampton, Mass.
There is in the circular further in
formation about courses in social work
offered by different schools i nthe Fast.
The circular will be o nfile in Miss
Bradford's office, where further particu
lars may be obtained by those interested
in such work.
