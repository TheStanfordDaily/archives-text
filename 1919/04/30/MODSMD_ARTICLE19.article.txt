# Graceful Snake Lost by Sorority
## 
### 
Loose —On tlu campus, one snake of
the garter variety. Yesterday the rep
tile was secure in a match box at one
! ° n( -' of the sorority houses on the
j campus, today he roams tiie wilds of
| this shimmie-inhahited Farm. What he
I was doing on the Row and especially in
I a sorority house can only be conject
ured. It lias been said that grace can
be acquired through watching the ori
ental quivers «>f a snake. Perhaps—
oh well, you never can tell.
Snakes, looking for a place to sleep
eem to prefer shoes and coat sleeves.
''Hence the young Co-eds that slip around
ja certain Lasuen residence are fearfully
: clutching the most clutchabjg of their
1 garments.
If you find the snake and hate him,
return the poor brute to his match box
j and the watchful eyes of the would-be
Igracefulites. But —if you have any pity
| for the sex, let him go.
