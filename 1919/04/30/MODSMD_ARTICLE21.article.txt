# Junior Prom Plans Take Final Shape
## 
### 
As the day of the Junior Prom draws
nearer, the committee have been mak
ing final arrangements for the big dance
of the year. Tt has now been definitely
decided to hold the dance in Encina
Gym on May 10. Dancing will begin
promptly at 8:30 and there will be no in
itermission. The feed will follow the
I dance, instead of coming in an intermis
sion as first planned. This will enable
the dancing to close before intruding on
! Sunday.
It now appears very likely that Sat-
I urday, May 10, will be a holiday, and
plans are now being drafted in an ef
fort to get every member of the Junior
'class down at Encina Gym to help with
the decorations, which will be the most
elaborate yet attempted.
Programs will be obtainable upon pre
sentation of the admission tickets at the
bookstore, the first of the week. They
are now on the way from the East, and
are of dark blue leather with silver de
signing. The sheets are also of white
leather, making a program of all leather
construction.
