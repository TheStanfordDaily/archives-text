# Liberty Loan Drive Inaugurated
## 
### 
Students may be patriotic and keep
their memorial pledge at the same time.
The campus Liberty Loan Committee
has decided that Liberty Bonds will be
accepted as payment for the Memorial
Fund pledges. Circular letters will be
sent out to all of the students, setting
forth the plans and making a special

appeal to those who can afford to buy
the bonds.
The results from the campus have
thus far been very small since the en
tire camp has not been reached. The
committee is composed of Dr. Gardner,
J. F.. McDowell. Margaret Shedd, '20,
and Joe Murphy, '20.
