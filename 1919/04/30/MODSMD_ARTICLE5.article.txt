# Nestoria Tryouts to Take Place Tonight
## 
### 
Nestoria's forensic aspirants will
try out in Room 12 tonight for a so
ciety team to meet the Euphronia
Club trio on May 14. Main speeches
of three minutes and short rebuttals
will be made by the contestants.
President W. C. Fundenburg urges
that all Nestorians be prepared to
speak this evening, and he points to
the strong team already selected by
Euphronia as the reason. The try
outs tonight will be arranged in the
form of a regular socety program, and
competent neutral judges will be se
cured to choose the best speakers.
The question for argument is, "Re
solved. that immigration to the
United States should be restricted for
a period of four years," which is also
the subject for the intersociety clash.
