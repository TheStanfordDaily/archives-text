# Kellogg Discusses Labor in England
## Tells How English Labor Is Backing the American President 
### 
Paul Kellogg, of the Survey Maga
zine, at the Little TheateV last night gave
his hearers a new grasp on the labor
situation in England and other Europe
an countries. The speaker explained
that his talk last night took up Eng
lish labor from a little different phase
than any of his previous lectures in
California.
"There has come forward in England
a new labor force, that promises to be
one of the most formidable movements
of the world," said Mr. Kellogg. "This
movement comes as a result of labor
manifesting an increasing desire to have
its say, and it means that England will
have a tu-w social unity, a new blend
ing of tilings. The entire labor ele
ment of England is engaging in this
political movement," continued the
| speaker. "The labor party is making
| their appeal to the people of England."
The lecturer went on to explain that
j about a year ago the English labor
party threw open its ranks to workers
of brain as well as workers by hand.
Together the) brought about the com
j pletc reform of the educational system,
'the overhauling of the entire health
I scheme and gave to England a new
scheme of nationalization. They united
on a plan for the government control
of many thnigs, as mines, railways,
shipping and power plants. During the
war the government took these over,
j and English labor proposes to continue
this government operation of industries.
They say if such things were good to
defend tlu country from outside
enemies, surely they are worth keeping
lin peace time.
"This period marks the beginning of
the assertion of the common man in
government," said Mr. Kellogg. In ex
plaining how English labor had since
the beginning of war been entirely in
step with President Wilson, the speaker
said, "British and Allied labor have been
in step with President Wilson from the
first. They approved his fourteen
points, they have understood time and
| again when Americans have not, just
I what the President was driving at. Re
: peatedly they have approved Wilson's
! policy and backed and supported his
{position.
"British and Allied labor believes that
the whole scheme of things must be I
changed and that the world must be
of armaments and wars, which have
I cost so dearly in life and happiness,
ij Further they want and are going to
j have a part in this program of events."
i said Mr. Kellogg.
