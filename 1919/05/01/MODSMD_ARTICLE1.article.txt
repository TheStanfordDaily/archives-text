# STANFORD EIGHTS LEAVE TODAY FOR OAKLAND ESTUARY
## CONFIDENT OF VICTORY Crew Men Are in Prime Condition for the Big Race Saturday 
### 
STANFORD'S two crews, that are
to be entered in the regatta with
the Universities of Washington and
California, left this morning for Ber
keley. Coach Rogers is taking his men
u]) early, in order that they may have
several workouts on the Oakland estu
ary, before the gun is fired, at 9:55
o'clock, Saturday morning, for the Var
sity clash.
The oarsmen left the campus filled
with lots of lire and enthusiasm, and
looking forward to nothing short of
victory. When Captain Watts was
shown the weights and experience of
the California and Washington shells,
he said that we were already winners.
Both the opposing crews are lighter
than the Cardinal eights, and with men
with the fighting spirit such as Captain
Watts, King, Adams, McGillivray, Davis,
Williamson, Cary and Wilbur, what can
be expected but a winning Stanford
Varsity boat?
The shift in the Varsity boat, caused
by the disability of Moore, stopped all
hopes of a second Varsity race with
California. Washington is not entering
a second Varsity crew, cither, so the
U. C. second string men will be without
a race. The change in the line-up of
the Cardinal boat was not for the
worst, because Cary lit right into the
smooth workings of the eight, at their
practise at Redwood yesterday after
noon.
The freshman eight ought to walk
away with honors, at the big race, Sat
urday, because it is one of the strongest
crews Stanford has ever made up of
its first year men. "Husky" Guerena
is highly pleased with the freshman
shell, as well as the Varsity.
