# MATMEN TO MEET BRUINS TOMORROW
## TEAMS EVENLY MATCHED Odds Favor Cardinal Light-weights Bunds Leads Heavy Wrestlers 
### 
WRESTLERS of Stanford and Cali
fornia will meet in intercollegiate
competition tomorrow night, at the En
eina Gym. According to information
obtained, both teams arc about evenly
matched in the weight classes, although
the Cardinal lias the favor of the odds
in the light weight divisions. The de

is in splendid condition for the match
and is expected by wrestling fans to
pull down honors for the evening.
Egami in the 125-pound class is, with
out exception, the speediest man that
Stanford has ever had on her wrestling
squad. Egami has had two years' ex
perience against California, and has
never lost a bout. He has helped to
train the newer men to a great extent,
