# STANFORD-CALIFORNIA NET FRACAS SATURDAY
## Freshman Racket Artists to Meet California Tomorrow 
### 
Stanford's Varsity tennis team will
cross rackets with the California tennis
men on the Blue and Gold courts at
10 a.m. Saturday morning. The Varsity
goes up against a real team when it
meets the Bruins. Every man on the
California team lias won some sort of
a championship or other this year, ac
cording to the"Daily Californian."
Graven and Levy, numbers 1 and 2,
respectively, on the Bear team, are the
men who won the finals from Barber
and Davis at Santa Barbara last week.
Barber will in all probability hold the
position of number 1 on the Cardinal
squad. He will have a hard time beat
ing Graven, but can be depended upon
to put up a good fight. Captain Dev
lin and Barbel" will be the first team in
the doubles.
Tomorrow afternoon the Cardinal
freshmen will meet the California cubs
on the Encina courts. Unless things
go against the dope sheet, the Stan
ford men ought to carry away the tour
nament by a large margin. One of the
best freshmen teams that has been seen
i n Encina courts for several years will
lie seen in action, according to Varsity
Captain Devlin.
Dnvics, the captain of the freshmen,
is one of the best racket men on the
coast. For the last two years he has
gotten as far as the finals in the inter
coast tournaments, and has only been
beaten by the superior experience of his
opponents.
ITawkes, Neer, Tussing, and Conrad
will make up the rest of the team.
Ilawkes brings a big reputation from
the south with him and has shown in
the inter-club series that he deserves the

reputation. Xeer has a good service and
covers a lot of ground. Tussing, by his
fast playing during the last week, beat
Conrad out for number 4. Conrad is
putting up a good game.
