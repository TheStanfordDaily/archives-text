# STANFORD SPIRIT FOUND
## 
### 
t ' lc lrack aiu ' crew rally over last evening, somebody
\fk T JR>t&3fc| remarked that the Stanford spirit had returned. Let
us hope that this optimist is correct and let us' rejoice in the
rejuvenation. Stanford men and women have been fighting for
the return of Stanford spirit and hoping against hope.that it would eventually
come. Last evening saw the sudden, if somewhat unexpected, awakening to tin
realization of what is required of Stanford men.
The impromptu nature of last evening's rally with the pilgrimage to the
track and the crew houses was reminiscent of those days which we are prone
to call "the good old days." There can be no doubt after last evening's demon
ftratfoh that the best means of getting spirit is to create it at" impromptu ami
informal get-togethers". It is visible proof that speech-making and editorial
writing are but means to an end that can only be reached when all participate
actively in work that brings Stanford spirit. Those who read of last even
ing's rally and who did not attend cannot learn of Stanford spirit as can those
who attended and found it right in the heart of the crowd.
Stanford spirit has returned; from the ball game Saturday, the light at
the lake Wednesday, the rally last evening and the anticipation of the contests
over the week-end, Stanford students have learned of the new Stanford spirit
that is being created.
This spirit will have its big test on Saturday. The crew will need the ef
forts of the rooters Saturday morning and the track team will need their voices
in the afternoon. We have found our Stanford spirit; let us show it to Cali
fornia from the rooters' train and the track bleachers on Saturday.
