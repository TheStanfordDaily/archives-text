# Colonel McCaskey Inspects R.O.T.C.
## Result of Today's Inspection Determines Rating of the Unit 
### 
Colonel McCaskey this morning in
spected the Stanford R. O. T. C. Upon
the result of this inspection depends
the rating of the local corps. Hereto
fore Stanford has been in the distin
guished class, but the number of men
has decreased a great deal since then.
Colonel McCaskey expressed himself
very well pleased with the results of
this morning's inspection, and Captain
Parker hopes that the unit will again
be placed in the distinguished class.
The inspection this morning included
the company in attack, bayonet, and
physical training, preceded by a com
pany inspection of arms and equipment
and close order drill. The entire in-*
spection took place on the Faculty Club
gotmds.
No definite statement can be made
by Colonel McCaskey as to the stand
ing of the unit until his report has gone
through military channels at Washing
ton. Until that time there is .no way
of knowing just how successful the unit
was in maintaining its old rating.
Having completed his visit to Stan
ford this morning, Colonel McCaskey
left this afternoon to inspect other units
in the state.
