# Track and Crew Given Send-Off
## 
### 
The Cardinal track and crew men
were given a big send-off last night,
when nearly every man on the campus
joined in the most enthusiastic rally
ever given to the Stanford spring
sports. Parading from Encina, the
rally started on the lawn of the Alpha
Delta Phi House, which is the training
quarters of the tracksters. Later the
rooters paraded to the Theta Xi house,
and gave the crew men their send off.
The feature of the jazz rally in front
of thp track training table house, was
the talk given by Dr. I'"rank Angcll,
member of the Athletic Board of Con
trol. Dr. Angell said that he enjoyed
the open air rallies because one could
"call a spade a spade, or a d shovel
if he so choose." He sarcastically told
of the freshman track meet, but urged
the students not to let the results of
that fata! day worry them, "as we will
beat up the freshmen enough so that
they will be good varsity men before
they are out of Stanford." That's what
the expression. 'Stanford Farm' means,"
declared Dr. Angell. 'We raise athletes
down here as well as students, and gen
erally both at the same time."
Captain Galloway, of the victorious
1919 Varsity nine, was given such cheer,
that he was only able to say a few
words. Captain Teitsworth and Pro
fessor Angell, both brought out the
possibility of the Cardinal taking every
honor, next Saturday, if the student

body gives its undivided support.
Coach, "Les" Rogers and Captain
Frank Watts pointed out a Stanford
crew victory for both the Varsity and
freshman shells on the morning of
May .1 They thought that the race

would be between the Cardinal and
Washington Varsity eights, with Cali
fornia lighting for third place.
Yell-leader "Monk" Antrim, who was
in charge of the rally last night, spoke
on American spring practice, in the ab
sence of Coach Evans. Every one
planning on going out for football is
urged 'o start spring training next Mon
day afternoon.
