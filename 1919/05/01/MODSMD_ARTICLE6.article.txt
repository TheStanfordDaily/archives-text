## DOPE SHEET IS POPULAR Fans Believe That Relay May Be the Deciding Event of the Meet 
### 
WITH the big intercollegiate track
struggle only two days away every
other person noticed on the quad this
morning was carrying a dope sheet and
pencil. Every one has his opinions about
the probable outcome of the meet, but
the more it is doped the more conflicting
the dope becomes.
Dopster's figures can never be relied
upon to decide a meet, hut if dope has
anything to do with it, the big contest
Saturday afternoon will he one of the
hardest fought meets that has been seen
between the two universities since the
famous struggle in 1915 when Stanford
won by one-half a point.
California fans made their usual pre
season appearance on the campus last
night with a blue sheet and check hook
and seem as confident of taking away
tlie bacon Saturday afternoon as they
had been tw oweeks ago taking the
baseball pennant.
A comparison of the dope sheets
shows that the mile run, quarter mile,
half mile and relay are the most doubt
ful events, and the result of the meet
rests in a large part on the outcome of
these event:.
California fans are willing to place
their money on three places in the broad
jump and arc confident that Sprott will
he able to take the mile in spite of the
comparative times which show that
Teitsworth has run that event in a little
more than six seconds faster than the
Californai miler. Walter Christie is re
lying 011 Geoppart to take first in both
the quarter-mile and 880-yard run.
That the relay will decide the meet is
the prevailing opinion among a large
number of fans 011 both sides of the bay.
If this is the case, the Cardinal team
should have a bi.tr chance of bring home
a victory with four men like Dinkel
spiel, Maynard, Wright, "and Scofield.
