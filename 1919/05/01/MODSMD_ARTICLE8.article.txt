# BOXES PLACED FOR BLIND RELIEF FUND
## 
### 
Allied blind relief boxes have been
putin all the living groups on the
campus as a result of the meeting of
the Women's Social Board last night
in the clubhouse. According to pres
ent plans, the campaign will be car
ried on for a week and each man and
woman on the campus will be asked
to contribute a nickel to the fund.
The money raised in the present
drive will be used to teach soldiers
who have been blinded in the war

the present time is only sufficient for
needed medical attention. The boxes
will be collected some time during
the first part of next week.
