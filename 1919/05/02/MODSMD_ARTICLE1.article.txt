## STANFORD CREWS WILL ENTER ANNUAL REGA TTA CONFIDENT OF VICTORY 
### 
TOMORROW morning at 9:55 o'clock. Coach Rogers' men will line up against
the Washington and California eights, awaiting the report of the pistol,
which will mark the start of the three-mile grind. The freshman crews of the
three Universities, will have a two-mile nice immediately following the Varsity
contest. The second Varsity race has been called off.
The Cardinal Varsity will enter the regatta with the following line-up: King,
stroke; Watts, seven; Adams, eight; McGillivray, five; Davis, four; Williamson,
three; Cary, two; Wilbur, how; Montgomery, cox; Wooster, Vietor, and Patrick
substitutes.
The first-year oarsmen arc: Olmstead, stroke; Hancock, seven; McKinnon,

six; Snow, five; Brieson, four; Adams,
three; Sayre, two; Maloney, bow;
Boucher, cox; Dunbar and Briggs, sub
stitutes.
Rogers' Men Are Strong
The Red and White paddlers have had
such intensive training, during the past
two months, under the coaching of "Les"
Rogers, that they arc in the prime of
condition for tomorrow's nerve-racking
test. During the past few weeks, the
two Stanford crews have been rowing
as smoothly as clock work. Every man
seems fit to his seat. There is not a
single hitch in the working of either
eight.
C oach Rogers is putting his men into
the race with perfect confidence of not
only a complete victory over California
boats, but also over both of the Wash
ington shells.
Stanford Has Advantage
According to the dope on the men
from the three Universities, Stanford
has the edge of everything. The two
Stanford crews are heavier than either
of their opponents, which means that the
men from the "farm" not only surpass
in grit and the fighting spirit, but also
in actual beef. But the opposing shells
are not to be sneered at, because their
light men might be nothing but muscle
and bones, with plenty of endurance.
Washington and California crews have
only one old varsity man on their 1919
boat. Tilden is again rowing number
six for California, but doesn't seem to
have the old-time lire. Kronfield is the
hope of the Washington aggregation, and
very little is known about him or any of
the rest of the eight. As usual, their
prospects and dope reports have been
kept in the dark.
Stanford is able to produce two old
varsity men. Captain W'atts and Roy
King, who rowed on the 1917 varsity
eight and during their freshman year.
Watts sits at oar number seven and King
at stroke, With these old men setting
the pace called for by "Jimmy" Mont
gomery, the coxswain, victory looms up
in sight.
"Husky" Guerena claims that this pair
working together, could make any crew

pull to victory, or the next thing, to kill
themselves in the attempt. Watts has
been working unusually hard the entire
season, on account of the handicaps
that have been laid down in the road of
a 1919 success.
Men Are All Fighters
"Do or Die," is the motto of the
Cardinal eights. They seem to have an


Captain Frank Watts, whose two years
of crew experience at Stanford is
greatly responsible for the smooth
running of the 1919 varsity shell.
