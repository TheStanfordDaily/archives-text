PTFVESIFt starter s yun tomorrow morning will send the Stanford,
[/'California, and Washington crews off the starting line
(jjL, ~ together, and the annual regatta will be declared as begun. The
first water carnival since the war ought to be productive of closc
2nd stirring finishes, with the Cardinal boats, it is hoped, well out in front. The
crew always deserves unlimited applause for its conscientious and faithful train
ing, the rigorous discipline and strenuous work that it must undergo. The crew
this year deserves more than unlimited applause. It may be termed a volunteer
crew, made possible by subscriptions of funds from the student body and coached
by a member of the student body itself. No amount of praise is too much for
the way that Les Rogers and Frank Watts first made the crew itself possible
and then made a victory within the realms of possibility. The varsiy crew is
light but a fighting Stanford boat, and that means an awful lot. The freshman
eight is even lighter but is declared to be topnotch in form, fight and gameness.
Let's go, crew, for a double win on the water!
