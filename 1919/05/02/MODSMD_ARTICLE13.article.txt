# LET'S GO, ROOTERS!
## 
### 
complete a season without the usual appeal to the rooters is to
, neglect ancient tradition. Stanford rooters have two varsities that
A they can regard as worth while rooting for. They have an old rival that
is worth while rooting against, and they have facilities for transportation to
the city and across the bay that makes rooting easy.
It is an old story of the importance of the crowd's cheering in that last
quarter of the crew race, and it is an equally old tale of how the miler gamely
sticks out his race because of some exceptional support from the stands. It is
an old tale, but being old does not make it a myth. The university authorities
have cooperated in making Saturday a holiday. Let's pay them back by making
use of the day.
Let's go, rooters!
