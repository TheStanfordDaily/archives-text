"The Stanford crews have an unlim
ited amount of power this year," said
Rix Maurer, former varsity crew cap
tain. "When the varsity starts a
sprint the boat actually leaps out of
the water. When the shell is going
along at top speed, it hardly touches
the surface, but seems to fly through
the air."
