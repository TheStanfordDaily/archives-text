For the first time in six years Stan
ford has won a baseball series from
the University of California and it
only took two games to do it. Dur
ing the last six years the California
team has been making trips to the
Orient and through the northwest be
cause they had the best club and they
were entitled to the honors. Since
the Stanford varsity defeated the
Bears so decisively this year, the Car
dinal team should be given a trip,
either through Washington and Ore
gon or to Honolulu. A Cardinal base
ball team has not journeyed farther
than Berkeley for six years, and it is
no more than right that a team which
is good enough to beat the California
aggregation should be given the trip
that the California student manager
had outlined for his club, provided the
Blue and Gold won the series.
The varsity that Coach Bob Evans
gathered together this year is an ag
gregation that is worthy to represent
Stanford in foreign fields. Although
going poorly in the early part of the
season, they hit their stride a few
weeks before the California series
and worked like a real ball cllub.
An infield combination like Teubner,
i Kallam, Galloway, and Stevens will
stack up against any college organi
zation. Stevens is a veteran at the
game and his work at third base has
caused a good deal of favorable com
ment from visiting teams. Galloway
at shortstop is, next to Zeb Terry, the
best shortstop that Stanford has seen.
With Kallam on second, one of the
best all-arouond ball players on the
team, the keystone combination lacks
nothing. Teubner at first is an ideal
first baseman and he will easily show
up the majority of college first-sack
ers.
In the outfield, Lilly, Pike and Kline
have worked in top-notch form. Lilly
will outfield and outhit any outfielder
in the Pacific Coast Conference, and
Pike and Kline are almost as good,
Behind the bat, Bundy showed his
ability to the satisfaction of the fans
in the California series and he is able
to take care of his job without any
help.
In the pitching department, Evans
! has developed Newland and Pelouze
i both of whom won their games
against California, which is enough
These men should experience nc
trouble with opposing clubs. Fowler
who is a transfer from Santa Clara
would be eligible for a trip and he
would be a source of strength to the
staff.
For a trip through the northwest
games could be scheduled with the
University of Washington, Washing
ton State University, University ol
Oregon, Oregon Aggies and the Mult
nomah Athletic Club. The receipts
from these contests would allmost pay
the expenses for the trip and Stanford
alumni in Oregon and Washington
would be more than willing to help
Part of the proceeds from the track
meet could also be used. The Hono
lulu trip was made in 1!>13 and was
completed successfully. Alumni in
the Hawaiian Islands backed the team
Stanford has a winning varsity and
now is the time for the country to
know it. N. H. P., '19.
