Ttissing will constitute the team that

ments did not show much form.
Davies is Babes' Mainstay

open singles.
flawkes is second man on the team
and has shown lots of form within the

team over Conrad. ITe plays a hard
game.

the inter-collegiate singles and in the
open singles.
flawkes is second man on the team
and has shown lots of form within the
last few weeks. His playing is steady
and lie can be depended on to give
his opponent a hard fight. Neer, num
ber three, has a good backhand drive
and a cut that is a fooler. The playing
of Ttissing won him his place on the
team over Conrad. ITe plays a hard
game.
The varsity series will be played on
tlic California courts at 10 a.m. Satur
day morning, and the freshmen will hold
their tournament on the Encina courts
at ,3:30 p.m. this afternoon. No admis
sion is to be charged.
AS a preliminary to the Varsity
tournament on Saturday morning,
the freshmen racketters will mix with
the California cubs on the Enema courts
at 3:00 this afternoon. On Saturday
morning Captain Devlin will take his
team up against the California Varsity
on the Blue and Gold courts.
The Varsity will he hard pressed to
take tlie tournament from California.
The Bruin team is far above the aver
age of the tennis squad that usually rep
resents the trans-bay institution, while
the Cardinal squad is a hard lighting
organization, but only average players.
Barber is Varsity Star
The only star on the Varsity team
this year is Allyn Barber, '18. His play
ing lias been an exhibition such as was
seen on the Encina courts in the "old
days". He has a service that is very
hand to return and is able to cover any
portion of the court. His work in the
South e r n California Championship
Tournament at Santa Barbara last
week showed that he is in fine form
now. The position of first man should
go to him in the California series.
Captain Devlin, Bent, Turner, Kinney,
and Fish will make up the team that
represents Stanford on Saturday. Dev
lin is rounding into form and has shown
more stuff in the last few days than
lie lias any time before this season.
Bent is one of last year's Varsity men
and can be depended upon to play a
steady game. His stellar work in the
tournament, that was played the first of
the month, makes him sure of a place
on the team. Turner, Kinney, and
Fish are playing good games.
Babes Look Like Winners
The freshman tennis'team will try to
do something to make the athletic
record of the class of 1922 look a little
better. If the dope does not go wrong,
the "babes" ought to walk away from
the California cubs by a score of at least
.3-2. The Cardinal team is a fast play
ing aggregation with several stars.
Captain Davies, Hawkgs, Neer, and
Ttissing will constitute the team that
will go up against the Bruins. Conrad
will be held in reserve in case of an
accident. California's freshmen do not
have any stars to boast of, and those
that played in the inter-club tourna
ments did not show much form.
Davies is Babes' Mainstay
Davies, captain of the 1922 men, is
the best player on the babes' team, and
is perhaps the best racketman in the
university. In the tournament at Santa
Barbara he got into the finals in both
the inter-collegiate singles and in the
open singles.
