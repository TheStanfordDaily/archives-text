# Women's Club House Benefit Dance Tonight
## 
### 
After the performance of "Magic
Waters" tonight at the Assembly Hall,
a benefit dance for the Women's Club
House, will be held, at the Club House.
It will be a 1 o'clock affair, and there
will be plenty of jazz furnished by \m
brose Whitmer. '21. and the campus
orchestra.
The Club House is about $7000 in
debt, and it is feared drastic measures
will have to be taken if it cannot be
met soon. A large crowd at the dance
tonight will materially aid in paying
some of the amount. The admission
will be $1.10 a couple.
