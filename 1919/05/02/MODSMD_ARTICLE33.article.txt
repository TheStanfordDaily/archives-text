## DAILY PALO ALTO WHY NO BIG GAME WITH CALIFORNIA FOR THIS FALL? 
### M.F. Samis, '20 
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, CALIFORNIA, FRIDAY, MAY 2, 1919

WHY has no game of American
football been scheduled with the
University of California for this fall?
This is a question which has not yet
been satisfactorily answered, at least
in the opinion of a good portion of the
student body. Demands are beginning
to be heard for an explanation. Of
course, their opinion may not carry any
weight with the Board of Athletic Con
trol; at least, it will not unless they
voice their sentiments, and this article
is an appeal for an expression of
opinion on the part of those who favor
a "big game", with California this year.
As the situation now stands, Stan
ford is in receipt of a communication
from California, proposing a game for
this fall, and suggesting November 15
as the date. Although this letter has
been in our hands for several weeks,
we have made no reply. The reason,
as stated by our student representatives
on the Board of Control, is that our
feelings have been injured because of a
previous letter received from California,
and that in view of this "slap in the
face," we cannot properly have any
dealings with California in football
matters.
Refusal to Negotiate
Now, are we going to stand for this
kind of nonsense? Isn't it about time
that Stanford and California forgot
their petty bickerings, and got down to
business ?
There are a lot of men on this
campus who think it is, and they are
not satisfied with tlie reason given for
our failure to reply to California's pro
posal for a big game. Our representa
tives are undoubtedly well intentioned,
but they are pursuing the same short
sighted policy which has been the root
of a good deal of the trouble in the
past. There is no material difference
between the student bodies of Stanford
and California. They are both com
posed of the same kind of men, of the
same age and coming from the same
communities. Why, then, should we
have so much trouble in agreeing over
athletic questions ?
Remains Unexplained
One reason is a lack of business
like methods in dealing with each other.
A good example was furnished in the
unfortunate dispute over the umpire in
last Saturday's game at California.
Stanford's team was probably right in
refusing to play with the umpire sug
gested by California. But the ball field
is no place to stage a wrangle over the
umpire. That should have been .settled
by the managers long before the game.
As a result of this most unfortunate
misunderstanding, we are held up on the
California campus as poor sportsmen,
and the incident has served to create
a good deal of ill-feeling between the
two universities.
Now, one of the reasons given for
not replying to California's proposal for
a game, is that we should not "crawl"
to our rival. This argument is more
or less an appeal to our pride which
has already suffered a bad shock since
we crawled down off our vaunted Rugby
perch. If we have to crawl, we can
afford to crawl just a little farther.
"Swede" Pettingill was right when he
characteristically remarked: "If we
have to crawl, let's crawl, and then beat
the hell out of them."

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, CALIFORNIA, FRIDAY, MAY 2, 1919

WHY has no game of American
football been scheduled with the
University of California for this fall?
This is a question which has not yet
been satisfactorily answered, at least
in the opinion of a good portion of the
student body. Demands are beginning
to be heard for an explanation. Of
course, their opinion may not carry any
weight with the Board of Athletic Con
trol; at least, it will not unless they
voice their sentiments, and this article
is an appeal for an expression of
opinion on the part of those who favor
a "big game", with California this year.
As the situation now stands, Stan
ford is in receipt of a communication
from California, proposing a game for
this fall, and suggesting November 15
as the date. Although this letter has
been in our hands for several weeks,
we have made no reply. The reason,
as stated by our student representatives
on the Board of Control, is that our
feelings have been injured because of a
previous letter received from California,
and that in view of this "slap in the
face," we cannot properly have any
dealings with California in football
matters.
Refusal to Negotiate
Now, are we going to stand for this
kind of nonsense? Isn't it about time
that Stanford and California forgot
their petty bickerings, and got down to
business ?
There are a lot of men on this
campus who think it is, and they are
not satisfied with tlie reason given for
our failure to reply to California's pro
posal for a big game. Our representa
tives are undoubtedly well intentioned,
but they are pursuing the same short
sighted policy which has been the root
of a good deal of the trouble in the
past. There is no material difference
between the student bodies of Stanford
and California. They are both com
posed of the same kind of men, of the
same age and coming from the same
communities. Why, then, should we
have so much trouble in agreeing over
athletic questions ?
Remains Unexplained
One reason is a lack of business
like methods in dealing with each other.
A good example was furnished in the
unfortunate dispute over the umpire in
last Saturday's game at California.
Stanford's team was probably right in
refusing to play with the umpire sug
gested by California. But the ball field
is no place to stage a wrangle over the
umpire. That should have been .settled
by the managers long before the game.
As a result of this most unfortunate
misunderstanding, we are held up on the
California campus as poor sportsmen,
and the incident has served to create
a good deal of ill-feeling between the
two universities.
Now, one of the reasons given for
not replying to California's proposal for
a game, is that we should not "crawl"
to our rival. This argument is more
or less an appeal to our pride which
has already suffered a bad shock since
we crawled down off our vaunted Rugby
perch. If we have to crawl, we can
afford to crawl just a little farther.
