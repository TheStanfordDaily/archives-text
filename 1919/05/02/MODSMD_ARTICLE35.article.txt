# CARDINAL ATHLETES READY FOR TOMORROW
## 
### Neil H. Petree, '19 
WITH the 1919 baseball series already sewed up in a Cardinal bat bag and reposing safely somewhere on the
Stanford farm, followers of the intercollegiate sports will journey to Berkeley tomorrow brimming over with
confidence, and not the kind that is classed as overconfidenee. The Stanford varsity and freshman crews are all
set for the grind, and the track team is neither stale from over-training nor weak from a lack of condition. The
men who will wear the Cardinal uppers tomorrow in the big events are in perfect shape to give their best for
Stanford. Keen observers of the opposing crews and rival track teams' performances this year express the opinion
that the Cardinal's best will be just a little better than what the Blue and Gold will have to offer.
BASEBALL WIN WAKED DEAD ONES
Stanford has been beaten with regularity this year in freshman sports, and to quite an extent in varsity
competition in the minor sports. The baseball win, the first in six years, was a big comeback, and stirred the
smoldering Stanford spirit as nothing else could have done. Victory in the annual crew regatta and in the track
meet will more than give the Cardinal the edge on the 1919 athletic performances. After all is said, baseball, track,
and crew are the mainstays of spring athletic competition. To win all of these in one year is something that Cal
ifornia has never done, and Stanford but once, in 1913.
Captain Watts and Coach Rogers have worked ceaselessly all season to turn out just what we have now, three
boats which will make every Stanford man proud to "say that he gets his education in the vicinity of Palo Alto.
They may not win the regatta, but they will be up there at the finish, and it is my opinion that the only thing

that can keep them behind the Blue and Gold oarsmen is heart failure or a hole in the boat. The doctor says that
all the hearts are beating to a regular tune, and the boater guarantees no holes in the shells and no broken oars;
so those of speculative tendencies are advised that opportunity knocks but seldom, and a good investment is in
sight.
DOPING MEET FAVORITE SPORT
Doping a track meet is a pastime engaged in by every follower of the sport, some to a fair degree of accu
racy, and many to a perfection that guarantees to be correct thirty points either way. Doping the coming meet
is practically an impossibility, because no one has been able to tell just what the opposing cinder-path men can
really do. True to past form, Coach Christie of the Berkeley aggregation, has kept some of his best performers
