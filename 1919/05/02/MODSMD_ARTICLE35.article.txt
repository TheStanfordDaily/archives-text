# CARDINAL ATHLETES READY FOR TOMORROW
## 
### Neil H. Petree, '19 
WITH the 1919 baseball series already sewed up in a Cardinal bat bag and reposing safely somewhere on the
Stanford farm, followers of the intercollegiate sports will journey to Berkeley tomorrow brimming over with
confidence, and not the kind that is classed as overconfidenee. The Stanford varsity and freshman crews are all
set for the grind, and the track team is neither stale from over-training nor weak from a lack of condition. The
men who will wear the Cardinal uppers tomorrow in the big events are in perfect shape to give their best for
Stanford. Keen observers of the opposing crews and rival track teams' performances this year express the opinion
that the Cardinal's best will be just a little better than what the Blue and Gold will have to offer.
BASEBALL WIN WAKED DEAD ONES
Stanford has been beaten with regularity this year in freshman sports, and to quite an extent in varsity
competition in the minor sports. The baseball win, the first in six years, was a big comeback, and stirred the
smoldering Stanford spirit as nothing else could have done. Victory in the annual crew regatta and in the track
meet will more than give the Cardinal the edge on the 1919 athletic performances. After all is said, baseball, track,
and crew are the mainstays of spring athletic competition. To win all of these in one year is something that Cal
ifornia has never done, and Stanford but once, in 1913.
Captain Watts and Coach Rogers have worked ceaselessly all season to turn out just what we have now, three
boats which will make every Stanford man proud to "say that he gets his education in the vicinity of Palo Alto.
They may not win the regatta, but they will be up there at the finish, and it is my opinion that the only thing

that can keep them behind the Blue and Gold oarsmen is heart failure or a hole in the boat. The doctor says that
all the hearts are beating to a regular tune, and the boater guarantees no holes in the shells and no broken oars;
so those of speculative tendencies are advised that opportunity knocks but seldom, and a good investment is in
sight.
DOPING MEET FAVORITE SPORT
Doping a track meet is a pastime engaged in by every follower of the sport, some to a fair degree of accu
racy, and many to a perfection that guarantees to be correct thirty points either way. Doping the coming meet
is practically an impossibility, because no one has been able to tell just what the opposing cinder-path men can
really do. True to past form, Coach Christie of the Berkeley aggregation, has kept some of his best performers

in the dark. His sprinters have' been
woefully weak all season, but the
latest from the enemy's camp is that
Johnson can tear up the cinders with
the best of them when he is in good
form, and is slated to be in just that
trim Saturday. Stanford is not wor
rying, however, for Lilly, Wells, Sco
field, and Maynard will probably be
able to take care of themselves.
Stanford has several dark horses
herself. Templeton is always at his
best in intercollegiate competition,
and may surprise in the jumps. The
Blue and Gold fignin
tne .Jioaa, but Templeton lias hopped
a considerable distance himself in the
past, and with the score close, may

leap into most any one of the three
point-winning places. Green undoubt
edly will be the Cardinal mainstay.
He will win the pole vault, probably
the discus, and will place in the
jumps.
SPROTT NO CERTAIN
WINNER IN DISTANCES
Sprott seems to be the boy that U.
C. money likes to talk about. He is.
without doubt a fast, runner, and it
he runs the half, may take a first
place, but woe be unto Mr. Sprott if
he is figuring on taking the mile.
Teitsworth and Westwick will lead
him a merry chase, and after their
work last Saturday, are confident of
crossing the tape in at least number
one and number three places. Stan
ford «quarter-milers look to have the
relay cinched. Goeppart will probably
see Cardinal jerseys all around him
when he makes the one round go that
all IJlue and Gold followers seem con

fident he will run away with. The
440 is no cinch Berkeley event with
Dinkelspiel, Scofleld, Wright, and
Hurtle running.
A complete resume of each event is
but a rehash of front page dope, and
track chatter, which nearly every fol
lower knows. But one can say in gen
eral that ihe annual track classic to
morrow will not be won until the last
events are run off, and that the sea
son's work of both teams furnishes
poor material for the usual doping
of just who will beat, whom in the
Stanford looks on paper to have a
consi(ler»hip s»ri as thp
California students said after the base
ball series, "One never knows." Coach
Evans and "Feg" Murray have labored

with the Cardinal hopes until the men
are as good as they can be. There is
no doubt but that every Stanford man
and woman will be on the job doing
their share in the bleachers. The Uni
versity is behind the team, and if
boosting from the sidelines counts,
the meet will not go to our rivals be
thlrd event in the day's program,
cause of a lack of support.
TEAMS HAVE
OVERCOME HANDICAPS
Despite freshman failures, and a
tightening of the reins by the faculty
until athletes can hardly be athletes
and students at. the same time, thus
limiting the competition, the Stanford
crews and track team will come
through. They are ready to give their
all for the Cardinal, and we are confi
dent that their all is enough to give
their supporters plenty to celebrate
over tomorrow night.

without doubt a fast, runner, and it
he runs the half, may take a first

he is figuring on taking the mile.
Teitsworth and Westwick will lead
him a merry chase, and after their
work last Saturday, are confident of
crossing the tape in at least number
one and number three places. Stan

TEAMS HAVE
OVERCOME HANDICAPS
Despite freshman failures, and a
tightening of the reins by the faculty
until athletes can hardly be athletes
and students at. the same time, thus
limiting the competition, the Stanford
crews and track team will come
through. They are ready to give their
all for the Cardinal, and we are confi
dent that their all is enough to give
their supporters plenty to celebrate
over tomorrow night.


Varsity, Freshman and Second Varsity Crews work out at Redwood.
WITH the 1919 baseball series already sewed up in a Cardinal bat bag and reposing safely somewhere on the
Stanford farm, followers of the intercollegiate sports will journey to Berkeley tomorrow brimming over with
confidence, and not the kind that is classed as overconfidenee. The Stanford varsity and freshman crews are all
set for the grind, and the track team is neither stale from over-training nor weak from a lack of condition. The
men who will wear the Cardinal uppers tomorrow in the big events are in perfect shape to give their best for
Stanford. Keen observers of the opposing crews and rival track teams' performances this year express the opinion
that the Cardinal's best will be just a little better than what the Blue and Gold will have to offer.
BASEBALL WIN WAKED DEAD ONES
Stanford has been beaten with regularity this year in freshman sports, and to quite an extent in varsity
competition in the minor sports. The baseball win, the first in six years, was a big comeback, and stirred the
smoldering Stanford spirit as nothing else could have done. Victory in the annual crew regatta and in the track
meet will more than give the Cardinal the edge on the 1919 athletic performances. After all is said, baseball, track,
and crew are the mainstays of spring athletic competition. To win all of these in one year is something that Cal
ifornia has never done, and Stanford but once, in 1913.
Captain Watts and Coach Rogers have worked ceaselessly all season to turn out just what we have now, three
boats which will make every Stanford man proud to "say that he gets his education in the vicinity of Palo Alto.
They may not win the regatta, but they will be up there at the finish, and it is my opinion that the only thing

that can keep them behind the Blue and Gold oarsmen is heart failure or a hole in the boat. The doctor says that
all the hearts are beating to a regular tune, and the boater guarantees no holes in the shells and no broken oars;
so those of speculative tendencies are advised that opportunity knocks but seldom, and a good investment is in
sight.
DOPING MEET FAVORITE SPORT
Doping a track meet is a pastime engaged in by every follower of the sport, some to a fair degree of accu
racy, and many to a perfection that guarantees to be correct thirty points either way. Doping the coming meet
is practically an impossibility, because no one has been able to tell just what the opposing cinder-path men can
really do. True to past form, Coach Christie of the Berkeley aggregation, has kept some of his best performers

competition in the minor sports. The baseball win, the first in six years, was a big comeback, and stirred the
smoldering Stanford spirit as nothing else could have done. Victory in the annual crew regatta and in the track
meet will more than give the Cardinal the edge on the 1919 athletic performances. After all is said, baseball, track,
and crew are the mainstays of spring athletic competition. To win all of these in one year is something that Cal
ifornia has never done, and Stanford but once, in 1913.
Captain Watts and Coach Rogers have worked ceaselessly all season to turn out just what we have now, three
boats which will make every Stanford man proud to "say that he gets his education in the vicinity of Palo Alto.
They may not win the regatta, but they will be up there at the finish, and it is my opinion that the only thing

that can keep them behind the Blue and Gold oarsmen is heart failure or a hole in the boat. The doctor says that
all the hearts are beating to a regular tune, and the boater guarantees no holes in the shells and no broken oars;
so those of speculative tendencies are advised that opportunity knocks but seldom, and a good investment is in
sight.
DOPING MEET FAVORITE SPORT
Doping a track meet is a pastime engaged in by every follower of the sport, some to a fair degree of accu
racy, and many to a perfection that guarantees to be correct thirty points either way. Doping the coming meet
is practically an impossibility, because no one has been able to tell just what the opposing cinder-path men can
really do. True to past form, Coach Christie of the Berkeley aggregation, has kept some of his best performers

in the dark. His sprinters have' been
woefully weak all season, but the
latest from the enemy's camp is that
Johnson can tear up the cinders with
the best of them when he is in good
form, and is slated to be in just that
trim Saturday. Stanford is not wor
rying, however, for Lilly, Wells, Sco
field, and Maynard will probably be
able to take care of themselves.
Stanford has several dark horses
herself. Templeton is always at his
best in intercollegiate competition,
and may surprise in the jumps. The
Blue and Gold fignin
tne .Jioaa, but Templeton lias hopped
a considerable distance himself in the
past, and with the score close, may

leap into most any one of the three
point-winning places. Green undoubt
edly will be the Cardinal mainstay.
He will win the pole vault, probably
the discus, and will place in the
jumps.
SPROTT NO CERTAIN
WINNER IN DISTANCES
Sprott seems to be the boy that U.
C. money likes to talk about. He is.
without doubt a fast, runner, and it
he runs the half, may take a first
place, but woe be unto Mr. Sprott if
he is figuring on taking the mile.
Teitsworth and Westwick will lead
him a merry chase, and after their
work last Saturday, are confident of
crossing the tape in at least number
one and number three places. Stan
ford «quarter-milers look to have the
relay cinched. Goeppart will probably
see Cardinal jerseys all around him
when he makes the one round go that
all IJlue and Gold followers seem con

fident he will run away with. The
440 is no cinch Berkeley event with
Dinkelspiel, Scofleld, Wright, and
Hurtle running.
A complete resume of each event is
but a rehash of front page dope, and
track chatter, which nearly every fol
lower knows. But one can say in gen
eral that ihe annual track classic to
morrow will not be won until the last
events are run off, and that the sea
son's work of both teams furnishes
poor material for the usual doping
of just who will beat, whom in the
Stanford looks on paper to have a
consi(ler»hip s»ri as thp
California students said after the base
ball series, "One never knows." Coach
Evans and "Feg" Murray have labored

with the Cardinal hopes until the men
are as good as they can be. There is
no doubt but that every Stanford man
and woman will be on the job doing
their share in the bleachers. The Uni
versity is behind the team, and if
boosting from the sidelines counts,
the meet will not go to our rivals be
thlrd event in the day's program,
cause of a lack of support.
TEAMS HAVE
OVERCOME HANDICAPS
Despite freshman failures, and a
tightening of the reins by the faculty
until athletes can hardly be athletes
and students at. the same time, thus
limiting the competition, the Stanford
crews and track team will come
through. They are ready to give their
all for the Cardinal, and we are confi
dent that their all is enough to give
their supporters plenty to celebrate
over tomorrow night.


Varsity, Freshman and Second Varsity Crews work out at Redwood.
