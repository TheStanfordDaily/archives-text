# JUNIOR OPERA TO SHOW STANFORD REAL DRAMATICS
## 
### L.W. Dinkelspiel, '20 
BOUQUETS follow the popular lead
ing lady of an operetta as she
leaves the stage, but never have any
flowers been given to the leading
critic after his review of the perform
ance. The task of the critic is diffi
cult enough to "icare most seekers of
popularity awajf from its guise, even
when the criticism is of an event
that has occurred in complete setting
of costumes, spotlight and enthusi
astic audience. How insurmountable
then is the task of criticising when
the object of criticism is not yet a
finished product, when there are no
costumes, no audience but the coach,
no stage but a gym floor, and no spot
light but intermittent electricity. Hav
ing worked into the Junior Opera re
hearsal through telling Gordon Davis
that my purpose was to criticise and
not merely to look at the leading lady
or the bathing chorus, it naturally
evolves upon me to criticise.
Plot Possibilities Are Marked
Upon reviewing the early rehearsal
last evening of the entire first act and
perusing the manuscript for enlight
enment upon the intricacies of the
plot, many exceptionally good points
stand out in the opera that the 1»20
class is preparing to give the campus.
First of all, the plot of "Three of a
Kind" promises much, even more than
its name might indicate. To call it
original would not be to do it justice
or to be truthful. The plot is unusual,
however, in having a combination of
circumstances seldom seen upon the
light opera stage. A peculiar mixture
of melodrama and comedy gives the
plot its exceptional touch. The humor
of the first act is productive of gen
uine laughs, but is hardly as light as
in some of the recent operas. The
lines dovetail better and are lighter in
tone. There is enough of the slap
stick, however, to make the genuine
humor stand out well in contrast.
Prom a hasty review it can then
be said of the plot that it possesses
excellent possibilities that seem cer
tain of making a big hit with the au
dience when the final production holds
the crowd in the Assembly Hall next
Friday night.
Contrast of Characters Good
In the development of the plot much
rests upon the way the people in the
cast carry out their parts. No plot is
self-acting, so Miss Kirby Ingoldsby,
the author, is fortunate in having
what at this stage appears to be a
very able cast. The acting of Peg
Wliealton in the part of Jack Abbott
is due to be one of the big hits of the
opera; it is seldom that a male char
acter takes precedence in criticism,
but Whealton's part seems to be one
of the most promising in the whole
cast. It is humanly appealing.
Naturally the leading lady will be a
big success in her part, tl is not
more than truth to say that from a
hasty survey the character seems to
have been made especially for her.
The subdued refinement and charm of
Margery Rogers seems most appro
priate to Mis Margaret Wood's acting
and personality. The campus is due
to remember this part. The difficulty
will undoubtedly be in cutting down
on encores that Miss Wood and
Whealton are sure to be forced to
give for the "Kiss Song" that they
will sing in the final production.
Guy de Tois, as Ray Hartman, is
called in his melodramatic part of
villain, is excellent contrast to Wheal*
ton's part, and both characters gain
in the comparison. To further mark
the tone of contrast Miss Dorothy
Johnston in the part of Jill Abbott
has exceptional opportunities. The
same style of acting as carried by
Miss Johnston successfully through
the sophomore play, will most un
doubtedly draw her the applause of
the house in"Three of a Kind."
Lester Seib puts into his acting of
the part of Jacques Gregoires, French,
as the name indicates, the same ver
satility that marks him as one of the
most talented of the amateur Thes
pians around the University. To re
turn to the theme of contrast. The
part of Mrs. Abbott, mother of the
leading man, is taken by Miss Eliz
abeth McArthur, and Gordon Davis
would have had to import from top
notch circles to have obtained a better
society matron and semi-character
part than the acting of Miss McArthur

has made of Mrs. Abbott. In striking!
comparison to her bustling social as-i
pirations is the equally ambitious, ju.it |
as deadly, if somewhat quieter, Mrs.
Rogers. In planning for her daugh
ter, tins ambitious ma*.on, portrayed
by Miss Elza McFarland, seems to have
imbided real "high society ingenuity.
Miss McFarland seems to just natu
rally (it the character and the audi
ence is »ine to experience difficulty in
determining whether lorgnettes natu
rally belong to her or arc just being
used, after long practice, for the oc
casion.
There are other characters that
most certainly will attract, not the
least of which is the vampire role of
Miss Grace Coleman and the bubbling
humor of Gooilwin Knight, who just
naturally rolls about in that part of
the good-natured, well-meaning fat
man. But the choruses must not be
forgotten, even though this criticism
does not deal with the music, of the
opera. That pony chorus is bound
to create a sensation of a typo that
will leave a lasting charm, and the
beauty chorus will remind us that
all the California belles are not in
j San Francisco.
