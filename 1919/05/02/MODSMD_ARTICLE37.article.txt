the University of California claims that its athletic system
h'Shly paid and professionalized coaches is the successful
college athletic system, we are forced to point to results of
■ ®_liJ recent years and be somewhat disdainful. If we do not care
jl to go back that far, we point to our record as made so far this year
■ and our chances for a double victory on the morrow.
Stanford this year lias had one professional coach, Coach Evans,
and he lias undertaken the work of coaching basketball, football, baseball and
That he has been successful in the work so far undertaken, there are none to
doubt, who review the material and then the results. This is in contrast to
California's system, which includes Andy Smith, Walter Christie, Ben Wallis,
Hollander and others. The Stanfo-d system is a system of athletic instruction
where it is needed—and Coach Eva-"* has attended to tliat—universal participation
in athletics, and graduate.coaching where needed. All this has existed at Stan
ford this year. '
The gymnasium classes have been fuller than ever before, candidates have been
numerous for most of the teams. More than this, the difficult work of coaching
a varsity and freshman crew was left in student hands—namely, those of Les
Rogers—and we are even prophesying a victory over Ben Wallis, imported from
Yale,'and his eight tomorrow. The track team, under the guidance of Evans but
the actual coaching of a graduate of the University, Peg Murray, is likewise in
line for its seventh straight win. Could there be a clearer vindication of the
Stanford system of unprofessionalized athletics?
Victory on th diamond, and hopeful on the water and the oval, speak
well for the Stanford system. There can no longer be any doubt that highly
paid specialists are not needed in every form of athletic competition. The interest
of a large number of candidates, the supervision of the coach and the instruction
of the graduate coach suffice for winning teams. Universal participation in
athletic, unprofessionalized athletics, are due for a big triumph and speak well
for Stanford's success at a new and formerly doubted system.
