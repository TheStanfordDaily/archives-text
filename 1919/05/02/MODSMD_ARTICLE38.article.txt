# JUNIORS PLAN A GALA WEEK
## 
### 
WITH the approach of junior Week, the biggest and most all-including week
of the year, Stanford men and women are becoming cognizant of the fact
that it is only a few days off until the university campus will be aroused with
the real spirit and enthusiasm which always comes with junior activities. The
1920 class has done well in making preparations, and there is every reason to be
lieve that no one will be - disappointed with the results. Capable persons have
been putin charge of arranging the programs for the different events, and the
committee now feel that everything necessary has been done to insure the com
plete success of this coming Junior Week. The members of each committee are
as follows: Junior Day, Harold Swendsen, chairman, John Sturgeon, and David
Ghrist; Junior Opera, Arthur George, chairman, James Boyle, Merlin Maynard,
Harry Wadsworth, Anna nd Ruth Elsinger; Junior Prom, Sterling
PilMvv m Frank Thomas, Alice Faitoute, Margaret
ling of Junior Week, will be fired over
;im 'i . ...Â» . at 8:30 o'clock. Fire works to the extent of
yiw nave been ordered from the city, and on that night many sky rockets will
shoot into the air, huge fire crackers will go off on the shore, and all Lagunita
will be lit up with a glorious blaze, as on a perfect Fourth of July.
Friday evening, May 9, promptly at 8:15, the curtain will rise in the Stan
ford Assembly Hall upon one of the best Junior Operas ever staged at this Uni
versity. The title of the opera is "Three of a Kind," and was witten by a
woman of the University, Miss Kirby Ingoldsby, '21, who, although author of
this Junior Opera prefers to remain a mechanical engineering major. Miss
Ingoldsby has combined in her extreme original plot some striking characteriza
tions, each seen is distinctive in itself and capable of producing many varied
situations.
There have been rumors that this 1920 show will rival all others previously
produced on the Stanford campus, and there seems to be every reason to believe,
that from all present indiications, this rumir may become a truth. Tickets will
be on sale next week at the campus bookstore, and at Robinson & Crandall's in
Palo Alto. The drawing for seats will take place Monday at 1:10 sharp, at the
bookstore. A large crowd is anticipated; so the first one in line will of course
stand the best chances of securing the most desirable seats.
On Saturday morning, May 10, are scheduled the lake sports which will in
clude tilting contests, swimming races, and class crew races. A novel feature
has been evolved for one of the tilting contests, when instead of the men tilting
with the men, and the women with the women, thre will be one man, and one
woman in each canoe. This feature will lend an element of excitement to the
event, and the winner will receive a free ticket to the prom.
Besides the lake sports, interclass socceer matches are to be played off on
Saturday afternoon on the field. Victors will receive class numerals, and have
their names engraved on the soccer shield.
