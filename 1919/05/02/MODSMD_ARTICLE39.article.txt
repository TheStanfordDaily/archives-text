# Stanford Mat Men Have Edge on California
## 
### R.D. Campbell, '22 
STANFORD'S wrestling aggrega
tion has proven itself to be the
strongest that lie appeared for the Car
dinal in late years. Due to early prac
tice, which started in January, and to
the number of old team men to back
up the locals, the Stanford teams, both
varsity and freshman, have shown them
selves to be far superior to former
teams in their mat work. Much out
side competition this year has put the
men on their feet, and with this experi
ence, they should have no trouble in
meeting their Bruinite rivals with a
fighting spirit.
Coach Jones has been a big asset to
the locals. Jones is a point winner in
the wrestling game. He is an old var
sity man. and with his experience has

j been able to give the teams much prac
tical training. The work under the
coach has not been confined to matches
between class members, but has con
sistent included training in various ex
ercises throughout the drill period. It
has proven that under this system the
men have profited beyond measure.
Coach Jones has wrestled with his men
considerably, and in this work has been
assisted by Egami. Egami who will ap
pear for the Cardinal in the 125-pound
class, is an old team man and a veteran
of the intercollegiate meets with Cali
fornia during the past two years. He
has 'given the newer men in the sport
much advice and training. Egami is not
a jui-jutsi man, but knows something
about the Japanese pastime; coupled
with his own ability on the mat, he
has proven himself invaluable to the
wrestling artists.
The varsity line-up is an all-star
picked team. With the exception of
three old varsity men, the present team
is made up of new men in the activity.
When wrestling practice was started the
first of the year, there were about twen
ty new men signed up. Out of this
number five men have made the varsity
team,
Bunds is, without a doubt, one of the
strongest men on the team. He has
never fought in intercollegiate contests,
but what he lacks in experience, he will
make up in speed and weight. Bunds
will just be able to make the 158-pound
class. In the past few bouts with the
city "Y," Bunds has proven his ability
to handle the heavy-weight class with
case. But in the California meet to
night, Coach Jones believes that a win
in just one of the heavy-weight matches
will insure the meet for Stanford. Ac
cordingly he has put Bunds in to fill this
class, feeling almost confident of .suc
cess.
The three old varsity men on tonight's
line-up arc Kakamoto, Gonzales, and
j Egami. All three have had past experi
[ence in wrestling matches with Cali
j fornia and city clubs. Egami will
| wrestle in the 125-pound, class, and if
past successes count for anything, he
| should walk off with the bacon. Egami
j has never lost a match in any intercol
legiate meetfi and can throw any mem
ber of the wrestling team at Stanford.
Gonzales has been out for wrestling
I only this quarter, following his work on
| the football team of last quarter. He
| has had much past experience in class
I matches, and since his return to the
mat lie has shown that he has not Inst
; his old form. Kakamoto is the heavy
, little man that will wrestle in the 110-
j pound class. In no intercollegiate bouts
i has he ever lost a match. Kakamoto is
ja small man, weighing just 110 pounds.
With him, size counts for little.
