# EASTERN COLLEGE WOMEN VERSUS THOSE OF WESTERN UNIVERSITIES
## 
### Emily Howard, '16, Vassar 
1 HEARD a Stanford woman say the other day that the average eastern
j 1 college woman's conception of middle west and western universities is that
of a place where they dance every night; come in any time they please;
go out when they wish; where men and women can he seen studying in silvan
quit under a lovely and picturesuqe tree,—together, of course; and where
i niversity life itself is wrapped up in a mystery of sororities, late hours, mixed
classes and men. She really maligned the college woman, because, as a matter
of fact, eastern colleges are drawing more and more on western states. Women
from the west go east because they know their own life and wish to learn a
different one. I here really is no distinct "eastern college type."
T asked my friend what her theory of an "eastern college woman" was.
I found that it had a lot to do with horn-rimmed Oxford glasses, beautified with
u scholastic-looking black ribbon, the suffrage question, high-brow subjects and
.i serious aspect 011 life. All of this really libels the college woman. The
same type that in the west goes to a university, in the east goes to a woman's
college. She may be a little younger in her outlook 011 life; a little less
j sophisticated; not quite so able to handle most situations her first two years
.is her western sister; and a little narrower in her judgments 011 some things
and surprisingly broad on others. She develops an average capacity to manu
facture a good time for herself; and she creates a fund of enthusiasm which
the university woman might emulate.
I here aie so many things to interest her. Unlike the university woman,
who divides her interest with men and usually takes the small end, she is the
whole college. The college paper, magazines, clubs, societies, organizations,
student policies; all these are hers, and she is vitally interested in them. One
reason, perhaps, why college women seem to shout louder for suffrage than
university women is that the former get such a taste of it in their college days.
I here is, surprisingly, a keener interest in athletics in the colleges than in
the western universities. This is partly due to the fact that men's athletics
is made so much of and so much enthusiasm is put into it, that there is little
left over for "co-ed" athletics, even among themselves. Ice hockey field hockey,
crew, basketball, tennis, swimming—there is keen interest in all of these, and
for lack of competition with other colleges, they have sharp competition between
classes. It is indeed very sharp. I here are class yells, class songs and lots
of class pep.
1 heir good times are all "girl times; but don't for a minute imagine that
men don't enter into their calculations. Some really scorn or ignore the sex,
but with the average girl "absence makes the heart grow fonder." T fancy the
per cent of engaged girls in a senior class at a woman's college would be con
siderably larger than in a "co-ed" university. A western man once said that
the eastern woman, college or otherwise, "knew how to treat a fellow." They do.
They unconsciously make a study of it. But the western woman, particularly a
"co-ed','—don't sniff, mere man,—makes a better pal. She has played with
men, and while it may make her appear blase to them at times, the fact of the
matter is that association has so educated her that she won't he satisfied with a
man—merely.
Being surrounded by the college walls, with usually only a few week-end
leaves allowed her, the eastern woman's life becomes somewhat narrow. She
does not get a perspective on herself or her work. This is one of the reasons
why she has a "serious outlook 011 life." She does take lierslf seriously. She
frequently feels imbued with a purpose, usually of reform. Her professors
rather often foster this spirit, tempering it with a touch of hemor. Have you
ever noticed that the the person with a purpose is sometimes lacking in that
very thing?
Despite her interest in reform, etc., the eastern college woman's conversa
tion, when not in the meetings, is confined almost wholly to purely college
matters. In fact, she is for all her trying not quite as high-brow as we picture
her.
It is also commonly thought that college life is much more conventional
than university life. Except where the question of chaperonage and the like
is concerned, it is not. The college woman doesn't have to be so careful of
what she says—for fear it might be misconstrued; nor of what she wears,
because she says, "Why bother?" There is nobody to please and nobody to
criticize. As a consequence, the college woman has in some ways more personal
liberty than a university girl would dare allow herself. For, truly, there is
nothing so observant or critical as the masculine part of a co-educational insti
tution.
