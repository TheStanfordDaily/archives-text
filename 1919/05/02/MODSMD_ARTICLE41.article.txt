# "WHEREFORE NOT THE SHIMMEE"
## 
### Adam Glikbarg, '19 
Considerable comment seems to
have been recently driven 011 the
campus, directed by our newly ac
quired terpsichorean friend â€”the
beautiful, but he hereby takes (he
to favor the vulgar or even the 11011-
beautifulu, but he hereby takes the
plunge: the writer favors the shim
mee.
011 a recent tour of San Francisco,
the penographer of this manuscript
had the pleasure of meeting J. Angus
Washington, a resident of our west
ern metropolis, and employed by O.
Tempest Purnell, owner of one of San
Francisco's cafes, and whose first
name is Oscar. Washington, who met
the writer by prearrangement at
Lotta's fountain, is the originator of
the shimmee. Imbued with (he vi
brating passion of purity (inspirer by
a recent number of a college comic)
(he writer was opposed (o (he dance
which lias caused so much discussion,
; (o wit: the shimee. Following (he in
terview with Aligns Washington, how
ever, the writer was forced to ask,
"Wherefore NOT the Shimmee?"
Mr. Washington said in part: "The
| world progresses in short, spasmodic
; spasms, mostly occasioned by snr-
I prise. The shimmee's part in the
I present arrangement of things is to
| occasion surprise. Hy surprising, it
| spasmodically advances things, there
by being equqivalent to all new in
ventions." (Thus far Mr. Washing
lion's remarks were all introductory,

and the writer had to admit that he
had heard better stuff. He continued):
"When Fulton discovered penmanship,
Gutenburg the steamboat ,and Gus
tavus Adolphus the postoflice depart
ment, all were sniffed at with a de
rision that I consider to have been
occasioned by a lack of optimistic re
ceptance." (The writer wasn't fol
lowing Angus well at this stage, so he
didn't interrupt ihim.) "Everything
new is objected to by the bulk of con
servative mossbacks who only enjoy
life on Thanksgiving and Valentine's
birthday," went on Washington. "My
idea is new. It is a beautiful con
coction affording wholesome amuse
ment to the modern radical of the
dance, who has tired of the provinci
alism of the one-step, has become
bored with the unsensationalism of
the fox-trot, and has become annoyed
with the obsoleteness of the floor re
quiring disguss of the waltz. I realized
the exigencies that demanded some
thing new, and believe that 1 found
the requisite institution in the shim
mee."
The writer was in a dilemma about
how to receive such logical remarks,
so he decided to accept them for
true; being under the impression that
to the true all things are true; just as
to the pure all things are pure. Hav
ing borrowed a dollar three from An-
I gus the writer returned to the cam
pus, inquiring of himself on the way:
"Wherefore not the Shimmee?" So
far no one has been able to answer
the question succssfully.
