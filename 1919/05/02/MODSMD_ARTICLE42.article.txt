# Women's Athletics Not Supported

### Florence Hocking, '22 
TO start with, it is highly significant
that while there Is a Daily Palo
Alto reporter for each branch of men's
athletics, one to crew, one to track, one
to baseball, and so on, there is but one
reporter assigned to all of women's ath
letics; and without any question, the
assignment is perfectly just.
In the winter quarter, tennis sched
ules were arranged for interclass match
es, with a view to an inter-scholastic
tournament, but only about ten per
cent of the games were ever played.
Basketball was attempted, and enough
women finally qualified for a varsity
team, but only after much persuasion
to come out for practice on the part of
the captain. Successful interclass games
have not yet been accomplished, be
cause of the fact that six women from
each class have been too busy with
classes, too "thrilled" about dances to
get their hair mussed, or too timid
about getting hurt.
Hockey was the only sport carried
through with any success, and this was
due largely to the untiring efforts of
the present hockey captain.

the major spor-ts. The very creditable
showing made in the baseball game last
Saturday, is indicative that this might
well be given more attention. With
still six weeks' more time, crew and
swimming should assume large pro
portions. Stanford boasts of excellent
women swimmers, and there is not as
much inertia shown here as in the
other sports. The addition of another
shell would largely facilitate crew ac
tivities.
The attitude of the Stanford men
towards women's athletics has dis
couraged 'more than one would-be base
ball player or tryoutee. If this popular
derision would close, doubtless more
would be accomplished by the women.
With Women's Field Day approxi
mately only two weeks away, and appar
ently very few plans as yet formulated
for it, now is the time for the women
to show the spirit that is in them, the
same spirit that kept Stanford going
while the men were "over there." Stan
ford spirit, house interests, and personal
pride are all appealing for support in
women's athletics.
