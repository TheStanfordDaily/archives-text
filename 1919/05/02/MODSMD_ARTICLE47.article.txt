# Constitution Will Unite Local Greeks
## 
### S.T. Whittlesey, '20 
I T is as yet too early to make any es
timate of the working ability of the
new inter-fraternity conference. In fact
the entire work of that body is still in a
plastic state. There has been little defi
nite action taken. However, what ac
tion has been taken will allow of cer
tain general suppositions.
It is generally known that the confer
ence was called together as a meeting
of the presidents of the various frater
nities 011 the campus, more or less un
der external rather than internal pres
sure. And it is generally supposed
that the conference will take steps to
bind the fraternities closer together to
ward a common purpose.
As yet. there has been little accom
plished, except for the adoption of a
constitution which creates a conference.
Yet this constitution has within it the
germ of something worth while. If it
will improve the standards of the fra
ternities as a whole and bind them to a
closer unity, it will prove its worth and
satisfy external pressure. If it does
not do this, it is worthless, and other
steps must be taken which will not be
as generally acceptable as a mutual
agreement.
Heretofore one of the greatest evils
of the past system has been the "cut
throat" rushing and early pledging. The
lirst blow is aimed at this evil. It does
away with the old plan of pledging a
man practically the minute he se'.s foot
in the house, and the consequent inabil
ity to judge accurately of his true char
acter.
A fairly large percentage of ifien on
the campus have not I efore considered
this i'-n evil. It is 110 iouh: true that
many of the local fraternities have in
some caseS profited rather than lost by
the .old svstem. By requiring men to
live on the campus one quarter before
being pledged it will necessitate a higher
standard, rather than a good rushing
appearance for a few days.
There are probably many other
things, such as scholarship and fresh
man discipline, which will indue course
arise, but as yet it is impossible to
predict just how the campus views will
manifest themselves.
The whole system will take time to
work out. New problems will contin
ually arise, which can be settled only by
the collective effort and thought of the
various living groups. How far these
problems will go is hard to determine
now. But it is safe to say that there
are numberless questions which will be
safer if entrusted to all the fraternities
than if left to the discretion of each.
The matter of unity of action is there
fore one of primal importance. We
cannot conceive of a constitution ac
complishing its purpose it"it binds one
group and not another. It must mani
festly bind all or none. And in this
respect alone it will do much for the
betterment of the fraternities. It will
unite liiem to act as one, to allow or
not to allow certain practices among
the houses. How far this can be carried
is a matter of conjecture. The confer
ence might he conceived ultimately to
become a sort of court, exercising a ju
dicial function in disputes between the
houses.
But any effective work which this
body is to accomplish must be enforced.
Herein lies the weakness of many an
otherwise good constitution. Adequate
provision must be made for any vio- j
lations. And this raises another itn- j
portant problem. Who is to judge of
the intent of any violation, and who
is to fix the penalty? Will that frater
nity which has violated the rules be al
lowed to vote at its own trial? But
these are technical matters which are
being settled by the representatives. It
is at present the bigger things that in
terest us.
The present agreement is taking
shape. It will soon be in running order.
Whether it runs smoothly or not will
depend in great measure upon the back
ing which it receives from the frater
nity men themselves.. It cannot be set
tled by a handful of representatives |
meeting together, ft was not the origi
nal constitutional convention which
made American government a workable
thing. It was the American people who
made it possible. And it is the frater
nity men who will make possible the,

ultimate success of an inter-fraternity
constitution. To be workable it must
be agreeable to a majority of those di
rectly concerned, for if it is not agree
able, 110 outside influence can make it,
as a constitution, workable.

satisfy external pressure. If it does
not do this, it is worthless, and other
steps must be taken which will not be
as generally acceptable as a mutual
agreement.
Heretofore one of the greatest evils
of the past system has been the "cut
throat" rushing and early pledging. The
lirst blow is aimed at this evil. It does
away with the old plan of pledging a
man practically the minute he se'.s foot
in the house, and the consequent inabil
ity to judge accurately of his true char
acter.
A fairly large percentage of ifien on
the campus have not I efore considered
this i'-n evil. It is 110 iouh: true that
many of the local fraternities have in
some caseS profited rather than lost by
the .old svstem. By requiring men to
live on the campus one quarter before
being pledged it will necessitate a higher
standard, rather than a good rushing
appearance for a few days.
There are probably many other
things, such as scholarship and fresh
man discipline, which will indue course
arise, but as yet it is impossible to
predict just how the campus views will
manifest themselves.
The whole system will take time to
work out. New problems will contin
ually arise, which can be settled only by
the collective effort and thought of the
various living groups. How far these
problems will go is hard to determine
now. But it is safe to say that there
are numberless questions which will be
safer if entrusted to all the fraternities
than if left to the discretion of each.
The matter of unity of action is there
fore one of primal importance. We
cannot conceive of a constitution ac
complishing its purpose it"it binds one
group and not another. It must mani
festly bind all or none. And in this
respect alone it will do much for the
betterment of the fraternities. It will
unite liiem to act as one, to allow or
not to allow certain practices among
the houses. How far this can be carried
is a matter of conjecture. The confer
ence might he conceived ultimately to
become a sort of court, exercising a ju
dicial function in disputes between the
houses.
But any effective work which this
body is to accomplish must be enforced.
Herein lies the weakness of many an
otherwise good constitution. Adequate
provision must be made for any vio- j
lations. And this raises another itn- j
portant problem. Who is to judge of
the intent of any violation, and who
is to fix the penalty? Will that frater
nity which has violated the rules be al
lowed to vote at its own trial? But
these are technical matters which are
being settled by the representatives. It
is at present the bigger things that in
terest us.
The present agreement is taking
shape. It will soon be in running order.
Whether it runs smoothly or not will
depend in great measure upon the back
ing which it receives from the frater
nity men themselves.. It cannot be set
tled by a handful of representatives |
meeting together, ft was not the origi
nal constitutional convention which
made American government a workable
thing. It was the American people who
made it possible. And it is the frater
nity men who will make possible the,

ultimate success of an inter-fraternity
constitution. To be workable it must
be agreeable to a majority of those di
rectly concerned, for if it is not agree
able, 110 outside influence can make it,
as a constitution, workable.
I T is as yet too early to make any es
timate of the working ability of the
new inter-fraternity conference. In fact
the entire work of that body is still in a
plastic state. There has been little defi
nite action taken. However, what ac
tion has been taken will allow of cer
tain general suppositions.
It is generally known that the confer
ence was called together as a meeting
of the presidents of the various frater
nities 011 the campus, more or less un
der external rather than internal pres
sure. And it is generally supposed
that the conference will take steps to
bind the fraternities closer together to
ward a common purpose.
As yet. there has been little accom
plished, except for the adoption of a
constitution which creates a conference.
Yet this constitution has within it the
germ of something worth while. If it
will improve the standards of the fra
ternities as a whole and bind them to a
closer unity, it will prove its worth and
satisfy external pressure. If it does
not do this, it is worthless, and other
steps must be taken which will not be
as generally acceptable as a mutual
agreement.
