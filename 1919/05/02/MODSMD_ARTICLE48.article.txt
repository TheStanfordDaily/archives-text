# SOME STORIES OF EXPERIENCES AS MEMBER OF ALLIED AIR SERVICE
## 
### George M. Kyle, '18 
TIIE cold blast of a 100-mile wind tore at our face masks and goggles
and tried to rush through the tiny openings left in our helmets as we
leaned over the side of the machine and watched our hombs begin their down
ward journey. Far below, looking like a city of toy houses, lay the town of
Rombach nestled on the banks of a silvery stream that poured into the Moselle
which ran, barely discernible, in the misty distance. On the horizon the Vosges
Mountains blended the blue of the sky with the. darker shades of the winter
ground, and in all directions the earth spread out like a great panorama until
the mist shut out further vision.
We were describing a great circle in order to get a better view of the
work accomplished. Soon the flashes of red and puffs of smoke began to
appear in the region of the munitions plant we were supposed to hit. The
r nti-aircraft guns were, as usual, shooting wide, and the only Boche planes
to be seen were specks far in Germany. We had plenty of time to observe,
but still at a height of eighteen thousand feet one cannot sec much. We went
home wondering whether we really had accomplished anything.
This is where the story begins. A few weeks later a printed pamphlet
arrived at headquarters, and in a short time there was an interested group
around it. The squadron commander began reading it aloud so everyone could
hear, and the first item was the statement that the raid accomplished by the
Fmch airmen on January 3 at eleven in the morning had completely wrecked
the munitions plant at the town of Rombach, and it was estimated that it would
require over six months to rehabilitate it. It contained other results of work
done and in addition the detailed drawings of all the latest German planes.
This paper came to. us regularly every month through Switzerland and kept
the allied commanders thoroughly familiar with the latest developments of the
enemy's air plans. Although not so much advertised, the allied secret service
was just as efficient as that of the Germans.
The Independent Air Force of the Royal Flying Corps was carrying on
night operations against the German towns in the same sector we were working
in. For several nights they had been bombing a certain plant in the Moselle
Valley, but seemingly without much success, for on returning the following
evening they would find the place brilliantly lighted and carrying 011 full blast.
They bombed it heavily every evening and were becoming rather mystified when
intelligence arrived from the secret service that the Boche had built a false
framework miles from the real factory and lighted very profusely with electricity.
This they would rebuild as fast as it was destroyed. Meanwhile the real factory
was operating with all lights carefully concealed and free from the bombs.
In a few evenings they were surprised by a visit from a Handley Page which
left considerable debris in its wake. Probably they arc still wondering what
happened to their scheme.
"Giro's" and "Maxim's" were the scenes of great numbers of reunion parties
in Paris after the armistice when the stream of prisoners began to pour in.
Amid the clink of many glasses and the sparkle and color of Maxim's at nine
in the evening, Lieutenant X, recently arrived from captivity, told us his
story of the German intelligence service. He had been shot down in a raid
over the lines and landed unhurt i ' of Conflans. The same evening
he was summoned before the Ger ' i . ( '
,some papers for a moment, said:
X?"
"Yes" ,
'"You arrived in France December 10?" * •"
"Yes."
"You remained one month at the school of Pont. St. Maxence?"
"Yes."
"You then spent four months at the day bombing school of Clermont
Ferrand?"
"Yes."
"After this you arrived at the front in the Toul sector with the Ninety
sixth Bombing Squadron ; now, all I want to find out from you is the number
of your present squadron."
The lieutenant was so astounded at this display of knowledge as to his
movements that he gave the number of his present squadron without thinking.
I happened to be an instructor at the school of Clermont-Ferrand at the
time and naturally was greatly interested in the fact that we were being so
closely watched.
The nature of this observation came to light in an incident which occurred
at the field in the month of November. Lieutenant B, an instructor, had
become greatly enamoured with a young lady in the town, who let it be under
stood that she was a countess. She lived in an ancient and aristocratic house
«-nd seemed to be well supplied with money and from time to time would
give entertainments for the officers from the flying field. She was always
very interested in the work at the field and would inquire how things were
progressing and the number of men we were training. The lieutenant made
frequent visits to her home during the hours of liesure and seemed to he on
the point of becoming engaged, or such was the talk around the town. I
happened to know him rather intimately and was somewhat concerned to see
him come in pale and disturbed one afternoon. After a while he told me what
had happened and it was startling enough to disturb anyone. On calling to
see the countess this afternoon he had been met by an agent of the French
government who politely assured him that the lady in question was not receiving
any more visitors as she had been arrested for conveying information to the
enemy and would probably be shot in a few days. For a man in love this
information is always a hit disconcerting and the lieutenant resolved to let his
affections wait until he returned to America, where there is 110 titled aristocracy.
