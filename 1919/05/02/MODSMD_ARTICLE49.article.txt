Mr. Babcock was driving through the
country, trying to buy a mule. Hhe was
directed to a colored man who had one
for sale.
"Do you want to sell a mule" asked
Babcock.
"Yaas, sab," replied the owner, "May
I ask whar yo' live, sab?"
"What has that got to do with it?"
queried Babcock.
"Well," explained the negro, "1 ain't
gwitie ter transfer dat mule to nobody
dat lives less dan two hundred miles
away from here. When 1 sells dat mule
I wants to git rid not only of dc mule,
but of all conversation appcrtainin' to
him."â€”Harper's.
