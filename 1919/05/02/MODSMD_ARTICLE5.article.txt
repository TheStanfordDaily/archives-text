# WRESTLING MATCHES POSTPONED BY BRUINS
## 
### 
Word has just been received from
j athletic Coast Sproul at California, that
lie will not wrestle his team against the
Stanford line-up tonight, as scheduled.
The reason given, is that three men on
the California team will row on the
varsity tomorrow, and will be unable to
wrestle here this evening.
Coach Jones at Stanford tried to
have a part of the Stanford-California
matches run this evening, and the rest
on next Wednesday. Sproul would not
consider this proposition, but signified
his intention of bringing his team to
the farm on next Wednesday.
Stanford wrestlers have all made
their weights for the intended meet to
night. During the past week the team
men have been working out regularly
and this announcement, coming as it
does, at the last minute, throws the en
tire team out of condition for the meet,
which, if Coach Sproul decides to bring
a team down, will be on Wednesday
night.
