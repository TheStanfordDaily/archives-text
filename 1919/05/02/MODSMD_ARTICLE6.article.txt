# TRACK MEN AWAIT STARTER
## Dopsters Figure Closest Meet in Years 
### Jessee E. Thrash, '21 
WHEN the starter's pistol cracks for the first race tomorrow afternoon at
2:30, Stanford and California track teams will start off on what is pre
dicted to be the hottest contest that has been seen on the Pacific Coast oval
since 1915. Frank Foster, Olympic Club coach, will handle the gun and start
all races.
With every athlete at the two institutions in the best of condition as the re
sult of a long and favorable training season, several records are likely to be
smashed in the contest tomorrow. Green has several times this year come within
a few inches of the pole-vault record. Merchant of California looks like a
dangerous contender for new honors in the broad jump. The present record of
50 seconds flat in the 440-yard dash is likely to fall before Dinkelspiel or Geop
part.
Caughey Strong in Shot
Caughey has been heaving the shot above the 43-foot mark and is doing much
better work than Billman was two years ago, just before he set the present
record. However, it is doubtful if he will be able to shove the sixteen pounds
of lead out to 48 feet, the present record.
Green for Stanford, and Merchant for California, are counted on to make the
most points for their respective teams. Both men are stars in field events but
can perform on the track as well. Besides high jumping, pole vaulting and

hurling the discus, Green may be a con
tender in the high hurdles. Merchant's
favorite events are the shot, hammer,
and broad jump. He will also be enter-|
ed in the 100-yard dash.
Dopsters' Figures Vary
Dopsters' figures on the meet vary
considerable. California fans figure to |
win by two or three points by taking I
the relay. Figures on the "Farm" pre- ■
diet that Stanford can win by 10 to 12
points, by winning the relay, or vary I
from a tie to two points by losing it.
"Dad" Moulton, former Cardinal J
trainer, who has become famous for J
spilling the correct dope on former
meets, figures that the Cardinal victory
is assured by ten points. "Brick"
Morse, sporting writer for"The Call,"
and former California man, refuses to
predict, which means that Morse doesn't
see how the Bruins can win.
440 and Mile Close
The quarter-mile and mile races are
expected to be the feature events of the
day. Geoppart of California, is the
most experienced man in the lineup, but
lias not been doing so much this year as
in the past and Dinkelspiel and Sco
tield are likely to give him a hard
struggle for first honors.
The mile this year will probably be
run faster than it has been covered
since the days of "Skin" Wilson. Both
Teitsworth and Sprott are expected t<»
make around 4 minutes and 30 seconds,
while Westwick may spring a surprise
by beating out both these men.
Sprott Entered in Two-Mile
Coach Christie has entered Sprott in
the two-mile, which gives California the
edge in that event, unless Westwick de
cides to run the two-mile.
In the half-mile Carl Geoppart of
California has been picked as the strong
est competitor but will have to beat the
combination of Teitsworth, Carlsmith
an«l Wilkie. The two former men

should he ahle to covcr the two laps in
a little less than two minutes.
Lilly, Pelouzc, Maynard, and Wells


Captain "Cracky" Teitsworth, '19, who
will lead the Cardinal track team in
tomorrow's meet.
will enter the sprints under Cardinal
colors, and should come very near tak
ing six places in these events. How
ever, California has a good sprinter in
Cantelow, who may be one of Christie's
phenomenal dark horses.
Wells Stronq in Hurdles
Wells has been picked to win both
hurdle races, while King, Green and
Needham may be counted on to take
some places in these events. Green
should take the pole vault and discus
and will make Jackson of California ex
tend himself to the limit to beat him in

the high jump. Templeton also figures
strong in the high jump. California has
a good chance to take three places in
the broad jump as none of Stanford's
representatives are covering more than
21 feet in that event.
Points in the weights and javelin
should he about equally divided between
the rival teams.
Chances in the relay look bright for
Stanford. Dinkelspiel, Maynard and
Scofield are all capable of going under
52 flat, and it would not be at all sur
prising to see Wright equal that time to
morrow. The Blue and Gold team will
have a hard time competing against this
combination, especially if they have to
depend on men like Sprott and Geoppart,
who have previously run distance or
middle distance events.
