# Track Victory Certain, Says Coach Bob Evans
## 
### 
"I am confident that the track team
will come through in the same way that
the baseball team did and maintain its
string of victories over California. The
men arc in good condition and they will
fight until the last event is over. We
know that the campus is behind us and
the Stanford rooting section will be
overflowing tomorrow."
