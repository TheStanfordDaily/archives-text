# CARDINAL TAKES ANNUAL TRACK MEET BY SEVEN POINTS
## CARDINAL EIGHT FALLS BEFORE RIVAL CREWS ON ESTUARY SATURDAY 
### 
IN one of the closest and most ex
citing finishes in the history of Pa
cific Coast rowing, the University of
Washington crew passed the Califor
nia eight fifty yards from the end of
the race on the Oakland estuary last
Saturday and came in a winner by
less than half a length. The Stanford
crew was several lengths in the rear.
Until there remained only a few
more strokes to the finish, the Blue
and Gold shell held the lead. Then
Washington began to gradually crawl
up. New strength was thrown into
the strokes and inch by inch the nose
of the Washington boat crept along
until with one final, spurt, it shot
ahead and led across the finish line,
victor.
Three Starts Are Made
The crews were called back three
times at the start. The first time,
Tilden in the California boat broke an
oar. On the second start the Wash
ington and the Stanford boats col
lided and Watts' (of Stanford) oar
was broken. On the third trial they
got away with a pretty start, and
were running neck and neck for the
first mile. Then California began to
pull ahead and had a lead of over a
boat's length, with but half of mile
of the race yet to be rowed.
Best Team Won
There was not one of ihe hundreds
of excited rooters on the Alameda
mole who would not concede the fact
that the best team won, after they
saw the wonderful work of the Wash
ington boat in that last half mile.

California was leading by a length,
but the white-jerseyed men from the
north swaying in perfect rhythm grad
ually passed them. The U. C. men
made a great effort to regain their
position, but it was too late.
The Cardinal oarsmen worked hard
all during the race and were rowing
in perfect harmony, but the fact re
mains that they were fighting an up
hill fight against two superior teams.
The men in the varsity boat were:
Captain Watts, Williamson, King,
Adams, McGillvray, Davis, Cary, and
Wilbur. Montgomery was the varsity
coxswain.
California Freshmen Win
The California freshman boat won
the two-mile grind from the freshmen
from Stanford and Washington.
Washington and Stanford placed sec
ond and third, respectively, in the
race. The race was evenly contested
throughout, although the California
'22 men kept a consistent lead of
about a length during the entire race.
At the finish the Washington boat
was only a little over a length behind
and the Stanford team was about the
same distance behind Washington.
Up till the last* half mile it was any
body's race.
The freshman boat was made up
of Olmstead, Hancock, Adams,
Snow, Brieson, Sayre, Maloney, and
McKinnon. Boucher steered the '22
shell. The varsity time was 16 min
utes, 44 seconds, while the time of the
freshman race was 11 minute 41 sec-J
onds.
