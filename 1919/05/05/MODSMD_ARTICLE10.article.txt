### 
the track meet safe in Stanford's bag of seven straight
WWF'yVMFHESr. victories and the crew race unfortunately listed as one
of the disappointments, the period of post portems,
regrets and praises is drawing to a close. We cannot overlook the
opportunity to add a little something to the utterances that have
characterized the weekend. Having fulfilled the editorial necessity of crabbing
and complaining before the meet in the desire to swell attendance and increase
spirit, there is no reason why satisfaction at the results cannot likewise be noted.
Stanford's rooting sections were every bit as successful as were Stanford's
teams, and even more sol From the large crowd that sat through the disappoint
ments of the crew race in the morning, the tennis matches at noon and the
thrills of the uncomfortably close track meet in the afternoon, there was a notable
effusion of Stanford spirit. Its revival was marked, and the athletes of the
Cardinal were extremely grateful for its presence.
The fact is that the Stanford stands at the track meet presented an appearance
of equal fullness with the sections that the Blue and Gold mustered to its sup
ports. The assistance of the rooters was noted in the final result of seven straight.
Another element cannot but be mentioned. I lie clean spirit of the Cardinal
rooters in the cheering for the opposition and in refraining from jeering at the
athletes of the Blue and Gold stood out to the credit of Stanford and was
emphasized by the entire attitude of cheer leaders and rooters up to the final
'•"Varsity". —————=
