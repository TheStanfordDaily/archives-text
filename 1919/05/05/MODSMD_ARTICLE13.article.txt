# Co-Edna Falls for Heroic Athletes at Track Meet
## 
### 
Dere Pops:
Iking as you now, of a very spirited
scoolastic nature, I took that live dolars
you cent me for my silabus and went to
the trake mete. It was turribly thrill
ing, Pops, and when I cum hack I
cudn't even speak at the Robbie dansant
that nite, I was that horse.
All the men looked awfully cute in
there H. O. T.'s and red jerseys. I
wud like to have a bathing suite like
them.
I sat in the alumni section because I
thot that would be the only chance I'd
probably have to get their. Rite out in
front of me, Dink Templeton did all his
stunts. I yelled for him, because it al
ways makes the heroes feel better when
the pretty gurls support them. It was so
funny to watch Duke Curtice hurl the
javelin. The javelin is a spear-like in
strument which resembles a disintegrated
pitchfork, Pops. 1 guess Duke must of
come from the farm. They took his pic
ture for the paper and he looked so
sweet and inconscious-like. "Peg"
Caughey was also very conspicuous. He
has a pugilistic bild.
We girls are all just crazy about Jess
Wells. He was just marvelus, Pops, in
the mete. You huv no idea how faslly
he can run. They said he did the 100-
yard dash in 10 too, so I guess someone
else did too.
Mister Dinkelspiel (I have to say
Mister, because I work for him) was
tremendously magnificent in the relay
aiid 1 could tell bye the expression on
his countenance that the race was ours.
Well, Pops, I have to study now.
Always your daughter, .
CO-EDNA.
P. S.—Don't forget about the silabus.
