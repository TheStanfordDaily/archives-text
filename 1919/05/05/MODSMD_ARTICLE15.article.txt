# PLAY FOR BENTFIT OF WOMEN'S CLUB HOUSE IS SUCCESS
## 
### 
"Magic Waters," the play presented
by the Stanford Women's Club last Fri
day night, fulfilled all the predictions
made about it. The style was new to
the theatre-going public of today, but it
was this very quaintness that pleased
those who attended.
The leading role, that of the Hermit,
who was in reality a very learned
doctor who had been exiled, was well
played by Dr. Little. Miss Josephine
Tcrrill, '21, who took the part of the
heroine, the peasant girl Elsbeth, was
very well suited to the part.
The scene in which the seven learned
doctors wrangle which method they
should pursue was full of comic situa
tions. One doctor, who was ap
preciated by the audience, was Florenti
us, portrayed by Prof. Willis, who was
always insisting that they resort to sur
gery so he could use the knife he
brandished dangerously under the other
learned men's noses.
Besides achieving its purpose as a
romantic comedy, "Magic Waters" was
also financially successful. Over $200
was taken in, $100 of which will go to
ward the Club House funds. The dance
that took place immediately after the
play netted $25 profit which was also
turned over to the Club House treasury.
