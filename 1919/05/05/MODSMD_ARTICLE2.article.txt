# OPERA FEATURES SUN AND ICE
## 
### 
Junior Opera tickets are now on sale
it the campus bookstore, and in Palo
Alto. From the preseut enthusiasm
which lias rewaled itself in regard to
the 1920 show, there is little doubt in
the minds of the committee, but that the

tickets will sell like wild. fire spreads.
By attending the Opera, one will have
the opportunity of traveling over con
siderable area of this country in a single
night. First he will find himself in the
gay and lighted Palm Beach, and by
winking an eyelash he will observe that
the scenery has changed, and that he has
been transferred into a veritable icy
climate, where the polar bears roam
about, and eskimos are in vogue. From
Palm Beach to Alaska in one night is
traveling fast, but that is what the
Junior Opera does, and in addition it
teaches something of the future life
of these two places.
There are many young vamps who in
habit these regions; they Hirt with the
men, and eat beans for a healthy diet.
Villains are there, too, bu their evil
plots are not wicked enough to spoil the
beautiful love-scene which goes on be
tween the two leading characters.
Nothing could be prettier than this al
luring scene when Jack Abbott ("Peg"
Whealton, '18), sings to the charming
young Margery Rogers, in real life Miss
Margaret Wood, '20. when they dance
gracefully to the soft music of the Kiss
song. Then something tragic happens,
for the villains have been at work—but
that remains for the audience to find
out, and can not be revealed here.
The choruses will be decked out in
the latest costumes. Eight different de
signs have been secured for the vari
ous scenes when they make their ap
pearance, and each dance is extremely
clever and artistic
The fat man in the show is a scream,
and promises to keep the audience in
good spirits throughout the evening. His
love scene with the countess, Miss Grace
Coleman, '21, smacks of the humorous,

but for all that is quite real.
The social butterfly, Jill Abbott, a|
character part played winsomely by
Dorothy Johnston, '21, opposite one of
the Jacks, Lester Seib, '22. is capable of
winning the affections of the audience
upon her first appearance. In company
with the flattering Frenchman, Kay Hart
man. Miss Johnston displays Iter saucy
carefree manner, and he immediately
falls in love with her.
There are too many complications and
little intricacies involved in the plot to
try to give an altogether complete pic
ture of next Friday's Junior Opera, but
the committee is willing to assure one
and all that they will be delightfully
entertained throughout the evening by
an exceptionally able cast, who will have
the opportunity to act in one of the best
Operas that has ever been written for
a Stanford production.
