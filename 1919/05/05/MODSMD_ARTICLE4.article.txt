Running true to dope the California

and Levy, assisted by the rest of the
California squad.
The best match in the singles was
when Barber met Gravem. The first
set went to Gravem to the tflne of 6-4.
The next set was the hardest fought in
the tournament and went to ducce in al
most every game several times before
Gravem was able to come out on the
long end of a 7-5 set. Levy defeated
Kinney in two straight sets without much
trouble, though Kinney played a pretty
game. In the third match of the singles,
Devlin was defeated by Martin.
The Cardinal men showed more stuff
in the doubles and each match went three
sets before the Bruin players could fin
ally annex the add games. Gravem and
Levy defeated Barber and Turner after
the Stanford men had taken the second
set 6-3. The most even match of the
day was between Rothschild and Stevens
and Fish and Bent. Bent and Fish won
the second set after the California men
had walked off with the first one, and

forced the last set to 9-7 before the
Bruins finally won.
The freshman tennis men came out
better and the Bruin babes were defeated
