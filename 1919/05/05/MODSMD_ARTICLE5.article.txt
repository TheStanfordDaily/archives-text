# STANFORD SCORES SEVENTH STRAIGHT WIN
## WELLS STARS—TEMPLETON UPSETS DOPE IN JUMPS 
### 
SJ ANhORD'S varsity track team triumphed over its Blue and Gold rival
for the seventh successive time Saturday afternoon, when the sturdy athletes
flying Cardinal colors took the twenty-sixth annual track contest from their
California opponents, by the close score of points to 66 l / 2 points.
Seldom lias an intercollegiate battle on the track and field been fought out
with more nerve and grit or a greater display of fighting spirit than Saturday's
contest. Few track meets have furnished the spectators more thrills and breath
taking moments, than this meet. Time and time again when one team or the
other seemed sure of taking the meet, the gritty performance of some member
of another team turned the tables.
Wells is Star of Meet I
To Jess Wells, '20, Cardinal sprinter and hurdler, goes the credit of perform
ing the heretofore unheard of feat of taking four first places in four tries. Wells
romped across the tape ahead of all opponents in the 100- and 220-yard dashes
and both hurdle events, thereby scoring twenty points and setting a new record
for high scores in Stanford-California meets.
Wells' participation in four events was unexpected until the last minute,
when lie went into the 220-yard dash to take the place of "Bob" Pelouze, who
had pulled a tendon earlier in the day.
Templeton Takes Broad Jump
To "Dink" Templeton, '18, goes the credit of upsetting the dope and scoring
the unexpected points in the broad jump, which in the end changed the meet

from a Blue and Gold to Cardinal victory when he repeated the performance of
his brother, "Rick," who three years ago won the big meet by taking third place
in this event.


"Jess" Wells, who starred with four first places
"Dink" went his brother one better
tliis time, though, by taking first place
in the broad, when hundreds of dollars
of California money was talking to say
that the Bruin jumpers would take three
places in this event.
Sprott Bruin Star
No account of the meet should over
look the performance of "Pesky" Sprott,
California distance man, who, like Wells,
performed what was considered the im
possible. Not content with repeating the
performance of Lawrence Chapman's
record in the 1918 meet, by taking first

in the mile and two-mile, the most
grueling events of the day, the sturdy
hearted California!! entered the 880-yard
run and was outdistanced only by his
teammate, Carl Geoppart.
Sprott's invincible sprint was the feat
ure of the distance running of the day
,and seemed to spell defeat for anyone
who opposed him. In the two-mile he
gained thirty yards 011 Westwick in a
300-yard sprint to the finish.
The thrilling events of the day were
the mile, two mile and 440-yard dash.
Captain Teitsworth ran a wonderful race
in the mile and kept at Sprott's elbow
for three laps and a half, but was never
able to gain a lead on the Californian,
whose invincible springs won thirteen
points for the Golden Rear.
Roach of California set the pace in
the two mile and maintained a thirty
yard lead over Westwick until the last
lap. During these first seven laps, Sprott
was staying back among the half dozen
other runners who fought out gamely
the fourth and fifth places. Then in
the final spurt Westwick passed Roach
only to be passed in turn by Sprott,
who came up from behind with his
usual sprint.
In the quarter-mile Dinkelspiel and
Scolicld outran Geoppart on the back
stretch but were passed by the Cali
fornian just before reaching the tape.
Both Green of Stanford and Merchant
of California did less than was expected
of them in the field events. Green failed
to come tip to his usual form in the pole
vault and lost to Peterson of California
who was able to clear only 11 feet 10 1 /4
inches.
Caughey disqualified 011 every trial in
the hammer throw and failed to place
in that event hut took first in the shot
at a distance of 43 feet 1 % inches.
Green won the discus and Curtice
took first in the hammer and third in
the javelin.
The relay on which hung the final re
sult of the meet, was taken easily by
the Cardinal runners, who took a 20-
yard lead in the first lap and main
tained that lead steadily, gaining more
in the last lap when Dinkelspiel retrieved
his defeat by Geoppart by doing a faster
relay lap than the Californian.
