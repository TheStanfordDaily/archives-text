# STANFORD SCORES SEVENTH STRAIGHT WIN
## WELLS STARSâ€”TEMPLETON UPSETS DOPE IN JUMPS 
### 
SJ ANhORD'S varsity track team triumphed over its Blue and Gold rival
for the seventh successive time Saturday afternoon, when the sturdy athletes
flying Cardinal colors took the twenty-sixth annual track contest from their
California opponents, by the close score of points to 66 l / 2 points.
Seldom lias an intercollegiate battle on the track and field been fought out
with more nerve and grit or a greater display of fighting spirit than Saturday's
contest. Few track meets have furnished the spectators more thrills and breath
taking moments, than this meet. Time and time again when one team or the
other seemed sure of taking the meet, the gritty performance of some member
of another team turned the tables.
Wells is Star of Meet I
To Jess Wells, '20, Cardinal sprinter and hurdler, goes the credit of perform
ing the heretofore unheard of feat of taking four first places in four tries. Wells
romped across the tape ahead of all opponents in the 100- and 220-yard dashes
and both hurdle events, thereby scoring twenty points and setting a new record
for high scores in Stanford-California meets.
Wells' participation in four events was unexpected until the last minute,
when lie went into the 220-yard dash to take the place of "Bob" Pelouze, who
had pulled a tendon earlier in the day.
Templeton Takes Broad Jump
To "Dink" Templeton, '18, goes the credit of upsetting the dope and scoring
the unexpected points in the broad jump, which in the end changed the meet

from a Blue and Gold to Cardinal victory when he repeated the performance of
his brother, "Rick," who three years ago won the big meet by taking third place
in this event.
