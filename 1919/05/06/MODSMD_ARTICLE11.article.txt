# OPERA GETS FINAL TOUCHES
## Bathing Girls Feature Chorus Production 
### 
EVERYTHING is now in readiness
for the final rehearsal of the Junior
Opera, which takes its place among
Stanford dramatical productions on
next Friday night. Tickets sold very
rapidly yesterday, and these are but few
good seats left. The financial success
of the Opera is thus assured, and the
cast is now assured of the double sup
port of a good play and a large audi
ence.
Not the least of this production will

be the alluring vampish scenes produced
with the aid of the Pony Choruses,
which will be provided with some eight
different changes of costume.
These costumes have all been rented
from the city, and the committee has
deemed it necessary to expend $50 more
than the usual amount allowed for
costuming a Junior Opera. For this

reason every member of the cast and
both the choruses will be decked in the
most elaborate and appropriate gowns,
and the audience will be kept in one
constant state of excitement waiting for
the displayal of the varied styles.
Last night's rehearsal, which lasted
until 12 o'clock, was most encouraging,
and Gordan Davis, '17, expects to have
the entire cast in excellent condition
for dress rehearsal, Thursday evening.
Admittance charge on that night will be

50 cents, and the show will he run off
just as on the following evening.
Tickets, according to the Opera com
mittee, are selling* faster, than has ever
been the case in any* previous Junior
Opera, and it is hoped that the house
will be crowded to standing room on the
evening of the 9th.

create a sensation.
