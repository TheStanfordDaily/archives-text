## 
### 
A new type of university program will
be presented by Diana Watts in her
demonstration of antique Greek statues
at the Assembly Hall at 4 o'clock Thurs
day afternoon. This artist, by character
istic representations of the ancient
"Discus Thrower," 'The Archer," and
similar antique figures, as well as by her
gift of speech, re-creates the old Greek
characters and ideals.
Mrs. Watts is a member of the Insti
tute Marey of Paris, and is connected
with the American School of Archaeol
ogy. She has appeared in programs in
all parts of America and Europe, and
has been accorded many favorable press
notices by such critics as those of the
London Times, who says of her:
"In point of fact it is hard to define
her art in half a dozen words —one feels
that all Mrs. Watts does and refrains

from doing are, after all, but outward
and visible signs of the central quality
of Hellenic civilization, the power to
evade all excess in thought or word or
deed—it is wonderful."
Dr. A. T. Murray, of the Greek de
partment, is familiar with the work of
Mrs. Watts, and requires the attendance
of all his students at the Thursday
assembly.
Professor Murray, of the Women's
physical training department, endorses
highly Mrs. Watt's art. She exhibits a
system of Physical development that is
considered far ahead of any well-known
ideas. Her methods and poses arc be
lieved to be the most natural and normal,
and yet productive of the best saving of
mental and physical energy. She pro
bably is the most widely known re
creator of Greek statues and poses, and
Greek ideals.
