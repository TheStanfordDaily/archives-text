# VICTORY LOAN LAGS
## 
### 
the announcement today that the Liberty Loan drive
mJEJn AA. j n Palo Alto and . vicinity is lagging far behind its
quota, comes an unavoidable feeling of disheartenment that the big
effort of the country in completing its war task is threatened with
failure. Not alone in the small communities, but in the larger municipal and
urban centers the reports are most discouraging. The country is lagging be
hind and prospects of ultimate success are becoming constantly less and less
encouraging.
Failure in the Fifth Liberty Loan drive would be nothing short of dis
aster, and such a disaster that would rob the fruits of victory of much of
their flavor. Every effort is being made nationally to put the loan over and
assure its success. Every effort should consistently be made locally to fur
ther the national campaign.
It is encouraging to some extent to have it told us that Stanford students
are at least holding their own with the citizens of Palo Alto in the amount
subscribed compared to the quota allotted. There is nothing in this, however,
to be over-boastful, about. Neither Stanford nor Palo Alto is sufficiently near
its allotted amount to be content to rest on its laurels.
Interest in the loan must be taken now, rather than in the future, since
now is the crucial time in the drive for it to succeed or to fail. There is no
time for doubt as to advisability of subscribing. That is a settled question.
Financiers regard the Victory issue as the best financial investment in the
whole field of modern day finance. Surely all appeals to patriotism, local
pride, and national spirit are sufficiently backed by the strength of the Fifth
Liberty Loan to speed it to its ultimate over-subscription.
