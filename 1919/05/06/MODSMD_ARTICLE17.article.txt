# LAST VARSITY SWIM AT NEPTUNE SATURDAY
## 
### 
The varsity mermen will take their
last dip for the present season, when
they visit Neptune Beach, next Satur
day, for the* Pacific Coast Intercollegiate
Championship swim. Coach Brandsten
wants every varsity swimmer to conic
out for the meet, as it is the most im
portant event next to the meet with
California. California, St. Mary's and
Santa Clara will probably compete with
Stanford in the meet for the champion
ship.
Stanford will have as its mainstays,
Caughey, Mills, Goddard. Coonsc and
Newman. Caughey and Coonse will
star in the dashes; Goddard should take
the diving and Newman the plunge.
California will offer a great deal of
trouble with Peterson and Goodman,
both of whom proved themselves to he
exceptional swimmers in the meet which
Stanford" had with the Blue and Gold
a few weeks ago.
St. Mary's will give Stanford, the
greatest trouble in all probabilities. Lane,

is the holder of several championships
in the dashes; Kruger is a record time
back-stroke artist! while Kauhane is
good for a place in the fifty yards.
Not much is known about the Santa
Clara team, but at any rate, Coach
Brandsten asks the varsity not tr> for
get to come out for the meet.
