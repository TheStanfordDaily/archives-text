# Delta Tau Seeks Damages for Dog
## 
### 
Inter-fraternity rivalry has again come
into the calm life of the campus. The
prize-winning, blue-ribboned, white
starred, Delta Tau Delta bull (dog)
was crushed to the earth by the re
lentless Delta Chi Packard (?).
Last week the Delta Chi's imported
a Packard and soon the cruising car
found the wandering canine, and the
two met. The meeting was short and
nothing more was heard of it until this
morning when notice of suit was served
on the Delta Chi's that they owed the
Delta Tau Delta's eighteen (18.00) dol
lars for damages done to the dog. (The
Delta Tau's are now willing to sell this
high-blooded animal for twenty ($20.00)
dollars.
The Delta Chi's affirm that no money
can be gotten out of the house, as there
is none in the house, and if there was,
there are enough lawyers to keep it
where it belongs.
A late report says that the Kappa
Alpha's have entered into the competi
tion with a canine of crossed blood, b>
the name of Brandy. The strength of
this report is not certain.
