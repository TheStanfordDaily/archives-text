# Dr. Angell Describes Conditions in Belgium
## 
### 
Conditions in Belgium before and
during the war, based upon personal
knowledge formed the basis of a talk
upon "The Effect of the War Upon
Belgium," by Dr. Frank Angell of the
Psychological department before Cos
mopolitan Club last night. Dr. Angell
gave a brief sketch of the historical
background of Belgium, and then de
scribed the systematic destruction
and crushing of the people and of the
country under the German regime,
describing conditions as he had act
ually seen them when serving upon
the American Commission for Belgian
Relief. He then described the meas
ures taken to rehabilitate the devas
tated country, and the thoroughness
with which these measures were en
forced. Dr. Angell closed his talk with
a description of the qualities of
the Belgians as a people which make
it a certainty that within a genera
tion Belgium will again take the place
she formerly held among the nations
of the world as a manufacturing and
commercial nation.
