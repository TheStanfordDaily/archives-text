# Dress Suit Raids Secretly Planned
## 
### 
Spring is here and the heavy fresh
odor of the damp earth surging up
ward toward the sapphire heavens,
and the golden essence of the effer
vescent sun reminds one that another
Junior Prom passes into history next
Saturday night.
With due solemnity and sobriety
the campus population have been in
formed that flowers and "fliverets"
are to be an unnecessary adjunct to
this extraordinary Prom. They are
said to be as undesirable as mumps
and will cause society to look upon
the user much as the man who turns
up with his vest on wrongside out
and minus a tie.
But now, that the flowers are going
to be used to decorate the gym in
stead of reposing languidly on "mi
lady's bosom," we are worried about
something far more intrinsic. And
that is the stimulation offered by the
fact that the marginal utility of the
already scarce dress suit is constantly
going up. Soon it will be quite be
yond the grasp of the average con
sumer ,and then what will happen?
For to miss seeing the Junior Prom,
to lose the opportunity of wandering
through this artificial Garden of Eden
while listening to the soothing soft
melodies of harps and trumpets—well,
it can't be did.
So, in anticipation of this lack that
seems to grow serious, a band of vig
ilantes have been secretly sworn with
solemn oaths to stick to each other in
a raid on the "Priest Factory." For
think of the lovely dark swallow-tails
and tuxedos that are "waisting" over
there. Those who need one of these
dress uniform fandangles for the
Prom are therefore urged to hand
their name to the committee and a
suit will be provided after the next
raid.
