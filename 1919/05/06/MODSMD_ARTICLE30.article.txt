# STATUES FOR LIBRARY RECEIVE HIGH AWARD
## 
### 
With the steady progress in construc
tion of the new Stanford Library conies
new assurance of the fact that when
completed it will rank among the fore
most college libraries of the country, in
artistic architecture and details of finish,
as well as in the books it will contain.
The Board of Trustees has received a
letter from Bakewcll & Brown, the
architects of the library, regarding the
three figures which stand in the niches
across the front, representing Art,
Philisophy and Science. The letter fol
lows :
You will no doubt lie very pleased
to know that Mr. Edgar Walter receiv
ed, at the spring exhibit of the San
Francisco Art Association, the highest
award, a silver medal, for the three
decorative figures which lie executed for
the Stanford Library.
The models for these figures are now
exhibited at the Palace of Fine Arts,
and 1 have heard nothing but very
favorable comment from artist and
others who have seen them.
1 think we have secured works of real
aesthetic merit, which will fulfill the
generally accepted criteria of artistic
judgment. This is a relief to me, as
architectural sculpture is always a dan
gerous enterprise.
Very truly yours,
ARTHUR BROWN.
