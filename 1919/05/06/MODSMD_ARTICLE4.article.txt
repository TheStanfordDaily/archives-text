# PRESS CLUB TO HOLD INITIATION TOMORROW
## 
### 
Public initiation for the new mem
bers of the Press Club will be held
tomorrow. This is the first initiation
which has been held since February,
1917, since all the members were en
listed in the service. Last quarter,
when the club was reorganized, Neil
Petree, who had been pledged before
leaving college two years ago, was
initiated.
The Press Club members claim that
this initiation will provide more
amusement than any formerly held
on the campus. Lloyd Dinkelspiel
"Les" Levy, "Kewpie" Swendsen and
"Monk" Antrim will perform on the
postoffice steps at noon and many
other features are promised during
the day.
