### 
A unique type of assembly program
lias been provided for tomorrow, when
Diana Watts will present her interpre
tation of ancient Greek statues, devel
opment, and ideals.
Mrs. Watts is touring the United
States, and giving a series of demon
strated lectures on the reconstruction of
physical training, according to her
principles of ancient Greek develop
ment. She proves the correctness of
her theories by striking representations
of a few of the best known antique
Greek statues, such as "The Dancing
Hoy," "The Archer," and the "Discus
Thrower." The positions taken by the
artist are considered a revelation of
marvelous possibilities.
The main object of the training so
carefully systematized by Mrs. Watts,
is to awaken the modern human being
to the fact that the training of the will
is a science that may be acquired by
all who apply certain laws of human
movement to gain perfect physical or
ganization.
