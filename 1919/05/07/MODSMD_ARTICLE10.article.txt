# KISS SONG IS OPERA FEATURE
## 
### 
Gordon Davis, *18, coach of the Junior
Opera, has called the first dress re
hearsal of the entire cast and chorus
for this evening at 7 o'clock sharp.
Everything will be run off with as few
hitches as possible, as it is the aim of
the coach to familiarize the cast with
the sequence of scenes, and to begin
with the polishing up touches. Tomor
row evening, for an admittance fee of
50 cents, all those who feel that it will
be impossible for them to be present on
the regular Junior Opera night, can ob
tain a good seat in the assembly, and
watch the final dress rehearsal just as
it will be staged on the following even
ing
Too much stress cannot be laid upon
the pretty scene enacted between the
two leading characters, Peg Whealton,
'19, and Margaret Wood, '20, as an old
friendship is sealed by love, and as
Whealton, in the character of Jack Ab
bott, sings the beautiful "Kiss Song"
to the leading lady.

This song has possibly the most en
hancing melody of all the seven song
hits in the Opera. Mme. Louise Carter
Noe, the English contralto who is a
member of the Metropolitan Opera Co.,
lias written H. A. Wadsworth, '20, the
author of' the "Kiss Song," and has
congratulated him on his splendid com
position. Mme. Noe will include it in
her list of songs upon her next tour
east. She is at the present time visit
ing in California, and hopes to be here
the night of the Opera.
Campus talent has been secured for
the orchestra, and the result is excellent.
At last evening's rehearsal, the chorus
es danced to the music of the complete
orchestra, and the song hits, and over
tures, gave promise of great variety,
and melody. All the music has been
published by the Junior Opera Com
mitte, and as announced previously, will
be on sale Friday evening, the seven
"hit songs'' to be included in book
form, for $1 a copy.
