# University Smoker to Boom Drive
## 
### 
"Pep" and "Jazz" will make the
stnoker to be held tonight in the Union,
one of the hest of the year. Good eats
and snappy speeches should prove an
invincible combination toward making
the evening a huge success.
Le√üoy King. '19. who may be remem
bered for his success at the Memorial
Assembly, will talk on some more in
timate experiences which he had while
at Verdun. King speaks well and his
speech should be one of the most in
teresting of the evening.
"Peg" Murray, '16. well-known ath
lete and Stanford artist, will also speak
to the men. Murray's clever drawings
while in the camouflage units in France,
have attracted considerable attention.
His experience in this work are both
unusual and interesting, so this part of
the program promises to be a real treat.

Marion Kyle, '19, author of numer
ous articles on the war. concludes the
list of speakers. Kyle was among the
few Stanford men who went over seas
with the Royal Flying Corps of the
British Air Service. The British view
points and methods should be unusually
interesting to all men who were in the
American Army. The British success
in the air was phenomenal at the front,
and Kyle's talk on his experiences in
the air service are said to he most in
teresting.
The smoker will arouse interest and
enthusiasm in the Memorial Drive,
which should he concluded as quickly
as possible. If the $31,000 of the fund
is to he subscribed before the end of
the quarter, the student body, accord
ing to committees, must come through
and back the drive with more enthusi
asm.
