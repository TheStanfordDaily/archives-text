# ROUGHS' DAY

* announcement by committees in charge of Junior Wcek
activities that Roughs' Day is to he revived calls our
il, dJL, Jj attention to the fact that Junior Week is about to appear at Stan
ford in partially an old and partially a new guise. Now this idea
of Roughs' Day is certainly an old idea and one of those peculiar phases of
Stanford life, small and unimportant in itself but part of the vital system of
Stanford tradition that we are attempting to perpetuate.
It is the same conception that makes Stanford men talk boastfully of the
Farm when denoting their University, maintain their idea of careless dress,
cords and semester shirt, as that which makes them hold an annual Roughs' Day.
To outsiders such an event means nothing by itself, and the whole sequence of
college events is even of little importance to them. But to us at Stanford the
whole scries of "peculiarities" have become a veritable system of tradition of
which we are eminently proud. Like the heroine of the twentieth-century novel,
Stanford is particularly boastful of being "different".
It is as part of a complte system of tradition, as one link in the chain ot
circumstances making up a college existence that we call attention to each
tradition and urge its continuance, providing there arc no real ingredients of
harm contained therein. There is no visible harm in Roughs' Day as part of
Junior Week, providing there is no offensive stepping beyond the bounds of
reason. Roughs' Day should be a good start to this year's festivities.
