# SMOKE FOR ENTHUSIASM
## 
### 
complete plans laid for the University Smoker in the
Union tonight, there remains only one thing to consider,
viz, the attendance. From the standpoint of a "get together," a
smoker is said to even take precedence over enthusiasm rallies and
team send-offs. From the standpoint of boosting an enterprise, there is certainly
no less informal, less commercialized, and more enjoyable way of doing things
than by holding a university smoker.
Edito- : il comment is unnecessary; the plans for the event speak for them
' ''ie committee, in planning for the smoker, has sought to interest
e learnt less about the Stnaford Memorial than originally hoped
ore less inspired than those who have listened and given. It is
)Ove all who should imbibe some of the smoke of enthusiasm this
evening.
