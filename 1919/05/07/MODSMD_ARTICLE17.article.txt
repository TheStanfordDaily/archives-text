# 1920 QUAD TO GO ON SALE IN THREE WEEKS
## Total Number Limited to 1050 Copies; Only 800 for Students 
### 
In approximately three weeks the 1920
Quad will be placed on sale at the Rook
store, according to announcement made
by the management today. Only 1050
copies of the yearbook are to be printed,
and of this number 250 have been al
lotted to the requirements of the student
body, alumni, and outside orders. Less,
than 800 will be available for distribu
tion among the students, while the
juniors in paying their dues have signed
for more than 250 of these. The re
maining Quads may be purchased ;it the
Bookstore on or about May 30.
The small number of yearbooks to be
published is due partly to the inability
to secure from eastern sources more
than a limited amount of the special
bond paper used, and also to the fact
that the 1920 Quad contains over 560
pages and is the largest ever published.
No organized effort will be made this
year to sell more of the junior books
in advance. The Bookstore will handle
the sale, and will exchange the Quad
for $4.50 over the counter, instead of
using the receipt system that was pre
viously employed. This arrangement is
due to the confusion caused by the ad
vance sales of past editions.
According to the management, the
large dummy representing the book's
present, indications are that the Quad
will appear on time.
Owing to the small number of copies
to be disposed of publicly, students de
siring the 1920 yearbook are advised to
watch for the announcement of the exact
sale date.
