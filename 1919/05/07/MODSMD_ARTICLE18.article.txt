# STANFORD TRACK MEN IN P.A.A. CONTEST
## Varsity Team Will Fight for Coast Honors Saturday 
### 
Track competition of the keenest
sort will be offered to those who at
tend the P. A. A. meet at Berkeley
next Saturday if the list of entries is
any kind of indication of the quality
of the contest. The best athletes of
the coast have entered in the meet,
which promises to be one of the fast
est of the season.
Unusual interest is centering around
the mile and two-mile events, in view
of the close competition of last Sat
urday. The addition of Eddie Stout
and Farmer of the Olympic Club adds
a new aspect to these events, which
now look like the biggest drawing
cards on the program.
Schiller of the University of South
ern California seems to be the fastest
man on the coast in the quarter-mile
events, but will have some fast com
petition when he faces Geoppart,
Dinkelspiel, and Scofleld.
Paddock, also of U. S. C., is looked
to as one of the peerless men in the
sprints and hurdles, but is going to
face some unexpected speed when he
matches up against "Jess" Wells of
Stanford and Johnny Norton, former
Cardinal athlete, now of tho Olym
pic club.
Green of Stanford and Peterson of
California seem to be the best men in
the pole vault, although the strength
of some of the northern colleges and
atheletic clubs is unknown and they
may turn out some surprises.
Caughey, Curtice, and Templeton
will also compete for Stanford in the
field events.
From the present outlook, if the
breaks were even, Stanford should
have a good chance of winning the
meeet.
