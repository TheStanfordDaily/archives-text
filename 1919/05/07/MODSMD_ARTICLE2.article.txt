## 
### 
The shimmee has received its death
blow on the Stanford campus. Follow
ing close on the faculty" edict that there
must be no more of the shameful dance,
the Press Club adds their approval to
the order by publicly denouncing it.
For years the club has been the leader
of opinion on the campus and to have
it take so decided a stand on the ques
tion assures the abolishment of the
shimmee.
At "low noon" four prospective mem
bers of the Press Club assembled on
the postofficc steps to give the Uni
versity the views of the organization.
As these members have already ex
pressed their views on the dance as in
dividuals, it was not surprise that such
a concerted action was taken.
Promtply at noon "Monk" Antrim,
acting the part of Rudolph, the Im
porter, announced that a campus dance
was in order. Two sweet young things,
i'n every-day life knbwn as "Kewp"
Swendson and "Les" Levy, entered the
plot with a dance that was most asthetic.
A moment later Rudolph entered with
Geraldine Gellatin, a transfer from a
prominent San Francisco institution, on
his arm. The shimmee that they shook
was of the newest style and soon the
two innocents that were standing close
by were following their example.
A moment later Hoo-Ray Ezra Mc-
Leslie entered and forced the couple to
stop the dance and leave the campus.
