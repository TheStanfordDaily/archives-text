From the first appearance of the
"Roughs" on the Quad tomorrow, with
the revival of Roughs' Day, until the
last flare of fireworks at the # Lake
Sunday night, Junior Week for 1919
will be a series of enticing entertain
ments.
The four days of concentrated queen
ing, athletics and dancing, come as a
climax to the social events of the sea

son and promise to outline any similar
times stayed for many years before the
war.
Roughs' Day will act as official starter
for the week-end festivities, at 8:0 C)
o'clock tomorrow morning. No sucli
day was featured last year. Its re
vival again this year marks effectively
the return of the campus to ante
bellum days.
Thursday night will put the final
touches on this year's Junior Opera,
as Coach Gordon Davis runs through
"Three of a Kind" in the final dress re
hearsal. According to the usual cus
tom, a large crowd is expected Thurs
day night.
When the curtain goes up on the
finished production, Friday night, at
8:30, the highest predictions of the ad-
vertising agent and the dramatic critic
will be fulfilled.
The leads and the choruses have
drilled and practiced till their dancing
art equals the exact perfection of the
German goose-step as done by the
Prussian goard.
Athletics will enter the make-up of
Junior Week, at 10:30 Saturday morn
ing, when interclass crew races, swim
ming races and tilting contests are
scheduled to attract the campus popu
lation to the lake.. Competition be
tween classes promises to be particular
ly keen and entries have been made for
all events. The lake sports form one
of the greatest attractions of the en
tire week.
The first strains of the orchestra in
Encina Gym, made into a garden of
greenery and flowers, will open the
Junior Prom, Saturday night, the big
formal of the year, which ranks with
the Senior Ball. Already more tickets
have been sold than for nine years.
Music, decorations, eats, which excel in
every detail, will make this the most
spectacular function staged for many
years.
Fireworks and music at the Lake,
Sunday night at 9. are to close Junior
Week, after four days of celebration.
A large sum of money has been spent
in getting a rare line of Independence
Day noise, and fire for this particular
occasion.
With the ringing of the Chimes at
10:30. the fairer part of Junior Week,
will be over.
No vacation has been allowed on
either Friday or Saturday.
