# Student Body to Hold Informal Dance May 24
## 
### 
Arrangements are being made for a
student body dance on May 24. The
Kncina freshman jazz band, which has
performed on the campus before, will
furnish the music. The affair will be
informal and may be in the nature of
a jolly-up. The dance will start at 8.
