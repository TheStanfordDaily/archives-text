# WRESTLERS WIN BY DEFAULT
## 
### 
Stanford has won the intercol
legiate wrestling matches from Cali
fornia on the grounds of a default by
Coach Sproul of the Berkeley team.
The Cardinal was to have wrestled
the Bruins last Friday evening, but due
to two of the California men rowing
on the varsity shell on Saturday, it
was decided to postpone the meet until
tonight. Coach Sproul agreed to this,
but insisted that the Stanford team
should weigh in for the bouts this
afternoon. Coach Jones held that the
local wrestlers were ready for the
bouts last Friday night, had weighed
in early Friday afternoon, and that
they would not be able to hold their
weigiits until tonight. Jones proposed
that the Stanford men should wrestle
this evening on the weights that they
made last Friday. Coach Sproul dis
agreed to this suggestion, and the
meet won by default.
In winning the bouts by default, the
Stanford mat artists are entiled to

their circle "S." Some rumor has
been spread about that the men
should not receive the awards, be
cause they did not actually participate
in the bouts, however, Coach Jones
believes that the local wrestlers have
won the meet honorably and should
receive their just recompense.
Stanford stood fair chances of win
ning the bouts. The heavyweight men
were about evenly matched with the
California aggregation, but the Stan
fords seemed to have the edge on the
lightweights. Every man on the Car
dinal team was in fighting shape for
the bouts, and had been in practical
training for more than two weeks.
Coach Jones was confident of win
ning the California meet.
The local wrestlers will, under all
probability, journey to San Francisco
next week to hold wrestling matches
before viarious cantonments of the
soldiers at the Presidio. The Y. M.
C. A. of San Francisco is pushing the
movement to have the Stanford wrest
ling team perform in the city.
