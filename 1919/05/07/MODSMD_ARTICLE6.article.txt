# Music Club Gives Varied Program
## Stanford Students Render Vocal and Piano Solos During Evening 
### 
Stanford Music Club last night pro
vided both an interesting and a varied
program at the Little Theater. Four of
the eight numbers on the program were
vocal selections, three were given on
the piano, and the other number was
on the violin.
Starting the evening's program with
"The Valley of Laughter," by Sander
son, Miss Gladys Marriott's number was
greatly enjoyed by all. The musical
sureness, poetic feeling and soft ring
ing tone with which she sang was both
versatile and brilliant.
David Elliott in his last appearance
with the Stanford Music Club proved
himself a pianist of such artistry as is
seldom heard here.
Tn the third number on the program
Miss Isabelle Young sang with an ani
mation and virility eminently expressive
of the beautiful yet difficult music she
had chosen.
Miss Ruth Langer played with under
standing, fluent technic and well sound
ing touch, and the audience showed
that this was not lost on them by its
response.
The trio was perhaps the feature of
the evening, the coloring and wealth of
tone of Miss Lorain Noble, Miss Eliza
beth Pierce and Miss Katherinc Hunt
ington giving a worthy rendering of the
selections they chose to sing. The purity
and harmony with which this trio sang
was especially noticeable.
Leslie McCormick in his three vocal
selections showed himself to be a superb
singer. This is McCormick's last ap
pearance and it was worthy of him.
The delightfully clear, clean enuncia
tion with which he sang being espe
cially appreciated.
The only violin selection was ren
dered by Miss Elizabeth Pierce. Miss
Pierce demonstrated by her fluent
technic and well-sounding touch that the
violin did not suffer at her hands.
The last number of this delightful
program consisted in piano pieces given
by Miss {Catherine Huntington. She
played with great delicacy in the pas
sage work and interwove the parts with
an art exquisite but substantial.
Special consideration is due to the
accompanists, Miss Mabel Page, Miss
Mildred Turner, Miss Adelheid Saier,
and Miss Katherine Hutington, for
their excellent work in enabling the
whole performance to be carried off
smoothly. They all played with bril
liant execution that aided much in mak
ing the soloists' tasks easier.
