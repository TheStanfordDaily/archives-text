# "Cholly"Doe Wins Game for Seniors
## 
### 
When the dust had cleared away from
the baseball (?) field yesterday after
noon the score stood 27-0 in favor of
the seniors in the first game of the inter
class series. Determined that the fresh
men should not have all the honors in
large scores, the juniors presented the
1919 men with twenty-six (26) runs.
'Cholly" Doe was the individual star
of the game and contributed materially
to the seniors' twenty-seven (27) runs
by his seventeen (17) errors.
When the seventh inning rolled
around and the seniors had been pre
vented from making any earned runs
by the gifts of the 1920 players, "Ken"
Lilly stepped to bat with a resolve that
was not to be denied. With a mighty
swing he knocked the ball into the
bleachers, and as there was only one
ball, and as no one would chase it, the
Igame was called on account of "lost
ball".
The juniors and sophomores will play
tomorrow night for the championship.
