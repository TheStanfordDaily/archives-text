# ROUGHS' DAY OPENS JUNIOR WEEK TODAY
## QUEER GARBS APPEAR Events to Follow Quickly Fireworks on Lake to Close Festivities 
### 
WITH the appearancc on the Quacl
this morning of the traditional
roughs, Junior Week began. The an
nual Roughs' Day was suspended last
year, but the various costumes on the
campus, especially at the Engineering
corner, gave every evidence that the old
Junior Weeks of pre-war days were
revived.
The week is filled with events of all
kinds, including the opera, prom, lake
sports, and concluding with a display of
fireworks on the lake.
Tonight Coach Gordon Davis will
hold the final dress rehearsal of the
Junior Opera, "Three of a Kind," in
the Assembly Hall. As usual, the re
hearsal will be open to those who can
not attend the performance tomorrow
evening, at a charge of fifty cents. As
the house is practically sold out for
Friday night, Coach Davis is expect
ing an unusually large attendance.
Tomorrow, Friday, the opera itself
will be produced, and the Junior Week
"queeners" will assemble for the first
time. From the rise of the curtain at
8:30 until the final strains of the exit
march the campus will be presented
with a finished product-
Saturday morning at 10:30 the lakf
will be the scene of the usual lake
sports. Interclass swimming, canoe
tilting, and crew races will feature the
morning's entertainment.
