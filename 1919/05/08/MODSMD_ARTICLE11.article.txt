# Saturday is Last Day to Subscribe for Victory Bonds
## 
### 
Subscriptions for the Victory Lib
erty Loan will close on Saturday, May
lOith. The Stanford University com
munity has not yet reached its quota
of $33,000. Two $1000 subscriptions
came in this morning, which is very
encouraging, but we are still several
thousand dollars short of the quota.
We hope a house to house canvass
will not be necessary, but a great
many residents have not yet sub
scribed. It must be done now, ac
cording to S. D. Townley, chairman of
the Campus War Work Committee.
The terms of the loan are easy, six
monthly payments—four of 20 per
cent each and two of 10 per cent each.
If you can't subscribe $1000, come
through with $50 —they all help to
ward the total.
Eubscription blanks may be ob
tained at the registrar's office, the
business office, the Bookstore, or from
the chairman of the committee.
