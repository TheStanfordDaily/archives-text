# PEPPY MUSIC AND UNIQUE COSTUMES PROMISE SUCCESS
## OPERA READY FRIDAY Coach Davis Promises Better Production Than Has Been Seen in Years 
### 
AFTER a rehearsal of the Junior
Opera, which was held last night,
the committe in charge feels that it
will he one of the real successes of the
year. The music is unusually tuneful
with fox trots that make the feet tingle
and waltzes which are full of melody
rhythm. The large part of the music
was written by H. A. Wadsworth and
with the aid of R. F. Nathan and Am
brose Witmer a distinct novelty will be
offered Friday night, for the approval
of the campus.
According to those who have been
connected with previous operas, the
costumes are even more elaborate and
effective than ever before. Unusual
and daring in color combinations, the
costumes present a riot of color when
ever the choruses step out upon the
stage. The pony chorus is sure to
bring down the house as "farmerettes,"
and the beauty chorus will bring in
their share of the honors with the
"vamp" song.
"Peg" Whealton, '18, and Miss Mar
garet Wood, '21, as the leads, are well
supported by Miss Dorothy Johnson, '21,
and Lester Seib, '22. "Goodie" Knight,
'19, lolls over the stage as the fat man
and provides the real humor for the
production. Coach Davis has worked
with infinite patience to perfect that de
tail which stamps a professiontl pro
duction from that of an amateur.
Lcland Pickering, ex-'2O, left as his
distinct contribution to the Opera, the
setting for the second scene in the first
act. The effect is most unusual and
spectacular. All of the costumes stand
out most effectively against such a back
ground and this fact goes tar to make
"Three of a Kind" the success that it
is sure to be.
Tickets are selling fast, and it is
hoped that every seat will be sold on
the night of the production, as there
never had been such a ticket demand in
any previous Opera staged at the Uni
versity. Tonight is the final dress re
hearsal, when an admittance fee of fifty
cents will lie charged all those wishing
to attend.
