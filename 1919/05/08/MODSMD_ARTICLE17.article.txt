# Juniors Must Work on Prom Friday
## Elaborate Decorations Are to Be Put Up in the Gymnasium 
### 
Decorating materials costing the
Junior Class several hundred dollars
have been received at the gymnasium
tor the 1920 prom, and are ready to
be hung as soon as enough men ap
pear to do the work. The committtee
states that the plans and schemes for
decorating are all ready and the en
tire process should be completed with
the minimum of labor.
Work in the gymnasiuum building
will begin at 1 o'clock Friday. The
chairman in charge states that only
a turnout of a large number of men
will make possible the finishing of
tlie scheme without the waste of much
of the expensive materials. A very
elaborate color design of purple,
white, blue, silver, and green has been
devised, and with the aid of a suffi
cient number of workers should de
velope, make the Prom decorations
second to none.
The committee asserts further that
the efforts in the field of music have
been thoroughly successful in the se
curing. of a city orchestra, featuring
banjos and trombones. A variety of
palatable refreshments have been
provided, and the only obstacle in the
way of a perfect Prom lies in hanging
the decorations.
It is urged therefore that all juniors
who can, respond to the appeal for
personal aid in the decorating of the
Encina gym Friday.
