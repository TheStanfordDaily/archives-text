W the announcement by Coach Evans that American foot
jl»>«S3H ball practice was to occupy the center of the athletic
stage during the remainder of the college year, we cannot help but
think of the difficult task ahead in the development of a representa
tive team. Stanford's absence from the old game is sure to work hardships in
the production of a strong Stanford eleven. We cannot help likewise but think
of that overwhelming defeat administered by the Blue and Gold pigskin artists
upon S. A. T. C. team last November.
Thinking upon the difficult task ahead and the unpleasant defeat of the
fall quarter makes us applaud the idea of a strong season of early practice.
The opportunity to learn American football is exceptionally offered by the plans
laid for a spring turnout. Without being under the pressing need of picking!
the best eleven men to concentrate upon, as is the condition when the big
«ames loom close, Coach Evans will be able to give individual attention to a
Ib.rge squad bent upon learning the game.
If we are going to play American football against the large universities next
fall, there certainly rests a duty upon us to get as strong a team as is possible.
The game cannot be learnt in a day, a week or a month. Let s start now on the
team that will show future opponents that Stanford can make the shift from
American to Rugby without impairing a high athletic reputation.
