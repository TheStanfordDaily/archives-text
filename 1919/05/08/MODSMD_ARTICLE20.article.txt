# DAILY BLUSHES
## 
### 
we sa y l hat the Daily blushes to announce that the women's
edition is to hold the attention of the journalistic world tomor
v M /alStwcS row, we are merely referring to the Pink of the Women's
I Edition. In handing over the reins of editorship to the
JBL women of the staff, we act with impunity, although infringing upon
custom. It has been usual in the past to have the freshman edition
just before Junior Week and the Pink sometime later. We have upset prece
dent this year, knowing that the freshmen knew more of the green of the Irish
Marathon and the women more of the blushes of Junior Week.
Miss Ruth Lakin, '19, has been named as Woman's Editor, Miss Lakin
being present ranking news editor on the Daily staff. Upon her falls the
responsibility of editing tomorrow's paper.
