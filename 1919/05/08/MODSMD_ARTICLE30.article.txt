# ABOUT STANFORD

### 
The first Stanford freshman class to
organize was the famed '96. On Friday,
September 16, 1892, the freshmen were
called together by the president of the
junior class. R. C. Fowler was chosen
temporary chairman and Jackman Mer
rick temporary secretary. On the fol
lowing Tuesday the committee on or
ganization presented a constitution. The
lively discussions, which characterized
this class all through its college career,
are dated from this meeting. So heated
did they become that adjournment was
necessary when only one-half of the
constitution had been accepted. The
point under debate was whether sixty
members should be the number that
could prevent a meeting being called.
On Thursday, September 22, an editorial
appeared in the D. P. A. condemning
this policy, and also the fact that the
numerals, '96, were appearing on many
recitation chairs.
The organization of the class was
completed on Monday, September 26.
Curtains were drawn, and the doors
locked and guarded against any unex
pected opposition of '95. During the
meeting a young lady rose and excitedly
stated that a '95 man was present, but
the alarm proved false. The constitu
tion finally accepted stated that ten
members could call a meeting and that
the baseball and football managers
should have unrestricted power in
appointing captains and players. In
the election of officers nine candidates
were nominated. Parliamentary pro
ceedings became so entangled that it
was necessary to call for new nomina
tions. The three men presented were
objected to by a young woman who
stated that she did not know the gen
tlemen. The candidates were ordered
to the platform. Two young ladies were
then nominated for vice-president. At
this point another member declared
his desire of gazing on the candidates.
Thus was born the famous '96 custom
of "gazing on" all â€¢ candidates during
election.
Those who seemingly made the best
appearance were: President, W. W.
Gurth; first vice-president, Miss Nelly
M. Hill; second vice-president, Miss
Helen Willis; treasurer, Henry Harris;
sergeant-at-arms, Mr. Murphy; foot
ball manager, E. C. Jones; anrl base
ball manager, W. L. McLaine.
That the class allowed no grass to

grow under its feet is shown by the
fact that on the following Friday a
football team was organized and the
manager instructed to arrange for a
game with the Berkeley freshmen.
