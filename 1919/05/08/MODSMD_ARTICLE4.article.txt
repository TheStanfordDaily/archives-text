# ENGINEERING MAJORS HOLD FIRST ASSEMBLY
## Pictures Which Deal With Mining and Metallurgy Problems Shown 
### 
Engineers held their first assembly
this afternoon in the Little Theatre,
where moving pictures dealing with min
ing and metallurgical operations were
shown.
The pictures were taken at Inspiration
and A jo, Arizona, and embraced nearly
every important feature of mining and
metallurgical work, showing the in
teriors and inside workings of a num
ber uf the big mines at Inspiration. A
great part of the pictures dealt with
underground workings of the mines,
showing all the phases of extraction of
the metals and their transportation to
the surface. Several processes dealing
with ore dressing, flotation and concen
tration were shown. The interior work
ings of the mills section also showed the
various processes employed in sperating
the minerals from the ore, and the latest
methods of amalgamation.
Explanatory remarks were made by
Porfessors C. F. Tolman, R. R. Good
ricks, and VV. F. Dietrich of the Min
ing and Metallurgical Departments at
Stanford. A large number of civil and
mechanical engineers attended the as
sembly as well as nearly all the mining
and metallurgical majors.
