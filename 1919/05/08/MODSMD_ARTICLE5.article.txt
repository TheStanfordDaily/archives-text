# DANCE BY SENIORS AFTER JUNIOR OPERA
## 
### 
Immediately following the Junior
Opera tomorrow night everybody is
invited to attend a dance given by
the Senior Class at Encina Hall.
Lissner's orchestra will jazz from
11 o'clock to 1. As the largest crowd
which has ever attended the Junior
Opera is expected, everybody should
be on hand early. All those who wish
to get in practice for the Junior Prom
should not miss this opportunity. The
admission will be 50 cents a couple.
