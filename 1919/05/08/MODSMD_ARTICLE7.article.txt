Practice of tackling the dummy, fall
ing on the hall and passing, were the
points that Coach Bob Evans laid stress
on in the first spring Workout last night.
Over a hundred men turned out, and
nearly half of this number have had ex
perience in American football. The
backfield candidates and line men will
practice on alternate nights, in order to
give Evans an opportunity to look the
material over.
The second week of practice will he
devoted to scrimmages, and from then
on the work will he intensive. As next
fall's team will start the American foot
ball season for Stanford, considerable
work has to be done this spring if a
good team is to be put on the field in
the fall From.the amount of men who
have turned out and the number who
have had experience, the outlook for
a good season is bright.
