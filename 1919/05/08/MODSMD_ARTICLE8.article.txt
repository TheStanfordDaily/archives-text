## CARDINAL TEAM STRONG Olympic Club Most Dangerous Contender for First Place Honors 
### 
STANFORD will send a team com
posed of the best point-winners
from the Stanford-California meet, to
compete in the P. A. A. meet, at Ber
keley, Saturday afternoon. At least
nine men will represent the Cardinal
in this meet and several more may be
entered.
The Olympic Club has been figured
as the strongest contender for honors
with such men as Norton. Pyne and
Melville in the sprints, Stout and
Farmer in the distance and middle
distances. and several strong contenders
in the field.
The University ot Southern Cali
fornia has entered a team of three men,
consisting of Paddock, star sprinter
and hurdler; Gasner, also a sprinter,
and Schiller, crack quarter-miler.
For Stanford Wells will compete in
the hurdles and will perhaps enter the
sprints. His showing last week should
be good enough to insure him a place
in some of these events.
Lilly and Maynard will also compete
in the sprints. Lilly will enter the 100-
yard dash, while Maynard will try the
220-yard event. The latter runner may
also enter the quarter mile.
Tn the field events Caughey, Green,
and Curtice will wear the Cardinal
colors. Caughey should have a good
chance of winning the shot, and Cur
tice seems to be a good bet for the
hammer throw. Green will compete in
the discus, high jump and pole vault.
