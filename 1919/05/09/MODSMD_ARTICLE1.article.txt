# JUNIOR OPERA WILL FEATURE BIZARRE COSTUMES
## DRESS REHEARSAL HELD LAST NIGHT "Three of a Kind" Declared Most Original Opera Staged on Campus 
### 
A new song written by L. W. Mc-
Dermott will be included among the
musical specialty songs of tonight's
Junior Opera. The tune is that of "Sa
hara Blues," and will be sung by "Peg"
Whealton, between acts. This idea is
a new one and should make a great hit
with the audience, for the song is ex
tremely clever, and the melody one not
easily forgotten.
Promptly at 8:30 this evening the
curtain will rise upon a typical palm
beach scene, when handsome young men
and women are seen promenading and
eating beans with evident relish. Ac
cording to concensus of opinion, the
show this evening will prove a great
success, for last nights dress rehearsal
was one of the best that has ever been
staged at the University. A large crowd
was present, and they had the privilege
of seeing the opera run off from start
to finish without a hitch, something very
unusual in amateur productions.
The orchestra which is made up en
tirely of local talent, played with much
feeling last evening and gave added im
petus to the star players.
The seven song hits of the opera,
written by Harry Wadsworth, '20, have
been published and will be on sale to-
night for $1.00 a copy. The "Kiss Song"
will be among the seven, but is only
one of a number of musical songs, any
of which is well worth owning.
Therf are several members of the cast
who deserve particular mention, and
who will contribute largely to the suc
cess of the opera. "Peg" Whealton,
'19, plays opposite the leading lady, Miss
Margaret Wood, '20, and their action
produces the real love theme of the
plot.
Lester Seib, '22, and Dorothy John
ston, '21, play somewhat similar parts,
but the two feminine types arc quite
the opposite, Miss Wood being the quiet,
beautiful young heroine, and Miss John
ston the saucy little social butterfly.
Miss Grace Coleman. '21, as the count
ess, creates a character part wholly
distinctive from any other in the plot
and as the alluring vampire delights and
interests the audience. "Goodie Knight,
as the fat man, causes hearty laughter
and carries his part with much reality.
As for the choruses, they create quite
as much enthusiasm when they appear
in eight different changes of costume,
and sing, laugh and dance. Their only
desire is to make the 1920 Junior Opera
the biggest success in years.
