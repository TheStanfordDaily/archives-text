Women's field day will be held this
year on Saturday, May 17. Every
branch of women's athletics will be
participated in. This, according to
the schedule of events, will include
basketball, baseball, tennis, field
sports, such as the discus throw, shot
put and volley ball; there is also to
be lake sports, such as canoe races,
crew races and canoe tilting. Accord
ing to the statements of the captain
of the various teams the day should
prove entirely successful. It will be
divided into two parts, the sports
coming in the morning and the swim
ming and lake sports taking place in
the afternoon. Miss Ruth Garland,
'20, has been elected captain of the
day.
Baseball this year lias taken an en
tirely new place in the realm of
women's athletics, coming to the front
with a jump when the Stanford wom
en's team defeated Mills College team
a few weeks ago. Although there are
not enough women to make up four
interclass teams, a game with an out
side team is to be arranged. Judging
from the results of the last game and
from the fact that practically the
same team will play there is little
doubt about the outcome of the game.
Those who are scheduled to play are
Marie Hutton, '21, Myra Waterman,
'21, Bernice Taylor, '21, Laura Getz,
'21, Mary Therkleson, '18, and Lena
Tavernetti, '22. Miss Marie Hutton,
'21, is captain of the team.
The outlook for basketball is ex
ceedingly good, according to a state
ment by Miss Nellie Shultz, '19, cap
tain of the basketball teams. Al
though it was impossible to arrange
any games with either Mills or Cali
fornia this year, still the way in which
the girls came out for practice prom
ises very good results. Miss Shultz
stated further that the freshman team
stood about the best chance of carry
ing off the honors of the basket ball
contest on field day. During this
coming week there will be two games
to decide which of the four teams are
to participate in the big event. The
class teams are captained by Miss
Irene Bonnett, '19, Miss Doris Hyer,
'20, Miss Marie Hutton, '21. and Miss
Henrietta Hover, '22.
According to Miss Elsie Leiscester,
'21, the sophomores bid fair to be vic
tors in the tennis matches. Those who
will star in this part of the athletic
carnival are Miss Myra Waterman,
'21, Miss Dorothy Elfing, '21, Miss
Elsie ( Leicester, '21, and Miss Fredrika
McGee, 21. The other classes, how
ever, may have some surprises in
store for the sophs.
Both Mrs. Brandsten, swimming di
rector, and Miss Ruth Chandler, '19,
who has charge of the swimming
meet, have high hopes for the out
come of this event. Mrs. Brandsten
may be quoted as saying that it will
be better than the interhouse meet
and that there is a possibility of some
of the previous records being broken.
