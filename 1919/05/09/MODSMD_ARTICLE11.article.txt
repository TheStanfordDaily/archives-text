# Artist Interprets Greek Art Ideals
## Perfect Muscular Control Shown by Varied Poses From Famous Statues 
### 
"Harmony is the one word which ex
presses the Greek ideal of the fifth cen
tury —harmony of the physical and the
spiritual self," said Diana Watts, fam
ous exponent of physical training, be
fore the student assembly yesterday af
ternoon.
Present day people have almost lost
this sence of perfect bodily organiza
tion. That it was a part of the daily
training of the Greek youth is shown
by the works of the early Greek sculp
tors and painters.
"The perfect balance of the body
typified in Greek art is achieved when
the body is carried with the least amount
of effort," continued Mrs. Watts. "To
gain this balance one must have complete
control over the diaphragm, for in it
lies the essential power of physical and
mental poise. The Greeks considered
the diaphragm as the connecting link
between the mind and the body and
sought to control it."
To prove her theories of the ease
with which one may gain perfect balance
Mrs. Watts assumed the poses of vari
ous Greek statues. The poses included
Apollo of Tenea, The Archer, The Dis
cus Thrower, The Warrior, and The
Charioteer of the Capital of Rome.
In the pose of the Archer, Mrs. Watts
used a bow and arrow a thousand years
old. It was the gift of a Pshah of
Persia English doctor who saved
his life and was later presented to Mrs.
Watts "by right of heritage."
Mrs. Watts then gave her own in
terpretation of a Greek Gymnastic
j dance to the accompaniment of the only
Greek music in existence. It represented
the ordinary exercises of the Greek
youth and showed the perfect muscular
control of the artist. The-program was
concluded with a representation of
Athene in her warrior dress.
