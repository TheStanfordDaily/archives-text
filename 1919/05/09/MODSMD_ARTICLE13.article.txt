# ONE PERFECT DAY
## 
### 
ANCE again the Pink Sheet makes its appearance on the campus. It marks
an occasion long looked forward to by the "500," especially those of us who
are on "the staff." Then if ever comes one perfect day when we may be as
terrible or as virtuous as we wish and say those things which we have longed
secretly to say in days past.
The Pink Sheet embodies all that which an ideal paper should. It acts as a
standard, striven for by following editions, but never achieved until its next ap
pearance. For this reason and fully realizing the importance of the moment,
we, the staff of the Pink Sheet, wish to take this opportunity to publicly thank
Mr. Dinkelspiel and the other members of his board, even the freshmen, for
their hearty co-operation of non-interference and non-appearance on thisâ€”the
perfect day,
