some of the recent publicity accorded to the University and campus life
has been far from dignified or beneficial. It is all very well to attract the
interest of public opinion, but when this is done let us be sure that the picture
given is a correct one. That the material is given out by student correspondents
to the various San Francisco and San Jose papers, makes the matter more seri
ous, but at the same time easier to reifiedy.
In some cases the stories sent in by local reporters have been elaborated on
by the papers themselves, the sensational points being featured. This perhaps
is an from the financial point of view, but no true Stanford man or
woman has ever held this as their highest aim. Such announcements give false
impressions and create undesirable attention to our university. Corrected
follow-up stories rarely appear and the impression remains like a bad taste in
the mouth of the public.
Over-exaggerated comments on the Washington parade and the question of
shimmie dancing have appeared noticeably in Seattle, Los Angeles and other
papers over the state, and the ripples thus started have not as yet subsided. Pub
licity is a powerful instrument that may be wielded for good or evil. It is
earnestly urged that especial care and judgment be exercised by those who use it.
