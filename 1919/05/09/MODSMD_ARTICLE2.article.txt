# Banquet Planed for Will Irwin '99
## Stanford Alumni Plans to Entertain Journalist and Wife May 13 
### 
While Will Irwin, a prominent Stan
ford alumnus, and his wife, are visiting
in San Francisco, the Alumni Associa
tion are planning a banquet in their
honor, to be held Wednesday night,
May 13.
The Commercial Club Rooms in the
Merchant's Exchange Building, of San
Francisco, have been chosen as the
place of the banquet, and a reunion of
old-time friends and acquaintances will
feature the day for those present. All
members of the alumni, student body
and faculty, are invited to attend and
arc requested to order plates from Dr.
Karl Schaupp, 516 Sutter street, San
Francisco, at $1.65 per plate.
The alumni living in the vicinity have
given a hearty response and are anxi
out to have as many students and mem
bers of the faculty present as possible.
Mr. Irwin recently visited the cam
pus and spoke to an enthusiastic audi
ence in the Assembly Hall, and also to
the men of Encina, where he lived while
in college.
His experiences as war correspondent
during the present war offer opportuni
ty to relate very interesting stories of
the events, and coupled with bis ability
to speak, make his appearance a thing
every one looks forward to.
