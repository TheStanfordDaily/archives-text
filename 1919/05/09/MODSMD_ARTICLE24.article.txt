The meet is to be between classes,
and Miss Chandler expressed the
opinion that the chances for winning
were pretty evenly divided between
the freshman and the sophomore
classes, although she expected quite
a lot of competition between all who
took part in the meet.
The schedule of events in the swim
ming meet are as follows: 25 yards,
free style; 50 yards, breast stroke;
plunge for distance, 50-yiard free
style, 50 yard back stroke, diving, this
to include four compulsory dives and
two voluntary dives, after this will
come the 100-yard free style, then the
IOOt-yard relay. After this last event
it is planned to have a long-distance
race which will take place at the lake.
There have been a number of women
who have already signed up for this
last race. Miss Caugliey, Miss Carl
smith, and Miss Doris Stevens will
more than likely swim in this event.
After the swimming races the lake
sports will occupy the rest of the
afternoon. There is to be canoe
races, canoe tilting and crew races.
Thees events are to be betwen classes.
Miss Emlie Anderson, '19, has charge
of these sports.
At noon of the same day there is
to be a basket luncheon at the
Women's Club House, at which the
varsity letters and the class numerals
will be awarded and the new mem
bers of the S society will be an
nounced.
According to all the facts so far,
the freshmen and the sophomores
seem to have an equal chance for first
place, but according to all statements
it will be a hard fought battle. All
who have not already signed for the
meet are asked to do so as soon as
possible.
