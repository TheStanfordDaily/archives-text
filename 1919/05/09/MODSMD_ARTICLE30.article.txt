# Junior Prom to Be Social Event of Year
## 
### Florence Hocking, '22 
COMING at the close of Junior Day,
a day replete with excitement, a
day featuring interclass rivalry in crew
and field sports and following the Junior
Opera, which has called forth the best
talent of the campus, the Junior Prom,
on Saturday evening, will bring to a
climax all the revelry and joy of Junior
Week; and if all is true that has been
said of it, it will pass into history as
the most elaborate, the best attended,
and the most nearly perfect of any prom
ever held.
When the music starts promptly at
8:30, one hundred and fifty couples will
sway in time to the strains of "Mary";
men, many of them clad for the first
time since the war in the luxury of full
dress, and women in the gala array
which the prom calls for, will form a
motley and beautiful rainbow color
scheme against the luxurious background
of ferns and palms. Perfection in "jazz"
music will have been attained when the
opening bars from the orchestra are
heard. At enormous expense, a nine
piece orchestra has been obtained from
Sherman & Clay in San Francisco. It
is unique in the fact that there will be
no violins, but two banjos, two saxa
phones, the best "slidin" trombone this
side of New Orleans, a trumpet, traps,
and piano, which will furnish the finest
music heard on the campus within the
memory of the oldest "grad" here. The
orchestra will be concealed in the middle |
of the floor by huge banks of greens
and flowers. The music has been se
lected with greatest care, and the pieces
chosen are those which have been
judged to be the most popular on the
campus. Besides these popular choices,
three of the snappiest songs from the
Junior Opera will recall the dramatic
triumphs of the night before, and lend
a bit of zest and a touch of originality
to the program.
With a view to a futuristic color
scheme in mind, the prom committee,
composed of Sterling Pillsbury, '20,
chairman; James Bucklin, '20, Frank
Thomas, '20, Alice Faitoute, '20, Mar
garet Wood, '20, and Margaret Shedd,
'20, has conceived a highly elaborate de
corative plan, with blue, silver, and green
as the predominating colors. A false
cciling of purple, white, and green will
roof the merry dancers. The ceiling
will be made up entirely of three-foot
diamonds, every fifth one of which will
be half purple and half white, coming
to a ball in the center; the other squares
will be in solid green, giving the quaint
effect of all green and purple from one
angle, and all green and white from an
other.
Not content with this, the-committe is
further planning to almost cenceal the
walls from view, and to make of Encina
Gym a veritable paradise. Around the
walls will be thirteen booths, (for even
the hoodoo of the unluckly thirteen is
lifted for this one supreme evening.).
Each sorority will be represented, as well
as Roble, the cactus gardens, and Lagu
nita. Cozy seats may be found within
the shaded nooks, and it is hinted that
the charm, of the miniature cactus
garden, with the romance of the night,
and the odor of fragrant flowers round
about, may persuade many an ardent
wooer that he is in that famous spot
of tradition. The signs for the booths
are being made by Miss Bernice Taylor,
*21, and are extremely artistic.
Twelve tall piano lamps have been
especially imported from San Fran
cisco, and the subdued glow from under
their multi-colored, silken shades, will
furnish almost the only light for those
who trip the light fantastic.
Of all the promised features of the
prom, perhaps in novelty, elaborateness,
and originality, the programs should
come first. Ordered from Los Angeles,
no expense has lieen spared to make
them a lasting momento of the evening's
pleasure. Again following a little of
the futuristic, the programs are of dull
hlue and silver. The cover is of blue,
and is lined with exquisite white satin,
while the twelve insertions are of white
leather. The size of the leaves is two
and one-quarter inches by three and
one-quarter. All the engraving is done
In silver, and on the cover is a triangu
lar design of silver, bearing the inscrip
tion within it. "Junior Prom. 1920." The
program is laced together with a four
teen-inch leather thong of blue. On
each page there will be space for about
three dances, with the number of each
dance, the name of the selection to be
played, the partner for the dance, and
the name of the booth where the dancers
will meet.
Several blank pages have been left
for the owners to write in their re
membrances of the dance, to be read
with pleasure in after years. On the
first page will be the names of the
Junior Prom committee, and the last
page will be devoted to the nann-s of
the chaperons. Thirty-three prominent
members of the faculty have been asked
as chaperones. among them President
and Mrs. R L. Wilbur. Miss Harriet

Bradford, Captain and Mrs. S. M.
Parker, and Dean and Mrs. J. E. Mc-
Dowell.
When the last dance ends at 12
o'clock, dinner will be enjoyed around
the swimming pool. The committee has
refused to divulge what the nature of
the courses will he. hut it is assured
that there will he plenty of everything
that is good, served in a most attractive
manner. The sides of the pool will he
decorated with the same color scheme
as (he gym. Hidden lights of all colors
will unite in throwing a suffused glow
over the placid waters. Soft music
from the float drifting over the waters

of the pool, where the orchestra will

be played. Haunting melodies and
quaint songs will resound until the last
strains of "Home. Sweet Home" echo
away, and the "perfect" prom will have

a bit of zest and a touch of originality
to the program.
With a view to a futuristic color
scheme in mind, the prom committee,
composed of Sterling Pillsbury, '20,
chairman; James Bucklin, '20, Frank
Thomas, '20, Alice Faitoute, '20, Mar
garet Wood, '20, and Margaret Shedd,
'20, has conceived a highly elaborate de
corative plan, with blue, silver, and green
as the predominating colors. A false
cciling of purple, white, and green will
roof the merry dancers. The ceiling
will be made up entirely of three-foot
diamonds, every fifth one of which will
be half purple and half white, coming
to a ball in the center; the other squares
will be in solid green, giving the quaint
effect of all green and purple from one
angle, and all green and white from an
other.
Not content with this, the-committe is
further planning to almost cenceal the
walls from view, and to make of Encina
Gym a veritable paradise. Around the
walls will be thirteen booths, (for even
the hoodoo of the unluckly thirteen is
lifted for this one supreme evening.).
Each sorority will be represented, as well
as Roble, the cactus gardens, and Lagu
nita. Cozy seats may be found within
the shaded nooks, and it is hinted that
the charm, of the miniature cactus
garden, with the romance of the night,
and the odor of fragrant flowers round
about, may persuade many an ardent
wooer that he is in that famous spot
of tradition. The signs for the booths
are being made by Miss Bernice Taylor,
*21, and are extremely artistic.
Twelve tall piano lamps have been
especially imported from San Fran
cisco, and the subdued glow from under
their multi-colored, silken shades, will
furnish almost the only light for those
who trip the light fantastic.
Of all the promised features of the
prom, perhaps in novelty, elaborateness,
and originality, the programs should
come first. Ordered from Los Angeles,
no expense has lieen spared to make
them a lasting momento of the evening's
pleasure. Again following a little of
the futuristic, the programs are of dull
hlue and silver. The cover is of blue,
and is lined with exquisite white satin,
while the twelve insertions are of white
leather. The size of the leaves is two
and one-quarter inches by three and
one-quarter. All the engraving is done
In silver, and on the cover is a triangu
lar design of silver, bearing the inscrip
tion within it. "Junior Prom. 1920." The
program is laced together with a four
teen-inch leather thong of blue. On
each page there will be space for about
three dances, with the number of each
dance, the name of the selection to be
played, the partner for the dance, and
the name of the booth where the dancers
will meet.
Several blank pages have been left
for the owners to write in their re
membrances of the dance, to be read
with pleasure in after years. On the
first page will be the names of the
Junior Prom committee, and the last
page will be devoted to the nann-s of
the chaperons. Thirty-three prominent
members of the faculty have been asked
as chaperones. among them President
and Mrs. R L. Wilbur. Miss Harriet

Bradford, Captain and Mrs. S. M.
Parker, and Dean and Mrs. J. E. Mc-
Dowell.
When the last dance ends at 12
o'clock, dinner will be enjoyed around
the swimming pool. The committee has
refused to divulge what the nature of
the courses will he. hut it is assured
that there will he plenty of everything
that is good, served in a most attractive
manner. The sides of the pool will he

quaint songs will resound until the last
strains of "Home. Sweet Home" echo

COMING at the close of Junior Day,
a day replete with excitement, a
day featuring interclass rivalry in crew
and field sports and following the Junior
Opera, which has called forth the best
talent of the campus, the Junior Prom,
on Saturday evening, will bring to a
climax all the revelry and joy of Junior
Week; and if all is true that has been
said of it, it will pass into history as
the most elaborate, the best attended,
and the most nearly perfect of any prom
ever held.
When the music starts promptly at
8:30, one hundred and fifty couples will
sway in time to the strains of "Mary";
men, many of them clad for the first
time since the war in the luxury of full
dress, and women in the gala array
which the prom calls for, will form a
motley and beautiful rainbow color
scheme against the luxurious background
of ferns and palms. Perfection in "jazz"
music will have been attained when the
opening bars from the orchestra are
heard. At enormous expense, a nine
piece orchestra has been obtained from
Sherman & Clay in San Francisco. It
is unique in the fact that there will be
no violins, but two banjos, two saxa
phones, the best "slidin" trombone this
side of New Orleans, a trumpet, traps,
and piano, which will furnish the finest
music heard on the campus within the
memory of the oldest "grad" here. The
orchestra will be concealed in the middle |
of the floor by huge banks of greens
and flowers. The music has been se
lected with greatest care, and the pieces
chosen are those which have been
judged to be the most popular on the
campus. Besides these popular choices,
three of the snappiest songs from the
Junior Opera will recall the dramatic
triumphs of the night before, and lend
a bit of zest and a touch of originality

COMING at the close of Junior Day,
a day replete with excitement, a
day featuring interclass rivalry in crew
and field sports and following the Junior
Opera, which has called forth the best
talent of the campus, the Junior Prom,
on Saturday evening, will bring to a
climax all the revelry and joy of Junior
Week; and if all is true that has been
said of it, it will pass into history as
the most elaborate, the best attended,
and the most nearly perfect of any prom
ever held.
When the music starts promptly at
8:30, one hundred and fifty couples will
sway in time to the strains of "Mary";
men, many of them clad for the first
time since the war in the luxury of full
dress, and women in the gala array
which the prom calls for, will form a
motley and beautiful rainbow color
scheme against the luxurious background
of ferns and palms. Perfection in "jazz"
music will have been attained when the
opening bars from the orchestra are
heard. At enormous expense, a nine
piece orchestra has been obtained from
Sherman & Clay in San Francisco. It
is unique in the fact that there will be
no violins, but two banjos, two saxa
phones, the best "slidin" trombone this
side of New Orleans, a trumpet, traps,
and piano, which will furnish the finest
music heard on the campus within the
memory of the oldest "grad" here. The
orchestra will be concealed in the middle |
of the floor by huge banks of greens
and flowers. The music has been se
lected with greatest care, and the pieces
chosen are those which have been
judged to be the most popular on the
campus. Besides these popular choices,
three of the snappiest songs from the
Junior Opera will recall the dramatic
triumphs of the night before, and lend
a bit of zest and a touch of originality
to the program.
With a view to a futuristic color
scheme in mind, the prom committee,
composed of Sterling Pillsbury, '20,
chairman; James Bucklin, '20, Frank
Thomas, '20, Alice Faitoute, '20, Mar
garet Wood, '20, and Margaret Shedd,
'20, has conceived a highly elaborate de
corative plan, with blue, silver, and green
as the predominating colors. A false
cciling of purple, white, and green will
roof the merry dancers. The ceiling
will be made up entirely of three-foot
diamonds, every fifth one of which will
be half purple and half white, coming
to a ball in the center; the other squares
will be in solid green, giving the quaint
effect of all green and purple from one
angle, and all green and white from an
other.
Not content with this, the-committe is
further planning to almost cenceal the
walls from view, and to make of Encina
Gym a veritable paradise. Around the
walls will be thirteen booths, (for even
the hoodoo of the unluckly thirteen is
lifted for this one supreme evening.).
Each sorority will be represented, as well
as Roble, the cactus gardens, and Lagu
nita. Cozy seats may be found within
the shaded nooks, and it is hinted that
the charm, of the miniature cactus
garden, with the romance of the night,
and the odor of fragrant flowers round
about, may persuade many an ardent
wooer that he is in that famous spot
of tradition. The signs for the booths
are being made by Miss Bernice Taylor,
*21, and are extremely artistic.
Twelve tall piano lamps have been
especially imported from San Fran
cisco, and the subdued glow from under
their multi-colored, silken shades, will
furnish almost the only light for those
who trip the light fantastic.
