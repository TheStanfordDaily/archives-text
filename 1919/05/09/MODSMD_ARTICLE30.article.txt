# Junior Prom to Be Social Event of Year
## 
### Florence Hocking, '22 
COMING at the close of Junior Day,
a day replete with excitement, a
day featuring interclass rivalry in crew
and field sports and following the Junior
Opera, which has called forth the best
talent of the campus, the Junior Prom,
on Saturday evening, will bring to a
climax all the revelry and joy of Junior
Week; and if all is true that has been
said of it, it will pass into history as
the most elaborate, the best attended,
and the most nearly perfect of any prom
ever held.
When the music starts promptly at
8:30, one hundred and fifty couples will
sway in time to the strains of "Mary";
men, many of them clad for the first
time since the war in the luxury of full
dress, and women in the gala array
which the prom calls for, will form a
motley and beautiful rainbow color
scheme against the luxurious background
of ferns and palms. Perfection in "jazz"
music will have been attained when the
opening bars from the orchestra are
heard. At enormous expense, a nine
piece orchestra has been obtained from
Sherman & Clay in San Francisco. It
is unique in the fact that there will be
no violins, but two banjos, two saxa
phones, the best "slidin" trombone this
side of New Orleans, a trumpet, traps,
and piano, which will furnish the finest
music heard on the campus within the
memory of the oldest "grad" here. The
orchestra will be concealed in the middle |
of the floor by huge banks of greens
and flowers. The music has been se
lected with greatest care, and the pieces
chosen are those which have been
judged to be the most popular on the
campus. Besides these popular choices,
three of the snappiest songs from the
Junior Opera will recall the dramatic
triumphs of the night before, and lend
a bit of zest and a touch of originality
to the program.
With a view to a futuristic color
scheme in mind, the prom committee,
composed of Sterling Pillsbury, '20,
chairman; James Bucklin, '20, Frank
Thomas, '20, Alice Faitoute, '20, Mar
garet Wood, '20, and Margaret Shedd,
'20, has conceived a highly elaborate de
corative plan, with blue, silver, and green
as the predominating colors. A false
cciling of purple, white, and green will
roof the merry dancers. The ceiling
will be made up entirely of three-foot
diamonds, every fifth one of which will
be half purple and half white, coming
to a ball in the center; the other squares
will be in solid green, giving the quaint
effect of all green and purple from one
angle, and all green and white from an
other.
Not content with this, the-committe is
further planning to almost cenceal the
walls from view, and to make of Encina
Gym a veritable paradise. Around the
walls will be thirteen booths, (for even
the hoodoo of the unluckly thirteen is
lifted for this one supreme evening.).
Each sorority will be represented, as well
as Roble, the cactus gardens, and Lagu
nita. Cozy seats may be found within
the shaded nooks, and it is hinted that
the charm, of the miniature cactus
garden, with the romance of the night,
and the odor of fragrant flowers round
about, may persuade many an ardent
wooer that he is in that famous spot
of tradition. The signs for the booths
are being made by Miss Bernice Taylor,
*21, and are extremely artistic.
Twelve tall piano lamps have been
especially imported from San Fran
cisco, and the subdued glow from under
their multi-colored, silken shades, will
