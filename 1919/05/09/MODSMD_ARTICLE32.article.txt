# WOMEN'S FIELD DAY PROSPECTS PROMISING
## 
### Bernice Frankenheimer, '20 
THE end of the war has not benefited
only men's athletics, but also has
given a new impetus in women's sports
in the University, and Women's Field
Day, which is scheduled for Satur
day, May 17, is the outcome of the re
newed interest in athletics on the part
of Stanford women. Much of the time
which, during the war, was spent in
knittirig and making surgical dressings
is now left to devote to athletics, and
with the recognition of the importance
of outdoor sports in the life of college
women this year's Field Day bids fair
to be the most successful ever at
tempted.
Every branch of athletics will be rep
resented, including baseball, basketball,
tennis, field events, such as the discus
throw, shot-put and volley-hall, swim
ming and diving, crew races, canoe races
and canoe tilting.
Miss Ruth Garland, '20, has
chosen as Field Day captain, and under
her able leadership plans arc rapidly
being completed so that the events will
be run off on schedule time the day of
the meet. Some of the events will be
inter-class contests, while others offer
chanecs for individual stars to win glory
for themselves. Each woman is allowed
to enter all the events she desires, and
Captain Garland is anxious for as many
as possible to sign up for the events in
which they are interested.
Captains have been appointed for the
various sports and arc gathering to
gether every available contestant in their
respective sports. Miss Nellie Schulz,
'19, captain of this year's varsity team,
heads the basketball players, while Miss
Marie ITutton, '21, is baseball captain.
Miss Ruth Chandler, '19, member of the
women's varsity swimming team, is in
charge of swimming, Miss Elsie Leices
ter, *21, is tennis captain, and Miss
Emelie Anderson, '19, has charge of the

crew races and lake sports. The cap
tains are anxious to have as many girls
as possible sign for each event, and
will be on hand next week to coach
their respective teams.
Baseball, basketball, tennis and field

events will occupy tlic morning hours
from 9 until 12 on May 17. Owing to
the fact that there is not enough ma
terial for inter-class games, a single
team will be named and a basebalkgame
will be played with any outside team.

The visiting team has not yet been an
nounced. After the game played with
Mills College, Stanford should have no
trouble in winning, for the collection
of individual stars upon the baseball
team rivals that of the victorious men's
varsity. Marie Button, Myra Water
man, Bernice Taylor, Laura Getz, Mary
Therklesen, and Lena Tavernetti are
among the members of the team who
helped win against Mills.
The basketball game will be the inter
class final between the victors of the
freshman-sophomore and junior-senior
contests, which will be played off some
time during the week. Irene Bonnett
captains the senior, Doris Hyer the
junior, Marie Hutton the sophomore,
and Henrietta Ilower the freshman
team, and each captain is working hard
to pilot through a victorious five.
The tennis matches will be inter
class games, and many close contests
are expected. The sophomores are con
fident of victory with such players as
Myra Waterman, Dorothy Elfving,
Elsie Leicester, and Fredericka McGee
upon their team, but the other classes
are equally sure of their superiority.
At noon a basket luncheon will be
served iti the Women's Clubhouse, and
every Stanford woman is cordially in
vited to attend. Varsity letters and
class numerals will be awarded, and
new membefs of the "S" Society will
be announced at this time. In order
to be an "S" Society member, a woman
must win block "S's" in two sports and
be interested in a third. A large at
tendance is expected at the luncheon
hour, for this is one of the real "get
together" occasions of the year for
Stanford women.
At 1:30 p.m. interest will center in
the swimming contests which will be
held in the Roble pool. Captain Chan
dler announces that a large number of
