# Comments by Critic Favor Junior Opera

### Ellen M. Calhoun, '20 
"AI7E won't get home until morn-
VV ing" sang the cast at Junior
Opera rehearsal and the critic of this
bewildering production settled back in
her seat with a sigh. It meant the cold
gray hours for her too. There are al
ways compensations, however, and it
is too bad that the campus as a whole
must miss the bits of local color which
will vanish in mist in the sun when the
curtain parts for tonight's performance
of "Three of a Kind." Imagine Miss
Elizabeth McArthur, '20, as an elderly
woman. (She really has a dreadful
time living up to her part), coming
into the Assembly Hall, proper, from
the stage entrance and upon meeting
"Goodie" Knight, who has lost his usual
beautiful figure in an overdose of
avoirdupois, she exclaims, "You need
some in the shoulders!" and just as
you are trying to get the jist of this
deep remark which seems to refer to
the fact that Goodie's shoulders don't
match his waist measure's manly pro
portion, Coach Gordon Davis, '17,
blows an irate whistle and then yells,
"Committee!" He evidently has them
well trained, because immediately a few
individuals race down the aisle to the
orchestra's pit, where a number of
anxious faces attempt to settle the
question of "to be or not to be." There
is something of a mystery connected
with the Opera. Ray Hartman leads a
band of spies which will rival those of
"Biff! Bang!! Bulsheveek!!!"
Harry A. Wadsworth, the musical
genius of the campus, is quite distress
ing in the way he waves his hands.
There is something too expressive about
them. Whatever the debatable question
is, the outcome will not be known un
til the actual performance, so be pre
pared for a surprise of some kind.
Enough of mystery! This is the wo
men's edition and I cannot longer stay
away from the feminine weakness of
discussing fashions. The Junior Opera
costumes are bewildering creations from
the shops of Paris to the eccentric
abodes of the cubist. Fashions for
every season of the year; spring, sum
mer, winter, and fall, are all there and
they are so delightful and enticing In
their attractiveness that one hardly
knows which to choose. Miss Margaret
Wood's gown of pan-velvet, to even the
eye of the amateur, is at once distinctive
and unusually beautiful, on account of
the graceful lines of the drapes and its
air of naive simplicity.
But I am no more than just started
upon Miss Wood's gown, when "Peg"
Whealton takes a young girl to
her "mother" and Ray Hartman is
left to hold down the stage. Enter one
villain, followed by another villain! Sh!
YBu must know that one of them has
a gun in his pocket! Are they going
to attack Ray ? The strain is really too
much, when—grim reality once again—
a voice is heard from the back of the
Assembly Hall shouting, "Hank!" (all
the time you knew that his name must
be something like DePont!) "Hank,
you mustn't wear that hat! Ye Gods,
it's terrible!" in agonized tones just to
be followed by a cheerful apology, "It's
all right, wear it. You look German!"
and the romance is spoiled.
The choruses are bubbling over with
"pep" and "jazz". The pony chorus
rollicks over the stage and flirts with
the first row adorably. The costumes
are unique and daring in their color
combinations and the steps are new and
pleasing. Seldom have such alluring
; smiles been seen and the man who
