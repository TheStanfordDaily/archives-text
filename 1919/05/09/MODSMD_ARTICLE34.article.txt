## What is the Matter With Women's Athletics 
### 
II7HY are not more Stanford women out for athletics? Surely it is not because
of a lack of enthusiasm. Stanford men prove annually that a winning team
is riot fatally handicapped by a smaller or limited number to choose from.
As far as the women are concerned, it is generally felt that the root of the
evil lies in the system. According to the present ruling, gymnasium is compulsory
to all underclassmen. Yet no credit is given for any of the popular sports—crew,
baseball, tennis, fencing, basketball, and hockey. If a woman wishes to go out
for a team or compete in class sports, she must find the time and energy to do so
outside of her gym classes in addition to her studies. Even if she be enrolled
in a swimming class, as a gym requirement, the extra time spent in preparing
for a swimming event would not be counted toward her class work. Furthermore,
one cut from ner class is a flat condition, even if she won in the competition.
The result is that few women, particularly those of the underclasses, feel that
they can obtain the necessary time to devote to athletics. It may be argued
that the upperclass women have sufficient time, after disposing of their gym
requirement, but experience tcaches that unless a woman, or a man either,
tnakes a start during his first two years, he is apt to meet with discouragement
when he attempts athletics in his junior or senior years.
The system for the men is different. A man may sign up for track or
football in place of his gym work. The result is that there is an amount of
enthusiasm and spirit of competition entirely missing in the women's athletics.
Good health is after all fundamental. Of what use is an engineer's diploma
or a teacher's certificate if the owner has not the health to use his or her
knowledge. Good health and good work run parallel. Where should they be
cf more importance than in a university? More and more our foremost physicians
are urging outdoor exercises and condemning formal gymnastics. The public
schools throughout the country are forming their women's baseketball, baseball,
and tennis teams. Why then should Stanford University make it so difficult,
in fact well nigh impossible, for the average girl to enter any sport contests?
Rules that are over strict tend to convert the interest of the student into
discontent. The fact that one "cut" constitutes a condition, which cannot be
removed until the following quarter, is particularly unfortunate. How unreason
able to give a course, primarily to induce good health, and defeat your purpose
by having it condemned as a bore. Half the secret of health is a contented mind.
Ihe average Stanford woman will not be contented with her compulsory gym
as long as she might enjoy, under other circumstances, the opportunity afforded
her tn athletics.
The lack of trained instructors in the physical training department is another
drawback. Particularly since the war, with its vigorous training and work fcir
women, the need for experienced women athletic instructors has increased.
Competetion between rival schools and class teams should be encouraged. How
can this University expect to turn out women who can command positions in
physical culture lines unless there is a sufficiency'of instrutors here to train them?
I his lack has been especially noticeable during the last two years and was
probably due to war conditions. But now that we are swinging back to normal
again, there is no reason why the women's physical training department should
not be put on a par with that of the men.
The women are earnestly hoping that the defects in the present system
will be so remedied in the near future that next year the places for positions in
Field Day will be keenly contested, instead of canvassed for, as is the fact in
most instances.
We are anxious to place the reputation of women's athletics as high as that
of the Stanford men. All we need is the chance and the encouragement.

for a team or compete in class sports, she must find the time and energy to do so
outside of her gym classes in addition to her studies. Even if she be enrolled
in a swimming class, as a gym requirement, the extra time spent in preparing
for a swimming event would not be counted toward her class work. Furthermore,
one cut from ner class is a flat condition, even if she won in the competition.
The result is that few women, particularly those of the underclasses, feel that
they can obtain the necessary time to devote to athletics. It may be argued
that the upperclass women have sufficient time, after disposing of their gym
requirement, but experience tcaches that unless a woman, or a man either,
tnakes a start during his first two years, he is apt to meet with discouragement
when he attempts athletics in his junior or senior years.
The system for the men is different. A man may sign up for track or
football in place of his gym work. The result is that there is an amount of
enthusiasm and spirit of competition entirely missing in the women's athletics.
Good health is after all fundamental. Of what use is an engineer's diploma
or a teacher's certificate if the owner has not the health to use his or her
knowledge. Good health and good work run parallel. Where should they be
cf more importance than in a university? More and more our foremost physicians
are urging outdoor exercises and condemning formal gymnastics. The public
schools throughout the country are forming their women's baseketball, baseball,
and tennis teams. Why then should Stanford University make it so difficult,
in fact well nigh impossible, for the average girl to enter any sport contests?
Rules that are over strict tend to convert the interest of the student into
discontent. The fact that one "cut" constitutes a condition, which cannot be
removed until the following quarter, is particularly unfortunate. How unreason
able to give a course, primarily to induce good health, and defeat your purpose
by having it condemned as a bore. Half the secret of health is a contented mind.
Ihe average Stanford woman will not be contented with her compulsory gym
as long as she might enjoy, under other circumstances, the opportunity afforded
her tn athletics.
The lack of trained instructors in the physical training department is another
drawback. Particularly since the war, with its vigorous training and work fcir
women, the need for experienced women athletic instructors has increased.
Competetion between rival schools and class teams should be encouraged. How
can this University expect to turn out women who can command positions in
physical culture lines unless there is a sufficiency'of instrutors here to train them?
I his lack has been especially noticeable during the last two years and was
probably due to war conditions. But now that we are swinging back to normal
again, there is no reason why the women's physical training department should
not be put on a par with that of the men.
The women are earnestly hoping that the defects in the present system
will be so remedied in the near future that next year the places for positions in
Field Day will be keenly contested, instead of canvassed for, as is the fact in
most instances.
We are anxious to place the reputation of women's athletics as high as that
of the Stanford men. All we need is the chance and the encouragement.
II7HY are not more Stanford women out for athletics? Surely it is not because
of a lack of enthusiasm. Stanford men prove annually that a winning team
is riot fatally handicapped by a smaller or limited number to choose from.
As far as the women are concerned, it is generally felt that the root of the
evil lies in the system. According to the present ruling, gymnasium is compulsory
to all underclassmen. Yet no credit is given for any of the popular sports—crew,
baseball, tennis, fencing, basketball, and hockey. If a woman wishes to go out
for a team or compete in class sports, she must find the time and energy to do so
outside of her gym classes in addition to her studies. Even if she be enrolled
in a swimming class, as a gym requirement, the extra time spent in preparing
