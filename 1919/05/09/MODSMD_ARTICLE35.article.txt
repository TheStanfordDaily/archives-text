# ABOUT STANFORD

### Ruth Lakin, '19 
The class of '08, or "Naughty Eight,"
as it is better known, stands out in Stan
ford pages almost as prominently as
does that of '96, but for different
reasons.
The launching of naughty eight into
the world was in sharp contrast to its
active and joyous career. The songs
which were to have been sung were
never heard, the speeches never spoken
and the whole of senior week omitted.
Even the cheer and yell which sounded
through the deserted arcades when the
class plate was dedicated was but the
ghost of the lusty shout usually given
with such force and volume.
The gloom which settled over the
class and student body might be dated
from Thursday evening, March 12,
1908, when a parade was formed in pro
testation of the recent action taken by
the Student Affairs Committee tnÂ» hold
all houses and clubs responsible for in
toxication of any of their members.
The parade passed through the Library
with noisy demonstrations, coming to a
stop beside the case of the Memorial
Arch. Speeches were made and the
committee's report read and burned.
As a result, many seniors were ex
pelled, a number of juniors suspended
and additional hours given to the
sophomore and freshman members of
the parade. A storm of protest and
discussion swept the campus. On
Thursday, March 19, one of the most
remarkable student body meetings that
has ever b<*n held took place. The

following statement was sent to the
Student Affairs Committee:
We wish to condemn most strongly
the insults that were offered to any in
dividuals and to express our sincere
regrets that the same were offered.
"We wish to condemn as a breach
of university discipline the actions of
the men engaged in the parade in
invading the Library and Memorial
Court.
"These things were done without
malice or evil intent and arc absolutely
contrary to the sane sentiment of the
student body."
A second meeting was held on the
baseball diamond, March 26, when it
was announced that forty-one students
were to be suspended. Feeling ran
so high that many other students de
clared their intention of leaving the
University.
\\ hen graduation day came probably
only one-fourth of the class was pres
ent. the majority preferring to send
their names into the registrar's office.
The only senior function that was per
formed was that of laying the class
plate. 1 his was done without ceremony
on May 14. That night, however, a
group of some twenty men of the class
formed a loekstep parade and marched
around the inner quad to the newly
laid plate. The class yell was given, a
short speech was delivered by John
Rcilly, "flail. Stanford, Hail" was sung,
and the parade left the quad. Thus
ended the only function of senior week
in which the seniors of naught eight,
as a class, participated.
