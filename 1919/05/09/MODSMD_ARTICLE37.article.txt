# Old Junior Week Customs Are Revived
## 
### Margaret McCall, '21 
Junior Week has arrived again with
a capital A. It began yesterday morn
ing when an innovation of "Ruffs" in
gala attire made their appearance on
the campus. As I ventured down to
Quad, on the way from the post office,
it seemed at first glance that a box car
had been misdirected and landed on the
siding in back of the new library to
deposit there its cargo of members of
the ancient order of Knights of the
Road, and that they had ventured forth
onto the sacred precincts of our Quad.
Hut on further investigation 1 found
that 1 was indeed mistaken and that
they were just "Ruffs," rougher than
usual, it is true, and garbed in the
most characteristic costumes that they
could manage to get hold of, which was
only as it should be on this, their own
especial day of all the year.
But the "Ruffs" arc a courageous lot
and not only did they cook their break
fast on Engineering Corner but they
performed another unexpected and
herioc deed, as well. They came up to
Roble and gave a concert. That act 011
the part of a bashful "Ruff" was especi
ally commendable, since, under ordinary
circumstances, men venturing there
stand three deep outside the door.
But alas for the Junior "Ruff"! All
too soon must he get all cleaned up and
dressed up in a "monkey suit," in order
that he may escort the fair object of
his dreams to the prom and the opera.
The lucky "Ruff" who does not in
dulge in the gentle art of queening, may
still keep 011 his make-up and look for
ward to Saturday and Sunday. Tt is
then that the annual fashion show of
the Five Hundred will take place for
the especial benefit, as they think, of
1 lie non-queening masculine population
of the campus who will sit 011 the banks
of Lagunita and watch the fair ones
and the queeners pass in review to the
Lake Sports which will be held on Sat
urday morning at 10 o'clock. This year
the women as well as the men are to
take part in these sports, so I've been
told. There is to lie interclass swim
ming of all kinds, canoe racing and
tilting.
Saturday afternoon will afford a
chance to every one and his girl to get
more sunburned while they watch an
interclass soccer game that is sched
uled for 1:30 on the field. The usual
assortment of "Ruffs," non-"Ruffs,"
queeners and the five hundred are ex
pected to be present.
Sunday night will bring this week of
merrymaking to a fitting close. At 9
o'clock, which is shortly after sunset
since the days are getting longer and
the daylight saving system has gone
into effect, soft strains of music will be
heard on the shores of Lagunita. Short
ly afterward the sky will become a
background for the fireworks, which a
junior told me, are to be better than
any ever shown before, and which I
believe to be true for they do get better
each year. When the glow of the last
rocket fades the 1920 Junior Week will
have finished its course.
