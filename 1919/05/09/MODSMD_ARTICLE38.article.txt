# THE 						THING THAT MATTERS
## 
### Margery Bailey, '14 
HOW good is a university? In the long run, it is as good as its faculty
and its reputation for fine results in alumni; at any separate year or
college generation, it is as good as its freshman class. The name, the ac
complishment, the standards of the university really rest for four years with
the entering class. One may say, then, that in this narrower aspect, the real
point is how good is a freshman class? How can you measure the quality of
any university class by grades, by the number enrolled, by interest in
national or state affairs, by interest in student affairs, by the activities they
choose to engage in? All of these matters are divisions of the real idea, de
pendent 011 individual differences; the value of a freshman class to the uni
versity, the quality which means everything in the next four years, is, after
all, common sense—a sense of balance, a ■keen discrimination of values.
It is a pity, of course, that the freshman class at Stanford includes some
thoughtless and some careless members, who happen to make a majority,
perhaps. I hat doesn t matter. It is a good class, for there are to my certain
knowledge five (and ptaise be, probably more) men in the class who look
upon ,the university with a seriously critical eye. It is encouraging—three
would be cause for satisfaction; three serious minds out of one hundred and
fifty is a good average, these days.
\ou are probably shocked. How can freshman c riticism advance a uni
versity ? Railing against hard marks, objecting to heavy reading assign
ments, resenting sopohomore discipline, refusing to be live wires and get on
the boat, sneering at college customs in general! Freshman criticism! But
listen: I don t mean that sort ot thing at all. That is not criticism; it is
idle talk which the ordinary treslimau learns rapidly from the ordinary upper
classman. I mean CRITICISM, which implies a warm interest in the subject
discussed, and a thoughtful consideration of it, —in this case, ending in ad
verse comment. Yes, but how good can a university be, if the best thing
about a freshman class is its ability to sit hack and knock, instead of keep
ing still and boosting? Answer: Mighty good. There is nothing that cannot
be improved by just criticism. It is obvious that there is no hope for any
instituion based 011 human standards, which is composed entirely of sheep.
The earlier a man emerges from the sheep state of mind, the sooner he will
be of value to his college; for him to be already out of it when he enters
as a freshman! These five that I know expected great things of Stanford,
just as all matriculating students do; but t.liey were not swept away by the
hurry and excitement and the glamour and romance of the place—they main
tained their common-sense standards, and observed that in spite of all its
charm, in spite of all its fineness, there was something the matter with Stan
ford.
What is it? The alumni, the faculty, the thoughtful students all ask the
same question. They are not lacking in loyalty and appreciation; the thing
that is the matter is not a causue for dread, because there is nothing that
can injure or ruin the University. (As one alumnus said, "After all, these
buildings and the ideal which is Stanford, will be here, as fine as ever,

finer than we shall ever be, —a long time after we're dead.") But every once
in a while there comes that haunting sense that something is not quite right
that the people ol' Stanford are not measuring up to the promise and the
hope of those buildings and that ideal. What is it? The alumni say "It isn't
like old times —the Stanford spirit isn't so strong any more." The freshmen
say "I'm disappointed in Stanford. The Stanford men aren't the men I've
heard they were; things aren't as old Stanford men said they were." Another
spoke of the "Stanford spirit—which in the opinion of the writer is long since
dead." . . . What is it that is the matter with us? It isn't a positive error
in our ways; it's a lack of something.
I don't think that it is a lack of interest in football or chess or tennis
or leapfrog; it certainly is not a lack of interest in academic work, for there
are more people here this who are fully conscious of what they mean
to get from the University than for a long time past; it isn't a lack of democ
racy or the get-together spirit; it isnt' (as some strangers say) because the
boys wear "slovenly clothes" or (as elderly people say) because the girls
dress extravagantly. I thing Harry Peterson, who used to be at the Museum,
and who is writing the story of Stanford in the city papers now, has found
the thing that is lacking. We are getting a little cold—we are losing the
hearty quality that used to be the great characteristic of Stanford. Possibly
the war has made us all a little too anxious to be efficient and intensive
abolit everything. (How humorous a situation for the gods! To think that
we warred against a nation whose chief crime was rooted in the originally
laudable passion for efficient development!) Possibly the war has just
sobered us so that we have lost the faculty for tenderness or hearty gaiety;
perhaps we are just anxious to make up for lost time. At any rate, the good
brown cloisters and warm roofs seem more and more to he sheltering a gen
eration which cannot spare time to think about the old days and the old ways,
about the good people who were the father and mother of all Stanford people
—whose very name is our name! The silly old affectionate nickname for the
campus—the thing that makes our campus distinctive and personal and home
like —is seldom heard except among alumni any more. How many people
know and care where the estate is, or what the Haunted Ground is? This
whole campus, this whole University, the ideal and the promise and the
hope, sprang like an exquisite symbol of resurrection from that precious
square of earth. It is true that we are rather shut out from the estate now
that strangers have so strangely remodeled the house; but if you pass the
frowning signs and the unpleasant watchdogs and the tangled weeds where
the lawns used to be, you come to the seed-plot of the University. You can
if you care.
"Well, what is that to me? Who eares for the old thing?" Something
is the matter with Stanford! When we go away from her, are we going to
have only the sunny brown squares and the red roofs, and certain happy
hours in the hills, to remember? Those are fine things—but you don't realize
how fine unless you have known the whole tender romantic story that built
the Quad, which is dearer than the brown arches and 'warmer than the red
roofs, and sadder far than the necessity of leaving at the end of four golden
years. (You don't know how bad that is, until you are a senior in Senior
Week.) A personal story? —a little thing in comparison to the work of a

great university? Reflect: the universe is a large place, and the world doesn't
take up much space in it. The work of the great University is (seen at a
distance) infinitesimal. On the other hand, tenderness and sacrific and grat
itude ascend like incense to the stars. If other planets are inhabited, doubt-
they possess institutions of learning; certainly here on earth there are
Quantities of them. They all have traditions and memories and great names
attached to them; they have buildings perhaps finer than ours, and men who
are better stuudents and teachers and scholars. They all have the honorable
sense of duty to learning—they are all doing a great work. Not one of them
has a story like ours.
Dou you know what the Jewel Bookplate is? Do you know what that
entirely satisfactory Blashfield masterpiece means? Do you know why the
boys never smoke on the Quad? Little things—sentiment—of course. Who
denies it? Tt was a lack of wholesome sentiment that created the downfall
ot a great nation last year. Efficiency is a fine thing, like ambition. Like
ambition, too, it can overleap itself. "A few more honorable agreements can
not stand before the necessity of a people to expand." We censure that—yet
honor is a sentiment. There is nothing real or efficient, or lawful about it.
The nation or the institution or the family that forgets its holidays and its
anniversaries and its silly traditions and family jokes, or loses its reverence
for the old stories, the old people, the old house furniture —it is losing heart
iness and losing life, just as if the real blood were slowly ebbing away. Those
things are the pulse of a social organization, not statistics of results, set
down in decimals. The fineness of Stanford men has not come from grades
and honor points alone, nor from their association with the faculty or with
each other; it is the intangible and mysterious thing called the Stanford
spirit, or loyalty, or what you like—the locking of their hearts to this place
and the idea that made it —the invisible magnetic chain that binds them un
alterably to Stanford earth, which is Haunted Ground. Stanford men's names
have spread farther, they really are finer than other men of other colleges,
because (it is not to be said with pride, for it was no work of ours) Stanford
has th most, beautiful founding-story. It comes down to that. And we are
forgetting it.
Well, that is why Harry Peterson is spending valuable time in writing the
story of Stanford in the city papers; that is why men who read those papers
turn first and most eagerly (after peace news) to the Stanford story. That
is why the alumni are so interested in the project for a pageant of Stanford
history. Perhaps, if there is a graphic representation of certain parts of the
university story, given at the place where such a thing would mean most—
the site of the Memorial Arch—we may find what we lack. I think the fresh
men need it, not only for themselves, but for the four other classes that will
enter while they are here as sophomors, juniors, sniors. I think the upper
classmen need it. Perhaps if they had been able in this last four-year gener
ation to be here all the time, and teach the good traditions and stories as
they have always been taught, there would be no criticism of the under
classmen at present; but bigger work was on hand then. It is *ime to begin
again now. At least, that is why I'm interested in the pageant. If it suc
ceeds, it will be worth oven more than the year of work that has gone into it.
