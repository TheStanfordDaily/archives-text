# HOW LONG SHALL WARTIME RULES GOVERN WOMEN?
## 
### Jean Frickelton, '20 
THE last lunch counter has taken
down its coffee and doughnut sign
and left its one-time pie-laden shelves
empty; the photograph shops and
shooting galleries have moved to more
lucrative communities; even the lum
ber from the former buildings and
offices is being sold and carried away
—Camp Fremont is a memory, but
the war-time rules that fence in the
women of Stanford are as rigid and
foroeful as the day they were put
into effect.
While the war lasted all personal
feelings were eliminated and these
rules accepted at their protective face
value without emphatic dissatisfac
tion. but now they are needed much
less than France needs the American
soldiers who are being returned for
demobilization. These unnecessary
limitations hurt the pride of the
Stanford women whose keen sense of
honor and growing wisdom cry out for
the trust they have always proven
themselves capable of receiving, but
which, through seeming neglect, has
not been returned to them.
In all the present agitation for
world democracy Stanford women
should form their league of honor to
secure the freedom they used to enjoy
in the good old days.
There are few who would not rebel
at being compelled to wear a "flu"
mask after the epidemic had passed.
How much longer will the faculty play
the part of the obdurate health offi
cer?
