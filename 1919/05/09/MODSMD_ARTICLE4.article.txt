# BIG EVENT OF YEAR TAKES PLACE TODAY
## CAPT. DINKELSPEIL BETS RASHLY; DOPESTERS UNDECIDED 
### 
A wonderful thing has come into our
lives
Since Neil has come back here to
stay.
He jazzes us all, kidding us all
Till we kneel and adore as we pray.
\
The wonder to us is that no one can
guess
What a wonderful bluffer he is,
For he tells every girl,*that she makes
his heart whirl,
At queening he's proved he's a whiz!

We've got some men on the Daily
Staff,
'N' everything.
That write the heads like fools, and
laugh,
'N' everything.
The men all try to shirk;
When they hear Thrash they jump
to work
Like steamship foghorns, and like a
bass horn
He yells to Fendler, "Wrong again!"
We've got a Baby Boy, and a Mama's
Pet,
'N' everything,
That start to work and then forget,
• 'N' everything,
And if we ever have the chance,
We'll put them in a trance,
And dump them out among the cows
and geese,
N" everything.

With the big journalistic event of the
year already a present fact, Stanford
men on the team are expressing con
siderable fear as to the outcome of the
meet. Wit and ingenuity have played
as important a part in the battles as
weight and force and partiality here
tofore, and dopsters for the event pre
dict a victory for the team with the
former.
The big contest of this afternoon will
be one of the hardest fought events of
the season, rivalling in all features any
former scene staged on the local
grounds.
Members of the opposing team have
appeared upon the battle ground early
this morning and have been turning up
at frequent intervals all day. Each has
had a dope sheet and a pencil and has
been trying to get the opinions of those
who are holding the ground, as to the
possible running of the events. This is
a departure from all custom of former
contests and the referee has been com
pelled to penalize the men in every case.
As a last resort, he will give the victory
to the fairer opponents without further
competition.
Dinkelspiel, a sure winner in all events
that lie enters, and the captain of the

"Dink" owns a medal for track.
Which lie puts with the rest of the stack.
He ought to have one
For the work he has done
On the Quad, as well as for track.
But there's one that "Dink'' cannot win,
Too bad! For it's an excellent pin.
But the small Kappa Key-
Is not for him, do you see?
Though he loves any girl with that pin.
The staff women feel very hurt
When he's harsh with them, brusque and
so curt,
For they can't help but know
He would change his words so
If tliev all wore a kev and would flirt.


team, has no confidence in the victory
of his men which he has been coaching
for the past year. Instead he is betting
heavy money on those who are against
him, and is fearful that they will score
an easy victory. He did show more
discretion as captain, by tint lingering
at the enemy's training table, than did
several members of his team who were
guilty of this offense. Nevertheless, the
fair opponents suspect Dinkelspiel of
originating 4 spy system as a last resort
to victory.
Six men from the staff were seen
where they shouldn't have been. Some
had good alibis but Fendler, Kenney and
Hollingsworth will be tried before court
martial in the near future. The enorm
ity of the plot was astounding, in- 1
volving many prominent names. Per
haps the most stratling revelation came
with the brazen entrance of the Presi
dent of the Junior Class, followed by
the Dean of Men. All the members of
the "fair" team are quite at loss as to
how to understand the actions of such
prominent men 011 the campus. Evidence
has been brought in against Leiser,
Crowe, and Chamberlain, but definite
action has not as yet been taken in their
cases.
The discovery of so dastardly a plot,
would indicate that competition at the
meet was very keen. (Even as this is
written, Mr. Pillsbury enters, and
Keeder and Rhodes look through the
window. All three are sure of a death
sentence.). The relay race was the de
ciding event of the meet. The fair
sex were seriously handicapped on ac
count of the failure of the opponents
to send the usual sustenance of a box
of candy. (Floyd McElroy has just
entered the list of the convicted and
an unknown is being traced.).
All judges declared the competition
keen but that the fair victors were more
than deserving of the honors won.
A wonderful thing has come into our
lives
Since Neil has come back here to

He jazzes us all, kidding us all
Till we kneel and adore as we pray.

him, and is fearful that they will score
an easy victory. He did show more
discretion as captain, by tint lingering
at the enemy's training table, than did
several members of his team who were
guilty of this offense. Nevertheless, the
fair opponents suspect Dinkelspiel of
originating 4 spy system as a last resort
to victory.
Six men from the staff were seen
where they shouldn't have been. Some
had good alibis but Fendler, Kenney and
Hollingsworth will be tried before court
martial in the near future. The enorm
ity of the plot was astounding, in- 1
volving many prominent names. Per
haps the most stratling revelation came
with the brazen entrance of the Presi
dent of the Junior Class, followed by
the Dean of Men. All the members of
the "fair" team are quite at loss as to
how to understand the actions of such
prominent men 011 the campus. Evidence
has been brought in against Leiser,
Crowe, and Chamberlain, but definite
action has not as yet been taken in their
cases.
The discovery of so dastardly a plot,
would indicate that competition at the
meet was very keen. (Even as this is
written, Mr. Pillsbury enters, and
Keeder and Rhodes look through the
window. All three are sure of a death
sentence.). The relay race was the de
ciding event of the meet. The fair
sex were seriously handicapped on ac
count of the failure of the opponents
to send the usual sustenance of a box
of candy. (Floyd McElroy has just
entered the list of the convicted and
an unknown is being traced.).
All judges declared the competition
keen but that the fair victors were more
than deserving of the honors won.
A wonderful thing has come into our
lives
Since Neil has come back here to
stay.
He jazzes us all, kidding us all
Till we kneel and adore as we pray.
\
The wonder to us is that no one can
guess
What a wonderful bluffer he is,
For he tells every girl,*that she makes
his heart whirl,
At queening he's proved he's a whiz!

We've got some men on the Daily
Staff,
'N' everything.
That write the heads like fools, and
laugh,
'N' everything.
The men all try to shirk;
When they hear Thrash they jump
to work
Like steamship foghorns, and like a
bass horn
He yells to Fendler, "Wrong again!"
We've got a Baby Boy, and a Mama's
Pet,
'N' everything,
That start to work and then forget,
• 'N' everything,
And if we ever have the chance,
We'll put them in a trance,
And dump them out among the cows
and geese,
N" everything.

With the big journalistic event of the
year already a present fact, Stanford
men on the team are expressing con
siderable fear as to the outcome of the
meet. Wit and ingenuity have played
as important a part in the battles as
weight and force and partiality here
tofore, and dopsters for the event pre
dict a victory for the team with the
former.
The big contest of this afternoon will
be one of the hardest fought events of
the season, rivalling in all features any
former scene staged on the local
grounds.
Members of the opposing team have
appeared upon the battle ground early
this morning and have been turning up
at frequent intervals all day. Each has
had a dope sheet and a pencil and has
been trying to get the opinions of those
who are holding the ground, as to the
possible running of the events. This is
a departure from all custom of former
contests and the referee has been com
pelled to penalize the men in every case.
As a last resort, he will give the victory
to the fairer opponents without further
competition.

"Dink" owns a medal for track.
Which lie puts with the rest of the stack.
He ought to have one
For the work he has done
On the Quad, as well as for track.
But there's one that "Dink'' cannot win,
Too bad! For it's an excellent pin.
But the small Kappa Key-
Is not for him, do you see?
Though he loves any girl with that pin.
The staff women feel very hurt
When he's harsh with them, brusque and
so curt,
For they can't help but know
He would change his words so
If tliev all wore a kev and would flirt.
