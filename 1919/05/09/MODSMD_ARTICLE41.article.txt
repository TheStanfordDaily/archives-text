# Poor Children Get Vacation at Stanford
## 
### Thelma Carlisle, '20 
AT last, the dream of the Stanford
Clinic has been realized, and a con
valescent home for children has been
established on the campus. The pld
Acacia house has been converted into a
child's paradise, where despondent
little souls from the great city's streets
may come to stay for two long weeks
of nothing but rest and play.
From out of the dust and the smoke
they come into the fresh country air,
where the sight of "green grass," as the
children call it. greets them, instead of
the accustomed scene of paved streets
and tall buildings. Here the children
play on the lawn, build block houses in
the play-room, or go for automobile
rides. If there ever is a moment of
home-sickness, just at night when the
lights go out, it is soon forgotten in a
surge of happy dreams of the wonder
ful people who have made their mo
ment of vacation possible.
The greatest reward that these people,
the faculty, alumni, and friends of the
University, can derive, is just to visit
the home and see the joy that their
donations have brought to the children.
The college women have also shared in
supporting the home, for it was they
who washed the windows and made the
rooms cheery for the first group of
visitors, who arrived Monday.
Six little girls, the' youngest four, and
the oldest eleven, were the first ones to
be sent to the campus from the Stanford
Clinic in San Francisco. Lena Ghiorso.
a little Italian, is on crutches and re
covering from tuberculosis. Her five
little comrades have had the influenza
and are suffering from colds, due to a
general run-down condition. All have
been sent here to gain weight and
strength. Their names, nationalities
and ages are: Lena Ghiorso, Italian, 11;
Charlotte Ellis, Austrian, 6; Helen Des
siorime, French. 4; Louise Franceschne,
Italian, 11 ; Luida Douglass, American,
5; Alma Claussen, Irish. 7 years.
The children all love company, and
visitors are welcome to play with the
girls or take them walking. None have
yet seen the lake or campus. Miss Vaal
Stark. '17, who is in charge of the home,
says that the college women are wel
come to aid her in bathing and putting
the children to bed, at 7:30.
Several boys on crutches are expect
ed the last of this week, and in two
months a new group of children will
be sent.
