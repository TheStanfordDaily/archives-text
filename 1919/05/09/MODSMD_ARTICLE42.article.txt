# FOOTBALL SITUATION WITH BRUINS SHOULD BE SETTLED BY FAIR WOMAN
## 
### Eleanor Allen, '20 
FOR a long time athletics at Stanford have been run without the slightest
aid from the women. At length, however, the men are in a mess, showing
once more that women are a necessary, if expensive, by-product of a uni
versity. (The theorem is proved on Friday and Satuurday and Sunday nights
of each week.)
Spring football practice has brouught out all the available material for
next year's team. Rain does the same thing with the worms. Legs and arms
and an occasional body with one or two heads thrown in lope down the iield
after a dummy opponent. The legs and arms are excellent material. They
promise a go-gettem team that will mop out the 64-0 handover of last year.
Caughey and Tausey and Curtis,
Billman and Lilly and Betts,
Holt and Patrick and Schlaudemann,
Will tell where to set.
I repeat, the team is fine. Evans will whip them into shape and curse
them (with permission of codncil) after they are there, just to hold them.
Nobody's worried about the team. It's the dummy opponent we're troubled
about. The men are interested in playing with him these first two days, but
what's going to happen when the dummy ceases to be interesting? After all,
dummies are nothing but dummies, no matter how full they are. Sooner or
later the team has to play real men. Otherwise one by one the men will
drift away, and there will be no use for the dummy.
That's how we stand in the mess with California, previously mentioned
in soft tones. We've been playing with dummies for a number of years—
for so long that we've lost our power and the team and the bleachers have
lost interest and have one by one drifted away.
We're past that stage now. We're through playing with a dummy that
never could become a real opponent. We're ready to play with the real
thing, and just as we are ready to attack an honest-to-gosh team, out run
two little boys from the side lines with a fight of their own that they want to
stage as the chief show.
In a case like that, do tli° little fellows win? Hardly! The mob comes
out ahead every time and the little youngsters leave the field by request.
The fight is, however, between two men, and men must be treated some
what differently than small boys. Here is where the women enter into the
mess and clean it up. The plan which has been developed in the fevered
brain of an unduly troubled co-ed provides for the following actors: An
official representative for California; one of the fairest of the fair "500"; and
enthusiastic supporters 011 both sides.
The problem now is this: Given the curved road from the Palm Drive
to the Cactus Garden, with two uncorrelated figures tangent to it, moving
at a uniform speed in parallel paths.
To prove: That the figures will arrive at the given point to be known
as closer relations, before approaching the end of the road which is of known
length.
Proof: Construct a similar case at a different time with the known fig
ures, V. T. and N. P. We already know by a previous problem that the point
C. R. (closer relations) has been reached by these two figures before ap
proaching the end of the road. Substituting for the known figure, V. T.: the
similar figure, X (Axiom. All daughters of Eve are similar and therefore
may be substituted one for another in any case where they occur), and for
figure N. P. the similar figure. (Corollary of above axiom for sons of Adam.)
We now have:
Conclusion: The given figures approaching C. R. before the end of the
road. Q. E. D.
Corollary: When the figures stand for the known universities, Stanford
and California, the result will be ihe same as above, the given point being
F. B. R. (Foot Ball Relations).
The reason for choosing a woman for thus healing up the sore b ween
the two universities is thus very apparent. For another reason, though, she
should be the negotiator. Should there be any reluctance on the part of the
California figure, persuasion will have to be resorted to, which above all else
requires ingenuity. Women angels will accomplish what fool men fear to
attempt and the gentle art of argument will work wonders where mere brute
force is of 110 avail, for a woman's argument is like nothing else—aye, like
nothing else on earth.
"Expenses," "extravagance," "surplus cash" are magic words to the mind
of the apple-carrier, and she can think of a hundred reasons against the first
and for the latter. These enter into our cries for C. R. (It sounds like the
deadly T. N. T.) and woman, the chief exponent of the modern movement
for higher wages, reduction of costs, and more spending money, has a high
batting average in the fight. She is. in fact, qualified for umpire.
The discussion so far has been perfectly serious, but the situation does
have its ludicrous sides. The argument as advanced last week in the Daily
Palo Alto saying that we have crawled for a little bit, so why not crawl some
more, is entirely out of date. In the first place the crawl is not done any
more. It's antiquated, out of date, passee. For that reason alone we should
not be compelled to crawl onto nor off of the Berkeley field. Such an action
\frould classify Stanford among the schools that have chaperoning rules and
regulations against the latest dances.
Could we, however, shimmee out into public gaze between the goal posts,
there would be no occasion for feeling that Stanford had degraded herself
nor done anything but the ultra-fashionable thing in so coming to a game at
last with California. The dancing we do lives after us, the crawling is oft
interred with our bones. So let it be with football. Much as has been said
against the dance, it must be admitted that it is the one way of winning to
amicable relations the otherwise hostile factions.
Furthermore, it is evident that the affair of the letters is mare fallacy
since it is a well known fact that telephones exist with connections between
Berkeley and Stanford. The charge is small, and special rates are made for
particularly long conversations. The whole thing sounds very suspicious to
the majority of the campus, for it would seem that the two did not want to
get together, and that is a plain lie. Some city reporter must have got hold
-of the wrong dope.
