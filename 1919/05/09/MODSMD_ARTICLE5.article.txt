# FINAL ARRANGEMENTS ANNOUNCED FOR PROM
## 
### 
Owing to the fact that this year the
Junior Prom comes on a Saturday night
instead of on a Friday night, as it has
in the past, the music for the first dance
will start promptly at 8:30. Contrary to
previous announcement, there will be no
intermission between the eighth and
ninth dances. Instead, the program will
be run straight through in order that
the dancing may stop promptly at mid
night.
After the Prom all are to adjourn to
the swimming pool where dinner will
be served. Just what the dinner is to
consist of is somewhat of a mystery,
but it is said that the eats will be good,
and that there will be an abundance of
them.
The programs for the Prom arc to
be had at the Bookstore any time to
day, having just arrived from the south
The committee wishes once more to
impress upon those who are to attend
the Prom that flowers and taxis are
taboo. They also wish to remind all the
men in the Junior Class that their ser
vices are needed on Saturday to help
put the Gym ir. shape for the "great
event."
