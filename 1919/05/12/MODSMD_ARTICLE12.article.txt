# TRYOUTS FOR SENIOR FARCE ARE ANNOUNCED
## GORDON DAVIS TO COACH Feature of Former Senior Weeks to Return This Year 
### 
OKNIOR WEEK this year will be
featured by the return of the Senior
Farce, according to an announcement
made today by M. L. Levy, chairman
of the Senior Farce committee. A date
has already been set for the preliminary
rehearsals and the farce to be pro
duced will be settled on early this week
by the committee.
Rehearsals for the Senior Farce will
be held next Thursday afternoon from
2 to 6 in the Assembly Hall. As is the
custom with this annual production,
everyone in college is eligible to appear
in it. Consequently, all the amateur
Thespians of the campus are urged to
come out next Thursday for the pre
liminary try-outs.
Gordon Davis, '18, who produced this
year's Junior Opera, and who is the
author of several successful plays that
have been presented on the professional
stage, has consented to coach the Senior
Farce. This fact goes far towards in
suring the success ot rtie farce, accord
ing to the committee, for Davis' ability
as a coach was given an excellent test
in the opera last Friday. His thorough
acquaintance with campus theatrical con
ditions makes him an exceptionally
valuable man in this position.
The Senior Farce is always the open
ing event of Senior Week. As this
year's Senior Week is to be coupled with
the big alumni homecoming and post
war reunion, especial efforts will be put
forth in the production of the farce.
Senior Week and Commencement this
year will come during the week of June
15. The exact date for the Senior
Farce has not been set as yet.
