# Dr. Swigart on Foreign Commerce
## Industrial and Foreign Educational Problems Discussed 
### 
Commercial engineering and Ameri
can foreign commerce were discussed
this morning by Dr. Glen L. Swigart
of Washington, D. C., at an engineer
ing and economics assembly in the Lit
tle Theater this morning. Dr, Swigart
laid special emphasis on the relation
of these subjects to modern industrial
education.
The lecturer pointed out the neces
sity of removing all barriers to trade,
and particularly all obstacles in the way
of a better foreign trade for the United
States, for this country, he showed,
needs foreign commerce at this time
as never before .
Dr. Swigart has recently spent much
time speaking in business circles
throughout the country on the needs
of better education in the fields of for
eign industrial commerce. He now
shows that this education should be ap
plied in colleges as well as elsewhere.
He cited the great opportunity for the
properly informed industrial engineer in
overseas nations at this time, and
demonstrated that the great universities
should not neglect foreign commercial
fields when making out technical and
engineering curriculums.
Dr. Swigart was recently appointed
head of the national committee to in
vestigate the subject of "Foreign Serv
ice for the United States." During the
war, ho said, business interest and the
government did not co-operate to a satis
factory degree, largely because the gov
ernment has ignored business. Here
after the policy is to be the contrary
of this.
With reference to labor the speaker
urged the student of today to become
familiar with the working man and his
present problems. The task of modern
democracy, he said, is to educate pupils
to relate what they learn to what must
be done in the future, to accomplish
which purpose vocational training is in
dispensible, aiding the individual in more
efficient service, and increasing the pro
ductivity of the nation.
