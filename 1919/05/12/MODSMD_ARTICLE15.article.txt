# WHAT ABOUT DRAMATICS?
## 
### 
the Junior Opera successfully concluded and the
Senior Farce tryouts already announced, the question
MWAi opportunely presents itself: what about Stanford dramatics? Are
they of the caliber that fills all the show needs of the college
world and are they expressive completely of what dramatics at Stanford
should be? The Junior Opera was eminently successful; of that there can be
no doubt expressed by those who witnessed it. There can be further no doubt
but that Junior Operas are essential parts of college dramatics. The question
is to find what should be woven around the opera to complete the Thespian
schedule.
The sophomore production is one of the dramatic cycles in the Stanford
dramatic year. Good, clean, laughable comedy always meets with success.
The Senior Farce as the concluding presentation of graduating class is usu
ally a good finished bit of light comedy work. Ilam's Head is an additional
and spasmodic contributor to the stage attractions of the university life.
There seems to be an overabundance of comedy role in college dramatics.
This is easily explainable and is as it should be up to the point where other
phases of dramatics are neglected. With four presentations of absolutely
light character, with no change towards comething serious, there is undoubt
edly a phase neglected. The serious element in dramatics would most cer
tainly place dramatics upon a higher scale. A repetition of some such ele
mentally successful production as "Justice," given two years ago by Sword
and Sandals society, does more to justify the existence of dramatics than even
some very enjoyable and well attended comedy.
There is a tendency to forget that dramatics exist not alone for the com
plete enjoyment of large audiences, but for the developmnt of talent and for
the presentation of those parts of college life known both as serious and
humorous. Let us not forget one phase at the expense of the other.
