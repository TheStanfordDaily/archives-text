# PRESSMEN LABOR OVERTIME ON NEW JUNIOR YEAR-BOOK
## 
### 
Late hours and little sleep character
izes the lives of the workmen of the
Stanford University Press since they
began on the task of putting out the
1920 Quad a few days ago. In publish
ing the yearbook they have been re
quired to work overtime each night,
on Saturdays, an don Sundays, due
largely to the large size of the book and
to the later college activities which are
all to be included in the pages of the
Quad.
Trouble is also experienced in print
ing the pages, due to the new designs
and special double borders of the new
junior book. Much difficulty has been
encountered because of these special i
borders, but the editor now states that
overtime work on the part of both cer
tain staff members ahd pressmen has
overcome most of the obstacles. AVith
continued work on the part of these

persons, he states, the book should be
completed on time.
Tt was found that there is a sufficient
amount of paper on hand to publish 1000
copies of the yearbook instead of 1050 as
planned.
The management is taking no advance
orders for the yearbook this quarter
as has previously been done, but will
dispose of surplus copies at the book
store.
