# "Crucified Russia" Subject of Lecture
## Mr. Baumgardt, Lecturer and Traveler, Secured to Speak Tuesday 
### 
"Crucified Russia" will be the subject
of the regular Tuesday evening program
in the Little Theater. The lecture will
he illustrated with a series of slides,
portraying the Russia itself of yester
day and today, which promises to be
very interesting.
Mrs. B. R. Baungardt who has been
secured to deliver the talk, has been
an extensive traveler and explorer, and
has a personal knowledge of conditions
in Russia. He has a private astron
omic observatory, and is a member of
numerous clubs and societies, besides
being a staff lecturer for the Brook
lyn Institute, the American Institute,
National Geographic Society, and Co
lumbia University.
Mr. Baumgardt will tell of the con
ditions in old Russia, the overthrow
of the Csars, and the consequent rise
of the Bolsheviki. There is, however,
the element of freedom and liberty
present, and for the first time in the
history the people are allowed religious
freedom and are permitted to think.
Conditions in Russia are poorly
understood at this time throughout
America, and Mr. Baumgardt is en
deavoring to bring home to the people
the necessity for patience with that
stricken country.
The lecture will begin promptly at
7:30 o'clock.
