# Forced Postponement Of Neptune Beach Meet
## 
### 
At a mectig of the swimming team
held last Saturday Henry Mills, '21, was
elected captain for next year. Mills has
heen probably the most consistent win
ner on the team. He is a member of
Alpha Sigma Phi.
Owing to the fact that the University
of California, which had charge of the
making of arrangements for the Coast
Swimming Championship to have been
held at Neptune Beach last Saturday,
was unable to complete negotiations with
several universities who were to have
completed, the meet was called off. This
was to have been the close dip of th 6
season for the varsity .
