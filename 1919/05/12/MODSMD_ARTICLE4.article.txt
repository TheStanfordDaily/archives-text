# Fire Works Display Closes Successful 1920 Junior Week
## 
### 
A gloriously successful Junior Week
has passed from the realms of reality,
and its memories have been stored up
in the minds of every Stanford student
who was fortunate enough to be on the
campus during the few days when the
juniors held sway. Never was Junior
Week more happily spent, and never was
more effort expended to make it a week
full of thrilling little events. The class
of '20 feels that its efforts have been
more than rewarded.
Little remains to be said about the
Junior Opera that has not already been
said. The committee, and campus
opinion, in general has agreed that it
was a highly successful opera, and that
it more than rivals all others for a
number of years back. As for the prom,
there is still much room for discussion,
for everything came as a surprise, and
little was actually known before hand.
Probably the most satisfying feature
of the dance was the fact that the
music was excellent, and all the pieces
of the most tuneful melody. The Gym
nasium was transformed into a veritable
bower of purple and white decorations,
and the concealed lights from the ceil
ing cast a soft glow over the room,
making it delightful for the dancers.
Refreshments of ice cream, salad, cakes,
and coffee were served during the inter
mission.
Lake sports Saturday morning may
have been disappointing to many, be
cause the events Were not run off ex
actly on schedule, but once the canoes
in the tilting contests were tipped over,
the men and women on the banks of
the lake became enthusiastic. The div
ing stunts were very good, and the crew
events, which took up most of the time,
afforded much interest to the spectators.
Sky rockets were all the rage last
night, as they shot up from the south
â€¢ide of Lagunita, and burst over the
water, lighting up the surrounding
woodland. A large crowd sat along the
banks of the lake, and watched each
lasting star as it dropped from a great
height, and then sizzled and sputtered
as it struck the water. A fountain of
shining lights also formed a pretty
'ight. but the most picturesque of all
was the illuminated "20" that suddenly
stood out full from the west side of the
lake and remainded all spectators that
i< was the 1920 class who was respons
ible for this year's events.
