# SENIOR BALL WILL BE HELD AT HOTEL VENDOME, SAN JOSE
## 
### 
After considerable discussion, action
was taken Friday, permitting the Senior
Rail to he held off of the campus, sub
ject to certain conditions. As it has
always been the custom in the past, to
hold the Senior Ball off of the campus,
the committee was particularly anxious
that the custom should be retained. Ac
cording to the present announcement,
however, no motoring will be allowed.
Electric cars will be chartered at the
Hotel Vendome. Several meetings of
the committee have already been held,
and every effort is being made to
feature novel ideas both in programs
and in the rest of the entertainment.
