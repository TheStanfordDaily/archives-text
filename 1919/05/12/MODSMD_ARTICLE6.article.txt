# "THREE OF A KIND" EXCELS IN MUSIC, PLOT AND DANCING
## BEST OPERA FOR YEARS Margaret Wood, Whealton Goodâ€”Dorothy Johnston Adds Life to Play 
### Ruth Lakin, '19 
final curtain of "Three of a
Kind" dismissed one of the largest
and most enthusiastic of Junior Opera
audiences. Without a doubt Friday
evening marked the high-water point in
the week-end of the festivities of the
class of 1920, while the opera itself may
he placed in line with the best of Stan
ford musical productions.
It is seldom that the combination of
plot, lines and music are sufficiently
good in themselves to satisfy, but such
was the case in"Three of a Kind."
Add to this a splendidly trained cast
and novel color effects, and it is not
strange that "campus folks" are pleased.
Miss Margaret Wood, '20, in the role
of Marjorie Rogers, the beautiful so
ciety girl, successfully took a part in
which there was little acting and no
songs, carrying it "over" by charm and
grace alone. Her first entrance to the
"Toast Song" was extremely artistic
and reflects much credit to the coach,
Gordon Davis.
Miss Dorothy Johnson, '21, contributed
greatly to the life of the opera as Jill
Abbott, the saucy farmerette. Her vi
vacity and dancing were an attraction in
themselves and were only equaled in
"pep" by the pony chorus. Her songs,
sustained by this chorus, made some
real hits. To Miss Jean Long, '13, may
be given the credit for the number ot
original and pleasing dance steps.
Grace Coleman, '21, carried the role
of the fascinating vampire very at-
tractively. Her work in the vampire
was gracefully and commendably exe
cuted.
R. G. Whealton, '20. needs no intro
duction to a Stanford audience. As
Jack Abbot lie played the' part of the
here with his usual ease and debonair
manner. The most outstanding male
role was taken by Lester Leib, '22 ,as
Jacques, Marquis d'Auberine. He was
genuine and natural, and there was a
freshness and novelty about his acting,
savoring of the professional, which
pleased.
The comedian role, Jack Sprott, was
taken by G. J. Knight. '19. Although
the part was hackneyed and does not
stand out with any distinctness. Knight
was able to provoke the customary
laugh.
The success of "Three of a Kind" was
due in fact to the commendable work
of the principals, but was consistently
upheld by the other members of the
cast. Perhaps the unfavorable criticism
centers about the villain element por
trayed by Raymond Martman, '20,
Lowell W. Gerson, '22, and Fred North
rup, '21, but after all this runs true to
form of most light operas. .
Great credit and appreciative thanks
arc due Miss Kirby M. Ingoldsby, '20,
authoress, and Harry Wadsworth, '20,
lyric writer, whose combined efforts
made possible "Three of a Kind." The
catchy airs, well trained choruses, and
successful rendering of the leads sets a
standard for future Junior Operas.
