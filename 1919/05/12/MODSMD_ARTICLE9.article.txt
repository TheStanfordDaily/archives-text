# Foot-Weary Geologists Plead for Return of Their Stolen Property
## 
### 
A heart-rending plea has come to our
ears from the weary waiters who were
wont to languish at their ease in the
parquet circle on Geology corner, watch
ing the parade wend its happy way from
Roble to the Quad. All day have the
deeply wronged geologists been forced
to weigh heavy on burning corns and
to grind away shoe leather pacing the
area where formerly was laid out for
them a cool and restful stretch of green
bench. Some intruding desperado from
foreign spheres has spirited away the
handsome antique geology bench, to
grace the domains of his own clan. A
brave and daring venturer from the
tribe of rightful owners made bold to
seek ' the property, and at length sited
far to the west his treasure, defiled with
a motly cargo of the hated, husky clan
of engineers, all jubilant in the discovery
of the new gallery fiom which the view
of the Row parade ground is perfect,
and from where the style revue may be
scrutinized at length and yet without
advantage to the chiropodist.
But the rock-dissectors are heart-sore
and foot-sore. Pride almost forbids
them to seek outside aid, but cognizant
of the power of Public Opinion, and of
their own inferior numbers, they must
needs beg the assistance of the public
in returning their property to its right
ful place, before they are overcome by
fatigue.
