## BACKS PRACTICE TODAY Series of Twenty-minute Games Will Be Run Off Next Week 
### 
SPRING football is now singing along
in great shape and over 100 men
have been showing up for practice this
week, according to Coach Bob Evans.
Last night the line-men worked out, aud
this afternoon the backs had the field to
themselves. Tomorrow all men are
asked to report on the field. Teams
will be made up and signal practice
held. These teams will then have signal
practice for the rest of the week, play
ing a series of short games. The
coach lias announced that in order to
get a chance to play, men will have to
be on the field tomorrow afternoon.
According to the divisions planned,
there will lie about eight teams chosen
tomorrow. Each of these teams will
then have about 3 or four extra men.
As soon as one or two rudimentary
plays can be learned by each team, a
series of twenty-minute games will be
in order.
By this series of games all men who
show up well can be picked to form the
nucleus of the squad for next fall.
Each man will get a chance to show
just what he can do, and each team will
have enough plays to try out the pass
ing, kicking and running ability of each
member.
A stiff practice in blocking and break
ing through in both offence and defense
was the program for yesterday. Some
good men have shown up as the result
of last night's work-out. Among them
are Curtice, Lane. Drake, Coonse, Persh
ing. Pellett, Sentus, Mills, Slauderman.
These men had all had experience in
the line, while Tauzer, Freeman, Adams
and Righter, although having had no
previous experience, are showing up
well.
Owing to the fact that the backfield
had but two nights to show their ability,
no such definite showing can be determ
ined, but Holt, Lilly, Falk, Slauderman,
Wark, Gibson, Ronney, Parker, Camp
bell, Pelouze, Reynolds and Swanholm
seem to have the material that coach
is looking for.
