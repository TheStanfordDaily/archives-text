# OUT OF THE SHELL
## 
### 
tlie colle S e year 1918-19 is tast drawing to a close,
ao^SlI opportunity for a backward glance presents itself.
Many features of the fall, winter, and spring quarters are of such
a nature as to demand criticism in applause or condemnation. For
the past few years college men and women have been constantly broadening
their field of interest and awakening to external demands that are commenc
ing to press upon the collegian.
It is in this sphere of awakening interest that the college man and woman
seek to hear from outsiders of standing in affairs. College men and women
are interested in these outside affairs and desire to hear from people repre
sentative enough to speak on topics with which they are conversant and with
which their names are connected.
Assemblies and lectures are essential parts of college existence. Assem
blies are of greater value than most routine class-room work and lectures by
visitors greatly more broadening than doctrines expounded in the same man
ner year after year, and day after day by the same professors from the same
text books and with even the same decorations of the same jokes and humor.
We have missed speakers and assemblies throughout the past year. We have
missed them both in quantity and in quality.
Stanford needs speakers and men of importance to address the University
people in the Assembly Hall and visitors to address small groups in the
class rooms. The broadening influence of the outside in necessary. If large
crowds do not attend a lecture that is no proof that lectures are not wanted.
The right people will always draw a crowd; the leading men in their lines
of work will always appeal to those to whom they want to appeal, viz., those
interested.
We are at college to broaden and to move out of our shells; let us learn
more of the outside from prominent speakers at assemblies and representa
tive visitors to the class rooms.
