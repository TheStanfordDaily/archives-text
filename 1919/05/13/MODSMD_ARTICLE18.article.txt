# DEBATING SOCIETIES TO MEET IN CONTEST
## 
### 
Euplironia and Nestoria meet to
morrow night in the annual interso
ciety clash of brains, in the Little
Theater at 7:30.
The Euphronia team is composed
of Lauder W. Hodges, '21, M. M. Gold
stein, *19, and H. A. Fendler, '21,
which combination is considered one
of the ablest ever produced by the
club.
Nestoria's trio is made up of W. C.
Fundenburg, '19, W. B. Wells, '20, and
R. G. Hillis, '22, and is slated by Nes
torians to win the contest.
Both teams have been working for
several weeks on the question, "Re
solved, That Immigration Shall be
Restricted for a Period of Four
Years." The affirmative will be up
held by Nestoria. Ten-minute speech
es and tliree-minute rebuttals will be
made by each man.

The intersociety clash ranks with
the freshman-sophomore debate as
one of the pre-war traditions to be
revived this year. The teams are
very evenly matched and a spirited
contest should result.
