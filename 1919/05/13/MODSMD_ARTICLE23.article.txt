## Prominent Women to Talk at Vocational Conference to Be Held May 24 
### 
The Women's Vocational Confer
ence, for which Saturday, May 24th,
has been reserved, is being presented
by the University as a means of aid
ing the University women in their
choice of a profession.
Speakers of great prominence in
lines of social, economic, and welfare
work, journalism, nursing, chemical,
and laboratory work of all kinds, and
business which women can enter,
have been obtained. They are women
who know from experience the diffi
culties and the advantages of their
respective fields, and they will present
thsse to Stanford women with advice
as to the training and preparation
needed.
The conference will begin at 9:30 in
the morning and extend throughout
the day, with three speeches sched
uled for the forenoon and three for
the afternoon. Each talk will last for
forty-five minutes ,and any one may
come for any one or all of the talks.
Time will be allowed for the change
of audience.
Those who are interested in one
particular subject of the conference
may prefer to come only for that talk.
All others who are yet undecided as
to their particular vocation are urged
to hear as many of the speakers as
possible and thus learn of all possi
bilities for women.
Heretofore such work of advising
and giving information has been done
solely by Mrs. Snell, appointment sec
retary of the University, except for
a similar conference held last. year.
The demand for information has war
ranted once more the holding of a
vocational conference. If the interest
shown is sufficient, the University
will make this annual meeting a per
manent thing.
