# Art Gallery Will Show Water Colors
## Collection Represents Wild Flowers and Birds of New Guina 
### 
A most remarkable collection of
water color paintings will be shown
in the art gallery next week, accord
ing to University authorities. This
collection represents some 211 studies
of West Indian and American flowers,
many Australian varieties and paint
ings of fifty-two rare birds of para
dise found in New Guina. The col
lection represents eleven years' work
on the part of Mrs. Ellis Rowan, an
Australian. She recently reffused an
offer from the U. S. Government of
$75,000 for the entire set.
In order to secure the rare paint
ings of the birds of paradise, Mrs.
Rowan had to surmount many serious
difficulties. To secure specimens to
sketch the artist penetrated the wilds
of New Guina, where no one else had
112 ver dared to go. By drawing sketches
and painting the savages and their
wild birds in their natural colors, Mrs.
Rowan so aroused their interest and
gained their good will, that the sav
ages captured fifty-two rare specimens
of the native wild birds. Some three
months was used by the painter in
painting the birds, which the natives
presented her. Although offered $1000
for the birds by a trader, she refused
it and let them go free.
Many of these paintings of Aus
tralian flowers are done with such ex
quisite likeness that they are used
by botanical classes throughout the
world.
The collection is being shown in
San Francisco this week and will ar
live here on Monday.
