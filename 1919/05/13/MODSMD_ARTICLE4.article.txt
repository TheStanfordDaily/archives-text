## 
### 
"Spring Fever" will be the subject
and title of Chaparral's May number,
Its causes, symptoms and horrible re
sults will be discussed at length in the
May issue when it makes its appear
ance on Quaid next Thursday. Bath
ing girls, a limpid pool, and a patch
of purple grass go to make up the strilc
ing "Spring Fever" cover by George
Kocher, '19.
The germ of this malady is isolated
and portrayed in a double page car
toon by "Monk" Antrim, '19. The man
who rides to his eight o'clock in a
Pullman is a favorite patient of
"Monk's" in his two-page Spring Fevet
ward.
The May "Chappie" will be featured
by two frontispieces, one drawn by Miss
Janis Dunker, '22, entitled "The Prom
Girl" and the other by Antrim, "The
Boy Who Pays the Bills." A long poem
on the "Shimmee" brings up that favor
ite topic of discussion again.
"Sir Clinton Mastoid at Play" is the
title of a burlesque mystery story writ
ten by Editor "Les" Levy, '19. The
editorials deal especially with the ques
tion of a football game with California
and the ever-present "10:30" rule.
Other contributors to this issue are
"Sam" Glikbarg, '19. with his 'Crazy
logue with a Moral," and Miss Mar
gery Bailey. The price of the issue will
be twenty-five cents.
