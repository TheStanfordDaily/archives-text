# RETURN OF "HERC" BIHLMAN WILL AID FOOTBALL SQUAD
## 
### 
Word that "Here" Bihlman, former
Stanford football, baseball and track
star, will return to the campus has
been received by friends. Bihlman will
go out for football, and lie will be a big
aid to the backfield.
Bihlman made a big reputation for
himself in the army as a fullback. He
played on an all-star team in 1 exas, and
authorities who have seen him play,
claim that with a little more experience
he will be the best fullback in Amer
ica. He has the qualities of weight
and strength combined with speed, and
it is said that he is an extremely hard
man to tackle.
Caughey is another man who made a
football reputation in the army. He
played guard on the famous Allentown
team that cleaned up all the northern
teams.
With these men playing next fall,
Evans will have two men who arc stars
in their positions, and they will also be
able to assist him with the other candi
dates.
