# SENIOR FARCE IS SELECTED
## 1919 Will Show "Nothing But the Truth" 
### 
Li jVTOTHING But the Truth," one of
11 the hits of Broadway two sea
sons ago, has been selected to be pro
duced as the 1919 senior farce.
According to all indications, the
committee has made a very wise
choice in this play.
Willie Collier starred in the pro
duction for two complete seasons in
New York and it was produced with
corresponding success by Max Pig
man on the coast under Morosco's
supervision. It iu interesting to note
that Morosco's western representative
recommended the play to the senior
farce committee.
Those who have seen "Nothing but
the Truth" on the professional stage

all agree that it is eminently fitted for
such an amateur production as the
senior farce. It is essentially clever
and belongs to the higher type of
comedy. Its humor is there in abund
ance, but it is all clean, snappy fun.
Preliminary tryouts for the farce
will be held in the Assembly Hall on
Thursday afternoon from 2 to 6. Any
one in the Universtiy is eligible to a
position in the cast and consequently
a large amount of campus dramatic
talent is expected to appear. "Noth
ing but the Truth" will be produced
at the opening of Senior Week, June
15-20, although the exact date has not
been set as yet .
