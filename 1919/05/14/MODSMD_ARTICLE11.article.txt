The second of the live lectures on
"Social Morality," being given this

men of the University, was delivered
yesterday, in the Little Theater.
Dr. Mann is a member of the Bureau
of Social Education of the National
Board of the Y. W. C. A., being form
erly connected with Smith College. She
was recently director of the summer
course given at Mt. Holyoke, for the
training of women for social recon

The lectures are given every day this

Gymnasium classes conflicting with this
hour are excused to attend. Dr. Mann

There will be no Y. W. C. A. meet
ing this week, because it conflicts with
Dr. Mann's lectures.
