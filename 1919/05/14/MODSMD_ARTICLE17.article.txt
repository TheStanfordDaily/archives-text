### 
today's issue of the Daily Palo Alto, changes in the
m-J WJr*-A Aafefcl staff are announced. C. E. Randall, '20, who has been
serving on the paper since his freshman year and who has been
acting in the capacity of news editor, is with this issue forced to
lesign from the staff because of pressure of outside work. Miss Ellen Calhoun,
'20. has been appointed from head of the reportorial staff to the news editor's
position. Miss Calhoun has been serving as assistant news editor for the past
year.
Several new members are added to the reportorial staff: Miss Esther
Gleason, *21, Ruth Powell, '21, Miss Bertha Vaughan, '21, Elaine Adrian, '22,
L. E. Lyon, '22, and Miss Mary Clark have shown through their work their right
to be classed with the list of staff members.
In announcement of the new members of the Daily, opportunity cannot be
overlooked to point out what is considered in the way of work by the tryoutees
that ultimately declares them eligible to the staff. Each quarter it has become
the custom to throw open to tryoutees the opportunity to make the staff through
competitive tryouts extending over a certain length of time. Ihe best of the
material produced is then added to the list of regular reporters.
In an endeavor to eliminate deadwood, the Daily seeks to give precedence
to those who are out to work for the interest of the paper, rather than any
journalism credit connected with the work that they do. College credit for
work on the Daily Palo Alto is given for work done on the paper, and men
and women receiving such credit must demonstrate their litness to remain with
the staff and work with the paper.
In coming quarters, when tryouts are opened again, it is hoped that a larger
number of tryoutees will compete for the future positions of responsibility.
