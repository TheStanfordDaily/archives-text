# Allies Give Aid to Russia Says Speaker
## B.R. Baumgardt Illustrates Lecture With Views of Russia 
### 
"Because the allies, especially the
United States, are to blame for the
downfall of Russia ;|nd the rise of
Bolshevism, it is our duty to stand by
them patiently in their present hour of
need," said R. B. Baumgardt, in a lec
ture at the Little Theatre on "Crucified
Russia" last night.
Dr. David Starr Jordan introduced
the lecturer, who spoke of conditions
in Russia from his personal knowledge,
lie has traveled widely in that country
and has studied conditions there with
keen thought.
"It is the common belief," he said,
"that it was always dangerous to travel
in Russia. I have traveled there be
fore the revolution and since, and have
never found any difficulty. In fact, I j
believe, that there is much more dan
ger traveling in New York. The Rus
sian people are like overgrown, ignorant
children. Curiosity is their character
istic, and they are always asking what
the Americans think of them.
"Tolstoy made a prophecy that some |
day a young Russian student would
rise to become the world's next Na
poleon. Kerensky, the dreamer, was
popularly supposed to be this young
student, but he was too weak. Russia's
downfall was not so much due to the |
Bolsheviki as to Kerensky. ITe could
not withstand the German intrigue.
"The Germans have always under
stood the Russian soul, and when they
sent in Leninc and Trotsky to stir up
the people to Bolshevism, they knew
how to appeal to the popular fancies."
Mr. Baumgardt concluded his lecture
with a choice exhibit of colored slides
which he explained, showing the various
palaces and works of art with which:
Russia abounds.
