# Euphronia to Debate Nestoria Team Tonight
## 
### 
Tonight the debating trio selected by
the Nestoria Debating Club will meet
the Euphronia team in room 12 of the
Law Building at 7 :30.
Lauder W. Hodges, '21, H. A. Fend
ler, '22, and M. M. Goldstein. '20, will
represent the Euphronia Club, while
W. C. Fundenburg, '19, W. 15. Wells,
'20, and R. G. Hillis, '20, will uphold
the Nestoria position.
"Resolved, that immigration to the
United States should be restricted for
a period of four years," in the sub
ject for discussion on which Nestoria
has taken the affirmative.
The inter-society debate is a tradi
tion of Stanford amateur debating, and
the winner usually meets the best trio
from the University of California,
though the meet this year lias been
postponed too long for this.
The debate this year is expected to
lie particularly spirited, as the presidents
of the rival societies arc on their re
spective teams.
