that the candidates are fitted for. Foot
ball fans will also be given an oppor
tunity to look over the prospects for
next fall.
The quality of the material that has
shown up is twice as good as Evans
expected. The amount of men that
have had experience in the game is in

ball suits at the start of spring training
have failed to turn out regularly, ac
cording to Evans, and he desires these
