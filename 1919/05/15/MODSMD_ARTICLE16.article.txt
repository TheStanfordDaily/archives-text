# STANFORD AND THE CONFERENCE
##

i n t ent * oll ot representatives of the various colleges
' n t ' ie ac^c Coast Confernce to meet early in June to
aJL> Jj discuss questions of general interest to the conference colleges
gives an opportunity to Stanford that should be appreciated and
not overlooked. We have been told by those conversant with our athletic
policy and by those who have shown us that, intagible as-it may seem at
times, in the long run we have an athletic policy, that the so-called Stanford
system is commencing to gain a strong foothold in the educational institu
tions on the Pacific Coast.
At the conference meeting when representatives from the far western
colleges are met for just such a purpose, the opportunity to formally intro
duce the Stanford system and urge its adoption universally on the Pacific
Coast will be exceptionally offered. By the Stanford system we naturally
refer to the system of universal participation in athletics, winning teams and
not professionalized teams, real coaches but not paid specialists imported at
enormous expense to win games but to lower the sport. It is this system that
we have come to regard as the Stanford system, because we have helped to
pioneer the movement in the larger western colleges.
Attempts at universal adoption of this system will undoubtedly lead to
opposition. The root of all difficulty with the University of California is just
this difference between the system of athletics on the Farm and the Berkeley
method. Any attempt at introduction of the Cardinal methods will undoubt
edly meet with opposition from the Blue and Gold adherents and allies.
It is in the knowledge of this and in the knowledge that Stanford's best
means of furthering the advancement of its system is offered by the confer
ence itself that we ought to strengthen our position with other universities
and colleges in the conference. We should not let the meeting this year pass
without some real and earnest agitation for the adoption of the universal
participation, unprofessionalized system. The general favor that has been
growing for the. system is encouragement enough to urge beginning of earn
est agitation. The further realization that adoption by a few and non-adop
tion by others will lead to fatal variances and differences in both the attitude
towards athletics and the types and caliber of teams resulting from two dif
ferent systems should urge immediate settlement of the question.
Th West should pioneer this new and powerful movemnt in athletics and
Stanford as typical of the West should pioneer the movement amongst the
Pacific Coast institutions.
