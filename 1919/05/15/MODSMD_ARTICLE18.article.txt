Profefssor Treat Discusses
Japanese Situation in China
Japan's right to use the German
property in Kaiochow (Tsingtau), as
ceded by the treaty of peace, formed
the basis of an editorial by Professor
D. J. Treat of the History department,
m last night's issue of the Palo Alto
Times.
Correcting the current error con
cerning Japanese claims in China, and
that Shantung was "ceded" to Japan,
Professor Treat explained that it was
the German lease right only for use
of railroads and mining property that
was ceded, and that Japan has prom
ised to restore the land back to the
Chinese, despite the lease granting
them its use for eight-seven more
years.
