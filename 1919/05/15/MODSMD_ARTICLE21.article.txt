## Coach Jones Arranges Big Tourney After Meets Are Postponed

California and Stanford have agreed
on a date for the annual wrestling
tournament, which will be held at the
Enema Gym on the night of May 23, at
7 :3(). Coach Jones has started prepara
tions for the intensive training of his
men from now until the time of the
tournament.
The two universities have had the
wrestling meet scheduled for two dif
ferent dates, hut each time some dif
ficulty arose. May 2 was the first date
set for the meet, hut was called off due
to the fact that California had several
of their wrestlers on the crew. Plans
were then made for the followine Wed
nesday, hut were soon after called off.
It was supposed that California would
forfeit this meet to Stanford. Stan
ford at the time, did claim a victory
over the Bruins, which was not recog
nized by the up-bay team.
Arrangements were completed last
evening by Coach Jones of Stanford
and Coach Andrews of California. The
| California team will cinsist of the men
j previously weighed in at California,

man team will be put up against the
j Stanford first-year men.

I pective weights over two weeks ago,
