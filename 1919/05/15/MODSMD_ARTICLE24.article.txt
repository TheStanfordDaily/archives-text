It is interesting to look back over the
years, especially in these days of "high
living," and see how we use to do, here
on the Farm.
"At Stanford University," says the
Chronicle in June, 1899, "hoarding clubs
seem rather more popular with women
students than with men."
One of the first of these, and prob
ably the most successful, was a club
formed by twelve girls. They rented
a house, and each student furnished her
own room. One of their number was
chosen as manager and had general
supervision of the household. One girl
did the ordering and cooking for her
board and room, and the others divided
the housework among them. The ex
penses, including everything, ranged
from $9 to $13 a month.
Another interesting arrangement was
formed by three women who rented a
cottage and carricd out their ideal ir*
housekeeping plans. They divided the
work systematically, and each one did
all kinds of work in rotation. Then
was always a lady, a second maid and a
cook. It was the lady's work to watei
the garden, prepare the lunches and
carry them to the cottage. The second
maid took care of the rooms and wiped
dishes. The cook attended to the or
dering of supplies, prepared the meals,
and did the heavy work. At the end of
each week the accounts were settled
and each girl changed her social posi

tion in the household. These girls gave
several dinner parties and afternoons
during the year, and entertained most
charmingly. One feature of their house
hold life was the reading which was
done while the dishes were being
washed. It was the lady's place to
do this, and while the cook and second
maid worked she read Kipling to them.
Each girl's expenses, "including every
thing," was $13 a month.
The Owl Club, or better known as
"The Camp," was a group of men who
for the most part were working their
way through college. They elected a
general manager each month, who at
tended to the buying and paying of
bills. Each boy did his own cooking,
baking and washing. The personnel
of the club was most interesting. It
is said they boasted a rank socialist and
a law student who got into heated argu
ments ; a funny storyteller and an artist
who sat quietly by and sketched them
all. There were Engineering and Eng
lish students and in time the camp be
came the literary center of the Uni
versity. These men figured their liv
ing down to the very lowest sum, and
their board cost them on an average
$3 a month. Room rent at the camp,
the shacks left by the workmen, was
$2 a month. Will and Wallace Irwin.
Charley Field and many others were
among the many members of this
famous camp.

The Owl Club, or better known as
"The Camp," was a group of men who
for the most part were working their
way through college. They elected a
general manager each month, who at
tended to the buying and paying of
bills. Each boy did his own cooking,
baking and washing. The personnel
of the club was most interesting. It
is said they boasted a rank socialist and
a law student who got into heated argu
ments ; a funny storyteller and an artist
who sat quietly by and sketched them
all. There were Engineering and Eng
lish students and in time the camp be
came the literary center of the Uni
versity. These men figured their liv
ing down to the very lowest sum, and
their board cost them on an average
$3 a month. Room rent at the camp,
the shacks left by the workmen, was
$2 a month. Will and Wallace Irwin.

It is interesting to look back over the
years, especially in these days of "high
living," and see how we use to do, here
on the Farm.
"At Stanford University," says the
Chronicle in June, 1899, "hoarding clubs
seem rather more popular with women
students than with men."
One of the first of these, and prob
ably the most successful, was a club
formed by twelve girls. They rented
a house, and each student furnished her
own room. One of their number was
chosen as manager and had general
supervision of the household. One girl
did the ordering and cooking for her
board and room, and the others divided
the housework among them. The ex
penses, including everything, ranged
from $9 to $13 a month.
Another interesting arrangement was
formed by three women who rented a
cottage and carricd out their ideal ir*
housekeeping plans. They divided the
work systematically, and each one did
all kinds of work in rotation. Then
was always a lady, a second maid and a
cook. It was the lady's work to watei
the garden, prepare the lunches and
carry them to the cottage. The second
maid took care of the rooms and wiped
dishes. The cook attended to the or
dering of supplies, prepared the meals,
and did the heavy work. At the end of
each week the accounts were settled
and each girl changed her social posi

tion in the household. These girls gave
several dinner parties and afternoons
during the year, and entertained most
charmingly. One feature of their house
hold life was the reading which was
done while the dishes were being
washed. It was the lady's place to
do this, and while the cook and second
maid worked she read Kipling to them.
