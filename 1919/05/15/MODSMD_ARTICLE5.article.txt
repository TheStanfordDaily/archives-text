# LAW SCHOOL STUDENTS TO TAKE BAR TESTS
## 
### 
Two members of the Stanford Law
School are planning to take bar ex
amination, which is to be given be
fore one of the San Francisco appel
late courts, June 9. The inopportune
time, preceding final examinations by
only a few days, prevents a number
of others from taking the test.
J. H. Machado, '15, and J. E. O'Hara,
'18, are the men from the "farm" that
are taking the examination next
month. These examinations are given
twice a year, and ten Stanford men
have already signed up for the one in
the fall.
