# TENNIS TOURNAMENT TOMORROW
## 
### 
Tennis has taken another lease of life
around Stanford, as evidenced by the
turnout for the 1 Tasting's Cup Tourna
ment that will be played next Satur
day. So many entrees have been re
ccived that it will be necessary to have
some preliminary matches Saturday
morning before the regular tournament
is played.
The tournament will be a handicap
affair so that anyone in the university
stands an equa lchance of getting a good
place. Most of the Varsity and several
of the freshman team will go into the
meet as scratch men. In spite of the

handicaps, Barber, Turner, Kinney,
Bent, and Hubbard of the Varsity squad
are expected to be runners up in the
finals. Hawkes, Davies, Necr and Tuss
ing have been putting up the best game
among the freshmen. The handicaps
will be announced on schedule before
the matches start.
Preliminary matches on Saturday
morning are as follows:
Hawkes vs. Mendel; Tusing vs.
Nathan; Deline vs. J. Neer.
The matches will be played on the
Encina courts at 10 a.m. and the regu
lar tournament will tsart at 1 p.m.
