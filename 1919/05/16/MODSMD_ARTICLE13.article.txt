expects the best campus talent to take
part. In the choruses particulary

which play important parts, and it is

be ably filled. There are over three
hundred parts for men alone, so that
all who so desire should have a good
opportunity of appearing in the final
cast.

American forces, both abroad and at
home in the present war, and many
of those Stanford heroes are expected
to return to the campus during that
