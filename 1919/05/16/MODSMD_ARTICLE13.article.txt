# TRYOUTS FOR PAGEANT WILL BE HELD ON MONDAY
## PARTS FOR 300 PEOPLE Large Number of Masculine Voices Will Be Needed For Choruses 
### 
rnRYOUTS for the English Club pa
geant have been set for Tuesday
afternoon from 3 to 6 o'clock, in the
Assembly Hall. Every one who de
sires to try out for this massive pro
duction is asked to be on hand at that
time.
As there are a great many leading
and important roles the committee
expects the best campus talent to take
part. In the choruses particulary
men are desired, as the music is to
be a big feature of the pageant.
The action is divided into three
parts, emphasizing the spirit of serv
ice which has characterized the foun
ders of the early California missions,
and the present spirit of service of
this institution. Throughout the en
tire action there are many characters
which play important parts, and it is
the desire of the committee and the
director to have a large number turn
out on Tuesday, that all the roles may
be ably filled. There are over three
hundred parts for men alone, so that
all who so desire should have a good
opportunity of appearing in the final
cast.
The English Club is preparing this
large production as a drawing feature
of Home-coming Week, and as such
it is particularly adapted. It is in
tended as a memorial to the Stanford
men who have seen service with the
American forces, both abroad and at
home in the present war, and many
of those Stanford heroes are expected
to return to the campus during that
week. For that reason the committee
is particularly anxious that the pa
geant should not be a failure for want
of campus talent.
The pageant as arranged is a se
ries of dramatic episodes in. three
parts, showing in the first part the
early life in California, with the com
ing of Portola, the advent of the
founding of the missions and the com
ing of Junipero Serra.
The next part will depict the found
ing of the University, and the spirit
of service to which it was dedicated,
and which later grew up into the just
ly famous "Stanford Spirit." The last
part will deal with the reconstruction
after llie war and the Tuture of Stan
ford.
