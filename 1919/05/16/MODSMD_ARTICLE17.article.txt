# SYLLABUS FEES AND POCKETBOOKS
## 
### 
the lirst (lays of the Stanford student's freshman
XL â„¢ year, syllabus fees are always a mystery, annoy
ifpigrj ance and financial disappointment to him. Their quarterly appear
ance brings with it repeated inconveniences. Realizing, however,
that syllabus fees are necessary, or so we are told, to the maintenance of Stan
ford University as an educational institution, there are still some features
about them that we cannot understand.
The method of estimating syllabus fees, of differentiating them from reg
istration fees has always been a puzzle to us. If the student is paying the
average cost of the course in which he is enrolled, there certainly are grave
discrepancies in some courses that outwardly appear the same. The eco
nomics major and the law student make exorbitantly unequal contributions to
the syllabus fund.
There undoubtedly is some difference at Stanford in the cost of educat
ing the lawyer and the economics major, but there hardly seems to be the
unreasonable disproportion that is shown in the amounts of fees.
And one other thing has always been a source of curiosity. Syllabus fees
are not .permitted to remain long in the pockets of the student. This forty
eight-hour limit for payment of fees works hard on some members of the
student body who might not have ready facilities for paying upon two-day
notice. Add to this some uncertainty in mail distribution, some possibility
of the student's not getting his mail each day and the time for payment be
comes uncomfortably short. And to this add the two-dollar fine that pro
ceeds to enrich the syllabus fund upon delayed payment and our differences
with syllabus payments becomes rather marked.
The purpose and use of syllabus fees should be explained to the man
or woman who digs down and pays. Some of the discrepancies in payment
should likewise be explained. Furthermore, while we do not advocate long
delayed settlements, we most certainly urge longer time of grace between
receipt of the slips and cashing of the checks.
