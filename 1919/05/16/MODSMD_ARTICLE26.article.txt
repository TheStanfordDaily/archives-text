## DAILY PALO ALTO WOMEN'S SPORTS TOMORROW 
### Margaret McCall, '21 
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, CALIFORNIA, FRIDAY, MAY 16, 1919.

TO the feminine portion of the campus, Women's Day means the biggest day
for women's athletics in the whole college year. It is the day when new
stars in the athletic world shine forth, when records are made and when the
masculine portion of the "Farm" sits up and takes notice and whispers in an
astonished manner, "Can these be they?"
It is a time when class spirit and class rivalry among the women is most
noticeable. The big question of the day is not who will be the star of lite meet,
but which class will be vitorious. Last year the class of '20 was the one
which scored the highest number of points. But which will be the victor this
\ ear ?
The sports will take place in the morning. It is rather difficult to judge
jyst which class will come out ahead in these, in fact the results of tomorrow's
events will be the only means by which to judge, although the sophomore class
seems to have a slight advantage over the other classes. Under the heading of
sports, comes held sports, baseball, basket ball and tennis.
During the week there have been two games of basket ball. The sophomores
were victorious over the freshman team last Tuesday. The seniors won from
the junior team on Thursday. Tomorrow the seniors will meet the sophomores
to decide which has the batter team. It is rather hard to predict which team
will win for there are women from the varsity team on both sides and the
game promises to be a close contest. It is the opinion of the captain, how
ever, that the sophomore team has a little advantage over the other six.
The baseball game will not be an interclass contest. There have not been
enough women who know sufficient about the "national pastime" to form four
teams, so it has been arranged to play this game with an outside team. How
ever, judging from the way the girls with but a few weeks' practice took the
game away from the Mill's team, there should be little or no chance of a failure
in Saturday's game, after the practice that has been going on for the past few
weeks.
I lie field sports are hard to give any "dope' on. There seems to be very
little comparison to make, so Saturday's results will have to tell the tale in
that case.
Tennis matches have been played off during the week, leaving a team for
each class to compete in the finals. By all of the data that can be collected, the
.sophomores stand a good chance of winning these matches on Saturday.
Swimming, crew, and canoe races are much more pliable material in the
hands of the dopesters than any of the other sports. In these, it is possible to
