# "WHEREIN DO WE LACK?"
## 
### George M. Kyle, '18 
AMONG the men and women who
have seen fit to return to the Uni
versity after a period spent in the
turmoil and intensity of America's
participation in the war and espe
cially among those who have been in
the actual cutting edge of the strug
gle. there is a feeling of restlessness
and unsettledness that has somehow
manifested itself in the whole uni
versity atmosphere. Whether this
feeling is the result of the war re
actions on the students themselves or
the fault of conditions here would be
interesting for speculation.
War is a lifetime in miniature. It
is living multiplied to the nth pow
er. To one who goes into it with open
eyes there is an unparalleled oppor
tunity to find what it would take
years of ordinary life to do. The
stress of the economic struggle is re
moved and one has time to get the
broader vision on things. Coming
back here, what does such a person
find? He finds a life absolutely de
void of every contact with the outside
world. The great principles for which
he has offered his life and which have
been the guiding motive to his ac
tions are laid away, forgotten, on the
shelf. The student is too wrapt in the
narrow round of the local life and the
professor is apt, in the secljusion and
beauty of the existence here, to lose
touch with the changing conditions of
the outside world. The cry of the
modern world is for the universities
to become more practical, to turn out
men with definite <raining along defi
nite lines so they will be able to make
a living. If, however, the greater
part of the training is relegated to
this purpose, the fundamental idea of
a university education is endangered.
No one is educated when he leaves a
college. All the training can do for
him is to point out the lines along
which he will have to educate himself.
No man is a chemist or an engineer

or a geologist when he graduates, he
is merely a trained automaton along
that line of work, who can perhaps
make a fair living at it. To make any
real progress along these lines in the
outside world requires the art of
knowing people and life in general,
besides the technical side. Only the
person with the big vision will ad
vance in any line of endeavor and be
of some use to himself and to the
world. It is the function of the uni
versities to help enable students to
acquire that vision and it is the lack
of that which one feels at Stanford
now.
This is so of most of the American
universities of the present day and
one cannot help but remark that the
course of the evolution of the colleges
has been towards conservatism and a
spirit almost reactionary. In the time
of Martin Luther it was through the
universities that the new ideas were
promulgated. They were the leaders
of the world's thought. Today only
such ideas as have been carefully pre
digested and shorn of anything rad
ical are allowed to come near the ten
der brains of the students. In the
class rooms the professors know thatâ– 
the only way to have a student get a
real grasp of a subject is to let him
handle the problem first and then be
corrected. If they are all corrected
for him beforehand he loses all initia
tive in that line and is not able to
think for himself. Men known to be
a little radical are never invited to
speak at the universities and all new
lines of thought are therefore intro
duced outside their sphere of influ
ence. As a consequence the colleges
have lost their influence in the prac
tical world and are now but steps
leading to that life, when perhaps
they could wield more influence if
they were, like at first, leaders and
not followers in the advancement of
new ideas and culture.
