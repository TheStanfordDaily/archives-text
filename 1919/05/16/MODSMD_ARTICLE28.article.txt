# High School Track Meets Help Stanford
## 
### Neil H. Petree, '19 
FOR the seventh consccutive time
lias defeated the Universi
ty of California in the intercollegiate
track and field meet —but what of next
year? No loyal Stanford man likes to
lie a pessimist, nor to appear to be lack
ing in the proper amount of booster
spirit, but Cardinal prospects for the
1920 track team look very slim. The
main point is that the Stanford fresh
man track men, the men who will he
eligible next year to compete for the
Varsity, don't bat with a good average
when compared with the Blue and Gold
first year tracksters.—Why is this?
No Interscholastic Meet
The fact that Stanford no longer
holds the annual high school Interscho
lastic Track and Field Meet is one of
the big reasons, if not the principal one.
For a number of years, the best track
men from all the high schools in the
state journeyed to Stanford to compete
against each other. This meet was the
one big event of the track season for
the high school star. It greatly en
couraged competition, and indirectly
developed track men in practically all
of the high schools. Times were made
at these meets which were far better
than any now made in the high school
meets in the State.
High School Boys Get Stanford Spirit
High School men came to Stanford
from all over the State and remained
on the campus as guests of the Uni
versity for several days. Many boys
imbibed of the Stanford spirit, saw the
wonders of the University, and decided
to come to Stanford. Other lads de
cided to come to college to whom a high
school education had seemed sufficient
before. The annual interscholastic was
a big boost for Stanford, it was a boost
for college education in general, and
it greatly stimulated athletics, especi
ally track.
Truly, the University of California
quickly saw the results of the high
school interscholastics, and started one
of its own. This did not hurt Stanford,
however, for the facilities were much
better on the "farm" for entertaining
the visiting boys, and the state universi
ty is so big that three hundred high
school lads wandering about could
scarcely be noticed. When Stanford
gave up the interscholastics, California
did likewise. The Blue and Gold can
do without them, for Coach Christie
will never have much trouble in picking
a good squad of track men from over
a thousand freshmen. Stanford, how
ever, needs the high school meet. A
careful perusal of the last seven inter
collegiate meets will show that Stan
ford has depended greatly upon the in
dividual work of a few men, mostly
[graduates of Palo Alto high school. It
is doubtful if "Pally" will send us any
more Murrays, Templetons, Lachmunds,
Sissons, Schnells. or Nortons for a
while, so Stanford will have to look
elsewhere for her men,
Let the Board of Athletic Control
vote to have a high school interscholastic
here next year. Let Stanford men prop
erly demonstrate what real Stanford
spirit is to some three hundred track
men from all over the State; let the
expense of the meet he borne by the
j Stanford student body, as of old; give
suitable prizes to the winning contest
ants, and the results will clearly be
shown in future Stanford track teams.
With annual interscholastics to boost
the sport here, Stanford men will not
have to fear for the coming meets, and
wonder who is to replace the present
varsity stars, as is the case now.

one big event of the track season for
the high school star. It greatly en
couraged competition, and indirectly
developed track men in practically all
of the high schools. Times were made
at these meets which were far better
than any now made in the high school
meets in the State.
High School Boys Get Stanford Spirit
High School men came to Stanford
from all over the State and remained
on the campus as guests of the Uni
versity for several days. Many boys
imbibed of the Stanford spirit, saw the
wonders of the University, and decided
to come to Stanford. Other lads de
cided to come to college to whom a high
school education had seemed sufficient
before. The annual interscholastic was
a big boost for Stanford, it was a boost
for college education in general, and
it greatly stimulated athletics, especi
ally track.
Truly, the University of California
quickly saw the results of the high
school interscholastics, and started one
of its own. This did not hurt Stanford,
however, for the facilities were much
better on the "farm" for entertaining
the visiting boys, and the state universi
ty is so big that three hundred high
school lads wandering about could
scarcely be noticed. When Stanford
gave up the interscholastics, California
did likewise. The Blue and Gold can
do without them, for Coach Christie
will never have much trouble in picking
a good squad of track men from over
a thousand freshmen. Stanford, how
ever, needs the high school meet. A
careful perusal of the last seven inter
collegiate meets will show that Stan
ford has depended greatly upon the in
dividual work of a few men, mostly
[graduates of Palo Alto high school. It
is doubtful if "Pally" will send us any
more Murrays, Templetons, Lachmunds,
Sissons, Schnells. or Nortons for a
while, so Stanford will have to look
elsewhere for her men,
Let the Board of Athletic Control
vote to have a high school interscholastic
here next year. Let Stanford men prop
erly demonstrate what real Stanford
spirit is to some three hundred track
men from all over the State; let the
expense of the meet he borne by the
j Stanford student body, as of old; give
suitable prizes to the winning contest
ants, and the results will clearly be
shown in future Stanford track teams.
With annual interscholastics to boost
the sport here, Stanford men will not
have to fear for the coming meets, and
wonder who is to replace the present
varsity stars, as is the case now.
FOR the seventh consccutive time
lias defeated the Universi
ty of California in the intercollegiate
track and field meet —but what of next
year? No loyal Stanford man likes to
lie a pessimist, nor to appear to be lack
ing in the proper amount of booster
spirit, but Cardinal prospects for the
1920 track team look very slim. The
main point is that the Stanford fresh
man track men, the men who will he
eligible next year to compete for the
Varsity, don't bat with a good average
when compared with the Blue and Gold
first year tracksters.—Why is this?
No Interscholastic Meet
The fact that Stanford no longer
holds the annual high school Interscho
lastic Track and Field Meet is one of
the big reasons, if not the principal one.
For a number of years, the best track
men from all the high schools in the
state journeyed to Stanford to compete
against each other. This meet was the
