# MATMEN SETTLE ARGUMENT
## 
### Coach P.H Jones 
A FTER much bickering and squab
ling, the Stanford-California wrest
ling tournament has at last been ar
ranged for Friday evening, May 23,
at the Encina gymnasium.
The team this year is of an un
known quantity in that but two out
side tournaments have been held dur
ing the year. Sufficient competition
has not been given the men to really
determine their ability.
Judging by the team's work in prac
tice. however, it appears that the line
up is the best balanced one that Stan
ford has ever turned out, and irre
spective of the outcome of the Stan
ford-California bouts a week from
Friday, the men have earned our
heartiest support by their hard con
sistent training throughout the year.
The highest point man on the team,
Kakimoto, has two years' experience
to his credit, and has won several
successful matches from California.
He is more confident of a win this
year than ever before.
Gonzales, our representative in the
115-pound class, is for the first time
in excellent condition, which is all he
has needed in the past to make him
one of the cleverest and most dan
gerous men of his weight who has
ever competed in intercollegiate
meets.
Our featherweight, Egami, is with
out question the best all-around
wrestler that Stanford has ever had
and many are of the opinion that he
is the best man at his weight on the
coast.
As a lightweight, Erickson has been
the real find for us. What he lacks
in experience and knowledge of the
game, he amply makes up in quick
ness, strength and determination. Cal
ifornia's 135-pound man has a mighty
tough proposition ahead of him on the
| twenty-third.

Jack Lynn of chemistry fame, has
clearly earned his position as welter
weight by constantly forcing his op
ponents to star-gaze on any and all
occasions. He may have difficulty in
making weight, but if that torturous
process doesn't unduly weaken him,
he ought to win in spite of the fact
that our enemies are very proud of
their own 145-pound man.
We have been very fortunate in
weathering another find in the middle
weight division â€”Bunds is the man in
question. All I can say is for every
one to watch him go against Califor
nia. lam more than sure that he will
be one of Stanford's best 159-pound
wrestlers.
Dave Wise, last year's coach, says
that Bunds is the hardest man to beat
on the defensive he has ever tackled.
I can say the same thing.
Freeman will wrestle a hard, aggres
sive match, as he has in every match
this year. He was comparatively in
experienced at the beginning of the
year, but has improved remarkably
in the last few weeks.
Demund will uphold the Cardinal in
the unlimited class, and while he will
doubtless be greatly outweighed, I
am confident of his ability to come out
on top.
The freshman team will not be as
well balanced as the varsity, but
there are a number of excellent men
on the team who are bound to de
velop into varsity men of the high
est order if they stay with the game.
Tn regard to our chances for next
year, I believe that every man on the
varsity will be back in college and
will probably come out for the activ
ity. In addition, this year's freshman
wrestling team will provide a num
ber of new competitors for varsity
honors that will make some of the
older team men step lively for their
places.
