## Stanford Summer Propaganda 
### 
'Unyr'W"T!P f !W' t ' K " a PP roac h of summer and the migration homeward,
.4., A J our niinds naturally move ahead to the time when the
"■ I summer months shall he past and the majority will be returning back
to the Farm once again. It is in anticipation of next fall and next
fall's freshmaan class that we, who feel ourselves now part and parcel of Stan
ford life of this college generation and parents in a way of future college genera
tions. Let us face the situation as it is. There is a constant cry that the Stan
ford man of the type that made Stanford is disappearing. There is further
accusation that each freshman class becomes less and less like the freshman
classes of many years ago. Undoubtedly most of this talk is the usual "good
old days" fable type, but there must certainly be some fire where there is so
much smoke.
Knowing that conditions internationally, nationally and locally have worked
hard against the colleges and even exceptionally hard against Stanford, whose
transitional stage seemed inopportunely to have still been going on when war
was declared and college became a secondary consideration, we realize that there
is good excuse for any shortcomings of the present generation. There is, how
ever, even in the face of this excuse, no reason why Stanford men and women
should not definitely start in to work for a return of the "good old days."
We want Stanford men back in college once again; we want men of the
type that made Stanford what it is, but is in danger of no longer being, viz:
the University of the West. Stanford will not regain its lost elements simply
with the return of men from the service. That will only help. Entering classes
■of normal size and caliber will eventually place the University back on the old
scale-
It has been suggested and passed around quietly among the so-called stu
dent leaders, that they are each to seek to bring the best type of men from the
state high schools to Stanford in the fall. But to tell a select group this, is not
enough. Instead, it is a student body duty to get the proper sort of men to
Stanford next fall, and in future years. Everybody knows somebody in high
school who is wanted at Stanford; let us get all these "somebodys" here. It
it not missionary work that is desired, but merely good Stanford propaganda.
It should become a fixed and stern duty upon every Stanford man to draw
to Stanford next fall, at least one man of the type that is wanted at Stanford.
It should become a matter of pride to introduce to the Quadrangle its future
student dominators. Let us get in the movement, making it a student body
undertaking without restrictions or limitations, and bring at least one good man
from the high schools for each old-timer returning in the fall.
