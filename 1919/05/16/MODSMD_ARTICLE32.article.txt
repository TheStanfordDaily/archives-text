### Ruth Lakin, '19 
fIIOMORROW will mark the fifth an*
nual Woman's Field Day to be held
on the farm. This is the one day in
the year when the women take the
leading role in athletics and the men
constitute the audience.
Field Day was originated by the
officers of W. A. A. for the purpose
of promoting interest in women's ath
letics. On January 14, 1915, Miss
Mary Gard, president, announced a
contest in women's sports to be held
that spring on April 24. Miss Gard
and Miss Helen a√ütchelder, '14, were
placed in charge of the day and cap
tains of the various sports were ap
pointed early in February. By the
Ist of April over one hundred women
had signed up, eager to take part in
the nine events, swimming, dancing,
basketball, shell races, volley ball,
gym club stunts, and field sports that
were listed. A group of three judges

were appointed to each event and it
was decided to award numerals to
all point-winners. The big day, which
was to represent the culmination of
work done throughout the year, was
divided into two sections, and since
then this plan has been followed at
succeeding Field Days. The morning
was devoted to contests carried on at
the Roble gymnasium and on the
athletic field; the afternoon to events
on the lake. Points were awarded for
the first, second and third places in
each event, although the major sports
received a larger proportion of credit
than did the minor sports. The sen
iors won the day, tallying 62 points,
the freshmen 31, the juniors 27 and
the sophomores 24.
The second Women's Field Day was
held the following spring on April 29.
It included a number of novel features
in the program, such as disc-throwing,
