### Ruth Lakin, '19 
fIIOMORROW will mark the fifth an*
nual Woman's Field Day to be held
on the farm. This is the one day in
the year when the women take the
leading role in athletics and the men
constitute the audience.
Field Day was originated by the
officers of W. A. A. for the purpose
of promoting interest in women's ath
letics. On January 14, 1915, Miss
Mary Gard, president, announced a
contest in women's sports to be held
that spring on April 24. Miss Gard
and Miss Helen a√ütchelder, '14, were
placed in charge of the day and cap
tains of the various sports were ap
pointed early in February. By the
Ist of April over one hundred women
had signed up, eager to take part in
the nine events, swimming, dancing,
basketball, shell races, volley ball,
gym club stunts, and field sports that
were listed. A group of three judges

were appointed to each event and it
was decided to award numerals to
all point-winners. The big day, which
was to represent the culmination of
work done throughout the year, was
divided into two sections, and since
then this plan has been followed at
succeeding Field Days. The morning
was devoted to contests carried on at
the Roble gymnasium and on the
athletic field; the afternoon to events
on the lake. Points were awarded for
the first, second and third places in
each event, although the major sports
received a larger proportion of credit
than did the minor sports. The sen
iors won the day, tallying 62 points,
the freshmen 31, the juniors 27 and
the sophomores 24.
The second Women's Field Day was
held the following spring on April 29.
It included a number of novel features
in the program, such as disc-throwing,

shot-putting, canoe racing and races
in the new gig. Miss Dorothy Al
brecht, '16, had charge of the day.
The class captains were chosen by
her and they in turn selected teams
from squads according to merit. Two
entrance requirements were made,
that of passing the athletic and the
swimming test. Invitations were is
sued to all members of the faculty;
Palo Alto High School. San Jose Nor
mal, Castelleja and Miss Harker's
School, to come and spend the day.
The sophomores captured the meet,
upsetting all dopsters by taking first
place in crew, basketball and fencing.
Miss Ruth Chandler, '19, was the in
dividual star in the field events of this
year, placing in the javelin throw, shot
put and discus, in which latter event
she was one of three to break the
national intercollegiate women's rec
ord. The third Field Day took place
in 1917, on April 28. Miss Helen
Greening, '17, was captain of the day.
A baseball varsity game with Mills
College and an intercollegiate basket
ball game constituted the unique fea
tures. Miss Estelle Nesson, '18, set
a new national tank record in the 2R
yard dash, clipping one second off the
American championship time, and
proved the greatest point-winner of

the day.
Last year the fourth Field Day was
scheduled on June 2. Miss Ruth
Chandler, '19, being in charge. A pic
nic luncheon was planned and held
in the Women's Club House and a
large number of the "500" were pres
ent. Miss Antonia Hyatt, president
of W. A. A., presented the number of
varsity S's to the winners of the
events. The freshmen were the cham
pions of the day, scoring 22 points in
major and minor sports.
