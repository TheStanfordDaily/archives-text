# PROTEST AGAINST THE EXCESSIVE USE OF POSTAL CARDS
## 
### Katherine Ames, '19 
DON'T you hate 'em—those eternal
and everlasting postal cards? They
belong in the class of public unisances
along with alarm clocks, plentiful per
fumes, and the man who sneezes all
through the concert.
It's deplorable frailty of man
kind—this postal card habit. There are
some humans who only "take" the epi
demic lightly, confining their transgres
sions to an occasional photographic view
of the Grand Canyon, the Champs
Elysce or the Vatican at Rome. My
charitable soul makes allowance for
these minor delinquents, but it writhes
before the more violent cases of postal
'tis—those showcrers of postal cards
from every Bevo junction, gaudy con
ceptions of the Central Park at Waters,
or an aesthetic study of the City Hall in
Oak \ iew. You know the kind, and the
type of the offender.
Oh, there are all kinds and conditions
of postcards. There is the pioneer of
postals, the penny-a-piece card ordained
and sanctioned by the government.
These are the favorites of the "Aunt
Pollys" of the world. On them they
send all the week's news.
"Dear Sue:—
Uncle John's ailin' with the rheumatiz
again, account of tomatoes bein' ripe.
We've had a cold spell here. Shall I
send your flannels? Was it you left the
bottle of iodine on the piano? It burst
and made an awful mess. 1 always
have been leary of patent medicines. A
mustard plaster's good enough for me j
yet and is not nearly so messy 011 the
piano. We think Anny's got prospects.
Her young man's been keepin' company
with her regular. He's put by quite a
bit of money too. Don't forget to send
me the pickle recipe of Jane Kimball's.
Hope you're all well. Polly."
Then there is the birthday postal,
luminous witli its tinsely shimmer—-
palpitating with its tender greeting—
"Happy Birthday, Sweetheart."
And there is the comic postal— hi
larious with such witticisms as "Come
in, the Water's Fine"—or scintillating
under the portrayal of "This is the
Life." They need no further comment.
They screech forth their own flagrancy.
They are the gum-chewers and tooth
pick devotees among post-cards,—you
know what I mean.
But so much for the freaks among
postals—now for the ordinary photo
graphic cards.
To me this most glaring condemna
tion is their lack of individuality. They
are imitative—they are abominable.
They arc about as personal as a tele
phone call from a public booth with a
long waiting line outside—about as
thrilling as a Farmer's Almanac—
Imagine the ecstasy produced by this
card from a soldier in France. "Hello
B. Had lunch on this bridge. G."—
it had traveled nearly four thousand
miles.
And ARE postal cards such time
savers? How about the minutes it
takes to select the card—to read all
those you don't select—to buy stamps—
to boil your message down to the
allotted space? In that time a note
might easily have been written.
But if they are time-savers, what an
insult they are to the recipient. They
say "you're worth just this much of
my time—no more. You're a rather
nice thing, so I'll send you a lil' postal
card."
Ugh ! I loathe 'em !
They fill me with bitter resentment.
They are tantalizing in their suggestion
of the desired letter they might have
been. They are like the sniff of a good
dinner when you are hungry—a ham
sandwich thrown you in place of the
meal you've anticipated.
Some day I shall start a strike among
the mail carriers who have to carry
these tons and tons of waste material.
If the epidemic continues, I may even
suggest that a clause be added to the
League of Nations covenant, under the
domestic wars provision, prohibiting
the purchase, sale, or interchange of
postal cords. Then the millennium will
have arrived and peace will be estab
lished on earth forever.

it had traveled nearly four thousand
miles.
And ARE postal cards such time
savers? How about the minutes it
takes to select the card—to read all
those you don't select—to buy stamps—
to boil your message down to the
allotted space? In that time a note
might easily have been written.
But if they are time-savers, what an
insult they are to the recipient. They
say "you're worth just this much of
my time—no more. You're a rather
nice thing, so I'll send you a lil' postal
card."
Ugh ! I loathe 'em !
They fill me with bitter resentment.
They are tantalizing in their suggestion
of the desired letter they might have
been. They are like the sniff of a good
dinner when you are hungry—a ham
sandwich thrown you in place of the
meal you've anticipated.
Some day I shall start a strike among
the mail carriers who have to carry
these tons and tons of waste material.
If the epidemic continues, I may even
suggest that a clause be added to the
League of Nations covenant, under the
domestic wars provision, prohibiting
the purchase, sale, or interchange of
postal cords. Then the millennium will
have arrived and peace will be estab
lished on earth forever.
DON'T you hate 'em—those eternal
and everlasting postal cards? They
belong in the class of public unisances
along with alarm clocks, plentiful per
fumes, and the man who sneezes all
through the concert.
It's deplorable frailty of man
kind—this postal card habit. There are
some humans who only "take" the epi
demic lightly, confining their transgres
sions to an occasional photographic view
of the Grand Canyon, the Champs
Elysce or the Vatican at Rome. My
charitable soul makes allowance for
these minor delinquents, but it writhes
before the more violent cases of postal
'tis—those showcrers of postal cards
from every Bevo junction, gaudy con
ceptions of the Central Park at Waters,
or an aesthetic study of the City Hall in
Oak \ iew. You know the kind, and the
type of the offender.
Oh, there are all kinds and conditions
of postcards. There is the pioneer of
postals, the penny-a-piece card ordained
and sanctioned by the government.
These are the favorites of the "Aunt
Pollys" of the world. On them they
send all the week's news.
"Dear Sue:—
Uncle John's ailin' with the rheumatiz
again, account of tomatoes bein' ripe.
We've had a cold spell here. Shall I
send your flannels? Was it you left the
bottle of iodine on the piano? It burst
and made an awful mess. 1 always
have been leary of patent medicines. A
mustard plaster's good enough for me j
yet and is not nearly so messy 011 the
piano. We think Anny's got prospects.
Her young man's been keepin' company
with her regular. He's put by quite a
bit of money too. Don't forget to send
me the pickle recipe of Jane Kimball's.
Hope you're all well. Polly."
Then there is the birthday postal,
luminous witli its tinsely shimmer—-
palpitating with its tender greeting—
"Happy Birthday, Sweetheart."
And there is the comic postal— hi
larious with such witticisms as "Come
in, the Water's Fine"—or scintillating
under the portrayal of "This is the
Life." They need no further comment.
They screech forth their own flagrancy.
They are the gum-chewers and tooth
pick devotees among post-cards,—you
know what I mean.
But so much for the freaks among
postals—now for the ordinary photo
graphic cards.
To me this most glaring condemna
tion is their lack of individuality. They
are imitative—they are abominable.
They arc about as personal as a tele
phone call from a public booth with a
long waiting line outside—about as
thrilling as a Farmer's Almanac—
