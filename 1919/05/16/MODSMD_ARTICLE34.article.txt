# FOR A LEAGUE OF HUSBANDS
## 
### Evelyn Gore, '22 
ALONG with the League of Nations,
League to Enforce Peace, and
League of Liberated Germans, why not
organize a "League of Husbands?"
Should loyal Americans go across the
water to free nations and make a last
ing peace when conditions among the
defenseless husbands of the United
States are as distressing as we find
them today? "America first" must con
tinue to be our slogan until internal
agitation has ceased.
Let us look into this vital question.
Here we find Mike Doogan. He is tall
and broad, â€”two hundred and thirty
pounds of muscle and red hair. From
eight o'clock in the morning until five
o'clock at night, he is the lion of the
pick ax corps of the City Street De
partment; but when he enters his apart
ment at five-thirty he ceases to be a
lion and becomes merely the husband of
Mrs. Doogan, a little woman with a
strong will and an aversion to dish
washing. Mike, therefore, does them
for her every evening.
Two miles to the north lives John
Henry McAllister, the self-made mil
lionaire. Mrs. McAllister has always
regretted that be had succeeded in mak
ing himself before she arrived on the
scene. She would very much have
liked to have had a linger in his con
struction. To his stenographer and of
fice boy, J. H. McAllister is an ogre;
to his wife he is the meekest of mor
tals. He loathes dress suits and operas,
but he uncomplainingly does whatever
his wife requests that lie do.
Professor Josiah Andrews is the
head of the zoology department of the
State University. He is a profound

student, an eminent lecturer, and one
of the most distinguished American au
thorities on the axyphigamic bug of
north New Zealand. One afternoon
last summer. Professor Hobock of Ox
ford went to see Professor Andrews.
He found him sitting on his front steps,
waiting until Mrs. Andrews should re
turn from making her calls to unlock
the door for him. So Professor Ho
bock and Professor Andrews sat on the
doorstep until three o'clock, when Mrs.
Andrews arrived and with her the key.
It" Mike Doogan, John Henry Mc-
Allister and Professor Andrews could
be brought together they would 1111
doubtedly be the leading organizers of
tlie League ol Husbands." Other down
trodden men would flock to the stan
dard of freedom. They would band to
gether. forming a league that no wife
could break. They could have confer
ences, committees, and a constitution.
If Mike Doogan wanted to stay in
town some evening and play cards, he
could do so, knowing that the "League
of Husbands," by virtue of superior
strength, would quiet the arguments of
his wife. John Henry McAllister
would then dare to firmly tell Mrs. Mc-
Allister that he absolutely refused to
get into another dress suit as long as
he lived; and Professor Andrews could
march home as early as he liked and
fearlessly unlock his front door with his
own door key.
What a blessing to mankind would
this league be! The importance of
other leagues would fade in comparison
to the great accomplishments of such
a powerful body. American time and
energy can well be expended in its or
ganization.
