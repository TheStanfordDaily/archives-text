# Is a League of Nations Practical?
## 
### Ruth Searcy, '20 
MUCH of the criticism directed
against the League of Nations
idea charges it with being impracti
cal. It is called idealistic and often
named a dream or a creation of the
imagination. And whatever the man
who is practical has to say, he really
cannot refute such assertions, for they
are true.
The League of Nations idea is not,
then, practical. It has never been
tried; it has never been proved; no
one can guarantee success for it. But
at the same time it was never meant
to be practical in the sense that the
world could be sure of its warranted
success. The creators of the idea did
not have that in mind; they knew bet
ter. Neither do the promoters of the
idea feel that it is practical; so do
they also know better. In fact, no
one who has even a general knowl
edge of the proposed world federation
could accuse it of practicality.
The scheme which the delegates at
Paris are working on is essentially a
dream. It is an ideal built for man to
fit himself into and around in the
future. It is not an every-day neces
sity like food or shelter or an4f of the
other practical fulfillments of man's
practical needs. It is a dream built
on a foundation of what is now known
to be true and on the assumption of
what may or may not be proved to be

true. It is the larger building in the
mind of man which he has planned for
his tomorrow. But whether or not. it
will be erected and will stand as his
plan dictates is not now known.
No one can actually prove anything
about the League of Nations. It can
only be judged by smaller unions
which passed from the dream plane to
the reality plane with success. Only
by comparison can its value be esti
mated now; and the fact that it is a
j so much larger combination than any
j before planned, makes it appear the
more stupendous and possibly the
more dangerous.
The question simmers down to a
matter of how much man will dare to
make his dream come true rather
! than to whether or not it is practical.
1 Many great politicians are ready to
dare and to go far to realize this
dream which is the greatest the world
has produced—the League of Nations
dream. Men have dared before and
have succeeded sooner or later; can
we not now allow these men to at
tempt to carry out their scheme? As
far as can be seen, it will work 110
great harm; on the other hand there
is a chance that, as many predict, if
the League of Nations is established,
the greatest permanent and universal
force for good will begin its work in
and for the world of nations.

cannot refute such assertions, for they
are true.
The League of Nations idea is not,
then, practical. It has never been
tried; it has never been proved; no
one can guarantee success for it. But
at the same time it was never meant
to be practical in the sense that the
world could be sure of its warranted
success. The creators of the idea did
not have that in mind; they knew bet
ter. Neither do the promoters of the
idea feel that it is practical; so do
they also know better. In fact, no
one who has even a general knowl
edge of the proposed world federation
could accuse it of practicality.
The scheme which the delegates at
Paris are working on is essentially a
dream. It is an ideal built for man to
fit himself into and around in the
future. It is not an every-day neces
sity like food or shelter or an4f of the
other practical fulfillments of man's
practical needs. It is a dream built
on a foundation of what is now known
to be true and on the assumption of
what may or may not be proved to be

true. It is the larger building in the
mind of man which he has planned for
his tomorrow. But whether or not. it
will be erected and will stand as his
plan dictates is not now known.
No one can actually prove anything
about the League of Nations. It can
only be judged by smaller unions
which passed from the dream plane to
the reality plane with success. Only
by comparison can its value be esti
mated now; and the fact that it is a
j so much larger combination than any
j before planned, makes it appear the
more stupendous and possibly the
more dangerous.
The question simmers down to a
matter of how much man will dare to
make his dream come true rather
! than to whether or not it is practical.
1 Many great politicians are ready to
dare and to go far to realize this
dream which is the greatest the world
has produced—the League of Nations
dream. Men have dared before and
have succeeded sooner or later; can
we not now allow these men to at
tempt to carry out their scheme? As
far as can be seen, it will work 110
great harm; on the other hand there
is a chance that, as many predict, if
the League of Nations is established,
the greatest permanent and universal
force for good will begin its work in
and for the world of nations.
