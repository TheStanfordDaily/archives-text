# Stanford to Enter Ten Men in P.C.C.
## "Reg" Caughey Will Be in Charge of Coaching Track Men 
### 
Stanford's chance of taking first
place in the; Pacific Coast Confer
ence track and field meet, that will be
held in Seattle on May 31, are becom
ing more bright every day. Most of
the men who were ont for track dur
ing the season before the California
meet are working hard to get a chance
to be one of the ten that will be sent
north to meet representatives of the
largest colleges in the west.
The P. C. C. meet is the contest in
which the east judges the athletic re
cords of the west and so as much or
more importance may be attached to the
record that is made by the Stanford
team on the 31st, than the records made
in the California-Stanford dual, or the
P. A. A. meets. Not only athletes from
those colleges in the northern part of
California and the Universities of
Washington and Oregon, but men from
the south, such as Paddock and Schiller,
will provide some swift competition for
the cardinal men.
"Reg" Caughey, who is in charge of
training the men for the meet is ex
pecting to pick his -squad the early part
of next week. The ten big point-winners
of the California and P. A. A. meets
will go to make up the squad that is to
be sent north. Most prominent of these
men will be "Jess" Wells in the sprints
and hurdles. Wells put up a record
for point scoring in the California meet
that will remain unbeaten for some time.
Green is another man who is expected
to win a place on the squad. His work
in the pole-vault, discus, and high jump
have brought many points into the Stan
ford column.
Curtice and Caughey are the men who
in all probability will take care of tiie
weights for Cardinal. Schofield, Need
ham, Teitsworth, Lilly, Westwick, May
nard and Dinkelspiel will be the most
prominent candidates for other places
on the squad that goes north.
Caughey will have complete charge of
the coaching of the men as Coach Evans
has all his time taken up with spring
practice for American No
man will get a chance to make the trip
north unles lie keeps up his work during
practice for tin- next two weeks, was the
announcement that was made by
Caughey last night.
