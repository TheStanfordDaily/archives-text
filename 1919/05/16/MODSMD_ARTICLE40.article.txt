# SHOULD SIMPLIFY ENGLISH SPELLING
## 
### Professor J.S.P. Tatlock 
0 N ! ! , o fthe great needs of the Eng
lish-speaking world is the simpli
fication of our spelling. We do not
always realize this, because most of us
(not all of us!) finished our struggles
with spelling years ago, and have for
gotten them. And it sometimes re
quires observation of the struggles of
the rising generation to enforce on our
minds this cruel waste of time and ef
fort. The writer will never forget
talking on this subject with a literary
friend who was in the habit of orating,
one might almost say i rating, against
a changed spelling. The writer was
amazed and edified one time to find that
he had entirely altered his view and
now was heartily for a change. The
reason was that he had been witnessing
the struggles and waste of time of liis
own son in learning our present spelling.
Among the various reasons why we
should change our spelling are three,
all of them exceedingly practical. First,
for the sake of the foreigner. No other
peoples have so many foreigners settling
among them as the Anglo-Saxon peo
ples. Further and more important, no
language has so good a chance of be
coming the universal language as the
English has; in the ■ °nse, at any rate,
of being the language that every edu
cated person in the world will learn in
addition to his own. This lias been true
for years. But since the war it has
become more true than ever before.
English is easy to learn and has a cos
mopolitan vocabulary. All that stands
in the way of its spread is its unreason
able, irregular, arbitrary spelling.
The second reason is the good of our
children. It is estimated that the
amount of time in school taken in learn
ing spelling is from one to two solid
years. In some other languages, the
study of spelling takes practically no
time at all, and with none does it take
as much as English. It may almost be
said to be time worse tn,. * wasted, for
at a time in life when the reasoning
powers should be trained, they are
thwarted and put to sleep by a system
which contradicts reason. At a time in
the world's history when so much de
pends on the wide spread of education,
the only safe foundation for democracy,
it is nothing less than calamitous that
so much time should be taken from
more important studies. It must not be
forgotten that the time spent on this
subject is in the grade schools, which
are' those which educate the great bulk
of the population, on whose intelligence
the future of the world depends.
The third reason, less important but
still important, is the saving of time and
money. The amount of time, labor, and
material spent by printing, typing, and
writing our unnecessary letters, and
looking up and miss-spell
ings, is impossible Tr< estimate, but
amounts to a vast sum. This will not

[weigh in our minds with the interest of
the children, and the spread of the Engl
ish language through the world enabling
the nations to understand each otlu-r
better; but it is a cause which will weigh
with many practical men and women.
As to just what is the matter with the
English spelling, one could write a whole
book. 1 will content myself with a few
illustrations: There is a street in San
Francisco named "Gough" street. Sup
pose a person who lias never seen that
word before finds it confronting him on
a sign. Shall he pronounce it "Gow"
to rhyme with "bough," or "Goff" to
rhyme with "cough," or "Go" to rhyme
with "though," or "Guff" to rhyme with
"tough," or "Goo" to rhyme with
"through"? There are many words
quite as ambiguous as this. In a nut
shell. when we hear a word spoken we
can not tell how to spell it.and when
we see a word written we can not tell
how to pronounce it. There are from
one-half dozen to a dozen ways of
pronouncing the letter "A," and from
one-half dozen to a dozen ways of writ
ing the sound "A". Somebody once
amused, himself by representing each
sound in the word "potato" in the vari
ous ways justified by spellings of other
words; spelling, for instance, the sound
"T" with "phth" as in "phthisis," and
"O" as in "though." He produced a
word of thirty or fort}' letters. One
could go on and illustrate this sort of
thing almost indefinitely.
The chief arguments against the
simplification of our spelling look very
much less impressive when one examines
them. People sometimes say that to
change our spelling will spoil the his
torical association of words. To say
nothing of the fact that our spelling
often entirely misrepresents the etym
ology of words, how often de we every
really think of the historical associa
tions of a word compared with the num
ber of times we use it? Students of
language should be the ones who would
be most tender of association: yet they
are the very ones who are most zeal
ous of a reform. Anybody who would
preserve for himself the slight pleasure
of recognizing at once the origin of a
word, at the expense of a poor little
slum child who may have at most five
or six years in school, needs to be taken
in hand and converted.
It is sometimes said that if we intro
duce a new system of spelling, the books
at present in use will become worthless.
To this there arc two answers. The
change in spelling which is contemplated
is not so great as to render present
books useless. What is more important
is that most of the books at present
actually in use all over the country have
been printed within ten years. There
fore. if we should change our spelling
tomorrow, in ten years the transition
to the new spelling will, for most people,
have been accomplished A few years
of a somewhat chaofie condition are. of

course, inevitable, but are not a serious
evil. •
These and other arguments are fre
quently heard. The real objection that
most people feel is less often expressed.
It is that "they don't like it," that it
breaks up their habits, and that it mars
their associations with words. This is
a real and legitimate objection. Of
course, we don't like to have our as
sociations spoiled. The question simply
is whether we are not willing to make
a little sacrifice of our convenience and
feelings to attain a great good for our
children and for the world. "Thru"
(for "through"), and "stopt" (for
"stopped"), are in themselves just as
agreeable as the present forms; they
are only disagreeable to one who has
learned the others. It is not necessary
that everyone of all ages shall change
his own spelling. All that anyone need
urge is that everyone shall be influenced
by his reason rather than by his feel
ings. If he is once thoroughly con
vinced that a thing should be, he will
throw his influence on that side when
the time arrives to do it. The time may
come, for instance, when school-boards
will be asked to decide whether a new
form of spelling shall be taught in the
schools. Then is the time for a man
who has become convinced that our
spelling ought to change to throw his
influence in that direction. If a suf
ficient number of adults in the English
speaking world become convinced, a
simplified spelling will be put into the
schools and the change will come almost
painlessly in the course of a generation
or less. The writer would not minimize
the considerations which oppose a change
in our spelling.. There are very real
ones. But he would ask whether they
are not rather a matter of feeling than
of reason. When reason and feeling
are in conflict, which should give way?
Just a few words as to what is being
done in the direction of simpltied spell
ing. The present movement was begun
by the Philological Associations of Eng
land and America some thirty or forty
years ago. led by such men as Charles
Darwin. Albert Tennyson, and the short
hand expert. Pitman. In 1906 the
Simpliiied Spelling Hoard was started to
consider in detail how the reform might
be carried out. It has made many re
commendations which are being more
and more accepted daily by educators,
periodicals, and the general public. So
cieties of scholars and educators are al
most unanimously in favor of its pro
gram. Stanford is well represented in
the council of the Board. Professor
Hempl has long been one of its most
prominent members. Others are Pro
fessors Carruth. Cooper, and Tatlock.
