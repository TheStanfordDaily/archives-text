# ARMY MEN HAVE NOVEL EXPERIENCES IN SIBERIAN EXPEDITIONARY FORCE
## 
### Verner C. Aurell, '18 
Lieutenant Aurell writes from Khabarovsk, Siberia, where he
was sent with troops to preserve order.

HE United States Army Transport
"Logan" started from San Fran
cisco at exactly noon, February 25, 1919.
On board were a number of officers of
the United States Army going to Si
beria to go on duty there witli troops.
1 was one of those on board.
Our first stop on the way to Vladi
vostok, was at Nagasaki. Japan, which
we reached on March 20, after a long
and uncommonly rough voyage. The
trip was more or less uneventful, with
the exception that one night an extra
large wave hit us broadside and broke
into several of the upper deck cabins,
breaking a few windows and wetting
things up in general. One officer was
washed out of his bunk and several
others experienced a good baptism of
salt water and consequently were un
comfortable for the rest of the night.
A French major who was on board,
hurried excitedly into a life preserver
and ran down the deck shouting "sub
marine," but otherwise nearly everyone
was calm, considering the rude and
watery awakening. On March 10 we
didn't exist; crossing the 180 th meridian
we skipped that day; one lieutenant
lost a birthday thereby.
Nagasaki harbor is one of the most
beautiful in tlie world. We sailed in on
an exquisite spring morning. The water
was blue and smooth as glass. Little
Japanese fishing vessels with square
sails hoisted were everywhere. The
little islands here and there and the
hills on the mainland were like gardens]
with their trimmed pine trees, small
houses with now and then a shrine, and
their terraced fields. Every bit of Japan
that can be is cultivated and even the
hillsides arc terraced up so that they
can be irrigated.
As soon as we had reached the inner
harbor and had been pronounced clean
by the solemn-faced Japanese quaran
tine officers, a flock of "sanpans" were
on hand at the ship's gangway to take
us ashore. Most of us didn't lose much
time in crowding into these little boats,
and were sculled about 300 yards to a
little wharf where we were immediately
set upon by a mob of rickshaw men
who presented name cards with num
bers on them and expected us rich
Americans to hire them by the day. A
little fellow, who by his card was "G.
Oishi, No. 2(H)," managed to spirit me
away from the turbulent scene, and
soon, I, with several others, was rid
ing along in the little two-wheeled "ku
ruma" toward the Nagasaki hotel, which
we found was only a few hundred yards
away, and we might just as wvll have
walked. It is a very funny sensation
for a foreigner to ride in a rickshaw
the First few times. Your man-horse
jogs along without ceasing unless lie
comes to a hill; no matter how slight
the uphill work may be, he is sure to
come to a walk there. To warn pe
destrians of bis approach he rings a
little bicycle bell and shouts "Hai. hai"!
I had not ridden in a buggy like that
for a good many years and nearly split
my sides enjoying the sensation.
On reaching the hotel I was met by
my father. I had sent a radiogram to
him from the ship a few days before,
and as a result he came down all the
way from Tokio, about 880 miles away.
My mother and the rest of the family
were not able to come, so I missed see
ing them, much to mv regret.
We had about four days to stay in
Japan. A few of my friends wanted
to take a trip into the interior of Japan
to see some real Japanese sights and
get away from the port with its Eu
ropean improvements. The next day
;fi noon, my father, seven officers and
I took the train for Hiroshima, about
.300 miles away on the main island of
Honshiu. Nagasaki is on Kiushiu
island. The Japanese trains are smaller
than ours and one can travel by first,
second or third class. The class of a
carriage is designated by a stripe of
white, blue or red paint, respectively,
running along the length of the car just
below the windows.
The trip to Hiroshima took about
twelve hours, the train being an express.
We crossed the strait between the tvfo
islands by ferry, from the city of Moji
on one side, to Shimonoseki on the

other. We passed some very beautiful
scenery, especially along the inland sea
of Japan; the further we went the
greater objects of curiosity we were to
the people, as they were not used to
seeing foreigners in uniform, especially
such a large group of them. There
was a diner on the train where we
could get American food; we also
tried a Japanese "banto" or lunch, sold
by boys at the stations. A banto is a
wonderful conglomeration of foods,
mostly unknown and often unpalatable
to the American sense of taste. We also
bought tea, getting a little clay tea-pot
and cup with the tea for live sen, or
two and one-half cents.
It was interesting to watch the Japan
ese passengers. They are so used to
sitting on their knees that many of
them find it uncomfortable to sit on a
bench like we do. This is true especi
ally among the women, most of whom
would get up on the seat and sit on
their knees, facing the wondows. It
nearly breaks my joints even to try it,
but they sit that way for hours.
On reaching our destination about
midnight, we went to a Japanese hotel
or "Yadoya" called the "Kikkawa," to
put up for the night. There is where
our regular Japanese experience began.
First, the house we all had to
take off our shoes. We were then taken
upstairs to our rooms, three rooms for
the nine of us, and tea was brought
for us by the little Japanese maids.
Then, as we wanted to sleep, our beds
were brought in and laid on the floor.
The rooms were all in a row with paper
sliding doors separating them; when
these doors were slid back it was like
one big room, and we all slept in a row
like a lot of dominoes, side by each.
The "tatami" which "overs all Japanese
floors, are straw mats about two inches
thick, covered with matting, and when
a couple of thick quilts are placed on
them we had quite a comfortable bed.
Some of us had to have extra-length
beds made, and the kimonos which they
furnished. us to sleep in were rather
lacking in longitudinal dimensions also,
Everything was spotlessly clean. There
was no furniture in the rooms. The
little maids hustled around until we
were in our beds, and then they left
with their profuse bowing and their
"oyasuminasai,"—(honorable rest well).
After sleeping like bricks, we got up
about 8 o'clock, and the first thing we
fond was tea. Then our breakfasts
were brought up—another strange con
glomeration. There were raw fish,
bamboo root, lotus stems, green onion
pickles, meat scraps, some kind of soup,
rice, tea and other unusual things. Each
person's meal was on a separate table,
a little laquer tray on legs, and we sat
around on mats in a circle, with a little
maid in the center, ready to replenish
our rice bowls or tea cups whenever
they were empty. The only trouble with
us was that we could not get comfort
able 011 the floor, and had to constantly
renew our positions, usually ending tip
by sprawling lengthwise on our sides
and leaning on our elbows. The Japan
ese maids were much amused and kept
up a constant chatter, laughing and ask
ing questions. My father could con
verse with them fluently and 1 managed
to understand most of what was said
and also did some talking in Japanese,
much to their astonishmcn. The other
men had to either use the sign language
or use us as interpreters. Our night's
lodging and breakfast cost us two yen.
or one dollar apiece.
About fifteen years ago I lived in
Hiroshima. But the place was quite
changed and T didn't remember any
thing about it anyway. My father went
to see some friends while the eight of
us started out 011 a tour of inspection
of the city. We certainly were strange
looking creatures to the population. As
we walked down one of the main
streets, about fifteen feet wide11 think,
we were gazed upon from all sides, and
if we ever stopped to look into a store,
immediately crowds would gather and
watch us with wonder and awe. Of
course we felt very conspicuous and
held our heads high and shoulders back,
wishing to appear as true American
soldiers should.
