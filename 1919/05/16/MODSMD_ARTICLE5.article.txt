lers when they commenced their train
ing for the Stanford-California tourna- j
ment which has been scheduled at I
Encina gym on May 23.
Eight Stanford men will wrestle
against the Bruins. These men have I
all been picked for the matches, and
will make weight during the coming!
week. The team will weigh in on {
next Friday afternoon under the direc
tion of Coach Jones and proper au- j
tliorities. Most of the men are close
to their respective weights, hut in one
or two eases the men have taken on
considerable weight and it will take 1
regular training to bring them back
to form for the meet.
Stanford has a strong team, one
that will lose only after a hard fight. I
Their aggressiveness has been shown
in the past events with the San Fran-|
cisco Y. M. C. A. Stanford has sev- 1
eral old men to rely on and new men
that doped for winners. Victory seems
likely for the farm lads in the light
weight classes; the closer bouts, how
ever, will be fought in the heavy
weight and middleweight classes.
