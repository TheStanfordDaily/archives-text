Second tryouts will be held next
Monday at 2 p.m. in the Assembly
Hall and Coach Davis requests that
every one appear as near that time as
possible. Due to the strikes in New
York City, which have delayed all ex
press matter from the east, the manu
script has not as yet arrived. How
ever, it is expected daily and will be
here by Monday. The committee will
determine on the final cast directly
after second tryouts.
"Nothing but the Truth" will offer
several good roles. It is an exceed
ingly clever comedy that will undoubt
edly take well with a Stanford audi
once. The show made its first appear
ance in New York a few seasons ago
and there, as well as elsewhere!
throughout the country, it had met
with great success.
