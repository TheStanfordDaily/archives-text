# "VICTORY IN WAR," POEM, TO BE QUAD FRONTISPIECE
## 
### 
A frontispiece poem, entitled "Vic
tory in War," will appear on the initial
pages of the 1920 Quad, according to
the editors, who state that this contri
bution strives to strike the keynote of
the Junior publication, to set forth the
theme of the hook, and to justify the
name of "Victory" Quad.
This frontispiece poetry is to be
illuminated, Curator Pedro J. Lemos
having personally designed the figures.
It is to he set with an artistic border of
three colors, which will be matched by
a flyleaf of similar design. In this feat
ure, the new Quad is reminiscent of the

1918 yearbook, and follows that prece
dent because of the great favor with
which this characteristic of the older
hook was received.
The H. S. Crocker Company of San
Francisao jegard these double pages |
as being among the best work which j
they have printed, and the University j
Press should be able to equal the work j
of the Crocker Company.
With the present difficulty being ex j
perienced in the printing rooms, the
management expects to have the book
completed about June 1. Barring acci
dent, however, the Quad may go on sale:
before thas time.
