# TO HOLD TRYOUTS FOR STANFORD PAGEANT TOMORROW
## MANY PARTS AVAILABLE Garnett Holme, of Garrett and Garden Players, to Direct Production 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon in the Assembly
Hall, tryouts for the Stanford pageant
"Service" will be held. Mr. Garnett
Holme, who lias been secured to direct
the production has announced that
owing to the massive scale upon which
it is to be undertaken, there are no less
than 300 men's and 100 women's parts
available, and a large amount of campus
talent is desired to make a success of
this undertaking.
The action is divided into three
epochal parts, in each of which there
will be a large cast and chorus. The
music is planned as a drawing feature
to the production, and men's voices will
be in demand, particularly. The com
mittee is expecting the best of campus
talent to try out, and announces that
all tryoutees must be at the Assembly
Hall tomorrow at the time announced.
Director Holme is particularly anxious
to see those who desire to be in the
choruses.
Throughout the entire action there
are many important roles so that campus
talent is assured of a chance to be rep
resented in the cast of this production.
Present plans for the pageant call for
its production on the north terrace of
the Quad, on the night of June 14th. As
this will be after the final examinations,
the committee has arranged so that the
rehearsals will not interfere with pre
paration for the examinations.
The committee lias been particularly
fortunate in its choice of a director in
Mr. Garnett Holme. He is a graduate
of Oxford University in England, and
a leader of the Little Theater movement
in San Francisco. At the present time
he is connected with the Garnett and
Garden players of San Francisco, of
which Miss Margery Bailey of the
English department was at one time a
member. By those who are acquainted 1
with Mr. Holme, it is considered a pri
vilege to work under him, and the fact
that he is to direct the pageant assures
not only a large attendance at the final
production, but a capable and well-train
ed cast.
Following the pageant the committee
is planning to give a dance to which
the cast will be invited, and this is in
itself a drawing card.
The pageant, which is the first of its
kind ever attempted at Stanford, will
be one of the events of Memorial
Week, in honor of Stanford students
and faculty returning from the war.
