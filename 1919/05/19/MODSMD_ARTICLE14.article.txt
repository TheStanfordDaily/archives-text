# WOMEN, RULES AND PICTURES

-— — we could once leave certain subjects die out and then forget
them, there is 110 doubt but 'that the name of Stanford would
-~v B be raised to a higher plane than before. Hut unfortunately
■ some of these subjects seeni to particularly delight in recur-
J ring at most inopportune moments. The annual woman's field day
held last Saturday brought to light once again one of our constantly
recurring bogies, viz., narrow-mindedness in the attitude of the Uni
versity authorities towards the Stanford women in their zealous guardianship
over the "500."
We have seen the evils of this close regulation and stipulation by rule and
letter what should be done and what should not be done. We were hoping
that to some extent the women of the University were commencing to be treated
in a more liberal fashion as liberal idea sadvanced. Such hopes were rudely
shattered when at the field day last Saturday definite and arbitrary announce
ment was made that there were to be no pictures taken of the event. Thus
denial was made not alone to purely news organs such as the daily papers, but
likewise to the educational and news film people who were down here for
that purpose.
It is indeed unfortunate, this idea that keeps the Stanford women immune
from the gaze of moving picture theater spectators just because the women are
engaging in healthy outdoor pastime. We should be infinitely prouder of our
women's field days than our Junior Proms or Sophomore Cotillions, and.we
should be proud of letting non-university people learn of the active outdoor
sports engaged in by the women of the University.
If such unnecessary restrictions really accomplished a good purpose we
would not complain; but where the beneficent results arc, we fail to see. We
know that there is a prevailing opinion that causes outsiders to laugh at the
close restriction upon grown women, and causes them to exploit to their
advantage any time when some event breaks beyond the pale of regulation and
causes outsiders to look upon, what would elsewhere be only an ordinary
event, as a Stanford scandal.
It is purely a wrong attitude to look upon the women as something sacredly
immune from outside world. We do not wish to sec Stanford women exploited
to outsiders, but we do not like to see them placed in the same guarded sphere
as the young boarding school girl. California and Mills College in the West,
Vassar, Bryn Mawr, and other institutions in the East permit their field days
to be known abroad. Why, then,, the hermitage of the Stanf6rd women?
