# FIRST FRESHMAN HOP WELL ATTENDED; NETS SUM OF $2.00
## 
### 
Green programs, green punch, and
decidedly "green" decorations fea
tured the freshman hop given under
the auspices of the 1922's committee
of six last Saturday evening at En
ema Hall. The dance was well at
tended, considering the many other
campus dances on the same night.
The spirit exhibited at the freshman
event was well worth comment, and
if the hall was not crowded, the dance
proved to be "an unqualified success."
Nearly one hundred couples danced
to the magic strains of the Peninsula
jazz orchestra, which was imported
from San Jose. Music from the latest
song hits brought considerable com
ment. The proceeds of the hop did
not fulfill the expectations of the first
year class, and only resulted in the
deposit of two dollars in the freshman
class coffers.
The freshman dance this year was
the first held at Stanford for a num
ber of years, and according to con
versant opinion, the dance will set a
pace for fufture freshmen hops.
