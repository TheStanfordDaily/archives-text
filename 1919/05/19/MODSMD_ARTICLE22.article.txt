A committee, of the following women
has been organized under the auspices
of the Y. W. C. A. Social Service Com
mittee to provide food and entertain
ment for the merchant marine men at
Camp Fremont: Evelyn Flowers. '21,
chairman; Ellen Eason, '21, Dorothy
Doyle. '22, Dorothy Hall, '21. Ocle Hel
vie, '19, Euphemia Rochet. '21, Marion
Mauzy, '22, and Virginia C. McNaugh
ton, '22.
General opinion has been circulated
that all men were'discharged from Camp
Fremont, but at the present time sixty
merchant marine men from the San
Francisco hospital are quartered there,
and more overseas men are expected to
arrive daily. The committee has ar
ranged to supply the men with sand
wiches and cakes every Sunday after
noon, and Miss Evelyn Flowers, who
was in charge of the entertainment pro
gram last quarter will again see that
all available campus talent is secured
in giving amusement to the marine men.
Much good work was accomplished
along these lines last quarter and the
men are extremely appreciative of the
efforts made in their behalf bv the wo
men of Stanford.
