# FRATERNITIES WILL BE FINED FOR SLOW PAYMENT OF TAX
## 
### 
Hv a recent ruling given out by the
office of Justus S. Wardell, Collector
of Internal Revenue of the San Fran
cisco District, all fraternal organiza
tions of a nature similar to college fra
ternities are under the Internal Revenue
Law of 1917, subject to a tax of ten
per cent on all initiation fees or dues
in excess of $12 per year. The law went
into effect on November 1. 1917, and the
tax was to have been paid at the end
of each month in which such fees were
paid to the fraternities. The non
payment of this tax subjects the or
ganization to a penalty of 50 per cent of
the tax.
The law, which was a part of tht:
government's program for financing the
nation during the war, has been super
seded by the law of 1919, which went
into effect ,on April 1. ttndcr Ibis
later law, the fraternities arc especially
exempt from any war tax, but this does
not free them from payment on fees
collected during the period from No
vember 1, 1917 to March 31, 1919.
As ret the government has not taken
active steps to enforce the law among
some colleges, but, acocrding to reports
from the University of Oregon, the fra
ternities have had to pay the tax and
are also being held for the penalty be
cause of failure to comply with the law.
