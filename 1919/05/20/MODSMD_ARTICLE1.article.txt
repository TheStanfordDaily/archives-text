### 
WANTED

ford-California wrestling tournament
next Friday evening, at the Encina
Gymnasium. Cheering and routing bad
ly needed."
This last-minute news comes as a re
sult of a communication to Coach Jones
and Athletic Director Knollin, in which
it was asked if women might attend
the annual intercollegiate meet this year.
Word was immediately returned that
the women of the University were cor
dially invited to attend the meet, and
that a "real" professional tourney would
he in store fojr them.
Wrestlers Not Picked
Practice has continued according -to
training rules and the freshmen and
varsity wrestlers are rounding well into
shape. The teams, though recently an
nounced as picked for the intercollegiate
meet, may possibly be changed or alter
ed for the contest Friday night, accord
ing to Coach Jones. He has been trying
his men in different weights, putting
the most effective wrestlers in the most
responsible positions. The freshman;
team will probably include a number of
new men out for the sport. Part of
last quarter's material did not show up
the spring quarter, and accordingly, men
out for the first time will be chosen to
fill the lirst year ranks.
Egami Coaches
Coach Jones absented himself from
the wrestling squad yesterday and left
the training in the hands of Stanford's
all-star wrestler. Egami. Effective wing
locks, chancerees, and body scissor holds
were part of Egami's training chedule.
Practice bouts were fought for a few
minutes and then Egami worked for a
while, showing the team men where
they were weak. Egami instilled a fight
ing spirit in his men yesterday after
noon, and with the coach's "give 'em
the ax" spirit, the Stanford wrestlers
should bid fair to win.
Andrews Sends Team
Coach Andrews of the University of
California will bring down eight varsity
wrestlers and eight freshmen mat men,
according to a letter just received from
Berkeley. It was first decided that no
freshman matches would be fought this
year, but Coach Jones of Stanford in
sisted on a first-year meet. California's
aggregation is not a particularly strong
one, although they have several point
men that have had some little experi
ence in high school work. There are
no "big winners" on the. Berkeley team,
according to reports.
Jones Dopes Meet
Coach Jones is optimistic, though not
certain. He lias carried a confident
smile about him during the past few
days and feels that he is backed up in
his opinion by a strong individual star
wrestling team. Jones is feeling his
i way in the heavy weight divisions, but
is sure of the light weights. In the
heavy weight classes Stanford's hard
est lighter. Bunds, has been placed in
the light-heavy weight class, which will
probably decide the ownership of the
meet. "A loss of the intercollegiate
meet will not be due .to undertraining
■or over confidence." states Coach Jones,
"but to the superior strength of the
up-bay Bruinitcs."

noon, and with the coach's "give 'em
the ax" spirit, the Stanford wrestlers
should bid fair to win.
Andrews Sends Team
Coach Andrews of the University of
California will bring down eight varsity
wrestlers and eight freshmen mat men,
according to a letter just received from
Berkeley. It was first decided that no
freshman matches would be fought this
year, but Coach Jones of Stanford in
sisted on a first-year meet. California's
aggregation is not a particularly strong
one, although they have several point
men that have had some little experi
ence in high school work. There are
no "big winners" on the. Berkeley team,
according to reports.
Jones Dopes Meet
Coach Jones is optimistic, though not
certain. He lias carried a confident
smile about him during the past few
days and feels that he is backed up in
his opinion by a strong individual star
wrestling team. Jones is feeling his
i way in the heavy weight divisions, but
is sure of the light weights. In the
heavy weight classes Stanford's hard
est lighter. Bunds, has been placed in
the light-heavy weight class, which will
probably decide the ownership of the
meet. "A loss of the intercollegiate
meet will not be due .to undertraining
■or over confidence." states Coach Jones,
"but to the superior strength of the
up-bay Bruinitcs."
WANTED
up the row to attend the annual Stan
ford-California wrestling tournament
next Friday evening, at the Encina
Gymnasium. Cheering and routing bad
ly needed."
This last-minute news comes as a re
sult of a communication to Coach Jones
and Athletic Director Knollin, in which
it was asked if women might attend
the annual intercollegiate meet this year.
Word was immediately returned that
the women of the University were cor
dially invited to attend the meet, and
that a "real" professional tourney would
he in store fojr them.
Wrestlers Not Picked
Practice has continued according -to
training rules and the freshmen and
varsity wrestlers are rounding well into
shape. The teams, though recently an
nounced as picked for the intercollegiate
meet, may possibly be changed or alter
ed for the contest Friday night, accord
ing to Coach Jones. He has been trying
his men in different weights, putting
the most effective wrestlers in the most
responsible positions. The freshman;
team will probably include a number of
new men out for the sport. Part of
last quarter's material did not show up
the spring quarter, and accordingly, men
out for the first time will be chosen to
fill the lirst year ranks.
Egami Coaches
Coach Jones absented himself from
the wrestling squad yesterday and left
the training in the hands of Stanford's
all-star wrestler. Egami. Effective wing
locks, chancerees, and body scissor holds
were part of Egami's training chedule.
Practice bouts were fought for a few
minutes and then Egami worked for a
while, showing the team men where
they were weak. Egami instilled a fight
ing spirit in his men yesterday after
noon, and with the coach's "give 'em
the ax" spirit, the Stanford wrestlers
should bid fair to win.
