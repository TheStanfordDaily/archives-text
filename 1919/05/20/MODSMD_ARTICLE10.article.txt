tirely. There is consequently only
one day of grace remaining for late

the statement.

larger than the Blue and Gold of Cal

previous publication of either uni
versity. There are more than 460
pages of solid reading matter and cuts
without advertisement in the new
book, and more than 500 pages in all.

the sorrorlty "razz" section of the
book, and also on the "inside dope"
contained in the josh department. In
side Information, it is said, will be
divulged throwing light on many ca n
pus mysteries heretofore seen only
from the exterior.
