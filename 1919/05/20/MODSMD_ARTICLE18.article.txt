# DYING OUT

Student Control is to die 'out or to revive ought to he decided
IjISP before the summer months aud finals drive all outside ideas
" away. We have been playing with this problem of Student
I "n* Control, dabbling with it, attempting to raise enthusiasm
■ 4lb j f° r *t» and then sitting idly by to watch what little enthusiasm there
was created disappear.
Student Control from a problem has developed into a decided uncertainty.
The ieast that can be done is to make the problem of Student Control a vital
problem again or make it disappear for the time through some decided action.
To leave it die out for lack of enterprise would not alone be a decided defeat
to Student Control but an assertion that Stanford students are in many respects
unable to manage affairs of importance and problems involving difficulties when
they do appear.
The Committee on Student Control seems to have failed in its purpose.
Or rather there is no proof that it did not fail. It was originally the committee's
duty to investigate the problem from all angles and then to either present some
plan or to at least inform the-proper authorities, in this case the Student Council,
of the feasibility of Student Control or the advisability of its readoption in some
revived form.
The committee has been thorough in investigation, we are told, but appar
ently it has not seen fit to make some representation of what work it has
actually done. We know that the committee was responsible for the Student
Control questionaire idea, but we have not been told with .what success this
idea was met on the campus. Student Control probably still concerns the com
mittee, but that body most decidedly has failed in bringing some tangible plan
or presentation up to the student body.
We do not know with what favor Student Control would be met on the
campus, but we do know that there can be no doubt but that the committee
appointed to investigate the matter most certainly should make some public
utterance of the investigations that it has undertaken. We may favor Student
Control or we may be with those who do not uphold it, but we most certainly
are against letting the matter just simmer out and miserably fail. ,
