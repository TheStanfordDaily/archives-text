Dear Editor:
We women are worried as to what
will becprae of these words after
July 1:
Lit
Jag
Tight
Tanked
Pickled
Mellowed
Pie-eyed
Besotted
Inebriated
Bun
Pull
Soused
Corned
Stewed
Ossified.
Half-shot
Paralyzed
Spifflicated
And these words, too, dear editor:
Dead to the world
Three sheets in the wind
Halt'-seas over
Pull as a goat
ANXIOUS CO-ED.
Editor, Daily Palo Alto:—
For some months I have been read
ling in successive editions of your paper
! the letters of Henry to Pa. For as long
a time I have been waiting for them to
cease, but lie writes on. The letters
at first were interesting, and to some
degree clever, and I admit that they
were a successful innovation. However,
too much of a thing must necessarily
become tiresome.
Far be it from me to dictate the policy
of the paper, but this one affair may
have escaped your attention. Would it
he possible for you *o restrain the fic
titious inclinations of the young re
porter?
An Interested Reader.
Nome, Alaska, April 27. 1919.
Editor D. P. A.:—
I suppose you will be rather surprised
jto hear from one who has been so long
a "has been." It is now some ten years
since I has been able to visit the "farm,"
but my heart still retains the same
warm spot for it that it always did.
T am now engaged in the mining busi
ness up here, and 1 seldom get down,
but I always welcome any bits of stray
Stanford news that I get.
About a week ago 1 received a copy
of the D. P. A. and it is the first copy
I have seen in over a year. This par
ticular copy happened to include the
magazine section and this is the object
of my letter. I wish to send a little
not of appreciation for what h&s evi
dently meant diligent work on the part
of the D. P. A. staff in making a suc
cess—namely the magazine section. Fn
fact the whole paper is good, better.
I'm afraid I'll have to admit, than when
I was on the staff, about seventeen years
ago. But this magazine section par
ticularly caught my eye, and I know
that other alumnae and students, as well
as myself, must appreciate this addition
to the D. P. A.
Best regards,
J. W. Bloke, '02.
P. S.:—Please send the I). P. A. reg
ularly to enclosed address.
