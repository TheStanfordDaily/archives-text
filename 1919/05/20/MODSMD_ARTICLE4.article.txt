WANTED —Information that will
lead to the conviction of the culprit
that maliciously mutilated our gar
bage can. If you know anything, see
Miss Alphie Oh.
Miss Alphie Oh claims that the Oh
Pie sisters declared dividends on
house receipts last week and invested
in a new receptacle for the holding
of the unused portions of the evening
meals. Two days later, Miss Alphie
discovered that the can had been
punctured.
Whether the cook threw one of his
biscuits through the can, or one of
the sisters heaved a shoe towards it
cannot be determined. Present indi
cations point the blame to a neigh
bor 011 the hill, who is said to have
been disappointed in his loVe affairs
of that evening, and attempted to use
a six-shooter on himself. The Theta
Xi said that they heard a shot ring
out in the air that evening, but they
also heard the stealthy murmurs of a
cat immediately following.
Private detective wanted.
