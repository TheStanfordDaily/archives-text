# SERVICE BOARD TO DISCUSS PLANS FOR CONVALESCENT HOME
## 
### 
New plans for the convalescent Home,
now maintained in the Acacia House,
will be discussed this evening at a meet
ing of the Service Board, in the Club
House at 7 :30. So far the convalescent
home has been even more of a success
than the Service Board had hoped for.
Miss Yaal Stark, 'IS, in charge of the
home, is anxious that women on the
campus aid in amusing the children
during the afternoons. Anybody is
welcome who wishes to aid in the Stan-
Tor clinic work.
Several new children will come to
the home during this week. The lirst
days away from home are usually dif
ficult for the children, on account of
homesickness. Therefore, the Service
Board is anxious that a> many women
as possible differ their assistance in
taking the children walking.
All Blind Relief boxes should be in
at the Club House by this time. Definite
reports as to the success of the cam
paign will be made at the meeting to
night.
