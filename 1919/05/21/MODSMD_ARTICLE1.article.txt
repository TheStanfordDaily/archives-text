# FINAL TEAM AGAINST U.S.C. ORATORS IS CHOSEN
## TO DEBATE HERE MAY 29 C.O. Fenlason, 19, L.B. Martin, '22, and R.C. Fisher, 22â€”Team 
### 
C. O. Fenlason, 19, R. C. Fisher, '22,
and L. B. Martin, '22, were the success
full tryoutees in the forensic elimination
contest yesterday at which they were
chosen to make up the team which
will meet the debaters from the Uni
versity of Southern California
The present composition of this team
is somewhat contrary to the foregoing
"dope" on its makeup, as it is com
posed entirely of men new to inter
collegiate debating circles, and its com
bined power as a forensic machine is
therefore an unknown quantity.
Fenlason is the oldest man of the
combination, and though he has -never
taken part in debate against an outside
university, he is well known as a
speaker on the campus, and was for
merly president of the Euphronia De
bating Society. " An effective rebuttal
yesterday afternoon chinched his posi
tion as leader of the trio.
Fisher made his place by a carefully
planned and well delivered main specch,
and according to the judges was first
in the presentation of principal argu
ment.
Martin also earned his rating by a
well worked out principal speech.
Professors M. A. Wildman, A. M.
Catlicart, and Coach M. L. McClintock
acteil as judges of the tryouts, and
were all agreed as to the selection of
the three men.
McClintock is familiar with the abil
ity of the debaters' from their squad
work during the past month, and states
that, though not possessing the usual
amount of experience, the combination
will be well able to cope with their
southern opponents at the Stanford As
sembly I lull on Thursday, May 29.
Xo word has yet been received from
Los Angeles concerning the selection
of the judges.
This debate was won last year by the
University of Southern California at
Los \llgeles. Nothing is now known
as to the comparative strength of the
present teams. The question this year
advocates that the federal government
should provide employment for surplus
labor, and Stanford is upholding the af
lirmative.
