# CALIFORNIA WILL SEND A STRONG TEAM TO P.C.C. MEET
## TEAM TO NUMBER EIGHT Sprott Will Probably Be the Largest Point-Winner Against Stanford 
### 
With the announcement of the inten
tion of the Student Council to send a
track team to the Pacific Coast Con
ference track and field meet at Seat
tle on May 31st, comes the report that
the A. S. S. U. of the University of
California has decided to also enter a
team in the meet.. Of all the six teams
that have heen entered in the meet,
the California squad seems to be the
most dangerous rival of the Cardinal
runners for first place.
Coach Christie has picked a six-man
squad from the team that met the Car
dinal men on the oval in the Stanford-
California duel and the P. A. A. meet#
to make the northern trip. Cantelow
will appear in the sprints; Sprott and
Roach will do the distances; Peterson,
captain-elect of the 1920 team, will en
ter in the pole vault and the javalin;
Majors will put the shot and throw th<i
hammer and the discus; Sterling in the
pole vault and broad jump and Waltz
in the half mile, hammer, and low hur
dles will make up the rest of the team.
Wells ought to have little trouble beat
ing Cantelow in the sprints as he did
in the California meet. Sprott is the
most dangerous man on the California
squad. Me should be good for at leasl
twelve points. Sterling and Majors are
both good second string men who will
try to beat out several Cardinal men
for seconds and thirds. Peterson is not
thought to be dangerous even though he
was able to beat Green out for first in
the pole in the duel meet.
The Stanford squad is rapidly round
ing into condition with the workouts
on the track every night. In a short
time Caughey expects to name the men
that will make the trip north.
