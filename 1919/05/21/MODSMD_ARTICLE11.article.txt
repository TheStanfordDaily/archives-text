# STANFORD WRESTLERS READY FOR TOURNEY
## Big Crowd Should Witness Stanford-California Meet Friday 
### 
Extensive preparations are being made
at the Encina gymnasium to accom
modate the large crowd that is ex
pected for the annual Stanford-Califor
nia wrestling matches on Friday night
at 7:30. Bleachers will be placed in
the large gym hall for the spectators
Wrestling matches have been of minor
importance at Stanford for a number of
years, but the possibility to put this sport
ou a par with other sports at Stanford
is present this year .according to Coach
Jones.
The battle between the Rlue and Gold
and the Cardinal on Friday night will
be a close fought one, and in all prob
ability it will be the winning of one
weight division that will decide the
championship. Following the slight argu
ments that the coaches of the two institu
tions had in trying to set a date for the
intercollegiate meet, both teams have set
to work to win. Each one, according to
reports, is out to take the honors. Coach
Jones is putting his men through in
tensive drill each night this week and
expects to have his men in a fighting
trim on Friday night.
The intercollegiate tournament will be
called promptly at 7:30 at the main hall
in the Encina Gymnasium.
