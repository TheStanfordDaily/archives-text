# SWEATERS AND THE COUNCIL
## 
### 
IKI meeting of the Student Council last evening did much to
vf clear up some matters that have been in doubt for the
Ik X past several weeks. The matter of awarding varsity sweaters to
winners of them instead of only the intangible war policy right to
wear them most certainly meets with general approval around the campus. The
attitude taken by the Council was one that showed willingness to comply with
the general student body sentiment on this and allied subjects. Awarding gold
baseballs to the winfl? rs °112 the baseball series against California is well in
keeping with tradition of a attitude towards victorious varsities.
Ihe Student Council In these matters acted to the best of its abilities and
to the utmost of the powers entrusted to it. In putting into active effect the
awarding of sweaters, the Student Council needs the cooperation of the Hoard
of Athletic Control and of the student body. The Board of Athletic Control
can provide for the furnishing of sufficient money to defray the cost of pur
chasing the sweaters. Furthermore, the student body can assist in financing
supporting student body dances and other undertakings that may take place
within the remaining weeks of the quarter.
The Student Council cannot call its work complete for the year until it
finally determines the status of the varsity letter at Stanford. The Council
must insist upon some report from bodies appointed to investigate the• situation,
and must decide before the football season further complicates matters upon
what men in each sport are to be entitled to wear the block S. The Council
must take it upon itself to further determine exactly what status Rugby is to
have in the athletic policy of the University. These matters cannot be over
looked now when the perspective for clear reasoning is better than the close
proximity of the fall quarter.
