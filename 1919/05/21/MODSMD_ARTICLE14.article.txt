THE FIRST DAILY PALO ALTO
September 20, 1892, is a memorable
date in the history of Stanford jour
nalism, for it was at 1:30 a.m. of that
day that the"Daily Palo Alto" first
came into active existence.
The first proof copy ever made of
the Daily is still intact and is kept in
Volume I of the bound D. P. A.'s in
the Stanford library. This impression
was taken in the offices of the Red
wood City Democrat, where the Daily
was published for the first two weeks
of its existence. This first front page
proof is accompanied by a statement
to the effect that it was the first im
pression and is signed by Carol
Smith, first associate editor.
In this early paper the cut of the
pine tree is lacking at the top of the
sheet, the words "The Daily Palo
Alto" are printed in simple black let
ters. But the most curious thing is
the absence of large front-page heads.
Articles began close to the top of the
page with titles in only slightly eh-

Berry, who is at present with the Her
cules Powder Company. She will
speak to the women in the afternoon
on the requirements for successful
work in chemical laboratories.
Bacteriological laboratory work will
be presented by Professor Clara S.
Stoltenberg, a member of the faculty.
Mrs. Elizabeth Snell, appoinment sec
retary of the University, will speak
on qualifications for professional
work. Mrs. Snell has been concerned
with this problem for some time and
has had valuable experience in plac
ing people in positions for which they
are mofet fitted. Some of the require
ments which she has found necessary
for the successful woman she will
give as advice.
Other speakers are scheduled for
both morning and afternoon, and va
rious phases of these questions will
be discussed. An effort is being made
by the vocational committee to have
a speaker on journalism, a subject of
interest to a large number of Stan
ford women.
