# STORY-TELLING HOUR ARRANGED FOR HOME
## E. ALLEN, '20, IN CHARGE Plans For Convalescent Home Arranged by Women's Board 
### 
Among other forms of amusement for
the children of the Convalescent 1 lomc,
a storv-tellin'g hour after dinner will be
inaugurated during this week under
the direction of Miss Eleanor Allen,'2o.
I he plan was outlined and adopted last
night at a meeting of the Women's
Service Board. All campus women who
are interested in the work are asked
to report to Miss Allen at once and the
women will be assigned to report imme
diately after dinner on certain even
ings. It is the hope of the committee
that this form of entertainment will
prove most successful among the chil
dren.
Extensive plans for the summer work
in the Stanford Clinic and most par
ticularly the Convalescent Home, were
discussed at length by the board. Un
der the direction of Miss Kathleen
Sealey, '19, the summer work of the
home will be carried on by women on
the campus. The plan at present does
not depend upon volunteering. Some
payment for the work of caring for the
children can be paid by the Service
Board. All women who would be in
terested in the work should report to
Miss Sealey immediately so that those
women who will do the same work
may be chosen from as large a group
as possible. Two women will serve at
one time and may be worked in shifts
during the summer quarter.
A meeting of the Junior War Board
will be held before the end of the week
at which definite plans will be formu
lated to improve the waiting room for
the children at the Stanford Clinics in
San Francisco. Everything possible
will be done to make the children hap
pier who arc waiting to be examined by
the clinic.
All blind relief boxes should be turned
in to the' Women's Clubhouse imme
diately. There are a number of fra
ternity houses who have failyed to re
port as yet. The committee is anxious
to make a full report as soon as possible.
