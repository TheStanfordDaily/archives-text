# Many Professions for Women to be Discussed May 24
## 
### 
The second Vocational Conference;
on opportunities other than teaching j
open to women, which will be held all
day Saturday, provides for a wide va
riety of speeches. The discussion will
be comprehensive and will include the
fields of business, industry, social
service, nursing, medicine, chemistry.
The developing possibilities in de
partment store education will be pre
sented by Miss Mabel Scholpbach, ed
ucational director of Hale & Co. in
San Jose. This is a new line of work
which carries with it large opportuni
ties for advancement.
Clinical social service work will be
represented by Mrs. Katherine 1. Bar
nett of San Francisco. Mrs. Barnett
is the social service director of the
Stanford Clinics in the city and it is
through her capable supervision that
the Stanford Women's Service Board
is able to reach so large number of
needy people. Mrs. Burnett's experi
ence in this work makes her especi
ally fitted to give advice.
Women in chemical laboratories are j
rapidly taking the place of men, and
the openings which exist for them are
well understood by Miss Jessie V.
larged print.
The staff of the paper was com
posed cf an editor-in-chief, twenty as
sociate editors and a business man
ager.
Throughout the paper are little
items which are amusing today. For
instance, "Mrs. Washburn, with Miss
Hardy of Oakland, has charge of the
work of conditioned students." Per
haps "Chappie" would favor the re
introduction of a department for
"flunks" in charge of a Miss "Some
body."
It seems that the paper was estab
lished in the face of a cry to the

effect that the small size of Stanford
made such a thing absurd.
The editor, John C. Capron, voiced
the progressive spirit of Stanford
when he remarked in his first edi
torial, "True it is that the Daily will
not make a great university, hut just
as true it is that the Daily is one of
the signs of a great university."
