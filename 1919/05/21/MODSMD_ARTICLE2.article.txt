# Sahara Desert May Not Move Here July 1
## 
### 
The (dry goods) emporium located
on the corner of Powell and Ellis
streets, according to yesterday's re
ports, may still continue to exist with
out selling ice cream and soda water
after July 1. President Wilson, in liis
message to Congress, was opposed to
the national prohibition amendment,
recently passed.
How swift the time goes by,
It nears July the first.
If prohibition wins,
How shall we quench our thirst?
The drys have made their stand,
A water-wagon fort,
We-11 soon see no more ships,
There won't be any port.
The athletes, too, will have
No baseball games to play,
For high-balls can't be served,
The legal lights will say.
The aviators now.
Will never have to stop,
Once safe up in the sky,
They dare not take a drop.
All prize-fights will be barred,
For that just take my hunch,
No more fights we will see,
For pugs lose all their punch.
The wets and drys still fight,
And neither will give in,
But, why, oh, why I ask.
Let prohibition win.
