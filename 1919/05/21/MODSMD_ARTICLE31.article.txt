# FRENCH CLUB PLANS AN EVENING OF PLAYS
## 
### 
Roth faculty members and students
will be in the cast of the "Thorny
Forget-Me-Not" which is to be pre
sented in the Little Theater tomorrow
evening by the Stanford French Club.
Professor (i. Grojean, who is coaching
the production, also takes the leading

part of "Deaf and Deaf," the otlier one
act playlet that will be produced. From
the evidence of the rehearsals both
these plays are replete with sparkling
comedy.
This evening of French plays is the
second that lias heen held by the local
Cercli? FraiiQais. In the one given
previously, about two years ago, over

two hundred dollars was netted for the
French Orphans' Fund. This same
benefit is the purpose of tomorrow even
ing's show and it is hoped by the club
that even a large amount may be col
lected. A large ticket sale has already
been held, but many good seats are left
and may be obtained from any member
of the French Club or at the door.
