# Jordan Speaks On Future of Ireland
## Home Rule Only Solution to Irish Problem Says Speaker 
### 
"There has always been an Irish prob
lem since the clays of King William of
Orange, and this problem can only be
settled by giving Ireland some kind of
home rule," said Dr. David Starr Jor
dan, in a lecture on "The Future of
Ireland" last evening in the Little
Theater.
"The history of Ireland is for Eng
land to remember, and Ireland to for
get," he said, quoting Sir Horace Plun
kett. Dr. Jordan then discussed the ill
treatment which Ireland has received
from England since its early conquest.
"Ireland has been exploited by the Eng
lish, but they don't want a redress of
grievances, they want freedom," he
stated.
"There is only one solution to the
breach between England and Ireland,
and that is some sort of home rule.
This is growing harder every day. At
one time a committee was chosen to
consider steps for this freedom, but
as the committee did not include any
Irish, the people of Ireland believed
that it was established to give them re
dress, and not freedom, so it came to
nothing.
"People who cannot goven themselves
are the very ones to do it. They would
at least govern in their own interests
which would be better than outside
government, in the interests of Etig
land could ever be, and it would give
them a love for order. If Ireland could
be given a government such as Canada
and Australia have, it would weld them
closer to Great Britain. It would change
the hatred which the Irish bear towards
the English to friendship."
