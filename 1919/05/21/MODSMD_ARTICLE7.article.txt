"dean" of the D. P. A. press, ceased
his connection with the University Press
Palo Alto. Mr. Porter was one of the
printers of the"Daily" of twenty-five
years ago and has been connected with
the paper continuously for six years.
I-ormer D. P. A. editors and writers
will remember "Hugh" Porter as the
man with the historic derby hat and the
unquenchable craving for "copy." In
times of stress such as freshmen and
women's editions, it has been "Hugh"
who came forward and finally put out
the paper.

working printer can fall into is a job on
a college paper. But "Hugh" has al
ways stood up under the strain man
fully. The managing editor regrets that
he will no longer have "Hugh" to
smoke his cigars.
