will assemble at the men's boathouse
for the annual senior picnic. Delicious
picnic lunches have been prepared by

are being asked for twenty-five cents
each to help out.
As soon as all the class have met at
the boathouse the picnickers will, start
for Roble bridge, where picnic fires
will be built and a general good time

bridge—the seniors felt that it was a
fit spot to hold their last picnic.
The committee in charge are asking
the full cooperation of the class in mak
ing this last picnic of the class of '19

small sum asked from the men to J. M.
Holt, '19. at the Delta Tau Delta house.
This money is to be used for smokes,
marshmallows, etc.
