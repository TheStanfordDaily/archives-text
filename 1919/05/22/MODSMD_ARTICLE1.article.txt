# STANFORD â€“ CALIFORNIA MAT MEN CLASH TOMORROW
## PROSPECTS LOOK BRIGHT Coach Jones is Confident That Cardinal Will be Victorious 
### 
(TOMORROW night at Encina Gym,
* the annual intercollegiate wrest
ling tournament between the Cardinal
and the Blue and Gold will be held.
Prospects for winning the meet are
even between the two institutions and
it is said that the winning margin will
be narrow. Keen competition is look
ed for in all the weight classes.
Coach Jones has his men in readi
ness for the meet. He will place two
full teams 011 the mat to contest var
sity and freshman honors. From the
looks of the team and the fights put
up in practice bouts, it would be safe
to spell a victory, only overconfidence
might prove disastrous, according to
Coach P. H. Jones.
The wrestlers, both freshman and
varsity, will be weighed in tomorrow
afternoon at 2:30. At that time all
the men will have to make their
weight classes, but will be given a
margin of two pounds over their
weight. Several of the men have had
a hard time in making the divisions,
but in case they have not been weak
ened by the process, should prove
strong men for the events.
It is believed that a large audience
will be present at the matches and
accordingly small bleachers have been
frected to accommodate the interest
ed fans. The wrestling tournament
will turnisli an excellent exhibition
of the art of self defense and will
furnish competition equal to other
majir activities.
The regular teams will be used to
morrow night with no changes over
the lint previously announced. The
varsity meet will be followed by the
freshman events.
