# JOINT CONVENTION

■a »y I Woman's Vocational Guidance meeting on the campus
the advance press notices announcing the annual
ZLiHI \T/Sa Saturday morning, the women of the University possess something
of whicli they should not fail to take advantage. The convention
which is to meet is representative of pursuits followed successfully by women
who are demonstrating the ability of the sex in serious endeavor. The con
vention offers to the women a first-hand opportunity to hear of the professions
and vocations in which women today are keeping pace with the men. There
is an advantage to the campus community in having the Vocational Guidance
Convention here that should not be overlooked by the women of the University.
There is in the announcement of the convention for women a feeling sug
gested that the men of the University might at the same time hear from voca
tional leaders upon subjects relative to vocations and professions in which
they are interested. It seems well within the realm of possibility to combine
the vocational instruction offered the women through such a convention as that
planned for Saturday with some similar guidance f or those men of the Uni
versity anxious to hear from vocational leaders. Conventions in which men
and women would be jointly interested would be of benefit to both and would
even work towards eliminating some of the unpleasant jealousies attendant upon
women entering certain vocations supposedly reserved for men.
