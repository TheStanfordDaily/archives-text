# SENIOR PICNIC A TRADITION
## 
### 
Senior Class tonight plans a revival of one of those old
traditions that characterized the good old days on the
jiL Jl Farm. The Class Picnic at Roble Bridge or some similar spot was
usually the last informal gathering of the graduating class before
Senior Week and the Commencement Exercises brought their more formal
atmosphere. The picnic might be said to have been one of the last real tastes of
Stanford informality that the prospective graduate received at the end of liis
tinal semester As such, we congratulate the 1919 class in its revival. As one
of the last links in the chain that holds a class together in its four turbulent
j-ears at Stanford, the Senior Picnic should meet with the universal favor of
the wearers of the sombreros and the oldest (collegiately) of the "500."
