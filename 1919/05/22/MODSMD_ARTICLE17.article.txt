# ABOUT STANFORD
## 
### 
Traditions have come and gone on
the Farm. Some died a natural death,
while others came to an untimely end
through the force of student opinon.
Among the most prominent of these
was the plug ugly, the junior-senior
light, waged with leaded plugs as weap
ons for the juniors, they in turn being
slashed by the two-foot gas pipe of the
seniors.
Roble Bridge is still surrounded by a
veil of traditions which make it the
dangerous spot on the campus, to queen
ers, even the cactus gardens not ex
cepted.
All woman-haters steer clear of the
bridge with due respect to the preva
lent idea that more romances have been
fulfilled here than in any other place.
Most ghastly of all superstitions con
cerning this dreaded spot is that when
a Stanford man and a member of the
select "500," who are strangers, meet
each other here, they will eventually
be married. For this reason the place
lias been somewhat deserted of late and
poison oak has been allowed to take the
place of the much more romantic daisies.
Spring fashions were formerly ush
ered in by the man with white duel
trousers and straw hats. This custom
lasted for two years, 1894-95, but lias
never been revived.
Encina has held to the good old way
of throwing water out of the window
011 unsuspecting pedestrians. Encina
Club members also adhere to the un
written law of not playing pool on
Sunday.
