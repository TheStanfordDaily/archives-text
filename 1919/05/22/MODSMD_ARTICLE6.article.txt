# STANFORD TRACK MEN MEET OLYMPIC CLUB ON SATURDAY
## CLUB MEN WILL FURNISH FAST COMPETITION Squad Of Eleven Working Out On Oval for P.C.C. Meet On May 31 
### 
preliminary workout before the
Pacific Coast Conference meet at
Seattle on the 31st of the month, Clyde
Foster will bring a team c>f fifteen
Olympic track men to Stanford to meet
the Cardinal squad that will be sent
north the first of next week. The
Winged "O" men furnish some of the
keenest competition around the bay
section, so that the Cardinal runners
will be able to see just how they can
stack up against the universities of the
north.
At the present time eleven men are
working out on the oval to get into con
dition for the meet. Lilly and Wells
are working in the sprints, and Wells
is making his usual time over the hur
dles. Maynard, Scofield, Teitsworth,
and Dinkelspiel are making up a fast
relay team. Westwick is taking care
of the two-mile, and Curtis, Green,
Templeton, and Caughey will take care
of the field events.
If the meet that was held with the
Olympic Club as a preliminary to the
California meet can be taken as any
indication of the meet Saturday, the
Winged "O" men ought to walk away
with first place honors. The team that
Forster will bring down from San
Francisco will include Melville, Pyne,
and Stout in the 100: Norton, Geison,
and Hartley in the hurdles; Stout in
the mile and half-mile; Bedola and
Pyne in the 220; Williams in the quar
ter ; Farmer and Churchill in the two
mile; Lochmond and Volkmar in the
jumps; McEachon and Mondux in the
hammer; and Dewing in the pole vault
I he Cardinal runners should he able
to walk away from the Olympic men in
the relay and Green should have little
trouble in beating Dewing in the pole
vault. Norton will undoubtedly walk
away from Wells in the hurdles, as he
is expected to walk away from his op
ponents in the Allied meet in Paris
Caughey and Curtis will be able to take
care of McEachon and Mondux in the
weights, and Templeton will make
Volkmar and Lochmond fight in the
| jumps.
Pyne, Bedola, and Melville will make
W ells and Lilly fight for places in the
dashes. In the first Olympic meet Pyne
took first in the 220 in the time of
22:3, and Melville won the 100 in 10:2.
Stout and Teitsworth will fight it out in
the mile and half. In the first meet
Teitsworth took a first and a second,
and Stout equaled his record. In the
quarter the Cardinal should
make short work of the Winged "O"
men.
The meet will be held on the Stan
ford oval at 3:30 Saturday afternoon.
No admission will be charged.
