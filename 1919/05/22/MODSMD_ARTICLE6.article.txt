# STANFORD TRACK MEN MEET OLYMPIC CLUB ON SATURDAY
## CLUB MEN WILL FURNISH FAST COMPETITION Squad Of Eleven Working Out On Oval for P.C.C. Meet On May 31 
### 
preliminary workout before the
Pacific Coast Conference meet at
Seattle on the 31st of the month, Clyde
Foster will bring a team c>f fifteen
Olympic track men to Stanford to meet
the Cardinal squad that will be sent
north the first of next week. The
Winged "O" men furnish some of the
keenest competition around the bay
section, so that the Cardinal runners
will be able to see just how they can
stack up against the universities of the
north.
At the present time eleven men are
working out on the oval to get into con
dition for the meet. Lilly and Wells
are working in the sprints, and Wells
is making his usual time over the hur
dles. Maynard, Scofield, Teitsworth,
and Dinkelspiel are making up a fast
relay team. Westwick is taking care
of the two-mile, and Curtis, Green,
Templeton, and Caughey will take care
of the field events.
If the meet that was held with the
Olympic Club as a preliminary to the
California meet can be taken as any
indication of the meet Saturday, the
Winged "O" men ought to walk away
with first place honors. The team that
Forster will bring down from San
Francisco will include Melville, Pyne,
and Stout in the 100: Norton, Geison,
and Hartley in the hurdles; Stout in
the mile and half-mile; Bedola and
Pyne in the 220; Williams in the quar
ter ; Farmer and Churchill in the two
mile; Lochmond and Volkmar in the
jumps; McEachon and Mondux in the
