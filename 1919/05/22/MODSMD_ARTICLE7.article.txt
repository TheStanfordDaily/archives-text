## International Interests and Permanent Peace Are Topics of Talk 
### 
"Justice to and the interest of the
various nations involved are the two
things which must be considered in the
drawing up of the various nations in
volved arc the two things which must
be considered in the drawing up of a
document such as the Treaty of Peace,"
said Professor J. S. Tatlock in an in
formal discourse «upon the Peace Treaty
given at the Women's Club House last
night. "We can only hope that the
interests of the nations will not grossly
violate justice, and I think they have
not done so in this instance, with the
possible exception of some mining ces
sions to Japan."
In the course of his lecture, Professor
Tatlock discussed each of the sections
of the treaty in turn with regard to
their justice and to their military sig
nificance. It was pointed out as sup
plementary fact that, despite Germany's
claim to oppression from the Slavs on
the east, history shows that the Teu
tonic civilization has pushed steadily
eastward through the centuries instead
of being pushed back. Prussia itself
was once Slavic territory, and even the
name, "Prussia," is of Slavic origin."
The latter part of the lecture was
taken up by discussion with the audience
of the broader economic, social, and
political phases of the treaty.
