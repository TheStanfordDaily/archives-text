# Big Senior Picnic To Be Held Tonight
## Yearly Outing of Senior Class Expected to Be Best In Years 
### 
Tonight is the night of the An
nual Senior Picnic. At 6 o'clock p.m.
all seniors are to assemble at the boat
house. All members of the class who
have not yet turned in their contribu
tion of 25 cents to J. M. Holt, '19, at
the Delta Tau Delta House, are asked
to do so at once. The co-operation of
the entire class is requested.
Delicious picnic lunches have been
prepared by the women of the class,
and the "eats" will be the main at
traction of the program. As soon as
the clacs have met at the boat house,
the picnickers will start for Roble
Bridge, where the picnic fires will be
built. Since the new highway will
necessitate the tearing down of this
old landmark —Roble Bridge — the
Seniors felt that it was the most suit
able place to hold the picnic.
The men of the senior class are re
quested to assemble at the boat house
by themselves, and not to arrive in
company with members of the fair
sex, as queening at this picnic is ab
solutely taboo. The object of the
events is a general get-together, with
the democratic old time spirit the
main essential, and this cannot be
accomplished unless the class turns
out in full force.
The men will be furnished with ci
gars and cigarettes, and all the other
requisites of a good time. This pic
nic will be different from a great many
others in that good food, and a great
deal of it, is the main feature. This
should hold an especial appeal for
those Seniors who are not in the
habit of taking much nourishment in
the middle of the day.
