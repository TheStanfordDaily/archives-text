# Farce Rehearsals Ready to Begin
## Coach Gordon Davis Expects To Pick Final Cast By Monday 
### 
With the arrival of the manuscripts
for the Senior Farce, "Nothing but the
1 ruth," Coach Gordon Davis is ready
to get down to real work and is start
ing by picking out the best cast that
can be found on the campus. Last night
Davis had those who looked the most
promising in the tryouts reading dif
ferent parts in the newly arrived manu
scripts. Though most of the parts have
been decided upon, there are still sev
eral that are in doubt and for that rea
son the announcement of the cast will
be held until Monday.
Davis is planning to work the cast
every minute of the time that can be
spared from preparation for examina
tions as very little time remains before
the production must be presented. The
delay in the arrival of the manuscripts
was caused by the trainmen's strike that
is now in progress in the East.
The farce is, in the opinion of New
York and Chicago critics, one of the
cleverest productions that has been put
on the stage in several years. In New
York and Chicago Willie Collier starred
in the production, while on the coast
Max Figman took the leading role.
James H. Montgomery, who wrote
"It Pays to Advertise," and several
other farces that have been unqualified
successes, is author of "Nothing but
the Truth." The plot of the play deals
with the trials and tribulations of a
young man who tries to tell "Nothing
but the Truth"for twenty-four hours.
