# STANFORD MEMORIAL DAY
## 
### 
Memorial Day approaching as May draws to a
close, public opinion is commencing to call for
something that will make Memorial Day worth while on the
college, as well as national calendar. Memorial Day now means
more than ever before, as this year the significance of a tribute to those who
died in the struggles of the recent and distant past touches all much more
closely than ever before. To some, Memorial Day will be a source of great
pain and anguish in the memory of those who made the sacrifice while in
the service.
Stanford will be part of the national chain of places and events that will
be affected by the Memorial Day of this year. Stanford is to have its
Memorial Building; why should it not also have its Memorial Day in which
tribute can be paid not alone to the sons of the Cardinal who have gone, but
likewise to all their brothers in service who "went West" with them? It
would be out of keeping with the general spirit that will regard nationally
the Memorial Day of this year to fail in our university community to attend to
our share in recognition of the day.
If we were to urge a university holiday without any substitute for classes
other than vacation, we would probably be slighting Memorial Day to the
same extent that it would be slighted if no attention whatsoever were paid
to its presence. Something should be done to make the day be of more
significance in the college year.
A program of comprehensive sort with simple and appropriate ceremonies
should be provided in commemoration of the soldiers and sailors of the
Republic who gave up their lives in the Republic's wars. A university as
sembly with undergraduate speakers and others would add to the significance
of the day in a fashion that might make it worth while.
There is no fixed and arbitrary way to remember Memorial Day, but there
are the dictates of conscience that tell us that we should not fail to com
memorate it.
