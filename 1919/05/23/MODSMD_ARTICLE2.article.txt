# Tennis Tournament Reach Semi-Finals
## Handicaps Cause Surprises In Results of Cup Fight 
### 
Only one contestant has so far reached
the semi-finals in the school tennis
tournament for the Hastings cup trophy,
although there are but two preliminary
rounds. The tournament began last
Saturday on the Eticina courts, official
ly, â€” though no matches were played in
the morning, and only one or two in
the afternoon. Either lack of enthusi
asm or pressing afternoon engagements
have kept the entrants from playing
their matches according to schedule.
Owing to heavy handicaps, there have
been several surprises so far, not in
accordance with the dope. Mendlc de
feated Kinney in two sets, Fish defeat
ed Phil Neer, Tausig defeated Bent.
Martinsen, by winning from Hubbard
by default, and defeating Mendle, has
reached the semi-final round.
Perhaps the heavy wind which has
been blowing on the courts every after
noon this week has had something to
do with the delay in playing off the
matches, but at its present rate the
tournament will not be finished by the
time of the final examinations. An
important match which will take place
in the near future is that of Tausig vs.
Barber, the winner qualifying for the
semi-finals.
