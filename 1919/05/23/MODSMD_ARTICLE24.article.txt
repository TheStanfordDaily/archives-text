# ORATORIO "CREATION" TO BE GIVEN SUNDAY
## 
### 
The University Choir, assisted by the
Morris Club of Palo Alto and students
of the Music School of the College of
the Pacific, accompanied by members
of the San Francisco Symphony Or
chestra, will give a performance of
Haydn's oratorio, "Creation," on Sunday
evening, May 25, at 7:30 sharp.
The Church will be opened at 7
o'clock, the front doors being reserved
for the orchestra and choir. The nave
of the Church will be reserved for stu
dents up to 7:15. Members of the fac
ulty and administrative officers of the
University are invited to sit in a section
of reserved seats.
This oratorio will be one of the biggest
events of the college year. It is the first
oratorio that Warren D. Allen has di
rected at Stanford, although his fame as
a director is already well established.
He gave this same composition of
Haydn's at the Exposition in 1915, and
it was pronounced by critics to be ex
ceptionally fine.
