## DAILY PALO ALTO REMEDY FRESHMAN SITUATION 
### R.D. Campbell, '22 
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, CALIFORNIA, FRIDAY, MAY 23, 1919

4 4.fjl 11 i£ 1922 class is pepless; hasn't enough life to come in out of the rain;
it is a minus quantity when it comes to class spirit; and, as a class, it is
a minus quantity when it comes to class spirit; and, as a class, it is the poorest
example of freshmen that ever walked the Stanford corridors." 1 hese foregoing
statements are but a few of the hundreds of rebukes that have been thrown at
the 1922 freshmen this year. Since last fall the upperclassmen have constantly
nagged, harrassed, and found fault with the freshmen. They practically dis
couraged the first-year class. Tricking the freshmen is an old-time custom,
but when it is carried so far that it endangers the "good old Stanford spirit,"
then it is high time that something be done.
The responsibility for the poor athletic showing and the lack of class spirit
at the meetings of the freshmen is not altogether due to the first-year class.
The class was first called for its poor spirit at its class meetings. Upperclassmen
ridiculed the president of the lower classmen, —in fact the freshman class was a
pure joke, merely an organization to be laughed at.
Later in the year spring sports took a place (or rather tried to take a place)
on the freshman calendar of events. Stanford and California freshmen fought
in baseball and track, with the result that the Cardinal youngsters were badly
beaten. The upperclassmen say, "Oh well, they don't care whether they win
<.r lose—they think it is a big joke to be beaten by such scores as 21 to 0."
it seems that those upperclassmen who declaim thus are uninformed as to the
actual situation.
In the first place the Stanford freshmen had the baseball series practically
cinched, when at California the last game of the series ended with the Cardinal
frosh at the short end of the scoreboard. The upperclassmen hooted; the
freshmen then and there made a name for themselves in the eyes of the seniors
and juniors. But, after all, the Stanford freshmen had had no backing by
the students of the University. No interest was shown in their games—what
could be expected? To the upperclassmen the baseball series proved a huge farce.
In track the same outcome resulted. Stanford was walloped by a big score.
There were a number of freshmen out for practice, but they were not trained
and were inexperienced in Stanford track meets. They lacked the proper coach
ing, were poorly outfitted, and different from most freshman classes, they lost
the meet fighting.
If the freshman class of 1922 has fallen down so completely this year, then
it is high time to see just where the trouble lies; to remedy the trouble for
future classes and not alone for the 1922 class. Stanford spirit, if undermined
by the present freshman attitude which has come as a result of the action and
stand taken by the upperclassmen, would fall short of its old-time meaning
and would be an inconceivable detriment to the University.
Several years ago there was a number of big leaguers coming to Stanford
af freshmen. Some of these men were from Palo Alto and other peninsula
towns who were familiar with Stanford and its ideals. They knew the general
jun of things and were the natural leaders of their classes . They assumed
leadership and helped to put the freshmen "wise" in athletics and student
.'.ctivities.
It seems that conditions here are now changed considerably. There are
few freshmen who are able to give their colleagues the "hop" and consequently
the classes have attained a "don't care" attitude in all class activities. The
latter day custom of letting "George" take the chair and letting the other
fellow do the work, is entirely anti-Stanford spirit. The presidency of the
freshmen class should be an office for which there should be just as much com
petition as for the presidency of the senior class. If the classes coming into
the University do not have the necessary leaders and are not capable of running
their affairs in accordance with the Stanford spirit and style, then it is time
that a remedy be found for the situation.
A council of three seniors and three juniors to act as advisers to the
mcoming freshman classes in the future would put the classes in point of their
progressiveness, Stanford spirit, and ambition, on a par with any freshman
class that has ever been at Stanford. An advisory council would be entirely
expedient if in any way it furthered the old-time freshman class spirit. The
council could direct the general policy of the freshmen in their elections,
tsudent body activities, and athletics. The freshmen would get on the boat
early in their college career and for that assitsance would make better sopho
mores. It seems that encouragement is far better than constant nagging, and
with the upperclassmen taking a small interest in the affairs of the freshmen,
first-year classes should again be forthcoming similar to the old-time freshman
classes that bad the real Stanford spirit.
