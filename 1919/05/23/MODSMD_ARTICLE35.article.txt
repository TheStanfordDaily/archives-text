# OPPORTUNITIES OFFERED BY VOCATIONAL CONFERENCE
## 
### Eleanor Allen, '20 
UOR many years women have been
relegated to the teaching profession
without a by-your-leave, and in ac
cordance with the theories of incom
petence which have shrouded members
of the weaker sex .have been allowed
to fill no other places.
That women have found their work
and demonstrated their ability during
the war is a trite remark. It remains
for the University to go a step beyond
and show what lines of work have
opened up for women. This opening
of the "closed door" was going on
slowly for some time before the war,
and at a very remarkable rate during
that period, until now there is almost
no field into which a woman may not
enter and prove herself indispensable.
To present conclusive proof of the
wide variety of opportunity that exists
for women in these quickly advancing
days, the University has arranged for
the Second Women's Vocational Con
ference to be held next Saturday in
the Women's Club House. Women who
have been successful in their chosen
work, and who have been and are still
definitely connected with the work at
present will give straight facts, useful,
and not superfluous advice, and will
offer concrete suggestions for future
training and preparation. The talks
will be from the point of view of the
college trained woman and will answer
the perplexing question, What use can
I make of my education?
The conference is planned to meet
the needs of the largest number of
women and, with this in view, has
scheduled a wide variety of talks, which
will be of interest to all, including even
those who are not intending to prepare
for that particular line of work. The
talk by Mrs. Elizabeth Snell, the capa
ble appointment secretary of the Uni
versity, will be of universal interest, for
it deals with the qualifications of women
for professional work. Mrs. Snell has
had a wide experience in placing women
in positions and has discovered certain,
qualities which are essential to the suc
cess of a business woman.
The wide range of, the conference
may be better indicated by the subjects
of the scheduled talksâ€”"Women in
Business," "Women in Industry," "De
partment Store Education," "Bacterio
logical Laboratory Work," "Medicine
and Nursing as Professions for Women
and Public Health Work."
A clear distinction between the terms
"vocation" and "profession" may lead
to a better understanding of the voca
tional conference. A profession is a
calling in which one professes to have
acquired some special knowledge. A
vocation, on the other hand, is a calling
to a particular business or profession.
Thus, a vocation is a line of work for
which one has a special ability, and for
which one acquires special training. It
follows, in this line of reasoning, that
the vocational conference is for the pur
pose of aiding women in choosing that
work for which they are naturallj
fitted and to advise them as to the
best training.
The University vocational committee,
under the direction of Miss Harriett
Bradford, has planned this meeting with
the hope that all Stanford women will
take advantage of the exceptional op
portunity it affords to gain expert in
formation. Tf Saturday's meeting is well
attended and the women manifest suf
ficient interest, the conference will be
made a permanent affair and will be
held each year. With this in mind the
vocational committee urges every woman
to attend.
