# GOOD AUGUR FOR FOOTBALL
## 
### E.E. Crowe, '21 
DROSPECTS for a good American football season were greatly increased
by the results of the spring training, which was just concluded. Coach
Bob Evans has had an opportunity to look his material over, and, according
tc. his statement, he is more than pleased with the quality of work shown
curing the short training period. Six teams worked out every night, and
during the last few nights of practice, these elevens were matched against each
other in the first real games.
Evans is confident that he will have the best backfield on the Coast. Caughev
and Lilly are two men who are experienced, have plenty of weight and strength,
and are hard to beat when it comes to speed. "Here" Bihlman, a star full-back
in the army, will return, and, with his strength and speed, the Cardinal backfield
will be an unbeatable combination. Holt, captain of the S. A. T. C. team last
fall, has shown a good deal of ability and is the best ground gainer amongst
the backfield candidates. Holt will probably be used at one of the half-back
positions if a man can be found who can fill the quarter-back position satisfactorily.
Falk, Reynolds, Wark, Campbell, Creglow, Vetour, Morse, Sentous, Swan
holm, Bonney, Shlaudeman, and Patrick are other backs who are showing ability,
and they will be prominent contestants next fall. Wark has ben working at
quarter and has shown up in good style. Falk works at half-back and can
also play an end. Campbell and Creglow are good on 'offensive, and Vetour
has played a strong defensive game. Patrick played on the S. A. T. C. team
and can fill either a backfield position or play an end.
"With these men fighting for the four backfield jobs, Evans feels that he
will have little trouble in developing a quartet of line plungers that will do
credit to the Cardinal. With their ability as open field runners and line
bucklers, the coach will be able to fashion his plays for both open and close
formation work, provided a strong line is developed.
It is Evans' belief that a line is half of a football team. An eleven
without a strong line is like a baseball team without a pitcher. The best back
field in the country cannot win games without the aid of seven men of ability
holding down the line, according to the coach.
However, Coach Evans is optimistic over this problem as he has had
success in developing linemen at other institutions. Although the amount of
experienced men for these positions is small, the inexperienced men show
promise of development. Drake, Pershing, Mills, Curtice and Jarvis are the
only men who have seen experience. These five men will constitute a nucleus
around which a good line can be built. The ability to hold the opposition and
break through the opposing lines, as well as to open holes for the backs, are
qualities that a line candidate must possess.
Among the inexperienced men, Righter, Adams, Bunds, Freeman and others
are showing up well. Righter played a strong game at center during the spring
workout, and is a good prospect for next fall. Adams, Bund, and Freeman
lave the build for linemen and, according to the coach, they will develop into
good men.
The candidates for the two end positions are numerous, and out of the group
Evans will be able to select two men who will be able to hold down the job.
Brooks, K. Shlaudeman, Pelouze, Campbell. Patrick, Austin, Hawkes, Smith, and
Pallette are some of the men who have shown up well. Some of the backfield
candidates can also be used as ends if the need arises.
One of the problems of a football coach is to develop men who can fill
places on the team in case of injury to the regular man. Several men will
probably be used for each place during the season, which will give a considerable
i.umber a chance to show their ability.
In order to get off to a right start next fall, the football men are planning
tc return on September 15, and to get in two weeks' practice before the opening
of the autumn quarter. Coach Evans will be on the job to take charge of the
practice. The Pacific Coast Conference rules provide that practice cannot start
before that date.

during the last few nights of practice, these elevens were matched against each
other in the first real games.
Evans is confident that he will have the best backfield on the Coast. Caughev
and Lilly are two men who are experienced, have plenty of weight and strength,
and are hard to beat when it comes to speed. "Here" Bihlman, a star full-back
in the army, will return, and, with his strength and speed, the Cardinal backfield
will be an unbeatable combination. Holt, captain of the S. A. T. C. team last
fall, has shown a good deal of ability and is the best ground gainer amongst
the backfield candidates. Holt will probably be used at one of the half-back
positions if a man can be found who can fill the quarter-back position satisfactorily.
Falk, Reynolds, Wark, Campbell, Creglow, Vetour, Morse, Sentous, Swan
holm, Bonney, Shlaudeman, and Patrick are other backs who are showing ability,
and they will be prominent contestants next fall. Wark has ben working at
quarter and has shown up in good style. Falk works at half-back and can
also play an end. Campbell and Creglow are good on 'offensive, and Vetour
has played a strong defensive game. Patrick played on the S. A. T. C. team
and can fill either a backfield position or play an end.
"With these men fighting for the four backfield jobs, Evans feels that he
will have little trouble in developing a quartet of line plungers that will do
credit to the Cardinal. With their ability as open field runners and line
bucklers, the coach will be able to fashion his plays for both open and close
formation work, provided a strong line is developed.
It is Evans' belief that a line is half of a football team. An eleven
without a strong line is like a baseball team without a pitcher. The best back
field in the country cannot win games without the aid of seven men of ability
holding down the line, according to the coach.
However, Coach Evans is optimistic over this problem as he has had
success in developing linemen at other institutions. Although the amount of
experienced men for these positions is small, the inexperienced men show
promise of development. Drake, Pershing, Mills, Curtice and Jarvis are the
only men who have seen experience. These five men will constitute a nucleus
around which a good line can be built. The ability to hold the opposition and
break through the opposing lines, as well as to open holes for the backs, are
qualities that a line candidate must possess.
Among the inexperienced men, Righter, Adams, Bunds, Freeman and others
are showing up well. Righter played a strong game at center during the spring
workout, and is a good prospect for next fall. Adams, Bund, and Freeman
lave the build for linemen and, according to the coach, they will develop into
good men.
The candidates for the two end positions are numerous, and out of the group
Evans will be able to select two men who will be able to hold down the job.
Brooks, K. Shlaudeman, Pelouze, Campbell. Patrick, Austin, Hawkes, Smith, and
Pallette are some of the men who have shown up well. Some of the backfield
candidates can also be used as ends if the need arises.
One of the problems of a football coach is to develop men who can fill
places on the team in case of injury to the regular man. Several men will
probably be used for each place during the season, which will give a considerable
i.umber a chance to show their ability.
In order to get off to a right start next fall, the football men are planning
tc return on September 15, and to get in two weeks' practice before the opening
of the autumn quarter. Coach Evans will be on the job to take charge of the
practice. The Pacific Coast Conference rules provide that practice cannot start
before that date.
DROSPECTS for a good American football season were greatly increased
by the results of the spring training, which was just concluded. Coach
Bob Evans has had an opportunity to look his material over, and, according
tc. his statement, he is more than pleased with the quality of work shown
curing the short training period. Six teams worked out every night, and
during the last few nights of practice, these elevens were matched against each
