# HOW CAN THE IRISH PROBLEM BE SETTLED?
## 
### Ruth Lakin, '19 
IRELAND today is better off than she
ever has been and is enjoying equal
right with the rest of the United King
dom. Why then do the Irish hate the
English so intensely? The British have
long puzzled over this, especially since
the recent furious outbreak.
The indirect causes are found in the
early history of Ireland and England,
for this Irish hatred is an inborn one
of generations. The whole history of
Ireland is one of misfortune. Her very
isolation and her geographical position
have worked against her and made
much of her misery inevitable.
Shut off from Europe and England
by both the English and Irish channels,
with few, if any, good harbors and her
people from necessity agriculturist and
scattered in rural settlements, reforms
and progress have come slowly to the
Irish.
At the time that England was being
invaded by the Danes in the 9th century,
an event which influenced so greatly
English thought and development-
Ireland produced her one great leader
and king. Bran Bour. His very
strength, which wwas able to keep out
Danish invasion, resulted in a great
outstanding difference between Ireland

and England—that of race. The one
became Teutonic, the other remained
Celtic.
Christianity was brought by St. Pat
rick, but the very nature of the Irish
people and country made its establish
ment different from that in England.
Under Adrian IV, the only English
Pope, a lull was issued, giving England
the right to crusade against Ireland.
The Irish at this time were looked upon
as heathens.
Under Henry VIII England became
Protestant, but the Irish, isolated from
the new movement, remained entirely
Catholic. Henry, in an endeavor to
"rule" Ireland, ordered all images and
churches destroyed. This only served
to arouse and unite Ireland more than
ever before. It is considered by his
torians to be the first great mistake
of English rule in Ireland.
The second great mistake came under
the rule of James I, who established
the Protestant settlement of Ulster.
This Protestant element has proved
only a thorn in the flesh an."' is today a
fundamental cause why Ireland is
divided against herself.
As Engliand became more firmly
Protestant, attention was more and
more centered on Catholic Ireland.
Laws were passed by Parliament pro
hibiting Catholics from being educated
abroad or own their estates. Industry
was crushed and property taken from
them and given to Protestants. This
unfair treatment gave rise to many
secret organizations, both Catholic and
Protestant, which terrorized and sep
arated the Irish people.
The American and French revolu
tions gave Ireland the opportunity tr>
demand and receive from England cer
tain rights. Ireland had been allowed
to raise and equip a good-sized army
and, holding this as a threat, they asked
for separate legislation. But this free
dom proved of little real benefit to Ire
land, for tlie English lord lieutenant
became in a short time the real ruler.
The great reform movements which
swept over England in the early part
of the ninteenth century caused Etig
lishmen to look upon the Trish question
in a broader light. Statesmen saw and
realized the many mistakes made in Tre
land and now attempted readjustment.
Since 1800 Ireland has been in full
partnership with England, Scotland and
Wales, and enjoys a large representa
tion in the House of Commons. But
Ireland is restless and dissatisfied. Did
English good ride come too late?
Thousands of the best Irishmen for
the past century have been flowing out
of Ireland. Results have been that
Ireland has been left without able lead
ers when she most needs them, and a

false impression of present conditions
in Ireland has been given abroad.
These emigrating Irishmen left with bit
ter memories of ill treatment and of an
impoverished land.
The present condition in Ireland is
a critical one. Centuries of struggle
against English misgovernment have
blinded the eyes of the Irish to the
good qualities of their rulers. On
January 21, last, an Irish declaration of
Independence wa .sread before a Sinn
Fein Assembly at Dublin. The Sinn Fein
party represent the radical Irish ele
ment—an element that in some ways is
borderig on Bolshevism.
"Dcfinitcl yand defiantly," says one
of their organs, "we must tell the Brit
ish government that it can not go on
doing as it likes in Ireland. 'British
ism' must follow 'Prussianism.' The
first principle of the Sinn Fein move
ment is the complete rejection to the
utmost limits of possibility English in
terference—good or bad—in Ireland."
The Sinn Fein policy, as outlined by
tlie leaders, was based on the resurrec
tion of Hungary. Hungarian pamphlets
have had large circulation in Ireland.
For the past ten years the Irish have
been told that Hungary won her inde

pendence under Dcnk, by refusing to
send members to Ihe Imperial Parlia
ment. Thus the Sinn Fein delegates re
fused to meet in England. They wish
to form a general council in Dublin
and set up a consular agency of their
own. English civil courts are to be
suspended and be replaced by volun
tary arbitration courts. This policy
does not necesasrily imply a refusal to
recognize tlie right of George Vto re
main King of Ireland. The idea is to
have a common sovereign with separate
independence and power.
The danger lies in the fact that most
Sinn Reiners have gone beyond this—they
are calling for an independent Irish re
public. The shrewder Sinn Feiners, it is
reported, thought themselves lost after
the final defeat of Germany. The Na
tionalists in Ireland are urging to hold
together—nothing will come, they say.

Both England and Ireland need to re

IRELAND today is better off than she
ever has been and is enjoying equal
right with the rest of the United King
dom. Why then do the Irish hate the
English so intensely? The British have
long puzzled over this, especially since
the recent furious outbreak.
The indirect causes are found in the
early history of Ireland and England,
for this Irish hatred is an inborn one
of generations. The whole history of
Ireland is one of misfortune. Her very
isolation and her geographical position
have worked against her and made
much of her misery inevitable.
Shut off from Europe and England
by both the English and Irish channels,
with few, if any, good harbors and her
people from necessity agriculturist and
scattered in rural settlements, reforms
and progress have come slowly to the
Irish.
At the time that England was being
invaded by the Danes in the 9th century,
an event which influenced so greatly
English thought and development-
Ireland produced her one great leader
and king. Bran Bour. His very
strength, which wwas able to keep out
Danish invasion, resulted in a great
outstanding difference between Ireland

and England—that of race. The one
became Teutonic, the other remained
Celtic.
Christianity was brought by St. Pat
rick, but the very nature of the Irish
people and country made its establish
ment different from that in England.
Under Adrian IV, the only English
Pope, a lull was issued, giving England
the right to crusade against Ireland.
The Irish at this time were looked upon
as heathens.
Under Henry VIII England became
Protestant, but the Irish, isolated from
the new movement, remained entirely
Catholic. Henry, in an endeavor to
"rule" Ireland, ordered all images and
churches destroyed. This only served
to arouse and unite Ireland more than
ever before. It is considered by his
torians to be the first great mistake
of English rule in Ireland.
The second great mistake came under
the rule of James I, who established
the Protestant settlement of Ulster.
This Protestant element has proved
only a thorn in the flesh an."' is today a
fundamental cause why Ireland is
divided against herself.
As Engliand became more firmly
Protestant, attention was more and
more centered on Catholic Ireland.
Laws were passed by Parliament pro
hibiting Catholics from being educated
abroad or own their estates. Industry
was crushed and property taken from
them and given to Protestants. This
unfair treatment gave rise to many
secret organizations, both Catholic and
Protestant, which terrorized and sep
arated the Irish people.
The American and French revolu
tions gave Ireland the opportunity tr>
demand and receive from England cer
tain rights. Ireland had been allowed
to raise and equip a good-sized army
and, holding this as a threat, they asked
for separate legislation. But this free
dom proved of little real benefit to Ire
land, for tlie English lord lieutenant
became in a short time the real ruler.
The great reform movements which
swept over England in the early part
of the ninteenth century caused Etig
lishmen to look upon the Trish question
in a broader light. Statesmen saw and
realized the many mistakes made in Tre
land and now attempted readjustment.
Since 1800 Ireland has been in full
partnership with England, Scotland and
Wales, and enjoys a large representa
tion in the House of Commons. But
Ireland is restless and dissatisfied. Did
English good ride come too late?
Thousands of the best Irishmen for
the past century have been flowing out
of Ireland. Results have been that
Ireland has been left without able lead
ers when she most needs them, and a

false impression of present conditions
in Ireland has been given abroad.
These emigrating Irishmen left with bit
ter memories of ill treatment and of an
impoverished land.
The present condition in Ireland is
a critical one. Centuries of struggle
against English misgovernment have
blinded the eyes of the Irish to the
good qualities of their rulers. On
January 21, last, an Irish declaration of
Independence wa .sread before a Sinn
Fein Assembly at Dublin. The Sinn Fein
party represent the radical Irish ele
ment—an element that in some ways is
borderig on Bolshevism.
"Dcfinitcl yand defiantly," says one
of their organs, "we must tell the Brit
ish government that it can not go on
doing as it likes in Ireland. 'British
ism' must follow 'Prussianism.' The
first principle of the Sinn Fein move
ment is the complete rejection to the
utmost limits of possibility English in
terference—good or bad—in Ireland."
The Sinn Fein policy, as outlined by
tlie leaders, was based on the resurrec
tion of Hungary. Hungarian pamphlets
have had large circulation in Ireland.
For the past ten years the Irish have
been told that Hungary won her inde

pendence under Dcnk, by refusing to
send members to Ihe Imperial Parlia
ment. Thus the Sinn Fein delegates re
fused to meet in England. They wish
to form a general council in Dublin
and set up a consular agency of their
own. English civil courts are to be
suspended and be replaced by volun
tary arbitration courts. This policy
does not necesasrily imply a refusal to
recognize tlie right of George Vto re
main King of Ireland. The idea is to
have a common sovereign with separate
independence and power.
The danger lies in the fact that most
Sinn Reiners have gone beyond this—they
are calling for an independent Irish re
public. The shrewder Sinn Feiners, it is
reported, thought themselves lost after
the final defeat of Germany. The Na
tionalists in Ireland are urging to hold
