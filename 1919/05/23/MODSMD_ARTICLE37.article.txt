IRELAND today is better off than she
ever has been and is enjoying equal
right with the rest of the United King
dom. Why then do the Irish hate the
English so intensely? The British have
long puzzled over this, especially since
the recent furious outbreak.
The indirect causes are found in the
early history of Ireland and England,
for this Irish hatred is an inborn one
of generations. The whole history of
Ireland is one of misfortune. Her very
isolation and her geographical position
have worked against her and made
much of her misery inevitable.
Shut off from Europe and England

to arouse and unite Ireland more than
ever before. It is considered by his
torians to be the first great mistake
of English rule in Ireland.
The second great mistake came under
the rule of James I, who established
the Protestant settlement of Ulster.
This Protestant element has proved
