## Stanford as Conference Host 
### 
P ro P° se d tr 'P the Stanford track team to the
University of Washington to participate in the Pacific
Coast Conference meet scheduled in Seattle, May 31st, the thought
has been constantly recurring that Stanford should be host to the
Conference next year by holding the big meet on the Cardinal oval.
Facilities for athletic competition with outside teams are amply offered by
the situation of the University geographically and the accessories at hand for
athletic contest. Tt is understood that outside teams are anxious to visit Stan
ford and to compete here, so there is little fear of refusal to participate if a
Conference meet were finally arranged for the Stanford track.
It is quite some time since Stanford programmed an athletic event that
attained through dual competition. Meets in which several teams participate
absence of such athletic contests has been felt in many small ways. Prestige is
lost in many respects and opportunity is neglected to draw attention to the
Farm, if outside competition is overlooked.
It is highly desirous that a competitive meet of the size be held at Stanford
within the near future, as it is urgent that Stanford retain its place on the
athletic map. The interscholastic meets, features of the past, as pointed out in
these columns before, have disappeared from the Stanford calendar. Nothing
has been substituted to bring more universal interest to Stanford than that
attained through dual competition. Meets in which several teams participate
are more in accord with the Stanford policy than isolated annual dual meets
between the two rival institutions. If properly fostered and encouraged, the
Conference meet can become one of the big events of the colege year.
Our delegates are visiting the Conference meeting in Seattle before the
track meet up north. Plans for the next track meet will most undoubtedly be
discussed. Let these delegates take with them the fixed idea that the Stanford
student body would like to see the next Pacific Coast Conference track meet
held upon the Stanford oval as a big boost to Cardinal athletics.of the right sort.
