# ON WOMEN'S ACTIVITIES
## 
### 
By Bernice Frankenheimer, '20
Stanford's activities almost
every branch of college life is feat
ured, and the athlete, the musician, the
debater, the singer, the dancer, the ama
teur actor, the budding journalist, or
the would-be playwright, has each a
free and equal chance to "shine" in his
or her free chosen line of work. In
fact, the men and women of Stanford
have an unusually wide and varied
choice of activities in which they may
participate, and each one is sure to iind
some branch of these to his or her in
dividual liking. But has it ever oc
curred to the students of Stanford—
particularly to the members of the
"500"—that there is not a single activity
in the entire course of the college year
which the women may call their own?
True, there is Women's Field Day,
which is an evnt participated in and
enjoyed by women alone, but a Wo
men's Field Day is not the criterion of
what the women of Stanford, working
together as a whole, may accomplish.
Not every woman is interested in ath
letics, and some of those who are in
terested are far from being athletic
"stars." Thus Women's Field Day, the
only exclusively -feminine activity on
the campus, shuts out all the remaining
members of the "500" from participation
in a program peculiarly their own.
What of the musicians, the dancers, the
artists, and the writers?
To be sure, they may try out for
Junior Opera or one of the class plays;
they may submit music for the opera
to the committee, or they may even have
a plot accepted, as was the case in this
year's opera, but in every case their
successes or shared by the men, and the
world at large forgets that the women
of Stanford can do things "on their
own." This article is not intended to
condemn co-operation, for of all ele
ments in a co-educational institution it
is the most necessary; nor is it intended
to cast any reflection upon the merits

of any production or activity in which
the men and women share the hon
ors. It is merely to ask if the women
can not have some annual production
which is entirely their own in author
ship. direction, and participation.
The University of California has its
annual Parthenia, the words of which
are written by women students, the
music composed by students, and the
entire production participated in by the
women of the university only. This is
an event which is receiving recognition
not only around the bay regions, but
all over California and among the
larger co-educational and women's col
leges of the East. It is recognized as
being the work of the women them
selves, and in this recognition the wo
men of California become a unit—not
an integral part of a co-educational in
stitution. The women of Mills College,
fewer in number than those of Stan
ford, have their annual May Fete, which
stands for the work of the students
themselves, and which is known as a
production characteristic of the abilities
of the women as a whole. Nearly every
large women's college in the Fast has
some annual affair which is a student
creation from beginning to end, and
which gains recognition as such.
Why can not Stanford women have
such an activity? Let it not be said
that there is no ability among the "500",
for the share they have taken in all the
college acitivities has proven the con
trary. Stanford has natural facilities
of just as great, if not greater beauty,
than either California or Mills. She
also has the numbers, for although Cali
fornia has several times as many wo
men, five hundred is enough for any
such production as would be given.
Therefore, it is up to the women of
Stanford to start a custom of having
some annual affair which shall make
the outside world take notice of the
fact that while Stanford is a co-edu
cational university, it has "co-eds" who
can do tilings—and do worth-while
things—by themselves.
