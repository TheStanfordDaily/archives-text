of constructive policy has char
acterized the past management of the
Daily Palo Alto. Stick the advertisei
for what you can get, bleed the paper
for what it will yield, has given no
thought for the future welfare of the
publication lias too often marked the
methods pursued in the management of
the students' daily. And such manage
ment will always be a temptation and a
probability so long as the manager re
ceives as compensation 'a portion of
the profits from the paper. There is
little incentive for the manager to in
crease the faculty of the paper, to make
free use of cuts and reading matter, to
offer the most efficient delivery service
so long as he himself must help pay
the bill. The management of other
campus publications can be similarly
criticized.
•■With a desire to get away from the
tendency, which it is hoped will be done
away with, the management is attempt
ing to work out a constructive policy
for the paper, which it is hoped future
managers will decree to follow. In the
future, if present plans materialize, three
ideas will be the intent of the manage
ment.
First, the best paper and service' pos
sible with the funds available. This
of all money received from the paper
all money received from the paper.
Sensible management will require that
a safe margin be maintained, but a good
paper serving the students and not a
source of profits should be the purpose
of the Daily Palo Alto.
Second, advertising solicited on the
basis of merit and value received. The
misrepresentation and shady methods of
managers of student publications, the
appeal for advertising on the mere basis
of good will, the resort to means little
short of blackmailing, may work well
for a while, may yield good results for
a particular manager, but will in the
end discredit the publication and place
future managers under severe handi
caps.
In order that it may really cooperate
with its advertisers, may insure to the
advertisers results from their patronage,
the daily has organized an advertising
service department. The sole work of
the department will be to render aid
to advertisers and as far as possible
influence student buying. It is through
the work of this department which will
interview and advise with advertisers,
investigate and collect data regarding
student purchasing that the daily hopes
to be able to go to the merchant with a
real advertising medium and not a char
ity seeking for patronage.
The third feature of the plan calls for
trained managers. No person should be
placed in control of the paper who has
not served as a member of the busi
ness staff for at least one year. Student
inefficiency in the management of stu
dent affairs is in the large majority of
cases due to lack of training and ex
perience for the task at hand. There
should never be a time when there is
not from one to three understudies, gain
ing experience in the work to be done,
advancing on the basis of merit, ready
to step in to higher positions, as vacan
cies occur. Tll the attempt to supply
these opportunities for experience, the
present management has divided the
work of the paper into three depart
ments, the circulation department, ad
vertising department, and advertising
service department. At the head of
each department is placed a student who
is made responsible for the work of
that department and who in turn will
have the opportunity of advancing to
the position of business director.
The best paper possible, advertising
on the basis of merit, and trained man
agers is the policy being adopted by the
Daily Palo Alto. With these ideas in
mind, a larger paper is being planned
for the coming year. The success of
all the plans depends upon the interest
and cooperation of the students of the
university.

these opportunities for experience, the
present management has divided the
work of the paper into three depart

vertising department, and advertising
service department. At the head of

is made responsible for the work of
that department and who in turn will
have the opportunity of advancing to
the position of business director.
The best paper possible, advertising
on the basis of merit, and trained man

Daily Palo Alto. With these ideas in

all the plans depends upon the interest
and cooperation of the students of the
university.
of constructive policy has char
acterized the past management of the
Daily Palo Alto. Stick the advertisei
for what you can get, bleed the paper
for what it will yield, has given no
thought for the future welfare of the
publication lias too often marked the
methods pursued in the management of
the students' daily. And such manage
ment will always be a temptation and a
probability so long as the manager re
ceives as compensation 'a portion of
the profits from the paper. There is
little incentive for the manager to in
crease the faculty of the paper, to make
free use of cuts and reading matter, to
offer the most efficient delivery service
so long as he himself must help pay
the bill. The management of other
campus publications can be similarly
criticized.
•■With a desire to get away from the
tendency, which it is hoped will be done
away with, the management is attempt
ing to work out a constructive policy
for the paper, which it is hoped future
managers will decree to follow. In the
future, if present plans materialize, three
ideas will be the intent of the manage
ment.
First, the best paper and service' pos
sible with the funds available. This
of all money received from the paper
all money received from the paper.
Sensible management will require that
a safe margin be maintained, but a good
paper serving the students and not a
source of profits should be the purpose
of the Daily Palo Alto.
Second, advertising solicited on the
basis of merit and value received. The
misrepresentation and shady methods of
managers of student publications, the
appeal for advertising on the mere basis
of good will, the resort to means little
short of blackmailing, may work well
for a while, may yield good results for
a particular manager, but will in the
end discredit the publication and place
future managers under severe handi
caps.
In order that it may really cooperate
with its advertisers, may insure to the
advertisers results from their patronage,
the daily has organized an advertising
service department. The sole work of
the department will be to render aid
to advertisers and as far as possible
influence student buying. It is through
the work of this department which will
interview and advise with advertisers,
investigate and collect data regarding
student purchasing that the daily hopes
to be able to go to the merchant with a
real advertising medium and not a char
ity seeking for patronage.
The third feature of the plan calls for
trained managers. No person should be
placed in control of the paper who has
not served as a member of the busi
ness staff for at least one year. Student
inefficiency in the management of stu
dent affairs is in the large majority of
cases due to lack of training and ex
perience for the task at hand. There
should never be a time when there is
not from one to three understudies, gain
ing experience in the work to be done,
advancing on the basis of merit, ready
to step in to higher positions, as vacan
