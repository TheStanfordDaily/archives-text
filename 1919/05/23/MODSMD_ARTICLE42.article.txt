# VARSITY LETTERS AWARDED ON NEW BASIS BY ATHLETIC COMMITTEE
## 
### Milton F. Samis, '20 
VARSITY letters will be awarded in
American football on the basis of
participation in a certain number of
Pacific Coast conference games, as well
as for participation in the big game
with California; if the recommendations
of the Varsity Letter Committee, made
yesterday, are adopted by the Student
Council.
'I he committee yesterday recommend
ed the following rule concerning foot
ball :
"Any man who plays in one-half of
the conference games and one-quarter
of the California game, or who plays
•in three-quarters of the conference
games, or in three-quarters of the Cali
fornia game, shall lie entitled to wear
the varsity 'S'."
The most difficult question for the
committee to decide was whether to
limit the award of varsity emblems to
those participating only in the Califor
nia game, or whether to make confer
ence games a basis for awarding them.
After a lengthy discussion it was de
cided that for football the conference
games should lie considered in award
ing varsity letters. One reason is that
this method is used by most large east
ern colleges, and for this particular
sport appears to be the most equitable
method of judging of a player's merits.
Then. too. a big game with California
this fall is none too certain.
Recognizing the necessity of prevent
ing a cheapening of the varsity letters,
the committee set up safeguards which
should limit the number winning the
varsity "S" in football to approximately
twenty men.
Crew will remain as heretofore. The
men rowing in the annual Pacific Coast
intercollegiate regatta, and the coxswain
will be entitled to the varsity "S."
Competition with California alone will

be the basis of awarding letters in all
of the other major sports. This method
has worked well in the past, and no
necessity can be seen for making a
change. In track, any man scoring a
Point or any fraction of, a point in the
big meet with California will be en
titled to a lettr. Interest in the con
ference meet is not great, and the men
do not aim to get into their best con
dition for this event, making it pos
sible for inferior men to place.
The recommendation of the commit
tee regarding baseball will probably
meet with some opposition, but after a
careful study of the matter the com
mittee came to the conclusion unani
mously that any ma nwlio participated in
any one of the three games of the Cali
fornia series should be entitled to his
letter. Numerous other proposals were
made, but a sound objection was found
to each one. One Suggestion was to
make participation in two of the Cali
fornia games necessary. But under
this rule neither Newlands nor Pelouze
would have won their letters this year.
Another was to limit the number who
will be given emblems to fifteen play
ers, or some other arbitrary number.
But this also might often work an in
justice. Suppose that fifteen or more
men are used in the first two games,
making a third game necessary. . No
matter what part a player might take
m the third game, if lie had not been
in the first two he would not be entitled
to his letter.
Basketball presented a difficult prob
lem, but after careful consideration it
was recommended that any men who
participated in two games of the Cali
fornia series shall be entitled to wear
the "S."
It was further recommended that
rugby football be dropped from the
list of major sports.

be the basis of awarding letters in all
of the other major sports. This method
has worked well in the past, and no
necessity can be seen for making a
change. In track, any man scoring a
Point or any fraction of, a point in the
big meet with California will be en
titled to a lettr. Interest in the con
ference meet is not great, and the men
do not aim to get into their best con
dition for this event, making it pos
sible for inferior men to place.
The recommendation of the commit
tee regarding baseball will probably
meet with some opposition, but after a
careful study of the matter the com
mittee came to the conclusion unani
mously that any ma nwlio participated in
any one of the three games of the Cali
fornia series should be entitled to his
letter. Numerous other proposals were
made, but a sound objection was found
to each one. One Suggestion was to
make participation in two of the Cali
fornia games necessary. But under
this rule neither Newlands nor Pelouze
would have won their letters this year.
Another was to limit the number who
will be given emblems to fifteen play
ers, or some other arbitrary number.
But this also might often work an in
justice. Suppose that fifteen or more
men are used in the first two games,
making a third game necessary. . No
matter what part a player might take
m the third game, if lie had not been
in the first two he would not be entitled
to his letter.
Basketball presented a difficult prob
lem, but after careful consideration it
was recommended that any men who
participated in two games of the Cali
fornia series shall be entitled to wear
the "S."
It was further recommended that
rugby football be dropped from the
list of major sports.
VARSITY letters will be awarded in
American football on the basis of
participation in a certain number of
Pacific Coast conference games, as well
as for participation in the big game
with California; if the recommendations
of the Varsity Letter Committee, made
yesterday, are adopted by the Student
Council.
'I he committee yesterday recommend
ed the following rule concerning foot
ball :
"Any man who plays in one-half of
the conference games and one-quarter
of the California game, or who plays
•in three-quarters of the conference
games, or in three-quarters of the Cali
fornia game, shall lie entitled to wear
the varsity 'S'."
The most difficult question for the
committee to decide was whether to
limit the award of varsity emblems to
those participating only in the Califor
nia game, or whether to make confer
ence games a basis for awarding them.
After a lengthy discussion it was de
cided that for football the conference
games should lie considered in award
ing varsity letters. One reason is that
this method is used by most large east
ern colleges, and for this particular
sport appears to be the most equitable
method of judging of a player's merits.
Then. too. a big game with California
this fall is none too certain.
Recognizing the necessity of prevent
ing a cheapening of the varsity letters,
the committee set up safeguards which
should limit the number winning the
varsity "S" in football to approximately
twenty men.
Crew will remain as heretofore. The
men rowing in the annual Pacific Coast
intercollegiate regatta, and the coxswain
will be entitled to the varsity "S."
Competition with California alone will

be the basis of awarding letters in all
of the other major sports. This method
has worked well in the past, and no
necessity can be seen for making a
