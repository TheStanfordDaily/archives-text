# THE 						PRESIDENT MEETS HIS NEW CONGRESS
## 
### S.P. Hollingsworth, '20 
QN Monday of this week began what
is likely to become the most mem
orable extra .session in the history of
our Congress. Bills without end were
immediately offered despite the fact that
adjournment was ordered until today
following the reading of the President's
message.
Of prime importance is the Presi
dent's message which, to say the least,
has opened a few very delicate ques
tions. Carrying with it an appeal for
immediate action on legislation neces
sary for speedy restoration of the na
tion's business to a peace-time basis,
the message shifted to Congress the
responsibility for reconstruction. The
President indeed very adroitly "passed
the buck" to the Republican party which
for the past few months has been cry
ing for domestic readjustments.
Yet with all the criticism of the Presi
dent for thus roughly handling his new
Congress, his message shows the char
acteristic enlightenment of previous
messages, and displays a new capacity
of the President to meet tangible issues.
Starting with an appeal before all else
to weld together by adequate legislation
the forces of capital and labor, he has
offered labor the opportunity to share
in industrial control. He also gave
special emphasis to the needs of the
returning soldiers and to child labor.
Next in importance to the nation's
industrial readjustment, was urged the
return to private ownership of the rail
roads. telegraph and telephone systems.
This will undoubtedly be one of the
earliest subjects for consideration. The
President has clearly passed the whole
situation in the hands of Congress,
trusting perhaps that by the time the
peace treaty comes before the Senate,
that body from sheer exhaustion will
"pass the buck" back to him.
By far the most sensational portion
of iiie message centers about the repeal
of war-time prohibition on light wines
and beer. Aside from its political im
portance this step indicates something
of the President's method of watching
lie public interest.
Another very interesting phase of the
message is the paragraph urging a re
vision of the tariff. With a desire to
retain in force the tariff act of 1913, the
President can see only revision neces
sary to retaliate with other countries.

This is the nearest approach to a
blunder the President could make for
it reitrates his policy of "hands off'' the
tariff.
Coupled with this plea is the impetus
he now gives to foreign trade and in
tercourse. This phase of his message
certainly branches away from anvthing
the Republicans have said about it so
tar. I ndoubtedly the President wish
es to convey the point that the advant
age of getting an early start in foreign
fields lies witli America. He tries here
to encourage a study of foreign mark
ets and a friendslv attitude toward our
merchant marine.
Congress got an early start on the
other important measure urged in the
message, when the House voted for
woman suffrage by a large majority.
What the order of business will be
from now on depends to a large ex
tent upon the majority leader-; and the
course the debates may take. A large
portion of this business will undoubted
ly be shaped in committee hearings and
passed without discussion, but it is not
likely that the summer will roll by
without a lot of heat and perspiration.
I lie Peace 1 reaty, our policy in re
taining troops in Russia, the adoption
of a federal budget system, the return
of the railroads, and the prohibition
amendment, are subjects that would
make any congress sweat without the
aid of midsummer heat in Washington.
