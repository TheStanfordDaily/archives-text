# ON THE WAY TO SIBERIA
## 
### Verner C. Aurell 
This is the continuation from last week of the relation of the experiences
of Lieutenant Aurell, who zvas recenth sent to Siberia with troops to restore
c rder.

IT turned out that the lady who first
spoke to us was Mrs. C , whom (
1 knew years ago and whose daughter
was my first best girl when we were
about twelve years old! The ladies
escorted us to a Methodist Girls' School,
where we met some more Americans,
among them a young lady who called
me by my first name and whom I went
to school with when I was about 9 years
old, in Tokio, and whose brother was
then my best chum! One old lady was
so wrought up over seeing lis and espe
cially over seeing "one of our own boys
back and an American soldier'" that she
fell upon my neck and gave me a re
sounding smack upon the cheek, and
wept copious tears! " Our sudden ap
pearance among them seems to have
made a red-letter day in their 'serene
and non-adventurous lives.
By this time there was just about a
lady for each one of us; not all
exactly young and beautiful, but Amer
icans. Of course I was with my old
schoolmate. They wanted to show us
some of the interesting places in the
city, but as we were going to leave for
another place about noon, we didn't
have much time. Nevertheless, they
did take us to a Japanese garden, one
of the most beautiful and typically
Japanese things I have ever seen, cover
ing several acres of land. It had its
little lake, its winding paths, arched
bridges, trimmed bushes and trees, small
hills, white cranes (birds) and so on.
We enjoyed it all to the fullest extent.
From there we were escorted to the
depot, where we met my father and a
few more missionaries who wanted a
look at the U. S. soldiers.
Then we went to Miyajima, abouv
fifty minutes on the train, and from
there on a boat to a little island called
Itsukushima, one of the three beauty
spots of Japan. It is a sacred island
and one of the places where the
Japanese like to go in the springtime
for "asubi" or play (holiday). There
were a lot of curio shops where we
could have bought all kinds of interest
ing things very cheaply; all we bought,
though, was a walking cane apiece for
about 30 sens (15 cents). There is a
big Shinto shrine built over the sea
so that when the tide comes in it stands
in the water on piles. There are also
many other sacred things, such as a
sacred horse (alive and well), a sacred
herd of deer, sacred birds. There are
quaint tea-houses, pretty walks, and so
on. There is also a big European hotel,
and as we were hungry for a regular
meal, we went in and had a ten-course
dinner. Ah yes, we fared sumptuously
that day!
That night, or rather at 4 a.m. the
next morning, we started back for
Nagasaki. My father stayed on in
Hiroshima, intending to return to Tokio
in a day or two. LTpon arriving in
Nagasaki that afternoon, the first thing
that happened to us was a summons by
the police. The Japanese government
is very particular about taking pictures,
and it seems that it had been-reported
from up the line somewhere that one of
us had taken a picture of something
near a fortified place, and therefore was
subject to arrest. Much argument fol
lowed, and finally the one who took the
picture and a couple more of us went
down to the police headquarters. A lot
of red tape and reports and so on fol
lowed, and it was not until the next day
at about 1 p.m. that the judge in court
acquitted the man of his "cream"
(crime") because it was done in ig
norance. Oh no, we didn't spend the
night in jail. We went back to the ship
to sleep but came back to the police
station the next morning. Tt was quite
an interesting experience but took a lot
of our valuable time in Japan.
We spent the afternoon and evening
seeing Nagasaki. This is a seapprt
town and the people are all used to
seeing people of all nationalities, and
arc prepared to sell them anything they
want to buy. Americans are especially
welcome because of their reputation for
being such good spenders. I had a
great deal of sport talking to the Japa
nese in their own language, especially

the girls in the tea-houses, who would
sit around and laugh and ask ques
tions as long as we would stick around.
1 enjoyed my short stay in Japan very
much.
On March 25 we were off lor Vladi
vostok. We arrived in two days, and
there each officer received his assign
ment, some staying in Vladivostok and
others going to different points in
Siberia. I was assigned to the 27tli
Infantry at Khabarovsk, over 500 miles
north.
We were only a day in Vladivostok
and did not see very much of the place.
Counting the refugees, there are more
than 300,000 people there, they say. It
is a city of soldiers, men wearing uni
forms of all kinds and descriptions. I
saw American, Canadian, Japanese, Chi
nese, Italian, French, Szecho-Slovac,
and Russian soldiers; maybe some other
kinds, I don't know. The cars which
only run from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. have first
and second class compartments and
women conductors. They are vcr\
crowded at all times. There are some
very fine buildings but the street light
ing system is very poor and there arc
few electric signs. There is dirt every
where, and the streets are full of dirty
looking Chinese and Korean peddlers.
They have two or three theaters and
a few restaurants, all of which are al
ways crowded. Water all over Siberia
is very poor and must be purified be
fore drinking. I found Vladivostok a
very disagreeable place and was glad
to get away from there.
The train which took us to Khaba
rovsk was one chartered by the United
States. It was made up of passenger
coaches, box-cars and a little dinky
engine. Our sleeping cars were very
comfortable, being divided up into small
compartments with four berths to each
running across the car; we used our
own blankets. Our diner was a box
car with one end fixed up as a kitchen.
The vibration of the car was very help
ful to our digestion. We had candles
for lights.
It took us forty hours to get to our
destination. We passed through miles
of fiat, sparsely settled and for the most
part uncultivated land, now and then
stopping at stations near villages where
there was always stationed a guard of
soldiers of one nationality or another.
Khabarovsk is situated at the junc
tion of the Amur and Ussttri rivers.
These rivers are covered with ice most
of the year, but during the summer
months are navigable by quite large
ships. The Amur flows into the sea
at a place called Nikolayovsk, which is
4270 miles from Seattle. Khabarovsk
has a population of about 55,000 and is
quite a good place. Of course, it is very
cold in the winter. When we got here
the snow was still about a foot deep, but
it ha* been getting warmer and the
snow is fast melting away, leaving a
great deal of mud. American soldiers
are very well equipped for all kinds of
weather, with sheepskin overcoats, fur
caps and mittens, hip-high rubber boots
and lots of red-cross knitted goods. 1
am not afraid of either freezing or
drowning. They say it gets quite hot
in the summer.
The Russian people seem to be for
the most part friendly. I don't know
what they do for a living, but most of
them seem to have plenty of rubles
such as they are. A ruble, which was
once worth 51 cents gold, is now worth
from 7 to 9 cents. A kopek is one
hundredth part of that. The money is
all of paper and of many kinds and
hard to handle. Some of their bills
arc no larger than postage stamps and
others as large as two or three Ameri
can bills combined. A great many peo
ple here are Asiatics.
