# The
						Moonbeams
## 
### Wood 
When witching night begins its
mirth,
And when the dreams awake,
The moonbeams come upon the
etarth
To kiss some lonely lake.
The ripples run to greet the lights,
And murmur in the midst, ,
"The moonbeams left their starry
heights
To be caressed and kissed."
And all night long the ripples play
And sing this golden song.
And all night long the moonbeams
stay
. To kiss the rippling throng.
But when the restless morning breeze
Brings clouds into the sky,
And wakes the ancient, dreaming trees,
The moonbeams dim and die.
The restless breeze attempts to tell
The story of their birth,
And why they left their heights to
dwell
Upon the distant earth.
"Oh, what a joy to cherish dreams,"
It whisper echoes nigh,
"To be unknown, to live in gleams,
And vanish as a sigh."
