# Gifts---A Sonnet
## 
### 
By John Doe
So many things found favor" in your
eyes,
Crowds in the street, the hills' green
quiet space,
Your youth, your own lithe body's
strength and grace,
Music, the wild strange call of open
skies—
So many gifts you took with glad sur
prise.
For yours, the little pleasures of the
days,
1 he friendly smile from every passing
face, —
All these you took —and my gift you
despise!
Oh, why such blindness? Some day
you will see
That through those careless years daily
• gifts
My heart lay at your feet to leave or
take,
And all your happy memories will be
Burdens almost too wearisome to lift.
God then in mercy let vour heart not
break!
