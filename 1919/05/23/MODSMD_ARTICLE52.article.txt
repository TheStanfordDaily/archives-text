# OLD DAYS TO BE REVIVED
## 
### Ruth Mantz, '19 
'"THE Orgy of the Third-Year Tile,"
the inaugural ceremony of the
famous plug ugly, is to be reenactcd
before the red fires of the rally scene
in the pageant. In the original in
auguration of 1898, James Adams, the
smallest man in the college, acted as
high chief mogul, presiding over the
wild haired fanatics and worshipers of
the "tile" and received before the
junior altar the great white hat born
by six strong men. The pageant com
mittee is at present searching for the
smallest man registered for 1919.
And still more of the old traditions
will appear before the Stanford au
dience. Uncle John and the Hermit
will be seen in the ranks of the serpen
tine and the gang once led by Will
Irwin, himself, up to the Berkeley hills
and back again with their spoils.
The rally will portray the light, care
free side of Stanford life, just as the
frieze with its beautiful, symbolic groups
will represent the more serious,—the
academic aspect. But upon the quiet
seriousness of the frieze-tableaux and
upon the gay, care-free spirit of the
rally comes the unexpected sound of
martial music and the endless tramp,
tramp of marching feet. Then Stanford
is shown at her best in her finest and
highest service; and in her war service
she is more truly Stanford even than
in her old traditions.
In planning the pageant, it was the
intention that "Service" was lo be but
the first of a scries of Stanford pageants
dealing with her exceptionally romantic
and colorful history. But in producing
"Service," we are • peculiarly fortunate
and have the advantage over future
generations of pageanteers in that we
have still at Stanford many of the
actual makers of her history and ideals.
Their part need not be taken by actors.
There is Dr. Jordan, the very spirit

and inspiration of the early days, who
will appear in the scene of the Stan
ford inaugural. There is Charlie Field
and there are the members of the 2d
Ambulance Unit who have offered their
Decoration of the Colors, the first colors
services in reenacting the scene of the
decorated upon foreign soil.
A number of Native Sons and mem
bers of the Landmarks Society, who
have been Caifornia residents since the
earliest days, have very kindly offered
to represent the pioneers and grazers
of tlie frieze episode. But it seems most
essential to the spirit of the pageant
that those scenes portraying the more
intimate and personal sides of Stan
ford life, should be portrayed by Stan
ford men and women.
For these scenes especially, large
masses are needed; so there is ample
opportunity for every person interested
in the idea to play a part in this me
morial performance. There cannot be
too many. Rehearsal dates will appear
in the Daily Palo Alto.
At the suggestion of Ernest Holmes,
the committee has finally decided upon
the oval as the most favorable place
for presenting the pageant. It is most
appropriate both from the practical and
the artistic standpoint. Encircled by
the graceful ring of eucalyptus trees,
the rows of seats (capable of holding
thousands) look down upon a spacious
outdoor stage, itself graced by splendid
trees. It is at once perfectly repre
sentative of the gracious, warm beauty
of the Stanford land, and perfectly con
veiiient in regard to lighting, manage
ment of masses, and so on. The wind
ing serpentine and the shadowy pro
cessions of priests or Indians, moving
in the glow of red fire or the veils of
rising smoke, could have no more con
genial background than the dim, spread
ing boughs and the sturdy trunks of
Stanford eucalvptus.

trees. It is at once perfectly repre
sentative of the gracious, warm beauty
of the Stanford land, and perfectly con
veiiient in regard to lighting, manage
ment of masses, and so on. The wind
ing serpentine and the shadowy pro
cessions of priests or Indians, moving
in the glow of red fire or the veils of
rising smoke, could have no more con
genial background than the dim, spread
ing boughs and the sturdy trunks of
Stanford eucalvptus.
'"THE Orgy of the Third-Year Tile,"
the inaugural ceremony of the
famous plug ugly, is to be reenactcd
before the red fires of the rally scene
in the pageant. In the original in
auguration of 1898, James Adams, the
smallest man in the college, acted as
high chief mogul, presiding over the
wild haired fanatics and worshipers of
the "tile" and received before the
junior altar the great white hat born
by six strong men. The pageant com
mittee is at present searching for the
smallest man registered for 1919.
And still more of the old traditions
will appear before the Stanford au
dience. Uncle John and the Hermit
will be seen in the ranks of the serpen
tine and the gang once led by Will
Irwin, himself, up to the Berkeley hills
and back again with their spoils.
The rally will portray the light, care
free side of Stanford life, just as the
frieze with its beautiful, symbolic groups
will represent the more serious,—the
academic aspect. But upon the quiet
seriousness of the frieze-tableaux and
upon the gay, care-free spirit of the
rally comes the unexpected sound of
martial music and the endless tramp,
tramp of marching feet. Then Stanford
is shown at her best in her finest and
highest service; and in her war service
she is more truly Stanford even than
in her old traditions.
In planning the pageant, it was the
intention that "Service" was lo be but
the first of a scries of Stanford pageants
dealing with her exceptionally romantic
and colorful history. But in producing
"Service," we are • peculiarly fortunate
and have the advantage over future
generations of pageanteers in that we
have still at Stanford many of the
actual makers of her history and ideals.
Their part need not be taken by actors.
There is Dr. Jordan, the very spirit

and inspiration of the early days, who
will appear in the scene of the Stan
ford inaugural. There is Charlie Field
and there are the members of the 2d
Ambulance Unit who have offered their
Decoration of the Colors, the first colors
services in reenacting the scene of the
decorated upon foreign soil.
A number of Native Sons and mem
bers of the Landmarks Society, who
have been Caifornia residents since the
earliest days, have very kindly offered
to represent the pioneers and grazers
of tlie frieze episode. But it seems most
essential to the spirit of the pageant
that those scenes portraying the more
intimate and personal sides of Stan
ford life, should be portrayed by Stan
ford men and women.
For these scenes especially, large
masses are needed; so there is ample
opportunity for every person interested
in the idea to play a part in this me
morial performance. There cannot be
too many. Rehearsal dates will appear
in the Daily Palo Alto.
At the suggestion of Ernest Holmes,
the committee has finally decided upon
the oval as the most favorable place
for presenting the pageant. It is most
appropriate both from the practical and
the artistic standpoint. Encircled by
the graceful ring of eucalyptus trees,
the rows of seats (capable of holding
thousands) look down upon a spacious
outdoor stage, itself graced by splendid
trees. It is at once perfectly repre
sentative of the gracious, warm beauty
of the Stanford land, and perfectly con
veiiient in regard to lighting, manage
ment of masses, and so on. The wind
