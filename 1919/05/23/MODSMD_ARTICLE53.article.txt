# Separate Coach for Freshmen
## 
### Neil H. Petree, '19 
PRESHMAN classes have been "raz
zed," as the saying is. ever since
there have been first-year students, but
probably never in the history of the
University has a freshman class receiv
ed such all-around panning from every
angle that the present 1922 class has
been forced to take. It is doubtful if
any other freshman class has shown the
same lack of "pep," but this very fact
leads one to the conclusion that there
is something wrong besides the fresh
men themselves.
We laughed at them when so few
turned out that a track team was near
ly an impossibility; we threw them into
the lake when their baseball team went
to pieces at Berkeley and gave away a
series to the Blue and Gold rivals; and
we have done little but oppose them
ever since their entrance. At the pres
ent rate, the Stanford upperclassmen
to-be won't have eonugh of the Stan
ford spirit to move out of their tracks
by another year.
j The question arises as to what could
remedy the situation. Why not give

the frosh of the future some real tang
ible encouragement, instead of kicking
him down to the athletic field, where
no one appears to have the slightest in
terest in his welfare? Secure a coacli
for all first-year athletics, a man who
has a reputation, a man to whom every
freshman will look up. Then the lowly
frosh will not have to be herded down
to the field, he will gladly go of his
own volition.
Coach Evans can not possibly have
time to handle varsity athletics and
give the freshmen the proper training
or encouragement at the same time.
Every other university of standing has
its first-year teams, coached by men
whose only duty is to turn out fresh
man organizations which the universi
ties will be proud of. The freshmen
then will realize that some one has their
interest at heart, and consequently will
turn out and do the necessary work.
Jt is difficult, if not impossible, to ac
complish anything collectively without
a leader, and a leader in athletics is a
coach. Therefore, let's give the fresh
men a square deal and a coach.
