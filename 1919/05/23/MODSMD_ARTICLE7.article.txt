# PRINTERS HOLD UP QUAD
## Editor Takes Work to San Francisco 
### 
DECK XT disturbances in the pesonnel
of the University Press have necessi
tated at the last moment the taking of a
large quantity of the work for the 1920
Quad to San Francisco publishers, and
accordingly late this afternoon editors
and mangers of the year-book were
seen leaving the campus in their car
with heads emerging from a mass of
7000 sheets of miscellaneous Quad ma
terial, and 200 or more cuts of various
size and character.
Owing to the fact that the foreman,
Hugh Mcl. Porter, with several assist
ants recently severed connection with
the campus printing works, the shop
has been left short-handed and incap
able of handle the large lob of print
ing the yearbook in less than a month
or six weeks. Though the University
Press holds an unconditional contract
for complete publication of the Quad,
the editor states that in a spirit of co

operation the authorities have agreed
to allow financing of a portion-of the
book elsewhere, and consequently
enough of the work will be taken to
firms in the city to permit the appear
ance of the junior annual on scheduled
time.
Approximately 208 pages of copy and
cuts were taken to the Schwabacher &
Fry Publishing Company of San Fran
cisco. About 128 pages of work re
main to be completed in the University
Press rooms.
According to the editors many of
the finer cuts and most of the art work
will be left in the hands of the campus
shop, as it is among the best equipped
in the State and is provided with the
latest devices and auxiliaries necessary
in producing a better class of work.
The editors believe that in spite of
the handicap the 1920 Quad will come
out within two weeks or less time.
