## 
### 
While a squad of ten men from
Stanford are competing in the Pacific
Coast Conference meet at Seattle 011
May 31st, those men who were not
able to make the trip will get a chance
to meet some of the best men in the
bay section at an open meet that will
be held in San Jose on Memorial Day,
May 30th. The Chamber of Com
merce of San Jose who are in charge
of the field day expect, that the Uni
versity of California, St. Mary's, the
Olympic Club, and Santa Clara will
enter men.
Men winning places in the meet will
receive medals or ribbons. Anyone
who expects to enter the meet is ex
pected to come out 011 the track and
go,t into training was the announce
ment that was made by "Reg"
Caughey, who is in charge of the

Stanford end of the arrangements.
The men who will make the north
ern trip have been offered a chance
to enter a triangle meet with the
Montlomah Athletic Club and the
University of California at Portland
as a preliminary to the P. C. C. meet
at Seattle. On account of the extra
time that would have to be taken to
make the trip if Stanford accepted
the date, Student Manager Ames, re
fused the offer.
The men who are trying out for the
P. C. C. meet are out working on the
track every night and are expecting
to show the Olympic Club men a pair
of heels in the meet that is to be held
at 3:30 tomorrow. By next Monday
Caughey expects to have the men
picked who will make the trip to Se
attle.
