# STUDENT BODY DANCE SCHEDULED SATURDAY
## Will Be Benefit For Track Squadâ€”Other Week-End Plans 
### 
The Student Council is nutting forth
every effort to make the Student Body
Dance, scheduled for tomorrow even
ing, a success. Since it is to be a
benefit for track, a large crowd is ex
pected. The proceeds will be used to
enable the track squad to be sent north
this month to enter the Pacific Coast
Conference track meet and to help raise
the funds for the varsity "S" sweaters.
The new club rooms at Encina are to
be opened for the affairs, and Corby's
freshman orchestra will be on hand
with the necessary Jazz music. Eats
in the form of ice-cream cones will be
given away with each ticket. The dance
will begin at eight-thirty, and admis
sion will be seventy-five cents a couple,
including war tax.
