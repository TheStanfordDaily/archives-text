Today's announcement of the cast
of 1919 Senior Farce, "Nothing but the
Truth," came at the close of a series o'f
circumstances at once more dramatic
and at first more discouraging than has
ever been met with in connection with
the selection of a cast for a campus
production. An eleventh hour dis
covery of a suitable leading man and
the belated arrival of the script made
the production of "Nothing but the
Truth" a certainty only at the last mo
ment.
After the script of James Mont
gomery's clever farce had been received
following several days' delay, Coach Gor
don Davis, 18, easily assembled a splen
did cast, complete, with the exception
of a leading man. Miss Mona Gardner,
'20, was immediately selected as leading
lady of the presentation, her past ex
perience in amateur dramatics making
her the ideal person for the character of
"Gwendolyn," the heroine of "Noth
ing but the Truth." She is a transfer
from California this year and brings
with her a reputation for theatrical abil
ity. Miss Gardner is a member of
Chi Omega.
The selection of a leading man pre
sented far more serious difficulties to
the coach and the committee. The part
was an exacting one, calling for a dis
tinct type of comedian possessing a style
all his own. The one or two men who
cor Id have played the part on the cam
pus were either hampered by being on
probation, or by not feeling that they
could spare the time from their studies.
The coach and the committee were in
despair.
Just as they were on the verge of
calling off the >ho\v, the day was saved
by tlie timely appearance of Buford
\\ illiatus, '10. just discharged from the
army and still in uniform, returning
to Stanford to complete his work after
taking out a leave of absence two years
ago to enter the service. Williams has
been one of Stanford's dramatic head
liners, and is a comedian of distinct
ability. While in France he toured the
front lines for three months with a
professional troupe, presenting "A Pair
of Sixes." His rendition of the lead
in"The Fortune Hunter" here was
probably his greatest triumph as a come
dian. lie has also held the important
role in four other comedies, "Stop.
Thief," "Seven Days." "Seven Keys to
Baldpate," and "A Pair of Sixes," and
his entrance in the serious drama was
marked by his appearance as the counsel
for the defendant in "Justice" two years
ago. He is a member of Encina Club
and Skull and Snakes.
According to the coach, the rest of
the cast is eminently fitted for a spark
ling farce like "Nothig but the Truth."
Nearly every member of it has appeared
at lea-t one time or another in campus
dramatics. The date for the show has
been set as June 12.

the selection of a cast for a campus
production. An eleventh hour dis
covery of a suitable leading man and
the belated arrival of the script made
the production of "Nothing but the
Truth" a certainty only at the last mo
ment.
After the script of James Mont
gomery's clever farce had been received
following several days' delay, Coach Gor
don Davis, 18, easily assembled a splen
did cast, complete, with the exception
of a leading man. Miss Mona Gardner,
'20, was immediately selected as leading
lady of the presentation, her past ex
perience in amateur dramatics making
her the ideal person for the character of
"Gwendolyn," the heroine of "Noth
ing but the Truth." She is a transfer
from California this year and brings
with her a reputation for theatrical abil
ity. Miss Gardner is a member of
Chi Omega.
The selection of a leading man pre
sented far more serious difficulties to
the coach and the committee. The part
was an exacting one, calling for a dis
tinct type of comedian possessing a style
all his own. The one or two men who
cor Id have played the part on the cam
pus were either hampered by being on
probation, or by not feeling that they
could spare the time from their studies.
The coach and the committee were in
despair.
Just as they were on the verge of
calling off the >ho\v, the day was saved
by tlie timely appearance of Buford
\\ illiatus, '10. just discharged from the
army and still in uniform, returning
to Stanford to complete his work after
taking out a leave of absence two years
ago to enter the service. Williams has
been one of Stanford's dramatic head
liners, and is a comedian of distinct
ability. While in France he toured the
front lines for three months with a
professional troupe, presenting "A Pair
of Sixes." His rendition of the lead
in"The Fortune Hunter" here was
probably his greatest triumph as a come
dian. lie has also held the important
role in four other comedies, "Stop.
Thief," "Seven Days." "Seven Keys to
Baldpate," and "A Pair of Sixes," and
his entrance in the serious drama was
marked by his appearance as the counsel
for the defendant in "Justice" two years
ago. He is a member of Encina Club
and Skull and Snakes.
According to the coach, the rest of
the cast is eminently fitted for a spark
ling farce like "Nothig but the Truth."
Nearly every member of it has appeared
at lea-t one time or another in campus
dramatics. The date for the show has
been set as June 12.

Today's announcement of the cast
