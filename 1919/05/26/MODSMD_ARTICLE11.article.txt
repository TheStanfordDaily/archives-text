# CALIFORNIA LOSES WRESTLING MATCH TO VARSITY SQUAD
## STANFORD BABES LOSE U.C. Meets First Defeat In Four Years on Mat Friday Night 
### 
For the first time in four years,
Stanford defeated California in the
annual intercollegiate wrestling tour
nament at Encina gym last Friday eve
ning. The local varsity won five of
the eight bouts, while the Cardinal
freshmen lost to California babes to the
tune of 7 to 1. The bouts were hard
fought throughout, and the Stanford
wrestlers showed superior skill and ex
perience in most all of the varsity
matches.
The first wrestling tournament be
tween the two universities was held
several years ago, when Stanford lost
all the matches. Each year since it has
been a closer meet, until last year Stan
ford and California tied. This year the
Cardinal walked off with the honors for
the first time.
When the freshmen wrestlers started
the fray, Sims of Stanford featured the
only win of the tourney in the freshmen
divisions. He defeated Blanchard of
California by the use of a leg hold and
half-Nelson. Sims won his fall in short
order and demonstrated that he is a
fairly well-finished wrestler.
In the remainder of the Freshman
matches, Stanford was the loser. Lack
of tournament experience and confidence
was responsible for most of the defeats.
In the varsity bouts, old team men,
with the addition of a few new varsity
"finds" this year, won the day for Stan
ford.
Egami was the all-star lightweight
wrestler of the tourney. He won his
match for the third succesisve time over
California and fought one of the heav
iest bouts of the evening. Egami tricked
his opponent into using the wing lock,
which at a moment of vantage turned
the hold into a winning Nelson. By
the use of the scissors, Egami wore
bis man completely out, and then with
the agility born of a trained wrestler,
he threw his man forward, and by the
quick use of the wrist lock and half-
Nelson, won a fall.
In the featherweight division, Kaka
moto defeated Hughston of California
by default.
Gonzales in the 115-pound division
won by the use of the wrist lock and leg
hold over Trautner of California. Gon

zales put up a dazzling bout and will
undoubtedly hold his weight class for
some time to come.
Erickson of Stanford put up one
of the most sensational exhibitions of
the meet. He has shown his prowess
for the past weeks in practice, but
when he went up against the Pacific
Coast champion in the light division,
Ward, and defeated him in the final min
utes of the meet, Erickson made a mem
orable record for himself. Erickson was
in danger when the match started, but
soon hit his stride, and by superior
strength and ability on the mat, won the
bout. It is said that Erickson will de
velop into a champion if he continues
with the game.
Jack Lynn won his bout in his usual
cool, confident manner. He wrestled
Price of California in the 145-pound
class. Lynn first took the defensive on
the mat, and then by superior under
standing of the game, won from his man
by a sensational wing lock in less than
two minutes.
Demond in the 158-pound division lost
a whirlwind bout to Paterson of Cal
ifornia. Demond's inexperience in tour
nament work was probably the cause for

the defeat. The California man won
the match through football tactics and
not do to his ability as a wrestler.
Freeman lost the title in the 175-pound
class after he put up a strong, hard fight.
He lost to Golden of California by the
former's use of the far-Nelson and the
arm-scissors.
Cootise, who substituted for Bunds,
who was laid up at the time of the meet,
put up a hard, losing fight, John
son of California won by the use of an
unbreakable chanceree.
