# CALIFORNIA LOSES WRESTLING MATCH TO VARSITY SQUAD
## STANFORD BABES LOSE U.C. Meets First Defeat In Four Years on Mat Friday Night 
### 
For the first time in four years,
Stanford defeated California in the
annual intercollegiate wrestling tour
nament at Encina gym last Friday eve
ning. The local varsity won five of
the eight bouts, while the Cardinal
freshmen lost to California babes to the
tune of 7 to 1. The bouts were hard
fought throughout, and the Stanford
wrestlers showed superior skill and ex
perience in most all of the varsity
matches.
The first wrestling tournament be
tween the two universities was held
several years ago, when Stanford lost
all the matches. Each year since it has
been a closer meet, until last year Stan
ford and California tied. This year the
Cardinal walked off with the honors for
the first time.
When the freshmen wrestlers started
the fray, Sims of Stanford featured the
only win of the tourney in the freshmen
divisions. He defeated Blanchard of
California by the use of a leg hold and
half-Nelson. Sims won his fall in short
order and demonstrated that he is a
fairly well-finished wrestler.
In the remainder of the Freshman
matches, Stanford was the loser. Lack
of tournament experience and confidence
was responsible for most of the defeats.
