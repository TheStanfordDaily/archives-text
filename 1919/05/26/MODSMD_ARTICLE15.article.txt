# ROWDYISM AND TRADITION
## 
### 
ROUGHING at dances given on the campus lias long been a Stanford
custom, and is regarded by some as a tradition. There are arguments
both for and against the practice, especially from purely a local point
of view, but when the roughing descends to the rowdyism and vandalism dis
played at the dances last Saturday night, it is high time to call a halt. Not only
should we see that there is no repetition of the offense, but the guilty ones should
be pointed out. For the past three years, the Warren School, a military academy
located at Menlo Park, has given its annual dance at the Women's Club House
on the Stanford Campus. The first two parties were broken up when Stanford
roughs, in the name of the long established campus roughing tradition, made
away with the refreshments. Last Friday night, not only the refreshments,
but the silverware, and a silver tray belonging to the Warren family were stolen.
The conception that theft is not theft when perpetrated by college students
has long gone by the board. To steal refreshments at campus dances is plain
stealing just as much as' theft off the limits of the University would be, and
when the act embarrasses visitors, it is not only an insult to them, but to the
loyal Stanford students who still desire to create a favorable impression in the
eyes of guests. The Student Council should take action upon the matter imme
diately. It should put Stanford's majority in the proper light by sending a
letter of apology to the head of the Warren School, and should spare 110 effort
in discovering just who were the guilty parties. If they were not of Stanford,
we want to know it, and if we have such in our midst, we also want to know it.
