# Road Blockade Starts Campus Toward Depths
## 
### 
Indications early this morning point
to the fact that the University is on
the path to perdition, for broad is the
path and straight is the way that lead
eth to the Campus, and it is guarded
by a representative of Mephistopheles.
Needless to say, the rope which marks
the beginning of the wicked way is let
down with alacrity at every applica
tion for admission. Thus does the evil
one work.
A worried examination of this
condition . led to the discovery
that there are many paths all leading
to the same point, and that they are
all guarded by try-outees for the chief
job. The only peculiar fact about this
watchfulness is that an exit is as easy
as is the entrance, which speaks against
the teamwork of the developing de
mons. Evidently the coach is slipping
up on the job.
Recent confessions made at the Palm
Drive entrance disclose the fact that
the roads are closed merely because
they are private and want to remain
so. In order to comply with the law
and nothing but the truth, this farce
must be staged annually.
