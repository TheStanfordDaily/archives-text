# SEQUOIA IS HELD UP BY ENGRAVERS DELAY
## 
### 
Because of a delay in engraving,
Sequoia will not be out today, as was
promised by the posters on the Quad.
An extra amount of care had to be
expended for the various etchings, draw
ings and photographs which are to be
the feature of the issue, and include
work by both Pedro Lemos and "Peg"
Murray.
An etching by Lemos, "The Bending
Oaks," done in shades of green, will be
the frontispiece. This is a realistic
pastoral, showing that Stanford's old
nick-name, "Farm," may still be ap
plied. The engraving has been superin
tended by the artist in order to get the
best possible plate. The printing also
must be done carefully and must go
through the press two times.
The best of "Peg" Murray's draw
ings which appeared in Thomas VVelton
Stanford Art Gallery exhibit will be in
cluded in this cditio.n His cartoons
arc well known and arc always of a
humorous character. Half-tone photo
graphs, illustrating an article by J. I).
Adams, concerning German prison
camps and showing the paper money
and bread cards used by the prisoners,
will also be included iti the issue.
