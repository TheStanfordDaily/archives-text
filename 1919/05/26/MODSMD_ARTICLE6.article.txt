# LEM PARTON SECURED TO PRESIDE AT U.S.C. DEBATE
## ARGUMENT IS SET FOR MAY 28 Chairman is Selected For His Knowledge of Labor Question 
### 
Associate Manager Lem Parton of
the San Francisco Bulletin lias been
secured to act as chairman for the forcn
sic clash with the University of South
ern California at the Assembly Hall
Thursday night, Coach M. L. McClin
tock announced this afternoon.
Mr. Parton is one of the best known
newspaper men in the west, and has
specialized on labor problems from a
journalistic standpoint for many years.
He is remembered as the man through
whose influence were brought out many
of the facts and sidelights which cropped
out in the famous Mooney trial some
time ago. For these reasons, he is con
sidered by the debating authorities as a
most appropriate person to "preside over
an argument on the labor question in
the United States.
The Stanford debating trio is com
posed of C. O. Fenlason, '19, R. C.
Fisher, '22, and L. B. Martin, '22. Mc-
Clintock states that by consistent hard
work the. men have built up one of
the best affirmative cases ever put for
ward by teams under his direction.
At the present time Stanford and the
University of Southern California have
divided honors in the forensic field,
each having won the same number of
contests. As a win by the Los Angeles
trio Thursday night would give a tre
mendous advantage to the southern col
lege, enthusiasts here are particularly
anxious that the Cardinal does not lose.
The proposition for Thursday is "Re
solved, that the Federal Government
should provide employment for surplus
labor." No word has been received as
to the personnel of the U. S. C. team,
nor as to the selection of judges.
