# CARDINAL RUNNERS WIN FROM OLYMPIC CLUB TRACK STARS
## 
### 
As a starter for what they intend to
do to the colleges of the northwest in
the Pacific Coast Conference meet next
Saturday, the Stanford track stars, who
will make the trip to Seattle, defeated
the Olympic Club runners on the Car
dinal oval last Saturday afternoon by
a score of 53-32. Several events were
left out of the meet because of the
lack of men from the Olympic Club to
compete.
Some good times were made during
the afternoon despite the lack of com
petition. Wells negotiated the 100 in
10. and Norton of the Winged "O" team
skimmed the low and high hurdles in
the fast times of 15.4 and 25.1. Green
made 11 feet 6 inches in the pole in
exhibition jumping and Templeton did
6 feet in the high jump.
The summary of the meet follows:
