# ANNUAL JUNIOR YEAR BOOK WILL APPEAR ON QUAD MONDAY, JUNE 1
## 
### 
Monday .June 1, is the definite date
set for the appearance on the campus
of the 1920 Quad, the editors an
nounced this afternoon. Some delay
was experienced in transferring a
large portion of the printing to San
Francisco, but the work is in the
hands of two of the largest plants in
the city, the Schwabacher-Frye Pub
lishing Company and the Sunset Pub
lishing Company, which guarantees
the completion of the yearbook on the
specified time, and the Palo Alto
Times and the University Press have
given assurances that their portions
of the work will be finished on time.
At 2 o'clock this afternoon over 400
Quad coupons were sold, which leaves
less than 250 yearbooks for distribu
tion among the students. Nearly 1100
books will be printed in all, but about
500 were sold to alumni, junior col
leges and high schools, and to the
student body, which will use a num
ber of the books for advertising pur
poses.
Tomorrow is positively the last day
on which Quad coupons may be pur
chased, and only persons holding

coupons will receive the yearbook
next Monday ,the management as
serts definitely. It is expected that
not more than 200 books will be sold
by the sales receipt method tomor
row morning, which provides the last
chance for students to secure the
1920 Quad.
The new yearbook is declared by
those familiar with it, to be the finest
ever put out on the campus. The
artwork of the new edition is one of
greatest features, as the publication
contains a number of the best studies
of Pedro J. Lemos, together with many
exhbiitions of prominent campus art
ists, and charcoal drawings by Miss
Bernice Taylor, '21, and Miss Mary
Largent, '20i.
Particular care has been taken by
the management to secure fine inks
and special mat paper in order to take
from the Quad prints the customary
harsh glaze finish.
Much emphasis is also laid on the
"Sorority razz" and "inside dope" sec
tions in the Josh department, where
startling information will be divulged
to the public, according to those who
have advance notice of the contents.
