# MISGUIDED BOLSHEVISM

>KÂ§filjirthe appearance today in the environs of the Quad
I and around the neighborhood of the University
are forced to note that there is a great deal of misplaced energy
grounds of some mysterious warnings towards the Sophomore Class,
and reversed sense of tradition prevalent among the perpetrators of this latest
of Quad decorations. Apparently relying upon a sense of sympathy for the
so-called under dog, some misguided members of the Freshman Class apparently
have attempted to info&m the upperclass world of their newly found indignation
10 conditions as they are and have been at Stanford. The latest members of
the Stanford family (although we are loth to call the posterities brothers) have
apparently seen and have sought to substitute instead the still existent prep
school standards that have not been eliminated with the three-quarters of asso
ciation with Stanford men.
Let us not be misunderstood. We do not for the moment think that the
1922 class is in any way connected with the posters that appeared this morning.
Most certainly as a body no class would stoop to sucn disgustingly personal
display of "brightness," but we do know that there are some misguided fresh
men who seem to have been inculcated with either the idea of showing off
their own literary talents, advertising capacity, or sense of fellowship for the
other members of their class, who by the way most certainly must repudiate
these loose elements in the class organization.
Let us be understood: Freshman-Sophomore fights arc authorised at certain
times of the year. The Poster Fight is one of the most cherished Stanford
traditions. It is not tradition, common sense or decency to litter the campus
with pasted remarks upon subjects of personal interest at odd and inconvenient
moments. Tt is not appealing to our sense of Stanford Spirit of Stanford Spirit
of sportsmanship and fellowship to sec remarks appearing concerning named
members of the Sophomore Class; it is not in the Stanford Spirit of "coma
radie" to see crying and weak remarks of tubbing flagrantly published to the
campus world.
As Stanford men we most certainly repudiate the new Rulshevism or Black
Hand warning of the misguided few who have apparently determined to upset
tradition, destroy custom and eliminate the Stanford Spirit of Stanford men
from the institution which they claim as their University and which they have
still failed to recognize as their University.
