# PUBLISHERS TO USE DEBATE
## 
### 
Stenographers will be sent by the
11. W. Wilson Publishing Company of
New York City to take the speeches
of the contestants in the debate with
the University of Southern California
at the Assembly Hall Thursday, May 29,
according to announcement made by
Coach M. L. McClintock this afternoon.
The Wilson Company puts out the
book, "A University Debater's Annual,"
edited by Miss Edith Phelps, which con
tains the constructive and rebuttal
speeches delivered in the bigger de
bates of American dolleges. Yale and
Columbia featured in the last book by
Miss Phelps, and the authorities con
sider the inclusion of the Stanford de
bate among them a recognition of the
increasing forensic ability of the recent
Cardinal exponents o fthis art.
Stanford will be represented Thurs
day by C. O. Fenlason, '19, L. P>. Mar
tin, '22, and R. C. Fisher, '22, who
have the affirmative of the question,

"Resolved, that the federal government
should provide employment for surplus
labor." McClintock states that they
have built up a strong constructive case
which should offset their lack of ex
perience when they clash with the vet
erans from the south.
Mr. Lem Parton, associate manager
of the San Francisco Bulletin, has con
sented to act as chairman for the de
bate. He was chosen because of famil
iarity with labor problems on which
he has specialized from a journalistic
standpoint for many years. Mr. Parton
is one of the best known of California's
â€¢
newspaper men.
Stanford debating enthusiasts are par
ticularly desirous that the Cardinal
score a win in the coming contest, as
the past debates have been evenly di
vided, and the University winning
Thursday will take the lead in forensic
standing.
The judges for the coming debate
have not been determined upon.
