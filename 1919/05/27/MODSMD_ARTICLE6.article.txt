# STANFORD RUNNERS LEAVE TOMORROW FOR BIG P.C.C. MEET
## CONFIDENT OF VICTORY Ten Men Selected to Compete Against Pick of Western Athletic Stars 
### 
*PFN men will leave for Seattle tomor
rom night to represent Stanford in
the Pacific Coast Conference track meet,
which is to be held Saturday afternoon.
The Cardinal squad will arrive in the
north Friday afternoon, and will be
given a light workout. Dr. Angell and
W. T. Ames will accompany the team
to Seattle.
The definite squad to compete in the
meet will be selected tonight from the
following eleven men: Caughey, Wells,
Lilly, Dinkelspiel, Tcitsworth, West
wick, Scolield, Templeton, Maynard,
Green and Curtiss.
According to all the available dopf|
Stanford will take either a first or sec
ond place in the meet against the other
six universities in the conference. Ore
gon, Oregon Aggies, Washington, Wash
ington State, California, and Stanford
universities will ekch enter their limit
of ten men. The schools of the north
have some fast men in the track events,
according to Ames, but claims that
Stanford can rely upon her men to
take their share of the field honors.
Since Geoppert is not being entered by
California in the quarter, it is highly
probable that the Cardinal men will
take a iirst and second in this event.
Dr. Angell will attend the annual
Pacific Coast Conference meeting Fri
day afternoon, prior to the meet. The
results of this meeting will prove im
portant because one of the questions
under discussion will he that of dual
competition.
Caughey has been in charge of the
training of the Stanford men for this
meet, and he believes that the men are
in the prime of condition for the work
of next Saturday. The team will leave
Seattle Saturday night, and will be back
on the campus Monday afternoon.
