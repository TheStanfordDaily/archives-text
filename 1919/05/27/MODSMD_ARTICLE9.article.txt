# FORMER CAMPUS STAR WILL PLAY LEAD IN FARCE
## COACH DAVIS MAKES FIND Buford Williams, Recently Returned From Service Takes Main Role 
### 
Buford Williams, 18, who consented
to take the leading part of "Bob" Ben
nett" in "Nothing but the Truth,"the
1919 Senior Farce, following his ar
rival here Saturday from France, is a
campus. dramatic star of considerable
reputation. The exacting nature of the
leading part demanded a comedian of
the highest ability and on his appear
ance here last week he was immediately
selected by the committee as the ideal
actor for the part.
Probably Williams will be remem
bered best in connection with his many
appearances on the Stanford stage by
his rendition of the lead in the "For
tune Hunter." The part he had in thai
production corresponds closely to the
one he will play in "Nothing but the
Truth," both being of the same high
comedy order. Williams left Stanford
almost two years ago with the Base
Hospital Unit No. 30. He was pro
moted to a sergeancy and later to a
first lieutenancy. He has returned to
the University to complete a leave of
absence.
James Boyle, '20, who takes the sec
ond lead in "Nothing but the Truth,"
is another familiar figure on the cam
pus stage. He has appeared in several
local productions and took the lead last
year in the 1920 Sophomore play, "Tt
Pays to Advertise." The part that he
will take in the Senior Farce, "E. M.
Ralston," is one that his style of acting
is eminently fitted for. Miss Mary
Largent, '20, who has one of the princi
pal women's parts in the play, played
opposite Boyle in"It Pays to Ad
vertise."
The date for the farce has been set
for June 12. The seat sale wil lbe held
some time next week.
