1 00% pure Turkish tobacco
makes Murads worth more than
they cost —for 1 urkish is the-world's
most famous tobacco for cigarettes.
Murads please you when
your best friend does not.
You are proud to have the
Governor of your state see you
draw the Murad box from your
coat pocket.
It is true,"ordinary" cigarettes
cost a trifle less.
Judge for yourself—/
