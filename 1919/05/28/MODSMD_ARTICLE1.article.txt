# "DINK" TEMPLETON AND "REG" CAUGHEY ENTER PARIS MEET
## TEAM PICKED FOR NORTH Wells, Scofield, Green Certain Point Winners in P.C.C. Meet 
### 
Concurrently with the announcement
of the names of those men who will
make the journey to Seattle tonight
to take part in the Pacific Coast Con
ference meet comes the official notice
that E. R. Cuaghey, '18, and R. L. Tem
pleton. '18, have been selected as mem
bers of the team of fifty to compete at
the inter-Allied games at Paris.
Early this morning a telegram was re
ceived from Frederick VV. Rubien, sec
retary and treasurer of the Amateur
Athletic Union of the United States,
that Caughey and Templeton had been
selected as members of the United
States team, composed of fifty prominent
athletes of the United States Army, to
take part in the inter-Allied games to
lie held at Joinevillc-le-Point, near Paris,
June 22 to July 6. The two men will
leave to-morrow for New York, where
they will embark for Paris on June 6.
The selection of Caughey is of little
surprise to those who have been fol
lowing track dope on the Coast for the
last two or three years. He is reputed
to be the best weight man west of the
Rockies next to "Here" Bihlman, who,
it is unofficially reported, also has been
selected. Caughcv will be entered in the
shot-put.

was pickcd largely for the work that he
has done in the army during the last
year. During his enlistment in the army
he took part in six meets, in which
lie did. six feet or better in the high
jump every time. While in the army
he met and disposed of C. Larsen, na
tional high-jump champion, last year,
and "Lieut." Nichols of California. Tn
the last Stanford-California duel meet
it was Templeton's legs that brought in
the deciding points. He will he entered
in the high jump and possibly in the
broad jump.
This afternoon the squad that is to
meet six colleges in the P. C. C. meet
were picked. The lucky ten consist of
Curtis, Teitsworth, Lilly, Dinkclspiel,
Maynard, Westwick, Wells, Scofield,
and Green. The Inss of Caughey and
Templeton from the team greatly lessen
the chances of a Cardinal victory. Even
without the points that these two men
are sure to bring in, the team is con
fident of placing one-two-three.
Wells, Curtis, and Green arc expected
to be the big point winners for Stanford.
Wells will without a doubt be good for
twelve points and possibly may gather
in sixteen or seventeen. He is expect-
