# 1919 Farce Presents Hard Question
## 
### 
Whether or not a man can tell the
truth for twenty-four hours in a stretch
is a question that is brought up in "Noth
ing Rut the Truth,"the 1919 Senior
farce that will he given at the Assembly
Hall on Thursday, June 12. "Bob Ben
nett," played by Buford Williams, '18,
bets $10,000 that he can tell nothing but
the truth for twenty-four hours.
The complications that follow as a
result of this wager bring up the inter
esting question of the actual prevalence
and usefulness of lying. The proposi
tion was put before a prominent faculty
member today by a member of the

Daily Pau> Alto staff, and he said that
lie most emphatically agreed with the
author of "Nothing But the Truth,"
James Montgomery.
According to him, telling the absolute
truth for twenty-four hours would re
sult in a nervous breakdown for the or
dinary mortal who mingles in affairs
at all. "If the author of your play can
possibly make bis chief character suc
ceed in telling the truth for twenty-four
consecutive hours, he deserves the high
est credit. After all, nothing is harder
to tell truthfully than the truth, and
then it is the hardest thing to believe."
