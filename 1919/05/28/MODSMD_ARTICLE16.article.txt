# SUCCESSFUL ADMINISTRATION
## 
### 
112 the opening of nominations for Student Body officers
today, we are once again reminded (if the system of
elections, the candidates and the positions that are to be filled in the J
Student Body. According to the new and apparently successful
system of elections tried out in the winter quarter and to be given its first test
upon a full ballot next Tuesday, voting has become a simple process in compari
son to the varying and doubtful form of several years ago. Membership in
the Student Body, which is extended to every registered student in the Urn*
versitv, comprises the necessary requirement for balloting. Under such conditions
the largest vote ever cast in University elections should be forthcoming next
week.
As for the candidates, there is fortunately a wide choice of representative
men for every position open in t)ie Student Body. The difficulty is to Ret these
men out for the positions. It should become the duty of every member of the
Student Body, as a last duty before final exes, to see that the ballots are com
pletely filled with representative men, so that no matter who wins in the elec
tion we may be sure of a successful administration.
It is this point that is essentialâ€”a successful administration for next year.
We know that next fall is destined to .see Stanford once again in the full
strength that the war and its after effects have heretofore deprived us of.
We know that next year is destined to see problems of reconstruction in
every line of endeavor. It is for such a year that we must plan in casting the
ballots next Tuesday and in persuading the proper men to run for office during
this present week. A successful administration next year depends upon how
we plan for this administration now.
There is no such thing as not having the time to hold one of the positions
offered for next year. Participation in activities up to a reasonable extent
means not lessening of working hours, but cutting down on some of the waste
time. There is no excuse for lack of sufficient interest to hold a Student Body
position. If such a lack exists it is because of criminal neglect to be part of
the society in which the individual is placed. It is such a lack of interest that
ultimately develops the wrong kind of a citizen.
Interest in the elections, interest in the nominations will mean the right men
for the right jobs and a successful administration in 1919-20.
