To the Editor of the D. P. A.:
For some months I have been read
ing in successive editions of your paper
feature stories similar to the one that
appeared in last night's edition lam
now writing you in the hope of secur
ing enlightenment on this last deep
article. Either the writer is in love and
speaks from practical experience, or is
taking a course in Greek tragedy—as to
just which I am in a quandary. Sev
eral things in this unusual discourse
worried me, and most particularly when
the writer ispoke of the demons of
Mephistopheles (whatever kind of an
animal this is) staging a farce on Palm
Drive. Now, somehow, even in my
worst moods I have been wont to think
of demons as connected with a fiery
hereafter that was to be anything but
a farce. And as for how anything
could comply with both the law and the
truth at once, beats me.
The naughty boy that sticks pins in
the family pew must feel there is a
necessity for a religious uprising among
his relatives, but I can see no such
adequate reason for continually stick
ing the poor, benighted readers of the
D. P. A. with feature stories that are
clearly meant to conserve naught but
space. Far be it from me to dictate
the policy of the paper, but in line with
the fact that the "university is on the
path to perdition," and thinking that
it is after all just as well to smoke
Jiere as hereafter, I am venturing to
suggest that you restrain the fictitious
inclinations of your young reporter in
his or perhaps even her, ambitious at
tempt to hitch these stories to a fall
ing star.

The powers "that be" here at the
University have decreed that the stu
dents are to study the same on Me
morial Day as on any other day. It
may be all right to study, but it seems
that the purpose of Memorial Day
would be forgotten if the day were to
be treated no different than any other
day. If we had forgotten the men who
have made the supreme sacrifice, then
we should study by all means, but since
we are to honor them, then let us do
something other than study.
A day that had nothing, not even
studies, might not serve to honor the
men, but it will be an easy matter for
the Committee on Public Exercises to
arrange something that will serve to
honor these men. Every city, village,
and hamlet has some service on Me
morial Day to honor the heroes, yet a
great university is satisfied to let the
day go unobserved!

whicl for the red print.
Ever ry throughout the
counl t as one. This rec
ognit ause the employees
wish to give them some
over ork, but it is for a
purp it was in honor of
the it in the Civil War;
late; ided to include the
vetc mish War; and now
thei lother extension so

was just ended.
The powers "that be" here at the
University have decreed that the stu
dents are to study the same on Me
morial Day as on any other day. It
may be all right to study, but it seems
that the purpose of Memorial Day
would be forgotten if the day were to
be treated no different than any other
day. If we had forgotten the men who
have made the supreme sacrifice, then
we should study by all means, but since
we are to honor them, then let us do
something other than study.
A day that had nothing, not even
studies, might not serve to honor the
men, but it will be an easy matter for
the Committee on Public Exercises to
arrange something that will serve to
honor these men. Every city, village,
and hamlet has some service on Me
morial Day to honor the heroes, yet a
great university is satisfied to let the
day go unobserved!
To the Editor of the D. P. A.:
For some months I have been read
ing in successive editions of your paper
feature stories similar to the one that
appeared in last night's edition lam
now writing you in the hope of secur
ing enlightenment on this last deep
article. Either the writer is in love and
speaks from practical experience, or is
taking a course in Greek tragedy—as to
just which I am in a quandary. Sev
eral things in this unusual discourse
worried me, and most particularly when
the writer ispoke of the demons of
Mephistopheles (whatever kind of an
animal this is) staging a farce on Palm
Drive. Now, somehow, even in my
worst moods I have been wont to think
of demons as connected with a fiery
hereafter that was to be anything but
a farce. And as for how anything
could comply with both the law and the
truth at once, beats me.
The naughty boy that sticks pins in
the family pew must feel there is a
necessity for a religious uprising among
his relatives, but I can see no such
adequate reason for continually stick
ing the poor, benighted readers of the
D. P. A. with feature stories that are
clearly meant to conserve naught but
space. Far be it from me to dictate
the policy of the paper, but in line with
the fact that the "university is on the
path to perdition," and thinking that
it is after all just as well to smoke
Jiere as hereafter, I am venturing to
suggest that you restrain the fictitious
inclinations of your young reporter in
his or perhaps even her, ambitious at
tempt to hitch these stories to a fall
