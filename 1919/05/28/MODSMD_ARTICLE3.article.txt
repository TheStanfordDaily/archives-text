# Student Council Eats Pickles Under Roble Bridge in Night Hours
## 
### 
Romance is not yet dead. By no
means. It rather seems to be flour
ishing warmly. For how could it be
otherwise when such an august or
ganization as the Stanford Student
Council goes on a picnic, or rather
when it has went. Last evening just
as the moon had begun to peep over
the tree tops, fully expecting to find
all good Stanford students fast asleep,
this wicked audacious group, known
as a Student Council, were madly
rushing around hunting up ice cream
and dillpickles for a picnic. Think
of it! And to cap the climax, why
did they go to Roble bridge? Very
likely none of them had ever been in
this romantic spot before, and to
think that they should go there now.
Very probably their home influence
from now on will be exceedingly det
rimental. Immediate action will be
taken by the University authorities.
