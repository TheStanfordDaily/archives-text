# 1921 Quad Candidates Are Named
## Special Elections Will Be Held Monday 
### 
editorial and three managerial
* candidates for leading positions on
the staff of the 1921 Quad were named
by the Quad board at a meeting this
afternoon, to be voted upon at a spe
cial election of the Sophomore class
next Monday.
The candidates nominated for editor
ship are Robert Kenny, Arthur I.
Townsend, Floyd L. McElroy, and Jesse
E. Thrash. Melvin F. Parker, Melvin
E. Doyle, and Mortimer E. Kline are
the managerial nominees.
The special election is called for Mon
day by Allen Barber, '19. head of the
Election Board, because of the statement
of the Quad management that the com
parative work of the respective nominees
was so nearly equal that no two candi
dates for either position could be chosen
on this basis. Accordingly the special
election is scheduled for Monday, at
which the members of the class of
'21 will select the men to run in the
regular election Wednesday. The two
editorial and the two managerial nomi
nees receiving the highest votes in
Monday's election will be the candidates
at the general voting Wednesday.
