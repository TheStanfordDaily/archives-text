# NEW CUSTOM BEGUN BY AFTERNOON CLUB
## 
### 
Although comparatively recent, the
Afternoon Club is fast becoming one of
Stanford's well-known and most popular
traditions. This organization was origi
nated in tin fall of 1917 by two promi
nent students. Bill Smalley, then editor
of The Daily, and Ed Martin, manag
ing editor. The membership was lim
ited at that time to upper class staff
members, but due to the hardships of
the war it became necessary to do away
with this ruling. The'slogan in 1917 was
"A Hundred Before Christmas," and
although it can not be absolutely ascer
tained, it is probable that the club
reached this figure.
The Afternoon Club is unique in
many ways. Its character is one of
combined business and pleasure. There
are three degrees, but it is not neces
sary—and few of the members enter
more than the first. This degree is
always held at Wilson's on the Cam
pus, after the D. P. A. has gone to
press. Great care is taken that as many
members as possible attend all initia
tions. Two tables are placed together,
and the seating is arranged according
to placements on the staff, the ranking
member conducting the ceremonies. The
neophyte or neophytes take the opposite
end of the tables and are required to
perform certain entering obligations
disclosed to them at this time. It is the
custom of the club to appoint the newly
initiated members the Rushing Commit
tee. This has given rise to keen compe
tition, as each committee strives in turn
to add the leading number of initiates to
their credit.
So famous has the organiation be
come that Mr. Sticky Wilson himself
created the "Afternoon Club Special,"
naming it in their honor. The member
ship list of the club includes some of the
most prominent students that have at
tended college since 1917.
