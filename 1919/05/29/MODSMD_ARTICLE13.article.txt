# TWO CHORUS LADIES IN FARCE MAKE CAST COMPLETE
## 'BOOZE' BRINGS TROUBLE Twenty-four Hours of Truth Complicates the Divorce Situation in Play 
### 
IT seems that campus theatricals this
quarter are not complete without at
least one chorus lady in the cast. The
Junior Opera boasted of twelve, while
the Senior Farce which will be given
011 Thursday, June 14, will have two
of these seemingly indispensable the
atrical adjuncts. The parts of "Mabel",
played by Miss Mary Largent, *20,
and "Ethel" played by Miss Irene
Bonnett, '19, are delightful chorus
ladies of the latest approved type.
It is a painful moment in "Nothing
But the Truth" when "pore Mabel"
announces to the scandalized "Mrs.
Ralston," played by Margaret Shedd,
'20, that there must have been more
than "harmless booze" in the drinks
she had "that night." "Mrs. Ralston"
has just asked this interesting lady
to give her some "significant" but not
necessarily truthful facts concerning
the faithlessness of "Mr. Ralston,"
played by James Boyle, '20. "Mrs.
Ralston" has been seen lighting
"Mabel's" cigarette and his devoted
spouse is seeking grounds for a di
vorce action.
Into these complications enters the
leading man. "Bob Bennett," which
character is taken by Buford Willi-
ams, 'IG. Young Dennett has just
made a bet that he will tell "nothing
but the truth"for twenty-four hours.
When he starts to tell the truth about
the faithless "Mr. Ralston," he soon
learns that the path of the truth
teller is not always an easy one, and
hardly the usual thing. At the close
of the second act, the principal char
acters are left in a situation from
which it seems impossible for them to
extricate themselves.
The seat sale will be held a week
from today at the Bookstore. As the
performance of "Nothing But the
Truth" comes on the night of the last
day of final examinations, a large
crowd will probably attend.
