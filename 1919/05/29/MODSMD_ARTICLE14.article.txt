# ANNUAL GET-TOGETHER PARTY HELD BY "Y"
## Elects Officers for Next Year James H. Lewis Talks on Russia 
### 
"Conditions in Russia During the Ker
ensky Regime" was the subject of a
talk given by Mr. James IT. Lewis last
Wednesday at the big annual get-together
party of the local "Y." A large number
of the association's members were pres
ent Kt the meeting, which was held at
the Lake, to' hear Mr. Lewis and to
elect the officers for the coming year.
' Mr. Lewis was in Russia during the
collapse of the Car's political machine
and was well acquainted with the suc
ceeding events of Keren sky's rule. He
was also in Russia when the Bolsheviki
came into control, and had ample oppor
tunity to observe the success of the So
viet Government. Regarding the latter
he said: "The present Bolsheviks were
the exiles under the Czar, and being un
der the peculiar conditions of Siberian
hardships, naturally worked out a pe
culiar and impractical form of govern
ment. We could not expect anything
other than anarchy from men who have
beep strangers to world conditions for
several years, and who suddenly stepped
into the authority and control of the
vast Russian Empire." Regarding the
remedy, Mr. Lewis said, "Education is
the great hope. Leaders in educational
and medical fields are badly needed
there, and there is a great demand for
trained men to go to Russia to work
in behalf of these interests." Mr. Lewis
also spoke of the Chinese question, with
especial attention to the present peace
treaty arrangements. At present he is
touring the country in the interests of
the Methodist Recruiting Service.
Following the talk by Mr. Lewis, the
officers of the "Y" rendered reports for
the past year. The election of officers
of the association for 1920 resulted as
follows: President, F. L. King. '19; vice
president, Lyman Wilbur. '21 ; Secretary,
H. Davis, '20; Treasurer, R. B. Var
num, '21.
