# PRIVILEGE, DUTIES AND ASSEMBLIES
## 
### 
/BUMISÂ® t ' lc Universit y authorities have decided not to grant
a 112u ]j holiday tomorrow, and have substituted a one
hour assembly, it is both the duty and privilege of every student
to attend. Too many students in the past have, figured an assembly
period as a licensed cut from classes. These students arc not only losing some
thing themselves, for the assemblies are all instructive, but they are forgetting
their duty to Stanford. Dean David C. Barrows of the University of California
is to be the speaker at the Memorial Services which will take place on Friday
at eleven o'clock. Stanford is fortunate in securing Dean Barrows. He is a
v;ell known man, a man of unusual personality and speaking ability, and there
should not be a vacant seat in the Memorial Church tomorrow.
Aside from the fact that the students will be favored by a distinguished
speaker, tomorrow is Memorial Day, and as such should be fittingly observed.
Many students protested when it was announced that a holiday would not be
granted. If the authorities had decided to suspend classes tomorrow, they would
have done this upon the assumption that the Stanford students would use the
day as Memorial Day, and now that they have called a university assembly
instead, it is with the same idea in view. Becuse it is Memorial Day, and the
assembly is to be held to observe this day, all students are expected to be in
attendance.
