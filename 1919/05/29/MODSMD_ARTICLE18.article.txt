To the Editor D. P. A.:
Dear Sir: Having read your editorial
on "some misguided members of the
Frosh class" we wish to state that
tubbing is prohibited by the State and
University law; that many members of
the Frosh class have been tubbed this
quarter; that we do not come "crying
and making weak remarks on tubbing,"
but took the matter in our own hands
and mildly hazed a few Sophs, with the
result that the Sophs have shown them
selves to be bad losers.
If a Frosh is cocky he needs dis
cipline, but there are many ways to
obtain the desired result without half
drowning him. The Sophs at the be
ginning of last quarter got a list of all
the Frosh in the Hall and tubbed the
outfit on general principles. Docs this
show the democratic and "brotherly"
attitude so much boasted of in. Stan
lord? In the second place, the Frosh
don't come to this institution to be
bootlicking flunkies.
What is the tradition you speak of
if it tends to take the spirit out of men,
oppresses them, and in some cases in
jures them for life, as has happened
several times in late years. Just be
j cause the Frosh were nearly killed in
I '91 under the impression that it did
: them good and afforded amusement for
. a certain element of the Soph class is
: no reason why the Frosh of today
should be mauled. It is undemocratic
: and un-American.
Moreover, our energy is no less "mis
guided" in distributing posters than in
decorating Encina dances to which most
freshmen are intimidated from attend
ing.
The main point of this communica
tion is to protest against the unfair at
titude of the D. P. A. toward the
freshman class. The class of '22 took
the recent incident at the lake during the
freshman picnic in a good spirit. A
very bright feature article appeared in
your respected paper on the. subject, well
appreciated by most freshman subscrib
ers. Then some "misguided" students
distributed some posters which could in
jure none but the supersensitive or the
prejudiced. This outrageous act called
forth from you a fiery editorial. Might
we ask which of the two incidents is the
more rowdyish or Bolshevik, or whether
there is a tradition which calls for the
breaking up of every activity engaged
in by the Frosh simply to make him
keep in mind that he is everybody's
flunky and a misguided citien in need
of constant restrain.
A FRESHMAN.
Under "Another Viewpoint" an article
appeared in the Daily Palo Alto last
evening deploring the failure of the
Committee on Public Exercises to pro
vide suitable observances of Memorial
Day. Since the writer did not sign
himself "Constant Reader." nor any
thing in particular, I take the liberty of
addressing him in general, and respect- j
fully and with due modesty call his
attention to an announcement of spe
cial services for Memorial Day which
appeared in column 2. page 4. of the j
Daily Palo Alto of Friday, May 23rd,
and to the full program of the Me
morial Assembly printed on page 1.
column 5, of the Daily for Tuesday,
May 27th. The committee would deep- j
ly regret that a correspondent who has ■
taken enough interest in Memorial Day
to think of it as a possible holiday and
to note the opportunity it afforded the
Public Exercises Committee to get busy
should miss the services planned for the
occasion because of lack of information
about University affairs. In the interest
of human enlightenment and progress,
may I ask that a copy of this letter be
mailed to your correspondent, as there
seems to be a strong probability that it
will not be noticed by him in the col
umns of the Daily.

Under "Another Viewpoint" an article
appeared in the Daily Palo Alto last
evening deploring the failure of the
Committee on Public Exercises to pro
vide suitable observances of Memorial
Day. Since the writer did not sign
himself "Constant Reader." nor any
thing in particular, I take the liberty of
addressing him in general, and respect- j
fully and with due modesty call his
attention to an announcement of spe
cial services for Memorial Day which
appeared in column 2. page 4. of the j
Daily Palo Alto of Friday, May 23rd,
and to the full program of the Me
morial Assembly printed on page 1.
column 5, of the Daily for Tuesday,
May 27th. The committee would deep- j
ly regret that a correspondent who has ■
taken enough interest in Memorial Day
to think of it as a possible holiday and
to note the opportunity it afforded the
Public Exercises Committee to get busy
should miss the services planned for the
occasion because of lack of information
about University affairs. In the interest
of human enlightenment and progress,
may I ask that a copy of this letter be
mailed to your correspondent, as there
seems to be a strong probability that it
will not be noticed by him in the col
umns of the Daily.

To the Editor D. P. A.:
Dear Sir: Having read your editorial
on "some misguided members of the
Frosh class" we wish to state that
tubbing is prohibited by the State and
University law; that many members of
the Frosh class have been tubbed this
quarter; that we do not come "crying
and making weak remarks on tubbing,"
but took the matter in our own hands
and mildly hazed a few Sophs, with the
result that the Sophs have shown them
selves to be bad losers.
If a Frosh is cocky he needs dis
cipline, but there are many ways to
obtain the desired result without half
drowning him. The Sophs at the be
ginning of last quarter got a list of all
the Frosh in the Hall and tubbed the
outfit on general principles. Docs this
show the democratic and "brotherly"
attitude so much boasted of in. Stan
lord? In the second place, the Frosh
don't come to this institution to be
bootlicking flunkies.
What is the tradition you speak of
if it tends to take the spirit out of men,
oppresses them, and in some cases in
jures them for life, as has happened
several times in late years. Just be
j cause the Frosh were nearly killed in
I '91 under the impression that it did
