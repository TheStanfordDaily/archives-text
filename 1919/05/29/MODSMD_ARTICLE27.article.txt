# COOPERATION WITH ADVERTISERS ASKED
## Fourteen Reasons for a Joint League of Students and Merchants are Given 
### 
Why should Stanford men and women
patronize the advertisers of their col
lege papers?
1. Because there should be a cooper
ative league between Stanford men and
women and advertisers in the D. P. A.
Our patronage would mean the estab
lishment of just such a league. It would
mean the accomplishment of many things.
2. Reciprocity in business is vital to
the small merchant, and he cannot
patronize us unless we patronize him.
He needs our support just as we need
his.
3. Advertising is a business, not
sentiment, and if advertising does not
pay, the merchant will not long adver
tise: The business man in advertising
has but two objects—the selling of goods
and the selling of service. It is justified
to the extent it is successful. Thus, ad
vertisers in the D. P. A. ask themselves
just how much they can expect to gain
by such ads.
4. Merchants and business men are
not compelled to patronize us. There
are many other ways they can reach us
besides advertising in the D. P. A. And
just as sure as we do not patronize
them, they will soon be using these
other ways of advertising and ignor
ing us.
5. If Stanford students do not buy
of our merchants, these same merchants
will not patronize our college paper.
For what would be the use of their
expending sums of money every month
to help out* tiie students, if the students
bought just as freely from someone who
did not support them?
6. But if all possible campus trade
went to D. P. A. advertisers, and in s<
far as possible only to them, our col
lege paper would be regarded as the
best advertising medium on the Penin
sula.
7. Willi advertising we have been
able to put out a good college paper
ami even to enlarge its scope. Few peo
pie realize the enormous expense that
even a small paper entails. Rut with
the cooperation of our advertisers the
paper has been made a success.
8. Without advertising patronage we
cannot put out a college paper of any
kind. No advertisements mean no paper.
Without the money obtained from the
daily ads the price of editing a paper,
even a small one, would be practically
prohibitive.
9. No and as a re
suit 110 paper, would mean a vital loss
to university life. It could be replaced
in 110 other way, a fact that explains
the existence of a daily paper in every
large university in the country.
10. How long would Stanford Spirit
remain unaltered without a college
paper Everyone would necessarily be
"off the boat" and a highly unsatisfac
torv state of affairs would result.
11. We owe it to our advertisers foi
the confidence they have placed in us
I They have freely given their advertis
1 ing for our support. "What can w<
justly do but buy of them?
12. Our buying from advertisers whe
arc obviously catering to our traeh
would mean that they could carry largei
j stocks to supply our peculiar demand;
and needs.
13. As a result we could supply oui
wants much more satisfactorily than a
present. Tt would eliminate much o
the dissatisfaction that often result
from lack of stock carried by the mer
■ chants with whom we deal.
14. Lastly, it would compel those win
! do not advertise with us, cither to d<
so, or to lose our trade. This woul<
' mean an enormous increase of adver

tising, and would enable us to carry
out plans that would tfivc us a college
iaper unequaled in the West.
