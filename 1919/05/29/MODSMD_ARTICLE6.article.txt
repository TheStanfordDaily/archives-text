# SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA DEBATORS ARRIVE ON THE CAMPUS
## OPPOSING TEAM STRONG Stanford to Meet With U.S.C. In Debate at Assembly Hall Tonight 
### 
INEXPERIENCE and "fight" on the
part of Stanford, will be pitted
against the ability of inexperienced
forensic veterans in the clash of
brains with the University of South

The three forenics artists from the
South arrived on the Campus at 8

Louis Delia, and Claude Reeves make
up the combination which will try
against the Stanford debatering trio,
and, according to reports from the
South, the opponents of the Cardinal
are as formidable as any that have ever
represented Southern California.
Stanford's trio this year is unique in
the respect that none of the men lias
previously taken part in inter-collegiate
contests, and two of the debaters are
freshmen.
C. O. Fenlason, '19, is the anchor man
of the combination, and though not a
veteran in varsity forensic fields, his
work when president of the Euphronia
Debating Society and in certain intra
university contests gives debating fans
here the utmost confidence in his ability

| prove a tower of strength in rebuttal,
! and the men from the southland should
J find it exceeding difficult to "put any
i thing past" him.
R. C. Fisher and L. B. Martin are the
freshmen of the team. Fisher has
shown excellent ability in the prepara
tion of introductory argument, and, ac
cording to McClintock, his initial pres-
I entation this evening should leave the
