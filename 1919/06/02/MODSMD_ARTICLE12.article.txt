# DEMOCRACY CARRIED TOO FAR
## 
### 
t' le uame of Stanford was given to this University,
&o- —Jsml democracy lias been the distinctive ideal of the
institution. Judging from the amount of emphasis which this
subject has received in editorials, speeches and articles from 1891
until the present time, it might easily be ascertained that the ideal of dem
ocracy is one which we are still working toward, rather than one which
we have now attained. But, regrettably, there are some students who seew
to consider that the goal has been reached by their own persistent and
troublesome efforts.
A specific instance of the misunderstanding of Stanford's iedal may be
ted from what occurred at the Encina dance which was held on Friday
st. Regardless of the fact that this dance was the largest, and most nearly
•proaching a formal, function given by Encina Club during the year, num
erous couples took the opportunity to show their "democratic" spirit by
sauntering in after the movies and remaining the uninvited guests of the
Encina men for the entire remainder of the evening. These couples, further
more, dressed in Quad and sports costumes, did not fail to partake of the
supper and additional attractions which had been arranged for the occasion.
Although this example is here given, it is hot" by any means the only oc
currence of just such a discourtesy. The same breach has been faithfully
observed at a number of fraternity, sorority, club and Roble functions dur
ing the year.
Democracy, as it is generally understood, partakes of reciprocity. There
is no reason why it should not signify the same general consistency at Stan
ford as it does elsewhere. And in regard to social affairs held at the homes
of the various living groups, it has always been the custom that when two
houses entertained on the same evening, members of either one would be
welcomed at the other —merely a fair exchange. This custom is most as
suredly commendable and it is demonstrative of the Stanford democracy,
but such an infringement as has been mentioned above should be curtailed
by campus opinion before it becomes a bad habit.
