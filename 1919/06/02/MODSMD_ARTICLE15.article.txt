# Trackmen Turn Orators in "Dry" Country
## 
### 
Drouthy weather conditions in Ore
gon were telegraphically reported to-day
by the D. P. A.'s fighting editor from
the train which is bearing the Stanford
trackmen homewards from the P. C. C.
meet at Seattle. Question: What was
the fighting editor fighting when he
started to warm up the wires? Here's
the telegram, judge for yourselves.
Glendale, Oregon, May 29. 1919.
Neil Petree,
Daily Palo Alto,
Stanford University, California.
Track team special just passed Ash
land, where Lilly addressed cheering
populace. Curtice substituted for Pe
louze at Medford. Wells prepared
Portland speech. Teitsworth writes
Campus letters. Ames conserved foodâ€”
stewed prunes. Maynard's middle ini
tial found. Hammock small for Green
Doc. Angell won't drink cider. Scofield
Westwick still sober. Dry State.
