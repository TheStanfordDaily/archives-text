# STANFORD DEBATERS LOSE U.S.C. CONTEST
## 
### 
Stanford lost by a unanimous deci
sion to the debating trio from the Uni
versity of Southern California at the
Assembly Hall Thursday night. The
defeat is attributed to a lack of experi
ence on the part of the cardinal speak
ers, which placed them at a disadvant
age in rebuttal.
The three supporters of the affirma
tive for Stanford delivered excellent
constructive arguments, and, according
to many, easily excelled their opponents
in free delivery and presentation. Early
in the debate, however, the trio from
the Southland established a technical
interpretation of the labor question
which was not overthrown.
In the first speech the Los Angeles
combination made its position clear pro
posing that "surplus labor" included all
men and women who for any reason arc
not working. According to their inter
pretation, the proposition demanded
that the Government should guarantee
a job for every man and woman, and
unless the affirmative could prove that
their plan would give these guarantees
they contended that, according to the
wording of the question the decision
must go to the negative. Tn this posi
tion they were not attacked till late in
the argument.
The question as stated was. "Re
solved, That the Federal Government
should provide employment for surplus
labor."
C. O. Fenlason, '19, was, according
to the veterans who heard the contest,
undoubtedly the strongest contender for
the Cardinal. His rebuttal was the only
one directing much constructive force
against the victorious team.
L. 15. Martin, '22, and R. C. Fisher,
'22, made excellent initial presentations.
Fisher's first speech was ranked as one
of the opening presentations of the best
character. Martin followed with a pleas
ing and worthy continuation of his ar
gument.
The failure to win must be attributed
to an inadequate answer to the con
tention that in order to establish a
case, Stanford had to guarantee a job
for every man. and to an omission of
women's labor problems from the Cardi
nal arguments.
