# SENIOR WEEK PROGRAMS TO BE RELEASED JUNE 5th
## 
### 
June 5 in the date set for the release
of the Commencement Week programs,
which are now in the hands of the en
graver. The unusual importance of this
year's commencement has made the pro
grams a very necessary item, both to
facilitate understanding of the logical
order in which the activities occur; and
;is a valuable souvenir. To meet the
emergency, the committee has plannned
and executed an exceptionally fine pro
gram. It is invaluable in that it contains
the only written record of the class
of '19.
The cover of this booklet will be car
dinal. beautifully leather-embossed, and
bearing the numerals and Stanford seal.
The first page will be an engraved in
vitation to attend Senior Week. The
