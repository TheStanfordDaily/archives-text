# SOLDIERS ARE GUESTS OF STANFORD WOMEN
## 
### 
Camp Fremont soldiers were enter
tained by the Stanford women yester
day afternoon at their Red Cross Club
House. Miss Evelyn Flowers, '20, who
is chairman of the committee; announces
that this is the last Sunday of the quar
ter that the women will go out to the
camp, but the work will be continued
again next year if there are still re
cuperating men in need of care.
A huge basket of fruit and little
cakes were passed around to the men,
and the food seemed most welcome to
them.
Miss Katherine Trwin, '22, gave a
reading, and Miss Ocle Helvie, '19,
played the piano. A generally informal
good time was enjoyed by both the men
and women, and the Fremont men gave
expression of their appreciation to the
Stanford women for their great help
during the past year.
