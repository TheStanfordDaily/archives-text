# COMPLETE PLANS FOR SENIOR WEEK ARE OUTLINED
## 
### Ruby Hale, '19 
OENIOR WEEK, this year promises
to be one of the best ever held at
Stanford. There seems to be an un
fortunate ideal prevalent among some
of us that Senior Week is only for
those who graduate at this time.
Many, who belong to the class of '19,
but who are not going to graduate on
the sixteenth, on account of having
been in government service or for
some other important reason, feel
perhaps that they are not included in
the Senior Week exercises. This,
however, is a very mistaken view of
the matter, for it is the duty of every
member of the class of '19 to take
part in the Senior exercises, in order
to make the week a complete suc
cess. All should feel that it is their
particular party and enter into it with
much enthusiasm.
The festivities begin on the evening
of June 12 with a presentation of
"Nothing But the Truth," by James
Montgomery. The following day,
Friday, is Class Day, and many inter
esting events will take place, starting
at 10 a.m., with the exercises on the
North Terrace. The 1919 plate will
be dedicated at 11, and this will he
followed by the pilgrimage to the
Mausoleum, and the tree-planting by
the Senior Class. At 4 p.m., the
President's House will be thrown
open for a large reception, where
l)r. and Mrs. Wilbur will receive the
graduating class, their parents and
friends, and the alumni and faculty.
At all Class Day exercises caps and
gowns will be worn. The Senior
Promenade, Friday evening, is expect
ed to be a very delightful affair. This
takes place as usual in the Memorial
Court, which will be beautifully de
purated and lighted for the occasion.
Refreshments will be served at the
many attractive booths arranged
around the Court. The will be
of the best and canvas will be stretch
ed over a part of the inner Quad for
the dancing.
Saturday is Alumni day, beginning
with a Senior-Alumni baseball game,
at 9:15 a.m., and leading up to the
Pageant given in the track oval at
8 p.m. The Senior Class is cooperat
ing with the English Club to help
make this a success.
The twenty-eighth annual com
mencement, on Monday, June 16, will
begin at 10:30 a.m.. and Dr. Paul
Shorey of the University of Chicago
will give the address. That evening
the Senior Ball will he held at the
Vendome Hotel, San Jose. The danc
ing starts at 9 o'clock, and a chicken
dinner is to be enjoyed at 12.
Repeaters, except in firearms, are
not to be tolerated, and yet I do want
to impress upon every member of
the class of '19 that this is his or her
own Senior Week, regardless of
whether actual graduation takes place
or not. Be sure to sign the Senior
Scroll which is now in the Registrar's
office and to come out to help with
the Class Day exercises and to take
part in the various other Senior
Week activities.

the class of '19 that this is his or her
own Senior Week, regardless of
whether actual graduation takes place
or not. Be sure to sign the Senior
Scroll which is now in the Registrar's
office and to come out to help with
the Class Day exercises and to take
part in the various other Senior
Week activities.
OENIOR WEEK, this year promises
to be one of the best ever held at
Stanford. There seems to be an un
fortunate ideal prevalent among some
of us that Senior Week is only for
those who graduate at this time.
Many, who belong to the class of '19,
but who are not going to graduate on
the sixteenth, on account of having
been in government service or for
some other important reason, feel
perhaps that they are not included in
the Senior Week exercises. This,
however, is a very mistaken view of
the matter, for it is the duty of every
member of the class of '19 to take
part in the Senior exercises, in order
to make the week a complete suc
cess. All should feel that it is their
particular party and enter into it with
much enthusiasm.
The festivities begin on the evening
of June 12 with a presentation of
