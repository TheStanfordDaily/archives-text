# 1920 QUAD RECEIVES FAVORABLE CRITICISM
## 
### Eleanor Allen, '20 
"a record of a Stanford year—a
year of war that terminated in peace
and victory"—the 1920 Quad, which
makes its appearance today, is an un
qualified success. The concensus of
opinion which has come to me since the
first appearance of the book an hour
ago is that "it is the best Quad yet."
The Quad lias returned to ante-bellum
size and more, for it exceeds in the num
ber of pages the Junior publication of all
previous years. It now ranks in this
particular with the Blue and Gold of
the University of California. To pull
this book from ->ut of the depths which
threatened to engulf it during the fall
quarter of this year has been a Hercu
lean task, which merits the admiration
of all readers. Its editors may easily
rest on their well-deserved laurels.
"Comprehensive" best describes the
scope of the 1920 year-book. It includes
an account not only of college activities
of the present year, but of developing in
terests on the campus, such as the Me
morial Hall and other buildings now un
der construction. Alumni arc gratefully
remembered in a section devoted entirely
"to those who serve in the community,
the State and the Nation as successful
Stanford men and women." This in

novation section is particularly fitting
in the "Victory Quad," since past and
present Stanford people have been united
in one idea—victory. The large number
of pictures which fill these pages lends
a distinctly professional tone to the
book.
Pedro J. Lemos has done for this
publication of the Quad what he did for
the 1919 book, and in his effectively and
unusually colored paintings, has pre
sented the "dear old Quad" in varying
moods. The most suggestive picture,
and the one most in line with the domi
nating thought of the book, is that on
titled "Peace," which shows the interior
of the Memorial Church.
Another picture of especial value is
the highly artistic reproduction of the
"Angel of Grief," which fittingly intro
duces the pages devoted to the sixty-five
men who "died in service," who made it
possible that this might be called a
"Victory Quad."
A few words of criticism in regard to
the cuts may be not amiss, for no publi
cation should receive all praise, if only
for the good of its many authors. That
they are, in a few cases, somewhat
blurred is inexcusable. They are placed,
however, in a rather peculiar sequence,
so that the motivating principle which

units the illustrating cut to its story is
obscured. The profusion of the pictures
on every subject make up fairly, how
ever, for what lack in arrangement
exists.
Joshes form an essentially large part
of the book, as with every edition.
Here, as elsewhere, a quantity of cuts
livens the pages, and the "Razzes" launch
a particularly poignant attack upon the
sororities and fraternities. The "Na
tional Josh" introduces the fun of the
book, and echoes the "Rone Drv" issue
of Chapparal.
Much of the material of the book was
written by the 1921 tryoutees. To see
this class numeral attached to so many
names in the 1920 publication is some
what of a mental shock, to be explained
in this way. Whether this is an innova
tion or not is unknown, but it at least
throws a great deal of credit onto the
coming Junior class.
As a complete volume—and 1 do not
say this as a junior, but as a member of
the reading public—the 1920 Quad ranks
as the highest of its sister publications
ever appearing before a critical Stan
ford audience, and by common consent
it has already won the hearty praise, not
only of the Junior Class, but of all
Stanford men and women.

moods. The most suggestive picture,
and the one most in line with the domi
nating thought of the book, is that on
titled "Peace," which shows the interior
of the Memorial Church.
Another picture of especial value is
the highly artistic reproduction of the
"Angel of Grief," which fittingly intro
duces the pages devoted to the sixty-five
men who "died in service," who made it
possible that this might be called a
"Victory Quad."
A few words of criticism in regard to
the cuts may be not amiss, for no publi
cation should receive all praise, if only
for the good of its many authors. That
they are, in a few cases, somewhat
blurred is inexcusable. They are placed,
however, in a rather peculiar sequence,
so that the motivating principle which

units the illustrating cut to its story is
obscured. The profusion of the pictures
on every subject make up fairly, how
ever, for what lack in arrangement
exists.
Joshes form an essentially large part
of the book, as with every edition.
Here, as elsewhere, a quantity of cuts
livens the pages, and the "Razzes" launch
a particularly poignant attack upon the
sororities and fraternities. The "Na
tional Josh" introduces the fun of the
book, and echoes the "Rone Drv" issue
of Chapparal.
Much of the material of the book was
written by the 1921 tryoutees. To see
this class numeral attached to so many
names in the 1920 publication is some
what of a mental shock, to be explained
in this way. Whether this is an innova
tion or not is unknown, but it at least
throws a great deal of credit onto the
coming Junior class.
As a complete volume—and 1 do not
say this as a junior, but as a member of
the reading public—the 1920 Quad ranks
as the highest of its sister publications
ever appearing before a critical Stan
ford audience, and by common consent
it has already won the hearty praise, not
only of the Junior Class, but of all
Stanford men and women.
"a record of a Stanford year—a
year of war that terminated in peace
and victory"—the 1920 Quad, which
makes its appearance today, is an un
qualified success. The concensus of
opinion which has come to me since the
first appearance of the book an hour
ago is that "it is the best Quad yet."
The Quad lias returned to ante-bellum
size and more, for it exceeds in the num
ber of pages the Junior publication of all
previous years. It now ranks in this
particular with the Blue and Gold of
the University of California. To pull
this book from ->ut of the depths which
threatened to engulf it during the fall
quarter of this year has been a Hercu
lean task, which merits the admiration
of all readers. Its editors may easily
rest on their well-deserved laurels.
"Comprehensive" best describes the
scope of the 1920 year-book. It includes
an account not only of college activities
of the present year, but of developing in
terests on the campus, such as the Me
morial Hall and other buildings now un
der construction. Alumni arc gratefully
remembered in a section devoted entirely
"to those who serve in the community,
the State and the Nation as successful
Stanford men and women." This in

novation section is particularly fitting
in the "Victory Quad," since past and
present Stanford people have been united
in one idea—victory. The large number
of pictures which fill these pages lends
a distinctly professional tone to the
book.
Pedro J. Lemos has done for this
publication of the Quad what he did for
the 1919 book, and in his effectively and
unusually colored paintings, has pre
sented the "dear old Quad" in varying
moods. The most suggestive picture,
and the one most in line with the domi
nating thought of the book, is that on
titled "Peace," which shows the interior
of the Memorial Church.
