Garnett Holme, who is coaching the
English Club Pageant, has made some
interesting statements concerning it. He
said:
."The pageant is being aided in its
production not only by the University,
but bv the Palo Alto community. Many
Palo Alto organizations, notably the Na
tive Sons, arc taking an active part in the
spectacle itself. The presence of Dr.
Jordan re-enacting the inauguration
scene is tremendously important and
could be duplicated in no other impor
tant university. The presence of the
boys who served in Belgium also helps
to make the pageant a very real thing,
for it presents not merely actors play
ing a part, but the very individuals who
have passed through the actual experi
ences themselves.
"The place chosen, at the end of the
track oval, is well adapted to form a
setting for the many-colored historical
scenes which the pageant affords. A
great eucalyptus stands in the center of

the stage, and around it the Indians will
gather in council. Junipero Serra and
Portola pass quickly through the story
and are followed by the mysterious
Coutts scene. From then on the story
deals entirely with the work of service
undertaken by Stanford University. The
pageant concludes with an impressive
picture of the welcome given to her
sons when they have returned from
service overseas.
"There have been many pageants in
the state, but in none of these has there
been such a feling of intimacy and pro
prietorship as there is in the pageant of
sacrifice of Stanford. The participants
feel that they are portraying, and they
delight to honor their great Alma Mater
by presenting in dramatic form the un
selfish work which she has done for Cal
ifornia. Trnly, the university which she
helped to found may say with Mrs. Stan
ford, 'The children of California arc my
Children.'
