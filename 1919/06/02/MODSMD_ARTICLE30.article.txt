# PAGEANT WILL TELL HISTORY OF STANFORD
## 
### A. W. Leeds, '20 
DERHAPS no other spot in Cali
fornia has so romantic and varied
a history as the ground on which
Stanford is located. From the time
when Portola first attempted to claim
the land in the name of the king of
Spain till the present, innumerable
incidents in the story lend themselv
es readily to dramatization. It is this
historical background for the Stan
ford spirit that the pageant "Service"
attempts to depict. Many of the in
cidents must of necessity be omitted,
because of the wealth of material of
Stanford history; only a few of the
most typical of the central theme are
retained. Even so the remaining nine
scenes make a spectacle an hour and
a half in length in which a cast of
over four hundred persons is to be
used.
One of the most encouraging feat
of the production is the amount of
interest that has been aroused among
alumni and friends of Stanford by
the mere suggestion of a dramatiza
tion of the history of the University.
From every side suggestions, offers
of cooperation, subscriptions to the
pageant fund have poured into the
committee in charge. Some of the
ideas were originated by "Charlie"
Field, '95, who has taken an active
interest in the production from the
very beginning. Henry C. Peterson,
for many years curator of the Stan
ford museum, has offered useful sug
gestions. Even many of the older
residents of Palo Alto who knew
Peter Coutts, when that mysterious
person was trying to found an estate
on the present site of the Stanford
farm, have taken great interest in
that scene, to the extent of taking
parts in the pageant. Dr. Jordan's
re-delivering of his inaugural address,
before an audience, many of whom
participated in the original address,
and the re-enactment by the men of
the ambulance unit themselves of the
dedication of the first American flag
011 foreign soil in the Great War,
make the event of historical import
ance.
Old stockmen, who once were act
ively engaged around the Stanford
horses, will take part in the Peter
Coutts scene, with some of the last
of the Stanford trotters, direct de
scendents of Electioneer, participat
ing. A march of the Old Guard, or
professors of the first years of the
University, will be a feature in the
first inaugural scene. Student life,
or the play spirit, will be shown in
(he rally scene, with the plug-ugly,
sports and even Chappie represented.
The C. R. 8., or Commission for Re
lief in Belgium, will also have a part
in the pageant as well as the presen
tation of colors, with the R. O. T. C.,
S. A. T. C., and N. A. T. C., particip
ating.
Allegorial representations will be
made of the country before the com
ing of the Padres, followed by an
Indian ritual before the Palo Alto
Tree, including such dances as the
Fire Ceremony, Invocation, etc. Spe
cial aesthetic and Indian dances have
been prepared for this scene. With
the coming of the Padres, Father
Junipero Serra, as portrayed by Pro
fessor 11. I). Gray, will be seen, visited
by the vision of Santa Clara. Further
nllegorial scenes will be those of the
Alma Mater and the academic spirit.
The development of the spirit of the
Alma Mater, out of the great grief,
and the coming of the children of
Stanford, will be shown. Academic
â€¢pirit of the University, as was rep
resented in the fuize of the march
of civilization, on Memorial Arch, will
follow the first inaugural, and be the
companion of the play spirit. In fact,
everything that will contribute to
wards making a complete record of
Stanford history, will be included in
the pageant.
The pageant will be given on the
night of June 14, and will come as
the culmination of the alumni re
union week, which is expected to see
by far the greatest re-gathering of
former Stanford men and women
since the foundation of the Universi
ty. It will be staged in the east end
of the track oval and will begin at
8:30, giving opportunity for the light
ing effects which always add to the
impressiveness of out-of-door produc
tions of this sort. Seats are being
sold in San Francisco and various
places on the Peninsula, as well as
at Palo Alto and Stanford, and pre
parations are being made for an audi
ence of several thousand. *
