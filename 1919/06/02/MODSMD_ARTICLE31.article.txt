## LOOKING FORWARD 
### 
117ITH today's issue of the Daily Palo Alto the last Magazine Supplement
for the present academic term is published. This section of the campus
daily which has been in existence for only two months, was intended pri
marily to be an outlet for student opinion. Looking backward over its re
cently begun and short career, it may be said without any undue amount of
assertiveness that the Magazine Supplement has accomplished its purpose.
Through its weekly edition the sentiments of students on the pertinent
questions of the day have been voiced. Student control, freshman discipline,
athletic control and policy, women's activities, campus pupblications, dra
matics and the shimmee have all received their respective shares of critic
ism. One these and other subjects many opinions have been offered; others
have been solicited. But regardless of the way in which the criticism came
to the forum, it has aroused an interest worth cultivating.
Looking forward to another Stanford year, and, necessarily, to another
Daily Palo Alto year, it is to be hop«»d that further and better use of the
Magazine Supplement will be made With the enthusiasm and initiative
which always accompany the beginning of a now year, student opinion should
be up and doing next fall. At the end of the present year, as at the end of
and definite period of time, many suggestions as to how this and that could
have been done better are heard. In fact, at the end any year more adverse
criticism is voiced than at any other time. People are inclined to see the
mistakes that have been made more clearly when they can make a com
plete resume of the situation in their minds. But, of course, late criticism
does more harm than good if it can not be applied directly. So, instead of
criticizing what has already been completed, why not for next year lay
out a stronger and more efficient basis for the systems with which we now
find fault? In all probability much of the adverse and useless criticism at
the end of the year would be obviated if at. the beginning a good amount
of suggestive and constructive criticism were made. To this end it is hoped
that the Magazine Supplement will be used from the very start next year—
that's what it's for!
