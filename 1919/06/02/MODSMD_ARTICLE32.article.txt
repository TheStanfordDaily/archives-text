rrHE history of the development ol
*■ the Stanford Library is an inter
esting one. At the beginning of the
nineteenth century there were twen
ty-one college libraries in the United
States —at the close there were al
together 640. Stanford Library was
founded in 1891 and ranked in size
at the bottom of the list. Today it
is second on the Pacific Coast and is
one of the well-known libraries of
the country. In comparison, its
growth has been a rapid one. Har
vard, founded in the seventeenth cen
tury was 216 years in collecting
85,000 volumes—while Stanford was
only fourteen years in accamplishing
the same thing.
The library opened its doors on the
first day of the University's exist
ence. It was located in Room 2, of
the inner Quad. The first month re
corded the use of 1,071 books. This
number has steadily increased since
then.
During the first years of its growth
the library secured help in donations
of books and money. Timothy Hop
kins gave his railroad library of
1000 volumes and continued for sev
eral years to give for its support
several thousand dollars each year.
John T. Doyle of Menlo Park gave
for some time the annual sum of $150.
In 1896 Hanch and Hayden Society

of San Francisco presented the
Choral Works of 2000 volumes and
3000 leaflets. In 1897 the first install
ment of the Australian Collection ar
rived from Thomas Welton Stanford,
a brother of Senator Stanford, num
bering 2000 volumes and pamphlets.
In 1900 Charles Lathrop, brother of
Mrs. Stanford, gave $200 for the pur
chase of books relating to California,
adding to the sum each year. Dr.
Jordan gave a valuable and unique
collection of books relating to the
subject of fishes. Ex-Mayor Phelan
of San Francisco gave $1,000 for
economic books. In 1898 the Law
Library received the private oollec

tion of Trustee Francis E. Spencer
and 1000 volumes from Justice Steph
en J. Field and Judge Lorenzo B.
Sawyer. These are but a few of the
many names that are now on the
list of donors.
Some eight years after its founding,
the library was moved into its pres
ent site. Approximately $150,000
was donated by Thomas Stanford to
be used for any purpose which the
University saw fit. The laying of
the cornerstone on November 2, 1898,
was very impressive, and marks one
of the important days in the history
of Stanford. Dr. Jordan opened the
ceremonies with a short address on
the progress of the University and
H. C. Nash, librarian, told of the life
of the donator. Just before the stone
was placed on the northeast corner
of the building, a letter was read
written by Mrs. Stanford, giving the
contents of the copper box placed
under it. The list was as follows:
University register 1891-1898; cir
cular 1-5; Leland Stanford's plan of
the University; grants, founding and
endowments; description of property
embraced in the grants; copy of Se
quoia of October 28, '98; photograph
of Thomas Stanford; coins of the
day, from five cents to $20.00 in gold;
copies of newspapers of day; letter
written by Mrs. Stanford, containing
detailed account of the circumstances

connected with the idea of founding
the new library building; copy of
hymn sung at laying of corner stone;
copy of Holy Bible and a Crucifix.
At that time a Crucifix had been
placed in the corner stone of the
Quadrangle, Museum and Library.
The building was ready for use on
Friday, January 19. 1900. Many pro
fessors dismissed their classes to
help in the moving of books, which
process occupied an hour and a half.
The library numbered at that time
about 47,000 volumes, and some 5,000
pamphlets.
Although the new biulding was well
adapted for that time, it soon be

came apparent that more room would
be needed. In the fall of 1904 work
was begun on a beautiful, big new
library building that was to cost
$600,000. This building, demolished
by the great earthquake of 1906, was
to have been three stories, made of
the prevailing buff sandstone and
capped by a great central glass dome,
90 feet in diameter. The arrange
ments for the interior were the most
modern known; a circular stock room
with space for 100.000 volumes, floors
of solid oak and a stairway of white
marble.
Plans were made for a binding and
packing room and space for thou
sands of shelved pamphlets in the
basement.
Mrs. Stanford gave $350,000 of her
own money toward the erection of
this building. The corner stone,
which may still be seen, the only re
maining land mark of the site, was
laid on May 15, 1905 and the letter
read, written by Mrs. Stanford told
of the gift of jewels by which the
future growth of the library was as
sured. These proceeds are known as,
"The Jewel Fund." Once before
these jewels were given to tide over
the dark days of the [University's
career, but it was not necessary to
use them then. The comparative
estimate of the worth of the jewels,
consisting of diamonds, rubies, emer
alds, and other precious stones, was
$500,000i. .
From the beginning the purpose
of the library has been one of help
fulness. This idea is a fundamental
one in the founding of the University.
Senator Stanford said in 1891, "Stu
dents are the most important factor
in this University." The growth of
the library is directed largely by a
body of expert advisers, the Univer
sity faculty. Each department is al
lowed a certain portion of each ap
propriation for its particular needs.
Little buying has been done for the
future, but more for needs as they
arise. The future of the Stanford
Library is a bright one. Once again
a great, beautiful new building is be
ing erected for its occupancy. This
building will be one of the finest of
its kind in the country and is well
adapted for a library that holds as
its aim "to be the highest thought
of the University."

rrHE history of the development ol
*■ the Stanford Library is an inter
esting one. At the beginning of the
nineteenth century there were twen
ty-one college libraries in the United
States —at the close there were al
together 640. Stanford Library was
founded in 1891 and ranked in size
at the bottom of the list. Today it
is second on the Pacific Coast and is
one of the well-known libraries of
the country. In comparison, its
growth has been a rapid one. Har
vard, founded in the seventeenth cen
tury was 216 years in collecting
85,000 volumes—while Stanford was
only fourteen years in accamplishing
the same thing.
The library opened its doors on the
first day of the University's exist
ence. It was located in Room 2, of
the inner Quad. The first month re
corded the use of 1,071 books. This
number has steadily increased since
then.
During the first years of its growth
the library secured help in donations
of books and money. Timothy Hop
kins gave his railroad library of
1000 volumes and continued for sev
eral years to give for its support
several thousand dollars each year.
John T. Doyle of Menlo Park gave
for some time the annual sum of $150.
In 1896 Hanch and Hayden Society

of San Francisco presented the
Choral Works of 2000 volumes and
3000 leaflets. In 1897 the first install
ment of the Australian Collection ar
rived from Thomas Welton Stanford,
a brother of Senator Stanford, num
bering 2000 volumes and pamphlets.
In 1900 Charles Lathrop, brother of
Mrs. Stanford, gave $200 for the pur
chase of books relating to California,
adding to the sum each year. Dr.
Jordan gave a valuable and unique
collection of books relating to the
subject of fishes. Ex-Mayor Phelan
of San Francisco gave $1,000 for
economic books. In 1898 the Law
Library received the private oollec

tion of Trustee Francis E. Spencer
and 1000 volumes from Justice Steph
en J. Field and Judge Lorenzo B.
Sawyer. These are but a few of the
many names that are now on the
list of donors.
Some eight years after its founding,
the library was moved into its pres
ent site. Approximately $150,000
was donated by Thomas Stanford to
be used for any purpose which the
University saw fit. The laying of
the cornerstone on November 2, 1898,
was very impressive, and marks one
of the important days in the history
of Stanford. Dr. Jordan opened the
ceremonies with a short address on
the progress of the University and
H. C. Nash, librarian, told of the life
of the donator. Just before the stone
was placed on the northeast corner
of the building, a letter was read
written by Mrs. Stanford, giving the
contents of the copper box placed
under it. The list was as follows:
University register 1891-1898; cir
cular 1-5; Leland Stanford's plan of
the University; grants, founding and
endowments; description of property
embraced in the grants; copy of Se
quoia of October 28, '98; photograph
of Thomas Stanford; coins of the
day, from five cents to $20.00 in gold;
copies of newspapers of day; letter
written by Mrs. Stanford, containing
detailed account of the circumstances

connected with the idea of founding
the new library building; copy of
hymn sung at laying of corner stone;
copy of Holy Bible and a Crucifix.
At that time a Crucifix had been
placed in the corner stone of the
Quadrangle, Museum and Library.
The building was ready for use on
Friday, January 19. 1900. Many pro
fessors dismissed their classes to
help in the moving of books, which
process occupied an hour and a half.
The library numbered at that time
about 47,000 volumes, and some 5,000
pamphlets.
Although the new biulding was well
adapted for that time, it soon be

came apparent that more room would
be needed. In the fall of 1904 work
was begun on a beautiful, big new
library building that was to cost
$600,000. This building, demolished
by the great earthquake of 1906, was
to have been three stories, made of
the prevailing buff sandstone and
capped by a great central glass dome,
90 feet in diameter. The arrange
ments for the interior were the most
modern known; a circular stock room
with space for 100.000 volumes, floors
of solid oak and a stairway of white
marble.
Plans were made for a binding and
packing room and space for thou
sands of shelved pamphlets in the
basement.
Mrs. Stanford gave $350,000 of her
own money toward the erection of
this building. The corner stone,
which may still be seen, the only re
maining land mark of the site, was
laid on May 15, 1905 and the letter
read, written by Mrs. Stanford told
of the gift of jewels by which the

about 47,000 volumes, and some 5,000
pamphlets.
Although the new biulding was well
adapted for that time, it soon be

came apparent that more room would
be needed. In the fall of 1904 work
was begun on a beautiful, big new
library building that was to cost
$600,000. This building, demolished
by the great earthquake of 1906, was
to have been three stories, made of
the prevailing buff sandstone and
capped by a great central glass dome,
90 feet in diameter. The arrange
ments for the interior were the most
modern known; a circular stock room
with space for 100.000 volumes, floors
of solid oak and a stairway of white
marble.
Plans were made for a binding and
packing room and space for thou
sands of shelved pamphlets in the
basement.
Mrs. Stanford gave $350,000 of her
own money toward the erection of
this building. The corner stone,
which may still be seen, the only re
maining land mark of the site, was
laid on May 15, 1905 and the letter
read, written by Mrs. Stanford told
of the gift of jewels by which the
future growth of the library was as
sured. These proceeds are known as,
"The Jewel Fund." Once before
these jewels were given to tide over
the dark days of the [University's
career, but it was not necessary to
use them then. The comparative
estimate of the worth of the jewels,
consisting of diamonds, rubies, emer
alds, and other precious stones, was
$500,000i. .
From the beginning the purpose
of the library has been one of help
fulness. This idea is a fundamental
one in the founding of the University.
Senator Stanford said in 1891, "Stu
dents are the most important factor
in this University." The growth of
the library is directed largely by a
body of expert advisers, the Univer
sity faculty. Each department is al
lowed a certain portion of each ap
propriation for its particular needs.
Little buying has been done for the
future, but more for needs as they
arise. The future of the Stanford
Library is a bright one. Once again
a great, beautiful new building is be
ing erected for its occupancy. This
building will be one of the finest of
its kind in the country and is well
adapted for a library that holds as
its aim "to be the highest thought
of the University."

rrHE history of the development ol
*■ the Stanford Library is an inter
esting one. At the beginning of the
nineteenth century there were twen
ty-one college libraries in the United
States —at the close there were al
together 640. Stanford Library was
founded in 1891 and ranked in size
at the bottom of the list. Today it
is second on the Pacific Coast and is
one of the well-known libraries of
the country. In comparison, its
growth has been a rapid one. Har
vard, founded in the seventeenth cen
tury was 216 years in collecting
85,000 volumes—while Stanford was
only fourteen years in accamplishing
the same thing.
The library opened its doors on the
first day of the University's exist
ence. It was located in Room 2, of
the inner Quad. The first month re
corded the use of 1,071 books. This
number has steadily increased since
then.
During the first years of its growth
the library secured help in donations
of books and money. Timothy Hop
kins gave his railroad library of
1000 volumes and continued for sev
eral years to give for its support
several thousand dollars each year.
John T. Doyle of Menlo Park gave
for some time the annual sum of $150.
In 1896 Hanch and Hayden Society

of San Francisco presented the
Choral Works of 2000 volumes and
3000 leaflets. In 1897 the first install
ment of the Australian Collection ar
rived from Thomas Welton Stanford,
a brother of Senator Stanford, num
bering 2000 volumes and pamphlets.
In 1900 Charles Lathrop, brother of
Mrs. Stanford, gave $200 for the pur
chase of books relating to California,
adding to the sum each year. Dr.
Jordan gave a valuable and unique
collection of books relating to the
subject of fishes. Ex-Mayor Phelan
of San Francisco gave $1,000 for
economic books. In 1898 the Law
Library received the private oollec

tion of Trustee Francis E. Spencer
and 1000 volumes from Justice Steph
en J. Field and Judge Lorenzo B.
Sawyer. These are but a few of the
many names that are now on the
list of donors.
Some eight years after its founding,
the library was moved into its pres
ent site. Approximately $150,000
was donated by Thomas Stanford to
be used for any purpose which the
University saw fit. The laying of
the cornerstone on November 2, 1898,
was very impressive, and marks one
of the important days in the history
of Stanford. Dr. Jordan opened the
ceremonies with a short address on
the progress of the University and
H. C. Nash, librarian, told of the life
of the donator. Just before the stone
was placed on the northeast corner
of the building, a letter was read
written by Mrs. Stanford, giving the
contents of the copper box placed
under it. The list was as follows:
University register 1891-1898; cir
cular 1-5; Leland Stanford's plan of
the University; grants, founding and
endowments; description of property
embraced in the grants; copy of Se
quoia of October 28, '98; photograph
of Thomas Stanford; coins of the
day, from five cents to $20.00 in gold;
copies of newspapers of day; letter
written by Mrs. Stanford, containing
detailed account of the circumstances

connected with the idea of founding
the new library building; copy of
hymn sung at laying of corner stone;
copy of Holy Bible and a Crucifix.
At that time a Crucifix had been
placed in the corner stone of the
Quadrangle, Museum and Library.
The building was ready for use on
Friday, January 19. 1900. Many pro
fessors dismissed their classes to
help in the moving of books, which
process occupied an hour and a half.
