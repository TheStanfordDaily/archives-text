Doctor J. M. Buckley, the Methodist
divine, was asked one day to conduct an
"experience meeting" at a eolored church
in the South.
A colored woman arose and bore wit
ness to the preciousness of her religion
as light-hringer and comfort-giver.
"That's good, sister!" commented
Doctor Buckley. "But now about the
practical side. Does your religion make
you strive to prepare your husband a
good dinner? Does it make you look
after him in every way?"
Just then Doctor Bucklcy felt a yank
at his coat tails by the colored preacher
who whispered ardently: "Press dem
questions, Doctor; press dem questions.
Dat's my wife!"— Ladies' Home Journal.
