# GREAT NEED OF JOURNALISM DEPARTMENT IS NOW EVIDENT
## 
### Eleanor Allen, '20 
THE Stanford journalism department
has gone the way of all flesh, and
and a large number of devoted stu
dents remain to mourn its demise. \
The effect has been sudden and
marked on the campus publications,
which now attempt to run without a
guiding hand. It is undeniable that j
local journalism has been limping
painfully since last year, when it was
under the close technical supervision
of the then existing journalism dei
partment.
At present there are no courses 1
given in newspaper work, and what'
an enthusiastic and earnest Stanford 1
man gets in this line he gets through ;
the work on the Daily Palo Alto. The
campus daily makes no attempt to
teach the writing of news, and cannot I
do it, while each day putting out a j
paper. Tryoutees, of whom there are
many, and who must from the first;
write their news in an interesting and
professional way, begin their work
knowing nothing about the technical
side of the newspaper story. Their
work suffers as a consequence, and
in its turn, the paper reaps the tares
of the neophytes' sowing.
During the period of the existence |
of the embryo department (for it must
be admitted that there was room for
growth), the registration in it became;
constantly larger. Stanford was mak
ing a reputation for herself as one of!
the few exponents of this distinctive ;
profession. The University of Cali
fornia scheduled no courses in journal-;
ism. Stanford alone, in the southern
and western states, save Washington
University, held regular classes in
the work.
Now, however, the registration is I
falling away rapidly, for no induce-,
ments remain to one interested in!
this particular field. Students seek 1
Washington University on the coast,
or go Eeast for their undergraduate
work. If they remain here they are
forced to postpone this side of their'
study until their postgraduate year, i
At present there are three honor
organizations for those displaying

marked interest and talent in journal
ism. Iwo of these (both for men)
have been revived this year with the
return of the men from service. The
other, a national fraternity for women,
took a most active and vital part in
the affairs of the literary and news
paper world during the war, when the
majority of men were gone. The
members of these organizations are
actively concerned with some form of
journalism on the campus, and in
terestedly await developments. In the
slang of the newspaper office, they
are hoping that something definite
will break.
Not only is the absence of journal
ism in its limited sense of writing
news, lamented, but the dozen and
more varied fields which ramify into
that of journalism proper, are missed
as well. Advertising has become a
distinct profession closely allied to
that of publishing and issuing a paper
or magazine, but nevertheless re
quiring special training and prepara
tion. Its study comes under the same
general department and has already
attracted a large number of students
who intend to go into it as a perma
nent profession. Every well versed
newspaperman as well, should know
the advertising game in a general
way.
More extensive courses would be
impossible at first, undoubtedly, al
though the demand for them exists
even now.
As the department grows in num
ber, photography, which plays such
an important part in the life of any
publication, could be dealt with to
some extent, including instructions as
to the effective use of it, and of car
toons. Typesetting, too, the real
power behind the throne in an office,
is essential to the education of every
expert journalist, and today it is the
expert who is demanded.
Many of the dreams given above
are merely dreams, which may or
may not be realized in the distant
future. But the beginning of a
journalism department is possible
now, and it is for its beginning that
its advocates are hoping and waiting.
