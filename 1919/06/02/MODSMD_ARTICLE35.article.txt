# NEGLECT OF TRADITIONS MEANS LACK OF SPIRIT

### Clytie Sweet, '21 
OOBLE bridge is to he destroyed!
Consternation reigns. Where will
another spot be found that can equal
the historic old bridge, which sur
passes even the cactus garden in the
weird spell it casts over queeners?
Murmuring waters, kindly inclined
trees with mystical foliage, rails
carved with initials and names, vest
iges of other journeys to the bridge
are all found at the end of Lover's
Lane. What can ever supplant it?
Resentment and high feeling are
aroused among the students, especi
ally the upperclassmen, as to the re
moval of the old landmark. Around
Roble bridge centers college tradition.
Destroy it, and the main link in the
chain that binds old traditional cus
toms and haunts together is de
stroyed.
But does it? That is the question.
Is Roble bridge the center spot, to
which the lake, the cactus garden and
Lathrop's Lookout must give obse
quence? Perhaps it is just as well
that Roble bridge is to be removed,
for then attention will be called to
other spots and haunts even more
significant than it, (hat have been
neglected and forgotten. Before the
war these haunts at least were recog
nized, but now they seem to be utter
ly forgotten. A senior remarked just
the other day, "Why, there is no other
place to go about Stanford —nothing
else to see." When asked if he had
visited such and such place, he re
plied, 'Why no. Never heard of it.
Thought 1 knew the campus by heart.
In fact, I do know more about it than
most, of the fellows."
Herein lies one of the fundamental
causes for the lack of Stanford spirit
and it is why the freshmen feel that
they have not had the proper instruc
tion as to what constitutes Stanford
spirit and Stanford ideals. And can

you blame them? Behind everything
that has any significance, lies atmos
phere, and the Stanford atmosphere
is not confined to the starlit and
broad path that leads up the row, or
down to Palo Alto, or over to. En
ema or Roble. Such places are mere
ly duplicates of other college cam
puses, and no special significance can
be attached to them to distinguish
them. But to obtain a true knowledge
as to what forms the background of
the Stanford spirit, we must go to the
campus itself, find the historical old
haunts, and feel the spirit that the
students of previous years fondly call
to mind as forming an integral part
of the "farm."
For instance, many and many are
the tales that hang around the Senior
Oak and the oaks of '95, where 'twas
pleasant accidentally to meet and
discuss topics of the day, without the
supervision of the library authorities
intervening. Then too, there was a
spot, in an ivy-covered mound, where
one could converse softly without
fear of being disturbed. How many
have noticed the old winery where
Stanford professors < I dare not men
tion their names, as they are still on
the faculty), used to procure bever
ages other than milk? Another spot
worth finding is the peacock's lair;
or do the students know that we
have a herd of some twenty peacocks
strolling around? They are near the
cactus garden, and are accountable
for the strange, alarming cries that
break the stillness there.
Farther off, but still connected with
Stanford and Stanford traditions, is
the cedar-vaulted walk at Cedro Cot
tage, where but tiny patches of blue
sky are visible in the green-vaulted
roof. And the Frenchman's tunnels —
how many know the two that are
beamed, and the one that goes toward
