# MINOR SPORTS GAIN FAVOR
## 
### R. D. Campbell, '22 
"MINOR sports at Stanford win
take their respective places be
side football, baseball, and track in
several years," Athletic Director
Knollin is quoted as saying. "Tennis
swimming, wrestling, soccer, and
boxing have a brilliant future before
them." This situation is not mere
"typewriter gossip," but a plain fact
lhat seems to be the general concen
sus of opinion. Minor sports have
taken a leap into the limelight this
year, and in another year or so, they
should be classed as part of Stan
ford's athletic schedule.
For several years past, minor
sports have been on the decline at
Stanford. Last year and even in the
'19 season, they showed some real
improvement both in attendance at
games and meets, and in the spirit
shown by the athletes themselves. It
is only in very recent times that
wrestling has drawn record crowds
to the annual Stanford-California
tournament, that tennis teams have
been suported to some extent in their
meets with other clubs, and thai
swimming has drawn capacity crowds
to the almost weekly aquatic meets.
Stanford athletic fans have certainly
shown the "old spirit" this year, and
prophecies are that the same old
spirit will persist in the future minor
sport events.
Wrestling this year has been a
success in every way. A record
crowd attended the annual Stanford-
California tourney at Encina Gym
nasium last Friday night. Both fresh
man and varsity teams have worked
consistently since early last January,
and in most every instance the local
mat men have been victorious in the
meets. Tournaments with the San
Francisco Y. M. C. A., and meets with
the Palo Alto High School and other
such clubs have given the Stanford
wrestlers a good hold on the ath
letic calendar. Coach Jones has put
out a winning team this year and as
far as is known, all of this year's
team will be back at Stanford next
fall. A big wrestling season is looked
for next spring and a repetition of
this year's intercollegiate victory.
Tennis has kept its usual place
this year, though it is true that in
terest in the meets has caused a larg
er attendance this year than ever
before. In tennis, Devlin as captain,
has put out something new in the
line of a tennis team. For the past
couple of years, tennis has been
"under the weather." Though the
meets have not been largely attended
this year, considerable interest has
been displayed by the large number

of men out for the activity. Every J
court at Encina has been tilled each
afternoon to capacity and it is
thought by competent dopesters that
next year will bring out a winning
tennis team. Probably the addition
of a few badly needed bleachers at
the Encina courts will suffice to
bring out the necessary boosters for
the- big meet next year. Captain
Devlin says:"The 1920 tennis team
will be a 'world beater' and I am
confident that with student backing
and the old men back on the court,
the year should bring victory to
Stanford."
Swimming under the direction of
Captain Caughey and Director Brand
sten has held its regular place, Stan
ford having won its share of the
meets with California and other in
stitutions on the coast. The meets
held at Encina Gym have been large
ly attended and "Earnie" Brand
sten states that next year will see a
repetition of this year's meets. He
also believes that more meets will
be held and that more coast universi
ties will compete with Stanford. This
alone should encourage swimming at
Stanford.
Boxing is one of the minor sports
that has a brilliant future at Stan
ford. At California, boxing has en
tered into athletics as a permanent
sport. Large crowds turn out to all
the intercollegiate meets and usually
there are a number of interclub
tournaments, which are likewise well
attended. This year in Berkeley, at
the Cardinal-Blue and Gold fight,
there was a large enthusiastic crowd
present. California backs up all her
teams, whether in major or minor
sports, and helps them on to victory.
That has been California's aim to a
certain degree; never to lose a single
game or meet. Whether or not Stan
ford has had this policy, is not neces
sary to discuss, but it is evident that
Stanford .has had the edge on most
intercollegiate sports for the past two
or three years. However, if stu
dents would back upp their minor
sports, and help them on to victory
in the big meets, they would be do
ing a service to their college that
would be priceless.
After all, it is the men in the minor
sports that ultimately furnish many
of the stars for the varsity track,
baseball, basketball, and football
teams. By giving these men the
necessary support, putting minor
sports on par with other athletics
about Stanford, and showing an in
terest in athletics as a whole, Stan
ford men and women will put Stan
ford University in the lead of any
other college.

of men out for the activity. Every J
court at Encina has been tilled each
afternoon to capacity and it is
thought by competent dopesters that
next year will bring out a winning
tennis team. Probably the addition
of a few badly needed bleachers at
the Encina courts will suffice to
bring out the necessary boosters for
the- big meet next year. Captain
Devlin says:"The 1920 tennis team
will be a 'world beater' and I am
confident that with student backing
and the old men back on the court,
the year should bring victory to
Stanford."
Swimming under the direction of
Captain Caughey and Director Brand
sten has held its regular place, Stan
ford having won its share of the
meets with California and other in
stitutions on the coast. The meets
held at Encina Gym have been large
ly attended and "Earnie" Brand
sten states that next year will see a
repetition of this year's meets. He
also believes that more meets will
be held and that more coast universi
ties will compete with Stanford. This
alone should encourage swimming at
Stanford.
Boxing is one of the minor sports
that has a brilliant future at Stan
ford. At California, boxing has en
tered into athletics as a permanent
sport. Large crowds turn out to all
the intercollegiate meets and usually
there are a number of interclub
tournaments, which are likewise well
attended. This year in Berkeley, at
the Cardinal-Blue and Gold fight,
there was a large enthusiastic crowd
present. California backs up all her
teams, whether in major or minor
sports, and helps them on to victory.
That has been California's aim to a
certain degree; never to lose a single
game or meet. Whether or not Stan
ford has had this policy, is not neces
sary to discuss, but it is evident that
Stanford .has had the edge on most
intercollegiate sports for the past two
or three years. However, if stu
dents would back upp their minor
sports, and help them on to victory
in the big meets, they would be do
ing a service to their college that
would be priceless.
After all, it is the men in the minor
sports that ultimately furnish many
of the stars for the varsity track,
baseball, basketball, and football
teams. By giving these men the
necessary support, putting minor
sports on par with other athletics
about Stanford, and showing an in
terest in athletics as a whole, Stan
ford men and women will put Stan
ford University in the lead of any
other college.
"MINOR sports at Stanford win
take their respective places be
side football, baseball, and track in
several years," Athletic Director
Knollin is quoted as saying. "Tennis
swimming, wrestling, soccer, and
boxing have a brilliant future before
them." This situation is not mere
"typewriter gossip," but a plain fact
lhat seems to be the general concen
sus of opinion. Minor sports have
taken a leap into the limelight this
year, and in another year or so, they
should be classed as part of Stan
ford's athletic schedule.
For several years past, minor
sports have been on the decline at
Stanford. Last year and even in the
'19 season, they showed some real
improvement both in attendance at
games and meets, and in the spirit
shown by the athletes themselves. It
is only in very recent times that
wrestling has drawn record crowds
to the annual Stanford-California
tournament, that tennis teams have
been suported to some extent in their
meets with other clubs, and thai
swimming has drawn capacity crowds
to the almost weekly aquatic meets.
Stanford athletic fans have certainly
shown the "old spirit" this year, and
prophecies are that the same old
spirit will persist in the future minor
sport events.
Wrestling this year has been a
success in every way. A record
crowd attended the annual Stanford-
California tourney at Encina Gym
nasium last Friday night. Both fresh
man and varsity teams have worked
consistently since early last January,
and in most every instance the local
mat men have been victorious in the
meets. Tournaments with the San
Francisco Y. M. C. A., and meets with
the Palo Alto High School and other
such clubs have given the Stanford
wrestlers a good hold on the ath
letic calendar. Coach Jones has put
out a winning team this year and as
far as is known, all of this year's
team will be back at Stanford next
fall. A big wrestling season is looked
for next spring and a repetition of
this year's intercollegiate victory.
Tennis has kept its usual place
this year, though it is true that in
terest in the meets has caused a larg
er attendance this year than ever
before. In tennis, Devlin as captain,
has put out something new in the
line of a tennis team. For the past
couple of years, tennis has been
"under the weather." Though the
meets have not been largely attended
this year, considerable interest has
been displayed by the large number

of men out for the activity. Every J
court at Encina has been tilled each
