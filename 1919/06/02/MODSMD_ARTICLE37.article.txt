# Street Car Stage or Jitney Bus?
## 
### J. W. Bucklin, 20 
patiently waiting for thirty
five minutes this morning for the
Palo Alto street car to wander around
to where I happened to be standing,
the thought of whether or not there
could be some remedy for this very
erratic transportation system struck
me.
In the first place as a means of
locomotion these splendid one-man
street car animals are a flat failure.
The one remaining use of the Palo
Alto street car system ends 011 July
first, when the street car line poles
will be needed no longer as a sole
means of support for nightly wander
ers returning from Menlo.
There was a time when we had a
semi-efficient street car system, but
that was long ago. The motormen
used to be vaccinated before they
could operate a car, but now they are
let alone, for the company well knows
that they will never catch anything.
Now the street car company has no
more use for a live man than an
undertaker. "Walk, if you get tired,"
is the two-foot rule 011 the Palo Alto
car line. In addition these cars that
are in use at present require a rest
every so often, so the motormen get
out and smoke for half an hour or so
while "catching up time" at the end
of each run. Just whether the cars
need to cool or the men need to get

out in order to keep up their flagging
] circulation, I do not know, but they
|
j do at any rate.
Consider the service we are getting
at present. After waiting until you
I give up hope, you see far off in the
| distance this little ambling speck of
j a car come bobbing along, like a
( roller coaster on a picnic. Explain
| ing that it is gradually loosing money
owing to the heavy war tax on NEW
rails, and on excess war profits, this
tender-hearted company refuses to ab
scond with more than six cents from
each victim. Then you are taken
prisoner on one of these pay-as-you
enter contraptions, where you get
jolted, bounced, and battered for an
hour or so, while endeavoring to make
some engagement that you know you
won't.
But perhaps, It seems that there
can be no remedy, as the autocratic
company has clearly refused to listen
to student appeals. What about the
| humble little jitney? What is the
matter with a jitney service that
would run clear up the row, and only
charge five cents at that? With an
adequate line of jitney busses, such
las the campus would support, there
could be five minute service to Palo
Alto, and the trip would be made with
I far less wasted time, greater comfort,
and at cheaper rates than we have
| under our present system. This pro

posed line of jitney busses could
operate down the row and past En
cina on into Palo Alto, and would
make the round trip in about half the
time it takes the present street car
to make one way.
Why is it then that we don't have
this system, so clearly an advantage
over the old-fashioned street car stage
coaches now in use? For the simple
reason that we haven't wanted it
hard enough or unitedly enough. If
the campus would stand together in
demanding some adequate service, it
would be obtained. Let us try it for a
while, anyhow, and see if we can't
get some service for the street car
patrons and less for the moss-covered
vested rights of our flagging street
car system.

used to be vaccinated before they
could operate a car, but now they are
let alone, for the company well knows
that they will never catch anything.
Now the street car company has no
more use for a live man than an
undertaker. "Walk, if you get tired,"
is the two-foot rule 011 the Palo Alto
car line. In addition these cars that
are in use at present require a rest
every so often, so the motormen get
out and smoke for half an hour or so
while "catching up time" at the end
of each run. Just whether the cars
need to cool or the men need to get

out in order to keep up their flagging
] circulation, I do not know, but they
|
j do at any rate.
Consider the service we are getting
at present. After waiting until you
I give up hope, you see far off in the
| distance this little ambling speck of
j a car come bobbing along, like a
( roller coaster on a picnic. Explain
| ing that it is gradually loosing money
owing to the heavy war tax on NEW
rails, and on excess war profits, this
tender-hearted company refuses to ab
scond with more than six cents from
each victim. Then you are taken
prisoner on one of these pay-as-you
enter contraptions, where you get
jolted, bounced, and battered for an
hour or so, while endeavoring to make
some engagement that you know you
won't.
But perhaps, It seems that there
can be no remedy, as the autocratic
company has clearly refused to listen
to student appeals. What about the
| humble little jitney? What is the
matter with a jitney service that
would run clear up the row, and only
charge five cents at that? With an
adequate line of jitney busses, such
las the campus would support, there
could be five minute service to Palo
Alto, and the trip would be made with
I far less wasted time, greater comfort,
and at cheaper rates than we have
| under our present system. This pro

posed line of jitney busses could
operate down the row and past En
cina on into Palo Alto, and would
make the round trip in about half the
time it takes the present street car
to make one way.
Why is it then that we don't have
this system, so clearly an advantage
over the old-fashioned street car stage
coaches now in use? For the simple
reason that we haven't wanted it
hard enough or unitedly enough. If
the campus would stand together in
demanding some adequate service, it
would be obtained. Let us try it for a
while, anyhow, and see if we can't
get some service for the street car
patrons and less for the moss-covered
vested rights of our flagging street
car system.
patiently waiting for thirty
five minutes this morning for the
Palo Alto street car to wander around
to where I happened to be standing,
the thought of whether or not there
could be some remedy for this very
erratic transportation system struck
me.
In the first place as a means of
locomotion these splendid one-man
street car animals are a flat failure.
The one remaining use of the Palo
Alto street car system ends 011 July
first, when the street car line poles
will be needed no longer as a sole
means of support for nightly wander

There was a time when we had a
semi-efficient street car system, but
that was long ago. The motormen
