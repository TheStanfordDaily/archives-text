# UNIVERSITY INCREASES DOMESTIC WATER SUPPLY
## 
### Chever Kellogg, '19 
THE University has increased its
domestic water supply about twen
ty-five per cent lately, by installing
a new well and pump at the old
Mausoleum pumping station. There
has been some fear on the part ot" the
University authorities that an undue
scarcity of water might arise in the
near future. This fear is no doubt
due to the late dry years which have
caused a considerable scarcity of
water in the neighboring communi
ties. Further development of the
campus irrigation supply is contem
plated; it is considered that the
present domestic supply is now ample
for all ordinary demands.
In the early years of the University
the campus population was much
less than it is now. A well near
the Mausoleum, together with the
Mayfleld pumping station, on the
county road immediately west of
Mayfleld, furnished a sufficient quan
tity of water for the demand at that
time. Then, as now, the pressure
head was obtained by pumping the
water to the reservoir on San Juan
hill. The water mains thence led to
the various parts of the campus.
An effort was made at the start to
differentiate between domestic and
irrigating supply so the mains were
paralleled throughout the campus.
The irrigating water was 'obtained
from the Searsville and Pelt Lake
water sheds.
For various reasons it was decided
that the old well must be deepened.
The population of the community had
increased; the demand for domestic
water per capita had increased also.
The likelihood of the one or the other
station breaking down coincident
with a heavy load had to be insured
against. It was decided to make the
capacity of either station equal to
the ordinary demand of the whole
campus.
Upon starting to deepen the old
well it was found that the inner
casing at a depth of approximately
100 feet had become worthless. Hence
the pump house was transferred from
the west side of the new wall to the
east side and another 430-foot well
was drilled. A motor with a power
output double that of the previous
motor was installed and connected
to the crank shaft, with spur gear
ing of such velocity ratio that the
pump strokes per minute were as
rated, to wit: thirty. The cranks are
in quarter-phase with each other, i.e.,
the angle between the cranks with
the shaft center line as the vertex
is ninety degrees. This is so design
ed because the pumps are double act
ing; thus valvular discharge begins
at angular intervals of nintey degrees
for shaft rotation and a close ap
proach to steady flow is accomp
; lished.
Since induction motors are used
they must be started under compara
tively light load, the characteristic
starting torque of such machines be
ing small. Valves are therefore ar
ranged to permit discharge either
into atmosperic pressure or the pres
sure of the main to the reservoir.
Starting, the lift is merely the sixty
feet from water surface to pump
elevation. Later the lift to the re
servoir may be added to the load.
When both plants are operating the
discharge into the reservoir is thirty
j thousand gallons per hour. For con

tinuous operation this amounts to
720,000 gallons per day. Assuring
a population of two thousand, which
is appproximately correct, we have
an allowance of 310 gallons per capita
per diem. This is more than twice
the required amount. Hence either
station will now supply the needs of
the campus.
With regard to a further increase
in the supply of irrigating water, it
has been decided that another dam
be erected some two miles below the
present Searsville dam to catch the
run off which the present Searsville
is unable to hold. The catchment
area draining into Searsville lake and
San Francisquito Creek, produces a
run off greatly exceeding the capacity
of the present lake. The deposit of
silt in the bed of the lake has de
creased the original capacity almost
one-half, so only about one-half the
water orginally available for irriga
tion is now available. However, the
erection of this new dam will multi
ply the present available supply by
about seven. The lead under the new
reservoir will be sufficient to supply
all locations now receiving water
from Searsville. It is intended to use
this additional water to irrigate the
"Farm" and to add to its general
(â€¢harm and beauty. Lagunita will be
full the year around. Many of the
fields will be green throughout the
summer and fall as well as the spring.
One hesitates to limit what may be
done; the imagination is unable to
do so.
