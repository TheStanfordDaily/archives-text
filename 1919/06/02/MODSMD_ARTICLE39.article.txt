# ALUMNI REUNION TO FEATURE
## 
### R. A. Martinsen 
This year will undoubtedly see the
biggest and best attended commence
ment week that Stanford has ever
known. It might well be termed
Stanford's "Old Home Week," because,
for the first time since their country
called them away, many of Stanford's
alumni and students will come to pay
their homage to their old haunts. It will
be a glorious reunion, with old friends
and college chums meeting for the first
time in years, with comrades-in-arms
exchanging war-time reminiscences, and
with all the loyal pilgrims to their Alma
Mater joining together in a common
effort to bring back the old care-free
college days.
Thursday, June 12, officially opens the
week. All through the day the return
ing students and alumni will continue to
Hood the campus. On that night the cel
ebrated Senior Farce will be produced.
The trials and hardships over which this
farce has triumphed are so unusual that
ii deserves the highest tribute.
The actual opening of Commencement
Week, however, will be at 6 o'clock
Thursday, when all the clubs and fra
ternities throw open their doors to the
returning alumni through the medium
of dinners and entertainment until time
for the fcarce. Dinners are an excel
lent way to foster the get-together spirit,
and by the hour of the play. Reunion
Week should be in full swing.
At 4 o'clock on Friday afternoon
comes President Wilbur's reception, at
which all of the Alumni will be present,
as well as the members of the faculty
and the graduating class. At 8 o'clock
the Promenade Concert in the Quad
rangle closes the events of the day.
Many couples will meet and saunter
round the Quad together, just as they
used to do in the school days gone by.
Saturday, June 14. is the day of the
English Club Pageant, the greatest pro
duction ever attempted at Stanford, in
volving more than 4(10 players, including
all the best talent on the campus. Dr.
Jordan himself will take a part, assisted
by the famous "old guard." Many of
the faculty and several well-known
alumni will assume roles in this great
Stanford spectacle.
At 9:15 in the morning, the Senior-
Alumni ball game takes place on the
campus. The Seniors are determined to
win this game and have secured Couch
for a pitcher. Couch, a professional, is
one of the best Pacific Coast moundmen

and will surely give the Alumni some
thing to worry about. "Ken" Lilly and
"Mush" Stevens are picking the team
which will represent the Seniors. It
looks very serious for the Alumni. At
11:30 the Alumni Association holds its
annual meeting in Room 12â€”provided
the "Oldsters have recovered sufficient
ly from the shock of the ball game. At
1:30 the Alumni and Seniors partake of
their joint luncheon.
At 2 p.m. comes a purely Alumni
event, when the classes of '93 and '94
dedicate their class-plates on the Quad.
As many of the members of these classes
as can be gathered together will be as
sembled for this event, to take part in
these delayed ceremonies which play
such an important role in the history of
any Stanford class.
At 4 p.m. all the Alumni will gather
at the annual open meeting of the Phi
Beta Kappa Society in the Little The
atre. and from there all will go to the
society's reception, dinner, and initiation
at the Women's Club House. The
Alumni, however, will hold their own
class reunions and dinners at 6 p. m..
t<> revive their old friendship.- and
school spirit.
I he next event of importance comes
that night in the form of the pageant.
I his will be over by 10:30. in time for
the Senior-Alumni dance at President
Wilbur's house,
Sunday, June 15, is a day of great
importance, for from 4:30 to 6 the fac
ulty and departmentmental at-homes
take place.
On Monday, June 16. comes the an
nual commencement in the Memorial
Church. Dr. Paul Shorey will deliver
the address. That night the big closing
event of the week will occur, when the
Seniors give their ball, at the Hotel
Vendome, San Jose. Besides a six
course dinner, the Seniors have ar
ranged for an exceptional eight-piece
orchestra, a genuine, professional toe
dancer, and all manner of "stunts" such
as have never been thought of before.
The unusual importance of Alumni
events and activities merits the attend
ance of returning "grads" which will
undoubtedly take place. Without uni
versal effort and help on their part the
object of Stanford's "Old Home Week"
will be lost, but, thanks to their com
mon endeavors and whole-heartedness,
the coming Alumni Week will be the
greatest in the historv of the University.
