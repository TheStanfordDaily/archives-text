## Dean C.E. Barrows Delivers Address to Large Body Of Students 
### 
Lieutenant-Colonel David V. Bar
rows, Dean of Arts and Sciences at
the University of California, express
ed the spirit of the Memorial Service
held last Friday morning in the Me
morial Church, in a simple and im
pressive speech on what the world
had learned from the sacrifice of the
men who had given their lives in the
Great War. "Obedience, hope, and
faith are the lessons which we have
learned from our brothers who have
not returned," said Dean Barrows.
In speaking of obedience, Dean
Barrows told of an intensely dramatic
incident which took place in the army
of the Bohemians and Czecho-Slavs.
who have held the Siberian Railroad
for the Allies and have made every
attempt to re-establish the Eastern
front. The numbers were against
them, however, but when they were
told to continue to hold that line
after the signing of the armistice, the
remnant of the army was willing to
make the sacrifice because it came
as a command.
Dean Barrows pointed out the more
idealistic side of the war and told
how all of the men who went into
the camps and trenches were cru
saders. In speaking on this phase
of army life, Dean Barrows said,
"Only men of faith can be crusaders.
Lord Morely, the greatest agnostic
of the age said, 'Don't crusade, cru
sades never pay!' and then pointed to
the failure of the European crusaders,
but America has crusaded and her
soldiers have shown the faitlk"
"Our men must have had hope,"
Dean Barrows continued, ''because
action is based upon hope and it is
hope which gives men faith." In
this connection Dean Harrows em
phasized the growing skepticism of
today.
Special music was arranged for the
assembly which was unusually beauti
ful. The trio of the violin, harp and
organ rendered a very beautiful se
lection. Mrs. Warren D. Allen was
the soloist of the occasion. Hej- con
tralto voice is well-known in this
community for the rare quality and

tone of her notes.
Dr. Charles D. Gardner gave the
closing prayer which was followed
by the sounding of taps, perhaps

the most impressive part of the whole
service. The program was closed
with the singing of "Hail, Stanford,
Hail."
