Mrs. Styles—l've been down to see
the doctor.
Mr. Styles—And did lie ask to see
your tongue?
"No, he didn't."
"Well, he asked if you had cold feet."
"No, he didn't."
"Well, then, he asked if you had
pains in your back and headaches?"
"No, he didn't."
"Well, what in thunder, then, did he
ask you?"
"He wanted to know what your in
come was!"—Yonkers Statesman.
