Gordon Davis, '18, who "is coaching
the show has been connected with al
most every branch of the theatrical
game. He is an actor of considerable
merit, having taken the lead in Gals
worthy's "Justice," two years ago.
Two plays that he has written have
been successfully produced on the
professional stage, and the excellence
of the recent Junior Opera may be
attributed to his faithful coaching.
The part of "Bishop Doran" play
ed by Ben Harris, '19, is rich in its
comedy value. Taken at his own
word, the "Bishop" is a mere child
in business but in reality he is a
business man of considerable astute
ness. The honest "Bishop" even
descends to the point of blackmail
for his pet charity in the midst of
the complications following the lead
ing man's attempt to tell "Nothing
But the Truth."
