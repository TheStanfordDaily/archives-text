Hampered by the loss of Caughey and
Templeton, who left the campus last
Thursday for New York where they
will embark for the inter-allied meet at
Paris, the Stanford track squad which
entered in the Pacific Coast Confer
ence meet at Seattle was forced to take
second place behind the University of
California.
All but two of the squad who were
sent north from Palo Alto scored points.
As usual, Wells was the big winner for
the Cardinal., With a first in the low
hurdles and the 100, and second man on
the winning relay team, he scored a
total of l\li points. Merchant of Cali
fornia was the biggest point winner of
fhe meet with 15 points to his credit in
the javelin, hammer, and broad jump.
As was expected, the Stanford team
walked away from the rest of the field
in the relay. Scofied, Wells, Dinkel
spiel and Maynard showed heels to
their nearest competitor, the California
team, and won by several yards. 3:45
was the time it: took the four men to
cover the two-mile course.
Stanford showed up strongest in the
dashes. Wells took first in the 100,
Dinkelspiel won the 220, and Maynard
was several yards ahead of his nearest
competitor, Scoficld, in the 440. When
Dinkelspiel breasted the tape in the
220. one of the biggest surprises of the
day was sprung. This is the first time
during the season that Dinkelspiel has
placed in fast competition in the sprints.
The 440 was one of the prettiest races
of the day. Maynard showed some of
his early season form and circled the
oval in the fast time of .51. Tf he had
been forced to it. Maynard could have
breasted the tape slightly sooner. Sco
ficld also ran a &ood race but was not
able to show the necessary stuff that
was needed to pass his team-mate.
Wells took first in the low hurdles,
as was expected, but was disqualified
in the high sticks when he knocked


"Jess" Wells, the largest point-win
ner for the Cardinal in P.C.C. Meet
