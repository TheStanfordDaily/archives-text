Hampered by the loss of Caughey and
Templeton, who left the campus last
Thursday for New York where they
will embark for the inter-allied meet at
Paris, the Stanford track squad which
entered in the Pacific Coast Confer
ence meet at Seattle was forced to take
second place behind the University of
California.
All but two of the squad who were
sent north from Palo Alto scored points.
As usual, Wells was the big winner for
the Cardinal., With a first in the low
hurdles and the 100, and second man on
the winning relay team, he scored a
total of l\li points. Merchant of Cali
fornia was the biggest point winner of
fhe meet with 15 points to his credit in
the javelin, hammer, and broad jump.
As was expected, the Stanford team
walked away from the rest of the field
in the relay. Scofied, Wells, Dinkel
spiel and Maynard showed heels to
their nearest competitor, the California
team, and won by several yards. 3:45
was the time it: took the four men to
cover the two-mile course.
Stanford showed up strongest in the
dashes. Wells took first in the 100,
Dinkelspiel won the 220, and Maynard
was several yards ahead of his nearest
competitor, Scoficld, in the 440. When
Dinkelspiel breasted the tape in the
220. one of the biggest surprises of the
day was sprung. This is the first time
during the season that Dinkelspiel has
placed in fast competition in the sprints.
The 440 was one of the prettiest races
of the day. Maynard showed some of
his early season form and circled the
oval in the fast time of .51. Tf he had
been forced to it. Maynard could have
breasted the tape slightly sooner. Sco
ficld also ran a &ood race but was not
able to show the necessary stuff that
was needed to pass his team-mate.
Wells took first in the low hurdles,
as was expected, but was disqualified
in the high sticks when he knocked


"Jess" Wells, the largest point-win
ner for the Cardinal in P.C.C. Meet
over more than his allotment of hurdles.
Green, who was expected to take first I
in the pole vault without an effort,
dropped out at 11 feet 3 inches and:
failed* to place. He came back in the
high jump and discus, however, and
took secend in both of these events.
When it came to the weights, the
Cardinal squad felt the loss of Caughey.
Only one place was scored in the weight;
events, and this was by Curtice when
he took second in the shot put. I lad i
Caughey been able to compete, at least
ten points would have come into the
Stanford column.
Teitsworth was the only Cardinal j
wearer to score in the distance runs. In
one of the fastest races of the season,
which was won by Waltz of California,
Teitsworth took fourth place in the 880.
The attendance at the meet was the
largest that lias been seen at any track
and field meet this season. The Seattle
oval was almost overowing with a
crown that ran up to well over 5000.
More enthusiasm was shown than was
expected, and there were many Stanford
alumni living around that part of the
country who turned out to support the
team.
The team made a better showing than
was expected and would have undoubt
edly won first place if Caughey and
Templeton had been there to add their
bit.
California won first place with a
score of points. Stanford came
second with a score of 38. Washing
ton State College led the fight of th<
northern teams against the southern in
vaders and carried off third honors with
30K' points. Oregon Agricultural Col

Hampered by the loss of Caughey and
Templeton, who left the campus last
Thursday for New York where they
will embark for the inter-allied meet at
Paris, the Stanford track squad which
entered in the Pacific Coast Confer
ence meet at Seattle was forced to take
second place behind the University of
California.
All but two of the squad who were
sent north from Palo Alto scored points.
As usual, Wells was the big winner for
the Cardinal., With a first in the low
hurdles and the 100, and second man on
the winning relay team, he scored a
total of l\li points. Merchant of Cali
fornia was the biggest point winner of
fhe meet with 15 points to his credit in
the javelin, hammer, and broad jump.
As was expected, the Stanford team
walked away from the rest of the field
in the relay. Scofied, Wells, Dinkel
spiel and Maynard showed heels to
their nearest competitor, the California
team, and won by several yards. 3:45
was the time it: took the four men to
cover the two-mile course.
Stanford showed up strongest in the
dashes. Wells took first in the 100,
Dinkelspiel won the 220, and Maynard
was several yards ahead of his nearest
competitor, Scoficld, in the 440. When
Dinkelspiel breasted the tape in the
220. one of the biggest surprises of the
day was sprung. This is the first time
during the season that Dinkelspiel has
placed in fast competition in the sprints.
The 440 was one of the prettiest races
of the day. Maynard showed some of
his early season form and circled the
oval in the fast time of .51. Tf he had
been forced to it. Maynard could have
breasted the tape slightly sooner. Sco
ficld also ran a &ood race but was not
able to show the necessary stuff that
was needed to pass his team-mate.
Wells took first in the low hurdles,
as was expected, but was disqualified
in the high sticks when he knocked


"Jess" Wells, the largest point-win
ner for the Cardinal in P.C.C. Meet
over more than his allotment of hurdles.
Green, who was expected to take first I
in the pole vault without an effort,
dropped out at 11 feet 3 inches and:
failed* to place. He came back in the
high jump and discus, however, and
took secend in both of these events.
When it came to the weights, the
Cardinal squad felt the loss of Caughey.
Only one place was scored in the weight;
events, and this was by Curtice when
he took second in the shot put. I lad i
Caughey been able to compete, at least
ten points would have come into the
Stanford column.
Teitsworth was the only Cardinal j
wearer to score in the distance runs. In
one of the fastest races of the season,
which was won by Waltz of California,
Teitsworth took fourth place in the 880.
The attendance at the meet was the
largest that lias been seen at any track
and field meet this season. The Seattle
oval was almost overowing with a
crown that ran up to well over 5000.
More enthusiasm was shown than was
expected, and there were many Stanford
alumni living around that part of the
country who turned out to support the
team.
The team made a better showing than
was expected and would have undoubt
edly won first place if Caughey and
Templeton had been there to add their
bit.
California won first place with a
score of points. Stanford came
second with a score of 38. Washing
ton State College led the fight of th<
northern teams against the southern in
vaders and carried off third honors with
30K' points. Oregon Agricultural Col

day was sprung. This is the first time
during the season that Dinkelspiel has
placed in fast competition in the sprints.
The 440 was one of the prettiest races
of the day. Maynard showed some of
his early season form and circled the
oval in the fast time of .51. Tf he had
been forced to it. Maynard could have
breasted the tape slightly sooner. Sco
ficld also ran a &ood race but was not
able to show the necessary stuff that
was needed to pass his team-mate.
Wells took first in the low hurdles,
as was expected, but was disqualified
in the high sticks when he knocked


"Jess" Wells, the largest point-win
ner for the Cardinal in P.C.C. Meet
over more than his allotment of hurdles.
Green, who was expected to take first I
in the pole vault without an effort,
dropped out at 11 feet 3 inches and:
failed* to place. He came back in the
high jump and discus, however, and
took secend in both of these events.
When it came to the weights, the
Cardinal squad felt the loss of Caughey.
Only one place was scored in the weight;
events, and this was by Curtice when
he took second in the shot put. I lad i
Caughey been able to compete, at least
ten points would have come into the
Stanford column.
Teitsworth was the only Cardinal j
wearer to score in the distance runs. In
one of the fastest races of the season,
which was won by Waltz of California,
Teitsworth took fourth place in the 880.
The attendance at the meet was the
largest that lias been seen at any track
and field meet this season. The Seattle
oval was almost overowing with a
crown that ran up to well over 5000.
More enthusiasm was shown than was
expected, and there were many Stanford
alumni living around that part of the
country who turned out to support the
team.
The team made a better showing than
was expected and would have undoubt
edly won first place if Caughey and
Templeton had been there to add their
bit.
California won first place with a
score of points. Stanford came
second with a score of 38. Washing

Hampered by the loss of Caughey and
Templeton, who left the campus last
Thursday for New York where they
will embark for the inter-allied meet at
Paris, the Stanford track squad which
entered in the Pacific Coast Confer
ence meet at Seattle was forced to take
second place behind the University of
California.
All but two of the squad who were
sent north from Palo Alto scored points.
As usual, Wells was the big winner for
the Cardinal., With a first in the low
hurdles and the 100, and second man on
the winning relay team, he scored a
total of l\li points. Merchant of Cali
fornia was the biggest point winner of
fhe meet with 15 points to his credit in
the javelin, hammer, and broad jump.
As was expected, the Stanford team
walked away from the rest of the field
in the relay. Scofied, Wells, Dinkel
spiel and Maynard showed heels to
their nearest competitor, the California
team, and won by several yards. 3:45
was the time it: took the four men to
cover the two-mile course.
Stanford showed up strongest in the
dashes. Wells took first in the 100,
Dinkelspiel won the 220, and Maynard
was several yards ahead of his nearest
competitor, Scoficld, in the 440. When
Dinkelspiel breasted the tape in the
220. one of the biggest surprises of the
day was sprung. This is the first time
during the season that Dinkelspiel has
placed in fast competition in the sprints.
The 440 was one of the prettiest races
of the day. Maynard showed some of
his early season form and circled the
oval in the fast time of .51. Tf he had
been forced to it. Maynard could have
breasted the tape slightly sooner. Sco
ficld also ran a &ood race but was not
able to show the necessary stuff that
was needed to pass his team-mate.
Wells took first in the low hurdles,
as was expected, but was disqualified
in the high sticks when he knocked


"Jess" Wells, the largest point-win
ner for the Cardinal in P.C.C. Meet
over more than his allotment of hurdles.
Green, who was expected to take first I
in the pole vault without an effort,
dropped out at 11 feet 3 inches and:
failed* to place. He came back in the
high jump and discus, however, and
took secend in both of these events.
When it came to the weights, the
Cardinal squad felt the loss of Caughey.
Only one place was scored in the weight;
events, and this was by Curtice when
he took second in the shot put. I lad i
Caughey been able to compete, at least
ten points would have come into the
Stanford column.
Teitsworth was the only Cardinal j
wearer to score in the distance runs. In
one of the fastest races of the season,
which was won by Waltz of California,
Teitsworth took fourth place in the 880.
The attendance at the meet was the
largest that lias been seen at any track
and field meet this season. The Seattle
oval was almost overowing with a
crown that ran up to well over 5000.
More enthusiasm was shown than was
expected, and there were many Stanford
alumni living around that part of the
country who turned out to support the
team.
The team made a better showing than
was expected and would have undoubt
edly won first place if Caughey and
Templeton had been there to add their
bit.
California won first place with a
score of points. Stanford came
second with a score of 38. Washing
ton State College led the fight of th<
northern teams against the southern in
vaders and carried off third honors with
30K' points. Oregon Agricultural Col
lege was fourth with 24K> points, the
University of Washington fifth with
19 J/2 points, and the University of
Oregon last with 9.
