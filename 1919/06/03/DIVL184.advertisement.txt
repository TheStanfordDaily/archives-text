Why Do You
Go To College?
For an education—of course.
There's a world of knowledge in
the advertisements. Facts of the
great world of business—heralds
of the world's improvements.
Monuments of engineering achieve
ment —builders of factories —
makers of machines.
Knowledge of comforts unkown
when father was a boy. The
newest automobile, the cleverest safety
razor and the handiest fountain pen.
Knowledge of the world today. Knowledge
of the great right now. Knowledge
that you cannot afford to miss.
