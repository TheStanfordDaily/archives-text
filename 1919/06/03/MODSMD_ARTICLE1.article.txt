# PACIFIC COAST CONFERENCE MEETING PROVIDES CHANGES
## New Coaching Policy Introduced 
### 
ltfl FETING in special session Friday
afternoon and evening in Seattle,
delegates from all six of the Pacific
Coast Conference colleges drew up sev
eral resolutions of future importance
and provided for a number of imme
diate changes in the athletic policies of
the present members of the Conference.
Stanford, represented by Dr. Angell,
with Student Manager W. I. Ames sit
ting witli him as ex-officio member,
presented what is destined to be known
as the Stanford coaching resolution. It
embodies a radical change in the sys
tem of employing coaches for the
various athletics undertaken by the Con
ference institution.
Yearly Coaches Instead of Seasonal
Instead of employing coaches by the
season so as to specialize in athletics
of that particular time of year, it is
planned to provide for yearly hiring
of coaches. This is embodied in the
Stanford resolution which likewise urges
that each coach be instructor in at least
two sports, which is another step in the
development of less specialized and pro
fessionalized coaching systems. The

resolution as presented by Stanford has
met with considerable favor and con
ference delegates point out that it will
probably be accepted at the next regu
lar meeting in December of 1919.
Limit of Three Events
To govern conference meets and dual
meets between conference colleges, a
limit of three track events, itvMudin'?
relay, has been set. No limit has been
placed upon the number of field events
in which the individual may compete.
The conference explains its action in an
attempt to develop well-balanced teams
rather than place emphasis upon stars.
It was further provided that there were
to be no heats in dual meets, thus pre
venting overcrowding of the track with
competitors. The conference further
more placed a ban upon interscholastic
meets being held at any conference
college through invitation of the uni
versities. High schools are to be per
mitted to use the tracks of universities
upon their own request, but conferenco
colleges are forbidden from inviting
them to compete.
Minor Sports Are Added
What is regarded as a signal victory
for minor sports was obtained when
boxing, tennis, wrestling and swimming
were added to the list of conference
sports. It was further insisted that all
teams competing with conference col
leges must either abide by the rulings
of the Pacific Coast Conference or the
Conference of Southern California Col
leges.
Financial arrangements for future
meets were made on the basis that the
host college is to guarantee $1000
to the six colleges competing to be
pro-rated among the colleges competing
according to the expense of reaching the
place of competition. The next $500
obtained from the meet is to go to the
host ocllege and any additional amount
to lie again pro-rated. A special com
mittee on rules for conference meets
was appointed. The meeting adjourned
at midnight Friday after eight hours of
deliberation.

met with considerable favor and con
ference delegates point out that it will
probably be accepted at the next regu
lar meeting in December of 1919.
Limit of Three Events
To govern conference meets and dual
meets between conference colleges, a
limit of three track events, itvMudin'?
relay, has been set. No limit has been
placed upon the number of field events
in which the individual may compete.
The conference explains its action in an
attempt to develop well-balanced teams
rather than place emphasis upon stars.
It was further provided that there were
to be no heats in dual meets, thus pre
venting overcrowding of the track with
competitors. The conference further
more placed a ban upon interscholastic
meets being held at any conference
college through invitation of the uni
versities. High schools are to be per
mitted to use the tracks of universities
upon their own request, but conferenco
colleges are forbidden from inviting
them to compete.
Minor Sports Are Added
What is regarded as a signal victory
for minor sports was obtained when
boxing, tennis, wrestling and swimming
were added to the list of conference
sports. It was further insisted that all
teams competing with conference col
leges must either abide by the rulings
of the Pacific Coast Conference or the
Conference of Southern California Col
leges.
Financial arrangements for future
meets were made on the basis that the
host college is to guarantee $1000
to the six colleges competing to be
pro-rated among the colleges competing
according to the expense of reaching the
place of competition. The next $500
obtained from the meet is to go to the
host ocllege and any additional amount
to lie again pro-rated. A special com
mittee on rules for conference meets
was appointed. The meeting adjourned
at midnight Friday after eight hours of
deliberation.
