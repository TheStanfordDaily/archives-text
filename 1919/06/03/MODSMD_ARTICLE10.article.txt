# TUSSING WINS TENNIS FINALS
## 
### 
In one of the closest matches of the
season. Tussing, '22, defeated G. C.
Thomas. '19, in the finals of the Hast
ings Cup Tournament yesterday after
noon on the Encina Courts. This match
officially closes tennis for the year.
fn the semi-finals Thomas defeated
Turner in a hard-fought match. Tur
ner was unable to overcome his heavy
handicap, though he played a good,
steady game. Thomas used his back
hand stroke to good advantage and
Turner found it hard to handle his cuts.
Tussing's game in the finals showed
that he will he a more valuable man
to Kinney on next year's tennis team
than it was originally thought. He
played slow, steady game and could
not be excited in yesterday's matches.
His long drives to odd corners of the

court proved too much for Thomas,
though lie was forced to play five sets
before he could gain possession of the
cup.
The first game went to Tussing by a
score of 6-2. In the second set Thomas
came back and defeated his opponent
by a score of 6-love. The next set also
love, but this time Tussing was on the
long end of the score. The fourth set
went to Thomas by the score of 6-2
and the last one was Tussing's to the
tune of 6-3.
More interest has been shown in
tennis this year than has been evi
denced for a long time. If the same
number of men turn out for the 1920
tennis team, this year's defeat at the
hands of California will be in a fair
way of being washed out.
