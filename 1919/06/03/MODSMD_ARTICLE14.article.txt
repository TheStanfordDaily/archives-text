# ON THE WRONG TRACK

'% the return °112 the track men from the Conference
% x -g« > Meet at Seattle on Saturday last, the question of
the exact status of the Conference meet in Stanford's athletic
situation presents itself. The meet was the first of its kind in
the west and as such presents a new problem.
The significance of the event in the northwest came as a surprise to the
Stanford men in the north; the large crowd that attended the meet, and the
pages of newspaper publicity devoted to it was almost entirely unexpected.
It was, however, a source of gratification to see an event of this sort played
up to its proper position. With a realization of the importance that is bound
to be attached to it, comes a realization that Stanford at times takes the
wrong track in an athletic policy.
The tendency among the teams and students of Stanford seems to be to
attach all significance to the contests with the Blue and Gold and less sig
nificance to other athletic events. In baseball, in track, in basketball and
we may ultimately expect in football, the Stanford student policy of "big
game" evinces itself. This is radically wrong and behind the times in ath
letics. There are other rivals who must share in contesting with the Cardi
nal. There are other championships than a single victory over California.
As an illustration: Stanford won the dual meet with the Blue and Gold.
California triumphed for the Pacific Coast Championship. With the excep
tion of the immediate locality, the immediate field of alumni and students,
California's 1919 track team will be regarded as the more successful of the
two of this year. We cannot help but admit this in the face of the enthusi
asm with which the Bruin victory was received in Seattle, Portland and
even the more southern cities.
Some means should be taken to impress upon the students and teams
of the institution that Stanford competes in other events than the Berkeley
contests; that while the rivalry with the Blue and Gold is still the big thing
in college athletics at Stanford, the advantages of triumphs against other
opponents should be played up and given the proper recognition and en
couragement.
