# NEW POISON INVENTED BY STANFORD ALUMNUS
## 
### 
To a Stanford alumni belongs the
honor of having invented a marvel
ous poison, known as the "Lewisite"
poison, which is described as being
the deadliest poisonous gas known.
Captain W. Lee Lewis, '02, is the
inventor, and developed this gas in
the Bureau of Mines. It was manu
factured in a specially built plant
near Cleveland, called the "mouse
trap," so called because every work
man who entered the stockade agreed
not to leave the eleven-acre space
until the war was over.
"Lewisite" is of such a deadlv

nature that a single drop poured into
the palm of the hand would penetrate
the blood, reach the heart and kill
the victim in great agony. A single
day's output would snuff out the four
million lives on Manhattan Island.
At the rate of ten tons a day, which
were being manufactured previous to
the signing of the armistice, three
thousand tons of this terrible instru
ment for killing, would have been
ready for business on the American
front in France on March Ist.
Lewis will be remembered here by
both faculty and students as being a
brilliant scholar in chemistry. He is
now a professor in the Northwestern
University, at Evanston, 111.
