# JUNE 12 WILL USHER IN BIG HOME COMING WEEK
## 
### 
On Thursday, June 12, the tide will
turn toward the "Farm" which will
bring back Stanford men and women
to their old haunts. House dinners
will preceed the Senior Farce, which
opens the Home-Coming throngs to
a truthful week.
Friday will put Home-Coming
Week into full swing when the Me
morial Service will be held, which
transfers the memorial duty from the
class of 1919 to next year's Senior
Class. At 4 p.m. the Presn.ent will
hold a reception for the graduating
class, alumni and faculty, at his home.
This annual affair affords an excel
lent opportunity for all alumni to
meet the newly made alumni.
Saturday is Alumni Day and as
such will be devoted entirely to class
re-unions and meetings, many of
which will take the form of dinners.
Alunmi and Seniors will get together
at a joint luncheon to be held in the
Memorial Court. The class of 1893
and 1894 will lay their class plates
in front of the Memorial Church, at
2 o'clock. These last dedications will

complete the line of class plates up
to the present time, the 1919 plate
being dedicated Friday morning.
The Pageant, which forms the most
distinctive note of all Home-Coming
Week, is scheduled for Saturday night
at 8 o'clock. Following this, the
Seniors and Alumni will complete the
day with a final reception. This will
be given at the President's home,
which has been thrown open to the
Alumni-Senior reception through the
kindness of President and Mrs. Ray
Lyman Wilbur.
Mingled with the joy of the home
comers will be their thought of the
sixty-five men who did not return and
of their families, many of whom will
be present at the affairs of the week.
These have been invited to attend this
memorial week as the guests of the
University, and many have signified
their intentions to come.
All plans have been made with the
end in view of making this the big
gest reunion ever staged on the
campus, and at the same time mak
ing a true memorial service.
