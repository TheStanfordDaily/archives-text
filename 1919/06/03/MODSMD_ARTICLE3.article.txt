# LAST SENIOR MEETING SET FOR TOMORROW
## 
### 
The last meeting of the Senior Class
will be held to-morrow at 12:45, in Room
214. The meeting will be a very impor
tant one, and it is essential that all grad
uate seniors, all holdovers, or any nine
teeners not graduating, be present. An
election of Alumni officers will be held,
and the program for Senior Week is to
be outlined. The senior meetings have
been poorly attended in the past, so all
members should strive to be present to
morrow and make the last meeting of the
vear a success.
