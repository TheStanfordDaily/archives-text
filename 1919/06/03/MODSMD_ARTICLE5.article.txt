# 2800 SPECTATORS AT PACIFIC COAST MEET
## 
### 
Track in the Northwest received a
new impetus by the Pacific Coast Con
ference meet at Seattle last Saturday,
in which six of the universities of the
coast competed for honors. The meet
was attended by 2,800 spectators, be
sides 1,000 children given free admis
sion.
The next Conference track meet prob
ably will be held at the University of
Oregon, in hopes of making track one
of the stronger sports in the north.
The Cardinal squad met with a num
ber of hardships which forced Stanford
to take second place, with the Blue and
Gold taking first honors. The stars
from the farm lost their horse-shoe
when the announcement came that
Caughey and Templeton would have, to
leave for the Allied meet in Paris and
would, therefore be unable to take the
trip to Seattle with the track squad.
The relay was run in record time,
since the average of each man on the
winning relay was between 51 :1 and
51:2. Wells, Dinkelspicl, Maynard,
Green, Scofield, Curtice, and Teitsworth
were the point winners for Stanford.
