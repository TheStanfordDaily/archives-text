the 1919 Senior Farce, which will lie
given in the Assembly Hall a week from
Thursday, will prove an exception.
Miss Margaret Shedd, 20, takes this
interesting part of the hitter matron,
with the wicked husband who lights
chorus girls' cigarettes in public. She
is a comedienne of the most finished
ability.
James Boyle '20, plays the part of
Mr. Ralston, the "villain in the play."
It is Boyle who fearlessly walks into
the teeth of danger, before witnesses,
and lights a cigarette. That is the cig
arette between the teeth of Miss Mary
Largent, '20, the chorus lady who is the
disturbing element in the Ralston fam
ily domestic arrangements. Later, when
the chorus lady starts to tell "Nothing
But the Truth" about that fickle old
gentleman, Mr. Ralston, the value and
convenience of falsehood is quickly
proved.
Scenic artists have been working over
time preparing the Assembly Hall stage
for the big scene in the second act. Dif
ficulties are being met with in this con
nection, because the unusual course of
action that the plot takes at this point
requires many special arrangements.
From the standpoint of artistic settings,
"Nothing But the Truth" is expected
to go far above the average campus
production.
Drawings for seats will be held this
Thursday at the Stanford Bookstore
and Cranfall's in Palo Alto. As the Se
nior Farce comes right at the close of
final examinations, an especially large
campus audience is expected to attend.
The farce will be the opening feature of
Senior Week.
