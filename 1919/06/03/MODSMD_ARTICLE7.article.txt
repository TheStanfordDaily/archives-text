# NOMINATIONS FOR OFFICES CLOSE TODAY
## Many Candidates are Entered In Election Lists at Eleventh Hour 
### 
At 2 o'clock this afternoon nomina
tions for the various class and student
body offices closed. As usual, there was
a lack of interest in making the nomi
nations until the last minute when most
of the names were handed in.
The most competition seems to be for
the offices in the 1922 class. Almost
every office in the class has two or more
men running after it.
In the upper classes many of the
offices will be chosen by a white ballot.
The nominations follow below:
I hereby nominate W. T. Martin for
Secretary of the Student Body.
F. K. Morris.
