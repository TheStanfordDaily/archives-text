# DELTA TAU MASTIFF PERISHES UNDER FORD
## 
### 
The death of "Pat," the well-known
Delta Tau bulldog, was occasioned
last evening, when the beloved mastiff
collided with an errant Ford. He was
buried behind the anatomy building
this morning, with full military hon
ors.
"Pat" has been a familiar campus
prowler for the past year, and the
news that bis uncouth habit of chal
lenging Fords on the highway has re
sulted in his untimely end, will bring
a tear to many a sympathetic eye of
those who were wont to bestow upon
him a friendly pat as they made their
daily pilgrimage to Quad.
