# POLITICS AND SLEEPERS

### 
Stanford students to talk for self-government, student
control, or efficient administration is nothing short of a
farce. Jn the light of the few nominations for positions in the
student governing body, there seems little hope for successful
interest in any form of government undertaken by the students of the University.
Not since the darkest days of Stanford's recent existence during the great war
has there been such a palpably indifferent attitude as has evinced itself through
the entire preliminaries of the elections.
There seems little opportunity of ever having efficient student government
or of ever convincing the faculty and alumni that the students of the University
possess the self-government ability that they claim while the disgraceful facts
of the present point to a denial of their words. Eletcions are farcical where
there are no opposing candidates, and such is the present condition. The student
body officers for the coming year, with the exception of two positions, are
apparently to be elected on a white ballot. Class officers in many cases present
the same situation. What confidence can the student body have in -its officers
if they sec no contested positions'? What sort of government can exist while
the attitude towards accepting nominations is in its present state? And what
kind of administration can exist when practically no men are nominated for
positions?
The voters cannot enthuse over a white ballot; they can only become dis
gusted with the situation in which many of the best men of the University feel
themselves above the "politics" of the University, or fear that they will put
themselves in wrong with some particular group through backing the wrong
candidate. It most certainly is more commendable to back the wrong candidate
that to either back no candidate or to have no candidate to back.
But what is of greater significance in the whole situation is the fact that
next year there is sure to arise the old cry of politics and some particular group
ruling the University. We have heard this in times past and we will undoubtedly
hear it in times to come. How absurd to complain of this in the light of a
white ballot! Politics cannot exist where there is a student body interest in
student body affairs; it can only exist where the student body sleeps. And the
student body "leaders" most certainly are asleep at the present time, if the
scarcity of nominations is any just criteria.
