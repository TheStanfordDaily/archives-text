# EDITION OF STANFORD SONGS TO BE PUBLISHED
## 
### 
A new edition of Stanford songs is
now being prepared for the Stanford
Bookstore. This edition is both re
vised and enlarged. It contains sev
eral songs that have never before
been officially printed, yet songs that
rank as essential in Stanford hearts.
This new edition will be placed on
sale probably by next Tuesday or
Wednesday, or sometime before com
mencement. No definite price has
been set for it, though the Bookstore
has announced that it will not exceed
eighty-five cents.

The book is to be bound in a sub
stantial binding and is to take the
place of the present edition of Stan
ford songs, which is in complete.
