# Six Piece Orchestra From San Francisco For the Senior Ball
## 
### 
San Francisco will furnish her best
six-piece orchestra for the Senior Ball
which takes place at Hotel Vendome,
San Jose, June 16th. In addition to
this excellent music, by securing tht
Hotel Vendome, the seniors are as
sured of having the best floor in tht
county.
An added feature for this big event,
the last official act of the class of 1919,
is the professional toe-dancer who will
perform. Several mysterious stunts are
scheduled also, but they are being kept
dark and will come in the form of sur
prises.
The seniors have laid plans to make
this ball the biggest success in years,
and only universal attendance will justify
their efforts. The committee reiterates
the request that everyone buy their
tickets now, instead of waiting for the
last minute, in order that measures can
be taken to provide amply for htose
who attend.
