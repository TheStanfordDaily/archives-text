## When Is a Rough Not a Rough? 
### 
This question has excited consider
able discussion of late in the best social
and roughneck circles around the cam-1
pus, and it may shed some light on this i
dark and deep secret to lay bare the I
innermost thoughts of some of our most |
famous Parlor-snakes, as well as some I
of our most notorious roughs.
Salvie Softsoap, the accomplished
Ladykiller and Reception-hound, says:
"It gives me great pleasure to be of
any assistance in answering this great
and momentous question. You may '
quote me as saying that I consider a
| rough is one who, though lacking in
, the genteel manners and polite graces
iso necessary to the social career, at
tends our functions on the outside, and
who, by his sincere interest and alto
gether gentlemanly conduct lends a cer
tain undeniably cosmopolitan atmos
phere. No function is a complete suc
cess without roughs. On the other
hand, those presumptuous climbers who
sometimes appear in our midst, unin
vited and unwelcomed, are not roughs.
Although garbed according to the well
known rules of correct dress, they do
not have the demeanor and bearing of
persons of refinement, and should be
avoided by those seeking social success
and prominence.
"No gentleman of blue blood would
consider for an instant forcing himself
into an affair unbidden, and causing one
iota of unfavorable criticism of himself
or of the lady whom he escorts. Most
assuredly these people are not roughs,
nor are. they gentlemen of breeding and
culuture."
Kid Goof, the well-known porch and
garden decorator, says: "Take it from
me, these flossy guys got a prize gall.
They come a-waltzin' up in a machine
like they owned the joint,—probably
been to the movies or to a coca-cola
party. Us roughs is proud to be roughs;
we don't want no lights nor polished
floors, —we stand on the outside and
don't do no harm, —but what makes us
holler for paregoric is to see these
Willies go inside and shuffle, —not only
shuffle, but sit in at the feed, and then
some wise guy from Athertoti fcays,
'Look at the roughs dancin'.'
"What knocks us cookoo is, how the
Sam Hill do these guys have their grand
and glorious time? The ones I seen
looked like they was interested spectators
at a knittin' contest. If they ain't got
no conscience nor sense of shame, why
don't they get a job drivin' a taxicab?
"We're tellin' youse gents now, lay
off of us, if you don't want to start
somethin'—them guys ain't roughs in
no sense of the word, and never was,
and they sure don't 100 kto me like
guests I'd invite, nor like reps from any
regular outfit hereabouts."
Editor, Daily Palo Alto:
Has Stanford suddenly become so
religious an institution that even
swimming is forbidden on Sunday?
If not, what other reason can there be
for locking the men's swimming pool
on this day, and not only locking it
but also setting a guard upon the
bank to drive away those who are
adventurous enought to climb over
two high fences?
Since summer is now with us, and
since Sunday afternoon walks are no
longer enjoyable, are we to have no
recreation whatever?
Are we to go without an invigorat
ing swim in a cool pool upon a
sweltering Sunday, simply because of
j someone's whim or petty display of
authority? Surely there is no crime
in swimming on Sunday, especially
when swimming in the lake, tennis,
and other sports are allowed. Why
then lock up the pool on the very day
when a student would wish to use it?
It is to be hoped that this appeal
will cause the "man higher up" res
ponsible for this unhappy situation
to remedy it at once in order that we
may make use of the pool (incidental
ly, almost entirely paid for by the
I Student Body) through the hot. sum
mer months, of if he will not do that,
he can at least explain why such an
absurd ruling has been made.
Indignantly yours.
