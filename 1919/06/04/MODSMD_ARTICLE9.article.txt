the founding of the University. The
spirit of service which prevailed
among the mission fathers, and the
following generations is portrayed.
The inception of the Stanford spirit,
which is so much spoken of will also
be shown.
There are yet places for a few
week will indeed by a week of dram
atic events following upon the close
of the academic year. Saturday, June
14, the English Club Pageant will be
given in the track oval as an ad
ditional feature of Senior Week and
the Alumni post-war homecoming.
Rehearsals are progressing well
now, according to word from Coach
Gordon Davis, '18, and the cast is
gradually rounding into shape. The
leads played by Miss Mona Gardner,
'20, and Buford Williams, 'Hi, are
showing really exceptional talent and
their work almost borders on the pro
fessional in its perfection. It is ex
pected that these two supported by a
really excellent cast will bring about
i
one of the most cleverly acted farces
that has ever been given on the
campus.
