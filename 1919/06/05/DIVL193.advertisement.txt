77ie Story of Your Study Lamp
EDISON' 3
FIRST
LAMP
IF you were studying by an old smoky oil lamp and suddenly a
modern, sun-like Mazda lamp were thrust into the room, the contrast
would be dazzling. That instant would unfold the result of thirty
years' development, research and manufacturing in electric lighting.
And this development commenced with
Edison's first lamp—hand-made, when
electricity was rare.
the flickering arc to the great white way.
Electric signs and floodlights made our
cities brilliant at night, searchlights
turned night into day at sea, and minia
ture lamps were produced for the
miner's headlight and automobile.
The General Electric Company was a
pioneer in foreseeing the po'ssibilities of
Edison's invention. Electric generators
were developed. Extensive experiments
led to the design and construction of
apparatus which would obtain electric
current from far-away waterfalls and
deliver it to every city home.
While the making of the electrical indus
try. with its many, many interests, was
developing, the General Electric Com
pany's laboratories continued to improve
th«incandescent lamp,and manufacturing
and distributing facilities were provided,
so that anyone today can buy a lamp
which is three times as efficient as the
lamp of a few years ago.
With power lines well distributed over
the country, the use of electric lighting
extended. Street lighting developed from
