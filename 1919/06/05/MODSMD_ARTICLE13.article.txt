# Chappie For June Breaks Out Monday In Largest Issue
## 
### 
"Chappie's" largest issue will appear
on the Quad Monday. This June issue
will mark the largest issue in point of
size that lias ever been published in the
history of Chaparral. The manage
ment has brought about this special
issue through its efficient new business
policy.
The title of the special issue will be
"Them Was the Happy Days," which
refers to the big alumni home-coming
next week, and the attendant long
hours of reminiscence that is expected
to flow with their appcarance. The
cover, drawn by "Monk" Antrim, '19,
is symbolic of the returned alumnus
and the long talc that he bears.
The issue will abound in short verse
and prose and, one of the features of
the magazine will be the work of
Editor-elect Glikbarg. Glickbarg, who
for several months past has been writ
ing his Crazylogue, has contributed
more of this same brand of nonsense.
It has been said that Glikbarg writes
as nonsensically as Goldberg draws.
"Chin Carving" is the title of a bit
of combination verse and prose by Ber
nicc Taylor, '21, in answer to the poem
in the last issue of "Chappie," which
announced a preference for the young
lady who bit her initials in the young
gentleman's chin when she said good
night. Another woman contributor is
Miss Janis Dunker, 22. who has drawn
the frontispiece of the "Varsity Girl."
One of the cleverest of the cartoons
in the issue is one by "Monk" as a
parody on Rodin's "Thinker."
Editorially Chappie waxes rabid on
the dormitory question. However, no
matter how rabid he gets, there is noth
ing to fear, according to the manage
ment, even if the weather is hot. On
account of the increased size of the
isÂ«ne, the price has been raised to
thirty-five cents.
