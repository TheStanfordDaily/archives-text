fflr demanding solution, it is equally truc that the women of
the University possess their own grievances that are too
1 often slighted in the exclusive discussion of affairs relating
/*IL) solely to the masculine sex. Not the least of these is the discouraging
— 1 problem connected with the 'women's gymnasium and women's athletics.
To term this problem discouraging is merely giving the situation the best of
possible terminology. When the facts of the case are investigated, inefficient
mismanagement o fthc entire women's athletic situation presents itself.
It is well understood that the 500 women pay a quarterly sum of five dollars
a person for the maintenance and management of the women's gymnasium.
It is likewise true that by the time this fund is summed up annually, including
the summer quarter's contribution, approximately $8000 is provided for the
gymnasium. From this very creditable amount the benefits to the women are
almost negligible. Several courses of instruction exist, the gymnasium is kept
open, the tank in condition; and here the $8000 practically ceases to further
benefit the women.
The Women's Athletic Association is then presented with the problem of
providing for the athletics of the "500". Repairs on the boat house, tennis nets,
tennis balls, indoor baseball equipment, crew coach are all items that the money
less athletic athletic association must provide payment for. The student body
fund is called upon to pay the bills appearing on the budget, and this demand
comes at a time when student body funds are not blooming in prosperity. What
makes the demand an unpleasant one for the women to present and an incon
sistent one for the student body to pay is that some of the annual $8000 must
remain. Why cannot this amount of money be made to support all the activities
connected with athletics and the gymnasium? Why should not tennis nets and
the women's boat house be equipped from this amount?
And what makes the situation more discouraging still is the confusion
attendant upon the management of the funds. There is no reason why there
should not be one general head to all these matters affecting the women in
physical exercise, the same as is provided for the men. There is no reason why
the Women's Athletic Association should exist upon one hand with limited
effectiveness financially and the women's gymnasium with unknown effectiveness
upon the other. It is the suggestion of the Daily that a board of athletic
control be established for the women as it exists for the men of Stanford. Let
the gymnasium department take charge of al linstruction, all coaching and all
organization. Let the Athletic Association find its place in the situation, in
controlling athletics if it will, but let the financial matters be concentrated in the
efficient hands of a women's board of athletic control. It is then that women's
athletics can be placed upon the firm foundation upon which they should rest
in an institution with such facilities for all sorts of athletics as Stanford.

less athletic athletic association must provide payment for. The student body
fund is called upon to pay the bills appearing on the budget, and this demand
comes at a time when student body funds are not blooming in prosperity. What
makes the demand an unpleasant one for the women to present and an incon
sistent one for the student body to pay is that some of the annual $8000 must
remain. Why cannot this amount of money be made to support all the activities
connected with athletics and the gymnasium? Why should not tennis nets and
the women's boat house be equipped from this amount?
And what makes the situation more discouraging still is the confusion
attendant upon the management of the funds. There is no reason why there
should not be one general head to all these matters affecting the women in
physical exercise, the same as is provided for the men. There is no reason why
the Women's Athletic Association should exist upon one hand with limited
effectiveness financially and the women's gymnasium with unknown effectiveness
upon the other. It is the suggestion of the Daily that a board of athletic
control be established for the women as it exists for the men of Stanford. Let
the gymnasium department take charge of al linstruction, all coaching and all
organization. Let the Athletic Association find its place in the situation, in
controlling athletics if it will, but let the financial matters be concentrated in the
efficient hands of a women's board of athletic control. It is then that women's
athletics can be placed upon the firm foundation upon which they should rest
in an institution with such facilities for all sorts of athletics as Stanford.
