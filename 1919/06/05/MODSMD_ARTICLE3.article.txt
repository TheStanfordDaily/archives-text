# EMBRICH WILL DIRECT DANCING AT PAGEANT
## 
### 
That the dancing portions of the
coming pageant will be fully up to
standard is now assured by the se
curing of Madame H. Embrich, who
has had thirty-eight years of experi
ence in producing plays, pageants and
spectacular perfomances on the Pa
cific Coast, as coach for the dancing
parts.
Madame Embrich was responsible
for the "Living Chess Game" which
formed a part of the Royal Middy
Opera, produced by Portland Musici
ans for the benefit of the battleship
Oregon.
For a period of five years she put
on a Friday night performance in the
Oregon Industrial Exposition, and she
is widely known as an able instructor.
She requests that all members who
expect to take part in the flower
dancing, must report at the rehearsal
tonight, at 7:15 in the Women's Gym
nasium.
