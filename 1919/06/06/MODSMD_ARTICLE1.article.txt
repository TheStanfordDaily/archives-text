# EXCEPTIONAL CAST IS ASSEMBLED FOR THE SENIOR FARCE
## BUFORD WILLIAMS STARS AS LEADING MAN James Boyle and Ben Harris Handle Hard Character Roles 
### 
WHAT campus theatre-goers who stay
over after final examinations to see
"Nothing but the Truth,"the 1919
Senior Farce, next Thursday, will be
amply rewarded was the concensus of
opinion of all who witnessed last night's
rehearsal. Coach Gordon Davis,, '18,
has assembled one of the most talented
casts that has ever appeared on the local
boards. This fact,- coupled with the
fact that "Nothing but the Truth" is a
genuine comedy hit, makes an unbeat
able combination.
When "Bob Bennett," the leading
part taken by Buford Williams, '16, bets
his sweetheart's money that he will tell
nothing but the truth for twenty-four
hours, complications ensue. The poor,
young lady whose money is risked in
such a highly speculative investment
is "Gwen Ralston," and the part is
taken by Miss Mona Gardner, '20. It
happens that "Bennett" has made the
bet with Mr. Ralston, Gwen's father,
and this makes things worse.
But it is Mr. Ralston, the man "who
always has to pay," played by James
Boyle, '20, that is really the unfortunate.
