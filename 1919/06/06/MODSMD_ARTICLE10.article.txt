# SENIOR-ALUMNI TO HAVE RECEPTION AT PRESIDENT'S HOUSE
## 
### 
The annual senior-alumni reception
will be held at the President's house
this year, instead of in the Women's
Club House, as originally Mrs.
Wilbur has kindly offered the use of
the presidential home for the evening.
The reception will take place at 10
o'clock Saturday night, June 14, after
the pageant. It is planned to have an
informal dance during the evening, and
everyone who stays for Senior Week
is invited to attend this as well as the
reception.
As at all Senior Week functions, the
seniors will wear caps and gowns. This
reception is always a part of the pro
gram for this time, and it affords an
opportunity for all the students to meet
the alumni and bid the seniors farewell,
and for the seniors to say their adieu
to President and Mrs. Wilbur.
The Senior-Alumni Reception Com
mittee is under the chairmanship of
Trene Bonnett, '19, who has the arrange
ments in charge. They arc planning
to have plenty of refreshments, and an
excellent jazz orchestra to add to the
attractions of the evening.
