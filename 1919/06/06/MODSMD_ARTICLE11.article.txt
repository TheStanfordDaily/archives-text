# MEMORIAL SPIRIT TO FEATURE HOMECOMING EVENTS
## REUNIONS PLAY BIG PART Many Alumni Plan to Return to Campus for Week of Festivities 
### 
ALUMNI reunions and memorial ser
** vices will carry out the two-fold
purpose of Home-Coming Week on
the "Farm," June 12-16, which coin
cides with Senior Week. This will
be the biggest reunion ever held on
the Quad and Stanford people from
all parts of the United States are
planning to return to the campus in
time for the rise of the curtain on
the Senior Farce, which formally
opens Senior Week, on Thursday
night, and to stay until the last di
ploma is given out on Monday.
As a post war celebration this gath
ering of the Stanford Clans will take
the form of a week of devotion set
aside for those men who participated
in the war, and for those who, as true
Stanford men, gave their life for the
realization of an ideal.
This thought dominates all the
events planned for the entire week.
On Friday, the memorial duty will
be transferred from the outgoing
senior class to the class of 1920.
This service, "In Memoriam," will be
held at 11:30 a.m.
A memorial service to Stanford
men and women, who have given
their lives in the service will be held
Sunday, in the Memorial Church, at
3 o'clock. The speaker for this ser
vice has not yet been announced. The
Pageant on Saturday night will be the
expression of Stanford's sense of
gratitude to all her people.

and dinners at 6 o'clock, will give

nisce."
