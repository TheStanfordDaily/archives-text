# IN TERMINATION
## 
### 
today's issue of the Daily Palo Alto, Volume 55 of the
AxgbAj Stanford news publication terminates its official career.
/SMiW''. I- The success of the daily paper of a university lies not as much in
the actual number of readers that the publication may have, not
entirely in the reception accorded its viewpoint, but in the success of the college
year that can in some way trace its source to the power of the press. If a
volume can end in a successful college year, then the paper has justified
its existence. If the paper has been a factor, small as it may be and probably is,
in the awakening of student interest in student activities and student problems,,
the publication is at least partially successful. If the paper has paved the way
to understanding between factions in the University or sought to settle differ
ence through knowledge of the true state of facts, then the Daily more than
fulfills its purpose.
It is the duty of an editor in ceasing his official career to hope that in
the success of the past year, he has had at least some small share through the
great power of publicity, as he undoubtedly is partially responsible for many
of the failures. It is the pleasure of an editor to extend the hand of congratu
lation to the successor to the office that he is vacating, in the hopes that his
success will be greater than his predecessor's.
In ending volume 55, opportunity is taken to thank the members of the
staff who have stuck through the trying hours of each day when copy was
scarce and time rushed. It was largely through the cooperation of the staff,
the managing editor, the associate editor, the news editors and reporters that
any success this volume may have is due. Thanks to them can never be too great.
In reviewing the work of the past, the Daily has sought to take and retain
its place as the news organ of the campus and the open forum for student dis
cussion. The Magazine Section has been a big step upward.
In looking to the future, we see many problems demanding solution. Student
control, discipline, coopperation, the dormitory situation, American football,
thieving, roughing are all problems that must be faced. In the meeting of these
problems student interest will be the dominating factor, and in student interest
the Daily Palo Alto takes its place with the power of the press.
