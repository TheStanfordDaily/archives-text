# "Y" TO PUT FUTURE FRESHMEN "ON BOAT"
## Sixteen Meetings Will Give First-Year Men View of All Activities 
### 
Stanford's Y. M. C. A. plana to at
tempt something new in the line of
social service work for 1919-1920. At
present the general scheme is to or
ganize the new Freshmen into small,
compact groups under the leadership
of upperclassmen, and to discuss vari
ous topics dealing with Stanford life
and traditions, before these groups.
This will give the 1923 class an excel
lent opportunity to "Get on the Boat,"
and will eliminate the Freshman's
eternal excuse thai "no one told him
what to do."
In order to embrace every import
ant subject dealing with Stanford
ideals and traditions, the "Y" has
requested that the upperclassmen
here send in suggestions for discus
sion by these groups. Among some
of the subjects which have already
been proposed are "College Friend
ships," "The College Purpose," "Stan
ford Traditions," "Student Honor,"
and similar topics, aU pertaining to
Stanford.
The "Y" plans to have sixteen
meetings of these groups to meet
during the fall and winter quarters.
The subjects of the meetings will be
placed in the Students' Handbook
under the general heading, "Stanford
Standards."
In order to make the meetings a
success, it is necessary to have the
cooperation of the faculty and upper
classmen in the matter of suggesting
topics for discussion, and so the "Y"
asks that suitable subjects be mailed
or handed to the association at. the
Union, as soon as possiuie.
