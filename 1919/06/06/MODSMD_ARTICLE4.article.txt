# PRESS CLUB MEMBERS TO PUBLISH CAMPUS MONTHLY MAGAZINE IN FALL "STUDENT'S ILLUSTRATED REVIEW"
## 
### 
REELING the need of a student's
magazine on the Campus, Press
Club at a meeting held at noon to-day
voted to establish such a magazine, to
appear next fall. The name of the new
publication will be the "Student's Illus
trated Review." The editing and man
aging will be in the hands of Press
Club, and the magazine will be con
ducted along lines suggested by the
"Stanford Illustrated Review" before it
was combined with the Alumnus.
L. W. Dinkelspiel, '20, at present ed
itor of the Daily Palo Alto, has been
selected by Press Club to edit the "Stu
dents' Illustrated Review." M. F.
Samis, '20, will manage the magazine,
assisted by J. E. Thrash, '21. The Board
of Editors will consist of members of
Press Club.
Present plans call for a monthly mag
azine, although if the demand is great
enough, copies of the new publication
will appear fortnightly. Arrangements
have been started with a view of put
ting the first copy of the new students'
forum on sale registration day of the
fall quarter.

The purpose of the new "Review" will
be to promote student thought, and to
give to student problems the greatest
publicity. Although the Board of Edi
tors will handle the greater part of the
writing, contributions will be encour
aged from other students, from alumni,
and from faculty members. The one
idea in the magazine will be to promote
the greater interests of the Student
Body.
To Have Illustrations
An illustrated section of several
pages will appear in the magazine to
supplement the reading matter. L. W.
McDiarmott, '17, will be in charge of
this very important section. W. E. An
trim, '19, will be cartoonist for the pa
per. The Board of Editors will consist
of the following members: N. H. Pe
tree, '19, athletics and general articles;
H. G. Svvendsen, '20, general Student
Body articles; M. L. Levy, '19, and A.
S. Gliekbarg, '19, will handle the hu
morous end of the magazine. E. E.
Crowe, '21, will be an assistant to Pe
tree on athletics, while G. S. Kocher, '19,
will work with Antrim and McDermott

on the art end.
Press Club in its new magazine will
always open the door to student opin
ion. If at any time the Board of Edi
tors feels that a majority of the men
and women on the Campus are op
posed to or disagree with the adminis
tration, they will give fullest publicity to
the student viewpoint. The magazine
will be free from all faculty domination,
and the only censorship to be exercised
over it will be that existing over other
student publications at the present time.
The "Review" will fill a place not
filled by any magazine on the Campus
at the present time. The Daily Palo
Alto covers the live news of the day,
and Chapparal, the humorous publica
tion, will not conflict in any way with
the Press Club forum.
The Daily Palo Alto magazine sec
tion, which has been published on Fri
days during the last quarter, will be dis
continued next quarter, according to an
announcement of the editor of the pa
per, since the "Student Illustrated Re
view" will take the place of this supple
ment to the Daily.
