YHNETEEIs big jazz dances will be
the stellar feature of the Senior
Ball of the class of 1919, to be held at
the Hotel Vendome, San Jose, next
Friday night. This affair will be the
concluding number on the program of
senior activities, and from the plans of
the committee in charge it will by no
means be the least in importance. The
music obtained points to this fact,
in as much as six pieces of Mr. Arthur
Hickman's well-known San Francisco
orchestra will play at the dance.
The instruments obtained are jazz
cornef, trombone with novelties, saxo
phone, piano, banjo, and traps. Lovers
of the modern dancing step will surely
be in a seventh heaven with this galaxy

of harmony-making instruments.
Among other big features of the ball
will be first the grand march, in which
will appear celebrities of the faculty as
well as prominent members of the
senior class. Between the ninth and
tenth dances, dinner will be served. The

kept a secret and will not be disclosed
till the night of the dance.
Originality is the keynote of the pro
