# SENIOR EDITION OF DAILY PALO ALTO OUT ON JUNE 16TH
## 
### 
The traditional Senior Edition of
the Daily Palo Alto will be published
next week and placed on sale on
Commencement Day, Monday, June
16th. This issue will be unusually
attractive, since it will consist of
eight pages of cuts and stories of
general interest. It will be absolute
ly devoid of the undecorative adver
tisement.
Each event of Senior Week will
be given special mention in the Sen
ior Edition, and many of them will
be illustrated. Pictures of prominent
members of the Senior Class and sev
eral good josh snapshots will add to
the general quality of the sheet.
The front page of the last D. P. A.
issue will be a symbolic illustration
drawn by George Kocher, '19. This
picture will characterize the spirit of
the graduating class as it departs
from four years of college life to enter
the business world.
