# STANFORD ALWAYS
## 
### 
"We bid farewell to Stanford, the
school that set us on our way, and
we are none the less Stanford men
now than yesterday and will be 6o
throughout our lives." In this con
cluding sentence the class historian
strikes the keynote of the feelings of the
Stanford graduate. He is leaving an
institution which has been largely in
strumental in the molding of his mind,
body, and character, and what he will
be in future life is determined in a
considerable measure by what he at
tained at Stanford. He realizes that
lie is leaving the college that he loves
and reveres, but he will always be a
Stanford man, no matter where his
fortunes may lead him.
This being the case, he owes an obli
gation to his Alma Mater. The pride
and prestige of his university is upheld
by the graduates. His deeds, both good
and bad, will reflect on Stanford. He
also owes an obligation to the com
munity in which he may live. In this
era of scientific advancement, society
depends more and more upon the col
lege trained men and women. To
justify his college training, the Stanford
man must serve in the capacity of a
leader m the community in which he
lives. He then owes an obligation to
himself. He has been one of the fortu
nate; he has been able to secure a good
education. He has been given the tools
with which to work, and if he fails now
he is not fulfilling the obligation he owes
himself.
America is now entering upon a re
construction period. With the stress of
war over, the great army fast demobiliz
ing, and the industries of peace again
in full swing, the opportunities of the
college men and women are manifold.
The political and industrial mind of the
people is unsettled, and is only waiting
to be shown the way. The university
graduates now out in the world will be
the leaders, and the members of the
present class are going forth at an
opportune time. There will be plenty
of places waiting for them, they will
not lack for opportunity, and will be
come a factor in the movements of the
world. â€¢
The proof is read, the forms are
locked up, and the Commencement Edi
tion will go on the press. It will be
spread about to be read and criticised.
In the same way, the work of the class
of nineteen hundred and nineteen is
finished. Its members will leave the
University to mingle with their fellow
men, but they will receive a far closer
proofreading than the paper. The world
is a sharp critic, but the graduate faces
it with confidence.
