						CLASS POEM

### A. Sam Glikbarg 
Out of a world of strife and trial,
Passed through the period of test with determination,
Out onto the threshold of the intangible elements of
Chance, Fate, and Possibilities.
Out of the struggle that taught and explained.
Onto the verge of better things,
Gazing with hope over chasms that yawn
And abysses that may mean defeat to pet schemes.
That was the recent course of the world,
In which the right triumphed.
Setting the stage for the best it may possess,
To be surfaced by experience,
Reined by the determination.
It is the analogy.
It is the four years period, actually not,
But in elements the same struggle. ,
It has again Experience the Master,
This time typified
By triangular cones of yellow light
Burning on the student's desk,
And over which the disheveled head endeavors to absorb, —
Experience.
It is the social whirl, the dance, the play,
Athletic brawn, the college politician, journalism.
Rolled into unity these were the set of varied instructors
That taught and willingly gave,
To the mind that possessed the wisdom
Of acceptance.
On the threshold —
Did we absorb enough?
Can we gaze with hope over the chasms that yawn,
Past prowlers that thrive on destruction,
And retain the determination
To possess the Pot of Gold?
Calculus and Law were the least of all to take,
Mere tools of the Master,
Experience.
Can we, taught in school,
Handle the tools of the Master
With the determination
That will spell the welding of Fate, Chance,
The intangible elements,
To be responsive to our whims?
To the receptive
A single answer is possible.
