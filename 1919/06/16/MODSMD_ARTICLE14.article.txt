# Class Will Gives Juniors Privileges of Sombreros
## 
### 
WE, the Class of 1919, being about . to
leave the seclusion of the "Farm,"
and to take our place in the firing
line of commercial life — the "no
man's land" of peace; and being of
sane and sound mind, free from un
due influence, duress, or menace from
the Business Office, Scholarship Com
mittee, Dean of Men or any other
source, subscribe to this our last will
and testament.
To the Class of 1920 we devise and
bequeath our sombreros with their
leather bands, with the hope that
they will prosper under the guarding
brims as we have. And we trust
that in the pride and joy of this new
possession they will not forget the
wearers that have gone before or
those that are to follow.
To the Class of 1921 we give the
right to wear "cords," with all at
tending blessings.
To the Class of 1922 we leave the
"Rod Hat," the symbol of justice,
sympathy and of the force that
acquaints Freshmen of Stanford Cus
toms. Class of 1922, use wisely and
not tin excess the great power this
gift entrusts to you; but remember,
too, the old maxim "spare the rod
and spoil the child." We charge you
with the solemn duty of seeing that
the incoming freshman class is not
spoiled, nor goes along in benighted
ignorance of Stanford traditions.
It is our will that this "Red Hat"
shall run as a heritage to all future
Sophomore classes.
To Coach Evans we bequeath the
football team. In doing so, we are
confident that our return to the "old
game" will be marked by Victory
and not defeat.
To President Wilbur we bequeath
for his own personal and private use,
now and for all time, all Rugby
equipment and appurtenances.
To "Jess" Wells we give the Track
Squad, and we are confident that un
der the leadership of this fleet-footed
skipper we shall take an eighth con
secutive victory from our rivals
across the Bay.
To "Jim" Galloway we leave the
Baseball Team, knowing that he will
do unto Berkeley next year, as he
did this year.
To the care of "Cash" Davis we
entrust the Crew, and we are sure

that under his sturdy guidance the
red-tipped oars will flash before those
of blue.
To "Bob" Pelouze we bequeath the
Basket-Bali Squad, with our prayer
for a victory over the Blue and Gold.
To Roy King we leave the Student
Body. Under his care we are sure
that it will be restored to its old
time eminence; and that it will be
an effective instrument in regaining
for the students self-government;
and become a real factor in student
life.
The Daily Palo Alto we surrender
to Neil Petree. We know that his
editorial pen will not rest until the
students again display the interest
they used to have in their own gov
ernment.
To Sam Glikbarg, with his wierd
whims and grotesque fantasies, we
leave "Chappie." We know that
under his watchful eye the hammer
will fall with a sharp and stinging
blow wherever it is needed; and we
further know that "Chappie" will
provoke smiles and chuckles in spite
of the quarter system, with its end
less appointments with the Business
Office.
To all you undergraduates of Stan
ford wo entrust the good name, and
the Stanford Spirit. This is the most
previous of all our gifts.
The good name of Stanford is liv
ing and vital. It is but the reflection
of the character of the men and wo
men of Stanford, of those of yester
day and those of today. For four
years we have guarded this precious
heritage and have seen that in all
her relations Stanford bore herself
with dignity and honor. Now we
leave this precious gift to you. We
charge you undergraduates to con
duct yourselves within and witliouL
the University as to merit this trust
we have imposed in ycu; and so
when it comes your time to hand
down thlj lr>Racy. you may do so
knowing that it is the better for
having been entrusted to your care.
To you undergraduates, we entrust
the Stanford Spirit—the spirit of loy
alty, of fairness and service. A single
glance at our service flag with its
3037 white stars and 69 of gold tells
in a language more expressive than
words, the true meaning of the Stan

ford Spirit. Guard it with the same
reverence we have.
Now having disposed of all our
possessions we must say good-bye.
But before we go. we wish to voice
our appreciation and deep respect for
the Founders, Trustees and Faculties
of Stanford. They made possible the
life we have lived, and from which
we are about to depart. This ap
preciation and respect we shall not
leave behind, but shall take it with
us, as an aid and guide in the new
life we are about to begin.
In testimony whereof we have set
our signatures this 13th day of June,
1919.

they will prosper under the guarding
brims as we have. And we trust
that in the pride and joy of this new
possession they will not forget the
wearers that have gone before or
those that are to follow.
To the Class of 1921 we give the
right to wear "cords," with all at
tending blessings.
To the Class of 1922 we leave the
"Rod Hat," the symbol of justice,
sympathy and of the force that
acquaints Freshmen of Stanford Cus
toms. Class of 1922, use wisely and
not tin excess the great power this
gift entrusts to you; but remember,
too, the old maxim "spare the rod
and spoil the child." We charge you
with the solemn duty of seeing that
the incoming freshman class is not
spoiled, nor goes along in benighted
ignorance of Stanford traditions.
It is our will that this "Red Hat"
shall run as a heritage to all future
Sophomore classes.
To Coach Evans we bequeath the
football team. In doing so, we are
confident that our return to the "old
game" will be marked by Victory
and not defeat.
To President Wilbur we bequeath
for his own personal and private use,
now and for all time, all Rugby
equipment and appurtenances.
To "Jess" Wells we give the Track
Squad, and we are confident that un
der the leadership of this fleet-footed
skipper we shall take an eighth con
secutive victory from our rivals
across the Bay.
To "Jim" Galloway we leave the
Baseball Team, knowing that he will
do unto Berkeley next year, as he
did this year.
To the care of "Cash" Davis we
entrust the Crew, and we are sure

that under his sturdy guidance the
red-tipped oars will flash before those
of blue.
To "Bob" Pelouze we bequeath the
Basket-Bali Squad, with our prayer
for a victory over the Blue and Gold.
To Roy King we leave the Student
Body. Under his care we are sure
that it will be restored to its old
time eminence; and that it will be
an effective instrument in regaining
for the students self-government;
and become a real factor in student
life.
The Daily Palo Alto we surrender
to Neil Petree. We know that his
editorial pen will not rest until the
students again display the interest
they used to have in their own gov
ernment.
To Sam Glikbarg, with his wierd
whims and grotesque fantasies, we
leave "Chappie." We know that
under his watchful eye the hammer
will fall with a sharp and stinging
blow wherever it is needed; and we
further know that "Chappie" will
provoke smiles and chuckles in spite
of the quarter system, with its end
less appointments with the Business
Office.
To all you undergraduates of Stan
ford wo entrust the good name, and
the Stanford Spirit. This is the most
previous of all our gifts.
The good name of Stanford is liv
ing and vital. It is but the reflection
of the character of the men and wo
men of Stanford, of those of yester
day and those of today. For four
years we have guarded this precious
heritage and have seen that in all
her relations Stanford bore herself
with dignity and honor. Now we
leave this precious gift to you. We
charge you undergraduates to con
duct yourselves within and witliouL
the University as to merit this trust
we have imposed in ycu; and so
when it comes your time to hand
down thlj lr>Racy. you may do so
knowing that it is the better for
having been entrusted to your care.
To you undergraduates, we entrust
the Stanford Spirit—the spirit of loy
alty, of fairness and service. A single
glance at our service flag with its
3037 white stars and 69 of gold tells
in a language more expressive than
words, the true meaning of the Stan

ford Spirit. Guard it with the same
reverence we have.
Now having disposed of all our
possessions we must say good-bye.
But before we go. we wish to voice
our appreciation and deep respect for
the Founders, Trustees and Faculties
of Stanford. They made possible the
life we have lived, and from which
we are about to depart. This ap
preciation and respect we shall not
leave behind, but shall take it with
us, as an aid and guide in the new
life we are about to begin.
