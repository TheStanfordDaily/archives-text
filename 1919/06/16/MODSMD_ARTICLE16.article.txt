# Stanford Athletics Return to Former Status in Year
## THE 						ATHLETIC SEASON 
### Earle Crowe, '21 
OTARTING out the season of 1918-
& 19 by playing American football dur
ing the period of the S. A. T. C.; the
employment of "Fighting Bob" Evans
in the spring as athletic coach; the
winning of the baseball series from
the University of California for the
first time in six years; a victory in
track from the Blue and Gold for the
seventh consecutive time; the revival
of crew; and a spring training period
in American football in preparation for
intercollegiate athletics were contin
ued by the men in the S. A. T. C. under
the direction of Captain S. M. Parker,
commanding the Stanford Unit. Amer
ican football was chosen as the sport
in which competition could best be
obtained, and a schedule was arranged
with several service teams, including
the S. A. C. C. units at the University
of California and the University of
Southern California. One of the of
ficers attached to the unit was detailed
to direct the coaching the football
eleven, and under his direction a cred
itable team was put on the field, which
played games with the Mare Island
sailors, the Mather Field aviators, and
the University of Southern California,
culminating in the big game of the
season with the University of Cali
fornia.

It was the first time since 1905 that
Stanford and California had met on
the gridiron, and the Cardinal enthusi
asm was not dampened by the 67 to 0
defeat that the Blue and Gold team
administered. The Stanford team
fought hard against their experienced
opponents, and at times showed occa
sional spurts of good football.
With the advent of American foot
ball on the sport calendar, Rugby be
gan to decline as a sport on the
"Farm." However, a fifteen was put
on the field made up of candidates
from the S. A. T. C., and games were
played with Santa Clara and the Palo
Alto Athletic Club. Three contests
played with the Mission team resulted
in two victories for Sanla Clara and
one for Stanford.
On Washington's Birthday, after the
demobilization of the S. A. T. C., Cali
fornia and Stanford met on the rugby
field for the first timo since 1915. The
contest was hard fought and resulted
in a Cardinal victory by the score of
21 to 8.
With the beginning of the winter

quarter, Coach Bob Evans arrived 011
the Campus in time to start work with
the basketball squad and succeeded in
developing a quintet that went through
the season with only the University of
California and St. Ignatius College
scoring victories against them. Stan
ford finished fourth in the California-
Nevada League. The series with the
Berkeley team resulted in two straight
games being lost by Stanford by the
scores of 29 and 34 to 25.
Baseball and track started out the
spring season with Coach Evans direct
ing the baseball men and at the same
time working with the track candi
dates assisted by "Feg" Murray and
Captain Teitsworth. Baseball pros
pects were not very bright during the
preliminary season, and most of the
games resulted with the Cardinal on
the short end of the s e. The open
ing of the spring oi'axter brought sev
eral old players back, and these men,
aided by the development of Newland
and Pelouze as pitchers, put the Star,
ford nine on its feet, and the Varsity
rounded into form. Stanford went
into the California series scheduled to
lose, but the dope was upset, and two
straight games were won by the scores
of sto 2 and sto 3. It is the first time
since 1913 that Stanford has won a
baseball series from California.
For the seventh consecutive time,
Stanford track men won the meet from
California. The occasion was featured
by the dope sheet going wrong, as
both teams lost where they expected
to win and won where they expected
to lose. Wells of Stanford took four
first places in the track events, and
"Dink" Templeton went his brother
"Ric" two places better in the broad
jump by taking first place and cinch
ing the meet for Stanford. Stanford
won by a margin of seven points, the
final score being 73y 2 to <nd]/ 2 .
Crew was revived on the "Farm"
this year by a campaign among the
students for funds, which resulted in
varsity and freshmen shells being en
tered in the big regatta at the Ala
meda Estuary on May 3. "Les" Rog
ers, a former crew star and the only
member of the famous Poughkeepsie
crew to return to college, acted as
coach. The Varsity entered the race
with California and the University of
Washington, backed to the limit by
the Cardinal supporters, but the husky
oarsmen from Washington finished
first, with California second and Stan
ford third.
With the announcement of the
Board of Athletic Control that Ameri
can football would be played next
year, plans were immediately made for
spring training. After the conclusion
of the spring sports, practice started
under Bob Evans as coach. Over 100
candidates reported for the short train
ing period, and from this number
Evans hopes to develop ii successful
team next fall. About half of the
candidates have had experience.
Games will be played with the Uni
versity of Oregon, Oregon Agricultural
College, St. Mary's, Santa Clara, and
the University of Southern California.
A game has not. been scheduled with
the University of California.

OTARTING out the season of 1918-
& 19 by playing American football dur
ing the period of the S. A. T. C.; the
employment of "Fighting Bob" Evans
in the spring as athletic coach; the
winning of the baseball series from
the University of California for the
first time in six years; a victory in
track from the Blue and Gold for the
seventh consecutive time; the revival
of crew; and a spring training period
in American football in preparation for
intercollegiate athletics were contin
ued by the men in the S. A. T. C. under
the direction of Captain S. M. Parker,
commanding the Stanford Unit. Amer
ican football was chosen as the sport
in which competition could best be
obtained, and a schedule was arranged
with several service teams, including
the S. A. C. C. units at the University
of California and the University of
Southern California. One of the of
ficers attached to the unit was detailed
to direct the coaching the football
eleven, and under his direction a cred
itable team was put on the field, which
played games with the Mare Island
sailors, the Mather Field aviators, and
the University of Southern California,
culminating in the big game of the
season with the University of Cali
fornia.

It was the first time since 1905 that
Stanford and California had met on
the gridiron, and the Cardinal enthusi
asm was not dampened by the 67 to 0
defeat that the Blue and Gold team
administered. The Stanford team
fought hard against their experienced
opponents, and at times showed occa
sional spurts of good football.
With the advent of American foot
ball on the sport calendar, Rugby be
gan to decline as a sport on the
"Farm." However, a fifteen was put
on the field made up of candidates
from the S. A. T. C., and games were
played with Santa Clara and the Palo
Alto Athletic Club. Three contests
played with the Mission team resulted
in two victories for Sanla Clara and
one for Stanford.
On Washington's Birthday, after the
demobilization of the S. A. T. C., Cali
fornia and Stanford met on the rugby
field for the first timo since 1915. The
contest was hard fought and resulted
in a Cardinal victory by the score of
21 to 8.
With the beginning of the winter

quarter, Coach Bob Evans arrived 011
the Campus in time to start work with
the basketball squad and succeeded in
developing a quintet that went through
the season with only the University of
California and St. Ignatius College
scoring victories against them. Stan
ford finished fourth in the California-
Nevada League. The series with the
Berkeley team resulted in two straight
games being lost by Stanford by the
scores of 29 and 34 to 25.
Baseball and track started out the
spring season with Coach Evans direct
ing the baseball men and at the same
time working with the track candi
dates assisted by "Feg" Murray and
Captain Teitsworth. Baseball pros
pects were not very bright during the
preliminary season, and most of the
games resulted with the Cardinal on
the short end of the s e. The open
ing of the spring oi'axter brought sev
eral old players back, and these men,
aided by the development of Newland
and Pelouze as pitchers, put the Star,
ford nine on its feet, and the Varsity
rounded into form. Stanford went
into the California series scheduled to
lose, but the dope was upset, and two
straight games were won by the scores
of sto 2 and sto 3. It is the first time
since 1913 that Stanford has won a
baseball series from California.
For the seventh consecutive time,
Stanford track men won the meet from
California. The occasion was featured
by the dope sheet going wrong, as
both teams lost where they expected
to win and won where they expected
to lose. Wells of Stanford took four
first places in the track events, and
"Dink" Templeton went his brother
"Ric" two places better in the broad
jump by taking first place and cinch
ing the meet for Stanford. Stanford
won by a margin of seven points, the
final score being 73y 2 to <nd]/ 2 .
Crew was revived on the "Farm"
this year by a campaign among the
students for funds, which resulted in
varsity and freshmen shells being en
tered in the big regatta at the Ala

straight games were won by the scores
of sto 2 and sto 3. It is the first time
since 1913 that Stanford has won a
baseball series from California.
For the seventh consecutive time,
Stanford track men won the meet from
California. The occasion was featured
by the dope sheet going wrong, as
both teams lost where they expected
to win and won where they expected
to lose. Wells of Stanford took four
first places in the track events, and
"Dink" Templeton went his brother
"Ric" two places better in the broad
jump by taking first place and cinch
ing the meet for Stanford. Stanford
won by a margin of seven points, the
final score being 73y 2 to <nd]/ 2 .
Crew was revived on the "Farm"
this year by a campaign among the
students for funds, which resulted in
varsity and freshmen shells being en
tered in the big regatta at the Ala
meda Estuary on May 3. "Les" Rog
ers, a former crew star and the only
member of the famous Poughkeepsie
crew to return to college, acted as
coach. The Varsity entered the race
with California and the University of
Washington, backed to the limit by
the Cardinal supporters, but the husky
oarsmen from Washington finished
first, with California second and Stan
ford third.
With the announcement of the
Board of Athletic Control that Ameri
can football would be played next
year, plans were immediately made for
spring training. After the conclusion
of the spring sports, practice started
under Bob Evans as coach. Over 100
candidates reported for the short train
ing period, and from this number
Evans hopes to develop ii successful
team next fall. About half of the
candidates have had experience.
Games will be played with the Uni
versity of Oregon, Oregon Agricultural
College, St. Mary's, Santa Clara, and
the University of Southern California.
A game has not. been scheduled with
the University of California.
