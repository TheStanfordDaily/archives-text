# SENIOR FARCE WELL RECEIVED ON CAMPUS
## 
### 
to the efforts of well-trained
and talented east the Senior Farce,
"Nothing But the Truth," given on
Thursday evening, June 12, was a de
cided success. To Coach Gordon
Davis, '18, much credit can be given
for the success of the production.
Bulord Williams, 'IG, the leading
man in the Senior Farce, delighted the
audience with his free and easy man
ner. He took the part of Rob Bennett,
who bet he could tell nothing but the
truth for twenty-four hours. Williams,
who is an old favorite on the Stanford
stage, lived up to his reputation of for
mer years.
James Boyle, '20, and Miss Mary
Largent, '20, who have both been seen
at previous times in local dramatics,
displayed their talents better than ever
before. Both carried their parts with
the unaffected air of the professional.
To Miss Mona Gardner, who took the
leading woman's part, a large amount
of credit is due, considering that she is
a novice on the stage. She fitted her
part well and played up excellently to
the more experienced members of the
cast.
Robert Reid, '21, represented the cold,
hard business man with a good deal
of ability. Miss Margaret Shedd, '20,
did credit to the part she took. As
Bishop Doran, Ben Harris, *20, was a
"howling" success, literally speaking.
Miss Irene Bonnett might be said to
have achieved the same. She was
charming in the part of an extremely
sensitive young girl. J. W. Rhodes
showed an amount of talent in repre
senting the charms of a young busi
ness man. Several parts were also
carried off with credit by Miss Kather
ine Huntington, '19, and Miss Vivian
Hobson, '19.
