# COMPLETE HISTORY OF NINETEEN GLASS COMPILED BY KELLOGG

### Chever Kellogg, '19 
jPACII year the American universities
graduate a class. Graduation is a cere
mony that represents the passing of a
person into the world, the change of
the student into the man, the final step
of youth to self-reliance.
As a member of Stanford's Class of
'19 it is my privilege to tell of a few
of the events that marked the progress
of the class through its career here in
the University, there in the service of
the country. The history of the Class
of '19 is in a way the history of v an
epoch. The world has regenerated, the
nation has been tried and found worthy,
the University has passed through an
ordeal and has emerged with a worthier
rank than ever.
September, 1915, witnessed our initia
tion into Stanford life. For the boys
there was a week of disconcerting fes
tivity. The girls were afforded interest
as spectators. The final outcome was
that further freshmen receptions of like
fervor were banned. But 1919 felt sat
isfied that it had shown a maximum of
the true fighting spirit that would later
typify us as true Stanford men. Those
were the days when we didn't know each
other. When an eighteener yelled
"Nineteen nineteen" we rushed to his
aid and told our own nineteener that he
couldn't bluff us; we know about such
tricks.
We were the first class since '16 to
win our freshman rush. Most of us re
member that we tried to join at least
three other huskies of two or three
times our weight, so that we could more
ably defend the honor of 1919. And we
did it. All the eighteeners went home
with paint in one eye. It was the sec
ond taste of war for us, and we were
stronger than ever. We began to know
each other. Some of us even kept a
weather eye on the bleachers. Perhaps
we met her at the Y. M. C. A. reception
in the new Encina Gym.
And then came football, and we all
signed up, whether we should have
signed for crew coxswain or the ham
mer throw. We had our first taste of
rallies, and we went home hoarse.
We began to meet the big men around
the farm. Here was one all-star man,
there was another. There would never
be any more like them. The Dippy
would die when so and so graduated.
There never was an actor as good as
the man we just passed. All this we be
lieved thoroughly. However, we intend
ed to do our best.
The bonfire was no small affair. With
A. C. Brown and Dick Derby in charge
there was nothing to burn within three
was nothing to burn within three miles
of the University when the pyre was fin
ished. We beat Santa Clara 30 to 0
that year.
We may mention the game between
California and Washington: California 0,
Washington 72. There were some amohg
us then that wished that we had played
American, so that we could have claimed
the 72.
During this time the Fair was going
on. Many of us had never seen it be
fore our college life f>egan, and so on
those Saturdays following the end of the
football season we made regular pil
grimages to the Exposition. The Cali
fornia Building, the Hawaiian orchestra,
the Zone, and those delectable Southern
pancakes advertising flour at its best—
such were the pleasures that wc enjoyed.
Many an English A composition men
tioned Art Smith.
We had won our freshman rush, our
freshman football, our freshman basket
ball, and the semester was over. There
was nothing left for us to do but pass
the finals. Most of us passed them.
The second semester began with the
usual financeers on hand in front of the
Registrar's Office. Wc knew better this
time. Training for crew, baseball, and
track began almost immediately. The
competition was never so keen. On the
freshman crew inch men as Watts, Wil
liamson, Taylor, Montgomery, and King
took their place. Watts has captained
this year's Varsity, and a better man
could not have been chosen. Everyone
on the Campus knows Freddy William
son, and everyone likes him. Montgom
ery has coxswained two Varsity crews.
King is the President-elect of the Stu
dent Body. That lie is the one man for
the place no one will deny. Palmer Tay

lor was one of the first men of the class
to give his life for the Allies. He died
and he is remembered as a thorough
in the service of the Royal Flying Corps,
gentleman and friend. Other men in
that crew were Laforge, Bent, Brown,
and Atwater. With such a crew 1919
rowed a sturdy race, but California ex
ceeded us in power and won.
The freshman 1919 baseball team, Ken
Lilly, Mel Shriver, Jimmie Messick,
Kaiser, Regan, Mitchell, Ryan. Boyd
ston, Peterson, and Draper, played a
winning season. Ken Lilly, all-around
man, has tilled every position of re
sponsibility that the Campus has had to
offer. He has not yet run cross coun
try, but every other sport is his.
The track men given hy 1919 are Jud
House, Bobby Pelouze, Wilcox, Curtice,
Caughey, Needham, Lilly, Westwick,
Bob Rogers, and Cracky Teitsworth.
Other men on the frosh team were
Floete, Wark, Glikbarg, Foster, Davis,
Boulware, Loomis, Wood, Bacon, Bisch,
and Price.
The sophomore year began with most
of the old men back. The war was
coming nearer. Herbert Hoover had

turned his every effort to the aid of Bel
gium. Dr. Wilbur liad told us in his
inaugural address that Belgium was in
need of our armed assistance. The
United States was slowly awakening.
While the European battlefront wavered
back and forth like the tide on the shore
the American people steadily acquired
the spirit of the crusader.
There were those who advised peace
and those who advised war. General
Bell of the Western Department lent
us his aid, and Major Bugge of the
Regular Army came to organize the
Stanford unit of the R. O. T. C. Pro
fessor Durand began his important work
in propellor testing at this time. We
were honored at an assembly with talks
by Miss Crocker and Dr. Shadworthe
Beasley, both of whom had already
served abroad. Dr. Beasley, recipient
of the Congressional Medal, gave his life
while saving others later in the war.
Nineteen hundred and nineteen
whipped the freshmen in the annual
rush. The rally for football brought out
forty nincteeners, and the season began.
Then came our sophomore play. We
couldn't all take part, but all of us par
ticipated in the tryouts. Dave Smith,
Dick Derby and Teresa Hihn left us a
most pleasant memory of the "Show
Shop," as it was called. It was a
clever show, most cleverly put on.
The call for volunteers in the first am
bulance unit came November 3d, 1916.
Twenty were wanted —a hundred volun
teered. These men were sent by the
Friends of France, and in France carried
the first American flag. Nineteen nine
teen sent men in that unit who will never
come home. They have already given
humanity their best. Allen Nichols, '19,
gave his life in an aerial combat while
saving another Stanford man.
During that semester one of our class
mates —W. I. Ames, since well known as
manager <>112 various organizations, ac

tivities, and societies—first came before
the public in the U. S. C. debate. We
won. Another man prominent in the
annals of the class who defended the
Cardinal forensic honors that semester
was Goody Dwight. Goody has si'ice
managed the Quad, been associate editor
of Chapparal and the Illustrated Re
view, and is well known for his capa
bility as an actor.
In January came the submarine cam
paign, followed by Wilson's ultimatum
and war. After a most successful sea
son in crew and tracic, intensive mili
tary training began, and student activi
ties became military activities altogether.
All of us remember the succession of
drill on drill and the presence of Waf
fles the mascot and Measles, what you j
will, at each formation. Then the first
training camp opened. The second am
bulance unit followed, taking Neil Pe
tree, Bobby Pelouze, Carl Floete, and
Harold Sayre of the Class o) '19. The
third and fourth ambulance units left in
quick succession. The draft was en
acted and put into execution. Th< sutn-j
mer passed and our junior year i an
The class found itself somewhat lei

pleted but not sorry for it. It took up
its work under difficulties but with the
Stanford will to win. Nineteen nine
teen contributed seven of the fifteen
football men and the score was 15 to 11.
Stanford won. The city papers said
that the fighting spirit of our team won
the game in the fall of superior strength.
By this time Germany had obliterated
Russia, and for a moment Italy had
broken. The destruction of shipping was
appalling. The morale of the Allies was
reduced. The winter intervened. The
United States trained regiment after
regiment and brigade on brigade. The
spring might have a different tale to tell,
but none could see the end of the war.
Already some of the stars of Stanford
men had turned to gold.
January, February, March came; the
weather would not permit of the Ger
man drive. Then it began. Stanford
might have been Paris for the suspense.
But victory was the only end we would
admit. The women of the class were
steadfast. Sweaters, entertainment for
the soldiers at the camp, clothing for
the orphan and refugee, regard and kind
ness—these were furnished lavishly.
However, in keeping with the training
for the army, sport went on and once
more we won the annual track meet 70
to 52, Stanford's sixth successive vic
tory.
Meanwhile the third and fourth offi
cers Training Corp had begun, and
many of the men who were, left went
to the summer camp at the Presidio.
While there the news of Chateau Thier
ry, Belleau Woods, and St. Mihiel came,
showing the mettle of the American sol
dier. Also we received the news of the
transference of the University into an
army school for the S. A. T. C.
Otcober Ist found few of the Class of
'19 here. The few that were here un
der strict military discipline drilled and

| studied for the sole purpose of being
ready for the occasion when their call
would come.
l"he influenza epidemic took with it
Willard Lawson and John Ware. The
battle of the Argonne came and ended
the war. Demobilization was completed
December 13, 1919, and the reconstruc
tion of Stanford began.
Many nineteeuers returned with the
winter quarter; the spring quarter
brought many more. •
The 1919 men who have given their
lives for their country are Lleyellen
Hartshorn, Millard Lawson, Palmer
Taylor, Harold Sayre, Clarence Tyrrell.
Clement Jacomin, Greayor Clover, Alan
Nichols (Croix de Guerre), Caldwell
Robinson (D. S. C.)
The '19ers who have served their
country are too numerous to name.
Those who have been decorated are
Alan Nichols, Croix de Guerre; Cald
well Robinson, D. S. C.; Julian Burton,
Croix de Guerre; George Hall, Croix de

Guerre; Henry Warren. Croix de
Guerre.
We may, then, be said to have learned
many things while here at Stanford.
We have learned to think of things in
larger terms than a provincial way.
We are internationalists, may it be said,
but always from our point of view. We
are internationalists by virtue of being
Stanford men, Western men, Ameri
cans. We have a great deal to give
and a great deal to receive. If we have
a worthy thing to give, let us defend it,
for who will know of its value other
wise? Like many another thing of
beauty it, too, may be in need of a
champion. There arc innumerable
l worthy tilings for us to choose and to
defend; there is no need for choice
greater than this. Realizing that per
haps this want of choice may then be
the key to all success, we bid farewell
to the school that set us on our way.
We are none the less Stanford men now
than yesterday and will be so through
out our lives.
