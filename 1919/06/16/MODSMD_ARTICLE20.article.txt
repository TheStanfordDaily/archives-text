# Knight Delivers Class Oration
## 
### 
WOi* Y we are thinking of the end
01 the career of the class of 1919
in Siaiuord, and that calls to mind
tht beginning of 1919 as a unit. We all
remember when we came we enjoyed
for a few days the pleasures and pastimes
of the great International ExpuoiVio.'
San Francisco. Then five hundred
strong, September saw us, the fresli .. n
class, expectant, eager, ambitious. As
individuals we cherished hopes and
fears for the future. Then the great
poster fight, when for the first time
we linked arms with the fellows from
California and Canada, New York and
Nebraska, and marched up the row to
meet the sophomores coming down the
country road. That night the class was
born. The men, shouting their defiance
as they met their traditional foe, knew
it, and the women hearing the sound
of a new cla*s number were proud of'
1919.
I hi next d.jy Pres-Hent Branner
coined us to the University, anc
Jordan spoke, counseling us thr
should remember that "knowledg
power, wisdom was knowing what iu
do next, and that virtue was doing it."
Two years of underclass work and
play slipped by, ajnd then came the
war. Class 1919 sent men, and the
women, keenly alive to the exigencies of
the hour, responded with work and
sacrifice at home. Eight of our men
died in service ,one of whom was our
sophomore president. Eight fine, splen
did fellows, whose memory we cherish
and whose achievements we honor.
Unlike twenty odd classes who have
gone before us, we have combined aca
demic and professional study with mili
tary training and overseas service. The
four years have been crowded full of
the manifold experiences of twenty years.
And now this week, when we all are
together, perhaps for the last time, we
strengthen the bond of friendship, and
each in his own way breathes a prayer
of new allegiance and increased devo
tion to the Alma Mater that made the
friendships possible. We have all acted
our part in the four-year drama. Some
of us may be signed up for return en
gagement by the faculty management,
but even so, we pause at this time to
review the acts and scenes of the play
and pronounce our criticism. Nearly two
ice," a quiet, steady determination to
serve the University and to serve the
United States of America. From these
two years we derive the theme of our
future, "Ours Is the New Service."
Ever since the first class in the first
school was graduated, centuries ago,
students at commencement have been
urged that the duty of serving humanity
devolves upon them by reason of bene
fits and privileges conferred on them.
But today as never before, that responsi
bility becomes more of a reality. A
complex political and social life threat
ens us each day with new difficulties.
I'usincss and trade, the ppulse of the
nation, calls for greater speed, power,
and perfection. Problems of labor, capi
tal and reconstruction demand solution.
Just as we played our part here, we

must out there. But a class which has
seen college life, army life, trench life,
and life in the air has a greater concep
tion of what that part shall ho th in any
other previous or later undergraduates.
For they have heard and known of thr
\v serv io ,i cod" of accomplishment
that elevate purpose ahove prestige.
Mere intellectual power and technical
learning will avail US little* tomorrow,
unless we conceive ourselves V 3S still in
service. The same spirit and ideals that
motivated us in 1917 must govern us in
1920.
This week we shall receive from the
trustees of the University a diploma,
a symbol of the trust and confidence
placed in us, and a recognition of tasks
completed which entitle us to a place

That we are known and loved there still,
Though we come back no more.
WOi* Y we are thinking of the end
01 the career of the class of 1919
in Siaiuord, and that calls to mind
tht beginning of 1919 as a unit. We all
remember when we came we enjoyed
for a few days the pleasures and pastimes
of the great International ExpuoiVio.'
San Francisco. Then five hundred
strong, September saw us, the fresli .. n
class, expectant, eager, ambitious. As
individuals we cherished hopes and
fears for the future. Then the great
poster fight, when for the first time
we linked arms with the fellows from
California and Canada, New York and
Nebraska, and marched up the row to
meet the sophomores coming down the
country road. That night the class was
born. The men, shouting their defiance
as they met their traditional foe, knew
it, and the women hearing the sound
of a new cla*s number were proud of'
1919.
I hi next d.jy Pres-Hent Branner
coined us to the University, anc
Jordan spoke, counseling us thr
should remember that "knowledg
power, wisdom was knowing what iu
do next, and that virtue was doing it."
Two years of underclass work and
play slipped by, ajnd then came the
war. Class 1919 sent men, and the
women, keenly alive to the exigencies of
the hour, responded with work and
sacrifice at home. Eight of our men
died in service ,one of whom was our
sophomore president. Eight fine, splen
did fellows, whose memory we cherish
and whose achievements we honor.
Unlike twenty odd classes who have
gone before us, we have combined aca
demic and professional study with mili
tary training and overseas service. The
four years have been crowded full of
the manifold experiences of twenty years.
And now this week, when we all are
together, perhaps for the last time, we
strengthen the bond of friendship, and
each in his own way breathes a prayer
of new allegiance and increased devo
tion to the Alma Mater that made the
friendships possible. We have all acted
our part in the four-year drama. Some
of us may be signed up for return en
gagement by the faculty management,
but even so, we pause at this time to
review the acts and scenes of the play
and pronounce our criticism. Nearly two
ice," a quiet, steady determination to
serve the University and to serve the
United States of America. From these
two years we derive the theme of our
future, "Ours Is the New Service."
Ever since the first class in the first
school was graduated, centuries ago,
students at commencement have been
urged that the duty of serving humanity
devolves upon them by reason of bene
fits and privileges conferred on them.
But today as never before, that responsi
bility becomes more of a reality. A
complex political and social life threat
ens us each day with new difficulties.
I'usincss and trade, the ppulse of the
nation, calls for greater speed, power,
and perfection. Problems of labor, capi
tal and reconstruction demand solution.
Just as we played our part here, we

must out there. But a class which has
seen college life, army life, trench life,
and life in the air has a greater concep
tion of what that part shall ho th in any
other previous or later undergraduates.
For they have heard and known of thr
\v serv io ,i cod" of accomplishment
that elevate purpose ahove prestige.
Mere intellectual power and technical
learning will avail US little* tomorrow,
unless we conceive ourselves V 3S still in
service. The same spirit and ideals that
motivated us in 1917 must govern us in
1920.
