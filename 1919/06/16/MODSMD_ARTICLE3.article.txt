# PAGEANT WILL TELL STANFORD HISTORY

### Ruth Lakin, 19 
the great Stanford his
toricnl pomimt, to he given tonight
on the Track Oval, will be one of the
most stupendous affairs ever witnessed
on the farm. From the opening scene,
"The Ballot Prelude," in which will he
shown the flowers and wild creatures,
typifying the land before man came, to
the "Grand Finale" at the close, the
audience will be held with interest.
"Service" is not only strikingly spec
tacular, but is unusual and unique in
pageantry. It is seldom, if ever, that
history can be reen by the makers of it,
but with the appearance of Dr. Jordan
and the "Old Guard" members of the
first faculty in scene 4, "The Founding
of Stanford University," this will be
accomplished. Others than Stanford
alumni and students will feel the thrill
of impressiveness when Dr. Jordan reads
his inaugural address of 1891.
"The Decoration of the Stanford
Colors" and"The Stanford C. A. R.
in Belgium" will perhaps be the main
features of the evening. Here again, in
the presentation of the Croix fie Guerre
to the first American flag on the scene
of war, many of the men who were
actually part of the ceremony in France,
and the very llag so honored by the
French nation, will be present. The
representation of the Stanford relief in
Belgium through Mr. Hoover will be
made very spectacular by the use of
red tire and the explosion of real bombs.
Also the drone of the planes overhead
will help greatly to make the whole
unusually realistic and effective. Both
scenes give the audience a first-hand
impression such as no picture or stories
could ever hope to do, and will in them
selves prove the pageant a success.
The other episodes are equally true
to history, though the facts arc probably
not so well known to the present gen
ly following, will be one of dramatic
interest. The "mysterious Frenchman,"
one of the most celebrated characters
connected with the history of Stanford,
is to be portrayed for the first time since
his disappearance in 1880. This scene,
showing Peter Coutts and his compan
ion, Eugenic Chogensen, and their
friends making merry over their plans
for a great baronial estate, emphasizes

oration. In tin- ' scene Portola
and his iterrupting the
Indian ti, which tra
dition cl intervals un
der the ...auuws ot the great redwood,
Portola through California, about 1770,
has been definitely traced by historians,
and it is known that he came to what
is now called San Francisquito Creek
at a place near the giant redwood tree,
from which Senator Stanford's rancho
and the town later derived their names—
Palo Alto.
The entrance of Father Junipero

Serra. enactned by Dr. Henry Gray of
the English department, and his com
; pany of monks, signifies the coming of
! the Church. The padres on that first
i land expedition from Monterey to the
j Mission Dolores in San Francisco, un-
I der the leadership of Junipero Serra,
1 consecrated the ground under the tree—
j Palo Alto. They planned to found a
I mission there on their return. The
theme running throughout the various
| scenes of part 1."The Conception of
. Service," is definitely voiced in the
j words of Santa Clara, the figure which
| appeared in a vision to Father Serra.
j She bids him to go forward, saying that
j the ground he has consecrated to
, high service must be left to others for
fulfillment in a different way, thus
prophesying the founding of Stanford
University.
"The Story of the Frenchman," direct
! the fact that the plans did not ma-
I terialize because they were selfish. So
| Peter and Eugenie ride away in panic
| and despair, conscious that the tremen
i dons fiirure of "Baron Coutts" will crutu

ble away into a mere legend.
The spirit of the Stanfords will be
fittingly represented in the fourth and
last scene of part I—"The Founding
of, Stanford University"—first by the
lonely figure, Desolation, and then in
the transformed and inspired character,
Alma Mater. Miss Margery Bailey,
one of the auhtors and directors of the
pageant, takes this role.
'fhe portrayal of the Memorial Arch
Frieze by living figures will be unusual
and effective. Nearly fifty persons
take part, and the final tableau repre-

senting tlie entire frieze, the progress
of civilization, is very striking. Equal
ly unique will he"The Play Spirit," or
student life, which follows. The rally
and serpentine, the pajamarino in pur
suit of the obnoxious freshman, the his
torical dustpan parade of the girls,
which celebrated the winning of the
suit, the burning in effigy of U. C. by
the five sports arc all typical representa
tions of Stanford traditions. The sud
den hush at the appearance of the Bel
gian woman will make a very dramatic
transition to the third and last part of
the pageant, "The Culmination of the
Last Four Years."
Mr. V. E. Duffey of Berkeley is re
sponsible for the marvelous lighting dis
play of over 50,000 watts which will
greatly enhance the color effects and
add greatly to the whole.
"Service" is fittingly named after the
theme suggested by Charles K. Field,
who said: "The Stanford pageant is a
representation of the University's con
tribution to the sum of human service."
