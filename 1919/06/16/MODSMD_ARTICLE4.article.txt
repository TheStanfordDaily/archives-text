# "THE SERVICE OF SCIENCE IN A GREAT HUMAN CRISIS"
## Dr. W.F. Durand Delivers Address 
### 
Professor William H. Durand of the |
Department of Mechanical Engineering |
is to give the annual address to the i
members of Phi Beta Kappa, who are
to meet at 4 o'clock this afternoon.
Following the speech an original
poem will be read by Professor E. O.
James of Mills College. A dinner will
be held this evening in honor of the
newly elected members. They will be
initiated into Phi Beta Kappa at that
time.
Professor Duraiul's speech is as fol- j

THE SERVICE OF SCIENCE IN A
GREAT HUMAN CRISIS
IT is not without some trepidation j
that I have ventured to present be- j
fore the Society of Phi Beta Kappa
some account of a phase of human ac-l
tivity in the great war lying some-1
what on one side of the normal view
of the members of the society. I have,
however, been emboldened by the re
flection that precisely because such is
the case the members of the society
may perhaps find an interest in con
sidering for a few moments some as
pects of the broad field of science and
scientific work, and with special ref
erence to its mobilization for service
in a great national crisis.
What, then, is the field of science,
what are its characteristics, what are
the aims and ideals of those who work
therein, and how may they aid in a
national war crisis?
The history of civilization shows a
marked and most interesting devel
opment in the attitude of human
thought toward science. Springing
often from the shadows of supersti
tion and ignorance—as, for example,
astronomy from astrology, chemistry
from alchemy, and medicine from
witchcraft and quackery —the status
of science as a factor in human prog
ress has steadily advanced in signifi
cance and importance, until we find
it today underlying, as we have seen,
the entire material side of our civili
zation. In the beginnings of science
there was a tendency to evolve the
facts of nature from the inner con
sciousness, to make them agree with
some theory or idea regarding cos
mogony or to hold them in accord
with some tenet of religious belief.
In the fullness of time, however,
and with preparation through the
ages, there came, with Bacon and
others following, the concept that
science means the absolutely fearless
and open-minded interrogation of na
ture and her manifestations.
One of the great lessons which the
war has taught is the extent to which
the necessary mobilization extends
back of the front lines —back even of
those who wear uniforms. In a very
real sense modern war carried on by
modern methods means the mobiliza
tion of all the energies of the state
and the services of every man, woman,
and child of working years, in doing
each the one thing which he can do
best, and so coordinated that all ef
forts shall be directed to the one su
preme goal of winning the war. It
means, as we have found, carrying the
mobilization back to the home and to
the fireside, where self-denial in food
is practiced and where necessities for
the hospital and comforts ' for the
trench are made. It means carrying
it into the great fields of industry and
transportation in ways with which we
are all familiar. Back of the lines
some are working to produce muni
tions of war, others are working to
produce the raw materials for such
munitions, others still to transport the
raw materials to the factory and the
completed munitions from the factory
to the military base—others again
must work in order that food and
clothing and the normal necessities
of life may be provided, not only for
j those in uniform but for the munition
I workers and for the community at
| large. But —and this is the main
point — everybody must be doing
something, and that something must
count, in its way, toward the one mil
itary end of winning the war. Such

is the lesson which has been burned
into our souls as a result of the great
war. Such is the character of the na
tional crisis facing the United States
when we finally saw our duty and took
up our part in the great struggle in
April, 1917.
In such a national crisis, then, what
is the part of science and of her vo
taries, and how may such part best
be realized?
The part which science should be
prepared to play in such a crisis seems
clear from what has been said above
regarding its characteristics and pur
poses, placed in comparison with the
demands of war in its fundamental as
pects. Thus 4 tlie main object in war is
always the capture or destruction of
the armed forces of the enemy and the
prevention of the enemy inversely
from accomplishing a like result. To
this end the entire content of nature
is invoked and use may be made of
every fact, of every material sub
stance, of every correlation and law
which may in any manner be directed
toward these supreme military ends.
But since the study of just these facts,
these materials, these correlations,
and these laws constitute the field of
science, just for these reasons should
the scientist be in a position to ren
der valuable service, especially in de
vising new means of warfare and in
meeting new conditions imposed by
the strategy of the enemy.
The immediate crisis past, the spe
cial significance of the relation was
lost sight of and in the usual manner
of a bureaucratic organization of gov
ernmental detail, the various bureaus
and departments of the Government
began to build up, each within its
own domain such scientific and tech
nical staffs as would serve the nor
mal demands under peace conditions,
leaving the National Academy of
Sciences to develop as a select scien
tific society with all the prestige
which attaches to limited membership,
governmental relationship, advanced
requirement as to qualifications, etc.,
but with 110 special standing as an
adviser of the Government in scien
tific matters or as a factor in the in
vestigation of the various scientific
problems with which the Government
might be concerned.
The situation remained substantial
ly as outlined until 1916, when, with
a plainly discernible drift toward par
ticipation by the United States in the
great conflict, there came a realizing
sense of the part which science was
playing on the battlefields of Europe
and of the part which it must play
in any effective participation by the
United States. This realization came,
not only to scientists themselves but
to high officials of the Government as
well, resulting in an executive order
directing the organization of a Na
tional Research Council by the Na
tional Academy of Sciences and rest
ing on the academy charter, while at
the same time the working member
ship of the academy, in order to bring
in greater numbers and to make avail
able the services of any worker in
science regardless of his affiliations in
scientific bodies.
The National Research Council,
thus formed, was intended to serve
as a form of central agency standing
between the workers in science and
facilities for scientific research on the
one band and military and naval gov
ernmental departments and authori
ties on the other.
The situation in a large way showed
the following chief elements:
(1) Governmental bodies, agencies,
or organizations of various kinds and
engaged, to a greater or less extent,
in scientific work and qualified and
equipped to carry on the same —such
as, for example, the Bureau of Stand
ards, the Bureau of Mines, the Geo
logical Survey, the National Advisory
Committee for Aeronautics, the Mag
netic Laboratory, the Bureau of Chem
istry, and certain other divisions of
the Department of Agriculture, the
Meteorological Service, etc.
I (2) Laboratories and scientific men.
