### 
Professor William H. Durand of the |
Department of Mechanical Engineering |
is to give the annual address to the i
members of Phi Beta Kappa, who are
to meet at 4 o'clock this afternoon.
Following the speech an original
poem will be read by Professor E. O.
James of Mills College. A dinner will
be held this evening in honor of the
newly elected members. They will be
initiated into Phi Beta Kappa at that
time.
Professor Duraiul's speech is as fol- j
lows:
THE SERVICE OF SCIENCE IN A
GREAT HUMAN CRISIS
IT is not without some trepidation j
that I have ventured to present be- j
fore the Society of Phi Beta Kappa
some account of a phase of human ac-l
tivity in the great war lying some-1
what on one side of the normal view
of the members of the society. I have,
however, been emboldened by the re
flection that precisely because such is
the case the members of the society
may perhaps find an interest in con
sidering for a few moments some as
pects of the broad field of science and
scientific work, and with special ref
erence to its mobilization for service
in a great national crisis.
What, then, is the field of science,
what are its characteristics, what are
the aims and ideals of those who work
therein, and how may they aid in a
national war crisis?
The history of civilization shows a
marked and most interesting devel
opment in the attitude of human
thought toward science. Springing
often from the shadows of supersti
tion and ignorance—as, for example,
astronomy from astrology, chemistry
from alchemy, and medicine from
witchcraft and quackery —the status
of science as a factor in human prog
ress has steadily advanced in signifi
cance and importance, until we find
it today underlying, as we have seen,
the entire material side of our civili
zation. In the beginnings of science
there was a tendency to evolve the
facts of nature from the inner con
sciousness, to make them agree with
some theory or idea regarding cos
mogony or to hold them in accord
with some tenet of religious belief.
In the fullness of time, however,
and with preparation through the
ages, there came, with Bacon and
others following, the concept that
science means the absolutely fearless
and open-minded interrogation of na
ture and her manifestations.
One of the great lessons which the
war has taught is the extent to which
the necessary mobilization extends
back of the front lines —back even of
those who wear uniforms. In a very
real sense modern war carried on by
modern methods means the mobiliza
tion of all the energies of the state
and the services of every man, woman,
and child of working years, in doing
each the one thing which he can do
best, and so coordinated that all ef
forts shall be directed to the one su
preme goal of winning the war. It
means, as we have found, carrying the
mobilization back to the home and to
the fireside, where self-denial in food
is practiced and where necessities for
the hospital and comforts ' for the
trench are made. It means carrying
it into the great fields of industry and
transportation in ways with which we
are all familiar. Back of the lines
some are working to produce muni
tions of war, others are working to
produce the raw materials for such
munitions, others still to transport the
raw materials to the factory and the
completed munitions from the factory
to the military base—others again
must work in order that food and
clothing and the normal necessities
of life may be provided, not only for
j those in uniform but for the munition
I workers and for the community at
| large. But —and this is the main
point — everybody must be doing
something, and that something must
count, in its way, toward the one mil
itary end of winning the war. Such

is the lesson which has been burned
into our souls as a result of the great
war. Such is the character of the na
tional crisis facing the United States
when we finally saw our duty and took
up our part in the great struggle in
April, 1917.
In such a national crisis, then, what
is the part of science and of her vo
taries, and how may such part best
be realized?
The part which science should be
prepared to play in such a crisis seems
clear from what has been said above
regarding its characteristics and pur
poses, placed in comparison with the
demands of war in its fundamental as
pects. Thus 4 tlie main object in war is
always the capture or destruction of
the armed forces of the enemy and the
prevention of the enemy inversely
from accomplishing a like result. To
this end the entire content of nature
is invoked and use may be made of
every fact, of every material sub
stance, of every correlation and law
which may in any manner be directed
toward these supreme military ends.
But since the study of just these facts,
these materials, these correlations,
and these laws constitute the field of
science, just for these reasons should
the scientist be in a position to ren
der valuable service, especially in de
vising new means of warfare and in
meeting new conditions imposed by
the strategy of the enemy.
The immediate crisis past, the spe
cial significance of the relation was
lost sight of and in the usual manner
of a bureaucratic organization of gov
ernmental detail, the various bureaus
and departments of the Government
began to build up, each within its
own domain such scientific and tech
nical staffs as would serve the nor
mal demands under peace conditions,
leaving the National Academy of
Sciences to develop as a select scien
tific society with all the prestige
which attaches to limited membership,
governmental relationship, advanced
requirement as to qualifications, etc.,
but with 110 special standing as an
adviser of the Government in scien
tific matters or as a factor in the in
vestigation of the various scientific
problems with which the Government
might be concerned.
The situation remained substantial
ly as outlined until 1916, when, with
a plainly discernible drift toward par
ticipation by the United States in the
great conflict, there came a realizing
sense of the part which science was
playing on the battlefields of Europe
and of the part which it must play
in any effective participation by the
United States. This realization came,
not only to scientists themselves but
to high officials of the Government as
well, resulting in an executive order
directing the organization of a Na
tional Research Council by the Na
tional Academy of Sciences and rest
ing on the academy charter, while at
the same time the working member
ship of the academy, in order to bring
in greater numbers and to make avail
able the services of any worker in
science regardless of his affiliations in
scientific bodies.
The National Research Council,
thus formed, was intended to serve
as a form of central agency standing
between the workers in science and
facilities for scientific research on the
one band and military and naval gov
ernmental departments and authori
ties on the other.
The situation in a large way showed
the following chief elements:
(1) Governmental bodies, agencies,
or organizations of various kinds and
engaged, to a greater or less extent,
in scientific work and qualified and
equipped to carry on the same —such
as, for example, the Bureau of Stand
ards, the Bureau of Mines, the Geo
logical Survey, the National Advisory
Committee for Aeronautics, the Mag
netic Laboratory, the Bureau of Chem
istry, and certain other divisions of
the Department of Agriculture, the
Meteorological Service, etc.
I (2) Laboratories and scientific men.
mostly at institutions of learning,
scattered over the entire United
States, and qualified for the study of
war problems in various ways and in
varying degrees, both as to personal
attainments and training and as to
laboratory equipment and facilities.
(3) Certain large and splendidly
equipped research laboratories or
ganized in connection with certain
great industries.
(4) Scientific, technieal, and engi
neering societies, national for the
most part in scope, and covering the
entire field of science both pure and
applied.
(5) Rapidly expanding military and
naval services, bristling with problems
involving questions of science and re
quiring the aid of scientists in two
chief capacities:
(a) As a direct part of the military
or naval personnel, for service with
the colors and in charge of specially
technical or scientific matters.
(b) For service in research labora
tories in the study of war problems
in the general field of new devices,
new methods, or improvement and
advance over existing conditions.
With these factors in the field the
Research Council was organized, not
for the purpose of forming an addi
tional or separate body but for the
purpose of serving, especially where
the need existed, as a common rally
ing point for the various agencies
noted especially under (2), and as a
helpful intermediary between the
needs of the military and naval serv
ices on the one hand and these vari
ous agencies for scientific work on
the other. Where the contact between
the military departments and an ade
quate scientific agency or body was
already established there was no need
for intrusion. It was rather to occu
py the enormous field where there was
no natural contact between the mili
tary and naval services and an ade
quate source of scientific help that the
Research Council was formed. It did
not propose primarily to organize or
operate laboratories or to conduct re
search of and by itself, but preferably
to serve as a means of contact be
tween the need for research on the
one hand the best existing source of
supply on the other, whether the lat
ter was expressible in terms of a man,
or a laboratory, or both.
Thus conceived and organized the
chief functions of the council were:
(1) To find, for any specific prob
lem or research bearing relation to
our preparation, for or participation
in the war, the best man available,
and to facilitate, as far as possible, his
immediate attack of the problem of
research.
(2) To find, for any bureau or sub
division of the Departments of War
or Navy, men of specified technical
qualifications desired for military or
naval service along technical or scien
tific lines.
(3) To find, for any scientist in a
position to contribute his time and
energies directly to the study of war
problems, the most suitable field of
activity, having in view his own char
acteristics and special abilities and
the nature of the problems in which
he might be expected to render most
effective service.
(4) To serve as a center of organi
zation for various special boards or
committees whose functions it should
be to study specific problems of large
scope arising in connection with war
preparations or with the production of
war munitions and supplies.
(5) In special cases and where it
might seem desirable, to itself or
ganize and direct research bearing
upon specific military or naval prob
lems.
In order the better to realize these
various ends, the council was divided
into a series of divisions and the di
visions into sections, each section
dealing with a fairly definite subdivi
sion of scientific work.
In order also to meet certain needs,
as above indicated, a number of spe
cial committees were organized, in
cluding often representatives of sev-l
oral sections, but dealing in each case
with some one specific problem.

Without at this time attempting to
give any complete picture of this large
and somewhat complex organization
it will serve present purposes to note
some of the representative sections
and committees with some indication
of the character of work which they
were organized to carry forward.
Thus there were organized sections
of physics, chemistry, engineering,
geology, botany, agriculture and for
estry, medicine, psychology, and spe
cial committees on the problems of
the submarine, optical glass, nitrates
and nitrogen fixation, marine instru
i ments, etc.
To give even a cursory account of
1 the work of any one of these sections
or committees would require more
i time than, on the present occasion,
j can be allotted to the entire subject,
! and only the briefest characterization
of the work can therefore be indi
cated.
The section of physics cooperated in
the investigation of problems relating
to submarine detection, sound rang
ing for enemy artillery, light ranging
for the same, the improvement of op
tical instruments, search lights, range
finders, aeronautic instruments, bomb
dropping sights, photographic equip
ment and methods, secret signaling,
etc.
The section of chemistry cooperated
in the study of a great diversity of
chemical problems, some of them
strictly military and some of them in
dustrial and directed toward making
the United State sindependent of Ger
many in the manufacture of impor
j tant matters of commerce such as dye
stuffs and special medicine.
Of the strictly military problems,
those of chief importance related to
poison gas, explosives, nitrates and ni
trogen fixation, potash recovery from
industrial wastes, special varnishes
for airplane wings, glues for airplane
propellers and other parts, drugs and
medicines in co-operation with the
section of physics in the study of
problems relating to submarine de
tection, aeronautic instruments, the
development of certain new forms of
ordnance, etc., while it dealt also with
a wide range of problems dealing with
airplane engine fuels, lubrication, spe
cial materials for the manufacture of
ordnance materiel, etc., besides serv
ing as a general body for the exami
nation of inventions and new ideas
submitted by inventors, and ranging
over the entire field of war munitions
and supplies.
The section of geology was planned
primarily with reference to the fur
nishing of men competent as geolo
gists to serve with the forces abroad
and to act as advisers with reference
to the geological adaptation of any
given locality for specific purposes.
Perhaps for the first time in the evo
lution of methods of warfare, the sig
nifiicance of the aid and advice of the
geologist has in this war been prop
erly recognized. Thus, with reference
to the adaptation of a given terrain
for a permanent camp, for trench or
dugout construction, for mining oper
ations, questions of water supply,
drainage, sanitation, road building,
etc., all these questions and many
others depend for their wise solutions
on the services of the skilled geolo
gist, and since there is or was no
corps of geologists in the military es
tablishments of the United States, it
became necessary to organize and de
velop the personnel for such service,
and in this connection the geological
section of the Research Council was
able to render useful aid.
The sections of botany and agri
culture, and forestry co-operated pri
marily in connection with problems in
volving food supply, medicines and
drugs, timber and forest products and
generally in matters relating to the
great problems of organic raw mate
rials.
The section of medicine co-operated 1
with the army and navy medical serv-i
ices in the study of drugs and drug
supply, in the study of problems of
drugs and drug supply, in the study
of problems of sanitation, in the
study of epidemics and special war
diseases, in the problem of protection

-1 against gas poisoning, in the study of
special diseases resulting from indus
trial operations involved in the man
ufacture of war munitions, particular
ly certain explosives, such as trinitro
toluol, and broadly over the field cov
ering war medicines and surgery and
its related problems.
The section of psychology developed
one of the largest and most active or
ganizations among those co-operating
along scientific lines in the study of
war problems. The activities of this
section fell under three general heads:
(1) The examination and testing of
personnel regarding fitness for special
forms of service, such as aviation,
gun pointing, look-out service, etc.
(2) The development of suitable
tests for classifying all candidates for
officers' commissions according to in
telligence, aptitude for command, etc.
I The latter development represented a
I marked contribution to the problem of
the training and selection of personnel
for officers' commissions.
(3) The development of a series of
tests somewhat similar in character
to the Binet tests, and intended for
application to all personnel of the
army with a view of detecting those
markedly below the average in intelli
gence as well as those markedly
above, and thus presumptive material
for advancement.
Referring in the same brief manner
to some of the special committees, the
Committee on the Submarine co-oper
ated with officers of the Navy Depart
ment in the organization and develop
ment of the great submarine research
laboratory at New London, and con
tinued through 112 visits to keep
in close contact with this impo»va..t
field of work. Practically all the
working physicists on the staff of this
laboratory were selected through this
committee, and the entire program of
work was developed as the outgrowth
of conferences organized through its
agency for the study of this vitally im
portant problem.
The Committee on Optical Glass ad
dressed itself to a most important
problem and under most difficult con
ditions. The supply of optical glass
used in the United States previous to
the war had been drawn chiefly from
Germany, with some smaller amounts
from France. Both of these sources
of supply were now closed, Germany
for obvious reasons and France be
cause she had no more than enough
for her own needs. On the other
hand the demand was enormously in
creased. Optical glar,s was required
in hitherto unheard of quantities for
binoculars, range finders, photographic
objectives, and miscellaneous optical
requirements. The supply available
in the United States at the beginning
of 1917 was negligible in amount. Un
der these conditions the Committee
on Optical Glass undertook the study
of the problem of its production in
quantity, and in a year's time had
achieved the production of a very con
siderable fraction of the amount re
quired, and later in 1918 had still
further improved methods and facili
ties to the point where the produc
tion practically equaled the demand.
It should be noted that an undertak
ing such as this was only made pos
sible through the co-operation of vari
ous previously existing organizations
such as the United States Bureau of
Standards, the U. S. Geological Sur
vey, and two large manufacturers of
glass who placed the facilities of their
plants at the disposal of the commit
tee and co-operated in every possible
way in furthering the obejcts in view.
The Committee on Nitrates and Ni
trogen Fixation co-operated with the
interested bureaus and services in the
army and navy with reference to the
vitally important problem of the pro
duction of Nitric Acid as a factor in
the manufacture of modern explosives.
There is here Interwoven an inter
esting combination of elements, ni
trates, ammonia and nitric acid. On
the one hand, fertilization of the earth
for the improvement of crops and, on
the other, the manufacture of explo-;
sives for the destruction of human
life. The one program of manufac
ture implies more or less the other,

and for the enormous production con
templated by our military and naval
programs, it was early recognized that
recourse must be had to some form of
nitrogen fixation from the air. The
one element which is significant in
these chemical compounds is nitrogen,
a substance comprising by weight
about 77 per cent of the atmosphere.
There is, therefore, in the atmosphere
lying over the area of the United
States a weight of nitrogen represent
ed by millions and millions of tons.
Due to its chemical inertness, how
ever, it is not an easy problem to har
ness up this nitrogen with other sub
stances, particularly oxygen, and yet
just this union must be realized in or

der to keep the munition factories
going.
This, then, constituted one of the
great problems of the war —that of ni
trogen fixation. The Nitrates Commit
tee of the Research Council played an
important part in carrying forward
this great problem to a point which
in 1918 promised an adequate supply
of this all-important factor in the man
ufacture of explosives.
In an entirely different field, the
Committee on Marine Navigating In
struments undertook the task of stand
ardizing and simplifying the instru
ments required for the navigation of
the enormous auxiliary marine which
the war situation was developing, and
of devising ways and means of meet
ing the ever-increasing demand for in
struments of this character. The
chronometer, the sextant, and the com
pass, with a pair of binoculars and
some other minor instruments, form
the main reliance of the navigator;
but the number of these apparently
available in 1917 was only the smallest
fraction of the quantities foreseen for
the rapidly expanding mosquito fleet,
tor our contemplated transport serv
ice, and for the merchant marine
about to be brought into being.
Through the efforts of this commit
tee the situation was admirably met.
and through expedients and substi
tutes where needful, all ships were
supplied with the necessary equipment
of such instruments as soon as ready
otherwise.
A measure initiated by the National
Research Council in a somewhat dif
ferent direction, merits a moment's
notice. This was the organization of
the Research Information Service —a
service intended to unify and improve
the conditions affecting the exchange
of scientific and technical information
between the United States and the Al
lies in Europe.
As the war situation developed dur
ing the summer and autumn of 1917,
and especially with reference to the
work on scientific problems in the
United States, it became increasingly
apparent that there was aeeded some
better system o? interchange of infor
mation between the two sides of the
Atlantic, with reference to the study
of such problems.
Accordingly, under the direction of
the Secretaries of War and Navy, act
ing through the Council of National
Defense, the Research Council was
asked to organize such a service with
foreign offices in Paris, London and
Rome, and with a home or central of
fice in Washington.
It was to be the function of these
offices to keep closely in contact with
all important scientific work on oar
problems going on in the foreign
fields, to become acquainted with the
srientists engaged in such work, learn
their methods and the results thus far
obtained, and report on the same to
Washington. In the same manner
and in the inverse sense, reports pre
pared through the agency of the home
office in Washington and covering sim
ilarly the work in the United States,
were to be forwarded to the foreign
offices for communication to the for
eign scientists and the interested mil
itary or naval services.
It was the good fortune of the pres
ent speaker to be placed in charge
of the Paris office of the Research In
formation Service, in which position
he remained until the past winter,
following the signing of the armistice.
Speaking more especially from the
viewpoint of the work of this office, it
involved a continuous stream of re
ports back and forth between Paris
and Washington and covering all
phases of scientific work on war prob
lems. The information required in
France and representing French meth
ods and results was thus made avail
able for those in the United States en
gaged on similar problems, and to the
interested military or naval bureaus
or services, while similarly the reports
received from Washington and repre
senting the condition of the work in
the United States was made available
to the French scientists, to the in
terested sections of the French mili
tary or naval authorities, and to the
interested services of the American
Expeditionary Forces. At the same
time there was maintained an inter
change of reports between the three
foreign offices so that through the of
fice in Paris, for example, there was
flowing a stream of research and tech
nical information giving the impor
tant results of studies on war prob
lems in the four great units on the
side of the Allies, England, France,
Italy, and the United States.
In this manner the scientific work
er on a war problem in any one coun
try was kept informed at timely in
tervals of the progress on and status
of such problem in the other coun
tries and at the hands of other re

search workers. In this manner, du
plication of effort and waste human
energy and time were avoided, and the
work of each individual was made to
count in the most effective possible
manner, in co-operation with that of
all his co-workers, toward the final
goal.
It is, perhaps, well within the bounds
of truth to say that the spirit of self
elimination and of generous personal
and international co-operation thus
shown by the scientists of these four
great nations, furnishes one of the
most striking examples of unselfish co
operative work which the world has I
ever seen. Scientists are made of
clay no different from their fellows,
and under normal conditions are dis
posed to stand upon rights of priority
and discovery and to be insistent upon
a suitable recognition of their claims
to consideration in these respects.
They are, in consequence, not always
too well disposed toward the sharing
of the results of their work with their
fellows, or at least not in the initial
stages and before they are ready for
presentation as a completed problem.
When we add to this natural re
luctance on the part of individuals,
the equal reluctance, normally mani
fest, on the part of governmental au
thorities, and having its roots in the
age of old traditions of patriotism, na
tional pride, etc., it seems that little
short zl a rebirth could have brought
about the generous and helpful spirit
of international co-operation along
these lines which the last year in par
ticular of the war witnessed.
This was indeed a splendid example
of generous international cooperatio(n
toward a definite end, with no apparent
thought of self or of individual part or
merit, and with eye single to the one
goal, the winning of the war. It was
doubtless born of the spirit of exalta
tion which comes with a state of war
and which takes us out .of our usual
selves in a manner which perhaps no
other human experience can.
In sp o a!:.'iig of the service of science
in the great war, principal reference has
been made thus far to the work of the
National Research Council, its organi
zation and activities. It must not be
assumed, however, that this was the
only organization or body which fur
nished coordinated effort for the study
of war problems. Thus the Bureau of
Standards, as a great Government
laboratory, carried on a large number
of important studies and investiga
tions and rendered, in particular, most
signal scrvice in the organization and
development of a system for the test
ing and certification of the many master
gauges which are necessary in the pro
duction of war munitions by modern
factory methods. Much of this work
of the Bureau of Standards was car
ried out in affiliation with the Research
Council through membership of the
Director of the Bureau in the Council,
thus in effect constituting the Bureau
as one of the great laboratories at the
immediate disposal of the Council for
the investigation of war problems.
Again the Bureau of Mines under
took the investigation of large and im
portant war problems, notably poison
gas, nitrates and nitrogen fixation, air
plane fuels, and the separation of helium
from natural gas to take the place of
hydrogen in balloons. Likewise much
of this work was interlinked with the
Research Council through common mem
bership on the committees occupied with
this work and through the membership
of the Director of the Bureau of Mines
in the Research Council.
Likewise the National Advisory Com
mittee for Aeronautics, a body charged
by act of Congress with the study of
the scientific problems connected with
flight and the navigation of the air,
carried on extended studies in its own
field, notably researches on the air pro
peller, on qualities of air foils or lift
ing surfaces, on airplane stability, on
airplane fuels and the economy of air
place engines, on the maintenance of
power at high altitudes, on the avail
ability of metal construction for air
planes, etc. Intelligent cooperation again
between this committee and the Re
search Council was assured through the
fact that the chairman of the commit
tee and several of the members were

also members of the council.
The great engineering societies of
the country also rendered services of
great value in fields of applied sciencc
and industry. These services were real
ized in part through an engineering sec
tion of the Research Council represent
ing thees societies, and in part through
individual and other agencies. The
Naval Consulting Board also rendered
service, notably as a board for the con
sideration of new inventions along
marine and naval lines, and through
certain of its members who cooperated
with other agencies in the study of the
problem of the protection of mercan
tile shipping against submarine att' ck.
The fact will not have escaped the
critical observer, that in all of this or
ganization there is lack of a consistent
and complete design throughout. Such
indeed was the case. The organization
was a result of the existing circum
stances and was directed toward the
quickest possible realization of the ends
immediately in view—the intensive and
effective study of war problems through
any and all existing and available
agencies.
It should not be judged from the
viewpoint of an ideal organization of
scientific effort as applied to war prob
lems, but rather by its results under
the existing conditions, and from this
viewpoint of ujdgment, it may be fairly
said that science in the United States
has played her part in the great war
with conspicuous zeal and generosity of
spirit, and with a measure of success at
least reasonably commensurate with the
factors and conditions involved.
Taking for a moment a wider view
of the general subject of the service of
science in the great war, and passing
beyond the confines of the United States,
we may ask with what great war prob
lems did sciencc deal, and in its widest
international aspect what are some of
its contributions to the cause.
Any adequate answer to these ques
tions would require almost a detailed
history of the development of war mu
nitions and material throughout the four
years and more of the great struggle;
and in the few moments which can be
given, to this phase of the matter, only
a few scattered illustrations or ex
amples can be given.
Thus picking here and there some of
the notable achievements and contribu
tions of science, mention may be made of
the following:
A system of sound ranging for heavy
artillery with the necessary apparatus
for its realization and permitting enemy
guns when invisible to the eye to be
located by sound waves, both in direc
tion and distance, and with a degree
of accuracy insuring effective counter
battery operations.
Methods of secret signalling by the
use of finra-red light waves —waves in
visible to the human eye but which may
be revealed either to the eye or car
through appropriate transformation.
A method of secret signallying by the
use of ultra violet waves, normally in
visible to the human eye, but made so
through appropriate means.
Methods for the detection of hostile
airplanes at night and the development
of the apparatus for their realization,
including ingenious methods for rapidly
computing position and direction from
initial observations and plotting the
same on a chart, thus in effect securing
a continuous trace of the progress of
the distant plane through the night.
Methods for combining into one ef
ficient operating unit, the three elements
in anti-aircraft gunnery, viz, the means
of detection as above, the searchlight
for visual detection when within range,
and the anti-aircraft gun.
The entire field of aeronautics, in -
eluding airplane design and propulsion,
characteristics in the air as regards sta
bility and maneuverability, instruments
for navigation, armament and photo
graphic equipmenj—all these are ex
pressions of the intensive work of
scientists directed toward the solution
of these particular problems. It is not
too much to say that as a result of the
concentration of effort and human
energy on the problem of the airplane
during the- war, the state of air navi
gatibn is now advanced to a point be
yond what might have been anticipated

progress.
Airplane bomb dropping sights, vastly
improving the target practice possible
under the difficult conditions which pre
vail with such modes of offense.
Methods of synchronizing the opera
tion of a machine gun with the revolu
tions of the propeller in such manner
as to permit of firing the gun between
the revolving blades without danger of
shattering the blades themselves.
The development of radio telephony
between airplanes in the air or between
airplanes and the ground.
A method for reducing the air re
sistance of projectiles by surrounding
the projectile during flight with an en
velope of hot or burning gas, thus mak
ing possible an in crease in range of
some 20 per cent.
Notable improvements in the form
and balance of projectiles, resulting in
marked increase in accuracy and range.
New forms of powder for use with
long-range guns insuring a relatively
slow rate of combustion with the sus
tained production of very high pressure
within the bore of the gun.
A very large number of devices in
tended to aid in detection and location
of the submarine. All told, perhaps
some twenty to thirty devices and forms
of apparatus were developed up to a
point where definite and significant re
sults were realized. Of these a con
siderable number were installed in
chasers, destroyers and counter sub
marine craft generally, and contributed
largely to the degree of mastery over
the submarine which was realized, espe
cially in the last months of the war.
In particular among the devices for
the detection of the submarine was one
employing an under-water search beam
of high frequency sound—a beam of
sound energy held coherent instead of
scattering in all directions as with ordi
nary sound awves, and used as a search
beam, resulting in the return of a form
of echo from any foreign body encoun
tered, as for example the hull of a sub
marine boat. This form of echo could,
under goon conditions, be detected from
objects distant about one mile.
Methods of producing dense and
voluminous smoke screens about a ship
at sea, to aid in escape from submarine
attack.
An ingenious and effective device
known as a paravane and intended to
protcct ships from destruction by float
ing mines. By the autumn of 1918 all
important British, American, French
and Italian ships were supplied with
this device against danger from float
ing mines, cither stray or anchored.
The development of processes for the
extraction of helium from natural gas
for use instead of hydrogen in balloons.
Helium is non-inflammable and lacks
only about 8 per cent of the lifting ca
pacity of hydrogen. For military pur
poses the possibility of the use of helium
as a lifting agent is considered as ot
the very highest possible importance.
Great improvements in methods oi
nitrogen fixation assuring adequate
supplies for nitric acid as a factor in
the manufacture of explosives.
Poisonous gases in great diversity ot
form and effect, and gas mask protec

An important study on seaweeds as
forage for horses and indicating cer
tain forms as having nutritive value of
definite significance as a factor in the
food supply for domestic animals.
Improved methods of war surgery
insuring a high degree of protection
against gangrene and the like infections,
and marked improvements and advances
in dealing with all forms of disease
especially incident to war or to war
conditions.
A new anesthetic stimulating the
heart rather than depressing it, and
permitting of surgical operations in case
of severe loss of blood or under con
ditions of collapse which would not
permit of such operations by the use
of ether or chloroform.
These are examples only, but will
serve, perhaps, to indicate with some
degree of precision the war problems
with which scientists have been occu
pied, and the character of the contri
butions which the£ have been able to
make.
In the opening pages of this paper

reference was made to the two fields of
science, pure and applied, and to the
measurably arbitrary distinction which
is drawn between the pure scientist and
the applied scientist. During the war all
scientists were in the "applied" camp,
In a broad sense science for science
sake had few or no followers, and
every scientist was working toward a
definite end, seeking the application of
the phenomena and laws of nature to
the solution of specific war problems.
This serves to indicate how readily the
scientist may shift back and forth be
tween these two fields of work accord
ing to where the emphasis is placed, and
how arbitrary, and perhaps unnecessary,
except as a matter of convenience, the
distinction really is.
With the armistice signed and the
end of the war presumably in sight,
what of the fine spirit of international
cooperation which had been manifest
throughout the war, and to which refer
ence has already been made? It was
certainly to be most earnestly hoped that
some part, at least, of this fine spirit
might be saved and carried over into
the coming years of peace.
With these thoughts in mind, a con
ference of National Academies of
Science, representing the nations at war
with the Central Powers, was organized
and held in October last in London as
guests of the Royal Society, witli an
adjourned session in November in Paris,
as guests of the French Academy of
Science.
As a result of these conferences,
broad and comprehensive plans were
made for international cooperation in
science including (1) the organization
in each of the adhering countries of a
national research council, patterned
somewhat after that of the United
States but with such differences in de
tail as would make it responsive to
local conditions; (2) the organization
of an International Research Council to
federate for international effort the
various national councils; and (3) the
development of definite plans of or
ganization for a number of international
scientific groups or societies; thus an
international association of astronomers,
an international organization in the
group of geophysics including meteor
ology and seismology, an international
association of chemists and a like or
ganization of physiologists.
These organizations are all in contact
with the International Research Council
which thus acts as a center of all such
international scientific organizations,
and as a general rallying point for all
international effect in scientific under
takings.
Much of the detail of this broad pic
ture of international scientific coopera
tion remains yet to be filled in, but at
least it represents a beginning, and the
future will depend on how closely we
can hold to the spirit of generous inter
national cooperation which prevailed in
such high degree during the years of the
war.
We have thus, in the hour which we
have spent together, surveyed, however
inadequately, some phases of the contri
bution of science and scientists to the
supreme problem of war. War comes,
unhappily, as a great crisis in national
affairs. It swallows up all that is best
in the national life. It demands the
supreme effort of everyone capable of
serving the cause, either directly or
indirectly. Of many it demands the
supreme sacrifice of life. In the great
war, now finished, as we hope, scien
tists have done no more and, we may
hope, no less than other members of
society. Each has contributed his best
and all have joined in a supreme effort
in the common cause. And herein we
find one of the great object lessons of
the war — the seemingly impossible
achievements which may be and were
realized by the coordination of national
effort and the submergence of self in
the common cause. And if such great
achievements may be realized in war
through unselfish cooperation toward a
great national end, why may not, in the
arts of peace, equally great achieve
ments be realized—if only we might rise
to the same plane of unselfish devotion
to high national ideals which has char
acterized our common service in the
war.
