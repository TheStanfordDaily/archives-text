# ALUMNI HOLDS REUNION
## Old Guard Returns To Campus Today 
### Ellen M. Calhoun, '20 
ALUMNI DAY, that time when Stan
ford are renewed—when
old associations, and old friends bring
back a keener appreciation of what
Stanford spirit really is—proved more
successful today than ever before in
the history of the University. Over
five hundred attended the alumni
luncheon held in the Memorial Court,
the speakers of the day sitting at six
special tables which had been reserved
for their use. Stunt-flying over the
Memorial Court by the visiting avi
ators furnished the thrills for the oc
casion as they swooped up and down
over the cheering alumni. Tail spins
and daring spirals won the admiration
of the graduates of other days. Every
minute of the day has been filled with
some entertainment, from the baseball
game at 10:30 in the morning as the
opening event at the Senior-Alumni re
ception given at the presidential
mansion after the pageant, which will
close the day.
The baseball game was followed by
an annual meeting of the Alumni As
sociation at 11:30 in Room 12, at which
students who had won the scholarships
the business fo the year was discussed
and settled as far as possible. Several
recommendations and plans were formu
lated for the coming year.
One of the most important numbers
of the day's program was the luncheon
held in the Memorial Court. Dr. J. M.
Stillman explained in a general way
the purpose and general plan for the
proposed memorial to be built in honor
of those men who gave their lives in
the Great War. Many of the alumni
has never had the opportunity to hear
a full explanation of the Memorial
Campaign and it was felt that a clearer
understanding would facilitate materially
in raising the needed money for the
Memorial. Up to the present time,
Dr. Stillman announced that the sum
of $20,000 in actual cash had been
raised and that did not include any
pledges. He expressed the hope that
those alumni who has not contributed
their share to the fund would do so as
soon as possible. The Stanford Memo
rial will stand as a monument, not only
in appreciation of those men who sac
rificed their lives that others might live,
but as a monument to Stanford ideals
and to Stanford Spirit.
Announcements were made as to those
for the coming year and of several new
scholarships which had been given to
the University. The qualifications were
explained for all of the scholarships
and the work which each student had
done to earn the honor and privilege
connected with the scholarship.
Five aeroplanes entered into the stunt

flving for the day. Captain Francis Q.
Wilson. C aptain H. R. Kelly, Lieuten
ant W. L. (Dutch) Henry, '17, Lieuten
ant P. L. Williams, and Lieutenant R.
S. Worthington, 12, flew up to the
I niversity from Rockwell Field. San
Diego, and arrived 011 the campus last
1 liursday noon. Several stops were
made enroute including Los Angeles,
Bakerslield, and Fresno. All of these
men are graduates of Stanford and
through special arrangements were able
to make the trip to the north for Senior
Week.
With fitting ceremonies and speeches
the dedication of the '93 and '94 plates
will take place at 2 p.m. F. M. Mc-
Farland, '93, is in charge of the exer
cises for the '93 plate, and A. R. Cot
ton, '94, supervises the arrangements
for the '94 plate. These two plates
were the only ones which had not been
laid in the row of class plates in front
of Memorial Church for some time, and
the exercises, Saturday, completed the
history of the many classes which have
graduated from the University.
The remainder of the afternoon will
be taken up with the exercises and re
ception of the Phi Beta Kappa. The
annual open meeting will be held in
the Little Theater, at 4:30. Professor
W. F. Durand will give the address
for the meeting and the poem will In
given by Professor E. O. James of
Mills College. The exercises are to be
effective in their simplicity and in their
wonderful appropriateness to the spirit
of the day and the conclusion of the
war. The Women's Club House will
be the scene for the Phi Beta Kappa
reception, dinner, and initiation which
are to follow the meeting.
For those alumni who will not be so
honored as to be able to attend the
Phi Beta Kappa festivities in the early
evening, class reunions and dinners are
planned at which friendships can be
renewed and reminiscences indulged in.
All of these affairs have proved re
markably successful as representatives
from practically every class which has
graduated from the University have
been present. The old time rivalry be
tween classes was renewed, in part, as
jokes and fun were poked at one an
other much to the enjoyment of all
present.
The day is to close with the big event,
the English Club Pageant, "Service,"
of which more is said and in greater
detail in other columns of this edition.
The reception held by President and
Mrs. Wilbur after the pageant will
close the festivities of one of the most
successful reunions ever held 011 the
Stanford campus. Undoubtedly* it is
the hope of the student body that these
friends may soon visit the campus
again.
