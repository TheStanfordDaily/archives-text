# STANFORD-U. OF C. FOOTBALL GAME ASSURED THIS FALL
## Students Must Not Invade Campus 
### 
OROSPECTS of a Stanford-California
football game next fall were made
much brighter by the announcement that
the Stanford Board of Athletic Control
had turned the scheduling of the game
to the students through the student
manager, W. I. Ames. It is now prac
tically assured that the two rival uni
versities will meet on the gridiron next
season. Ames and the Berkeley man
ager, Lute A. Nichols, had a conference
last Monday and settled all of the minor
details connected with the resumption
of football relations. The final date has
not been decided. California starts the
college year in August, 4vhile Stanford
does not begin until October. If a game
was scheduled for November 15th, as
the California manager wished to. Stan
ford wottld be handicapped, but a game
scheduled in December would seriously
conflict with the final examinations given
at that time at Berkeley. It is hoped
that an agreement can be reached over
a date late in November or on the first
Saturday in December.
Will Have Freshman Game
Arrangements are also being made
for a resumption of freshmen football

! relations. It is probable that the Stan
| ford-California freshman football game
! will be played at Berkeley on Novem
ber 15th, while the varsity game will be
I played at Stanford at a later date.
Because of the time lost from scho
lastic duties, it is planned that the bon
j fire will not be built until one week
before the annual rally. Another mat
|
: ter that was discussed by the two ath
' letic managers was the invading of the
j rival campuses. It was agreed that no
i students from either Stanford or Cali
j fornia would invade the campus of the
opposing university. The little en
thusiasm that these invasions arouse is
not worth risking the unpleasant noto
riety that comes from the actions of
students such as that of last year.
Both the president of Stanford and
the president of the University of Cali
fornia declare that they will welcome
the return of intercollegiate football
i relations between the two institutions,
i hut that it will be a great mistake if
the students go back to the old system,
where scholastic endeavor of any serious
i where scholastic endeavor of any serious
I three weeks before the big game.
