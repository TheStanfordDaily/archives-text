# SUMMER PAPER AND STAFF
## 
### 
WITH today's edition, volume 56 of the Daily Palo Alto comes into existence.
The publishing of a Campus paper during the summer quarter lias never been ,
attempted at Stanford before, and it lias been thought best by the management to
experiment with a weekly issue at first. In the future, with an increased regis- j
(ration and an increased interest in Stanford affairs, possibly developing a certain!
amount of student activities, the paper may lie published three times a week, or;
even daily, as is done at several other universities. During the present quarter j
the student paper will be published every Friday. All undergraduate students j
will receive a copy through the mail, and others may obtain them by subscription.'
An earnest plea is made to all those of journalistic ability to contribute to the ]
Daily Palo Alto. The staff as at present is composed of the former Daily!
I'alo Alto reporters who are in the University this quarter and - number of other
students who have desired to get into the only student activity now existent on
the Campus. R. W. Kenny, '21. will retain his place as news editor. Miss Ruth I
Elsinger, '20, will be the ranking member of the reportorial staff, assisted by Miss;
Bernice Frankenheinier, '20, Richard Martinsen, '21, F. H. Carroll, '22, and
L. E. Lyon, '22, all members of last quarter's Daily staff. A. Sam Glikbarg, '19, j
and R. E. Wedekind, '19, have been added to the staff. Glikbarg is now the |
editor of the Chaparral, and readers of the Daily Palo Alto will welcome the
levity that his efforts will give the paper. Wedekind was connected with news
papers before bis entrance in college and is an able reporter.
