JJNDER the heading, "As It Was," there appeared in the Editorial Comment
of the "Illustrated Review," published last Thursday, an explanation of the j
combining of the former popular student magazine with the Stanford Alumnus
Hie editorial opposed the plan announced by. the Stanford Press Club of publish
ing a magazine next October entitled the "Students' Illustrated Review." It is
only natural that the present editors and managers of the Illustrated Review should
object to this action of the Press Club. It is true that both magazines cannot
flourish on the Campus, but if the success of a magazine depends upon the interest
that the students show in it, the magazine managed by Press Club will be the 1
most influential publication at Stanford. The members of I'ress Club are elected I
from the staffs of all the college publications, and without doubt the best journal-!
istic ability is included in tin- ranks of the organization. The new magazine will
be an open forum for student opinion, and L. W. Dinkelspiel, '20, the ed'tor-elect. |
lias announced that every student who lias capabilities along journalistic lines and
who desires to contribute, is requested to do so. Live questions of the day, such '
as freshman discipline, the dormortory rule, student control, etc., will be placed
before the students in the correct way, through the medium of their own maga
zine, controlled and censored only in so much as any Campus publication is cen-!
sored by the University administration.
I lie members of Press Club realized that a magazine full of really vital Stanford j
news, combined with topics of interest for the alumni, would be the ideal uni-1
versify publication and made an attempt to again get control of the present "Illus-i
trated Review," including the Stanford Alumnus as now combined with it. Being 1
refused this, the Club attempted to get back the "Illustrated Review" without the
alumni subscriptions, but this attempt was met only with the offer of a combina-j
tion of student and faculty editors as suggested in the editorial, "As It Was."
It is an absolute impossibility to put out a truly successful student magazine
with members of the faculty on the staff, and especially so if these members]
;<re associated with the University in an administrative way. The present Illus
trated Review is a good magazine. The alumni like it because it is so far superior
to the old Stanford Alumnus, but the students do not read it because it does not
contain the type of articles that are considered live by the Student Body. To be
sure, the editors of the Illustrated say that any student can write for the maga
zine as it now stands, but few, if any, will ever feel that a magazine edited by
members of the alumni and managed by a member of the faculty closely con
nected with the administration of the University, gives free expression of honest
student opinion, even though that opinion may differ from that of the adminis
tration.
