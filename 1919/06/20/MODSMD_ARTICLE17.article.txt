# WHEREFORE NOT: THE PHONE STRIKE
## 
### A.S. Glikbarg, '19 
Agamemnon, summon a dependable
wireless, the phone strike has struck
the campooze, and I can't say a word
to Nellie. It's a tough life, Lucius, hut
phone strikes are phone strikes, and
coming merely occasionally into the sum
mer lives of campoozes, shud he made
the most of. So I credited the dollar
thirteen it would have cost to take
Nellie to the movies, to money found,
and let it go at that. I used one thir
teen as the amount on the assumption
that Nellie would have limited her her
self to a two-bit treat at Stickies, which
is the very least one could expect from
a Co-ed.
1 urning to the more serious side of
the strike, however, many things de
mand consideration. The writer under
stands that the strikers want four dol
lars per day for a two-hour day, pro
viding they have worked for the com
pany since Fido was a dog of an ex
tremely tender age, and further pro
viding that they eat two meals a day,
sleep with both eyes closed, and don't
light with their husbands. To the
writer who has no relatives among the
strikers, and only a few scattering
friends of short acquaintance, this
doesn't seem like too much to ask. The
way it is now, the phone operatives,
who have to manipulate the campooze
shift, get a terrible end of the deal.
There's exceedingly little gossip of any
informative character that ever shoots
over the wires. No scandals, no black
mails, no embryonic riots, nothing that
can possibly get the attentive operator
into print. So the writer thinks that a
few extra sheckles dropped into the laps
of tiie campooze operators would hardly
be amiss. (There is an extra tine op
portunity for a pun on the word
"amiss," but the writer wouldn't be so
low as to spring it.) The last time the
writer took a journey with a phone girl,
she only had about six- dollars to throw
in, as her share of the expenditures.
That is far from enough. The only
solution is additional wages. And
while I am on the point, [ really think
that no night duty and three days ofT
a week would not be too much to ask.
To sum up, the operatives who are suf
fered onto the campooze exchange shud
be given more money, shorter hours,
longer lunch hours, more lunch, less
work, and shudn't be forced to work
during the summer. Furthermore, they
shud have a Sabbatical leave. Professors
have sabbatical leaves, and I don't see.
where a prof, has anything on an op
erative. and if lie has he ought to be
man enough to keep it to himself.
Another aspect of the strike is of great
importance, and that is this: In the
good old days when poker, tubbing,
dancing, drinking, and smoking were
not prohibited by either state, national,
international, or university regulations,
a fellow had a variety of ways in which
to spend his evenings. Last quarter,
however, when these things were
stopped, the only thing to do was to
ring up long distance and talk to the
first Portia-voiced damsel who said,
"Hello". It was really the only way to
spend the evening without having to
spend a cent. Of course one could
study if he chose, but you know what
that means. Profs, spent their lives
studying and now look at them. So that
is the final argument for an immediate
settlement of the whole proposition. Let
the rich, robbing, cheating, grafting, cut
throat corporotion, that has systemat
ically prosecuted and persecuted its in
nocent employees, be forced to concede
to tiieir every demand. I'm for it, and
why shudn't I be. It doesn't cost me
anything, and if it ever starts to I'll
take up Bolshevism. They can't fool
me. . . .

teen as the amount on the assumption
that Nellie would have limited her her
self to a two-bit treat at Stickies, which
is the very least one could expect from
a Co-ed.
1 urning to the more serious side of
the strike, however, many things de
mand consideration. The writer under
stands that the strikers want four dol
lars per day for a two-hour day, pro
viding they have worked for the com
pany since Fido was a dog of an ex
tremely tender age, and further pro
viding that they eat two meals a day,
sleep with both eyes closed, and don't
light with their husbands. To the
writer who has no relatives among the
strikers, and only a few scattering
friends of short acquaintance, this
doesn't seem like too much to ask. The
way it is now, the phone operatives,
who have to manipulate the campooze
shift, get a terrible end of the deal.
There's exceedingly little gossip of any
informative character that ever shoots
over the wires. No scandals, no black
mails, no embryonic riots, nothing that
can possibly get the attentive operator
into print. So the writer thinks that a
few extra sheckles dropped into the laps
of tiie campooze operators would hardly
be amiss. (There is an extra tine op
portunity for a pun on the word
"amiss," but the writer wouldn't be so
low as to spring it.) The last time the
writer took a journey with a phone girl,
she only had about six- dollars to throw
in, as her share of the expenditures.
That is far from enough. The only
solution is additional wages. And
while I am on the point, [ really think
that no night duty and three days ofT
a week would not be too much to ask.
To sum up, the operatives who are suf
fered onto the campooze exchange shud
be given more money, shorter hours,
longer lunch hours, more lunch, less
work, and shudn't be forced to work
during the summer. Furthermore, they
shud have a Sabbatical leave. Professors
have sabbatical leaves, and I don't see.

Another aspect of the strike is of great
importance, and that is this: In the
good old days when poker, tubbing,
dancing, drinking, and smoking were
not prohibited by either state, national,
international, or university regulations,
a fellow had a variety of ways in which
to spend his evenings. Last quarter,
however, when these things were
stopped, the only thing to do was to
ring up long distance and talk to the
first Portia-voiced damsel who said,
"Hello". It was really the only way to
spend the evening without having to
spend a cent. Of course one could
study if he chose, but you know what
that means. Profs, spent their lives
studying and now look at them. So that
is the final argument for an immediate
settlement of the whole proposition. Let
the rich, robbing, cheating, grafting, cut
throat corporotion, that has systemat
ically prosecuted and persecuted its in
nocent employees, be forced to concede
to tiieir every demand. I'm for it, and
why shudn't I be. It doesn't cost me
anything, and if it ever starts to I'll
take up Bolshevism. They can't fool
me. . . .
Agamemnon, summon a dependable
wireless, the phone strike has struck
the campooze, and I can't say a word
to Nellie. It's a tough life, Lucius, hut
phone strikes are phone strikes, and

the most of. So I credited the dollar
