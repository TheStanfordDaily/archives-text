# Commencement D.P.A. Now at Bookstore
## 
### 
Copies of the commencement editior.
of the Daily Palo Alto are now on
sale at the Stanford Bookstore, and
can be purchased there for twenty
five cents. Those holding receipts for
a copy may redeem them l>y present
ing them at the Bookstore.
Copies were mailed to those who
left their addresses with the editors
of the commencement number, but
through a misunderstanding many did
not leave their addresses, and as a
result received no copy. These may
now get their copies at the Book
store.
The commencement address of Dr.
Paul Shorey of the University of Chi

cago. was not included in the com
mencement edition, due to the fact
that the address was extemporaneous.
