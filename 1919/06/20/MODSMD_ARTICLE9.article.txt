# DR. LYNN WHITE TALKS UPON 'RELIGION AND THE WAR'
## IS FIGHTING CHAPLAIN First of Lecture Series Upon "The New Age" is Given Thursday 
### 
«W AR ,las sllown us that this is till
age of the .spirit as few ages have
been,' and the questions that interest
and puzzle man most today are theo
logical," said Dr. Lynn T. White of San
Rafael in his talk upon "Religion and the
War in the Little Theater last night.
Dr. White has hut recently returned
from eighteen months' service in France,
during which time he spent eight
months at the front. He was awarded
the C roix de Guerre for bravery in ac
tion.
Dr. White said that his first impression
of the part religion has played in the
war is that there is a very genuine re
vival of interest in theology, and that
the old cry of not teaching theology has
been definitely crushed, and that Un
realities with which theology is con
cerned are the most interesting to-day.
"We will be alive 50,000 years from to
night if we have given our lives to God
as some of our soldiers have laid their
lives upon the altar of liberty," he said
"What is faith?" asked Dr. White
Why d'dn't God stop the war sooner
than he did? We are in danger of losing
our perspective, tor this is not the onh
war—it is only one of one hundred wars.
Man's whole story is one long tale of
blood. Can we face these facts and still
have faith? Unless we see back of his
tory the prone figure of Christ in the
garden, the tortured figure of Christ
upon the ( ross, and the glorified figure
of Christ in the Resurrection we can
have no faith. Wherever there is a cru
Cilixion there is :i ri'siirrcrtion "
Dr. White went on to discuss the
part we must play in t);e enlarging con
ceptions of Christian service. "The
war was ■ ' tight for fundamental Chris
tian principles. Is our church uphold
ing these principles?" he asked. Dr.
White said that the greatest religious
task is the saving of the soul of Ger
many, and that in the victories of free
dom there is no place of revenge. "1
come back with a sense of overwhelm
ing obligation to the men who died for
me and for you—are we good enough,
patient enough, deserving enough to
save the soul of Germany and make
sure that the sufferings of our soldiers
shall not have been in vain?"
Dr. White's lecture was the first of a
series of eight to be given by the Stan
ford Y. M. C. A. throughout the sum
mer.
