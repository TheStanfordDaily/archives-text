# DR. LYNN WHITE TALKS UPON 'RELIGION AND THE WAR'
## IS FIGHTING CHAPLAIN First of Lecture Series Upon "The New Age" is Given Thursday 
### 
«W AR ,las sllown us that this is till
age of the .spirit as few ages have
been,' and the questions that interest
and puzzle man most today are theo
logical," said Dr. Lynn T. White of San
Rafael in his talk upon "Religion and the
War in the Little Theater last night.
Dr. White has hut recently returned
from eighteen months' service in France,
during which time he spent eight
months at the front. He was awarded
the C roix de Guerre for bravery in ac
tion.
Dr. White said that his first impression
of the part religion has played in the
war is that there is a very genuine re
vival of interest in theology, and that
the old cry of not teaching theology has
been definitely crushed, and that Un
realities with which theology is con
cerned are the most interesting to-day.
"We will be alive 50,000 years from to
night if we have given our lives to God
as some of our soldiers have laid their
lives upon the altar of liberty," he said
"What is faith?" asked Dr. White
Why d'dn't God stop the war sooner
than he did? We are in danger of losing
our perspective, tor this is not the onh
war—it is only one of one hundred wars.
Man's whole story is one long tale of
blood. Can we face these facts and still
have faith? Unless we see back of his
tory the prone figure of Christ in the
garden, the tortured figure of Christ
upon the ( ross, and the glorified figure
of Christ in the Resurrection we can
have no faith. Wherever there is a cru
Cilixion there is :i ri'siirrcrtion "
