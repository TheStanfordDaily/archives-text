Professor P. J. Treat of the 'story
Department lectured yesterday >lng
in the Little Theater on "Chr. 1 > 'y
and the Problems of the Orient
following problems were tain "i'
Labor and industrial proMeui t ha'
vexed the East; growth of fictoo sys
tem; the social problems touching m:
position of women in the East; the
political problems with the coming of
democracy in the East and Eastern in
ternational relations.
Professor Treat stated that the same
problems are being met with in the
East as are being met with in the
West, and that the only way to • ■ °
with them is through the milium '112
the Bible, with criticism, i" 1 ?.
and application of Christian print., s.
The West has not been able to solve
her problems, and surely the East cau
not be expected to sol'e hers without
a western example.
"Japan has been unoer the criticism
that she has dealt witu China more in
accordance with the old spirit than
with that of the age,' is one
of Professor Treat's remarks. He
further goes on to discuss the "eligious

problems of the missionaries. "Mis
sionaries," he said, "when handling
the Oriental faiths should study them
and build upon them for the better
teaching of the Christian faith."
In connection with the missionaries
in the East, Mr. Treat noted that a
church union was being formed.
These universal human problems
tht are to be met throughout the
world and whose problems are not lim
ited to the Eastern field," continued
Dr. Treat, "must find their solution
through the medium of the Bible."
This lecture of Prof. Treat was the
second of a series of lectures given
under the auspices of the Y. M. C. A.
Professor Treat is recognized as an
authority upon the subject relating to
the Orient, having spent much time

existing conditions. A survey of the
influence of western civilization and
Christian missions upon them and the
influence of foreign education upon
the development of leadership in re
spect to new republics was included
in Professor Treat's study of the
Orient.
