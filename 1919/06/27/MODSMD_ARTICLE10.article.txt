# Prof. E. Greenlaw Lectures Tuesday
## "Some National Ideals in English Literature" is Subject of Talk 
### 
"English literature is perhaps more
representative of national thought
than any other literature," said Pro
fessor Edwin Greenlaw, visiting pro
fessor of English at Stanford from
the University of North Carolina, in
his lecture upon "Some National Ideals
in English Literature," in the Little
Theater Tuesday night. Professor
Greenlaw spoke of the relation of our
literature upon American life and
thought at the present time, when the
end of the war presages a new age.
Professor Greenlaw said that we
need the gift of historical imagination
in life today more than ever before,
now that the smoke of the guns has
cleared away. To some, the end of
the war is a period of reaction and
disillusionment, and this is manifested
the growing apathy of American men
and women toward the peace con
ference. Is this the end of our en
thusiasm? Is America to fail in her
part of interpreting the heart of the
world, to fail to make certain this
last and greatest effort of the human
spirit—to make the world safe for
democracy?
"In our literature are imbedded the
great ideals of freedom, and we shall
be guarded against tyranny by this
great tradition of our literature. The
poet's song does not only inspire, but
gives expression to our idealism. The
document upon which all free govern
ments are founded, the charters, the
constitutions and such instruments
the words of Shelley, 'Poets are the
unacknowledged legislators of the
world."
Professor Greenlaw went on to trace
the three great ideas found in litera-
ture and quoted from many of the
great men of English and American
literature, including Thomas Gray,
Crabbe, Burns. Milton, Carlyle, Moore,
Spencer, Marlowe, Bacon, and Burke.
These three ideas are: first, the stress
on liberty as the birthright of the in
dividual. freedom of thought included
in this freedom; second, the idea of
a free government, of a liberty lield in
check by government; and. third, the
idea of experiment—which has devel
oped free government in England and
America through successive steps. In
conclusion. Professor Greenlaw turned
to American prose ana verse as con
taining these three ideas, which are
dominant notes in the nationalism of
our literature. "Walt VVitman visioned
more clearly than any other the fu
ture of democracy. He believed in in
dividualism. but the fusion of the in
dividual with American totality." He
applied this idea to the world, and
said that democracy is not final, but is
endlessly adapting itself to new con
ditions.
