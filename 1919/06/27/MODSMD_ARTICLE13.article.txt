# CALIFORNIA FACULTY TO DECIDE FATE OF BIG GAME
## DECISION NEXT WEEK Professors Oppose Athletics That Detract Students From Their Work 
### 
Hopes of the Stanford and Cali
fornia student bodies for a revival of
the annual big game, under the Ameri
can football standard, have been
shaken in the past week. From an
apparent certainty, the scheduling of
the game now seems possible, but
very uncertain. The University of Cal
ifornia made out its complete football
schedule before Stanford agreed to re
urn to the American game. Now Stan
ford has scheduled games with Ore
gon State, Oregon Aggies, the Uni
versity of Southern California, Santa
Clara, and tentatively with Washing
ton State, leaving but two open dates
lor the California contest.
November 15th is held open by both
institutions, but this date is practi
cally impossible for Stanford to play
on. The fall quarter does not begin
until October Ist, and the Cardinal
eleven could not be in good enough
shape to meet the experienced Cali
fornia team in six weeks. A date early
in December would best suit Coach
Evans, but the final examinations at
the University of California take place
during the middle of December, and if
the old big game conditions are again
existent, the Berkeley faculty is
strongly against the scheduling of the
game in December, for under the old
system of rally bonfires in the process
of building for three weeks, invasions
of the rival campuses, and all night
guarding parties at the Big "C," prac
tical university work was an impos
sibility for three weeks prior to the
big game.
Student Manager Ames at Stanford
and Nichols at Berkeley are hoping
(Continued from page 1)
that the agreement they made last week
forbidding these excesss on the part of
undergraduates at both colleges will
affect the California faculty in de
cision. say students
ot v universities will think of
the California-Stanford contest not so
much as the Big Game, for which all
should be sacrificed, but as one of the
Conference games, there wwll be lesg
