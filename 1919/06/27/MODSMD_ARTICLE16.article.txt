# A 						DIFFERENT ATHLETIC CONCEPTION
## 
### 
'FHE news that the scheduling of a Stanford-California football game rests
upon the decision of the University of California faculty, and that the
faculty may not be in favor of the contest as decided upon for a date early in
December is disconcerting to the followers of intercollegiate athletics both in
and out of the universities. The Berkeley faculty can not be criticised, how
ever, for its attitude. If it refuses to sanction the game scheduled on the only
possible date, which happens to fall within two weeks of the University of
California final examinations, the students, and not the faculty, must be blamed.
The modern conception of college athletics is the cause of the whole trouble.
Neither enthusiastic university students nor those outside of the colleges who
are interested have the right idea as regards intercollegiate contests. In the
past everything has been sacrificed for the Rig Game. Ihe whole freshman class
has spent hours building a bonfire, spent nights guarding it, spent days touring
the vicinity of the rival university in hopes of doing something to demonstrate
the "real college enthusiasm'', and the faculty has come to the logical conclusion
that a football game scheduWd within three weeks of examination would mean
disaster to the attending students.
Everyone agrees that both Stanford and California need the resumption of
intercollegiate football relations between them, but the emphasis on the Big
Game should be lessened to a considerable degree. Athletic enthusiasts should
get the broader conception of college athletics. As they say in the East, "They
should get the Conference Conception". Neither Stanford nor California play
football, baseball or anything else just to meet one opponent in a Big Game. We
have athletics for the good that it does the individual, for the spirit of team
work that it inspires in its participants, and for the general wide-awake attitude
that it gives the student bodies. The game with Oregon, Washington, and other
universities should have a prominence, if not equal, relatively so, with the Cali
fornia contest. When the students take a saner view of intercollegiate athletics,
the faculties will be much more apt to sanction games at any time of the year,
never thinking of a conflicting with examinations, or any other work that the
students are naturally expectiil do.
