# WHEREFORE NOT: A LEAGUE OF PROFS.
## 
### A.S. Glikbarg 
Pilander, study your lessons or
you'll flunk out of college, because
if my plan goes through we're going
to have a league of professors. The
papers have had a lot of talk recently
about a League of Nations or some
thing. Right now there are baseball
leagues, big leaguers, bush leaguers,
and our old friend, "half a league on
ward." Professors being enthusiastic,
radical ducks, ought to form a league
of their own. It would open un
dreamed-of fields for the very essen
tial torture of unsuspecting student
bodies. No definite constitution would
j be necessary, merely a sort "of a pro-
I L'essional agreement, with a set of by
: laws. On second thought that's not
a good idea, because with the rapidly
approaching thirst, 1 mean first, of
July, buy laws will be unnecessary, as
it were; and as for a good constitu
tion —well, professors have staggered
along individually wi'h poor constitu
tions, and I guess they can do it col
lectively.
The pupose of the league would be
two fold —first, to protect the pro
fessors from being looked down upon,
and, secondly, to prevent them from
fighting among themselves. In the
present situation, professors aren't too
greatly respected. Of course they pos
sess their useful traits. They under
stand geometry or agriculture or an
tiques, and some of them know a few
• fairly good stories. However, to leave
j the theory of the thing, the big fact
I remains that in the scale of the earth's
j things, a professor can't rate a whole
J lot higher than a caterpillar. This
| moans the caterpillar before he be
comes a butterfly. The League could
I set about to raise the impression of
the average professor. The objections
to the professor could be done away
with by curing the causes. Glasses
! could be done away with. This would
; be a big step, and the league could
; enforce the proposition by remaining
fast together. I assume a whole lot
when I use the word "fast" in regard
to this species. Next, in place of the
classes, beer could be served in the
afternoon at the Prof's house, where
the students could get together, shoot
craps, play the piano, sing songs, and
throw rocks at passing pedestrians.
The Profs could come dressed in
tights and could be distinguished ac
cording to their departments. For in
stance, an Econ Prof could wear a set
of dark green tights covered with mar
ginal utility and bordered with photo
graphs of Adam Smith. The Law
Profs could wear a more fashionable
creation, something demonstrative of
the spirit of justice, like a piece of
tripe or a bowl of noodle soup. This
scheme could be generally carried into
effect and in a week or two would be
come a tradition. We've made tradi
tions around here quicker than that.
Can't you imagine some staid Geology
Prof, for instance, strutting around
in a dark gray suit of tights, like
a chorus girl, and decorated with
mountains and other geological phe
|nomena. "Phenomena" is the word, is
lit not, Philander? I flunked the only
! course I ever took in the Geology De
partment, and can't say with any de
j gree of accuracy. These revisions in
! the ordinary and usual life, habits, and
t mannerisms of the Prof would un
doubtedly tenrl to raise the impression
that, the average student has of him,
j and would beyond all doubt tenrl to
keep him in the public gaze. Of course
ia few of them might be putin jail, and
j maybe some of them would be ex
ported, but how the jailing or exporta
tion of a Prof could at all effect the
irresponsible life of a student is very
hard to determine at a glance. And
furthermore, the league could come in
here and demand the rights of profes
sors to garb thmselves as they will.
Savages wont around with less clothes
than tights, and where has a savage
anything on a professor—except in the
matter of intellect, looks, and interest?
The greatest use of the league, how
ever. would be to keep the professors
from fighting among themselves. The
present situation is intolerable and calls
for an immediate alleviation. The prcs
cnt fist fights, brawls, and drunken riots,
occasioned by professors, as the result l
of their nightly excursions' to Heltra
mo's. and Redwood could he stopped

by the league. Only the other day I
heard two profs fighting and tearing
rents in all oratorical surroundings,
over the all-absorbing question of
whether or not. Achilles was a French
man ; and whether Shakespeare really
wrote Shakespeare's plays, or was it
some one else by the same name that
wrote them. This fighting should stop
at once. It lowers the general reputa
tion and standing of tlie institution, and
makes a gent ashamed to speak of this
glorious milestone of democracy as the
cradle of education. It is enough to
call a place a cradle without speaking
of it as a cradle of anything in particu
lar. Under the mass of above evidence
I fail to see a single reason against the
league. It shud be put into force im
mediately, and kept in active force in
spite of all protestation. The only way
to accomplish good is to surmount ob
stacles, and if a professor proves to lie
the obstacle; well, he can rest assured
that other professors have been ob
stacles before him. And if the league
is put into effect, it will do good and
good only, will do harm to no one, and
will occasion ridicule upon no one. This
of course excludes the prof, who might
be slightly ridiculed but as far as that
is concerned—Oh well!

The greatest use of the league, how

heard two profs fighting and tearing
rents in all oratorical surroundings,
over the all-absorbing question of
whether or not. Achilles was a French
man ; and whether Shakespeare really
wrote Shakespeare's plays, or was it
some one else by the same name that
wrote them. This fighting should stop
at once. It lowers the general reputa
tion and standing of tlie institution, and
makes a gent ashamed to speak of this
glorious milestone of democracy as the
cradle of education. It is enough to
call a place a cradle without speaking
of it as a cradle of anything in particu
lar. Under the mass of above evidence
I fail to see a single reason against the
league. It shud be put into force im
mediately, and kept in active force in
spite of all protestation. The only way
to accomplish good is to surmount ob
stacles, and if a professor proves to lie
the obstacle; well, he can rest assured
that other professors have been ob
stacles before him. And if the league
is put into effect, it will do good and
good only, will do harm to no one, and
will occasion ridicule upon no one. This
of course excludes the prof, who might
be slightly ridiculed but as far as that
is concerned—Oh well!
Pilander, study your lessons or
you'll flunk out of college, because
if my plan goes through we're going
to have a league of professors. The
papers have had a lot of talk recently
about a League of Nations or some
thing. Right now there are baseball
leagues, big leaguers, bush leaguers,
and our old friend, "half a league on
ward." Professors being enthusiastic,
radical ducks, ought to form a league
of their own. It would open un
dreamed-of fields for the very essen
tial torture of unsuspecting student
bodies. No definite constitution would
j be necessary, merely a sort "of a pro-
I L'essional agreement, with a set of by
: laws. On second thought that's not
a good idea, because with the rapidly
approaching thirst, 1 mean first, of
July, buy laws will be unnecessary, as
it were; and as for a good constitu
tion —well, professors have staggered
along individually wi'h poor constitu
tions, and I guess they can do it col
lectively.
The pupose of the league would be
two fold —first, to protect the pro
fessors from being looked down upon,
and, secondly, to prevent them from
fighting among themselves. In the
present situation, professors aren't too
greatly respected. Of course they pos
sess their useful traits. They under
stand geometry or agriculture or an
tiques, and some of them know a few
• fairly good stories. However, to leave
j the theory of the thing, the big fact
I remains that in the scale of the earth's
j things, a professor can't rate a whole
J lot higher than a caterpillar. This
| moans the caterpillar before he be
comes a butterfly. The League could
I set about to raise the impression of
the average professor. The objections
to the professor could be done away
with by curing the causes. Glasses
! could be done away with. This would
; be a big step, and the league could
; enforce the proposition by remaining
fast together. I assume a whole lot
when I use the word "fast" in regard
to this species. Next, in place of the
classes, beer could be served in the
afternoon at the Prof's house, where
the students could get together, shoot
craps, play the piano, sing songs, and
throw rocks at passing pedestrians.
The Profs could come dressed in
tights and could be distinguished ac
cording to their departments. For in
stance, an Econ Prof could wear a set
of dark green tights covered with mar
ginal utility and bordered with photo
graphs of Adam Smith. The Law
Profs could wear a more fashionable
creation, something demonstrative of
the spirit of justice, like a piece of
tripe or a bowl of noodle soup. This
scheme could be generally carried into
effect and in a week or two would be
come a tradition. We've made tradi
tions around here quicker than that.
Can't you imagine some staid Geology
Prof, for instance, strutting around
in a dark gray suit of tights, like
a chorus girl, and decorated with
mountains and other geological phe
|nomena. "Phenomena" is the word, is
lit not, Philander? I flunked the only

along individually wi'h poor constitu
tions, and I guess they can do it col
lectively.
The pupose of the league would be
two fold —first, to protect the pro
fessors from being looked down upon,
and, secondly, to prevent them from
fighting among themselves. In the
present situation, professors aren't too
greatly respected. Of course they pos
sess their useful traits. They under
stand geometry or agriculture or an
tiques, and some of them know a few
• fairly good stories. However, to leave
j the theory of the thing, the big fact
I remains that in the scale of the earth's
j things, a professor can't rate a whole
J lot higher than a caterpillar. This
| moans the caterpillar before he be
comes a butterfly. The League could
I set about to raise the impression of
the average professor. The objections
to the professor could be done away
with by curing the causes. Glasses
! could be done away with. This would
; be a big step, and the league could
; enforce the proposition by remaining
fast together. I assume a whole lot
when I use the word "fast" in regard
to this species. Next, in place of the
classes, beer could be served in the
afternoon at the Prof's house, where
the students could get together, shoot
craps, play the piano, sing songs, and
throw rocks at passing pedestrians.
The Profs could come dressed in
tights and could be distinguished ac
cording to their departments. For in
stance, an Econ Prof could wear a set
of dark green tights covered with mar
ginal utility and bordered with photo
graphs of Adam Smith. The Law
Profs could wear a more fashionable
creation, something demonstrative of
the spirit of justice, like a piece of
tripe or a bowl of noodle soup. This
scheme could be generally carried into
effect and in a week or two would be
come a tradition. We've made tradi
tions around here quicker than that.
Can't you imagine some staid Geology
Prof, for instance, strutting around
in a dark gray suit of tights, like
a chorus girl, and decorated with
mountains and other geological phe
|nomena. "Phenomena" is the word, is
lit not, Philander? I flunked the only
! course I ever took in the Geology De
partment, and can't say with any de
j gree of accuracy. These revisions in
! the ordinary and usual life, habits, and
t mannerisms of the Prof would un
doubtedly tenrl to raise the impression
that, the average student has of him,
j and would beyond all doubt tenrl to
keep him in the public gaze. Of course
ia few of them might be putin jail, and
j maybe some of them would be ex
ported, but how the jailing or exporta
tion of a Prof could at all effect the
irresponsible life of a student is very
hard to determine at a glance. And
furthermore, the league could come in
here and demand the rights of profes
sors to garb thmselves as they will.
Savages wont around with less clothes
than tights, and where has a savage
anything on a professor—except in the
matter of intellect, looks, and interest?
The greatest use of the league, how
ever. would be to keep the professors
from fighting among themselves. The
present situation is intolerable and calls
for an immediate alleviation. The prcs
cnt fist fights, brawls, and drunken riots,
occasioned by professors, as the result l
of their nightly excursions' to Heltra
mo's. and Redwood could he stopped

by the league. Only the other day I
heard two profs fighting and tearing
rents in all oratorical surroundings,
over the all-absorbing question of
whether or not. Achilles was a French
man ; and whether Shakespeare really
wrote Shakespeare's plays, or was it
some one else by the same name that
wrote them. This fighting should stop
at once. It lowers the general reputa
tion and standing of tlie institution, and
makes a gent ashamed to speak of this
glorious milestone of democracy as the
cradle of education. It is enough to
call a place a cradle without speaking
of it as a cradle of anything in particu
lar. Under the mass of above evidence
I fail to see a single reason against the
league. It shud be put into force im
mediately, and kept in active force in
spite of all protestation. The only way
to accomplish good is to surmount ob
stacles, and if a professor proves to lie
the obstacle; well, he can rest assured
that other professors have been ob
stacles before him. And if the league
is put into effect, it will do good and
good only, will do harm to no one, and
will occasion ridicule upon no one. This
of course excludes the prof, who might
be slightly ridiculed but as far as that
is concerned—Oh well!
