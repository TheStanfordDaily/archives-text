# HAROLD AUPPERLE DIES IN SERBIA
## Epidemic Takes Away Former Track Captain and Writer 
### 
The news of the death of Harold Vin
cent Aupperle, '17, comes as a great
surprise to his many friends at Stan
ford. It is another of the sad inci
dents of the Great War. "Aup," as
he was known on the campus, went to
France with the Second Stanford Am
bulance Unit and served with it both
on the western and Balkan fronts.
Being unable to get into either the
American or French armies in a com
batant unit, owing to heart trouble
caused by excessive Athletics while in
college, Aupperle returned to Serbia,
where he served as a captain in the
American Red Cross. After the con
clusion of the war, he remained in the
Balkans, making a detailed study of
the conditions there. His strength
had been sorely in the days of stress,
and he was unable to rally after a
long illness. He died recently at Bel
grade.
While in Stanford, Aupperle was an
Economics student, standing high in
the department. He was captain of
the Stanford track team, running the
distances. In 1916, Aupperle acted as
secretary to Dr. David Starr Jordan,
when Dr. Jordan was engaged in a
speaking tour in a campaign for In
ternational Conciliation. Aupperle
was a member of Phi Gamma Delta.
