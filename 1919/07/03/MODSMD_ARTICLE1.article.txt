# "ILLUSTRATED REVIEW" WILL BE RETURNED TO PRESS CLUB
## Magazine Tangle is Now Settled 
### 
DTANFORD students and alumni will
have a magazine to be proud of
next quarter, if the plans agreed to
by the present staff of the Stanford
Illustrated Review and the Stanford
Press Club are carried out, as every
thing indicates that they will be.
Although all arrangements have not
been completed for the transfer of
the magazine, it seems definitely as
sured that the Illustrated Repiew will
be returned again to the students in
time for the first issue in October.
Not only will the magazine again be
in the hands of the Press Club, rep
resenting the students, but the present
combination with the Stanford Alum
nus will be successfully continued.
The original Stanford Illustrated Re
view was owned and edited by indi
vidual students, members of Press
Club, and later the magazine was
published by the Press Club. When
the war interfered with the work of |
the editors, the magazine was
temporarily combined with the Stan
ford Alumnus, the publication of
Alumni Association. During the war,
the combined magazine was issued
regularly under trying circumstances,
and was a connecting link with the
University for the hundreds of Stan
ford men and women in the service.
Students Need Open Magazine
When the University resumed its
normal condition again, it was clearly
seen that the magazine was too close
ly associated with the administration

of the University to be a real student
organ, and apparently being unable
to again get control of the Illustrated
Review, the Press Club had determin
ed to publish a Student's Illustrated
Review next quarter.
The new arrangement is far more
satisfactory for all concerned. The
Illustrated Review will go back to
its original owners, the Press Club,
but will receive the added alumni
support, and have an increased field
for influence, by having the old Stan
ford Alumnus combined with it. Ac
cording to the present plans there will
be two editors, one elected by the
Press Club, and one by the Alumni
Association. The Alumni editor will
select a board of three members of
the Alumni to assist in the publishing
of the section of the magazine reserv
ed for articles and news that will be
of especial interest to the alumni.
The Press Club will elect three of its
members to assist the student editor
in deciding the various questions that
will naturally come up as regards the
part of the magazine set aside exclu
sively for topics of student interest.
Members of the University faculty
will not be included in the alumni
staff of the magazine, thus assuring
the students that the editors are ab
solutely free in the expression of their
opinions. The Press Club will elect
a manager and an assistant manager
to handle the advertising in the maga
zine, and the circulation.
Dinkelspiel to Be Student Editor
Although the final arrangements
have not. been made, it is practically
certain that L. W. Dinkelspiel, '20,
who was ejected by Press Club to edit,
the Student's Illustrated Review, if
that magazine appeared on the camp
us, will be the student editor of the
Illustrated Review, and that the pres
ent Illustrated Review editor. Mrs.
Carol Green Wilson, will be the
Alumni editor. M. L. Levy, '19, Nell
H. Petree, '19, and H. G. Swendson.
'20, will probably be the Press Club
board of editors, while M. L. Sarnif.
'20, and J. E. Thrash. '21, will be tb<*
Press Club selection for managers.
