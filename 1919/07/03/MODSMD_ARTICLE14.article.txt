pVE\V Stanford students have been given the opportunity for constructive work
- which will help the University that the members of the Stanford Press Club
now have. When the Press Club published the original Illustrated Review,
it was an excellent magazine, an open forum for free expression of student
opinion, and received favorable comment from all sides, but it lacked one thing:
the support of the alumni. This support was not given the old Illustrated because
there was little in the magazine as then published to interest the alumni. From
this extreme the present combination of the Illustrated Review and the Stanford
Alumnus, under alumni editorship and more or less administration management,
turned from the students to the alumni. It has been an excellent alumni publica
tion, one of the best in the United States, and has been praised by nearly every
member of the Stanford Alumni Association. However, the magazine has lost
every semblance of a student publication and has been read but little by the
present Stanford student body.
The announcement that the Press Club is to again take over the Illustrated
and publish it, combined with the old Stanford Alumnus, under a joint student
and alumni editorship and student management is very gratifying. The magazine
will now have both student and alumni support and should be one of the best
university publications in America. Its opportunities are enormous. Stanford
has some splendid journalists in the ranks of its alumni, and several of these
men have already promised to contribute to the magazine. The best journalists
in the student body will always be in the Stanford Press Club, and the combined
efforts of Quad, Chaparral, Daily Palo Alto, and Sequoia editors should result
in a student publication easily exceeding anything attempted at Stanford thus far.
In the past few years Stanford has suffered because of a lack of cooperation
between the faculty and the students. The alumni has been a disinterested
party to the controversy, and when news of campus troubles has drifted to the
alumni, it has generally been distorted either way. The Illustrated Review will
bring the students and the alumni closer together, and saner judgments will be
reached by both on university questions of the day. Their combined influence
will then be stronger, and the friction that has existed at Stanford for the last
four years will probably be lessened because of a better understanding all around.
