# WHEREFORE NOT: A 'RUBAIYAT' REVIEW
## 
### A. Sam Glikbarg, '19 
"Then to the lip of that poor earthern
urn
I leaned, the secret of my life to learn,
And lip to lip, it answered, 'While you
live'"
Horatious, just what was the answer of
the oft-quoted jug to the well-known
Omar ? who, by the way, was a boy
tent-maker residing in East Smyrna or
some other far-away port. Omar made
tents for a living thereby acquiring the
name Khayyam — "Khaay" meaning
"tent, and yam meaning "maker,"
from which philologically developed the
word Yam-maker, and then.onto Jam
maker, which, however, is beside the
point, or at least not near it. The
earthen urn, having lived long /ago,
whispered a fatalistic sort of philosophy
to Omar, who, by the way, was not a
cigarette in spite of the fact that he
rode a Camel and had a wife named Fa
tima, who lived in Cairo, near the
Sphinx, with Tiger rugs, and there en
tertained La Marquise and her \good
friend Phillip Morse. Where was I?
Oh, yes. The urn, being an ancient
thing, said: "Drink, for, once dead, you
nev-aire shall return." This, that the
boy Rubaiyater handed out, was good
stuff and probably went over big with
the Smynites, who knew Omar well,
he having been raised, philosophy, fa
talism, et al., right there in the home
town. Yes, they knew Omar, all the
way from idiosyncrasy to vicissitude and
back to idiosyncrasy again. But, the
"old order changeth." Let's look at
Omar's pet remarks today.
"A book of verses underneath the
j bough." The book is bound in imported
j Morocco (made in Cleveland) and is
; paid for on the installment plan to a
group of Book-Bandits, who will move
out the bookcase in lieu of your weekly
payment of 80 centimos, early Monday
a. m. The verses are written by Edythe
I Jymes, the eratic girl poetess, who writes
egofied blank verse, which is manufac
tured out of long sentences, by means of
a pair of scissors. The "bough" is way
out of town, and is reached by an elec
tric car. As for the "wilderness" be
ing "paradise enow"— well, the wilder
ness is totally removed, its site being
used for a paper mill, where infants are
employed to bite wholes in typing paper,
thus both keeping the romance in life
and at the same time saving the wear
and tear on the machinery. "Paradise"
is not wanted, being dished up in quan
tities at all good 'nickel' odeons for 15
cents and a 2-cent war tax, 2 cents being
10 per cent of 15 cents. Even the "thou"
is a camouflaged creation of rouge with
interspersions of peroxide. As for the
"jug of wine," it is possible to be sccured
from a pig who has lost his eyesight be
cause of a congressional decree, and
who unlawfully maintains a habitat in a
back alley.
"Drink, for you know not whence you
came nor why" and, according to
Clement X. Clementyss, why shud you
be worried? Your whence is easily as
certained by an entrance into the "mys
ticisms of Myra," a book by Mr. Cle
mentyss, explaining everyone's whence
i and even elucidating on an occasional
Why. All of which leads up to this:
Omar was a backward sort of gent
living in the barbarous days of wildness,
when the pleasure-seeker strolled under
the trees with his "thou" and. soberly
turned to the lip of his earthern urn, to
sip the juice of the grape and learn
therefrom the philosophy of his life. In
his barbarous day, when people sat "star
scattered on the grass," it was a low
brow old world. How unlike the refine
ments of the moment when wilderness is
regulated by traffic cops (who get 80 a
month when the grafting is good), when
wine is forbidden to all except the clever
and when philosophy is preached by a
genus, whose sole requirement for a
seat on the Golden Stairs is a head of
long hair. Omar, old fellow, you had
some ideas that were fair, some that
were even good, and a few that were
fairly expressed, but you went to the
wrong place for your answer, found the
wrong philosophy, and didn't write in
vers libre. All of which convinces me
that 1 must report your little volume as
a unique idea, quaintly expressed in I
quatrains, that would be much improved
by the elimination of its reference to the
grape, the entrance of a society matron,!
a Spanish Dan-cer wirfi one hand on her
hip, and the other iti her hair, and the af

fixation of a new title like, "Why is our
life not different?" I shud further sug
gest vers libre, under the penographic ap
pellation of "Rudolph Kiamese."
