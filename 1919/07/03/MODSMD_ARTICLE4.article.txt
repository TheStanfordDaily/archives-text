## SPEAKER WINS AUDIENCE Northern President Says Democracy Becoming Fashion 
### 
TiECLARING that the spread of de
mocracy is the most significant
thing in political evolution today and
that in the place of nationalism we
are coming to recognize a gospel of in
ternationalism, Dr. Stephen B. L. Pen
rose, president of the Whitman Col
lege, Walla Walla, Washington, awoke
in the minds of those who heard him
speak in the Little Theater, Tuesday
evening, a realization that "there is
a limit to the application of democ
racy."
"The Limits of Democracy" was the
subject of the address, but Dr. Pen
rose confined himself more specially
to the limits of political democracy.
Definition of Democracy
He first told of his search for a suit
able definition for the term "democ
racy." His opening remarks were a
general discussion of the spread of
democracy. The speaker said that
democracy was becoming widespread.
"We see the autocracies crumbling;
we see the people everywhere demand
ing democracy," he said. "Democracy
is a fashion. Student government is
an application of democracy."

there are three general classes of
democracy—political democracy, soci
al democracy, and industrial democ
racy. He confined himself to the
limits of the first of these.
Political Democracy
Only Considered
"By political democracy is meant
that theory which asserts the right
of every adult to participate in the
settlement of public questions, where
such participation is proper," de
clared Dr. Penrose.
"What are the proper questions for
the people to participate in? There
are three kinds of questions that,
might he put. These are, simple, com
plex and emotional. Emotional ques
tions disturb the judgment The com
plex questions are hard to compre
hend. We have left the simple ques
tions and the people may well ex
press themselves on the simple ques
tions.
Assumption of Common Sense •
"Political democracy rests upon the
assumption that there is an element of
common sense in all men."
Dr. Penrose believes that President
Wilson is going beyond the limits of
democracy in the campaign for the
League of Nations that he has an
nounced he will make upon his re

turn to the United States.
In summing up. Dr. Penrose de
clared that successful democracy in
volves the employment of expert in
telligence to carry out the program of
the nation.
"Democracy by itself is impractic
able. Oligarchy is untrustworthy. The
limits of democracy, of political de
mocracy, is a representative govern
ment in which the will of national
life is directed by experts."
