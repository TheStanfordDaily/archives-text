# July Fourth to Be a Stanford Holiday
## 
### 
Stanford will observe Independence
Day tomorrow with a University holi
day. This is the only holiday which
occurs during the summer quarter.
Many of the instructors have agreed
with their classes to postpone classes
which ordinarily come on Saturday,
July 5, to next Monday, thus giving
a three-day vacation to many students.
All the law department Saturday
classes have been postponed until
next week.
