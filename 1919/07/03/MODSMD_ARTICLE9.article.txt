# NEXT SUMMER DANCE COMES ON JULY 18
## 
### 
Forty-five couples enjoyed the first
summer dance of the quarter, given
at the Delta Tau Delta house last
Friday night. Louis McDermott,
Wheeler Thayer, and Neil Petree were
in charge of the arrangements, and
gave a dance that was acclaimed a
success by every one present. Mc-
Dermott had his jazz orchestra on
hand, which furnished excellent music,
and refreshments were served. The
spacious porches of the Delta Tau
House were nicely arranged so that
the guests could enjoy the moon
light between dances. Many of the
Stanford summer colony came to the
dance skeptical as to the possibilities
of a successful party during the dull
summer quarter, but are now anxious
ly awaiting the next dance.
Louis McDermott announces that
the second of the series of summer
dances will be given at the Delta Tau
Delta house on July 18th. As the
main object of these dances is for
everyone attending Stanford during
the summer to get acquainted, every
one Is invited to the next dance. The
same orchestra will be on hand, and
the managers are preparing several
additional features.
Another summer dance will be given
at the Womens' Club House, in Palo
Alto, tonight, by three Stanford stu
dents. Everyone is invited to attend.
