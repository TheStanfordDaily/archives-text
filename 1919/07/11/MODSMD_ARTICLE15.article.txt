# COLLEGE STUDENTS UNINFORMED
## 
### 
rriHE truth of the criticism that university students are the poorest read, and
* least informed of all American men and women who hold any pretence of
being educated, is becoming more and more apparent. Professors discover
this when the students ar« questioned as regards any topic of the day. The
morning newspapers are but hastily read by the students who do read them,
and are not read at all by a great number. The periodical reading room at
the library is little frequented; many living groups subscribe to 110 maga
zines, and it is seldom that the conversation of a group of college men or
women turns to a live topic of current interest. Although a large number
of those registered at the colleges are of voting age, they are often incap
able of casting an intelligent ballot. A disinterested attitude, and not a
lack of intelligence is the obvious cause of this.
Universities nowadays are being criticised for what some newspapers
call a "looking backward" policy. The fact that few courses, excluding
those of the law, medical, and engineering departments, are up-to-date, is con
sidered by many as the cause of the average college student's lack of in
terest in modern things. There is little question but that college men and
women would develop an interest that would go to improve them as real
American citizens, if the universities would put more emphasis on the study
of modern theories instead of delving into the distant past, if they made it
a part of their policy to encourage the study of the thousand and one topics
of current interest, and if they secured speakers for college assemblies with
reputations, instead of the "mossbacks" who often grace their platforms.
The college scholastic system is not primarily at fault. The students have
gradually drifted toward a complete isolation. A college man is considered
very much "on the boat" if he knows all of his fellow students by their
-Jirst names, and if he is up on the latest college gossip. No one asks him to
know anything about what goes on outside the walls of the university, and
tha live topics that stir the practical world are not important enough to take
the time of the busy college man. Woodrow Wilson has said that the
college is a place to train the mind, and the character development is inci
dental and will come naturally with the building up of the mind. The mind
is but partly trained, however, if its development has not kept up with the
things of modern interest. The college men and women must realize their
provincial attitude and the faculties must come down from their pedagogical
heights before university students can really be considered well informed.
