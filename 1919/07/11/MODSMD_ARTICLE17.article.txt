# WHEREFORE NOT: SIMPLIFIED SPELLING
## 
### A.S. Glikbarg, '19 
The object of anything that is liable I
to succeed this opening sentence is to 1
expound upon the beauties and merits
of simplified spelling. Not being en
tirely certain as to whether the"i"
precedes the "e" in such words as
"chief" and siezed", the writer is ex
tremely in favor of the simplified spell
ing proposition. The simpler it is made
the better he will like it. The present
situation is distressing—or at least not
prepossessing. There is no doubt at
all but that the introduction of a new
system would bring many changes with
it. I hat's a habit that new systems
have.
I o grow practical and leave the
theory above, let us examine the various
reasons why we should abolish the sys
tem as it is and substitute a new one. |
Ihe present word "it", for instance,
could be simplified a great deal. It could
be spelled with an "ough" at the end—
which would besilent. The purpose of
the "ough" would be to add another
instance to the absurdities of the pres
ent abuses of that arrangement of let
ters. My idea is not to simply but to
complicate. 1 hereby put myself on
record as saying that the present sys
tem is not too complex but too simple, i
People are too rapidly acquiring the'
correct spelling of words, and my con-1
tention is that if the object of the change'
is going to be to confuse, why not do it
properly? Instead of confusing by drop
ping the "j" out of "jam", and spell
ing "pepper" with a single "p", why not
properly confuse? It is traditional that
radicals are not radical. They would
change the existing order without a
proper. caution to conceal the results
they aim at. Here is my idea. In
stead of shortening words by leaving out
letters we have always included in them,
why not lengthen them to make room
for letters to which we may be partial?
We could begin with a rule by allowing
no words of a single syllable. This
would be the only rule in the realm of
spelling to which we would permit no
exception. In front of every word that
under the obsolete system had a single
syllable, we would make additions. We
would spell "soup" "ojksoup", and the
first portion would be silent. While
I am on the point, may I not insert that
the present situation of the word "soup"
is other than silent? In fact, it often
gets noisy and sometimes boisterous.
The word "salt" would be spelled
"saltrmd". The ending would have no
purpose except to satisfy the require
ment of duosyllabicness. (Notice the
merits of that last word. I just made
it up, and so can spell it as I wish. The
accent is on the eighth syllabic and the
second is unpronounced.) After mak
ing sure that the new system would
have many unnecessary syllables in it,
the method would be this. List', for
this is the Rig secret. Every man would
be forced to make up his own system
of spelling, and if it at all coincided
with another man's system he wouldn't
be allowed to use it. In that way all
the difficulties would be done away with,
as eery man could make his system as
simple as he wished. I might add that
people who attend summer schools, with
no laws keeping them away from the
seashore, would formulate some won
derfully simple systems. And then
again, T might not add it at all.
