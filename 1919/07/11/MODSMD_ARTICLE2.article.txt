# Professor West Announces Plans
## 
### 
The aims and policies of the new
Political Science Department are told
in the following statement by Pro
fessor Victor West, who has been
named head of the department:
The new department of political
science has no other immediate pur
pose than to assist the other depart
ments of the university in the work
of making Stanford men and women
the most useful citizens. Its contri
bution to this work will be an attempt
to educate the students who come
to it in sound conceptions of the
nature, purpose and limitations of po
litical institutions. It desires to be
of service to all students and to that
end will conduct at least one course of
a general nature. But from the start
emphasis will be put on advanced
work, in the belief that the intelligent
and informed political leadership al
ways so much needed in a democracy
can be developed in no better way
than in the intensive study of political
problems.
The work in political science, there
for given in the departtment of
economics, has been gradually devel
oping under the generous encourage
ment and wise guidance of Professor
Wildman. It is now at the stage
where, for the best interest of the
University, it seems wise to give it
opportunity to expand independently.
Nevertheless the department starts
modestly with a teaching staff of two
members.. When it has demon
strated its usefulness it expects to
increase in size..
We are very fortunate to be able to
bring Professor Cottrell here.. He is
young, enthusiastic, energetic, and has
the reputation of being a good teacher.
In addition he has had a great deal
of practical experience in actual solu

tion of governmental problems. His
interests are chiefly in administra
tion and particularly in local govern
ment. He will bring the training and
point of view of an easterner to
temper the middle-western atmosphere
which surrounds the other half of the
department.
At the present time departmental re
quirements have not been determined
upon. It is expected that these will
be sufficient to assure that majors in
the department will acquire a rather
broad education together with con
siderable special training in political
science and allied subjects. However,
the requirements will be flexible
enough to meet the varying needs and
interests, of different students.
