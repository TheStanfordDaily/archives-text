"In the common expression the world
has been made safe for democracy.
By that expression we understand not
only the democracy of the political
world, but democracy in every sphere
of activity. It still remains to make the
world safe for democracy in the work
shops of the nations," said Mr. Walter
Mc Arthur in his lecture upon "Re
ligion and Industrial Reconstruction,"
in the Little Theatre last night.
"The need of the hour is for men and

women of vision, who realize the great,
even revolutionary, change that has come
over the world and who possess cour
age enough to grapple with the new
problems in a spirit of optimism and
with a determination to succeed."
This lecture was the fourth in the
series upon "The New Age". Last week
Dr. John Vorris spoke upon "The
Church Coming Back", and presented
his subject in an able and interesting
manner.
