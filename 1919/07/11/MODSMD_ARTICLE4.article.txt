### 
"The League of Nations is the
cornerstone of the necessary organi
zation of the world, without which
permanent peace will be impossible."
Such w*is the declaration of Pro
fessor Bailey Willis in an address on
"South American Peace Problems" in
the Little Theatre last Tuesday night.
"The League must be adopted, must
De established," said Professor Willis.
"Because some South American nations
are not yet members of the League of
Nations, their adhesion presents some
difficulties. It is essential "that such
difficulties shall be overcome in a spirit
of mutual consideration and good will
because of the vital nccesity of establish
ing the league.
"Even though there are difficulties,
the league is none the less vital and
essential. "The present agitation
agitation against the League of Na
tions is un-American and threatens the
world's opportunity for permanent
peace.
"Speaking of the Latin-American peo
ple in general, they may be character
ized as idealists. Among them arc men

j of very great intellectual power and high
culture, who dream great dreams of
national development. They have failed
to accomplish them in a practical and
satisfactory manner because they do not
take account of the fundamental facts.
"Tt is the duty of American engineers
and American people through friendly
intercourse and investment to help de
velop and populate South America in
i cooperation with the leaders of those
. countries in order that they may attain
sound citizenship and stable self-govern
i ment.
i "Among the conditions of the League
of Nations is the proposal to guarantee
the territorial integrity of each country,
and each nation will regard that pro-
I posal from the point of view of its own
; satisfaction or unsatisfied desire. There
j are in South America twenty-one
i boundary disputes. Most of these can
be settled by mediation. The United
I States is now engaged in mediating a
boundary dispute in South America.
"The solution of the problem pre
sented by the investments of one coun
try in another in order that they may
be justly safeguarded and that the in
terests of the natives of the country may
also he protected is one of the most
difficult * problems which will lie pre
sented to the league and is one in
which the United States has an interest.
"It will not do for us to permit
again the solution by conquest which
has prevailed in the past."
