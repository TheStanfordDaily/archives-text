Dear Walt:
At the rugby game last Sunday there
were 10,000 spectators. The sport is a
great hit here, and the French are good
at it. We found Harry Maloney in
charge of track, Stubby Stoltz in charge
of rugby, and Red Reynolds in charge
of soccer. Besides Stubby, there are
playing on the team Red- Hauser, Red
Fisher, Jimmy Thoburn, Kenny Dole,
Rich Sherman, Le-Count Slocum, and
Johnny O'Neil and Jimmy Fitzpatrick of
Santa Clara. Also a bunch of old high
school players from around Stanford.
They are expecting Danny Carroll from
Oxford and Art F.rb from the front in
time for the big game, also Hill Muldoon.
Sincerely,
Dink.
