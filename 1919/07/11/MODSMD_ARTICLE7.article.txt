# TENTATIVE DATE FOR BIG GAME IS SET FOR DEC. 6
## Freshman Game is Certain for Nov. 15 
### 
OTAFFORD and the University of California have agreed upon a date for
the resumption of freshman football relations, and a tentative date for
the Stanford-California varsity Big Game, according to athletic schedules
released this week by student manager Ames of Stanford and graduate man
ager Nichols of the University of California. The rival freshmen elevens will
play on the Berkeley gridiron on November 15th, while the varsity contest
has been scheduled for December 6th. This date is satisfactory to both of
the student bodies, but the final decision rests with the University of Cali-

fornia faculty. Last year the examina
tions at Berkeley were stretched out over
a period of three weeks, and if this is
done again this year instead of having
the old system of one week of final ex
aminations, the game on Decenber 6th
would interfere, but it is hoped that the
examinations will not begin until later in
December.
As far as games with the University
of California are concerned, the sched
ule for football, baseball, basketball, and
track is now complete for next year. As
given out by Student Manager Ames yes
terday, the schedule follows:
