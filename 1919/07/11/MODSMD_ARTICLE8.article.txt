# New Library Will Open Next Monday
## Remodeled Library Will be For the Use of Law Department 
### 
Monday, July fourteenth, has been
set for the opening of the new library.
The only delay that seems possible is
that the contractors will not finish
laying the linoleum in the main read
ing room in time for such an early
opening.. However, the work is well
under way and the contractors promise
that the library will be completed by
Saturday night..
The first lot of the 210,000 books to
be moved was transferred last Mon
day morning and according to Librari
an George T. Clark, the transfer of
the books will not require more than
two weeks. The library will not be
closed during any of the time that the
moving is in progress. The reserve
and reference books will either be
moved at night or on Sunday. By this
plan the students will be able to get
the reference books at all times and
no one will be in any way inconveni
enced by the library moving..
On the first floor to the left of the
main entrance is the reserve book
room which will contain all of the re
serve books that are called for in the
different courses.
A document room is also on the
ground floor and will contain U. S.
and government documents. The
other rooms on this floor will be re
served for uses that appear as the
library grows.
The main reading room is located on
the second floor and is wonderfully
lighted by large sky lights and numer
ous windows of magnificent propor
tions. This room is 190 feet long and
42 feet wide with a distance from
floor to ceiling of about 20 feet, and
will be furnished with quarter-sawed
oak desks and chairs.
