U A Stop at Suzanne's and Lower
" Plights," is the title of a volume
of prose sketches and letters written
by Greayer Clover, '19, which deals
with his experiences during six months
of service with the French camion con
voi, and later service as cadet and
second lieutenant in the American
Aviation Corps. Clover attended Stan
ford for one year, transferring to
Yale, from whence he enlisted in the
French Camion Service, early in 1917.
After transferring to the American
air service when the United States
entered the war. Clover was doing
successful work as pilot when his ma
chine crashed to earth, fatally injuring
him. His death occurred August 30,
1918.
The volume of his sketches and let
ters has been edited and published by
his father, and contains the sketches
written in France, letters written be
fore he enlisted from Yale, and after
he had served with the gallant French
and American soldiers, and also many
glowing tributes to the young patriot
from friends he had made at Stanford,
at Yale, and "over there."
"A Stop at Suzanne's" relates his
experiences the first time he made
a flight alone â€”his "petit voyage." In
this, as well as in the other sketches,
are found keen observation, accurate
and charming powers of description,
an innate and sympathetic understand
ing, and at the same time a sense of
humor which saw the brighter side
of all the suffering and sorrow he had
witnessed in France.
