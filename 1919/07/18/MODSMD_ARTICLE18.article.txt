# SUMMER QUARTER AND TRADITIONS
## 
### 
IT is not surprising that many students who attend Stanford during the
* summer are not familiar with many of the local customs and traditions;
but with the four quarter-system in vogue, a summer quarter is a more in
tegral part of the Stanford scholastic system than the old summer session
used to be. It is the duty of every one registered to become acquainted with
the few "what to do and who not to' do" rules that govern the conduct of
real men and women of Stanford. On several occasions, students have been
seen smoking on the Quad, apparently in total ignorance of the long estab
lished custom in accordance with Mrs. Stanford's wishes. Of late, women
have congregated on the law and economicss steps, violating a tradition of
long standing.. While it is difficult for occasional students at Stanford to
"get on the boat" as regards customs typical of Stanford, it is not impossible,
and university life 011 the campus during the summer quarter will more
closely resemble that of the other quarters if some attempt is made by the
new students to find out just what is expected of Stanford people.
