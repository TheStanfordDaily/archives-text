# CAMPUS IN CHAINS
## 
### 
DIGID censorship is again in forcc on the campus. The obnoxious chains have
been put up, and hundreds of visitors who enjoy motoring past the beautiful
Stanford buildings are forced to park their cars and make a tour on foot, some
thing that the casual visitor will not do. The "longest way home" is now the rule
for those who live 011 the campus, and their friends are compelled to make an
inconvenient detour to find their way to Stanford residences. The University
reason for this action is said to be, "The classes are continually disturbed Ity
noisy autoists." Our modern conception of a university is a place to fit one
for work in the world. We can be perfectly sure that no chains will be put up
around us out in real life to keep the "noisy autoists" away, so why teach us
under abnormal conditions. Students who can not concentrate with the little
annoyance that passing automobiles cause will be sadly handicapped in the world
of business with its thousands of annoyances, and, as a matter of fact, the
greatest annoyance that students have to put up with in the line of disturbing
vehicles, is that caused from the University's own trucks that rattle around the
Quad, chains or no chains.
