# GOODLUCK TO GILKBARG
## 
### 
JT is with a feeling of regret that the Daily Palo Alto announces that the
''Wherefore Not" column closes with today's issue, and that A. Sam Glikharg,
'19, leaves Stanford. Glikharg is the Chaparral editor-elect and will be missed on
the campus next fall. With Glikbark's contribution to the issues of Volume 56,
the Daily has felt that a long and useless disagreement between the Stanford
daily and the comic magazine has been brought to a close. Glikharg'goes to
Harvard to complete his law course, and the paper wishes him the success that
he deserves.
