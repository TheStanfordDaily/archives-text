# WHEREFORE NOT: P.O. REFORM
## 
### A. Sam Glikbarg, '19 
The editor has recently been in
sisting upon the writer concocting a
denunciation of the Stanford P. O.
The writer is a Democrat and would
rather not do this, but the editor is
a Republican and pays the writer.
He being in a dictatorial position
(holding the writer's $300 a week
salary in his clutches) insists that
Ihe P. O. be denounced. Deing an
obliging duck, I hereby denounce.
The writer just returned from the
veneralable P. O. He was late to
his class (in which this article is
being written) because the doddering
clerks at the decadent office were too
busy combing their, gray hairs to
crawl to the "window, and say, "Noth
ing for you." There seems to be a
continual contest at the esteemed P.
O. between the various tetterers and
the one energetic and blithe individual,
to see who can arrive at the window
behind the other. The result is gen
erally a tie, neither party arriving.
The conveniences of our beloved
P. O. are anything at all, but they are
not conveniences. I am convinced that
no post office is complete without
running water, couches upon which to
read the two-day late mail, and a few
minor accessories, such as pool tables,
and a golf links.
All these things are lacking in our
office, probably, because the birth of
these officials antedates the invention
of the required conveniences.
Furthermore, the office closes night
ly at 6, a habit which is unjust to
law majors, whose watches are never
set correctly since they are within
earshot of the chimes; by which they
set their Ingersolls, Walthams, Elgins
or Swisses. (Scratch out those not
applicable to your situation.) The
j writer has it upon the word of the
editor of this paper, (which, by the
way, he thinks very little of, the paper,
not the editor; since the editor owes
him money) that the P. O. stays open
evenings during September, when no
one is here. This may or may not be
true, the writer never having been
here during September and never in
tending to be; it being bad enough
here during the summer.
The concluding intention is to lay
the blame, a necessary intention to
all denunciatory articles. It lies with
Burleson. Prom him it advances to
the Adminstration, whose logical head
is Woodrow Wilson. He could arrange
better facilities in our own little P. O.
except for the fact that he is wasting
his time "with a faulty, worthless and
useless League of Nations.. If he put
his time here, we would be satisfied
with his efforts; while, when putting
it to the League of Nations, the most
he can accomplish, is the ultimate
peace on earth, and a total and final
defeat of our old-time friend, the God
of War. The writer realizes that this
is small argument against the League,
but he can't help expounding small
arguments, after reading those of the
Republican Senators as expounded in
that beautiful, fair and square, low
down, yellow sheet, the San Francisco
Contaminator.

clerks at the decadent office were too
busy combing their, gray hairs to
crawl to the "window, and say, "Noth
ing for you." There seems to be a
continual contest at the esteemed P.
O. between the various tetterers and
the one energetic and blithe individual,
to see who can arrive at the window
behind the other. The result is gen
erally a tie, neither party arriving.
The conveniences of our beloved
P. O. are anything at all, but they are
not conveniences. I am convinced that
no post office is complete without
running water, couches upon which to
read the two-day late mail, and a few
minor accessories, such as pool tables,
and a golf links.
All these things are lacking in our
office, probably, because the birth of
these officials antedates the invention
of the required conveniences.
Furthermore, the office closes night
ly at 6, a habit which is unjust to
law majors, whose watches are never
set correctly since they are within
earshot of the chimes; by which they
set their Ingersolls, Walthams, Elgins
or Swisses. (Scratch out those not
applicable to your situation.) The
j writer has it upon the word of the
editor of this paper, (which, by the
way, he thinks very little of, the paper,
not the editor; since the editor owes
him money) that the P. O. stays open
evenings during September, when no
one is here. This may or may not be
true, the writer never having been
here during September and never in
tending to be; it being bad enough
here during the summer.
The concluding intention is to lay
the blame, a necessary intention to
all denunciatory articles. It lies with
Burleson. Prom him it advances to
the Adminstration, whose logical head
is Woodrow Wilson. He could arrange
better facilities in our own little P. O.
except for the fact that he is wasting
his time "with a faulty, worthless and
useless League of Nations.. If he put
his time here, we would be satisfied
with his efforts; while, when putting
it to the League of Nations, the most
he can accomplish, is the ultimate
peace on earth, and a total and final
defeat of our old-time friend, the God
of War. The writer realizes that this
is small argument against the League,
but he can't help expounding small
arguments, after reading those of the
Republican Senators as expounded in
that beautiful, fair and square, low
down, yellow sheet, the San Francisco
Contaminator.
The editor has recently been in
sisting upon the writer concocting a
denunciation of the Stanford P. O.
The writer is a Democrat and would
rather not do this, but the editor is
a Republican and pays the writer.
He being in a dictatorial position
(holding the writer's $300 a week
salary in his clutches) insists that
Ihe P. O. be denounced. Deing an
obliging duck, I hereby denounce.
The writer just returned from the
veneralable P. O. He was late to
his class (in which this article is
being written) because the doddering
clerks at the decadent office were too
busy combing their, gray hairs to
crawl to the "window, and say, "Noth
ing for you." There seems to be a
continual contest at the esteemed P.
O. between the various tetterers and
