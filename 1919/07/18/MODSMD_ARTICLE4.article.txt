# FOOTBALL PLANS ARE MADE
## 
### 
Word lias been received on the cam
pus from Coach Boh Evans that all his
plans are completed for the two weeks'
football practice to hegin on the 15th of
September. He expects that a large
number of men who wish to learn the
American game will take advantage of
the opportunity to master some of the
finer points of the game before the ma
jority of the squad returns to the Uni
versity in October. The practices will
be held on the varsity field and will be
along the order of training established
last spring.
Football experts agree that Stanford
will have a splendid opportunity of de
veloping a strong eleven the first year.
Contrary to original expectations, a num
ber of veteran American players will be

on the campus. With these men as a
nucleus, Evans will be able - to turn out
a winning aggregation in Stanford's first
attempt at the American game for ten
years. Games have been scheduled with
a number of good university teams, and
the prospects of a resumption of foot
ball relations with the University of
California seem bright. Student Mana
ger Ames is in receipt of a number of
requests for games from universities
such as Idaho and Arizona, and at
least one long trip will be given the
Stanford Varsity. It is impossible to
make any attempt at lining up a pos
sible eleven at this early date, although
it is known that some five or six stars
have positions well cinched for the com
ing season.
