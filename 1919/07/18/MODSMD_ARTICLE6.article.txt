# VOLUNTARY SAVING OF FOOD PRAISED BY ALLEN
## SPEAKER IS ALUMNUS Newspaper Publicity Met Hearty Response In America 
### 
A MERICA'S whole-hearted acceptance
of food conservation made the work
of the United States Food Administra
tion an unqualified success, said Ben
S. Allen, Stanford '07, to a small but
very enthusiastic audience in the
Little Theater, last Tuesday night.
Allen, who now is editor of the Sac
ramento Union, and a newspaperman
of wide experience, was closely asso
ciated with Herbert Hoover both be
fore the United States entered the
war and afterwards.
"Voluntary food conservation ac
complished more in the United States
in six months than yas accomplished
in Belgium in three years," said the
speaker. "The food bill was a rickety
affair, purposely weakened by some
pro-German and other dangerous per
sons in the Senate."
Allen told how the newspapers gave
excellent and valuable co-operation to
the food administration during the
war. "The total sum of the public's
opinion is based on newspaper in
formation despite the assertion by
most people that they do not believe
what they read in the newspapers."
Allen paid high tribute to President
Ray Lyman Wilbur, Dr. Vernon L.
Kellogg, Everett W. Smith and the
late Hiram Fiske, all Stanford men
who worked with the food administra
tion.
Allen was prominent in campus
journalism during his college days,
and has been connected with various
papers since his graduation. At the
time war broke out, he was Associated
Press correspondent in England, and
in that capacity met many of the most
prominent men in the British empire.
