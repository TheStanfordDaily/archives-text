# SELLING BRILL AND CO-ED COMPANION MEET HOLD-UP MEN
## 
### 
While motoring on a lonely road in
the foothills behind the University last
Sunday evening, Selling Brill, '20, and
a member of the 500 were fired upon by
two masked men. Brill had stopped the
car to allow the motor to cool when he
noticed two rough-appearing men just
ahead, apparently putting on masks. It
was impossible to turn around on the
narrow mountain road, so Brill started
his car and attempted to pass the men.
They shouted for him to stop, and when
lie ignored their order, they opened fire
at the back of the car. Neither Brill
nor the Stanford girl were hurt, and thus
far no trace has been found of the
would-be hold-up men.
