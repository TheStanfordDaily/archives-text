# High Tribute is Paid Aupperle
## Comrade Writes Letter Describing Death of Stanford Hero 
### 
'"One of Stanford's best men has gone
his way. And at the same time Serbia
loses one of her best American friends."
Such is the tribute that is said in
memory of Harold V. Aupperle, better
known to the Farm as "Aupp," in a
letter that has been received here from
one of his co-workers with the American
Red Cross Commission to Serbia.. Aup
perle died while on duty in Serbia. He
was a victim of typhus. The letter
which tells of Aupperle's death, the
honors paid him. and the loss felt by
his friends, is from Harry VV. Frantz. a
Stanford man.
"Upon his death he receives all the
honors that man can give," the letter
says."The Prince Regent sent his band
to play at the cemetery. The highest mil
itary decoration, the Order of the White
Eagle.was conferred. There was a
beautiful floral piece from the Serbian
army, to 'our brave comrade.' Forty
brave veterans fired the last salute over
the grave. One of those who mourned
was a poor old 'boozy' soldier whom
Aupp had helped on many a day from
the depths of his down-and-outedness.
As we went to the cemetery an old gray
haired Serbian woman who owned a
home where Aupp once had lived came
running out into the street to offer her
little bouquet.
In another place the letter tells of
Aupperle's death. It says:
'Aup died at Nova Varosh, a moun
tain town near the Bosnian frontier, af
ter just two weeks' illness. The body
was forwarded to Belgrade. We made
arrangements for a quiet funeral here.
If it had been public there would have
been an awful crowd. The cemetery is
a pretty place overlooking the Danube.
"Aupp made a splendid reputation for
himself. Colonel Farnam, the commis
sioner, was so pleased with his work
that he made him a captain in May.
Colonel Farnam lias already recommend
ed Aupp for the Distinguished Service
medal."
Upon Aupperle's death, Colonel Far
num at once cabled to his parents in
Colorado and to President Wilbur. In
the cable he paid the nighest tribute to
Aupperle for his courage in bringing re
lief to one of the most desolate parts of
Serbia.
The Belgrade Democratia, a Serbian
newspaper, contained an article telling
of the death and speaking in the high
est terms of the former Stanford man.
His name had become known in many
parts of Serbia because of his untiring
efforts and cheerfulness in his work.
