Seventy Stanford men and women
sat down to a Stanford Overseas Din

says a letter which has just been re
ceived by Mrs. Julia Boynton Green
from her son. Boynton M. Green, '14.
About fifteen Stanford women who are
in Red Cross, \ . W. C. A. or other war
service work were present at the affair.
"Last Tuesday night I went to the big
Stanford banquet," says the letter. "I
think there must have been nearly sev
enty present, including Herbert Hoover,
Professor Adams, head of the History
Department; about fifteen Stanford
women who are in Red Cross. "Y," and
other services, and two or three Stan
ford men in civilian dress over here on
business. It was certainly a grand af
fair.
"I saw my old friend, Bill Fletcher,
who is now a second lieutenant of
Engineers. He got his commission in
April. It is the first time I have seen
him since I left Company D. and we
had a long talk."
Green also sent a program and menu
of the banquet. He noted on the back
of this the names of Captain Kenneth
Dole of the Medical Corps, Lieutenant
Palmer Fuller, and Lieutenant Tho
burn of the Fifth Field Artillery, as
being present at the reunion.
The dinner was held at the American
University Club.
Green himself has been studying at
Sorbonnc for a few months. He grad
uated from Saumur Artillery School re
cently. His letter was to the effect that
bis chances of an early return to the
United States were getting brighter.
