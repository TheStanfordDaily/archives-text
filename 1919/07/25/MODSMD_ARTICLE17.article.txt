# POLICY AND VACATIONS
## 
### 
ffio give as few holidays and vacation periods as possible, to conduct classes
*• even on National Holidays, and to hold an assembly instead of granting
a holiday on days that public opinion demands be recognized, has long been
a policy of the administration at Stanford. This is in accordance with the
quarter system which makes the college work more compact, makes it pos
sible for a student to complete his course in a shorter period of time, and
as a general rule is commendable. Stanford students do not wish to have
their work continually broken up by useless holidays, and they as a whole
approve of the quarter system. They approve of it even though the faculty
has not altogether followed out the necessary policy of cutting the amount
of work to fit the time allowed for its accomplishment. There are times,
however, when a vacation would be best for everyone, and when it is mere
fioolishness to conduct classes.
Why the authorities scheduled the opening work of the second half of
the summer quarter for Thursday of this week is more than we can see.
Probably there was 110 reason. The student* who are taking the full
quarter's work took examinations during the first part of the week. There
was the customary and necessary reaction that follows any examinations, and
the students certainly did not feel in the mood for starting another grind.
If what we are taught about efficiency is correct, a great deal more would be
accomplished in the end, if college work had been called off for the rest of
the week, and the second half of the quarter had opened on Monday.
Coming back to the subject of assemblies as a substitution for the proper
observance of national holidays, we recall the fact that Grover Cleveland
spent a certain Decoration Day on a fishing trip. We see no reason why
we should not spend our holidays exactly as we see fit, and if we chose to
observe Memorial Day on a picnic, we are well within our rights, and the
holiday should not be called off simply because the students refuse to make
an agreement to attend memorial services.
