# DEPARTMENT COOPERATION
## 
### 
ITNIVERSITY students are continually lectured upon the value of coopera
tion. Specialised work is recognized as necessary and desirable, but the
college man is instructed that he can accomplish the best results only by
â€¢ooperation. To secure this and to give a broader education, a student major
ing in one department is required to take certain subjects in another de
partment. We wonder if there is any cooperation between the departments
when the schedule of University courses is made out. Economics majors
are required to take English Composition, yet the only course offered by
the English department in composition is limited to English and Journalism
majors. Law students should Jake a certain amount of Economics, but the
schedule is so arranged that most of the acceptable courses conflict. Stu
dents could have a better range of courses from which to choose, if the depart
ments gave more thought to each other and were less selfcentered.
