# My Visitors

### 
One deep dark night when no moon
shone
And windows rattled loosely,
I ope'd my door to admit one
Who 'gan to talk profusely.
She took off furs and heavy coat
And sat down with a will,
And if I'd not dropped off to sleep
I would be listening still.
With voice high-pitched and glance of
steel
She hypnotized me, while
Her two young off-spring smirked and
blushed,
Then at me cast a smile.
She wanted them to go upon
A nicc long trip with me, —
I could choose one or else take both,
Our journey's end to be
Imagination's realm of gold
Where sunsets never dim,
Where Morals frolic up and down
With Cares now grown quite slim;
Where kings and queens rule wisely
With not one revolution.
Where all the world's carefree and
gay,—
No work—that's the solution.
And now of course you've found this
out:
The woman in my story
("an be none other than the stout
Old lady Allegory;
And what are her two children's names?
To guess, I know you're able.
Thrse smirking blushing little dudes
Are Parable and Fable.
