# Rev. Dutton Denounces Tariff
## 
### 
The tariff system was condemned and
a plea for the "open door" in commerce
was made by Rev. Caleb S. S. Dutton,
pastor of the First Unitarian Church of
San Francisco, to an audience in the
Little Theatre Tuesday night. He de
clared economic freedom of the world
should be included in the new order.
The subject of his address was "New
Horizons."
"The nations, making their own tariff
laws, strive to injure their neighbors
while seeking their own selfish ends,"
he said. "The economic freedom of the
world is a new horizon."
"The mental state of humanity," said
Rev. Dutton, is at the conclusion of
history's most destructive war, hopeful
of greater freedom. Materialism must
be supplanted by spiritual ideals if the
new age realizes all its possibilities.
"To-day we are haunted by living
dreams of the future reconstruction of
human life; never before in history has
so large a part of the world felt itself
just on the verge of a new order.
Groups, nations, races can scarcely wait

the morning of the new day when new
demanded rights all seem possible."
Provincial and racial snobbishness
must vanish in the new age. said the
speaker. The association of nations is
destined to be more intimate, he de
clared.
"Now. we have learned that what
ever resources are necessary for war
we can supply them." he said again. "In
peace we shall be derelict henceforth if
we do not find it imperative to use
money to procure decent living condi
tions for all men. We shall be derelict
if we spend foolishly what might go for
worth-while things."
In conclusion he dealt with a "new
spiritual power" as one of the new hori
zons. He said the world is longing for
the revival of a religion of power, and
that religion can only be the religion of
humanity.
Rev. Dutton also was the preacher for
Memorial Church last Sunday and will
occupy the pulpit for the coming two
Sundays.
