STANFORD may schedule a football
game with either the University of
Arizona, Idaho, or Utah elevens, ac
cording to an announcement made by
Student Manager Walter I. Ames.

ford varsity will take one long trip
during the Christmas holidays. He is
waiting for the return of Coach Evans,
and will then place the matter before
the Student Council. The varsity al
ready has the Oregon trip scheduled,
but a trip after the final examinations
would not interfere with the Univer

Although it is impossible to pre

get the game, it is believed that Stan

University of Arizona at Phoenix,
slated for Christmas Day. Stanford
