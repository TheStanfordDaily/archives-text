# PRESS CLUB AND ALUMNI TO TAKE OVER "ILLUSTRATED"
## Review to Be Under Joint Control 
### 
FOLLOWING out the plan that was announced early In the summer, the
Illustrated Review, which has been handled by the Alumni Association
during the war, has been returned to its original owners, the Stanford Press
Club, but in the future will be published under a joint Alumni and Press
Club editorial and business management. The new scheme has been per-

fected, and members of the Press Club
and Alumni Association competent to
speak for the organizations have made
all arrangements. A few of the de
tails of the new organization will have
to be settled during the fall quarter,
but the first edition of the new Il
lustrated will appear on the campus
on Registration Day.
The magazine will be published by
a joint editorial board consisting of
three members of the Press Club and
three members of the Alumni Associa
tion. The magazine will be divided
into two sections, one for topics of
interest purely to members of the
Alumni, of which the magazine now
has a circulation of over three thou
sand, and the other section for topics
pertaining to student life at Stanford.
It is a combination of the old Il
lustrated Review started by the Press
Club, and which held great interest on
the campus, but little outside, and the
present Illustrated which has attracted
widespread approval among the alum
ni, but which has been read but little
by the students. The business man

agement will be under a board con
sisting of a manager elected by the
Press Club, and the Secretary of the
Alumni Association. The student man
ager will have charge of the active
management of the magazine, and the
Secretary of the Alumni Association
will have change of the alumni sub
scriptions and the part of the alumni
dues which go towards the support
of the Illustrated.
The new magazine will be published
monthly, and will contain a great
number of illustrations. It will have
the support of both the students and
the alumni, and should be widely read.
The Press Club will start a campaign
for student subscriptions in October,
and expect to obtain a wider circula
tion than the original Illustrated Re
view had. The permanent editorial
board will not be selected until all
of the Press Club men return to the
University in October, but the first
edition will be put out by a temporary
board consisting of Press Club men
now in college.
