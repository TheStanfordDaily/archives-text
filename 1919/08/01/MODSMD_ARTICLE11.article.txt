# 'INDIVIDUAL MAN GIVEN TOO LITTLE CARE!' CLAIMS FITE
## SHOWS GERMAN POLICY Princeton Professor Flays Erroneous Biological Point of View 
### 
PROFESSOR FITE SAYS: —
That Spencer's "virtuous" man
is the sort that we usually want
to kill.
That the biological point of view
is the stock-breeder's point of
view of humanity.
That conversational topics
have changed greatly since the
time of Anthony Trollope's
novels.
That he does not believe in
the "education for service" Idea.
That man is the only animal
that is also a biologist
That there is much in our
everyday life that is of German
origin, but we are not aware
of it.

rpOO much emphasis on mankind as
* a species and too little emphasis on
individual men is the prevalent atti
tude of the day in the mind of Warner
Fite, professor of philosophy at Prince
ton, who addressed a large audience
in the Little Theater, Tuesday even
ing. The subject of his address was
"Our Biological Ethics."
"This attitude," he said, "has be
come common since Darwin's theory
of the origin of species and the sur
vival of the fittest was given to the
world. It attempts to make a direct
pararallel between the species man.
and the species of lower animals. Na
ture, in the case of the lower animals,
thinks of the species and not the in
dividuals."
This attitude is erected upon mis
take as a foundation, according to
Professoi Fite. The individual should
receive the emphasis, he thinks, and
man as a species should take a second
position.
"This biological principle underlies
German philosophy," said the speaker.
"Every individual is expected to sac
rifice himself to the 'super-state.' The
whole German philosophy, underlying
her attitude in the war, was mainly
biological.
"The theory is found in the gospel
do not know it.
of eugenics and in the gospel of effici
ency. We have overcome Germany on
the field of battle. Have we overcome
her in the field of thought? Her prin
ciples of social philosophy figure large
ly in our philosophy and most of us
"We hear so much about education
for service. Tt is emphasized that we
teachers should be training young
men for service and should keep that
thought always uppermost. That is
the biological point of view which
takes no account of individuals as an
end in themselves. When I am talking
to a class of young men I cannot help
but regard them as individuals; my
constant feeling is that they are con
scious persons, whom I wish to de
velop, to broaden, to help find them
selves because cf the benefit that
development will bring to them as
persons.
"Man is the only animal who in
dividually is worth something to him
self, and is not merely useful to the

rest of his kind. The state should
itself be a servant on behalf of the
lives which compose it, instead of
standing as a superstructure."

the University of Indiana in 1913, came

PROFESSOR FITE SAYS: —
That Spencer's "virtuous" man
is the sort that we usually want
to kill.
That the biological point of view
is the stock-breeder's point of
view of humanity.
That conversational topics
have changed greatly since the
time of Anthony Trollope's
novels.
That he does not believe in
the "education for service" Idea.
That man is the only animal
that is also a biologist
That there is much in our
everyday life that is of German
origin, but we are not aware
of it.

rpOO much emphasis on mankind as
* a species and too little emphasis on
individual men is the prevalent atti
tude of the day in the mind of Warner
Fite, professor of philosophy at Prince
ton, who addressed a large audience
in the Little Theater, Tuesday even
ing. The subject of his address was
"Our Biological Ethics."
"This attitude," he said, "has be
come common since Darwin's theory
of the origin of species and the sur
vival of the fittest was given to the
world. It attempts to make a direct
pararallel between the species man.
and the species of lower animals. Na
ture, in the case of the lower animals,
thinks of the species and not the in
dividuals."
This attitude is erected upon mis
take as a foundation, according to
Professoi Fite. The individual should
receive the emphasis, he thinks, and
man as a species should take a second
position.
"This biological principle underlies
German philosophy," said the speaker.
"Every individual is expected to sac
rifice himself to the 'super-state.' The
whole German philosophy, underlying
her attitude in the war, was mainly
biological.
"The theory is found in the gospel
