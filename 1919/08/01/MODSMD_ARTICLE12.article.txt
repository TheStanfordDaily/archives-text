## 
### 
Bodie J. Higley, ex-'99, Chairman
of the Stanford War Memorial Fund
in New York state, t has telegraphed
: Mr. J. E. McDowell that ten New York
business men, alumni of Stanford, have
guaranteed New York's quota of ten
thousand dollars. This announcement
illustrates how energetically the na
tional campaign for the fund is being
prosecuted by the various campaign
committees, many of which have been
very recently chosen.
Los Angeles County has been given
a quota of twenty thousand
Word from the chairman has come to
the effect that the quota will probably
be fully subscribed within the next
few days. Official and unofficial re
ports throughout the country are very
optimistic, and seem to indicate great
success for the fund and oversubscrip
tion.
