# STUDENT CONTROL?
## 
### 
fTHE question of whether Stanford shall again have student control depends
* largely on whether the students want it or not, but that again depends
upon whether the students are aducated to want it, or are encouraged to
oppose it. When the question came up in the spring quarter, little enthusi
asm was aroused on the campus, but this was due to the method of pre
sentation. To find out whether the students of Stanford really want to run
their own student body, or whether they want the faculty to run it for them,
will require a concrete plan of student control submitted to the student body
as soon as the fall quarter opens. Now is the time for thinking men on the
campus to work out an acceptable scheme. The faculty seems none too
anxious to continue dispensing disciplinary actions, and the students are re
luctant to go back to the old system of student control, with a few amateur
Tammany artists running the school. After all, does it not fall back on the
spirit behind the movement? If the upper-classmen of Stanford can make
the whole student body feel that certain things are required of Stanford men
and women, and that certain other things are absolutely taboo, a student
control organization can be arranged which will please all, be efficient, and
in reality allow the students to handle their own affairs.
