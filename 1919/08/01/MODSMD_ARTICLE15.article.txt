# CIRCULATION
## 
### 
fTHE DAILY PALO ALTO realizes that without efficient circulation a paper
does not accomplish its prime purpose. It does not get to its readers when
it should, and consequently loses what influence it might otherwise have.
Starting with the weekly published during the summer quarter, the Daily
is making an effort towards a greater circulation. With the paper appearing
on the campus 011 Friday morning, there is little doubt but that it is read
more than was the case with an afternoon distribution. However, the Daily
has had to face the problem of a slack and dilatory post office distribution.
Not with a "pass the buck" feeling, but only in fairness to the paper and to
its circulation department, It should be said that when the Daily Palo Alto
Is not in the post office boxes 011 Friday morning it is because the local
officials find the work too heavy to handle. It has been sometimes impossible
for them to distribute the few hundred papers between the hours of ten and
twelve.
