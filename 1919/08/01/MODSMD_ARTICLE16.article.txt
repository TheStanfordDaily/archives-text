# Captain Parker is Made Major
## 
### 
Captain S. M. Parker is now a
major, having received official word
Wednesday night that his rank as
major has been included since his re
tirement in November 1917. At that
time he had just received his higher
ranking, when he became disabled, and
was put upon the retired list. Because
of his new change, he was retired at
the position he last held as permanent
in the national army, that of Captain.
Belated recognition of his true stand
ing therefore has just arrived, and the
major is wearing his gold oak leaves
today.
