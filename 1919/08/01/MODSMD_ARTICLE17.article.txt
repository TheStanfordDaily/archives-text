# ALUMNUS RANSOMS SON FROM BANDITS
## 
### 
Captured last Thursday, the 14-year
old son of John West Thompson, '95,
was released Friday evening upon pay
ment of 1500 pesos, the ransom demand
ed by bandits who captured him at his
home, thirty miles south of Mexico City.
Payment was made upon the advice of
the Mexican government, who feared
that the bandits would murder the lad,
unless they received the money. Sec
retary Lansing said that the Mexican
foreign office had agreed to refund the
money and take steps toward capturing
the bandits.
\ oung Thompson was a student in the
Palo Alto schools until last December,
when he joined his parents in Meixco
City. His father is manager of the
Electric Light Company and has been en
gineer for various companies in Mexico
for a number of years. The boy was
probably at his mother's ranch at May
tfores when captured, according to his
uncle, T. L. Thompson, an employe of
the local Southern Pacific Railway.
