Cloud
I was born in the dream
Of a mountain stream
That was making its way to the
sea,
And to float in the sky,
As a vanishing sigh,
Is my goal, is my reason to be;
Just to be, just to float,
To be gay and remote,
Not to strive, not to give, not to take,
And sometimes, just by chance,
As an airy romance,
To reflect in a mountain lake.
Floating high with calm ease
In the arms of the breeze
I may sail beyond mortal eye's
quest,
Where the heat of the noons
Weaves its dreams on the dunes
Which the desert arrays on its
breast,
Where the mountain's white peak
Is aspiring to speak
With the heart of the beckoning blue,
While the shimmering wave
Sadly sighs that it gave
To the sky all the secrets it knew.
When the vesper bell rings
And the dusk droops its wings
I may pensively float to the West
Where the sun's dying ray
Ends the life of the day
And sinks down on the ocean to
rest.
Slowly changing my' line
I will poise in the blue
Like a pensive, ethereal nun,
And will timidly sigh
My reluctant good-bye
To the setting, still radiant sun.
Taking final farewell
I will float in the spell
Of the kiss of the vanishing light,
Floating just to be kissed,
And will sink in the mist,
In the billowing breath of the
night.
