Stanford Men Robbed
By Mexican Bandits
Attacked by bandits in a lonely spot,
Carl Beal, '13. and Vernon King, '17,
were robbed of money, baggage and
mules, according to word received
here by friends.
Beal, King, and other members of
the party, were investigating the oil
district around Tampico, recently,
when the Mexicans came upon them.
Surprised by the attack, they were
unable to defend themselves, and the
made good their escape.
