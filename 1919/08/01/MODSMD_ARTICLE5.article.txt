# FRESHMAN FOOTBALL IS SURE OF ITS OWN COACH
## A.L. ACKER APPOINTED Successful Conclusion of Long Campaign for Freshman Sports 
### 
ANNOUNCEMENT has just been
confirmed that the Stanford fresh
man football team will have a separate
coach next fall. A. L. Acker has been
secured by the Stanford Board of Ath
letic Control and will be permanently a
member of the gymnasium instruction
staff. He comes to Stanford from
Owensboro, Kentucky, where he suc
ceeded Coach Bob Evans a number of
years ago. He has made a considerable
reputation as a football and basketball
coach, and according to the southern
newspapers, uses the same methods that
Evans carried out so successfully both in
the south and at the University of Colo
rado. Acker will arrive at Stanford
about September 15th, in time to assist
Evans in the preliminary football prac
tice.
Stanford athletic enthusiasts have long
seen the absolute need of a separate
coach for the freshman teams, and the
securing of a man of Acker's ability
will go a long ways toward turning out
a winning frosh aggregation next fall,
and toward insuring winning varsity
teams in the future.
