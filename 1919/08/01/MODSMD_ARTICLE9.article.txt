# MOULTON-BRISTER CASE TO HAVE A NEW HEARING
## 
### 
A new trial lias been called for the
settling of the charge of assault and
battery upon Edwin, son of "Dad" J. E.
Moulton, former Stanford trainer,
against Mrs. T. E. Rrister. In the first
trial a verdict of two against ten for
conviction resulted in the order for a
new trial.
It appears, from the facts presented
by the prosecuting attorney, Vernon
Malcolm, that young Moulton chased a
chicken into the yard of Mrs. Rrister,
who attacked him witli a croquet mallet,
giving him several blows about the head.
I lie plaintiff denies all charges, but wit
nesses assert that she is in the habit of
using various heavy instruments for in
flicting blows upon neighbors, it being
testified that at one time she attacked
a woman with a rake, and at another
time with a tabic leg. Upon a doctor's
investigation it was found that several
grave bruises and broken patches of skin
bore evidence of the truth of the lad's
affirmations as to Mrs. Rrister's attack.
V. R. Malcolm, city attorney, is pros
ecutor, while L. C. Smith is acting for
the defense. Judge Lakin will preside in
his official capacity of police judge.
