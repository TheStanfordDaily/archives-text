# MOULTON PROPHESIES BIG SUCCESS FOR THE FOOTBALL TEAM
## 
### 
"Dad" Moulton, for years coach of
I Stanford track teams and athletic trainer
of Cardinal football squads, says that
the Stanford eleven will surprise the
football world next fall. Although Stan
ford has not played the American game
for ten years, Moulton is of the opinion
that Coach Bob Evans will have a splen
did team the first year of the return to
the old game. Evans will have Acker to
assist hirti and will not be bothered with
the freshmen. All of his energy can be
devoted toward turning out a winning
varsity. The men will be back on the
campus for two weeks of preliminary
training beginning September 15th. The
schedule of games will be released by
Student Manager Walter I. Ames next
week, and it probably will be known then
on just what date the resumption of foot
ball relations with the University of Cal
ifornia will take place.
