# STANFORD AND PRIDE
## 
### 
I7VERY new college year brings its quota of pessimists and calamity howl
ers, and whether there is anything wrong or not our friends who shoulder
the hammer always find something to let it fall upon. One does not have
to join the ranks of the pessimists, however, to see that Stanford is not
the Stanford of just a few years ago, and that Stanford students of today
do not have the old pride that should go with things of Cardinal hue. The
reasons for this change in spirit are many, and need not be again brought
up. In general, a complete lack of cooperation between the student body and
the faculty, and a series of misunderstandings between the students and the
administration has led to the present state of affairs.
The older men of Stanford returning to the University next fall will have
a greater opportunity for doing constructive work for Stanford than any
students have had in years. The old spirit must be revived, the paint bucket
of Cardinal "pep" must be spilled all over the Quad, traditions that are good
must return, and students must again say that they are proud as punch to
be Stanford men. These things will be easy to accomplish because the
spirit slipped away during the unsettled war times. Neither the faculty nor
the administration are trampling on the rights of the students in the least,
but it will take the older heads to realize this. The feeling of the Seniors
next quarter will be reflected all through the student body, so there is but
one solution —Upperclassmen, get your heads together—agree to be Stanford
boosters instead of knockers, pull with those who are pulling for a better
Stanford, and the spirit that was once the pride of the University will again
be its strongest appeal.
