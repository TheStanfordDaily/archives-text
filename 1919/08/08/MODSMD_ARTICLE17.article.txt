# A
						LOSS TO STANFORD
## 
### 
|>OTH the student body and the faculty of Stanford University regret the
** fact that Major Samuel F. Parker, Commandant of the Stanford Reserve
Officers' Training Corps, will be relieved of his duties here as a result of
a recent War Department order. Major Parker has been very popular on
the campus, being both well liked and admired. He came to Stanford when
the University was being rapidly depleted of its noimal number and quality
of men, and regardless of numerous handicaps, raised the military depart
ment to a high degree of efficiency. During the period of the Student Of
ficers' Training Corps, Major Parker, then holding the rank of Captain,
was in complete command of the men attending Stanford. By his example
and by his methods of instruction he maintained the spirit that Major Bugge
had originally instilled in the students taking military work. Stanford will
miss Major Parker, and his loss will undoubtedly be hard to reconcile, but
the University wishes him success in whatever he may undertake, just as
he was successful here.
