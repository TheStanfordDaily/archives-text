# ROSS CAPABLE OF CHANNEL SWIM
## 
### 
Note:—Norman Ross, '20, announced
his intention recently to attempt to
swim the English Channel. The fol
lowing is taken from an article by
T. W. Sheffield, the swimming expert,
which appeared in the Los Angeles
"Times." Sheffield thinks that the
former Stanford man is the only swim
mer alive today that can perform this
difficult feat.
Over seventy separate attempts have
been made during the last thirty-five
years to swim the English Channel. The
first success was that of Captain Webb,
who was drowned while swimming the
Niagara Rapids. On his second at
tempt on August 24 and 25, 1875, he
swam the channel in the remarkable time
of 21 hours 45 minutes, under very fa
vorable weather conditions, the sea being
quite calm, with no wind and very little
cross tides.
Captain Webb, well smeared with por
poise grease dived in from the Admiral
ty Pier, Dover, at 1 o'clock on the for
mer date, swimming westwards toward
Folkestone. The people of Calais looked
upon Webb in the light of some extraor
dinary being—half man. half fish.
The second man in the world to swim
the channel was Thomas William Bur
gess. For seven years Burgess, the
Yorkshire blacksmith, had been trying.
In that time he had made fourteen at
tempts. Over and over again he was
beaten by one unfavorable circumstance
and another—once when he got to within
a quarter of a mile of his goal.
Nothing daunted, he kept trying, and
his plucky efforts were at last rewarded,
for starting from Dover, he reached the
shore near Cape Grisnez on Wednesday,
September 8, 1911, having been in the
water nearly two rounds of the clock,
covering 60 miles in 22 hours and 35
minutes
The list of attempts to rival Captain
Webb's feat is a monument to pluck and
skill. Over and over ftgain have some
of the swimmers tried, only to have suc
cess snatched away wlien it was almost
in their grasp. Particularly notable are
the efforts of Jabez Wolffe and Mon
tague Holbein. Some of the most nota
ble attempts have been:
1901—August 24 and 25, Montague
Holbein's first attempt. Starting from
Cape Grisnez, he swam to within 5 miles
of England, and gave up. In the water
12 hours 46 minutes.
1902—July 31, Holbein started from
France, and swam for 1 hours, cover
ing about thirty miles.
1904—September 7, Burgess' first at
tempt. Swam 15 miles in eight hours in
a rough sea and gave up within six
miles of France.
1905—July 28, Burges?, swam to with
in 4y 2 miles of Calais. Was in the wa
ter for \2 l / 2 hours.
1905—August 24, Miss Annette Keller
man swam for 6 hours 22 minutes,
1907—September 16, Wolffe swam for
11K- hours and got within 2 miles of the
French coast.
1908—August 17 to 18. Burgess swam
within 1 mile of Cape Grisnez, after
swimming 50 miles in 20 hours.
1908—September 19, Wolffe swam for
nearly 15 hours and got within 440
yards of French coast.
1908—August 28 ,Heaton swam for
17 hours and got within 1 Vi miles of the
French coast;
1911—July 21 and 22, Wolffe started
from French coast, swam for 15K> hours
and reached within 800 yards of the
English shore. Distance covered during
swim 33 miles.
1911—September 2 and 3 Wolffe swam
for 14J4 hours. Started from Sangatte
and reached within a mile of St. Mar
garet's Bay.
Die success of the swim depends
mainly on physique and bulldog tenacity,
combined with a careful study of all the
varying conditions, with the course nav
igated by an experienced pilot, with good
weather prevailing. Given such condi
tions there is no reason why Ross should
not be the third man in the world to
accomplish this great feat of endur
ance. He may not do it the first time,
although that is not improbable, but with
the luck of the tides with him and with
his superhuman physique he should wrest
the victory over the channel for the
honor of America and set the fastest
mark for the future swimmers of the
world to go after.

nearly 15 hours and got within 440
yards of French coast.
1908—August 28 ,Heaton swam for
17 hours and got within 1 Vi miles of the
French coast;
1911—July 21 and 22, Wolffe started
from French coast, swam for 15K> hours
and reached within 800 yards of the
English shore. Distance covered during
swim 33 miles.
1911—September 2 and 3 Wolffe swam
for 14J4 hours. Started from Sangatte
and reached within a mile of St. Mar
garet's Bay.
Die success of the swim depends
mainly on physique and bulldog tenacity,
combined with a careful study of all the
varying conditions, with the course nav
igated by an experienced pilot, with good
weather prevailing. Given such condi
tions there is no reason why Ross should
not be the third man in the world to
accomplish this great feat of endur
ance. He may not do it the first time,
although that is not improbable, but with
the luck of the tides with him and with
his superhuman physique he should wrest
the victory over the channel for the
honor of America and set the fastest
mark for the future swimmers of the
world to go after.
Note:—Norman Ross, '20, announced
his intention recently to attempt to
swim the English Channel. The fol
lowing is taken from an article by
T. W. Sheffield, the swimming expert,
which appeared in the Los Angeles
"Times." Sheffield thinks that the
former Stanford man is the only swim
mer alive today that can perform this
difficult feat.
Over seventy separate attempts have
been made during the last thirty-five
years to swim the English Channel. The
first success was that of Captain Webb,
who was drowned while swimming the
Niagara Rapids. On his second at
tempt on August 24 and 25, 1875, he
swam the channel in the remarkable time
of 21 hours 45 minutes, under very fa
vorable weather conditions, the sea being
quite calm, with no wind and very little
cross tides.
Captain Webb, well smeared with por
poise grease dived in from the Admiral
ty Pier, Dover, at 1 o'clock on the for
mer date, swimming westwards toward
Folkestone. The people of Calais looked
upon Webb in the light of some extraor
dinary being—half man. half fish.
The second man in the world to swim
the channel was Thomas William Bur
gess. For seven years Burgess, the
Yorkshire blacksmith, had been trying.
In that time he had made fourteen at
tempts. Over and over again he was
beaten by one unfavorable circumstance
and another—once when he got to within
a quarter of a mile of his goal.
Nothing daunted, he kept trying, and
his plucky efforts were at last rewarded,
for starting from Dover, he reached the
shore near Cape Grisnez on Wednesday,
September 8, 1911, having been in the
water nearly two rounds of the clock,
covering 60 miles in 22 hours and 35
minutes
The list of attempts to rival Captain
Webb's feat is a monument to pluck and
skill. Over and over ftgain have some
of the swimmers tried, only to have suc
cess snatched away wlien it was almost
in their grasp. Particularly notable are
the efforts of Jabez Wolffe and Mon
tague Holbein. Some of the most nota
ble attempts have been:
1901—August 24 and 25, Montague
Holbein's first attempt. Starting from
Cape Grisnez, he swam to within 5 miles
of England, and gave up. In the water
12 hours 46 minutes.
1902—July 31, Holbein started from
France, and swam for 1 hours, cover
ing about thirty miles.
1904—September 7, Burgess' first at
tempt. Swam 15 miles in eight hours in
a rough sea and gave up within six
miles of France.
1905—July 28, Burges?, swam to with
in 4y 2 miles of Calais. Was in the wa
ter for \2 l / 2 hours.
1905—August 24, Miss Annette Keller
man swam for 6 hours 22 minutes,
1907—September 16, Wolffe swam for
11K- hours and got within 2 miles of the
French coast.
1908—August 17 to 18. Burgess swam
within 1 mile of Cape Grisnez, after
swimming 50 miles in 20 hours.
1908—September 19, Wolffe swam for
