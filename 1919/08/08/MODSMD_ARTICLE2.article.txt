# Bolshiviki Seize Coyle of Stanford
## Serving as Y.M.C.A. Secretary When Captured by Reds At Chikusco 
### 
Albert F. Coyle of San Jose, Stan
ford '15, a Y. M. C. A. secretary in
Russia, was recently captured by the
Bolsheviki, together with another "Y"
man, and is now held a prisoner at Chi
kusco. Word to this effect was received
by Mrs. S. C. Coyle through the Inter
national Committee of the Y. M. C. A.
Both men are thought to be safe.
Coyle has taken an active and excit
ing part in the Y. M. C. A. war work
in Russia. It was through his efforts
that a little Russian lad about 5 years
old, the last member of a family of fa
mous Russian scientists, was adopted by
cablegram by Coyle's brother-in-law and
sister in San Jose. It is of interest to
note that this cablegram authorizing the
adoption was the first ever sent from
San Jose to Archangel, Russia. The boy
is expected daily by his new parents.
Coyle was graduated from the Stan
ford Law Department in 1915, acted as
secretary to Dr. Jordan during his col
lege course, and was a winner in inter
collegiate and Carnot debates. Upon his
graduation he was given the Yale
scholarship and was taking a theological
course when the war began. He imme
diately took service with the Y. M. C. A.
after having been rejected by the army
on account of his eye-sight. His wife,
who was Miss Margaret Kennedy of
Stanford, is now teaching in Alabama.
