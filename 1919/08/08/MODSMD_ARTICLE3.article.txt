# ALFRED COESTER TELLS OF GERMANS IN CHILE
## 
### 
Tales of German influence in Chile,
Argentina and Brazil during the war
were told by Professor Alfred Coester
of the Spanish Department of Evander
Childs' School, New York, to a good
sized audience in the Little Theater,
last Tuesday night. "Observations in
Chile, Argentina and Brazil During
the Great War," was the subject of
Professor Coester's address.
Enemy influence in Chile appeared
to "flow" largely from the beer in
dustry, and otherwise was not great,
said the speaker. He characterized
drunkenness as the curse of Chile and
stated that an employer never expect
ed to get more than four days' work
from a Chilean.
A great amount of Argentina corn

went begging during the war, accord
ing to Professor Coester, because
German ships were not available to
carry it to Germany, which had been
the principal market. The German
population in Argentina was much
better than in Chile, and consisted
largely of agents for big German con
cerns. In some places in Argentina
German propaganda was carried 011
openly.
Brazil was, of course, found to be
pro-ally by Professor Coester. Even
the German settlement in the south
ern part of the country seemed apa
thetic to the cause of the Fatherland.
Coester's observations in *the South
American republics were characterized
in his introduction as "not unofficial."
