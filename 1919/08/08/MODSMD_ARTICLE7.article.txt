# PRESENT COMMANDANT TO LEAVE R.O.T.C. IN SEPTEMBER
## MAJOR PARKER RESIGNS Great Loss Felt by Unit of Which He Has Been Efficient Head 
### 
MAJOR SAMUEL M. PARKER,
U. S. A. (Retired), will be relieved
as Commandant of the Stanford R. O.
T. C. about September Ist, as a result
of the War Department ruling that
the Reserve Officers' Corps at all uni
versities and colleges shell be con
ducted by officers on the active list
of the army.
Major Parker came here in March
1918, as professor of Military Science
and Tactics. His excellent work in
this department quickly won him
esteem of both students and faculty.
Upon his arrival he found the student
body largely depleted of the older
men, most of whom had entered into
active service. By his personal ability
as a teacher, and example as an of
ficer of high standards, Major Parker
maintained and kept up to its former
degree of efficiency the high esprit
which had existed in the Corps since
it was founded in 1917 by Major Jens
Bugge who was later a member of
General Pershing's staff, and died re
cently at West Point, just after he
had been appointed its Commandant.
During the past year, after the stu
dent community had returned to some
thing resembling peace conditions
Major Parker continued to develop
the training corps in many ways.
The Major has been devoting him
self, recently, to perfecting plans for
the work next year, which will be
featured by the new artillery unit in
connection with the already establish
ed infantry unit. He was to have been
Commandant of the combined train
ing department. University authorities
are disappointed that no exception
could be made by the War Depart
ment, to allow him to continue the
work which he has brought to such a
high stage of excellence. Announce
ment of his departure from the
campus will create a feeling of general
regret. Major Parker came here as a
Captain. He received his Majority a
few days ago. His successor as head
of the military department has not
yet been announced. The staff of as
sisting officers and enlisted men will
remain practically unchanged.
