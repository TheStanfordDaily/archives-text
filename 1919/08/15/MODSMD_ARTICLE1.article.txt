just as evil traits in the former lead to
destruction, so do evil purposes in the
latter lead to annihilation. As an ex

Germany.

necessary to any social or political
unit if it is to survive," said the speak

without regard to ethical laws lead to
annihilation. The liar or coward is
spurned by his fellows, is likely to
fail to get a mate, and his line dies
out." *
