# EASTERN PAGES STILL TALK ABOUT 1916 POUGHKEEPSIE
## WRITER TELLS OF BATTLE Stanford's Great Finish Is Recalled By Sport Writer 
### 
TIHE following article appears this
week in a number of eastern news
papers as part of a series of "high
spots in American sport" written by
Grantland Rice, the famous sporting
writer. It is especially interesting as
showing the impression that the 1918
Stanford crew made at Pouhkeepsie
on the critical east:
The Dark Shell at Poughkeepsie
This is a tale of the underdog and
the confusion of the rowing experts.
As a usual thing, the expert—and,
particularly the rowing expert—is
right, but on a bright June afternoon
the rowing experts were thrown into
utter confusion by a crew that came
from Stanford university, on the Pa
cific Coast, and churned the waters of
the Hudson with wholly unauthorized
strokes, all but winning one of the
hardest fought races ever rowed over
the Poughkeepsie course.
They rowed in 110 fashion within the

were removed and wrapped up in
blankets.
The Stanford crew had no lunch.
The youngsters had come to the race
"on their own," as the college did not
have a fund to send them to the race.
As a matter of fact, they did not have
car fare back to the coast, and were
considering putting their shell in
pawn to raise the transportation when
a California sportsman who heard of
their plight put up the money to send
them home.
No One Considered the Westerners
This Stanford crew never was con
sidered before the race. One of the
best of the rowing experts, who saw
them in practice, announced: "They
are terrible. They splash. They do
not know how to row. They have no
co-ordination. In fact, they are noth
