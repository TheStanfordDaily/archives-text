# EASTERN PAGES STILL TALK ABOUT 1916 POUGHKEEPSIE
## WRITER TELLS OF BATTLE Stanford's Great Finish Is Recalled By Sport Writer 
### 
TIHE following article appears this
week in a number of eastern news
papers as part of a series of "high
spots in American sport" written by
Grantland Rice, the famous sporting
writer. It is especially interesting as
showing the impression that the 1918
Stanford crew made at Pouhkeepsie
on the critical east:
The Dark Shell at Poughkeepsie
This is a tale of the underdog and
the confusion of the rowing experts.
As a usual thing, the expert—and,
particularly the rowing expert—is
right, but on a bright June afternoon
the rowing experts were thrown into
utter confusion by a crew that came
from Stanford university, on the Pa
cific Coast, and churned the waters of
the Hudson with wholly unauthorized
strokes, all but winning one of the
hardest fought races ever rowed over
the Poughkeepsie course.
They rowed in 110 fashion within the
Ken of the experts. They splashed
until»their shell was almost awash
with water, but at one time they had
the best crew that Cornell ever trained
headed and gasping. That was at the
three mile and a half mark. At the
finish the Stanford university crew
was just a quarter of a length behind
and creeping up.
Several of the men in the Cornell
crew collapsed at the finish. Not a
man dropped in the Stanford boat.
When they saw that the race was
finished they turned their shell around
and proceeded to row back to their
training quarters, on the upper Hud
son. The shells of the other colleges
were towed back, while the crews
were removed and wrapped up in
blankets.
The Stanford crew had no lunch.
The youngsters had come to the race
"on their own," as the college did not
have a fund to send them to the race.
As a matter of fact, they did not have
car fare back to the coast, and were
considering putting their shell in
pawn to raise the transportation when
a California sportsman who heard of
their plight put up the money to send
them home.
No One Considered the Westerners
This Stanford crew never was con
sidered before the race. One of the
best of the rowing experts, who saw
them in practice, announced: "They
are terrible. They splash. They do
not know how to row. They have no
co-ordination. In fact, they are noth
ing. Their boat is old fashioned. Thev
might learn to row in a couple of
years, for they are big and strong;
but right now they are impossible."
Consequently when the race started
partisans of Cornell, Columbia, Syra
cuse and Pennsylvania were watching
their boat closely. Syracuse got
away with a flying start. An ugly, un
kept shell forged into second place,
flying a maroon pennant with the
letter Sin the stern. The men in
this boat were rowing grotesquely and
atrociously.
"What funny looking outfit is that?"
somebody asked.
"Oh, that must be the Stanford
crew," was replied. "Early speed.
They won't finish anyway."
Yet when the Syracuse crew began
to weary and the Cornell crew forged
ahead the ugly Stanford shell still
clung to second place. One of the
men seemed to the rowing with his
chin on his knees. Others assumed
positions they seemed to fancy. Each
man seemed to be rowing his own in
dividual stroke. Yet the net result
was steady power that kept the Stan
ford crew abreast of the best that
Cornell ever sent to Poughkeepsie.
And at the three and a half-mile mark
for a few palpitating seconds the Stan
ford crew was leading Syracuse, with
the others out of it altogether.
Syracuse developed a spurt and it
closed with the Stanford crew just a
quarter of a length behind the winning
shell.
Trained In a Mud Lake
Afterwards C. H. Orme, who was
No. 6 of the Stanford crew, said: "We
were not familiar with the course, as
we were only over it once. We
thought we had half a mile or more to
go and were lying back waiting for
the call for a spurt. We had plenty of
spurt in us. We were not a bit tired
at the finish."
Training facilities for crews at Stan
ford university are meager. The crews
train in a little half mile mud lake
near the university. San Francisco
bay is too far from the grounds and,
moreover, San Francisco bay is too
rough for shells. More than once the
Stanford and University of California
crews have been swamped trying to
race in the Oakland estuary, an arm
of the bay. Once the crews of both
colleges finished swimming.
Orme himself had come from Ari
zona and had never seen a body of
water big enough to bathe in until he
attended Stanford university. Then
the rowing coach came to him and
gave him an oar. He captained the
Stanford crew the following year, but
this crew did not come to the Hudson.
When the Poughkeepsie course is
restored to its own and the regattas
are there again they will tell the tale
anew of the Stanford crew that
churned the Hudson and had the row
ing experts on the verge of heart
failure.
