# HONOR AND PHONEY DECORATIONS
## 
### 
I>OTH by law and by custom, American soldiers and officers have in the past
been forbidden to wear foreign decorations, but in the recent war this tradi
tion, with many others, was put aside. From General Pershing down to the buck
private in the rear rank, our fighting men are now permitted to receive and wear
the emblems of distinguished service bestowed on them by our Allies.
Americans at home are proud of the symbols of bravery our soldiers are
bringing back, but as each boat load of these returning overseas men is shunted
westward it is becoming more and more apparent to the public that all pretty
ribbons are not emblematic of bravery and zeal, that all service chevrons are not
significant of service, and that many a kahki-clad American is a hero only in his
own mind. People are rapidly becoming wise to the fact that most of the men
who wear the uniform the after receiving their discharge papers and
who sport a row or two of colored ribbons proudly on their chests are but phoney
heroes and deserve no honor.
It is unfortunate for those who have really performed a service, and especially
for those who would otherwise wear with pride their Distinguished Service
Crosses, Croix de Guerres, or Legion d' Honneurs. They know that but few civ
ilians are able to distinguish the real from the nongenuine, and consequently
choose to leave their hard-earned symbols of reward at home. When return
ing soldiers first began to promiscuously bedeck themselves with chevrons and
ribbons, they were merely stealing honor from the public, for both they and
the real heroes were feted, but the people have now become, so distrustful that
the credit is purloined from those who rightfully merit it. It i\ too bad that some
measures can not be taken to stop this flaunting of ribbons of every color on the
uniform, for Americans would like to be able to tell a real hero from a pretender
and to be able to bestow credit where it belongs.
