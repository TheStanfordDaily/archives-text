# DON'T LET IT FIZZLE

### 
A CONSIDERABLE amount of money and energy has recently been expended
on equipment for the Department of Military Science and Tactics established
at Stanford. While it seems to many that this is a sort of "locking the stable
after the hose has been stolen" policy, the need for preparation is just as
strong as it was several years ago. People do not look upon the uniform with
quite the same feeling that they did when the nation was at war, and college men
naturally are not overenthusiastic about drill and the study of artillery tire. How
ever, Stanford can not afford to fail in its support of the Military Department.
The men must still feel it a duty to learn something of the ways of a soldier.
Not to use the splendid equipment now at the University's disposal would be
foolish and ungrateful. It is not every university that can give a graduate a
certificate which entitles him to a Reserve Officer's commission in the United
States Army, and the time may come when the present generation Stanford stu
dents will be thankful for the military training offered in college.
