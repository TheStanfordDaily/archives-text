# BEHRENS UNDER OPERATION
## 
### 
E. C. Behrens, former Stanford
graduate manager, is recovering in
the Letterman Hospital, San Fran
cisco, from serious internal injuries
he received in three motor accidents
while serving with the American
forces in Siberia. His life at one time
was dispaired of.
Behrens, better known to the camp
us community as "Squier" Behrens,
was invalided home from Siberia sev
eral weeks ago. His injuries were re
ceived as the result of two motorcycle
accidents and one automobile accident.
In all three accidents the vehicles

I were being driven without lights in
compliance with an army regulation.
Behrens was not operated upon un
til he reached San Francisco. He
then underwent a major operation,
but it was thought for a time that
even the operation would not save his
life. His vitality has practically over
come his sitkness, however, and it is
now expected that he will be able to
take a vacation in a short time.
Squire was doing work in the evacu
ation of men and supplies in Siberia
when he met with the three acci-
I dents.
