# MAN AND MONKEYS FROM SAME STOCK: DR. JORDAN

### Clytie Sweet, '21 
"The great work of Darwin lay in
showing that species or kinds of ani
mals and plants were derived from pre
existing forms through natural causes,"
said Dr. Jordan in an informal talk on
"Darwinism" at his home last week.
"One of these, hitherto unrecognized,
is natural selection—the survival of
those who are adapted to conditions of
life, leaving with time a like-minded suc
cession of descendants. In the origin
of every near species, at least four ele
ments must co-operate—variation, her
edity, segregation, and selection."
No two individuals are ever alike,
Dr. Jordan explained, and of the mul
titude of variations, vome of which are
most favorable, occur, and by heredity
arc preserved. Species may be separated
by barriers into twin forms or gemi
nate specics. This is the basis of "Jor
dan's Law" so named by Dr. J. A. Allen,
which is: The nearest relative of any

spccies is found not with it. nor far from
it, but across some barrier which has di
vided its ancestors into segregated
groups.
"Everything lives that can." the doc
tor went on to say, in reference to se
lection. "And every individual must sub
mit to three competitions: (1) Com
petition with his own kind; (2) compe
tition with his own kind, (2) competition
with other kinds, and 03) competition in
the hard conditions of life. The life of
each, man included, fit his surroundings
as a river fits its bed; if not, then he
dies."
Three ways for finding out scientifi
cally the origin of man or any other type
were mentioned—embryology, anatomy,
paleontology. It is under the study of
these that Darwin deduced his findings,
not that man was derived from the
monkey, but that monkey, ape, and man
sprung from a common stock, not like
any of these as we know them now.
