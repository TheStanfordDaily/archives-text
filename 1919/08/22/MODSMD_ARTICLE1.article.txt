### 
T\R. LEWIS M. TERMAN, professor
of education, recently returned from
service in the Surgeon General's office,
spoke in the Little Theatre Wednesday
night on "Psychological Tests in the
Army." Professor Terman held the
rank of major in the army. Since May,
1918, he has been in the Surgeon Gen
eral's department in charge of special
section on psychological methods of the
psychological division. He was a mem
ber of the committee on classification of
personnel which worked in co-operation
with the Adjutant General's office, and
of the Committee on Psychological Ex
amination of Recruits.
A Committee on Classification of the
Personnel provided a means for getting
detailed information as to vocational
ability of soldiers, and devised systems
of tests for vocational skill. Through
this committee's devices a quarter million
men were "trade tested." A part of this
system was a card catalogue system on
which the qualifications of each man
were noted. Wherever lie went, each
man was accompanied by his qualifica
tion card. By means of their work
in this direction the committee supplied
1,000,000 requisitions for men of special
skill.
Another line in which Professor Ter
man engaged and which he discussed
was the psychological examination of
recruits. Methods were devised which
made possible group examinations in lots
of 200 or 300 men. One test was pro
vided for literate men and another for
the illiterate. In addition to the group
examinations, individuals who went spe
cially low were later given individual

examinations. There were more than
100,000 in this class, more than half of
whom took the Stanford-Binet test.
