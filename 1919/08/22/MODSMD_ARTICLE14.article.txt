"Plots and Playwrights" is to be
staged Monday night at the Women's
Clubhouse by Miss Buckingham's class in
Play Producing, and it promises to be
produced with a finish of staging that
will rival that of similar plays produced
last quarters under the direction of Pro
fessor Bassctt.
Under the direction of the class mem
bers themselves the various scenes are
managed and staged. Miss Margaret
Shedd, '20, is in charge of one scene.

Mortimer Kline ,'2l, Miss Dorcas Davis,
'18, and Oliver Kisich, '20, and Miss
Anna Franklin, '20, of other scenes.
As a satire on the melodramatic ten
dency of Broadway and crook plays
in general, action of the play centers
around an argument between a suc
cessful playwright, who is a romanticist,
and a short-story writer who is a real
ist. A wager is made by the story
writer that he can write a play about
every story in the house. There are
three stories. In the second scene the
playwright has turned the stories into
melodrama, and much shooting, action,
and tears is displayed.
Interesting changes of characterization
is shown in the second part of the play,
and many complicating and amusing sit
uations arc provided to keep the audi
ence in laughter.
Change in the date from to-day was
made because of a meeting of the Philo
logical Club at the clubhouse, at which
meeting Professor Winifred Smith of
Vassar will read a paper.
