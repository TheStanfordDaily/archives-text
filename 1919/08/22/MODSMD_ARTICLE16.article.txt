# A
						PLACE FOR THE "EX" STUDENT
## 
### 
ALTHOUGH the condition exists not exclusively at Stanford, it is more
pronounced here, a condition that gives the graduate a definite place, the
present member of the Uuniversity a certain status, but leave the former
Stanford student who did not graduate, out in the cold. Men and
who attended Stanford for a certain time, but were unable to finish, are
just as loyal supporters of the Cardinal as those who have a diploma, and
will be as enthusiastic as those who now decorate the bleachers as present
members of the student body. When a man is referred to as Mr. so and
so, ex-Stanford man, it almost attaches a stigma to his name. To be sure,
there are those who leave under pressure, and there are those also whose
names it would be better were they not connected with that of the University,
but these are in a small minority. The big majority of Stanford men and
women who have attended the University and who are unable to finish there
work here, are worthy of the Stanford name, and there should be some link
connecting them with the University.
As they are not members of the Alumni Association, and obviously can
not be, they are not eligible to attend its meetings. They do not pay Alumni
dues, so do not get the "Stanford Illustrated Review," and they are soon lost
to Stanford because of a lack of connection with the University. One of
Stanford's failings has been its lack of Alumni support. When a very young
university, this was natural, but it is coming to a time, when thousands of old
Stanford men should feel a keen interest in the University, as is the case
with other colleges in the East. It would be wise to throw open member
ship in the Alumni Association to these former students, if no other remedy
is suggested, for Stanford needs the support of its ex-students, and they
should rightfully have a place in the affairs of the University.
