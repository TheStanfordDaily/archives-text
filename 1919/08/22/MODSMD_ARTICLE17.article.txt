# THE
						LAST WEEKLY
## 
### 
" ion is the last of the weekly issues. Publishing the student
g the summer quarter has been an experiment, it has not been
Stanford, and we hope a successful one. The paper has been
nt activity on the campus, and has attempted to help the mem
immer colony realize that the Stanford summer school is not
such, in tho useful sense of the word, but that it is one of the regular
university quarters, an integral part of the Stanford quarter system, and an
institution of growing interest and popularity. The Daily Palo Alto will
resume publication on October Ist, Registration Day of the fall quarter.
