# WHEREFORE NOT: A 'GLIK' COMEBACK

### A. Sam Glikbarg 
I was awakened yesterday afternoon
from a nap that I was taking (I forget
where I was taking it) by a violent
noise, something exceedingly unordinary
in this town, which seems to be in the
throes of a lethargy or in the throes
of a dilemma, or some somulence or
somnolcnce, or insomnia. Since none
of the above means anything much, you
can write your own ticket.
Being awakened I opened my eyes,
which I had closed to make the sleep
more thorough, and rubbed them dili
gently with my right fore finger.
"Strange," I said, "some one seems to
be awake in this helmet" (or is it ham
let) "and it is only 3 o'clock in the
afternoon. This must be looked into."
I went out onto the street and noticed
a tremendous crowd of at least eighteen
people rushing hither and yon, and even
thither. Yes, I am safe in saying that
it was rushing hither, thither, and yon,
and one or two were even running here
and there. I suppose also that the crowd
was surging a little bit; since the best
literary crowds always surge, some more
than others.
Let me say without further delay that
I am in a small town. I might almost
say a minute town. My train stopped
here to get water while it was on its
way some place else, but since there was
no water here it didn't get any, and
since they couldn't go on without it I am
here yet. The other passenger on the
train also got off. Allow me to say
here and now and before it rolls off
my mind, that there is a food shortage
here. The reason is that the unexpected
and almost surprising arrival of myself
and fellow passenger caused it. The
populace hadn't expected any guests, but
they arc patriotically sharing their sur
plse (plural of surplus) with us. That
caused the shortage.
The town ii exceedingly peaceful. A
Sneeze is equivalent to a breach of the
peace, and a cough recalls in the older
minds the days of old man Lynch and
of the Inquisition. Automobiles are
unknown and bread is still a nickel a
loaf. Eggs are fifteen cents a dozen
and shoes are two semoleons a pair.
There is therefore an opportunity to
lay in a supply, and 1 would be doing
it, except for the minor fact that there
are none of the above things to be had
except at higher prices.
1 lead an exciting and vigorous life,
but somehow find it impossible to ob
tain more than twenty or twenty-one
hours sleep per diem. The only other
thing 1 do is to absorb three meals; all
while I am awake.
Might I not add that 1 have made a
discovery? I found out that by trotting
six miles into the country at midnight
and then by turning sharply to the left,
and by thence beating it up a back alley
one comes to a low-roofed hut. One
enters and discovers what usta was a
bar, but which has discontinued to be
same. By brazenly advancing upon it
and winking a wicked wink with the
left eye, meanwhile keeping the right
one shut, one can gain the custodian's
attention. One then holds his left la
pel and utters the. mysterious word,
"Okum," and orders ginger ale. When
the concoction arrives one finds that it
is only one-half ginger ale. The other
half is water. So altho one doesn't gain
one's self anything, one lias a awful
mysterious time of one's evening. Where
upon 1 will quit for one day.
