# Martin Praises Brazil in War
## "Past and Present Day Brazil," Is Title of Lecture 
### 
"As a striking testimony to the vi
tality of Pan-American solidarity the
participation of Brazil in the Great
World War has been of incalculable
value." In these words Professor P.
A. Martin of the Department of His
tory, lecturing last evening in the
Little Theater on "Past and Present-
Day Brazil," stated what he believes
to be a significant result of that re
public's alliance with the United
States and the Associated Powers.
The speaker traced the history of
Brazil in some detail and said that
from the beginning of the war it was
clear to which side the sympathies of
the Brazilians would incline. He made
reference to the Brazilian League for
the Allies and its distinguished presi
dent* Ruy Barbosa, one of Brazil's
most noted statesmen, who voiced the
nation's attitude when he said, "None
can be an indifferent spectator in this
world-tragedy. Between those who
destroy the law and those who uphold
it neutrality is not permissable."
The revocation of neutrality and
Brazil's ultimate declaration of war
against German, continued the speak
er, were rightly regarded as events
of deep signifiieance in the traditional
friendship between the South Ameri
can Republic and the United States.
Brazil's participation in the war had
brought her into even closer and more
friendly relations with the American
people and the recent visit to Wash
ington of President Pessoa was to be
considered as most gratifying.
By means of an excellent series of
colored slides which Professor Martin
took himself while in Brazil his audi
ence was carried through some of the
most picturesque provinces of a tro
pically luxuriant country.
