# League of Nations An Ancient Ideal
## Educational Leader Gives League History in Club House Address 
### 
Emphasizing the historical back
ground of the League of Nations,
which was not the idea of a demo
cratic president, but the out-growth
of a civilization, Mrs. Nelly Hall Root,
of Long Reach, gave a comprehensive
talk on the history and the develop
ment of the league of nations, before
an enthusiastic •■audience at the Wo
men's Club House, Monday night.
Progressing from the geneology of
federation, Mrs. Root took up the
Amphictyonic council of the Greeks,
and the federations of the Romans
and Mohammedans, which were based
on self-preservation. Hugo Grotius'
work was reviewed, as was also done
with that of Abbe de St. Pierre, in his
"Project for Perpetual Peace" which
appeared in 1713. William Penn, and
even Emerson appeared in her review,
as having fundamental ideals of a
league of nations.
During the later day progress of the
world federation idea the part of the
"Holy Alliance" and the Hague tri
bunal was dwelt with. Rapid transi
tion was made to Tal't's endeavors, and
finally the general outcome was
reached in the proposal of Senator
Lodge, and the present form of the
league of nations.
"International needs brought into
common usage international methods
of service, and have educated the
people to think and speak in terms
of internationalism, a thing wholly
new in the history of human experi
ence," said Mrs. Root.
An interesting discussion followed
the talk on the question as to the pro
posed restriction of the Japanese im
migration.
