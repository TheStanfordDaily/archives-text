twice out of three tries. In 1917 he
produced an eleven that made the
highest total score in the south, 629
points being scored against nothing
by his opponents. Five teams were
beaten by over 100 points a game.
While at Boonesboro, Acker pro
duced Birks, who made the S. A. T. C.
team at Perduce and pronounced by
Stagg Yost and other famous coaches,
as the best full back in the Big "9,"
and also Bartlett and Snoddy, both of
whom played on the S. A. T. C. team
at the University of Kentucky and
were picked for the All-Southern
eleven.
Enthusiastic reports of the work of
the California babes are being reported
in the city papers, but Evans says:
"I have nothing to say at this stage of
the game, but you watch Acker, and if
anybody can turn the trick, he is the
man."

track. While attending Milliken, Acker
played quarter back on the football
team, all-star forward on the basket
ball team each year he was in col
lege, and held the Little "18" Confer
ence record in the quarter and half
mile.
Acker took the coaching job at

Boonesboro, Ky., high school, when
Evans left, and took the state title
in basketball for three years straight.
His football team won the state title
twice out of three tries. In 1917 he
produced an eleven that made the
highest total score in the south, 629
points being scored against nothing
by his opponents. Five teams were
beaten by over 100 points a game.
While at Boonesboro, Acker pro
duced Birks, who made the S. A. T. C.
team at Perduce and pronounced by
Stagg Yost and other famous coaches,
as the best full back in the Big "9,"
and also Bartlett and Snoddy, both of
whom played on the S. A. T. C. team
at the University of Kentucky and
were picked for the All-Southern
eleven.
Enthusiastic reports of the work of
the California babes are being reported
in the city papers, but Evans says:
"I have nothing to say at this stage of
the game, but you watch Acker, and if
anybody can turn the trick, he is the
man."
