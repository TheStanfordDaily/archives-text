# AS TO STUDENT CONTROL
## 
### 
CJTUDENT control will again come before the students for discussion at the
first student body assembly to be held on Monday. The first question is:
Do we want student control? Most certainly we do. The fact that Stan
ford students made and enforced their own rules, and justly passed on cases
brought before the disciplinary committee was once the pride of all Cardinal
supporters, but now the faculty, not only makes but enforces the University
rules as regards students, and thru the Student Affairs Committee, punishes
the offenders. We most certainly want the control back where it belongs,
in the students' hands. But we don't want to see a system again putin
that will leave a loophole for the scheming politicians, (and we probably
still have them), to turn student control into clique control.
The student body president, F. Le√üoy King, '19, will present a plan at the
meeting on Monday that is worthy of the serious consideration of every
Stanford man. It is the outcome of considerable thought on the part of
some twenty students, and, if adopted, will probably give Stanford what
it needs, a sane rule by the students, and a closer cooperation between the
administration and the students than is now the case. If the real Stanford
spirit, that must burn in the hearts of every Stanford man, can be aroused,
the proposed plan that will make the senior class morally responsible for the
actions of the remainder of the student body, and will give all disciplinary
powers into the hands of the Universiyt President and a committee selected
by this class, will prove a decided success.
