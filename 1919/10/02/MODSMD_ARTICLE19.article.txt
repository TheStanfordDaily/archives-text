# REGISTRATION IN WOMEN'S ATHLETICS REACHES 300 MARK
## 
### 
Women's athletics have started off
with an enthusiasm that has not been
seen here for several years, over three
hundred having signed up to date, and
a line still in front of the gymnasium
waiting for admittance to classes.
Sports this year will be divided into
autumn, winter, and spring, the fall
sports taking in all outdoor athletics,
such as hockey, tennis, swimming, and
dancing. Winter athletics will be the
formal gymnastics and basketball, and
in spring sports crew and baseball are
scheduled. Under the new system, as
inaugurated by Miss Bunting, the new
head of the department, hockey teams
will be divided according to class stand
ing, and a final tournament will be
played before the last of the quarter to
determine the winning class. No ar
rangements have as yet been made as
to determine a varsity team.
Another innovation of Miss Bunting's
consists in the requirement of a physical
examination by every girl who partici
pates in athletics of any nature. Here
tofore this was required of freshman
students only, but it will apply to both
upperclass and underclass students
alike this year. Miss Ethel M. Owen
of San Francisco will conduct the ex
amination. Miss Owen is a Stanford
graduate of both the academic and med
ical schools, and has been'active in work
in France during the war.
Archery will not be taught, due to the
lack of equipment, having been post
poned indefinitely, the shipments from
the east being uncertain as to their ar
rival. Fencing may be taken up this
year, provided enough girls signify their
intention, and arrangements will be
made to secure a competent instructor.
Sports and athletic work have been
divided as to their relative rank of
major or minor sport, and according to
the new ruling, out of the six required
quarters, two quarters will be sport, two
quarters formal gymnastic, one quarter
swimming, and one quarter dancing.
Assisting Miss Bunting are Miss Yoland
Allen, who will be in charge of dancing;
Mrs. E. Brandsten, swimming; and
Miss Whitmore, secretary.

quarters formal gymnastic, one quarter
swimming, and one quarter dancing.
Assisting Miss Bunting are Miss Yoland
Allen, who will be in charge of dancing;
