# Cincinnati Wins Second Game, 4-2
## 
### 
Wiklness on the part of Claude Wil
liams, the White Sox twirler, caused
the loss of the second game of the
World Series to the Cincinnati Reds.
The score was 2 to 4. Sallee, the
heaver for the Reds, was hit freely
but particularly clever defensive work
on the part of the Cincinnati club
prevented further scoring on the part
of the Chicago nine. Rousli, the fast
center-fielder of the Reds was the
fielding star of the game.
The first three innings of the con
test no scores were made by either
club, but in the fourth inning Cincin
nati broke the ice by putting three
runs across the plate. Williams' wild
ness putting men on bases, followed
by base hits allowed the runs. The
Reds scored their addtiional run in
the sixth inning while the two scores
of the White Sox were made in the
crucial seventh. The Sox piled up a

total of ten hits off the delivery of
Sallee but were unable to obtain more
than two runs. Williams was stingy
with the hits, allowing only four hits.
The scene of the contest shifts to
morrow to Chicago, at Cumiskey Park.
It is expected that thousands will
be on hand at this first contest on the
home grounds of the White Sox, and
many look for the Chicago nine to
stage a comeback. Urban Faber will
probably be Gleason's selection of a
twirler for the initial contest on the
Windy City nine, "Pat" Moran's se
lection is hard for the dopesters to
figure out, but a majority seem to
favor Eller for the job.
The score:

Chicago 2 10 1
Cincinnati 4 4 2
Batteries: Williams and Schalk;
