# Republican Club to be Formed Here
## 
### 
Stanford is going to have a word to
say in the matter of .national politics.
This was made certain to-day by the an
nouncement that within the month a per
manent Stanford Republican Club is to
be organized upon the campus. The club
is to consist of all adherents of the Re
publican party who are students at Stan
ford.
The instigators of this new organiza
tion are a group of Stanford students
who gained their inspiration from a re
mark made by President Wilson in San
Francisco recently that college students
do not take enough interest in politics—
national or local. The organizers an
nounce that it is their intention hereafter
to take an interest in politics.
Formal organization will take place
probably on October 24. Arrangements
already have been made with Raymond
Benjamin, regional assistant to Will
Hayes, who is national chairman of the
Republican party, to come down from
San Francisco on that date and assist in
the organization of the new club. Ben
jamin also is chief deputy attorney gen
eral.
The immediate purpose of the organi
zation of the club will be to prepare for
jhe coming national election. It is not
the intention for the local organization to

advocate any candidates of its own selec
tion, but it will lend its efforts to the elec
tion of candidates nominated and en
dorsed by the Republican party. The
club will be affiliated with the State Cen
tral Republican Committee and will work
in conjunction with that organization.
The students who have fostered the
idea are L. S. Barnes, '18. A. T. George,
'20, G. P. Wood, '20, C. C. Crosby, 19,
C. O. Fenlason, '19, and B. J. Harris, '20.
These men feel that it is a duty of col
lege students to take a part in national
politics. As one of them said yesterday:
"It is the business of college men and
women to have an interest in national
politics. The club will not be alone for
men, but the women students of the Uni
versity will be urged to affiliate witli the
organization if they are interested in the
Republican cause."
No announcement lias come from
Democratic adherents as yet, but it is ex
pected that the supporters of the ad
ministration will take the present an
nouncement as a challenge and accept it
by the formation of a Democratic Club
on the campus.

advocate any candidates of its own selec
tion, but it will lend its efforts to the elec
tion of candidates nominated and en
dorsed by the Republican party. The
club will be affiliated with the State Cen
tral Republican Committee and will work
in conjunction with that organization.
The students who have fostered the
idea are L. S. Barnes, '18. A. T. George,
'20, G. P. Wood, '20, C. C. Crosby, 19,
C. O. Fenlason, '19, and B. J. Harris, '20.
These men feel that it is a duty of col
lege students to take a part in national
politics. As one of them said yesterday:
"It is the business of college men and
women to have an interest in national
politics. The club will not be alone for
men, but the women students of the Uni
versity will be urged to affiliate witli the
organization if they are interested in the
Republican cause."
No announcement lias come from
Democratic adherents as yet, but it is ex
pected that the supporters of the ad
ministration will take the present an
nouncement as a challenge and accept it
by the formation of a Democratic Club
on the campus.
Stanford is going to have a word to
say in the matter of .national politics.
This was made certain to-day by the an
nouncement that within the month a per
manent Stanford Republican Club is to
be organized upon the campus. The club
is to consist of all adherents of the Re
publican party who are students at Stan
ford.
The instigators of this new organiza
tion are a group of Stanford students
who gained their inspiration from a re
mark made by President Wilson in San
Francisco recently that college students
do not take enough interest in politics—
national or local. The organizers an
nounce that it is their intention hereafter
to take an interest in politics.
Formal organization will take place
probably on October 24. Arrangements
already have been made with Raymond
Benjamin, regional assistant to Will
Hayes, who is national chairman of the
Republican party, to come down from
San Francisco on that date and assist in
the organization of the new club. Ben
jamin also is chief deputy attorney gen
eral.
The immediate purpose of the organi
zation of the club will be to prepare for
jhe coming national election. It is not
the intention for the local organization to

advocate any candidates of its own selec
tion, but it will lend its efforts to the elec
tion of candidates nominated and en
dorsed by the Republican party. The
club will be affiliated with the State Cen
tral Republican Committee and will work
