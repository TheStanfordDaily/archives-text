MAJOR S. M. PARKER, at present in
charge of the Stanford R. O. T. C.
under War Department orders, an
nounced to-day that unless a minimum
registration of 100 men it. both the artil
lery and infantry units was secured, the
government would have to abandon the
military department at Stanford. Sixty
men enrolled yesterday in the infantry
unit.
For the fulfillment of the underclass
requirement of physical or military train
ing three hours of work per week is
required, but the underclassman, accord
ing to Major Parker, may take a theoret
ical course of two hours per week and
receive one hour of university credit in
addition to working off the requirement.
Upperclassmen may take these courses
and receive three hours of university
credit.
The three-hour course will be of a
basic nature and will consist this quar
ter in drills, musketry practice with both
rifles and pistols, and the fundamentals
of military etiquette. The theoretical
course will take up mapping and will look
:nto the military iiiciory Ci me lecciii
war. The military department believes
that its program this quarter will be the
most attractive it has ever offered.
Among the sixty-four horses fur
nished by the government for the use of
the artillery unit, there is a string of ten
polo ponies. It is the intention of
Colonol L. P. Collins, who is in charge
of the artillery unit, to form a Stanford
polo team. These horses are from the
government remount station at Camp
Kearney, and the ponies appear to be ex
ceptionally fast. 'Inhere are twenty-five
other artillery units in other American
colleges, and competition for the Stan
ford polo enthusiasts will be furnished
by them. Intercollegiate polo, if it is
adopted, will be an innovation in the field
of sport.
