# NORMAN ROSS MAY SHOW PROWESS HERE
## Swimming Coach Brandsten Striving to Arrange Exhibition Match 
### 
Norman Ross, champion middle-dis
tance swimmer of the world, may give
an exhibition here, Saturday afternoon,
before he leaves for Honolulu. Swim
ming Coach Ernst Brandsten plans to
secure the appearance of the ex-army
expert over the phone this afternoon.
Ross is at present in San Francisco,
where he is scheduled to contest in
several events which will take place
at Neptune and Idora Park. He will
also act as judge in the San Francisco
Examiner's Golden Gate swim, which
occurs shortly.
One other attempt was made by
Brandsten to secure Ross for an ex
hibition here two years ago. The
swimming champion was at that time
attending the ground school for avi
ators at Berkeley. He promised to
come here on a Wednesday afternoon,
but telephoned at the last minute that
he was unable to secure leave long
enough to fulfill his engagement. Many
spectators, who had already assembled
for the event, were disappointed. Ross,
however, promised to appear the fol
lowing Saturday afternoon instead.
Again he did not putin an appearance,
and it was discovered that he had
broken leave the night before and was
under arrest.
According to Brandsten, he made a
vow to make no more efforts to se
cure the army champion's services.
Ross is, however, the biggest figure in
the swimming world today, and thanks
to his proximity, the chances of get
ting him to come this time seem un-
usually good.
Ross, not only won tli French swim
ming classic, the Siene swim, at the
Inter-Allied games in France, hut also
annexed all six of the other distance
swimming events. Besides his recent
feats, the Portland swimmer is the
world's champion in the 220, 440, 500,
and 880 yard swims.
Since his return to America, Ross
has been suffering with ptomaine poi
soning, and has only entered one event
up to date, a 100-yard dash. He fin
ished third in the contest, in spite of
his disability. He is now fully recover
ed. and will leave the early part of
next week for Honolulu, to contest in
the swimming championships to be
held there.
Experts maintain that Ross is the
only man living who can accomplish
the channel swim. He will make the
attempt in the near future.
Opportunity to see such a wonder
ful swimmer in action comes but sel
dom, and that is the reason Brand
sten will make every effort to have
him appear here before he sails.

has been suffering with ptomaine poi
soning, and has only entered one event
up to date, a 100-yard dash. He fin
ished third in the contest, in spite of
his disability. He is now fully recover
ed. and will leave the early part of
next week for Honolulu, to contest in
the swimming championships to be
held there.
Experts maintain that Ross is the
only man living who can accomplish
the channel swim. He will make the
attempt in the near future.
Opportunity to see such a wonder
ful swimmer in action comes but sel
dom, and that is the reason Brand
sten will make every effort to have
him appear here before he sails.
Norman Ross, champion middle-dis
tance swimmer of the world, may give
an exhibition here, Saturday afternoon,
before he leaves for Honolulu. Swim
ming Coach Ernst Brandsten plans to
secure the appearance of the ex-army
expert over the phone this afternoon.
Ross is at present in San Francisco,
where he is scheduled to contest in
several events which will take place
at Neptune and Idora Park. He will
also act as judge in the San Francisco
Examiner's Golden Gate swim, which
occurs shortly.
One other attempt was made by
Brandsten to secure Ross for an ex
hibition here two years ago. The
swimming champion was at that time
attending the ground school for avi
ators at Berkeley. He promised to
come here on a Wednesday afternoon,
but telephoned at the last minute that
he was unable to secure leave long
enough to fulfill his engagement. Many
spectators, who had already assembled
for the event, were disappointed. Ross,
however, promised to appear the fol
lowing Saturday afternoon instead.
Again he did not putin an appearance,
and it was discovered that he had
broken leave the night before and was
under arrest.
According to Brandsten, he made a
vow to make no more efforts to se
cure the army champion's services.
Ross is, however, the biggest figure in
the swimming world today, and thanks
to his proximity, the chances of get
ting him to come this time seem un-
usually good.
Ross, not only won tli French swim
ming classic, the Siene swim, at the
Inter-Allied games in France, hut also
annexed all six of the other distance
swimming events. Besides his recent
feats, the Portland swimmer is the
world's champion in the 220, 440, 500,
and 880 yard swims.
Since his return to America, Ross
