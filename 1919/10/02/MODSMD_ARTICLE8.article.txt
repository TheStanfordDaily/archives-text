# R. LINDLEY MURRAY TO OFFER TENNIS TROPHY FOR OPEN COMPETITION
## 
### 
To inspire the tennis players bearing
the Cardinal colors to greater efforts,
Richard Linclley Murray, 1917 patriotic
champion, and 1918 national champion
of the United States, has offered a
splendid silver trophy for competition
among the students. "Lin" Murray
was first player at Stanford for four
yea r s and captained p very success
ful season against California. He has
taken a good deal of interest in the
activities of the tennis team and feels
that some form of inspiration was
necessary to arouse the proper spirit,
hence the trophy which is to be known
as the "R. Lindley Murray trophy."
The cup will be placed in the hands
of Paul Kinney, Varsity captain-elect,
and will be competed for each fall
until won three times, not necessarily
in succession, by a student of the Uni
versity. In view of the fact that the
cup must be won three times, fresh
men will be allowed to compete and
a line on the teams can be had for
the coming meet with California the
following spring.
This year's competition in the net
game will be very keen as all the
members of the freshman team of
'22 who played the "S" upholders
nearly even, adds interest as to the
possible outcome of the meet, and
it is very hard to pick the first name
