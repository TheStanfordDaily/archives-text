# DECISION IN THE POSTER FIGHT GOES TO SOPHOMORES
## CLASH COMES ON ROW AT 3:30 A.M. Argument Under Upperclass Direction Is Entirely Successful 
### 
OEVERELY handicapped by superior
numbers, the sophomores were last
night able to lay a sufficient number
of the black-bordered posters and to
protect them effectively enough, to
receive the decision in the 1922-1923
poster rush, is the concensus of opini
on rendered by tue majority of the
committee in charge, Chairman C. S.
Davis, '20, announced this morning.
The members of the new freshman
class were no feeble antagonists, how
ever, and in the clash on the row
early this morning they demonstrated
a prowess which should develop into
a formidable organization in the near
future.
The contest last night differed from
previous fights in that it was con
ducted more under the guidance of
the upperclassmen. The sophomores
assembled near Lagunita, while the
freshmen were led to a camp in the
proximity of Frenchman's Tower. The
two forces were directed against each
other and met about 3:30 this morn
ing. Good clashes resulted on the
lawns of the Kappa Alpha Theta and
Alpha Phi houses, where, in many
cases, the members of the two parties
cooled their victims under the same
water tap. The contest was featured
by many good individual arguments.
The choice of convenient lawns as
battle grounds was somewhat limited
by inconsiderate action of some house
managers, who turned off the water
on their premises.
The poster rush as conducted was
entirely satisfactory, and the new
rules were particularly observed.
