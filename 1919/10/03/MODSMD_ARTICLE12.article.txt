### 
Jj 1 L. KING, president of the Asso
* dated Students, has called a student
body assembly for next Monday at 11
o'clock. Problems affecting both men
and women in the University will be
touched upon by prominent leaders on
the campus, and every attempt will be
made to give the entering student a new
viewpoint on university activities and
campus life.
Miss Ruth Searcy, '20, will speak for
the women. In a few words she will
touch on the campus activities for the
women and will tell as nearly as possible
what is expected of them for the coming
year, discussing a few plans.
W. I. Ames, '19, the student manager,
will make a financial report and will
outline in some detail some of the ath
letic plans for the coming year. Con
siderable interest should be shown in
what Mr. Ames has to say, according
to athletic men on the campus, because
Stanford is starting out on a new era in
athletics. This year will see the return
of the big game with California and
athletic relations will be of more im
portance than ever before.
N. H. Petree, '19, editor of the Daily
Palo Alto, will speak on campus publi
cations. He will outline the new policy
for the papers this year and will explain
some of the difficulties which have had
to be faced in the absence of men who
were expected back.
Student control will be one of the
most important topics of the morning
assembly. President King will present
the work which has been accomplished
in the last year and will explain how in
the near future the question will be set
tled if possible.
Every effort will be made to get the
students out to this assembly as it will
be considered as one of the most im
portant of the year.
