# WHITE SOX WALLOP REDS 3-0
## 
### 
Kerr's phenomenal pitching was
responsible for the Chicago White
Sox defeating the Cincinnati Reds in
the third game of the World's Series,
today, by the score of 3 to 0. Pat
Moran's henchmen were not in a po
sition to score at any time during the
game. Kerr allowed only three hits
and they were scattered through as
many innings. Fischer pitched good
ball letting the White Sox gather only
seven hits.

The Reds made one iniscue in the
field while the Sox played perfect
ball.
Faber and Eller, right-handers, will
probably oppose each other tomorrow
in the fourth game of the series.
The score:
R. H. E.
Chicago 3 7 0
Cincinnati 0 3 1
Batteriesâ€”Kerr and Schalk; Fisher
and Rariden.
