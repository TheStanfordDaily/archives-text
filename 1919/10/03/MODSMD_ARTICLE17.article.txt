# A 						DISTINCTION FOR STANFORD
## 
### 
/\NE of the highest tributes ever paid to Stanford University was the distinc
tion of having Herbert Hoover, '95, one of the recognized great men in
world affairs, give his first public utterance on the burning League of Nations
and Peace Treaty topic, before the Stanford Students, yesterday. Mr. Hoover
said that he had declined a number of invitations to deliver this address, and
had waited for the occasion when he could be with "his own people." Stan
ford men and women appreciate this consideration. It is an honor to them
and to the University. The stand Mr. Hoover has taken upon the League
of Nations and the Peace Treaty is the stand that people would expect a man
with experience in international affairs to take. He made a great impression
upon his Stanford audience by his clear-cut reasoning. Woodrow Wilson
has accused the college men of today of a lack of interest in the vital affairs
of the nation, but Stanford men and women are interested. They have only
been seeking real explanations, and Mr. Hoover gave them what they were
looking for. As has always been the case with him, he again stands for the
betterment of the world, and of mankind, and is opposed to the narrow con
ception of international affairs that several prominent politicians are now
advancing. "His own people" will follow his lead, for Herbert Hoover is
Stanford's greatest man.
