# AN ORGANIZATION WORTH WHILE
## 
### 
IJIHE announcement that a Republican Club is to be organized at Stanford
* should meet with the approval of thinking students, even those of a dif
ferent political faith. The great questions of the day have been shunted
into politics, as has always been the case, and the Stanford voters,(and
there are a great many more this year than ever before), will have to make
up their minds on vital issues along party lines. With the supposed leader
of the Republican Party in the State of California being repudiated by many
of his best-known followers, the G. O. P. will soon need props even in this
staunch anti-Democratic state, and Republican Clubs can do much to create
a decent political interest, and towards placing real issues before the people
in an intelligent way. Local politics have always been discouraged at Stan
ford, because we want to get away from the petty things that mar the Uni
versity, but an interest in our national affairs should receive all the support
possible. A properly organized Republican Club, and for that matter a
Democratic Club can do much for its respective party, and incidently help
Stanford, for students alive to the real issues of the day are better college
men and women.
