This year's freshman class is the
largest in the history of the Universi
ty. In the opinion of student body of
ficials it is more important than ever
that the class of '23 be governed and
prompted by the real Stanford Spirit,
and that it take the steps necessary to
determine what is required and ex
pected of it without delay. The only
way that this can be accomplished
is by faithful attendance at class
meetings, and especially the one in
question, where representatives from
the upper-classmen will advise the
members and help them "stand on
their own feet."
