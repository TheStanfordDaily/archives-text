# NEW PROGRAM PROVIDES BROADER FIELDS FOR STANFORD DEBATERS
## 
### 
No less than four big intercollegiate
debates are already assured for the
coming year, according to Coach Mc-
Clintock'B announcement this morn
ing, which states that the contests
are so scheduled that Stanford's for
ensic artists may invade the West at
large, as all of the arguments are to
be staged in enemy territory.
The debates with the University of
Washington, at Seattle, and with the
University of California, at Berkeley,
which were dropped during the war
period, will be resumed again this
year. A trio will also be sent to
meet the University of Southern Cali
fornia. at Los Ang3les.
All of these contests preced the
famous "Joffre" argument in the
Spring, at which the well-known
"Medaille Joffre" is presented by the
Republic of France, to the "most
skillful debater."
Coach McClintock has this year pre
pared a special course in practical
debating, in which men interested in
forensic activities may gain credit in
preparing for various debates. All
students are eligible for English 20.
According to McClintock the coming
year offers great opportunities in the
forensic field. A two-man team will

be sent to Seattle in March. A con
tract for the regular debate with Cali
fornia will be signed Saturday, sched
uling the argument for the eve of
the big football game.
Stanford will send teams against
other southern colleges if convenient
dates can be arranged. It is possible
too, the authorities state, that in view
of a success during the early part of
the year, one of the great eastern
trios may be brought to Stanford, or
the Cardinal may send representatives
east.
In reviewing the prospects for the
year, McClintock says that the num
ber of able men returned insures
teams of unusual strength. At the
same time the number of arguments
to be scheduled provides that many
new forensic aspirants may meet with
audiences this year.
None of the questions for the com
ing debates have yet been decided or
deliberated upon. The regular team
debate with California, the first on
the list, will be fully arranged in the
near future, and a call for tryoutees
may be expected soon, though it is
possible that this trio may be selected
from men registered in the debater's
coaching course.

No less than four big intercollegiate
debates are already assured for the
coming year, according to Coach Mc-
Clintock'B announcement this morn
ing, which states that the contests
are so scheduled that Stanford's for
ensic artists may invade the West at
large, as all of the arguments are to
be staged in enemy territory.
The debates with the University of
Washington, at Seattle, and with the
University of California, at Berkeley,
which were dropped during the war
period, will be resumed again this
year. A trio will also be sent to
meet the University of Southern Cali
fornia. at Los Ang3les.
All of these contests preced the
famous "Joffre" argument in the
Spring, at which the well-known
"Medaille Joffre" is presented by the
Republic of France, to the "most
skillful debater."
Coach McClintock has this year pre
pared a special course in practical
debating, in which men interested in
forensic activities may gain credit in
preparing for various debates. All
students are eligible for English 20.
According to McClintock the coming
year offers great opportunities in the
forensic field. A two-man team will

be sent to Seattle in March. A con
tract for the regular debate with Cali
fornia will be signed Saturday, sched
uling the argument for the eve of
the big football game.
Stanford will send teams against
other southern colleges if convenient
dates can be arranged. It is possible
too, the authorities state, that in view
of a success during the early part of
the year, one of the great eastern
trios may be brought to Stanford, or
the Cardinal may send representatives
east.
In reviewing the prospects for the
year, McClintock says that the num
ber of able men returned insures
teams of unusual strength. At the
same time the number of arguments
to be scheduled provides that many
new forensic aspirants may meet with
audiences this year.
None of the questions for the com
ing debates have yet been decided or
deliberated upon. The regular team
debate with California, the first on
the list, will be fully arranged in the
near future, and a call for tryoutees
may be expected soon, though it is
possible that this trio may be selected
from men registered in the debater's
coaching course.
