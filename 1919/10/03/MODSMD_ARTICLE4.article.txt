have returned from the service in an
introductory speech at the Hoover As
sembly held yesterday afternoon. Fol
lowing Dr. Wilbur, the Reverend Dr.

problems of student government and
those which face the University when
the graduating classes become alumni.
Miss Harriet Bradford, Dean of Women,
gave a very optimistic view on the pros
pects of the women for the coming year.
In touching on the student life of
the coming year Dr. Wilbur said, "Every
man must remember that he is expected
to stand on his own feet at Stanford.
Those who fail in this, drop out from
our number, but fortunately those men
are in the minority."
Chaplain Gardner amused the audience
with his remarks on student life. He
announced the plans for the matricula
tion service to be held next Sunday
morning for the new students. All
freshmen are to be at the Little Theatre

into the Memorial Church.
Dean McDowell touched all
that university life brought the student
from the matriculation assembly to the
time of graduation. He strongly
emphasized the point that with grad
uation one's duty toward the University
did not end. Certain responsibilities
toward a closer connection and under
standing with the University authorities,
Mr. McDowell pointed out, were essen
tial to the future of the University
Miss Harriet Bradford gave a very
close and comprehensive view of the
situation of the women and how the
war had affected the position of the
women in the University.
"The Stanford student body is no
longer made up of the seventeen hun
dred students and the '500'," said Miss
Bradford, "but I would rather think of
it as just twenty-two hundred Stanford
students."
