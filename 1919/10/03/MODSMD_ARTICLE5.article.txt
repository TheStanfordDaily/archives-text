# Present Debate Building Foundation for Covenant
## 
### 
DEIIHAPS the most ti nificant speech
ever delivered in t|e Stanford As
sembly Hall by any speaker, was that
of Herbert Hoover, '95, yesterday aft
ernoon. No man has been more looked
to by a greater number of people dur
ing the world war, than Mr. Hoover,
and on this account, his words spoken
yesterday concerning the future peace
of the world will 1 e barkened to Ly
all nations. Stanford was indeed
honored by Mr. Hoover when he chose
his Alma Mater as the most fitting
place in which to give the firs' public
expressi jn of those views which the
entire world has been waiting to hear.
In light of the stormy debate which
has been going on in the United
States Senate, and the tours made by
President Wilson and Senator John
son, Mr. Hoover made several signi
ficant points. The fact that he ap
proved the debate that has swept the
country because it brought the prob
lems of the League of Nations so
effectively before the people of this
country, came somewhat as a surprise.
"This debate is laying the foundation
to the league," he said.
In reply to the much repeated argu
ment of the Republican leaders, Mr.
Soover stated that he did not believe
tluJl the Un'ted States would evei be
forced into a world war without the
unanimous vote of its own leaders.

In other words the League of Nations
.cannot force any nation into war with
out the consent of that nation.
The complete tevt of Hoover's great
speech follows:
1 have been urged by Mr. Taft and
others to state at some greater length
my views on the peace treaty, and I
take this occasion to present them to
my own townspeople. During the ten
months between the armistice and har
vest I acted as the economic director
for the Supreme War Council. I was
necessarily in intimate contact witli the
political and economic situation all
over Europe. I was not one of the
American Peace delegates, but the pur
pose of my office was to act on behalf
of the United States and the Peace
Conference in an effort to save life and
prevent anarchy while the peace was
negotiated. I therefore had an advan
tageous position to independently ob
serve the growth of ideas in the Con
ference and the re-percussions of these
ideas through Europe.
I am not of those who have an im
patience of honest debate. 1 believe
that the debate of the League of Na
tions going on in the United States is
building tlic very foundations of the
League. It is bringing home to every
household in the country the necessity
and possibility of providing for our own
safety and of providing for the safety
of the world as a whole without great
armies or navies. Nor do I believe in
the criticism of the Senate for not ac
cepting out of hand this document so
laboriously evolved by five hundred con
flicting minds in Paris. It is a funda
mental part of our institutions that the
