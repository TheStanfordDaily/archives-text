# Present Debate Building Foundation for Covenant
## 
### 
DEIIHAPS the most ti nificant speech
ever delivered in t|e Stanford As
sembly Hall by any speaker, was that
of Herbert Hoover, '95, yesterday aft
ernoon. No man has been more looked
to by a greater number of people dur
ing the world war, than Mr. Hoover,
and on this account, his words spoken
yesterday concerning the future peace
of the world will 1 e barkened to Ly
all nations. Stanford was indeed
honored by Mr. Hoover when he chose
his Alma Mater as the most fitting
place in which to give the firs' public
expressi jn of those views which the
entire world has been waiting to hear.
In light of the stormy debate which
has been going on in the United
States Senate, and the tours made by
President Wilson and Senator John
son, Mr. Hoover made several signi
ficant points. The fact that he ap
proved the debate that has swept the
country because it brought the prob
lems of the League of Nations so
effectively before the people of this
country, came somewhat as a surprise.
"This debate is laying the foundation
to the league," he said.
In reply to the much repeated argu
ment of the Republican leaders, Mr.
Soover stated that he did not believe
tluJl the Un'ted States would evei be
forced into a world war without the
unanimous vote of its own leaders.

In other words the League of Nations
.cannot force any nation into war with
out the consent of that nation.
The complete tevt of Hoover's great
speech follows:
1 have been urged by Mr. Taft and
others to state at some greater length
my views on the peace treaty, and I
take this occasion to present them to
my own townspeople. During the ten
months between the armistice and har
vest I acted as the economic director
for the Supreme War Council. I was
necessarily in intimate contact witli the
political and economic situation all
over Europe. I was not one of the
American Peace delegates, but the pur
pose of my office was to act on behalf
of the United States and the Peace
Conference in an effort to save life and
prevent anarchy while the peace was
negotiated. I therefore had an advan
tageous position to independently ob
serve the growth of ideas in the Con
ference and the re-percussions of these
ideas through Europe.
I am not of those who have an im
patience of honest debate. 1 believe
that the debate of the League of Na
tions going on in the United States is
building tlic very foundations of the
League. It is bringing home to every
household in the country the necessity
and possibility of providing for our own
safety and of providing for the safety
of the world as a whole without great
armies or navies. Nor do I believe in
the criticism of the Senate for not ac
cepting out of hand this document so
laboriously evolved by five hundred con
flicting minds in Paris. It is a funda
mental part of our institutions that the
Senate shall scrutinize these matters.
Consideration and debate by the Senate
is not trahorship.
Nor were those Americans traitors
who. in representing us in Paris, fought
for every inch of hope that the weak
could be protected and the strong
curbed, that the United States could it
self be protected. Tf they were traitors
to their country it was because they were
wrong in assuming that the American
people wished an effort made to destroy
the seeds of war and thus to secure the
growth of liberty.
The treaty finally reached at Paris is
by no means perfect. I see no method
by which it could have been made per
fect when five hundred men, represent
ing twenty-three different nationalities,
were engaged in its negotiations, and
agreement had to be unanimous. Diff
ence in national character and in national
aspirations could but cause much dif
ference in views. Many of them repre
sented desperate, passionate or selfish ob
jects, some were dominated by political
ideals of the last century, yet the most
were actuated by the prayers of the com
mon people, who really fought this war,
that it should be the last war. There ex
isted in the world before this Conference
scores of those major international
wrongs which breed war. Of these the
Peace Conference corrected some, but it
will take perhaps a hundred years for
the men of good will to correct them all.
It is often overlooked that this was not
a conference to settle wrongs committed
by Allies and neutrals, but by the enemy
only. It was German wrongs that were
on the operating table. It would have
been beautiful to have all the interna
tional wrongs on the table, but this is not
a perfect world. As a practical fact, if
this had been attempted, the Conference
would have broken up !n quarrels among
the Allies, and Germany would have been
handed again the domination of Europe.
The old guard in Germany hoped and
expected that this would result; up to
date at least they have been disappointed.
No one could be more disappointed than
the American delegation that some great
wrongs that were the result of the secret
treaties that had been written in times of
complete desperation amongst the origi
nal allies were not eradicated at the Con
ference. In this the American group
were a minority of one, endeavoring to
secure that right should be done, in a
meeting that required unanimous agree
ment. There are many other items in

the treaty which men of good will would
have liked to see different. Our dele
gation could have found cause to with
draw from the Conference on many
scores. We would have been withdraw
ing in the face of the enemy, and Ger
many, by this division of the Allies,
would have been victorious.
Greater things were accomplished by
this Conference than by any other in
history. The military oligarchys of Ger
many, Austria, and Turkey were dis
solved, and if peace is ratified in time
they will be disarmed, and thus a para
mount menace to us and the world will
be destroyed. The Poles, the Czechs,
the Finns, the Croats, and the Slovenes
and Slovacks, the Baltic States, Arme
nians, Arabs have, or will, subject to
ratification, secure their liberty. Par
cels of French, Italians, Roumanians,
Serbians, Greeks have been rejoined to
their mother countries. Representative
democratic governments were set up on
the liberated and enemy states. Meth
ods were devised by which these people
would be free from economic domina
tion and by which the Germans and
their allies would be made to pay some
thing on account of the terrible destruc
tion they have wrought as a lesson to
militarism.
The men of liberal vision at the Con
ference were steadfast for certain domi
nant ideals that mark this conference
apait from all others. First, that this
settlement should remove as many of the
immediate causes of war as possible by
destroying enemy domination over other
races. Second, by establishing the new
governments on a democratic basis so
that wars should not be made by auto
that wars should not be made by autoc
racies for the profit of their class.
Third, that there should be established a
world council—the League. Here these
newly liberated peoples could lind some
measure of protection from invasion.
Here, with the stimulation of the world
conscience awakened by this war, there
could be no hope that the wrongs among
other peoples could be brought for dis
cussion and negotiation. Here, if ag
gression were undertaken, the public
opinion of the world could be enlight
ened and the aggressor could be made
an outcast from the society of the civ
ilized nations. Thus only could some
thing constructive be done to end war.
This is an aspiration which has been
rising in the hearts of all the world.
It has become an insistence in the
minds of all those in the world to

whom the lives of our sons are precious,
to all those to whom civilization is a
tiling to be safeguarded, and all those
who see no hope for the amelioration
of the misery of those who toil if peace
cannot be maintained.
Jo form a League of Nations for this
purpose has been proposed by the leaders
of both our great parties time and
again. It has been proposed by lead
ing spirits in all civilized nations. It
belongs to no one man, it comes from
the heart and mind of the world.
1 haye always regarded it a mistake
that this was termed "League," for the
term smacks of military alliance. It
is, in fact, a council of nations that re
quires in all important matters unani
mous decision.
'1 he major provisions of this council
look toward disarmament and provision
of place ind time, for negotiation and
arbitration of quarrels. Its most potent
weapon is the determination of rights
and wrongs of international quarrels
and the enlightenment of the world
upon them and thus the moral isolation
of the aggressor. If this fails, its sec
ond weapon is the boycott, the most
potent force in the world to-day—the
force that more than any other brought
Germany to her knees. It agrees that
military force can be used in defense
against invasion of one country by an
other, but in this, as in other important
things, unanimous consent is required,
and consent must mean the United
States Congress on our side. From my
own experience, 1 believe that the dis
cussion, negotiation, arbitration, enlight
enment of public opinion and thus the
moral definition of an outcast will be
all-sufficient, coupled with the knowl
edge that other wcapous exist. The hope
that I, as an independent observer, have
placed in the League was that it would
forever relieve the United States of the
necessity to again send a single soldier
outside of our boundaries.
The opponents of the League are of
many conflicting minds. There are those
who truly wish this experiment in the
promotion and preservation of human
liberty to be tried; tTTey, however, wish
the details altered and have fears that
the details agreed upon may themselves
involve us in war. Others believe that
the interest of the United States lies in
keeping out of all international action.
Others believe that the old game of arms
is the best promoter of civilization; still
others oppose it from disappointment
that all the ills of the world were not

corrected at this one session of the na
tion. But few of tliem acknowledge that
this terrible upheaval and its aftermath
of conflicting economic, social, and politi
cal forces lias endangered the stability
of the world for years to come.
Those who formulated the League did
not expect that it would furnish an over
night solution to all uncorrected inter
national wrongs or the disruption of
the.se unloosened forces. They did ex
pect that by degrees ttiere would be a
definite alignment of opinion in the
world that would make these wrongs
less and that could in great measure
restrain the actual outbreaks of war, that
could give the world time to heal its
wounds. Even the Sermon on the
Mount did not wholly regenerate the
world.
We-hear the cry that the League obli
gates that our sons be sent to tight in
foreign lands. Yet the very intent and
structure of the League is to prevent
war. There is no obligation for the

United States to engage in military op
erations or to allow any interference
with our internal affairs without the full
consent of our representatives in the
League. If there is any danger that we
should be charged with an obligation to
go to war, either direct or implied, with
out the full consent and approval of
Congress, I believe the President will be
the first to agree to any interpretation
that this cannot be. The French govern
ment so far takes this view that it has
requested from us a separate military
guaranty for themselves.
The League is founded expressly in
the attempt to secure the pacific settle
ment of these questions without military
force. To me, every line of it is the
complete negation of militarism. Dur
ing the course of negotiations in Paris
one fact stood out with regard to the
League. Its opposition there arose en
tirely from the old militaristic regimes,
and from the reactionaries of the world
in general. They saw in it trulv the
undermining of militarism. They had
the vision to see. and even to openly
state, that it would mean the ultimate
abandonment of military force in the
world, for thev. as of old, contend that
without military exercise there is no hope
of the maintenance of human efficiency
or control of the masses. What they
foresaw has already happened in a great
military nation like the British, where
the population, broken under a load of
taxation, is responding quickly to the new
possibility of international safety with
out the burden of gigantic naval arma
ment. The reactionaries saw that under
the hope for the protection of the League
of Nations there would be a growing op
position to the burden of armament from
all those who labor with hand and mind.
It is the workers of the world who
pay the price of war, not alone in the
support of arms but in blood and in the
support to tyranny which armies mean in
peace.
All wars have hitherto been settled on
the basis of trying to create a balance of
military strength by intriguing peoples j
into various groups oT equal military j
weight—the balance of power. Tt would
have been impossible to give liberty to j
the score of new nations of militarily I
weak yet liberty-loving people without!
the League to safeguard them from in
vasion. Beyond this, every attempt to
set up this balance hitherto has ultimately
crashed in war, for its essence is militar
ism. The creation of the League brought I
new hopes into the peace, and if the
League fails these new liberated nations
must fall, for the world must readjust
itself into the balance of power, and great
wars will re-open at once in this re
alignment. In a recent visit to many of
the capitals of the new states, the first
anxious question of their officials was,
"Will America ratify the League?" Their
invariable answer was that without it
their only course was the hopeless effort
to arm themselves against stronger neigh
bors; to do it in the midst of misery;
to endeavor to set up groups and military
alliances with all the old treadmill of
oppression of arms and ultimate war.
There are many elements in Europe
who wish to see the treaty break down
and the League of Nations disappear.
For instance, during the last five months
our Allies have been growing weaker
from a military point of view, due to the
necessity of demobilizing their armies,
while at the same time the reactionary
group in Germany has been growing in
strength through the recreation of hopes
of yet securing a division of the Allies.
At the time I left Europe a month ago,
German militarism had already re-estab
lished itself as a well-disciplined, well
officered army of at least 400,000 men,
largely congregated on the Polish fron
tier and even defying the government at
Berlin. Under the alarm of this danger,
the Poles, in the midst of the greatest
economic misery that a nation ever knew,
have been trying to create an army of
500,000 men for their protection from the
Germans on one side and the Bolsheviks
on the other. If the treaty is ratified the
German army will be reduced to 200,000
men and dispersed over Germany, and
their extra armament destroyed. The
failure of the treaty means the invasion
of the Polish state. This is only one of
the powder magazines in Europe which
cannot be destroyed *mtil this treaty is
ratified, and during every day of delay
more explosives are poured into them.
For good or ill, the entire treaty was
constructed around this central theme of
a League of Nations to prevent war. A
score of provisions in tTie treaty and out
side the covenant necessitate its erec
tion. To avoid causes of war, the
League has been made the trustee to
secure outlets to the sea, to secure free
ports to inland peoples, to settle deferred
disputes which could not otherwise hope
for solution without dangerous friction.
The treaties themselves cannot be car
ried out without the League. If the
League falls the treaties also fall.
The boundaries of these new states
cannot precisely include all their own
nationals, for the borders are lined with
racial islands and friction. Peace and
a moderating council are required for
readjustments. Their outlets to sea by
rail, canal, and viver are through other
states; their whole political and economic
situation demands peace for the growth
of order and the prevention of anarchy.
If the balance of power has to supplant
the League of Nations we will have
torn asunder the only hope that Europe
will not break into further wars of races,
classes, and groups that will take her
civilization back to the Middle Ages. I
am convinced that if we attempt now
to revise the treaty we shall tread a road
through European chaos. Even if we
managed to keep our soldiers out of it
we will not scape fearful economic
losses.
If the League is to break down we
must at once prepare to fight. Few
people seem to realize the desperation to
which Europe has been reduced. During
the coming winter son.c of them will look
with longing eyes on this rich, fat na
tion, possessing great surpluses of every
human necessity, wh/fe they endure in
evitable hunger and cold. At the same
time the energy of our population is sup
planting them in places where their mer
chants expect to market their goods and
operate their ships. Others of them will
he plunged into war with their neighbors,
and we have already experienced the diffi
culty of maintaining neutrality with self
respect and safety. We cannot fiddle
while Rome burns.
The Allies may themselves ratify this
treaty without us, and thus assemble a
Council of Nations of their own in an
endeavor to solve the problem of Europe.
It would be a Council of Europe, and in
the midst of these terrible times, with the
debts they owe to us, the material they
must have from us or starve, I would
rather be represented therein lest it be
come a League of Europe against the
Western Hemisphere. A peace without
us means more army and navy for us,
with the old treadmill of taxes and
dangers.
It is true we are not loved by certain
classes of people, some of them among
our former allies. It is untrue, however,
to say that the masses of any nation now
hate us. It is still more untrue to say
that the newly liberated peoples look to
us with other than conviction that our
moral leadership is their only hope. We
are not loved by any military class,
whether in the allied or enemy countries.
()ur whole object has been to destroy
their calling, to undermine their class.
! lie great masses of burdened working
people, however, look for us to support
this one hope of relief from domination
from burdens and misery of arms and
war.
Neither the gospel of hate nor the
gospel of unpreparedness are the roads
to peace. The true road lies in every
effort to remove the causes of war, not
in tearing down such structure of peace
as we have, nor in blindness to present
dangers.
Those who think we can isolate our
selves seem to ignore the fact that mod
ern communication has shortened our
distance from our neighbors from a
month to an hour. A vast amount of
our civilization and the daily improve
ments of life that come to our people
are the products of the ideas and in
telligence and labor of our neighbors.
If we believe we can see our neighbors
return to thirty years' war through the
breakdown of this treaty and we still
maintain our progress, it is the egotism
of insanity. We arc an overseas people,
and we are dependent upon Europe for
marks for the surplus products of our
farmers and laborers. Without order in
Europe we will at best have business de
pression, unemployment, and all their
burden of troubles. With renewed dis
organization in Europe, social diseases
and anarchy thrive, and we are infected
with every social wind of Europe. We
are forced to interest ourselves in the
welfare of the world if we are to thrive.
There is no American who has spent the
last ten months in Europe who does not
pray that we should g*r out of entangle
ment in the sordid selfishness, the pas
sions, the misery of it. But our expan
sion overseas has entangled us for good
or ill, and I stand for an honest attempt
to join with Europe's better spirit to
prevent these entanglements from in
volving us in war. We are not dealing
with perfection; we are dealing with
the lesser of evils. These are reasons
of interest.
There are also reasons of idealism,
and true national interest lies along the
path of practical ideals, and there are
ideals in Europe. During the last hun
dred and fifty years a far larger pro
portion of our citizens liave grown far
ahead of those of Europe in outlook on
life, in disinterested sense of justice, in
sympathy with the downtrodden. It
was with the hope of ending war that
we went into it, and to fix it in inter
national law that dominated our repre
sentatives in the Peace Conference. We
have expended the lives of our sons
and an enormous portion of our wealth,
hoping to see these ends. For us to re
fuse to enter into a joint attempt with
the well-thinking sections of a large
part of the world to establish a contin
uing moral conscience against war is the
utmost folly in our own interest.
We have been the center and inspira
tion of democracy for a hundred years.
We have given sympathy and encour
agement to every aspiration for self-gov
ernment for all this time. We have from
our experience in its blessings believed
it made for peace and well-being. We
enjoy from it the highest standard of
living in the world. We went to Eu
rope with our best blood and our treas
ures and fought the attempt to impose
autocracy on the world. We won. We
imposed democracy all over Europe. We
set up a score of new democracies—and
they are many of them peoples of our
own blood—the Baltic, Polish, and Slav
races. Arc we to refuse our counsels to
these peoples now struggling to realize
our own ideals? Curious as it may seem,
this also embraces Germany itself. That
sincerely democratic group which to-day
controls Germany is losing ground lie
fore the old reactionary group who em
ploy tlu- hope of the failure of the league
to fan the renewed hope of domination.
I am one of those who hold that this
war would never have happened if the
nations of Europe had accepted the invi
tation of Sir Edward Gray to a confer
ence of civilians in July, 1914. I believe
that if the intelligence of the world can
be aggregated around a table, the pres
sures from the responsibility of these
men for the possible enormous loss of

life and the fabulous amount of human
misery created by their failure to pre
vent war, are such that no body of de
cent men in these times can fail to se
cure some sort of solution short of war.
We have now seen the most terrible five
years of history because the reaction
aries of Europe refused to come into a
room to discuss the welfare of humanity.
From this mightv political, social, and
economic upheaval there are a host of
outstanding problems which can Weed
war at any minute. The Liberal world
is asking us to come into a Council to
find the solution for these things. It is
not asking for soldiers, it is asking for
our economic and moral weight, our
idealism, and our disinterested sense of
justice. Are we willing to take the re
sponsibility that now rests on the souls
of those men in Europe wlio refused this
invitation in 1914?

force that more than any other brought
Germany to her knees. It agrees that
military force can be used in defense
against invasion of one country by an
other, but in this, as in other important
things, unanimous consent is required,
and consent must mean the United
States Congress on our side. From my
own experience, 1 believe that the dis
cussion, negotiation, arbitration, enlight
enment of public opinion and thus the
moral definition of an outcast will be
all-sufficient, coupled with the knowl
edge that other wcapous exist. The hope
that I, as an independent observer, have
placed in the League was that it would
forever relieve the United States of the
necessity to again send a single soldier
outside of our boundaries.
The opponents of the League are of
many conflicting minds. There are those
who truly wish this experiment in the
promotion and preservation of human
liberty to be tried; tTTey, however, wish
the details altered and have fears that
the details agreed upon may themselves
involve us in war. Others believe that
the interest of the United States lies in
keeping out of all international action.
Others believe that the old game of arms
is the best promoter of civilization; still
others oppose it from disappointment
that all the ills of the world were not

corrected at this one session of the na
tion. But few of tliem acknowledge that
this terrible upheaval and its aftermath
of conflicting economic, social, and politi
cal forces lias endangered the stability
of the world for years to come.
Those who formulated the League did
not expect that it would furnish an over
night solution to all uncorrected inter
national wrongs or the disruption of
the.se unloosened forces. They did ex
pect that by degrees ttiere would be a
definite alignment of opinion in the
world that would make these wrongs
less and that could in great measure
restrain the actual outbreaks of war, that
could give the world time to heal its
wounds. Even the Sermon on the
Mount did not wholly regenerate the
world.
We-hear the cry that the League obli
gates that our sons be sent to tight in
foreign lands. Yet the very intent and
structure of the League is to prevent
war. There is no obligation for the

United States to engage in military op
erations or to allow any interference
with our internal affairs without the full
consent of our representatives in the
League. If there is any danger that we
should be charged with an obligation to
go to war, either direct or implied, with
out the full consent and approval of
Congress, I believe the President will be
the first to agree to any interpretation
that this cannot be. The French govern
ment so far takes this view that it has
requested from us a separate military
guaranty for themselves.
The League is founded expressly in
the attempt to secure the pacific settle
ment of these questions without military
force. To me, every line of it is the
complete negation of militarism. Dur
ing the course of negotiations in Paris
one fact stood out with regard to the
League. Its opposition there arose en
tirely from the old militaristic regimes,
and from the reactionaries of the world
in general. They saw in it trulv the
undermining of militarism. They had
the vision to see. and even to openly
state, that it would mean the ultimate
abandonment of military force in the
world, for thev. as of old, contend that
without military exercise there is no hope
of the maintenance of human efficiency
or control of the masses. What they
foresaw has already happened in a great
military nation like the British, where
the population, broken under a load of
taxation, is responding quickly to the new
possibility of international safety with
out the burden of gigantic naval arma
ment. The reactionaries saw that under
the hope for the protection of the League
of Nations there would be a growing op
position to the burden of armament from
all those who labor with hand and mind.
It is the workers of the world who
pay the price of war, not alone in the
support of arms but in blood and in the
support to tyranny which armies mean in
peace.
All wars have hitherto been settled on
the basis of trying to create a balance of
military strength by intriguing peoples j
into various groups oT equal military j
weight—the balance of power. Tt would
have been impossible to give liberty to j
the score of new nations of militarily I
weak yet liberty-loving people without!
the League to safeguard them from in
vasion. Beyond this, every attempt to
set up this balance hitherto has ultimately
crashed in war, for its essence is militar
ism. The creation of the League brought I
new hopes into the peace, and if the
League fails these new liberated nations
must fall, for the world must readjust
itself into the balance of power, and great
wars will re-open at once in this re
alignment. In a recent visit to many of
the capitals of the new states, the first
anxious question of their officials was,
"Will America ratify the League?" Their
invariable answer was that without it
their only course was the hopeless effort
to arm themselves against stronger neigh
bors; to do it in the midst of misery;
to endeavor to set up groups and military
alliances with all the old treadmill of
oppression of arms and ultimate war.
There are many elements in Europe
who wish to see the treaty break down
and the League of Nations disappear.
For instance, during the last five months
our Allies have been growing weaker
from a military point of view, due to the
necessity of demobilizing their armies,
while at the same time the reactionary
group in Germany has been growing in
strength through the recreation of hopes
of yet securing a division of the Allies.
At the time I left Europe a month ago,
German militarism had already re-estab
lished itself as a well-disciplined, well
officered army of at least 400,000 men,
largely congregated on the Polish fron
tier and even defying the government at
Berlin. Under the alarm of this danger,
the Poles, in the midst of the greatest
economic misery that a nation ever knew,
have been trying to create an army of
500,000 men for their protection from the
Germans on one side and the Bolsheviks
on the other. If the treaty is ratified the
German army will be reduced to 200,000
men and dispersed over Germany, and
their extra armament destroyed. The
failure of the treaty means the invasion
of the Polish state. This is only one of
the powder magazines in Europe which
cannot be destroyed *mtil this treaty is
ratified, and during every day of delay
more explosives are poured into them.
For good or ill, the entire treaty was
constructed around this central theme of
a League of Nations to prevent war. A
score of provisions in tTie treaty and out
side the covenant necessitate its erec
tion. To avoid causes of war, the
League has been made the trustee to
secure outlets to the sea, to secure free
ports to inland peoples, to settle deferred
disputes which could not otherwise hope
for solution without dangerous friction.
The treaties themselves cannot be car
ried out without the League. If the
League falls the treaties also fall.
The boundaries of these new states
cannot precisely include all their own
nationals, for the borders are lined with
racial islands and friction. Peace and
a moderating council are required for
readjustments. Their outlets to sea by
rail, canal, and viver are through other
states; their whole political and economic
situation demands peace for the growth
of order and the prevention of anarchy.
If the balance of power has to supplant
the League of Nations we will have
torn asunder the only hope that Europe
will not break into further wars of races,
classes, and groups that will take her
civilization back to the Middle Ages. I
am convinced that if we attempt now
to revise the treaty we shall tread a road
through European chaos. Even if we
managed to keep our soldiers out of it
we will not scape fearful economic
losses.
If the League is to break down we
must at once prepare to fight. Few
people seem to realize the desperation to
which Europe has been reduced. During
the coming winter son.c of them will look
with longing eyes on this rich, fat na
tion, possessing great surpluses of every
human necessity, wh/fe they endure in
evitable hunger and cold. At the same
time the energy of our population is sup
planting them in places where their mer
chants expect to market their goods and
operate their ships. Others of them will
he plunged into war with their neighbors,
and we have already experienced the diffi
culty of maintaining neutrality with self
respect and safety. We cannot fiddle
while Rome burns.
The Allies may themselves ratify this
treaty without us, and thus assemble a
Council of Nations of their own in an
endeavor to solve the problem of Europe.
It would be a Council of Europe, and in
the midst of these terrible times, with the
debts they owe to us, the material they
must have from us or starve, I would
rather be represented therein lest it be
come a League of Europe against the
Western Hemisphere. A peace without
us means more army and navy for us,
with the old treadmill of taxes and
dangers.
It is true we are not loved by certain
classes of people, some of them among
our former allies. It is untrue, however,
to say that the masses of any nation now
hate us. It is still more untrue to say
that the newly liberated peoples look to
us with other than conviction that our
moral leadership is their only hope. We
are not loved by any military class,
whether in the allied or enemy countries.
()ur whole object has been to destroy
their calling, to undermine their class.
! lie great masses of burdened working
people, however, look for us to support
this one hope of relief from domination
from burdens and misery of arms and
war.
Neither the gospel of hate nor the
gospel of unpreparedness are the roads
to peace. The true road lies in every
effort to remove the causes of war, not
in tearing down such structure of peace
as we have, nor in blindness to present
dangers.
Those who think we can isolate our
selves seem to ignore the fact that mod
ern communication has shortened our
distance from our neighbors from a
month to an hour. A vast amount of
our civilization and the daily improve
ments of life that come to our people
are the products of the ideas and in
telligence and labor of our neighbors.
If we believe we can see our neighbors
return to thirty years' war through the
breakdown of this treaty and we still
maintain our progress, it is the egotism
of insanity. We arc an overseas people,
and we are dependent upon Europe for
marks for the surplus products of our
farmers and laborers. Without order in
Europe we will at best have business de
pression, unemployment, and all their
burden of troubles. With renewed dis
organization in Europe, social diseases
and anarchy thrive, and we are infected
with every social wind of Europe. We
are forced to interest ourselves in the
welfare of the world if we are to thrive.
There is no American who has spent the
last ten months in Europe who does not
pray that we should g*r out of entangle
ment in the sordid selfishness, the pas
sions, the misery of it. But our expan
sion overseas has entangled us for good
or ill, and I stand for an honest attempt
to join with Europe's better spirit to
prevent these entanglements from in
volving us in war. We are not dealing
with perfection; we are dealing with
the lesser of evils. These are reasons
of interest.
There are also reasons of idealism,
and true national interest lies along the
path of practical ideals, and there are
ideals in Europe. During the last hun
dred and fifty years a far larger pro
portion of our citizens liave grown far
ahead of those of Europe in outlook on
life, in disinterested sense of justice, in
sympathy with the downtrodden. It
was with the hope of ending war that
we went into it, and to fix it in inter
national law that dominated our repre
sentatives in the Peace Conference. We
have expended the lives of our sons
and an enormous portion of our wealth,
hoping to see these ends. For us to re
fuse to enter into a joint attempt with
the well-thinking sections of a large
part of the world to establish a contin
uing moral conscience against war is the
utmost folly in our own interest.
We have been the center and inspira
tion of democracy for a hundred years.
We have given sympathy and encour
agement to every aspiration for self-gov
ernment for all this time. We have from
our experience in its blessings believed
it made for peace and well-being. We
enjoy from it the highest standard of
living in the world. We went to Eu
rope with our best blood and our treas
ures and fought the attempt to impose
autocracy on the world. We won. We
imposed democracy all over Europe. We
set up a score of new democracies—and
they are many of them peoples of our
own blood—the Baltic, Polish, and Slav
races. Arc we to refuse our counsels to
these peoples now struggling to realize
our own ideals? Curious as it may seem,
this also embraces Germany itself. That
sincerely democratic group which to-day
controls Germany is losing ground lie
fore the old reactionary group who em
ploy tlu- hope of the failure of the league
to fan the renewed hope of domination.
I am one of those who hold that this
war would never have happened if the
nations of Europe had accepted the invi
tation of Sir Edward Gray to a confer
ence of civilians in July, 1914. I believe
that if the intelligence of the world can
be aggregated around a table, the pres
sures from the responsibility of these
men for the possible enormous loss of

life and the fabulous amount of human
misery created by their failure to pre
vent war, are such that no body of de
cent men in these times can fail to se
cure some sort of solution short of war.
We have now seen the most terrible five
years of history because the reaction
aries of Europe refused to come into a
room to discuss the welfare of humanity.
From this mightv political, social, and
economic upheaval there are a host of
outstanding problems which can Weed
war at any minute. The Liberal world
is asking us to come into a Council to
find the solution for these things. It is
not asking for soldiers, it is asking for
our economic and moral weight, our
idealism, and our disinterested sense of
justice. Are we willing to take the re
sponsibility that now rests on the souls
of those men in Europe wlio refused this
invitation in 1914?
DEIIHAPS the most ti nificant speech
ever delivered in t|e Stanford As
sembly Hall by any speaker, was that
of Herbert Hoover, '95, yesterday aft
ernoon. No man has been more looked
to by a greater number of people dur
ing the world war, than Mr. Hoover,
and on this account, his words spoken
yesterday concerning the future peace
of the world will 1 e barkened to Ly
all nations. Stanford was indeed
honored by Mr. Hoover when he chose
his Alma Mater as the most fitting
place in which to give the firs' public
expressi jn of those views which the
entire world has been waiting to hear.
In light of the stormy debate which
has been going on in the United
States Senate, and the tours made by
President Wilson and Senator John
son, Mr. Hoover made several signi
ficant points. The fact that he ap
proved the debate that has swept the
country because it brought the prob
lems of the League of Nations so
effectively before the people of this
country, came somewhat as a surprise.
"This debate is laying the foundation
to the league," he said.
In reply to the much repeated argu
ment of the Republican leaders, Mr.
Soover stated that he did not believe
tluJl the Un'ted States would evei be
forced into a world war without the
unanimous vote of its own leaders.

In other words the League of Nations
.cannot force any nation into war with
out the consent of that nation.
The complete tevt of Hoover's great
speech follows:
1 have been urged by Mr. Taft and
others to state at some greater length
my views on the peace treaty, and I
take this occasion to present them to
my own townspeople. During the ten
months between the armistice and har
vest I acted as the economic director
for the Supreme War Council. I was
necessarily in intimate contact witli the
political and economic situation all
over Europe. I was not one of the
American Peace delegates, but the pur
pose of my office was to act on behalf
of the United States and the Peace
Conference in an effort to save life and
prevent anarchy while the peace was
negotiated. I therefore had an advan
tageous position to independently ob
serve the growth of ideas in the Con
ference and the re-percussions of these
ideas through Europe.
I am not of those who have an im
patience of honest debate. 1 believe
that the debate of the League of Na
tions going on in the United States is
building tlic very foundations of the
League. It is bringing home to every
household in the country the necessity
and possibility of providing for our own
safety and of providing for the safety
of the world as a whole without great
armies or navies. Nor do I believe in
the criticism of the Senate for not ac
cepting out of hand this document so
laboriously evolved by five hundred con
flicting minds in Paris. It is a funda
mental part of our institutions that the
Senate shall scrutinize these matters.
Consideration and debate by the Senate
is not trahorship.
Nor were those Americans traitors
who. in representing us in Paris, fought
for every inch of hope that the weak
could be protected and the strong
curbed, that the United States could it
self be protected. Tf they were traitors
to their country it was because they were
wrong in assuming that the American
people wished an effort made to destroy
the seeds of war and thus to secure the
growth of liberty.
The treaty finally reached at Paris is
by no means perfect. I see no method
by which it could have been made per
fect when five hundred men, represent
ing twenty-three different nationalities,
were engaged in its negotiations, and
agreement had to be unanimous. Diff
ence in national character and in national
aspirations could but cause much dif
ference in views. Many of them repre
sented desperate, passionate or selfish ob
jects, some were dominated by political
ideals of the last century, yet the most
were actuated by the prayers of the com
mon people, who really fought this war,
that it should be the last war. There ex
isted in the world before this Conference
scores of those major international
wrongs which breed war. Of these the
Peace Conference corrected some, but it
will take perhaps a hundred years for
the men of good will to correct them all.
It is often overlooked that this was not
a conference to settle wrongs committed
by Allies and neutrals, but by the enemy
only. It was German wrongs that were
on the operating table. It would have
been beautiful to have all the interna
tional wrongs on the table, but this is not
a perfect world. As a practical fact, if
this had been attempted, the Conference
would have broken up !n quarrels among
the Allies, and Germany would have been
handed again the domination of Europe.
The old guard in Germany hoped and
expected that this would result; up to
date at least they have been disappointed.
No one could be more disappointed than
the American delegation that some great
wrongs that were the result of the secret
treaties that had been written in times of
complete desperation amongst the origi
nal allies were not eradicated at the Con
ference. In this the American group
were a minority of one, endeavoring to
secure that right should be done, in a
meeting that required unanimous agree
ment. There are many other items in

the treaty which men of good will would
have liked to see different. Our dele
gation could have found cause to with
draw from the Conference on many
scores. We would have been withdraw
ing in the face of the enemy, and Ger
many, by this division of the Allies,
would have been victorious.
Greater things were accomplished by
this Conference than by any other in
history. The military oligarchys of Ger
many, Austria, and Turkey were dis
solved, and if peace is ratified in time
they will be disarmed, and thus a para
mount menace to us and the world will
be destroyed. The Poles, the Czechs,
the Finns, the Croats, and the Slovenes
and Slovacks, the Baltic States, Arme
nians, Arabs have, or will, subject to
ratification, secure their liberty. Par
cels of French, Italians, Roumanians,
Serbians, Greeks have been rejoined to
their mother countries. Representative
democratic governments were set up on
the liberated and enemy states. Meth
ods were devised by which these people
would be free from economic domina
tion and by which the Germans and
their allies would be made to pay some
thing on account of the terrible destruc
tion they have wrought as a lesson to
militarism.
The men of liberal vision at the Con
ference were steadfast for certain domi
nant ideals that mark this conference
apait from all others. First, that this
settlement should remove as many of the
immediate causes of war as possible by
destroying enemy domination over other
races. Second, by establishing the new
governments on a democratic basis so
that wars should not be made by auto
that wars should not be made by autoc
racies for the profit of their class.
Third, that there should be established a
world council—the League. Here these
newly liberated peoples could lind some
measure of protection from invasion.
Here, with the stimulation of the world
conscience awakened by this war, there
could be no hope that the wrongs among
other peoples could be brought for dis
cussion and negotiation. Here, if ag
gression were undertaken, the public
opinion of the world could be enlight
ened and the aggressor could be made
an outcast from the society of the civ
ilized nations. Thus only could some
thing constructive be done to end war.
This is an aspiration which has been
rising in the hearts of all the world.
It has become an insistence in the
minds of all those in the world to

whom the lives of our sons are precious,
to all those to whom civilization is a
tiling to be safeguarded, and all those
who see no hope for the amelioration
of the misery of those who toil if peace
cannot be maintained.
Jo form a League of Nations for this
purpose has been proposed by the leaders
of both our great parties time and
again. It has been proposed by lead
ing spirits in all civilized nations. It
belongs to no one man, it comes from
the heart and mind of the world.
1 haye always regarded it a mistake
that this was termed "League," for the
term smacks of military alliance. It
is, in fact, a council of nations that re
quires in all important matters unani
mous decision.
'1 he major provisions of this council
look toward disarmament and provision
of place ind time, for negotiation and
arbitration of quarrels. Its most potent
weapon is the determination of rights
and wrongs of international quarrels
and the enlightenment of the world
upon them and thus the moral isolation
of the aggressor. If this fails, its sec
ond weapon is the boycott, the most
potent force in the world to-day—the
force that more than any other brought
Germany to her knees. It agrees that
military force can be used in defense
against invasion of one country by an
other, but in this, as in other important
things, unanimous consent is required,
and consent must mean the United
States Congress on our side. From my
own experience, 1 believe that the dis
cussion, negotiation, arbitration, enlight
enment of public opinion and thus the
moral definition of an outcast will be
all-sufficient, coupled with the knowl
edge that other wcapous exist. The hope
that I, as an independent observer, have
placed in the League was that it would
forever relieve the United States of the
necessity to again send a single soldier
outside of our boundaries.

must have from us or starve, I would
rather be represented therein lest it be
come a League of Europe against the
Western Hemisphere. A peace without
us means more army and navy for us,
with the old treadmill of taxes and
dangers.
It is true we are not loved by certain
classes of people, some of them among
our former allies. It is untrue, however,
to say that the masses of any nation now
hate us. It is still more untrue to say
that the newly liberated peoples look to
us with other than conviction that our
moral leadership is their only hope. We
are not loved by any military class,
whether in the allied or enemy countries.
()ur whole object has been to destroy
their calling, to undermine their class.
! lie great masses of burdened working
people, however, look for us to support
this one hope of relief from domination
from burdens and misery of arms and
war.
Neither the gospel of hate nor the
gospel of unpreparedness are the roads
to peace. The true road lies in every
effort to remove the causes of war, not
in tearing down such structure of peace
as we have, nor in blindness to present
dangers.
Those who think we can isolate our
selves seem to ignore the fact that mod
ern communication has shortened our
distance from our neighbors from a
month to an hour. A vast amount of
our civilization and the daily improve
ments of life that come to our people
are the products of the ideas and in
telligence and labor of our neighbors.
If we believe we can see our neighbors
return to thirty years' war through the
breakdown of this treaty and we still
maintain our progress, it is the egotism
of insanity. We arc an overseas people,
and we are dependent upon Europe for
marks for the surplus products of our
farmers and laborers. Without order in
Europe we will at best have business de
pression, unemployment, and all their
burden of troubles. With renewed dis
organization in Europe, social diseases
and anarchy thrive, and we are infected
with every social wind of Europe. We
are forced to interest ourselves in the
welfare of the world if we are to thrive.
There is no American who has spent the
last ten months in Europe who does not
pray that we should g*r out of entangle
ment in the sordid selfishness, the pas
sions, the misery of it. But our expan
sion overseas has entangled us for good
or ill, and I stand for an honest attempt
to join with Europe's better spirit to
prevent these entanglements from in
volving us in war. We are not dealing
with perfection; we are dealing with
the lesser of evils. These are reasons
of interest.
There are also reasons of idealism,
and true national interest lies along the
path of practical ideals, and there are
ideals in Europe. During the last hun
dred and fifty years a far larger pro
portion of our citizens liave grown far
ahead of those of Europe in outlook on
life, in disinterested sense of justice, in
sympathy with the downtrodden. It
was with the hope of ending war that
we went into it, and to fix it in inter
national law that dominated our repre
sentatives in the Peace Conference. We
have expended the lives of our sons
and an enormous portion of our wealth,
hoping to see these ends. For us to re
fuse to enter into a joint attempt with
the well-thinking sections of a large
part of the world to establish a contin
uing moral conscience against war is the
utmost folly in our own interest.
We have been the center and inspira
tion of democracy for a hundred years.
We have given sympathy and encour
agement to every aspiration for self-gov
ernment for all this time. We have from
our experience in its blessings believed
it made for peace and well-being. We
enjoy from it the highest standard of
living in the world. We went to Eu
rope with our best blood and our treas
ures and fought the attempt to impose
autocracy on the world. We won. We
imposed democracy all over Europe. We
set up a score of new democracies—and
they are many of them peoples of our
own blood—the Baltic, Polish, and Slav
races. Arc we to refuse our counsels to
these peoples now struggling to realize
our own ideals? Curious as it may seem,
this also embraces Germany itself. That
sincerely democratic group which to-day
controls Germany is losing ground lie
fore the old reactionary group who em
ploy tlu- hope of the failure of the league
to fan the renewed hope of domination.
I am one of those who hold that this
war would never have happened if the
nations of Europe had accepted the invi
tation of Sir Edward Gray to a confer
ence of civilians in July, 1914. I believe
that if the intelligence of the world can
be aggregated around a table, the pres
sures from the responsibility of these
men for the possible enormous loss of

life and the fabulous amount of human
misery created by their failure to pre
vent war, are such that no body of de
cent men in these times can fail to se
cure some sort of solution short of war.
We have now seen the most terrible five
years of history because the reaction
aries of Europe refused to come into a
room to discuss the welfare of humanity.
From this mightv political, social, and
economic upheaval there are a host of
outstanding problems which can Weed
war at any minute. The Liberal world
is asking us to come into a Council to
find the solution for these things. It is
not asking for soldiers, it is asking for
our economic and moral weight, our
idealism, and our disinterested sense of
justice. Are we willing to take the re
sponsibility that now rests on the souls
of those men in Europe wlio refused this
invitation in 1914?
DEIIHAPS the most ti nificant speech
ever delivered in t|e Stanford As
sembly Hall by any speaker, was that
of Herbert Hoover, '95, yesterday aft
ernoon. No man has been more looked
to by a greater number of people dur
ing the world war, than Mr. Hoover,
and on this account, his words spoken
yesterday concerning the future peace
of the world will 1 e barkened to Ly
all nations. Stanford was indeed
honored by Mr. Hoover when he chose
his Alma Mater as the most fitting
place in which to give the firs' public
expressi jn of those views which the
entire world has been waiting to hear.
In light of the stormy debate which
has been going on in the United
States Senate, and the tours made by
President Wilson and Senator John
son, Mr. Hoover made several signi
ficant points. The fact that he ap
proved the debate that has swept the
country because it brought the prob
lems of the League of Nations so
effectively before the people of this
country, came somewhat as a surprise.
"This debate is laying the foundation
to the league," he said.
In reply to the much repeated argu
ment of the Republican leaders, Mr.
Soover stated that he did not believe
tluJl the Un'ted States would evei be
forced into a world war without the
unanimous vote of its own leaders.

In other words the League of Nations
.cannot force any nation into war with
out the consent of that nation.
The complete tevt of Hoover's great
speech follows:
1 have been urged by Mr. Taft and
others to state at some greater length
my views on the peace treaty, and I
take this occasion to present them to
my own townspeople. During the ten
months between the armistice and har
vest I acted as the economic director
for the Supreme War Council. I was
necessarily in intimate contact witli the
political and economic situation all
over Europe. I was not one of the
American Peace delegates, but the pur
pose of my office was to act on behalf
of the United States and the Peace
Conference in an effort to save life and
prevent anarchy while the peace was
negotiated. I therefore had an advan
tageous position to independently ob
serve the growth of ideas in the Con
ference and the re-percussions of these
ideas through Europe.
I am not of those who have an im
patience of honest debate. 1 believe
that the debate of the League of Na
tions going on in the United States is
building tlic very foundations of the
League. It is bringing home to every
household in the country the necessity
and possibility of providing for our own
safety and of providing for the safety
of the world as a whole without great
armies or navies. Nor do I believe in
the criticism of the Senate for not ac
cepting out of hand this document so
laboriously evolved by five hundred con
flicting minds in Paris. It is a funda
mental part of our institutions that the
Senate shall scrutinize these matters.
Consideration and debate by the Senate
is not trahorship.
Nor were those Americans traitors
who. in representing us in Paris, fought
for every inch of hope that the weak
could be protected and the strong
curbed, that the United States could it
self be protected. Tf they were traitors
to their country it was because they were
wrong in assuming that the American
people wished an effort made to destroy
the seeds of war and thus to secure the
growth of liberty.
The treaty finally reached at Paris is
by no means perfect. I see no method
by which it could have been made per
fect when five hundred men, represent
ing twenty-three different nationalities,
were engaged in its negotiations, and
agreement had to be unanimous. Diff
ence in national character and in national
aspirations could but cause much dif
ference in views. Many of them repre
sented desperate, passionate or selfish ob
jects, some were dominated by political
ideals of the last century, yet the most
were actuated by the prayers of the com
mon people, who really fought this war,
that it should be the last war. There ex
isted in the world before this Conference
scores of those major international
wrongs which breed war. Of these the
Peace Conference corrected some, but it
will take perhaps a hundred years for
the men of good will to correct them all.
It is often overlooked that this was not
a conference to settle wrongs committed
by Allies and neutrals, but by the enemy
only. It was German wrongs that were
on the operating table. It would have
been beautiful to have all the interna
tional wrongs on the table, but this is not
a perfect world. As a practical fact, if
this had been attempted, the Conference
would have broken up !n quarrels among
the Allies, and Germany would have been
handed again the domination of Europe.
The old guard in Germany hoped and
expected that this would result; up to
date at least they have been disappointed.
No one could be more disappointed than
the American delegation that some great
wrongs that were the result of the secret
treaties that had been written in times of
complete desperation amongst the origi
nal allies were not eradicated at the Con
ference. In this the American group
were a minority of one, endeavoring to
secure that right should be done, in a
meeting that required unanimous agree
ment. There are many other items in

the treaty which men of good will would
have liked to see different. Our dele
gation could have found cause to with
draw from the Conference on many
scores. We would have been withdraw
ing in the face of the enemy, and Ger
many, by this division of the Allies,
would have been victorious.
Greater things were accomplished by
this Conference than by any other in
history. The military oligarchys of Ger
many, Austria, and Turkey were dis
solved, and if peace is ratified in time
they will be disarmed, and thus a para
mount menace to us and the world will
be destroyed. The Poles, the Czechs,
the Finns, the Croats, and the Slovenes
and Slovacks, the Baltic States, Arme
nians, Arabs have, or will, subject to
ratification, secure their liberty. Par
cels of French, Italians, Roumanians,
Serbians, Greeks have been rejoined to
their mother countries. Representative
democratic governments were set up on
the liberated and enemy states. Meth
ods were devised by which these people
would be free from economic domina
tion and by which the Germans and
their allies would be made to pay some
thing on account of the terrible destruc
tion they have wrought as a lesson to
militarism.
The men of liberal vision at the Con
ference were steadfast for certain domi
nant ideals that mark this conference
apait from all others. First, that this
settlement should remove as many of the
immediate causes of war as possible by
destroying enemy domination over other
races. Second, by establishing the new
governments on a democratic basis so
that wars should not be made by auto
that wars should not be made by autoc
racies for the profit of their class.
Third, that there should be established a
world council—the League. Here these
newly liberated peoples could lind some
measure of protection from invasion.
Here, with the stimulation of the world
conscience awakened by this war, there
could be no hope that the wrongs among
other peoples could be brought for dis
cussion and negotiation. Here, if ag
gression were undertaken, the public
opinion of the world could be enlight
ened and the aggressor could be made
an outcast from the society of the civ
ilized nations. Thus only could some
thing constructive be done to end war.
This is an aspiration which has been
rising in the hearts of all the world.
It has become an insistence in the
minds of all those in the world to

whom the lives of our sons are precious,
to all those to whom civilization is a
tiling to be safeguarded, and all those
who see no hope for the amelioration
of the misery of those who toil if peace
cannot be maintained.
Jo form a League of Nations for this
purpose has been proposed by the leaders
of both our great parties time and
again. It has been proposed by lead
ing spirits in all civilized nations. It
belongs to no one man, it comes from
the heart and mind of the world.
1 haye always regarded it a mistake
that this was termed "League," for the
term smacks of military alliance. It
is, in fact, a council of nations that re
quires in all important matters unani
mous decision.
'1 he major provisions of this council
look toward disarmament and provision
of place ind time, for negotiation and
arbitration of quarrels. Its most potent
weapon is the determination of rights
and wrongs of international quarrels
and the enlightenment of the world
upon them and thus the moral isolation
of the aggressor. If this fails, its sec
ond weapon is the boycott, the most
potent force in the world to-day—the
force that more than any other brought
Germany to her knees. It agrees that
military force can be used in defense
against invasion of one country by an
other, but in this, as in other important
things, unanimous consent is required,
and consent must mean the United
States Congress on our side. From my
own experience, 1 believe that the dis
cussion, negotiation, arbitration, enlight
enment of public opinion and thus the
moral definition of an outcast will be
all-sufficient, coupled with the knowl
edge that other wcapous exist. The hope
that I, as an independent observer, have
placed in the League was that it would
forever relieve the United States of the
necessity to again send a single soldier
outside of our boundaries.
The opponents of the League are of
many conflicting minds. There are those
who truly wish this experiment in the
promotion and preservation of human
liberty to be tried; tTTey, however, wish
the details altered and have fears that
the details agreed upon may themselves
involve us in war. Others believe that
the interest of the United States lies in
keeping out of all international action.
Others believe that the old game of arms
is the best promoter of civilization; still
others oppose it from disappointment
that all the ills of the world were not

corrected at this one session of the na
tion. But few of tliem acknowledge that
this terrible upheaval and its aftermath
of conflicting economic, social, and politi
cal forces lias endangered the stability
of the world for years to come.
Those who formulated the League did
not expect that it would furnish an over
night solution to all uncorrected inter
national wrongs or the disruption of
the.se unloosened forces. They did ex
pect that by degrees ttiere would be a
definite alignment of opinion in the
world that would make these wrongs
less and that could in great measure
restrain the actual outbreaks of war, that
could give the world time to heal its
wounds. Even the Sermon on the
Mount did not wholly regenerate the
world.
We-hear the cry that the League obli
gates that our sons be sent to tight in
foreign lands. Yet the very intent and
structure of the League is to prevent
war. There is no obligation for the

United States to engage in military op
erations or to allow any interference
with our internal affairs without the full
consent of our representatives in the
League. If there is any danger that we
should be charged with an obligation to
go to war, either direct or implied, with
out the full consent and approval of
Congress, I believe the President will be
the first to agree to any interpretation
that this cannot be. The French govern
ment so far takes this view that it has
requested from us a separate military
guaranty for themselves.
The League is founded expressly in
the attempt to secure the pacific settle
ment of these questions without military
force. To me, every line of it is the
complete negation of militarism. Dur
ing the course of negotiations in Paris
one fact stood out with regard to the
League. Its opposition there arose en
tirely from the old militaristic regimes,
and from the reactionaries of the world
in general. They saw in it trulv the
undermining of militarism. They had
the vision to see. and even to openly
state, that it would mean the ultimate
abandonment of military force in the
world, for thev. as of old, contend that
without military exercise there is no hope
of the maintenance of human efficiency
or control of the masses. What they
foresaw has already happened in a great
military nation like the British, where
the population, broken under a load of
taxation, is responding quickly to the new
possibility of international safety with
out the burden of gigantic naval arma
ment. The reactionaries saw that under
the hope for the protection of the League
of Nations there would be a growing op
position to the burden of armament from
all those who labor with hand and mind.
It is the workers of the world who
pay the price of war, not alone in the
support of arms but in blood and in the
support to tyranny which armies mean in
peace.
All wars have hitherto been settled on
the basis of trying to create a balance of
military strength by intriguing peoples j
into various groups oT equal military j
weight—the balance of power. Tt would
have been impossible to give liberty to j
the score of new nations of militarily I
weak yet liberty-loving people without!
the League to safeguard them from in
vasion. Beyond this, every attempt to
set up this balance hitherto has ultimately
crashed in war, for its essence is militar
ism. The creation of the League brought I
new hopes into the peace, and if the
League fails these new liberated nations
must fall, for the world must readjust
itself into the balance of power, and great
wars will re-open at once in this re
alignment. In a recent visit to many of
the capitals of the new states, the first
anxious question of their officials was,
"Will America ratify the League?" Their
invariable answer was that without it
their only course was the hopeless effort
to arm themselves against stronger neigh
bors; to do it in the midst of misery;
to endeavor to set up groups and military
alliances with all the old treadmill of
oppression of arms and ultimate war.
There are many elements in Europe
who wish to see the treaty break down
and the League of Nations disappear.
For instance, during the last five months
our Allies have been growing weaker
from a military point of view, due to the
necessity of demobilizing their armies,
while at the same time the reactionary
group in Germany has been growing in
strength through the recreation of hopes
of yet securing a division of the Allies.
At the time I left Europe a month ago,
German militarism had already re-estab
lished itself as a well-disciplined, well
officered army of at least 400,000 men,
largely congregated on the Polish fron
tier and even defying the government at
Berlin. Under the alarm of this danger,
the Poles, in the midst of the greatest
economic misery that a nation ever knew,
have been trying to create an army of
500,000 men for their protection from the
Germans on one side and the Bolsheviks
on the other. If the treaty is ratified the
German army will be reduced to 200,000
men and dispersed over Germany, and
their extra armament destroyed. The
failure of the treaty means the invasion
of the Polish state. This is only one of
the powder magazines in Europe which
cannot be destroyed *mtil this treaty is
ratified, and during every day of delay
more explosives are poured into them.
For good or ill, the entire treaty was
constructed around this central theme of
a League of Nations to prevent war. A
score of provisions in tTie treaty and out
side the covenant necessitate its erec
tion. To avoid causes of war, the
League has been made the trustee to
secure outlets to the sea, to secure free
ports to inland peoples, to settle deferred
disputes which could not otherwise hope
for solution without dangerous friction.
The treaties themselves cannot be car
ried out without the League. If the
League falls the treaties also fall.
The boundaries of these new states
cannot precisely include all their own
nationals, for the borders are lined with
racial islands and friction. Peace and
a moderating council are required for
readjustments. Their outlets to sea by
rail, canal, and viver are through other
states; their whole political and economic
situation demands peace for the growth
of order and the prevention of anarchy.
If the balance of power has to supplant
the League of Nations we will have
torn asunder the only hope that Europe
will not break into further wars of races,
classes, and groups that will take her
civilization back to the Middle Ages. I
am convinced that if we attempt now
to revise the treaty we shall tread a road
through European chaos. Even if we
managed to keep our soldiers out of it
we will not scape fearful economic
losses.
If the League is to break down we
must at once prepare to fight. Few
people seem to realize the desperation to
which Europe has been reduced. During
the coming winter son.c of them will look
with longing eyes on this rich, fat na
tion, possessing great surpluses of every
human necessity, wh/fe they endure in
evitable hunger and cold. At the same
time the energy of our population is sup
planting them in places where their mer
chants expect to market their goods and
operate their ships. Others of them will
he plunged into war with their neighbors,
and we have already experienced the diffi
culty of maintaining neutrality with self
respect and safety. We cannot fiddle
while Rome burns.
The Allies may themselves ratify this
treaty without us, and thus assemble a
Council of Nations of their own in an
endeavor to solve the problem of Europe.
It would be a Council of Europe, and in
the midst of these terrible times, with the
debts they owe to us, the material they
must have from us or starve, I would
rather be represented therein lest it be
come a League of Europe against the
Western Hemisphere. A peace without
us means more army and navy for us,
with the old treadmill of taxes and
dangers.

could be protected and the strong
curbed, that the United States could it
self be protected. Tf they were traitors
to their country it was because they were
wrong in assuming that the American
people wished an effort made to destroy
the seeds of war and thus to secure the
growth of liberty.
The treaty finally reached at Paris is
by no means perfect. I see no method
by which it could have been made per
fect when five hundred men, represent
ing twenty-three different nationalities,
were engaged in its negotiations, and
agreement had to be unanimous. Diff
ence in national character and in national
aspirations could but cause much dif
ference in views. Many of them repre
sented desperate, passionate or selfish ob
jects, some were dominated by political
ideals of the last century, yet the most
were actuated by the prayers of the com
mon people, who really fought this war,
that it should be the last war. There ex
isted in the world before this Conference
scores of those major international
wrongs which breed war. Of these the
Peace Conference corrected some, but it
will take perhaps a hundred years for
the men of good will to correct them all.
It is often overlooked that this was not
a conference to settle wrongs committed
by Allies and neutrals, but by the enemy
only. It was German wrongs that were
on the operating table. It would have
been beautiful to have all the interna
tional wrongs on the table, but this is not
a perfect world. As a practical fact, if
this had been attempted, the Conference
would have broken up !n quarrels among
the Allies, and Germany would have been
handed again the domination of Europe.
The old guard in Germany hoped and
expected that this would result; up to
date at least they have been disappointed.
No one could be more disappointed than
the American delegation that some great
wrongs that were the result of the secret
treaties that had been written in times of
complete desperation amongst the origi
nal allies were not eradicated at the Con
ference. In this the American group
were a minority of one, endeavoring to
secure that right should be done, in a
meeting that required unanimous agree
ment. There are many other items in

the treaty which men of good will would
have liked to see different. Our dele
gation could have found cause to with
draw from the Conference on many
scores. We would have been withdraw
ing in the face of the enemy, and Ger
many, by this division of the Allies,
would have been victorious.
Greater things were accomplished by
this Conference than by any other in
history. The military oligarchys of Ger
many, Austria, and Turkey were dis
solved, and if peace is ratified in time
they will be disarmed, and thus a para
mount menace to us and the world will
be destroyed. The Poles, the Czechs,
the Finns, the Croats, and the Slovenes
and Slovacks, the Baltic States, Arme
nians, Arabs have, or will, subject to
ratification, secure their liberty. Par
cels of French, Italians, Roumanians,
Serbians, Greeks have been rejoined to
their mother countries. Representative
democratic governments were set up on
the liberated and enemy states. Meth
ods were devised by which these people
would be free from economic domina
tion and by which the Germans and
their allies would be made to pay some
thing on account of the terrible destruc
tion they have wrought as a lesson to
militarism.
The men of liberal vision at the Con
ference were steadfast for certain domi
nant ideals that mark this conference
apait from all others. First, that this
settlement should remove as many of the
immediate causes of war as possible by
destroying enemy domination over other
races. Second, by establishing the new
governments on a democratic basis so
that wars should not be made by auto
that wars should not be made by autoc
racies for the profit of their class.
Third, that there should be established a
world council—the League. Here these
newly liberated peoples could lind some
measure of protection from invasion.
Here, with the stimulation of the world
conscience awakened by this war, there
could be no hope that the wrongs among
other peoples could be brought for dis
cussion and negotiation. Here, if ag
gression were undertaken, the public
opinion of the world could be enlight
ened and the aggressor could be made
an outcast from the society of the civ
ilized nations. Thus only could some
thing constructive be done to end war.
This is an aspiration which has been
rising in the hearts of all the world.
It has become an insistence in the
minds of all those in the world to

whom the lives of our sons are precious,
to all those to whom civilization is a
tiling to be safeguarded, and all those
who see no hope for the amelioration
of the misery of those who toil if peace
cannot be maintained.
Jo form a League of Nations for this
purpose has been proposed by the leaders
of both our great parties time and
again. It has been proposed by lead
ing spirits in all civilized nations. It
belongs to no one man, it comes from
the heart and mind of the world.
1 haye always regarded it a mistake
that this was termed "League," for the
term smacks of military alliance. It
is, in fact, a council of nations that re
quires in all important matters unani
mous decision.
'1 he major provisions of this council
look toward disarmament and provision
of place ind time, for negotiation and
arbitration of quarrels. Its most potent
weapon is the determination of rights
and wrongs of international quarrels
and the enlightenment of the world
upon them and thus the moral isolation
of the aggressor. If this fails, its sec
ond weapon is the boycott, the most
potent force in the world to-day—the
force that more than any other brought
Germany to her knees. It agrees that
military force can be used in defense
against invasion of one country by an
other, but in this, as in other important
things, unanimous consent is required,
and consent must mean the United
States Congress on our side. From my
own experience, 1 believe that the dis
cussion, negotiation, arbitration, enlight
enment of public opinion and thus the
moral definition of an outcast will be
all-sufficient, coupled with the knowl
edge that other wcapous exist. The hope
that I, as an independent observer, have
placed in the League was that it would
forever relieve the United States of the
necessity to again send a single soldier
outside of our boundaries.
The opponents of the League are of
many conflicting minds. There are those
who truly wish this experiment in the
promotion and preservation of human
liberty to be tried; tTTey, however, wish
the details altered and have fears that
the details agreed upon may themselves
involve us in war. Others believe that
the interest of the United States lies in
keeping out of all international action.
Others believe that the old game of arms
is the best promoter of civilization; still
others oppose it from disappointment
that all the ills of the world were not

corrected at this one session of the na
tion. But few of tliem acknowledge that
this terrible upheaval and its aftermath
of conflicting economic, social, and politi
cal forces lias endangered the stability
of the world for years to come.
Those who formulated the League did
not expect that it would furnish an over
night solution to all uncorrected inter
national wrongs or the disruption of
the.se unloosened forces. They did ex
pect that by degrees ttiere would be a
definite alignment of opinion in the
world that would make these wrongs
less and that could in great measure
restrain the actual outbreaks of war, that
could give the world time to heal its
wounds. Even the Sermon on the
Mount did not wholly regenerate the
world.
We-hear the cry that the League obli
gates that our sons be sent to tight in
foreign lands. Yet the very intent and
structure of the League is to prevent
war. There is no obligation for the

United States to engage in military op
erations or to allow any interference
with our internal affairs without the full
consent of our representatives in the
League. If there is any danger that we
should be charged with an obligation to
go to war, either direct or implied, with
out the full consent and approval of
Congress, I believe the President will be
the first to agree to any interpretation
that this cannot be. The French govern
ment so far takes this view that it has
requested from us a separate military
guaranty for themselves.
The League is founded expressly in
the attempt to secure the pacific settle
ment of these questions without military
force. To me, every line of it is the
complete negation of militarism. Dur
ing the course of negotiations in Paris
one fact stood out with regard to the
League. Its opposition there arose en
tirely from the old militaristic regimes,
and from the reactionaries of the world
in general. They saw in it trulv the
undermining of militarism. They had
the vision to see. and even to openly
state, that it would mean the ultimate
abandonment of military force in the
world, for thev. as of old, contend that
without military exercise there is no hope
of the maintenance of human efficiency
or control of the masses. What they
foresaw has already happened in a great
military nation like the British, where
the population, broken under a load of
taxation, is responding quickly to the new
possibility of international safety with
out the burden of gigantic naval arma
ment. The reactionaries saw that under
the hope for the protection of the League
of Nations there would be a growing op
position to the burden of armament from
all those who labor with hand and mind.
It is the workers of the world who
pay the price of war, not alone in the
support of arms but in blood and in the
support to tyranny which armies mean in
peace.
All wars have hitherto been settled on
the basis of trying to create a balance of
military strength by intriguing peoples j
into various groups oT equal military j
weight—the balance of power. Tt would
have been impossible to give liberty to j
the score of new nations of militarily I
weak yet liberty-loving people without!
the League to safeguard them from in
vasion. Beyond this, every attempt to
set up this balance hitherto has ultimately
crashed in war, for its essence is militar
ism. The creation of the League brought I
new hopes into the peace, and if the
League fails these new liberated nations
must fall, for the world must readjust
itself into the balance of power, and great
wars will re-open at once in this re
alignment. In a recent visit to many of
the capitals of the new states, the first
anxious question of their officials was,
"Will America ratify the League?" Their
invariable answer was that without it
their only course was the hopeless effort
to arm themselves against stronger neigh
bors; to do it in the midst of misery;
to endeavor to set up groups and military
alliances with all the old treadmill of
oppression of arms and ultimate war.
There are many elements in Europe
who wish to see the treaty break down
and the League of Nations disappear.
For instance, during the last five months
our Allies have been growing weaker
from a military point of view, due to the
necessity of demobilizing their armies,
while at the same time the reactionary
group in Germany has been growing in
strength through the recreation of hopes
of yet securing a division of the Allies.
At the time I left Europe a month ago,
German militarism had already re-estab
lished itself as a well-disciplined, well
officered army of at least 400,000 men,
largely congregated on the Polish fron
tier and even defying the government at
Berlin. Under the alarm of this danger,
the Poles, in the midst of the greatest
economic misery that a nation ever knew,
have been trying to create an army of
500,000 men for their protection from the
Germans on one side and the Bolsheviks
on the other. If the treaty is ratified the
German army will be reduced to 200,000
men and dispersed over Germany, and
their extra armament destroyed. The
failure of the treaty means the invasion
of the Polish state. This is only one of
the powder magazines in Europe which
cannot be destroyed *mtil this treaty is
ratified, and during every day of delay
more explosives are poured into them.
For good or ill, the entire treaty was
constructed around this central theme of
a League of Nations to prevent war. A
score of provisions in tTie treaty and out
side the covenant necessitate its erec
tion. To avoid causes of war, the
League has been made the trustee to
secure outlets to the sea, to secure free
ports to inland peoples, to settle deferred
disputes which could not otherwise hope
for solution without dangerous friction.
The treaties themselves cannot be car
ried out without the League. If the
League falls the treaties also fall.
The boundaries of these new states
cannot precisely include all their own
nationals, for the borders are lined with
racial islands and friction. Peace and
a moderating council are required for
readjustments. Their outlets to sea by
rail, canal, and viver are through other
states; their whole political and economic
situation demands peace for the growth
of order and the prevention of anarchy.
If the balance of power has to supplant
the League of Nations we will have
torn asunder the only hope that Europe
will not break into further wars of races,
classes, and groups that will take her
civilization back to the Middle Ages. I
am convinced that if we attempt now
to revise the treaty we shall tread a road
through European chaos. Even if we
managed to keep our soldiers out of it
we will not scape fearful economic
losses.
If the League is to break down we
must at once prepare to fight. Few
people seem to realize the desperation to
which Europe has been reduced. During
the coming winter son.c of them will look
with longing eyes on this rich, fat na
tion, possessing great surpluses of every
human necessity, wh/fe they endure in
evitable hunger and cold. At the same
time the energy of our population is sup
planting them in places where their mer
chants expect to market their goods and
operate their ships. Others of them will
he plunged into war with their neighbors,
and we have already experienced the diffi
culty of maintaining neutrality with self
respect and safety. We cannot fiddle
while Rome burns.
The Allies may themselves ratify this
treaty without us, and thus assemble a
Council of Nations of their own in an
endeavor to solve the problem of Europe.
It would be a Council of Europe, and in
the midst of these terrible times, with the
debts they owe to us, the material they
must have from us or starve, I would
rather be represented therein lest it be
come a League of Europe against the
Western Hemisphere. A peace without
us means more army and navy for us,
with the old treadmill of taxes and
dangers.
It is true we are not loved by certain
classes of people, some of them among
our former allies. It is untrue, however,
to say that the masses of any nation now
hate us. It is still more untrue to say
that the newly liberated peoples look to
us with other than conviction that our
moral leadership is their only hope. We
are not loved by any military class,
whether in the allied or enemy countries.
()ur whole object has been to destroy
their calling, to undermine their class.
! lie great masses of burdened working
people, however, look for us to support
this one hope of relief from domination
from burdens and misery of arms and
war.
Neither the gospel of hate nor the
gospel of unpreparedness are the roads
to peace. The true road lies in every
effort to remove the causes of war, not
in tearing down such structure of peace
as we have, nor in blindness to present
dangers.
Those who think we can isolate our
selves seem to ignore the fact that mod
ern communication has shortened our
distance from our neighbors from a
month to an hour. A vast amount of
our civilization and the daily improve
ments of life that come to our people
are the products of the ideas and in
telligence and labor of our neighbors.
If we believe we can see our neighbors
return to thirty years' war through the
breakdown of this treaty and we still
maintain our progress, it is the egotism
of insanity. We arc an overseas people,
and we are dependent upon Europe for
marks for the surplus products of our
farmers and laborers. Without order in
Europe we will at best have business de
pression, unemployment, and all their
burden of troubles. With renewed dis
organization in Europe, social diseases
and anarchy thrive, and we are infected
with every social wind of Europe. We
are forced to interest ourselves in the
welfare of the world if we are to thrive.
There is no American who has spent the
last ten months in Europe who does not
pray that we should g*r out of entangle
ment in the sordid selfishness, the pas
sions, the misery of it. But our expan
sion overseas has entangled us for good
or ill, and I stand for an honest attempt
to join with Europe's better spirit to
prevent these entanglements from in
volving us in war. We are not dealing
with perfection; we are dealing with
the lesser of evils. These are reasons
of interest.
There are also reasons of idealism,
and true national interest lies along the
path of practical ideals, and there are
ideals in Europe. During the last hun
dred and fifty years a far larger pro
portion of our citizens liave grown far
ahead of those of Europe in outlook on
life, in disinterested sense of justice, in
sympathy with the downtrodden. It
was with the hope of ending war that
we went into it, and to fix it in inter
national law that dominated our repre
sentatives in the Peace Conference. We
have expended the lives of our sons
and an enormous portion of our wealth,
hoping to see these ends. For us to re
fuse to enter into a joint attempt with
the well-thinking sections of a large
part of the world to establish a contin
uing moral conscience against war is the
utmost folly in our own interest.
We have been the center and inspira
tion of democracy for a hundred years.
We have given sympathy and encour
agement to every aspiration for self-gov
ernment for all this time. We have from
our experience in its blessings believed
it made for peace and well-being. We
enjoy from it the highest standard of
living in the world. We went to Eu
rope with our best blood and our treas
ures and fought the attempt to impose
autocracy on the world. We won. We
imposed democracy all over Europe. We
set up a score of new democracies—and
they are many of them peoples of our
own blood—the Baltic, Polish, and Slav
races. Arc we to refuse our counsels to
these peoples now struggling to realize
our own ideals? Curious as it may seem,
this also embraces Germany itself. That
sincerely democratic group which to-day
controls Germany is losing ground lie
fore the old reactionary group who em
ploy tlu- hope of the failure of the league
to fan the renewed hope of domination.
I am one of those who hold that this
war would never have happened if the
nations of Europe had accepted the invi
tation of Sir Edward Gray to a confer
ence of civilians in July, 1914. I believe
that if the intelligence of the world can
be aggregated around a table, the pres
sures from the responsibility of these
men for the possible enormous loss of

life and the fabulous amount of human
misery created by their failure to pre
vent war, are such that no body of de
cent men in these times can fail to se
cure some sort of solution short of war.
We have now seen the most terrible five
years of history because the reaction
aries of Europe refused to come into a
room to discuss the welfare of humanity.
From this mightv political, social, and
economic upheaval there are a host of
outstanding problems which can Weed
war at any minute. The Liberal world
is asking us to come into a Council to
find the solution for these things. It is
not asking for soldiers, it is asking for
our economic and moral weight, our
idealism, and our disinterested sense of
justice. Are we willing to take the re
sponsibility that now rests on the souls
of those men in Europe wlio refused this
invitation in 1914?
DEIIHAPS the most ti nificant speech
ever delivered in t|e Stanford As
sembly Hall by any speaker, was that
of Herbert Hoover, '95, yesterday aft
ernoon. No man has been more looked
to by a greater number of people dur
ing the world war, than Mr. Hoover,
and on this account, his words spoken
yesterday concerning the future peace
of the world will 1 e barkened to Ly
all nations. Stanford was indeed
honored by Mr. Hoover when he chose
his Alma Mater as the most fitting
place in which to give the firs' public
expressi jn of those views which the
entire world has been waiting to hear.
In light of the stormy debate which
has been going on in the United
States Senate, and the tours made by
President Wilson and Senator John
son, Mr. Hoover made several signi
ficant points. The fact that he ap
proved the debate that has swept the
country because it brought the prob
lems of the League of Nations so
effectively before the people of this
country, came somewhat as a surprise.
"This debate is laying the foundation
to the league," he said.
In reply to the much repeated argu
ment of the Republican leaders, Mr.
Soover stated that he did not believe
tluJl the Un'ted States would evei be
forced into a world war without the
unanimous vote of its own leaders.

In other words the League of Nations
.cannot force any nation into war with
out the consent of that nation.
The complete tevt of Hoover's great
speech follows:
1 have been urged by Mr. Taft and
others to state at some greater length
my views on the peace treaty, and I
take this occasion to present them to
my own townspeople. During the ten
months between the armistice and har
vest I acted as the economic director
for the Supreme War Council. I was
necessarily in intimate contact witli the
political and economic situation all
over Europe. I was not one of the
American Peace delegates, but the pur
pose of my office was to act on behalf
of the United States and the Peace
Conference in an effort to save life and
prevent anarchy while the peace was
negotiated. I therefore had an advan
tageous position to independently ob
serve the growth of ideas in the Con
ference and the re-percussions of these
ideas through Europe.
I am not of those who have an im
patience of honest debate. 1 believe
that the debate of the League of Na
tions going on in the United States is
building tlic very foundations of the
League. It is bringing home to every
household in the country the necessity
and possibility of providing for our own
safety and of providing for the safety
of the world as a whole without great
armies or navies. Nor do I believe in
the criticism of the Senate for not ac
cepting out of hand this document so
laboriously evolved by five hundred con
flicting minds in Paris. It is a funda
mental part of our institutions that the
Senate shall scrutinize these matters.
Consideration and debate by the Senate
is not trahorship.
Nor were those Americans traitors
who. in representing us in Paris, fought
for every inch of hope that the weak
could be protected and the strong
curbed, that the United States could it
self be protected. Tf they were traitors
to their country it was because they were
wrong in assuming that the American
people wished an effort made to destroy
the seeds of war and thus to secure the
growth of liberty.
The treaty finally reached at Paris is
by no means perfect. I see no method
by which it could have been made per

ing twenty-three different nationalities,
were engaged in its negotiations, and
agreement had to be unanimous. Diff
ence in national character and in national
aspirations could but cause much dif

sented desperate, passionate or selfish ob
jects, some were dominated by political
ideals of the last century, yet the most

the vision to see. and even to openly
state, that it would mean the ultimate
abandonment of military force in the
world, for thev. as of old, contend that
without military exercise there is no hope
of the maintenance of human efficiency
or control of the masses. What they
foresaw has already happened in a great
military nation like the British, where
the population, broken under a load of
taxation, is responding quickly to the new
possibility of international safety with
out the burden of gigantic naval arma
ment. The reactionaries saw that under
the hope for the protection of the League
of Nations there would be a growing op
position to the burden of armament from
all those who labor with hand and mind.
It is the workers of the world who
pay the price of war, not alone in the
support of arms but in blood and in the
support to tyranny which armies mean in
peace.
All wars have hitherto been settled on
the basis of trying to create a balance of
military strength by intriguing peoples j
into various groups oT equal military j
weight—the balance of power. Tt would
have been impossible to give liberty to j
the score of new nations of militarily I
weak yet liberty-loving people without!
the League to safeguard them from in
vasion. Beyond this, every attempt to
set up this balance hitherto has ultimately
crashed in war, for its essence is militar
ism. The creation of the League brought I
new hopes into the peace, and if the
League fails these new liberated nations
must fall, for the world must readjust
itself into the balance of power, and great
wars will re-open at once in this re
alignment. In a recent visit to many of
the capitals of the new states, the first
anxious question of their officials was,
"Will America ratify the League?" Their
invariable answer was that without it
their only course was the hopeless effort
to arm themselves against stronger neigh
bors; to do it in the midst of misery;
to endeavor to set up groups and military
alliances with all the old treadmill of
oppression of arms and ultimate war.
There are many elements in Europe
who wish to see the treaty break down
and the League of Nations disappear.
For instance, during the last five months
our Allies have been growing weaker
from a military point of view, due to the
necessity of demobilizing their armies,
while at the same time the reactionary
group in Germany has been growing in
strength through the recreation of hopes
of yet securing a division of the Allies.
At the time I left Europe a month ago,
German militarism had already re-estab
lished itself as a well-disciplined, well
officered army of at least 400,000 men,
largely congregated on the Polish fron
tier and even defying the government at
Berlin. Under the alarm of this danger,
the Poles, in the midst of the greatest
economic misery that a nation ever knew,
have been trying to create an army of
500,000 men for their protection from the
Germans on one side and the Bolsheviks
on the other. If the treaty is ratified the
German army will be reduced to 200,000
men and dispersed over Germany, and
their extra armament destroyed. The
failure of the treaty means the invasion
of the Polish state. This is only one of
the powder magazines in Europe which
cannot be destroyed *mtil this treaty is
ratified, and during every day of delay
more explosives are poured into them.
For good or ill, the entire treaty was
constructed around this central theme of
a League of Nations to prevent war. A
score of provisions in tTie treaty and out
side the covenant necessitate its erec
tion. To avoid causes of war, the
League has been made the trustee to
secure outlets to the sea, to secure free
ports to inland peoples, to settle deferred
disputes which could not otherwise hope
for solution without dangerous friction.
The treaties themselves cannot be car
ried out without the League. If the
League falls the treaties also fall.
The boundaries of these new states
cannot precisely include all their own
nationals, for the borders are lined with
racial islands and friction. Peace and
a moderating council are required for
readjustments. Their outlets to sea by
rail, canal, and viver are through other
states; their whole political and economic
situation demands peace for the growth
of order and the prevention of anarchy.
If the balance of power has to supplant
the League of Nations we will have
torn asunder the only hope that Europe
will not break into further wars of races,
classes, and groups that will take her
civilization back to the Middle Ages. I
am convinced that if we attempt now
to revise the treaty we shall tread a road
through European chaos. Even if we
managed to keep our soldiers out of it
we will not scape fearful economic
losses.
If the League is to break down we
must at once prepare to fight. Few
people seem to realize the desperation to
which Europe has been reduced. During
the coming winter son.c of them will look
with longing eyes on this rich, fat na
tion, possessing great surpluses of every
human necessity, wh/fe they endure in
evitable hunger and cold. At the same
time the energy of our population is sup
planting them in places where their mer
chants expect to market their goods and
operate their ships. Others of them will
he plunged into war with their neighbors,
and we have already experienced the diffi
culty of maintaining neutrality with self
respect and safety. We cannot fiddle
while Rome burns.
The Allies may themselves ratify this
treaty without us, and thus assemble a
Council of Nations of their own in an
endeavor to solve the problem of Europe.
It would be a Council of Europe, and in
the midst of these terrible times, with the
debts they owe to us, the material they
must have from us or starve, I would
rather be represented therein lest it be
come a League of Europe against the
Western Hemisphere. A peace without
us means more army and navy for us,
with the old treadmill of taxes and
dangers.
It is true we are not loved by certain
classes of people, some of them among
our former allies. It is untrue, however,
to say that the masses of any nation now
hate us. It is still more untrue to say
that the newly liberated peoples look to
us with other than conviction that our
moral leadership is their only hope. We
are not loved by any military class,
whether in the allied or enemy countries.
()ur whole object has been to destroy
their calling, to undermine their class.
! lie great masses of burdened working
people, however, look for us to support
this one hope of relief from domination
from burdens and misery of arms and
war.
Neither the gospel of hate nor the
gospel of unpreparedness are the roads
to peace. The true road lies in every
effort to remove the causes of war, not
in tearing down such structure of peace
as we have, nor in blindness to present
dangers.
Those who think we can isolate our
selves seem to ignore the fact that mod
ern communication has shortened our
distance from our neighbors from a
month to an hour. A vast amount of
our civilization and the daily improve
ments of life that come to our people
are the products of the ideas and in
telligence and labor of our neighbors.
If we believe we can see our neighbors
return to thirty years' war through the
breakdown of this treaty and we still
maintain our progress, it is the egotism
of insanity. We arc an overseas people,
and we are dependent upon Europe for
marks for the surplus products of our
farmers and laborers. Without order in
Europe we will at best have business de
pression, unemployment, and all their
burden of troubles. With renewed dis
organization in Europe, social diseases
and anarchy thrive, and we are infected
with every social wind of Europe. We
are forced to interest ourselves in the
welfare of the world if we are to thrive.
There is no American who has spent the
last ten months in Europe who does not
pray that we should g*r out of entangle
ment in the sordid selfishness, the pas
sions, the misery of it. But our expan
sion overseas has entangled us for good
or ill, and I stand for an honest attempt
to join with Europe's better spirit to
prevent these entanglements from in
volving us in war. We are not dealing
with perfection; we are dealing with
the lesser of evils. These are reasons
of interest.
There are also reasons of idealism,
and true national interest lies along the
path of practical ideals, and there are
ideals in Europe. During the last hun
dred and fifty years a far larger pro
portion of our citizens liave grown far
ahead of those of Europe in outlook on
life, in disinterested sense of justice, in
sympathy with the downtrodden. It
was with the hope of ending war that
we went into it, and to fix it in inter
national law that dominated our repre
sentatives in the Peace Conference. We
have expended the lives of our sons
and an enormous portion of our wealth,
hoping to see these ends. For us to re
fuse to enter into a joint attempt with
the well-thinking sections of a large
part of the world to establish a contin
uing moral conscience against war is the
utmost folly in our own interest.
We have been the center and inspira
tion of democracy for a hundred years.
We have given sympathy and encour
agement to every aspiration for self-gov
ernment for all this time. We have from
our experience in its blessings believed
it made for peace and well-being. We
enjoy from it the highest standard of
living in the world. We went to Eu
rope with our best blood and our treas
ures and fought the attempt to impose
autocracy on the world. We won. We
imposed democracy all over Europe. We
set up a score of new democracies—and
they are many of them peoples of our
own blood—the Baltic, Polish, and Slav
races. Arc we to refuse our counsels to
these peoples now struggling to realize
our own ideals? Curious as it may seem,
this also embraces Germany itself. That
sincerely democratic group which to-day
controls Germany is losing ground lie
fore the old reactionary group who em
ploy tlu- hope of the failure of the league
to fan the renewed hope of domination.
I am one of those who hold that this
war would never have happened if the
nations of Europe had accepted the invi
tation of Sir Edward Gray to a confer
ence of civilians in July, 1914. I believe
that if the intelligence of the world can
be aggregated around a table, the pres
sures from the responsibility of these
men for the possible enormous loss of

life and the fabulous amount of human
misery created by their failure to pre
vent war, are such that no body of de
cent men in these times can fail to se
cure some sort of solution short of war.
We have now seen the most terrible five
years of history because the reaction
aries of Europe refused to come into a
room to discuss the welfare of humanity.
From this mightv political, social, and
economic upheaval there are a host of
outstanding problems which can Weed
war at any minute. The Liberal world
is asking us to come into a Council to
find the solution for these things. It is
not asking for soldiers, it is asking for
our economic and moral weight, our
idealism, and our disinterested sense of
justice. Are we willing to take the re
sponsibility that now rests on the souls
of those men in Europe wlio refused this
invitation in 1914?
DEIIHAPS the most ti nificant speech
ever delivered in t|e Stanford As
sembly Hall by any speaker, was that
of Herbert Hoover, '95, yesterday aft
ernoon. No man has been more looked
to by a greater number of people dur
ing the world war, than Mr. Hoover,
and on this account, his words spoken
yesterday concerning the future peace
of the world will 1 e barkened to Ly
all nations. Stanford was indeed
honored by Mr. Hoover when he chose
his Alma Mater as the most fitting
place in which to give the firs' public
expressi jn of those views which the
entire world has been waiting to hear.
In light of the stormy debate which
has been going on in the United
States Senate, and the tours made by
President Wilson and Senator John
son, Mr. Hoover made several signi
ficant points. The fact that he ap
proved the debate that has swept the
country because it brought the prob
lems of the League of Nations so
effectively before the people of this
country, came somewhat as a surprise.
"This debate is laying the foundation
to the league," he said.
In reply to the much repeated argu
ment of the Republican leaders, Mr.
Soover stated that he did not believe
tluJl the Un'ted States would evei be
forced into a world war without the
unanimous vote of its own leaders.

In other words the League of Nations
.cannot force any nation into war with
out the consent of that nation.
The complete tevt of Hoover's great
speech follows:
1 have been urged by Mr. Taft and
others to state at some greater length
my views on the peace treaty, and I
take this occasion to present them to
my own townspeople. During the ten
months between the armistice and har
vest I acted as the economic director
for the Supreme War Council. I was
necessarily in intimate contact witli the
political and economic situation all
over Europe. I was not one of the
American Peace delegates, but the pur
pose of my office was to act on behalf
of the United States and the Peace
Conference in an effort to save life and
prevent anarchy while the peace was
negotiated. I therefore had an advan
tageous position to independently ob
serve the growth of ideas in the Con
ference and the re-percussions of these
ideas through Europe.
I am not of those who have an im
patience of honest debate. 1 believe
that the debate of the League of Na
tions going on in the United States is
building tlic very foundations of the
League. It is bringing home to every
household in the country the necessity
and possibility of providing for our own
safety and of providing for the safety
of the world as a whole without great
armies or navies. Nor do I believe in
the criticism of the Senate for not ac
cepting out of hand this document so
laboriously evolved by five hundred con
flicting minds in Paris. It is a funda
mental part of our institutions that the
Senate shall scrutinize these matters.
Consideration and debate by the Senate
is not trahorship.
Nor were those Americans traitors
who. in representing us in Paris, fought
for every inch of hope that the weak
could be protected and the strong
curbed, that the United States could it
self be protected. Tf they were traitors
to their country it was because they were
wrong in assuming that the American
people wished an effort made to destroy
the seeds of war and thus to secure the
growth of liberty.
The treaty finally reached at Paris is
by no means perfect. I see no method
by which it could have been made per
fect when five hundred men, represent
ing twenty-three different nationalities,
were engaged in its negotiations, and
agreement had to be unanimous. Diff
ence in national character and in national
aspirations could but cause much dif
ference in views. Many of them repre
sented desperate, passionate or selfish ob
jects, some were dominated by political
ideals of the last century, yet the most
were actuated by the prayers of the com
mon people, who really fought this war,
that it should be the last war. There ex
isted in the world before this Conference
scores of those major international
wrongs which breed war. Of these the
Peace Conference corrected some, but it
will take perhaps a hundred years for
the men of good will to correct them all.
It is often overlooked that this was not
a conference to settle wrongs committed
by Allies and neutrals, but by the enemy
only. It was German wrongs that were
on the operating table. It would have
been beautiful to have all the interna
tional wrongs on the table, but this is not
a perfect world. As a practical fact, if
this had been attempted, the Conference
would have broken up !n quarrels among
the Allies, and Germany would have been
handed again the domination of Europe.
The old guard in Germany hoped and
expected that this would result; up to
date at least they have been disappointed.
No one could be more disappointed than
the American delegation that some great
wrongs that were the result of the secret
treaties that had been written in times of
complete desperation amongst the origi
nal allies were not eradicated at the Con
ference. In this the American group
were a minority of one, endeavoring to
secure that right should be done, in a
meeting that required unanimous agree
ment. There are many other items in

the treaty which men of good will would
have liked to see different. Our dele
gation could have found cause to with
draw from the Conference on many
scores. We would have been withdraw
ing in the face of the enemy, and Ger
many, by this division of the Allies,
would have been victorious.
Greater things were accomplished by
this Conference than by any other in
history. The military oligarchys of Ger
many, Austria, and Turkey were dis
solved, and if peace is ratified in time
they will be disarmed, and thus a para
mount menace to us and the world will
be destroyed. The Poles, the Czechs,
the Finns, the Croats, and the Slovenes
and Slovacks, the Baltic States, Arme
nians, Arabs have, or will, subject to
ratification, secure their liberty. Par
cels of French, Italians, Roumanians,
Serbians, Greeks have been rejoined to
their mother countries. Representative
democratic governments were set up on
the liberated and enemy states. Meth
ods were devised by which these people
would be free from economic domina
tion and by which the Germans and
their allies would be made to pay some
thing on account of the terrible destruc
tion they have wrought as a lesson to
militarism.
The men of liberal vision at the Con
ference were steadfast for certain domi
nant ideals that mark this conference
apait from all others. First, that this
settlement should remove as many of the
immediate causes of war as possible by
destroying enemy domination over other
races. Second, by establishing the new
governments on a democratic basis so
that wars should not be made by auto
that wars should not be made by autoc
racies for the profit of their class.
Third, that there should be established a
world council—the League. Here these
newly liberated peoples could lind some
measure of protection from invasion.
Here, with the stimulation of the world
conscience awakened by this war, there
could be no hope that the wrongs among
other peoples could be brought for dis
cussion and negotiation. Here, if ag
gression were undertaken, the public
opinion of the world could be enlight
ened and the aggressor could be made
an outcast from the society of the civ
ilized nations. Thus only could some
thing constructive be done to end war.
This is an aspiration which has been
rising in the hearts of all the world.
It has become an insistence in the
minds of all those in the world to

whom the lives of our sons are precious,
to all those to whom civilization is a
tiling to be safeguarded, and all those
who see no hope for the amelioration
of the misery of those who toil if peace
cannot be maintained.
Jo form a League of Nations for this
purpose has been proposed by the leaders
of both our great parties time and
again. It has been proposed by lead
ing spirits in all civilized nations. It
belongs to no one man, it comes from
the heart and mind of the world.
1 haye always regarded it a mistake
that this was termed "League," for the
term smacks of military alliance. It
is, in fact, a council of nations that re
quires in all important matters unani
mous decision.
'1 he major provisions of this council
look toward disarmament and provision
of place ind time, for negotiation and
arbitration of quarrels. Its most potent
weapon is the determination of rights
and wrongs of international quarrels
and the enlightenment of the world
upon them and thus the moral isolation
of the aggressor. If this fails, its sec
ond weapon is the boycott, the most
potent force in the world to-day—the
force that more than any other brought
Germany to her knees. It agrees that
military force can be used in defense
against invasion of one country by an
other, but in this, as in other important
things, unanimous consent is required,
and consent must mean the United
States Congress on our side. From my
own experience, 1 believe that the dis
cussion, negotiation, arbitration, enlight
enment of public opinion and thus the
moral definition of an outcast will be
all-sufficient, coupled with the knowl
edge that other wcapous exist. The hope
that I, as an independent observer, have
placed in the League was that it would
forever relieve the United States of the
necessity to again send a single soldier
outside of our boundaries.
The opponents of the League are of
many conflicting minds. There are those
who truly wish this experiment in the
promotion and preservation of human
liberty to be tried; tTTey, however, wish
the details altered and have fears that
the details agreed upon may themselves
involve us in war. Others believe that
the interest of the United States lies in
keeping out of all international action.
Others believe that the old game of arms
is the best promoter of civilization; still
others oppose it from disappointment
that all the ills of the world were not

corrected at this one session of the na
tion. But few of tliem acknowledge that
this terrible upheaval and its aftermath
of conflicting economic, social, and politi
cal forces lias endangered the stability
of the world for years to come.
Those who formulated the League did
not expect that it would furnish an over
night solution to all uncorrected inter
national wrongs or the disruption of
the.se unloosened forces. They did ex
pect that by degrees ttiere would be a
definite alignment of opinion in the
world that would make these wrongs
less and that could in great measure
restrain the actual outbreaks of war, that
could give the world time to heal its
wounds. Even the Sermon on the
Mount did not wholly regenerate the
world.
We-hear the cry that the League obli
gates that our sons be sent to tight in
foreign lands. Yet the very intent and
structure of the League is to prevent
war. There is no obligation for the

United States to engage in military op
erations or to allow any interference
with our internal affairs without the full
consent of our representatives in the
League. If there is any danger that we
should be charged with an obligation to
go to war, either direct or implied, with
out the full consent and approval of
Congress, I believe the President will be
the first to agree to any interpretation
that this cannot be. The French govern
ment so far takes this view that it has
requested from us a separate military
guaranty for themselves.
The League is founded expressly in
the attempt to secure the pacific settle
ment of these questions without military
force. To me, every line of it is the
complete negation of militarism. Dur
ing the course of negotiations in Paris
one fact stood out with regard to the
League. Its opposition there arose en
tirely from the old militaristic regimes,
and from the reactionaries of the world
in general. They saw in it trulv the
undermining of militarism. They had
the vision to see. and even to openly
state, that it would mean the ultimate
abandonment of military force in the
world, for thev. as of old, contend that
without military exercise there is no hope
of the maintenance of human efficiency
or control of the masses. What they
foresaw has already happened in a great
military nation like the British, where
the population, broken under a load of
taxation, is responding quickly to the new
possibility of international safety with
out the burden of gigantic naval arma
ment. The reactionaries saw that under

of Nations there would be a growing op
position to the burden of armament from
all those who labor with hand and mind.

and an enormous portion of our wealth,
hoping to see these ends. For us to re
fuse to enter into a joint attempt with
the well-thinking sections of a large
part of the world to establish a contin
uing moral conscience against war is the
utmost folly in our own interest.
We have been the center and inspira
tion of democracy for a hundred years.
We have given sympathy and encour
agement to every aspiration for self-gov
ernment for all this time. We have from
our experience in its blessings believed
it made for peace and well-being. We
enjoy from it the highest standard of
living in the world. We went to Eu
rope with our best blood and our treas
ures and fought the attempt to impose
autocracy on the world. We won. We
imposed democracy all over Europe. We
set up a score of new democracies—and
they are many of them peoples of our
own blood—the Baltic, Polish, and Slav
races. Arc we to refuse our counsels to
these peoples now struggling to realize
our own ideals? Curious as it may seem,
this also embraces Germany itself. That
sincerely democratic group which to-day
controls Germany is losing ground lie

to fan the renewed hope of domination.
I am one of those who hold that this
war would never have happened if the
nations of Europe had accepted the invi
tation of Sir Edward Gray to a confer

that if the intelligence of the world can
be aggregated around a table, the pres
sures from the responsibility of these
men for the possible enormous loss of

life and the fabulous amount of human
misery created by their failure to pre
vent war, are such that no body of de
cent men in these times can fail to se
cure some sort of solution short of war.
We have now seen the most terrible five
years of history because the reaction
aries of Europe refused to come into a
room to discuss the welfare of humanity.
From this mightv political, social, and
economic upheaval there are a host of
outstanding problems which can Weed
war at any minute. The Liberal world
is asking us to come into a Council to
find the solution for these things. It is
not asking for soldiers, it is asking for
our economic and moral weight, our
idealism, and our disinterested sense of
justice. Are we willing to take the re
sponsibility that now rests on the souls
of those men in Europe wlio refused this
invitation in 1914?
DEIIHAPS the most ti nificant speech
ever delivered in t|e Stanford As
sembly Hall by any speaker, was that
of Herbert Hoover, '95, yesterday aft
ernoon. No man has been more looked
to by a greater number of people dur
ing the world war, than Mr. Hoover,
and on this account, his words spoken
yesterday concerning the future peace
of the world will 1 e barkened to Ly
all nations. Stanford was indeed
honored by Mr. Hoover when he chose
his Alma Mater as the most fitting
place in which to give the firs' public
expressi jn of those views which the
entire world has been waiting to hear.
In light of the stormy debate which
has been going on in the United
States Senate, and the tours made by
President Wilson and Senator John
son, Mr. Hoover made several signi
ficant points. The fact that he ap
proved the debate that has swept the
country because it brought the prob
lems of the League of Nations so
effectively before the people of this
country, came somewhat as a surprise.
"This debate is laying the foundation
to the league," he said.
In reply to the much repeated argu
ment of the Republican leaders, Mr.
Soover stated that he did not believe
tluJl the Un'ted States would evei be
forced into a world war without the
unanimous vote of its own leaders.

In other words the League of Nations
.cannot force any nation into war with
out the consent of that nation.
The complete tevt of Hoover's great
speech follows:
1 have been urged by Mr. Taft and
others to state at some greater length
my views on the peace treaty, and I
take this occasion to present them to
my own townspeople. During the ten
months between the armistice and har
vest I acted as the economic director
for the Supreme War Council. I was
necessarily in intimate contact witli the
political and economic situation all
over Europe. I was not one of the
American Peace delegates, but the pur
pose of my office was to act on behalf
of the United States and the Peace
Conference in an effort to save life and
prevent anarchy while the peace was
negotiated. I therefore had an advan
tageous position to independently ob
serve the growth of ideas in the Con
ference and the re-percussions of these
ideas through Europe.
I am not of those who have an im
patience of honest debate. 1 believe
that the debate of the League of Na
tions going on in the United States is
building tlic very foundations of the
League. It is bringing home to every
household in the country the necessity
and possibility of providing for our own
safety and of providing for the safety
of the world as a whole without great
armies or navies. Nor do I believe in
the criticism of the Senate for not ac
cepting out of hand this document so
laboriously evolved by five hundred con
flicting minds in Paris. It is a funda
mental part of our institutions that the
Senate shall scrutinize these matters.
Consideration and debate by the Senate
is not trahorship.
Nor were those Americans traitors
who. in representing us in Paris, fought
for every inch of hope that the weak
could be protected and the strong
curbed, that the United States could it
self be protected. Tf they were traitors
to their country it was because they were
wrong in assuming that the American
people wished an effort made to destroy
the seeds of war and thus to secure the
growth of liberty.
The treaty finally reached at Paris is
by no means perfect. I see no method
by which it could have been made per
fect when five hundred men, represent
ing twenty-three different nationalities,
were engaged in its negotiations, and
agreement had to be unanimous. Diff
ence in national character and in national
aspirations could but cause much dif
ference in views. Many of them repre
sented desperate, passionate or selfish ob
jects, some were dominated by political
ideals of the last century, yet the most
were actuated by the prayers of the com
mon people, who really fought this war,
that it should be the last war. There ex
isted in the world before this Conference
scores of those major international
wrongs which breed war. Of these the
Peace Conference corrected some, but it
will take perhaps a hundred years for
the men of good will to correct them all.
It is often overlooked that this was not
a conference to settle wrongs committed
by Allies and neutrals, but by the enemy
only. It was German wrongs that were
on the operating table. It would have
been beautiful to have all the interna
tional wrongs on the table, but this is not
a perfect world. As a practical fact, if
this had been attempted, the Conference
would have broken up !n quarrels among
the Allies, and Germany would have been
handed again the domination of Europe.
The old guard in Germany hoped and
expected that this would result; up to
date at least they have been disappointed.
No one could be more disappointed than
the American delegation that some great
wrongs that were the result of the secret
treaties that had been written in times of
complete desperation amongst the origi
nal allies were not eradicated at the Con
ference. In this the American group
were a minority of one, endeavoring to
secure that right should be done, in a
meeting that required unanimous agree
ment. There are many other items in

the treaty which men of good will would
have liked to see different. Our dele
gation could have found cause to with
draw from the Conference on many
scores. We would have been withdraw
ing in the face of the enemy, and Ger
many, by this division of the Allies,
would have been victorious.
Greater things were accomplished by
this Conference than by any other in
history. The military oligarchys of Ger
many, Austria, and Turkey were dis
solved, and if peace is ratified in time
they will be disarmed, and thus a para
mount menace to us and the world will
be destroyed. The Poles, the Czechs,
the Finns, the Croats, and the Slovenes
and Slovacks, the Baltic States, Arme
nians, Arabs have, or will, subject to
ratification, secure their liberty. Par
cels of French, Italians, Roumanians,
Serbians, Greeks have been rejoined to
their mother countries. Representative
democratic governments were set up on
the liberated and enemy states. Meth
ods were devised by which these people
would be free from economic domina
tion and by which the Germans and
their allies would be made to pay some
thing on account of the terrible destruc
tion they have wrought as a lesson to
militarism.
The men of liberal vision at the Con
ference were steadfast for certain domi
nant ideals that mark this conference
apait from all others. First, that this
settlement should remove as many of the
immediate causes of war as possible by
destroying enemy domination over other
races. Second, by establishing the new
governments on a democratic basis so
that wars should not be made by auto
that wars should not be made by autoc
racies for the profit of their class.
Third, that there should be established a
world council—the League. Here these
newly liberated peoples could lind some
measure of protection from invasion.
Here, with the stimulation of the world
conscience awakened by this war, there
could be no hope that the wrongs among
other peoples could be brought for dis
cussion and negotiation. Here, if ag
gression were undertaken, the public
opinion of the world could be enlight
ened and the aggressor could be made
an outcast from the society of the civ
ilized nations. Thus only could some
thing constructive be done to end war.
This is an aspiration which has been
rising in the hearts of all the world.
It has become an insistence in the
minds of all those in the world to

whom the lives of our sons are precious,
to all those to whom civilization is a
tiling to be safeguarded, and all those
who see no hope for the amelioration
of the misery of those who toil if peace
cannot be maintained.
Jo form a League of Nations for this
purpose has been proposed by the leaders
of both our great parties time and
again. It has been proposed by lead
ing spirits in all civilized nations. It
belongs to no one man, it comes from
the heart and mind of the world.
1 haye always regarded it a mistake
that this was termed "League," for the
term smacks of military alliance. It
is, in fact, a council of nations that re
quires in all important matters unani
mous decision.
'1 he major provisions of this council
look toward disarmament and provision
of place ind time, for negotiation and
arbitration of quarrels. Its most potent
weapon is the determination of rights
and wrongs of international quarrels
and the enlightenment of the world
upon them and thus the moral isolation
of the aggressor. If this fails, its sec
ond weapon is the boycott, the most
potent force in the world to-day—the
force that more than any other brought
Germany to her knees. It agrees that
military force can be used in defense
against invasion of one country by an
other, but in this, as in other important
things, unanimous consent is required,
and consent must mean the United
States Congress on our side. From my
own experience, 1 believe that the dis
cussion, negotiation, arbitration, enlight
enment of public opinion and thus the
moral definition of an outcast will be
all-sufficient, coupled with the knowl
edge that other wcapous exist. The hope
that I, as an independent observer, have
placed in the League was that it would
forever relieve the United States of the
necessity to again send a single soldier
outside of our boundaries.
The opponents of the League are of
many conflicting minds. There are those
who truly wish this experiment in the
promotion and preservation of human
liberty to be tried; tTTey, however, wish
the details altered and have fears that
the details agreed upon may themselves
involve us in war. Others believe that
the interest of the United States lies in
keeping out of all international action.
Others believe that the old game of arms
is the best promoter of civilization; still
others oppose it from disappointment
that all the ills of the world were not

corrected at this one session of the na
tion. But few of tliem acknowledge that
this terrible upheaval and its aftermath
of conflicting economic, social, and politi
cal forces lias endangered the stability
of the world for years to come.
Those who formulated the League did
not expect that it would furnish an over
night solution to all uncorrected inter
national wrongs or the disruption of
the.se unloosened forces. They did ex
pect that by degrees ttiere would be a
definite alignment of opinion in the
world that would make these wrongs
less and that could in great measure
restrain the actual outbreaks of war, that
could give the world time to heal its
wounds. Even the Sermon on the
Mount did not wholly regenerate the
world.
We-hear the cry that the League obli
gates that our sons be sent to tight in
foreign lands. Yet the very intent and
structure of the League is to prevent
war. There is no obligation for the

United States to engage in military op
erations or to allow any interference
with our internal affairs without the full
consent of our representatives in the
League. If there is any danger that we
should be charged with an obligation to
go to war, either direct or implied, with
out the full consent and approval of
Congress, I believe the President will be
the first to agree to any interpretation
that this cannot be. The French govern
ment so far takes this view that it has
requested from us a separate military
guaranty for themselves.
The League is founded expressly in
the attempt to secure the pacific settle
ment of these questions without military
force. To me, every line of it is the
complete negation of militarism. Dur
ing the course of negotiations in Paris
one fact stood out with regard to the
League. Its opposition there arose en
tirely from the old militaristic regimes,
and from the reactionaries of the world
in general. They saw in it trulv the
undermining of militarism. They had
the vision to see. and even to openly
state, that it would mean the ultimate
abandonment of military force in the
world, for thev. as of old, contend that
without military exercise there is no hope
of the maintenance of human efficiency
or control of the masses. What they
foresaw has already happened in a great
military nation like the British, where
the population, broken under a load of
taxation, is responding quickly to the new
possibility of international safety with
out the burden of gigantic naval arma
ment. The reactionaries saw that under
the hope for the protection of the League
of Nations there would be a growing op
position to the burden of armament from
all those who labor with hand and mind.
It is the workers of the world who
pay the price of war, not alone in the
support of arms but in blood and in the
support to tyranny which armies mean in
peace.
All wars have hitherto been settled on
the basis of trying to create a balance of
military strength by intriguing peoples j
into various groups oT equal military j
weight—the balance of power. Tt would
have been impossible to give liberty to j
the score of new nations of militarily I
weak yet liberty-loving people without!
the League to safeguard them from in
vasion. Beyond this, every attempt to
set up this balance hitherto has ultimately
crashed in war, for its essence is militar
ism. The creation of the League brought I
new hopes into the peace, and if the
League fails these new liberated nations
must fall, for the world must readjust
itself into the balance of power, and great
wars will re-open at once in this re
alignment. In a recent visit to many of
the capitals of the new states, the first
anxious question of their officials was,
"Will America ratify the League?" Their
invariable answer was that without it
their only course was the hopeless effort
to arm themselves against stronger neigh
bors; to do it in the midst of misery;
to endeavor to set up groups and military
alliances with all the old treadmill of
oppression of arms and ultimate war.
There are many elements in Europe
who wish to see the treaty break down
and the League of Nations disappear.
For instance, during the last five months
our Allies have been growing weaker
from a military point of view, due to the
necessity of demobilizing their armies,
while at the same time the reactionary
group in Germany has been growing in
strength through the recreation of hopes
of yet securing a division of the Allies.
At the time I left Europe a month ago,
German militarism had already re-estab
lished itself as a well-disciplined, well
officered army of at least 400,000 men,
largely congregated on the Polish fron
tier and even defying the government at
Berlin. Under the alarm of this danger,
the Poles, in the midst of the greatest
economic misery that a nation ever knew,
have been trying to create an army of
500,000 men for their protection from the
Germans on one side and the Bolsheviks
on the other. If the treaty is ratified the
German army will be reduced to 200,000
men and dispersed over Germany, and
their extra armament destroyed. The
failure of the treaty means the invasion
of the Polish state. This is only one of
the powder magazines in Europe which
cannot be destroyed *mtil this treaty is
ratified, and during every day of delay
more explosives are poured into them.
For good or ill, the entire treaty was
constructed around this central theme of
a League of Nations to prevent war. A
score of provisions in tTie treaty and out
side the covenant necessitate its erec
tion. To avoid causes of war, the
League has been made the trustee to
secure outlets to the sea, to secure free
ports to inland peoples, to settle deferred
disputes which could not otherwise hope
for solution without dangerous friction.
The treaties themselves cannot be car
ried out without the League. If the
League falls the treaties also fall.
The boundaries of these new states
cannot precisely include all their own
nationals, for the borders are lined with
racial islands and friction. Peace and
a moderating council are required for
readjustments. Their outlets to sea by
rail, canal, and viver are through other
states; their whole political and economic
situation demands peace for the growth
of order and the prevention of anarchy.
If the balance of power has to supplant
the League of Nations we will have
torn asunder the only hope that Europe
will not break into further wars of races,
classes, and groups that will take her
civilization back to the Middle Ages. I
am convinced that if we attempt now
to revise the treaty we shall tread a road
through European chaos. Even if we
managed to keep our soldiers out of it
we will not scape fearful economic
losses.
If the League is to break down we
must at once prepare to fight. Few
people seem to realize the desperation to
which Europe has been reduced. During
the coming winter son.c of them will look
with longing eyes on this rich, fat na
tion, possessing great surpluses of every
human necessity, wh/fe they endure in
evitable hunger and cold. At the same
time the energy of our population is sup
planting them in places where their mer
chants expect to market their goods and
operate their ships. Others of them will
he plunged into war with their neighbors,
and we have already experienced the diffi
culty of maintaining neutrality with self
respect and safety. We cannot fiddle
while Rome burns.
The Allies may themselves ratify this
treaty without us, and thus assemble a
Council of Nations of their own in an
endeavor to solve the problem of Europe.
It would be a Council of Europe, and in
the midst of these terrible times, with the
debts they owe to us, the material they
must have from us or starve, I would
rather be represented therein lest it be
come a League of Europe against the
Western Hemisphere. A peace without
us means more army and navy for us,
with the old treadmill of taxes and
dangers.
It is true we are not loved by certain
classes of people, some of them among
our former allies. It is untrue, however,
to say that the masses of any nation now
hate us. It is still more untrue to say
that the newly liberated peoples look to
us with other than conviction that our
moral leadership is their only hope. We
are not loved by any military class,
whether in the allied or enemy countries.
()ur whole object has been to destroy
their calling, to undermine their class.
! lie great masses of burdened working
people, however, look for us to support
this one hope of relief from domination
from burdens and misery of arms and
war.
Neither the gospel of hate nor the
gospel of unpreparedness are the roads
to peace. The true road lies in every
effort to remove the causes of war, not
in tearing down such structure of peace
as we have, nor in blindness to present
dangers.
Those who think we can isolate our
selves seem to ignore the fact that mod
ern communication has shortened our
distance from our neighbors from a
month to an hour. A vast amount of
our civilization and the daily improve
ments of life that come to our people
are the products of the ideas and in
telligence and labor of our neighbors.
If we believe we can see our neighbors
return to thirty years' war through the
breakdown of this treaty and we still
maintain our progress, it is the egotism
of insanity. We arc an overseas people,
and we are dependent upon Europe for
marks for the surplus products of our
farmers and laborers. Without order in
Europe we will at best have business de
pression, unemployment, and all their
burden of troubles. With renewed dis
organization in Europe, social diseases
and anarchy thrive, and we are infected
with every social wind of Europe. We
are forced to interest ourselves in the
welfare of the world if we are to thrive.
There is no American who has spent the
last ten months in Europe who does not
pray that we should g*r out of entangle
ment in the sordid selfishness, the pas
sions, the misery of it. But our expan
sion overseas has entangled us for good
or ill, and I stand for an honest attempt
to join with Europe's better spirit to
prevent these entanglements from in
volving us in war. We are not dealing
with perfection; we are dealing with
the lesser of evils. These are reasons
of interest.
There are also reasons of idealism,
and true national interest lies along the
path of practical ideals, and there are
ideals in Europe. During the last hun
dred and fifty years a far larger pro
portion of our citizens liave grown far
ahead of those of Europe in outlook on
life, in disinterested sense of justice, in
sympathy with the downtrodden. It
was with the hope of ending war that
we went into it, and to fix it in inter
national law that dominated our repre
sentatives in the Peace Conference. We
have expended the lives of our sons
and an enormous portion of our wealth,
hoping to see these ends. For us to re
fuse to enter into a joint attempt with
the well-thinking sections of a large
part of the world to establish a contin
uing moral conscience against war is the
utmost folly in our own interest.
We have been the center and inspira
tion of democracy for a hundred years.
We have given sympathy and encour
agement to every aspiration for self-gov
ernment for all this time. We have from
our experience in its blessings believed
it made for peace and well-being. We
enjoy from it the highest standard of
living in the world. We went to Eu
rope with our best blood and our treas

would be free from economic domina
tion and by which the Germans and
their allies would be made to pay some
thing on account of the terrible destruc
tion they have wrought as a lesson to
militarism.
The men of liberal vision at the Con
ference were steadfast for certain domi
nant ideals that mark this conference
apait from all others. First, that this
settlement should remove as many of the
immediate causes of war as possible by
destroying enemy domination over other
races. Second, by establishing the new
governments on a democratic basis so
that wars should not be made by auto
that wars should not be made by autoc
racies for the profit of their class.
Third, that there should be established a
world council—the League. Here these
newly liberated peoples could lind some
measure of protection from invasion.
Here, with the stimulation of the world
conscience awakened by this war, there
could be no hope that the wrongs among
other peoples could be brought for dis
cussion and negotiation. Here, if ag
gression were undertaken, the public
opinion of the world could be enlight
ened and the aggressor could be made
an outcast from the society of the civ
ilized nations. Thus only could some
thing constructive be done to end war.
This is an aspiration which has been
rising in the hearts of all the world.
It has become an insistence in the
minds of all those in the world to

whom the lives of our sons are precious,
to all those to whom civilization is a
tiling to be safeguarded, and all those
who see no hope for the amelioration
of the misery of those who toil if peace
cannot be maintained.
Jo form a League of Nations for this
purpose has been proposed by the leaders
of both our great parties time and
again. It has been proposed by lead
ing spirits in all civilized nations. It
belongs to no one man, it comes from
the heart and mind of the world.
1 haye always regarded it a mistake
that this was termed "League," for the
term smacks of military alliance. It
is, in fact, a council of nations that re
quires in all important matters unani
mous decision.
'1 he major provisions of this council
look toward disarmament and provision
of place ind time, for negotiation and
arbitration of quarrels. Its most potent
weapon is the determination of rights
and wrongs of international quarrels
and the enlightenment of the world
upon them and thus the moral isolation
of the aggressor. If this fails, its sec
ond weapon is the boycott, the most
potent force in the world to-day—the
force that more than any other brought
Germany to her knees. It agrees that
military force can be used in defense
against invasion of one country by an
other, but in this, as in other important
things, unanimous consent is required,
and consent must mean the United
States Congress on our side. From my
own experience, 1 believe that the dis
cussion, negotiation, arbitration, enlight
enment of public opinion and thus the
moral definition of an outcast will be
all-sufficient, coupled with the knowl
edge that other wcapous exist. The hope
that I, as an independent observer, have
placed in the League was that it would
forever relieve the United States of the
necessity to again send a single soldier
outside of our boundaries.
The opponents of the League are of
many conflicting minds. There are those
who truly wish this experiment in the
promotion and preservation of human
liberty to be tried; tTTey, however, wish
the details altered and have fears that
the details agreed upon may themselves
involve us in war. Others believe that
the interest of the United States lies in
keeping out of all international action.
Others believe that the old game of arms
is the best promoter of civilization; still
others oppose it from disappointment
that all the ills of the world were not

corrected at this one session of the na
tion. But few of tliem acknowledge that
this terrible upheaval and its aftermath
of conflicting economic, social, and politi
cal forces lias endangered the stability
of the world for years to come.
Those who formulated the League did
not expect that it would furnish an over
night solution to all uncorrected inter
national wrongs or the disruption of
the.se unloosened forces. They did ex
pect that by degrees ttiere would be a
definite alignment of opinion in the
world that would make these wrongs
less and that could in great measure
restrain the actual outbreaks of war, that
could give the world time to heal its
wounds. Even the Sermon on the
Mount did not wholly regenerate the
world.
We-hear the cry that the League obli
gates that our sons be sent to tight in
foreign lands. Yet the very intent and
structure of the League is to prevent
war. There is no obligation for the

United States to engage in military op
erations or to allow any interference
with our internal affairs without the full
consent of our representatives in the
League. If there is any danger that we
should be charged with an obligation to
go to war, either direct or implied, with
out the full consent and approval of
Congress, I believe the President will be
the first to agree to any interpretation
that this cannot be. The French govern
ment so far takes this view that it has
requested from us a separate military
guaranty for themselves.
The League is founded expressly in
the attempt to secure the pacific settle
ment of these questions without military
force. To me, every line of it is the
complete negation of militarism. Dur
ing the course of negotiations in Paris
one fact stood out with regard to the
League. Its opposition there arose en
tirely from the old militaristic regimes,
and from the reactionaries of the world
in general. They saw in it trulv the
undermining of militarism. They had
the vision to see. and even to openly
state, that it would mean the ultimate
abandonment of military force in the
world, for thev. as of old, contend that
without military exercise there is no hope
of the maintenance of human efficiency
or control of the masses. What they
foresaw has already happened in a great
military nation like the British, where
the population, broken under a load of
taxation, is responding quickly to the new
possibility of international safety with
out the burden of gigantic naval arma
ment. The reactionaries saw that under
the hope for the protection of the League
of Nations there would be a growing op
position to the burden of armament from
all those who labor with hand and mind.
It is the workers of the world who
pay the price of war, not alone in the
support of arms but in blood and in the
support to tyranny which armies mean in
peace.
All wars have hitherto been settled on
the basis of trying to create a balance of
military strength by intriguing peoples j
into various groups oT equal military j
weight—the balance of power. Tt would
have been impossible to give liberty to j
the score of new nations of militarily I
weak yet liberty-loving people without!
the League to safeguard them from in
vasion. Beyond this, every attempt to
set up this balance hitherto has ultimately
crashed in war, for its essence is militar
ism. The creation of the League brought I
new hopes into the peace, and if the
League fails these new liberated nations
must fall, for the world must readjust
itself into the balance of power, and great
wars will re-open at once in this re
alignment. In a recent visit to many of
the capitals of the new states, the first
anxious question of their officials was,
"Will America ratify the League?" Their
invariable answer was that without it
their only course was the hopeless effort
to arm themselves against stronger neigh
bors; to do it in the midst of misery;
to endeavor to set up groups and military
alliances with all the old treadmill of
oppression of arms and ultimate war.
There are many elements in Europe
who wish to see the treaty break down
and the League of Nations disappear.
For instance, during the last five months
our Allies have been growing weaker
from a military point of view, due to the
necessity of demobilizing their armies,
while at the same time the reactionary
group in Germany has been growing in
strength through the recreation of hopes
of yet securing a division of the Allies.
At the time I left Europe a month ago,
German militarism had already re-estab
lished itself as a well-disciplined, well
officered army of at least 400,000 men,
largely congregated on the Polish fron
tier and even defying the government at
Berlin. Under the alarm of this danger,
the Poles, in the midst of the greatest
economic misery that a nation ever knew,
have been trying to create an army of
500,000 men for their protection from the
Germans on one side and the Bolsheviks
on the other. If the treaty is ratified the
German army will be reduced to 200,000
men and dispersed over Germany, and
their extra armament destroyed. The
failure of the treaty means the invasion
of the Polish state. This is only one of
the powder magazines in Europe which
cannot be destroyed *mtil this treaty is
ratified, and during every day of delay
more explosives are poured into them.
For good or ill, the entire treaty was
constructed around this central theme of
a League of Nations to prevent war. A
score of provisions in tTie treaty and out
side the covenant necessitate its erec
tion. To avoid causes of war, the
League has been made the trustee to
secure outlets to the sea, to secure free
ports to inland peoples, to settle deferred
disputes which could not otherwise hope
for solution without dangerous friction.
The treaties themselves cannot be car
ried out without the League. If the
League falls the treaties also fall.
The boundaries of these new states
cannot precisely include all their own
nationals, for the borders are lined with
racial islands and friction. Peace and
a moderating council are required for
readjustments. Their outlets to sea by
rail, canal, and viver are through other
states; their whole political and economic
situation demands peace for the growth
of order and the prevention of anarchy.
If the balance of power has to supplant
the League of Nations we will have
torn asunder the only hope that Europe
will not break into further wars of races,
classes, and groups that will take her
civilization back to the Middle Ages. I
am convinced that if we attempt now
to revise the treaty we shall tread a road
through European chaos. Even if we
managed to keep our soldiers out of it
we will not scape fearful economic
losses.
If the League is to break down we
must at once prepare to fight. Few
people seem to realize the desperation to
which Europe has been reduced. During
the coming winter son.c of them will look
with longing eyes on this rich, fat na
tion, possessing great surpluses of every
human necessity, wh/fe they endure in
evitable hunger and cold. At the same
time the energy of our population is sup
planting them in places where their mer
chants expect to market their goods and
operate their ships. Others of them will
he plunged into war with their neighbors,
and we have already experienced the diffi
culty of maintaining neutrality with self
respect and safety. We cannot fiddle
while Rome burns.
The Allies may themselves ratify this
treaty without us, and thus assemble a
Council of Nations of their own in an
endeavor to solve the problem of Europe.
It would be a Council of Europe, and in
the midst of these terrible times, with the
debts they owe to us, the material they
must have from us or starve, I would
rather be represented therein lest it be
come a League of Europe against the
Western Hemisphere. A peace without
us means more army and navy for us,
with the old treadmill of taxes and
dangers.
It is true we are not loved by certain
classes of people, some of them among
our former allies. It is untrue, however,
to say that the masses of any nation now
hate us. It is still more untrue to say
that the newly liberated peoples look to
us with other than conviction that our
moral leadership is their only hope. We
are not loved by any military class,
whether in the allied or enemy countries.
()ur whole object has been to destroy
their calling, to undermine their class.
! lie great masses of burdened working
people, however, look for us to support
this one hope of relief from domination
from burdens and misery of arms and
war.
Neither the gospel of hate nor the
gospel of unpreparedness are the roads
to peace. The true road lies in every
effort to remove the causes of war, not
in tearing down such structure of peace
as we have, nor in blindness to present
dangers.
Those who think we can isolate our
selves seem to ignore the fact that mod
ern communication has shortened our
distance from our neighbors from a
month to an hour. A vast amount of
our civilization and the daily improve
ments of life that come to our people
are the products of the ideas and in
telligence and labor of our neighbors.
If we believe we can see our neighbors
return to thirty years' war through the
breakdown of this treaty and we still
maintain our progress, it is the egotism
of insanity. We arc an overseas people,
and we are dependent upon Europe for
marks for the surplus products of our
farmers and laborers. Without order in
Europe we will at best have business de
pression, unemployment, and all their
burden of troubles. With renewed dis
organization in Europe, social diseases
and anarchy thrive, and we are infected
with every social wind of Europe. We
are forced to interest ourselves in the
welfare of the world if we are to thrive.
There is no American who has spent the
last ten months in Europe who does not
pray that we should g*r out of entangle
ment in the sordid selfishness, the pas
sions, the misery of it. But our expan
sion overseas has entangled us for good
or ill, and I stand for an honest attempt
to join with Europe's better spirit to
prevent these entanglements from in
volving us in war. We are not dealing
with perfection; we are dealing with
the lesser of evils. These are reasons
of interest.
There are also reasons of idealism,
and true national interest lies along the
path of practical ideals, and there are
ideals in Europe. During the last hun
dred and fifty years a far larger pro
portion of our citizens liave grown far
ahead of those of Europe in outlook on
life, in disinterested sense of justice, in
sympathy with the downtrodden. It
was with the hope of ending war that
we went into it, and to fix it in inter
national law that dominated our repre
sentatives in the Peace Conference. We
have expended the lives of our sons
and an enormous portion of our wealth,
hoping to see these ends. For us to re
fuse to enter into a joint attempt with
the well-thinking sections of a large
part of the world to establish a contin
uing moral conscience against war is the
utmost folly in our own interest.
We have been the center and inspira
tion of democracy for a hundred years.
We have given sympathy and encour
agement to every aspiration for self-gov
ernment for all this time. We have from
our experience in its blessings believed
it made for peace and well-being. We
enjoy from it the highest standard of
living in the world. We went to Eu
rope with our best blood and our treas
ures and fought the attempt to impose
autocracy on the world. We won. We
imposed democracy all over Europe. We
set up a score of new democracies—and
they are many of them peoples of our
own blood—the Baltic, Polish, and Slav
races. Arc we to refuse our counsels to
these peoples now struggling to realize
our own ideals? Curious as it may seem,
this also embraces Germany itself. That
sincerely democratic group which to-day
controls Germany is losing ground lie
fore the old reactionary group who em
ploy tlu- hope of the failure of the league
to fan the renewed hope of domination.
I am one of those who hold that this
war would never have happened if the
nations of Europe had accepted the invi
tation of Sir Edward Gray to a confer
ence of civilians in July, 1914. I believe
that if the intelligence of the world can
be aggregated around a table, the pres
sures from the responsibility of these
men for the possible enormous loss of

life and the fabulous amount of human
misery created by their failure to pre
vent war, are such that no body of de
cent men in these times can fail to se
cure some sort of solution short of war.
We have now seen the most terrible five
years of history because the reaction
aries of Europe refused to come into a
room to discuss the welfare of humanity.
From this mightv political, social, and
economic upheaval there are a host of
outstanding problems which can Weed
war at any minute. The Liberal world
is asking us to come into a Council to
find the solution for these things. It is
not asking for soldiers, it is asking for
our economic and moral weight, our
idealism, and our disinterested sense of
justice. Are we willing to take the re
sponsibility that now rests on the souls
of those men in Europe wlio refused this
invitation in 1914?
DEIIHAPS the most ti nificant speech
ever delivered in t|e Stanford As
sembly Hall by any speaker, was that
of Herbert Hoover, '95, yesterday aft
ernoon. No man has been more looked
to by a greater number of people dur
ing the world war, than Mr. Hoover,
and on this account, his words spoken
yesterday concerning the future peace
of the world will 1 e barkened to Ly
all nations. Stanford was indeed
honored by Mr. Hoover when he chose
his Alma Mater as the most fitting
place in which to give the firs' public
expressi jn of those views which the
entire world has been waiting to hear.
In light of the stormy debate which
has been going on in the United
States Senate, and the tours made by
President Wilson and Senator John
son, Mr. Hoover made several signi
ficant points. The fact that he ap
proved the debate that has swept the
country because it brought the prob
lems of the League of Nations so
effectively before the people of this
country, came somewhat as a surprise.
"This debate is laying the foundation
to the league," he said.
In reply to the much repeated argu
ment of the Republican leaders, Mr.
Soover stated that he did not believe
tluJl the Un'ted States would evei be
forced into a world war without the
unanimous vote of its own leaders.

In other words the League of Nations
.cannot force any nation into war with
out the consent of that nation.
The complete tevt of Hoover's great
speech follows:
1 have been urged by Mr. Taft and
others to state at some greater length
my views on the peace treaty, and I
take this occasion to present them to
my own townspeople. During the ten
months between the armistice and har
vest I acted as the economic director
for the Supreme War Council. I was
necessarily in intimate contact witli the
political and economic situation all
over Europe. I was not one of the
American Peace delegates, but the pur
pose of my office was to act on behalf
of the United States and the Peace
Conference in an effort to save life and
prevent anarchy while the peace was
negotiated. I therefore had an advan
tageous position to independently ob
serve the growth of ideas in the Con
ference and the re-percussions of these
ideas through Europe.
I am not of those who have an im
patience of honest debate. 1 believe
that the debate of the League of Na
tions going on in the United States is
building tlic very foundations of the
League. It is bringing home to every
household in the country the necessity
and possibility of providing for our own
safety and of providing for the safety
of the world as a whole without great
armies or navies. Nor do I believe in
the criticism of the Senate for not ac
cepting out of hand this document so
laboriously evolved by five hundred con
flicting minds in Paris. It is a funda
mental part of our institutions that the
Senate shall scrutinize these matters.
Consideration and debate by the Senate
is not trahorship.
Nor were those Americans traitors
who. in representing us in Paris, fought
for every inch of hope that the weak
could be protected and the strong
curbed, that the United States could it
self be protected. Tf they were traitors
to their country it was because they were
wrong in assuming that the American
people wished an effort made to destroy
the seeds of war and thus to secure the
growth of liberty.
The treaty finally reached at Paris is
by no means perfect. I see no method
by which it could have been made per
fect when five hundred men, represent
ing twenty-three different nationalities,
were engaged in its negotiations, and
agreement had to be unanimous. Diff
ence in national character and in national
aspirations could but cause much dif
ference in views. Many of them repre
sented desperate, passionate or selfish ob
jects, some were dominated by political
ideals of the last century, yet the most
were actuated by the prayers of the com
mon people, who really fought this war,
that it should be the last war. There ex
isted in the world before this Conference
scores of those major international
wrongs which breed war. Of these the
Peace Conference corrected some, but it
will take perhaps a hundred years for
the men of good will to correct them all.
It is often overlooked that this was not
a conference to settle wrongs committed
by Allies and neutrals, but by the enemy
only. It was German wrongs that were
on the operating table. It would have
been beautiful to have all the interna
tional wrongs on the table, but this is not
a perfect world. As a practical fact, if
this had been attempted, the Conference
would have broken up !n quarrels among
the Allies, and Germany would have been
handed again the domination of Europe.
The old guard in Germany hoped and
expected that this would result; up to
date at least they have been disappointed.
No one could be more disappointed than
the American delegation that some great
wrongs that were the result of the secret
treaties that had been written in times of
complete desperation amongst the origi
nal allies were not eradicated at the Con
ference. In this the American group
were a minority of one, endeavoring to
secure that right should be done, in a
meeting that required unanimous agree
ment. There are many other items in

the treaty which men of good will would
have liked to see different. Our dele
gation could have found cause to with
draw from the Conference on many
scores. We would have been withdraw
ing in the face of the enemy, and Ger
many, by this division of the Allies,
would have been victorious.
Greater things were accomplished by
this Conference than by any other in
history. The military oligarchys of Ger
many, Austria, and Turkey were dis
solved, and if peace is ratified in time
they will be disarmed, and thus a para
mount menace to us and the world will
be destroyed. The Poles, the Czechs,
the Finns, the Croats, and the Slovenes
and Slovacks, the Baltic States, Arme
nians, Arabs have, or will, subject to
ratification, secure their liberty. Par
cels of French, Italians, Roumanians,
Serbians, Greeks have been rejoined to
their mother countries. Representative
democratic governments were set up on
the liberated and enemy states. Meth
ods were devised by which these people
would be free from economic domina
tion and by which the Germans and
their allies would be made to pay some
thing on account of the terrible destruc
tion they have wrought as a lesson to
militarism.
The men of liberal vision at the Con
ference were steadfast for certain domi
nant ideals that mark this conference
apait from all others. First, that this
settlement should remove as many of the
immediate causes of war as possible by
destroying enemy domination over other

of the Polish state. This is only one of
the powder magazines in Europe which
cannot be destroyed *mtil this treaty is
ratified, and during every day of delay
more explosives are poured into them.
For good or ill, the entire treaty was
constructed around this central theme of
a League of Nations to prevent war. A
score of provisions in tTie treaty and out
side the covenant necessitate its erec
tion. To avoid causes of war, the
League has been made the trustee to
secure outlets to the sea, to secure free
ports to inland peoples, to settle deferred
disputes which could not otherwise hope
for solution without dangerous friction.
The treaties themselves cannot be car
ried out without the League. If the
League falls the treaties also fall.
The boundaries of these new states
cannot precisely include all their own
nationals, for the borders are lined with
racial islands and friction. Peace and
a moderating council are required for
readjustments. Their outlets to sea by
rail, canal, and viver are through other
states; their whole political and economic
situation demands peace for the growth
of order and the prevention of anarchy.
If the balance of power has to supplant
the League of Nations we will have
torn asunder the only hope that Europe
will not break into further wars of races,
classes, and groups that will take her
civilization back to the Middle Ages. I
am convinced that if we attempt now
to revise the treaty we shall tread a road
through European chaos. Even if we
managed to keep our soldiers out of it
we will not scape fearful economic
losses.
If the League is to break down we
must at once prepare to fight. Few
people seem to realize the desperation to
which Europe has been reduced. During
the coming winter son.c of them will look
with longing eyes on this rich, fat na
tion, possessing great surpluses of every
human necessity, wh/fe they endure in
evitable hunger and cold. At the same
time the energy of our population is sup
planting them in places where their mer
chants expect to market their goods and
operate their ships. Others of them will
he plunged into war with their neighbors,
and we have already experienced the diffi
culty of maintaining neutrality with self
respect and safety. We cannot fiddle
while Rome burns.
The Allies may themselves ratify this
treaty without us, and thus assemble a
Council of Nations of their own in an
endeavor to solve the problem of Europe.
It would be a Council of Europe, and in
the midst of these terrible times, with the
debts they owe to us, the material they
must have from us or starve, I would
rather be represented therein lest it be
come a League of Europe against the
Western Hemisphere. A peace without
us means more army and navy for us,
with the old treadmill of taxes and
dangers.
It is true we are not loved by certain
classes of people, some of them among
our former allies. It is untrue, however,
to say that the masses of any nation now
hate us. It is still more untrue to say
that the newly liberated peoples look to
us with other than conviction that our
moral leadership is their only hope. We
are not loved by any military class,
whether in the allied or enemy countries.
()ur whole object has been to destroy
their calling, to undermine their class.
! lie great masses of burdened working
people, however, look for us to support
this one hope of relief from domination
from burdens and misery of arms and
war.
Neither the gospel of hate nor the
gospel of unpreparedness are the roads
to peace. The true road lies in every
effort to remove the causes of war, not
in tearing down such structure of peace
as we have, nor in blindness to present
dangers.
Those who think we can isolate our
selves seem to ignore the fact that mod
ern communication has shortened our
distance from our neighbors from a
month to an hour. A vast amount of
our civilization and the daily improve
ments of life that come to our people
are the products of the ideas and in
telligence and labor of our neighbors.
If we believe we can see our neighbors
return to thirty years' war through the
breakdown of this treaty and we still
maintain our progress, it is the egotism
of insanity. We arc an overseas people,
and we are dependent upon Europe for
marks for the surplus products of our
farmers and laborers. Without order in
Europe we will at best have business de
pression, unemployment, and all their
burden of troubles. With renewed dis
organization in Europe, social diseases
and anarchy thrive, and we are infected
with every social wind of Europe. We
are forced to interest ourselves in the
welfare of the world if we are to thrive.
There is no American who has spent the
last ten months in Europe who does not
pray that we should g*r out of entangle
ment in the sordid selfishness, the pas
sions, the misery of it. But our expan
sion overseas has entangled us for good
or ill, and I stand for an honest attempt
to join with Europe's better spirit to
prevent these entanglements from in
volving us in war. We are not dealing
with perfection; we are dealing with
the lesser of evils. These are reasons
of interest.
There are also reasons of idealism,
and true national interest lies along the
path of practical ideals, and there are
ideals in Europe. During the last hun
dred and fifty years a far larger pro
portion of our citizens liave grown far
ahead of those of Europe in outlook on
life, in disinterested sense of justice, in
sympathy with the downtrodden. It
was with the hope of ending war that
we went into it, and to fix it in inter
national law that dominated our repre
sentatives in the Peace Conference. We
have expended the lives of our sons
and an enormous portion of our wealth,
hoping to see these ends. For us to re
fuse to enter into a joint attempt with
the well-thinking sections of a large
part of the world to establish a contin
uing moral conscience against war is the
utmost folly in our own interest.
We have been the center and inspira
tion of democracy for a hundred years.
We have given sympathy and encour
agement to every aspiration for self-gov
ernment for all this time. We have from
our experience in its blessings believed
it made for peace and well-being. We
enjoy from it the highest standard of
living in the world. We went to Eu
rope with our best blood and our treas
ures and fought the attempt to impose
autocracy on the world. We won. We
imposed democracy all over Europe. We
set up a score of new democracies—and
they are many of them peoples of our
own blood—the Baltic, Polish, and Slav
races. Arc we to refuse our counsels to
these peoples now struggling to realize
our own ideals? Curious as it may seem,
this also embraces Germany itself. That
sincerely democratic group which to-day
controls Germany is losing ground lie
fore the old reactionary group who em
ploy tlu- hope of the failure of the league
to fan the renewed hope of domination.
I am one of those who hold that this
war would never have happened if the
nations of Europe had accepted the invi
tation of Sir Edward Gray to a confer
ence of civilians in July, 1914. I believe
that if the intelligence of the world can
be aggregated around a table, the pres
sures from the responsibility of these
men for the possible enormous loss of

life and the fabulous amount of human
misery created by their failure to pre
vent war, are such that no body of de
cent men in these times can fail to se
cure some sort of solution short of war.
We have now seen the most terrible five
years of history because the reaction
aries of Europe refused to come into a
room to discuss the welfare of humanity.
From this mightv political, social, and
economic upheaval there are a host of
outstanding problems which can Weed
war at any minute. The Liberal world
is asking us to come into a Council to
find the solution for these things. It is
not asking for soldiers, it is asking for
our economic and moral weight, our
idealism, and our disinterested sense of
justice. Are we willing to take the re
sponsibility that now rests on the souls
of those men in Europe wlio refused this
invitation in 1914?
DEIIHAPS the most ti nificant speech
ever delivered in t|e Stanford As
sembly Hall by any speaker, was that
of Herbert Hoover, '95, yesterday aft
ernoon. No man has been more looked
to by a greater number of people dur
ing the world war, than Mr. Hoover,
and on this account, his words spoken
yesterday concerning the future peace
of the world will 1 e barkened to Ly
all nations. Stanford was indeed
honored by Mr. Hoover when he chose
his Alma Mater as the most fitting
place in which to give the firs' public
expressi jn of those views which the
entire world has been waiting to hear.
In light of the stormy debate which
has been going on in the United
States Senate, and the tours made by
President Wilson and Senator John
son, Mr. Hoover made several signi
ficant points. The fact that he ap
proved the debate that has swept the
country because it brought the prob
lems of the League of Nations so
effectively before the people of this
country, came somewhat as a surprise.
"This debate is laying the foundation
to the league," he said.
In reply to the much repeated argu
ment of the Republican leaders, Mr.
Soover stated that he did not believe
tluJl the Un'ted States would evei be
forced into a world war without the
unanimous vote of its own leaders.

In other words the League of Nations
.cannot force any nation into war with
out the consent of that nation.
The complete tevt of Hoover's great
speech follows:
1 have been urged by Mr. Taft and
others to state at some greater length
my views on the peace treaty, and I
take this occasion to present them to
my own townspeople. During the ten
months between the armistice and har
vest I acted as the economic director
for the Supreme War Council. I was
necessarily in intimate contact witli the
political and economic situation all
over Europe. I was not one of the
American Peace delegates, but the pur
pose of my office was to act on behalf
of the United States and the Peace
Conference in an effort to save life and
prevent anarchy while the peace was
negotiated. I therefore had an advan
tageous position to independently ob
serve the growth of ideas in the Con
ference and the re-percussions of these
ideas through Europe.
I am not of those who have an im
patience of honest debate. 1 believe
that the debate of the League of Na
tions going on in the United States is
building tlic very foundations of the
League. It is bringing home to every
household in the country the necessity
and possibility of providing for our own
safety and of providing for the safety
of the world as a whole without great
armies or navies. Nor do I believe in
the criticism of the Senate for not ac
cepting out of hand this document so
laboriously evolved by five hundred con
flicting minds in Paris. It is a funda
mental part of our institutions that the
Senate shall scrutinize these matters.
Consideration and debate by the Senate
is not trahorship.
Nor were those Americans traitors
who. in representing us in Paris, fought
for every inch of hope that the weak
could be protected and the strong
curbed, that the United States could it
self be protected. Tf they were traitors
to their country it was because they were
wrong in assuming that the American
people wished an effort made to destroy
the seeds of war and thus to secure the
growth of liberty.
The treaty finally reached at Paris is
by no means perfect. I see no method
by which it could have been made per
fect when five hundred men, represent
ing twenty-three different nationalities,
were engaged in its negotiations, and
agreement had to be unanimous. Diff
ence in national character and in national
aspirations could but cause much dif
ference in views. Many of them repre
sented desperate, passionate or selfish ob
jects, some were dominated by political
ideals of the last century, yet the most
were actuated by the prayers of the com
mon people, who really fought this war,
that it should be the last war. There ex
isted in the world before this Conference
scores of those major international
wrongs which breed war. Of these the
Peace Conference corrected some, but it
will take perhaps a hundred years for
the men of good will to correct them all.
It is often overlooked that this was not
a conference to settle wrongs committed
by Allies and neutrals, but by the enemy
only. It was German wrongs that were
on the operating table. It would have
been beautiful to have all the interna
tional wrongs on the table, but this is not
a perfect world. As a practical fact, if
this had been attempted, the Conference
would have broken up !n quarrels among
the Allies, and Germany would have been
handed again the domination of Europe.
The old guard in Germany hoped and
expected that this would result; up to
date at least they have been disappointed.
No one could be more disappointed than
the American delegation that some great
wrongs that were the result of the secret
treaties that had been written in times of
complete desperation amongst the origi
nal allies were not eradicated at the Con
ference. In this the American group
were a minority of one, endeavoring to
secure that right should be done, in a
meeting that required unanimous agree
ment. There are many other items in

the treaty which men of good will would
have liked to see different. Our dele
gation could have found cause to with
draw from the Conference on many
scores. We would have been withdraw
ing in the face of the enemy, and Ger
many, by this division of the Allies,
would have been victorious.
Greater things were accomplished by
this Conference than by any other in
history. The military oligarchys of Ger
many, Austria, and Turkey were dis
solved, and if peace is ratified in time
they will be disarmed, and thus a para
mount menace to us and the world will
be destroyed. The Poles, the Czechs,
the Finns, the Croats, and the Slovenes
and Slovacks, the Baltic States, Arme
nians, Arabs have, or will, subject to
ratification, secure their liberty. Par
cels of French, Italians, Roumanians,
Serbians, Greeks have been rejoined to
their mother countries. Representative
democratic governments were set up on
the liberated and enemy states. Meth
ods were devised by which these people
would be free from economic domina
tion and by which the Germans and
their allies would be made to pay some
thing on account of the terrible destruc
tion they have wrought as a lesson to
militarism.
The men of liberal vision at the Con
ference were steadfast for certain domi
nant ideals that mark this conference
apait from all others. First, that this
settlement should remove as many of the
immediate causes of war as possible by
destroying enemy domination over other
races. Second, by establishing the new
governments on a democratic basis so
that wars should not be made by auto
that wars should not be made by autoc
racies for the profit of their class.
Third, that there should be established a
world council—the League. Here these
newly liberated peoples could lind some
measure of protection from invasion.
Here, with the stimulation of the world
conscience awakened by this war, there
could be no hope that the wrongs among
other peoples could be brought for dis
cussion and negotiation. Here, if ag
gression were undertaken, the public
opinion of the world could be enlight
ened and the aggressor could be made
an outcast from the society of the civ
ilized nations. Thus only could some
thing constructive be done to end war.
This is an aspiration which has been
rising in the hearts of all the world.
It has become an insistence in the
minds of all those in the world to

whom the lives of our sons are precious,
to all those to whom civilization is a
tiling to be safeguarded, and all those
who see no hope for the amelioration
of the misery of those who toil if peace
cannot be maintained.
Jo form a League of Nations for this
purpose has been proposed by the leaders
of both our great parties time and
again. It has been proposed by lead
ing spirits in all civilized nations. It
belongs to no one man, it comes from
the heart and mind of the world.
1 haye always regarded it a mistake
that this was termed "League," for the
term smacks of military alliance. It
is, in fact, a council of nations that re
quires in all important matters unani
mous decision.
'1 he major provisions of this council
look toward disarmament and provision
of place ind time, for negotiation and
arbitration of quarrels. Its most potent
weapon is the determination of rights
and wrongs of international quarrels
and the enlightenment of the world
upon them and thus the moral isolation
of the aggressor. If this fails, its sec
ond weapon is the boycott, the most
potent force in the world to-day—the
force that more than any other brought
Germany to her knees. It agrees that
military force can be used in defense
against invasion of one country by an
other, but in this, as in other important
things, unanimous consent is required,
and consent must mean the United
States Congress on our side. From my
own experience, 1 believe that the dis
cussion, negotiation, arbitration, enlight
enment of public opinion and thus the
moral definition of an outcast will be
all-sufficient, coupled with the knowl
edge that other wcapous exist. The hope
that I, as an independent observer, have
placed in the League was that it would
forever relieve the United States of the
necessity to again send a single soldier
outside of our boundaries.
The opponents of the League are of
many conflicting minds. There are those
who truly wish this experiment in the
promotion and preservation of human
liberty to be tried; tTTey, however, wish
the details altered and have fears that
the details agreed upon may themselves
involve us in war. Others believe that
the interest of the United States lies in
keeping out of all international action.
Others believe that the old game of arms
is the best promoter of civilization; still
others oppose it from disappointment
that all the ills of the world were not

corrected at this one session of the na
tion. But few of tliem acknowledge that
this terrible upheaval and its aftermath
of conflicting economic, social, and politi
cal forces lias endangered the stability
of the world for years to come.
Those who formulated the League did
not expect that it would furnish an over
night solution to all uncorrected inter
national wrongs or the disruption of
the.se unloosened forces. They did ex
pect that by degrees ttiere would be a
definite alignment of opinion in the
world that would make these wrongs
less and that could in great measure
restrain the actual outbreaks of war, that
could give the world time to heal its
wounds. Even the Sermon on the
Mount did not wholly regenerate the
world.
We-hear the cry that the League obli
gates that our sons be sent to tight in
foreign lands. Yet the very intent and
structure of the League is to prevent
war. There is no obligation for the

United States to engage in military op
erations or to allow any interference
with our internal affairs without the full
consent of our representatives in the
League. If there is any danger that we
should be charged with an obligation to
go to war, either direct or implied, with
out the full consent and approval of
Congress, I believe the President will be
the first to agree to any interpretation
that this cannot be. The French govern
ment so far takes this view that it has
requested from us a separate military
guaranty for themselves.
The League is founded expressly in
the attempt to secure the pacific settle
ment of these questions without military
force. To me, every line of it is the
complete negation of militarism. Dur
ing the course of negotiations in Paris
one fact stood out with regard to the
League. Its opposition there arose en
tirely from the old militaristic regimes,
and from the reactionaries of the world
in general. They saw in it trulv the
undermining of militarism. They had
the vision to see. and even to openly
state, that it would mean the ultimate
abandonment of military force in the
world, for thev. as of old, contend that
without military exercise there is no hope
of the maintenance of human efficiency
or control of the masses. What they
foresaw has already happened in a great
military nation like the British, where
the population, broken under a load of
taxation, is responding quickly to the new
possibility of international safety with
out the burden of gigantic naval arma
ment. The reactionaries saw that under
the hope for the protection of the League
of Nations there would be a growing op
position to the burden of armament from
all those who labor with hand and mind.
It is the workers of the world who
pay the price of war, not alone in the
support of arms but in blood and in the
support to tyranny which armies mean in
peace.
All wars have hitherto been settled on
the basis of trying to create a balance of
military strength by intriguing peoples j
into various groups oT equal military j
weight—the balance of power. Tt would
have been impossible to give liberty to j
the score of new nations of militarily I
weak yet liberty-loving people without!
the League to safeguard them from in
vasion. Beyond this, every attempt to
set up this balance hitherto has ultimately
crashed in war, for its essence is militar
ism. The creation of the League brought I
new hopes into the peace, and if the
League fails these new liberated nations
must fall, for the world must readjust
itself into the balance of power, and great
wars will re-open at once in this re
alignment. In a recent visit to many of
the capitals of the new states, the first
anxious question of their officials was,
"Will America ratify the League?" Their
invariable answer was that without it
their only course was the hopeless effort
to arm themselves against stronger neigh
bors; to do it in the midst of misery;
to endeavor to set up groups and military
alliances with all the old treadmill of
oppression of arms and ultimate war.
There are many elements in Europe
who wish to see the treaty break down
and the League of Nations disappear.
For instance, during the last five months
our Allies have been growing weaker
from a military point of view, due to the
necessity of demobilizing their armies,
while at the same time the reactionary
group in Germany has been growing in
strength through the recreation of hopes
of yet securing a division of the Allies.
At the time I left Europe a month ago,
German militarism had already re-estab
lished itself as a well-disciplined, well
officered army of at least 400,000 men,
largely congregated on the Polish fron
tier and even defying the government at
Berlin. Under the alarm of this danger,
the Poles, in the midst of the greatest
economic misery that a nation ever knew,
have been trying to create an army of
500,000 men for their protection from the
Germans on one side and the Bolsheviks
on the other. If the treaty is ratified the
German army will be reduced to 200,000
men and dispersed over Germany, and
their extra armament destroyed. The
failure of the treaty means the invasion
of the Polish state. This is only one of
the powder magazines in Europe which
cannot be destroyed *mtil this treaty is
ratified, and during every day of delay
more explosives are poured into them.
For good or ill, the entire treaty was
constructed around this central theme of
a League of Nations to prevent war. A
score of provisions in tTie treaty and out
side the covenant necessitate its erec
tion. To avoid causes of war, the
League has been made the trustee to

ports to inland peoples, to settle deferred
disputes which could not otherwise hope

The treaties themselves cannot be car

League falls the treaties also fall.
The boundaries of these new states
cannot precisely include all their own

racial islands and friction. Peace and
a moderating council are required for
readjustments. Their outlets to sea by
rail, canal, and viver are through other
states; their whole political and economic
situation demands peace for the growth
of order and the prevention of anarchy.
If the balance of power has to supplant
the League of Nations we will have
torn asunder the only hope that Europe
will not break into further wars of races,
classes, and groups that will take her
civilization back to the Middle Ages. I
am convinced that if we attempt now
to revise the treaty we shall tread a road
through European chaos. Even if we
managed to keep our soldiers out of it
we will not scape fearful economic
losses.
If the League is to break down we
must at once prepare to fight. Few

has been going on in the United
States Senate, and the tours made by
President Wilson and Senator John
son, Mr. Hoover made several signi
ficant points. The fact that he ap
proved the debate that has swept the
country because it brought the prob
lems of the League of Nations so
effectively before the people of this
country, came somewhat as a surprise.
"This debate is laying the foundation
to the league," he said.
In reply to the much repeated argu
ment of the Republican leaders, Mr.
Soover stated that he did not believe
tluJl the Un'ted States would evei be
forced into a world war without the
unanimous vote of its own leaders.

In other words the League of Nations
.cannot force any nation into war with
out the consent of that nation.
The complete tevt of Hoover's great
speech follows:
1 have been urged by Mr. Taft and
others to state at some greater length
my views on the peace treaty, and I
take this occasion to present them to
my own townspeople. During the ten
months between the armistice and har
vest I acted as the economic director
for the Supreme War Council. I was
necessarily in intimate contact witli the
political and economic situation all
over Europe. I was not one of the
American Peace delegates, but the pur
pose of my office was to act on behalf
of the United States and the Peace
Conference in an effort to save life and
prevent anarchy while the peace was
negotiated. I therefore had an advan
tageous position to independently ob
serve the growth of ideas in the Con
ference and the re-percussions of these
ideas through Europe.
I am not of those who have an im
patience of honest debate. 1 believe
that the debate of the League of Na
tions going on in the United States is
building tlic very foundations of the
League. It is bringing home to every
household in the country the necessity
and possibility of providing for our own
safety and of providing for the safety
of the world as a whole without great
armies or navies. Nor do I believe in
the criticism of the Senate for not ac
cepting out of hand this document so
laboriously evolved by five hundred con
flicting minds in Paris. It is a funda
mental part of our institutions that the
Senate shall scrutinize these matters.
Consideration and debate by the Senate
is not trahorship.
Nor were those Americans traitors
who. in representing us in Paris, fought
for every inch of hope that the weak
could be protected and the strong
curbed, that the United States could it
self be protected. Tf they were traitors
to their country it was because they were
wrong in assuming that the American
people wished an effort made to destroy
the seeds of war and thus to secure the
growth of liberty.
The treaty finally reached at Paris is
by no means perfect. I see no method
by which it could have been made per
fect when five hundred men, represent
ing twenty-three different nationalities,
were engaged in its negotiations, and
agreement had to be unanimous. Diff
ence in national character and in national
aspirations could but cause much dif
ference in views. Many of them repre
sented desperate, passionate or selfish ob
jects, some were dominated by political
ideals of the last century, yet the most
were actuated by the prayers of the com
mon people, who really fought this war,
that it should be the last war. There ex
isted in the world before this Conference
scores of those major international
wrongs which breed war. Of these the
Peace Conference corrected some, but it
will take perhaps a hundred years for
the men of good will to correct them all.
It is often overlooked that this was not
a conference to settle wrongs committed
by Allies and neutrals, but by the enemy
only. It was German wrongs that were
on the operating table. It would have
been beautiful to have all the interna
tional wrongs on the table, but this is not
a perfect world. As a practical fact, if
this had been attempted, the Conference
would have broken up !n quarrels among
the Allies, and Germany would have been
handed again the domination of Europe.
The old guard in Germany hoped and
expected that this would result; up to
date at least they have been disappointed.
No one could be more disappointed than
the American delegation that some great
wrongs that were the result of the secret
treaties that had been written in times of
complete desperation amongst the origi
nal allies were not eradicated at the Con
ference. In this the American group
were a minority of one, endeavoring to
secure that right should be done, in a
meeting that required unanimous agree
ment. There are many other items in

the treaty which men of good will would
have liked to see different. Our dele
gation could have found cause to with
draw from the Conference on many
scores. We would have been withdraw
ing in the face of the enemy, and Ger
many, by this division of the Allies,
would have been victorious.
Greater things were accomplished by
this Conference than by any other in
history. The military oligarchys of Ger
many, Austria, and Turkey were dis
solved, and if peace is ratified in time
they will be disarmed, and thus a para
mount menace to us and the world will
be destroyed. The Poles, the Czechs,
the Finns, the Croats, and the Slovenes
and Slovacks, the Baltic States, Arme
nians, Arabs have, or will, subject to
ratification, secure their liberty. Par
cels of French, Italians, Roumanians,
Serbians, Greeks have been rejoined to
their mother countries. Representative
democratic governments were set up on
the liberated and enemy states. Meth
ods were devised by which these people
would be free from economic domina
tion and by which the Germans and
their allies would be made to pay some
thing on account of the terrible destruc
tion they have wrought as a lesson to
militarism.
The men of liberal vision at the Con
ference were steadfast for certain domi
nant ideals that mark this conference
apait from all others. First, that this
settlement should remove as many of the
immediate causes of war as possible by
destroying enemy domination over other
races. Second, by establishing the new
governments on a democratic basis so
that wars should not be made by auto
that wars should not be made by autoc
racies for the profit of their class.
Third, that there should be established a
world council—the League. Here these
newly liberated peoples could lind some
measure of protection from invasion.
Here, with the stimulation of the world
conscience awakened by this war, there
could be no hope that the wrongs among
other peoples could be brought for dis
cussion and negotiation. Here, if ag
gression were undertaken, the public
opinion of the world could be enlight
ened and the aggressor could be made
an outcast from the society of the civ
ilized nations. Thus only could some
thing constructive be done to end war.
This is an aspiration which has been
rising in the hearts of all the world.
It has become an insistence in the
minds of all those in the world to

whom the lives of our sons are precious,
to all those to whom civilization is a
tiling to be safeguarded, and all those
who see no hope for the amelioration
of the misery of those who toil if peace
cannot be maintained.
Jo form a League of Nations for this
purpose has been proposed by the leaders
of both our great parties time and
again. It has been proposed by lead
ing spirits in all civilized nations. It
belongs to no one man, it comes from
the heart and mind of the world.
1 haye always regarded it a mistake
that this was termed "League," for the
term smacks of military alliance. It
is, in fact, a council of nations that re
quires in all important matters unani
mous decision.
'1 he major provisions of this council
look toward disarmament and provision
of place ind time, for negotiation and
arbitration of quarrels. Its most potent
weapon is the determination of rights
and wrongs of international quarrels
and the enlightenment of the world
upon them and thus the moral isolation
of the aggressor. If this fails, its sec
ond weapon is the boycott, the most
potent force in the world to-day—the
force that more than any other brought
Germany to her knees. It agrees that
military force can be used in defense
against invasion of one country by an
other, but in this, as in other important
things, unanimous consent is required,
and consent must mean the United
States Congress on our side. From my
own experience, 1 believe that the dis
cussion, negotiation, arbitration, enlight
enment of public opinion and thus the
moral definition of an outcast will be
all-sufficient, coupled with the knowl
edge that other wcapous exist. The hope
that I, as an independent observer, have
placed in the League was that it would
forever relieve the United States of the
necessity to again send a single soldier
outside of our boundaries.
The opponents of the League are of
many conflicting minds. There are those
who truly wish this experiment in the
promotion and preservation of human
liberty to be tried; tTTey, however, wish
the details altered and have fears that
the details agreed upon may themselves
involve us in war. Others believe that
the interest of the United States lies in
keeping out of all international action.
Others believe that the old game of arms
is the best promoter of civilization; still
others oppose it from disappointment
that all the ills of the world were not

corrected at this one session of the na
tion. But few of tliem acknowledge that
this terrible upheaval and its aftermath
of conflicting economic, social, and politi
cal forces lias endangered the stability
of the world for years to come.
Those who formulated the League did
not expect that it would furnish an over
night solution to all uncorrected inter
national wrongs or the disruption of
the.se unloosened forces. They did ex
pect that by degrees ttiere would be a
definite alignment of opinion in the
world that would make these wrongs
less and that could in great measure
restrain the actual outbreaks of war, that
could give the world time to heal its
wounds. Even the Sermon on the
Mount did not wholly regenerate the
world.
We-hear the cry that the League obli
gates that our sons be sent to tight in
foreign lands. Yet the very intent and
structure of the League is to prevent
war. There is no obligation for the

United States to engage in military op
erations or to allow any interference
with our internal affairs without the full
consent of our representatives in the
League. If there is any danger that we
should be charged with an obligation to
go to war, either direct or implied, with
out the full consent and approval of
Congress, I believe the President will be
the first to agree to any interpretation
that this cannot be. The French govern
ment so far takes this view that it has
requested from us a separate military
guaranty for themselves.
The League is founded expressly in
the attempt to secure the pacific settle
ment of these questions without military
force. To me, every line of it is the
complete negation of militarism. Dur
ing the course of negotiations in Paris
one fact stood out with regard to the
League. Its opposition there arose en
tirely from the old militaristic regimes,
and from the reactionaries of the world
in general. They saw in it trulv the
undermining of militarism. They had
the vision to see. and even to openly
state, that it would mean the ultimate
abandonment of military force in the
world, for thev. as of old, contend that
without military exercise there is no hope
of the maintenance of human efficiency
or control of the masses. What they
foresaw has already happened in a great
military nation like the British, where
the population, broken under a load of
taxation, is responding quickly to the new
possibility of international safety with
out the burden of gigantic naval arma
ment. The reactionaries saw that under
the hope for the protection of the League
of Nations there would be a growing op
position to the burden of armament from
all those who labor with hand and mind.
It is the workers of the world who
pay the price of war, not alone in the
support of arms but in blood and in the
support to tyranny which armies mean in
peace.
All wars have hitherto been settled on
the basis of trying to create a balance of
military strength by intriguing peoples j
into various groups oT equal military j
weight—the balance of power. Tt would
have been impossible to give liberty to j
the score of new nations of militarily I
weak yet liberty-loving people without!
the League to safeguard them from in
vasion. Beyond this, every attempt to
set up this balance hitherto has ultimately
crashed in war, for its essence is militar
ism. The creation of the League brought I
new hopes into the peace, and if the
League fails these new liberated nations
must fall, for the world must readjust
itself into the balance of power, and great
wars will re-open at once in this re
alignment. In a recent visit to many of
the capitals of the new states, the first
anxious question of their officials was,
"Will America ratify the League?" Their
invariable answer was that without it
their only course was the hopeless effort
to arm themselves against stronger neigh
bors; to do it in the midst of misery;
to endeavor to set up groups and military
alliances with all the old treadmill of
oppression of arms and ultimate war.
There are many elements in Europe
who wish to see the treaty break down
and the League of Nations disappear.
For instance, during the last five months
our Allies have been growing weaker
from a military point of view, due to the
necessity of demobilizing their armies,
while at the same time the reactionary
group in Germany has been growing in
strength through the recreation of hopes
of yet securing a division of the Allies.
At the time I left Europe a month ago,
German militarism had already re-estab
lished itself as a well-disciplined, well
officered army of at least 400,000 men,
largely congregated on the Polish fron
tier and even defying the government at
Berlin. Under the alarm of this danger,
the Poles, in the midst of the greatest
economic misery that a nation ever knew,
have been trying to create an army of
500,000 men for their protection from the
Germans on one side and the Bolsheviks
on the other. If the treaty is ratified the
German army will be reduced to 200,000
men and dispersed over Germany, and
their extra armament destroyed. The
failure of the treaty means the invasion
of the Polish state. This is only one of
the powder magazines in Europe which
cannot be destroyed *mtil this treaty is
ratified, and during every day of delay
more explosives are poured into them.
For good or ill, the entire treaty was
constructed around this central theme of
a League of Nations to prevent war. A
score of provisions in tTie treaty and out
side the covenant necessitate its erec
tion. To avoid causes of war, the
League has been made the trustee to
secure outlets to the sea, to secure free
ports to inland peoples, to settle deferred
disputes which could not otherwise hope
for solution without dangerous friction.
The treaties themselves cannot be car
ried out without the League. If the
League falls the treaties also fall.
The boundaries of these new states
cannot precisely include all their own
nationals, for the borders are lined with
racial islands and friction. Peace and
a moderating council are required for
readjustments. Their outlets to sea by
rail, canal, and viver are through other
states; their whole political and economic
situation demands peace for the growth
of order and the prevention of anarchy.
If the balance of power has to supplant
the League of Nations we will have
torn asunder the only hope that Europe
will not break into further wars of races,
classes, and groups that will take her
civilization back to the Middle Ages. I
am convinced that if we attempt now
to revise the treaty we shall tread a road
through European chaos. Even if we
managed to keep our soldiers out of it
we will not scape fearful economic
losses.
If the League is to break down we
must at once prepare to fight. Few
people seem to realize the desperation to
which Europe has been reduced. During
the coming winter son.c of them will look
with longing eyes on this rich, fat na
tion, possessing great surpluses of every
human necessity, wh/fe they endure in
evitable hunger and cold. At the same
time the energy of our population is sup
planting them in places where their mer
chants expect to market their goods and
operate their ships. Others of them will
he plunged into war with their neighbors,
and we have already experienced the diffi
culty of maintaining neutrality with self
respect and safety. We cannot fiddle
while Rome burns.
The Allies may themselves ratify this
treaty without us, and thus assemble a
Council of Nations of their own in an
endeavor to solve the problem of Europe.
It would be a Council of Europe, and in
the midst of these terrible times, with the
debts they owe to us, the material they
must have from us or starve, I would
rather be represented therein lest it be
come a League of Europe against the
Western Hemisphere. A peace without
us means more army and navy for us,
with the old treadmill of taxes and
dangers.
It is true we are not loved by certain
classes of people, some of them among
our former allies. It is untrue, however,
to say that the masses of any nation now
hate us. It is still more untrue to say
that the newly liberated peoples look to
us with other than conviction that our
moral leadership is their only hope. We
are not loved by any military class,
whether in the allied or enemy countries.
()ur whole object has been to destroy
their calling, to undermine their class.
! lie great masses of burdened working
people, however, look for us to support
this one hope of relief from domination
from burdens and misery of arms and
war.
Neither the gospel of hate nor the
gospel of unpreparedness are the roads
to peace. The true road lies in every
effort to remove the causes of war, not
in tearing down such structure of peace
as we have, nor in blindness to present
dangers.
Those who think we can isolate our
selves seem to ignore the fact that mod
ern communication has shortened our
distance from our neighbors from a
month to an hour. A vast amount of
our civilization and the daily improve
ments of life that come to our people
are the products of the ideas and in
telligence and labor of our neighbors.
If we believe we can see our neighbors
return to thirty years' war through the
breakdown of this treaty and we still
maintain our progress, it is the egotism
of insanity. We arc an overseas people,
and we are dependent upon Europe for
marks for the surplus products of our
farmers and laborers. Without order in
Europe we will at best have business de
pression, unemployment, and all their
burden of troubles. With renewed dis
organization in Europe, social diseases
and anarchy thrive, and we are infected
with every social wind of Europe. We
are forced to interest ourselves in the
welfare of the world if we are to thrive.
There is no American who has spent the
last ten months in Europe who does not
pray that we should g*r out of entangle
ment in the sordid selfishness, the pas
sions, the misery of it. But our expan
sion overseas has entangled us for good
or ill, and I stand for an honest attempt
to join with Europe's better spirit to
prevent these entanglements from in
volving us in war. We are not dealing
with perfection; we are dealing with
the lesser of evils. These are reasons
of interest.
There are also reasons of idealism,
and true national interest lies along the
path of practical ideals, and there are
ideals in Europe. During the last hun
dred and fifty years a far larger pro
portion of our citizens liave grown far
ahead of those of Europe in outlook on
life, in disinterested sense of justice, in
sympathy with the downtrodden. It
was with the hope of ending war that
we went into it, and to fix it in inter
national law that dominated our repre
sentatives in the Peace Conference. We
have expended the lives of our sons
and an enormous portion of our wealth,
hoping to see these ends. For us to re
fuse to enter into a joint attempt with
the well-thinking sections of a large
part of the world to establish a contin
uing moral conscience against war is the
utmost folly in our own interest.
We have been the center and inspira
tion of democracy for a hundred years.
We have given sympathy and encour
agement to every aspiration for self-gov
ernment for all this time. We have from
our experience in its blessings believed
it made for peace and well-being. We
enjoy from it the highest standard of
living in the world. We went to Eu
rope with our best blood and our treas
ures and fought the attempt to impose
autocracy on the world. We won. We
imposed democracy all over Europe. We
set up a score of new democracies—and
they are many of them peoples of our
own blood—the Baltic, Polish, and Slav
races. Arc we to refuse our counsels to
these peoples now struggling to realize
our own ideals? Curious as it may seem,
this also embraces Germany itself. That
sincerely democratic group which to-day
controls Germany is losing ground lie
fore the old reactionary group who em
ploy tlu- hope of the failure of the league
to fan the renewed hope of domination.
I am one of those who hold that this
war would never have happened if the
nations of Europe had accepted the invi
tation of Sir Edward Gray to a confer
ence of civilians in July, 1914. I believe
that if the intelligence of the world can
be aggregated around a table, the pres
sures from the responsibility of these
men for the possible enormous loss of

life and the fabulous amount of human
misery created by their failure to pre
vent war, are such that no body of de
cent men in these times can fail to se
cure some sort of solution short of war.
We have now seen the most terrible five
years of history because the reaction
aries of Europe refused to come into a
room to discuss the welfare of humanity.
From this mightv political, social, and
economic upheaval there are a host of
outstanding problems which can Weed
war at any minute. The Liberal world
is asking us to come into a Council to
find the solution for these things. It is
not asking for soldiers, it is asking for
our economic and moral weight, our
idealism, and our disinterested sense of
justice. Are we willing to take the re
sponsibility that now rests on the souls
of those men in Europe wlio refused this
invitation in 1914?
DEIIHAPS the most ti nificant speech
ever delivered in t|e Stanford As
sembly Hall by any speaker, was that
of Herbert Hoover, '95, yesterday aft
ernoon. No man has been more looked
to by a greater number of people dur
ing the world war, than Mr. Hoover,
and on this account, his words spoken
yesterday concerning the future peace
of the world will 1 e barkened to Ly
all nations. Stanford was indeed
honored by Mr. Hoover when he chose
his Alma Mater as the most fitting
place in which to give the firs' public
expressi jn of those views which the
entire world has been waiting to hear.

has been going on in the United

outside of our boundaries.
The opponents of the League are of
many conflicting minds. There are those
who truly wish this experiment in the
promotion and preservation of human
liberty to be tried; tTTey, however, wish
the details altered and have fears that
the details agreed upon may themselves
involve us in war. Others believe that
the interest of the United States lies in
keeping out of all international action.
Others believe that the old game of arms
is the best promoter of civilization; still
others oppose it from disappointment
that all the ills of the world were not

corrected at this one session of the na
tion. But few of tliem acknowledge that
this terrible upheaval and its aftermath
of conflicting economic, social, and politi
cal forces lias endangered the stability
of the world for years to come.
Those who formulated the League did
not expect that it would furnish an over
night solution to all uncorrected inter
national wrongs or the disruption of
the.se unloosened forces. They did ex
pect that by degrees ttiere would be a
definite alignment of opinion in the
world that would make these wrongs
less and that could in great measure
restrain the actual outbreaks of war, that
could give the world time to heal its
wounds. Even the Sermon on the
Mount did not wholly regenerate the
world.
We-hear the cry that the League obli
gates that our sons be sent to tight in
foreign lands. Yet the very intent and
structure of the League is to prevent
war. There is no obligation for the

United States to engage in military op
erations or to allow any interference
with our internal affairs without the full
consent of our representatives in the
League. If there is any danger that we
should be charged with an obligation to
go to war, either direct or implied, with
out the full consent and approval of
Congress, I believe the President will be
the first to agree to any interpretation
that this cannot be. The French govern
ment so far takes this view that it has
requested from us a separate military
guaranty for themselves.
The League is founded expressly in
the attempt to secure the pacific settle
ment of these questions without military
force. To me, every line of it is the
complete negation of militarism. Dur
ing the course of negotiations in Paris
one fact stood out with regard to the
League. Its opposition there arose en
tirely from the old militaristic regimes,
and from the reactionaries of the world
in general. They saw in it trulv the
undermining of militarism. They had
the vision to see. and even to openly
state, that it would mean the ultimate
abandonment of military force in the
world, for thev. as of old, contend that
without military exercise there is no hope
of the maintenance of human efficiency
or control of the masses. What they
foresaw has already happened in a great
military nation like the British, where
the population, broken under a load of
taxation, is responding quickly to the new
possibility of international safety with
out the burden of gigantic naval arma
ment. The reactionaries saw that under
the hope for the protection of the League
of Nations there would be a growing op
position to the burden of armament from
all those who labor with hand and mind.
It is the workers of the world who
pay the price of war, not alone in the
support of arms but in blood and in the
support to tyranny which armies mean in
peace.
All wars have hitherto been settled on
the basis of trying to create a balance of
military strength by intriguing peoples j
into various groups oT equal military j
weight—the balance of power. Tt would
have been impossible to give liberty to j
the score of new nations of militarily I
weak yet liberty-loving people without!
the League to safeguard them from in
vasion. Beyond this, every attempt to
set up this balance hitherto has ultimately
crashed in war, for its essence is militar
ism. The creation of the League brought I
new hopes into the peace, and if the
League fails these new liberated nations
must fall, for the world must readjust
itself into the balance of power, and great
wars will re-open at once in this re
alignment. In a recent visit to many of
the capitals of the new states, the first
anxious question of their officials was,
"Will America ratify the League?" Their
invariable answer was that without it
their only course was the hopeless effort
to arm themselves against stronger neigh
bors; to do it in the midst of misery;
to endeavor to set up groups and military
alliances with all the old treadmill of
oppression of arms and ultimate war.
There are many elements in Europe
who wish to see the treaty break down
and the League of Nations disappear.
For instance, during the last five months
our Allies have been growing weaker
from a military point of view, due to the
necessity of demobilizing their armies,
while at the same time the reactionary
group in Germany has been growing in
strength through the recreation of hopes
of yet securing a division of the Allies.
At the time I left Europe a month ago,
German militarism had already re-estab
lished itself as a well-disciplined, well
officered army of at least 400,000 men,
largely congregated on the Polish fron
tier and even defying the government at
Berlin. Under the alarm of this danger,
the Poles, in the midst of the greatest
economic misery that a nation ever knew,
have been trying to create an army of
500,000 men for their protection from the
Germans on one side and the Bolsheviks
on the other. If the treaty is ratified the
German army will be reduced to 200,000
men and dispersed over Germany, and
their extra armament destroyed. The
failure of the treaty means the invasion
of the Polish state. This is only one of
the powder magazines in Europe which
cannot be destroyed *mtil this treaty is
ratified, and during every day of delay
more explosives are poured into them.
For good or ill, the entire treaty was
constructed around this central theme of
a League of Nations to prevent war. A
score of provisions in tTie treaty and out
side the covenant necessitate its erec
tion. To avoid causes of war, the
League has been made the trustee to
secure outlets to the sea, to secure free
ports to inland peoples, to settle deferred
disputes which could not otherwise hope
for solution without dangerous friction.
The treaties themselves cannot be car
ried out without the League. If the
League falls the treaties also fall.
The boundaries of these new states
cannot precisely include all their own
nationals, for the borders are lined with
racial islands and friction. Peace and
a moderating council are required for
readjustments. Their outlets to sea by
rail, canal, and viver are through other
states; their whole political and economic
situation demands peace for the growth
of order and the prevention of anarchy.
If the balance of power has to supplant
the League of Nations we will have
torn asunder the only hope that Europe
will not break into further wars of races,
classes, and groups that will take her
civilization back to the Middle Ages. I
am convinced that if we attempt now
to revise the treaty we shall tread a road
through European chaos. Even if we
managed to keep our soldiers out of it
we will not scape fearful economic
losses.
If the League is to break down we
must at once prepare to fight. Few
people seem to realize the desperation to
which Europe has been reduced. During
the coming winter son.c of them will look
with longing eyes on this rich, fat na
tion, possessing great surpluses of every
human necessity, wh/fe they endure in
evitable hunger and cold. At the same
time the energy of our population is sup
planting them in places where their mer
chants expect to market their goods and
operate their ships. Others of them will
he plunged into war with their neighbors,
and we have already experienced the diffi
culty of maintaining neutrality with self
respect and safety. We cannot fiddle
while Rome burns.
The Allies may themselves ratify this
treaty without us, and thus assemble a
Council of Nations of their own in an
endeavor to solve the problem of Europe.
It would be a Council of Europe, and in
the midst of these terrible times, with the
debts they owe to us, the material they
must have from us or starve, I would
rather be represented therein lest it be
come a League of Europe against the
Western Hemisphere. A peace without
us means more army and navy for us,
with the old treadmill of taxes and
dangers.
It is true we are not loved by certain
classes of people, some of them among
our former allies. It is untrue, however,
to say that the masses of any nation now
hate us. It is still more untrue to say
that the newly liberated peoples look to
us with other than conviction that our
moral leadership is their only hope. We
are not loved by any military class,
whether in the allied or enemy countries.
()ur whole object has been to destroy
their calling, to undermine their class.
! lie great masses of burdened working
people, however, look for us to support
this one hope of relief from domination
from burdens and misery of arms and
war.
Neither the gospel of hate nor the
gospel of unpreparedness are the roads
to peace. The true road lies in every
effort to remove the causes of war, not
in tearing down such structure of peace
as we have, nor in blindness to present
dangers.
Those who think we can isolate our
selves seem to ignore the fact that mod
ern communication has shortened our
distance from our neighbors from a
month to an hour. A vast amount of
our civilization and the daily improve
ments of life that come to our people
are the products of the ideas and in
telligence and labor of our neighbors.
If we believe we can see our neighbors
return to thirty years' war through the
breakdown of this treaty and we still
maintain our progress, it is the egotism
of insanity. We arc an overseas people,
and we are dependent upon Europe for
marks for the surplus products of our
farmers and laborers. Without order in
Europe we will at best have business de
pression, unemployment, and all their
burden of troubles. With renewed dis
organization in Europe, social diseases
and anarchy thrive, and we are infected
with every social wind of Europe. We
are forced to interest ourselves in the
welfare of the world if we are to thrive.
There is no American who has spent the
last ten months in Europe who does not
pray that we should g*r out of entangle
ment in the sordid selfishness, the pas
sions, the misery of it. But our expan
sion overseas has entangled us for good
or ill, and I stand for an honest attempt
to join with Europe's better spirit to
prevent these entanglements from in
volving us in war. We are not dealing
with perfection; we are dealing with
the lesser of evils. These are reasons
of interest.
There are also reasons of idealism,
and true national interest lies along the
path of practical ideals, and there are
ideals in Europe. During the last hun
dred and fifty years a far larger pro
portion of our citizens liave grown far
ahead of those of Europe in outlook on
life, in disinterested sense of justice, in
sympathy with the downtrodden. It
was with the hope of ending war that
we went into it, and to fix it in inter
national law that dominated our repre
sentatives in the Peace Conference. We
have expended the lives of our sons
and an enormous portion of our wealth,
hoping to see these ends. For us to re
fuse to enter into a joint attempt with
the well-thinking sections of a large
part of the world to establish a contin
uing moral conscience against war is the
utmost folly in our own interest.
We have been the center and inspira
tion of democracy for a hundred years.
We have given sympathy and encour
agement to every aspiration for self-gov
ernment for all this time. We have from
our experience in its blessings believed
it made for peace and well-being. We
enjoy from it the highest standard of
living in the world. We went to Eu
rope with our best blood and our treas
ures and fought the attempt to impose
autocracy on the world. We won. We
imposed democracy all over Europe. We
set up a score of new democracies—and
they are many of them peoples of our
own blood—the Baltic, Polish, and Slav
races. Arc we to refuse our counsels to
these peoples now struggling to realize
our own ideals? Curious as it may seem,
this also embraces Germany itself. That
sincerely democratic group which to-day
controls Germany is losing ground lie
fore the old reactionary group who em
ploy tlu- hope of the failure of the league
to fan the renewed hope of domination.
I am one of those who hold that this
war would never have happened if the
nations of Europe had accepted the invi
tation of Sir Edward Gray to a confer
ence of civilians in July, 1914. I believe
that if the intelligence of the world can
be aggregated around a table, the pres
sures from the responsibility of these
men for the possible enormous loss of

life and the fabulous amount of human
misery created by their failure to pre
vent war, are such that no body of de
cent men in these times can fail to se
cure some sort of solution short of war.
We have now seen the most terrible five
years of history because the reaction
aries of Europe refused to come into a
room to discuss the welfare of humanity.
From this mightv political, social, and
economic upheaval there are a host of
outstanding problems which can Weed
war at any minute. The Liberal world
is asking us to come into a Council to
find the solution for these things. It is
not asking for soldiers, it is asking for
our economic and moral weight, our
idealism, and our disinterested sense of
justice. Are we willing to take the re
sponsibility that now rests on the souls
of those men in Europe wlio refused this
invitation in 1914?
DEIIHAPS the most ti nificant speech
ever delivered in t|e Stanford As
sembly Hall by any speaker, was that
of Herbert Hoover, '95, yesterday aft
ernoon. No man has been more looked
to by a greater number of people dur
ing the world war, than Mr. Hoover,
and on this account, his words spoken
yesterday concerning the future peace
of the world will 1 e barkened to Ly
all nations. Stanford was indeed
honored by Mr. Hoover when he chose
his Alma Mater as the most fitting
place in which to give the firs' public
expressi jn of those views which the
entire world has been waiting to hear.
In light of the stormy debate which
has been going on in the United
States Senate, and the tours made by
President Wilson and Senator John
son, Mr. Hoover made several signi
ficant points. The fact that he ap
proved the debate that has swept the
country because it brought the prob
lems of the League of Nations so
effectively before the people of this
country, came somewhat as a surprise.
"This debate is laying the foundation
to the league," he said.
In reply to the much repeated argu
ment of the Republican leaders, Mr.
Soover stated that he did not believe
tluJl the Un'ted States would evei be
forced into a world war without the
unanimous vote of its own leaders.

In other words the League of Nations
.cannot force any nation into war with
out the consent of that nation.
The complete tevt of Hoover's great
speech follows:
1 have been urged by Mr. Taft and
others to state at some greater length
my views on the peace treaty, and I
take this occasion to present them to
my own townspeople. During the ten
months between the armistice and har
vest I acted as the economic director
for the Supreme War Council. I was
necessarily in intimate contact witli the
political and economic situation all
over Europe. I was not one of the
American Peace delegates, but the pur
pose of my office was to act on behalf
of the United States and the Peace
Conference in an effort to save life and
prevent anarchy while the peace was
negotiated. I therefore had an advan
tageous position to independently ob
serve the growth of ideas in the Con
ference and the re-percussions of these
ideas through Europe.
I am not of those who have an im
patience of honest debate. 1 believe
that the debate of the League of Na
tions going on in the United States is
building tlic very foundations of the
League. It is bringing home to every
household in the country the necessity
and possibility of providing for our own
safety and of providing for the safety
of the world as a whole without great
armies or navies. Nor do I believe in
the criticism of the Senate for not ac
cepting out of hand this document so
laboriously evolved by five hundred con
flicting minds in Paris. It is a funda
mental part of our institutions that the
Senate shall scrutinize these matters.
Consideration and debate by the Senate
is not trahorship.
Nor were those Americans traitors
who. in representing us in Paris, fought
for every inch of hope that the weak
could be protected and the strong
curbed, that the United States could it
self be protected. Tf they were traitors
to their country it was because they were
wrong in assuming that the American
people wished an effort made to destroy
the seeds of war and thus to secure the
growth of liberty.
The treaty finally reached at Paris is
by no means perfect. I see no method
by which it could have been made per
fect when five hundred men, represent
ing twenty-three different nationalities,
were engaged in its negotiations, and
agreement had to be unanimous. Diff
ence in national character and in national
aspirations could but cause much dif
ference in views. Many of them repre
sented desperate, passionate or selfish ob
jects, some were dominated by political
ideals of the last century, yet the most
were actuated by the prayers of the com
mon people, who really fought this war,
that it should be the last war. There ex
isted in the world before this Conference
scores of those major international
wrongs which breed war. Of these the
Peace Conference corrected some, but it
will take perhaps a hundred years for
the men of good will to correct them all.
It is often overlooked that this was not
a conference to settle wrongs committed
by Allies and neutrals, but by the enemy
only. It was German wrongs that were
on the operating table. It would have
been beautiful to have all the interna
tional wrongs on the table, but this is not
a perfect world. As a practical fact, if
this had been attempted, the Conference
would have broken up !n quarrels among
the Allies, and Germany would have been
handed again the domination of Europe.
The old guard in Germany hoped and
expected that this would result; up to
date at least they have been disappointed.
No one could be more disappointed than
the American delegation that some great
wrongs that were the result of the secret
treaties that had been written in times of
complete desperation amongst the origi
nal allies were not eradicated at the Con
ference. In this the American group
were a minority of one, endeavoring to
secure that right should be done, in a
meeting that required unanimous agree
ment. There are many other items in

the treaty which men of good will would
have liked to see different. Our dele
gation could have found cause to with
draw from the Conference on many
scores. We would have been withdraw
ing in the face of the enemy, and Ger
many, by this division of the Allies,
would have been victorious.
Greater things were accomplished by
this Conference than by any other in
history. The military oligarchys of Ger
many, Austria, and Turkey were dis
solved, and if peace is ratified in time
they will be disarmed, and thus a para
mount menace to us and the world will
be destroyed. The Poles, the Czechs,
the Finns, the Croats, and the Slovenes
and Slovacks, the Baltic States, Arme
nians, Arabs have, or will, subject to
ratification, secure their liberty. Par
cels of French, Italians, Roumanians,
Serbians, Greeks have been rejoined to
their mother countries. Representative
democratic governments were set up on
the liberated and enemy states. Meth
ods were devised by which these people
would be free from economic domina
tion and by which the Germans and
their allies would be made to pay some
thing on account of the terrible destruc
tion they have wrought as a lesson to
militarism.
The men of liberal vision at the Con
ference were steadfast for certain domi
nant ideals that mark this conference
apait from all others. First, that this
settlement should remove as many of the
immediate causes of war as possible by
destroying enemy domination over other
races. Second, by establishing the new
governments on a democratic basis so
that wars should not be made by auto
that wars should not be made by autoc
racies for the profit of their class.
Third, that there should be established a
world council—the League. Here these
newly liberated peoples could lind some
measure of protection from invasion.
Here, with the stimulation of the world
conscience awakened by this war, there
could be no hope that the wrongs among
other peoples could be brought for dis
cussion and negotiation. Here, if ag
gression were undertaken, the public
opinion of the world could be enlight
ened and the aggressor could be made
an outcast from the society of the civ
ilized nations. Thus only could some
thing constructive be done to end war.
This is an aspiration which has been
rising in the hearts of all the world.
It has become an insistence in the
minds of all those in the world to

whom the lives of our sons are precious,
to all those to whom civilization is a
tiling to be safeguarded, and all those
who see no hope for the amelioration
of the misery of those who toil if peace
cannot be maintained.
Jo form a League of Nations for this
purpose has been proposed by the leaders
of both our great parties time and
again. It has been proposed by lead
ing spirits in all civilized nations. It
belongs to no one man, it comes from
the heart and mind of the world.
1 haye always regarded it a mistake
that this was termed "League," for the
term smacks of military alliance. It
is, in fact, a council of nations that re
quires in all important matters unani
mous decision.
'1 he major provisions of this council
look toward disarmament and provision
of place ind time, for negotiation and
arbitration of quarrels. Its most potent
weapon is the determination of rights
and wrongs of international quarrels
and the enlightenment of the world
upon them and thus the moral isolation
of the aggressor. If this fails, its sec
ond weapon is the boycott, the most
potent force in the world to-day—the
force that more than any other brought
Germany to her knees. It agrees that
military force can be used in defense
against invasion of one country by an
other, but in this, as in other important
things, unanimous consent is required,
and consent must mean the United
States Congress on our side. From my
own experience, 1 believe that the dis
cussion, negotiation, arbitration, enlight
enment of public opinion and thus the
moral definition of an outcast will be
all-sufficient, coupled with the knowl
edge that other wcapous exist. The hope
that I, as an independent observer, have
placed in the League was that it would
forever relieve the United States of the
necessity to again send a single soldier
outside of our boundaries.
The opponents of the League are of
many conflicting minds. There are those
who truly wish this experiment in the
promotion and preservation of human
liberty to be tried; tTTey, however, wish
the details altered and have fears that

! lie great masses of burdened working
people, however, look for us to support
this one hope of relief from domination
from burdens and misery of arms and
war.
Neither the gospel of hate nor the
gospel of unpreparedness are the roads
to peace. The true road lies in every
effort to remove the causes of war, not
in tearing down such structure of peace
as we have, nor in blindness to present
dangers.
Those who think we can isolate our
selves seem to ignore the fact that mod
ern communication has shortened our
distance from our neighbors from a
month to an hour. A vast amount of
our civilization and the daily improve
ments of life that come to our people
are the products of the ideas and in
telligence and labor of our neighbors.
If we believe we can see our neighbors
return to thirty years' war through the
breakdown of this treaty and we still
maintain our progress, it is the egotism
of insanity. We arc an overseas people,
and we are dependent upon Europe for
marks for the surplus products of our
farmers and laborers. Without order in
Europe we will at best have business de
pression, unemployment, and all their
burden of troubles. With renewed dis
organization in Europe, social diseases
and anarchy thrive, and we are infected
with every social wind of Europe. We
are forced to interest ourselves in the
welfare of the world if we are to thrive.
There is no American who has spent the
last ten months in Europe who does not
pray that we should g*r out of entangle
ment in the sordid selfishness, the pas
sions, the misery of it. But our expan
sion overseas has entangled us for good
or ill, and I stand for an honest attempt
to join with Europe's better spirit to
prevent these entanglements from in
volving us in war. We are not dealing
with perfection; we are dealing with
the lesser of evils. These are reasons
of interest.
There are also reasons of idealism,
and true national interest lies along the
path of practical ideals, and there are
ideals in Europe. During the last hun
dred and fifty years a far larger pro
portion of our citizens liave grown far
ahead of those of Europe in outlook on
life, in disinterested sense of justice, in
sympathy with the downtrodden. It
was with the hope of ending war that
we went into it, and to fix it in inter
national law that dominated our repre
sentatives in the Peace Conference. We
have expended the lives of our sons
and an enormous portion of our wealth,
hoping to see these ends. For us to re
fuse to enter into a joint attempt with
the well-thinking sections of a large
part of the world to establish a contin
uing moral conscience against war is the
utmost folly in our own interest.
We have been the center and inspira
tion of democracy for a hundred years.
We have given sympathy and encour
agement to every aspiration for self-gov
ernment for all this time. We have from
our experience in its blessings believed
it made for peace and well-being. We
enjoy from it the highest standard of
living in the world. We went to Eu
rope with our best blood and our treas
ures and fought the attempt to impose
autocracy on the world. We won. We
imposed democracy all over Europe. We
set up a score of new democracies—and
they are many of them peoples of our
own blood—the Baltic, Polish, and Slav
races. Arc we to refuse our counsels to
these peoples now struggling to realize
our own ideals? Curious as it may seem,
this also embraces Germany itself. That
sincerely democratic group which to-day
controls Germany is losing ground lie
fore the old reactionary group who em
ploy tlu- hope of the failure of the league
to fan the renewed hope of domination.
I am one of those who hold that this
war would never have happened if the
nations of Europe had accepted the invi
tation of Sir Edward Gray to a confer
ence of civilians in July, 1914. I believe
that if the intelligence of the world can
be aggregated around a table, the pres
sures from the responsibility of these
men for the possible enormous loss of

life and the fabulous amount of human
misery created by their failure to pre
vent war, are such that no body of de
cent men in these times can fail to se
cure some sort of solution short of war.
We have now seen the most terrible five
years of history because the reaction
aries of Europe refused to come into a
room to discuss the welfare of humanity.
From this mightv political, social, and
economic upheaval there are a host of
outstanding problems which can Weed
war at any minute. The Liberal world
is asking us to come into a Council to
find the solution for these things. It is
not asking for soldiers, it is asking for
our economic and moral weight, our
idealism, and our disinterested sense of
justice. Are we willing to take the re
sponsibility that now rests on the souls
of those men in Europe wlio refused this
invitation in 1914?
DEIIHAPS the most ti nificant speech
ever delivered in t|e Stanford As
sembly Hall by any speaker, was that
of Herbert Hoover, '95, yesterday aft
ernoon. No man has been more looked
to by a greater number of people dur
ing the world war, than Mr. Hoover,
and on this account, his words spoken
yesterday concerning the future peace
of the world will 1 e barkened to Ly
all nations. Stanford was indeed
honored by Mr. Hoover when he chose
his Alma Mater as the most fitting
place in which to give the firs' public
expressi jn of those views which the
entire world has been waiting to hear.
In light of the stormy debate which
has been going on in the United
States Senate, and the tours made by
President Wilson and Senator John
son, Mr. Hoover made several signi
ficant points. The fact that he ap
proved the debate that has swept the
country because it brought the prob
lems of the League of Nations so
effectively before the people of this
country, came somewhat as a surprise.
"This debate is laying the foundation
to the league," he said.
In reply to the much repeated argu
ment of the Republican leaders, Mr.
Soover stated that he did not believe
tluJl the Un'ted States would evei be
forced into a world war without the
unanimous vote of its own leaders.

In other words the League of Nations
.cannot force any nation into war with
out the consent of that nation.
The complete tevt of Hoover's great
speech follows:
1 have been urged by Mr. Taft and
others to state at some greater length
my views on the peace treaty, and I
take this occasion to present them to
my own townspeople. During the ten
months between the armistice and har
vest I acted as the economic director
for the Supreme War Council. I was
necessarily in intimate contact witli the
political and economic situation all
over Europe. I was not one of the
American Peace delegates, but the pur
pose of my office was to act on behalf
of the United States and the Peace
Conference in an effort to save life and
prevent anarchy while the peace was
negotiated. I therefore had an advan
tageous position to independently ob
serve the growth of ideas in the Con
ference and the re-percussions of these
ideas through Europe.
I am not of those who have an im
patience of honest debate. 1 believe
that the debate of the League of Na
tions going on in the United States is
building tlic very foundations of the
League. It is bringing home to every
household in the country the necessity
and possibility of providing for our own
safety and of providing for the safety
of the world as a whole without great
armies or navies. Nor do I believe in
the criticism of the Senate for not ac
cepting out of hand this document so
laboriously evolved by five hundred con
flicting minds in Paris. It is a funda
mental part of our institutions that the
Senate shall scrutinize these matters.
Consideration and debate by the Senate
is not trahorship.
Nor were those Americans traitors
who. in representing us in Paris, fought
for every inch of hope that the weak
could be protected and the strong
curbed, that the United States could it
self be protected. Tf they were traitors
to their country it was because they were
wrong in assuming that the American
people wished an effort made to destroy
the seeds of war and thus to secure the
growth of liberty.
The treaty finally reached at Paris is
by no means perfect. I see no method
by which it could have been made per
fect when five hundred men, represent
ing twenty-three different nationalities,
were engaged in its negotiations, and
agreement had to be unanimous. Diff
ence in national character and in national
aspirations could but cause much dif
ference in views. Many of them repre
sented desperate, passionate or selfish ob
jects, some were dominated by political
ideals of the last century, yet the most
were actuated by the prayers of the com
mon people, who really fought this war,
that it should be the last war. There ex
isted in the world before this Conference
scores of those major international
wrongs which breed war. Of these the
Peace Conference corrected some, but it
will take perhaps a hundred years for
the men of good will to correct them all.
It is often overlooked that this was not
a conference to settle wrongs committed
by Allies and neutrals, but by the enemy
only. It was German wrongs that were
on the operating table. It would have
been beautiful to have all the interna
tional wrongs on the table, but this is not
a perfect world. As a practical fact, if
this had been attempted, the Conference
would have broken up !n quarrels among
the Allies, and Germany would have been
handed again the domination of Europe.
The old guard in Germany hoped and
expected that this would result; up to
date at least they have been disappointed.
No one could be more disappointed than
the American delegation that some great
wrongs that were the result of the secret
treaties that had been written in times of
complete desperation amongst the origi
nal allies were not eradicated at the Con
ference. In this the American group
were a minority of one, endeavoring to
secure that right should be done, in a
meeting that required unanimous agree
ment. There are many other items in

the treaty which men of good will would
have liked to see different. Our dele
gation could have found cause to with
draw from the Conference on many
scores. We would have been withdraw
ing in the face of the enemy, and Ger
many, by this division of the Allies,
would have been victorious.
Greater things were accomplished by
this Conference than by any other in
history. The military oligarchys of Ger
many, Austria, and Turkey were dis
solved, and if peace is ratified in time
they will be disarmed, and thus a para
mount menace to us and the world will
be destroyed. The Poles, the Czechs,
the Finns, the Croats, and the Slovenes
and Slovacks, the Baltic States, Arme
nians, Arabs have, or will, subject to
ratification, secure their liberty. Par
cels of French, Italians, Roumanians,
Serbians, Greeks have been rejoined to
their mother countries. Representative
democratic governments were set up on
the liberated and enemy states. Meth
ods were devised by which these people
would be free from economic domina
tion and by which the Germans and
their allies would be made to pay some
thing on account of the terrible destruc
tion they have wrought as a lesson to
militarism.
The men of liberal vision at the Con
ference were steadfast for certain domi
nant ideals that mark this conference
apait from all others. First, that this
settlement should remove as many of the
immediate causes of war as possible by
destroying enemy domination over other
races. Second, by establishing the new
governments on a democratic basis so
that wars should not be made by auto
that wars should not be made by autoc
racies for the profit of their class.
Third, that there should be established a
world council—the League. Here these
newly liberated peoples could lind some
measure of protection from invasion.
Here, with the stimulation of the world
conscience awakened by this war, there
could be no hope that the wrongs among
other peoples could be brought for dis
cussion and negotiation. Here, if ag
gression were undertaken, the public
opinion of the world could be enlight
ened and the aggressor could be made
an outcast from the society of the civ
ilized nations. Thus only could some
thing constructive be done to end war.
This is an aspiration which has been
rising in the hearts of all the world.
It has become an insistence in the
minds of all those in the world to

whom the lives of our sons are precious,
to all those to whom civilization is a
tiling to be safeguarded, and all those
who see no hope for the amelioration
of the misery of those who toil if peace
cannot be maintained.
Jo form a League of Nations for this
purpose has been proposed by the leaders
of both our great parties time and
again. It has been proposed by lead
ing spirits in all civilized nations. It
belongs to no one man, it comes from
the heart and mind of the world.
1 haye always regarded it a mistake
that this was termed "League," for the
term smacks of military alliance. It
is, in fact, a council of nations that re
quires in all important matters unani
mous decision.
'1 he major provisions of this council
look toward disarmament and provision
of place ind time, for negotiation and
arbitration of quarrels. Its most potent
weapon is the determination of rights
and wrongs of international quarrels
and the enlightenment of the world
upon them and thus the moral isolation
of the aggressor. If this fails, its sec
ond weapon is the boycott, the most
potent force in the world to-day—the
force that more than any other brought
Germany to her knees. It agrees that
military force can be used in defense
against invasion of one country by an
other, but in this, as in other important
things, unanimous consent is required,
and consent must mean the United
States Congress on our side. From my
own experience, 1 believe that the dis
cussion, negotiation, arbitration, enlight
enment of public opinion and thus the
moral definition of an outcast will be
all-sufficient, coupled with the knowl
edge that other wcapous exist. The hope
that I, as an independent observer, have
placed in the League was that it would
forever relieve the United States of the
necessity to again send a single soldier
outside of our boundaries.
The opponents of the League are of
many conflicting minds. There are those
who truly wish this experiment in the
promotion and preservation of human
liberty to be tried; tTTey, however, wish
the details altered and have fears that
the details agreed upon may themselves
involve us in war. Others believe that
the interest of the United States lies in
keeping out of all international action.
Others believe that the old game of arms
is the best promoter of civilization; still
others oppose it from disappointment
that all the ills of the world were not

corrected at this one session of the na
tion. But few of tliem acknowledge that
this terrible upheaval and its aftermath
of conflicting economic, social, and politi
cal forces lias endangered the stability
of the world for years to come.
Those who formulated the League did
not expect that it would furnish an over
night solution to all uncorrected inter
national wrongs or the disruption of
the.se unloosened forces. They did ex
pect that by degrees ttiere would be a
definite alignment of opinion in the
world that would make these wrongs
less and that could in great measure
restrain the actual outbreaks of war, that
could give the world time to heal its
wounds. Even the Sermon on the
Mount did not wholly regenerate the
world.
We-hear the cry that the League obli
gates that our sons be sent to tight in
foreign lands. Yet the very intent and
structure of the League is to prevent
war. There is no obligation for the

United States to engage in military op
erations or to allow any interference
with our internal affairs without the full
consent of our representatives in the
League. If there is any danger that we
should be charged with an obligation to
go to war, either direct or implied, with
out the full consent and approval of
Congress, I believe the President will be
the first to agree to any interpretation
that this cannot be. The French govern
ment so far takes this view that it has
requested from us a separate military
guaranty for themselves.
The League is founded expressly in
the attempt to secure the pacific settle
ment of these questions without military
force. To me, every line of it is the
complete negation of militarism. Dur
ing the course of negotiations in Paris
one fact stood out with regard to the
League. Its opposition there arose en
tirely from the old militaristic regimes,
and from the reactionaries of the world
in general. They saw in it trulv the
undermining of militarism. They had
the vision to see. and even to openly
state, that it would mean the ultimate
abandonment of military force in the
world, for thev. as of old, contend that
without military exercise there is no hope
of the maintenance of human efficiency
or control of the masses. What they
foresaw has already happened in a great
military nation like the British, where
the population, broken under a load of
taxation, is responding quickly to the new
possibility of international safety with
out the burden of gigantic naval arma
ment. The reactionaries saw that under
the hope for the protection of the League
of Nations there would be a growing op
position to the burden of armament from
all those who labor with hand and mind.
It is the workers of the world who
pay the price of war, not alone in the
support of arms but in blood and in the
support to tyranny which armies mean in
peace.
All wars have hitherto been settled on
the basis of trying to create a balance of
military strength by intriguing peoples j
into various groups oT equal military j
weight—the balance of power. Tt would
have been impossible to give liberty to j
the score of new nations of militarily I
weak yet liberty-loving people without!
the League to safeguard them from in
vasion. Beyond this, every attempt to
set up this balance hitherto has ultimately
crashed in war, for its essence is militar
ism. The creation of the League brought I
new hopes into the peace, and if the
League fails these new liberated nations
must fall, for the world must readjust
itself into the balance of power, and great
wars will re-open at once in this re
alignment. In a recent visit to many of
the capitals of the new states, the first
anxious question of their officials was,
"Will America ratify the League?" Their
invariable answer was that without it
their only course was the hopeless effort
to arm themselves against stronger neigh
bors; to do it in the midst of misery;
to endeavor to set up groups and military
alliances with all the old treadmill of
oppression of arms and ultimate war.
There are many elements in Europe
who wish to see the treaty break down
and the League of Nations disappear.
For instance, during the last five months
our Allies have been growing weaker
from a military point of view, due to the
necessity of demobilizing their armies,
while at the same time the reactionary
group in Germany has been growing in
strength through the recreation of hopes
of yet securing a division of the Allies.
At the time I left Europe a month ago,
German militarism had already re-estab
lished itself as a well-disciplined, well
officered army of at least 400,000 men,
largely congregated on the Polish fron
tier and even defying the government at
Berlin. Under the alarm of this danger,
the Poles, in the midst of the greatest
economic misery that a nation ever knew,
have been trying to create an army of
500,000 men for their protection from the
Germans on one side and the Bolsheviks
on the other. If the treaty is ratified the
German army will be reduced to 200,000
men and dispersed over Germany, and
their extra armament destroyed. The
failure of the treaty means the invasion
of the Polish state. This is only one of
the powder magazines in Europe which
cannot be destroyed *mtil this treaty is
ratified, and during every day of delay
more explosives are poured into them.
For good or ill, the entire treaty was
constructed around this central theme of
a League of Nations to prevent war. A
score of provisions in tTie treaty and out
side the covenant necessitate its erec
tion. To avoid causes of war, the
League has been made the trustee to
secure outlets to the sea, to secure free
ports to inland peoples, to settle deferred
disputes which could not otherwise hope
for solution without dangerous friction.
The treaties themselves cannot be car
ried out without the League. If the
League falls the treaties also fall.
The boundaries of these new states
cannot precisely include all their own
nationals, for the borders are lined with
racial islands and friction. Peace and
a moderating council are required for
readjustments. Their outlets to sea by
rail, canal, and viver are through other
states; their whole political and economic
situation demands peace for the growth
of order and the prevention of anarchy.
If the balance of power has to supplant
the League of Nations we will have
torn asunder the only hope that Europe
will not break into further wars of races,
classes, and groups that will take her
civilization back to the Middle Ages. I
am convinced that if we attempt now
to revise the treaty we shall tread a road
through European chaos. Even if we
managed to keep our soldiers out of it
we will not scape fearful economic
losses.
If the League is to break down we
must at once prepare to fight. Few
people seem to realize the desperation to
which Europe has been reduced. During
the coming winter son.c of them will look
with longing eyes on this rich, fat na
tion, possessing great surpluses of every
human necessity, wh/fe they endure in
evitable hunger and cold. At the same
time the energy of our population is sup
planting them in places where their mer
chants expect to market their goods and
operate their ships. Others of them will
he plunged into war with their neighbors,
and we have already experienced the diffi
culty of maintaining neutrality with self
respect and safety. We cannot fiddle
while Rome burns.
The Allies may themselves ratify this
treaty without us, and thus assemble a
Council of Nations of their own in an
endeavor to solve the problem of Europe.
It would be a Council of Europe, and in
the midst of these terrible times, with the
debts they owe to us, the material they
must have from us or starve, I would
rather be represented therein lest it be
come a League of Europe against the
Western Hemisphere. A peace without
us means more army and navy for us,
with the old treadmill of taxes and
dangers.
It is true we are not loved by certain
classes of people, some of them among
our former allies. It is untrue, however,
to say that the masses of any nation now
hate us. It is still more untrue to say
that the newly liberated peoples look to
us with other than conviction that our
moral leadership is their only hope. We
are not loved by any military class,
whether in the allied or enemy countries.
()ur whole object has been to destroy
their calling, to undermine their class.
! lie great masses of burdened working
people, however, look for us to support
this one hope of relief from domination

ideals of the last century, yet the most
were actuated by the prayers of the com
mon people, who really fought this war,
that it should be the last war. There ex
isted in the world before this Conference
scores of those major international
wrongs which breed war. Of these the
Peace Conference corrected some, but it
will take perhaps a hundred years for
the men of good will to correct them all.
It is often overlooked that this was not
a conference to settle wrongs committed
by Allies and neutrals, but by the enemy
only. It was German wrongs that were
on the operating table. It would have
been beautiful to have all the interna
tional wrongs on the table, but this is not
a perfect world. As a practical fact, if
this had been attempted, the Conference
would have broken up !n quarrels among
the Allies, and Germany would have been
handed again the domination of Europe.
The old guard in Germany hoped and
expected that this would result; up to
date at least they have been disappointed.
No one could be more disappointed than
the American delegation that some great
wrongs that were the result of the secret
treaties that had been written in times of
complete desperation amongst the origi
nal allies were not eradicated at the Con
ference. In this the American group
were a minority of one, endeavoring to
secure that right should be done, in a
meeting that required unanimous agree
ment. There are many other items in

the treaty which men of good will would
have liked to see different. Our dele
gation could have found cause to with
draw from the Conference on many
scores. We would have been withdraw
ing in the face of the enemy, and Ger
many, by this division of the Allies,
would have been victorious.
Greater things were accomplished by
this Conference than by any other in
history. The military oligarchys of Ger
many, Austria, and Turkey were dis
solved, and if peace is ratified in time
they will be disarmed, and thus a para
mount menace to us and the world will
be destroyed. The Poles, the Czechs,
the Finns, the Croats, and the Slovenes
and Slovacks, the Baltic States, Arme
nians, Arabs have, or will, subject to
ratification, secure their liberty. Par
cels of French, Italians, Roumanians,
Serbians, Greeks have been rejoined to
their mother countries. Representative
democratic governments were set up on
the liberated and enemy states. Meth
ods were devised by which these people
would be free from economic domina
tion and by which the Germans and
their allies would be made to pay some
thing on account of the terrible destruc
tion they have wrought as a lesson to
militarism.
The men of liberal vision at the Con
ference were steadfast for certain domi
nant ideals that mark this conference
apait from all others. First, that this
settlement should remove as many of the
immediate causes of war as possible by
destroying enemy domination over other
races. Second, by establishing the new
governments on a democratic basis so
that wars should not be made by auto
that wars should not be made by autoc
racies for the profit of their class.
Third, that there should be established a
world council—the League. Here these
newly liberated peoples could lind some
measure of protection from invasion.
Here, with the stimulation of the world
conscience awakened by this war, there
could be no hope that the wrongs among
other peoples could be brought for dis
cussion and negotiation. Here, if ag
gression were undertaken, the public
opinion of the world could be enlight
ened and the aggressor could be made
an outcast from the society of the civ
ilized nations. Thus only could some
thing constructive be done to end war.
This is an aspiration which has been
rising in the hearts of all the world.
It has become an insistence in the
minds of all those in the world to

whom the lives of our sons are precious,
to all those to whom civilization is a
tiling to be safeguarded, and all those
who see no hope for the amelioration
of the misery of those who toil if peace
cannot be maintained.
Jo form a League of Nations for this
purpose has been proposed by the leaders
of both our great parties time and
again. It has been proposed by lead
ing spirits in all civilized nations. It
belongs to no one man, it comes from
the heart and mind of the world.
1 haye always regarded it a mistake
that this was termed "League," for the
term smacks of military alliance. It
is, in fact, a council of nations that re
quires in all important matters unani
mous decision.
'1 he major provisions of this council
look toward disarmament and provision
of place ind time, for negotiation and
arbitration of quarrels. Its most potent
weapon is the determination of rights
and wrongs of international quarrels
and the enlightenment of the world
upon them and thus the moral isolation
of the aggressor. If this fails, its sec
ond weapon is the boycott, the most
potent force in the world to-day—the
force that more than any other brought
Germany to her knees. It agrees that
military force can be used in defense
against invasion of one country by an
other, but in this, as in other important
things, unanimous consent is required,
and consent must mean the United
States Congress on our side. From my
own experience, 1 believe that the dis
cussion, negotiation, arbitration, enlight
enment of public opinion and thus the
moral definition of an outcast will be
all-sufficient, coupled with the knowl
edge that other wcapous exist. The hope
that I, as an independent observer, have
placed in the League was that it would
forever relieve the United States of the
necessity to again send a single soldier
outside of our boundaries.
The opponents of the League are of
many conflicting minds. There are those
who truly wish this experiment in the
promotion and preservation of human
liberty to be tried; tTTey, however, wish
the details altered and have fears that
the details agreed upon may themselves
involve us in war. Others believe that
the interest of the United States lies in
keeping out of all international action.
Others believe that the old game of arms
is the best promoter of civilization; still
others oppose it from disappointment
that all the ills of the world were not

corrected at this one session of the na
tion. But few of tliem acknowledge that
this terrible upheaval and its aftermath
of conflicting economic, social, and politi
cal forces lias endangered the stability
of the world for years to come.
Those who formulated the League did
not expect that it would furnish an over
night solution to all uncorrected inter
national wrongs or the disruption of
the.se unloosened forces. They did ex
pect that by degrees ttiere would be a
definite alignment of opinion in the
world that would make these wrongs
less and that could in great measure
restrain the actual outbreaks of war, that
could give the world time to heal its
wounds. Even the Sermon on the
Mount did not wholly regenerate the
world.
We-hear the cry that the League obli
gates that our sons be sent to tight in
foreign lands. Yet the very intent and
structure of the League is to prevent
war. There is no obligation for the

United States to engage in military op
erations or to allow any interference
with our internal affairs without the full
consent of our representatives in the
League. If there is any danger that we
should be charged with an obligation to
go to war, either direct or implied, with
out the full consent and approval of
Congress, I believe the President will be
the first to agree to any interpretation
that this cannot be. The French govern
ment so far takes this view that it has
requested from us a separate military
guaranty for themselves.
The League is founded expressly in
the attempt to secure the pacific settle
ment of these questions without military
force. To me, every line of it is the
complete negation of militarism. Dur
ing the course of negotiations in Paris
one fact stood out with regard to the
League. Its opposition there arose en
tirely from the old militaristic regimes,
and from the reactionaries of the world
in general. They saw in it trulv the
undermining of militarism. They had
the vision to see. and even to openly
state, that it would mean the ultimate
abandonment of military force in the
world, for thev. as of old, contend that
without military exercise there is no hope
of the maintenance of human efficiency
or control of the masses. What they
foresaw has already happened in a great
military nation like the British, where
the population, broken under a load of
taxation, is responding quickly to the new
possibility of international safety with
out the burden of gigantic naval arma
ment. The reactionaries saw that under
the hope for the protection of the League
of Nations there would be a growing op
position to the burden of armament from
all those who labor with hand and mind.
It is the workers of the world who
pay the price of war, not alone in the
support of arms but in blood and in the
support to tyranny which armies mean in
peace.
All wars have hitherto been settled on
the basis of trying to create a balance of
military strength by intriguing peoples j
into various groups oT equal military j
weight—the balance of power. Tt would
have been impossible to give liberty to j
the score of new nations of militarily I
weak yet liberty-loving people without!
the League to safeguard them from in
vasion. Beyond this, every attempt to
set up this balance hitherto has ultimately
crashed in war, for its essence is militar
ism. The creation of the League brought I
new hopes into the peace, and if the
League fails these new liberated nations
must fall, for the world must readjust
itself into the balance of power, and great
wars will re-open at once in this re
alignment. In a recent visit to many of
the capitals of the new states, the first
anxious question of their officials was,
"Will America ratify the League?" Their
invariable answer was that without it
their only course was the hopeless effort
to arm themselves against stronger neigh
bors; to do it in the midst of misery;
to endeavor to set up groups and military
alliances with all the old treadmill of
oppression of arms and ultimate war.
There are many elements in Europe
who wish to see the treaty break down
and the League of Nations disappear.
For instance, during the last five months
our Allies have been growing weaker
from a military point of view, due to the
necessity of demobilizing their armies,
while at the same time the reactionary
group in Germany has been growing in
strength through the recreation of hopes
of yet securing a division of the Allies.
At the time I left Europe a month ago,
German militarism had already re-estab
lished itself as a well-disciplined, well
officered army of at least 400,000 men,
largely congregated on the Polish fron
tier and even defying the government at
Berlin. Under the alarm of this danger,
the Poles, in the midst of the greatest
economic misery that a nation ever knew,
have been trying to create an army of
500,000 men for their protection from the
Germans on one side and the Bolsheviks
on the other. If the treaty is ratified the
German army will be reduced to 200,000
men and dispersed over Germany, and
their extra armament destroyed. The
failure of the treaty means the invasion
of the Polish state. This is only one of
the powder magazines in Europe which
cannot be destroyed *mtil this treaty is
ratified, and during every day of delay
more explosives are poured into them.
For good or ill, the entire treaty was
constructed around this central theme of
a League of Nations to prevent war. A
score of provisions in tTie treaty and out
side the covenant necessitate its erec
tion. To avoid causes of war, the
League has been made the trustee to
secure outlets to the sea, to secure free
ports to inland peoples, to settle deferred
disputes which could not otherwise hope
for solution without dangerous friction.
The treaties themselves cannot be car
ried out without the League. If the
League falls the treaties also fall.
The boundaries of these new states
cannot precisely include all their own
nationals, for the borders are lined with
racial islands and friction. Peace and
a moderating council are required for
readjustments. Their outlets to sea by
rail, canal, and viver are through other
states; their whole political and economic
situation demands peace for the growth
of order and the prevention of anarchy.
If the balance of power has to supplant
the League of Nations we will have
torn asunder the only hope that Europe
will not break into further wars of races,
classes, and groups that will take her
civilization back to the Middle Ages. I
am convinced that if we attempt now
to revise the treaty we shall tread a road
through European chaos. Even if we
managed to keep our soldiers out of it
we will not scape fearful economic
losses.
If the League is to break down we
must at once prepare to fight. Few
people seem to realize the desperation to
which Europe has been reduced. During
the coming winter son.c of them will look
with longing eyes on this rich, fat na
tion, possessing great surpluses of every
human necessity, wh/fe they endure in
evitable hunger and cold. At the same
time the energy of our population is sup
planting them in places where their mer
chants expect to market their goods and
operate their ships. Others of them will
he plunged into war with their neighbors,
and we have already experienced the diffi
culty of maintaining neutrality with self
respect and safety. We cannot fiddle
while Rome burns.
The Allies may themselves ratify this
treaty without us, and thus assemble a
Council of Nations of their own in an
endeavor to solve the problem of Europe.
It would be a Council of Europe, and in
the midst of these terrible times, with the
debts they owe to us, the material they
must have from us or starve, I would
rather be represented therein lest it be
come a League of Europe against the
Western Hemisphere. A peace without
us means more army and navy for us,
with the old treadmill of taxes and
dangers.
It is true we are not loved by certain
classes of people, some of them among
our former allies. It is untrue, however,
to say that the masses of any nation now
hate us. It is still more untrue to say
that the newly liberated peoples look to
us with other than conviction that our
moral leadership is their only hope. We
are not loved by any military class,
whether in the allied or enemy countries.
()ur whole object has been to destroy
their calling, to undermine their class.
! lie great masses of burdened working
people, however, look for us to support
this one hope of relief from domination
from burdens and misery of arms and
war.
Neither the gospel of hate nor the
gospel of unpreparedness are the roads
to peace. The true road lies in every
effort to remove the causes of war, not
in tearing down such structure of peace
as we have, nor in blindness to present
dangers.
Those who think we can isolate our
selves seem to ignore the fact that mod
ern communication has shortened our
distance from our neighbors from a
month to an hour. A vast amount of
our civilization and the daily improve
ments of life that come to our people
are the products of the ideas and in
telligence and labor of our neighbors.
If we believe we can see our neighbors
return to thirty years' war through the
breakdown of this treaty and we still
maintain our progress, it is the egotism
of insanity. We arc an overseas people,
and we are dependent upon Europe for
marks for the surplus products of our
farmers and laborers. Without order in
Europe we will at best have business de
pression, unemployment, and all their
burden of troubles. With renewed dis
organization in Europe, social diseases
and anarchy thrive, and we are infected
with every social wind of Europe. We
are forced to interest ourselves in the
welfare of the world if we are to thrive.
There is no American who has spent the
last ten months in Europe who does not
pray that we should g*r out of entangle
ment in the sordid selfishness, the pas
sions, the misery of it. But our expan
sion overseas has entangled us for good
or ill, and I stand for an honest attempt
to join with Europe's better spirit to
prevent these entanglements from in
volving us in war. We are not dealing
with perfection; we are dealing with
the lesser of evils. These are reasons
of interest.
There are also reasons of idealism,
and true national interest lies along the
path of practical ideals, and there are
ideals in Europe. During the last hun
dred and fifty years a far larger pro
portion of our citizens liave grown far
ahead of those of Europe in outlook on
life, in disinterested sense of justice, in
sympathy with the downtrodden. It
was with the hope of ending war that
we went into it, and to fix it in inter
national law that dominated our repre
sentatives in the Peace Conference. We
have expended the lives of our sons
and an enormous portion of our wealth,
hoping to see these ends. For us to re
fuse to enter into a joint attempt with
the well-thinking sections of a large
part of the world to establish a contin
uing moral conscience against war is the
utmost folly in our own interest.
We have been the center and inspira
tion of democracy for a hundred years.
We have given sympathy and encour
agement to every aspiration for self-gov
ernment for all this time. We have from
our experience in its blessings believed
it made for peace and well-being. We
enjoy from it the highest standard of
living in the world. We went to Eu
rope with our best blood and our treas
ures and fought the attempt to impose
autocracy on the world. We won. We
imposed democracy all over Europe. We
set up a score of new democracies—and
they are many of them peoples of our
own blood—the Baltic, Polish, and Slav
races. Arc we to refuse our counsels to
these peoples now struggling to realize
our own ideals? Curious as it may seem,
this also embraces Germany itself. That
sincerely democratic group which to-day
controls Germany is losing ground lie
fore the old reactionary group who em
ploy tlu- hope of the failure of the league
to fan the renewed hope of domination.
I am one of those who hold that this
war would never have happened if the
nations of Europe had accepted the invi
tation of Sir Edward Gray to a confer
ence of civilians in July, 1914. I believe
that if the intelligence of the world can
be aggregated around a table, the pres
sures from the responsibility of these
men for the possible enormous loss of

life and the fabulous amount of human
misery created by their failure to pre
vent war, are such that no body of de
cent men in these times can fail to se
cure some sort of solution short of war.
We have now seen the most terrible five
years of history because the reaction
aries of Europe refused to come into a
room to discuss the welfare of humanity.
From this mightv political, social, and
economic upheaval there are a host of
outstanding problems which can Weed
war at any minute. The Liberal world
is asking us to come into a Council to
find the solution for these things. It is
not asking for soldiers, it is asking for
our economic and moral weight, our
idealism, and our disinterested sense of
justice. Are we willing to take the re
sponsibility that now rests on the souls
of those men in Europe wlio refused this
invitation in 1914?
