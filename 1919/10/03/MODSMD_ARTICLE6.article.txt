# Student Body to Give First Dance of College Year
## 
### 
Crowds of old students meeting each
other socially for the first time are ex
pected at the â€¢ studenthody dance to be
given in the Women's Clubhouse this
evening. Many new students are also
expected, despite the threats of the newly
pasted sophomore posters. Louis Liss
ner's orchestra will provide the music
for the dance.
Proceedings of the dance will go to
the treasury of the student body. The
dance, however, is being given primarily
as an opportunity for old and new stu
dents to meet socially. Most of the
receipts will be expended to make the
function as enjoyable an affair as possi
ble, in accordance with the policy of the
student body as defined at the first
meeting of the student council. An ad
mission of fifty-five cents will be charged.
