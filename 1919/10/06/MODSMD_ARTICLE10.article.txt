# "Y" RECEPTION WILL WELCOME '23 FRIDAY
## Intercollegiate Conference of Y.M.C.A. Delegates on Same Day 
### 
Next Friday evening has been definite
ly set aside as a closed date by the Stu
dent Council for the annual joint Y. M.-
Y. W. C. A. university reception which
is held each year for the purpose of get
ting the new students acquainted with
members of their own classes and with
the older students. The "Y" Social Com
mittee in charge of the event is working
out the details and plans to have a num
ber of new "stunts" as well as the usual
"feed."
The committee heads are Elizabeth
Patton, '21, for the Y. W. C. A., and H.
Hospian, '21, for the Y. M. C. A. A
large attendance is expected so that the
event will either be held at Encina or
the Men's Gymnasium. All freshmen
men and women are urged to be present
as this will be the first good opportunity
one another. Upper
invited to attend the
reception, detailed plans of which will
be announced next week.
The reception will in no way interfere
with the Y. M. C. A. Intercollegiate Con
ference which is also to be held next Fri
day, Saturday, and Sunday, as the dele
gates will hold their first meeting
promptly at 6:30 Friday evening and will
end the session in time for the "Y" lead
ers to go to the reception. Detailed plans
for the entertainment of the delegation,
which is composed of some sixty Y. M.
C. A. workers from the University of
California, the College of the Pacific,
and various Theological Seminaries
around the Bay, will be discussed and
definitely determined Monday evening at
the meeting of the Y. M. C. A. Cabinet.
The program and list of speakers, which
includes Dr. Wilbur and Gale Seamen,
the Secretary for the Western Division
of the "Y," will be published in the
Daily Palo Alto next week.
It is the plan of the Y. M. C. A. to

have frequent intercollegiate conferences
in the future as the work of the Asso
ciation is becoming of considerable im
portance in universities, and by concerted
action on the part of the "Y" heads in
each college it is hoped that greater
benefits and better results will be ob
tained.
The problem of employment for stu
dents working their way through college
is now being handled in most universi
ties, as it is here, almost entirely by the
Y. M. C. A. Stanford "Y" has filled
125 positions in the last three days. It is
a significant fact that whenever a "hash
er" is wanted it the Y. C. A. that
fills the position. At Stanford practi
cally all waiting table, gardening and
minor clerical positions are filled through
the Association's efforts. The result is
that a very considerable number of col
lege men have come to depend on the
Y. M. C. A. as a vital factor in their
university life, and the "Y" therefore
feels that every effort should be made to
facilitate its work.
By Intercollegiate Conferences the in
terchange of ideas and harmonious ac
tion resulting will make the Association
an increasing benefit to college men in
every university in this country.

"feed."
The committee heads are Elizabeth

Hospian, '21, for the Y. M. C. A. A
large attendance is expected so that the
event will either be held at Encina or
the Men's Gymnasium. All freshmen
men and women are urged to be present
as this will be the first good opportunity
one another. Upper
invited to attend the
reception, detailed plans of which will
be announced next week.
The reception will in no way interfere
with the Y. M. C. A. Intercollegiate Con
ference which is also to be held next Fri
day, Saturday, and Sunday, as the dele
gates will hold their first meeting
promptly at 6:30 Friday evening and will
end the session in time for the "Y" lead
ers to go to the reception. Detailed plans
for the entertainment of the delegation,
which is composed of some sixty Y. M.
C. A. workers from the University of
California, the College of the Pacific,
and various Theological Seminaries
around the Bay, will be discussed and
definitely determined Monday evening at
the meeting of the Y. M. C. A. Cabinet.
The program and list of speakers, which
includes Dr. Wilbur and Gale Seamen,
the Secretary for the Western Division
of the "Y," will be published in the
Daily Palo Alto next week.
It is the plan of the Y. M. C. A. to

have frequent intercollegiate conferences
in the future as the work of the Asso
ciation is becoming of considerable im
portance in universities, and by concerted
action on the part of the "Y" heads in
each college it is hoped that greater
benefits and better results will be ob
tained.
The problem of employment for stu
dents working their way through college
is now being handled in most universi
ties, as it is here, almost entirely by the
Y. M. C. A. Stanford "Y" has filled
125 positions in the last three days. It is
a significant fact that whenever a "hash
er" is wanted it the Y. C. A. that
fills the position. At Stanford practi
cally all waiting table, gardening and
minor clerical positions are filled through
the Association's efforts. The result is
that a very considerable number of col
lege men have come to depend on the
Y. M. C. A. as a vital factor in their
university life, and the "Y" therefore
feels that every effort should be made to
facilitate its work.
By Intercollegiate Conferences the in
terchange of ideas and harmonious ac
tion resulting will make the Association
an increasing benefit to college men in
every university in this country.
Next Friday evening has been definite
ly set aside as a closed date by the Stu
dent Council for the annual joint Y. M.-
Y. W. C. A. university reception which
is held each year for the purpose of get
ting the new students acquainted with
members of their own classes and with
the older students. The "Y" Social Com
mittee in charge of the event is working
