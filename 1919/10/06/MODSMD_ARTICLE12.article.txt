### 
The llrst lecture of the Tuesday even
ing series will be given in the Little
Theatre, tomorrow at 7:30 o'clock by
Professor Payson J. Treat of the His
tory department. The subject is an
nounced as "The Shantung Issue."
In presenting this lecture at this time,
the Committee on Public Exercises has
sought to have the facts in one of the
great disputes over the peace treaty
placed before a Stanford audicnce. It
is expected that the Shantung amend
ment to the treaty will be voted upon
in the Senate some time this week.
As Professor Treat has made a spe

cial study of Far Eastern history for
a number of years, he will doubtless de
vote some. time to the historical LaJ
ground of the present dispute. He will
not merely consider the part played by
Germany in China, but also the acts
of other European powers which have
complicated the present situation. Simi
larly, Chinese-Japanese relations over a
considerable period will be better under
stood, for the events of the past five
years have developed out of earlier con
ditions.
The discussions at the peace confer
ence and the status of the question will
also be touched upon.
