# Cincinnati Again Humbles Sox
## 
### 
Cincinnati won the fifth game of the
World's Series from the Chicago White
Sox today, by the score of 5 to 0. The
series now stands four games to one
in favor of the Reds. Eller's pitching
was a complete puzzle to the Chicago
batters. He held them down to three
hits scattered through as many in
ings, and struck out nine men. Eller
also helped his team to score part
of the four runs in the sixth inning
which won the game for the National
league champions.

Williams, Gleason's choice as pitch
er for Chicago, pitched a good game,
allowing only four hits. He was
slightly wild, however, which helped
the Reds to get into the lead. Cin
cinnati scored four runs in the sixth
and one in the ninth.
The score:
R H B
Cincinnati 5 4 0
Chicago 4 3 3
Batteriesâ€”Eller and Rariden; Wil
liams and Schalk.
