# I GIVE THE COLLEGE MAN A PLACE

ITNDER the title, "Why Not a League of Colleges?" published in the
Illustrated Review, Walter I. Ames, '19, Student Manager of Stanford,
brings forward an idea that is worthy of not only interest, but serious con
sideration by all college men and women. Ames expresses the desire that
the college students do something to change the rapidly increasing concep
tion of the university men —"bull dog, pipe, and rah! rah!!" —and suggests
that the colleges of the Pacific Coast join in a conference or league to dis
cuss the real issues that the college men are required to face every day. The
suggestion is an excellent one, and much more could come from it, than is
apparent at first glance. If the other colleges can be aroused to the fact
that the college men of today are being shunted aside by the business men,
that many of the very traditions that the universities cling to are not in
keeping with the times, that the popular novelist's picture of the collegiate
is the one that most people think of, and that something will have to be
done very soon to change this, a League can be formed that will be an
important factor in the rejuvenation of the college man.
Why not ask every college on the Pacific Coast and those of Idaho, Utah,
and Nevada to send from three to five delegates to a conference to be held
at one of the largest hotels in San Francisco? Be sure that these delegates
are the biggest men in their respective institutions, and that they represent
a majority of the various factions of a college community. Dispense with
everything that flavors of what is popularly called the "rah, rah, stuff," and
meeting in a dignified session at which the first speaker could be the Gov
ernor of the State of California, discuss ways and means to better each insti
tution locally, and to raise the position of the college men in general. A
meeting of this sort would be a new thing, it would attract wide publicity,
and would draw attention from men of prominence. Make it a semi-annual
gathering, and there is no estimating the benefits that would be derived from
the exchanges of ideas. Ames has a big idea behind his article, and it is
hoped that he will follow it up with a constructive plan of his own, and that
Stanford will be the leading spirit in this League of Colleges which can
accomplish so much.

ITNDER the title, "Why Not a League of Colleges?" published in the
Illustrated Review, Walter I. Ames, '19, Student Manager of Stanford,
brings forward an idea that is worthy of not only interest, but serious con
sideration by all college men and women. Ames expresses the desire that
the college students do something to change the rapidly increasing concep
tion of the university men —"bull dog, pipe, and rah! rah!!" —and suggests
that the colleges of the Pacific Coast join in a conference or league to dis
cuss the real issues that the college men are required to face every day. The
suggestion is an excellent one, and much more could come from it, than is
apparent at first glance. If the other colleges can be aroused to the fact
that the college men of today are being shunted aside by the business men,
that many of the very traditions that the universities cling to are not in
keeping with the times, that the popular novelist's picture of the collegiate
is the one that most people think of, and that something will have to be
done very soon to change this, a League can be formed that will be an
important factor in the rejuvenation of the college man.
Why not ask every college on the Pacific Coast and those of Idaho, Utah,
and Nevada to send from three to five delegates to a conference to be held
at one of the largest hotels in San Francisco? Be sure that these delegates
are the biggest men in their respective institutions, and that they represent
a majority of the various factions of a college community. Dispense with
everything that flavors of what is popularly called the "rah, rah, stuff," and
meeting in a dignified session at which the first speaker could be the Gov
ernor of the State of California, discuss ways and means to better each insti
tution locally, and to raise the position of the college men in general. A
meeting of this sort would be a new thing, it would attract wide publicity,
and would draw attention from men of prominence. Make it a semi-annual
gathering, and there is no estimating the benefits that would be derived from
the exchanges of ideas. Ames has a big idea behind his article, and it is
hoped that he will follow it up with a constructive plan of his own, and that
Stanford will be the leading spirit in this League of Colleges which can
accomplish so much.
