# SOPHOMORES EASILY TAKE ANNUAL FIGHT FROM 1923 CLASS
## 
### 
With apparently very little effort the
sophomores were able to tie up their
freshmen antagonists in the 1922-1923
class rush in quick enough succession to
win the annual struggle before a large
audience at the football bleachers Satur
day afternoon.
The outstanding feature of the con
test was the small number of freshmen in
attendance. Expecting to face an organi
zation of probably twice their size the
1922 men found that their opponents
barely equaled their o-.vn number. There
was little doubt as to the decision at the
end of the half-hour period.
According to the varsity "S" men in
charge, a clean contest was staged all
the way through with one or two excep
tions.
