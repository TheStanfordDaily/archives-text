# California Bear Made Captive by Stanford Men
## 
### 
California's golden bear got tired of
its long captivity on the Berkeley cam
pus last night and with the assistance
of several Stanford men broke out of its
cage under the California track bleach
ers and wandered down to the "Farm."
Once here, Bruin got a warm reception
and was immediately tied up.
After receiving a new coating, con
sisting of Cardinal stripes, Bruin will
be put away for safe-keeping and used
as a jazz raiser at the fall football rallies.
The golden bear has long been a
familiar figure around the Blue and
Gold campus and has made periodical
appearances at the California rallies and
intercollegiate football games. Its ap
pearance was always the occasion for
the California yell leaders to call on the
rooters for the famous Bear yell.
This article is published as a news
item. Its publication docs not signify
that the Dailp Palo Alto is in sympathy
with the men who perpetrated this viola
tion of the agreement between the two
universities that nothing should be re
moved from either campus by members
of the other university. The bear will
he returned to California.
