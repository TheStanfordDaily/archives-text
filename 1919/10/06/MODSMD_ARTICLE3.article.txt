# BABES HOLD WORK-OUTS
## 
### 
Coach Evans, the fighting mentor of
the varsity squad, has issued the call
for real live material for the freshman
football team. As the first game of the
season is to be played the 18th of this
month, a big turnout for the class team
is expected
Although equipment is scarce, Coach
Acker of the Babes announced that he
would have the toggery 011 hand for ex
perienced men, even if some who have
had no experience have to give in theirs.
All men who have been equipped and
have not reported for practice must do
so at once. With the proper turnout the
freshman team this year should be able
to make a strong showing against their
California opponents.
Coach Acker is ready to handle the

men in tiptop shape and expects a real
turnout of material as a nucleus for a
winning team to pit against the Bruin
Babes.

the freshman schedule by Student
