# COOVER BACK FROM WORK IN THE ARMY PSYCHOLOGY FIELD
## 
### 
Captain J. E. Coover, who was con
nected with the Psychology department
of Stanford from 1912 until the time
of his enlistment, has returned to the
campus and is once more engaged in
psychological instruction and psychical
research in the University.
While in the army, Captain Coover
was located at the Medical Research
Laboraory, Hazelhurst Field, Minisea,
Long Island, New York. He was en
gaged in psychological work in connec
tion with military aeronautics.
The laboratory at Hazelhurst Field
is the military headquarters for psycho
logical research in the United States.
One of the chief contributions of the
laboratory is the standard test for
tolerance to oxygen-wants, on the basis
of which aviators are classified with
respect to the altitude at which they
may safely work without an extra
oxygen supply.
An investigation of the classification
of aviators was assigned to Captain
Coover in order to learn the reliability
of classification, the disturbing influences
upon the rating, the effect of the psy
chological examiner's "personal equa
tion," and the possible improvements in
either procedure in giving the test or in
manner of rating the subject.
Captain Coover worked in collabora
tion with other psychologists on re
searches, the reports of which arc to be
published from the laboratory.
