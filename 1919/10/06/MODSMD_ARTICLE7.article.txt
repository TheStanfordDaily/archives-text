# WOHLFORD ELECTED TO PILOT CHAPARRAL FOR 1919-20
## RETURNED FROM SERVICE Was Elected Editor for 1917 Chappie But Went Overseas 
### 
At a business meeting held last
Wednesday, the Hammer and Coffin
Society elected B. C. Wohlford editor
and E. R. Martin manager of Chaparral
for the present year. Wohlford, who
left the editorship in 1917 to join the
ambulance, replaces Sam Glikbarg, who
decided during the summer to leave for
Harvard. Ed Martin was manager in
1916-17-18.
Regardless of returned old-timers and
the regular staff, Chappie is on the look
out for new material in both the dope
and art departments, and urges anyone
who has the slightest conception of
humor or can draw fairly straight lines
on a blackboard to ship along his ideas
to the Chaparral or, better, to come over
to Room 400 Encina and talk with the
editor. Chappie had some mighty good
dope from the co-ed element in the
past, and hopes his rather disreputable
appearance won't frighten any of these
if humorously inclined.
