# No More Tubs At Encina; Tubbing Gets Sad Blow
## 
### 
It has been the yearly custom for
freshmen to be "tubbed" at the old ren
dezvous at Encina Hall, for various
breeches of official and unofficial eti
quette. It also has been customary for
the announcement to be made each year,
coming from the vague direction of fac
ulty headquarters, that "tubbing" is
strictly against Hoyle, as interpreted by
the faculty.
This year an unusual silence has en
veloped the subject. No Phillipics
against the water-cure, no dire threats
against the sophomores and others who
are accustomed to administer it. All the
tubs have been removed at Encina. In
stead of threats, action has followed.
The coup was accomplished while cer
tain alterations were being made, and
when they were finished, the tubs were
a thing of the past.
Unless some method is discovered by
which victims can be disciplined under a
shower, the "tubbing" days at Encina
Hall are a thing of the past.
