# ASSEMBLY HEARS PLANS FOR STUDENT CONTROL
## Speakers Outline Work That is Already Done by Committee 
### 
Plans for student control were laid
before the students of the University
by R. L. King, '18, today at one of the
most successful student assemblies ever
held on the campus. Mrs. Herbert
Hoover was called from the audience
to start the assembly, and after a few
words of enthusiastic support Mrs.
Hoover was followed by W. I. Ames,
student body manager, Miss Ruth Searcy,
'20, N. H. Petree, editor of the Daily
Palo Alto, and R. L. King as speakers.
In explaining the plans and the cir
cumstances affecting student control,
King stated that those men who had
been working on the problem during
the summer had finally evolved a plan
whereby about ninety per cent of the
men of the University would be reached.
Schedules have been worked out for
intergroup games, and a suitable system
of rewards for athletic work has been
worked out. The interfraternity confer
ence has been organized for the pro
tection of the houses and the freshmen.
"Then came the question," said King,
"Do we want student control?" The
answer was unanimously in favor. The
second question was, "What kind?" and
the answer was, "Not pure student con
trol." The student body president went
on to explain that from experience in
the past it was found to be necessary to
find some balance between students and
faculty in order to insure the success of
any system which might eventually be
adopted. The general attitude of the
University on important student ques
tions has been placed in the hands of
the senior class.
"There are a few cases, however,"
said King, "which unfortunately cannot
be handled by members of the senior
class. To handle such affairs a disci
plinary council of five men will be
clected from the senior class. However,
student control sometime in the future
may slide, and if it should fail again
the faculty would be justified in keeping
away from student control for all tune.
"The President of the University is
unquestionably the final authority in
disciplinary action. Therefore, the coun
cil will try the case and make a recom
mendation to the President as to wnal
the final action should be. The Presi
dent will either approve or disapprove
the action taken and the council will
act accordingly. In this way the bal
ance between the faculty and the stu
dents is maintained."
King then announced the names of a
committee, of which C. E. Righter, '19,
is chairman, which is to meet Tuesday
night at seven o'clock in the Union to
consider the final plan for student con
trol. Suggestions are wanted, but all
recommendations must be made in
writing.
W. I. Ames explained the prospect
for the coming year in finances and
athletics. He reviewed a little of the
past history of the finances of the stu
dent body and explained why the
Board of Athletic Control was created.
In speaking of the big game with Cali
fornia, Ames said that he thought the
opportunity for the University to make
a creditable showing had come.
"Get into the spirit of athletics," said
\mes," because until you do you will
not eet into the spirit of Stanford."
Miss Ruth Searcy, '20, reviewed the
part that women of the University were
desirous of playing in student affairs
this year. She urged that women turn
out for athletics as well as all the other
activities on the campus.
N. H. Petree outlined the journalistic
activities on the campus and pointed out
the opportunities which the men and
the women on the campus had in sup
porting these activities. In speakinc of
the Daily Palo Alto, Petree said: "The
Dpi'v Palo Alto is owned and con
trolled by you. Its viewpoint should
tie your viewpoint and its interests
should be your interests." Petree went
on to explain how the Illustrated Re
view had partially returned to the stu
dents again after the period of the war
and at the present time hoped to estab
lish the connecting link between the
alumni and the students.

Hoover was followed by W. I. Ames,
student body manager, Miss Ruth Searcy,
'20, N. H. Petree, editor of the Daily
Palo Alto, and R. L. King as speakers.
In explaining the plans and the cir
cumstances affecting student control,
King stated that those men who had
been working on the problem during
the summer had finally evolved a plan
whereby about ninety per cent of the
men of the University would be reached.
Schedules have been worked out for
intergroup games, and a suitable system
of rewards for athletic work has been
worked out. The interfraternity confer
ence has been organized for the pro
tection of the houses and the freshmen.
"Then came the question," said King,
"Do we want student control?" The
answer was unanimously in favor. The
second question was, "What kind?" and
the answer was, "Not pure student con
trol." The student body president went
on to explain that from experience in
the past it was found to be necessary to
find some balance between students and
faculty in order to insure the success of
any system which might eventually be
adopted. The general attitude of the
University on important student ques
tions has been placed in the hands of
the senior class.
"There are a few cases, however,"
said King, "which unfortunately cannot
be handled by members of the senior
class. To handle such affairs a disci
plinary council of five men will be
clected from the senior class. However,
student control sometime in the future
may slide, and if it should fail again
the faculty would be justified in keeping
away from student control for all tune.
"The President of the University is
unquestionably the final authority in
disciplinary action. Therefore, the coun
cil will try the case and make a recom
mendation to the President as to wnal
the final action should be. The Presi
dent will either approve or disapprove
the action taken and the council will
act accordingly. In this way the bal
ance between the faculty and the stu
dents is maintained."
King then announced the names of a
committee, of which C. E. Righter, '19,
is chairman, which is to meet Tuesday
night at seven o'clock in the Union to
consider the final plan for student con
trol. Suggestions are wanted, but all
recommendations must be made in
writing.
W. I. Ames explained the prospect
for the coming year in finances and
athletics. He reviewed a little of the
past history of the finances of the stu
dent body and explained why the
Board of Athletic Control was created.
In speaking of the big game with Cali
fornia, Ames said that he thought the
opportunity for the University to make
a creditable showing had come.
"Get into the spirit of athletics," said
\mes," because until you do you will
not eet into the spirit of Stanford."
Miss Ruth Searcy, '20, reviewed the
part that women of the University were
desirous of playing in student affairs
this year. She urged that women turn
out for athletics as well as all the other
activities on the campus.
N. H. Petree outlined the journalistic
activities on the campus and pointed out
the opportunities which the men and
the women on the campus had in sup
porting these activities. In speakinc of
the Daily Palo Alto, Petree said: "The
Dpi'v Palo Alto is owned and con
trolled by you. Its viewpoint should
tie your viewpoint and its interests
should be your interests." Petree went
on to explain how the Illustrated Re
view had partially returned to the stu
dents again after the period of the war
and at the present time hoped to estab
lish the connecting link between the
alumni and the students.
Plans for student control were laid
before the students of the University
by R. L. King, '18, today at one of the
most successful student assemblies ever
held on the campus. Mrs. Herbert
Hoover was called from the audience
to start the assembly, and after a few
words of enthusiastic support Mrs.
Hoover was followed by W. I. Ames,
student body manager, Miss Ruth Searcy,
'20, N. H. Petree, editor of the Daily
