# PETITION SENT TO HIRAM JOHNSON BY FACULTY MEN
## Ask Him to Support Pres. Wilson 
### 
'THE faculty of Stanford University
has taken a firm stand on the Peace
Treaty and League of Nations question.
The accompanying communication to
Senator Hiram Johnson has been signed
by eighty members. Not all were
reached in the brief time that the com
munication was open for signatures.
The paper was presented to all faculty
members impartially, and no argument
whatever was made for sgining.
The following petition to Johnson is
only one of several that have been sent
him recently criticising his stand on
the League of Nations, and requesting
him to ratify President Wilson's policy.:

The Hon. Hiram Johnson,
United States Senator from California,
Washington, D. C.
The undersigned members of the Stan
ford faculty believe that failure to ratify
the pending treaty with Germany, inclu
sive of the covenant to establish a
League of Nations, would imperil the
very objects for which the United States
fought the war, and would encourage
both reactionary and destructive forces
at work in Europe to-day. We there
fore earnestly urge you to withdraw your
opposition and vote for immediate ratifi
cation without amendments or reserva
tions.
R. L. Green.
W. D. Briggs.
Austin F. Rogers.
