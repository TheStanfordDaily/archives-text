# SEVENTY-FIVE MEN ARE NEEDED IN THE R.O.T.C.
## MANY FEATURES OFFERED Complete Uniforms Issued and An Allowance of $12 Is Granted Entrants 
### 
men are yet needed
to complete the minimum registra
tion set for the two units of the Stan
ford R. O. T. C. As there are still a
number of men in the underclasses who
have registered in neither physical or
mylitary training, and in view of the
overcrowded gymnasium classes, it is
hoped that the full quota will be reached
soon.
Major Parker stated today that there
is some misunderstanding concerning
the requirements for freshmen and
sophomores. Six quarters of cither mili
tary or physical trianing are required
of all students who have not had the
equivalent of this amount in some other
university. War service does not ex
cuse students from this requirement.
Three hours of work weekly satis
fies the regulations. When more is
done by the student, as when the hour
of theoretical instruction in infantry is
elected, addtiional credit is given
through the registrar's office. The same
is true of the extra work performed
by students taking nine hours of artil
lery.
In regard to commutation, Major
Parker states that underclassmen as
well as men of the upperclasses who
have had sufficient war experience may
receive the allowance of $12 per month.
This amount may be increased shortly.
Unusually attractive courses have
arranged in both infantry and artillery,
according to those who have examined
the outlines. Pitsols, automatic rifles,
and rifle grenades have been added to
the infantry training.
A particularly complete uniform will
be issued, including overcoat, tie, and
gloves. It is pointed out that the uni
form may be used at all times, and new
issue will replace worn garments.
The officials hope that many fresh
men who are not out for athletics will
register in the military department at
once. It is not Major Parker's opinion,
however, that the unit will be dropped
at Stanford, even though the quota
should not be reached. The commandant
believes also that congress will in the
near future pass more libera legisla
tion for government of the R. O. T. C.
