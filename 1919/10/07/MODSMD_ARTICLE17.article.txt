						DESERVING CALL
## 
### 
IT is time that Stanford students realized the position of the Reserve Of-
fficers' Training Corps and the Artillery Unit at the University. The
United States Army authorities allow R. O. T. C.'s to be established in uni
versities only when the total enrollment in the rorps is two hundred or over.
The present enrollment at Stanford is but one hundred and seventeen, and
unless the remainder of the quota sign up for military work soon, Stanford
will lose her R. O. T. C. The first military training was established at Stan
ford in 1916, and proved popular from the first. However, since the conclu
sion of th ewar, interest has waned along these lines. This is not surprising,
for even the soldier who has served in France now is displeased at the very
thought of "squads right." This can serve as no excuse for a lack of interest
in the military courses given at Stanford. The new Department of Military
Sciense and Tactics has been created so that the University can help to co
operate with the army in training men for service. Every modern equipment
of warfare has been sent to Stanford to make the course interesting and up
to-date. The new artillery unit furnishes an opportunity for enjoyable work
and a chance for a reserve commission given to few students.
The University requirements call for two years of either physical train
ing or military instruction. These particularly interested in the R. O. T. C.
do not ask that the men who will help Stanford on the athletic fields, give
this up and come out for military, nor do they ask these men to don uni
forms at all. However, there are any number of students who work off
their physical requirements with an occasional swim or a romp around the
gymnasium, who would be better off if registered for military work, although
the swim, boxing match, or whatever is done, is of course beneficial. It is to
these students that the Military Department makes a special appeal. Think
of what it means to be prepared if thos country again is forced to either
defend itself or send men to help defend others; think of the benefits derived
from a thorough knowledge of modern artillery, of the late conceptions of
cs; and of the comradeship gained from the association of some
« fc»if university men. The R. O. T. C. and the Artillery Unit need
>112 the students. When the students needed their support dur
they got it, and now it is both their duty and opportunity to
mgth of these organizations up to at leas the minimum re-
War Department.
