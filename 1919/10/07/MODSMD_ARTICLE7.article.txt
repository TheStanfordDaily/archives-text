# EVANS GIVING ELEVEN PRACTICE IN OFFENSIVE
## BIHLMAN NOW ON FIELD Likely Candidates Lining Up In Their Probable Positions 
### 
STARTING this week, Coach Bob
Evans of the varsity football team
is putting his squad through a hard
course of offensive work. Signal prac
tice is being held nightly, and the men
are being drilled in running and block
ing. Heretofore, Evans has laid par
ticular stress on defense practice, but
with the first game witli the U. S. S.
Boston coming a week from Wednes
day, the coach plans to teach the can
dates for the varsity how to advance
the ball.
In the future only Stanford students
will be admitted to football practice,
and strangers will not be allowed, ac
cording to Evans.
As the varsity has been working out
since September 15, Evans is beginning
to get a line on the members of the
squad and the positions they are fitted
for. Among the candidates for the end
positions who are showing up well are
Pelouze, K. Schlaudeman, Bonney,
"Cap" Campbell, Butt and Patrick. The
line men showing ability are Curtice,
Pershing, Broock, Righter, Stevenson,
and Adams. Caughey and Bihlman are
in uniform now and Evans may decide
to use them in the line as soon as they
round into form.
Candidates for the quarter-back posi
tion who are running their teams in
good style are Wark, Holt, R. Schlaude
man, Levy ,and Sentous. The other
backfield men are P. Campbell, Temple
ton, Seaman, Carroll, Reynolds, and
Bonney.
In the first game next Wednesday,
Evans will use practically the entire
squad in an effort to observe how each
man acts in an actual game. The first
real test for the varsity will come with
the Olympic Club on the following
Saturday.
Student Manager Ames announces
that graduate students can obtain the
ordinary undergraduate student's card
at his office for the regular price of two
dollars. This ticket admits to all pre
liminary games and saves about a dol
lar on the ticket for the "Big Game"
with California. A subscription to the
Daily Palo Alto is also included as
well as gymnasium privileges.
