# THE
						INVASION OF RIVAL CAMPUSES MUST CEASE
## NEW RULING PROHIBITS OLD CUSTOM Committee Is Appointed to Arrange Stunts For Big Game 
### 
Any invasion of the University of
California campus by Stanford stu
dents will merit expulsion from this
University, according to a resolution
passed by the Student Council at its
meeting held last night. This action
was taken as a result of the recent
invasion of the California campus re
sulting in the transportation of the
"Golden Bear" to Stanford.
When athletic relations were re
sumed between the two universities,
there was an understanding between
them that an invasion of either
campus by students of the other uni
versity would be sufficient cause for
cancellation of all athletic engage
ments.
The term "invasion" is generally
understood to include any action such
as stealing an object, the destruction
or defacement of property, the mak
ing of any disturbance, the holding
of a rally 011 the opponent's campus,
etc. "Invasion" is construed to be a
very broad term; a narrow interpreta
tion of it might mean the discontinu
ance of athletic relations between the
two universities, according to the
Student Council.
Other actions taken by the council
at its meeting last night, were the
appointment of the Big Game stunt
committee with Sam Briggs, '19, as
chairman; the declaration of closed
dates for three plays and one dance;
and the authorization of W. T. Martin,
secretary of the Student Council to
receive applications for the position
of assistant student manager.
