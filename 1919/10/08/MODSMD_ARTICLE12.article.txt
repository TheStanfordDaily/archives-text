# FROSH COACH WORKS AGAINST SERIOUS HANDICAP
## CALIFORNIA BABES HAVE LARGE TURNOUT Game With Bruin Cubs Only Five Weeks Away 
### 
With the game against the University
of California freshmen only five weeks
away and with a month's start in
training against them, Coach "Art" Ac
ker's Cardinal babes face a hard proposi
tion this season. Acker has a total reg
istration of S(X) to select from, while
over 3,000 freshmen entered Berkeley
this year.
Despite the apparent handicaps, Acker
is extremely confident that out of the
seventy-five candidates that have report
ed for practice, he will develop an eleven
that will fight the California freshmen to
the last minute of play.
Owing to the short time remaining be
fore the first game with the Santa Clara
second Varsity on October 18, Acker is
putting his men through light scrim
mages in order to get a line on his ma
terial. Of the backfield candidates show
ing promise are Creglow, Holt, Doug
lass, Crego, and Osborn. Line men with
ability are Long, Pollard, Saville, McAl
pine, Downs, Johnson, Linstrum, Crav
ens, Helsen, and DeGrote. Among the
aspirants for end positions who are play
ing in good form are Reed, Kennedy,
Austin, and Sproull.
The present candidates for the fresh
men team have had previous American
football experience, and Acker is work
ing them hard before he issues a call for
inexperienced men. Football equipment
is short at present, but arrangements will
be made to accommodate the men sign
ing up as soon as possible.
