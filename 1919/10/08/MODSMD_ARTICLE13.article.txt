# Athletic Policy is Outlined by Browne
## New System of all Sports Is Expected to Attract Many More Students 
### 
Dr. A. D. Browne, who was recently
appointed to fill the position of Medical
Director at Stanford, to-day briefly out
lined his new athletic policy. If support
ed by the students and faculty, the plan
will, in his opinion, introduce an entirely
new scheme of athletics at the University
and will remove all the difficulties that
Varsity teams have experienced in recent
years in getting material out for the ma
jor sports.
"The old system," said Dr. Browne,
"had for its chief difficulty the problem
of getting enough candidates out for the
various squads. It is my plan to start
at what may seem the bottom of the pyra
mid, of which the Varsity composes the
top. This bottom is made up of the
various student groups and affiliations
on the campus. By reorganizing these
groups and getting them interested in
competition it will be possible to get
everyone in each affiliation out for their
particular team, whether this be football,
basketball, cross country, or any other
form of athletics. The coach will then
have the best picked men in the entire
University from which to choose a team."
The pyramid in which Dr. Browne
classifies athletics at Stanford is com
posed as follows: The bottom layer is
made up of fraternities, clubs, Encina,
Sequoia, and the men commuters; the
second strata is composed of the classes
according to their departments; the third,
of the departments themselves; the
fourth, of the military companies; the
fifth, of the four classes; and finally the
Varsity, which is the sixth layer or top of
the pyramid.
The control of athletics here is to be
in the hands of a Supreme Intra-mural
Council, which shall have power to decide
questions and draw up rules, etc. The
council is to be composed of Varsity "S"
men, a senior manager elected from the
classes, the colonel of the Student Ca
dets, the editor of the Daily Palo Alto,
the President of the Associated Students,
a director representing the faculty, one
man from Encina and Sequoia, one repre
senting the fraternities, and one from the
clubs, making a total of nine.

groups and getting them interested in
competition it will be possible to get
everyone in each affiliation out for their
particular team, whether this be football,
basketball, cross country, or any other
form of athletics. The coach will then
have the best picked men in the entire
University from which to choose a team."
The pyramid in which Dr. Browne
classifies athletics at Stanford is com
posed as follows: The bottom layer is
made up of fraternities, clubs, Encina,
Sequoia, and the men commuters; the
second strata is composed of the classes
according to their departments; the third,
of the departments themselves; the
fourth, of the military companies; the
fifth, of the four classes; and finally the
Varsity, which is the sixth layer or top of
the pyramid.
The control of athletics here is to be
in the hands of a Supreme Intra-mural
Council, which shall have power to decide
questions and draw up rules, etc. The
council is to be composed of Varsity "S"
men, a senior manager elected from the
classes, the colonel of the Student Ca
dets, the editor of the Daily Palo Alto,
the President of the Associated Students,
a director representing the faculty, one
man from Encina and Sequoia, one repre
senting the fraternities, and one from the
clubs, making a total of nine.
