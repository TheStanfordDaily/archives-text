# BOOKSTORE INSTALLS NEW SERVICE PHONE
## 
### 
The Stanford Bookstore has installed
a free public telephone for the gen
eral use of Stanford students in mak
ing local calls. The pressure of use
on this telephone has become so great
however. that it has been found neces
sary to withdraw the privilege of us
ing it for long distance purposes. It
is now planned to install a new tele
phone at the Union available for long
distance calls.
