# SING FOR STANFORD AGAIN
## 
### 
/\NE of Stanford's best known and most worth-while organizations will
" again come into existence tonight. The Men's Glee Club completely died
out during the war, and a call has been issued for Stanford men who en
joy singing to tryout tonight for the new club being organized by several
prominent students under the guidance of Warren D. Allen, the University
organist. For years the Stanford Glee Club was an established student or
ganization, an organization that greatly aided the University in public enter
tainments, and a factor that worked for the enhancement of the University's
reputation. Several Stanford Glee Clubs toured the East, and one club made
a trip to the Hawaiian Islands. There is no reason why enough male singers
can not be gathered together at Stanford now, to develop the best Glee Club
that has ever represented the Cardinal. If even a creditable group of sing
ers can be organized into a club so that their individual abilities can be
used collectively for Stanford, the University will willingly send them on a
trip, for the expenses incurred are more than made up for by the favorable
impression made upon strangers by these representatives. Every man who
feels that he can possibly spare one hour a week, and who can sing moderate
ly well should endeavor to make the Glee Club. At least he should show
up at the tryouts tonight, and make an attempt. Stanford wants the Glee
Club back on the old footing, and as the old standard was high, it will
necessitate a good turnout at this first practice to make the new club an
organization resembling the Glee Clubs of former days.
