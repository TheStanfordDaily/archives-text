# BOOKSTORE MONOPOLY AND SERVICE
## 
### 
170UR years ago the"Daily Palo Alto" started a campaign against the
* Stanford Bookstore, complaining that although the store was supposed
to be a cooperative establishment, the price 3 were higher than necessary
id that this was unjust to the students, especially as the Stanford Bookstore
as an absolute monopoly. The bookstore invited the students to inspect
aeir books, and the affair blew over, and now in the days of universal high
>rices, little attention is paid to the charges made by the campus store,
wever, the service that is given the students during these rush times is
lerving of censor. Under the quarter system, the time speeds by quickly,
1 the examination period is present before the students get well started.
3 professors are already piling up assignments as though the old semester
tem was still in vogue, and the students need books badly. Under the
jjicsent monopoly arrangement, the Stanford Bookstore is the only place at
all convenient, and in many cases the only place where the text books can
be secured or ordered, and it is practically impossible to get any kind of
service there now, The students appreciate the difficulties that the Stan
ford Bookstore faces during these rush times, but under a system of com
petition, a bookstore that can not wait on its prospective customers within
a reasonable time, is soon forced to either get more help or close its doors.
We know that there is no chance of the latter, nor do we want it, but we
are hoping for the former.
