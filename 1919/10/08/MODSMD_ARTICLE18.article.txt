# FALSE IMPRESSION GIVEN CONCERNING MUSICAL CONCERTS
## 
### 
Correction of the impression conveyed
by the headline in last Wednesday's is
sue of the Daily Palo Alto, "Peninsula
musical concerts to start during Novem
ber," in advertising the course of three
concerts now being promoted by Mr.
Healy of San Francisco, has been re
quested by the officers of the Peninsula
Musical Association. The two courses
are entirely distinct and should not be
confused in the mind of the public. The
Peninsula Musical Association, a com

munity enterprise now entering its eighth
consecutive season, brings to the Stan
ford Assembly Hall each year four con
certs at a season rate of $s—two5 —two tickets
each for the four concerts, making an
average price of 62]/ 2 cents per concert
for such attractions as Kreisler, Julia
Culp, Evan Williams, the Flonzaley and
Kneisel Quartets, and the San Francisco
Symphony Orchestra. All of these art
ists have appeared here in past seasons
under Peninsula Association auspices.
Course tickets may be secured until
October 15th on application to the Secre
tary, Miss Alice W Kimball, 536 Lincoln
Avenue, Palo Alto.
