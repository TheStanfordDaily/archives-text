# Prof. Treat Favors Adoption of Treaty
## Japan Rightfully Retains Possession of Shantung According to Speaker 
### 
"Amending the Peace Treaty will
do China no good and may harm the
rest of the Allies," said Professor Pav
son J. Treat last night in his lecture
on "The Shantung Treaty," to one of
the largest crowds the Little Treater
has ever held. "The treaty takes
nothing from China that she possessed
at the beginning of the war." Profes
sor Treat went on to say that before
the war Shantung was held by Ger
many, who with other European pow

1914 Japan took possession of German
rights in the Far East. He said that
in 1915, China agreed to accept the
decisions of the conference and in
1917 declared war on Germany after
first bargaining with the Allies as to
what she would receive.

have heard more here about Shantung
than they have heard abroad. He at

versy at the peace table to the fact
that China did not understand that
the peace conference was to deal only

conference would right all the wrongs
of the world.
European rivals."
"Hope now is in the League of
Nations," said Professor Treat. "The
League is a chance to help China and
to live on good terms with Japan."
