# STANFORD GLEE CLUB TRYOUTS TAKE PLACE TONIGHT
## 
### 
With several good trips in view and a
year of unusual promise looming in the
horizon, the Stanford Glee Club en
thusiasts are looking forward with much
interest to the tryouts to he held to-night.
All male singers will get an opportunity
to show their ability at 7:30 in the office
of Mr. Allen, the university organist
and choir director. Two members of
the faculty have been chosen to assist
him in judging the quality of the voices.
The last Stanford Glpe Club held its
sessions in the spring of 1917, the war
sadly interrupting this portion of uni
versity life. Prior to this time Stan
ford Glee Clubs were noted all over
the country, making trips throughout the
east, while one trip was made to Hawaii.
This year a number of fine trips have
been planned, with the possibility of a
tour through the east to add zest to
the competition. The organization will
be handled entirely by the students,
while Mr. Allen has kindly offered to
assist in any way possible in either
training or otherwise. Immediately after
the tryouts regular practice nights wi'J
be decided upon and officers of the
organization picked by the members.
In tomorrow night's tryouts any men
who have solos that they care to bring
are urged to do so, although for those
who have never done any solo work
will have an almost equal chance to
make good. All men are eligibie, fresh
men as well as older students. The
tryouts are to be individual .thus avoid
ing all embarrassment to those trying
out. Membership in the club will be
unlimimted, as leng as the supply of
good voices holds out.
