# FRESHMAN SPIRIT
## 
### 
\ T the freshman "On the Boat" assembly held last night, the senior class
president, A. T. George, spoke on the spirit of Stanford that it was hoped
every student would get.« George told the freshmen that this spirit was
wrapped up in some of the oldest traditions of the University, especially
as regards freshmen. He said, "It is true that the freshmen of today can
feel more independent than those of a few years ago, because all freshmen
discipline has been tabooed. But this fact should not change the freshman's
attitude toward the University, nor toward the few things that are
expected of first-year students at Stanford." The spirit in which the fresh
men took the advice given to them by upperclassmen at the assembly was
excellent. They seemed to realize that the seniors are vitally interested in
making the Stanford of four years from now a better Stanford than it is
today, and that they know this can be accomplished only if the present
freshmen get off on a good start.
Although the rules as regards freshman duties and discipline are no longer
in force, the University will not be as it was before the war unless the
present first-year class adopt the old freshman customs of its own free will.
Every frosh should wear a "dink." This is a tradition well worth while.
They should get into the spirit of the "hello" habit, they should attend the
games, whether they know or care anything about football or not, and they
should immediately learn the Stanford songs and yells. It is inexcusable for
Stanford students to be in ignorance of the words to "Hail, Stanford, Hail,"
and there are many who have apparently not attempted to learn them.
Ragging of freshmen will not be tolerated on the campus any more, but
this does not exclude the freshmen from the duties that once fell upon those
just entering the University. If an upperclassman asks you to do some
thing, don't argue, but do it. Get into the spirit that prevails on the
campus, and much will be derived from the little things that now appear
to be useless and unnecessary. The assembly of last night seemed to show
that the class of 1923 wants to become a part of Stanford. It has a year
before it, and it is hoped that it will not fail. The freshmen must remember
that in the old days, they were forced to do the right thing, but now it is
entirely up to them.

should immediately learn the Stanford songs and yells. It is inexcusable for
Stanford students to be in ignorance of the words to "Hail, Stanford, Hail,"
and there are many who have apparently not attempted to learn them.
Ragging of freshmen will not be tolerated on the campus any more, but
this does not exclude the freshmen from the duties that once fell upon those
just entering the University. If an upperclassman asks you to do some
thing, don't argue, but do it. Get into the spirit that prevails on the
campus, and much will be derived from the little things that now appear
to be useless and unnecessary. The assembly of last night seemed to show
that the class of 1923 wants to become a part of Stanford. It has a year
before it, and it is hoped that it will not fail. The freshmen must remember
that in the old days, they were forced to do the right thing, but now it is
entirely up to them.
\ T the freshman "On the Boat" assembly held last night, the senior class
president, A. T. George, spoke on the spirit of Stanford that it was hoped
every student would get.« George told the freshmen that this spirit was
wrapped up in some of the oldest traditions of the University, especially
as regards freshmen. He said, "It is true that the freshmen of today can
feel more independent than those of a few years ago, because all freshmen
discipline has been tabooed. But this fact should not change the freshman's
attitude toward the University, nor toward the few things that are
expected of first-year students at Stanford." The spirit in which the fresh
men took the advice given to them by upperclassmen at the assembly was
excellent. They seemed to realize that the seniors are vitally interested in
making the Stanford of four years from now a better Stanford than it is
today, and that they know this can be accomplished only if the present
freshmen get off on a good start.
Although the rules as regards freshman duties and discipline are no longer
in force, the University will not be as it was before the war unless the
present first-year class adopt the old freshman customs of its own free will.
Every frosh should wear a "dink." This is a tradition well worth while.
They should get into the spirit of the "hello" habit, they should attend the
games, whether they know or care anything about football or not, and they
should immediately learn the Stanford songs and yells. It is inexcusable for
Stanford students to be in ignorance of the words to "Hail, Stanford, Hail,"
and there are many who have apparently not attempted to learn them.
