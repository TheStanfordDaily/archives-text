CAMPUS RESTAURANTS
The editorial page of the Daily Palo
Alto has seen fit to attack the Stanford
Bookstore, and one cannot help but feel
that there is a great deal of truth in
the complaints that are made. Still, as
one suffering from the pangs of an out
raged digestion, I think they have at
tacked the lesser evil first. As George
Meredith once said:
You can live without books,
What is knowledge but grieving?
You can live without hope,
What is hope but deceiving?
You can live without love,
What is passion but pining?
But where is the man
Who can live without dining?
What shall it profit a man though he
gain much knowledge if digestion be
comes only a memory? To those fresh
men ineligible to the Promised Land by
reason of Conference Ruling, and to the
socially submerged portion of Stanford's
upper classmen, the now existing monop
oly of campus public eating places causes
a real hardship.
As most of my brethren, I talk freely
and think with difficulty, and therefore do
not find it any great hardship to stand

: in line for the ralher doubtful privilege
lof buying college text-books. But hun
ger has dictated the first law of Being,
"Thou shalt eat," and therein lies my
sad story.
Both of the campus eating places are
crowded for all three meals. These two
alleged restaurants compare unfavorably
with similar places in Palo Alto, but a
mile away both as to the quality of the
food and the service. There can be but
one explanation for this poor food and
service, i. c., monopoly.
Stanford is in great need of an eat
ing commons, but if this is not feasible
at the present time there should be in
augurated some system of regulation that
would bring the campus restaurants up to
the Palo Alto standards.
