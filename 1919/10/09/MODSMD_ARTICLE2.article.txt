A freshman is one who has not com
pleted three quarters of University work,
according to the decision reached by the
Interfraternity Conference at its last
meeting, which was held Monday night
at the Union. Ry this decision a man is
termed a freshman, even though he en
tered the University a year or two ago
and has allied himself with some other
class, unless he has finished the required
three quarters' work. This ruling will
affect the men in particular who left
school to go to war.
Another restriction was also placed on
rushing, which prohibits a freshman
from living in a certain house for more
than one night, and he shall not board
steadily at a house except during regis
tration week. A brother of a brother,
active in the chapter, is exempt from
these two latter rulings.
