# Few Men Try Out For Assistant to Yell Leader
## 
### 
Only five men turned out for the
preliminary work in trying for the
positions of assistants to the yell
leader, W. T. Martin, '20, announced
this morning. He states that the
showing is very discouraging in view
of the return of the big games when
a perfect machine will be needed to
conduct the rooting section if Stan
ford is to maintain the standard set
in competition with rooting sections
made up from a university of over
7000 students. Never less than fifteen
or twenty turned out during the past
few years when the big game was
only a tradition, and now that the big
battle will be fought again, it is more
than ever desirable that competent
men try out.
Martin will keep open the tryouts
for several days, and will meet any
candidates at room 220 of Encina, at
4 p.m. tomorrow, or 9 a.m. Saturday,
preliminary instruction is necessary
before the tryoutees go before the
bleachers. From the two sucessful
candidates for assistants, the leader
for next year will be chosen.
