# SHANTUNG LECTURE TO BE REPEATED SUNDAY
## 
### 
Owing to the fact that more than two
hundred students were turned away from
Professor Treat's lecture Tuesday even
ing on "The Shantung Tssue." the news
that the lecture will he repeated at the
Congregational Church in Palo Alto
Sunday evening at 7:30 will doubtless
be pleasing and interesting news to
those who were not fortunate enough
to hear him before.
