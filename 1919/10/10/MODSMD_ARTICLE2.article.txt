## Acceptance by Congress of Plumb Plan of Railway Control, Subject 
### 
Coach Miller L. McClintock announced
today that final arrangements have been
made for the Stanford debate with Cali
fornia to be held on the evening of the
twenty-first of November at the Uni
versity of California.
The question selected this year is:
"Resolved, that Congress should accept
the Plumb plan of railway control." The
question of what to do with our rail
ways has brought forward nation-wide
discussion. As yet Stanford has not
decided which side of the issue it will
uphold.
Coach McClintock advises that men
wishing to try out for the debate should
begin their general reading at once and
should consult with him at once ,as
very little time remains in which to pre
pare for the big debate.
