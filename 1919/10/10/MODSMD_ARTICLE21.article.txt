# MAKE TENNIS A MAJOR SPORT
## 
### 
IF Stanford's athletics are to be strictly up-to-date, if they are to be on a
* par, as a whole, with other universities and not just equal in part, tennis
will have to be placed on a major sport standing as soon as possible. Several
campaigns have been launched here in the past to make tennis a major sport,
but all have gradually died out. This has been caused by a complete lack
of interest in the sport at Stanford, and we believe this lack of interest to
be caused by just two things; poor facilities, and the fact that tennis is
ranked below other sports on the athletic scale. It is true that the University
of California invariably has better players than Stanford, at least they have
succeeded in winning a great majority of the tournaments played, but this
does not argue for the continuance of tennis here as a minor sport. In fact,
it argues just the opposite. If tennis is raised to a parity with football, base
ball, track, crew, and basketball, a great many more students will be out
for the teams than has been the case. This will mean that new courts and
better facilities all around will have to be installed by the University, and
that better contestants will be developed. Practically every other university
of size in America has tennis listed as one of its major sports. As a conse
quence, many of the best players in the United States are developed in these
colleges. Stanford has turned out a few good tennis players, but the Murrays
and Hahns here have been few and far between. We can not hope to be able
to compete with California unless the standard of the sport is raised here.
It is a matter for the students to consider and to take action upon. The
Daily Palo Alto is behind this move with what force it can muster on the
campus. It requests that some of those vitally interested show their interest
in a tangible way. The "Another Viewpoint" column is open to those who
wish to express themselves on this subject, and an effort will be made to
have the question placed before the Student Council, and the Student Body,
as soon as expedient.
