To the Editor:
The editorial in Wednesday's paper
regarding the Bookstore, while it might
be justified in some particulars, was
written without a full understanding of
the facts. The principal point made was
that the store did not have sufficient help.
It is very easy to suggest that extra
help he obtained, but it is not at all a
simple matter in these days to get extra
help. For work behind the counter un
trained help is not suitable, and there
are very few students who have had the
right experience. One such student we
are employing, another one upon whom
we depended was not able to come. For
other kinds of work there were employed
during the rush five students at different
times. In addition, the services of the
former manager of the store were ob
tained for the week of the heaviest
business, and an extra man has been em
ployed two or three hours in the evenings
on special work. Besides all this, in an
ticipation of extra demands upon us,
another man was put on the permanent
force before college opened. In view of
the above, it seems that the store has
been doing verything possible to meet
the situation. It should be further un
derstood that too many clerks are a
hindrance rather than a help, especially
when it is necessary to get new people
who do not know the stock,
ft might be well to state a few diffi

culties with which the Bookstore is
contending. Mistakes have been made
arid the management is quite willing
to shoulder the blame for such, but we
object to taking the blame for matters
beyond our control. Sixty students were
expected in one class, and sufficient books
were on hand to supply this class. When
the registration jumped to 190, a tele
gram was dispatched to New York for
more books, and the response came that
the publishers had none. This firm is
one of many which do not carry stock in
any San Francisco depository. Even the
San Francisco depositories have not been
able to carry sufficient stock, the most
notable case being that of the American
Book Company, which has not been able
to supply Spanish grammars, al
though it is supposed at all times to
carry a full stock of its entire list. There
have been several cases of professors
sending students in for books without
notifying the Bookstore in advance that
such books were needed, or giving any
information regarding the registration.
As a further indication of the diffi
cult situation, it may be stated that in
the first seven days of the business the
receipts were nearly 25 per cent of the
receipts for the entire twelve months pre
ceding. The strain on the organization
could not be fully provided for any more
than the University itself has been able
entirely to foresee the extra demands
upon it.
