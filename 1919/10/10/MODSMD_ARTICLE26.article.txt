# AMERICAN FOOTBALL RULES PRINTED FOR USE OF THE STUDENTS
## 
### 
Since Stanford students as a whole are
unfamiliar with American football and
the rules regulating the game, sections
from the Official Football Rules of 1919
will be published from time to time in
the Daily Palo Alto. The following
matter is reprinted from Spalding's Of
ficial 1919 Football Guide:
Both in play and by tradition football
is a distinctively academic game—the
game of the schools and the colleges.
The friends of the game must accord
ingly rely on the schools and colleges
for the preservation of its past traditions
and the maintenance of the high stand
ards of sportsmanship in its play, which
are to be expected in a distinctively
academic game.
In some sports it is possible to attain
reasonably high standards simply by the
adoption and enforcement of rules, but
this is not true in football. There are so
many men engaged in action, the action
is so rapid and so constantly shifting
that it is impossible for any official to
discover every possible infraction of the
rules.
The committee, in the remodeling of
the rules that has gradually taken place,
has endeavored to prohibit and suitably
penalize all forms of unfair tactics and
practices. It has also endeavored, so
far as possible, without affecting the op
portunity for unsportsmanlike play.
So far as the rules themselves are con
cerned, the committee feels that it has
done about all that it can do, and it has
been with continually increasing satis
faction that the members of the com
mittee, in common with all other lovers
of the game, have observed the rapid
improvement in the standards of play.
Each year there has been less attempt
on the part of the players "to beat the
rules," and unfair tactics have largely
disappeared. The "anything to win"
coach is disappearing. Officials are gen
erally more efficient and fearless, and
their rulings are more and more being
accepted without quibbling.
There are, however, still many school
teams, and even some college teams, that
seem to fail to recognize that the first
obligation of every football player is to
protect the game itself, its reputation,
and its good name. He owes this to the
game, its friends, and its traditions.
There can be little excuse for any col
lege player who allows the game to be
smirched with unsportsmanlike tactics.
In the case of the players in the school
teams, however, the committee is in
clined to believe that unsportsmanlike
play is due largely to ignorance of what
the proper standards are and what the
great host of ex-football players and
friends of the game expect from the
boys who are just learning it.
Substitutes
Section 2. A player may be substitut
ed for another at any time, but, before
engaging in play he must report to the
referee or umpire. An incoming substi
tute shall not communicate in any way
with any of the players upon the field
until after the ball has been putin play.
In case any change in the position of
players is rendered necessary by the
substitution, the substitute going in may
give that information only through the
referee. In case the substitute sent in is
to take the place of the man who had
regularly been giving signals previous to
his removal from the game, the man
sent in may give the signals, but without
consultation with the players until after
the ball has been putin play. If the man
who has been giving signals is not re
moved from the game when a new
player conies in for the purpose of giy
ing signals, the former must give the
signal on the play following. A player
who has been withdrawn from the game
may return once, at the beginning of a

subsequent period. A player disqualified
or suspended may not return to the
game.
Scoring
The game shall be decided by the
final score at the end of the four periods.
The. following shall be the value of
plays in scoring:
Touchdown, 6 points.
Goal from touchdown, 1 point.
Goal from the field, 3 points.
Safety by opponents, 2 points.
The score of a forfeited game shall
be 1 to 0 in favor of the offended side.
Definitions
A Place-kick is made by kicking the
ball from its position while it is resting
upon the ground. It is allowable to
scrape up the earth, but no artificial tees
shall be permitted.

Each year there has been less attempt
on the part of the players "to beat the
rules," and unfair tactics have largely
disappeared. The "anything to win"
coach is disappearing. Officials are gen
erally more efficient and fearless, and
their rulings are more and more being
accepted without quibbling.
There are, however, still many school
teams, and even some college teams, that
seem to fail to recognize that the first
obligation of every football player is to
protect the game itself, its reputation,
and its good name. He owes this to the
game, its friends, and its traditions.
There can be little excuse for any col
lege player who allows the game to be
smirched with unsportsmanlike tactics.
In the case of the players in the school
teams, however, the committee is in
clined to believe that unsportsmanlike
play is due largely to ignorance of what
the proper standards are and what the
great host of ex-football players and
friends of the game expect from the
boys who are just learning it.
Substitutes
Section 2. A player may be substitut
ed for another at any time, but, before
engaging in play he must report to the
referee or umpire. An incoming substi
tute shall not communicate in any way
with any of the players upon the field
until after the ball has been putin play.
In case any change in the position of
players is rendered necessary by the
substitution, the substitute going in may
give that information only through the
referee. In case the substitute sent in is
to take the place of the man who had
regularly been giving signals previous to
his removal from the game, the man
sent in may give the signals, but without
consultation with the players until after
the ball has been putin play. If the man
who has been giving signals is not re
moved from the game when a new
player conies in for the purpose of giy
ing signals, the former must give the
signal on the play following. A player
who has been withdrawn from the game
may return once, at the beginning of a

subsequent period. A player disqualified
or suspended may not return to the
game.
Scoring
The game shall be decided by the
final score at the end of the four periods.
The. following shall be the value of
plays in scoring:
Touchdown, 6 points.
Goal from touchdown, 1 point.
Goal from the field, 3 points.
Safety by opponents, 2 points.
The score of a forfeited game shall
be 1 to 0 in favor of the offended side.
Definitions
A Place-kick is made by kicking the
ball from its position while it is resting
upon the ground. It is allowable to
scrape up the earth, but no artificial tees
shall be permitted.

Since Stanford students as a whole are
unfamiliar with American football and
the rules regulating the game, sections
from the Official Football Rules of 1919
will be published from time to time in
the Daily Palo Alto. The following
matter is reprinted from Spalding's Of

Both in play and by tradition football
is a distinctively academic game—the
game of the schools and the colleges.
The friends of the game must accord
ingly rely on the schools and colleges
for the preservation of its past traditions
and the maintenance of the high stand
ards of sportsmanship in its play, which
are to be expected in a distinctively
academic game.
In some sports it is possible to attain
reasonably high standards simply by the
adoption and enforcement of rules, but
this is not true in football. There are so
many men engaged in action, the action
is so rapid and so constantly shifting
that it is impossible for any official to
discover every possible infraction of the
rules.
The committee, in the remodeling of
the rules that has gradually taken place,
has endeavored to prohibit and suitably
penalize all forms of unfair tactics and
practices. It has also endeavored, so
far as possible, without affecting the op
portunity for unsportsmanlike play.
So far as the rules themselves are con
cerned, the committee feels that it has
done about all that it can do, and it has
been with continually increasing satis
faction that the members of the com
mittee, in common with all other lovers
of the game, have observed the rapid

Since Stanford students as a whole are
unfamiliar with American football and
the rules regulating the game, sections
from the Official Football Rules of 1919
will be published from time to time in
the Daily Palo Alto. The following
matter is reprinted from Spalding's Of
ficial 1919 Football Guide:
Both in play and by tradition football
is a distinctively academic game—the
game of the schools and the colleges.
The friends of the game must accord
ingly rely on the schools and colleges
for the preservation of its past traditions
and the maintenance of the high stand
ards of sportsmanship in its play, which
are to be expected in a distinctively
academic game.
In some sports it is possible to attain
reasonably high standards simply by the
adoption and enforcement of rules, but
this is not true in football. There are so
many men engaged in action, the action
is so rapid and so constantly shifting
that it is impossible for any official to
discover every possible infraction of the
rules.
The committee, in the remodeling of
the rules that has gradually taken place,
has endeavored to prohibit and suitably
penalize all forms of unfair tactics and
practices. It has also endeavored, so
far as possible, without affecting the op
portunity for unsportsmanlike play.
So far as the rules themselves are con
cerned, the committee feels that it has
done about all that it can do, and it has
been with continually increasing satis
faction that the members of the com
mittee, in common with all other lovers
of the game, have observed the rapid
improvement in the standards of play.
Each year there has been less attempt
on the part of the players "to beat the
rules," and unfair tactics have largely
disappeared. The "anything to win"
coach is disappearing. Officials are gen
erally more efficient and fearless, and
their rulings are more and more being
accepted without quibbling.
There are, however, still many school
teams, and even some college teams, that
seem to fail to recognize that the first
obligation of every football player is to
protect the game itself, its reputation,
and its good name. He owes this to the
game, its friends, and its traditions.
There can be little excuse for any col
lege player who allows the game to be
smirched with unsportsmanlike tactics.
In the case of the players in the school
teams, however, the committee is in
clined to believe that unsportsmanlike
play is due largely to ignorance of what
the proper standards are and what the
great host of ex-football players and
friends of the game expect from the
boys who are just learning it.
Substitutes
Section 2. A player may be substitut
ed for another at any time, but, before
engaging in play he must report to the
referee or umpire. An incoming substi
tute shall not communicate in any way
with any of the players upon the field
until after the ball has been putin play.
In case any change in the position of
players is rendered necessary by the
substitution, the substitute going in may
give that information only through the
referee. In case the substitute sent in is
to take the place of the man who had
regularly been giving signals previous to
his removal from the game, the man
sent in may give the signals, but without
consultation with the players until after
the ball has been putin play. If the man
who has been giving signals is not re
moved from the game when a new
player conies in for the purpose of giy
ing signals, the former must give the
signal on the play following. A player
who has been withdrawn from the game
may return once, at the beginning of a

subsequent period. A player disqualified
or suspended may not return to the
game.
Scoring
The game shall be decided by the
final score at the end of the four periods.
The. following shall be the value of
plays in scoring:
Touchdown, 6 points.
Goal from touchdown, 1 point.
Goal from the field, 3 points.
Safety by opponents, 2 points.
The score of a forfeited game shall
be 1 to 0 in favor of the offended side.
