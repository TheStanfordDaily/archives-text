# Y.M.C.A. DELEGATES WILL MEET SATURDAY
## STANFORD MEN HOSTS Surrounding Institutions Will Be Represented at Convention 
### 
Delegates representing Y. M. C. A.
activities at a number of western col
leges will be guests of the Stanford
Y. M. C. A. this Friday, Saturday and
Sunday at the "Y" Intercollegiate
Conference. The delegates number
about fifty in all and represent the
University of California, the College
of the Pacific, San Jose Y. M. C. A.,
and various Theological Seminaries
around the bay. It is hoped that by
holding regular conferences in the
future such as this, the work of the
Y. M. C. A. may be greatly facilitat
ed and will be of greater benefit to
college communities. The results ob
tained by concerted action and inter
change of ideas of social service, will
it is planned, increase "Y" activities
so that they will embrace a much
larger field than at present.
The propram to be followed by the
delegates is a very extensive one, and
will occupy their entire time while
at Stanford. A welcoming banquet is
to be held tonight at 6:30 at the
Women's Club House, the principal
speakers of the evening being Dr. Wil
bur, who will talk on "The American
College Obligation in the Present
World Situation," and Gale Seaman,
Secretary of the Western Department
of the Y. M. C. A. Le√üoy King, '19,
President of the Stanford Y. M. C. A.
Cabinet, will welcome the delegates.
Saturday's work is to be conducted in
the Vestry where well-known "Y"
leaders will speak on subjects dealing
with Cabinet work, Bible study and
discussion group projects, deputation
work, and student volunteer conven
tions. W. J. French of the State In
dustrial Accident Commission, and Dr.
Hubert Phillips of Columbia will speak
on the relation of students to industri
al unrest, and their part in the vast
program of the churches. Sunday is
to be devoted to the study of edu
cational features such as study groups,
exhibits, world problem forums, and
addresses. It is planned to vary the
business of the conference with hikes
and other forms of diversion. The
program is to be completed by 5
o'clock Sunday afternoon.
