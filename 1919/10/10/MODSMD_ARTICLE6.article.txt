# SQUAD REDUCTION TO BE COMPLETED BY FIRST OF WEEK
## 
### 
Reduction of the varsity football squad
will be completed the early part of next
week by Coach Rob Evans. Evans has
been cutting the squad during the past
week and he anticipates that by Mon
day he will have the right number of
men to work with for the rest of the
season.
The varsity and freshman elevens
scrimmmaged this afternoon for a short
period. Nearly all the members of both
squads were given opportunities to show
their wares. It was the first time that
either team had scrimmaged against each
other, and both coaches were able to
get an indication of their strong and
weak points. %
The varsity will not practice tomorrow
in order to give the men a rest.
