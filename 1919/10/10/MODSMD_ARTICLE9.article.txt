# WOMEN'S CONFERENCE REPEALS OLD RULES
## Will Permit Students Return On Theater Train and Walk in Hills 
### 
At a special meeting of the Women's
Conference held last night two im
portant rules were lifted. The theatre
train rule which forbade women to re
turn to the campus on the theatre train
from San Francisco, and the rule which
forbade women from walking in the
hills after dark are the rules lifted.
During the period of the war when
Camp Fremont was situated so near to
Stanford, the conference passed the rule
prohibiting women from walking in the
hills after dark. The rule that there
shall be no riding in automobiles on the
highway after dark, unless chaperoned,
however, is still in force.
Further, it is the sentiment of the con
ference that no women shall leave any
assembly until it is adjourned, and
the women are requested not to attend
unless they do so with the intention of
remaining throughout the entire ses
sion.
Miss Kirby Ingoldsby, '21, was elected
as the fifth member of the council
to take the place of Miss Bernice Tay
lor, '21 who is not on the campus this
quarter.
The revision of rules is not yet com
plete, but the conference announces that
a full list will be printed before the end
of the quarter, or as soon as all correc
tions are made.
