## Violates Contract 
### 
IN an address delivered as an amend
ment to the Founding Grant, by Mrs.
Stanford, on October 3, 1902, she said:
"The University has been endowed
with a view of offering instruction
free, or nearly free, that it may resist
the tendency to the stratification of
society, by keeping open an avenue
whereby the deserving and exceptional
may rise through their own efforts
from the lowest to the highest stations
in life. A spirit of equality must ac
cordingly be maintained within the
University." What a change has taken
place from the original policy of the
Stanfords! All Stanford men and
women, be they members of the pres
ent student body, the alumni, or the
faculty, must have a feeling of sad
ness at the drastic ahange which
makes Stanford no longer the institu
tion where the poor can attend as well
as the wealthy. The Daily Palo Alto
is not attempting to change the Board
of Trustees' decision in determining
that tuition fees are a necessary ad
dition to the student's expenses here,
but it does want to lead the way in
a protest against installing the "pay
as you enter" scheme before October
of 1920.
We believe that this is a violation of
the University's contract with the
students, and that morally it should
not be enforced, and we even question
whether it can be enforced legally.
We have on record a very similar case
against the University of Missouri in
which the Kansas City Court of Ap
peals held that when a student pays
the present required tuition fee under
the impression that it will be the only
fee charged during that year, that a
contract is implied, and that an ad
ditional sum can not later be charged
him... The cases are not identical in
detail, and the professors of the Stan
ford Law Department will not at pres
ent commit themselves as to whether
the charging of tuition fees in Janu
ary is a violation of contract, and as
such can not be enforced... The very
fact that the new rule has aroused a
storm of protest, that its validity is
to say the least questionable, that it
appears to disclose a shortsighted
policy on the part of the Board of
Trustees, and should force them to
reconsider the measure.
One of Stanford's greatest men said
this morning that in his opinion it was
an unwise move... He is in such a po
sition that he can not expediently be
quoted, but the students are glad to
know that they are not alone in their
protest. . The "students viewpoint" is
not as a rule far away from that of
the alumni and the faculty, and many
are the Stanford men and women who
will express themselves as against any
official move which will force stu
dents now in college to either borrow
a considerable sum of money to meet
fees that they were given no reason
to anticipate, or drop out of college.
We hope that the President of the
University will call an assembly and
explain the proposition to the students.
There undoubtedly are excellent rea
sons for the Trustees' action in charg
ing tuition, and we want to hear
them. We see no justice in chang
ing them within a year, however, and
it is questionable if an assembly could
rpake us think otherwise on this point.

IN an address delivered as an amend
ment to the Founding Grant, by Mrs.
Stanford, on October 3, 1902, she said:
"The University has been endowed
with a view of offering instruction
free, or nearly free, that it may resist
the tendency to the stratification of
society, by keeping open an avenue
whereby the deserving and exceptional
may rise through their own efforts
from the lowest to the highest stations
in life. A spirit of equality must ac
cordingly be maintained within the
University." What a change has taken
place from the original policy of the
Stanfords! All Stanford men and
women, be they members of the pres
ent student body, the alumni, or the
faculty, must have a feeling of sad
ness at the drastic ahange which
makes Stanford no longer the institu
tion where the poor can attend as well
as the wealthy. The Daily Palo Alto
is not attempting to change the Board
of Trustees' decision in determining
that tuition fees are a necessary ad
dition to the student's expenses here,
but it does want to lead the way in
a protest against installing the "pay
as you enter" scheme before October
of 1920.
We believe that this is a violation of
the University's contract with the
students, and that morally it should
not be enforced, and we even question
whether it can be enforced legally.
We have on record a very similar case
against the University of Missouri in
which the Kansas City Court of Ap
peals held that when a student pays
the present required tuition fee under
the impression that it will be the only
fee charged during that year, that a
contract is implied, and that an ad
ditional sum can not later be charged
him... The cases are not identical in
detail, and the professors of the Stan
ford Law Department will not at pres
ent commit themselves as to whether
the charging of tuition fees in Janu
ary is a violation of contract, and as
such can not be enforced... The very
fact that the new rule has aroused a
storm of protest, that its validity is
to say the least questionable, that it
appears to disclose a shortsighted
policy on the part of the Board of
Trustees, and should force them to
reconsider the measure.
One of Stanford's greatest men said
this morning that in his opinion it was
an unwise move... He is in such a po
sition that he can not expediently be
quoted, but the students are glad to
know that they are not alone in their
protest. . The "students viewpoint" is
not as a rule far away from that of
the alumni and the faculty, and many
are the Stanford men and women who
will express themselves as against any
official move which will force stu
dents now in college to either borrow
a considerable sum of money to meet
fees that they were given no reason
to anticipate, or drop out of college.
We hope that the President of the
University will call an assembly and
explain the proposition to the students.
There undoubtedly are excellent rea
sons for the Trustees' action in charg
ing tuition, and we want to hear
them. We see no justice in chang
ing them within a year, however, and
it is questionable if an assembly could
rpake us think otherwise on this point.
