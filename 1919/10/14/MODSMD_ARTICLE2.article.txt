# PRELIMINARY SEASON FOR FOOTBALL OPENS
## Practice Contests Held on Eastern and Western Gridirons 
### 
American football swung into its pre
liminary season Saturday from the At
lantic to the Pacific coast when nearly
all of the colleges and universities placed
their elevens on the gridiron for prac
tice contests. The scores, as a whole,
were relatively high, with Chicago top
ping the list by blanking Great Lakes
124 to 0. The Annapolis Middies crossed
the John Hopkins line for 6 points
against 9, and Notre Dame piled up 60
points to Mount Union's 7.
The best game of the day took plaec
between Cornell and Williams, the final
score being 3 to 0.
On the Pacific Coast, the California
Bears managed to work St. Mary's
eleven for 19 points to 0. Aandy Smith's
boys had trouble in holding on to the
pigskin in the early part of the game,
but as soon as they decided that the
ball was o.k., several touchdowns were
made Murray proved to be the out
standing figure of the game, and Fred
Brooks ran him a close second.
The much famed California freshmen
swamped the Mare Island sailors with
a 60 to 0 score. Coach Price of the
Cubs, according to all reports, has col
lected a squad of prep-school stars who
are wonders and who seem to know
how to play football.
Columbia University will enter the
field of football competition in 1920 after
having been out of touch with the game
for several years. Columbia will sched
ule contests with Harvard, Princeton,
Yale, and the other big eastern institu
tions.
