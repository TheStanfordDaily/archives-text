# IN REPLY TO THE COACH

17DITORIALLY, we stand for the whole student body, not a faction of it. even
though that faction may call itself the athletic element. We certainly do nor
wish to start even discussion which would appear to recognize the existence of
elements in the University which are working in their own separate paths as
opposed to the remainder of the student body. The Daily Palo Alto can not be
justly accused of not supporting American football, and it certainly can not be
said to be lacking in Stanford spirit. Whpfi we suggest a possible betterment of
conditions, whether those Condi*s ns on the at hi et i c field or in the administra
tion offices, we hope that the suggestion is taken in the spirit that it is given.
Because we object to sitting on the bleachers for over an hour waiting for a
game that has been announced is no reason why we should be requested to trans
fer to the University of California if we do not like it. Coach Evans is mis
taken if he thinks that we are taking issue with him personally *or with the
football team. If our readers will reread the editorial, "Give the Bleachers a
Chance," they will find no insinuation that the football coach has been attacking
rugby. We merely say that the American game is new here, there are many
who neither know it nor at present care for it. If Stanford is to be successful
in football, these people have to be taken into consideration and educated to the
point where they are enthusiastic. If the game Wednesday was delayed because
of injury, how easy it would have been to send someone over to the bleachers
and inform them of the situation. Neither the Daily Palo Alto nor the student
body which it represents can be accused of not supporting the team. We are all
pulling for it and with it, but the bleachers necessarily demand certain considera
tion, and this must be thought of by our coaches as well as turning out winning
teams.
