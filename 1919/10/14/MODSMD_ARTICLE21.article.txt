For the benefit of the author of
"Give the Bleachers a Chance," and
those who were on the field last Fri
day afternoon, the writer will say that
it is very true that a game between
Frosh and Varsity had been an
nounced. It was also called off for
good reasons, which evidently the
member of our daily paper did not
think was important enough to find
out. Mr. Acker has had his squad
together about 10 days, and by work
ing tue men hard he has been able to
develop one quarter-back who could
run the team through a few plays, and
it was decided to let them scrimmage
the Varsity with same.
However, the freshman, Q. B. Trago
by name, received a sprained ankle
early Friday, and Mr. Acker refused
to play under such conditions, which
was very correct.
After the students came out stronger
than expected, Coach Evans asked
him to line up only a few times
against a Varsity team, merely to let
the crowd see the men in action. It
was agreed to keep the teams from
scoring, as the Freshmen were at a
disadvantage.
The Varsity coach and some thirty
men gave up their summer work for
three weeks and put the time in volun
tarily, for Stanford's cause, in the
American game this year, at a financi
al loss to themselves, and they are
not thankful for advice given nor
examples of how California did it, as
mentioned. The writer suggests that

if the member of the D. P. A. staff
is so in love with California's policies,
that he change schools at once, and
will inform above mentioned, that he
will try to please Stanford students
to the best of his ability in his own
way 011 the football field.
The insinuation that all American
game supporters are anti-Rugby is
also objected to, as none of the parties
referred to are responsible for what
game is played, and would like to see
Rugby continue as a sport in this
school.
If the author of yesterday's article
will come out and help coach the
Freshmen and the Varsity teams, we
may be able to put on a practice
game for the student body within a
short time.
M. C. EVANS.
