# Encina Hall to Have New Telephone System
## 
### 
A new telephone system, with phones
on every floor, is one of the improve
ments to be put into Encina Hall in
the near future.
Two phones, to be cared for by fresh
men, will be put on every floor in the
hall, with an exchange in the old tele
phone room. Under the old system the
only phones were on the first floor, and
a great deal of time was wasted getting
calls to men on other floors. The new
system reduces the possibility of the
line being busy, and it will be much
easier to distribute calls.
