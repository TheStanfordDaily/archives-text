The announcement of the tuition
fee of $40.00 per quarter levied on
Stanford students by the Trustees of
Stanford, beginning January 1, 19201,
after having made statements through
University publications to the effect
that the usual $20 per quarter, inci
dental fee, covered the charges of
registration of the year 1919-20, seems
to admit a singular condition of busi
ness administration. Should our elect
ed city or county officials show the
extreme lack of foresight and business
judgment to make up a yearly budget,
levy a tax, and then, because of either
having overlooked a most important
item of public expenditure or through
gross mismanagement, arbitrarily
raise that tax 200 per cent, we might
be moved to wildly inquire—why?
Had this tuition fee been announced
in the University catalogue for 1919-
20, who is there among us who would
have come to Stanford with a feeling
of righteous indignation which now
generally prevails? And is there any
logical reason why the University
Trustees should not have anticipated
this apparently sudden and urgent
necessity for additional funds? Surely,
if the professors knew that their
salaries were to be raised on Novem
ber 1, 1919, the Trustees themselves
knew it.
If this war tax (n education MUST
be levied, the least the Trustees can
do is to make the first assessment on
the autumn quarter 1920. Of course,
this would mean a loss to the trasury,
compared with the present plan, of
approximately a quarter million dol
lars. But what is a quarter million
dollars to an institution which can
erect a magnificent library, and an
expensive pretentious mansion for the
University President during a time
when materials and labor are more
dear and more scarce than during any
time within our memory?
The case of a personal friend of the
writer is only one of those whose lot
will be shameful treatment. Here was
a young man, established in another
university, but who envied the greater
opportunities of a college career at
Stanford, and succumbing to the
entreaties of his friends and the as
surance that his way would be as
easily made here as at his former
university, due to the free tuition, etc.,
came. Now he is here; registration
at his former university is closed, and
will remain so all year. His funds
will not allow the extra tuition. It
remains for him to either quit college
cold, or start a career in the world,
(a thing hard enough to do when
one is "square" at the start) in debt.
He will probably quit. Maybe this is
an objective gained. Maybe this is a
plan to partially depopulate the
campus.? Who knows —maybe the
monetary method is more easily mani
pulated than the scholarship method,
now in vogue at California?
