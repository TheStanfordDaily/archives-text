# GALLI-CURCI COMING IN HEALY CONCERTS
## 
### 
Season tickets for the three concerts
to be given at Stanford under the direc
tion of Frank Healy will go on sale to
morrow at the Bookstore and at Rob
inson and CrandalFs in Palo Alto.
Amelita Galli-Curci, the world's
greatest coloratura soprano; Rudolph
Ganz, pianist; and Carolina Lazzari,
contralto, are the three artists who will
he heard in this course.
The price for a season ticket is $5.00.
with an additional war tax of 80c. Ac
cording to Government ruling, the war
tax on season or subscription tickets
must be computed on the scale of prices
for single tickets. If tickets were pur
chased for the separate recitals of each
of the artists mentioned above, the total
cost would be $8.00. Therefore the Gov
ernment demands that a tax of 80c be
collected on each season ticket sold.
