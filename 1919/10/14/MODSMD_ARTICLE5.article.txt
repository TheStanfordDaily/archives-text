# Ross Breaks Half Mile Swim Record
## 
### 
Swimming in Encina pool yester
day before only a handful of people,
Norman Ross, former wearer of the
Cardinal and world's champion swim
mer, broke the worlds record by eleven
seconds for the half-mile swim, ac
cording to the unofficial timing. The
former record was made fifteen years
ago by B. B. Kieran in Australia, his
time being eleven minutes, eleven
and three-fifths seconds.
Coach Backrack, of the Illinois
Athletic Club, acted as referee and
timer. Although this is not official
time, Ross expects to swim again
next Friday afternoon in a half-mile
race, where official timers will be on
hand.
