# Women's Club House Installs Guest Suite
## 
### 
In answer to a long-felt need for
accommodations on the campus for
women guests of the University, a
bedroom suite has been installed in
the Women's Club House, under the
auspices of the Alumnae Association.
This suite, which is to be known
as the Margaret Post Stolz Memorial,
in recognition of the services of Mrs.
Stolz in the early days of the club
house, has been attractively furnished
at a cost of over three hundred dol
lars through the gifts of life members
living in the vicinity. Women friends
of university people, and visiting
alumnae can secure accommodations
in the new suite.
To install bedrooms on the third
floor of the clubhouse was the origin
al plan, but in view of the fact that
these rooms are in great demand for
student meetings, the guest room has
been located downstairs in the front
part of the biulding.
The suite was on exhibition for the
first time Wednesday afternoon when
the first of a series of Alumnae teas
was given at the clubhouse. Pro
ceeds from this tea and those to fol
low on Wednesday of each week, will
be used to pay for improvements on
the clubhouse. The presence of all
friends of the University at the teas
is desired that the clubhouse fund
may be increased.
Among other innovations at the
clubhouse is the new office fitted up
on the first floor for Mrs. Elwell, the
matron.
