# Women's Club House Installs Guest Suite
## 
### 
In answer to a long-felt need for
accommodations on the campus for
women guests of the University, a
bedroom suite has been installed in
the Women's Club House, under the
auspices of the Alumnae Association.
This suite, which is to be known
as the Margaret Post Stolz Memorial,
in recognition of the services of Mrs.
Stolz in the early days of the club
house, has been attractively furnished
at a cost of over three hundred dol
lars through the gifts of life members
living in the vicinity. Women friends
