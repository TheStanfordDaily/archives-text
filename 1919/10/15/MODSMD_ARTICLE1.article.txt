# STUDENTS SUBMIT LETTER PROTESTING BOARD ACTION
## Object to Date for Charging Tuition 
### 
STUDENT opinion on the campus in
regard to the recent action of the
Board of Trustees in declaring a tui
tion fee of $40.00, each quarter, re
sulted in a letter signed by men and
women representing the various act
ivities on the campus. The letter,
giving expression of student opinion,
has been submitted to the Board for
their consideration. It protests the
action taken and requests that such
action be delayed at least until next
October.
The letter and the names of those
who have signed it are as follows: —
Stanford University, Oct. 15, 191!).
Board of Trustees of Stanford Univer
sity, San Francisco, Calif. Dear Sirs:
—In the hope that new light may be
thrown upon a situation that might
not have been thoroughly understood
by the Board of Trustees, and with a
desire to co-operate with the Board
for the betterment of the University,
but not to the misfortune of a single
student now registered at Stanford,
we are sending this letter for your
consideration.
As the editorial columns of the Daily
Palo Alto, the student newspaper,
stated, the news of the Board's action
as regards the payment of tuition
fees, "fell like a bombshell ,on the
Stanford student body." It is a drastic
change from the old custom at Stan
ford, and the students regret to see
the University pass from the status
of a free institution to that of a pay
college. They feel that the change
will have a tendency to make Stan
ford less democratic, that the wealthy

will come here for their education,
while the poor boys and girls, so many
of whom have become well-known
members of the Stanford alumni, will
be excluded. There will probably be
very few willing to place themselves
among the debtor class by signing a
note for the tuition fees, and as a
consequence, the students feel that
Stanford is to lose many desirable
men and women because of the new
rule.
The Board of Trustees must have
considered this matter very seriously
before taking such step, and if the
only method now appearing possible
to secure funds to meet the increase
in professors' salaries is to charge
tuition fees, the Stanford students
will accept the situation in the proper
spirit, as loyal Stanford men and
women have always done. However,
the student body is not willing to pay
the tuition fee on January 1, 1920.
Its members feel that the earliest
time possible that the University can
justly charge these fees is October
of 1920, and we i-equest that this mat
ter be reconsidered by the Board of
Trustees.
Over twenty-four hundred students
entered Stanford this quarter with the
understanding that there would be
no tuition charged, in the year 1919-
20. The Register of the University
specifically states that the $20.00 inci
dental fee is the only charge made
with the exception of the usual sylla
bus fees, and the present student body
came here with that understanding.
