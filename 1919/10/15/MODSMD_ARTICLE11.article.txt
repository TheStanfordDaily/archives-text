# SWORD AND SANDALS NAME ORIENTAL PLAY
## SELECT BELASCO COMEDY Frances Power's "The First Born" Will Be Staged In November 
### 
first drama to be staged on the
campus this year will be produced by
the Sword and Sandals Society Novem
ber 7. David Belasco's Oriental play,
"The First Born," by Francis Powers,
lias been chosen as the production, and
it was under great difficulty and consid
erable expense that the manuscript was
obtained. All rights of production have
been sold to a moving picture company,
and upon inquiry of business managers
in San Francisco they discouraged the
local society in making an attempt to
gain the right to stage it.
The drama, "The First Born," is taken
from the typical life in China town of
San Francisco. Its setting is in San
Francisco and was first produced there.
Later David Belasco, after seeing the
play, took it to New York, where he
made an extended stand. The great
success in New York caused Belasco
to stage it in London. Since the war San
Francisco has made several attempts for
return trips of the play and has only
been successful in getting one produc
tion.
The little Chinese drama is the classic
of all American Chinese plays, many sim
ilar sketches having been modeled from
"The First Born." and have met with
great success. The production of an Ori
ental play now is timely, for at present
there is an Oriental craze over the the
atre fans of the East.
Not only does the success of the play
lie in the life that the author involves
but the scenic arrangement is most prom
inent. Leland Pickering has charge of
all properties, and through his endeav
ors he has obtained the most pretentious
set of scenes which was used in the orig
inal production. Other properties will
be searched for in China Town of San
Francisco.
The producing of tTTe play will be un
der the charge of Gordon Davis, who at
one time played an important part in it
under the direction of Franklin Under
wood of the Belasco Company. Davis
says that "The First Born" is the most
realistic play in which lie has ever taken
part, and that its success at Stanford
will equal its previous rep
utation.
