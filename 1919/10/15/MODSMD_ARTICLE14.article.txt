# HATS OFF IN THE UNION
## 
### 
fTHE STANFORD UNION, the gathering place of students of all classes ami
groups, makes a request that seems both reasonable and timely. The
Hoard of Governors asks that the students take off their hats when entering
the Union, and that they refrain from using profane language at all times
while there. The latter request is perhaps unnecessary, for Stanford man
are gentlemen, and gentlemen do not use profane language in a place where
visitors may at any time drop in, and where ladies are ou many occasions
present. As to the hats, however, it has never been the'custom nere to take
them off in the Union, and the majority of the men here never think of it.
To show this respect to those who made this splendid addition to the campus
possible, and to lend a generally more refined air to the place, it is an execl
lent idea, and will without doubt be observed by the men. The Union should
be more than a meeting place for Stanford men. It should be a partial home
for the many who have no other affiliations on the campus, and as such
should be made to appear homelike. Hat racks have been installed, cigarette
trays have been placed at convenient places, and it is now up to the men
to take the hint. The rules do not force those who use the Union to do
these little things, but Stanford men are as a rule responsive to logical
requests decently given.
