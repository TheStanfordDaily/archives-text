Editor's Note.—The Daily Palo Alto
wishes to thank all members of the Uni
versity Student Body who_ have ad
dressed communications to it in reference
to the recent action of the Board of
Trustees on the tuition question. Lack
of space forbids publishing them all, but
each has been thoroughly read and con
sidered.

The joker of the whole thing is the
obviously hastily inserted clause which
allows a student to give his note in lieu
of tuition fee. The men this affects are
wholly or in part trying to work their
way through. It is possible that there
are more of these men than the trustees
count on. The "note" clause is a sort
of so p—a cure-all—thrown out to those
hard hit. But it is just these men who
are going to need a hand instead of a
handicap (of some $600!) when they
make a start. How long does it take
to save that amount —especially early in
the game? Have the trustees ever tried
it? The workings of the outside world
are somewhat different from the shel
tered provincialism of continuous aca
demic life.
Stanford has been known as a univer
sity where a man could, without great
difficulty, pay his own way—and for
this and kindred reasons has drawn a
type of student that has come to be
known as the "Stanford man." Appar
ently a change is to be forced by those
whose first interest should be to retain
this one good standard.
There seems to be fair reason for
doubt, if the powers that be had con
trolled their desire for war-time display,
that this increase would have been need
ed. If they had been a bit more eco
nomical in such small matters as a# huge
(and largely unused) Presidential Man
sion. which was built by Mulgardt of
P. P. I. E. fame, whose extravagance of
material and design is well known, and
who, in this case, apparently was given

carte blanch.
It is interesting to know that former
President Wheeler of California was
able to exist through his term of office
in a modest $20,000 house —in a univer
sity six times the size of Stanford, with
the resources of the State behind it.
We needed the library. But we didn't
need one badly enough to build it dur
ing times of exorbitant wages and cost
of material. We didn't need it badly
enough to cripple the finances of the
University and raise the tuition.
Professors' living expenses have gone
up. But what of students' expenses—
board, lodging, course fees, and what
not? Who is the worse hit of the two?
Clearly the only one to be benefitted are
the sons of the professors, who will be
able to pay their tuition from the increase
of the same. Unfortunately there are a
few who do not fit in here.
We offer the suggestion that the way
chosen assumes at least the appearance
of unfairness. And with this in mind,
the trustees, who studiously avoid even
the "appearance of evil," possibly may
discover some other way out.

Editor of the D. P. A.:
I do not believe that there is one dis
senting voice raised at the suggestion
that the salaries of the professors be in
creased. We all recognize this as a
long-needed reform and a part of the
great movement all over the country.
The main questions 011 which we dis
agree are the method of paying for these
increased salaries and the time that the
new system ought to go into effect.
Many students are speaking of the
"mismanagement of the University's af
fairs." It might bring about a better un
derstanding among the students if your
paper could publish an authoritative
statement of the financial status of the
University and an explanation of the
reasons for the present sudden and radi
cal change. Perhaps a financial state
ment can be found somewhere in the
library, but there seems to be a need for
a widely published statement of the exact
situation at the present lime.
