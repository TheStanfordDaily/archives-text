There can be little question that the
new system will work a great hardship
on all self-supporting students and many
others, and little doubt that many already
here will transfer to other universities,
and that others who had planned to come
here in the future will go elsewhere.
Stanford is crowded, and its policy seems
to be one of reducing the number of stu
dents, especially the underclassmen, by
excluding them from many courses and
raising fees in the beginning courses.
While the University probably will not
suffer directly by reducing its attendance,
a money basis of selection is not the best
way to weed out students. Mrs. Stan
ford did not say, "The moneyed children
of California shall be my children."
It is said that the University will take
the notes of self-supporting students. No
mention was made of interest on these
notes, but any student will hesitate to
sign notes for $480 in addition to what
he wotdd have to borrow under the
present system. Women expecting to
teach and men and women in other pro
fessions must have more than an A. B.
degree, and to obtain it they would have
to go even further into debt. A debt of
even $480 is a tremendous responsibility
for a young person just starting out in
his profession.
Had the University given one year's
notice the students could have made
their plans accordingly, but many stu
dents estimate their year's expenses be
fore they decide whether they can af
ford to come to college or not, and this
lack of warning breaks up all of their
arrangements. Once they have begun
the year's work, it is very bard to leave
it, perhaps in the midst of a continued
course. A number of students, although
they may not make a high percentage
of the total attendance, come to Stan
ford from a distance. In such a case
the railroad fare amounts to quite a sum,
so that it may be extremely inconven
ient for a student to leave the University
unexpectedly, and he is forced practi
cally to waste what he paid for trans
portation if he capnot afford to remain
and finish out the year.
Again, there are students who ex
pected to be graduated this year, â–  but
who cannot afford to stay under the
present system. They cannot transfer
to another University and be graduated
this year because nearly all universities
require the last three quarters work to
be done at the university where the
degree is conferred. It is, moreover, to
be noticed that a student cannot well
transfer to any university very near, be
cause of the difference between the se
mester and the quarter systems. Of
course a loyal student of Stanford does
not wish to go to the University of Cali
fornia or any other university than
Stanford, but in many cases it may be
come a necessity.
If so sudden and radical a change
was necessary, it seems to me that the
best kind of planning anci, foresight
would have found it out a month or
more earlier, in order that the students
might have been warned before they
returned to Stanford this fall.
Very sincerely,
Opal Garrett, '20.
