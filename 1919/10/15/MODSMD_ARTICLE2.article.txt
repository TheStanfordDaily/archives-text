Professor W. F. Durand of the En
gineering Department, who has recent
ly returned from France, gave an illus
trated lecture upon "The Devastated Re
gions of France" in the Little Theatre
last night.
"To convey an adequate idea of the
devastated regions as a whole," said Pro
fessor Durand, "is a hopeless task. In
one evening I can only show you sam

pictures of the war zone into two
groupsâ€”one which he called "types,"
or those which were more typical than
special, and a second class of views of
places of peculiar interest in themselves,
as Verdun, the Argonne sector, and
Chateau Thierry. P.esides a stupen
dous amount of greatly damaged struc
tures, he showed many typical churches
and even entire villages in the war zone
which had been completely destroyed.
