Professor W. F. Durand of the En
gineering Department, who has recent
ly returned from France, gave an illus
trated lecture upon "The Devastated Re
gions of France" in the Little Theatre
last night.
"To convey an adequate idea of the
devastated regions as a whole," said Pro
fessor Durand, "is a hopeless task. In
one evening I can only show you sam
ples." Professor Durand divided his
pictures of the war zone into two
groupsâ€”one which he called "types,"
or those which were more typical than
special, and a second class of views of
places of peculiar interest in themselves,
as Verdun, the Argonne sector, and
Chateau Thierry. P.esides a stupen
dous amount of greatly damaged struc
tures, he showed many typical churches
and even entire villages in the war zone
which had been completely destroyed.
On the Rheims Cathedral alone, of
which there were several slides, the
damage replacement has been estimated
at SO,(XX), 000 francs and sixteen years
of labor.
According to Professor Durand the
region away from the front seemed little
affected upon superficial glance, although
upon looking closer one could see that
the only inhabitants were women, chil
dren, old men, and a few specimens of
human destruction. He said that Paris
was reminded of the war for the most
part by the bombing raids, by the bom
bardment by long-range guns and by the
darkening of the city because of the air
raids. He pointed out, however, that the
results of these were small in propor
tion to the size of the city, for the total
casualties were 256 killed and 620
wounded. In spite of the constant dan
ger, the morale of the people in Paris
was not weakened.
