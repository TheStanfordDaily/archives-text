# BOXING SEASON OPENS WITH GOOD PROSPECTS
## 
### 
Boxing has started this year with
the largest enrollment in the history
of the course. There are now a total
of ninety-seven men registered under
Instructors Maloney and Murphy. It
was necessary to divide this number
into three classes so that the proper
progress could be made.
Instructor Murphy is ultimately
working toward a team that will de
feat the California mit-wielders both
in the Varsity and the Freshman
classes. As a preparatory step to the
big meet, an inter-fraternity-inter-club,
and an inter-class meet will be held,
when the classes are well under way.
Murphy has also planned a triangle
meet with the University of California
and the Olympic Club, to materialize
after the preliminary meets.
The Cardinal lost its star heavy
weight in Howell, but there is a lot
of good material to fill his shoes. The
members of last year's team who are
back are Robert Boucher, 118 lbs;
Jack Boucher, 118 lbs; "Shorty"
Mandel, 128 lbs.
