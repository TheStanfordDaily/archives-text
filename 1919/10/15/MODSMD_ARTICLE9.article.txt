A Bad Practice

I EADERS in the Stanford student
body have done the one thing that
should result in some action favorable
to the students on the part of the
Board of Trustees. The letter, pub
lished in the news columns of the
Daily Palo Alto tonight, which was
sent to the Board of Trustees this
afternoon, will show them that the
representative men and women of
Stanford are opposed to the principle
of charging tuition, but may become
reconciled to this change in the Uni
versity's policy if they are sure that
economic pressure has made it a ne
cessity, and that they are absolutely
opposed to the injustice that will be
done to the students now in college
if this rule is put into effect before
October of 1920. A petition from the
whole student body to the Board
would have carried considerable force,
but the Board will be able to better
understand the sentiment and feeling
of the students when they consider the
letter sent to them today.
The men and women who signed
the request felt that they were truly
representing their organizations, and
signed willingly because they knew
the present conditions, they knew
what the installing of the pay system
in January would mean to Stanford,
and they wanted to do what they
could to prevent it.
The students will expect to hear
from the Board of Trustees within a
short time, and if proper consideration
is given to the existing conditions by
the Board, they will hear favorably,
or will receive an excellent explana
tion for the Board's refusal to grant
their request.
There is one point that so far has
received little notice, that to us is a
vital one in principal. The Board of
Trustees announce that they will re
ceive a student's note for the amount
of the tuition fees in case the student
is hard pressed financially. We believe
that the open encouragement of stu
dents signing promissory notes for
large sums of money when they have
no security is a bad practice. We
can understand cases where men loan
students enough money to go through
university upon personal security, but
these are but are individual cases.
The fact that the Board of Trustees
makes this announcement is proof that
they realize that the tuition fees will
be a great hardship to many students.
They know that Stanford has been a
democratic institution, where poor
boys and girls have attended as well
as rich, and they recognize that the
tuition system will have a decided
tendency to change this. To counter
act this, they make the offer of a
large loan. Morally, this is not a
good principle, and one that we regret
to see openly offered the students by
those who should be doing their ut
most to protect them against debt,
as well as other things.
