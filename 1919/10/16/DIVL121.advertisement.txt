WHAT man doesn't like his pipe? There's nothing whets
your smoke desires like seeing a good pipe lying around.
Because you know that in it is the only real smoke satisfaction.
Your appetite will be doubly whetted if it is a W D C, because in
WDC Pipes all the sweetness and mellowness of the genuine
French briar is brought out by our own special seasoning process.
Then, too, \V D C Pipes are good to look at. The designs are
pleasing and workmanship perfect. You'll agree with us that our
craftsmen are accomplishing their purpose —to make pipes that
are without peers in all the world. Ask any good dealer. Be
sure and look for the Triangle trademark. It's a guarantee against
cracking or burning through.
