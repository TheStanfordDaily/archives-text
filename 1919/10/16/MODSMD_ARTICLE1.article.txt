# HERBERT HOOVER ACCEPTS RESPONSIBILITY FOR TUITION RULING AND SUPPORTS MOVE
## Communication to "Daily" Praises Its Frank Stand 
### 
WIR. HERBERT HOOVER, '95, mem
ber of the Board of Trustees of
Leland Stanford Junior University, in
a letter addressed to the Editor of
the Daily Palo Alto today assumed
responsibility for taking the lead in
the recent action of the Board of
Trustees in deciding to dharge tuition
to students.
Mr. Hoover's letter is in full as fol
lows:
Stanford University, Cal.,
October 16, 1919.
Kditor Daily Palo Alto:
Dear Sir: As you have invited dis
cussion in your columns regarding the
imposition of tuition fees in the Uni
versity, perhaps you woidd accord me
also space in this matter. It is also up
to me to assume at once the sole re
sponsibility for this recent action taken
by the Trustees. I have been its ad
vocate for the past six years, and Presi
dent Wilbur has been able to agree only
in the last extremity.
I have always found the best under
standing to be reached in such matters
by utter frankness, and as I admire the
directness with which your journal has
approached this subject, you will per
haps forgive me if I also mark some
suggestions with emphasis.
The Need For. More Income
The physical fact is that the income
of this University from its endowment
lias reached its practical maximum. The
outside lands have been converted into
interest-bearing investments, and the
only remaining asset of possible expan
sive value is the Palo Alto Farm; this
will be a moderate accretion and cannot
come into play for many years. The
present income available after necessary
depreciation is about $1,100,000 per an
num, and in the struggle of the Trustees
to avoid the imposition of tuition fees,
the expenditures have continuously over
run the income during the past five
years. During this period the full ex
penditures and receipts of the University
endowment have been published to the
students, and all who object could read
and ponder.
At the same time an endeavor has
been made to maintain the high grade of
the institution, and in an effort to bring
expenditure within income the Trustees
have already limited the number of stu
dents ; and thus we witness young men
and women today deprived of education
because with this limitation the Uni
versity facilities of the west are in
sufficient. Yet even if we do not in
crease the number of students, there
must be an increase of academic ex
penditure year by year. The University
must expand in its scientific equipment
and in its teaching staff with the growth
of knowledge. If it fails to steadily
improve in these particulars, it must be
come stagnant—and a stagnant uni
versity is on the down-grade.
Aside from this general problem, the
increased admissions agreed to by the
Trustees in order to accommodate re
turning soldiers have woefully over
crowded the housing facilities of the
campus, and unless the University re
duces the number of students far be
low the present level, expenditure must
be taken in hand to increase these
facilities.
Beyond these questions, however, two
economic changes have brought into the
field entirely new problems of even mor».
pressing issue. The first of these changes

is the depreciation of the dollar by
which the University income today has
nothing like the equal purchasing power
of 1914. A greatly increased expendi
ture is imposed upon the Trustees for
maintenance of grounds and buildings,
purchase of scientific instruments,
wherein we must compete with the price
levels of the country. During this time
with an increase of 100 per cent in price
levels the salaries of our professors have
not been increased, it having been the
constant hope of the Trustees that prices
would show some tendency to decline
with peace. In the meantime, the Trus
tees have, not only with regard to the
faculty but also with regard to the stu
dents, maintained the charges for rent
and service at practically the same fig
ure as pre-war, and have done this only
at considerable losses, but with the view
that they could thus contribute to keep
down the cost of living. The result is
that the students are not in these par
ticulars today contributing as large a
proportion of the upkeep of the institu
tion as they were before the war.
We have however reached a point
where, if we wish to retain instructors
in the University of the character and
grade which we now possess, we must
meet their minimum necessities at once,
although the increases in salaries pro
posed are less than one quarter of the
ratio rise in prices. Neither students
nor Trustees have any right to impose
the extraordinary sacrifice on the faculty
which they have undergone during the
past year. I do not assume that any
man or woman of self-esteem wishes
to receive instruction through the hard
ship of his teachers; this is a form of
charity that every student will resent.
There is another factor in this prob
lem. and that is that the increasing
premiums paid in the United States for
intelligence and intellectual skill have
put the University at a great disad
vantage in securing the type of men that
its departments require. We have lost
and were about to lose more of our able
men to other universities that are today
paying a higher ratio of salary, and to
commercial institutions that pay from
two to five times the remuneration for
men of the capacity that make up our
faculty. It is true that, owing to the
stability of position and the devotion
of the profession, the University does
not need to offer in full terms the
money equivalent of possible earnings in
commercial life. It must, however, meet
competition to a sufficient degree to
maintain the character and grade of the
institution. Any other course would
be a fraud upon students and the com
munity.
To sum up. the University must have
an increase of income of approximately
$200,000 per annum to enable it to bal
ance its budget, to take care of the
increased salaries necessary, and to
maintain its natural growth. It seems
to me that there has been a general
agreement of this necessity, and that all
discussion has revolved around the
source from which such addition to in
come could be obtained.
Sources of Increased Income
To my certain knowledge, this ques
tion of increasing the University income
beyond the earnings of the endowment
has been the foremost problem in front
of the Trustees during the past ten
years. It is no new discovery. During
this time four main lines of suggestion
have been brought forward:
First, that the University should ac
quire more gifts. This is easy to say,
but the experience of the years of
earnest begging, not only of the alumni
but of the public and of other institu
tions, has shown only negligible results,
considering the amount required. The
older endowed institutions are sup
ported as to from 75 to 95 per cent,

from tuition of their students and gifts
from their alumni. Stanford has not,
hitherto, secured over five per cent from
these sources. The alumni is still young,
and is not very numerous; and some
of the older members, like some of the
students, appear impregnated with the
idea that education in this particular
institution imposes no obligation of re
turn support. In any event, any alumnus
who feels strongly that no tuition should
be charged has it in his power to pay
the tuition of somebody by way of re
turn for his own benefits.
During the last five years numerous
journeys of our officials and friends in
the endeavor to secure endowment gifts
and thus avoid tuition fees have always
developed one form of criticism, and
that is that a portion of students or their
families who can well afford to pay are
not carrying their share of the load in
the University.
The second line of suggestion is that
we should further reduce the number of
students, this to be accomplished either
by way of sheer reduction of entrance or
by elimination of the first two years' in
struction. In view of the positive short
age of educational facilities that exists in
the United States, this course of action
would simply result in debarring even
larger numbers of young people from op
portunity of education because others
who could well afford to pay, either at
present or out of their future earnings,
are to insist that they alone should have
the privileges of education.
The third line of suggestion has been
to reduce expenses generally. This is
the usual suggestion of the uninformed
mind, and the only specific criticisms
that we have heard revolve around cur
tailment of expense Tn care of the Uni
versity grounds. If we were to abandon
the entire upkeep of the grounds, al
lowing the lawns and 1 trees to rot, we
might provide $25000 per annum toward
the $200,000 that we require. It may in
terest students to know that the entire
cost of managing the income properties
of the University, which yield $1,100,000
per annum, does not exceed $20,000 per
annum, and this is simply because of the
voluntary service given by the Trustees
to the University,
The fourth- suggestion, and the one
adopted, was that tuition should be
charged. *" This was not decided upon
after a few hours of chance discussion,
hut goes back over fifteen years and was
participated in by Mrs. Stanford her
self. To some students, Mrs. Stanford's
later expressions on this subject may
come as a surprise, for she reached the
conclusion that great gifts without an
obligation to make some return, either
lirectly or by pledge to afford others
the same opportunities, lower the sense
if responsibility, and herself proposed
that tuition should be charged whenever
•he Trustees should agree that it was
necessary in order to maintain the effi
ciency and continue the expansion of the
institution.
In the discussion o" tuition, the inci
lental fees of $20 per quarter as a part
contribution to light, heat, associated
student enterprises, clubhouse, guild and
gymnasium, have been confused with
