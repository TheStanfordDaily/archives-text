# STARTING WELL
## 
### 
STANFORD STUDENTS showed the skeptics yesterday that there will be
no question as to how the football team will be supported this year, and
that although the American game is comparatively strange to most of the
football followers here, their interest is already aroused, and their educa
tion as to the fine points well on the way towards completion. For the first
time in a number of years, over fifteen hundred spectators packed the root
ing sections of the stands at a mid-week game. The turnout was a surprise
even to the most optimistic, and the Stanford football team responded natur
ally to the spirit of the bleachers.
Yesterday was just a start. It was the first game, and doubtless many
attended because of the novelty. Will these people come the next time?
We think that they will. The whole spirit of the University has been
aroused again, and football will be the leader in bringing back to the
campus the enthusiasm that existed before the abolition of the pigskin
contests with the University of California. Yesterday's showing is one that
Stanford may well be proud of, but it should not be the unusual. The
bleachers should be filled in the same manner at the other mid-week games,
and of course the Saturday contests will draw not only from the University,
but from the outside. We have, rejuvenated a sport that was almost
"verboten" to mention for some ten years, and the very fact of its long
suppression, has made its reentry the more enthusiastic. In the hope that
the students who are unfamiliar with American football, become better ac
quainted with its fundamentals, and even in some cases, its fine points, the
Daily Palo Alto is running every day or so, some of the rules taken from
Spalding's Official Guide. It is every student's duty to understand this game
that was once a part of the very being of every Stanford man and woman,
for to be successful on the field, an intelligent understanding of the game
by the spectators, many of whom may be players in the future, is essential.
We have started the season well. Let us be sure to follow this start with
an increased support, and an even greater enthusiasm.
