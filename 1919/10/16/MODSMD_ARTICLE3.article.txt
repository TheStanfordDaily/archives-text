## Protest Unanswered 
### 
riIHE DAILY PALO ALTO considers it
an honor that Mr. Herbert Hoover,
Stanford's greatest alumnus, should
send the students, through us, the
communication which we publish to
day in our news columns. It sheds
new light on some topics, previously
kept in the dark, and the students
will unquestionably read with inter
est every word that Mr. Hoover has
to say about Stanford, its past and
present policies, and especially about
the burning topic of the day, the im
posing of tuition fees upon the stu
dents by the Board of Trustees.
Mr. Hoover clearly explains to us
the reason why the Board decided to
adopt the system of tuition fees, which
changes the status of Stanford from a
free institution to that of a pay col
lege. In our editorial columns we
have expressed regret that this should
be done, but have admitted that the
Board of Trustees must have consider
ed the matter seriously before tak
ing the step. Our protest has been
directed against the installing of the
system within one year, because we
believe this to be unjust to the men
and women now in Stanford who
entered the University under another
impression. Mr. Hoover fails to even
refer to this phase of the situation in
his letter. Therefore, as he is a mem
br of the Board of Trustees, we can
consider the question most vital to us
still unexplained. Perhaps the letter
sent yesterday to the Board by a num
ber of prominent Stanford students
will bring better results.
Mr. Hoover says that the Board has
known of the serious financial situa
tion of the University for some time,
and that the system of tuition fees
has been under consideration for a
number of years. Obviously, the plan
of completely changing Stanford's old
policy was a surprise only to those
not on the inside. The fact that stu
dents were allowed to register here

under the assumption that there would
be no tuition fees, and that they are
now in a very bad position as a re
sult of the change without warning,
is the main bone of contention. Our
letter to the Board of Trustees does
not request that the Board change its
decision as regards the adoption of
tuition fees; we know that this point
is lost forever. It requests that the
fees not be charged until October
of 1920. Mr. Hoover has evidently
misunderstood our contention, but his
explanations of the causes for this
drastic change are welcomed by the
whole student body, and the Daily
Palo Alto wishes to express their ap
preciation for his interest.
