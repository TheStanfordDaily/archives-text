# NEW ORCHESTRA TO BE CONDUCTED BY WARREN ALLEN
## 
### 
With Mr." Warren D. Allen, the Uni
versity organist, consenting to lead the
proposed student orchestra, plans for this
organization are assuming definite shape.
The orchestra is to be composed of men
and women students, and it is hoped to
secure enough different instruments to
form a well-rounded-out instrumenta
tion.
Violas and basses are especially desir
able, and wood-winds and orchestral
brass are equally essential. Any stu
dent who participates in this orchestra
will be expected to give one evening a
week, probably Wednesday from 7:30
to 9:30, for practice. Anyone desiring to
try out will communicate with Profes
sor A. C. (Whitaker of the Economics
Department, stating their instrument.
