# VARSITY SMOTHERS U.S.S. BOSTON'S ELEVEN-59 TO 0
## FRESHMEN TAKE FIELD IN LAST QUARTER Almost Three Cardinal Teams Participate In the First Victory of Year 
### 
4 MERTCAN football started off its
revival at Stanford yesterday after
noon by the varsity defeating the U. S. S.
Boston eleven 59 to 0 in three-quarters,
and the freshmen scoring 19 points to 0
in one-quarter, the total score amount
ing to 78 to 0. Dispite the fact that
the varsity has only been in one scrim
mage contest this season, the scoring
machine was able to work together and
cross the navy line almost at will.
The Cardinal line ,although less ex
perienced than their opponents, was able
to repel the line bucking tactics of the
sailors, and to stop the navy backs with
out gain. The Stanford backfield men,
the aid of good interference, were able
to gain either through the line or round
the ends. Campbell, Holt, Bonney and
Wark repeatedly made ten and fifteen
yards every time they took the ball.
Touchdown in Five Minutes
Bonney made the first touchdown in
the first five minutes of play as a result
of a series of end runs, varied with line
bucks. During the three quarters, Bon
ney made three touchdowns, Holt two,
Levy two, Pelouze one and Reynolds
one.
Brilliant open field running by Wark,
Holt, Bonney, and Reynolds character
ized parts of the game. The Cardinal
interference was able to break a way
for the backs and the navy men did not
make effective tackles. Some of the
long gains reached lifty and sixty yards.
Freshmen Take Field
After the third period the freshman
team took the field against the Boston
men. Douglas was the main factor in
the 19 points that the "babes" scorccf
against the sailors. Coach Acker was
unable to use some of his best men be
cause of minor injuries. The freshmen
lined up as follows: Papasian, le;
Cravens, It; DeGroute, lg; Rice, c;
ITelser, rg; Pollard, rt; Pollard, re;
I rego, qb; Douglas, lh; Creglow, fb;
Osborn, rh.
Both coaches used as many as possible
in the game. Although there were
numerous faults in the backfields and in
the lines, both Evans and Acker are
satisfied with the showing made by their
men.
