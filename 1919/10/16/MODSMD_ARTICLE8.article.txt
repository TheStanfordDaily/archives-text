# VARSITY SMOTHERS U.S.S. BOSTON'S ELEVEN-59 TO 0
## FRESHMEN TAKE FIELD IN LAST QUARTER Almost Three Cardinal Teams Participate In the First Victory of Year 
### 
4 MERTCAN football started off its
revival at Stanford yesterday after
noon by the varsity defeating the U. S. S.
Boston eleven 59 to 0 in three-quarters,
and the freshmen scoring 19 points to 0
in one-quarter, the total score amount
ing to 78 to 0. Dispite the fact that
the varsity has only been in one scrim
mage contest this season, the scoring
machine was able to work together and
cross the navy line almost at will.
The Cardinal line ,although less ex
perienced than their opponents, was able
to repel the line bucking tactics of the
sailors, and to stop the navy backs with
out gain. The Stanford backfield men,
the aid of good interference, were able
to gain either through the line or round
the ends. Campbell, Holt, Bonney and
Wark repeatedly made ten and fifteen
yards every time they took the ball.
Touchdown in Five Minutes
Bonney made the first touchdown in
the first five minutes of play as a result
of a series of end runs, varied with line

ney made three touchdowns, Holt two,
Levy two, Pelouze one and Reynolds
one.
Brilliant open field running by Wark,
Holt, Bonney, and Reynolds character

interference was able to break a way
for the backs and the navy men did not
make effective tackles. Some of the
long gains reached lifty and sixty yards.
