# PROTEST ON TUITION IS REFERRED TO DR. WILBUR
## TRUSTEES SEND ANSWER President Will Interview the Signers of Request For Delay of Charge 
### 
IN answer to the letter, signed by stu
dents representing the various cam
pus activities, protesting the action of
the Board of Trustees in imposing this
year a tuition fee of $40 in addition to
the incidental fee of $20, the Board has
notified the student body president,
Frank King, '19, that the matter has
been referred to President Wilbur.
The students protested against the
new tuition fee, claiming that it would
destroy the democracy of Stanford, and
requesting that the action be delayed
at least until October of 1920 on ac
count of the hardship which it might
work on students at present registered
in the University.
The Trustee's letter, which states that
Dr. Wilbur will discuss the matter with
the students, follows:
October 16, 1919.
Mr. Frank L. King, President,
Associated Students,
Stanford University, California.
Dear Sir:
I acknowledge receipt of a com
munication, dated October 15th, and
signed by you and the presidents of
the various student organizations
on the campus in relation to the
charging of tuition fees commenc
ing January 1st.
This entire matter has been re
ferred to President Wilbur, who, I
have no doubt, will be glad to dis
cuss this matter more fully with
you, if desired.
Very truly yours,
LS: EL Secretary.
Leon Sloss,
Dr. Wilbur informed the Daily Palo
Alto this morning that he would be glad
if those students who signed the letter
to the Board of Trustees would make
an appointment with him for a time
early next week when he would explain
the whole situation to them. These stu
dents will then be able to inform the
student body the true state of affairs in
their entirety, and of the President's
decision as regards the possibility of
postponing the payment of tuition fees
until next October.
