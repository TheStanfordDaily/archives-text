# IDEALS OF FOUNDERS IS SUBJECT OF DR. JORDAN'S LECTURE
## 
### 
Dr. David Starr Jordan will speak
to the Freshmen men on the subject
of "The Founders' Ideals and History
of Stanford University," at the As
sembly Hall, Monday evening, at 7:30.
The talk will be of an informal nature
and will briefly sketch that part of
Stanford tradition with which Dr.
Jordan was personally familiar. It is
to be the first of a number of talks
along similar lines which are to be
given from time to time by prominent
men on the campus, in connection
with the Y. M. C. A.'s new course,
"Stanford Standards for 1923."
It has been felt for some time that
the difficulty of acquainting the new
students with a proper knowledge of
Stanford traditions and customs could
be best met by a series of talks on the
same, and the "Y" has therefore ar
ranged this course with that end in
view. Plans are being made to form
groups which can discuss University
problems in an informal way. These
are to be conducted by upperclassmen,
a number of whom have already signi
fied their intention of giving their full
support to the project.
