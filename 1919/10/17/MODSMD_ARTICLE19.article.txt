TIHE BOARD OF TRUSTEES has referred the whole matter of tuition fees
* back to the President of the University. Probably the Board feels that
those students who signed the letter to it had, to use the army terminology,
"failed to stay in the proper channels," and then again, it may be that they
consider that the President of the University is the best informed upon the
local conditions that effect the whole question. We are all one family here
at Stanford, working together for the same ends, and in ordinary circum
stances the students would go to the head of our University to settle our
difficulties. In this instance, the students felt that a great change was
instituted in their family, and instead of them finding it out through the head,
the information came to them through San Francisco newspapers. How
much of this whole difficulty could have been settled had the Board of
Trustees' action been withheld from the public press, and an assembly
called last Monday? Here our family head could have explained the situation
to the students. This consideration would have been appreciated, and per
haps much of our misunderstandings straightened out at first. We only
bring up this point to show why the letter of protest was originally sent to
the Board of Trustees and not to our President. Even though an assembly
had been called, a request for an extension of time might still be the
students' bone of contention.
This question will without doubt be answered by Dr. Wilbur early next
week when he meets those who signed the letter to the Board of Trustees.
He has expressed himself as willing to answer all questions put to him as
regards this issue and anything else that these representative students may
desire to know. The Board has vested the whole responsibility in him, and
he will be able to tell this group whether a postponement of the installation
of the tuition system until next October is possible. It now seems that the
University must have approximately $75,000 before January 1, 1920>, and if
any possible way can be suggested to secure this other than taxing the
present student body for it, the postponement will be granted.
