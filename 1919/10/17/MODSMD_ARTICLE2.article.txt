# Babes Will Play Santa Clara Team
## Coach Acker Will Use As Many Men As Possible In the Game 
### 
With its first game scheduled for
Saturday with the second varsity of the
Santa Clara University, the freshman
football team is fast rounding into form.
The squad has been worked down to
about thirty men and from this lot
Coach Acker hopes to form a perfect
running machine that will give the Cali
fornia babes a hard game 011 Novem
ber 15.
Several men on the squad are inex
perienced at the American game, and it
will take considerable work for them to
get into the best of form. Saturday's
game will give the babes their first taste
of real battle. Every man on the squad
will probably be given an opportunity to
play in order to sec how he will conduct
himself in a game.
The following men are now showing
up well at the different positions:
Centers, Rice, Long, and Faville;
guards, Downs, De Groot, Helser, Pol
lard, and Miller; tackles, MacAlpinc,
Cravens, Johnson, and Helser; ends,
Sproull, Papazian. Reed, Austin, Mar
wedelt, Farish, Vial, and Kraft; backs,
Creglow, Warner, Osborn, Holt, Doug
lass, Trago, Mohr, Clark, and Winship.
Due to minor injuries, Sproull and Mac-
Alpinc were not able to play in the
game with the U. S. S. Boston.
