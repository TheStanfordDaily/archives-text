Stanford University, Oct. 16, 1919.
Editor-in-Chief, The Daily Palo Alto,
Stanford University, Calif. Dear Sir:
—The recent action of the Board of
Trustees in declaring a tuition fee for
this University, has created a serious
dilemma, the horns of which reach
out viciously to strike at many mem
bers of the Student Body, or to work
injustice to an over-taxed and under
paid faculty.
This dilemma may be totally elimin
ated by the adoption of a different,
plan, which will not only bring
justice to all concerned, but will be
quite in keeping with our form of
government.
Instead of the tuition fee as plan
ned, I propose that the Board of
Trustes raise the sum required, adopt
and put into execution at the begin
ning of the fall term, October 1, 1920,
what may be termed a progressive
income tax on the allowances and
personal incomes of students attend
ing this University.
Every student, thereby, when reg
istering would be required to declare
under oath his monthly income, falsity
of which would be punished by ex
pulsion.
The student whose allowance is but
?60.00 a month should be exempted
from any tuition fee, just as the
Federal Government exempts all in

comes under $2,000.00, while the stu
dent receiving monthly from $60.00 to
$75.00 should pay a small tuition fee,
increasing up the scale, so 1 at the
student who is recepient of large
income would pay a fee in, i erhaps,
in excess of forty dollars.
This plan our own Government con
siders justice for all its citizens, and
there is no reason why it should not
be adopted here, if in a slightly dif
ferent way. Thereby the many stu
dents who are nob about to be forced
to either seek other institutions of
learning, or give up their university
work, will be allowed to remain, the
wealthy students should not, and as
Stanford men and women, will not
complain, and the faculty will receive
justice long denied.
There is a second fallacy in the
plan declared by the Board of Trus
tees.
It is plain that faculty incomes are
to be raised not for any meritorious
services, but to meet the high cost of
living. Therefore, the professor who
now receives $4,500 a year may be a
single man, and well able to support
himself on his present income, and to
increase his salary by any set scale
will merely be a luxurious surplusage
to him, while the instructor who now
may receive only a paltry $1,800.00
per annum and have a wife and several
children, will under the same set scale
be increased only a few hundred dol
lars a year, which amount will still
be totally insufficient to meet his
necessary living expenses.

It should be the paramount duty of
the Board of Trustees to make the
proposed salary increases conform to
justice for each person to be thus
benefited, and a committee should be
appointed to make awards for salary
increases, not on a set scale but with
regard to the merits of each nidividual
case, thereby in turn needing less fees
from the students.
I ardently hope that the Daily Palo
Alto will lend its good offices for the
accomplishment of the foregoing pro
posals, and thereby set a standard for
others to follow.
I am, very truly yours,
LEWIS HAYD LEVE.

what may be termed a progressive
income tax on the allowances and
personal incomes of students attend
ing this University.
Every student, thereby, when reg
istering would be required to declare
under oath his monthly income, falsity
of which would be punished by ex
pulsion.
The student whose allowance is but
?60.00 a month should be exempted
from any tuition fee, just as the
Federal Government exempts all in

comes under $2,000.00, while the stu
dent receiving monthly from $60.00 to
$75.00 should pay a small tuition fee,
increasing up the scale, so 1 at the
student who is recepient of large
income would pay a fee in, i erhaps,
in excess of forty dollars.
This plan our own Government con
siders justice for all its citizens, and
there is no reason why it should not
be adopted here, if in a slightly dif
ferent way. Thereby the many stu
dents who are nob about to be forced
to either seek other institutions of
learning, or give up their university
work, will be allowed to remain, the
wealthy students should not, and as
Stanford men and women, will not
complain, and the faculty will receive
justice long denied.
There is a second fallacy in the
plan declared by the Board of Trus
tees.
It is plain that faculty incomes are
to be raised not for any meritorious
services, but to meet the high cost of
living. Therefore, the professor who
now receives $4,500 a year may be a
single man, and well able to support
himself on his present income, and to
increase his salary by any set scale
will merely be a luxurious surplusage
to him, while the instructor who now
may receive only a paltry $1,800.00
per annum and have a wife and several
children, will under the same set scale
be increased only a few hundred dol
lars a year, which amount will still
be totally insufficient to meet his
necessary living expenses.

It should be the paramount duty of
the Board of Trustees to make the
proposed salary increases conform to
justice for each person to be thus
benefited, and a committee should be
appointed to make awards for salary
increases, not on a set scale but with
regard to the merits of each nidividual
case, thereby in turn needing less fees
from the students.
I ardently hope that the Daily Palo
Alto will lend its good offices for the
accomplishment of the foregoing pro
posals, and thereby set a standard for
others to follow.

Editor-in-Chief, The Daily Palo Alto,
Stanford University, Calif. Dear Sir:
—The recent action of the Board of
Trustees in declaring a tuition fee for
this University, has created a serious
dilemma, the horns of which reach
out viciously to strike at many mem
bers of the Student Body, or to work
injustice to an over-taxed and under
paid faculty.
This dilemma may be totally elimin
ated by the adoption of a different,
plan, which will not only bring
justice to all concerned, but will be
quite in keeping with our form of
government.
Instead of the tuition fee as plan
ned, I propose that the Board of
Trustes raise the sum required, adopt
and put into execution at the begin
ning of the fall term, October 1, 1920,
what may be termed a progressive
income tax on the allowances and
personal incomes of students attend
ing this University.
