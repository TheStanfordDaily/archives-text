# JAZZ TO FEATURE "STUNTS" DANCE
## 
### 
Music by Tommy Reynold's jazz
orchestra is announced as the feature of
the big game "Stunts" dance Saturday
night, at the new Encina Club floor.
Football men may dance until 10 :30.
The committee believes the incentive
to furnish funds for bleacher novelties
on November 22d should bring out a
large crowd tomorrow evening.
An admission of $1.10 will be charged,
and all the proceeds will go to the big
game stunts committee, which guaran
tees to make every effort to make the
big game a better one.
