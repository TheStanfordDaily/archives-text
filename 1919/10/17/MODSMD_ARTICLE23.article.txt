# NEW PLAN FOR TENNIS SCHEDULES ANNOUNCED HERE
## 
### 
Stanford students interested in tennis
will have the opportunity of witnessing
the best in tennis that the state has to
offer, according to the plans of Allyn
Barber, '17. At least once a week a
team will be invited up from San Fran
cisco to play exhibition matches in sin
gles and doubles. A local team will be
decided on which is to meet the visitors
on these occasions.
William Johnston, national singles
champion; Willis Davis, national clay
court champion; "Peck" Griffin, thrice
national doubles champion; Roland Rob
erts and other Californians of national
note will be seen in action if the plans
carry. It will take several matches to
decide the men who will be picked to
meet the San Franciscans in doubles.
It is therefore planed to hold a series
of matches on the Encina courts. The
first of these takes places to-morrow aft
ernoon at 4:30, "Skce" Turner and
Allyn Barber meeting "Jim" Davies and
Neer. Other matches will then be played
to decide the best team to place in the
meet with the noted visitors. This ar
rangement should add to the strength
of the Cardinal team as well as afford the
men a chance to see how they stand with
the premier racquet wielders of the coun
try.
