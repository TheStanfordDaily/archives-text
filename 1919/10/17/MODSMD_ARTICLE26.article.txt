# COACH ISSUES CALL FOR '23 SOCCERITES
## 
### 
The following communication hoi
been received by the Editor from As
sistant Soccer Coach, J. A. Quinby:
There has always been a tradition in
the Stanford athletic world to the ef
fect that when an emergency existed
men came forward to meet it. They
haven't always filled it successfully, but
they have always done their utmost to
place the Cardinal where it belongs—in
the lead.
At the present time, a grave emergency
exists in the field of soccer—freshman
soccer, to be exact. C. Coulter, coach
of the University of California soccer
ites, has sent a challenge to the Farm
for a game between the first-year men
of the two institutions. The challenge
has been accepted, and it is up to the
class of '23 to turn out and built a team
that will live up to Stanford's soccer
traditions. H. W. Maloney, President
of the University and Club Soccer
League, has promised to schedule Sat
urday games for the freshmen, alter
nating on and off the campus, in order
to put them in trim for their set-to with
California. During the Christmas holi
days a team composed of picked men
from the varsity and freshman aggre
gations will make a tour of the North
west and Canadian cities. With prospects
such as these there should be no diffi
culty in filling the ranks of the squad.
Any man, big or little, can play soccer.
It demands but average intelligence to
learn the rules of the game, and if the
candidate has a fair amount of nerve
and a little experience in other forms
of athletics, there is nothing to keep him
from a place on the team. It is to be
hoped that the men of '23 will take this
appeal to heart and seize the oppor
tunity to push themselves and their Uni
versity another notch forward in the
realm of athletics. Report to Mr. Ma
loney any time at the gymnasium or to
Jim Quinby from 4 till 6 any evening at
Soccer Field No. 1.
James Quinby,
Assistant Soccer Coach.
