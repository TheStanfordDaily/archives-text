## 
### 
Printers' strikes in the east have made
it impossible for publishers to supply
promptly a large number of the books
now in demamnd for the autumn stocks,
according to an announcement made by
the Stanford llookstore today. The
books will be shipped as quickly as
possible, but it is probable that many
will not arrive for several weeks.
Among the books which arc delayed
arc Holleman & Walker, "Organic
Chemistry"; Marks & Davis "Steam
Tables"; and Tracy, "Plane Surveying."
Johnson &- Van Metre, "Railroad
Transportation" has been forwarded by
mail and is due some time next week.
