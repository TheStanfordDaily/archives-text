To familiarize the Stanford Com
munity with the American game, the
Daily Palo Alto is running from day
to day, selections from the 1919
American football rules.
A Kick-off is the term used to desig
nate the opening play of the first and
third periods, and it shall consist of a
place-kick from the 40-yard line of the
team entitled to kick.
After a goal from the field and after
a try-at-goal following touchdown, the
ball must be put in play by a kick-off.
A Punt is made by dropping the ball
from the hand or hands and kicking it
before it touches the ground.
A Punt-out is a punt made by a player
of the side which has made a touchdown
to another of his own side for a fair
catch.
A Drop-kick is made by dropping the
ball from the hand or hands and kicking
it the instant it rises From the ground.
A Free kick is any kick when the op
ponents are restrained by rule from ad
vancing beyond a certain point before the
ball is put in play, and includes kick-off,
punt-out, kick from a fair catch, and
place-kick for goal after a touchdown.
Snapping the ball is putting it back
from its position on the ground with one
quick and continuous motion of the hand
or hands, the ball actually leaving the
hands on this motion.
A Scrimmage takes place when the
holder of the ball places it flat upon the
ground, witli its long axis at right angles
to the line of scrimmage, and puts it in
play by snapping it back. The scrimmage
does not end until the ball is dead.
If the snapper-back does not hold the
long axis of the hall as specified, the ball
must be put in play over again.
The Line of Scrimmage for each side
is an imaginary line parallel to the goal
line and passing through that point of
the ball nearest the side's own goal line.
Neutral cone. —It is evident from the
foregoing definition that there must be
two lines of scrimmage, one for each
side, thus separating the two forward
lines by a space equal to the length of
the ball. This space is known as the
neutral zone, and may not be encroached
upon until the ball is put in play.
Off-side. —A player is off-side when
the ball has last been touched by one of
nis own side behind him.
Fair Catch.—A fair catcli is made by
catching the ball after it has been kicked
by one of the opponents and before it
touches the ground, or in similarly catch
ing a punt-out by another of the catcher's
own side, provided the playei (except in
case of punt-out, where no signal is nec
essary), while advancing toward the ball,
signals his intention of making a fair
catch by raising his hand clearly above
his head and does not take more than
two steps after making the catch.
It is not a fair catch If, after the kick,
the ball is touched by another of the
ifcher's side before the catch.
T he mark of the catch is the spot at
whu h the ball is actually caught.
Opportunity to make a fair catch is
where the layer is in such a position
that it would be possible for him to
reach the ball before it touches the
ground.
Goal fro* '■ Touchdown. —A goal from
touchdown m 1c by -kicking the baU
from the fic?d of play over the cross*
bar of the opponents' goal, by a place
kick direct, 01 by i place-kick preceded
by a punt-out.
If tlve ball passes directly over one ot
the goal posts, or f, after being kicked, it
strikes an opponent and then passes over
the cross-bar or «!•« Of tin goal posts, it
shall count a goal In no case shall i*
count a goal if th< baQ, after leaving
the kicker's foot, touches the ground be
fore passing over tl,ic cross-bar or goal
posts.
