# ENGLISH CLUB TO PUBLISH SEQUOIA UNDER NEW TITLE
## 
### 
The Stanford Sequoia will in the
future appear on the Campus under the
name of the Round Table. At a meet
ing of the English Club Wednesday it
was decided to change the title of the
society's quarterly publication. The de
cision was influenced by a feeling that
the club should have the title of its
official periodical distinct from any like
name on the Campus. "Bob" Donald
son. *17, was elected editor-in-chief of
the quarterly in appreciation of his past
services on the staff and in the society.
Officers elected for the coming year
were: President, J. M. Chase, '18; Vice-
President, A. F. Binns, '22; Secretary,
Margaret McElin, '18; Treasurer, A. W.
Leeds, '20. Committees were appointed
as follows: Executive Committee, Whit
tier Wellman, '20, to be member-at-large.
and Miss Edith Mirrielees of the Eng
lish Department as faculty representa
tive. Finance Committee, A. W. Leeds,
'20, Margaret McElin, '18, R. C. Alexan
der, '21, R. W. Kinney, '21, and Miss
Margery Bailey of the English Depart
ment.
The latter committee is to confer with
Mr. Vickery of the Central Accounting
Office to prepare a complete report of
the finances of the slanford Pageant
which was given last year by the Eng~
lish Club.
Plans for a play to fie given soon were
also discussed. The name is (to be
announced later. A meeting of the club
will be held in room 200E of the English
building next Wednesday at 8 p. m.to
elect new members.
