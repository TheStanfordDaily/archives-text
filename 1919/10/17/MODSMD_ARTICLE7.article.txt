inspection and criticism of the mem
bers of the student body today. The
plan is embodied in a constitution
which sets forth the purpose of stu

by President F. L. King of the Student

cases of a disciplinary nature in all mat

In considering the cases that comes
before it, the Council is instructed by
the constitution to make a recommen
dation to the President of the Uni
versity, which is to be sanctioned or
disapproved by him and referred back
to the student organization. If the de
cision is approved the Council will pro
ceed according to the recommendation;
if disapproved, the case will be recon
sidered and a new recommendation
made.
A certain moral responsibility is
placed upon the members of the Senior
Class by one article of the constitution.
This responsibility relates to the proper
regard for all traditions and customs of
the university.
The drafting committee will now re
ceive suggestions in regard to the plan
which is published to-day. It will re
ceive suggestions until next Wednesday
night, either through the columns of
the Daily Palo Alto or directly to the
committee. The members of the com

tions have been received by the com
mittee it will consider them, and if it
sees fit, will then embody them in the
present proposed constitution. The
amended constitution will then be re
