# TRUSTEES ANNOUNCE CHARGE OF QUARTERLY TUITION FEES
## Higher Faculty Wage is Purpose 
### 
AS a startling departure from previous university the Board of
Trustees announced Saturday, that after January 1, a tuition fee of $40
will be charged in addition to the present fee of $20, which is purely inci
dental. Those students registered in the professional departments (Engineer
ing, Law, and Medicine) in which the special fees aggregate to a sum larger
than $40 are exempt from the $40 tuition fee. If, however, the special fees

fall helow $40, then students are re
quired to pay the difference between
the special fee and the quarterly tuition.
The imperative necessity for an increase
in faculty salaries was given out as the
cause for the tuition fee, and though
regret was expressed by the Board that
such action was necessary, it was felt
that the tuition system was the only
method by which the University could
meet its financial burden.
President Wilbur in an interview to
day explained the action taken Friday
by the Board of Trustees, and com
mented upon the increase of salaries for
the faculty, and the new tuition fee
which becomes effective January 1
Regarding the pay for instructors, he
said "The imperative need of higher
salaries for the faculty is so evident that
the Trustees' action on their behalf re
quires no comment."
Speaking of increased cost of operat
ing the University, he said, "Each stu
dent at Stanford costs the University
from $600 to $800 per year. Fuel ex
penses have increased 300 per cent. The
University has a fixed income and can
not go to the legislature and ask for
finances to meet new conditions
"By the new tuition plan, part of the
financial burden is distributed over a
great many people. The recent action
by the Trustees clinches the fact that
we are going to maintain high standards
at Stanford. Due to the fact that the
University will accept the notes of stu
dents who are unable to pay tuition
foes during their student days, and will
allow them a liberal time in which to
redeem the notes, no one will be turned
away as a result of the new system."
The Stanford Trustees Friday decided
to make a further addition to the
salaries of the faculty of about $75,000.
The rise in the cost of living has made
this action imperative. The Trustees
are also considering means of increas
ing the housing facilities for students
upon the campus, since the present at
tendance of 2314 students is beyond ex
isting facilities.
