# TRUSTEES ANNOUNCE CHARGE OF QUARTERLY TUITION FEES
## Higher Faculty Wage is Purpose 
### 
AS a startling departure from previous university the Board of
Trustees announced Saturday, that after January 1, a tuition fee of $40
will be charged in addition to the present fee of $20, which is purely inci
dental. Those students registered in the professional departments (Engineer
ing, Law, and Medicine) in which the special fees aggregate to a sum larger
than $40 are exempt from the $40 tuition fee. If, however, the special fees

fall helow $40, then students are re
quired to pay the difference between
the special fee and the quarterly tuition.
The imperative necessity for an increase
in faculty salaries was given out as the
cause for the tuition fee, and though
regret was expressed by the Board that
such action was necessary, it was felt
that the tuition system was the only
method by which the University could
meet its financial burden.
President Wilbur in an interview to
day explained the action taken Friday
by the Board of Trustees, and com
mented upon the increase of salaries for
the faculty, and the new tuition fee
which becomes effective January 1
Regarding the pay for instructors, he
said "The imperative need of higher
salaries for the faculty is so evident that
the Trustees' action on their behalf re
quires no comment."
Speaking of increased cost of operat
ing the University, he said, "Each stu
dent at Stanford costs the University
from $600 to $800 per year. Fuel ex
penses have increased 300 per cent. The
University has a fixed income and can
not go to the legislature and ask for
finances to meet new conditions
"By the new tuition plan, part of the
financial burden is distributed over a
great many people. The recent action
by the Trustees clinches the fact that
we are going to maintain high standards
at Stanford. Due to the fact that the
University will accept the notes of stu
dents who are unable to pay tuition
foes during their student days, and will
allow them a liberal time in which to
redeem the notes, no one will be turned
away as a result of the new system."
The Stanford Trustees Friday decided
to make a further addition to the
salaries of the faculty of about $75,000.
The rise in the cost of living has made
this action imperative. The Trustees
are also considering means of increas
ing the housing facilities for students
upon the campus, since the present at
tendance of 2314 students is beyond ex
isting facilities.
The original Stanford endowment has
been overtaxed in the support of the
institution. The large land holdings,
except the campus farm, have been sold
and the returns converted into interest
bearing securities. The volume of in
come from the original endowment is
thus now defined. In an endeavor to
keep the expenditure within the total
income from all sources of approxi
mately $1,100,000 per annum it was de
cided some years ago to limit the total
number of entering men with less than
one and one-half eyars' standing to 500
per year, resulting in a student body
of approximately two thousand. For
this year only the number has been
exceeded in order to accommodate re
turning soldiers. After these were
cared for, some 150 further applicants
had to be refused admission. Despite
these arrangements, the growth of the
University and the rising cost of liv
ing have necessitated expense exceed
ing the resources, and to meet these
emergencies the Trustees have dccided
to place in operation a tuition fee for
all students.
The institution, except for incidental
fees for gymnasium, guild, incidentals,
etc., has hitherto been free in all ex
cept certain professional courses. The
Trustees regret the necessity of depart
ing from this basis. In order, however,
that no hardship may be imposed upon
the considerable number (of students
who arc working their way through the
University, the Trustees will accept the
note for such students as may be demon
strated to be in need of such assistance
for future payment ,and have estab
lished 30 scholarships and ten fellow
ships for graduate students. The new
tuition fees will be $40 per tpiarter,
equal to $120 per year, as compared to
that of about $150 to $200 for other
endowed institutions. It is felt by the
Trustees that an obligation of working
students to pay this sum some years
after graduation will not inflict any hard
ship. The total immediate income thus
provided is estimated at about $130,000
per annum or about 12 per cent of the
cost of operating the institution. Even
this provision will not allow the im
provement of housing accommodations
as rapidly as is desirable and will not
permit any increase in the number of
students.
The new payroll for the faculty will
in so far as is practicable be based upon
the following schedule: Instructors,
$1800 to $2400; assistant professors,
$2500 to $3000; associate professors,
$3250 to $4000; professors, $4500 to
$7500. The new salaries go into effect
November 1, 1919, and the new tuition
fees from January 1, 1920.
Owing to the abandonment by the
Carnegie Foundation of pensions for
professors entering university work since
November 17, 1915, the University is also
obliged to consider some means of re
piacng the former Carnegie pension
s\stem.
It is hoped that these measures will
lift the University over this immediate
pressing situation, but it will be im
possible to accommodate the total ap
plicants for admission without further
gifts to the endowment
It is considered vital by the Uni
versity authorities to maintain the high
standards of the institution even at the
present disability of limiting the num
ber and of making a charge of tuition.
