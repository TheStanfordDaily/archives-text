# GIVE THE BLEACHERS A CHANCE
## 
### 
STANFORD students went en masse to the football field last Friday after
noon to see the first scrimmage between the varsity and freshman teams.
The game, if such it can be called, had been announced, and given consider
able publicity. The students wanted to get behind the players and show
them that the student body is with them, and what happened? Instead of
holding the scrimmage at the customary time, four thirty, the time that all
mid-week games have been played at Stanford for at least ten years, the
coaches conducted a slow, uninteresting practice for over an hour, while the
men who wanted to support the team, sat grumbling on the bleachers. At
five thirty-five, the opposing teams were called on the field for a short
scrimmage.
We are not trying in the least to tell the coaches how to run their teams.
The training of the Stanford elevens is their business, but it is also their
business and the Student Manager's duty to arrange at least one practice
game a week, played at a reasonable hour for the bleachers. We ask, who
is it that supports the teams and makes possible the playing of Big Games?
We ask who pays the coaches, and for that matter the Student Manager?
The bleachers demand nothing unreasonable, but Stanford has always been
able in the past to put on a good game at four thirty, during the middle of
the week, besides the Saturday contests, and the American game will get
little support here unless the students are given at least this many games.
The conduct of last Friday's fiasco was poor psychology to say the least.
We are just changing to the old game, and there are a great many sup
porters of rugby in the student body. We recognize the fact that regardless
of what they may think of the American game, they must all pull for it
with us if Stanford is to succeed on the gridiron. However, they must be
considered, and even catered to. When the University of California first
changed over to the American game of football, every effort was made to
please the bleachers. Games were scheduled at hours that pleased the spec
tators, and practices were conducted at times convenient for them. We
have it on good authority that men were even played on the team who
could not ordinarily make it, but they were popular stars with the followers
of football. Those in charge of the sport at Stanford need not go to these
extremes to get the students behind them, for they are already backing the
game because it is what Stanford has chosen to play, just as loyal Stan
ford people always do. However, the bleachers will have to be considered,
and when some six hundred students come down to watch a scrimmage that
has been announced, a "let them go to —" attitude on the part of the "pig
skin powers that be," will not help the cause any.

the week, besides the Saturday contests, and the American game will get
little support here unless the students are given at least this many games.
The conduct of last Friday's fiasco was poor psychology to say the least.
We are just changing to the old game, and there are a great many sup
porters of rugby in the student body. We recognize the fact that regardless
of what they may think of the American game, they must all pull for it
with us if Stanford is to succeed on the gridiron. However, they must be
considered, and even catered to. When the University of California first
changed over to the American game of football, every effort was made to
please the bleachers. Games were scheduled at hours that pleased the spec
tators, and practices were conducted at times convenient for them. We
have it on good authority that men were even played on the team who
could not ordinarily make it, but they were popular stars with the followers
of football. Those in charge of the sport at Stanford need not go to these
extremes to get the students behind them, for they are already backing the
game because it is what Stanford has chosen to play, just as loyal Stan
ford people always do. However, the bleachers will have to be considered,
and when some six hundred students come down to watch a scrimmage that
has been announced, a "let them go to —" attitude on the part of the "pig
skin powers that be," will not help the cause any.
STANFORD students went en masse to the football field last Friday after
noon to see the first scrimmage between the varsity and freshman teams.
The game, if such it can be called, had been announced, and given consider
able publicity. The students wanted to get behind the players and show
them that the student body is with them, and what happened? Instead of
holding the scrimmage at the customary time, four thirty, the time that all
mid-week games have been played at Stanford for at least ten years, the
coaches conducted a slow, uninteresting practice for over an hour, while the
men who wanted to support the team, sat grumbling on the bleachers. At
five thirty-five, the opposing teams were called on the field for a short
scrimmage.
We are not trying in the least to tell the coaches how to run their teams.
The training of the Stanford elevens is their business, but it is also their
business and the Student Manager's duty to arrange at least one practice
game a week, played at a reasonable hour for the bleachers. We ask, who
is it that supports the teams and makes possible the playing of Big Games?
We ask who pays the coaches, and for that matter the Student Manager?
The bleachers demand nothing unreasonable, but Stanford has always been
able in the past to put on a good game at four thirty, during the middle of
the week, besides the Saturday contests, and the American game will get
little support here unless the students are given at least this many games.
