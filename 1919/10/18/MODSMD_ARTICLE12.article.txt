# Changes in Conference Rules Misunderstood
## 
### 
Some misunderstanding has arisen
relative to the changes recently made
in Conference rulings regarding wo
men. Under the new decisions, the
10:30 rule has been lifted in the cases
of attendance at campus or private
dances, or for those who wish to re
turn from San Francisco on the the
atre train. In all other cases, the
10:30 rule will still be enforced.
All such rules, concerning week-end
hours, hold good only for Friday and
Saturday nights, and not. for Sunday.
The rule against riding on the high
way after dark reads that no woman
shall under any conditions ride on the
highway after dark, unless chaperon
ed, and is to be strictly enforced.
