Norman Ross, a former Stanford man
and the champion swimmer at the inter
allied meet, Rave an exhibition at the
Encina tank this afternoon. At the races
in Paris he won all of he swimming
events from the shortest sprints to the
100-meter event.
Ross demonstrated some of his numer
ous strokes before the crowd of Stan
ford men, who attended the exhibition.
The interclass swim was staged after
Ross' appearance. Ernest Brandstep
judged the contestants, and from the
appearance of the men in the meet this
afternoon he will probably select the
men to represent Stanford in the first
meet of the season, which will be with
Lowell high on October 18th.
