# Rugby Football Men Begin Practice With Many Candidates Out
## 
### 
Rugby enthusiasts have been prac
ticing steaily on the field reserved for
them near the Encina Gym. Compe
tition is already keen for berths on
the prospective team which will play
under the auspices of the Stanford
Rugby Club.
The team will be under a great
handicap, since all the regular Varsity
rugby men are candidates for the
American football team. "Dink"
Templeton, star of the former aggre
gation is lost tot the rugby squad.
In spite of the drawback a team will
be chosen, and a captain elected in the
near futue. The number of men who
turn out every evening proves that
interest in the old major sport is still
very lively in the university.
The schedule, which is partially
completed, will include many of the
teams Stanford has played in the past.
A trip to Vancouver is practically as
sured.
