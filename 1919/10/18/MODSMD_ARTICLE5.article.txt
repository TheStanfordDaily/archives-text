THE feature match of the bay coun
ties doubles championship Sunday in
San Francisco was furnished by Allyn
Barber and 'Jim' Davies playing against
John Strachan and Rolin Robert.s De
spite the fact that both Strachan and
Roberts are two premier racquet weild
ers of the coast, the Stanford men made
them play their best, and the result was
in doubt until the last point had been
played.
Ijj the first set Davies and Barber
led at three games to one and were with
in one point of the set several times,
making the San Francisco team go their
limit. The following set proved a battle
royal, all the games going to deuce.
Many times the spectators rose to their
feet to cheer the remarkable "gets" the
Stanford men worked on their tried,
seasoned opponents. The final score
was in favor of Roberts and Strachan,
9-7. 6-3.
In the singles, "Jim" Davies played
the Japanese star, S. Yokkishiwawa to
three sets, losing only after the hardest
fought match of the day. Davies
smashed well at the net and played the
back court to advantage. The steadiness
of the Japanese finally won from the
Stanford man 4-6, 6-4, 7-5. "Skee"
Turner last to the veteran, A1 Rosenberg,
of the California Club 6-3, 6-3. Turner
played well, but the experience of the
older man was too much for him.
"Phil" Noer lost to Wilton Smith coast
jun'or c' ampion. 2-6, 6-2, 6-0.
Stanford's outlook in the tennis
matches with California are brighter
than they have been for several years.
Davies is playing much better tlian last
year when he captained a successful
team against the Bruin freshmen. "Skee"
Turner is also playing well, and Paul
Kinney, Lounsberry Fish, and Phil Neer
have shown considerable improvement
over last year.
