## AN INJUSTICE 
### 
DROPPING like a bombshell on the Stanford students, the informa
tion was released in San Francisco during the week-end, that
the fiee Stanford that thousands have learned to love will no longer
be that free institution, welcoming those rich and poor, into its demo
cratic fold, lo equalize in a measure the professors' salaries with the
rise in the cost of living, the Board of Trustees has changed the status
of this Univeisity from an institution where students are educated at
the lowest minimum cost to them, to that of a pay-college, where those
who can afford an extra $160.00 a year, are welcomed, but those who
can not get together this amount, are excluded. To be sure, the Uni
\c i sit\ authorities will take a prospective student's note for the required
amount, but what of the many who prefer to attend another university
where a fee of but $7.00 a semester is charged, rather than have a note
of over $600.00 hanging over them? Are we to lose these students
who would otherwise be loyal Stanford men and women ?
We recognize the fact that the purchasing power of the dollar has
been halved, cutting the annual income from Stanford's endowment
down to but that proportion of what it was in 1914. We see clearly
that the needs of Stanford can not be accomplished without increased
endowments, that the things Dr. Wilbur says are necessary for us to
get foi Stanford to expand side by side with other great universities,
can not be secured unless some provision is made for a greater income.
We even recognize that the salaries of the professors must be raised in
order that they may live at their present standard, (although we fail
to see anything that the University has done or attempted to do which
will help to increase the university graduates' salary in proportion to the
doubling of the cost of living). Something revolts within us when we
realize that the whole free policy, one of the great things of Stanford,
lias been swept aside, but we could be reconciled to this change if we
really thought that economic pressure had necessitated the measure.
Should Give One Year's Notice
However, to announce at this time that in January the new system
will take effect is not just to those students now registered in the Uni
versit). Some twenty-three hundred men and women registered here
under the impression that there would be no tuition fees charged, that
the only fees imposed upon them would be the usual incidental charges.
They were given this impression not only verbally by the authorities
of the University, but in writnig. The official publications issued at
Stanford state that there is no tuition charged in the year 1919-20, and
that the incidental fees will amount to twenty dollars. Is it fair to an
nounce, now that the contract has been made, that the exigencies of
the situation make it necessary for the University to break this con
tract . J The men and women who registered here this quarter, entered
with the full expectation of staying at least a year. In fact, most of
their courses are so mapped out, that it will be impossible for them to
transfer to another institution if they desired to do so before that time.
I here are men working their way through Stanford on a very narrow
margin. That margin can not possibly stand an extra $40.00 a quarter,
and it is obviously an injustice to these students to force them to either
drop out of college or sign their names to notes for a considerable sum
of money.
Other Methods Possible
If the Board of Trustees has determined that the only way the
Stanford professors can be given an increase in salaries is for the stu
dents to pay for it, the Stanford students may have to swallow their
indignation, and stand the tax, but something should certainly be done
as regards the time of putting the new "pay college" system into prac
tice. We believe that October of 1920 is the earliest possible date that
the Board of Trustees can consider, for the time of first changing the
status of this institution, and of requiring students to pay this excessive
tuition fee. We believe that other methods could have been tried to
raise the necessary amount, viz: a little less extravagance in the running
of this educational establishment, and an appeal to the Stanford alumni.
Other universities have found thmselves in exactly the same position
that Stanford is now, and have turned to their alumni. This appeal
has been answered, and a like request would have been favorably re
ceived by our own alumni now. Although a comparatively young uni
versity, Stanford can boast of an alumni as loyal as those of v eastern
colleges. Now would have been the time to test their regard for their
Alma Mater. Stanford students arc apparently helpless against this
new ruling of the Board of Trustees, but they can at least protest. The
Daily Palo Alto is their paper. They own it and control its policies.
Through it Stanford students are free to express themselves, and the
columns are thrown open in the hope that they will take advantage of
the opportunity.
