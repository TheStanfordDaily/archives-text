# OLYMPIC CLUB DEFEATS VARSITY ELEVEN 13-0
## CARDINAL LINE STRONG Coach Evans Is Now Working For a Hard-Hitting Backfield 
### 
DLAYING against a team with a su
perior offense and defense, the Stan
ford Varsity finished on the short end of
a 13 to 0 score with the Olympic Club
Saturday. Although the Varsity failed
to score on the visitors and to keep them
from crossing the Stanford line, the
game was a credit to the Stanford
eleven, playing its second game of Amer
ican football. The interference, block
ing, running, and tackling all showed a
good deal of room for improvement, but
at the same time the results of the game
show that Stanford will have a strong
team before the season is over.
In the first quarter Stanford held the
Winged O men to a 0 to 0 tie. During
this quarter the play was mostly in Olym
pic territory. Templeton started out at
full back, and one of hie long ptinto took
the play down to the five-yard line. Tem
pleton's two attempts to drop-kick goals
were blocked.
