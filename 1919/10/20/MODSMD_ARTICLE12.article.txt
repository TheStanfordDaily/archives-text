## 
### 
"The Founder's Ideals and History of
Stanford University" is to be the subject
of the talk for first-year men which
Dr. Jordan is to give this evening in
the Assembly Hall at*7:3o p.m. The
lecture is the initial talk of the Y. M.
C. A.'s new course, "Stanford Standards
for 1923," which was arranged for the
purpose of helping the freshmen "get
on the boat." It has been felt by the
Association that a series of talks by
prominent men on the campus would
eliminate all the difficulties which new
students experience in familiarizing
themselves with Stanford traditions and
customs. Discussion groups which are
to be conducted by uppcrclassmen will
be formed, following the lecture, and
various problems which arise concern
ing campus traditions will be discussed
')y the different groups. These groups
are to meet four times this quarter in
rooms at Encina which will be an
nounced later.
The next lecture will consist of a
personally conducted excursion through
the Memorial Church where Rev. D. C.
Gardner, Chaplain of the University,
will f>ive a brief talk on "The Me
morial Church, its history, architecture,
decorations and symbolism." This lec
ture should prove of great interest to
uppcrclassmen as well as first-year men,
inasmuch as the Memorial Church has
always been regarded as a part of Stan
ford tradition, and those who possess a
scanty knowledge of it can well avail
themselves of the opportunity to learn
something of its history.
