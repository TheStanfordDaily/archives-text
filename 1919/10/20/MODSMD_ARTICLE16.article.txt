# CARDINAL BABES WIN FIRST FOOTBALL GAME
## Freshman Eleven Is Rapidly Developing Into Fast American Team 
### 
With both teams playing a ragged
game of football, the Stanford fresh
men easily captured their first gridiron
contest by a score of 13 to 0, against the
ccond varsity of Santa Clara, last Sat
urday afternoon. Throughout the game
the Cardinal "frosh" had the upper
hand, but lack of practice and team
work handicapped this advantage.
Five times the ball was on Santa
Clara's one yard line, but nervousness
caused the Stanford babes to fumble the
ball each time. Stanford scored in the
first half when Trago carried the ball
on an o'T-tackle play over the line. The
attempt at conversion failed.
In the second half a blocked punt gave
lie ball to the "frosh" on Santa Clara's
30-yard line. Two line plunges, a pen
alty of five yards, and an end run by
Douglas brought the score up to 12
oints. Craven converted.
Douglass starred for Stanford, while
Jackson, Ameral, and Muldoon were the
mission stars. The Stanford team
showed up unusually well for the small
amount of practice they have had. The
freshmen held their line good, and only
once during the game was the Santa
Clara second varsity able to make their
yards on downs.
