fjiVERY member of the freshman class is expected to attend the lecture
tonight, when Dr. David Starr Jordan, Chancellor Emeritus of Stanford
University will talk on the History of Stanford. The opportunity of hearing
one of the University's greatest men speak on a subject that is of interest
to every Stanford Student is a privilege not often accorded to first-year stu
dents. The Y. M. C. A. is conducting this series of "Get on the Boat" lec
tures for the ultimate good of the whole University. They are primarily for
the freshman class, but in teaching the history, ideals, traditions, and customs,
of this great University, to the new students, the Y. M. C. A. will be of
great assistance in the developing of better Stanford men. The present
underclassmen came into the University handicapped. Under war conditions,
many of the things dear to former generations here were allowed to be for
gotten, and these lectures will help in reviving certain ideals and traditions
that are but memories on the campus now.
Dr. Jordan is a very busy man, and for him to grant an evening of his
time for the purpose of delivering a lecture to the Freshmen is sincere proof
of his devoted interest to our institution. The freshman class is over five
hundred in strength, and approximately this number should be present to
night. The older men and women at the University realize that it is a distinct
privilege to hear Dr. Jordan, but there are undoubtedly members of our new
class who have not as yet come to this realization. After they hear Stan
ford's first president speak tonight, it will be unnecessary for us to again
call attention to the fact that their presence is requested.
