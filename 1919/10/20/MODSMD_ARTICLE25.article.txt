To the Editor.
Dear Sir: The letter from Mr. Her
bert Hoover, which appeared yester
day in the Daily Palo Alto, came to
most of us students. I dare say, as a
revelation of facts about which we have
hitherto known little or nothing. I
read it with great interest and with all
due respcct both for Mr. Hoover and
for the Board of Trustees, which he
represents. May 1 add a few vords on
the subject under discussion?
Our prutcst has been directed solely
against the time chosen by the Board of
Trustees for installing the tuition sys
tem. Mr. Hoover disposes of this whole
phase of the question in a single para
graph of a dozen lines, in which he
says nothing more than to defend the
legality of the action and to assure us
that there can be no implied obliga
tion in any gift except on the part of
the receiver. Personally, I know noth
ing about the legality and I care a good
deal less, but I cannot follow Mr.
Hoover in the latter assertion.
Students who were able to take ad
vantage of Stanford training only on the
belief that 110 tuition was to be charged,
and who, by coming here, have lost their
opportunities to register immediately in
another institution, have good reason, it
seems to me, to expect the University to
live up to its tacit understanding that no
tuition would be charged this year. In
view of the announcements regarding
tuition made in the University bulletins
for 1919-20, I cannot see how Mr.
Hoover gets around the fact that Stan
ford is under a moral obligation to pro
vide instruction for the remainder of the
school year under the conditions that it
has announced. The fact that Stan
ford is giving away its opportunities in
stead of charging for them does not
change the fact that these students will
be imposed upon, either to the extent of
losing two-thirds of a year's work or of
being forced to assume promissory obli
gations which they did not want to
make. This is just as true in the case
of freshmen as in the case of transfers
from other colleges.
Furthermore, if the matter of tuition
has been hanging over the Board of
Trustees for the past fifteen years, at>
Mr. Hoover says it has, why were we
not given a little more than ninety days'
notice? Whence comes the ntcessity
of clapping the system down on us so
suddenly? The Trustees have known
about it long enough to give us ample
notice in advance, so that those not
caring to incur future obligations could
have made arrangement to receive their
training elsewhere. The failure of the
Trustees to take us into their confidence
a little sooner places them under a moral
obligation to withhold the tuition system
until those not wishing to comply with
it have had a chance to register some
place else.
The fact remains that the inaugura
tion of the tuition system next January
is an injustice, and I say it with all
emphasis. To some of the students il
comes as little less than an outrage.
Sincerely,
Elon Gerken, '20.
