Mirrielees in the Little Theatre at 7 :30

Miss Mirrielees has recently returned
from overseas, where she was associated
with the Stanford Women's Unit. Her
work was of a nature to give her a
lctige amount of inf irmation in regard
to the conditions existing in the hos
pitals of both France and Germany, and
also in regard to the part of the Red
Cross in helping to improve those con
ditions.
Although most of her time was snem
at the hospital at Vichy, Miss Mirrieless
later had an opportunity of going into
Germany, where she observed condi
tions in Coblenz and other cities.
