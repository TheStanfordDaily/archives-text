Townsend, Evelyn Johnston and
Lorraine West-

tryontees. This is the first year that the
society has had tryouts, even for minor
roles, but war conditions made this a
necessity. Davis says that he was great
ly surprised with the material that devel
oped, and that with the cast that has been
picked there is no doubt as to the play's
success.
The two lending parts will be taken by
Teresa Hihn, '19, Alpha Phi, and James
A. Quinby, '18. Miss Hihn played a lead
ing role in the Sophomore play last year,
while Quinby took part in the play,
"Justice."
Other members of the cast who seem
certain of starring are Lorraine West, '21,
Ruth Elsinger, '20, and Elizabeth Mc-
Arthur, '21, each of whom participated in
list year's junior opera. Richard Martin
sen, '21, who will act in"The First
Born," is well known through his part in
the pageant last spring. B. A. Harris,
'21, played in the Senior farce, "Nothing
But the Truth."
Davis also announced that he had re
ceived a telegram from Cecil B. DeMille
of the Lasky Studio assuring the society
a clever comedy sketch for a curtain
raiser.
All principal members of the cast are to
meet Davis to-night at 7:30, in the As
sembly Hall.
