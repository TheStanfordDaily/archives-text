# CLOSING THE ISSUE
## 
### 
fPODAY'S news columns of the Daily Palo Alto report the meeting held this
* * 'ng at which the President of the University took up in detail the
* stion with the sixteen representative students who signed the pro-
to the Board of Trustees. President Wilbur explained to the
â€¢on of these students, just as Mr. Hoover's letter had done previ
the expansive needs of this University require the installation
tuition system, at least until the Stanford Alumni will come to the
port of the University as they are doing in other colleges, or until some of
-ne present investment brings in a larger income. An attempt was made to
answer other questions that have bothered the student body, and it appears
that the chances of the authorities postponing the tuition charge until next
October are not only small, but they are practically non-existent. Dr. Wilbur
says frankly that no system can be perfect, that the University needs $75,-
000 before January, and that at present the only apparent means of securing
this sum is by charging tuition. For the sixteen students who tried to ac
complish at least a successful voicing of student opinion, the matter is closed.
The letter sent to the Board of Trustees was referred back to the President
of the University. The President has talked the matter over, explained his
own and the Board of Trustees' point of view, and has announced his de
cision. The Daily Palo Alto feels that it has done its best in making known
the general sentiment of the students at Stanford, and in cementing the whole
student body on a fair issue. We can not always win our point, but we can
honorably and with dignity fight for it. There is apparently little doubt but
that the students will pay tuition beginning with January first, 1920. The
issue is evidently closed, closed by a power higher than that of students or
student organizations.
