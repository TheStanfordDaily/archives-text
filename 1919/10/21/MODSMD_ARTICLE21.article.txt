# FORMAL PLEDGING FOR FRATERNITIES MAY COME SOON
## 
### 
Uniform or formal pledging for the
men's fraternities may come about in
the near future as the result of the ac
tion taken by the Interfraternity Confer
ence last night, which appointed a com
mittee to consider the proposition and
present recommendations to the confer
ence. A motion was passed endorsing
the Y. M. C. A.'s campaign of Monday
evening lectures to put the freshmen
"on the boat."
All fraternities are to give a report at
the next meeting of the conference of all
men pledged, with data stating the
pledges entering class, date of matricu
lation, attendance at other universities,
and date of pledging.
A motion was passed to the effect that
a fraternity man's brothers may be given
permission to live in a chapter house
upon application to the conference.
