# COMPLAINS OF LOSS OF VALUABLE PLANT
## 
### 
Complaining of the act of vandalism
which has resulted in the destruction of
one of Sequoia Garden's most attractive
plants, Dr. Abram of the Botany Depart
ment has written the following letter to
Dr. Wilbur:
President Ray Lyman Wilbur, *
Stanford University, Calif.
Dear Dr. Wilbur: Permit me to call
your attention to an act of vandalism
committed in the Sequoia Garden (for
merly the Roble Garden). One of the
most attractive shrubs in the garden,
Osmonthus Fagram, has been almost
completely cut away. The work prob
ably is that of some "esthetic" person
seeking decorations. The street was
locked, so there can be no excuse for the
act. It is the only specimen on the
grounds and has b*een about twenty years
reaching its present attractiveness.
If we are to maintain a semblance of
ornamental planting about the grounds,
such vandalism must be severely dealt
with. This plant represents a real mone
tary loss. If it were possible to replace
the plant with as fine a specimen it prob
ably would cost considerably over one
hundred dollars. Yours cordially,
F. R. Abram.
