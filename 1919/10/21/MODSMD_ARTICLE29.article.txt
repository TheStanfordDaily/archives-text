# JUNIORS PUT QUAD MANAGER ON SALARY
## 
### 
Both the eidtor and manager of the
1921 Quad will work on a salary basis
this year as the result of the decision
recently reached by the Quad Board of
Control. The editor has been granted
a salary of $400, and the manager a sal
ary of $600. Profits will be divided be
tween the manager, the editor, and the
Junior Class, the manager receiving 50
per cent, the editor 20 per cent, and the
junior class the remainder.
Many students felt that this division
was unjust to the editor, who claimed to
do as much or more work than the man
ager.
