# Wilbur Says Fees Must be Paid on January First
## 
### 
Tuition charges under the recent de
cision of the Board of Trustees will go
into effect at the beginning of next quar
ter notwithstanding student protests,
President Ray Lyman Wilbur told rep
resentatives of the students at a meet
ing held in his office this morning. The
immediate necessity for putting the fees
in effect is a deficit of $75,000 which
must be met by January 1.
The conference this morning was a re
sult of the letter of protest recently sent
the Board of Trustees by heads of vari
ous campus organizations as representa
tives of the student body. The signa
tories to this letter were called together
by President Wilbur, and he went into
detail on the Trustee's action.
In regard to the major point of pro
test, that the fees should not go into
effect at least until October 1, 1920,
President Wilbur said that no other sug
gestion acceptable had been made by
which the necessary finances could be
raised, and that therefore the charge
must necessarily become effective Jan
uary 1. He explained that it would be
useless to ask the alumni to raise $75,000
at this time.
The President stated that the matter
of the finances of the University had
been under serious consideration for
some time, and in facing the financial
problem the matter of tuition had been
considered. Every possible effort was
nade to raise the reeded money with
out resorting to the tuition method, but
t was found that any other means coulc'
not he relied upon. It was riot until the
recent meeting of the Board of Trustees
that the tuition system was definitely
adopted, and therefore no earlier an
nouncement could have been made to
the students of the University.
As to the third point, that of mak
ing the Trustee's decision known to the
San Francisco papers before the formal
announcement to the students was made,
President Wilbur explained, was only
through a series of unfortunate circum
stances that the public was inforned be
fore the students were. According to the
original intention, a student assembly
was to be called, but on account of the
story leaking out, the trustees were
forced to uive out the facts prematurely,
thus doing away with the necessity for
a student meeting.

considered. Every possible effort was
nade to raise the reeded money with
out resorting to the tuition method, but
t was found that any other means coulc'
not he relied upon. It was riot until the
recent meeting of the Board of Trustees
that the tuition system was definitely
adopted, and therefore no earlier an
nouncement could have been made to
the students of the University.
As to the third point, that of mak
ing the Trustee's decision known to the
San Francisco papers before the formal
announcement to the students was made,
President Wilbur explained, was only
through a series of unfortunate circum
stances that the public was inforned be
fore the students were. According to the
original intention, a student assembly
was to be called, but on account of the
story leaking out, the trustees were
forced to uive out the facts prematurely,
thus doing away with the necessity for
a student meeting.
Tuition charges under the recent de
cision of the Board of Trustees will go
into effect at the beginning of next quar
ter notwithstanding student protests,
President Ray Lyman Wilbur told rep
resentatives of the students at a meet
ing held in his office this morning. The
immediate necessity for putting the fees
in effect is a deficit of $75,000 which
must be met by January 1.
The conference this morning was a re
sult of the letter of protest recently sent
the Board of Trustees by heads of vari
ous campus organizations as representa
tives of the student body. The signa
tories to this letter were called together
by President Wilbur, and he went into
detail on the Trustee's action.
In regard to the major point of pro
test, that the fees should not go into
effect at least until October 1, 1920,
President Wilbur said that no other sug
gestion acceptable had been made by
which the necessary finances could be
raised, and that therefore the charge
must necessarily become effective Jan
uary 1. He explained that it would be
useless to ask the alumni to raise $75,000
at this time.
The President stated that the matter
of the finances of the University had
been under serious consideration for
some time, and in facing the financial
problem the matter of tuition had been
considered. Every possible effort was
nade to raise the reeded money with
out resorting to the tuition method, but
t was found that any other means coulc'
not he relied upon. It was riot until the
recent meeting of the Board of Trustees
that the tuition system was definitely
adopted, and therefore no earlier an
nouncement could have been made to
the students of the University.
