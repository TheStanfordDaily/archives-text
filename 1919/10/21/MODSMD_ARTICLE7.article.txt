# ATHLETIC COUNCIL COMPLETES WORK ON NEW SYSTEM
## SIX LEAGUES PLANNED Competition Will Commence Immediatelyâ€”Prizes For Players and Teams 
### 
JNTRAMURAL athletics as proposed
by Dr. A. D. Browne, physical di
rector of the University, were syste
matized by the council of nine, chosen
from the various rings of the new
athletic ladder, at its executive meet
ing yesterday afternoon.
By the new plan, athletes at Stan
ford are divided into two groups, Inter
collegiate, and Intramural. Varsity
and Freshman teams belong to the
first group, all other University teams
to the second. Secondary athletic or
ganizations of the University now
constitute intramural athletics.
Every student must make his choice
betwen intercollegiate and intramural
competition. He cannot be a member
of both divisions at the same time.
Membership in the intercollegiate di
vision consists in being recognized by
the coach as a candidate for a varsity
team, and subject to his supervision.
All such men are ineligible for intra
mural athletics. The coach shall post
notices from time to time on the gym
nasium bulletin board, announcing
their names. On the other hand, in
tercollegiate coaches will endeavor to
make their "cuts" in the varsity
squads as early as possible, so that
men failing to intercollegiate
teams may be available for intra
mural competition.
In the future, whenever it is pos
sible, interclass series in any sport
will be held prior to the opening of
the intercollegiate schedule in that
sport, and the coach will allow show
ing in this series to help him in his
selection of varsity candidates.
After completing a working sched
ule of the new system, the council
voted to commence operation immedi
ately. The football season is too far
advanced to permit efforts in that
direction, but swimming, cross-country
runs, tennis events in both singles
and doubles, wrestling, and track field
events will be handled by the new
system. Prizes in the form of cups
and placques will be awarded to in
dividual players and to groups or
teams.
Six leagues will be organized at once
from the different strata that compose
university athletics, and each league
will be composed of ten teams. The
schedules will be arranged as soon as
possible, and contests promoted. The
same principles will be used in base
ball next spring.
The council that worked out the new
system will act in an arbitrary capa
city to overcome the operations of
the plan, and officiate as mediators in
the event of argument.
