## 
### 
Plans for this quarter's Y. W. C. A.
work were outlined at a meeting yes
terday, at which airs. Maddox, of Palo
Alto, was the speaker. As former
head of the Hostess House at Camp
Fremont, and a promotor of War
Camp Community Work during the
war, she gave a comprehensive idea
of what the Y. W. C. A. can do in
Palo Alto, in addition to its work on
the campus.
There are several kinds of social
service work which need the support
of the campus women, according to
Mrs. Maddox. The establishment of
a day nursery in Palo Alto, run by
volunteer service, which would pro
vide entertainment and instruction for
the children too young to attend school
is among these plans. In connection
with this will come the revival of the
little girls' clubs of the vicinity.
.Another object of the Y. W. C. A.
will be to give parties at the Com
munity Center for the nurses from the
Base Hospital at Camp Fremont. It
is planned to open the Community
Center every night in the week for
the men and the boys who wish to
come there and enjoy the privileges of
the club rooms.
Campus women were urged to teach
Bible classes and classes in Ameri
canization and to help in entertain
ing at the Hospital on Sunday after
noons.
