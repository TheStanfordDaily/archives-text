# EDITH MIRRIELEES, '07, RELATES EXPERIENCES
## Work Abroad In Hospitals and Service Stations Outlined 
### 
Many interesting anecdotes and oc
currences in her experiences as a Red
Cross worker overseas were related
by Miss Edith Mirrielees, of the Eng
lish department, last night, when she
gave one of the most interesting lec
tures in the Little Theatre series this
year.
Stationed at one of the hospitals at
Vichy after the breaking up of the
Stanford Women's Unit, of which she
was the head. Miss Mirrielees had an
opportunity to help in the seaching
for the missing, sending of notifica
tions to families .and in doing all
kinds of general Red Cross relief
work.
"Tooth brushes were greatly sought
after," said Miss Mirrielees. "There
were so much demanded from me that
it seemed that I went over to France
to make the world safe for dentistry."
Miss Mirrielees described a typical
day for her at the hospitalâ€”filling
orders for supplies; helping the dying
send last messages to their homes;
getting hold of complaints; going
over the list of new and discharged
patients; attending funerals; helping
the patients in leaving for the front,
the convalescent camps, or their
homes; and last of all going over the
files, which were lists of men cabled
for from home, lists of those reported
missing, etc.
"The day the armistice was signed
the hospital was full and so many
wounded kept pouring in," she said,
"that no one had time to consider that
peace had come until the end of the
day."
Miss Mirrielees was later sent to
Germany with three other Red Cross
workers to assist in the hospitals, in
searching, and in the ranteen work
with the army of occupation.
