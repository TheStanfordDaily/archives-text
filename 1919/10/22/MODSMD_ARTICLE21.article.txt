# HOLDOVERS ORGANIZE
## 
### 
THE question has been raised: Have the holdovers an organization? We
reply that they have not. With more holdovers registered in the Uni
versity than has ever before been the case, with more members of the hold
over class figuring prominently in college activities than is so usually, and
present conditions such that the steadying influence of the older men is
needed badly, there is now no organization of these men. Not to always
refer to how it use to be done, but merely to show that certain things have
been accomplished here in the past along this line, we recall that the hold
over classes up to 1916 were organized. The students who fell into this
category held a meeting early in the semester. The student body president
presided at the meeting where a permanent chairman was elected, and in
addition to staging a "holdover show" at the Irich Marathon, and pulling
the traditional holdover party the night before the Big Game rally, these
students who ranked above the seniors devised many schemes for the better
ment of conditions here at college. The members of the holdover class are
usually outside the realm of petty politics and sometimes plays so prominent
a part in the University student organizations. They have been around the
University longer than the other students, they know the customs and tra
ditions better, and are in a position to accomplish a great deal in the mold
ing of student opinion. To do this successfully, the holdovers should be
organized, and there is little doubt but that the men here who do not belong
to any of the class organizations at present, will welcome the opportunity of
pulling together for some definite purpose.
