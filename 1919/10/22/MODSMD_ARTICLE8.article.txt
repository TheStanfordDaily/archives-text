ACTION was taken last night by the
** Student Council granting the Glee
Club a closed date on February 20,
1920, for the concert which has been
planned for that time. This will be
the first concert of the kind which
has been given since 1916 and the Glee
Club entertainment should be one of
the events of the year. Considerable
effort has been made to revive the

known throughout the entire West on
account of their successful tours.

support for the initial appearance, it
was moved, seconded and carried that
the Student Council make a loan not
to exceed $100 to the Glee Club. The
details of the loan will be left to the
student body manager to settle with
the members of the Glee Club.
