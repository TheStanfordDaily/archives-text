to express the sincere admiration which has been felt by the entire nation
for Theodore Roosevelt October 27, in a proclamation from Governor William
D. Stephens, has been set aside as "Americanization Day," as a fitting term
to be applied to the birth date of Theodore Roosevelt.
Among the speakers who have been asked for the occasion by the com-

mittee in charge of the arrangements

tion to foster and encourage the adop
tion of American ideals.

ritus David Starr Jordan, President
Emeritus J. C. Branner, and President
Ray Lyman Wilbur. R. L. King will
preside and give a few opening words
to the assembly. Dr. I). C. Gardner
will also speak briefly.
Dr. Jordan will be the main speaker
for the assembly as he had the pri
vilege of knowing Theodore Roose
velt personally. His personal remi
niscences as well as his remarks upon
the influence of the college man and
woman on politics of the day, will
be covered in his speech.
The assembly, Monday, comes as a
part of the great "Americanization
Movement" which has been activly
carried on during this week through
out the entire country. The campaign
is entirely non-partisan. Leaders of
this campaign feel that a revival of
the kind of Americanism that Roose
velt fought for during his public
career will serve as an effective anti
dote for the various off-color doctrines
that are now threatening our social
structure. Every possible effort is be
ing made throughout the entire na
tion to foster and encourage the adop
tion of American ideals.
The assembly, according to the
committee, is essentially an expression
of the student body and as such every
man and woman of the University is
urged to attend. Both students and

faculty will be represented on the
platform.
Those in charge of the arrangements
are P. L. King, '19, chairman; Pro
fessor C. B. Wing; Dean C. A. Huston,
