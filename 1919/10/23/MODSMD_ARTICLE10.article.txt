# Rivalry In Love Is Snappy Theme For "La Lettre Chargee"
## 
### 
The inevitable rivalry of two men for
a maid was the theme of "La Lettre
Chargee" presented by the French Club
last night in the Women's Clubhouse.
Dorothy Elfing, '21, as Hortense, a
young widow, took the part of the her
oine, while Raoul May, '22, as Fougas
son, an American, and Haakon Chev
alier, '22, as Hector de Courvalin, a
deputy magistrate, were the suitors for
her hand. Miss Francis Mayberry, '22,
took the part of Francine the maid. De
Courvalin would have been the favored
one had it not been for his habit of con
stantly using polysyllabic adverbs, which
irked Hortense, while Fougasson was
not to be tolerated because his prefer
ence for the widow was based splely
on her resemblance to his wife, who had
lately been killed in a railroad accident.
Failing to win the hand of his adored,
Fougasson is on the point of hanging
himself when his rival appears with a
message that the unfortunate man's wife
had been spared and Fougasson is made
happy, and de Courvalin wins the hand
of Hortense.
The sketch was well worked out, and
much credit is due to the players. The
large audience in attendance speaks well
for the succcss of the club for the com
ing year.
