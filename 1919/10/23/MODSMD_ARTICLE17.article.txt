# PACIFIC COAST LEAGUE GOVERNS FORENSIC DEBATES
## REPLACES FORMER RULE New Organization Initiated This Summer Through Coach McClintock 
### 
jpORENSIC contests under the Pacific
Coast Debating League will in the
future take the place of the former tri
state debates with Oregon and Washing
ton, as well as the arguments with other
western universities. The new organi
zation. initiated this summer largely
through Coach M. L. McClintock, will at
once assume control of all formal de
bates in which Stanford participates, with
the exception of the "Joffre" contest with
California.
The league includes a novel plan by
which debate subjects are chosen. The
secretary of the organization receives
suggested subjects from each university
and from these he chooses and mails
back the broad subject he considers most
fair. The separate league members then
word propositions on the broad subject,
and these propositions in turn are voted
upon by tbe league members, thus choos
ing the final debate subject.
The league's initial contest will be
held the first Friday in March, at which
time Stanford will send a team of two
men to Seattle to meet the University
of Washington. The University of Ore
gon will receive a team from Seattle
and will send a team to Stanford on the
same night. The subject of the debate
has not yet been chosen.
Coach McClintock, who has been ap
pointed secretary of tbe league for the
coming year, has announced that the reg
istration of tryoutees for this debate will
begin early in the winter quarter.
