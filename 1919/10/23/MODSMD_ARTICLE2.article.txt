# FRESHMAN ELEVEN TO MEET BERKELEY
## Cardinal Babes Confident of Victory Over Bruins On Saturday 
### 
Selecting his players from twenty
five eligihlcs, Coach Acker will send the
strongest possible freshman team in
against the Berkeley High School eleven
Saturday afternoon. The game has been
called for 2 o'clock on the Stanford
turf.
This season Berkeley has an unusu
ally fast "prep" school aggregation, and
weigh several pounds heavier than the
Cardinal babes. Berkeley has been a
winner in all of its games against the
other schools around the bay cities.
The faults of the Stanford "frosh"
in the game against the Santa Clara
second varsity have been corrccted, and
they should be able to pile up a big score
against their opponents Saturday.
The squad will be made up from the
following men: Center, Wright and Fa
villc; guards, Gowns, Johnson. Long,
Farrish, and De Groot; tackle, Cravens,
McAlpine, Heifer, Long, and Johnson;
end, Osborne, Papazian, Kraft, and Far
rish; quarter back. Trago, Reed, and
Austin; half-back, Osborne. Craven,
Douglas, Mohn, Clark, and Holt; full
back. Craglow, Winshipp, and Reed.
