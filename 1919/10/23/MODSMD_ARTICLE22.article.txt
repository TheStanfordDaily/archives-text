# ROOSEVELT ASSEMBLY

### 
Irving Cobb has said of Theodore Roosevelt:
"He could be wrong more often as a politician and right more often as
an American than any man since Andy Jackson. He had vision to see what
menace threatened us long before the danger became apparent to most of
the men of his generation.
He had courage to beg his countrymen to prepare themselves against the
impending peril. To the struggle he gave himself and his sons, and he died
for America as surely as though he had died on the field of battle with the
uniform of a soldier on his back and a bullet through his breast.
Through all the years of his life he served his land, and of his land
Theodore Roosevelt deserves a memorial which shall speak to future ages
of his valor, his work, and his splendid Americanism."
It is in honor of him, the "Great American," that the assembly is to
be called on Monday. Few indeed are the assmblies held at Stanford, and
of these, a very few for any purpose other than for discussing a merely
local question. Stanford students should come to the assembly hall en
masse on Monday. It is a wonderful opportunity accorded us to pay homage
to the man whose memory is admired probably more than any other by
college men and women. His life typifies what the university men and
women desire. His fight to build up himself physically as well as intel
lectually while in college, appeals to the college generations, and his life,
full to the brim, his energy, courage, and ability place his name beside
those most revered by all Americans. At the assembly on Monday, Stan
ford students will have the pleasure of hearing Dr. Jordan tell of personal
reminiscenses, and of various meetings with Roosevelt. Dr. Jordan is worth
hearing on any subject, and especially on this a subject close to every
American.
