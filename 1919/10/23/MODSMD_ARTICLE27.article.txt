# LOCAL CHAPTER OF ALLIED FLIERS' CLUB WILL BE FORMED
## 
### 
The hum of an airplane motor may
soon be a familiar sound over the Stan
ford Farm if the plans of Lieutenant
R. E. O. Hanley, '22, are carried out
in forming a Palo Alto branch of the
Allied Fliers' Club, which has its head
quarters in San Francisco. The pur
pose of the Club is to give practical
flight training to all ex-pilots who
served in either branch of the service,
and a meeting of all such Stanford men
has been called for next Tuesday at
7:30, the place to be announced later,
when the local chapter will be formed.
Lieutenant O'Hanley is an aviator of
some five years' experience, and although
a student at Stanford, is still in the gov
ernment service, recuperating from the
effects of an injury received while acting
as flight instructor at Rockwell Field.
He already has the promise of airplanes
from Colonel Arnold, head of the West
ern Department of Aeronautics, if the
club can furnish the proper equipment.
Limited membership will be open only to
accredited fliers, but it is planned to
have unlimited membership open to out
siders after a system of flight instruc
tion can be inaugurated.
There are some forty or fifty men on
the campus who wore wings during the
war.
