# CAMPAIGN TO HELP BLIND RELIEF WILL START ON MONDAY
## 
### 
A week's campaign to aid in in
creasing the Permanent War Fund for
Blind Relief, will be started on the
Stanford campus next Monday, Oc
tober 27, under the auspices of the
Women's Service Board. Boxes will
be placed in all the fraternity and
sorority houses, the dormitories, Wil
son's, and the Bookstore. Each stu
dent is requested to contribute at
least ten cents.
The fund's mission of reconstruc
tion is not carried on with any thought
of charity, but as a duty to the thou
sands of allied soldiers who were
rendered sightless in war service, and
have no means of support. The admin
istrative committee of the Relief Fund
is composed of eminent Americans
who guarantee that money raised for
this purpose will be employed to the
best advantage. Universities have
been particularly appealed to, and al
ready many eastern colleges have
responded. It is expected that Stan
ford will give the movement hearty
support.
