# TEN-THIRTY RULE MAY BE EXCEPTED WEEKEND NIGHTS
## CHANGES RECOMMENDED Dean Bradford Addresses the Women's Conference on Conduct Ruling 
### 
THAT the ten-thirty rule be lifted on
week-end nights for the purpose of
making it possible for the women of
the University to attend the second per
formance of the moving picture show
was the recommendation made to the
Student Affairs Committee by Women's
Confcrcnce as a result of a meeting of
the organization held last evening. A
feeling on the part of women who do
not attend dances that permitting late
leave for dances only was a discrimi
nation against them, gave rise to this
resolution.
The theatre train dispensation which
was announced last week in the Daily
Palo Alto was declared void as the
matter has not as yet been passed upon
by the Student Affairs Committee. Ac
cording to Dean Harriet Bradford, who
addressed the meeting, the only con
ference regulation which has been re
moved up to date is that applying to
walking in the hills.
A recommendation to the effect that
women graduate students over 25 years
of age be exempted from the chaper
onage regulations was also voted to be
referred to the Student Affairs Com
mittee. A motion was carried to rec
tax, will be on sale only until November
8, at the Bookstore and at Crandall's in
Palo Alto. Single tickets for the Ganz
recital will go on sale November 12.
