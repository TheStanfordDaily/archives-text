C'LABORATE preparations for the
Stanford-O. A. C. football game are
being made at Corvallis, as the con
test tomorrow is the big game of the
year for the northerners. A pajama
parade will start things off this even
ing and a big rally will follow. The
Oregon institution is expecting a large
number of its alumni back for the
game, and several prominent gradu
ates will speak at the rally. The an
nual sophomore-freshman rush will
take place Saturday morning, and pre
ceding the game, the students will
serpentine onto the field. A special
train of Stanford rooters will run out
from Portland for the game.
Cach Hargiss of the Beavers has
announced that his crew will be in
excellent shape for the gridiron battle.
Hubbard, left end, and Powell and
Kasberger, backs, are the Oregon
stars, and they are expected by the
"Aggies" to repeat their past per

star on the team, and in a recent game
he drop-kicked three field goals.

the following line-up: Hubbard, le;
Walker, It; Swan, lg; Stewart, c;
Johnston, rg; McCart, rt; Kirk, re;
