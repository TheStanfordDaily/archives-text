# STANFORD CARDINAL IS NAME OF ART AND LITERARY MAGAZINE
## 
### 
Claiming "The Stanford Cardinal" for
its name as significantly characteristic of
Stanford, with the avowed attention to
print material by and for those who
dwell "down in the country of the cardi
nal," an alert new publication has sprung
into being. It will replace the old Stan
ford Sequoia quarterly which was the
art and literary publication of the Uni
versity, but it intends to lead a more
active life by becoming a monthly mag
azine. The plan to continue the Sequoia
under the name of "The Round Table"
has been dropped, and all effort is be
ing made to launch the new Cardinal
upon a career that will rival that of the
Sequoia in the days of 1916 and 1917.
The magazine will not interest itself
primarily in campus affairs, which field
is covered by the Illustrated Review, but
will aim to deal with University life and
questions of University interest in a
broader sense. Putting this into effect,
the Cardinal will publish verse, sketches,
or stories of merit written by Stanford
students, but in addition, the scope has
been broadened to include essays or
articles on subjects of nation-wide as
well as University interest, critical arti
cles, reviews of the best current books.
It is planned to have a number of pro
fessors contribute popular and authori
tative articles on various current na
tional subjects.
Photographs or reproductions of
drawings or paintings will illustrate the
new magazine, which will be of a larger
size than the Sequoia, but will appear in
the characteristic two-color cover.
The present staff of the Cardinal is
composed of Robert A. Donaldson, edi
tor; Selling Brill, manager; Harry W.
I" rantz, James A. Quinby, Gordon Davis,
Miller L. McClintock, Whittier Well
man, William J. Losh, Burnet C. Wohl
ford, and Daniel Evans. The magazine
will be conducted by the staff under the
auspices of the English Club.
There is an opportunity for every stu
dent to submit to the first issue, which
will appear early in November. Those
whose contributions are accepted by the
magazine will have a good chance to
make the staff. All who are interested
are urged to communicate with the edi
tor, Box 1245 Campus, or 426 Encina
Hall.
