# COACH IS PLEASED WITH OUTLOOK FOR "THE FIRST BORN"
## FULL CAST IN REHEARSAL Pretentious Scenery Will Lend Distinction To Show 
### 
the first rehearsal promising,
the preparation for"The First Born,"
an Oriental play to be staged by Sword
and Sandals November 7, is under way.
Diligent work and concentrated efforts
assured by the cast will make this one
of the finest productions Stanford has
ever witnessed. The cast's ability to do
this is well backed by their previous
experience in campus dramatics.
Never before has this Oriental classic,
or any similar play, been presented here.
Its wonderful settings and scenic ar
rangement have penetrating influence
over the audience, and this influence
will be made equally strong here, regard
less of local production, since, through
great expense, a pretentious set of
scenes has been obtained by Leland Pick
ering, stage manager. The plot, scenes,
and characters harmonize exceptionally
well.
With a plot constructed by the au
thor, Francis Powers, so that intensi
fied interest is held throughout the play,
the first scene opens with Chan Lee, a
Chinese woman, who previous to the
opening of the first act had married a
merchant known as Chan Wong, re
turning after running away with an
other man, Lo Yek. After the mar
riage of Chan Lee and Chan Wong,
birth was given to a child, "The First
Born." Following the desertion of the
mother, Chan Wong places the child in
care of a guardian. The child strays;
falls in possession of its mother; is ac
cidentally killed, and revenge is then
sought by the enraged father, Chan
Wong. His process of seeking and re
ceiving the revenge Is revealed in the
last act. Powers' ability to arrange
events to this final action is most ex
traordinary, for he keeps his audience in
reached. There is no doubt thta
utter darkness until the ultra climax is
reached. There is no doubt that many
will be kept guessing toward the finish
of the play, but everyone will be satis
fied with the unique way in which the
author handles it.
