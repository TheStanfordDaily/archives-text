# A.F. Whyte Will Talk Here Tuesday
## Labor Problems of England Is Topic Selected by Prominent Editor 
### 
A. P. Whyte, Member of the British
Parliament, and Editor of "The New
Europe," Is to be the next speaker
in the Tuesday evening series. His
address will be on "Labor in Great
Britain."
Mr. Whyte is said to be the young
est member of Parliament. He is a
Liberal, and is therefore more in
harmony with American views on
labor. He is travelling in the United
States to help further the "Hands
Across the Sea" proposition. He
wishes to view the conditions here
in efforts to establish still better rela
tions between this country and Great
Britain.
Because of the unusual interest in
the conditions and demands of labor
at this time, especially in those of
England, and the expected crowd, the
meeting place has been changed from
the Little Theater to the Assembly
Hall.
Mr. Whyte will address Stanford
again at a University Assembly on
Wednesday morning, at 10 o'clock,
when he will discuss "The Irish
Peace."
