# ONE HUNDRED PER CENT.
## 
### 
IDEALIZING the futility of an attempt to collect a sufficient number of con
tributions to place Stanford among the leading colleges in the amount
subscribed to the Roosevelt Memorial Fund, the committee here has struck
on a novel plan, one that has never been tried at Stanford, and one
that will appeal to all the students. It will be a big "boost" for this insti
tution for every man and woman registered to have subscribed to the Roose
velt Fund. The amount is of little importance. No matter how the campaign
Is conducted Stanford can not excel in the total subscribed, but in this "one
hundred per cent" effort, the University can easily come to the front.
The committee in charge of the campaign will have various sub-commit
tees circulating over the campus in an effort to locate every student. This
will be impossible, of course, unless the students co-operate, but those re
sponsible for Stanford's showing feel that the idea of a "one hundred per
cent" contribution will prove popular in the student body. At the Memorial
Assembly to be held on Monday night, the monetary side of the Roosevelt
Campaign will not be considered. It is hoped that the students will come
to this assembly with the full realization that there is to be haranguing for
money. University students have been appealed to on every issue, and they
have contributed almost to their limit. This is one of the reasons why the
total amount to be subscribed in this campaign is to be subordinated to the
fact that the name of every Stanford student will be on the list of contri
butors. At the assembly our three Stanford Presidents will tell us more
about the "Great American." Stanford students will consider it an oppor
tunity to pay homage to Roosevelt, and with the different living groups
co-operating by postponing all meetings, the assembly should be filled.
