# Special Tour Through Memorial Church Monday
## 
### 
Dr. C. D. Gardner will personally con
duct members of the freshman class
through the Memorial Church on Mon
day, Wednesday, and Friday afternoons
of next week at 4:'15, where he will give
a short talk on "The Memorial Church,
Its History, Decorations, and Symbol
ism." The lecture is the second of the
six events which the Y. M. C. A. is
arranging for the new students in its
"on-the-boat" course in Stanford tradi
tions and customs. It was decided to
hold the excursions in the afternoon on
account of the better light effect which
the sun has on the stained windows of
the church. All those who expect to
attend will meet at the Memorial
Church as follows: Monday, those with
names beginning A to G, Wednesday H
to O, Friday P to Z.
Additional leaders of the freshmen
â– groups on "Stanford Standards for
1923" are E. G. Caughey, '18, R. M.
Nesbit, '20, and A. Williamson, '21.
Freshmen who have not already signed
enrollment cards for the course can ob
tain them at the Association's offices in
the Union.
