# Head of R.O.T.C. Sends Bids to Ex-Service Men
## 
### 
In order to explain their inability
to invite all former service men to
the Military Ball, the committee called
a meeting last night of all R. O. T. C.
members. Major Parker, who was
scheduled to speak was unable to ap
pear, but members of the committee
discussed the plans for the dance and
explained that while this dance was
to be given as an appreciation to ex
service men, there were so many on
the campus that it would be impos
sible to invite them all. Only those
whose names have been turned in by
members of the two units will be in
vited, as guests of those members.
