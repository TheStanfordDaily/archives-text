# Law Association Will Reorganize on Monday
## 
### 
For the purpose of organizing the
Stanford Law Association, Dean
Huston of the Law School has asked
all members of the School to meet
Monday afternoon in Room 12, at 2
o'clock. There are a number of older
men in the University this year who
have returned to the Law School from
government service, who have been
particularly anxious to form an or
ganization of law students, and will
be given that opportunity on Monday.
