Word has been received by the local
Y. M. C. A. that Stanford will be al
lowed to send twenty-seven delegates
to the Student Volunteer Convention
which is to be held at Des Moines.
lowa, December 31 to January 5. This
is an increase of sixteen representatives
over the number sent to the last conven

1914. The convention is composed of
Y. M. C. A. workers from all parts of
the world who regularly meet every two
years for the purpose of interesting col
lege men in the Christian movement
which the "Y" is carrying forward.
The committee in charge of preparing
the list of Cardinal delegates is com
posed of Charles Titus, '18, Chairman;
S. K. Davis, '20, and D. Lundquist, '22.
This committee will work in conjunction
with a similar committee from the Y.
W. C. A. Stanford's delegation will be
composed of twenty-five undergraduate
men and women, and the two "Y" secre
taries.
