Goal from the Field.
A Goal from the Field is made by
kicking the ball from the field of play
either by a drop-kickor a place-kick over
the cross-bar of the opponent's goal. A
goal cannot be scored by a kick-off.
If the ball passes directly over one of
the goal posts, or if, after being kicked, it
strikes an opponent and then passes over
the cross-bar or one of the goal posts, it
shall count a goal. In no case shall it
count a goal if the ball, after leaving the
kicker's foot, touches the ground before
passing over the cross-bar or goal posts.
