# WOMEN'S BOARD TO LAUNCH FUND FOR BLIND SOLDIERS
## 
### 
Beginning next Monday the Women's
Service Board will launch a campaign
on the campus to raise the Stanford
quota of the funds for the "Permanent
blind Relief War Fund for Soldiers and
Sailors of the Allies." This campaign is
but a part of a nation-wide campaign
that is being carried on in all of the
universities and colleges in the United
States during this week to raise
$5,000,000.
This fund was originally started by
Mr. and Mrs. George Kessler of New
York for the relief of those blinded dur
ing the war. The object of the organiza
tion is to equip these men so that they
may continue to earn their own living
despite the fact that they have lost their
sight.
The money that is given toward the
support of this cause is used in many
ways. Some of the money goes to the
family of the injured man to help defray
their expenses. In other cases the money
is used to establish schools for blinded
officers and to establish Industrial
Schools for the men where they can
learn various trades.
Stanford is expected to contribute at
least $50 to the fund. This is to be a
ten-cent campaign; that is, every person
on the campus is supposed to contribute
at least ten cents. Boxes will be placed
in each Sorority and Fraternity house,
and in each of the dormitories, in which
the contribution may be placed. The
campaign will last from Monday until
Friday, when it is hoped that the re
quired quota will be reached.
