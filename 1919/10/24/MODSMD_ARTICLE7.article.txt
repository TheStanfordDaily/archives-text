# M'KEEVER EXPLAINS ADVERTISING THEORY
## 
### 
Workings of the modern advertising
agencies were laid bare in a lecture given
by Coulter McKeever before the Adver
tising Clnb last night. McKeever ex
plained, with the aid of a chart, just
what steps are necessary to turn out the
finished product in the form of an ad.
He has had wide experience in this line,
and is now connected with the H. Mc-
Cann agency of San Francisco.
