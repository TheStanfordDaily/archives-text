William Desmond in"THE MINTS OF HELL"
This gripping story of the Frozen North deals with real men with red
blood in their veins, and one thrill follows another in rapid succession.
The many snow scenes are especially beautiful. Also an Educational
Reel and a Rip-Roaring Two-Reel Comedy.
Tuesday and Wednesday, Oct. 28-29, Anita Stewart in
"MARY REGAN"
Also "UNIVERSAL CURRENT EVENTS" —A Mutt and Jeff Cartoon
and a fine comedy, "DIPLOMATIC AMBROSE"
