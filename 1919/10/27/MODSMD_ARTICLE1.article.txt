# STANFORD VARSITY HUMBLES OREGON "AGGIES" 14 TO 6
## Eleven Shows Great Improvement 
### 
OTANFORD won its first Conference
game of football, by defeating the
Oregon Agricultural College, Saturday,
by a score of 14 to 6 at Corvallis. The
Cardinal fighting spirit, together with
"Dink" Templeton's educated toe, is ac
countable for the defeat of Coach Har
giss' squad.
The Oregon Aggies made their only
touchdown in the first quarter of play
when a forward pass, Schroeder to Hub
bard, gave them 6 points. Schroeder
failed to convert.
In the second quarter, a 20-yard end
run by Bonney, a couple of line bucks,
and a forward pass, Holt to Pelouze,
gave Stanford its first score. Curtice
kicked the goal, and the half ended
with a score of 7 to 6 in favor of the
Cardinal.
Oregon tried to come back at Stan
ford in the third quarter and pushed the
ball forty yards to the Cardinal twenty
yard line. Powell, the "Aggie" full
back, fumbled the ball while going
through the line. Adams, picking up the
ball, ran the entire length of the field,
Stanford's perfect interference holding
the Oregon men back. Curtice again
converted the touchdown.
During the fourth quarter, Temple
ton's kicking held the Oregonians away
from the Stanford goal. Adams at left

end and Pelouze at right end were
working in perfect harmony with the
Cardinal backfield, making five complete
forward passes out of seven tries. The
"Aggies" made only one complete pass
out of nine efforts .
The line held like a stone wall, which
kept the Oregon team from blocking
any of Templeton's kicks.

left end; Flowers, left tackle; Caughey,
left guard; Righter, center; Bihlman,
right guard, Curtice, right tackle; Pe
