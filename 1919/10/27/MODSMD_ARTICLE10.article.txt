### 
PINAL arrangements have been com
pleted for the Roosevelt Memorial
Assembly to be held in the Memorial
Church at 8:15 sharp this evening. On
account of the musical facilities of the
Church, the assembly was changed from
the Assembly Hall to the church. The
committee in charge of the program is
very anxious that every man and wom
an on the campus attend as Stanford's
expression of respect to Theodore
Roosevelt. Houses have been requested
either to postpone or arrange house
meetings so members can attend.
Dr. Jordan will be the principal
speaker of the evening. It is expected
that he will give personal reminiscences
of his acquaintance with Theodore
Roosevelt as well as paying a tribute to
the great American's genius in Amer
ican politics and ideals. Theodore
Roosevelt is thought to be the cham
pion of the college graduate as he is
considered the ideal by many, and Dr.
Jordan will touch upon the important

part the college graduate is to play in
the political issues of the near future as
well as in the social and economic
spheres.
Special music has been arranged for
by Dean Allen which should add great
ly to the impressiveness of the cere
mony, according to the committee. Dr.
Gardner will make a few opening re
marks followed by Dr. Wilbur and Dr.
Branner. In order that the assembly
may be considered a distinctly student
affair, F. L. King, '19, will preside over
the assembly, and members of the stu
dent body have been asked to sit on the
platform.
The assembly will be of unusual in
terest because of the three presidents
of the University speaking on the same
occasion. The student body will have
an unusual privilege in hearing these
men together, as Stanford is distinctly
unique in the fact that the University
has every president since the founding
of the University living.
