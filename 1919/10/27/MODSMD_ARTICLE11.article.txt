The Berkeley officials some time ago
"discovered" on their campus five physi
cally perfect men, and believing in their
unusual development sent the open chal
lenge.
Dr. A. D. Browne, physical director
of Stanford, examined Kirksey Satur
day, and persuaded him to go to Cali
fornia to compare measurements with
the Berkeley "Apollos" and "Hercu
les."
The officials who examined the orig
inal challengers also measured and ex
amined the Stanford man and pro
nounced him in every way as good as
Byron Sprott, the best of the Blue and
Gold men.
It was found impossible to pro
nounced either Sprott or Kirksey win
ner, the physicians believing that only
some other form of competition can
decide superiority. This competition
