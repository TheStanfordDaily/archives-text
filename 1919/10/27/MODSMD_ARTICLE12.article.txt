# VICTORIOUS VARSITY CHEERED AT STATION
## 
### 
Returning triumphant from their 14
to 6 victory over the Oregon Aggies at
Corvallis the Varsity football team was
welcomed with cheers by a group of
Cardinal supporters at the Palo Alto
depot this noon.
When the 12:01 pulled in over 100 stu
dents were on hand, and a larger num
ber en route, but most of them arrived
too late, for after rendering a few yells,
the Varsity and its reception committee
piled on a campus-bound trolley and
entered the farm premises riding on the
roof.
