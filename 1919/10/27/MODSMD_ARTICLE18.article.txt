# THE 						STAFF
## 
### 
AFTER a three weeks' tryout period the staff of the Daily Palo Alto is an
nounced in this issue. In selecting the staff, it was felt that the number
should be kept within thirty-five, as a staff of over this number is unwieldly.
This was very difficult and perhaps injustices were done. There were over
sixty tryoutees this quarter, in addition to thirty-one old staff members.
Fourteen new students have been added to the staff, which of course, necessi
tated the dropping of ten former members of the Daily Staff. For those who
did their best and were not selected, the paper wishes to take this oppor
tunity of thanking them for their interest. There is always another time,
and there may be a better chance of making the paper during the next try
out period, to be conducted immediately following the Christmas vacation.
For those who have now made the staff, it will be a continuous tryout. When
ever their work falls below the mark, they will be shifted down the list.
There is little doubt but that changes will be made from time to time, and
an effort will be made to make these variations in accordance with the
merits of the individual cases.
