# TYPIFIES STANFORD SPIRIT
## 
### 
TYPIFYING the spirit with which Stanford stands behind its athletic teams,
winning or losing, hundreds of students turned out this morning at Palo
Alto to greet the victorioous invaders of the Northland, the Cardinal Varsity.
Though granted hardly a chance to win from its experienced opponents by
any of the sporting writers of the Coast, the Stanford team demonstrated the
invincibility of a team which couples a loyalty of spirit with relentless de
termination. The reception given the team this morning must remove for
ever the doubts of the loyalty of the University to the American game. Not
alone because the team won against odds did the student body rise to render
it homage, but because back of everything is the loyalty of Stanford to the
things of Stanford, and the desire to show that those who struggle for Stan
ford are worthy of devotion and support of the highest type. The student
body wants Coach Evans and the Stanford Varsity to know that it is behind
them, win or lose, until the last whistle blows for themselves and for
S-T-A-N-F-O-R-D. W.J.L.
