### 
Following the Tuesday evening lec
ture , A. F. Whyte will give a second
speech before a Stanford audience
Wednesday morning at 10 o'clock at a
University assembly. His topic will be
"The Irish Peace" and in view of the
recent Irish disturbances, the remarks
made by a member of the British par
liament will be of unusual interest. Mr.
Whyte is a Liberal and it is expected
that he will present the British view
point as fairly and from as unbiased a
standpoint as possible.
Mr. Whyte has been interested in la
bor conditions throughout the world
and particularly those of Great Britain.
He has been kept closely in touch with
the affairs of Europe not only through
his official position in Parliament, but
through his work as editor of "The New
Europe." Mr. Whyte's views on the
Irish peace will take in the labor aspect
of the question, and from this standpoint
he is considered an authority.
Mr. Whyte has been active in promot
ing the interests of the United States
and England in the "Hands Across the
Sea" movement. Many are welcoming
Mr. Whyte and are eager to hear his
views in order to bring about a closer
understanding between the American
and British viewpoints.
