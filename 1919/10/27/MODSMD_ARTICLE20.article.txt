# ROOSEVELT, A MAN AND AN AMERICAN
## 
### 
WITH all due regard to what our personal beliefs in regard to politics may
have been, Theodore Roosevelt was, and is now considered, the greatest
American of the past generation. A man of firm convictions, straightforward
principles, and an untiring energy fully capable of carrying out his convic
tions, he has set a standard of Americanism that a hundred million people are
striving to reach.
Seldom in the course of a college generation is an opportunity given
Stanford students to do honor to a man of the caliber of Theodore Roose
velt. He was the type of person that all the world looks at and says, There
stands a man."
In every University of the country memorial assemblies are being held
today in Roosevelt's honor. Every Stanford student should turn out tonight,
pack the Memorial Church to capacity, and do the little that college students
can do in honoring one of the greatest of all Americans. JE.T.
