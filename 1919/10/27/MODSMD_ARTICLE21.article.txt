# Travesty on Fair Sex Will Precede Staging of "The First Born"
## 
### 
The drama, "The First Born," to be
given by Sword and Sandals on Novem
ber 7, will be preceded by a playlet,
"In 1919." This one-act comedy sketch
was written by William de Mille and is
a satire on "The Eternal Triangle." It
is a problem play of the future when
the women of the world will be out
making the bread and butter. The clever
little act deals only with the transposi
tion of the sex.
Past records of the playlet show that
it has met with great success. De Mille
once staged it in Hollywood at the
Community Theatre. His cast included
the noted actors, Wallace Reed, Vivian
Martin, and Louise Huff. Its success
there led to a second performance.
The sketch from start to finish is one
round of laughter. Its clever comical
arrangement makes it tremendous,
successful, practical, and amusing. As a
curtain raiser for the main play, "The
First Born," nothing could surpass this
one-act comedy. Highest recommenda
tions from theatrical authorities encour
ages Sword and Sandals of the success
112 this play.
The entire cast only includes three
actors. Those who will take part are
L. W. McDermott, '17, Margaret Shedd,
'20, and Mary Largent, '20. All three
are well known by their past experiences
in dramatics, McDermott took part in
"Stop Thief," and his sophomore play,
"Ready Money." Miss Largent played
the leading part in"It Pays to Adver
tise" and a prominent part in "Nothing
but the Truth." Miss Shedd also took
prominent parts in 'It Pays to Adver
tise' 'and "Nothing but the Truth."
With these people playing "In 1919,"
there is no doubt that it will be pro
duced in a most clever manner.
Gordon Davis, director of both plays,
announced today that Esther Flower,
*22, had been added to the cast of "The
First Born." Miss Flowers' dramatical
ability will add much the success of the
play.
