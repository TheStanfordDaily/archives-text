# BABES TRIM BERKELEY HIGH ELEVEN BY A 23-13 SCORE
## TRAGO STARS FOR 'FROSH' Three Touchdowns Are Made During Last Half of Contest 
### 
High's football team met
befeat when the Stanford freshmen
won Saturday's gridiron contest on the
local turf, by a score of 23 to 13. The
bay city squad has beaten nearly all of
the high schools around the vicinity of
the bay, and the Cardinal freshmen
eleven is the first team that has been
able to make a touchdown against
Berkeley.
Even though the "frosh" walked away
with the larger end of the score, their
playing was far from perfect. It was
not until third quarter of the game that
Coach Acker's men showed signs of
actual line bucking. At the end of the
first half the score stood against Stan
ford 13 to 3, McAlpine having dropped
the ball over the goal posts from the
30-yard line for Stanford's three points.
Trago, Cravens and Creglow were
the stars for the babes, while Dickson
and Cheek were the strongholds for the
opposing team. The freshmen are show
ing speed. Indications are that the
freshmen will be able to meet the Cali
fornia babes on equal terms by Novem
ber 15th.
