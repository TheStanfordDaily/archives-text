# SWORD AND SANDALS PROPERTIES PICKED
## Scenes From San Francisco Orient Will Arrive This Week 
### 
Word was received by Gordon Davis
director of the Chinese play, "The First
Born," to he staged by Sword and San
dals November 7, that the scenes and
properties would arrive this week. Last
week Davis, Leland Pickering, property
manager, and several members of the
cast were in Chinatown of San Fran
cisco searching for various properties
which are needed to disclose an Orien
tal atmosphere to the play. While in
the city they obtained, under consider
able expense, one of the original sets
of scenes used by Powers in his produc
tion. This is the most gorgeous set, and
it shall arrive this week with the other
properties.
Davis' plan is to set up the scene upon
their arrival and hold all following re
hearsals in them. He claims this will
give the cast more of an incentive of
the Chinese life.
Costumes for thÂ« play are being se
cured, and only the correct and extraor
dinary are chosen. Eery character will
wear a magnificent gown, superb in Ori
ental dress. Even to the most subordi
nate character minor details are carried
out to the fullest extent, according to
Coach Davis.
