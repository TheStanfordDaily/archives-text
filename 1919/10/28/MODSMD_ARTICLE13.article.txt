# START DRIVE FOR 'HUNDRED PERCENT' ROOSEVELT FUND
## 
### 
Subscriptions made to the Roosevelt
Memorial Fund should be handed in as
soon as possible. Each house and club
on the row and the different floors in
the dormitories has a representative who
will receive the subscriptions and will
report to the committee when his indi
vidual territory has made a 100 per cent
donation. Subscriptions may also be
turned in at the tables on the Quad.
Blanks were handed out following the
pssembly last night. However, those
who failed to get one at the meeting will
find them on the tables around the
Quadrangle.
It is planned to make Stanford a 100
per cent contributing college to Roose
velt's memory. All the colleges over
the country arc collecting contributions
this week, and the local committee be
lieves that Stanford will make a much
better showing against the larger and
richer colleges of the East, if the effort
is made to have Stanford a 100 per cent
contributor, instead of trying to raise
some definite amount.
The Stanford Roosevelt Memorial
Committee is: F. L. King '19 chairman;
N. H. Pctrec. '19; Ellen M. Calhoun,
'20; U. R. Gilroy, '21; Professors C. A.
Huston, and C. H. Wing.
