# MEMORIAL ASSEMBLY HONORS MEMORY OF ROOSEVELT
## KING ASKS FOR PLEDGES Dr. Jordan Tells of Personal Reminiscences In Life of the Great Leader 
### 
iSfpHEODORE ROOSEVELT was mag
nificent at his best but he was
only at his host when his heart and
his head were thoroughly in sympathy
with what he was doing. It was what
he felt, his emotions, which guided
his actions." This was the characteri
zation which Dr. Jordan gave of Theo
dore Roosevelt, at the Roosevelt as
sembly, held last night at the Memori
al Church. Dr. Gardner opened the
assembly with singing and the invo
cation followed by P. L. King, *19, who
introduced the speakers and briefly
outlined the campaign of the Roose
velt Memorial Association.
"It is not our object to raise any
great sum of money," said King, "but
it is our idea to make Stanford one
hundred per cent American. We don't
care what each student gives, just so
long as he gives something." King
went on to explain that cards would
be given out and collected during the
week and that all students would be
urged to show Stanford's appreciation
of the "Great American" by sending
in a one hundred per cenjt report.
Dr. Wilbur, the first speaker of the
evening, gave a few intimated side
lights on the character of Theodore
Roosevelt as he had met him on sev
eral occasions. President Wilbur re-
lated how Roosevelt had returned to
a Harvard Alumni dinner when most
of the alumni were antagonistic to
ward him and had completely over
come the opposition by the end of
the evening through his powerful
personality which convincingly stood
for the right. Two other incidents
were mentioned by Dr. Wilbur, those
of seeing Roosevelt in Chicago and
ater at Sagamore Hill, shortly before
his death.
The personal reminiscnnces of Dr.
Jordan were the chief attraction of
the evening. Having had the personal
friendship of Roosevelt over a con
siderable period of time, Dr. Jordan
gave an intimate picture of Roose
velt under a variety of situations and
periods of his lifetime.
"It was Roosevelt," said Dr. Jordan,
"who discovered and attacked one of
the greatest evils of American poli
tical life of the time which was known
as the 'spoils system.' Through his
vigorous work on civil service reform,
officials were not appointed to offices
of postmaster and other government
positions simple on a party basis."
Dr. Jordan told several incidents
which brought out the intimate side
of Roosevelt's character. He told of
Roosevelt's humor, which was ex
pressed by throwing his voice an
octave higher, and of his jubilant
manner of "feeling good," a thing
"which no other President of the Unit
ed States has dared to do," said Dr.
Jordan.
Special music by the choir and solo
ist, Miss Isabelle Young, *19, were ar
ranged for by Dr. Allen. In the earlier
part of the service, an anthem was
rendered by the choir and Miss Young,
followed later by a musical adapta
tion of Tennyson's poem, "Crossing
the Bar" sung by the choir.

vigorous work on civil service reform,
officials were not appointed to offices
of postmaster and other government
positions simple on a party basis."
Dr. Jordan told several incidents
which brought out the intimate side
of Roosevelt's character. He told of
Roosevelt's humor, which was ex
pressed by throwing his voice an
octave higher, and of his jubilant
manner of "feeling good," a thing
"which no other President of the Unit
ed States has dared to do," said Dr.
Jordan.
Special music by the choir and solo
ist, Miss Isabelle Young, *19, were ar
ranged for by Dr. Allen. In the earlier
part of the service, an anthem was
rendered by the choir and Miss Young,
followed later by a musical adapta
tion of Tennyson's poem, "Crossing
the Bar" sung by the choir.
iSfpHEODORE ROOSEVELT was mag
nificent at his best but he was
only at his host when his heart and
his head were thoroughly in sympathy
with what he was doing. It was what
he felt, his emotions, which guided
his actions." This was the characteri
zation which Dr. Jordan gave of Theo
dore Roosevelt, at the Roosevelt as
sembly, held last night at the Memori
al Church. Dr. Gardner opened the
assembly with singing and the invo
cation followed by P. L. King, *19, who
introduced the speakers and briefly
outlined the campaign of the Roose
velt Memorial Association.
"It is not our object to raise any
great sum of money," said King, "but
it is our idea to make Stanford one
hundred per cent American. We don't
care what each student gives, just so
long as he gives something." King
went on to explain that cards would
be given out and collected during the
week and that all students would be
urged to show Stanford's appreciation
of the "Great American" by sending
in a one hundred per cenjt report.
Dr. Wilbur, the first speaker of the
evening, gave a few intimated side
lights on the character of Theodore
Roosevelt as he had met him on sev
eral occasions. President Wilbur re-
lated how Roosevelt had returned to
a Harvard Alumni dinner when most
of the alumni were antagonistic to
ward him and had completely over
come the opposition by the end of
the evening through his powerful
personality which convincingly stood
for the right. Two other incidents
were mentioned by Dr. Wilbur, those
of seeing Roosevelt in Chicago and
ater at Sagamore Hill, shortly before
his death.
The personal reminiscnnces of Dr.
Jordan were the chief attraction of
the evening. Having had the personal
friendship of Roosevelt over a con
siderable period of time, Dr. Jordan
gave an intimate picture of Roose
velt under a variety of situations and
periods of his lifetime.
"It was Roosevelt," said Dr. Jordan,
"who discovered and attacked one of
the greatest evils of American poli
tical life of the time which was known
as the 'spoils system.' Through his
vigorous work on civil service reform,
officials were not appointed to offices
of postmaster and other government
positions simple on a party basis."
