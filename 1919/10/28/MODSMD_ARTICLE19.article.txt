# BACK TO THE GRAMMAR SCHOOL

### 
/\UR overgrown boys are again at work. Although we seem to be sure of
finding in a student body as large as ours a certain number of boys who
are still just playful children, we had hoped that this number would be very
small. In fact, we had hoped that it would be so small, that they would re
frain altogether from committing some of the various annoyances that in the
past have called attention to the fact that all university students are not
grown up. This has not been the case, aud our attention is called again
and again to the "hero-making acts of the grammar school Hallowe-en days."
The Peninsular Railroad may not give as good service as some of our fastidi
ous students desire, although it has been increased from the old twenty
minute schedule to a ten-minute service, and the small, "pay as you enter"
cars may be unpopular, but these are not excuses for the acts perpetrated
by some of the students recently. To oil the tracks, to pull trolley poles
down, and to otherwise obstruct the service is not playing fair to those loyal
students of Stanford who are endeavoring to preserve and increase her fair
name and reputation. The stealing of the car signs is not a comical prank,
it Is plain thievery, and as such should be treated. In a number of cases,
it has been the stealing by the students of student body property, for the
football signs are property of the Stanford student body. Everyone realizes
that there must be an outlet for the excessive enthusiasm of the young stu
dent but let this be done on the athletic field, or accomplished in some way
without injuring others, without lowering the reputation of the University in
the eyes of outsiders, and without a frank admission that we have with us
nr.hool boys who somehow found their way to college.
