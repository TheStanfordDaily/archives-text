# Allied Fliers Club Will Be Reorganized At Meeting Tonight
## 
### 
All men who wore wings in the war
will meet tonight in the Little Theatre
at 7 :30 to discuss chances of getting "up
in the air" again by organizing a local
branch of the Allied Fliers' Club. This
meeting has been called by Lieutenant
Robert E. O'Hanley, '22, who is still in
the air service recovering from injury
received in a fall while on duty. He
intends to have thirty or forty former
birdmen present and hopes to have the
Palo Alto branch of the Allied Fliers'
Club well organized and ready to select
a site for a local airdome. The purpose
of the club is to keep all ex-pilots in
practice through a course of regular
flights made possible through co-opera
tion with the Government. Lieutenant
O'Hanley already has the promise of the
planes from Colonel Arnold, head of the
Western Department of Aeronautics,
and it will be only a matter of time be
fore the members will have the "joy
stick" in their hands again.
The University of California unit of
the club has been promised the use of
the field, and hangars of the Durant
Aircraft Corporation and are publishing
an aeronautical journal, with the idea of
educating the public on matters of avi
ation.
