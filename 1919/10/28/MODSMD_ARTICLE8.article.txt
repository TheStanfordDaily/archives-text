# SPORT CALENDAR CALLS FOR THREE GAMES ON SATURDAY
## VARSITY vs. ST. MARY'S Second Varsity Will Play the College of the Pacific Gridiron Team 
### 
JjT. MARY'S COLLEGE vs. the Var
sity, the College of Pacific vs. the
second Varsity, and the Davis Farm
freshmen vs. the Stanford freshmen are
the three American football events on
the sport calendar for Saturday.
The St. Mary's-Varsity game will be
Stanford's fourth game of the season,
and on the basis of last Satur
day's victory over the Oregon Aggies,
the Cardinal men look good for a vic
tory. Bob Evans' men are in good
shape at present for the game, and with
the experience gained against Oregon
the Varsity will give a good account of
itself.
Shanedeman, quarter-back and one of
St. Mary's stars, is at present in the
hospital with a slight concussion of the
brain received in the Olympic Club-St
Mary's contest last Saturday, and he
may not be able to p'ay Saturday. Kau
hane, the Hawaiian half-back, and the
most brilliant performer on the team,
will be seen in Saturday's game. The
St. Mary's line is considered fairly
strong, although the Winged O backs
succeeded in plowing through for sub
stantial gains Saturday.
