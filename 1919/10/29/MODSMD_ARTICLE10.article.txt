# CLEAR OUTLINE OF IRISH SITUATION IS GIVEN BY WHYTE
## PREDICTS SOLUTION SOON Ireland Cannot Separate From Great Britain Says Authority 
### 
"Nature and Providence have so linked
England and Ireland that they cannot
be divorced. The gentlemen who pro
claimed the Irish Republic were obvi
ously living in the moon." This was the
statement made by A. F. Whyte, Mem
ber of the British Parliament, who ad
dressed a University assembly this
morning on "The Irish Peace." Mr.
Whyte gave a clear and comprehensive
outline of the Irish situation from the
standpoint of the Liberalist party.
At the opening of the war, Mr. Whyte
stated. Home Rule seemed the solution
to the Irish question. On account of the
war, which was thought to last only a
few months, a postponement of Home
Rule seemed advisable, but as the war
dragged out, the more radical element
in Ireland thought that all of their hopes
for self-government to have been de
stroyed. This plea, although not a just
one, carried great weight with the Irish
population. This deferment, coupled
with the blunder of the British War
Office in not allowing the Irish nation
ilists to form battalions of their own,
strengthened and greatly augmented the
rapidly growing Sinn Fein party.
Mr. Whyte went on to explain there-
VllicTi of Easter W- -?k, 1916, and the
decided influence this incident had upon
the British government in taking steps
toward a solution of the problem
Through the efforts of Mr. John Red
mond, leader of the Irish Nationalist
Party, the Irish convention was called
to decide upon the form of government
which Ireland was to have. This con
vention sat for eight months and then
broke up because a reasonable agree
ment could not be found among the
parties present.
Mr. Whyte attributed the failure of
the Irish Convention to the lack of
agreement among the parties and to the
technical mistake of the coalition gov
ernment, when it states that it would not
use military force to coerce Ulster to ac
cept Home Rule. Ulster entered the
convention knowing that she held the
trump card, said Mr. Whyte.
In speaking of the more recent de
velopments on the Irish question, Mr.
Whyte said that it fact that
the general election was Wld under reg
ulations made for English conditions
which gave the Sinn Fein party its ma
jority of Irish seats in Parliament. They
immediately determined to declare Ire
land a republic.
"The Sinn Fein part is a huge sys
tem of make-believe," said Mr. Whyte.
"People accepted the Sinn Fein state
ments because of the presenc of British
military force in Ireland and the reac
tion grew in direct proportion to the
amount of military force present."
Mr. Whyte concluded by predicting
a solution for Ireland in the near fu
ture, because of one of the most funda
mental changes of the war—the change
in the attitude of the British people in
favor of dominion government for Ire
land.

toward a solution of the problem
Through the efforts of Mr. John Red
mond, leader of the Irish Nationalist
Party, the Irish convention was called
to decide upon the form of government
which Ireland was to have. This con
vention sat for eight months and then
broke up because a reasonable agree
ment could not be found among the
parties present.
Mr. Whyte attributed the failure of
the Irish Convention to the lack of
agreement among the parties and to the
technical mistake of the coalition gov
ernment, when it states that it would not
use military force to coerce Ulster to ac
cept Home Rule. Ulster entered the
convention knowing that she held the
trump card, said Mr. Whyte.
In speaking of the more recent de
velopments on the Irish question, Mr.
Whyte said that it fact that
the general election was Wld under reg
ulations made for English conditions
which gave the Sinn Fein party its ma
jority of Irish seats in Parliament. They
immediately determined to declare Ire
land a republic.
"The Sinn Fein part is a huge sys
tem of make-believe," said Mr. Whyte.
"People accepted the Sinn Fein state
ments because of the presenc of British
military force in Ireland and the reac
tion grew in direct proportion to the
amount of military force present."
Mr. Whyte concluded by predicting
a solution for Ireland in the near fu
ture, because of one of the most funda
mental changes of the war—the change
in the attitude of the British people in
favor of dominion government for Ire
land.
"Nature and Providence have so linked
England and Ireland that they cannot
be divorced. The gentlemen who pro
claimed the Irish Republic were obvi
ously living in the moon." This was the
statement made by A. F. Whyte, Mem
ber of the British Parliament, who ad
dressed a University assembly this
morning on "The Irish Peace." Mr.
Whyte gave a clear and comprehensive
outline of the Irish situation from the
standpoint of the Liberalist party.
At the opening of the war, Mr. Whyte
stated. Home Rule seemed the solution
to the Irish question. On account of the
war, which was thought to last only a
few months, a postponement of Home
Rule seemed advisable, but as the war
dragged out, the more radical element
in Ireland thought that all of their hopes
for self-government to have been de
stroyed. This plea, although not a just
one, carried great weight with the Irish
population. This deferment, coupled
with the blunder of the British War
Office in not allowing the Irish nation
ilists to form battalions of their own,
strengthened and greatly augmented the
rapidly growing Sinn Fein party.
