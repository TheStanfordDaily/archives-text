# DRAMATIC FRATERNITY LOOKING FOR CHAPTER
## 
### 
To encourage the presentation of
worth-while plays the Oklahoma Agri
cultural and Mechanical College has
asked the co-operation of the Depart
ment of Public Speaking in establishing
a national Greek letter fraternity to be
known as Theta Alpha Phi.
Every department of college activity
except dramatics has a national fratern
ity of its own. Theta Alpha Phi will
welcome all college students and normal
school students who are doing work of
college grade and who have success
fully taken part in at least two college
plays. Coaches will be eligible as hon
orary members.
Appropriate pins have been designed,
and initiation ceremonies and a constitu
tion are being prepared. The purpose
of the organization will be to present
plays on a scale similar to the Little
Theatre plan. Students interested in
establishing a local chapter of the fra
ternity should consult either Mr. M. L.
McClintock or Miss E. Buckingham.
