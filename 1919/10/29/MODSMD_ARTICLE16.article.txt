# NEW TENNIS COURTS WILL BE BUILT SOON
## 
### 
As soon as arrangements can be
made for labor and material, Stanford
University is to have three new ten
nis courts erected about the site of
the present ones at Encina Gym. The
new additions are necessary to ac
commodate the large number of men
now playing tennis. Interest in the
sport has grown so rapidly that the
six courts will no longer fill the de
mands of the number of tennis en
thusiasts.
The old courts which now are in
very bad shape will he remodeled and
placed in first class condition by re
painting the lines, fixing the back
stops, installing new net posts and
touching up the surfaces where need
ed. Far mony years Stanford tennis
teams have been forced to play their
matches against California at the
Berkeley courts.
