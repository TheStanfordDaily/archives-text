# VARSITY ELEVEN IN GOOD SHAPE FOR ST. MARY'S
## EVANS WELL SATISFIED Mechanical Errors Have Been Practically Eliminated In Last Week 
### 
JJESPITE the reports from the north
that Stanford was lucky to win from
the Oregon Aggies, the Cardinal war
riors are spending their time this week
in signal practices and are not worrying
over alleged weaknesses in the line or
backfield, as indicated by the northern
papers. Boh Evans expresses himself as
very well pleased over the showing of
the Varsity and the fact that Stanford
men played a heady game, although me
chanical mistakes were frequent. Evans
states that errors can only be eliminated
by time and experience, and he antici
pates that the next two weeks will aee
the Varsity playing a better mechanical
game.
Bonney, Righter, Pelouze, Levy, Butt,
and Adams played excellent football in
the Oregon contest. These men played
steady games, using their knowledge of
football and managing to eliminate mis
takes in their work. Righter in particu
lar played an exceptionally strong game
at center. The other members of the
eleven showed up well at times, but er
rors marred their work. Bonney worked
at half back. Levy and Butt played
guards, and Pelouze and Adams offici
ated as ends.
With a good rest this week the Var
sity will meet St. Mary's Saturday on
the local gridiron with the intention of !
holding the Catholic players scoreless I
and breaking through their defense for i
scores. The St. Mary's team is con- j
sidered a strong one this season, with |
such stars as Kauhane and Shanedman
in the backfield. Both men are good
open field runners and line plungers.
The Stanford freshmen will run up
against a strong team when they meet
the Davis Farm team Saturday. This
game will be played as a curtain-raiser
to the Varsity game. The Davis Farm
men are rated as strong line plungersj
and succeeded in defeating the strong j
California babe team last Saturday 7 to!
0. However, the Bruin cubs were minus
the services of Best and Beam in the line!
and Blewett in the backfield.
