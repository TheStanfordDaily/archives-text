# LET'S PLAY OUR PART

■IHB cry of the bleachers to support the teams is an old one, and frequent
* repetition has knocked what little kick the appeal ever had out of it, but
after a comparison between the preliminary season's rooting of the Uni
versity of California students and that of our own, we hastily request that
something be done immediately. On November 22, the football relations with
California will be resumeu after a lapse of five years, the first American
fame in thirteen years will be played, and the Etai.ds will be filled to over
flowing. We must remember that in those bleachers will be not only present
stadeats, but thousands of our alumni. We must not disappoint them. Half
of the pleasure of the Big Game for the old guard is the enthusiasm of the
•Tent, the rival rooting sections couponing in novelty of stunts, and in noise
producing, and the spirit of the ojca&ion as typified by the present college
generation. Tne Blue and Gol l rooters are already* well organized. They
know the yells, the songs, and they join in the spirit of the practice with
the yell leaders. W. can not blame our yoll leaders for the lack of, what
is ordinarily termed "pep" in the bleachers. They can not learn the yells
and songs for you. They can not force you to be enthusiastic over a good
Stanford play on the field if you have no interest there. The size of the
crowds at the few early season game 3 played thus far has been encouraging
and the students seem to be behind the American game. However, when
it comes to the Big Game, to be among those present will not be enough. We
will be competing with the Blue and Gold not only on the football field, but
in the bleachers, and we want to be as successful there as we hope to be on
the gridiron itself. If the whole California rooting section can rise in a
mighty roar at the beckon of the yell leader, we can do the same. At Berkeley
a bleacher rally is staged every Thursday afternoon, with an exhibition game
is played between the varsity and freshman teams. All of the stunts are
then practiced, and the yells and songs are gone over and over until a degree
of perfection is attained. If this system will be inaugurated at Stanford, we
will make a better showing on the day of all days in the season's athletic
schedule.
