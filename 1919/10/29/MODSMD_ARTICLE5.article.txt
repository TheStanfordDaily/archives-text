# Stunt Committee Wants Symbol of Cardinal Spirit
## 
### 
That Stanford is in need of some
concrete symbol of the Cardinal spirit
as the Tiger is of Princeton, or the
Bulldog of Yale, was the conclusion
of the big game stunts' committee
which met early this week.
The committee at once will receive
suggestions to remedy this want.
It is pointed out that some real
tangible symbol or personification of
Stanford's fighting courage and power
would be a great aid in conducting of
the rallies and bleacher programs.
It is further believed that our de
ficiency in this respect will be felt
more than ever with the return of the
Big Game.
The Big Game Stunts' Committee
will therefore receive suggestions
mailed to box 1391, Campus, and will
also take suggestions by a bleacher
ballot at Saturday's game. The best
of the suggestions will be printed in
the Daily Palo Alto and will be sub
mitted to a student election.
