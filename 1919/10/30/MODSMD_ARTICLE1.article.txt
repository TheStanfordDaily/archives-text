With three football games schedul

be able to see the entire varsity squad
in action and also the freshman play
ers. The second varsity will line-up
against the College of the Pacific grid
iron artists Saturday morning at 10:30.
At 1:30 the freshmen will kick-off to
the Davis Farm team, and following
this event, the main battle between
the Varsity and St. Mary's will be
staged. Student body certificates or
50 cents will admit to the games.
Over at California, the Washington
State team evidently showed Andy
Smith that his team needs a little
Btimulant in the way of new players,
and he intends to try the experiment
of playing "Pesky" Sprott at quarter
back, and shifting Deeds to end. Cline,
the man with the boot, has been
benched for the present.
Another combination that Smith is
trying out is Getchell at quarter.
Deeds at end, and several other shifts
