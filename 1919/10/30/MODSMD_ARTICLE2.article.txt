# Freshman Squad to Meet Davis Satarday
## Coach Acker's Eleven Shows Rapid Improvement in Defensive Work 
### 
Davis Farm will meet the Stanford
freshman eleven as a curtain raiser to
the Varsity-St. Mary's gridiron contest
Saturday afternoon. It is expected that
the Davis team will give the freshmen
no end of trouble during the game, since
they were able to hold the Berkeley
freshmen to a score of 7 to 0 last week.
Coach Acker has been working his
men unusually hard during the last few
nights, trying to smooth a few of the
ragged edges on the team, and he is be
ginning to round it into good shape for
a fast team. The line is getting stronger
every night, and the defense is working
like a stone wall. The backfield will
be the same as the one played against
the Berkeley High team, which was al
ways able to work its way through the
opponents' line for the necessary yards.
Reed has been speedily improving at
half back, and will probably be account
able for a number of yards during the
game. He comes from Portland, Ore.,
where he was one of the star backfield
ers of the north. With Reed, Captain
Creglow, Douglas, and Trago, the fresh
man team should be able to push
through any line the Davis eleven can
present.
McAlpine and Farish are the strong
i holds in the line. They are both good
I utility backlield men, who are making a
showing in the line. McAlpine has been
playing football in the army for the
past year, and the Davis eleven will
have to watch his drop-kicking.
