# PASS IT BY A LARGE VOTE

### 
Â»|IOMORROW the Stanford students will be given an opportunity to express
themselves as either for or against student control. After weeks of dis
cussions, days of hard work on the part of the committee in charge of draw
ing up a suitable plan, and several conferences with the President of the
University resulting in his full approval of the proposed scheme, the Consti
tution is now up for adoption. As soon as Stanford became the normal Stan
ford of pre-war times, and as soon as the older students returned to again
take up their interrupted wcrk, a desire was expressed that the students
resume the supervision of disciplinary actions. As a result of a number of
conferences of leading students, conducted during the summer quarter, a
system of senior control was devolved. This new plan was explained by
the President of the Associated Students in the Illustrated Review, and
favorable comment of the alumni was published. At the first student body
assembly, the matter was again considered, and a committee appointed to
work over this plan, and to give attention to other systems suggested by
the students. A few minor changes were made in the original scheme, but
the complete Constitution as published in the Daily Palo Alto yesterday, is
essentially student control, with the power in the hands of the upper-class
men. It is the best system suggested, and without doubt will work success
fully If the Stanford students give it the proper amount of interest. No stu
dent control plan will be practical in a disinterested student body, and the
vote on the Quad tomorrow will show the extent of the interest of our stu
dents. They apparently want student control, and the polls will be the place
to express this wish. If they want to see representatives of the students
handle all disciplinary action in the University, they will vote yes on the
ballots tomorrow, but if they are of the opinion that the faculty should
continue to pass official judgment on student actions, their ballot will be in
the negative. What we do hope is that every student will express his opinion
on this vital subject, for a small vote tomorrow will be proof that the pessi
mists who insist that the Cardinal spirit is not as It once was, are right.
