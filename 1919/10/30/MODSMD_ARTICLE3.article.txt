# BOOKSTORE GIVES OUT REBATES THIS WEEK
## 
### 
Rebates of ten per cent on profit
sharing coupons turned into the
Stanford Bookstore before September
1, will be given out this week. The
refund, however, can be paid only at
certain hours because of other de
mands on the Cashier's time. Pay
ments will be made on Friday from
2 to 4 p.m., and on Saturday from
9:30 a.m., to 12 m., and from 2 to 4
o'clock p.m.
This is the first time since the initi
al year that the co-operative profit
sharing system was established, seven
years ago, that the rebate has reached
so high a percentage.
