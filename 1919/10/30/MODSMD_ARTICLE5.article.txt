"Little Rollo's shirt causes Louis Mc-
Dermott, '17, to break into tears." said
Gordon Davis coach of the Sword and
Sandals show which will be given at the
Assembly Hall a week from tonight.
The touching scene between Louis who
plays the husband in De Mille's "In
1999,'' and the shirt of little Rollo comes
at the crisis of Sword and Sandal's
clever curtain-raiser.
Why the sight of poor Rollo's wear
ing apparel should so affect a fond
father is a long story brilliantly told
by De Mille in this burlesque of the
"eternal problem" play. Suffice it to
say that the husband, played by McDer
mott, is, as he says in the play, "only
a poor weak man" who is torn between
love and duty.
