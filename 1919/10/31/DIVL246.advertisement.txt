Nine cases out of ten, the man
who once smokes a W I) C Pipe
becomes a life member of the W DC
club. He can't help it, because a
W ]) C is certainly a man's size smoke.
It's as sweet and mellow as carefully
selected French briar and expert sea
soning can make it. Not only material
of the first water, but craftsmanship of
the highest order, and designs that are
most pleasing —all combine to make ihe
WD C Pipe a smoke of peace,content
ment and satisfaction. A man's smoke.
Any good dealer will confirm this.
