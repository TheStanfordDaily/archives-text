# ROOSEVELT DRIVE PROVES SUCCESS IN LIVING GROUPS
## SOPHOMORES IN CHARGE Campaign Will Extend To Off-Campus Residents On Quad Monday 
### 
Stanford campus showed itself to
j be 100 per cent American today when
j practically every organization on the
"Farm" reported that every one of its
members have responded to the call for
funds to establish a memorial to the
late President Theodore Roosevelt. The
local campaign committee, which is made
up of F. L. King, '19. N. H. Petree, '19,
I Ellen M. Calhoun, '20, U. B. Gilroy, *21,
1 Professors C. A. Huston and C. H.
Wing, seemed pleased with the showing.
The sophomore class, which has taken
over the collection of these subscriptions,
; will now center their efforts on the few
| organizations that have not fully re-
I sponded, and on the off-campus resi
dents.
Tables will be placed on the Quad
rangle for the Palo Alto residents and
commuters to leave their pledges. The
committee urges their immediate re
sponse Monday morning, in order that
Stanford may send in her report at once
as being a 100 per cent college, to the
Roosevelt Memorial Drive.
