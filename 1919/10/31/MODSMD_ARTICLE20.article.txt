# GIVE THEM A HUNCH

IJIHE BIG GAME STUNTS' COMMITTEE, appointed by the President of the
* Associated Students, has requested that the whole student body think over
the proposition of a Stanford athletic symbol, and that various students offer
suggestions. So far few hunches have been handed into said committee, and
it looks as though Stanford may have to go to bat this season without a
personification of the Cardinal spirit. This would be an injustice to our
selves, for never before have we been so willing to yell our heads off for the
football team, never before have we been so anxious to defeat California, not
only on the gridiron, but in the bleachers.
To do this, we must have some tangible symbol to center our enthusiasm
on. It is all well and good to shout, "Give 'em the axe," but the axe has
been in the Blue and Gold's possession for these many years. The students
can reflect on this matter, and hand in their hunches to the Stunts' Com
mittee. They will be glad to get them, and maybe Stanford can have a Red
Lion or some such mascot who will put the Golden Bear to flight on No
vember 22.
