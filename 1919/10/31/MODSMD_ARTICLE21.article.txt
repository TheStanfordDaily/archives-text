WHEN a college society, organized for the purpose of honoring students
whose work along a particular line has been especially creditable and
designed to incite these students to further and better work along the same
line, ceases to carry out its purpose and design, that society may bo said
to have degenerated.
Such is the case with the Stanford English Club. From a strong organi
zation, consisting of members of the English department faculty and of
students who displayed a decided literary talent, it has deteriorated to the
place where students with no known literary ability are elected to member
ship and where the faculty evidently has no influence.
Much has been said upon the fact that there is no dearth of literary tal
ent on the campus at present. Much of this talent, known well enough to
be generally app-eciatei, has not been recognized by i.he English Club.
Apparently there is only one thing for the English Clug to do, if it does
not wish to be known as a society organized with no higher motives than
social congeniality. That one thing consists of a due consideration of the
principles upon which it was ariginally based and of sufficient surveillance
over its membership to see that those principles are carried out.
