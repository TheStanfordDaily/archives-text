"HAIL, STANFORD, HAIL!"
Where the rolling foothills rise
Up towards mountains higher,
Where at eve the Coast Range lies
In the sunset fire,
Flushing deep and paling
Here we raise our voices, hailing
Thee, our Alma Mater.
Refrain:
From the foothills to the bay
It shall ring,
As we sing,
It shall ring and float away,
Hail, Stanford, hail!
Hail, Stanford, hail!
"COME, JOIN THE BAND."

And give a cheer for Stanford red;
Throughout the land

Each loyal comrade brave and true,
With might and main sing this refrain,
"Forever and forever Stanford Red."
"BERKELEY'S TOMBSTONE"
The writing on the tombstone
Of the husky Berkeley crowd,

Underneath a red, red sod,
And the Card'nal waves supremely
Above the Stanford Quad.

Where the rolling foothills rise
Up towards mountains higher,
Where at eve the Coast Range lies
In the sunset fire,
Flushing deep and paling
Here we raise our voices, hailing
Thee, our Alma Mater.
Refrain:
From the foothills to the bay
It shall ring,
As we sing,
It shall ring and float away,
Hail, Stanford, hail!
Hail, Stanford, hail!
"COME, JOIN THE BAND."
Come join the Band,
And give a cheer for Stanford red;
Throughout the land
Our banner waving overhead;
Stanford for you,
Each loyal comrade brave and true,
With might and main sing this refrain,
"Forever and forever Stanford Red."
"BERKELEY'S TOMBSTONE"
The writing on the tombstone
Of the husky Berkeley crowd,
Will be carved a little deeper
While our shouting rings out loud:
Old Berkeley's dead and buried
Underneath a red, red sod,
And the Card'nal waves supremely
Above the Stanford Quad.
