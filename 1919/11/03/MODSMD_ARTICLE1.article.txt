### 
football playing de
feated the St. Mary's eleven Satur
day, and the Stanford Varsity contin
ued its winning streak started in Ore
gon last week by piling up 34 points to
0 against the Catholic team. The Cardi
nal men out-licked, out-smashed, out
ran, out-thought, and in general out
played the visitors from start to finish.
Occasional spurts with forward passes
and a couple of long runs by Kauhane
were the only attempts that the Oakland
players made to worry the Stanford
men.
As a whole the Stanford eleven
worked in fine shape, despite the fact
that several of the men were working in
new positions. Captain Caughey was a
surprise at half back. He proved to
be an excellent ground gainer through
the line, and Patrick also worked well in
the back field. Pelouze and Templeton
worked the on-side kick to perfection
for the first two touchdowns. Pelouze
played a steady game throughout.
In the first few minutes of play
"Dink" Templeton sent a beautiful 80-
yard punt over Correa's head, the St.
Mary's quarterback. Pelouze went down
on the ball fast, and before Correa woke
up to what was happening, the Stanford
end had placed the ball between the
goal posts. Templeton converted. After
the kick-off, Reynolds and Caughey pro
ceeded to gain through the Catholic line
until the 10-yard line was reached and
a forward pass failed on the fourth
down. Correa punted back up the field,
and a moment later Templeton worked
the on-side kick again, and Pelouze car
ried the pigskin over for the second
touchdown. Templeton added another
point by converting.
St. Mary's opened up the second quar
ter by working the delayed forward pass
for 20 yards, Correa to Snow. Kau
hane and Correa worked the ball up
into Stanford territory, and for the sec
ond time the Cardinal line repulsed the
attack and forced the visitors to give up
the ball on downs.
Correa, playing back on the defensive
seemed to have trouble in holding Tem
pleton's punts, since he managed to fum
ble four of "Dink's" long spirals.
The next Stanford touchdown came in
the third quarter. After a series of
line bucks by Caughey and Holt, which
brought the play well down into St.
Mary's territory, Holt carried the ball
over. Templeton kicked the goal. Holt
scored again later in the quarter after
he made a 25-yard run to the visitor's
25-yard line. Again Templeton con
verted.
Patrick, replacing Templeton at full
back, scored the last touchdown in the
fourth quarter. Two forward passes
caught by Pelouze and several end runs
enabled Patrick to make the final score.
The conversion failed, making the final
score 34 to 0.
A total of 303 yards was annexed by
the Stanford backs during the game to
a total of 150 secured by St. Mary's.
Stanford made seven first downs and St.
Mary's six. Templeton out-kicked Cor
rea badly, the average for Stanford be
ing 45 2-10 yards, and for St. Mary's
291-2 yards. The Catholic players at
tempted to play an open field game with
their forward passes, but out of 19 at
tempts only 3 were completed. Of this
number the Cardinals intercepted 5 and
11 failed. However, the three com
pleted passes netted 70 yards.

the third quarter. After a series of
line bucks by Caughey and Holt, which
brought the play well down into St.
Mary's territory, Holt carried the ball
