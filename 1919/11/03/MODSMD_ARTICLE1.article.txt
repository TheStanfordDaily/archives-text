# VARSITY OVERWHELMS ST. MARY'S IN FAST GAME
## STANFORD TEAM PLAYS CONSISTENT BALL Cardinal Piles Up 34-0 Score On the Men From Oakland 
### 
football playing de
feated the St. Mary's eleven Satur
day, and the Stanford Varsity contin
ued its winning streak started in Ore
gon last week by piling up 34 points to
0 against the Catholic team. The Cardi
nal men out-licked, out-smashed, out
ran, out-thought, and in general out
played the visitors from start to finish.
Occasional spurts with forward passes
and a couple of long runs by Kauhane
were the only attempts that the Oakland
players made to worry the Stanford
men.
As a whole the Stanford eleven
worked in fine shape, despite the fact
that several of the men were working in
new positions. Captain Caughey was a
surprise at half back. He proved to
be an excellent ground gainer through
the line, and Patrick also worked well in
the back field. Pelouze and Templeton
worked the on-side kick to perfection
for the first two touchdowns. Pelouze
played a steady game throughout.
In the first few minutes of play
"Dink" Templeton sent a beautiful 80-
yard punt over Correa's head, the St.
Mary's quarterback. Pelouze went down
on the ball fast, and before Correa woke
up to what was happening, the Stanford
end had placed the ball between the
goal posts. Templeton converted. After
the kick-off, Reynolds and Caughey pro
ceeded to gain through the Catholic line
