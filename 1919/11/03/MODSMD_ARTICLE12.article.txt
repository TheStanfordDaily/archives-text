# FIRST BAND CONCERT WILL FEATURE SONG RALLY ON THURSDAY
## 
### 
Stanford's reorganized band of forty
eight pieces under the leadership of Pro
fessor E. W. Martin of the Greek De
partment, will give its initial public con
cert in the music shell Thursday after
noon at 4 :15. This will be the begin
ning of a series of concerts to be given
in the Stanford shell throughout the
fall.
An added feature of the concerts this
fall will be the inauguration of a song
rally at the end of the program. Yell
leader W. T. Martin will lead the audi
ence in five of the songs to be used in
the Big Game with U. C. With this
big event short of three weeks away he
urges all to learn the five songs as
listed below or bring them to the rally.
The songs which will be sung are:
"Cardinal Fighting Song," "Berkeley's
Tombstone." "Cardinal Is Waving,"
"Sons of Stanford," and "Come, Join
the Band."
Professor Martin is anxious to secure
three more instruments for the bandâ€”
a bassoon, cornet, and saxophone. Any
one who can play any of these instru
ments should see Professor Martin at
once.
