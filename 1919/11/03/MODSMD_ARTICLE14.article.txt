# BABES TAKE FAST GAME FROM DAVIS FARM
## FRESHMEN BEAT 'AGGIES' Game Is Featured by Fast Plays and Long Runs 
### 
the Davis Farm eleven by
a larger score than the Bruin fresh
men, the Stanford freshman team ended
its game last Saturday with a final tally
of 19 to 6. The game was the prettiest
American match that has been played
on the Cardinal field for a number of
years, although the score indicates a
walk-away. The backfield was some
what handicapped through the absence
of Captain Creglow at full, and Trago
at quarter, who were both out of the
game with minor injuries.
Davis made their lone 6 points in the
first quarter, when Huber, their left
end, caught a forward pass, gaining them
35 yards, placing the ball on the fresh
man 15-yard line. Stanford came back
in the second quarter.
In the third quarter, after a series of
line-bucking plays, Cravens again took
the ball over for the freshmen's second
touchdown. Five minutes later the ball
was again bucked to Davis* line, when
Douglas touched it over. McAlpine con
verted.
