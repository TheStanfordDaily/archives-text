Praising the University system in Eu
rope, D. B. Carroll, '16, gives his ideas
on what he thinks is a real University
in an article written for the November

Carroll's article, entitled "College Ed
ucation at Oxford," gives interesting
sidelights on the routine of the great
English university and endorses their
