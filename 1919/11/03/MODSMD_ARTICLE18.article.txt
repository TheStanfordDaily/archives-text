# BLOWING OFF STEAM

117E print today in our news, columns an article clipped from the Sunday
morning San Jose Mercury-Herald. We print it because the article and
the spirit that prompted the College of Pacific manager, when he gave out
the interview, is already known in circles outside of the University, and the
Stanford students should know well their ground when called upon, as they
undoubtedly will be, to defend the sportmanship of this University. On the
surface, it looks as though things were slipping here, that the days of abso
lute fair play to all, as typified under the coaching regime of Floyd Brown,
are over. A closer examination into the facts of the case, proves otherwise,
and we are happy to be able to say that Mr. Sperry has been "blowing off
steam" in a useless manner. In fact, the Stanford second varsity and the
College of Pacific were slat'ed to play a week ago, but as the College team
wanted to take a trip to Reno to meet the University of Nevada eleven, the
Stanford student manager willingly postponed the contest. About the middle
of last week, the Cardinal coaches informed the manager of the College of
Pacific team, that the game scheduled at College Park would have to be
played at Stanford, because of the number of injuries on the Stanford
varsity squad, and that a Stanford eleven would have to include men who
at times played on the varsity. Therefore, tha visitors did not come to Stan
ford last Saturday under any false impressions. To be sure, several men
were used who are virtually regular varsity men, but this was done of neces
sity. After all, the only reason advanced by our football authorities for the
scheduling of second varsity gtÂ».mes, is to give the coaches an opportunity
of watching possible varsity material, and this was what was done on Satur
day.
