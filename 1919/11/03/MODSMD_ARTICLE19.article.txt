English Club is certainly degenerat
ing when the writer of a "Contributed
Editorial" to The Daily Palo Alto be
came the self-appointed judge as to
the special fitness of our newly elected,
unoffending members to the Club. If
the intention was to offend and in
sult the new members, it goes without
saying that the article was a huge
success. It was doubtless a pleasant
surprise to the people elected to dis
cover that they were possessed of "no
literary ability" or any other known
qualifications for membership, when
there is so much of this literary talent
running around unseen and unappreci
ated apparently by English Club or
by anybody else. Perhaps it would be
well for the writer of the "Contributed
Editorial" to submit a list of prospects
judged by his or her own standards
as to what constitutes eligibility to
English Club. Comparisons, though
odious, might be interesting.
It has not been the accustomed pri

vilege of members of The Daily Palo
Alto's staff to make its editorial
columns a personal stamping ground
for private irritation in connection
with the actions and methods of stu
dent organizations. Inclusion under
the editor's column largely gives edi
torial sanction, which in this case
would seem impossible, and contrary
to the policy of the paper, which has
been to keep it free from personal
knocking. Under "Another View
point," it would go very well, and
moreover would give the writer, who
appears vitally concerned in the mem
bership of English Club, an opportuni
ty to sign his or her name.
