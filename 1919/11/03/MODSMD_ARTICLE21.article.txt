UNFAIR TREA'l MENT IS CHARGED
STANFORD—CLAIM MADE THAT
VARSITY PLAYERS WERE USED
ON SECOND TEAM IN GAME
STANFORD 2d, 38; COLLEGE OF
THE PACIFIC, 0.
Stanford second varsity defeated the
College of the Pacific yesterday morn
ing by the score of 38 to 0. The game
was played at Stanford, although
originally scheduled for the College of
the Pacific field.
In this connection Coach Sperry
comes to bat with a straight-from
the-shoulder charge of unfair treat
ment directed at the Stanford foot
ball authorities.
Not only did Stanford insist on a
last-minute change in the plans made
for playing the game 011 the Pacific
gridiron, after the game had been ex
tensively advertised by the Pacific
manager, but, Sperry says, they also
rang in several varsity players during
the course of the game, men who play
ed again in the afternoon against St.
Mary's.
The Pacific squad, although it is
still less than a month since they
turned out for their first practice,
and, although they have gone down
to overwhelming defeats at the hands
of the California freshmen and the
University of Nevada elevens, have
shown considerable improvement of
late, and Sperry feels that had the
game yesterday come off as planned,
against a bona-fide Stanford second
varsity and on the home field, the
Orange and Black would have been re
turned the winner.
"Since when," asks Sperry, "have
'Dink* Templeton, Danney Carroll,
Pershing, Campbell, Patrick and Rey
nolds ben anything but varsity foot
ball men at Stanford. Those six, and
one or two others, were 011 the 'sec
ond varsity' which played us yester
day. They all played for Stanford
against St. Mary's in the varsity game
yesterday afternoon, also.
"A few years ago we knew that
when we scheduled a game with the
second varsity it would be the sec
ond varsity which we would go up
against. That was when Floyd Brown
was in charge of football at Stan
ford. Apparently it's a different situa
tion now. Again3t a real Stanford sec
ond team we would have had an
even chance of winning yesterday's
game, especially if it had been played
on our home grounds as scheduled.
"As it is the dispatch is sent out
that the College of the Pacific was
beaten by the Stanford second varsity.
We weren't, unless Evans claims that
Templeton, Carroll Pershing, Camp
bell, and the rest of them are not good
enough for his first team. And he
won't claim that. Every one of those
men will be on the Stanford team
that plays California, and it is a sure
thing that that team won't be adver
tised as the Stanford second team."

late, and Sperry feels that had the
game yesterday come off as planned,
against a bona-fide Stanford second
varsity and on the home field, the
Orange and Black would have been re
turned the winner.
"Since when," asks Sperry, "have
'Dink* Templeton, Danney Carroll,
Pershing, Campbell, Patrick and Rey
nolds ben anything but varsity foot
ball men at Stanford. Those six, and
one or two others, were 011 the 'sec
ond varsity' which played us yester
day. They all played for Stanford
against St. Mary's in the varsity game
yesterday afternoon, also.
"A few years ago we knew that
when we scheduled a game with the
second varsity it would be the sec
ond varsity which we would go up
against. That was when Floyd Brown
was in charge of football at Stan
ford. Apparently it's a different situa
tion now. Again3t a real Stanford sec
ond team we would have had an
even chance of winning yesterday's
game, especially if it had been played
on our home grounds as scheduled.
"As it is the dispatch is sent out
that the College of the Pacific was
beaten by the Stanford second varsity.
We weren't, unless Evans claims that
Templeton, Carroll Pershing, Camp
bell, and the rest of them are not good
enough for his first team. And he
won't claim that. Every one of those
men will be on the Stanford team
that plays California, and it is a sure
thing that that team won't be adver
tised as the Stanford second team."

UNFAIR TREA'l MENT IS CHARGED
STANFORD—CLAIM MADE THAT
VARSITY PLAYERS WERE USED
ON SECOND TEAM IN GAME
STANFORD 2d, 38; COLLEGE OF
THE PACIFIC, 0.
Stanford second varsity defeated the
College of the Pacific yesterday morn
ing by the score of 38 to 0. The game
was played at Stanford, although
originally scheduled for the College of
the Pacific field.
In this connection Coach Sperry
comes to bat with a straight-from
the-shoulder charge of unfair treat
ment directed at the Stanford foot
ball authorities.
Not only did Stanford insist on a
last-minute change in the plans made
for playing the game 011 the Pacific
gridiron, after the game had been ex
tensively advertised by the Pacific
manager, but, Sperry says, they also
rang in several varsity players during
the course of the game, men who play
ed again in the afternoon against St.
Mary's.
The Pacific squad, although it is
still less than a month since they
turned out for their first practice,
and, although they have gone down
to overwhelming defeats at the hands
of the California freshmen and the
University of Nevada elevens, have
shown considerable improvement of
late, and Sperry feels that had the
game yesterday come off as planned,
against a bona-fide Stanford second
varsity and on the home field, the
Orange and Black would have been re
turned the winner.
