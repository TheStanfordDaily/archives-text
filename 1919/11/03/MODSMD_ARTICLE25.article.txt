# CLASSES WILL STAGE WATER POLO BATTLES
## 
### 
Interclass competition under the
intramural athletic plan will begin
this week when the four classes meet
at water polo in the Encina pool. The
first game is scheduled between the
freshmen and the juniors, on Wed
nesday afternoon and the second
round is between the seniors and the
sophomores on Friday. The winners
of these two games will play for the
championship on the following Mon
day.
Close competition is expected as all
classes can put a team of strong
swimmers in the field. From a com
parison of strength the juniors have
a slight edge since three of their
players are on the varsity team.
Coach Brandsten wishes large turn
outs for these games as more materi
al is desired for the college team
which still has a long schedule to ful
fill.
