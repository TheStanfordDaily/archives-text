# SECOND VARSITY WINS LOOSE GAME FROM C. OF P. TEAM
## 
### 
Playing a ragged game of football
that lackcd the smoothness of perfect
teamwork the second varsity defeated
the team of the College of the Pacific
Saturday morning by a score of 35 to 0.
Due to the fact that several men were
unable to play on account of injuries,
Coach Evans was forced to make some
last-minute changes in the line-up,
which accounts for the lack of team
work. Several men who played in the
St. Mary's game had to be used in this
game.
