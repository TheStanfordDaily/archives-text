# RUDOLPH GANZ IS PRAISED FOR WORK IN HEALY CONCERT
## 
### 
Rudolph Ganz. the eminent pianist
who will be heard at Stanford on No
vember 19, under the direction of
Frank W. Healy, is looking for the
genius who can draw a composite pic
ture of him as he has impressed the
critics in various parts of the world.
A Bostonian said: "He plays as Mans
field acts." A Denver critic said: "He
plays as Melba sings." A Swiss critic
said: "He reminds me of Rubcnstein
when at the piano." A Chicago critic
said: "He attacks the piano as Rosen
thal did." Nobody has ever found a
striking resemblance between the late
railroad magnates, Jay Gould and J. J.
Hill, yet a Los Angeles writers says that
Ganz is the Jay Gould of pianists, and a
St. Paul man compares him to J. J. Hill.
Season tickets will be on sale for the
three concerts in the Healy course until
November 8 at the Bookstore and at
Crandall's in Palo Alto.
