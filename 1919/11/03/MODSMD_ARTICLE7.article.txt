First Born."
"The First Born" will mark the re
turn of campus theatricals to the field of
more serious drama. During the past
year the campus boards were limited
to the production of farce and musical
comedy. In producing this Chinese
drama, the Sword and Sandals Society
feels that while it is not attempting any
intellectual uplift among Stanford the
atregoers it is nevertheless catering to
tastes that have recently been neglected.
The success of "Justice" produced three
years ago, which was the last serious
piece of work to be done here, has en
couraged Sword and Sandals Society in
its present production.
"The First Born" is unique among
plays as far as Californians are con
cerned. It combines the local color of
their own locality with a piece of excel
lent dramatic merit. The play was orig
inally produced in San Francisco in 1898
with a San Francisco setting.
Davis announced the addition of Miss
Helen McCormack, '20, to the cast of
"The First Born." She will take the
part of one of the Chinatown visitors.
