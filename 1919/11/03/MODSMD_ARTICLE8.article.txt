### 
Stanford was revenged for her defeat
at the hands of the Olympic Club eleven
in American football, when the Cardinal
rugby fifteen, after sweeping every
thing before it in the last half, took the
winged O men into camp last Saturday
by a score of 21 to 17.
The club men had a number of old
rugby stars in their line-up and were
as strong as they were last year. Stan
ford, on the other hand, took the field
with an entirely new machine, many of
whose members had never played to
gether. In spite of its handicap, the
play of the Cardinal team was smooth
and fast throughout the contest, and
most of the tries resulted from brilliant
team-work.
The Olympics were in the lead at the
opening of the last half, but two Stan
ford tries put the University in ad
vance of their opponents, and the club
men were unable to solve the Cardinal
defense for further scores. Doe, Her
ron. Card, Hayes, and James were
among the players whose work shone
for Stanford.
Thanks to its play in the Olympic con
test, the University team will go into
the Australian game next Saturday a fa
vorite. Coach Wylie stated that he was
well satisfied with the showing made by
the University fifteen and predicted vic
tory for Stanford in the coming series
with the University of California.
