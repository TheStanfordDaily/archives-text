A great statesman once said,
I'd rather be right than President
The discriminating smoker says: —"I'd rather pay
20 Cents for a box of ten Murads, THE Turkish
cigarette, than for a hundred ordinary cigarettes."
Why? Because Murads are made of 100 % pure
Turkish tobacco — said Turkish tobacco is the
world's most famous tobacco for cigarettes.
