# STRENGTH, PASSION AND INTRIGUE DOMINATE NOVEL PLAY
## CHINESE SETTING GRIPS Sword and Sandals Present Skilled Cast In "The First Born" 
### 
STRENGTH, PASSION, AND COLOR,
are the dominant qualities of "The
First Born," Francis Power's drama
of Chinatown life, that will be pre
sented by Sword and Sandals in the
Assembly Hall, next Friday evening.
The color of the drama is not one of
mere costuming, it is brought about
rather by a powerful portrayal of the
intricate working of a Chinese soul.
Coach Gordon Davis, '18, frankly ad
mits that when it was decided to put
on "The First Born," that he doubted
if he could find a cast on the Stanford
campus that could fill the exacting,
emotional roles that the piece requir
ed. Since the rehearsals have been in
progress, however, he feels that he
has been more than fortunate in get
ting his share of talent for his pro-1
duction. The c ast entered into the!
spirit of the play immediately, and ,
seems to be perfectly adapted to its
demands.
The leading man, James Quimby,
'18, is showing almost an uncanny
grasp of his part. It is the character
of a Chinese, jealous, haunted by the
fear of his enemies, and thirsting to
revenge the murder of his child. One
of the strongest bits in the play comes
just before the final curtain when
this broken-hearted, crazed Chinaman J
takes his horrible revenge on his i
enemy. The realism of Quinby's act- j
ing at this point makes one shudder. J
Two young children of Dean J. E. ,
McDowell have also been added to the
cast, Davis announced today. Although !
this will be their first bow before the
spotlight, the youngsters are showing
real thespian ability.
Today's ticket drawings started the i
' reserved seat sale for the Sword and j
Sandals production. They will remain
on sale at the Bookstore and at Cran
dall's in Palo Alto, until the night of
t' e performance, when they will be
on sale at the gate of the Assembly
Hall.
