## 
### 
"This institution must choose before
long whether it will continue its present
system of instruction or devote itself to
higher education onl>," said David Starr
Jordan before a meeting of the Cosmo
politan Club last night.
Dr. Jordan said it was his wish to
see Stanford specialize in higher educa
tion. By this plan the first two years,
which is only preliminary work, could
l)e taken some place else, preferably in a
junior college, the idea of which was
advanced by Dr. Jordan sometime ago.
Under this plan the University could
offer a much higher standard of work
for the upper classes.
"The ideal of Stanford is the ideal of
service, of doing something worth
while," said Dr. Jordan, in sketching the
University as he has known it since its
early days. "It is not only the idea of
knowing something to make money, but
to know it well, to make it count for
something." Dr. Jordan believes this
can best be done by specialized training;
that is, giving the students the courses
they want and like.
Eight new members were elected to
the club after the address. The follow
ing students were elected: Vaughan
Hosepian, Vesta Wills, Elinor Beach,
Tetusuro O'Shena, Albert Muller, Mary
Wildman, Clara Collins, and R D'Sousa.
