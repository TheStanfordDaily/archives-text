# RED CROSS ON THURSDAY
## 
### 
STANFORD is asked to come to the front in another drive. To many it seems
that the University has been drained dry by the ever increasing demands
on the pocketbooks of the students, but a request from the American Red
Cross strikes a note of approval from all. Ii has been announced that a
campaign will be launched here at Stanford on Thursday to secure a one
hundred percent membership in this splendid organization. The history of
the Red Cross in the war has proved to the world the great need for such a
society, and the deeds of its members, the records of its sacrifices, and the
recognition it inspired has demonstrated its accomplishments. To be a mem
ber of the American Red Cross is a privilege that university students will
appreciate. The committee in charge of Stanford's campaign can be as
sured that the University is behind it, and that on Thursday particularly
every student will be wearing the button insignia of the American Red Cross.
