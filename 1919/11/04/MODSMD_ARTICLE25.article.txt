Aware of the great anxiety prevalent
among a certain class of people at this
time of year, Ye Column Scribe comes
out with the following suggestions for
SUBJECTS FOR MASTER'S THESES.
The suggestions will probably also be
of great value to any Prof, who is
planning on contributing to the Mod
ern Language Review, Philological
Journal, or other hvphertrophically in
tellectual channels. "Academic Exer
cise" is the keynote of our suggestions.
The list is short only because most
available subjects have already been
used.
1. What was Shakespeare's attitude
toward short-haired mongrels?
2. Did Rill Shakespeare prefer them
"straight"
3. How did Meredith spend his Sat
urday nights?
4. Why ruled the Nations when
Carrie went on strike?
5. Would Cleopatra have a chance
with Zeigfeld's Folly Girls?
