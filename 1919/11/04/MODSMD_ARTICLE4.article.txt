# Church Excursion Will Be Repeated Friday
## 
### 
The architecture, history, and sym
bolism of the Memorial Church as ex
plained by Chaplain C. D. Gardnet 1
proved so interesting to the three hun
dred students who were conducted
through the church last week that Dr.
Gardner has consented to repeat his lec
ture.
The excursion will start at 4:20 next
Friday afternoon and will be open to
everyone.
