# FORMAL BIDDING SYSTEM ADOPTED BY FRATERNITIES
## Pledging Date Set for December 7 
### 
ADOPTION of the lawyer system of
** bidding and pledging freshmen, was
made last night at a special meeting
of the interfraternity conference.
Bidding day will be Sunday, Decem
ber 7, and all bids are to be in the
hands of the lawyer on Thursday pre
ceding that date.
This decision, which was made as
an amendment to the by-laws of the
interfraternity conference, makes the
fraternity rushing season considerable
shorter and does away with the prob
lems which were bound to arise as to
rushing proceedure during final exami
nation week and Christmas vacation.
As adopted, the system differs from
that used by the sororities only in
minor details. Instead of expressing
his preference directly to the lawyer,
the man receiving a bid will mark
the fraternities from which he would
consider a bid in the order of his
preference on an alphabetical list be
fore the lawyer. He will then be told
to what fraternity he will become a

pledge.
With the bids going in on Thursday
there will be ample time for the lawyer
to mail out notices to the freshmen to
appear before him.
No informal pledging will be al
lowed after the formal bidding until
a date to be decided later by the inter
fraternity conference. The object of
this action is to prevent any injustice
to a man whose bid many have been
lost or misplaced.
The by-laws of the conference were
also amended so as to prevent pledge
lifting, by providing that any fresh
man who breaks his pledge cannot
be pledged to another fraternity for
the period of one year.
The Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity
was found guilty of breaking the by
laws of the conference by wrongfully
initiating a pledge, and were given
the minimum penalty which provides
for the publication of the offense in
Ive consecutive issues of the Daily
Palo Alto.
