# EVANS WILL USE FIVE BACKFIELD MEN SATURDAY
## PREDICTS CLOSE GAME Captain Caughey Will Be Among Plungers In St. Mary's Fracas 
### 
IIHTH only five backfield men in shape
to play, Coach Bob Evans is facing
a hard proposition this week with the
Santa Clara game, one of the hardest
of the season coming up Saturday. Cap
tain Caughey, Carroll, Holt, Patrick, and
Templeton are the only men that can
be used behind the line against Santa
Clara. The men who are on the injured
list will be in shape for the California
game, however, so the dearth of backs is
only temporary.
Caughey played his first game in the
backfield Saturday and surprised the
blcacherites with his performance. "Reg"
has the build of a line plunger and is
fast enough on his feet to get away
with backfield duty. Carroll is rapidly
getting over his old rugby habit of run
ning straight across the field. He gained
considerable ground in the St. Mary's
game and hit the line a good deal better
than he did in his first game. Patrick,
who worked in the backfield on the
S. A. T. C. team is a hard worker, and
bis performance in both games Satur
day will justify Evans in using him
against Santa Clara. Patrick is able to
substitute for Templeton at fullback in
case "Dink" injures his leg, and he can
also work in at one of the ends in case
of necessity. "Pret" Holt has been out
or the game for a few days, but he
probably will work against the Mission 1
team.
In order to familiarize the student
body with the players and to distinguish
them when in the game Coach Evans
has announced the following numbers I
