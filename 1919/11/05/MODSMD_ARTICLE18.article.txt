# HOW DO THEY GET THAT WAY?

«||OW do they get that way?", the old alumnus asked at the varsity foot
ball game between Stanford and St. Mary's last Saturday, and we are
compelled to ask ourselves the same question. One does not have to go back
to the often quoted, "good, old days," to remember when sportmanlike con
duct in athletics was one of the things most highly prized by the Stanford
students. Every follower of the Cardinal took pleasure in the fact that not
only did visiting teams receive good treatment from our athletes, but the
Stanford bleachers gave them a square deal in all contests. Things seem
to have changed, or perhaps it was merely a slip due primarily to ignorance
of the American game and its rules. During the contests 'last Saturday,
occasion arose for the referee to penalize the visiting teams, and what a
roar of approval went up from the Cardinal bleachers. But when this same
referee marched the Stanford eleven back many yards for a violation of the
rules, the moans and groans could almost be heard in Palo Alto. Stanford
has never before ragged the officials for their interpretation of the rules, and
now is a poor time to begin, especially when it is doubtful if the bleachers
know much about them. If we want to preserve our reputation as one of
the most sportsmanlike institutions competing in athletics we will have to
watch our bleacher conduct. We don't have to worry about the teams. The
Stanford athletes will always play the game fair and square, but the bleachers
"booing" of both officials and opposing players will soon give us an unsavory
name in outside circles.
