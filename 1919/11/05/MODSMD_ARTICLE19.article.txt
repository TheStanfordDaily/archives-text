Not knowing who the industrious
reporter is who has twice made false
statements in the San Francisco
Chronicle in regard to Stanford sorori
ty bids, one can do no more than to
call attention to the errors.
Yesterday an article announced that
"the acceptance of bids showed a 30
per cent, drop and the sorority girls
are still looking for the reason." An
authentic statement from the presi
dent of the Pan-Hellenic, based on
exact data furnished by the ten so
roritis, gives the figures as 50 who ac
cepted bids and 9 who were undecided
out of the total 59 who were bid.
This gives a percentage of .152, or
almost exactly one-half of the 30 per
cent given by the Chronicle.
The same data furnished by the
houses shows that of the 9 who were
undecided, only one never intends to
join any sorority. The other eight
could not make up their minds, at
the time, which sorority they wished
to join.
The first erroneous statement ap

peared in the Chronicle at the time
of the bidding, and contained a mis
statement of per cents similar to that
of yesterday's article.

President Pan-Hellenic.
