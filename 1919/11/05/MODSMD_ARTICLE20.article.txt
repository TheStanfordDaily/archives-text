# INDUSTRIAL LECTURES PLANNED BY Y.W.C.A.
## 
### 
A series of three industrial lectures
is planned by the Y. W. C. A. to show
how the employer and the employee of
the large business establishments must
act in solving problems along industrial
lines.
The first of the series will be given at
the Y. W. C. A. meeting tomorrow when
an employee of one of the large corpora
tions of San Francisco will address the
meeting and tell of the problems that
face her and her fellow workers. The
speaker will not be a member of the
Y. W. C. A., but will represent the av
erage girl employed in a large institu
tion.
