# COSTLY SCENES ARE PLANNED FOR "THE FIRST BORN"
## 
### 
Dim lights, an incensed Chinese at
mosphere, and hushed, plotting voices
pervade the first act of "The First
Born," the Sword and Sandals produc
tion to be given in the Assembly Hall
Friday night.
The play, according to Coach Davis,
is first and last one of atmosphere, and
to produce the desired effect all the de-

mands of Chinatown costuming and
scenery had to he satisfied. Through the
efforts of the management of the pro
duction and the personal influence of
Coach Gordon Davis, the original profes
sional scenic set has been procured for
this single presentation at Stanford. The
set for the first scene is a marvel for
beauty and completeness and easily sur-

passes anything in the way of settings
ever seen on the campus. An entire
Chinatown street scene is graphically
laid out.
In procuring this set, as well as that
for the second act, the management has
been very fortunate, for such sets would
be well beyond the pocket of any stu
dent dramatic society under ordinary
circumstances. Walter Belasco, a mem
ber of the original cast of "The First
Born," has offered his costume for the
part of the ragpicker, which is played by
Otto Nagel, '20, in the campus presen
tation. Another bit of evidence of the
intense interest that the show is caus
ing in San Francisco is the fact that the
San Francisco Chronicle is sending down
Miss Marjorie Driscoll, its dramatic
critic, to review the performance.
H. I. Mitchell, '20, has a part that few
would envy. "Man Low Yak" is the
villain of the piece and is played by
Mitchell. "Man Low Yak," although
often referred to in the piece, puts in
his appearance just before the final cur
tain to die at the hands of his enemy,
which altogether makes it a not very
desirable role.
