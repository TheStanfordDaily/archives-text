# COSTLY SCENES ARE PLANNED FOR "THE FIRST BORN"
## 
### 
Dim lights, an incensed Chinese at
mosphere, and hushed, plotting voices
pervade the first act of "The First
Born," the Sword and Sandals produc
tion to be given in the Assembly Hall
Friday night.
The play, according to Coach Davis,
is first and last one of atmosphere, and
to produce the desired effect all the de-

mands of Chinatown costuming and
scenery had to he satisfied. Through the
efforts of the management of the pro
duction and the personal influence of
Coach Gordon Davis, the original profes
sional scenic set has been procured for
this single presentation at Stanford. The
set for the first scene is a marvel for
beauty and completeness and easily sur-


James Quinby, '18, arid Ruth Elsinger,
'20, do a Chinese Romeo and Juliet
act in"The First Born" next Fri
day night.
