Keep in step with fashion
In Walking Boots
that will tread the paths
of economy and style
For autumn tramps in California one needs a brisk breeze,
a gay-colored sports costume, a twisting road, the right
companion and a smart boot, built for comfort and style.
It has to be that kind of a shoe that can cover miles and
miles and never let you know it's there. And just as es
sentially, it has to be so smart that you can drop in for
a cup of tea or other refreshment at Wilson's on your re
turn, looking trimly shod, rather than looking as if you
had just come ploughing through the wastes of "No Man's
Land."
The model pictured is Laird Schober's Saigaisne boot
developed both in finest Brown and Mahogany Russia
Calf. Other models in the Feather-Tread line are also
ready, including some with not quite such pointed toes.
The prices progress in easy steps from NINE to EIGH
TEEN DOLLARS and a HALF.
At Herold's you will find smart shoes for every possible
occasion, at prices which are not impossible.
