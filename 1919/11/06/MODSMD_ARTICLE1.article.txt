# "THE FIRST BORN" PORTRAYS UNUSUAL ORIENTAL STAGING
## REHEARSAL IS TONIGHT Play Will Be Presented In Assembly Hall Tomorrow Evening 
### 
IT is usually time enough to praise
a play when the final curtain has
been rung down and the audience has
gone home, but the Sword and Sandals'
production of "The First Born" which
will be presented tomorrow night, is
one that demands advance recognition.
Tonight's dress rehearsal will open the
eyes of the campus to something differ
ent in the line of local dramatic achieve
ment.
Gordon Davis, '18, coach of the pro-

duction, has been able to lend his en
tire sympathy to this production, since
at one time he took one of the leading
parts in a professional presentation of
the show.


Louis McDermott, '20, Margaret Shedd,
'20, and Mary Largent, '20, in the
female home-breaking scene that
features "IN 1999," the farce comedy
preceding "THE FIRST BORN," to
morrow night.
With all the intricacies of plot and
the difficulties of setting and costum
ing, a green coach would have had a
stiff proposition to face. Through his
past experience however, Davis is meet
ing all these problems of staging easily.
For instance, the scene immediately
following the impressive prologue is
one that most stage managers would he
loath to tackle, although Davis has been
able to put it over very successfully in
rehearsals. Crowded into a few mo
ments, a realistic street scene in China
town has to be presented. The stage is
crowded with all types of the yellow
man, each hurrying about on his re
spective business. A subdued babel of
Chinese voices is kept up, and a street
fortune teller plies his trade. It is a
crowded, bustling moment, where a
missed one spells confusion, but Davis
has trained his cast into running it off
perfectly.
Tomorrow night's bill is offered on
the principle of "something for every
one." Those who go to the theatre to
laugh will be offered plenty of induce
ment by the curtain-raiser, "In 1999."
On the other hand. "The First Born,"
is a realistic, dramatic portrayal of life's
seamy side.
