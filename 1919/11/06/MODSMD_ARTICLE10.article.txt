# Cardinal to Offer Article on Japan
## 'Liberalism in Japan' by Prof. Treat to be Featured in First Issue 
### 
An article by Professor Payson J.
Treat, entitled "Liberalism in Japan,"
will feature the first issue of the Stan
ford Cardinal, the new literary and
art magazine of the University. Pro
fessor Treat discusses, from a popular
viewpoint, the future of Japan and
her relations in the Far East and in
Shantung.
Japan, according to Professor Treat,
is in the throes of a change of po
litical ideas. Her militarism, the
former rotk of Japan's policy, was
modeled after the German militarism
and with the failure of the German
military system, Japan's faith in this
form of power and prestige has been
shaken. Professor Treat analyzes this
condition, particularly in the relation
ol" the rise of the liberal party in
Japan. He discusses the manner in
which this will effect the present
Shantung settlement, and American-
Japanese relations.
The November issue of the Cardinal
will contain articles of equal interest
besides the usual short stories. Mr.
Pedro J. Lemos has accepted the po
sition of Art Director of the Cardinal
and the magazine is artistically ar
ranged and illustrated.
