# VARSITY WILL MEET SANTA CLARA WITH A STRONG LINE-UP
## TEAMS CLASH SATURDAY Varsity-Freshman Scrimmage Last Night Showed Men In Prime Condition 
### 
Varsity and freshmen clashed
last night for a short period in order
to give both coaches an opportunity to
pick their line-ups for Saturday's games.
The Varsity worked in excellent form,
and from present indications the Cardi
nal eleven will maintain its winning
streak by defeating the strong Santa
Clara team on Saturday. Coach Bob
Harmon has developed a hard fighting
team at the Mission institution, and ac
cording to reports from previous games
that Santa Clara has played, Harmon has
taught his men to line-up quickly after
each play in an attempt jto catch the
opposition off guard.
Captain Ferrario of the Saints states
that his men are in prime shape for their
"big game." On Friday night the eleven
will be the guests of the institution at a
big rally, and on Saturday morning a big
delegation will accompany the team to
Stanford. A Santa Clara band will ac
company the rooters and will attempt
to overwhelm the Cardinal band in a
noise-making competition.
