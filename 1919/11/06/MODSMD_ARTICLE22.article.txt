# MAKE IT A BIG GAME
## 
### 
jiTEXT SATURDAY, the Stanford team will play one of the big games of the
season. The University of Santa Clara and Stanford have been athletic
rivals for years, and the "Big Game" was staged with these two universities
as opponents for three years. Now that Stanford and the University of Cali
fornia have resumed football relations, Stanford students are apt to forget
that we ever had a Big Game with Santa Clara, and look upon this con
test as an early season tryout. This is a wrong attitude, and is not healthy
for future athletic relations with the Mission Town team. The Santa Clara
students still regard the Stanford contest as their "Big Game." It is the
feature event of their athletic season, and some eight hundred Santa Clara
rooters, augmented by a band, and a section of alumni, will support their
eleven on Saturday. Stanford students will have to wake up to the fact
that even though we meet the Blue and Gold in two weeks, the Santa Clara
battle is also a Big Game, and a defeat will mean the loss of considerable
prestige for the varsity eleven. The rooters can do much towards winning
this game. With a strong rooting section behind it, and the spirit of at last
fifteen hundred fans, the Santa Clara aggregation will have a big advantage
if Stanford is not out in force, and pulling for a victory with the same en
thusiasm that Stanford supporters showed when Santa Clara was out strong
est rival.
