# Stanford Orchestra Will Play For 'The First Born'
## 
### 
The orchestra for"The First Born"
was chosen from the members of the
Stanford Orchestra. It was impossible
to use all the members of the orchestra.
The orchestra's first meeting showed
that most of the members have been
playing in orchestras before. Mr. W. D.
Allen, in charge, believes that the or
chestra will need only a few rehearsals
before its initial appearance.
Membership in the orchestra is still
open. Meetings will be held every Tues
day evening at 7:30 p.m.
