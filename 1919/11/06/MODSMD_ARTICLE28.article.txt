"If to her share some female errors
fall,
Look on her face, and you'll forget
'em all."

These women can talk all they want
about independence, rights, intellectu
al ascendency. In the end, most of
them are glad to be known as the wife
of Mr. .

"The woman thou gavest me" is
used with harsh emphasis sometimes.
Proceed with great care in making
dates for a friend.

The latest fashions for women were
recently announced to the anxiously
waiting nation (of women) by the
style-setters at a New York round
table. It is stated that Parisian co
quettes will soon look like "pikers."

Which makes us wonder if "the
500" will soon be striking for higher
skirts.

D. P. A. headline says "Yell leader
wants songs cut out and learned."
All right, we'll cut out the songsâ€”if
we can have our W. and W.

Broke, broke, broke;
In the shade of the Quad, oh Dad!
Please hurry along some more shekels,
"The 500" got what I had.

We take it all back, girls. We had
to pick on somebody.

This has been a marvelous day.
Only five minutes squandered talking
to co-eds.
