over the prospects of a victory. The
entire freshman squad will take the trip.

the freshmen out for the different posi
tions on the team, and the coach is
having considerable trouble choosing be

stitutes in this game, which may de
crease the Cardinal's chances for a big
score. This will give Acker a line on
additional men that he might be able to
use in the California game, which is
only two weeks away.
