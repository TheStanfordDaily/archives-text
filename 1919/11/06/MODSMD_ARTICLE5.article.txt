### 
In order to facilitate the finding of
partners at the Military Ball Saturday,
large placards, bearng the insignia of
the various branches of the army have
been made and will be posted in con
spicuous places about the gym. In mak

that partners plan to meet under a cer

this will tend to relieve the congestion.
The program will consist of sixteen
dances, including a grand march, which
will begin promptly at 8:30, in order
to allow plenty of time for each dance.
