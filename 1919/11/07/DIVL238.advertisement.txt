We are spending about $10,000 putting in a new front and re
modeling our store so that when finished, which will be about De
cember Ist, you will have as fine a store as you can find in the
country to shop in.
During these alterations there is no interruption in business, but
perhaps a little inconvenience, but be patient and you will be re
paid in the end with a beautiful store to make your headquarters.
New merchandise arriving every day so that your wants can be
readily taken care of.
