# "THE FIRST BORN" CAST FACES SPOTLIGHT TONIGHT
## COMEDY AND TRAGEDY BOTH ON BOARDS Sword and Sandals Will Give the Customary Full Value 
### 
II7HEN the curtain goes up tonight
on the Sword and Sandals show,
campus theatre-goers will be treated
to a tragedy of the highest order as
well as one of the cleverest of modern
satires. With the bill of "The First
Born" and the courtain-raiser of "In
1999," both the tragic and the comic
muse will be represented on the As
sembly Hall stage tonight at 8:15.
Too much cannot be said of the plot,
the intrigue, and life, that Edwin
Powers, the author of "The First
Born," has breathed into his play. To
the final curtain, the action pulsates
with mystery, suspense, and a gripp
ing element of revenge. Chinese char
acters, and passions, and the yellow
man's fierce pride in the honor of his
family, from the elements which
Powers has woven his drama.
As all plays of atmosphere of neces
sity are the cast of "The First Born"
is filled with many minor characters
of individual interest. None of these
are types; rather they seem to be
individual creations by Powers. Two
illustrations of Powers' style in the
connection are his characters of Dr.
Pow Len, played by H. H. Darling,
'21, and Hop Kee, played by D. S. At
wood, '23.
Dr. Pow Len represents the learned
Chinese who pompously quotes Confu
cius in the most critical situations.
Hop Lee is the street vendor who sees
everything that passes in the play but
tells nothing. Love for his tong is the
only thing that can stir this old China
man into action.
As far as indications of last night's
dress rehearsal, the acting of Miss
Ruth Elsinger, '20, will be one of the
sensations of tonight's production.
Her part is a tragic one, that of Chan
Lee, who is separated from her hus
band and child through the machina
tions of the villain of the piece, Man
Low Yek. Miss Elsinger's realism in

the emotional situations that she has
to face is far out of the ordinary in
the realm of amateur theatricals.
Although the seat sale has been far
beyond the expectations of the Sword
and Sandal's management, they report
that many good seats remain for the
box office sales tonight at the gate.
Following the performance, Hammer
and Coffin Society will give a one
o'clock dance in the Women's Club
House.
