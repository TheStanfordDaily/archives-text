# FRESHMEN WILL PLAY C. OF P. TOMORROW
## Coach Acker Will Use Game To Get Better Line on Substitutes 
### 
Coach Acker will play all of his men
in the Stanford freshman-College of
Pacific game, which is to be played at
San Jose tomorrow afternoon at 2:30
o'clock. Acker is planning on using this
last game before meeting the bruin
Freshmen as a means of getting a final
line on all his squad, including bis sub
stitutes.
The San Jose team was defeated
earlier in the season by the California
first-year team by a score of 79 to 0.
The game would probably be a walk
away for the Cardinal freshmen, if the
coach were to keep his strongest lineup
on the field.
Sttanford's backficld has been strong
since the first of the season, with such
men as Captain Creglow, Trago, Reed,
Cravens, and Douglas. During the past
week most of the practice periods have
been spent on the line. Tbe line is
now forming itself into a machine that
should be able to hold tthe Berkeley
men on November 15.
