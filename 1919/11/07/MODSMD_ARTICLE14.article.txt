# FAST TEAMS WILL MEET IN STANFORD-S.C. BIG GAME
## Missionites Seek to Avenge Their Defeat of 1917 
### 
CINCE the Santa Clara game tomor
row is the last game for the varsity
before the California contest cn Novem
ber 22, and since it is the "big game"
of the season for the Missionites, both
teams will go on to the field with their
strongest linenps and with the determi
nation to win. From a spectator's view
point, the battle will be almost as good
as the Stanford-California game.
Evans is sending his team on the field
handicapped by a shortage of backfield
men, although the players who will start
the game are rated as good as those
who are on the injured list. Captain
Caughey is good for his yards through
the Mission line at any time, and Pat
rick, Carroll, and Holt are capable of
carrying the hall for substantial gains.
Templeton will probably be at fullback
to give the visitors a few long punts.
Shlaudeman, Adams, Butt, Levy,
Flowers, Righter, Pershing, and Pelouze
will probably work in the line, although
Evans is uncertain as to the men he
will start.
Down at Santa Clara enthusiasm is
waxing high over the game, and Coach
Bob Harmon states that he is confi
who are not only well-known mem
bers of the student body, but who have
had practical experience in positions
of importance in recent campaigns in
this and other states.
This preliminary organization will
be rounded into permanent form at a
meeting to be held in the Woman's
Clubhouse at 7:30 p.m. on Thursday,
November 13th, and all men and wo
men of Republican sympathies are in
vited to attend.
It is claimed that a careful survey
of the political situation on the campus
discloses the fact that there are be
tween eight hundred and a thousand
men and women who will join the
Republican Club within the near

future, and the various committees on
enrollment will soon be actively en
gaged in campaigning for even a big
ger membership.
