# ROUGHING PRIVILEGE IN DANGER
## 
### 
nOUGHING at dances is one of the oldest traditions at Stanford, a tradition
that has afforded pleasure for hundreds of Stanford men, and a tradition
that we will regret to see abolished. The privilege of the men who are not
attending a dance to watch the social event from the outside, has been
treasured with pride by the men here, and for years it was done without
objections. Our men then acted in a more gentlemanly manner, they had
respect for other people's property, and the conduct of a hoodlum was not
the looked-up-to style of behavior for the onlookers. During the spring quar
ter several acts of vandalism were committed by the Stanford roughs, but
when the student authorities appealed to them to put a stop to the thievery,
there was a temporary let-up. However, reports from the last few campus
dances prove that the present-day roughs have not the slightest conception
of Kow to properly conduct themselves. We do not want to see the roughing
custom abolished. It is a good tradition, one of the habits that lends a
distinctly democratic tone to Stanford, and one that gives pleasure to a
great many. We hate to see the majority of the roughs who behave them
selves suffer for acts of the minority, but just as surely as the refreshments
continue to be stolen, just as surely as windows are broken and screens cut
open so that outsiders can gain access to the kitchens, just as surely as the
roughs continue to use improper language that can easily be heard by those
attending the dances, so surely will raoughing traditions pass by the boards,
as so many others have recently done. If the students believe as we do that
it is a good thing to allow roughing at dances when it is done correctly,
they will bring pressure to bear on the unduly rough roughs, and bring the
custom back to a decent standard so that it is not universally condemned.
