# LAW MAJORS HOLD SMOKER IN UNION
## 
### 
Eats, smokes, music, speeches, box
ing, and an informal good time and
get-together was provided last night
at the Union, for members of the
Stanford Law Association in their first
big smoker since 1917.
Dean Huston delivered the address
of welcome, in which he spoke ap
preciatively of the return to the old
tone and spirit of the Law Associa
tion. He compared the registration
in the department during the war, at
which time it was but 30, to the pres
ent enrollment of 215.
