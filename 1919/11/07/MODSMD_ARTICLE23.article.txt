"Caramba"! shouts the Golden Bear,
"(his STANFORD PEP is going to
knock us google-eyed." "Listen, they
had a RALLY on the Farm the other
night. Maavelous! I heard fiat
seven or eight of the STANFORD
RED actually stepped out of their
caves to take part. Maagniflcent! The
whispers or "tu h â€” with the Gold and
Blue" were APPLAUDED hy an audi
ence of THOUSANDS (?) reclining
comfortably on porch chairs and actu
ally exerting a SMILE of APPROVAL.
Too dear for an'thing! Rah, Rah,
Percy, you'll make fine bar-food. I'm
through hibernating and good and
hungry. STANFORD PEP? OH,
AGNES!"
