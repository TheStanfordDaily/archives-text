### 
Touchdown
A Touchdown is made when the ball,
lawfully in possession of a player, is de
clared dead by the referee, any part of it
being on, above, or behind the opponents'
goal line.
The Touchdown is marked at the point
not where the ball is carried across the
line, but where the ball is declared dead
by the referee. If the ball is carried
across the extension of the side line, the
touchdown is marked at the intersection
of the side line and the goal line.
If a foul is committed by a player be
hind his own goal line when the ball is in
possession of neither side and it de
prives an opponent of an opportunity to
recover the ball, and the enforcement of
the penalty would give possession of the
ball to the offended side behind the op
ponents' goal line, it shall count a touch
down for the offended side. If, however,
the ball is in the air as from a kick
when the foul is committed, it shall count
as a safety against the team which com
mitted the offense.
Touchback
A touchback is made when the ball in
possession of a player guarding his own
goal is declared dead by the referee,
any part of it being on, above, or behind
the goal line, provided the impetus which
sent it to or across the line was given by
an opponent.
It is a touchback when a kicked ball
(other than one from kick-off, free
kick, or one scoring a goal from the
field) goes over the goal line before
being touched by a player of either side.
If any kicked ball strikes the goal posts
or cross-bar before being touched by a
player of either side, unless it scores a
goal, it shall be considered a touchback.
It is a touchback when a player who
is off-side and within the opponent's 10-
yard line is touched by a ball kicked by
one of his own side. This penalty may
be declined.
It is a touchback when a forward pass
crosses either the end line or side line
extended; when it strikes the goal posts
or cross-bar, or when it touches the
ground within the end zone.
It is a touchback if any interference
with the interception of a forward pass
is committed behind the opponents' goal
line by the side which put the ball in
play.
It is a touchback when a player on de
fense permits a ball, kicked by an oppo
nent, to strike his person and then roll
across his goal line and lie or any player
of bis side then falls on it back of the
line.
Not a touchback
It is not a touchback if such player
juggles the ball so that he in any way
forces it over the line and he or any
player of his side then falls on it.
It may be a touchback if the forward
pass be touched by an ineligible man be
tween the opponents' 10-yard line and
the end line.
