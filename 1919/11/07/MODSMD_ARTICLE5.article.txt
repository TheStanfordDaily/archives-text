# "Anzacs" Arrive Tonight Ready for Rugby Clash
## 
### 
For the first time since the celebrated
Australian All Blacks, touring America,
came to the university for a rugby
contest in 1913, bringing with them
"Jim" Wylie, the present Stanford
coach, and "Danny" Carroll, another
prominent athlete, the Stanford rugby
players will clash tomorrow afternoon
with a team boasting international fame.
The "Anzac" fifteen, which comes to
the campus tonight, to be entertained at
the fraternity houses until 1:30 tomor
row afternoon, the time set for the
game, has perhaps the most unusual his
tory of any rugby team playing in
America. Every member of the squad
is an Australian officer, still in the serv
ice, stationed at the Davis State Farm
School, while recovering from wounds
received in the war. Several of the
players wear four wound-chevrons, and
all of them were in the actual fighting
for more than two years. After taking
part in tthe British offensive in the
Dardanelles, they were transferred to
the Western Front, where they fought
in the most bloody battles of the war.
Throughout the struggle, these Aus
tralian rugby enthusiasts kept up their
team and its matches. They often played
within sound of the guns, and even
when barely recovered from their
wounds. Trainer Maloney, on his re
cent visit to Davis Farm, asked the
captain of the team whether his men
did not find themselves out of practice.
The officer replied:
"Quite absurd, my dear sir! We have
played rugby all our lives, from Gallipoli
to Paris, and half way to Berlin. We
are ready to play at a minute's notice."
Arrangements are being made here to
entertain these veterans in such a way
that they will have cause to remember
the hospitality of Stanford. The Car
dinal Anzac game will be called sharply
at one-thirty, in order that the students
who wish to witness the Santa Clara
game at three will have plenty of time
to see the Australians in action as well.
Coach Wylie stated today that his
lineup will not be announced until kick
off. Stanford will try for a victory in
this international contest, since a win
over the Anzacs will send the Cardinal
team into the California battle with the
edge on the Blue and Gold fifteen.
