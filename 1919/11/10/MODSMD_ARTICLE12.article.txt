# CARDINAL SOCCER TEAM IS ELIGIBLE FOR LEAGUE FINALS
## 
### 
The Stanford varsity Soccer team
finished the preliminary season with
a record of four victories and no de
feats by beating the University of
Mount Eagle eleven 4 to 0, Saturday
afternoon, on the Croll field in Ala
meda. The Stanford goals were made
by Gardner, Captain Pillsbury, Green,
and Newland.
The game with Mount Eagle is the
last before the big match with Cali
fornia which will take place on No
vember 22, as a curtain-raiser to the
football game, and will decide the
championship of the University and

varsity will be greatly weakened by
ineligibility, and Coach Maloney will
have to try a new combination before
the California series.
The line-up of the varsity follows:
Green, or; Captain Pillsbury, ir; New
land, cf; Straus, il; Gardner, ol;
Skene, rhb; Stamp, chb; Crough, lhb;
Myers, rb; W. Adams, lb; Hood, goal.
