# STRAIGHT FOOTBALL WINS GAME FROM SANTA CLARA
## CARD. BACKS WORK WELL Stanford Uses No Open Field Work — The Score Is 13—0 
### 
football without an at
tempt at open field work counted 13
ooints for the Stanford Varsity and
defeated the Santa Clara eleven 13 to 0
Saturday. "Pret" Holt and Captain
Caughey were the men to score the
touchdowns, Holt's score taking place in
the second quarter and Caughey's in the
fourth quarter. Patrick converted
Caughey's score.
Coach Evans used nine backs in the
game. "Ken" Lilly and Paul Campbell
were the two men who have been out
with injuries and who were putin the
game for a few minutes in the last quar
ter. Both demonstrated that they will be
ready for the "Big Game."
After the first quarter, Coach Harmon
of the Mission team saw that he could
not make much headway through the
Stanford line, so he switched to open
field work. Eleven attempts at forward
passes were made, one of which succeed
ed. Seven were failures and three were
intercepted by Stanford players.
Evans has no kick coming on the per
formance of any of his backs. Captain
Caughey was good for repeated gains
through the line, and in the fourth quar
ter he plunged through for a touchdown
after Patrick, substituting for Temple
ton, ran 45 yards from the middle of the
field. Holt bothered the Mission boys
considerably with his abilty to find holes
and make his yards. Holt registered the
first touchdown in the second quarter.
Danny Carroll put the Cardinal eleven
in a position to score by making a 20-
yard run around left end, and after sev
eral short gains by Holt and Carroll the
pigskin was shoved across the line. Tem
pleton failed to make an easy goal.
Lilly got into the battle a few minutes
before the end of the game for the first
time this season and showed that he still
has his old speed. Paul Campbell offi
ciated at half back for a while in the last
period, although technically out of the
game with an injured wrist.
The Varsity was minus the services of
"Swede" Righter at center, and Jarvis
and Pallet covered the position. Pallet
held up the job in good shape aside from
a bad pass he made to Templeton on the
Stanford 10-yard line, which "Dink"
managed to recover and run back for a
few yards. "Cap" Campbell played an
aggressive game in the line until he was
forced to retire, and "Here" Bihlman
and "Fat" Flowers, the two heavy
weights, proved stumbling blocks for
the Mission backs. Bihlman provided a
couple of sensations when he nailed the
Santa Clara quarterback twice after
Templeton had kicked, beating both of
the ends down.
In the second quarter, after Santa
Clara had opene'dup the game, Mission
ites put the Stanford line in danger with
Needles. Baker, and Scholz carrying the
ball. This trio played a steady game
throughout. Baker made the longest
Santa Clara gain when he reeled off 20
yards around left end.
The five Stanford backs piled up a
total of 285 yards against 177 made by
Santa Clara. The summary shows that
16 first downs were made by Stanford,
while Santa Clara registered 9. The
Catholic team fumb'ed fwice and Stan
ford once.
