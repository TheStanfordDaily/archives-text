# NOT BECAUSE OF THE ROWDIES

ANE of the unpleasant spectacles that we are sometimes forced to witness took
place on the campus today. Whether it was a result of simple over-enthusiasm
displayed by boys, or whether it was a purely malicious attempt to place the Stan
ford authorities in a bad light is hard to determine, but we sincerely hope that it
was the former. Tomorrow is Armistice Day and should be fittingly observed.
Every American is proud of the part that we as a nation played in winning the
great war, and we at Stanford are especially proud of Stanford's part. We want
to celebrate the great Armistice Day and believe that a holiday is the best recogni
tion. However, the methods taken by a number of our students today almost made
the granting of such a holiday an impossibility. As a matter of fact, until several
students brough the question before the Faculty Committee on Public Exercises this
afternoon it had not been considered. Professor Tatlock, Chairman of this com
mittee, said that the students' desire for a holiday tomorrow had never been brought
before the committee, which seldom acts on such questions unless requested to do
so, but even though it was now late, the matter immediately would be referred to
Professor C. D. Marx, Acting President of the University. This was done, and
consequently the holiday was granted. However, Professor Marx has granted the
holiday on the express condition that the Stanford men who have been in the
service, and other Stanford men and women, give all the help possible in the pro
gram at the Community House at Palo Alto. A holiday is not granted simply
to allow students a rest in their scholastic endeavors; the day has been declared
a holiday so that wÂ£ can firttingly observe a day that should mean a great deal to
every American, and it is our duty to comply with the request that wle do our
utmost to make the program in Palo Alto a success.
Now to the Rowdies: Is it not a shame that men when they arrive at the Uni
versity age, cannot be real men; that they cannot do things as men do them and
not as high school boys? If the students who led the demonstration this noon had
done the right thing the only sensible thing, they would have immediately gone to
the President's office, where they would have secured the same results that the
students did who brought the matter to the attention of the committee in charge
and the Acting President this afternoon. A holiday would have been granted for
the same reason that it is being granted now, not because of a demonstration of a
group of students led by a few enthusiastic but unwise and unthinking men who
want to lead in a movement both petty and contemptible. We ask that when the
students want something that they go to the proper source before taking action,
if they do take any action, that it be characterized as the conduct of gentlemen and
if they do take any action, that is be characterized as the conduct of gentlemen and
not that of hoodlums. The placards now on the campus are a disgrace to our
student body and to the institution we represent. If Stanford men cannot think
along clearer and more logical lines than these placards would seem to show, it is
high time that our educational system receive a shakeup, for the men are moving
backward and not forward.
