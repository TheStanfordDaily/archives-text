## Committee to Meet All Who Desire to Take Part Tomorrow 
### 
Plans for the football show to be
given by the student body the even
ing of November 22, are rapidly being
rounded into shape. L. L. Pickering,
'20, has been selected to coach the
production, with J. C. Schnier, '20, as
assistant. Both men have had experi
ence in local dramatics and are mem
bers of Rams Head Society, which is
in charge of the show.
The production will be in the nature
of a high-class vaudeville, containing
six or seven acts by the best Stan
ford talent that can be procured for
the occasion. There are a number of
men on the campus this quarter who
have had experience on the profes
sional stage, and it is the plan of the
producers to show as many of these
semi-professional acts as possible. In
order that the coaches may have more
material to draw from, tryouts have
been scheduled for tomorrow after
noon, instead of today, at the assembly
hall stage. They urge all who have
dramatic talent or who wish to par
ticipate in the show to meet them
Tuesday, between 3 and 5:30 p.m.
A dance has been scheduled to fol
low the show, making a solid day of
entertainment for visiting alumni and
students.
