# SWORD AND SANDALS PLAY WINS APPLAUSE
## SCENIC EFFECTS GOOD Skit "In 1999" Is Clever', Laughable Comedy Of Future 
### 
(JETTING and costuming reached their
high-water marks of completeness
and beauty in the Sword and Sandals'
presentation of "The First Born" last
Friday night. Presenting the witchery
and charm of the old San Francisco
Chinatown with the closest attention to
detail, Coach Gordon Davis, '18, and his
staff achieved the apotheosis of artistic
realism in producing Francis Power's
play.
The return to the serious drama in
campus theatricals was made by the
Sword and Sandals Society in this play.
It was an experiment as to whether or
not a Stanford audience would accept
such a diversion from the usual run of
farce and musical cr medy that has held
the local boards for over three years.
And ail the credit for the sucecss of
the experiment last Friday night must
go to the coach, the society, and, above
all, the cast.
It would be a little too extravagant to
say that the Sword and Sandals bill last
Friday was everything that could be
asked for, but at least it was far beyond
anything that the campus theatre-goers
had hoped for. Possibly the play of
"The First Born" itself was not as
"classic" as was claimed for it on the
program. Again the acting might have
lacked a final polish or some other de
tail been out of adjustment, but taking
the entire effect into consideration,
Sword and Sandals have set a standard
for this year's dramatics that future
productions will have to work hard to
live up to.
It might have been that Whittier
Wellman's impressive prologue misled
the audience into expecting more than it
got in"The First Born." After all,
despite several powerful scenes, the plot
seemed loose and at times incoherent.
This superficiality and incompleteness is
attested by the audience's failing to real
ize when the final curtain had dropped.
Something was undoubtedly missing, the
"big punch" that the audience was wait
ing for failed to putin its appearance.
Aside from these alleged deficiencies
in the plot there is no denying that the
play was admirably fitted for amateur
production. Many different charac
ters allowing for individual work by
each member of the cast marked "The
First Born." James Quinby, '18, who
had the leading role of Chan Wang rose
to the tense, dramatic situations that his
lines demanded with an irresistible force,
softened only by an underlying tender
ness. Some indifference at other times
took away somewhat from the vigor of
his greater moments.
Opposite him, Miss Teresa Hihn, '19,
played the part of Loey Tsing with an
appealing charm. Miss Hihn occupied a
ire position among actresses as one who
can exhibit a deep sorrow quietly with
out the conventional "boo-hoo." Miss
Ruth Elsinger, '20, Chan Wang's wife,
in her few furtive and fleeting moments
on the stage was entirely satisfactory.
But of the entire cast, the best work
of the evening was done by Stoddard At
wood, '22, in the minor role of the pipe
mender. The sonorous tones of his
voice and the fullness of his expression
conveyed more of the impression of the
situation to the audience than did most
of the action. H. H. Darling, '21, had a
delicious bit in the part of Dr. Pow
Len, a sort of academic "Pooh Bah."
Darling had a complete grasp of the
character, and his air of pomposity was
inimitable. The other charactcrs in"The
First Born" rather served as a "pano
rama effect and had too few lines for in
dividual distinction.
The curtain raiser, "In 1999," was
based on a clever idea carried out in too
much of a mechanical, open-and-shut
manner. Shakespeare could have had
Desdemona smother Othello and receive
the same effect. The acting, however,
was almost faultless and fell exactly in
with the spirit of nonsense that perme
ated the piece. L. W. McDermott, '17,
as Rollo, played opposite Miss Margaret
Shedd, '20, who had the rare part of a
"hcnpecked"( ?) wife. Miss Mary Lar
gent, '20, was named in the cast of char
acters as the co-respondent.
