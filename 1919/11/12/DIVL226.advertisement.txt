Foremost for Style
Society Brand Clothes, because of their
very high quality, naturally represent the vogue. The fine
tailoring permits an expression of style that is lasting.
Though copied in design by others, the inner construction
is evident by comparative appearance when new, and
doubly so after wearing.
Fabrics are all-wool and many of exclusive patterns.
With the varied, grades of clothing flooding the market, look for thin label as your guide. Goto Style Headquarter*.
