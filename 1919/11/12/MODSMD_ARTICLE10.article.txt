# ACKER LIGHTENS WORK FOR FRESHMAN ELEVEN
## Trago and Creglow Recover From Injuriesâ€”Are Back In Game 
### 
Coach Acker will give the freshman
squad light workouts during the re
maining practices this week, before
their game with the California babes,
which is to be played on the Cali
fornia field, at 2:30 o'clock, next Sat
urday afternoon.
At present two of the first-string
men are out of the game with minor
injuries, but it is thought by Acker
that they will be rounded into condi
tion by Saturday. However, the coach
has maintained a large number of
substitutes on the squad, in order to
be prepared for any last-minute dif
ficulties.
Captain Creglow and quarterback
Trago are again in condition to get
back on the field. Their loss has been
felt in the backfield, during the last
two games.
