# WOMEN AND THE LAW STEPS
## 
### 
AMONG the many traditions at Stanford is one that the women shall not
walk up and down nor sit on the law steps. There is no particular reason
why the women should not have the use of these steps just as they have of
the others, but it has long been a tradition that the law men need not be
bothered between classes in this manner; that they shall be able to use the
law steps without being forced to tip their hats every minute, and that when
coming up and down these steps, they will not have to worry for fear of
stepping on some fair co-eds perched there for a between-classes-chat. This
old custom has apparently gone by the boards this quarter, for not only do
the women go up and down the law steps at will, but occasionally they use
them as a convenient place to sit down and talk over affairs of the campus
with their friends. Of course, the reasons for htis are simple. There
are many women here who know nothing about Stanford traditions, and the
new library is an incentive for them to leave the Quad by these steps. While
it may not be aB convenient to use the other steps, and to many of the 500
it may seem unreasonable to ask them to change their habitual routine merely
because it violates a Stanford tradition, to us it is vital in that it is just
one of the instances in which an old custom is being abolished. One of the
reasons we are so fond of Stanford is for its traditions, and we want to pre
serve all of the good ones. At least there is no harm in the tradition that
makes the law steps a sacred spot for the congregation of the upperclass men,
and a place to be avoided by the college women. Because we do not want
to see ourselves changing Stanford, wo request that the women take heed
and find another way to the library and another place to rest en route.
