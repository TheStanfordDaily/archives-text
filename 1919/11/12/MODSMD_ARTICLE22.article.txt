### 
On account of Professor Yone No
guchi being unable to arrive at the Uni
versity this afternoon, the assembly
scheduled for 2:15 was postponed until
November 19. Mr. Noguchi will address
the University students in the Assem
bly Hall at that time on "Japan Today."
The lecture is anticipated as one of the
finest of the year by the committee in
charge. The speaker is well known as a
poet, and his viewpoint on conditions in
Japan and the part that that nation is
to play in the future diplomacy of the
world will be particularly interesting.
Universities and cities in the entire
country have been hearing Professor No
guchi, and everywhere he has been en
thusiastically received. Mr. Noguchi is
a professor at Kaio University at Tokyo.
