Editor Daily Palo Alto,
Stanford University, Cal.
Dear Sir:
We Stanford men of former days un
derstand there is nothing abnormally
rotten about Stanford life of today, but
why these painful "smarty" efforts to
convince the general public that there
is? Stanford has stood for certain
definite qualities in the past, but the
qualities of a "Peeping Tom" are not
among them. As a newspaperman, I
know how gleefully the editors will hop
onto a story carrying that fine odor of
"immorality" so pleasing to the Puritan
proboscis, but I cannot see why any
student should spend $5 to assist the
process. Yes, there were wall-poets in
my day, but their efforts stayed where
they belonged and did not get into print.
Berkeley doubtless enjoys her monopoly
of that sort of advertising. A joke is a
joke, and a 12-foot fence is foolish, but
why hurt Stanford? Leave that to the
trustees.
Yours truly,
Ernest J. Hopkins,
