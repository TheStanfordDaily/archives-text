To the Editor:
I did not see, but I heard of, the pos
ters displayed about the campus Mon
dayâ€”posters suggesting that the Presi
dent and the Dean of Men had been
somewhat behind in their duty during the
time of war.
My first reaction is not that of a fac
ulty member, offended by the gross im
propriety of the posters (though indeed
it is a humiliating thing to think that
Stanford men can so far forget their ob
ligations as gentlemen and members of
our University family), but as one
whose good luck it was to serve "over
there" I felt a quicK indignation that
anv slur should be cast on those whose
persistent, self-effacing work at home
was the very condition that made our
own work possible. Ours was the easy
part to serve where every one most
wanted to serve, where the sense of serv
ice was keenest; their's the hard part, to
work patiently and tirelessly in the home
places, to see group nfter group leave
for the vivid life at the front, yet al
ways to stay on working in the fa
miliar conditions of every day.
The injustice of it! That is what I
have a right to protest against. Let us
clear our minds of the degrading busi
ness. Nothing but a full, manly apology
can restore the wholesome air we like
to breathe. Meantime, what better oc
casion to speak our appreciation of those
who backed us constantly in helpful un
selfishness of spirit?
