To the Editor:
Now, just a word, my dear Dippy,
anent your scathing arraignment of
rowdyism in Monday's issue. Of course
that pcerade on Monday noon was not
a highly decorous nor dignified affair,
and a few of the placards carried were
a bit extreme, if taken logically, even
for the hectic taste of some of the—er—
rowdys—who took part. But who, in
the nnme of common sense, takes them
logically, unless it be your own serious
minded self-
And as for the spirit which prompted
the celebration, I think you'll agree that
it was ninety-nine per cent effervescence
of youth and a desire to get a kick out
of something. In the ancient days which
you and ! remember, the aforesaid kick
might have been obtained by public ini
tiations or by disciplining of the now
sacred freshman, or even by the totally
reprehensible practice <if invading .a rival
campus. But now these things are ta
boo, along with the Haig Brothers and
the twenty-dollar tuition fee, and other
things which made life one grand, sweet
song. ••••••
So. for the sake of our traditionally
discolored reputation as an irrepressible
community, permit us to kick up_ our
heels once in a while. Collectively,
we're making this place over into a mere
institution fast enough—and individually
we're progressing at an alarming rate
toward responsibility, as typified by a
fortyinch waist-line and a small but
growing business. We're losing some
thing valuable when we lose our ability
to stage a rah-rah peerade on the slight
est provocation—even as our political
world lost something when the torch
light procession went out of fashion.
And please, dear Hippy, if y°u do find
room to print this, sign mv name to it.
