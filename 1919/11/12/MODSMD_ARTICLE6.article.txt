# MUSEUM OBTAINS VALUABLE TABLETS
## 
### 
A collection of Babylonian tablets was
purchased recently by the University
and will be put on display in the Muse
um. They will be on exhibition in the
"Recent Acquisition Case."
The tablets date about 2500 B. C. and
are of various shapes and sizes. In
scribed on them are the queer cuneiform
or wedge-shaped characters of the As
syrian inscriptions.
This interesting set of material has
been gathered together from Joka,
Drahm, and Warka, ancient cities of
Babylonia.
