# FRESHMAN ELEVEN WILL OUTWEIGH U.C. FIRST-YEAR TEAM
## LINE-UP NAMED FRIDAY Douglas is Heaviest Man on "Frosh" Team With Weight of 197 
### 
a team average of about 175
pounds, Coach Art Acker's freshman
eleven will not suffer in a comparison of
weight with the Bruin babes. Although
Acker will not announce his definite
line-up until tomorrow, a tentative line
up gives the above average.
In the backfield the average is 174
pounds, with Trago playing quarterback
and 180 with Reed calling signals.
The seven players working on the
line will average about 170 pounds. Hel
ser, with 184 pounds, is the heaviest line
man, and Downs and DeGroote each hit
180 pounds. "Red" Mac Alpine tips the
beam at 172, and the two ends, Sproull
and Osborn, weigh 159 and 172, respec
tively.
Douglass, right half, is the heaviest
man on the team, with 197 pounds to
his credit. With all of this beef, Doug
lass should pound the California line
to pieces unaided. Cravens is another
heavy man in the backfield with 181
pounds. Reed weighs 185. Creglow 160,
and Trago 150.
Nothing definite is known about the
California weight except that the team
as a whole looks heavy; but it is not
believed they will average over 175
pounds.
Coach "Nibs" Price of the California
freshmen has had a successful season
with his men, and he will undoubtedly
put an eleven on the Berkeley field Sat
urday that will make the odds about
even. Davis, full back, is the individual
star of the Bear cubs, and he will give
the Stanford defense considerable

trouble if he performs up to past exhi
bitions. Davis and Erb both kick goals.
Erb at quarter, Bell and Canfield as
halves, and Davis at full is the back
field combination that Price probably
will place on the field.
