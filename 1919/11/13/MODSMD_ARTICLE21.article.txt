# GET BEHIND YOUR TEAM
## 
### 
SATURDAY will be a great day for Stanford and California. The freshman
football teams will meet at Berkeley in the first inter-collegiate football
contest to be held between the first-year athletic representatives in a num
ber of years. The present college generation has never seen a Stanford-
California freshman football game, and interest is running high. This is
especially the case on the Stanford campus, for the early season's dope has
seemed to favor our own team. However, the freshman class is not behind
the team as it should be. It will not be enough to have a scattering of Stan
ford freshmen at the game next Saturday. The enthusiasm of these, even
though the number be fairly large, will not be sufficient. Although this
coming game is inter-collegiate in character, it is essentially a contest be
tween the freshmen classes of the two rival institutions. The whole spirit
of the Stanford freshmen should be with the team, and to obtain the neces
sary results, every freshman should be on hand to back the eleven when
it goes into its most important struggle. We would suggest a little organiza
to Berkeley and let the supporters of the Blue
d freshman team has the solid backing of its
as shown up well in this, its first quarter. Its
iany of our customs and ways, some of which
to them, with a willingness that recalls the
hmen because of a number of very pertinent
ders many of us doubted the possibility of a
lape, but the present freshmen .have prooved
leir opportunity to prove both their strength
y are neart and soul behind that freshman eleven as they
should be, every member of the class will be up and rooting for a victory,
but no matter what the stray enthusiasm is, it will take considerable or
ganizing to muster the real strength of the class, and we suggest that ma
chinery of this be immediately put into motion.
