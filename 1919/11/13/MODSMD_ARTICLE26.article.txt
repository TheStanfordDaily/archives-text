November 10, 1919.
Coach Evans of Stanford Team,
Stanford University, California. Dear
Sir: —I had business up Albany way
last week, and stopped with mine
host of the Hotel Albany, and he said
among other things, apropos of your
visit, "that he had been in the hotel
business all his life and had handled
a great many football teams, but he
had never handled one before where
every member of the team seemed to
be a perfect gentleman, thoroughly
alive and full of pep, but knew how
to conduct themselves properly at
all times," and I am passing this along
to you on the theory as some wise
man said; "If a man deserves praise,
bestow it, if you like him let him
know it,"after which I had no embar
rassment about telling him that one
of your number was my own son.
Hoping and trusting you and they
are as successful in all things and
especially their studies as they were
at Corvallis, I am,
Sincerely yours,
C. W. PALLETT.
