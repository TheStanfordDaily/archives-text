THE HOUSE OF COURTESY'
Just about a year ago the dress clothes most in favor were the
olive drab and blue.
But this year it's different. You'll find that now there's a call for
dress clothes right along. If it isn't a wedding, it's a dance or re
ception with all the old crowd together again.
We can fit you out in dress clothes at a moment's notice. They
are all ready for you â€”the latest styles in full dress suits made by
Hart Schaffner & Marx
Why not have your dress clothes before your next invitation comes?
