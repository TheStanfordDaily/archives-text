nearly put the teams on a par with
each other.
Coach "Art" Acker will not bring a
team on the field that is partly com
posed of stars, but will start the game
ith eleven men selected from hi?
squad of twenty-seven candidates, all
of whom are strong players. The
coach will take the entire squad to
California, and the relief-men on the
bench will be nearly as strong as the
men that start the game.
The Cardinal babes that will start
the game are: â€”Osborn, left end; De-
Groot, left tackle; Helser, left guard;
Faville, center; McAlpine right guard;
Pollard, right tackle; Sproull r. end;
Reed, quarter-back; Papazian, left
half; Cravens, right half, and Captain
Creglow, full back. The other men on
the squad are: Trago, Douglass, Holt,
Mohn, Clark, Warner, Long, Downs,
Johnson, Kraft, Landis, Rice, Austin,
Murray, Snedden and Wilson.
The California "frosh" will line-up
with a strong eleven and will be com
posed of several men who were
thought out of the game. The team
is: Clark, center; Schurr and Wiff
man, guards; Ahlswede and Dean,
tackles; Toney and Muller, ends; Erb,
quarter, Davis and VanSant, halves;
and Buck, full back.
All of the Bruin babes have had
previous experience in the American
game with high school teams, or on
different army teams. Muller was the
all-star southern end last year. Davis
was an all-star valley half back in
1917, and played football in the army
for over a year. It is rumored that
Blewett may be declared eligible for
the Berkeley team. He was one of
the best football players on the coast
in high school.
One of the surprises that Coach
Acker has sprung is the shift in the
backfield, where Papazian starts at
half back instead of Douglass. Crav
ens will start at right half instead of
left half.
