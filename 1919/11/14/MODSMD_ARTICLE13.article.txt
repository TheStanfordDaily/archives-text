## LEADING MAN A MYSTERY New Songs and Dances Will Feature "Follies" at Stanford 
### 
"Frivolous Follies' Revue," is the
name selected today for the stellar
attraction of the student football show,
November 22. Songs and dances by
a chorus of "co-eds" will be a feature
of the revue, the lighting effects for
which are now being arranged for in
the city by L. L. Pickering, *20, the
coach. An innovation is promised to
Stanford audiences in the way of a
mysterious leading man. The coach,
although admitting that he is a Stan
ford student and the find of the sea
son, refuses to divulge his name.
Another act which it is claimed will
excite a good deal of comment is one
which is being worked up by Eliza
beth Patten, '21, and R. W. Sewell,
'20, with a number of original songs
written especially for this occasion.
Sewell has written a number of popu
lar numbers and has turned down
ffers to appear In vaudeville in order
to complete his college education.
Ram's Head Society, which has
charge of the staging of the produc
tion for the Student Body, promises
five or six other feature acts in ad
dition. In order to make the day
complete with entertainment they will
exert every effort to keep the ma
jority of the students on the campus
after the Big Game with California.
