# OFF THE WORLD'S BOAT
## 
### 
<(AN the Boat." How often do we hear that expression here at college, and
how many times have we flushed with pride at the realization that our
knowledge of campus affairs is comprehensive, that we know every little in
and out of our local conditions? On the other hand, how many times have we
felt a sense of shame when some one has mentioned a recent event, a topic of
current interest, or discussed a well written book, and we have been forced to
admit that we know nothing of this? It is here that we are off the boat, "Off
the World's Boat," and at the same time being looked up to by many as people
who have attained intellectual success, as people whose knowledge is enviable.
We do not criticise the efforts to keep our college students well up in local
happenings, but is it not unfortunate that those outside of our universities can
say with a considerable degree of truth that the college men and women are
the poorest read, the least informed, and the most unattentive to the real issues
of the world, of any class of young Americans?
Why is it that our university students seldom read magazines? Why is it
that the newspapers are but glanced over, and seldom that ? Why is it that
our college people are so completely uninformed as regards the great issues
of the modern world? Is it not because of tthe fact that our present educational
system tends to isolate the universities. To be sure, a movement has gained
considerable headway which endeavors to make our college courses more prac
tical, which more closely connects university economics, for instance, to the
economic problems we will have to face. However, the present system is lacking
in that little effort is spent in encouraging a desire for general information.
Naturally, we do not expect courses to be given for the mere discussion of
current events clipped from the morning papers, but our university courses
should be linked up with modern events. If this is done, our students will
soon desire to get on the world's boat as well as the mere college boat.
