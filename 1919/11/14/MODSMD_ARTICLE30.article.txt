# Japanese Club Forms Discussion Group
## 
### 
The Japanese Club has arranged for
a weekly discussion group meeting of
all its members to talk over problems
similar to those of the Stanford Stan
dards groups for freshmen. Dr. F. E.
Morgan, religious director of the local
Y. M. C. A. will conduct the meetings,
which are to be held every Friday
evening. The group was formed under
the auspices of the "Y" and will be
continued for the autumn quarter
only.
