## 
### 
Perhaps the funniest of all predica
ments ever confronting any artist on
a tour was that of Rudolph Ganz, the
distinguished Swiss pianist, who will
be heard here next Wednesday even
ing, in his attempt to disconnect with
other celebrities of the same name.
While out west, playing a concert
with a Mr. Herman, a violinist, he was
astounded to read, "Jos. Ganz boxes
Willie Herman at the—Theatre." The
colored pugilist and the other fighter
were scheduled for a bout on the same
day as the Ganz-Herman concert, and
the newspaper had mixed the two
headquarters, announcing the concert
at the boxing club and the bout at the
theatre. Picture the amazement of the
two audiences. Matters were later
patched up, and the pianist called on
the fighter to pay his compliments.
