# STANFORD TO OCCUPY RESERVED BLEACHERS
## WILL TRY NEW YELLS Bleacher Rally Held Last Night Proved Big Success 
### 
All Stanford people attending the
freshman game tomorrow are to sit in
a separate rooting section. Arrange
ments were completed today, reserving
the west bleachers for Stanford rooters.
Yell Leader Martin announced this
morning that he and the two assistants
will be on hand to lead the yells and
songs. He especially requests that all
Stanford rooters sit in their own sec
tion and not scatter out over the entire
bleachers.
More than a thousand students at
tended the bleacher rally held on the
field last night. A new yell, known as
the "Ooo" yell, has been written for
this game. It is especially adapted to
American football.
