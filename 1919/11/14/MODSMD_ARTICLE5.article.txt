# LIEUTENANT KRUNICH SPEAKS ON SERBIA
## 
### 
Lieutenant Milutin Krunich, late of
the Sei bian Army, will make an ad
dress on "Serbia and Her People,"
next Tuesday evening at 7:30, in the
Little Theatre. The lecture will be
illustrated with slides.
Since he was in the famous retreat
through Albania, Lieutenant Krunich
has a very clear idea of not only
Serbia's part in the war, but also of
the character of the Serbian people
themselves.
Lieutenant Krunich is at present an
instructor in Slavic languages at the
University of California.
