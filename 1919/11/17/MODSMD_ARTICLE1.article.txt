QUTPLAYED, the Stanford freshmen
Saturday on the California field al
lowed the California babes to cross the
goal line for seven touchdowns. A
score of 47 to 0 was piled up against
the Cardinal eleven, which breaks the
high score record for intercollegiate
freshmen football contests between the
two Universities. The previous record
of 44-0 had stood since 1895.
Neither the line or the secondary de
fense was able to stop the Bruin back
field combination. On steady work
throughout the game the credit goes to
Buck, the plunging Cub fullback, who
gained repeated yardage through all
parts of the Stanford line. Buck was
accountable for four of the Blue and
Gold touchdowns.
The work of the other three Califor
nia backs, Captain Erb, Davis, and Van
Sant, was not to be overlooked. Aside
from a fifty-yard forward pass from
Muller for a touchdown, Van Sant dis
tinguished himself during the game with
good gains on a reverse play. Davis ac
counted for all of the goals scored,
kicking five out of the seven tries at the
posts. Davis got off a twenty-two-yard
