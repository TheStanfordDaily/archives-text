# NEW ORDERS ISSUED THAT R.O.T.C. MEN MAY KEEP UNIFORMS
## 
### 
In answer to questions sent the Ad
jutant General of the United States Army
at Washington, D. C., Major Parker has
been notified that all men in the Stan
ford military unit will be allowed to re
tain their uniforms at the end of the
spring term in June. A member of the
R. O. T. C. is not, however, entitled to
an exchange of shoes or repair for the
same at Government expense. The gov
ernment has further decided not to pre
scribe any certain sleeve insignia in the
near future, and Major Parker has
chosen a white insignia for the infantry
here, with red for the field artillery
This will mean that the Stanford unit
will have a uniformity of sleeve insignia,
instead of the present mixture of white
and blue.
Certain ordnance and military mate
i rial may now be purchased by any mem
j ber of the R. O. T. C. or any individ
ual member of the National Rifle Asso
ciation according to word received to
day from the War Department. Ball
cartridges, pistol ball cartridges, revolver
ball cartridges, and United States Rifles,
cal. 30, 1903, new models, are included
among the articles that can be purchased.
â–  The sale of pistols and revolvers has
been discontinued indefinitely.
Requests to purchase should be in
letter form, accompanied by bank draft,
money order, or certified check, made
payable to the Director of Civilian
Marksmanship.
