# CALIFORNIA PLUNGERS WILL ATTEMPT TO BATTER LINE
## CARDINAL DEFENSE MUST HOLD WELLS Evans Has Several Strong Combinations to Stop Bruin Attack 
### 
Â«I\UMMY" WELLS and Fred Brooks,
the two plunging backs on the
California varsity are rated as two
of the best ground-gainers through
the line on the Pacific Coast, and it
is almost certain that Andy Smith will
give the ball to these men in the first
r>art of the game next Saturday and
let them feel out the Cardinal line.
The question then is: Can the Stan
ford line hold Wells and Brooks?
If the Stanford line men play as
they have been taught and fight as
Stanford varsity men do, Andy Smith
will resort to open fiield tactics, and
at this game, Evans will outmatch
any backfield men that California can
produce.
In order to bring the Cardinal line
up to its fullest strength. Captain
Caughey may occupy one of the seven
positions in the line. "Cap" Campbell
lias shown that he is a fight both on
the offense and defense, and it is
likely that he will find a place as one
of the tackles at the opening of the
game. "Fat" Flowers has shown that
he can stop anything that comes his
way, and moreover, he frequently
breaks up opposing plays. Butt lacks
Flowers' weight by a hundred pounds
Sigma Rho, and Encina Club
Goldstein is now president of Eu
phronia, and lias participated in a
number of inter society arguments.
Goodman acted as alternate on the
Joffre squad last spring. Both are
members of Encina Club.
The battle Friday was fought out be
tween the eight men who survived the
two-day preliminary elimination con
test a week previous. According to
Professors V. J. West and M. R. Kirk
wood, judges, the clash Friday was
of sufficient high character to be more
interesting from the standpoint of ar
gument than personality.
M. L. McClintock, coach and veteran
debater, believes that the team chosen
is as capable as any ever entered in
the fall scrap with California.
The inter-collegiate battle is sched
uled for next Friday at Berkeley.
