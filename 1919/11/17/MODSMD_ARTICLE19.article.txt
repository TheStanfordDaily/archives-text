# BLAME IT ON WHOM?

ItTOT being football experts, we find it rather hard to place the blame for our
disappointment of Saturday. Some say, why attempt to fix it? but in
view of the fact that our defeat was not merely a California victory, but
a Stanford fiasco that will go a long ways towards bolstering up the current
rumor that Stanford spirit is waning, we are anxious to air a few opinions
gained from conversation with some of the leading football experts of the
Pacific Coast, as well as with two former All-American players.
The freshmen were at least three-quarters responsible for the miserable
affair which had been billed as a feature athletic event. It might be very in
teresting to go s nto the reasons behind the "blowing up" of the Babes, and
without doubt there are good reasons. However, as one old Stanford varsity
man said, "We have nevei' seen a Stanford team lay down on the job before."
It is a disgrace to have our players lying down 011 every possible occasion.
It has always been a rule here that Stanford players stand up during the
time out periods, and at least appear to have something left. A team may
go into a game unprepared, but players can only blame themselves for missing
tackles, for allowing their opponents to advance a full ten yards after being
tackled, for waiting until the opposition was well on its way before attempt
ing to break up the plays, instead of anticipating them and in several cases
for putting up only a nominal resistance.
We feel that the coach i3 now in a bad position, and we hesitate to hit
at a man when he is down. We do not blame Coach Acker for losing the
game. We doubt if any coach could have developed the Stanford freshmen
to a state where they could have defeated the University of California eleven.
However, football experts tell us that Acker was in a considerable measure
responsible for the lack of team work that the freshmen demonstrated on
Saturday. For the individual work, both good and bad, Acker deserves no
credit or condemnation, for he did little to develop this individual talent.
However, his eleven apparently knew very little about American football
and as a team, "showed up" their coach. If they had displayed a flash during
the afternoon ,the bleachers could have said that they showed the results
of coaching, but were clearly off form As it now stands, Acker will have
to bear the brunt of the criticism, especially as he characterized his whole
attitude by giving out false numbers of the players. This was a poor trick
for any man to do, and while such tactics may be tolerated at Owensborough,
Kentucky, the public demands a higher standard of sportmanship here.
