# MEN ARE CHOSEN FOR CALIFORNIA DEBATE
## Goldstein, Fenlason and Good-man To Represent Stanford 
### 
M. M. Goldstein, '20, C. O Fenlason,
'18, and D. L. Goodman, '22, were fin
ally named as members of the forensic
trio to meet the University of Cali
fornia after one of the keenest try
outs in Stanford's inter-collegiate de
bating history, according to statements
of the judges and coach M. L. Mc-
Clintock. The speakers faced each
other squarely on the merits of the
"Plumb Plan" and fought determinedly
through the last rebuttal for advantage
on the issues as brought out in the
first clashes. A. E. Murphy, '23, was
chosen alternate.
Fenlason, in point of experience the
oldest speaker of the team, proved the
strongest Cardinal representative in
the contest with the University of
Southern California last year. He was
formerly president of Euphronia De
bating Club, and is a member of Delta
forward pass to Erb that was directly
responsible for the first California score,
and later in the game Davis himself went
over for a score.
From the time the whistle sounded on
the kick-off until the timer's gun ended
the game, the Stanford team was at the
mercy of the Cubs. Beam's kick-offs
would send the ball within the shadows
of the Cardinal goal, which would cause
Stanford freshmen to punt and take the
defensive. It would then be only a mat
ter of time until the ball was worked
over the Stanford goal line.
The Stanford freshmen were power
less in the hands of the California babes
on both offense and defense, showing
at times both a lack of knowledge of
the game and a conspicuous lack of
"fight." The superior ability of the Bruin
backs enabled them to push through the
line at will, and the Cardinal babes were
helpless to stop them either on straight
bucks or end runs.
California gained 468 yards in scrim
mage to Stanford's 64 yards, while
Stanford made one first-down to Califor
nia's 26. Trago and Douglass punted on
a par with Beam of the Blue and Gold
squad, which kept the ball on a number
of occasions away from the Stanford
goal. . Stanford kickcd fifteen times,
while Beam only kicked six times for
the California team.
