Interclass cross country last Friday
afternoonafternoon was won by N. A.
Roussellot, '23, to the tune of 30 min
utes and 6 seconds. This record com
parer favorably with that of previous
years made on the varsity course.
Roussellot was followed by Mark
Evans, '21, who crossed the line 25
seconds later. A. M. Shepmon, '23,
took third place; G. Radcliff, '20,
fourth; M. Steinecke, '21, fifth; Mc-
Kennon, 21, sixth; Copeland and
Packard followed McKennon. Every
man who entered finished strong. The
race in general brought out good ma
terial for the varsity squad which will
compete with California next Satur
day.
A. G. Westwick, cross country train
er, set the pace and led for the 2 1-2
miles and was passed by Roussellot,
who in turn was passed by Evans.
Evans increased the pace and led for
one-half mile and then gave way to
Westwick. Westwick then held the
lead by 25 yards to the finish. At the
41-2 mile mark Rousellot passed
Evans, and Shipman passed Radcliff
and Steinecke. Every man showed
good form and Maloney commented on
the good condition of the men was
well pleased with the race. Wells
acted as starter, Maloney and Dr.
Browne were judges.
The men will ease up in work from
now until the big race on November 22.
Westwick feels confident that from
the matrial he has on hand he will
be able to pick a winning team against
California. As yet he has not an
nounced the men who will run that
day, but he did say that Eddlemon,
who has been out with an injured
foot, will be back in the running in
time to participate nevt Saturday.
