# BABES LOOSE TO U.C. IN SOCCER CONTEST
## 
### 
The freshman soccer team lost to
the California babes by a 2 0 score in
a scrappy game played Saturday on
the Beikeley field, as a curtain raiser
for the Stanford-California football
game The superior team-work of
the California frosh was the deciding
factor, one goal being scored in each
half.
Peavy, Hayes, and Davis, who was
elected captain before the same,
starred for the Stanford team. Twelve
freshmen will receive their class
numerals for playing in the game
Saturday.
