# "BIG" RUGBBY SERIES IS POSTPONED TILL AFTER CHRISTMAS
## 
### 
After a conference with California
authorities Saturday afternoon Dr. A.
D. Browne and Physical Director Harry
Maloney, acting on behalf of the Stan
ford Rugby Club, determined to post
pone the Stanford-California Rugby
matches until the winter quarter. It
had been originally intended to hold the
first of the big rugby games next Sat
urday morning, but interest in the Big
Game would have robbed the rugby
match of a great part of its attendance
and interest.
Recognizing the enthusiasm still ex
tant in the two universities the authori
ties have agreed to hold the rugby scries
after the Christmas vacation, when two
bit- games can be scheduled, without
conflicting with American football.
Two more contests practically will
conclude the work of the Stanford rug
by fifteen for the current quarter. A
return match with the Olympic Club has
been set for November 29 on the home
field, and then the team leaves for its
final clash with the Anzacs at Davis
Farm the following Saturday.
