# PERFECT INTERFERENCE SHOULD WIN GAME ON SATURDAY
## CAMPBELL MAY START AT QUARTER Speed of Bonney, Lilly and Carroll Feared by the Blue and Gold 
### 
TyiLL the fast Stanford backs be able
to break through the California de
fense and get a chancc at open field
work? is the query that is being heard
on all sides as the Big Game draws
nearer.
With men like Bonney, Patrick, Lilly,
Reynolds, Carroll, and Campbell, once
through the Berkeley primary defense,
Andy Smith will have cause to worry,
for all of these backs are liable to add
six points to the Cardinal score if they
once get a chance at an open field.
Perfect interference is needed to get
these men by the California secondary
defense, and if the Varsity men perform
as they have been taught the Stanford
backs will place more than one touch
down between the California goal posts,
but if the interference is left to "some
body else," the Varsity backs will never
get a chance at an open field run.
However, these men must first get by
the California line, and it is here that
the Stanford line men must come
through.
Indications are that Paul Campbell will
direct the Varsity in the Big Game at
quarterback, and according to the play
ers, Campbell is a field director that uses
his head and takes advantage of every
opening. The few minutes that Camp
bell worked at quarter in the Santa Clara
game showed his value and ability.
Holt probably will be one of the half
backs to start the battle because of his
skill in squeezing through the line and
his knowledge of football. Holt is also
always there when interference is need
ed. Either Bonney or Patrick will start
at the other half-back job, according to
the present lookout, with Danny Carroll,
Lilly, Reynolds, and Levy ready to step
n. However, Evans may hold Patrick
n reserve to fill Templeton's shoes in
case "Dink" is injured.
Evans has Captain Caughey and
"Here" Bihlman to draw back from the
line when the play is near the California
line. If anybody can take the pigskin
through the Bruin line for a touchdown
either of these men can do it.
