# WHY THE SMALL SHEET?

### 
JIIHE DAILY PALO ALTO was enlarged to its present size in 1913, after
*â€¢ thirteen years of publication at much smaller dimensions. The enlarge
ment was made to comply with the changing conditions at Stanford, and at
its present size, the"DAILY" has amply served its purpose to the eighteen
hundred students, the normal enrollment up to this year. We recognize the
fact that the paper is too small to do justice to Stanford under present con
ditions, and we take this opportunity of informing the students of the true
state of affairs.
The increased enrollment at Stanford, the stimulation that business has
undergone, which facilitates the securing of advertising, the increased amount
of news on the campus, and the renewed interest in the paper which has
made possible the selection of an especially capable staff have all made it
possible to publish a daily paper here at Stanford equal in size to the Daily
California, the official organ at the University of California. We face but
one obstacle, and that is in the matter of press facilities. The Daily Palo
Alto can only be published regularly when there is one press devoted solely
to the printing of the Daily. Financial uncertainties have made it impossible
for the University authorities to install a new and larger press, and until
this is done, the Daily Palo Alto will be forced to continue publication at
its present size.
