# SHOW THEM WE CAN YELL
## 
### 
lt[OW that we have made the trip to Berkeley and have seen what our rivals
across the bay can do in the way of rooting, we better know our own
shortcomings. Comment is rife as to just what the trouble is with the Stan
ford rooting section, and obviously there is something wrong. Whether
we blame it to one cause or another, the salient fact remains that we do
very little yelling, and that if our rooting is not improved by next Satur
day, we will be outclassed by California. We know that every Stanford stu
dent will be behind the team, that enthusiasm will run high, and that Stan
for spirit which has manifested itself so many times at Big Games, will
dominate the field. What we want to do Is to so direct that spirit that it
will show itself in the rooting. We suggest that every living group devote
a few minutes after meals to a practice of our Stanford songs and yells.
We request that every freshman learn these songs and yells, and come pre
pared to give a demonstration in getting behind the team which will bring
cheers even from across the bleachers. We admired the rooting of the Blue
and Gold section last Saturday, and we can do just as well Let's everybody
get into the spirit, and show them how to yell.
