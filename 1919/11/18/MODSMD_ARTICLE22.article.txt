## 
### 
The collection of Assyrian tablets,
now on display at the Museum, was dis
covered hy Edgar J. Banks of New Jer
sey, while carrying on excavations in the
-uins of Drahm, Jokha, and Durham,
tncient cities of Babylon.
The tablets are particularly interesting
n that they date as far back as 2500 B.
C. and are molded from sun-dried clay,
bearing the cuneiform figures of the As
syrian inscriptions.
They are being displayed in the Re
ent Acquisition Case, and cards bearing
the interpretation of each tablet will ex
plain their history. One interesting con
tract bears the name of Nergal-Sharezer,
son of Nebuchadnezzar, and dated in
ihe year of his reign, or 560 B. C. An
other bears the name of Darius, the
Persian king of Babylon, and is dated in
the second year of his reign.
This is the first time that this col
lection has ever been displayed, and it
is to remain on exhibition for some
time.
