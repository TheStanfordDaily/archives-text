# Japanese Poet Will Address Assembly
## Present Conditions in Japan Will Be Discussed by Prof. Noguchi 
### 
Professor Vome Noguchi, poet and
professor at Keio University, Tokyo,
will address a University Assembly at
2:15 to-morrow afternoon. Professor
Noguchi's subject will be "Japan To
day." The Committee on Public Exer
cises exepcts that this assembly will be
one of the best of the year, as Professor
Noguchi has been well received through
out his entire lecture tour which he has
been making over the United States.
As a professor in Keio University in
Tokyo Mr. Noguchi has come into inti
mate contact with the diplomatic situa
tion at the Japanese court. He has long
made a study of conditions within his |
own country and has done much toward
guiding public opinion in the other
countries of the world in regard to
Japan.
Some years ago Professor Noguchi
visited London and other parts of Eng
land. During this time he made quite
a sensation. On account of the enthusi
asm with which the Japanese poet was
received by the British, Mr. Noguchi's
visit to America was looked forward to'
with considerable interest by those who
were informed about his work.
On account of the conditions in Cali
fornia which so vitally affect the Jap
anese, Professor Noguchi's remarks will'
be even more significant, and for this
reason it is hoped by the committee that j
there will be a good attendance.
