# Northern California Rugby League Will Be Organized Soon
## 
### 
Tentative plans for the formation of
a Northern California Rugby League
were announced today by Dr. A. D.
Browne and Trainer Harry Maloney.
The league, if present negotiations
are completed, will be composed of
Stanford, University of California,
Santa Clara University, the Olympic
Club, and the Anzac Club of the Davis
Farm School.
The initial game of the league will
be postponed until the first part of
the winter quarter in order to prevent
the series from conflicting with Amer
ican football Stanford, under the
plan, will play two games with each
of the other members of the league.
As the setting of the definite dates
for the games will be left to the ath
letic managers of the different schools,
the postponed rugby match with Cali
fornia will probably be played in
January. Trainer Maloney announces
that the California Rugby Union will
offer a trophy to the team winning
the league championship and an in
dividual medal to each of the members
of the winning team.
