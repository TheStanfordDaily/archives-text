# CUSTOMS COMMITTEE MAKES REPORT ON TRADITIONS
## DEMANDS RETURN TO OLD STANDARDS Hissing at Football Games Is Condemned By the Committee 
### Burnet C. Wohlford, '18 
ffIHE past few years has seen an in
creasing disregard for the old tra
ditions and customs which grew up
during the early days of Stanford. The
war, resulting in the absence of the
older men from the University, has
brought about almost a total disre
gard for many of the most notable of
these. And the idea that every form
of freshman discipline, no matter how
flagrant the offense, is prohibited, has
seemed to put the death knell to their
observance. But many of these tra
ditions, as old as the University itself,
are worthy of the most strict obedi
ence. Not only do they merit this be
cause they are old and venerable, but
because they are founded on high
idealism, though not always appear
apparent on the surface, combined
with the most practical common sense.
These traditions should be and MUST
BE observed.
Among the traditions which should
not be violated, though they haVe been
sadly during the past years, if the
spirit of Stanford good fellowship and
democracy is to be observed are the
following:
1 No taxis or flowers —The first,
used to excess, and the second, in
every case are essentially undemo
cratic. The expense of a college life
are high enough for the many now
without adopting the precedent of
buying flowers and riding in cars for
short distances and in fine weather.
2. Rough-Neck day— r lhis is a good
wholesome custom and should be ob
served. Its first observance is sched
uled for Thursday of this week.
3. Stanford "Hello" —The merits of
this are obvious.
4. President takes off hat to students
on Quad —This applies to Chancellor
Jordan, President Emeritus Branner,
and President Wilbur, and this salute
should be returned.
5. Stanford sportmanship — There
must be no hissing or derisive remarks
by Stanford rooters or spectators dur
ing the big game. This tradition has
been violated during the present sea
son. It must not be again.
6 Freshman caps—These must be
worn by the freshmen.
7. Sophomore hats —The sophomore
class should volutarily comply with
this custom for their own apparent
good. Their freshman training was
not so severe as to entitle them to
Immunity now.
8. Rough-neck attire —There has
been to much cheap attempt to ape
the eastern clubman during the past
few yeLrs. Stanford students are not
ribbon counter clerks —to be impressed
with a display of finery. This, how
ever, is not an appeal for slovenli
ness.
9. Cords —It is up to the upper class
men to set an example by wearing
cords on the Quad.
10 No freshman queening on the
Quad.
These and other traditions, most of
them valuable, can be found in the
1915 Quad. If Stanford is to remain
a University of real men and not mere
lv society butterflies and dry-bawls,
these should be observed. It is up to
every man, and especially to upper
clas"!men, who have the interest of
the "Farm" at heart, to see to their
enforcement. It should not be neces
sary to hang the threat of punishment
over the heads of the students to se
cure their compliance. It should be
volutary. But in case certain students
are so void of real spirit as to openly
disregard all customs and traditions,
let it be remembered that national
prohibition did not apply to water.
