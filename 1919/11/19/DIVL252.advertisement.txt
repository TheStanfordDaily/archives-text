CLOTHES FOR YOUNG MEN

In this age of reconstruction there are big jobs ahead for
men who have the "sand" and education to undertake big things. "Sand" is
confidence and good clothes inspire it, especially clothes that have the style and
the tailoring that give you entree anywhere.
Society Brand Clothes rank in highest favor with men who don't want "second
best." Due to the fine hand-tailoring every garment receives, the style remains
until the fabric wears out. Always all-wool.
