# Tryoutees Defeat Varsity Debaters
## Cardinal Team Will Debate California Speakers on Friday Night 
### 
Stanford and California will fight
for a decision on the forensic stage for
the first time since 1915, at the Har
mon Gymnasium at Berkeley, Friday
night. The two universities did not
meet in debate at all last year, and
the two contests previous were "no
decision" affairs. The Joffre argu
ment with the Blue and Gold in the
spring is not a team debate.
The Cardinal trio at present con
sists of M. M. Goldstein, '20, C. O.
Fenlason, '18, and D. L. Goodman, '22,
who are now engaged in defending the
"Plumb Plan" against attacks of vari
ous combinations of speakers selected
by Coach McClintock from the de
baters' seminar course. They were
defeated last night in a contest with
A. E Murphy, '23, J. L. Anglin, '23,
and R. C. Fisher, '22. McClintock
states however that the varsity team
will be prepared by tonight to estab
lish their case against any combina
tion in the University.
