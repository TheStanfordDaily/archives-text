# Rudolph Ganz Will Give Stanford Concert Tonight
## 
### 
Rudolph Ganz, who will appear in con
cert at the Assembly Hall at 8:15 this
evening, is a man of wide research in
his profession and has a profound and
practical knowledge of musical composi
tion and methods of interpretation. He
has an equally thorough grasp of the
classic and the modern.
Much of his success is due to his per
sonality. His fine humanity and his no
bility of thought according to critics,
enter into his work as an artist to such
an extent that everything to which he
lays his hand professionally, assumes a
â–  dignity, a glowing intensity, and an ir
resistibly appealing quality under his
| touch.
