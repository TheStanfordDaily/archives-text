the other members selected.
The show will be held in the Assem-

allow plenty of time for the dance which
will follow immediately.
Rehearsals for the "Frivolous Follies
Revue" are progressing rapidly, accord
ing to the coaches, L. L. Pickering, '20.
and J. C. Schnier, '20, who promise a
well-rounded musical act, featured by

which he has spent some time in work
ing up.
