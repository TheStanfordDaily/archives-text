## AN INJUSTICE TO ACKER 
### 
We regret that we have done an
injustice to a member of our coach
ing staff. In our editorial columns
of Monday afternoon, we accused the
freshman coach of unsportmanlike
conduct. We took this stand on in
formation gained from men whom we
presumed to be in a position to know
and we are convinced that the remark
hy the coach as regards "fooling them"
in the matter of changing the numbers
'of players, was merely a chance re
mark, made in a spirit of jest. Our
freshman coach can not be blamed
for the unfortunate incident which
caused thousands inconvenience at the
game on Saturday. Proper equipment
was not furnished the freshman team,
and the jerseys were changed of ne
cessity and not as a ruse. Coach
Acker was advised to do this by
men in official position at the Stan
ford gymnasium. Not only were the
sweaters changed so the team could
present a better appearance, but the
varsity team loaned some of its equip
ment to the freshman players. The
numbers appsaring in the San Fran
cisco newspapers, and in the offiicial
program were incorrect, but this can
not be blamed on the coach, as he
was not responsible for them. We have
been accused of disloyalty to Stanford
because we expressed our opinion on
this subject. If there had been any
truth in the statement that our coach
was unsportsmanlike, we believe that
it would be our duty to take a stand
against this, and in this we would be
demonstrating our Stanford loyalty,
and truly voicing student opinion.
However, if we accuse a man upon in
formation which does not substantiate
the charge, we are doing him a grave
injustice. We have done this to
Coach Acker, and we take this op
portunity of expressing our regret, and
of apologizing to him through our
columns.
As to the Cardinal freshman team —
carefully can accuse us of calling that
team "yellow." We attempted to fix
the blame, not for the defeat, but for
an unexpected smearing, and declared
that seventy-five per cent of the
trouble was with the team itself. This
we believe to be true, and because
we object to men sprawling on their
backs whenever the whistle blows,
does not in the least place us as crit
ics who believe that our first-year
team is composed of a bunch of quit
ters. It is entirely within our juris
diction to comment on this violation
of what we know to be a custom here

at Stanford, and it is also within our
jurisdiction to criticise any sort of
unsportmanship that can be connected
with Stanford. However, we should
be resting on a foundation unshake
able when we do this latter, and this
we were not. Coach Acker has proved
himself innocent, and the fault rests
with us.

at Stanford, and it is also within our

We regret that we have done an
injustice to a member of our coach
ing staff. In our editorial columns
of Monday afternoon, we accused the
freshman coach of unsportmanlike
conduct. We took this stand on in
formation gained from men whom we
presumed to be in a position to know
and we are convinced that the remark
hy the coach as regards "fooling them"
in the matter of changing the numbers
'of players, was merely a chance re
mark, made in a spirit of jest. Our
freshman coach can not be blamed
for the unfortunate incident which
caused thousands inconvenience at the
game on Saturday. Proper equipment
was not furnished the freshman team,
and the jerseys were changed of ne
cessity and not as a ruse. Coach
Acker was advised to do this by
men in official position at the Stan
ford gymnasium. Not only were the
sweaters changed so the team could
present a better appearance, but the
varsity team loaned some of its equip
ment to the freshman players. The
numbers appsaring in the San Fran
cisco newspapers, and in the offiicial
program were incorrect, but this can
not be blamed on the coach, as he
was not responsible for them. We have
been accused of disloyalty to Stanford
because we expressed our opinion on
this subject. If there had been any
truth in the statement that our coach
was unsportsmanlike, we believe that
it would be our duty to take a stand
against this, and in this we would be
demonstrating our Stanford loyalty,
and truly voicing student opinion.
However, if we accuse a man upon in
formation which does not substantiate
the charge, we are doing him a grave
injustice. We have done this to
Coach Acker, and we take this op
portunity of expressing our regret, and
of apologizing to him through our
columns.
As to the Cardinal freshman team —
carefully can accuse us of calling that
team "yellow." We attempted to fix
the blame, not for the defeat, but for
an unexpected smearing, and declared
that seventy-five per cent of the
trouble was with the team itself. This
we believe to be true, and because
we object to men sprawling on their
backs whenever the whistle blows,
does not in the least place us as crit
