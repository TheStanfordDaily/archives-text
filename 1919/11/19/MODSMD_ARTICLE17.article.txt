# STRENGTH OF THE CARDINAL TEAM IS IN THE RESERVES
## EVANS HAS MANY SUBS Coach to Practice Tactics Used By Allies at the Beginning of War 
### 
pOING on the principle that the Al
lied army used successfully in the
early years of the warâ€”that a strong re
serve army is over half the battle, Coach
Rob Evans has built up an army of re
serve players that he can use in any of
the eleven positions of the Varsity. In
this department of the game Evans has
Andy Smith backed out.
In the backfield, Evans has Patrick,
who can substitute capably for Temple
ton at fullback, can play a halfback job
and work in one of the end positions if
needed. "Pat" is not far behind Temple
ton in kicking. The halfback jobs can
be filled by Holt, Bonney, Carroll. Rey
nolds, Lillv Levy, Caughey, Campbell,
or Bob Shlaudeman. At quarterback
Paul Campbell, Wark, or Holt can offi
ciate without trouble.
In the line, "Swede" Righter has Pallet
to take his place at center. Men who
can fill the guaiM positions are Caughey,
Rililman, Butt, and Flowers. "Cap"
Campbell, Flowers, Pershing, and Butt
are all good tackles, and the line will
be safe with any of these men working.
Two end combinations are available in
Adams and Curtice and Pelouze and
Shlaudeman.
Andy Smith is weak in reserve ma
terial, as has been shown in games played
this season. Wells Brooks, Rowe, Mur
ray, and Cass are the only good backs on
the California squad. In the line, Smith
has seven good men and only two capable
substitutes.
If it comes to a battle of reserve men,
Stanford has the edge.
