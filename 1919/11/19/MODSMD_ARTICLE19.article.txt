# Fraternities Cannot Pledge Own "Hashers"
## 
### 
No fraternity can consider a freshman
for membership who is working for
board or lodging in that particular house
as the result of a by-law passed by
the Tnterfraternity Conference at its
regular monthly meeting last night. This
ruling, however, does not prevent the
freshman from becoming a pledge of
any other fraternity.
The object of this ruling is to prevent
any fraternity from keeping a prospec
tive pledge in the house during his first
quarter at the University under the pre
tense that he is working, when, in fact,
'ie may be doing only a nominal amount
of work.
Details for issuing bids on December
7 were worked out at the meeting and
vill be completed in the near future.
