"One word —Tragedy—can be used
to describe the wnole history of Ser
bia," said Lieutenant Milutin Krunich
in his talk 011 "Serbia and Her Peo
ple," in the Little Theater last night.
Beginning with an outline of Serbian
history and the effect of its geograph
ical position, tracing the character of
the Serbian people, and ending with
an appeal to America to help the
war sufferers.
He pointed out that little Serbia
was the cause and beginning of the
World War. Germany wished to se
cure control of this highroad from
Europe to Asia. It was to find a rea
son for war that the Kaiser staged
the assissination of the Archduke. The
Kaiser called Serbia "A dirty little
Democratic rag" and"the worm to
be crushed."
"From the first fire on Belgrade this
'little worm' became a giant," said
Lieutenant Krunich. "We fought like
lions because we knew it was our
last chance to fight for freedom."
