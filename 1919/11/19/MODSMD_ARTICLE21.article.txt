# THAT BIG GAME RALLY
## 
### 
OF all nights that Stanford students remember, none can compare with the
night of the "Big Game Rally." That wild time in the assembly, where
two thousand students jump spasmodically on the seats, and paying no at
tention to th pleadings of the yell leaders to cease, gives vent to the real
Stanford enthusiasm, is a time that lingers long in the minds of our alumni.
It is th great night that comes but once a year in the lifetime of the Stan
ford students, it is the night when the varsity team reigns supreme. Every
student places his desire, his hope, his enthusiasm on the varsity. The speech
es of the coach, the captain, the trainer, and the veterans now in alumni
are received with tremendous acclaim, whether they are good or not. In
one grand riot, two thousand students serpentine to the bonfire for the great
climax. Here, lit up by the flames from the massive pyre, the faces of our
students beam with an enthusiasm that only the rally and the anticipation
of the Big Game can ever produce. Stanford's rally is a great event in the
life of the University, its influence is felt by players and spectators alike, and
will go a long way towards winning this Big Game, as it has done in so many
other Stanford-California football contests. Thursday night is the night, and
we await it with great expectation.
