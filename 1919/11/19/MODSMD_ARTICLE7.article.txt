# ROUGHS' DAY IS ON TAPIS TOMORROW
## 
### 
Roughs' Day, ,one of the oldest of
Stanford's traditions, will he observed
on the Quad tomorrow. Old clothes
that even tliQ Red Cross would refuse to
take, outlandish garbsâ€”in fact, any cos
tume that is out of the ordinary, will be
the order of the day. White collars will
be absolutely taboo. Shaves will almost
be serious offense enough for the w. k.
water cure. The committee which re
cently was appointed to take steps to
rvive Stanford traditions, has announced
that every male student should observe
the day with an appropriate costume.
