# FRESHMAN BONFIRE IS NEARING COMPLETION
## 
### 
The Cardinal freshmen have turned
out en masse to show the campus
what they can do as their share of the
famous Big Game bonfire rally, which
will be pulled off Thursday night, and
every inch on the valley for miles
around has been scoured for anything
that will make smoke on that night.
The sophomore committee under
J. H. Colton, '22, are directing the
vork and keeping careful check on thr
freshmen for their ten hours prescrib
ed work. It has not been definitely
decided what stunt will be featured
on top of the bonfire, but the com
mittee in charge promises a surprise
which will be novel an fitting to the
occasion.
