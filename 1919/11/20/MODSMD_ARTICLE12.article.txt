# Seven Vaudeville Acts to Feature Ram's Head Show
## 
### 
Fitting together seven varied acts
into a well-rounded vaudeville show, is
the task accomplished by L. L. Pickering,
'20, and J. C. Schnier, '20. coaches for
the football show Saturday night.
A great deal of effort has been ex
pended on the "Frivolous Follies Revue"
to make it the headline act. Featuring a
mysterious leading man and a chorus
of co-eds, in a number of the latest
song hits of the season, the coaches
promise an act of unusual merit.
"Three Foolish Moments" is the title
of the comedy act, in which L. L. Pick
ering, '20, promises to keep the audience
in an uproar for the full three minutes.
The trick act which has been secured
by the coaches has played to capacity
houses in professional vaudeville, and
recently filled an extended engagement
at Tait's in San Francisco.
A number of musical acts are on the
boards, including a skit written by R. W.
Swell, '20, especially for this occasion.
Swell has had offers from a number of
vaudeville managers to produce this act
on the professional stage, and also to
publish the music, but has declined.
The demand for seats has been partic
ularly heavy, as the football show will
be the only attraction at the time on
the campus. Immediately following the
show the football dance will take place
in the gym.
