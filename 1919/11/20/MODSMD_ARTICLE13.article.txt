## 
### 
In the forthcoming issue of the
Cardinal, Mr. E. H. Sniffin, the head
of the Power Pepartment of the West
inghouse Electric Co., writes under the
title of "The Engineer and the Com
munity," an article which will appeal
to every engineer in the University,
as well as to all other students in
scientific departments.
He shows the training of the engi
neer, as a man, and makes a plea
for him to take a larger place in the
life of the community and the nation
Mr. Sniffin believes that the engineer
is particularly fitted to play a nat
able part in the nation's activities,
especially in the field of politics and
public service. Toward this end he
urges the University to make broader
education a point, and to impress engi
neering students with the necessity
of their entering public life.
The appearance of the Cardinal has
been postponed until the first of next
week, owing to the great number of
interests and activities which are
scheduled for the next few days.
