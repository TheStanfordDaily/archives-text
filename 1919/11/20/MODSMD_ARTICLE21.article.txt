# VIOLATING OUR AGREEMENT
## 
### 
P* absolute violation of an explicit agreement between former President
Benjamin Ide Wheeler of the University of California, and President Ray
Lyman Wilbur of Stanford, that there should be no invasions of rival campus
es, three Stanford students last night placed this University in as bad a po
sition as could possibly be imagined three days prior to our Big Game. These
students painted the Sather Gate, they painted a private residence in Berke
ley, and they kidnapped a University of California senior, who only escaped
after being driven to Niles.
Dean Charles Gayley of the University of California phoned to Acting
President C. D. Marx this noon, and informed him of the violation of the
agreement and demanded to know what we were going to do about it. The
Student Council met this afternoon, and we have decided on four points, if
this was done by Stanford students, viz:
As a student body, we must immediately make full apology to the stu
dents of the University of California.
We must make every effort to find out who amongst our number perpe
trated this violation which endangers the playing of the Big Game.
As a student body we must absolutely condemn this action.
We congratulate the students of the University of California in that
they restrained those who would have retaliated by an invasion of our
campus.
This is a much more srious matter than many of our students are wont
to believe. American football and the Big Game are both on trial, and If we
expcet to keep them, we must condemn such actions.
