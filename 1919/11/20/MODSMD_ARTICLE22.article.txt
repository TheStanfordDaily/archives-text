# THE
						DES MOINES CONFERENCE
## 
### 
OUR news columns have mentioned the Student Volunteer Movement con
ducted by the Y. M. C. A. which will culminate in the Des Moines Con
ference to be held during the latter part of December and the first week of
January. This conference is the eighth quadrennial conference of the Student
Volunteer Movement, and its purpose is to bring representatives together
from every university and college in the United Stats and Canada. We have
been told by the Y. M. C. A. authorities that over six thousand young men
will be in attendance, young men from every part of the country, and from
every walk of life. Of course the ultimate aim of this conference is to
create such an enthusiasm among the minority who will come as delegates
that they will take back this animation to their own institutions, form the
nucleus of groups in their universities which will be an uplifting influence
upon the general life of the locality which they represent.
Stanford will send ten men to lowa to attend this conference. Consider
ing our relatively small size, and the distance from Des Moines, we be
lieve this to be a good representation. The men are traveling at their own
expense, and are dependent largely on their own enthusiasm. This should
not be the case. We Stanford men, and for that matter, women, should
ralize that our own sphere may be greatly broadened by the influence of
these men. They will undoubtedly larn many things of interest, and in meet
ing delegations from practically every university in both our own country
and Canada, will get a viewpoint that we have not. We tend towards a
certain degree of isolation here, and this conference can have a splendid
influence in our University.
