# Art Gallery Will Be Closed For Two Weeks
## 
### 
With the termination of the Textile
Exhibit, November 17, the Art Gal
lery will be closed for a period of
two weeks, or until the arrival of the
collection of water colors which are
expected about December 15.
The water color display is the sec
ond of the series scheduled for ex
hibition and promises to be one of
the most beautiful of the set., owing
to the soft coloring and pastel shades
used in all the pictures.
This will be the last exhibit dis
played this quarter, but a number of
others will follow throughout the col
lege year.
