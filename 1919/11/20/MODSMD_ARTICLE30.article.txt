## 
### 
In order to give all former service
men whose insurance has lapsed or
been canceled a fair cnance to re
instate their insurance, a special
blanket ruling has been made, allow
ing ex-service men to reinstate their
insurance before December 31, 1919,
provided that each applicant is in as
good health as at the date of dis
charge. It is necessary that the ap
plicant tender two month's premiums
on the amount of insurance he wishes
to reoinstate.
Under the new ruling a man is al
lowed 18 months from the date of
discharge for reinstatement on the
