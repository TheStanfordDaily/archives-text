# Stanford Concert Has Big Attendance
## Rudolph Ganz Attracts Crowd With Good Music and Personality 
### 
By Jean Frickleton, '20
No American business man could
have appeared before an audience
more unassumingly or with less af
fectation, than did the famous Rudolph
Ganz last night. It was such a relief
to have no external characteristics or
peculiarities, that most artist affect,
to detract the attention of the audience
from the music itself.
The renunciation of sensational ef
fects was noticeable in his playing
as well as in his personal appearance.
Entirely free from exaggerated senti
mentality. he gave a healthy and sane
interpretation of his program that
lacked neither dramatic force nor
tenderness.
His active work, as shown by the
range of his entire program, was
wonderful. With great power he made
♦he piano sing or storm at will. His
light playing, in the fourth move
ment of MacDowell's "Sonata Eroica"
and in the "Preludes" by the wierdly
artificial Debussy, was sparKling in
brilliancy, and there seemed to be no
limit to his speed. In "Fireworks" he
made extraordinary use of the pedal,
producing an effect of luminosity that
was new and audacious.
Interpreted with an individual style
and forcefulness of character, Liszt
was prcuably the greatest number on
the program. The "Variations on a
Motiv" by Bach, displayed the won
derful versatility that has done much
to extend the fame of Ganz.
The program closed with always
gratefully accepted Chopin, that left
the feeling that Ganz had given even
a greater performance than on his
former appearance here.
