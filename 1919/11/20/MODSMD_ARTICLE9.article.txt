# Roughs Hold Sway on Quad; Stanford Tradition Revived
## 
### 
Roughs' Day came back to the Stan
ford "Farm" with a bang to-day. More
than half the male students appeared on
the quad in costumes that represented
most everything that could be represent
ed. The day was marked with parades
up and down the quad from the Engi
neering corncr to the Law steps. At both
these places the rough's put on various
performances for the entertainment of
the non-roughs, both male and female.
Rough's Day is one of Stanford's old
est traditions. The Traditions Commit
tee, recently appointed to revive tradi
tions on the campus, is responsible for
the spirit shown today. The committee
has been given the job of seeing that all
of Stanford's traditions he brought back
the same way Roughs' Day was brought
back today.
