## 
### 
"Beyond a doubt tomorrow's game
will be a good fight. Both teams have
had successful preliminary games, and
the results of the Big Game may be
caused by the breaks falling one way
or the other. The California team is
more experienced in the American
;amc but the contest will be primarily
i battle of opposing lines. The side with
he best offensive and defensive line will
:o off the field a victor. Stanford's line
lay make up what they lack in experi
nce with their superior weight and fight.
Vin or lose, the Reds will be true sports
ten during the game."
