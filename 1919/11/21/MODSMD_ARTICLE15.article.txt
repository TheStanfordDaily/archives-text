# Wild Enthusiasm Shown at Bonfire
## Football Squad Gets Big Send-off at Annual Rally 
### 
After several days of probably the
highest keyed enthusiasm ever experi
enced on the Stanford "Farm." students
had the opportunity to partially relieve
the situation last night at the annual
football rally. And it was received
with a will.
Under the direction of Yell Leader
"Doc" Martin and his assistants, Bob
Armstrong and W. H. Kinney, the roof
raising qualities of a Stanford gathering
were tested to the utmost. Music was
supplied by the Stanford hand.
The two alumni speakers at the rally
were Leland Cutler and Frank English,
vho were heartily received by the en
husiasm of the overflowing hall. Cut
'er and English are prominent alumni of
Francisco, who have been closely
•onnected with Stanford athletics for
many years. They told how the Cardi
lal generally managed to come out on
the best end of battles in previous
years. Both men stated that they had
faith in this year's team fighting its
way to victory.
Following these talks Yell Leader
Martin called on Captain Caughey and
Coach Evans for a few words. Cheer
ng reigned supreme for several minutes
after each of them took the floor.
Caughey said that Stanford had a good
1919 football squad, with lots of fight.
He said that they were going into tho
game fighting their hardest for victory,
but should the breaks go against them
in the first part of the contest, they
would never admit defeat until the final
whistle had sounded.
Coach Evans said that he had a Var
sity squad of twenty-seven players with no
substitutes. At the present time he has
not selected the line-up to start the game.
Evans spent a large portion of his time
I speaking of the value of a football train-
ing to the college student.
Then the indoor rally broke up and the
crowd adjourned to the blazing bonfire
in back of Encina. In almost the first
instant after being set, the flames tore
up through the pyre and demolished the
sham Campanile of the Blue and Gold
hopes erected on the top of the structure.
The fire spread immediately, and the
whole was one burning mass on the ar
rival of the serpentining students from
the rally. It is estimated that there
were over six thousand students and
Palo Alto residents to witness the bonfire
rally.

faith in this year's team fighting its
way to victory.
Following these talks Yell Leader
Martin called on Captain Caughey and
Coach Evans for a few words. Cheer
ng reigned supreme for several minutes
after each of them took the floor.
Caughey said that Stanford had a good
1919 football squad, with lots of fight.
He said that they were going into tho
game fighting their hardest for victory,
but should the breaks go against them
in the first part of the contest, they
would never admit defeat until the final
whistle had sounded.
Coach Evans said that he had a Var
sity squad of twenty-seven players with no
substitutes. At the present time he has
not selected the line-up to start the game.
Evans spent a large portion of his time
I speaking of the value of a football train-
ing to the college student.
Then the indoor rally broke up and the
crowd adjourned to the blazing bonfire
in back of Encina. In almost the first
instant after being set, the flames tore
up through the pyre and demolished the
sham Campanile of the Blue and Gold
hopes erected on the top of the structure.
The fire spread immediately, and the
whole was one burning mass on the ar
rival of the serpentining students from
the rally. It is estimated that there
were over six thousand students and
Palo Alto residents to witness the bonfire
rally.
After several days of probably the
highest keyed enthusiasm ever experi
enced on the Stanford "Farm." students
had the opportunity to partially relieve
the situation last night at the annual
football rally. And it was received
with a will.
Under the direction of Yell Leader
"Doc" Martin and his assistants, Bob
Armstrong and W. H. Kinney, the roof
raising qualities of a Stanford gathering
were tested to the utmost. Music was
supplied by the Stanford hand.
The two alumni speakers at the rally
were Leland Cutler and Frank English,
vho were heartily received by the en
husiasm of the overflowing hall. Cut
'er and English are prominent alumni of
Francisco, who have been closely
•onnected with Stanford athletics for
many years. They told how the Cardi
lal generally managed to come out on
the best end of battles in previous
years. Both men stated that they had
faith in this year's team fighting its
way to victory.
