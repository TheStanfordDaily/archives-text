# THE 						BIG GAME
## 
### 
r)MORROW is not only the greatest day of the year in Pacific Coast athletics,
but it is a memorable occasion for all time; it marks the resumption of football
relations between two great rivals, between the two universities whose splendid
friendship makes an even keener spirit of rivalry on the athletic field. To those
who lived through the days of the break in football relations between Stanford
and California, the fact that we are to again play the Big Game comes as a great
relief, for who among us doubts but that the gridiron and not the conference table
is the place to contest? Since 1914 trivialities have kept the two universities apart,
but sound judgment has won out, and tomorrow will be the climax of policies
on the part of the present Stanford and California representatives which have
been marked by diplomacy of a high order.
When the referee's whistle sends the two elevens against each other tomor
row, twenty thousand people will rise as one great unit in a mighty cheer. Say
what we will about the value of intercollegiate competition on the same scale
with other institutions, the Big Game is our supreme athletic event. It is the
one occasion when present students, alumni, faculty, and Stanford friends are
knit in perfect harmonious accord. Every one of these will be yelling for a
Cardinal victory, but no matter what the final outcome may be, to all who hold
the Cardinal dear, the wearers of the Stanford jerseys will be "their varsity,
win or lose, their varsity."
We have had our rally; we have heard the dope; our coach, captain, and
alumni critics have told us how we stand. Stanford has a lighting chance for a
wonderful victory, and what Cardinal team ever asked for more?
