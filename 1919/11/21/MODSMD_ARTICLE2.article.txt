# Smith Announces California Line-Up
## Sprott to Officiate at Quarter Back For the Bear Varsity Team 
### 
Both Coach Evans of the Stanford
rarsity and Coach Smith of the Cali
fornia varsity gave their men light
work yesterday as a linal practice be
fore the Big Ga/iitt tomorrow after
noon at 2:45 on the Stanford turf.
Coach Evans will not announce the
Stanford line-up until just before the
game, but Andy Smith has issued the
following line-up for the California
varsity:

This line-up contains one surprise
at the half back job where Deeds Is
scheduled to play. Sprott will start at
quarter, as intimated before by Cali
fornia report**. The line is the same
as it has been, with Wilson as the
first California substitute to be
called in case of necessity. "Shad"
Howe and Murray will undoubtedly
ret into the game as halfbacks.
The California line will average
•about 176 pounds and the backfleld
will reach 174. These averages give
the Blue and Gold a fairly well-bal
anced team as to weight.
Although the Stanford line-up has not
been announced, the weight average
will probably pass the California
mark. Caughey, Bihlman, Flowers,
Righter and Campbell are all heavy
men. Flowers takes the high water
mark with 200 pounds.
The Cardinal backfleld will prob
ably average kwer than the Berke
ley quartet. The Stanford men are
fast and particularly able at open
field work, and not straight line
plunging. Caughey and Bihlman are
expected to provide the necessary
punch when straight line bucking is
needed.
Rvans will probably match Paul
Campbell against Sprott, the heavy
man who will call signals for the
Blue and Gold. Campbell Is a cool
headed player and can be depended
upon in an emergency. Smith is plac
ing the same reliance upon Sprott,
who although not wholly recovered
from injuries, can direct the California
destinies in a capable fashion. If
Sprott is injured, Smith will more
than likely shift Deeds to quarter and
send either "Shad" Rowe or Murray
in at half. Gimbal may also work
at quarter.
Smith has put his best and strong
est line men in the line-up. However,
Evans has "Swede" Righter, Caughey,
Butt, Flowers, "Cap" Campbell, Persh
ing, Curtice, Adams, Pelouze, and
Schlaudeman to pick fram to start
against the California seven, and if
the game is a battle of lines, the Stan
ford goal will be amply fortified with
seven strong men playing on the line.
If the Stanford line forces Wells
and Brooks to give up the line-buck
ing game, the California coach has
Murray and "Shad" Rowe, two fast
men to work an open field game with.
As a preliminary to the Big Game,
the California and Stanford varsity
soccer teams will clash. Following
the soccer game and just before the
start of the Big Game, the California
and Stanford cross country teams will
finish their annual race with a lap
around the field.

at quarter.
Smith has put his best and strong
est line men in the line-up. However,
Evans has "Swede" Righter, Caughey,
Butt, Flowers, "Cap" Campbell, Persh
ing, Curtice, Adams, Pelouze, and
Schlaudeman to pick fram to start
against the California seven, and if
the game is a battle of lines, the Stan
ford goal will be amply fortified with
seven strong men playing on the line.
If the Stanford line forces Wells
and Brooks to give up the line-buck
ing game, the California coach has
Murray and "Shad" Rowe, two fast
men to work an open field game with.
As a preliminary to the Big Game,
the California and Stanford varsity
soccer teams will clash. Following
the soccer game and just before the
start of the Big Game, the California
and Stanford cross country teams will
finish their annual race with a lap
around the field.
Both Coach Evans of the Stanford
rarsity and Coach Smith of the Cali
fornia varsity gave their men light
work yesterday as a linal practice be
fore the Big Ga/iitt tomorrow after
noon at 2:45 on the Stanford turf.
Coach Evans will not announce the
Stanford line-up until just before the
game, but Andy Smith has issued the
following line-up for the California
varsity:

This line-up contains one surprise
at the half back job where Deeds Is
scheduled to play. Sprott will start at
quarter, as intimated before by Cali
fornia report**. The line is the same
as it has been, with Wilson as the
first California substitute to be
called in case of necessity. "Shad"
Howe and Murray will undoubtedly
ret into the game as halfbacks.
The California line will average
•about 176 pounds and the backfleld
will reach 174. These averages give
the Blue and Gold a fairly well-bal
anced team as to weight.
Although the Stanford line-up has not
been announced, the weight average
will probably pass the California
mark. Caughey, Bihlman, Flowers,
Righter and Campbell are all heavy
men. Flowers takes the high water
mark with 200 pounds.
The Cardinal backfleld will prob
ably average kwer than the Berke
ley quartet. The Stanford men are
fast and particularly able at open
field work, and not straight line
plunging. Caughey and Bihlman are
expected to provide the necessary
punch when straight line bucking is
needed.
Rvans will probably match Paul
Campbell against Sprott, the heavy
man who will call signals for the
Blue and Gold. Campbell Is a cool
headed player and can be depended
upon in an emergency. Smith is plac
ing the same reliance upon Sprott,
who although not wholly recovered
from injuries, can direct the California
destinies in a capable fashion. If
Sprott is injured, Smith will more
than likely shift Deeds to quarter and
send either "Shad" Rowe or Murray
in at half. Gimbal may also work
at quarter.
