# Smith Announces California Line-Up
## Sprott to Officiate at Quarter Back For the Bear Varsity Team 
### 
Both Coach Evans of the Stanford
rarsity and Coach Smith of the Cali
fornia varsity gave their men light
work yesterday as a linal practice be
fore the Big Ga/iitt tomorrow after
noon at 2:45 on the Stanford turf.
Coach Evans will not announce the
Stanford line-up until just before the
game, but Andy Smith has issued the
following line-up for the California
varsity:

This line-up contains one surprise
at the half back job where Deeds Is
scheduled to play. Sprott will start at
quarter, as intimated before by Cali
fornia report**. The line is the same
as it has been, with Wilson as the
first California substitute to be
called in case of necessity. "Shad"
Howe and Murray will undoubtedly
ret into the game as halfbacks.
The California line will average
â€¢about 176 pounds and the backfleld
will reach 174. These averages give
the Blue and Gold a fairly well-bal
anced team as to weight.
Although the Stanford line-up has not
been announced, the weight average
will probably pass the California
mark. Caughey, Bihlman, Flowers,
Righter and Campbell are all heavy
men. Flowers takes the high water
mark with 200 pounds.
The Cardinal backfleld will prob
ably average kwer than the Berke
ley quartet. The Stanford men are
fast and particularly able at open
field work, and not straight line
plunging. Caughey and Bihlman are
expected to provide the necessary
punch when straight line bucking is
needed.
Rvans will probably match Paul
Campbell against Sprott, the heavy
man who will call signals for the
Blue and Gold. Campbell Is a cool
