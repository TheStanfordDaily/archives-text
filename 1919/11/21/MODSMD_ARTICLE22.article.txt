# STANFORD DISAVOWS BERKELEY INVASION
## WILL PUNISH VIOLATORS Resolution Adopted at Rally And Telephoned to California 
### 
A complete disavowal of the acts of
the irresponsible Stanford students who
invaded the California campus Wednes
day night and committed acts of van
dalism was taken by the assembled stu
dent body at the big game rally last
night.
Every possible effort will be made by
the Student authorities to place, the
blame, and the offenders if caught will
be dealt with by the Student Control
Council. A resolution expressing the
attitude of the Stanford student body
was adopted and telephoned to Califor
nia last night.
This difficulty arose when several
Stanford students went to Berkeley late
Wednesday night, painted Sather Gate,
a University of California memorial ob
ject; painted a private residence in
Berkeley, and committed other outrages.
Such an action was in direct violation of
an agreement made last summer between
President Benjamin Ide Wheeler of Cal
ifornia and President Ray Lyman Wil
bur of Stanford that upon the resump
tion of intercollegiate football relations
between the two universities, no student
from either university should be allowed
to invade the campus of a rival universi
ty and commit acts of violence.
Violation of this agreement by students
was to constitute serious enough offense
that authorities of either university-could
call off the inter-collegiate football game.
So far this year California students
have lived up to the letter of this agree
ment, and student authorities at both in
stitutions have done all in their power to
keep this agreement, and the action of
Wednesday night was purely an unrep
resentative action by irresponsible stu
dents.
The resolution which was adopted at
the rally last night and telephoned to
California to be read at their rally there
is as follows:
Be it resolved that:
We, the Students of Stan
ford University, do hereby publicly dis
avow the action taken by irresponsible
metnbcrs of our Student Body for the
invasion of the University of California
campus on the night of November 19,
1919.
We recognize this act as a flagrant
violation of the agreement between the
two universities and pledge ourselves to
do all in our power to prevent any fur
t.ier violation of this agreement.
We wish to heartily commend the ac
tion of the University of California Stu
dent Body in preventing any similar out
rage on the Stanford campus.
