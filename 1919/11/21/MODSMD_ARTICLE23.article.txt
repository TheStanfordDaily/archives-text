# SPORTING EDITOR SAYS CALIFORNIA HAS NO "CINCH" THINKS U.C. WILL WIN
## Outlines Possibilities of Blue and Gold Team In the "Big Game" 
### Warren W. Brown 
(Sporting Editor San Francisco Call)
WHO will win the big game? Isn't
that the question that is uppermost
in the football fan's mind these days?
Three weeks ago, I should say with
out reservation, that the Blue and
Gold team, in sport page parlance,
was a "cinch." Now I'm not so sure.
in checking up the Stanford pros
pects, I am at the disadvantage of
never having seen the team "go."
California, in successive starts against
St. Mary's Occidental, Washington
State, and the Oregon Aggies, showed
steady improvement in some depart
ments, and a pronounced case of "in
and-outtitis" in others.
Stanford will have to watch "Shad"
Rowe, the U. C. half.
This husky young chap is a real
"bear" of the entire Bruin squad at
dashing up and down the field with
the pigskin. He is also some per
former at flinging the leathern egg
across the chalk lines in the forward
pass. Unless Rowe is effectively
smothered he will be "bad medicine"
for Stanford all afternoon on the 22d.
In "Dummy" Wells, California boasts
the hardest line plunger it has ever
been my good fortune to see. "Dum
my" tears gaps through the line and
advances the ball as though his op
position were tissue paper. And yet
it is significant that in the Washing
ton State game, the ball was Cali
fornia's on the one-yard line TWICE
in the game, with three downs to go
AND CALIFORNIA LOST r l HE BALL
ON DOWNS! Off hand, I should say
that the line plunger who makes his
gains in those final ten yards is the
plunger for my money. My reader
however, can form his own conclu
sions.
Murray, a U. C. half-back, who gets
into the games every so often, is
faster, I think, in football togs than
any members of the Stanford squad.
In this connection I cannot help but
recall an axiom in baseball, whenever
the question of a "fast" man, or a
good base runner, who is a weak hit
ter, comcs up for discussion. "YOU
HAVE GOT TO GET ON THERE
FIRST BEFORE YOU CAN RUN!"
In Murray's case, he not only has to
get in there, but he also has to get
the ball through that Stanford line
to accomplish i ny good for his Alma
Mater. But if he does —well, WATCH
HIM GO!
So far, I imagine the reader will
think this article is awfully gloomy
to be considered for publication in a
Stanford newspaper. But isn't it
better to get some "dope" on a team
that has not shown on the "Farm"
rather tlian a lot of stuff on the team
you've been watching every after
noon there was practice.
If Stanford were only fifty per cent
as strong a team as California I'd hesi
tate to say the team would show up
that weak against U. C. in the "Big
Game." Som3how Stanford always
seems to go faster and fight harder
against California than against any
one else. That's why I'm sort o' hedg
ing my opinion, on the "California
a cinch" idea.
I still think U. C. will win. I'll be
surprised if Stanford does. But I'm
not going to fall off my seat in amaze
ment if the boys from the "Farm"
give U. C. one "heluva" battle. That's
a way Stanford has.

was a "cinch." Now I'm not so sure.
in checking up the Stanford pros
pects, I am at the disadvantage of
never having seen the team "go."
California, in successive starts against
St. Mary's Occidental, Washington
State, and the Oregon Aggies, showed
steady improvement in some depart
ments, and a pronounced case of "in
and-outtitis" in others.
Stanford will have to watch "Shad"
Rowe, the U. C. half.
This husky young chap is a real
"bear" of the entire Bruin squad at
dashing up and down the field with
the pigskin. He is also some per
former at flinging the leathern egg
across the chalk lines in the forward
pass. Unless Rowe is effectively
smothered he will be "bad medicine"
for Stanford all afternoon on the 22d.
In "Dummy" Wells, California boasts
the hardest line plunger it has ever
been my good fortune to see. "Dum
my" tears gaps through the line and
advances the ball as though his op
position were tissue paper. And yet
it is significant that in the Washing
ton State game, the ball was Cali
fornia's on the one-yard line TWICE
in the game, with three downs to go
AND CALIFORNIA LOST r l HE BALL
ON DOWNS! Off hand, I should say
that the line plunger who makes his
gains in those final ten yards is the
plunger for my money. My reader
however, can form his own conclu
sions.
Murray, a U. C. half-back, who gets
into the games every so often, is
faster, I think, in football togs than
any members of the Stanford squad.
In this connection I cannot help but
recall an axiom in baseball, whenever
the question of a "fast" man, or a
good base runner, who is a weak hit
ter, comcs up for discussion. "YOU
HAVE GOT TO GET ON THERE
FIRST BEFORE YOU CAN RUN!"
In Murray's case, he not only has to
get in there, but he also has to get
the ball through that Stanford line
to accomplish i ny good for his Alma
Mater. But if he does —well, WATCH
HIM GO!
So far, I imagine the reader will
think this article is awfully gloomy
to be considered for publication in a
Stanford newspaper. But isn't it
better to get some "dope" on a team
that has not shown on the "Farm"
rather tlian a lot of stuff on the team
you've been watching every after
noon there was practice.
If Stanford were only fifty per cent
as strong a team as California I'd hesi
tate to say the team would show up
that weak against U. C. in the "Big
Game." Som3how Stanford always
seems to go faster and fight harder
against California than against any
one else. That's why I'm sort o' hedg
ing my opinion, on the "California
a cinch" idea.
I still think U. C. will win. I'll be
surprised if Stanford does. But I'm
not going to fall off my seat in amaze
ment if the boys from the "Farm"
give U. C. one "heluva" battle. That's
a way Stanford has.
