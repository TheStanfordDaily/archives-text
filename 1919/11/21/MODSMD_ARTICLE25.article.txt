# CARDINAL VARSITY WILL ENTER CONTEST WITH STRONG PERSONNEL
## 
### 
Stanford's Varsity eleven, which will
run on the field tomorrow, will be the
best of a squad of twenty-seven players.
Competition has been so keen for the po
sitions on the team that Coach Evarts has
refused to announce the line-up until the
last minute.
The men to start the game and those
going in during the contest, individually
and collectively, will exhibit perfect
specimens of what college men and espe
cially those who wear the Cardinal
| should be. The previous showing of the
! men during their preliminary games
does much credit to the individual play
ers and to the coach.
Coach Evans has worked an American
team out of a squad of men knowing
practically nothing about the game,
j However, most of the players have
played rugby at Stanford, and the out
come of tomorrow's game is being
watched with particular interest. It will
show the football experts just what good
coaching can do.
George Herman Bihlman
"Here" Bihlman will be another of
Coach Evans' hopes in the Stanford
line, where he may start as one of
1 the guards. Bihlman tips the scales
at an even 200 pounds which may

prove a difficulty for the Bears to
push over. Here played rugby several
years ago at Stanford, and is well up
on football tactics. He is an Entom
ology major at Stanford, and registers
from Live Oak. He is 24 years old,
and a member of Encina Club.
Robert Forsyth Pelouze
Rob Pelouze's speed must be watched
by the Berkeley team or they may find

the Cardinal shoving a touchdown over.
Pclouzc is a varsity track sprinter and
runs on the football field just as fast
Boh will start the game at end, where
his experience as a runner and training

in basketball will be brought into play.
He comes from Medford and is a law
student. He weighs 155 pounds and is
a Sigma Nu.
Richard Scull Pershing
Dick Pershing will be one of the men
used in the line to stop the plunging
Berkeley backfield. He is 19 years old,
and his 170 pounds is a valuable addi
tion to the total line weight. The coach
has been playing Pershing at tackle. In
size he is an ideal tackle, being 6 feet
tall. He comes from Los Angeles and
majors in Economics. He is a member
of Chi Psi fraternity.
Forrest Arthur Betts
"Red" Betts will fit in the line to
morrow at guard. Betts is one of those
men who have improved until he i:
guaranteed a chance to get into tin
game, although he has had no previ
ous experience in the game. He if
22 years old and majors in law. In
size, he is an ideal guard, standing
5 feet, 10 inches. He weighs 180
pounds, registers from Phoenix, Ariz ,
and is a member of Encina Club.
Cornelius Erwin Righter
"Swede" Righter will use his 186
pounds of bone and muscle as the center
of the Stanford bulwark which Evans is
hoping will be able to put a stop to the
hard-hitting Blue and Gold backfield.

"Swede" claims Campbell as his home
town and is 22 years of age. He is a
member of Encina Club and majors in
history. As the center and capta:n of
last season's basketball team, Righter was
the greatest point-maker for the Reds.
Edgar Reginald Caughey
Captain Reg Caughey, while a fast,
hard-hitting backfield man, probably will
start the game at the position of guard
because of the strength he will be able
to add to the line. As a skipper, Reg is
a man who is able to keep his squad in
the best of working condition. He is
one of the few four star Varsity men
in Stanford. Caughey weighs 186
pounds and is 26 years old. He comes
from Ukiah, and is a member of Encina
Club, and is studying law.
Karl Whitman Schlaudeman
"Rab" Schlaudeman is another fast
man who has been working for the
position of end. Schlaudeman was
well-known as an American football
nlayer in the southern part of the
state. He is 20 years old, and his
weight is 170i pounds. He comes from
Pasadena and is registered in the Stan
ford law school. "Rab" belongs to
he Phi Psi fraternity.
Thomas Leslie Wark
Les Wark, while the lightest man on
he squad, is one of the fastest, and may
>e used in the game at quarter. He oc

cupied one of the wing berths in the
rugby contests of 1916 and 1917. Les is
5 feet 7 inches tall, and tips the scales
at 148 pounds. He majors in geology,
is 24 years old, and lives in Long Beach.
He is a member of Beta Theta Pi fra
ternity.
Floyd Paul Campbell

strongest hopes in the hard fighting

cither at quarter or half and is one of
the most experienced American players
on the 1919 squad. He has 170 pounds

to hit the California line and is 23 years
old. He comes from Portland. Ore., and
is registered as a pre-legal student. He
is a member of Kappa Sigma fraternity
Montaville Dean Flowers
"Fat" Flowers is an asset to the Varsi
ty due to his weight and size. Flowers
weighs 250 pounds and is nearly 6 feet
tall, and is able to push right through the
opposing lines. He votes in Monrovia
and registers with the geology majors at
Stanford. He is 23 years old. Flowers
will fill one of the places on the line that
the Blue and Gold supporters will not
see the ball go through.
James McPherson Reynolds
Jimmy Reynolds is one of the fast
Cardinal halfbacks, but can be used at
quarter if necessary. He is light, weigh
ing only 158 pounds but is a hard man
to tackle. Jimmy is 22 years old and is
5 feet 8 inches in his stocking feet. He
registers at Stanford from Pomona and
majors in economics. He is a Theta
Delta Chi.
Frederick Lawson Adams
Fred Adams is one of the heaviest
ends on the coast. Although a new man
at the end position, he is holding up his
job unusually well. Adams is 19 years
of age and comes to Stanford from Sac
ramento where he was long a football
star. He is a member of the civil en
gineering department and claims Phi
Gamma Delta as his fraternity. The ends
have a big duty to perform tomorrow,
but Adams, with his 6 feet 1 inch and
his weight of 194 pounds will be on the
job every minute.
Alfred Preston Holt
"Pret" Holt, the sturdy ground
gainer of last year's S. A. T. C. foot
ball game with California, will bo
one of the Cardinal hopes at half.

Although small, Holt has IGO pounds
that will speak for itself when he goes
through the Bruin line. Pret came
down from Portland, Ore., to study
Economics at Stanford. He is 21
years old and makes the Chi Psi lodge
his campus residence.
Howard Franklin Campbell
"Cap" Campbell will be one of the
tackles that will have to work hard to
'iold the California line. Campbell is

then some, for be weighs 188 pounds and
stands 6 feet in height. He is 22 years
