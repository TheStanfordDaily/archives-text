# CARDINAL VARSITY WILL ENTER CONTEST WITH STRONG PERSONNEL
## 
### 
Stanford's Varsity eleven, which will
run on the field tomorrow, will be the
best of a squad of twenty-seven players.
Competition has been so keen for the po
sitions on the team that Coach Evarts has
refused to announce the line-up until the
last minute.
The men to start the game and those
going in during the contest, individually
and collectively, will exhibit perfect
specimens of what college men and espe
cially those who wear the Cardinal
| should be. The previous showing of the
! men during their preliminary games
does much credit to the individual play
ers and to the coach.
Coach Evans has worked an American
team out of a squad of men knowing
practically nothing about the game,
j However, most of the players have
played rugby at Stanford, and the out
come of tomorrow's game is being
watched with particular interest. It will
show the football experts just what good
coaching can do.
George Herman Bihlman
"Here" Bihlman will be another of
Coach Evans' hopes in the Stanford
line, where he may start as one of
1 the guards. Bihlman tips the scales
at an even 200 pounds which may

prove a difficulty for the Bears to
push over. Here played rugby several
years ago at Stanford, and is well up
on football tactics. He is an Entom
ology major at Stanford, and registers
from Live Oak. He is 24 years old,
and a member of Encina Club.
Robert Forsyth Pelouze
Rob Pelouze's speed must be watched
by the Berkeley team or they may find

the Cardinal shoving a touchdown over.
Pclouzc is a varsity track sprinter and
runs on the football field just as fast
Boh will start the game at end, where
his experience as a runner and training

in basketball will be brought into play.
He comes from Medford and is a law
student. He weighs 155 pounds and is
a Sigma Nu.
Richard Scull Pershing
Dick Pershing will be one of the men
used in the line to stop the plunging
Berkeley backfield. He is 19 years old,
and his 170 pounds is a valuable addi
tion to the total line weight. The coach
has been playing Pershing at tackle. In
size he is an ideal tackle, being 6 feet
tall. He comes from Los Angeles and
majors in Economics. He is a member
of Chi Psi fraternity.
Forrest Arthur Betts
"Red" Betts will fit in the line to
morrow at guard. Betts is one of those
men who have improved until he i:
guaranteed a chance to get into tin
game, although he has had no previ
ous experience in the game. He if
22 years old and majors in law. In
size, he is an ideal guard, standing
5 feet, 10 inches. He weighs 180
pounds, registers from Phoenix, Ariz ,
and is a member of Encina Club.
Cornelius Erwin Righter
"Swede" Righter will use his 186
pounds of bone and muscle as the center
of the Stanford bulwark which Evans is
hoping will be able to put a stop to the
hard-hitting Blue and Gold backfield.

"Swede" claims Campbell as his home
town and is 22 years of age. He is a
member of Encina Club and majors in
history. As the center and capta:n of
last season's basketball team, Righter was
the greatest point-maker for the Reds.
Edgar Reginald Caughey
Captain Reg Caughey, while a fast,
hard-hitting backfield man, probably will
start the game at the position of guard
because of the strength he will be able
to add to the line. As a skipper, Reg is
a man who is able to keep his squad in
the best of working condition. He is
one of the few four star Varsity men
in Stanford. Caughey weighs 186
pounds and is 26 years old. He comes
from Ukiah, and is a member of Encina
Club, and is studying law.
Karl Whitman Schlaudeman
"Rab" Schlaudeman is another fast
man who has been working for the
position of end. Schlaudeman was
well-known as an American football
nlayer in the southern part of the
state. He is 20 years old, and his
weight is 170i pounds. He comes from
Pasadena and is registered in the Stan
ford law school. "Rab" belongs to
he Phi Psi fraternity.
Thomas Leslie Wark
Les Wark, while the lightest man on
he squad, is one of the fastest, and may
>e used in the game at quarter. He oc

cupied one of the wing berths in the
rugby contests of 1916 and 1917. Les is
5 feet 7 inches tall, and tips the scales
at 148 pounds. He majors in geology,
is 24 years old, and lives in Long Beach.
He is a member of Beta Theta Pi fra
ternity.
Floyd Paul Campbell
Paul Campbell is one of Coach Evans'
strongest hopes in the hard fighting
Stanford backfield. He can be used
cither at quarter or half and is one of
the most experienced American players
on the 1919 squad. He has 170 pounds

to hit the California line and is 23 years
old. He comes from Portland. Ore., and
is registered as a pre-legal student. He
is a member of Kappa Sigma fraternity
Montaville Dean Flowers
"Fat" Flowers is an asset to the Varsi
ty due to his weight and size. Flowers
weighs 250 pounds and is nearly 6 feet
tall, and is able to push right through the
opposing lines. He votes in Monrovia
and registers with the geology majors at
Stanford. He is 23 years old. Flowers
will fill one of the places on the line that
the Blue and Gold supporters will not
see the ball go through.
James McPherson Reynolds
Jimmy Reynolds is one of the fast
Cardinal halfbacks, but can be used at
quarter if necessary. He is light, weigh
ing only 158 pounds but is a hard man
to tackle. Jimmy is 22 years old and is
5 feet 8 inches in his stocking feet. He
registers at Stanford from Pomona and
majors in economics. He is a Theta
Delta Chi.
Frederick Lawson Adams
Fred Adams is one of the heaviest
ends on the coast. Although a new man
at the end position, he is holding up his
job unusually well. Adams is 19 years
of age and comes to Stanford from Sac
ramento where he was long a football
star. He is a member of the civil en
gineering department and claims Phi
Gamma Delta as his fraternity. The ends
have a big duty to perform tomorrow,
but Adams, with his 6 feet 1 inch and
his weight of 194 pounds will be on the
job every minute.
Alfred Preston Holt
"Pret" Holt, the sturdy ground
gainer of last year's S. A. T. C. foot
ball game with California, will bo
one of the Cardinal hopes at half.

Although small, Holt has IGO pounds
that will speak for itself when he goes
through the Bruin line. Pret came
down from Portland, Ore., to study
Economics at Stanford. He is 21
years old and makes the Chi Psi lodge
his campus residence.
Howard Franklin Campbell
"Cap" Campbell will be one of the
tackles that will have to work hard to
'iold the California line. Campbell is
fast enough to perform his duty and
then some, for be weighs 188 pounds and
stands 6 feet in height. He is 22 years

to Get Into the Game


"Pret" Holt, Sturdy Halfback Who
Can Gain a Yard Against Any Line
old, majors in geology, and lives in
Modesto. He is a member of Encina
Club.
Fred Laman Bonney
Fred Bonney will more than likely
start the game at half back tomorrow
opposite Holt. Bonney has played a
splendid game all season in the back

field and his ability to execute either
end runs or line plunges and to re
ceive passes will probably get him
into the battle. Bonney is a varsity
basketball man and majors in law.
He is a member of Kappa Sigma
fraternity.
John Kenneth Lilly
Ken Lilly is one of the ten flat Varsi

ty men, and probably will be used at one
of the halves during a part of the game
on account of his speed. Due to in
juries, he has played very little in the
preliminary games of the season, so he
is being watched and classed by the Blue
and Gold supporters as a dark horse.
Ken has 170 pounds to his credit and is
5 feet 9 inches tall. Ashland, Ore.,
is his home town, from which he came
to Stanford to register in law. Lilly is
21 years old and is a member of Theta
Delta Chi.
Robert Lyman Templeton
"Dink" Templeton is relied upon to
add a few points to the Cardinal score
by his long punts and accurate conver
sions. Templeton is a man of consider-

able rugby experience, and his coolness
at fullback may be accountable for his
breaking loose with the ball through an

open field. "Dink" is 6 feet tall and
weighs 160 pounds. He is from Dow
ney and is a member of Encina Club.
After getting his degree at Stanford he
expects to return home to practice law.
David Nathan Levy
Levy may prove to be a player of
unusual value to the team, on account
of his ability to fit into either the line
or the backfield. He can be placed at
half or in the line as a guard. He
comes from Prercott, Ariz., and majors
here in chemistry. He weighs 183
pounds and is a member of Encina
Club.
Aubrey Arthur Curtice
Arthur Curtice will be one of those
men upon whose sholders so much
falls in the big classic. At his posi
tino of end, he will be largely res-

ponsible for stopping the California
plugging. Curtice has 177 pounds of
weight, and stads 5 feet, 8 inches in
height He is a Geology and Mining

major, and is a member of Delta Up
silon.
John Clarence Patrick
Jack Patrick is a second Templeton
when it comes to playing football. He
also has an educated toe, which may
prove useful in the fight against the
Blue and Gold. Playing half on the
S. A. T. C. team last year for Stanford,
Patrick, along with Holt, made all of
the Stanford advances. His combined
experience in both the American and
English games makes him a difficult man
for the opposing team to handle. Pat
rick is an entomology major, residing in
Palo Alto, and is a member of Delta
Upsilon. He weighs 176 pounds and is
20 years of age.
Robert Schlaudeman
Bob Shlaudeman will be held tomor
row as a utility qu?rterback. Shlaude
man is young in age, being only 19 years
old, but is more experienced in the Amer
ican game than a number of the men
on the squad. He weighs 160 pounds
and journeyed from Pasadena to enter
Stanford. He is a Delta Kappa Epsilon.
Daniel Brendan Carroll
Danny Carroll may give the bleachers
a treat tomorrow afternoon by showing
what an old rugby star can do in the
American game. Carroll hits the line
hard and will be difficult to stop if he
ever gets loose. He will start in the
game with his 170 pounds of weight at
halfback. He is 27 years of age and
registers in geology. He comes from
Australia and is a member of Sigma
Alpha Epsilon fraternity.
Charles Wesley Pallett
Pallett is another Cardinal hope that


Fred Bonney, Will Probably Play Op
posite Holt, at Haifback


"Dink" Templeton's Versatile Legs
May Win Another Stanford Victory


"Duke" Curtice, a Sure Bet at Any
Position
was used during the football game last
fall. Playing at center, he is one of the
most consistent fighters on the squad,
but lacks the weight which "Swede"
Righter has. Pallett is an economics
major who hails from Portland, Ore.,
and is 20 years of age, weighing 159
pounds. He belongs to the Beta Theta
Pi fraternity.
Dale Joseph Butt
Another man to help hold the Cali
fornia team will be Butt, who may be
played at guard during the game.
Butt is a good man in the line, al
though he is somewhat lighter than
the other men out for the position
of guard. He weighs 170 pounds and
is 23 years old. He comes from New
burg, Ore., and is registered in medi
cine. He is r. Phi Delta Theta.
Robert Henry Sticc
Stice is a transfer to Stanford, so
very little is known of his football
career, bue he has had considerable
experience in the American game back
east. He may get a chance to go into
the game in the line. Stice is an
Economics major and comes from Red
Bluff. He is a member of Phi Kappa
Sigma.
Irving Brooks Larsen
Larsen is another lineman that may
get into the game sometime tomorrow
afternoon. He is out for the position
of tackle and is fast in getting through
the line of the opponent. He resides
in Palo Alto and is majoring at Stan
ford in Chemistry.
Roy Irving Hill
Roy Hill may get a chance to work
in the Cardinal line. Although light
and having less experience than some
of the older men, Hill makes up his
share in pure fight. Roy registers at
Stanford from Medford, Ore., and is
here studying engineering. He is a
Beta Theta Pi.
