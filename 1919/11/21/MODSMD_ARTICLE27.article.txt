## THE 						WINNER DOUBTFUL California Has An Edge On Stanford Because of Experience

The main thing, after all, is that
Stanford and California are playing
in each other's back yard once again.
Just why the "Harvard and Yale
of the coast" ever ceased relations
is a mystery to most, and even those
intimately concerned therein have
reached the conclusion that the split
arose over trivialities —trivialities
hat never should have been permitted
to keep the two great schools apart.
But the battle around the council
tables has been brought to a truce,
and now Stanf( rd and California will
battle where they ought—on the foot
ball gridiron. May they continue so
to battle for generation after genera
tion.
Stanford has always had a fighting
team. Cardinal and "grit" are usu
ally synonomous. It is the Stanford
tradition to fight, and keep on fight
ing, and this spirit has on numerous
and tundry occasions turned what
looked like certain defeat into a ser
pentine for the red.
If Stanford puts up the sort of
fighting game that the Stanford-Cali
fornia fracas always brought forth in
the old days, there is hope for a Car
dinal victory.
Stanford will have to take advantage
of all the "breaks," however, to achieve
this ambition Man for man the Bears
are not eminently superior to the Car
dinal men. But team for team the
Blue and Gold has a decided edge.
The team with the fight and punch
is the team that will win.
