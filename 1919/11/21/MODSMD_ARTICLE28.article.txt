# FIGHTING SPIRIT MAY WIN GAME FOR REDS
## California May Be Slopped Like Kaiser's Trip to Paris 
### Frank P. Noon 
(Sports Writer San Francisco Call)
Herr Hohcnzollern, it will be remem
bered, expected to have some French
fried potatoes with his stein of beer and
frankfurters and sauerkraut at Maxim'*
in Paris—or was it the Tavern Royale on
the Boulevarde des Italiens ?—and Cali
fornia expects to defeat Stanford in a
battle for gridiron supremacy Saturday
afternoon on Stanford Field.
Some say the Blue and Gold gridmen
will outplay the Cardinal Varsity; some
say the Cardinal kickers will give the
Californian's a few pointers in "trick"
plays that they never knew before. On
"paper" it looks as if the Blue and Gold
Bruins have a shade on the Cardinal
eleven, in Saturday's game in what
should prove to be a ncver-to-bi-forgot
ten affair in the annals of football his
tory on the "farm."
If Stanford wins the gridiron classic
Saturday afternoon, football enthusiasts
and exponents of the pigskin kicking
jamc will in all probability have the
privilege of watching one of the best
exhibitions of football seen in this neck
of the woods in a blue moon.
If the Cardinal men play according to
the revised edition of Hoyle and live up
to their past performances this season,
California will merely be another victim
of the "machine" built up by Evans.
Many a team's hopes of the future hare
been spoiled by the Cardinal "outfit."
Will they upset Andy Smith's hopes on
Stanford Field Saturday afternoon?
The answer I will leave to the eleven
highly trained football warriors who
will wear the Cardinal colors on the
gridiron Saturday and fight like only
Stanford men can—for their Alma
Mater and the traditions set lip by the
Stanford gridmen of other years who
made football history on the "Farm."
