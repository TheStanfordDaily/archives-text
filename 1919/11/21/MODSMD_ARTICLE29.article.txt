# FORMER COACH WRITES OF STANFORD TEAMS
## Lanagan Reviews Seasons In Which He Directed 'Farm' Football 
### James Lanagan 
(American Football Coach 1903-05)
When the writer was appointed foot
ball coach in 1903, a council of war was
immediately called to try to find out
what was the matter with Stanford foot
ball. After a careful analysis of the
2-to-0 defeat of 1901 and the 16-to-0 de
feat of 1902, this council came to the
conclusion that the bottom of the trouble
lay in lack of discipline and in want of
thorough instruction in the fundamen
tals of the game. The men had not been
keeping training rules, and their system
of attack had been built up on flimsy
groundwork.
We all realized that with our green
material we could not expect to win in
1903. But we were determined that every
man on the squad should know the de
tails of the position that he played; that
the plays to be used against California
should be adapted to the special abili
ties of the men, and that, above all
things, we should not attempt more plays
than the team could execute with pre
cision. The result of the season's work
surprised all of us. The game was
held at Richmond Field in San Fran
cisco. California's team gained a tre
mendous amount of ground, but could
not score because they attempted to
carry the ball too far. A block kick
gave them their touchdown. Stanford
scored on a magnificent quarterback run
by Captain Bransbach, aided by George
Clark and Jack Sprott, left end and left
tackle, respectively, carried the ball six
ty yards to Stanford's only touchdown
Practically all of the men returned
to college in 1904, and the development
of this team was steady and satisfactory.
They defeated Nevada 17 to 0 Oregon
35 to 0, an exceptionally strong Califor
nia 18 to 0, and Colorado 33 to 0. The
principal features of the game with Cali
fornia were Hitmuller's splendid kicking,
which prevented Stanford from doubling
the score, and Chalmers' run of 75 yards
from the kick-off. After the post sea
son game against the University of Colo
rado at Denve th»- President of the
Boulder Club wrote to Treasurer Bar
rett of Stanford as follows:
"Without a dissenting voice, the ver
dict is that you have the best team that
ever played in Colorado; that the play
of every member of the team was clean
and sportsmanlike."
After this successful season we found
ourselves, in 1905, with only three vet
erans, but with a squad of men whose
enthusiasm and willingness to work had
never before been equalled. California
had a very strong team, well coached by
two Dartmouth men. This team came
down confident that it would christen the
new Stanford Field with a California
victory. They won the toss, chose to
receive the kick-off, and made the fatal
error of attempting to carry the ball
from their own twnty-yard line to a
touchdown. They did succeed in getting

sixty-five yards, but this advance was
the end of their offense. Stott, the
Stanford quarterback worked the ball
back to the center of the field, and then
called for a kick. From this time on.
Stanford was always one kick ahead of
California. Fin?llv, the expected hap
nened. The California quarterback
missed a prnt, and Molfino. the Stanford
center, fell on the ball on California's
twenty-yard line. Stanford then put on
full steam and forced the ball across
the California line for the first touch
down of the game. A short time after
this score. Snedigar, speediest of Cali
fornia's halfbacks, got away on a fake
kick and scored. Stanford's second
touchdown came as a result of Vander
voort's clever run of thirty-five yards
behind solid and precise interference.
I believe that the secret of the suc
cess of these three teams was attention
to the details of individual play, th
adaptation of offensive plays to the par
ticular ability of the men, and to an in
s:stcnce upon the perfect execution of
the plays used.
Some years after the 1905 game a very
great compliment was paid the team by
two old California players. One of them
said:
"The most disconcerting thing about
that team was its unity. Everybody
seemed to know exactly what everybody
else was going to do. There was no
talking amongst the men. They seemed
simply to have to look at one another
to understand."
The other man said:
"We really felt, when we went to
Stanford on that day, that we had to do
more than beat the Stanford team. We
felt that if we were going to win we
had to lick the whole community— team,
students and profs."
When there is in the atmosphere of a
university that intangible something
which makes itself felt by a student and
stranger alike, its teams will be well
nigh invincible.

and sportsmanlike."
After this successful season we found
ourselves, in 1905, with only three vet
erans, but with a squad of men whose
enthusiasm and willingness to work had
never before been equalled. California
had a very strong team, well coached by
two Dartmouth men. This team came
down confident that it would christen the
new Stanford Field with a California
victory. They won the toss, chose to
receive the kick-off, and made the fatal
error of attempting to carry the ball
from their own twnty-yard line to a
touchdown. They did succeed in getting

sixty-five yards, but this advance was
the end of their offense. Stott, the
Stanford quarterback worked the ball
back to the center of the field, and then
called for a kick. From this time on.
Stanford was always one kick ahead of
California. Fin?llv, the expected hap
nened. The California quarterback
missed a prnt, and Molfino. the Stanford
center, fell on the ball on California's
twenty-yard line. Stanford then put on
full steam and forced the ball across
the California line for the first touch
down of the game. A short time after
this score. Snedigar, speediest of Cali
fornia's halfbacks, got away on a fake
kick and scored. Stanford's second
touchdown came as a result of Vander
voort's clever run of thirty-five yards
behind solid and precise interference.
I believe that the secret of the suc
cess of these three teams was attention
to the details of individual play, th
adaptation of offensive plays to the par
ticular ability of the men, and to an in
s:stcnce upon the perfect execution of
the plays used.
Some years after the 1905 game a very
great compliment was paid the team by
two old California players. One of them
said:
"The most disconcerting thing about
that team was its unity. Everybody
seemed to know exactly what everybody
else was going to do. There was no
talking amongst the men. They seemed
simply to have to look at one another
to understand."
The other man said:
"We really felt, when we went to
Stanford on that day, that we had to do
more than beat the Stanford team. We
felt that if we were going to win we
had to lick the whole community— team,
students and profs."
When there is in the atmosphere of a
university that intangible something
which makes itself felt by a student and
stranger alike, its teams will be well
nigh invincible.
(American Football Coach 1903-05)
When the writer was appointed foot
ball coach in 1903, a council of war was
immediately called to try to find out
what was the matter with Stanford foot
ball. After a careful analysis of the
2-to-0 defeat of 1901 and the 16-to-0 de
feat of 1902, this council came to the
conclusion that the bottom of the trouble
lay in lack of discipline and in want of
thorough instruction in the fundamen
tals of the game. The men had not been
keeping training rules, and their system
of attack had been built up on flimsy
groundwork.
We all realized that with our green
material we could not expect to win in
1903. But we were determined that every
man on the squad should know the de
tails of the position that he played; that
the plays to be used against California
should be adapted to the special abili
ties of the men, and that, above all
things, we should not attempt more plays
than the team could execute with pre
cision. The result of the season's work
surprised all of us. The game was
held at Richmond Field in San Fran
cisco. California's team gained a tre
mendous amount of ground, but could
not score because they attempted to
carry the ball too far. A block kick
gave them their touchdown. Stanford
scored on a magnificent quarterback run
by Captain Bransbach, aided by George
Clark and Jack Sprott, left end and left
tackle, respectively, carried the ball six
ty yards to Stanford's only touchdown
Practically all of the men returned
to college in 1904, and the development
of this team was steady and satisfactory.
They defeated Nevada 17 to 0 Oregon
35 to 0, an exceptionally strong Califor
nia 18 to 0, and Colorado 33 to 0. The
principal features of the game with Cali
fornia were Hitmuller's splendid kicking,
which prevented Stanford from doubling
the score, and Chalmers' run of 75 yards
from the kick-off. After the post sea
son game against the University of Colo
rado at Denve th»- President of the
Boulder Club wrote to Treasurer Bar
rett of Stanford as follows:

(American Football Coach 1903-05)
When the writer was appointed foot
ball coach in 1903, a council of war was
immediately called to try to find out
what was the matter with Stanford foot
ball. After a careful analysis of the
2-to-0 defeat of 1901 and the 16-to-0 de
feat of 1902, this council came to the
conclusion that the bottom of the trouble
lay in lack of discipline and in want of
thorough instruction in the fundamen
tals of the game. The men had not been
keeping training rules, and their system
of attack had been built up on flimsy
groundwork.
We all realized that with our green
material we could not expect to win in
1903. But we were determined that every
man on the squad should know the de
tails of the position that he played; that
the plays to be used against California
should be adapted to the special abili
ties of the men, and that, above all
things, we should not attempt more plays
than the team could execute with pre
cision. The result of the season's work
surprised all of us. The game was
held at Richmond Field in San Fran
cisco. California's team gained a tre
mendous amount of ground, but could
not score because they attempted to
carry the ball too far. A block kick
gave them their touchdown. Stanford
scored on a magnificent quarterback run
by Captain Bransbach, aided by George
Clark and Jack Sprott, left end and left
tackle, respectively, carried the ball six
ty yards to Stanford's only touchdown
Practically all of the men returned
to college in 1904, and the development
of this team was steady and satisfactory.
They defeated Nevada 17 to 0 Oregon
35 to 0, an exceptionally strong Califor
nia 18 to 0, and Colorado 33 to 0. The
principal features of the game with Cali
fornia were Hitmuller's splendid kicking,
which prevented Stanford from doubling
the score, and Chalmers' run of 75 yards
from the kick-off. After the post sea
son game against the University of Colo
rado at Denve th»- President of the
Boulder Club wrote to Treasurer Bar
rett of Stanford as follows:
"Without a dissenting voice, the ver
dict is that you have the best team that
ever played in Colorado; that the play
of every member of the team was clean
and sportsmanlike."
After this successful season we found
ourselves, in 1905, with only three vet
erans, but with a squad of men whose
enthusiasm and willingness to work had
never before been equalled. California
had a very strong team, well coached by
two Dartmouth men. This team came
down confident that it would christen the
new Stanford Field with a California
victory. They won the toss, chose to
receive the kick-off, and made the fatal
error of attempting to carry the ball
from their own twnty-yard line to a
touchdown. They did succeed in getting

sixty-five yards, but this advance was
the end of their offense. Stott, the
Stanford quarterback worked the ball
back to the center of the field, and then
called for a kick. From this time on.
Stanford was always one kick ahead of
California. Fin?llv, the expected hap
nened. The California quarterback
missed a prnt, and Molfino. the Stanford
center, fell on the ball on California's
twenty-yard line. Stanford then put on
full steam and forced the ball across
the California line for the first touch
down of the game. A short time after
this score. Snedigar, speediest of Cali
fornia's halfbacks, got away on a fake
kick and scored. Stanford's second
touchdown came as a result of Vander
voort's clever run of thirty-five yards
behind solid and precise interference.
I believe that the secret of the suc
cess of these three teams was attention
to the details of individual play, th
adaptation of offensive plays to the par
ticular ability of the men, and to an in
s:stcnce upon the perfect execution of
the plays used.
Some years after the 1905 game a very
great compliment was paid the team by
two old California players. One of them
said:
"The most disconcerting thing about
that team was its unity. Everybody
seemed to know exactly what everybody
else was going to do. There was no
talking amongst the men. They seemed
simply to have to look at one another
to understand."
The other man said:
"We really felt, when we went to
Stanford on that day, that we had to do
more than beat the Stanford team. We
felt that if we were going to win we
had to lick the whole community— team,
students and profs."
When there is in the atmosphere of a
university that intangible something
which makes itself felt by a student and
stranger alike, its teams will be well
nigh invincible.
