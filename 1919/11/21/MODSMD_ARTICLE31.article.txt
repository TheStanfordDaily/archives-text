# STANFORD MAY SPRING SURPRISE IN CONTEST
## BOTH TEAMS ARE STRONG Gill Sport Writer Claims That Winner Is Hard to Choose 
### John J. Connolly

it's a perpetual joke tuis idea o
picking winners. It doesn t matte
what form of athletic promise you.

it's a Stanford-California football game
or a game of hide and go-seek. One

are worse than the two. So you see
what chance a guy is taking when he
predicts.
Ihey tell a yprn in sporting
about the way eastern lignt critict
place their bets. The U. C. boys wih
wait until Jim Corbett or Bob Edgreu
pick their winner and then lay thei.
money on the opposite guy whether he
is a fighter, ball player or golfer. So
the poor sports scribe who sometime?
is forced to stick his foot out the
window to keep the wolf away from
the door, doesn't relish the idea of
being placed, in such funny places as
our friend Jim and Bob.
The element of luck, more flagrant
in football than any other sport, has
to be considered. Suppose Umpty
lumpty breaks his leg. Or another
4 ears loose with his hoof and comes
up lame. These and a few other
contingencies always have to be ex
nected even though they are remote
possibilities.
When the Colgate eleven flapped be
fore the savage attack of Syracuse
7 ast Saturday, the followers of the
nigskin pastime threw back their ea v s
'n amazement. And when Princeton
wiggled its way to a tie game with
Harvard, the Tiger rooters went wild
So just picture ihe frenzy and excite
ment. that must have bobbed up when
Princeton swept past Yale in the final
quarter of the game and carried off
honors of the day. All these instances
are just emoted for the purpose of
showing the upsets. Either Yale or
Harvard were conceded to be cinches
to whip Princeton. And whoever en
tertained the idea that Svracuse
practically unheard of, would have
trimmed Colgate, considered to be the
foremost eastern chice to represent
the east in the Pasadena game between
the East vs. West on New Year's Day.
And so it may be Saturday when
the red-vested Cardinal warriors tackle
California in the classic event of the
year.
I've talked with numerous old grads.
Some were captains of teams in years
gone by. Others were graduate man
agers and keen students of football.
All agree to one point—it'll be a tough
game. The California alumnus natur
ally announces to the world that a
victory is certain. Cardinal graduates
are just the same. They can't see
how the Farm Boys can lose when
Templeton starts kicking and with the
strong line and the great defense work
of the Stanford lads.
California bases its hope for vic
tory on its experience. They can't
see Templeton's kicking doing any
good against its superior backfield.
So just figure it out this way. The
game is going to be a pippin. Stan
ford will fight till the last whistle
blows. California has to live up to
advance press notices. She's being
tabbed a winner.
What do 1 say? Well at 5:30 Sat
urday evening, November 22, I'm go
ing start laying my bets. And they'll
be just as heavy as the other guy
wants 'em.
Let 'er start.

are just emoted for the purpose of
showing the upsets. Either Yale or
Harvard were conceded to be cinches
to whip Princeton. And whoever en
tertained the idea that Svracuse
practically unheard of, would have
trimmed Colgate, considered to be the
foremost eastern chice to represent
the east in the Pasadena game between
the East vs. West on New Year's Day.
And so it may be Saturday when
the red-vested Cardinal warriors tackle
California in the classic event of the
year.
I've talked with numerous old grads.
Some were captains of teams in years
gone by. Others were graduate man
agers and keen students of football.
All agree to one point—it'll be a tough
game. The California alumnus natur
ally announces to the world that a
victory is certain. Cardinal graduates
are just the same. They can't see
how the Farm Boys can lose when
Templeton starts kicking and with the
strong line and the great defense work
of the Stanford lads.
California bases its hope for vic
tory on its experience. They can't
see Templeton's kicking doing any
good against its superior backfield.
So just figure it out this way. The
game is going to be a pippin. Stan
ford will fight till the last whistle
blows. California has to live up to
advance press notices. She's being
tabbed a winner.

be just as heavy as the other guy
