# STANFORD FIGHT MAY DEFEAT CALIFORNIA
## BREAKS WILL BE FACTOR Chronicle Writer Thinks California Varsity Team Is Not In the Best Shape 
### "Husky" Hall 
(Sports Writer, S. F. Chronicle) !
With the breaks in its favor, Stanford
Varsity's fighting spirit may win the Big
Game for the Cardinal. Strong empha
sis on the "may," because Old Man Dope,!
although weakening, still points to the
California win indicated at the start of
the season. Coach Evans is to be con
gratulated on the way his men have
taken to the American game; he seems
to have performed marvels already, and
the Stanford gr?.ds are praying that he
will come through.
One thing that will help the Cardi
nals in the impending gridiron battle
is their condition as they are just round
ing into top form, while the Bears
showed in the U. S. C. game that they
had passed this stage and might be go
ing a bit stale. Rest assured, however,
that Andy Smith and Charley Volz will
do their best to keep wearers of the Blue
and Gold from such a fate.
So-called straight football will not win
the game for Stanford. The Varsity
must open up its bag of tricks and un
cover some real surprises in aerial work
and other open plays if they want even
a look-in on the scoring. The late, la
mented freshman debacle will have a
healthful effect on the Stanford squad,
while it seems already to be giving the
Bears a slight attack of overconfidence.
Stanford's Varsity "dark horses" should
come through strong and with a fight
that will take the Bruins' breath away
from them.
If the Stanford line can hold and the
backs uncover some of the speed stuff
they have in them, Stanford will score,
even if they do not win. Let a fast man
get half way through the U. C. defense
and he is pretty sure to keep on going'
for a score; at least that's the way things
have gone in most of the preliminaries.
Stanford has the fast men, hence it is
safe to predict at least one probable Stan
ford touchdown.
Leave it to Dink to convert the same,
and also to put over a field goal or two
if he gets the chance, and, it might be j
added, he will undoubtedly get the,
Taking everything into conclusion, j
California still appears to have about a
two-touchdown advantage, according to
O. M. Dope but whether the score will
resemble 14 to 3 or 21 to 7 or something
yet different at the dose of the game
not even an Archie Rice can foretell.
Should Stanford fool O. M. D. and win,
it will be the greatest victory ever
achieved by the Cardinal, or, for that
matter, by any football team.
Here's hoping, for the writer would
cheerfully give his best union-alls if he
could chronicle a Stanford victory in
next Sunday morning's paper.

With the breaks in its favor, Stanford
Varsity's fighting spirit may win the Big
Game for the Cardinal. Strong empha
sis on the "may," because Old Man Dope,!
although weakening, still points to the
California win indicated at the start of
the season. Coach Evans is to be con
gratulated on the way his men have
taken to the American game; he seems
to have performed marvels already, and
the Stanford gr?.ds are praying that he
will come through.
One thing that will help the Cardi
nals in the impending gridiron battle
is their condition as they are just round
ing into top form, while the Bears
showed in the U. S. C. game that they
had passed this stage and might be go
ing a bit stale. Rest assured, however,
that Andy Smith and Charley Volz will
do their best to keep wearers of the Blue
and Gold from such a fate.
So-called straight football will not win
the game for Stanford. The Varsity
must open up its bag of tricks and un
cover some real surprises in aerial work
and other open plays if they want even
a look-in on the scoring. The late, la
mented freshman debacle will have a
healthful effect on the Stanford squad,
while it seems already to be giving the
Bears a slight attack of overconfidence.
Stanford's Varsity "dark horses" should
come through strong and with a fight
that will take the Bruins' breath away
from them.
If the Stanford line can hold and the
backs uncover some of the speed stuff
they have in them, Stanford will score,
