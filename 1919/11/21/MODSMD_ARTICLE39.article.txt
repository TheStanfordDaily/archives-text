# POSSIBILITIES OF BRUIN VARSITY ARE GIVEN BY U.C. MAN

Witli tlie arrival of the final week
before the Big Game the attitude of
the California Campus has altered
from one of over-confidence which
prevailed early in the season to one
of determined support. While the
general belief in th team Is strong it
is a saner confidence Calflornia hopes
to win but does not expect a big
score. A fight from beginning to end
is what Is looked for and a victory
by one point, will satisfy supremely
the most ardent supporter of the Blue
and Gold.
The wholesome respect which has
developed on the California Campus
for the Cardinal team is due largely
to the continued Improvement shown
since O.-egon Aggies met defeat and
will go a long way toward curbing
y extravagant confidence which
may be expressed in Berkeley hopes.
Who will line up on the Stanford
field when the whistle blows next Sat
urday to uphold the Blue and Gold is
still a matter of conjecture. However,
the line will be substantially the same
as that which played against Oregon
two weeks ago with the possible ex
ception of a returned cripple and the
backfield Is so uncertain as to make
no predictions useless. Four will be
chosen to start from a possible seven
who are now working. The others
will, in all probability play at one
time on another during the game.
The score will probably be close.
California hopes to win but realizes
ibnt it will be an uphill flht. Enthusi
asm on the campus Is growing day
by day and one thing Is sure, the team
which represents the Blue and Gold
will be one which will do honor to
the colors, and will be backed by the
University to a man.
