# DECIDING FACTOR IN BIG GAME WILL BE LUCKY BREAKS

About the only reliable prediction that
can be made about tomorrow's battle is
that it will be "some game." California
undoubtedly has the edge from all the
dope, and on preliminary season per
formances. Stanford on the other hand
has just gotten into her stride and has a
momentum that will carry her into the
point column. The game will look lite
an exhibition of the old physics law,
"when an irresistible force meets an im
movable object."
Of the two teams, California is the
stronger in team work. This means tre
mendous offensive power that should net
scores from the first whistle. Though
Washington State showed that Califor
nia's line smashes are not necessarily ir
resistible, it is rather optimistic to con
sider the Stanford line the equal of thai
of the Nortlieners, and I look to see
California go through it by sheer drive.
That solves California's scores. Can
Stanford score, too- Assuredly. And
by the merits of the individuals in the
backficld, too. The line will create the
opportunities to advance the ball, bul
the fast-starting, hard-hitting backs wiD
be responsible for the gains on their own
talents.
Figuring both sides to score, and dis
counting the possibilities of a white
1 wash, such as California received in its
first attempt at American football, the
problem resolves itself into which side
will win by scoring oftenest. That de
pends on the breaks of the game. Ii
locks to me like the winner will be the
' team with the most luck.
