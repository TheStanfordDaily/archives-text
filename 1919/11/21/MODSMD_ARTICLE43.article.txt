"During the early part of the season a
large number of the players were put
on the sick list from injuries received in
scrimmagcs until it looked as though
there would he a team of substitutes
playing in the Big Game. At the pres
- time we are able *o state with a good
deal of confidence, that the men will go
into their biggest game in a fine physi
cal condition and fit to put tip a battle
worthy of men, their Alma Mater, and
a coach in whom we place the great
est confidence. 1 '
