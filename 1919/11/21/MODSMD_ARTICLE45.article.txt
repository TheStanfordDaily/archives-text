# Seat Sale For Game Is Largest In History
## 
### 
The seat sale for the Big Game is
the largest in history, according to
reports. Never before, has the at
tendance to the annual big game, be
tween California and Stanfcrd, called
for the building of new bleachers.
This year it has been necessary for
six additional rows of seats to be built
around the field.
All seats were sold to students and
alumni of the two colleges. First
choice was given to the students and
then to alumni. Shortly after the sale
was put on California's business man
ager reported he was turning away
applications for alumni seats. There
was a repetition of this on the "Farm."
No general sale was made to the pub
lic.
seating capacity of the regular
bleachers is about 17000 and with the
additional seats it will make it pos
sible for about 25,000 people to see
the game. There is no doubt but that
every seat will be filled.
