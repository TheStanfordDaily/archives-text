# CAUGHEY PREDICTS STANFORD VICTORY OVER CALIFORNIA
## 
### 
"The Big Game is back. All oTer
California ancj the Weat alumni and
the public are rejoicing in this fact.
Ten years from now the result of
this big gaihe will probably be for
gotten by all save a few of the 'best
of us.' That is as it should be as far
as getting the k universities to
gether is concerned. On the 'Farm',
however, our chief worry is over the
result of Saturday's game and that
alone. Future games or relations have
no interest whatsoever. California is
afraid of the Stanford spirit and right
ly so but where they underestimate
is to think that is all we have. We
are going into that game knowing
more football than any university ever
knew in its first year. We do not
consider ourselves a great team and
thus handicapped. We are going into
the game with the traditional Stanford
fight, and a knowledge of the game,
and will win the game with those two
things is every player will only do
as he has been taught.
I sincerely believe that they will do
this and once again the Cardinal will
wave supreme over the Golden Bear."
CAPTAIN "REG" CAUGHEY
