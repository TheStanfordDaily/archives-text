# STANFORD AND U.C. RELATIONS ENDED SAYS WILBUR
## INVASION RESULTS IN THE TERMINATION Agreements Causes Automatic Breakâ€”May Last for Year 
### 
INTER-COLLEGIATE relations be
tween Stanford and the University of
California automatically came to an end
and now hang in the balance as a result
of the invasion of the California campus
by members of the Stanford student
body, last Wednesday night. The initia
tive as to the future must come from
California. Such, in a word, is the
content of a letter sent today by Presi
dent Ray Lyman Wilbur to Dr. T. M.
Williams, chairman of the Board of
Athletic Control of Stanford.
The letter states that the Associated
Student Body of Stanford has taken the
responsibility for the invasion upon its
shoulders and as a result athletic rela
tions were terminated under the agree
ment between the two universities by
which they had been previously resumed.
The letter from President Wilbur to
Dr. Williams follows:
Permit me to call to your attention
the fact that athletic inter-coiiegiate re
lations between the University of Cali
fornia and Stanford are now at an end,
because the Associated Students have
accepted responsibility for the recent in
vasion of the University of California
campus.
You will remember that in the corre
spondence between President Wheeler
and myself, which brought about a re
sumption of inter-collegiate football, it
was agreed "that the student bodies of
the University of California and of
Stanford would refrain from any 'inva
sion' of the campus of the other at any
time. Such violation of either campus
will lead to immediate cessation of inter
collegiate relations." There is an inde
terminate factor in this agreement, par
ticularly as to the length of period for
which inter-collegiate relations are to
cease. 1 assume that a reasonable period
would be one year. 1 assume also that,
since we are entirely in the wrong in
this whole problem, we shall have to
await the initiative of the University of
California as to the future.
Will you be kind enough to bring this
matter up for discussion in the .board
of Athletic Control? i shall be glad to
have a recommendation from the board
in case it sees any way in which action
can be taken.
112 am sending a copy of this letter to
the members of the Academic Commit
tee at the University of California, who
are carrying on the functions of the
president's office.
This means that no athletic competi
tion can take place between tne two
universities until intercollegiate "athletic
relations are again formally entered into.
The responsibility for this state of af
fairs rests wholly upon the members of
the student body who invaded the Cali
fornia campus.
What effect the resolution disavowing
the invasion, which was passed unani
mously by the student body at the Rally
Thursday night, will have on the situa
tion is not known. The resolution has
been placed before the proper authori
ties at California.
The entire matter, according to Presi- i
dent Wilbur's letter, rests in the hands
of the University of California. It is
expected that some action will be taken
immediately.

the student body who invaded the Cali
fornia campus.
What effect the resolution disavowing
the invasion, which was passed unani
mously by the student body at the Rally
Thursday night, will have on the situa
tion is not known. The resolution has
been placed before the proper authori
ties at California.
The entire matter, according to Presi- i
dent Wilbur's letter, rests in the hands
of the University of California. It is
expected that some action will be taken
immediately.
INTER-COLLEGIATE relations be
tween Stanford and the University of
California automatically came to an end
and now hang in the balance as a result
of the invasion of the California campus
by members of the Stanford student
body, last Wednesday night. The initia
tive as to the future must come from
California. Such, in a word, is the
content of a letter sent today by Presi
dent Ray Lyman Wilbur to Dr. T. M.
Williams, chairman of the Board of
Athletic Control of Stanford.
The letter states that the Associated
Student Body of Stanford has taken the
responsibility for the invasion upon its
shoulders and as a result athletic rela
tions were terminated under the agree
ment between the two universities by
which they had been previously resumed.
The letter from President Wilbur to
Dr. Williams follows:
Permit me to call to your attention
the fact that athletic inter-coiiegiate re
lations between the University of Cali
fornia and Stanford are now at an end,
because the Associated Students have
accepted responsibility for the recent in
vasion of the University of California
campus.
You will remember that in the corre
spondence between President Wheeler
and myself, which brought about a re
sumption of inter-collegiate football, it
was agreed "that the student bodies of
the University of California and of
Stanford would refrain from any 'inva
sion' of the campus of the other at any
time. Such violation of either campus
will lead to immediate cessation of inter
collegiate relations." There is an inde
terminate factor in this agreement, par
ticularly as to the length of period for
which inter-collegiate relations are to
cease. 1 assume that a reasonable period
would be one year. 1 assume also that,
since we are entirely in the wrong in
this whole problem, we shall have to
await the initiative of the University of
California as to the future.
Will you be kind enough to bring this
matter up for discussion in the .board
of Athletic Control? i shall be glad to
have a recommendation from the board
in case it sees any way in which action
can be taken.
112 am sending a copy of this letter to
the members of the Academic Commit
tee at the University of California, who
are carrying on the functions of the
president's office.
This means that no athletic competi
tion can take place between tne two
universities until intercollegiate "athletic
relations are again formally entered into.
The responsibility for this state of af
fairs rests wholly upon the members of
the student body who invaded the Cali
fornia campus.
