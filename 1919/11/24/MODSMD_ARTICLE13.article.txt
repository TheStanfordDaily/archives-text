# "HAIL, STANFORD, HAIL!"
## 
### 
THE BIG GAME is over, and the Blue and Gold are victors, but only on the
scoreboard. Stanford's varsity and Coach "Bob" Evans achieved a splen
did triumph on Saturday, and every Stanford student, alumnus, faculty mem
ber and friend is proud. Who among us doubts but that Stanford could
have won that game with bare minutes to play? Who doubts but that the
Cardinal team outplayed their rivals in a majority of departments of the
game, and who among us would not do anything in our power for our team?
Critics of the season had expressed it as their opinion that the Cardinal
would be outclassed. Newspapermen had voted the Blue and Gold a win by
at least three touchdowns, and now it is reported that the coach of the Cali
fornia team admits that luck alone saved his men from defeat. No one could
have witnessed the wonderful "comeback" of Stanford in the last quarter
of the Big Game without feeling a thrill. The showing was typical of that
remarkable spirit of which we boast. The Stanford fighting spirit continues
to dominate our athletics, and it was with a distinct sense of pride that we
sang "Hail, Stanford, Hail," last Saturday.
The Big Game is over, but not the season. Stanford has a future in
intercollegiate football this season that may yet lead us to a championship.
The team leaves on Wednesday for Los Angeles where they will meet the
University of Southern California. If Stanford succeeds in this Thanksgiving
game, and improves with the strides shown at present, we think the Cardinal
should be our Western contender. Stanford demonstrated her ability last
Saturday, and when the victor of the East is brought out to Pasadena during
the Christmas Holidays, Stanford should be its opponent.
