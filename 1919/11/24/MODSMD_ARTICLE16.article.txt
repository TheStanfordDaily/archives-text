# Honors In Women's Hockey Team Are Evenly Divided
## 
### 
Badly beaten by the University of Cal
ifornia team in the first game, but ral
lying to a decisive victory in the second
game, Stanford women's inter-class
hockey teams left the field Saturday
morning with the honors about even.
From the first minute of play in the
Stanford Seniors versus the California
Seniors game, it was evident that the
Cardinal team was outclassed in team
work and individual ability. The first
half ended with the score 6 to 0 in the
visitors' favor; and the play in the sec
ond half was even worse, resulting in
a score of 13 to 0 for the California
team. Only one goal was made, and that
was at the end of the first half, a bare
second after the whistle had blown. The
California backs were the stars of the
game, and never let a drive escape them.
Doris Hyer, captain, and Holly Roberts
strengthened the Stanford defense.
But the Sophomore match told a dif
ferent story, and this time it was Stan
ford which had the advantage from start
to finish. During the first few minutes
of play, Myra Waterman, captain, made
two goals, and though California put
up a good game and fought hard, the
final score was 7 to 3, in Stanford's
favor. Both games were refereed by
Miss Louise Patterson of California.
According to the coaches this is the
first time that Stanford has played inter
class inter-collegiate games, always hav
ing played only varsity games in hockey.
This, coupled with the fact that the Cal
ifornia teams had had more practice,
were equipped better, and were a some
what heavier team, accounts for the
crushing victory of the first game. Both
sides fought hard in both games, and
played good hockey.
