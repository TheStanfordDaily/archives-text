### 
The Olympic Club water polo team
won from the Stanford team in a close
game by a score of 4 to 2 in the Encina
pool Saturday afternoon. From the
spectator's view this was the best game
of the season, filled with exciting plays
and clever passing. The entire Stanford
seven played top-notch polo, but were
only beaten because of the superior ex
perience of the victors. Ankele's work
at goal deserves much credit, for he al
lowed only four shots to get by him out
of nineteen attempts.

the Stanford pool on December 6. Coach
Rrandsten feels certain of a victory if
tlie men continue the present brand of
playing.
