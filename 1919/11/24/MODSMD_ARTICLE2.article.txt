# Ram's Head Show Ends Big Game Day
## Kegley, Reynolds, Whealton Present Musical Feature 
### 
If the Football Show, presented by
the Ram's Head Society in the Assem
bly Hall last Saturday night was to be
given over again, the first thing to say
of it would be the customary "Don't
fail to see it." Snappy vaudeville with
a wide variety of acts marked the Ram's
1 lead production and placed it far above
the common level of "local talent" per
formances.
Although the star position on the bill
was not given the team of Reynolds,
Kegley, and Wheaton, first mention must
be given their act because of its clever
ness and originality. The double piano
feature that Reynolds and Kegley fur
nished was a feat of musical acrobatics
that could have earned them a place on
any professional program. Whealton's
clear tenor voice gave a very able inter
pretation of the new songs in his rep
ertoire.
A certain Mr. Schindler, who did the
heavy work in the frivolous Follies
Revue, was the "find" of the evening, if
such a term can be used in stage par
lance. This newcomer to campus dra
matics sings popular melodies, filling
them with meaning through the medium
of his lyrical voice. Miss Elizabeth Pat-
ton, who held down two positions on the
program in "Peppery Patter" and in the
Revue, charmed the audience with her
lively personality.
Perhaps the longest and loudest ap
nlause was earned by Miss Dorothy
Tohnson in her interpretive dance of
"Patches." Its success lay in the gayety
and spirit that permeated it. In regards
to Mie "Follies" chorus, it would be no
exaggeration to say that with a little
more training they could share the hon
ors with Ziecrfield's originals.
Other numbers on the program includ
ed Jack Cuddy, a rope-skipper of merit,
and Leland Pickering, whose monologues
were the fun hits of the show. A re
fined jazz protrram was put on by Grant
Corby, Don Tlutton. Sterling Clark, and
Jack Kegley. Russell Sewell accom
panied Miss Patton in the "Peppery
Patter" act with some original songs
