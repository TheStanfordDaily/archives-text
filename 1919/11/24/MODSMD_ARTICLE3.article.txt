# WINGED "0" DEFEATS STANFORD SWIMMERS
## 
### 
Stanford was defeated by the Olympic
Club in a fast swimming meet held in
the Encina pool Saturday afternoon by
the score of 22 to 35. Although the
clubmen won by 13 points, the results of
every race were extremely close, and in
Ihe case of the relay was decided by
inches. In the 50-yard event, it was al
most impossible to distinguish the win
ner, so evenly did the men swim.
Goddard won the only tirst place for
the Stanford team when he coppcd the
honors for diving. He exhibited ex
ceptional form and outstripped the other
contestants by a margin of 20 points.
Mills swam a strong race in the 220,
but was beaten in the last few yards.
