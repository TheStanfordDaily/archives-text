## Final Gun Snatches Win From Fighting Cardinals 
### E.E. Crowe, '21 
TANFOkd'S lighting varsiiy football
team went down to defeat Saturday
at the hands of the University of Cali
fornia eleven by the score of 14 to
10, but it is a defeat that is virtually
a triumph. Playing their first season
of American football, the Stanford
men fought the Blue and Gold players
off their feet in the last quarter, and
the timer's gun saved the Blue and
Gold from another touchdown and the
loss of the Big Game. The perform
ance of the Stanford men Saturday is
a credit to their University, their
Coach and to themselves.
"Pret" Holt Stars
An interesting fact about the score
of the game is that in the first year
of American football between Cali
fornia and Stanford in 1892, the Cardi
nal team won by the score of 14 to
10, and on the resumption of American
football relations in 1919, California
turned the tables by the same score.
In dealing out the individual glory
for the game, Coach Evans gives
"Pret" Holt first place without ques
tion. Holt played a perfect game both
offensive and defensive and was the
most feared of the Cardinal backs.
Next to Holt comes "Swede" Righter,
who played a strong game in the line
at all times. Adams played a good
game also in the line. In the back
field Evans gives credit to all of the
backs. Bonney, Patrick, Campbell,
Wark, Shlaudeman and Templeton all
put up great exhibitions. Templeton
in particular came through with the
first Cardinal score by drop-kicking
a field goal from the 45-yard line in
the early part of the first quarter.
Templeton also punted in great form,
although according to Evans, "Dink"
is good for 30 yards more on each of
his punts. He has been instructed to
hold the length of his kicks down in
order to give the ends a chance to
nail the receiver, and to prevent him
from getting a good start in running
the ball back.
Stanford Fight Evident
As had been prophesied the Stanford
fighting spirit was a big factor in the
Cardinal showing and during the last

fem minutes of the game the inexperi
enced players swept their experienced
opponents off their feet by sheer fight.
The breaks went against Stanford at
at this point and the Blue and Gold
came out victorious.
California won the toss and Boucher
kicked off. Adams received the ball
for Stanford and after he was downed,
the Stanford backs took the ball up
the field, and when the 45-yard line
was reached, "Dink" Templeton drop
ped back, swung his famous right
foot and placed a field goal between
the California goal posts for three
points.
Sprott came right back for Cali
fornia by finding a hole in the Cardi
nal line for 25 yards. "Dummy"
Wells and Deeds made substantial
gains and then the Stanford line held
and California lost the ball on downs.
Templeton kicked and Deeds ran the
ball back 15 yards. At this point,
Sprott decided to give his backs a
rest and switched to an open field
game. Three forward passes were at
tempted in succession, but the Cardi
nal backs had each eligible man on
the California team marked and the
passes failed.
Caughy Breaks Through
Sprott then gave the ball to Brooks
and the Blue and Gold skipper made
two yards around right end. Sprott
took the pigskin on next try and
was thrown for a two-yard loss. Sprott
then attempted another forward pass
but Captain Caughey broke through
and smeared him. Stanford took the
ball and Holt started things going by
annexing 15 yards. The quarter closed
with Stanford leading 3 to 0.
Campbell started the attack in the
second quarter by taking the ball for
a one-yard gain. Bonney made four
and Templeton booted. The Stanford
ends were blocked and Deeds ran in
ten yards before he was stopped. Rowe
went in for Captain Brooks at this
point and made one yard around left
end.
Wells Scores
California kicked and on the first
play Bihlman fumbled on the Stanford
40-yard line. The Pears thon started

an attack on the Stanford line with
all their force. Deeds climled through
for seven yards and Wells found a
spot good for 13 more. The next play
Wells made four yards and on his
third try he plunged across the Stan
ford line for a touchdown. Cline con
verted, making the score 7 to 3. The
half ended after Holt had made two
gains for 12 and 7 yards respectively
after the kick-off.
The Stanford line held the Bruin
attack at the opening of the third
quarter and Sprott kicked 43 yards.
Stanford took the ball and after a
few attempts at the line, Templeton
kicked. Deeds made 12 yards through
center and gains by Wells, Sprott and
Rowe took the play down to the Stan
ford line and Wells went ov«r around
right end for his second touchdown
and Cline converted again.
Wells slipped for a minute in this
quarter and fumbled, giving Stanford
the ball on the 30-yard line. Temple
ton kicked immediately and Pelouze
dumped Deeds in his tracks. Wells
came back at this point and broke
through the line for 45 yards.
California attempted another lor
ward pass in the fourth quarter but
Adams broke through and tackled
Rowe as he was about to pass. Cali
fornia lost 10 yards on this play. Pat
rick went in for Carroll, and with
the ball in Stanford's hands, a march
up the field was begun with Patrick
and Holt making repeated gains
through the fast weakening California
line. Majors, the reputed start in the
line was knocked down easily in these
plays and the red-shirted backs found
no trouble on his side of the line.
Cramner on the opposite side of center
proved a harder man to get past than
Majors.
Pelouze took the ball for 15 yards
around the California right end and
then Evans uncorked a farward pass
ing game that swept Andy Smith's
men off their feet. Patrick took a pass
for G yards and a few seconds later
Adams caught another one and raced
across for a touchdown." Templeton
converted, making the count 14 to 10.
After the kick-off Sprott was forced
to kick, and the Stanford eleven com
menced its march up the field again.
Patrick and Holt made their yards
easily through the Bruin line and two
forward passes brought the play up
to the Blue and Gold five-yard line.
Here the California line stiffened
and Patrick was unable to get through.
With the timer ready to fire his gun,
a forward pass was attempted across
the goal line and failed as the timer
ended the game.

TANFOkd'S lighting varsiiy football
team went down to defeat Saturday
at the hands of the University of Cali
fornia eleven by the score of 14 to
10, but it is a defeat that is virtually
a triumph. Playing their first season
of American football, the Stanford
men fought the Blue and Gold players
off their feet in the last quarter, and
the timer's gun saved the Blue and
Gold from another touchdown and the
loss of the Big Game. The perform
ance of the Stanford men Saturday is
a credit to their University, their
Coach and to themselves.
"Pret" Holt Stars
An interesting fact about the score
of the game is that in the first year
of American football between Cali
fornia and Stanford in 1892, the Cardi
nal team won by the score of 14 to
10, and on the resumption of American
football relations in 1919, California
turned the tables by the same score.
In dealing out the individual glory
for the game, Coach Evans gives
"Pret" Holt first place without ques
tion. Holt played a perfect game both
offensive and defensive and was the
most feared of the Cardinal backs.
Next to Holt comes "Swede" Righter,
who played a strong game in the line
at all times. Adams played a good
game also in the line. In the back
field Evans gives credit to all of the
backs. Bonney, Patrick, Campbell,
Wark, Shlaudeman and Templeton all
put up great exhibitions. Templeton
in particular came through with the
first Cardinal score by drop-kicking
a field goal from the 45-yard line in
the early part of the first quarter.
Templeton also punted in great form,
although according to Evans, "Dink"
is good for 30 yards more on each of
his punts. He has been instructed to
hold the length of his kicks down in
order to give the ends a chance to
nail the receiver, and to prevent him
from getting a good start in running
the ball back.
Stanford Fight Evident
As had been prophesied the Stanford
fighting spirit was a big factor in the
Cardinal showing and during the last

fem minutes of the game the inexperi
enced players swept their experienced
opponents off their feet by sheer fight.
The breaks went against Stanford at
at this point and the Blue and Gold
came out victorious.
California won the toss and Boucher
kicked off. Adams received the ball
for Stanford and after he was downed,
the Stanford backs took the ball up
the field, and when the 45-yard line
was reached, "Dink" Templeton drop
ped back, swung his famous right
foot and placed a field goal between
the California goal posts for three
points.
Sprott came right back for Cali
fornia by finding a hole in the Cardi
nal line for 25 yards. "Dummy"
Wells and Deeds made substantial
gains and then the Stanford line held
and California lost the ball on downs.
Templeton kicked and Deeds ran the
ball back 15 yards. At this point,
Sprott decided to give his backs a
rest and switched to an open field
game. Three forward passes were at
tempted in succession, but the Cardi
nal backs had each eligible man on
the California team marked and the
passes failed.
Caughy Breaks Through
Sprott then gave the ball to Brooks
and the Blue and Gold skipper made
two yards around right end. Sprott
took the pigskin on next try and
was thrown for a two-yard loss. Sprott
then attempted another forward pass
but Captain Caughey broke through
and smeared him. Stanford took the
ball and Holt started things going by
annexing 15 yards. The quarter closed
with Stanford leading 3 to 0.
Campbell started the attack in the
second quarter by taking the ball for
a one-yard gain. Bonney made four
and Templeton booted. The Stanford
ends were blocked and Deeds ran in
ten yards before he was stopped. Rowe
went in for Captain Brooks at this
point and made one yard around left
end.
Wells Scores
California kicked and on the first
play Bihlman fumbled on the Stanford
40-yard line. The Pears thon started

an attack on the Stanford line with
all their force. Deeds climled through
for seven yards and Wells found a
spot good for 13 more. The next play
Wells made four yards and on his
third try he plunged across the Stan
ford line for a touchdown. Cline con
verted, making the score 7 to 3. The
half ended after Holt had made two
gains for 12 and 7 yards respectively
after the kick-off.
The Stanford line held the Bruin
attack at the opening of the third
quarter and Sprott kicked 43 yards.
Stanford took the ball and after a
few attempts at the line, Templeton
kicked. Deeds made 12 yards through
center and gains by Wells, Sprott and
Rowe took the play down to the Stan
ford line and Wells went ov«r around
right end for his second touchdown
and Cline converted again.
Wells slipped for a minute in this
quarter and fumbled, giving Stanford
the ball on the 30-yard line. Temple
ton kicked immediately and Pelouze
dumped Deeds in his tracks. Wells
came back at this point and broke
through the line for 45 yards.
California attempted another lor
ward pass in the fourth quarter but
Adams broke through and tackled
Rowe as he was about to pass. Cali
fornia lost 10 yards on this play. Pat
rick went in for Carroll, and with
the ball in Stanford's hands, a march
up the field was begun with Patrick
and Holt making repeated gains
through the fast weakening California
line. Majors, the reputed start in the
line was knocked down easily in these
plays and the red-shirted backs found
no trouble on his side of the line.
Cramner on the opposite side of center
proved a harder man to get past than
Majors.
Pelouze took the ball for 15 yards
around the California right end and
then Evans uncorked a farward pass
ing game that swept Andy Smith's
men off their feet. Patrick took a pass
for G yards and a few seconds later
Adams caught another one and raced
across for a touchdown." Templeton
converted, making the count 14 to 10.
After the kick-off Sprott was forced
to kick, and the Stanford eleven com
menced its march up the field again.
Patrick and Holt made their yards
easily through the Bruin line and two
forward passes brought the play up
to the Blue and Gold five-yard line.
Here the California line stiffened
and Patrick was unable to get through.
With the timer ready to fire his gun,
a forward pass was attempted across
the goal line and failed as the timer
ended the game.

TANFOkd'S lighting varsiiy football
team went down to defeat Saturday
at the hands of the University of Cali
fornia eleven by the score of 14 to
10, but it is a defeat that is virtually
a triumph. Playing their first season
of American football, the Stanford
men fought the Blue and Gold players
off their feet in the last quarter, and
the timer's gun saved the Blue and
Gold from another touchdown and the
loss of the Big Game. The perform
ance of the Stanford men Saturday is
a credit to their University, their
Coach and to themselves.
"Pret" Holt Stars
An interesting fact about the score
of the game is that in the first year
of American football between Cali
fornia and Stanford in 1892, the Cardi
nal team won by the score of 14 to
10, and on the resumption of American
football relations in 1919, California
turned the tables by the same score.
In dealing out the individual glory
for the game, Coach Evans gives
"Pret" Holt first place without ques
tion. Holt played a perfect game both
offensive and defensive and was the
most feared of the Cardinal backs.
Next to Holt comes "Swede" Righter,
who played a strong game in the line
at all times. Adams played a good
game also in the line. In the back
field Evans gives credit to all of the
backs. Bonney, Patrick, Campbell,
Wark, Shlaudeman and Templeton all
put up great exhibitions. Templeton
in particular came through with the
first Cardinal score by drop-kicking
a field goal from the 45-yard line in
the early part of the first quarter.
Templeton also punted in great form,
although according to Evans, "Dink"
is good for 30 yards more on each of
his punts. He has been instructed to
hold the length of his kicks down in
order to give the ends a chance to
nail the receiver, and to prevent him
from getting a good start in running
the ball back.
Stanford Fight Evident
As had been prophesied the Stanford
fighting spirit was a big factor in the
Cardinal showing and during the last

fem minutes of the game the inexperi
enced players swept their experienced
opponents off their feet by sheer fight.
The breaks went against Stanford at
at this point and the Blue and Gold
came out victorious.
California won the toss and Boucher
kicked off. Adams received the ball
for Stanford and after he was downed,
the Stanford backs took the ball up
the field, and when the 45-yard line
was reached, "Dink" Templeton drop
ped back, swung his famous right
foot and placed a field goal between
the California goal posts for three
points.
Sprott came right back for Cali
fornia by finding a hole in the Cardi
nal line for 25 yards. "Dummy"
Wells and Deeds made substantial
gains and then the Stanford line held
and California lost the ball on downs.
Templeton kicked and Deeds ran the
ball back 15 yards. At this point,
Sprott decided to give his backs a
rest and switched to an open field
game. Three forward passes were at
tempted in succession, but the Cardi
nal backs had each eligible man on
the California team marked and the
passes failed.
Caughy Breaks Through
Sprott then gave the ball to Brooks
and the Blue and Gold skipper made
two yards around right end. Sprott
took the pigskin on next try and
was thrown for a two-yard loss. Sprott
then attempted another forward pass
but Captain Caughey broke through
and smeared him. Stanford took the
ball and Holt started things going by
annexing 15 yards. The quarter closed
with Stanford leading 3 to 0.
Campbell started the attack in the
second quarter by taking the ball for
a one-yard gain. Bonney made four
and Templeton booted. The Stanford
ends were blocked and Deeds ran in
ten yards before he was stopped. Rowe
went in for Captain Brooks at this
point and made one yard around left
end.
Wells Scores
California kicked and on the first
play Bihlman fumbled on the Stanford
40-yard line. The Pears thon started

an attack on the Stanford line with
all their force. Deeds climled through
for seven yards and Wells found a
spot good for 13 more. The next play
Wells made four yards and on his
third try he plunged across the Stan
ford line for a touchdown. Cline con
verted, making the score 7 to 3. The
half ended after Holt had made two
gains for 12 and 7 yards respectively
after the kick-off.
The Stanford line held the Bruin
attack at the opening of the third
quarter and Sprott kicked 43 yards.
Stanford took the ball and after a
few attempts at the line, Templeton
kicked. Deeds made 12 yards through
center and gains by Wells, Sprott and
Rowe took the play down to the Stan
ford line and Wells went ov«r around
right end for his second touchdown
and Cline converted again.
Wells slipped for a minute in this
quarter and fumbled, giving Stanford
the ball on the 30-yard line. Temple
ton kicked immediately and Pelouze
dumped Deeds in his tracks. Wells
came back at this point and broke
through the line for 45 yards.
California attempted another lor
ward pass in the fourth quarter but
Adams broke through and tackled
Rowe as he was about to pass. Cali
fornia lost 10 yards on this play. Pat
rick went in for Carroll, and with
the ball in Stanford's hands, a march
up the field was begun with Patrick
and Holt making repeated gains
through the fast weakening California
line. Majors, the reputed start in the
line was knocked down easily in these
plays and the red-shirted backs found
no trouble on his side of the line.
Cramner on the opposite side of center
proved a harder man to get past than
Majors.
Pelouze took the ball for 15 yards
around the California right end and
then Evans uncorked a farward pass
ing game that swept Andy Smith's
men off their feet. Patrick took a pass
for G yards and a few seconds later
Adams caught another one and raced
across for a touchdown." Templeton
converted, making the count 14 to 10.
After the kick-off Sprott was forced
to kick, and the Stanford eleven com
menced its march up the field again.
Patrick and Holt made their yards
easily through the Bruin line and two
forward passes brought the play up
to the Blue and Gold five-yard line.
Here the California line stiffened
and Patrick was unable to get through.
With the timer ready to fire his gun,
a forward pass was attempted across

TANFOkd'S lighting varsiiy football
team went down to defeat Saturday
at the hands of the University of Cali
fornia eleven by the score of 14 to
10, but it is a defeat that is virtually
a triumph. Playing their first season
of American football, the Stanford
men fought the Blue and Gold players
off their feet in the last quarter, and
the timer's gun saved the Blue and
Gold from another touchdown and the
loss of the Big Game. The perform
ance of the Stanford men Saturday is
a credit to their University, their
Coach and to themselves.
"Pret" Holt Stars
An interesting fact about the score
of the game is that in the first year
of American football between Cali
fornia and Stanford in 1892, the Cardi
nal team won by the score of 14 to
10, and on the resumption of American
football relations in 1919, California
turned the tables by the same score.
In dealing out the individual glory
for the game, Coach Evans gives
"Pret" Holt first place without ques
tion. Holt played a perfect game both
offensive and defensive and was the
most feared of the Cardinal backs.
Next to Holt comes "Swede" Righter,
who played a strong game in the line
at all times. Adams played a good
game also in the line. In the back
field Evans gives credit to all of the
backs. Bonney, Patrick, Campbell,
Wark, Shlaudeman and Templeton all
put up great exhibitions. Templeton
in particular came through with the
first Cardinal score by drop-kicking
a field goal from the 45-yard line in
the early part of the first quarter.
Templeton also punted in great form,
although according to Evans, "Dink"
is good for 30 yards more on each of
his punts. He has been instructed to
hold the length of his kicks down in
order to give the ends a chance to
nail the receiver, and to prevent him
from getting a good start in running
the ball back.
Stanford Fight Evident
As had been prophesied the Stanford
fighting spirit was a big factor in the
Cardinal showing and during the last

fem minutes of the game the inexperi
enced players swept their experienced
opponents off their feet by sheer fight.
The breaks went against Stanford at
at this point and the Blue and Gold
came out victorious.
California won the toss and Boucher
kicked off. Adams received the ball
for Stanford and after he was downed,
the Stanford backs took the ball up
the field, and when the 45-yard line
was reached, "Dink" Templeton drop
ped back, swung his famous right
foot and placed a field goal between
the California goal posts for three
points.
Sprott came right back for Cali
fornia by finding a hole in the Cardi
nal line for 25 yards. "Dummy"
Wells and Deeds made substantial
gains and then the Stanford line held
and California lost the ball on downs.
Templeton kicked and Deeds ran the
ball back 15 yards. At this point,
Sprott decided to give his backs a
rest and switched to an open field
game. Three forward passes were at
tempted in succession, but the Cardi
nal backs had each eligible man on
the California team marked and the
passes failed.
Caughy Breaks Through
Sprott then gave the ball to Brooks
and the Blue and Gold skipper made
two yards around right end. Sprott
took the pigskin on next try and
was thrown for a two-yard loss. Sprott
then attempted another forward pass
but Captain Caughey broke through
and smeared him. Stanford took the
ball and Holt started things going by
annexing 15 yards. The quarter closed
with Stanford leading 3 to 0.
Campbell started the attack in the
second quarter by taking the ball for
a one-yard gain. Bonney made four
and Templeton booted. The Stanford
ends were blocked and Deeds ran in
ten yards before he was stopped. Rowe
went in for Captain Brooks at this
point and made one yard around left
end.
Wells Scores
California kicked and on the first
play Bihlman fumbled on the Stanford
40-yard line. The Pears thon started

an attack on the Stanford line with
all their force. Deeds climled through
for seven yards and Wells found a
spot good for 13 more. The next play
Wells made four yards and on his
third try he plunged across the Stan
ford line for a touchdown. Cline con
verted, making the score 7 to 3. The
half ended after Holt had made two
gains for 12 and 7 yards respectively
after the kick-off.
The Stanford line held the Bruin
attack at the opening of the third
quarter and Sprott kicked 43 yards.
Stanford took the ball and after a
few attempts at the line, Templeton
kicked. Deeds made 12 yards through
center and gains by Wells, Sprott and
Rowe took the play down to the Stan
ford line and Wells went ov«r around
right end for his second touchdown
and Cline converted again.
Wells slipped for a minute in this
quarter and fumbled, giving Stanford
the ball on the 30-yard line. Temple
ton kicked immediately and Pelouze
dumped Deeds in his tracks. Wells
came back at this point and broke
through the line for 45 yards.
California attempted another lor
ward pass in the fourth quarter but
Adams broke through and tackled
Rowe as he was about to pass. Cali
fornia lost 10 yards on this play. Pat
rick went in for Carroll, and with
the ball in Stanford's hands, a march
up the field was begun with Patrick
and Holt making repeated gains
through the fast weakening California
line. Majors, the reputed start in the
line was knocked down easily in these
plays and the red-shirted backs found
no trouble on his side of the line.
Cramner on the opposite side of center
proved a harder man to get past than
Majors.
Pelouze took the ball for 15 yards
around the California right end and
then Evans uncorked a farward pass
ing game that swept Andy Smith's
men off their feet. Patrick took a pass
for G yards and a few seconds later
Adams caught another one and raced
across for a touchdown." Templeton
converted, making the count 14 to 10.
After the kick-off Sprott was forced
to kick, and the Stanford eleven com
menced its march up the field again.
Patrick and Holt made their yards
easily through the Bruin line and two
forward passes brought the play up
to the Blue and Gold five-yard line.
Here the California line stiffened
and Patrick was unable to get through.
With the timer ready to fire his gun,
a forward pass was attempted across
the goal line and failed as the timer
ended the game.
