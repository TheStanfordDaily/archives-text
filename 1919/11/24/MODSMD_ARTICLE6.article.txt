# "NEVER SAY DIE" CAST BEST YET SAYS COACH DAVIS
## 
### 
Coach Gordon Davis announced today
that, in his opinion, the cast of the Soph
omore play, "Never Say Die," is the
most able that it has even been his pleas
ure to direct. From the leads—Lester
Seib and Eleanor Anderson —to the
smallest character parts, the players are
experienced and talented.
"Never Say Die" is the most important
event left for this quarter, and both ac
tors and coach have sacrificed their
Thanksgiving vacations to putting upon
its production more than the necessary
time to make it a success in every detail.
The mort important feature of the re
hearsals up to date is the unusual facility
with which Lester Seib, one of the stars
in last year's Junior opera, has assumed
the role of Dionysius Woodbury, the
principal character. Too much can not
be said about his ability, which, accord
ing to Davis, is entirely professional.
Like "The First Born," a great part
of the charm of "Never Say Die" lies
in its complicated and striking detail—
and attention to detail is one of Gordon's
forts.
"Never Say Die" is a comedy; but a
comedy with enough real matter in it to
obviate any touch of the burlesque. In
dications seem to that it will be
tbi' nost brilliant pro Irction of the year.
