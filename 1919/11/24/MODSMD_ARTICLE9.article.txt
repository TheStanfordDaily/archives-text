# U.C. WINS THE ANNUAL INTERCOLLEGIATE DEBATE
## JUDGES VOTE TWO TO ONE FOR CALIFORNIA Stanford Fails to Establish Contention for Adoption of Plumb Plan 
### 
'FHE University of California debating
team, opposing the Plumb Plan for
railroad control, won the annual inter
collegiate debate from the Stanford rep
resentatives at Berkeley last Friday
night -The vote of the judges was two
in favor of California and one in favor
of Stanford.
Th Plumb Plan would give the profits
of the railroads to the operatives, while
any loss that might be sustained would
be paid by the government. With this
as a basis for argument, the California
debaters wove into their speeches the
assertion that the "people would pay,"
and through a constant reiteration of
this statement, succeeded in establishing
their point.
The California side of the question
was presented by J. E. Peyser, L. E.
Bressleau, and C. C. Hildebrand.
The Stanford debaters—D. L. Good
man '22; C. O. Fenlason, '19; and M. M.
Goldstein, '20—were unable to overcome
the contention insisted on by California,
although the arguments were admitted
to be extremely close and the work of
the Stanford men was brilliant
Justice Wilbur of the California Su
preme Court and Caruthers nf the
San Francisco Superior Court, voted for
California. Chief Justice Angelotti of
the California Supreme Court cast his
vote for Stanford
