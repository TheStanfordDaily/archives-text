# STUDENT CONTROL RULES ARE SUBMITTED TO COUNCIL
## President Gives Out Regulations 
### 
DULES and regulations for the gov
ernment of general student con
duct, which have been adopted by
various governing and administrative
bodies of Stanford University during
the years of Stanford's existence, have
been handed to the new Men's Council
of Student Control by President Ray
Lyman Wilbur, and will be used by
that council in the conduct of its of
fice. The Council publishes the rules
today for the benefit of the student
body generally, and asks that they be
read and observed.
The set of regulations includes ex
cerpts from the Founding Grant, reso
lutions and orders of the Board of
Trustees, resolutions of faculty com
mittees having supervision of student
affairs, and interpretations by the
former Men's Conference. The set of
regulations has grown with the Uni
versity, and has the official sanction
of the administration.
The rules, as presented by Presi
dent Wilbur, follows:
I. The Fundamental Standard
(a) "Students are expected to show
both within and without the University
such respect for order, morality, per
sonal honor, and the rights of others as
is demanded of good citizens... Failure
to do this will be sufficient cause for re
moval from the University."—Univer
sity Register for 1912-13, p. 60.
(b) "A spirit of equality must be
maintained within the University. To
this end it shall be the duty of the Uni
versity authorities to prohibit excessive
expenditures and other excesses on the
part of the students, and the formation
or growth of any organization, custom,
or social function that tends to the de
velopment of exclusive or undemocratic

castes within the University, and to ex
clude from the institution any one whose
conduct is inconsistent with the founda
tion."—By Founding Grant.
Business Integrity
(c) Business integrity is required in
the fulfillment of agreements, and
prompt payment of bills, by individuals,
by classes, and by all student organiza
tions.
11. Prohibition of the Use of Liquor
Bringing intoxicating liquors into the
University community using intoxicat
ing liquors in the University community,
and drunkenness either in the University
community or elsewhere, are prohibited.
This is shown by the following resolu
tions :
(a) That the Academic Council is re
quested to prohibit the use of liquors in
fraternity chapter-houses, student club
houses, and other student lodgings.
This prohibition extends to all stu
dent lodgings, whether on the campus
or elsewhere. The University assumes
that the act of registering as a student
implies full acceptance of this policy.—
University Register for 1912-13, p. 60;
By Board of Trustees, May 29, 1908.
The University regulation again:t
liquor is interpreted as including the
bringing of intoxicating liquors into, and
their use in the University community.—
By Men's Conference; Adopted by the
Faculty Committee. July, 1919.
(b) The Board of Trustees voted that
in all future rentals or leases of chapter
houses it shall be expressly provided that
no intoxicating liquors shall ever at any
time be sold or used on the premises,
and upon a violation of this provision,
such lease shall terminate and become
void.—April 24, 1908.
(c) The Board of Trustees of the
University passed a resolution to the ef
fect that drunkenness be regarded as
ground for suspension from the Univer
sity and called upon the president and
faculty to take all necessary steps to en
force this resolution.—February 7. 1908.
(d) The Academic Council of the
University is in thorough sympathy with
the policy of eliminating drinking of in-:
toxicating liquors from Encina Hall,!
the fraternity houses, and other student
lodgings, and the removal of students
guilty of intoxication from the institu
tion.
The council hereby urges and instructs
the University Committee on Student
Affairs to use all practicable means to
these ends, and pledges its support to
the president and Committee on Student
Affairs in their efforts towards freeing
the University from the burden and dis
grace of student drunkenness. — By
Academic Council, February 14, 1908.
111. Hazing
All practices of hazing are prohibited.
Hazing is defined as Including "all prac
tices which compel a student to submit
to treatment from fellow students that
is humiliating or dangerous," and such
practices are considered "an infringe
ment of personal liberty and an offense
against good order."—By Faculty Com
mittee, August 27, 1910.
The practice of "tubbing" is specifi
cally included in the above definition,
and prohibited.—By Faculty Committee,
September 2, 1910.
The University regulation against haz
ing is interpreted as a prohibition
against "tubbing" for disciplinary pur
poses.—By Men's Student Council, Feb
ruary, 1916; Adopted by the Faculty
Committee July, 1919.
IV. Ground Rules
(a) Property is to be respected, and
shall not be destroyed or injured.
The unauthorized discharge of fire
arms is prohibited.
Unless otherwise expressly authorized
by the Board of Trustees, no temporary
wiring or other changes shall be made
in electric wiring at the University, ex
cepting under the direction of the comp
troller.
V. Social and Other Affatrs
(a) Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
and Thursday evenings (unless these
precede holidays) are not open for so
cial, dramatic, or similar functions.
Similarly, the seven days preceding final
examinations are a "closed period."
(b) Heads of committees for all
dances, such as class and campus dances
and jolly-ups, shall submit to the Dean
of Women the list of chaperones not less
than three days before such dances.
(This rule applies to all men's and
women's organizations not having per
manent house chaperones.)
(c) The holding of dances by student
organizations oil the campus is declared
to be against the University policy. All
other activities including social func
tions, dramatic performances, concerts,
exhibitions, etc., held off the campus and
in which student organizations are in
volved are subject to University sanction
and control. Permission to participate
in such activities must be received from
the appropriate dean whose action must
be approved by the president of the Uni
versity. Debating and athletic activities
are subject to the control of the Com
mittee on Public Exercises and Ath
letics, respectively, and permission to
participate in such activities must be
secured in accordance with the rules of
such committees.
(d) No student shall participate in
more than two draamtic performances
in any one academic year nor in more
than one such performance in a single
quarter. This rule applies equally to
so-called minor and major parts, author-
ship, coaching, and business manage
ment.
(e) All "functions," including after
play suppers, dances and receptions, and
after-dance suppers must close not later
than 12 o'clock, midnight, except that
each organization may be allowed one
1:00 o'clock dance in each year, pro
vided such dance shall not be held on
Saturday night. Tlfis rule holds, with
other University regulations, during va
cations.—Men's Conference; adopted by
Faculty Committee, July, 1919
(112) No student organization shall be
allowed to hold initiations in public.—By
Men's Conference, April, 1916; Adopted
by Faculty Committee, July, 1919.
(g) No individual student or students
shall conduct a dance or other social
function for personal profit.
VI. Use of Canoes on Lagunita
The use of canoes on Lagunita is lim
ited to persons who have passed suc
cessfully the test outlined below :
The test shall consist in taking a
canoe twenty-five yards from shore,
tipping it over, and swimming to shore
with the canoe.
While taking the test men shall wear
shoes, bathing suit, and overalls or their
equipment. Women shall wear shoes,
bathing suits and a long skirt, or the
equivalent.
On passing the test a filing card is to
be signed by the person taking the test
and by the supervisor, these cards to
be kept by the boatman. Each time a
canoe is taken out the boatman will sat
isfy himself, either from his personal
acquaintance with the party or by re
quiring a signature on the card, that the
person using the canoe has passed the
test.
VII. Probation, Suspension, and Ex
pulsion
A student on probation for any cause
shall not take part in any inter-collegiate
contest, nor represent the University in
any way, whether individually or in con
nection with any athletic, literary, musi
cal, dramatic, or other organization.
In order that this rule may be prop
erly administered, the following pro
cedure is provided except that the duties
thereby placed upon the Committee on
Student Affairs shall be exercises in
the future by the Dean of Men and the
Dean of Women:
"Committees of the faculty having
jurisdiction over student organizations
which represent the University or use
the University name, are instructed as
follows:
"1. That individual or collective stu
dent enterprises, using the University
name, which involve the absence of the
participants from the University and
have been authorized by the Associated
Students must receive the official sanc
tion of the particular faculty committee
concerned.
"2. That the chairman of the commit
tee sanctioning the enterprise shall fur
nish the Registrar witTi a list of names
of the participants.
"3. The Registrar shall remove from
the lists of names those students who
are debarred from representing the Uni
versity because of being on probation
for delinquent or irregular behavior. To
facilitate this action the Committee on
Scholarship and on Student Affairs are
hereby directed to keen on file with the
Registrar complete lists of students
placed under such discipline by them.
"4. The revised lists shall be returned
to the chairman of the committee con
cerned, who shall notify the students
engaged in the enterprise, and only those
whose names appear on the revised list
.shall be allowed to take part n it."—
Organization, General Legislation, and
Standing Regulations on the Faculty,
p. 25.
(Since students on probation are not
permitted to take part in dramatic per
formances at the University, it has been
found necessary to require that lists of
participants be furnished the Registrar
and be treated in the same way.)
Students under suspension or expul
sion shall be denied the privilege of the
campus, including residence and attend
ance on social and other functions.
Notice to this effect shall be sent to each
student suspended or expelled and to his
living group.
RAY LYMAN WILBUR.
