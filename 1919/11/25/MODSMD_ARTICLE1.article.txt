# STUDENT CONTROL RULES ARE SUBMITTED TO COUNCIL
## President Gives Out Regulations 
### 
DULES and regulations for the gov
ernment of general student con
duct, which have been adopted by
various governing and administrative
bodies of Stanford University during
the years of Stanford's existence, have
been handed to the new Men's Council
of Student Control by President Ray
Lyman Wilbur, and will be used by
that council in the conduct of its of
fice. The Council publishes the rules
today for the benefit of the student
body generally, and asks that they be
read and observed.
The set of regulations includes ex
cerpts from the Founding Grant, reso
lutions and orders of the Board of
Trustees, resolutions of faculty com
mittees having supervision of student
affairs, and interpretations by the
former Men's Conference. The set of
regulations has grown with the Uni
versity, and has the official sanction
of the administration.
The rules, as presented by Presi
dent Wilbur, follows:
I. The Fundamental Standard
(a) "Students are expected to show
both within and without the University
such respect for order, morality, per
sonal honor, and the rights of others as
is demanded of good citizens... Failure
to do this will be sufficient cause for re
moval from the University."—Univer
sity Register for 1912-13, p. 60.
(b) "A spirit of equality must be
maintained within the University. To
this end it shall be the duty of the Uni
versity authorities to prohibit excessive
expenditures and other excesses on the
part of the students, and the formation
or growth of any organization, custom,
or social function that tends to the de
velopment of exclusive or undemocratic

castes within the University, and to ex
clude from the institution any one whose
conduct is inconsistent with the founda
tion."—By Founding Grant.
Business Integrity
(c) Business integrity is required in
the fulfillment of agreements, and
prompt payment of bills, by individuals,
by classes, and by all student organiza
tions.
11. Prohibition of the Use of Liquor
Bringing intoxicating liquors into the
University community using intoxicat
ing liquors in the University community,
and drunkenness either in the University
community or elsewhere, are prohibited.
This is shown by the following resolu
tions :
(a) That the Academic Council is re
quested to prohibit the use of liquors in
fraternity chapter-houses, student club
houses, and other student lodgings.
This prohibition extends to all stu
dent lodgings, whether on the campus
or elsewhere. The University assumes
that the act of registering as a student
implies full acceptance of this policy.—
University Register for 1912-13, p. 60;
By Board of Trustees, May 29, 1908.
The University regulation again:t
liquor is interpreted as including the
bringing of intoxicating liquors into, and
their use in the University community.—
By Men's Conference; Adopted by the
Faculty Committee. July, 1919.
(b) The Board of Trustees voted that
in all future rentals or leases of chapter
houses it shall be expressly provided that
no intoxicating liquors shall ever at any
time be sold or used on the premises,
and upon a violation of this provision,
such lease shall terminate and become
void.—April 24, 1908.
(c) The Board of Trustees of the
University passed a resolution to the ef
fect that drunkenness be regarded as
ground for suspension from the Univer
sity and called upon the president and
faculty to take all necessary steps to en
