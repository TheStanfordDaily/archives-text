# UP TO US

IT is now up to us. The University of California campus was invaded last
week in violation of an express agreement between the presidents of the
institutions that there should be no invading of rival campuses. The evidence
pointed so strongly towards Stanford students that we have officially ac
cepted the responsibility, and now there is but one thing left for us to do:
Find out what students care so little for Stanford that they will make us
break our word with California. What students will risk the indefinite sus
pension of our splendid intercollegiate relations which, if carried on in a
decent manner, will bring joy to thousands of alumni of both universities, as
well as wholesome competition between the rival teams. We must locate
these students at all costs, and although the Council of Student Control has
not yet determined what the nature of the punishment will be, there is little
question but that they should be expelled.
There is little question but that guilty parties can be apprehended if the
whole student body realizes the seriousness of the situation. For us to
merely apologize to California, and for them to accept this apology does not
relieve either university from the obligations of the agreement made between
the two presidents. We must show our good faith by making every effort to
secure the punishment of the individuals who violated our contract. If we
do not do this, it will appear that we made an apology to be sure that the
Big Game was played, and for no other purpose.
