## 
### 
Election of members to the various
boards of control of the University,
and discussion of student and alumni
problems formed the principal busi
ness at the meeting of the Advisory
Board of the Stanford Alumni Asso
ciation which was held at the Stan
ford Medical School in San Francisco,
last Thursday night. The meeting was
preceded by a dinner, at which the
board members were the guests of Dr
William Ophuls, Dean of the Medical
School.
For the Board of Athletic Control,
Dr. T. M. Williams who has been a
member ever since the formation of
th 9 board, was re-elected to succeed
himself. For the Board of Control of
the Stanford Eating Clubs, the mem
bers chosen were J. E. McDowell, A.

M. Cathcart, and R. W. Barrett. For
ihe Board of Directors of the Stan
ford Union Dr. George Barnett, A. E.
Roth, and Chauncey Dunn, were
elected.
The board discussed the need of
more eating clubs and of improved
facilities for eating at the Union, and
also the means of establishing a more
homelike atmosphere in the Union,
but no action was taken. Owing to
the unsatisfactory arrangements made
this year for the sale of football tick
ets to the alumni, and decision was
made that hereafter due notice should
be given the alumni of the sale of
football tickets, and, so far as practic
able, an equal opportunity for pur
chasing them.
Miss Bernice Taylor, ex-'2l, has re
turned to the campus for a short visit,
and will be the guest of Delta Delta
j Delta until after Thanksgiving, when
she will return to her home in Los
' Angeles.
