# No Flowers For 1922 Cotillion Says Committee
## 
### 
In accordance with Stanford tradi
tion, the Tradition Committee which
was appointed by Roy King, Student
Body President, has recommended that
flowers and taxis be tabood at the
Sophomore Cotillion. This has always
been a custom at Stanford, but it was
abandaned to some extent during the
war period.
Acting upon this recommendation,
the Sophomore Cotillion Committee
has decided that, there shall be no
flowers worn at the dance, and that
no one wearing flowers will be ad
mitted.
Programs for the Sophomore Cotillion
will be ready for distribution on
Wednesday noon. The committee has
worked out a novel program which will
fit in with the elaborate Oriental decora
tion scheme, which has been worked out
with the assistance of W. J. Gores, '17.
One of San Francisco's best eight
piece orchestras will furnish the neces
sary jazz for the annual Sophomore for
mal dance. The seventh and twelfth
dances will be waltzes, while the re
mainder will be fox trots and one steps.
The music will start playing at 8:30
sharp, Wednesday night, November 26,
in the Encina gymnasium.
