# CARDINAL SALE BREAKS ALL PREVIOUS RECORDS
## 
### 
Sales of "The Cardinal" on the
Quad this morning reached the highest
number of any publication hitherto
offered for distribution on the campus.
This great demand has lead the man
agement of the Cardinal to advise all
who expect to secure copies in the
future to make sure of their issue by
subscribing, as the monthly output
will be limited.
The management further urges all
those desiring to submit stories,
sketches or verse to report without
delay to the editor, Robert A. Don
aldson, Room 426 Encina, for confer
ence.
