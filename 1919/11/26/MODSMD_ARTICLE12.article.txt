# 1922 IS READY FOR COTILLION TONIGHT
## Chinese Decoration Will Be Feature of Sophomore Formal Dance 
### 
With practically all the tickets sold
the hall elaborately and artisticaly deco
rated, handsome programs being dis
tributed, and the "King" jazz orchestras
coming from San Francisco, the Sopho
more Cotillion is assuming definite shape
and promises to be the most enjoyable
formal held on the campus for several
years.
"Walt" Gores, '17, is in charge of the
decorations, and has conceived the novel
idea of having different provinces of
China marked about the walls on Chi
nese mats so that the men may arrange
to meet their partners there.
Several important features are pecu
liar to this cotillion. The seventh and
twelfth dances will be waltzes, and no
provision need be made for the dinner
dance, as that will be off the program.
Upon the recommendation of the Tradi
tions Committee and by the ruling of
the Sophomore Cotillion Committee,
positively no one wearing flowers will
be admitted.
