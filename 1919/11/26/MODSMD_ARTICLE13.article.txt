# SEMI-FINALS ARE REACHED IN TENNIS INTRAMURAL BATTLE
## 
### 
S. E. Turner, '21. playing under the
Zeta Psi colors, sprung a surprise yes
terday in defeating L. E. Fish, '21, Delta
Upsilon, in straight sets, 6-4, 6-1. Tur
ner played the net continually and sel
dom missed his smashes. Fish seemed
unable to master his drives, outing many
of them, and had difficulty in returning
Turner's well-placed serves.
In the intra-dormitory matches, W.
W. Young handily defeated F. Mendel
for a place in the semi-final round by
the score of 6-4, 6-2. Young is the best
material brought to light in the 1923
class and will be an asset in the spring
meet with the California freshmen. He
plays a consistent game and is very ac
curate in his net work.
