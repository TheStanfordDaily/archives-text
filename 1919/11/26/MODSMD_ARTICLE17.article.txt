# C.K. RAND SPEAKS ON MEDIAEVAL LIBRARIES
## Illustrated Lecture Shows a Great Change From the Early Forms 
### 
When the slides of the cathedral
of Siena and the libraries of Escorial
and the Vatican, were thrown upon
the curtain at the close of the lecture
of Professor C. K. Rand, last evening
in the Little Theater, each person
present gained a better understanding
of the growth and change in archi
tecture and customs that has taken
place between the mediaeval and the
modern libraries.
The illustrations used by Professor
Rand showed clearly the changes that
have taken place in the styles of
writings of the Scribes from the be
ginning of libraries, when "Cassio
dorus" accumulated the first religious
writings and had his scribes copy,
up until almost the present day.
The great care with which the med
iaeval books were handled and the
silence that reigned in the libraries
were indeed points which suggested
comparisons in the minds of the audi
ence. The monks or scribes were not
allowed to talk except at certaia
specified intervals, so most of their
communications were made through
the medium of a code of signs.
