itfTHE CARDINAL," Stanford's new magazine, appeared on the campus today.
* Considerable interest has been aroused over this new effort of Stanford
students to publish a "college magazine with professional standards," and
the initial issue has pleased the campus in general. There is plenty of room
here at Stanford for a magazine with the standards of the Cardinal. Too
much competition between the campus publications is bad for the journals
themselves, bad for Stanford, and especially hard on the advertisers who
bear the brunt of the high cost of printing. The coming of "The Cardinal"
is welcomed by students, outside subscribers, and advertisers alike, for in
this magazine a splendid outlet is found for the highest type of literature and
art produced in the University.
Robert A. Donaldson, the editor, is to be congratulated on the success
of the new magazine. It has largely been through his efforts that the change
from the old Sequoia-Roundtable was affected.. Donaldson has put his en
tire effort into the magazine, and the first issue justifies his work. It is a
privilege for Stanford students to be able to read articles, short stories, and
poems of a high order in a magazine that we can look upon with a distinct
sense of pride, for it is the work of our Stanford people. We have long
wanted just such a magazine at Stanford, and now our desire has been
gratified. We hope that the students, despite the thousands and one drains
on their pocketbooks, will realize this opportunity, and make the success of
"The Cardinal" a financial one as well as a literary one.
We admire especially the editorial policy of the new magazine, and it
ia with the editor's permission that today we reprint his editorial on "A
Newspaper and Stanford Ideals." We feel as Donaldson does about this
question, and are anxious for the Stanford students to become interested in
this live topic.
