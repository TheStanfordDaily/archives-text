Ten Y. M. C. A. leaders have been
definitely selected by the Nominating
Committee to represent Stanford at
the Students' Volunteer Convention,
held in Des Moines, lowa, December
31 to January 4. The names of these
men have already been sent in together
with the registration fee. A tentative
list of names of the remaining eight
delegates has also been drawn up
which will complete the Y. M. C. A.
quota of Stanford students. Five "Y"
representatives will be selected in ad
dition to the men.
Those who have definitely signed up
to go are: Lyman Wilbur, '21, Del
Lundquist, '22, Walter Badcr, '23, Erie
Collins, '22, Reid Nesbit, '21, Fred
Shipp, '20, James Sparling, '20, Earl
Smith, '20, S. K. Davis, '20, and Donald
Robertson, '23. Dr. F. E. Morgan, re
ligious secretary of the local "Y", will
also represent Stanford at the conven
tion. It was announced today by the
association that the following had sig
nified their willingness to go to Des
Moines although not as yet definitely
signed up: Charles Titus, '18, C. E.
Sanders, graduate, V. R. Harlan, '23,
H. M. Hosepian, '21, J. F. Porter, '21,
R. B. Montgomery, '21, and H. W.
Brown, '21. The delegates leave for
the east on December 27.
Miss Edith Hazlett, traveling secre
tary of the Student Volunteer conven
tion movement, was on the campus
yesterday in connection with the
work. She announced that Harvard.
Yale, Princeton and other eastern uni
versities as well as the state colleges
of Washington and Oregon, had all
arrangements to send full quotas of
representatives. About 8000 are ex
pected to attend the convention, 6000
of which, according to John R. Mott,
who will preside over the congress,
are already signed up. The University
of California is sending between sixty
and seventy delegates.
The Student Volunteer Convention
meets once every two years and is
composed of delegates from every
American university who come to
gether for the purpose of exchanging
ideas of social service. The move
ment is not fostered by the Y. M. C.
A. but is in the hands of a separate
organization known as the Student
Volunteer Movement. Prominent so
cial leaders from all parts of the
country will be present to address the
delegates and to particularly determine
the policies to be followed in regard
to missionary work. It is felt by so
cial leaders that the bulk of future
missionaries must be recruited from
university students, and the interest
of the future missionaries can only be
aroused by calling a general congress
of leaders of social work in American
unlverstiies. The last convention was
held at Kansas City, in 1915, to which
Stanford sent fifteen representatives.
Subsequent conventions have not been
held until the present, on account of
the war.
