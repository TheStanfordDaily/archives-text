# "DAILY PALO ALTO" REPRINTS EDITORIAL OF NEW "CARDINAL"
## 
### 
TIHIS editorial on "A Newspaper and
Stanford Ideals" published today in
the Cardinal is of especial interest to
Stanford students, and we reprint it
in the insert of the Daily Palo Alto
hoping that the students will consider
the possibilities of a newspaper of
such a character:
Every Stanford journalist dreams a
dream. You do not hear of it, talking
with him on the Quad or in the busy
hours of news-getting or writing; but
listen to him sometime in the late
afternoon in a corner of the office,
or in the wee small hours of a "ses
sion" in a room of the Hall or on the
Row; talk to the old grads who have
gone out and bucked the game with
its mercenary and selfish rottenness —
rottenness typical, for example of San
Francisco newspapers.
The uream is of an ideal newspaper,
a clean, honest paper, a paper that
tells the truth and nothing but the
truth; a well-written paper, a paper
with ideas initead of trash, of inter
pretative journalism instead of sensa
tional features; a paper that writes
up to the best in the public rather
! tnin down to the worst; a paper ready
j to fight to the finish for anything it
! sincere y believes is right; a paper un
influenced by advertisers and unthug
ged by politicians—a newspaper guided
by Stanford ideals.
| There is an article entitled "The
Newawriters' Union" elsewhere in the
i Cardinal. With the writer, a Stan
ford graduate and an Oakland news
paper man, we do not believe in a
Newswriters' Union which is affiliated
with the American Federation of
Labor. We do, however, believe in
a strong organization of newspaper
i men, under obligations to none save
i tne public and its own conscience.
But it should be a professional or
| ganization, relying on the strength of
! the truth rather than on the strength
of the strike. Its purpose should not
| be entirely to gain better wages and
| better working conditions, but rather
' and primarily, to maintain an ideal
of honesty, a standard of ability, and
jto recognize the newspaper's re
sponsibility to the public. Its mem
bers should write what the people
: or~ht to know rather than what the
publisher thinks that they should
I know. There are too many literary
, prostitutes in the game today—men
who, to gain a living, write what they
do not believe, garble news at a pub
lisher's request, print lies because the
; blue envelope lies along the route of
i truth. Up to the present, the game
has been too strong for the average
| lone individual to buck.
The future lies in organization of
the right kind. In a word, the news
paper game must be made safe for
democracy. The matter of wages is
of secondary importance, because, if
the first ideal is realized, better wages
and working conditions will follow the
success. It is safe to say that today
the majority of big newspaper pub
lishers cannot stand the spotlight of
truth. In many cases if their re
porters told the public the truth about
I them they would be tarred and feather
ed and run out of town. Let the
newspapermen organize and refuse to
write anything but the truth. The
pretensions of recalcitrant publishers
would be punctured like a balloon, the
eyes of the public would be opened,
and the newspaperman would take his
proper place in the community. He
would be a well-paid citizen of a highly
respected profession. He would have
standing similar to that of a lawyer
in a bar association.
But perhaps this is too much to ask
of the immediate future. We turn
again to the dream of the Stanford
journalist. It is only a dream as yet.
It has been furthered and given added
cloth from which to weave by the fact
overseas men have brought back the
best ideas of European journalism.
I But some Stanford dreamer some day
will have money enough to swing It
—a San Francisco newspaper run and
controlled and written by Stanford
men, motivated by the Stanford ideals
of truth and service.

hours of news-getting or writing; but
listen to him sometime in the late
afternoon in a corner of the office,

gone out and bucked the game with
its mercenary and selfish rottenness —
rottenness typical, for example of San

The uream is of an ideal newspaper,
a clean, honest paper, a paper that
tells the truth and nothing but the
truth; a well-written paper, a paper
with ideas initead of trash, of inter
pretative journalism instead of sensa
tional features; a paper that writes
up to the best in the public rather
