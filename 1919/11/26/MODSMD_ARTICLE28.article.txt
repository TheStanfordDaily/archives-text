# TWO SOCCER GAMES SLATED SATURDAY
## 
### 
Two soccer games will be played
at Stanford next Saturday, when the
varsity meets the Olympic Club and
the freshman team plays Lowell High
School. The Stanford-California soccer
game scheduled for Thanksgiving Day
on Berkeley Field, has been postponed
because of the present break in ath
letic relations between the two uni
versities.
Coach Harry Maloney expects to
hear any day from soccer officials in
Vancouver, B. C., regarding arrange
ments for the proposed trip of the
Cardnial soccerites to Vancouver for
a game on Christmas Day.
