# Cardinal Fifteen Will Play Anzacs
## Coach Jim Wylie Will Take Team to Sacramento Thursday

Twenty men of the Stanford Rugby
squad, headed by Coach Jim Wylie and
Trainer Harry Maloney, entrain for
Sacramento at 7:10 tomorrow morning,
where they will clash with the Davis
Farm Anzacs in a Thanksgiving match
at Buffalo Park.
Great interest has been created in the
capital city by the game, which is sched
uled as the feature of Sacramento's ath
letic card for Thanksgiving, and the cap
ital's newspapers have prophesied a great
gathering, since both Stanford and the
Australians are great favorites in that
city.
An additional attraction in the eyes
of Sacramento rugby enthusiasts is the
fact that Jim Wylie will leferee the
battle.
"It is a good oportunity for lovers of
the old game, which has been played in
California for so long, but which seems
now to be going into the background,
to see two first-class teams in action;
and I, for one, intend to be there," states
the Sporting Editor of the Sacramento
Union.
Fifty cents admission will be charged,
and Buffalo Park, the P. C. L. baseball
park, which can \jrccommodtite 30000
spectators, is expected to be filled.
Wylie has announced his line-up for
the game, which, if won, will give a
clean sweep of victories to the Cardinal
rugby fifteen:
Fullback, Thomas ; three - quarters,

Rogers, Kirby, Morris; first five
eighths, Green; second five-eighths, R.
Rogers; half back, Lynn; wing forward
Card; front-rankers, Wienn, Ratner;
lock, Duncan; second - rankers, Clark,
James; rear-rankers, Hanner, Maillot;
