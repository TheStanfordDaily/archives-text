# COACH M'CLINTOCK OUTLINES CARDINAL DEBATING PROGRAM
## FIVE CLASHES SCHEDULED Stanford Will Meet Best of Northern and Southern Forensic Teams 
### 
APPORTUNITIES in debating will be
v greater next quarter than at any
time in Stanford's long inter-collegi
ate forensic history, Coach McClintock
stated in an interview today. The
universities of Oregon, Washington,
Southern California, and Redlands,
will oppose Cardinal combinations in
regular team contests, while tryouts
for the big Joffre battle with the Uni
versity of California during the spring
quarter may start early in January.
McClintock is not yet certain
whether or not the seminar course
system of preparation for debate will
be followed in connection with all of
the future teams, though a registration
in some debating course may be a
pre-requisite to tryouts. The system
tried for the first time in connection
with the California inter-collegiate
argument was productive of hard
fighting speakrs and a wealth of
material Defeat in this contest was
due largely to a bad proposition, re
quiring the Stanford men to support
the "Plumb Plan" of railroad control;
and their success in obtaining the vote
of one judge, Chief Justice Angelotti,
is considered an accomplishment of
note.
Of the five contests scheduled only
that with Oregon will take place on
the Stanford campus. In the other
four instances the debates are in for
eign territory.
McClintoek urges the prospective
candidates to look the field over now
with a view to concentrating on one
of the several fields, as it will be
barely possible for one man to take
part in more than one or two of the
forensic battles.
