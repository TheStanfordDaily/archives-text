# "NEVER SAY DIE" SEAT SALE WILL BEGIN TOMORROW
## 'SHOP EARLY!' IS SLOGAN Sophomore Play Looms Up As Biggest Success Of the Year 
### 
If any stock can be taken in the
doctrine of "laugh and grow fat," then
"Never Say Die," the Willie Collier
comedy that the Sophomores will pro
duce in the Assembly Hall next Fri
day night, was written especially for
thin people. New York put on weight
for two years, through the means of
this fun show, and for the past year
"Never Say Die" has continued its
hilarious career throughout the coun
try as one of the biggest laugh suc
cesses' in stock.
A plot, twisted with humorous com
plications, is combined with brilliant,
scintillating lines to chase away the
dull moments. Adding to these two
fun-making elements, the playwright
has furnished an English setting with
one lone American to disturb the calm
of the British.
Despite the fact that he has been
their best customer for years, the
London doctors have finally told this
invalid American that he is about
to die. Feeling rather bad about this
but willing to do what he can for
the rest of humanity before he passes
on, this American, the part is played
by Lester Sieb, marries the fiancee of
his best friend. This, at the outset,
appears to be a very brilliant plan to
pass on his fortune to his friend when
he dies. But, once married, his health
very inconsiderately begins to mend.
Fully recovered, poor Dionysius Wood
bury, that is the American's name,
finds someone else's fiancee on his
hands as his own wife.
Considerable credit must be given
author Willie Collier for getting his
characters safely out of this seem
ingly inextricable muddle. He does
it, however, but. it takes him three
acts to perform the feat.
Ticket drawings for tne 1922 pro
duction will be held tomorrow at 1
o'clock at Crandall's in Palo Alto and
at the Bookstore on the campus. Fol
lowing this seats will be on sale at
these places until the night of the
show.
