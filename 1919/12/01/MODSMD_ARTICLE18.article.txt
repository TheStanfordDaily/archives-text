# THE 						LAST LAP
## 
### 
fFHE excitement of the Big Game over, the athletic season waning, and our
* Thanksgiving vacation behind us, we enter on the last lap. We consider
it opportune to call attention to this very important fact, and to sound a
warning to those of us who may procrastinate until it is too late.
Primarily we all came here to learn, to improve outselves intellectually,
and in our outside activities, we gain much. However, our University work
should be considered the principal task of our college life. If we fail in
this, we are failures in college without question. It is impossible to be sue
cessful in the Uuniversity while at the same time failing in the University
work. We now have but two more weeks of classes before we will be called
upon to stand the test of final examination. It is a splendid time to take
stock, to take an inventory of our own omissions and to make the neces
sary corrections.
It is remarkable what can be accomplished in two weeks. There are
few of us so far below the passing line, but that we can pull up in this
last stretch. Stanford spirit is known throughout the country; the ability
of Cardinal teams to come from behind is proved time and time again. What,
splendid results could be obtained scholastically if we used this same spirit
in our college work, as well as in our college play. We are on the lost
lap, and for many, the work of these last two weeks means either success or
failure at Stanford. Let us collectively realize the importance of the situa
tion and reduce the percentage of those who will suffer from the faculty axe.
