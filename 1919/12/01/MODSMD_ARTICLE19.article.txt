# ISADORA DUNCAN TO APPEAR HERE WITH DANCERS THURSDAY
## 
### 
Season tickets for the Peninsula
Musical Association's course of four
concerts, which opens Thursday even
ing with the Isadora Duncan dancers
and George Copeland, are still for
sale at the Bookstore and at Cran
dall's, where single seats for the com
ing performance may also be purchas
ed by non-subscribers.
The graceful exponents of the inter
pretative dance were trained by Isa
dora Duncan in her school at Belle
view for several years and are carry
ing on the artistic methods of their
famous teacher. Their success in
New York and other eastern cities was
instant, and their first triumphs have
been followed by continous popularity.
George Copeland is a pianist of not
able achievements, a Chopin player

of ability, whose readings of the
modern composers are also authorita
tive and interesting. He will introduce
to us Eric Satie, that mocking ironist
in music, and will play his own tran
s ription of Debussy's "Prelude a
l'apres-midi d'un faune." His readings
of Debussy have been warmly com
mended by many critics for the suc
cess with which he conveys the poetic
spirit, the dreaminess of thought and
suggestion, the mirage and atmosphere
of this impressionist.
The program to be presented in the
Assembly Hall, Thursday evening is
an exceptionally fine one â€”the same
that was presented in San Francisco
for their opening recital on Sunday.
