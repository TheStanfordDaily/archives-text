# Anzacs Win and Olympics Lose to Stanford in Rugby
## 
### 
Stanford was defeated by the Davis
Farm Anzacs on the Ilugby fleld, at
Sacramento, Thanksgiving afternoon,
S to 3, but recouped her loss at the
expense of the winged "O" fifteen, by
smothering the club men 30 to 5, on
the local field, Saturday afternoon.
In the first contest, unfavorable
weather hindered good play, and, in
spite of a large seat sale, no more
than two hundred spectators witnessed
the match. The Anzacs, greatly im
proved since their last encounter with
Stanford, took advantage of a tempo
rary slump on the part of the uni
versity fifteen, to check the Stanford
forwards, and score the eight points
that won the contest. L. Rodgers, at
three-quarters, Lynn at half hack, and
Wienn at forward, featured for Stan
ford, and helped check further scor
ing by the Anzacs. Stanford was
weakened by the inabilitiy of part of
the squad to make the trip.
A stronger team faced the Olympic
Club here on Saturday, and the Club
men were at no time threatening.
Poor condition seems to have account
ed for their defeat, added to the im
proved team-work of the Cardinal fif
teen.
California has reopened negotiations
for a rugby match this quarter, and
arrangements are in progress of com
pletion, whereby Coach Wylie's squad
will encounter the Berkeley team
next Saturday in its big game of the
season.
