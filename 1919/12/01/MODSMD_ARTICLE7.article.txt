# CALIFORNIA-STANFORD ATHLETIC RELATIONS RESUMED
## ACCEPT OUR APOLOGIES Wilbur Expresses Hope That New Tradition Will be Established 
### 
Intercollegiate relations between the
University of California and Stanford,
which automatically came to an end as
a result of the invasion of the Berkeley
campus by Stanford students before the
Big Game, were resumed during the
Thanksgiving vacation period, and are
once again normal. The California
authorities agreed to accept Stanford's
apologies for the invasion and to con
sider the matter at an end.
The new Men's Council of Student
Control, however, is continuing its ef
forts to ascertain the names of the Stan
ford men who invaded the Berkeley
campus. It is expected that the council
will be able to announce the names of
the men shortly and that a severe pun
ishment will be meted out to them.
As far as the University of Califor
nia is concerned, the matter
to an end in a letter from Ralph P.
Merritt, of the University of California,
to President Ray Lyman Wilbur, in
which Merritt said that he regretted
the incident and expressed a hope that
there would not be a re-occurrence.
As an outgrowth of the recent sever
ance of athletic relations, a new course
of action is being considered for the
future if any future action should be
necessary. This course of action was
proposed by Merritt and is that there be
a conference between the two institu
tions and that the matter also be sub
mitted to the centrol authorities of the
Pacific Coast Conference. This pro
posal has met with "the earnest ap
proval" of President Wilbur, as shown
by the following reply from President
Wilbur to Merritt:
Thank you for your kind letter of
November 25, dealing with the inter
collegiate relations hetvveen Stanford
and California. T appreciate particu
larly the generous courtesy shown by
you and your fellow members of the
Administrative Board, and wish to ex
press my willingness to promptly accede
to the hope expressed in your closing
sentence, "that normal athletic relations
between the two universities should be
continued." We were anxious to do our
full duty in the unpleasant situation
which confronted us. I recognize the
points of view brought out by you and
am pleased that because of them you
are willing to overlook such an unfor
tunate circumstance as that produced
by the unjustifiable and unwarrantable
act of vandalism in connection with the
University of California campus. I note
also that you leave to the Stanford au
thorities the question of adequate pun
ishment for the wrong done. We are
endeavoring to the best of our ability to
ascertain the names of the students re
sponsible. Personally, I am hopeful that
the men themselves will comc forward
and manfully admit their guilt and take
the consequences. I feel with you that
this whole set of circumstances will re
sult in a tradition of rcspect for univer
sity property that will become firmly im
bedded in the thought and action of the
students of both university.
Your recommendation for any future
action that may be necessary in connec
tion with the severance of intercollegi
ate relations meets with my earnest ap
proval and T will endeavor to see that
the conditions outlined by you are met;
i. c., that there be a conference between
the two institutions and that also the
matter be submitted to the central au
thorities of the Pacific Coast Intercol
legiate Conference.
i have presented your communication
to the Stanford Board of Athletic Con
trol and have also taken up with them
this reply. We have the hope that the
relationships now re-established will run
a long and happy course. If we can
approach the high standard set by the
splendid game of last Saturday we shall
do all that can be asked.

Control, however, is continuing its ef
forts to ascertain the names of the Stan
ford men who invaded the Berkeley
campus. It is expected that the council
will be able to announce the names of
the men shortly and that a severe pun
ishment will be meted out to them.
As far as the University of Califor
nia is concerned, the matter
to an end in a letter from Ralph P.
Merritt, of the University of California,
to President Ray Lyman Wilbur, in
which Merritt said that he regretted
the incident and expressed a hope that
there would not be a re-occurrence.
As an outgrowth of the recent sever
ance of athletic relations, a new course
of action is being considered for the
future if any future action should be
necessary. This course of action was
proposed by Merritt and is that there be
a conference between the two institu
tions and that the matter also be sub
mitted to the centrol authorities of the
Pacific Coast Conference. This pro
posal has met with "the earnest ap
proval" of President Wilbur, as shown
by the following reply from President
Wilbur to Merritt:
Thank you for your kind letter of
November 25, dealing with the inter
collegiate relations hetvveen Stanford
and California. T appreciate particu
larly the generous courtesy shown by
you and your fellow members of the
Administrative Board, and wish to ex
press my willingness to promptly accede
to the hope expressed in your closing
sentence, "that normal athletic relations
between the two universities should be
continued." We were anxious to do our
full duty in the unpleasant situation
which confronted us. I recognize the
points of view brought out by you and
am pleased that because of them you
are willing to overlook such an unfor
tunate circumstance as that produced
by the unjustifiable and unwarrantable
act of vandalism in connection with the
University of California campus. I note
also that you leave to the Stanford au
thorities the question of adequate pun
ishment for the wrong done. We are
endeavoring to the best of our ability to
ascertain the names of the students re
sponsible. Personally, I am hopeful that
the men themselves will comc forward
and manfully admit their guilt and take
the consequences. I feel with you that
this whole set of circumstances will re
sult in a tradition of rcspect for univer
sity property that will become firmly im
bedded in the thought and action of the
students of both university.
Your recommendation for any future
action that may be necessary in connec
tion with the severance of intercollegi
ate relations meets with my earnest ap
proval and T will endeavor to see that
the conditions outlined by you are met;
i. c., that there be a conference between
the two institutions and that also the
matter be submitted to the central au
thorities of the Pacific Coast Intercol
legiate Conference.
i have presented your communication
to the Stanford Board of Athletic Con
trol and have also taken up with them
this reply. We have the hope that the
relationships now re-established will run
a long and happy course. If we can
approach the high standard set by the
splendid game of last Saturday we shall
do all that can be asked.
Intercollegiate relations between the
University of California and Stanford,
which automatically came to an end as
a result of the invasion of the Berkeley
campus by Stanford students before the
Big Game, were resumed during the
Thanksgiving vacation period, and are
once again normal. The California
authorities agreed to accept Stanford's
apologies for the invasion and to con
sider the matter at an end.

Control, however, is continuing its ef
