# CALIFORNIA-STANFORD ATHLETIC RELATIONS RESUMED
## ACCEPT OUR APOLOGIES Wilbur Expresses Hope That New Tradition Will be Established 
### 
Intercollegiate relations between the
University of California and Stanford,
which automatically came to an end as
a result of the invasion of the Berkeley
campus by Stanford students before the
Big Game, were resumed during the
Thanksgiving vacation period, and are
once again normal. The California
authorities agreed to accept Stanford's
apologies for the invasion and to con
sider the matter at an end.
The new Men's Council of Student
Control, however, is continuing its ef
forts to ascertain the names of the Stan
ford men who invaded the Berkeley
campus. It is expected that the council
will be able to announce the names of
the men shortly and that a severe pun
ishment will be meted out to them.
As far as the University of Califor
nia is concerned, the matter
to an end in a letter from Ralph P.
Merritt, of the University of California,
to President Ray Lyman Wilbur, in
which Merritt said that he regretted
the incident and expressed a hope that
there would not be a re-occurrence.
As an outgrowth of the recent sever
ance of athletic relations, a new course
of action is being considered for the
future if any future action should be
necessary. This course of action was
proposed by Merritt and is that there be
a conference between the two institu
tions and that the matter also be sub
mitted to the centrol authorities of the
Pacific Coast Conference. This pro
posal has met with "the earnest ap
proval" of President Wilbur, as shown
by the following reply from President
Wilbur to Merritt:
