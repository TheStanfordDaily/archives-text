# ENGLISH ECONOMIST WILL SPEAK TONIGHT
## Dr. T.A. Hobson Will Talk On Britain's Labor Problem 
### 
Dr. John A. Hobson, who will give
an address on "The New Industrial Rev
olution in Great Britain," at the Assem
bly Hall tonight at 7:30, is considered
by many to be one of the greatest writ
ers on democracy, international law, and
economic subjects in Great Britain.
Until recently, when he was made a
member of the Whitby Conference, an
important board of labor adjustments,
Dr. Hobson was a professor of eco
nomics at the University of London. He
is known as one of the greatest liberals
in England.
Dr. Hobson is at present giving a few
weeks' course on new social and political
questions at the University of Califor
nia. It is for the purpose of making
these lectures on the important economic
problems in England today that he is
making his present tour of the United
States.
Although on the same general subject,
tonight's address will deal with different
aspects of the situation than were shown
in the recent lecture here on "Labor in
Great Britain," by A. F. Whyte, M. P.
