# INTERPRETIVE DANCERS TO APPEAR HERE THURSDAY
## PROGRAM TO BE UNIQUE George Copeland, Pianist, Is To Be Presented On Same Bill 
### 
'THE Isadora Duncan dancers, who will
appear in a joint recital with George
Copeland, pianist, Thursday night under
the auspices of the Peninsula Musical
Association, have had the personal and
inspired supervision of their teacher
since early childhood, and have devoted
their lives to their art.
The performance will take the nature
of a concert interpreted by the sister
art of the dance. The interpretations of
these six girls is unlike anything usu
ally seen on the stage. It is not the stilt
ed toe dancing of the ballet type, to
which the theatres have accustomed us.
but a dance which has its inspiration in
Nature.
The dancers appear sometimes in
groups, sometimes singly. With their
lithe young bodies free to interpret the
various emotions called up by the mu
sic, they dance bart - footed as the
nymphs one sees pictured on some Greek
vase or antique frieze.
