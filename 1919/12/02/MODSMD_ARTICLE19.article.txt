k NNOUNCEMENT comes from the Board of Trustees that a new scholarship
has been presented to the University, and that two substantial gifts in
money have been made by members of the alumni. This announcement is
pleasing in itself, but more so in the light of what the continuance of these
donations will mean for Stanford. The University's financial difficulties came
to light in the controversy over the installation of the tuition system, and
it was during this same time that Herbert Hoover, the most illustrious of
our graduates, said that the present Stanford alumni could not be counted
on for any material assistance for a number of years.
Stanford is a comparatively young institution, and probably Mr. Hoover,
and others who agree with him are right in that our alumni need a few
more years before the University can count on them for any great help.
However, gifts such as those accepted by the Board of Trustees at their
monthly meeting conducted in San Francisco last Friday, tend to show that
our alumni can already be listed as prospects for immediate assistance. It
is a splendid thing for an alumnus to prove his love for his university in
this way, even though it be done at a slight sacrifice, for will it not be a
sacrifice for many to come to the university of their choice when it will
mean an added expenditure of from $120 to $160 a year? As students we
are glad to see our alumni helping Stanford. Other great universities have
had to face the same cut in the purchasing power of their annual incomes,
coupled with a necessary raise in the salaries of their professors. The situa
tion has been met by the alumni in almost every case, and it is with a
distinct sense of pleasure that we see that our alumni can, and are willing
to bear some of the brunt of the high cost of education.
