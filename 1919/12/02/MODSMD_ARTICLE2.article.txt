club tour the southern part of Califor
nia, and also Washington and Oregon.
Permanent rehearsal dates with War
ren D. Allen, have been set for Monday
afternoons at 5 o'clock and Wednesday
afternoons at 4:45 o'clock. President
George Luhrs, '18, wants every member
of the cluli to be present at this Wednes

business relative to next quarter's trips
will be discussed.
More first tenors are needed to fill the
club's membership. Those wishing to
try out must appear at one of this week's
rehearsals. Members of the club who
fail to report to their hi-weekly prac
tices will be dropped to make room for
those who are anxious to get in at the
firsj opening.
