### Ivan Benson, '18 
Mrs. Somebody once said that Chinese
music must be heavenly because it is
unearthly. She must have rambled
through Chinatown at some time or
other. After hearing the Chinese music
we thought of something other than
heaven or earth—and it sounded like
that.

Wliilc rushing through this part of
'Frisco —on a street car, of course—one
may see a picture of Alice Brady, beau
tiful and famous movie star, hanging
over the entrance of what used to be a
movie show. Oh, Alice, where art thou?

One of the crowd claimed linguistic
distinction. A Chinaman gargled out
something. "Did you hear that,
Whit? The Chink asked you to come
in and have a drink." "Not so you'd
notice it," said the linguist, "he didn't
say that. I can understand that in any
language."
