# DR. H.R. FAIRCLOUGH STILL IN THE BALKANS
## 
### 
Dr. H. R, Fairclough, head of the
Latin Department and now in charge of
the Red Cross relief work in Monte
negro, has been asked by that organiza
tion to remain at his post through the
winter and spring. The work will not
be closed until July 1, and the Red Cross
authorities are very eager to have him
remain in charge until the end. The
Montenegro unit of the Red Cross relief
has been raised to the status of a com
mission, which gives Professor Fair
clough the title of commissioner, with
the rank of lieutenant colonel.
