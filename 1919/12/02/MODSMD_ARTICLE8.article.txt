# STANFORD RUGBY TEAM CLASHES WITH U.C. ON SATURDAY
## WYLIE VERY OPTIMISTIC Comparative Strength Of the Rival Varsities Is An Open Question 
### 
CTANFORD and California will meet
on the rugby field at Berkeley Sat
urday afternoon at three o'clock, accord
ing to the definite announcement made
this morning by Plarry Maloney. Amos
Elliott, ex-California rugby captain, has
been asked to referree. The rUgby fif
teen is to accompany the soccer team to
Berkeley, and the two will stage a dou
ble attraction in the afternoon's play.
The rugby contest will not interfere
with the "big" game series planned for
the winter quarter between the two uni
versities, for the latter will be played
under the auspices of the University
rugby league, while the present game
is more in the nature of informal com
petition. It will, however, serve as a
means of estimating the strength of both
Stanford and California, and the winner
will enter league competition a favorite.
Rugby enthusiasts are still numerous
in both universities, and a large attend
ance is prophesied for the game, which
will hold the sport limelight on Satur
day. Jim Wylie, varsity j:oach, is opti
mistic over the outlook for Stanford,
in view of the excellent showing made
by the fifteen in its game with the Olym
pic Club last week.
Another big event of the rugby sea
son will be the team's trip to Vancouver
during the Christmas vacation. A wire
confirming the arrangements for a three
game series, was received here yester-
day. The team will play at Vancouver j
on Christmas Day, on December 27, and
on New Year's Day, spending a fort
night in the north.
The completed schedule for this quar
ter and the next insure rugby the long
est season of any university sport. So
far, save for the defeat by the Anzacs
on Thanksgiving. Stanford has been uni
formly successful. The line-up for the
the California game will be given out
tomorrow.
