# GIFT WILL ENABLE THE UNION TO BUILD GARDENS
## ALUMNUS GIVES $750 TO COMMITTEE Donor Wishes to Remain Anonymous; Is Sent Appreciation 
### 
rÂ»ASH to the amount of $750 has been
given to the Stanford Union by an
alumnus who wishes to remain ano
nymous. This is one of the largest
gifts that has been made to the Union
and the Executive Cbmmittee feels
that it is evidence that the alumni
and friends of Stanford are ready to
give financial aid.
The committee in expressing grati
tude to the donor through President
Wilbur, announced its intention to
use a part of the money to establish
a long-desired garden which has been
their wish for some time, but for
which funds were not available.
In this connection, the committee's
letter to Dr. Wilbur said: "It is esti
mated that the initial cost of the
garden will be about $500, but the com
mittee would like to feel free to use
either more or less of the $750 for
garden improvement. A map of the
Union grounds has been made, and
Professor Abrams of the Botany de
partment and Mr. Staniford of the
Union are now waiting for the assist
ance of Mr. John McLaren, the land
scape engineer. Mr. McLaren is count
ed upon to outline the planting
scheme.
"The $250, or whatever sum is not
used for the garden, would be well
spent for wooden floors on the Union
porches, and for porch furniture.
Many man have always been attracted
to use the porches in spring and sum
mer. Wear and tear on chairs taken
outside from the clubrooms has been
considerable, and the tar flooring on
the porches has suffered.
"Though garden and porches are
contemplated as the two parts of the
Union equipment which will be im
proved by this gift, it is possible that
some other use may be found. If the
money is not used as suggested in this
letter, we shall notify you in order
that the donor may be informed."
