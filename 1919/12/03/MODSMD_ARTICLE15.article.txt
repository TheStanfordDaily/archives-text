# INDUSTRIAL PEACE IS PREDICTED BY HOBSON
## NOTED ECONOMIST GIVES OWN VIEWS Expects Capital and Labor to Devise Post-War Basis 
### 
«¥ do not believe in the necessity for
war in industry any more than war
between nations, for harmony between
capital and labor can be established
by broad-minded people," said Dr. John
A. Hobson, in describing the economic
conditions the war has brought on, in
his lecture on "The New Industrial
Revolution in Great Britain," last
night.
"There are new situations of both
capital and labor which prevent a re
turn to pre-war conditions," he said.
"The employers' class during the war
turned from free competition to com
binations and associations, not only
in the manufacture of war supplies
but in other lines of industry as well.
The trade unions have developed
rapidly to maintain the higher stand
ards of living that the workmen were
accustomed to during the war, when
not only the wages were raised but
the whole family worked."
The third factor in the changed
conditions, he went on to explain, is
the government, which, in order to
continue to subsidize labor housing,
to better provide for education and to
carry on a number of new schemes,
will need more money than the pre
war income.
Dr. Hobson declared that the de
mands of capital, labor and govern
ment could be all met through in
creased production. In order to se
cure this (increased production, he
said it would be necessary to secure
co-operation and maintain harmony
