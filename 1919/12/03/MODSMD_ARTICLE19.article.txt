# POSTERS AND LIGHT-FINGERED STUDENTS
## 
### 
HlO advertise the Sophomore Play, the second-year class has been put to a
considerable expense and certain of its members have devoted hours of
valuable time in the making of the posters that now placard the Quad.
Scarcely had these posters been put up, before two of them were stolen. We
have complained previously about the lack of moral responsibility of some
of our students, and it is with regret that we feel called upon to enter another
protest. Why is it that our college students have this failing? Stealing is
stealing in the university just as surely as it is outside. The value of the
posiers to the individual or individuals who made away with them can not
be high, while to the Sophomore Class, they mean a great deal. Doubtless
those who took these posters did it in a thoughtless manner, litttle consider
ing or thinking about the matter. But that is just the trouble. We come to
college to learn to think, and a "I didn't think about it" or a "I forgot"
excuse should have less weight in a university community than anywhere
else.
The President of the Sophomore Class has requested that the posters be
returned to the chairman of the play committee as soon as possible, and
it seems to us now that this is the only decent recompense possible for
those light-fingered students to make.
