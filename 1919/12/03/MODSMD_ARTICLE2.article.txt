# RAIN HINDERS FINAL PRACTICE OF RUGBY TEAM
## 
### 
Weather, the factor that has thrown
itself in the balance against the Cardi
nal teams in their last contests, has been
hindering the rugby fifteen in its final
practices before the California battle.
Hoth the soccer and rugby teams have
been prevented from putting the finish
ing touches on tbeir plays and teamwork
for the past two days, by rain and a
slippery field.
In the opinion of the rugby coaches,
Stanford will depend upoit her backs
to smash the opposition of the Blue and
Gold, and execute tbe plays that will
mean victory. The forwards, this year,
are a little lighter than usual, and the
fifteen will go into the California game
several pounds lighter than its oppo
nents.
Two wins over the Olympic Club, an
even break with the Anzacs, and several
victories over San Mateo and Palo Alto
high schools will send the Farm team
to Berkeley a slight favorite for the
game. Climatic conditions and a weak
ened line-up discount the single defeat
of the fifteen in its Thanksgiving game
with the Australians. In spite of a long
season of play, the coaches believe the
men to be at the height of condition.
The line-up will not be released by
Coach Wylie till tomorrow afternoon,
according to his statement this after
noon. The unsatisfactory work-outs of
the past few days have held him back in
his choice of the men who will start the
game.
The rugby squad will leave for Van
couver on the 22nd, and will spend the
time remaining before its first game
with the northerners in resting after its
long trip.
