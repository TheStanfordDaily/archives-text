# RAIN HINDERS FINAL PRACTICE OF RUGBY TEAM
## 
### 
Weather, the factor that has thrown
itself in the balance against the Cardi
nal teams in their last contests, has been
hindering the rugby fifteen in its final
practices before the California battle.
Hoth the soccer and rugby teams have
been prevented from putting the finish
ing touches on tbeir plays and teamwork
for the past two days, by rain and a
slippery field.
In the opinion of the rugby coaches,
Stanford will depend upoit her backs
to smash the opposition of the Blue and
Gold, and execute tbe plays that will
mean victory. The forwards, this year,
are a little lighter than usual, and the
fifteen will go into the California game
several pounds lighter than its oppo
nents.
Two wins over the Olympic Club, an
even break with the Anzacs, and several
victories over San Mateo and Palo Alto
high schools will send the Farm team
to Berkeley a slight favorite for the
game. Climatic conditions and a weak
ened line-up discount the single defeat
