# Eighteen Are Elected Into Phi Delta Phi
## 
### 
Eighteen law majors were parading
the campus this morning in various
garbs of clothing, prior to their initia
tio ninto Phi Delta Phi this evening.
"Life at Little Leland Junior Univer
sity in 1923," was the title of their
show, which didn't appear on the
campus on account of the ruling
against public initiations.
However, the legal lights produced
a show without words on the law
steps, dealing with the passing of the
public initiations from the campus.
On the steps of the Post Office the
mourners completed their late rites to
the bereavement of the show.
Those elected to Phi Delta Phi are:
E. A. Wells, '14; E. H. Henderson, '15;
W. A. Boekel, '17; T. S. Wallace, '17;
F. F. Chase, '18; F. L. Bonney, '18;
J. F. Reynolds, '18; B. C. Wohlford, '18;
E. M. Mitchell, '19; R. B.* Jarvis, '20;
L. L. Pickering, '20; W. H. Sheldon, '20;
W. M. Stamps, '20; M. A. Kline, '21;
