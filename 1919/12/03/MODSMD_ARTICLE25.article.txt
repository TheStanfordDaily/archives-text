### 
A bulletin of vocational information
has been prepared by the Committee on
Vocational Guidance for the purpose of
helping students in the choice of a voca
tion and in arranging courses of study
suitable for the vocations which Univer
sity graduates enter.
Any one interested in these matters
may obtain a copy of the bulletin by ap
plying at the Registrar's office. Stu
dents are urged to make use of the bulle
tin and to send it to some friend who
might come to the University.
