# BASKETBALL LEAGUE IS ARRANGED FOR WINTER

Immediately following the close of the
interclass basketball series which starts

round-robin of games that will run thru
a period of ten weeks.
The llftv teams representing the dif
ferent living groups will be divided and
formed into five leagues.
From the five leagues five champion
teams will result, and they will later be
brought together to determine the cham

According to this arrangement <>*1v

of the league teams may register for
basketball and so receive physical train
