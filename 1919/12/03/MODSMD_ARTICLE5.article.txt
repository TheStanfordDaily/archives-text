# Duncan Dancers Announce Program
## Work of Artists Is Highly Praised by Eastern Critics 
### 
Critics have united in praising the
art of the Isadora Duncan dancers and
George Copeland, pianist, who will ap
pear here in joint concert on Thursday
evening. The New York Sun has said:
"The Isadora Duncan dancers have that
beauty in symbolic expression that is
difficult to attain. It is a pleasure to
view them. There is no getting away
from the fact that they have a command
of the body, as reflected in the graceful
movements that characterize their steps,
that is remarkably effective. No matter
whether they attempt to symbolize joy
or grief or what they sooth and comfort.
Which is doubtless the reason why they
were such a decided success."
