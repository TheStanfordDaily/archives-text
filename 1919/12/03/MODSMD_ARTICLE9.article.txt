# SOPHOMORE PLAY WILL FEATURE BABY VAMPIRE
## PRODUCTION IS SET FOR FRIDAY NIGHT Cast Includes Character Parts Of Unusual Interest From "Never Say Die," which the Sophomore Class will present Next Friday Night 
### 
STAMPIRES are getting to almost un
* avoidable in modern comedy, and
"Never Say Die," Willie Collier's com
edy that the Sophomores will pro
duce in the Assembly Hall, Friday,
is no exception to this rule. How
ever, the 1922 production has only
one of this species and, which is still
better, she is not quite as deadly as
the usual run of "vampers."
This strenuous part is taken by Miss

Melba Berry in the role of "La Cigale"
a dancer. "Vamping," according to
the best, authorities is no easy job,
and the task of being a "baby vamp"
presents even more difficulties to the
amateur actress, still Miss Berry
seems to have fallen into the part with
a natural grace that makes her bid


A JOYOUS MOMENT
fair to be the sensation of the even
ing.
A number of interesting character
parts will be another feature of the
Sophomore Play. Of these, perhaps
the most individual is that of "Dr.
Galesby," played by S. W. Harrison.
The fun in this role lies mainly in
the English brand of belated humor
that occurs in his lines. Galesby is
that innocent type of individual that
wiil blandly respond when asked if
his father discovered America, that
it happened long before his father's
time.
John Lambie, as "Griggs" has a
choice little part, as an efficient Eng
lish vatel. His mannerisms in carry
ing out this role make him inimitable.
Richard Blood, who has the part of
the sprightly young artist, should
be another comedy hit.
Seats for "Never Say Die" are still
on sale at the Bookstore and at Cran
dall's, Palo Alto.
