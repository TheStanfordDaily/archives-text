At last Dame Winter has arrived, with her trunk full of chilly winds and drenching rains.—We begin to think of keeping warm and
dry, and we want to without looking like a Cape Cod fisherman in his "Sou'ester and Slicker.''

are just the thing, they keep you dry as Prohibition and warm as Toast.
Form-Fitting Coats —Single and Double-Breasted; Chesterfields, loosely draped Coats; Ulsters, great Coats.
