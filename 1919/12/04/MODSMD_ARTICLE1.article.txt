# WRITER FOR REVIEW WOULD GIVE "SMOKE UP" TEST TO FACULTY
## DONALDSON IS AUTHOR Kinney Thinks University Should Employ Coach For Dramatics 
### 
Acting on the theoiy that "turn about
is fair play," R. A. Donaldson, '18, has
written an article under the title "Smok
ing up the Profs," for the December
Illustrated Review, in which he proposes
to have the students select faculty can
didates for "smoke up" honors.
Donaldson's plan is to have the student
body submit a list of professors each
quarter who qualify as "smoke - up
profs." Those of the faculty who no
longer pass as professors in the opinion
of the voters, can in this manner be re
minded of their failings. Ihe idea of
making the present system work both
ways is the result of remarks made by a
number of service men who returned to
find Stanford possessing professors that
were, in their opinion, not professors.
Another feature of this issue of the
Review will be the four center pages
of illustrations which will picture the
big game instead of explaining it by
story. The magazine also contains a
cut of the first airplane view of the
Campus.
R. W. Kenny, '21, has written an arti
cle in which he suggests that a perma
nent dramatic coach be added to the
faculty at Stanford. His reason for this
is the fact that a regular coach paid by
the University will do much more to
ward promoting dramatics at Stanford
than the present plan of having each
organization and class pay a large lump
sum to a professional coach.
