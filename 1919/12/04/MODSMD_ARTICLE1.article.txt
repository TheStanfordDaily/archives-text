# WRITER FOR REVIEW WOULD GIVE "SMOKE UP" TEST TO FACULTY
## DONALDSON IS AUTHOR Kinney Thinks University Should Employ Coach For Dramatics 
### 
Acting on the theoiy that "turn about
is fair play," R. A. Donaldson, '18, has
written an article under the title "Smok
ing up the Profs," for the December
Illustrated Review, in which he proposes
to have the students select faculty can
didates for "smoke up" honors.
Donaldson's plan is to have the student
body submit a list of professors each
quarter who qualify as "smoke - up
profs." Those of the faculty who no
longer pass as professors in the opinion
of the voters, can in this manner be re
minded of their failings. Ihe idea of
making the present system work both
ways is the result of remarks made by a
number of service men who returned to
find Stanford possessing professors that
were, in their opinion, not professors.
Another feature of this issue of the
Review will be the four center pages
