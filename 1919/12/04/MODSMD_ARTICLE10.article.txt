# POSTAL CARDS TO BE SOLD FOR ORPHANS
## 
### 
Members of the Delta Gamma sorori
ty will start a campaign this week for
the benefit of Holland's orphan children.
Postal cards will be sold as a means
of raising funds and it is hoped that the
students will respond willingly to aid
the thousands of homeless children that
have been left in Holland as a result of
the war. The cards will be placed on
sale immediately, and will be sold until
the end of the quarter.
