# SQUAD WILL ELECT NEW VARSITY PILOT
## 
### 
A football captain will be elected to
morrow at 4:30 p. r.i., when the squad
meets at the Encina gymnasium. It has
been customary to elect a varsity man
to pilot the taking of the squad photo
graph for the yearbook. As Coach
Evans is absent in Los Angeles the pic
ture has been postponed, and the new
skipper will be elected at the gym to
morrow.
