# P.C.C. WILL HOLD IMPORTANT MEET TOMORROW NIGHT
## BROWNE IS DELEGATE Important Rules Regulating College Sports Will Be Passed 
### 
Dr. A. D. Browne left yesterday for
Seattle to attend the meeting of the
Pacific Coast Conference, as a delegate
representing Stanford. The session,
opens tomorrow night, will be the most
important of the year, and will pass
many resolutions bearing directly on in
tercollegiate sport.
The committees, appointed by the con
ference to look into various matters
under discussion at its last meeting, will
make their reports, and action by the
legislative body will follow.
One of the most important steps to
be taken is the shaping of the conference
schedule in American football for next
season's play. Several applications for
admission to the conference will be con
sidered, chief among them that of the
L'niversity of Southern California, the
strongest of the southern universities.
Another important feaure of the meet
ing will be the incorporation or rejec
tion of rugby and boxing as conference
sports. The status of water-polo in in
tercollegiate competition will also be de
termined.
An attempt will be made to recognize
the eligibility of hold-overs—who are
at present unable to compete on varsity
teams —and to place them on an equal
footing with the remainder of the col
lege classes.
Practically the only point of import
ance to coast athletics upon which the
conference will not touch, is the selec
tion of the football team which will
meet Harvard at Pasadena on New
Year's day, in the East vs. West contest.
Recommendations may be sent to the
management of the Carnival of Roses;
but the final choice lies there.
Several other matters relating to
minor sports will be considered. By
means of its rulings, the conference will
tighten its grip on coast sports.
Faculty delegates compose the greater
part of its body, and student-managers
constitute the remainder. On account of
Walter Ames' inability to attend, Dr.
Brown is the sole official representative
from Stanford. Dr. Frank Angell ac
companies him as a visitor.
