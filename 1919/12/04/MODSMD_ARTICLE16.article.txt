Dr. A. D. Browne left yesterday for
Seattle to attend the meeting of the
Pacific Coast Conference, as a delegate
representing Stanford. The session,
opens tomorrow night, will be the most
important of the year, and will pass
many resolutions bearing directly on in
tercollegiate sport.
The committees, appointed by the con
ference to look into various matters
under discussion at its last meeting, will
make their reports, and action by the
legislative body will follow.
One of the most important steps to
be taken is the shaping of the conference
schedule in American football for next
season's play. Several applications for
admission to the conference will be con
sidered, chief among them that of the
L'niversity of Southern California, the
strongest of the southern universities.
Another important feaure of the meet
ing will be the incorporation or rejec
tion of rugby and boxing as conference
sports. The status of water-polo in in
tercollegiate competition will also be de
termined.
An attempt will be made to recognize
the eligibility of hold-oversâ€”who are
at present unable to compete on varsity
