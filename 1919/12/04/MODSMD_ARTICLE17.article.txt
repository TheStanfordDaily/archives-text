# Pianist and Dancers Will Appear Tonight
## Isadora Duncan Performers In Joint Program With George Copeland 
### 
The Isadora Duncan dancers and
George Copeland will appear in their
joint recital tonight at 8:15 in the As
sembly Hall, in an interesting program
of interpretative dances and pianistic
artistry.
The success of this ensemble through
out the east has been extraordinary and
I the six graceful dancers have been hailed
as worthy exponents of the ideas of
their famous teacher, Isadora Duncan.
George Copeland is an American pian
ist of distinction, whose readings have
â–  individuality and charm.
The New York Evening Post has said
of this concert: "Mr. Copeland's playing
bewitchcd the very excelleii. dancing of
these six young nymphs imo something
faerie. Chopin, Debussy, Schubert, spun
by deft finger-tips, make a good veil of
beauty for interpretative dancing. These
young ladies, trained by Isadora Dun
\ can, understand that their best efforts
are accomplished by what appear to be
I perfectly unstudied, wayward steps and
postures, as of dryads cavorting about
on a green. The color comb-nations of
drapery and background helped com-
I plete the rcvcry." *
