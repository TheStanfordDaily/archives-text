# A
						MORE EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION
## 
### 
II7HEN the twenty dollar incidental fee is paid by the students at the open
ing of each quarter, one dollar goes to the Union fund. Of this money,
there is an unequal distribution, which is now working to the disadvantage of
one of our best institutions. Because there are nineteen hundred men in
the University, and but five hundred women $1900 is turned over to the Men's
Union, and $500 to the Women's Club House. On the surface this might
appear to be an equitable distribution, but it is an evil that should immedi
ately be eradicated.
The Union has several sources of income, derived from the rent of the
Union Cafe, offices, and rooms, while the Women's Club House has no
other revenue. The Union has repeatedly been the recipient of cash dona
tions, $750 having been given to its fund two days ago by an old alumnus.
The books of the Union, according to a member of the Board of Governors,
show a total of over $2400 assets this quarter, while the expenses do not
come near this sum. The Women's Club House is badly in need of funds
The salaries paid for its upkeep are entirely insufficient, and with an added
income, many additional features could be added to the already splendid
work accomplished there.
Of the two institutions, the Women's Club House plays a far more im
portant part in the life of the University. Social events, committee meet
ings alumni gatherings, and organization meetings of both men and women
students take place there, and it is only just that the money taken in from
the incidental fees be divided equally between these two funds.
