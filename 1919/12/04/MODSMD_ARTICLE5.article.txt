# Formation of Rugby League is Assured
## Winning Organization Will Be Awarded Double Trophy 
### 
Plans for the formation of a Northern
California Rugby League which were
initiated a few weeks ago by Dr. A. D.
Browne and Trainer Harry Maloney,
have progressed to the point where the
; perfection of the league is a certainty.
Of the organizations necessary to fill
out the league's schedule, the University
of California the Olympic Club, and the
lAnzac Club of the Davis Farm School
I have registered their intention of join
' ing the league. Santa Clara University
is expected to act favorably within a few
days.
The California Rugby Union, at its
i last meeting, decided to offer a double
| trophy to the team winning the cham
pionship of the league. A trophy will
be given to the team to be retained by
the school or club it represents, and
individual medals will be awarded teams
members to become their permanent
'possession.
