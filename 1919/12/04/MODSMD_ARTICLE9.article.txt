# COMEDY TALENT FEATURES LEADS OF 1922 SHOW
## COLLIER PLAY IS RICH Dress Rehearsal Wins Audience Points Towards Success Friday 
### 
Last night's dress rehearsal of "Never
Say Die," the play that the sophomores
will present tomorrow evening in the
Assembly Hall, seemed to prove the
prediction that the 1922 show ought to
be the laugh hit of the season. Clever
ness in plot, lines, and acting, is the
keynote of the production, according to
the verdict of the small audience that
viewed Coach Gordon Davis' cast in its
final practice.
English humor seems to have an in-

definable sort of charm for an American
audience, as much perhaps, as is the
charm of American humor on an Eng-

in his stage successes in New York and

this character is thrown, make him—that
is, "Dionysius Woodbury"—hold the
center of the interest throughout.
Manager Cupid of the sophomore play
reports a gratifying run on the box of
fices at the Bookstore and at Crandall's,
but says that a good many desirable
seats are still on sale.
