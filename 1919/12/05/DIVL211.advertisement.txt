Look Well and Fit Well
We can say that without fear of
contradiction from any quarter if
we have supplied the glasses.
Instead of detracting from one's
appearance, glasses more often
improve the appearance and add
an air of dignity.
If you need glasses you do your
self an injustice by putting off
the matter another day.
—Come and see us about it —
