# SCHOLARSHIPS OFFERED TO AID STUDENTS IN EXTRA FEE
## CARDINAL SPIRIT LAUDED Gift Made Provided Others Give Equivalent of Six Tuition Fees 
### 
For every forty-dollar tuition schol
arship up to three, during both the win
ter and spring quarters, a Stanford
student has written his intentions to
President Wilbur of equalling the value
for the same quarter. So impressed
with the Stanford democratic ideals, the
donator—who wishes his name to remain
anonymous—is taking advantage of the
tuition raise to help some needy student
through college.
A total of six scholarships will be
made by the donator—three in each of
the coming quarters — provided some
Stanford student or group of students
will make up the amount to the same
number of scholarships.
The students who will receive the
donations will be chosen in the same way
that other scholarships are awarded by
the faculty.
In the letter to the president he point
ed out the different student atmosphere
around Stanford, and the eastern uni
versities which he has attended, before
entering here this quarter. It was this
sitirit 1 ' him to make this offer.
