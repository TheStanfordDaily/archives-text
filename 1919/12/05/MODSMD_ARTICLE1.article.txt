# SCHOLARSHIPS OFFERED TO AID STUDENTS IN EXTRA FEE
## CARDINAL SPIRIT LAUDED Gift Made Provided Others Give Equivalent of Six Tuition Fees 
### 
For every forty-dollar tuition schol
arship up to three, during both the win
ter and spring quarters, a Stanford
student has written his intentions to
President Wilbur of equalling the value
for the same quarter. So impressed
with the Stanford democratic ideals, the
donator—who wishes his name to remain
anonymous—is taking advantage of the
tuition raise to help some needy student
through college.
A total of six scholarships will be
made by the donator—three in each of
the coming quarters — provided some
Stanford student or group of students
will make up the amount to the same
number of scholarships.
The students who will receive the
donations will be chosen in the same way
that other scholarships are awarded by
the faculty.
In the letter to the president he point
ed out the different student atmosphere
around Stanford, and the eastern uni
versities which he has attended, before
entering here this quarter. It was this
sitirit 1 ' him to make this offer.

Wilbur,

My Dear Dr. Wilbur:
Coming here this quarter from East
ern universities, I have hcen tremen-
clously impressed with the Stanford
spirit, different indeed in its democratic
good fellowship, but unique in its ideal
of personal service. To know this spirit
is to love it, and to love it is to further it.
My opportunity lias come with the in
stitution of the tuition fee, which I be
lieve will necessitate the withdrawal of
many worthy but needy students from
Stanford. In view of their immediate
necessity, which we Stanford students
feel so keenly, 1 make the following pro
posal :
For each forty-dollar ($4O) scholar
ship founded by a Stanford student, or
by a group or organization of Stanford
students, 1 will donate another of equal
value for the same quarter up to a total
of three, and the same proposal for the
spring quarter, making a sum total of
six.
I submit this proposition not as a pri
vate individual, but as a Stanford stu
dent—not for the sake of individual stu
dents, but for the sake of the "Spirit
of Stanford."
May I hope, my dear Dr. Wilbur, for
your approval of my project both as
plan and precedent?
ANON.
