# STANFORD RUGBY TEAM READY TO BATTLE CALIFORNIA
## HARD FIGHT PREDICTED Cardinal Backs Touted As Being the Decisive Factor 
### 
"Stanford will win!" is the key-note
of Coach Wylie's statement, made to
the Daily Palo Alto this afternoon, in
connection with the California-Stan
ford rugby match which will be play
ed tomorrow afternoon at 3 o'clock
p.m. at the Berkeley field.
Coaches Wylie and Maloney pro
nounced themselves entirely satisfied
with the last regular practice of the
fifteen, held yesterday afternoon. In
spite of a muddy field and a slippery
ball (he men executed their big game
plays without a slip, and appeared to
be in top form. Today's work-out will
be light, without scrimmaging. The
team leaves for Berkeley at eleven
o'clock in the morning.
Wylie's statement in full is as fol
lows:
"I am highly satisfied with the show
ing of the team. Yesterday's practice
was unusually good considering the
weather conditions. I feel certain
that we will register a win over Cali
fornia.
"We will depend to a great extent
011 our backs, and expect them to be
the deciding factors in the game. Our
forwards are light and fast, and the
backs will have to bear the brunt of
the attack.
"I do not feel that it would be fair
to the men who have worked faith
fully during the whole season, to put
in my line-up, at the last minute, any
of the former rugby stars who have
been playing American football this
year. Although they might be of ad
vantage to us, I shall not use them
on account of the above reason. The
others are to be considered first."
The veteran English rugby star, the
Reverend M. Mullineaux, will referee
the rugby game tomorrow in the place
of Amos Elliott, whose services could
not be secured. A large contingent of
Stanford supporters is expected to
make the trip to Berkeley, and cheer
the team. The line-up for Stanford
will be:
Fullback, Sherman; three-quarters,
Poster, Kelly, Morris; five-eighths,
Lynn, L. Rodgers; wingfield, Card;

forwards, Henry, Wrenn, Clark, James,
Hayes, Wallace and Malliott; substi
tutes, Duncan, Ratner, Stolz, Hanner,
Maltby, R. Rodgers, Thomas, and
Davis.
