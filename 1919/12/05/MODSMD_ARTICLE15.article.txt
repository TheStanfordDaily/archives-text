# ARTISTIC EXHIBITION PRESENTED BY TROUPE
## Isadora Duncan Dancers and George Copeland Give Pleasing Numbers 
### Jean Frickleton, '20 
It is seldom that an audience lias
an opportunity of hearing joint recital
by such artists as George Copeland
and the Isadora Duncan Dancers
Their concert here last evening was
truly exquisite in its natural charm
and grace.
In spite ol' this rather subordinate
position in accompanying the dancers,
Mr. Copeland excited the hearty ad
miration of the audience from the
beginning, and his solos received
more applause than any other num
bers 011 the program. "The Blue
Danube" by Strauss, played by Mr.
Copeland as an encore, was acclaimed
by the audience with almost uncon
trollable enthusiasm.
His interpretation of Debussy wae
both sympathetic and masterful, and
his group of Spanish dances was a
blaze of pianistic color.
The six dancers demonstrated that
beauty in symbolic expression that
comes only with a complete under
standing of the classics they inter
preted. They showed a remarkable
command of the body, and depicted
both joy and sorrow in a truly in
spired way.
Anna's interpretation of Chopin's
Valse No. 11 seemed the most distinct
ive of the solo numbers. The Suite
of Waltzes by Schubert was probably
the most appealing of the ensemble
dancing.
The only thing to dim the beauty
of the evening was the perpetually
annoying spotlight, famous in Stan
ford traditions for always being in
the wrong place at the wrong time.
A.s usual it proved itself most unreli
able when most needed.
