# LACK OF UNDERSTANDING
## 
### 
DEADERS of newspapers can not but notice at least two things in connection
with almost every matter of dispute or controversy, no matter whether it be
international, national, provincial, or municipal, as the case may be. It matters
not what the subject may be in dispute, whether educational, religous, socal, moral,
or political.
The first thing is, that one side rarely understands the position of the other;
and secondly, makes little or no attempt to arrive at a satisfactory understand
ing of the other man's position.
This lack of understanding is nothing new, men having always misuderstood
each other, and will continue to do so in the future. Sometimes this rises from
temperament; sometimes as a result of environment or training. Little good, how
ever, has been gained by any policy founded on misunderstanding. The only
result obtained oftentimes is that participants are apt to take disputes too scrio
ously and so lose their sense of self-control and the final solution of the question
at issue—if, indeed, a solution is reached at all —is not satisfactory.
How often in a debate do we find the opposing sides bring the issue fairly be
fore each other 1 The great fault to be found in so many debates is that one side
evades the issue or else overlaps without coming squarely to the point.
One place, more than any other, where a lack of understanding should not
be tolerated is a university. Here, more than any other place, truth should be
our aim. Anything that keeps us from a right understanding should be faced,
and every possible effort made to remove all causes which make for misunder
standings.
How true are the words of Bacon! "No pleasure is comparable to the stand
ing upon the vantage ground of truth." Certainly it is Heaven upon earth to
have a man's mind, move in charity, rest in providence, and turn upon the poles
of truth."—McGill Daily.
