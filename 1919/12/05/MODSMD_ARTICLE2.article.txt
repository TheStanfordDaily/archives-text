# DR. JORDAN RECEIVES APPEAL FROM UKRANIA
## Letter Says That Republic Is In Danger While Entente Sits By 
### 
Dr. Jordan today received a letter
from President Simon Petlioura, of the
Republic of Ukrania, begging the Chan
cellor Emeritus to use his influence to
mitigate the terrible situation in that
country. Petlioura says that thousands
of Republican soldiers and loyal people
are suffering and perishing while the
Entente sits by and vill not even allow
the Red Cross to come to them.
Bolsheviki are hated by the Ukranians,
the letter states, hut General Dcnikine
and liis followers have used the same
methods.
The letter states in part:
"At the present moment our most
dangerous advesary is General Danikine,
who, instead of lighting Bolsheviki, has
turned against us the cannon he re
ceived from the Allies. I lis officers
announce openly that after the defeat
of the Ukranians their chief will begin
attacks upon the Poles and Roumanians.
"We have received no help from any
quarter. Neither munitions, apparatus,
sanitary productsâ€”nothing!
"The powers of the Entente, alas!
