# Stanford-California Water Polo Saturday
## 
### 
The Stanford and California freshmen
water polo teams will meet in the En
cina pool at one o'clock Saturday after
noon for the aquatic honors of the two
universities. This game will be the only
competition between Stanford and U. C.
in this line of sport, as California has
no varsity polo team. Coach Brandsten
is confident of a victory because of th
bang-up brand of ball exhibited by the
freshmen in their last few games and
practices.
Preparatory to Saturday's contest, the
Stanford varsity and freshmen water
polo teams will play a practice game in
the local pool at 4:30 Friday afternoon.
The line-up of the men who will play
California is Austin, cf; Webster, rf;
Mattux, If; Reibe, cb; De Groot, rb;
Welsh, lb; and Holt, g.
