# NOTED SPEAKER FOR ASSEMBLY HERE WEDNESDAY
## 
### 
The subject of Dr. Alonzo E. Taylor's
address at the University assembly next
Wednesday morning at 11 o'clock has
been announced as "America's Contribu
tion in Solving the War Problems."
It is probable that Dr. Taylor will take
up the work of the American Relief
Administration and will give some per
sonal sidelights on the achievements of
Herbert Hoover and his associates dur
ing the war and the period of the
armistice.
Aiding Hoover in this work of reliev
ing the distress of Europe and re-estab
lishing normal conditions in the war
torn countries were a number of Stan
ford men holding a responsible posi
tions. Immediately after the armistice
Dr. Taylor and Professor Vernon Kel
logg of Stanford made a tour of inves
tigation in order to gain accurate infor
mation of conditions and needs. In the
course of this study Dr. Taylor had a
chance to see the work of these Stan
ford men and others who were striving
to get in food to starving peoples and to
aid them in setting up normal life once
again.
The knowledge that Dr. Taylor thus
gained he not only put into official re
ports but has made available to the
people in a number of articles in various
magazines, notably the Saturday Even
ing Post. The portions that will most
interest a Stanford audience he will
make the subject of his talk next
Wednesday.
