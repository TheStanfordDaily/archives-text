# ALUMNAE TEA WILL BE HELD NEXT WEDNESDAY
## 
### 
The Resident Alumnae tea to be
given next Wednesday will close the
series for this quarter, due to the
nearness of the holiday season. It
is planned to resume the teas after
the opening of the University in
January, and it is hoped that they
will be supported as liberally as has
been the case this quarter.
In view of the fact that the refresh
ments furnished have often cost the
hostesses more than the total of the
admission fees, it has been found de
sirable to increase the pre-war charge
for tea to twenty-five cents, and for
card tables to one dollar and a half,
but this increase does not apply to
this week's tea, which is still at the
old rate of fifteen cents, and one dol
lar for each card table.
It will be of interest to know that
the entire proceeds of these teas go
to permanent additions and improve
ments of the Women's Club House â€”
not for running expenses. The tea
committee three years ago paid for
finishing the reading-room, that of two
years ago furnished it. Last year the
fund was allowed to accumulate, and
in the summer the Margaret Post-
Stolz Memorial room was installed at
a cost of five hundred dollars, exclu
sive of the furniture which was the
gift of friends, and the accumulated
tea fund was applied on this debt.
As it amounted to but $233.06, it has
been necessary to add to it the pro
ceeds off the teas given this quarter.
To date these have amounted to $188.-
51, to which has been added $20, de
rived from rentals of the room, leav
ing a balance still due of $58.43.
All students as well as friends of the
University are cordially invited to the
Wednesday teas.
