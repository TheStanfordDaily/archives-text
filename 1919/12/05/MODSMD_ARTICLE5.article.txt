# CLASS BASKETBALL SCHEDULE OPENED YESTERDAY AT GYM
## 
### 
The first two games of the inter
class basketball schedule were play
ed yesterday afternoon at Encina
Gymnasium. The freshmen opened the
season by defeating the juniors 11 to
19. The sophomores were defeated by
the seniors by a score of 16 to 6.
The junior-t'rosh game was the
most evenly matched contest, and
more men were played, since Coach
Acker gave most every man out for
the babe team a chance to play. The
first half ended with the frosh in the
load by three points and they held
their ground in the second. Most of
the scores made by the junior team
Were from foul goals, proving their
lack of ability to hit the basket from
the field and the frosh's inability to
keep from fouling. Many of the fouls
on the part of the freshman team
prevented the juniors from making
field gcals.
No deflinite line-up was made for
the freshman team but the defenders
