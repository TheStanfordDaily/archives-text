# FORUM CLUB WINS DUAL DEBATE FROM EUPHRONIA SOCIETY
## 
### 
The College of the Pacific was vic
torious in both of the debates held last
evening against Euphronia. Before a
large crowd in the Little Theater, its
representatives were able to convince
two of the three judges that strikes
should not be interfered with by federal
law. Likewise, at San Jose, they were
equally successful in arguing the affirma
tive of the proposition.
O. O. Norton, of the Forum—the de
bating club from the College of the
Pacific—proved to be the strongest mem
ber of either of the opposing teams that
debated here, lie argued on the as
sumption that con pulsory arbitration
was not in the province of the question,
.;:nd that, further, tl ere was 110 neces
ity for a prohibitory measure in regard
to strikes. Neither of these arguments
were adequately answered by either of
the contenders for Euphronia. Miss
Oletta Pederson was the other member
of the San Jose team.
C. G. Smith, '22, and 1. M. Smith, '21,
represented Euphronia here; while 11.
A. Fendler, '22, and C. A. Hutchens,
'23, spoke for the society in San Jose.
The judges for the debate held here
were Professors Eliot Jones, Stuart, and
V. C. West.
So successful were the debates that the
two clubs agreed to make this an an
nual contest between the two clubs, to be
held during the winter quarter of each
year.
