When Yon Go Home
at Christmas-time —
—for turkey and cranberries and home-town dances, but
most of all just because it's home, you'll be glad that
you knew
"JEWELRY'S THE THING"
for gifts to those you love. Glad, too, that you knew
"Lean's in San Jose," with its wonderfully complete
display of appropriate gifts, priced moderately.
A Small Deposit Will Reserve Any Gift
