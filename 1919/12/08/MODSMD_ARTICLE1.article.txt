# STANFORD RUGBY TEAM TIES CALIFORNIA -3 TO 3
## GAME IS HARD FOUGHT THROUGHOUT Cardinal Backs Shatter the Berkeley Offence in Crisis 
### 
C TAN FORD and California fought
their way to a 3 to 3 tie at Berkeley
Saturday afternoon, in one of the fast
est rugby contests ever played on the
coast. Victory for either team hung
in the balance until the last second of
play, and the spectators were on their
feet cheering the fifteens during the
greater part of the last half.
The important feature of the con
test was the surprising strength dis
played by California in every department
of the game. The Blue and Gold took
the field with the odds slightly against
them, and ended the match in the good
graces of all the city newspaper ex
perts. Smooth passing and unusually
good broken-field running were the
salient points of their play, and during
the first half they threatened the Cardi
nal goal on several occasions.
Neither side was able to score in the
first period. During the first few min
utes the ball remained in mid-field, then
suddenly shifted from one goal line to
the other with startling swiftness, final
ly flashing towards the Stanford line
after a long series of running passes that
covered a good half of the gridiron.
The Stanford line braced and held in
the crisis, the California attack was shat
tered, and the ball was carried out of
danger before the half ended.
Early in the last period the Cardinal
backs broke through the Berkeley de
fense, and tore across the hostile goal
line for the first score of the game. The
try was attempted from a different angle
and failed.
California came back with a rush, and
for a while the play was even; but at
length the rival forwards broke through,
and by perfect passing carried the ball
forty yards and across the lino with a
safe margin. Only a few minutes of
piay remained, and victory depended on
the try, which was kicked from directly
in front of the goal posts. The ball
curved, struck the left-hand post, and
bounced back into the field.
Desperate attempts by both sides
failed to accomplish further scores. The
hall changed hands and territory so
quickly that the spectators were kept
constantly on their toes. Both goals
were in danger, but neither fifteen could
pound its way through the opposing de
fense at the right time, and the final
whistle blew with the ball in neutral
territory.
