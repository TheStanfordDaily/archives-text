# FRATERNITIES PLEDGE LARGE NUMBER OF RUSHEES
## FORMAL RUSHING SEASON CLOSES Greek Letter Men Bid 135— May Now Send Out Informal Bids 
### 
170RMAL bidding yesterday, closed a
two-montli rushing season for the
fraternities. Of the 135 bids, 116
freshmen accepted, making five men
the average for each house. Unless
there is a change made by the Inter-
Fraternity conference meeting tonight,
informal bidding will be open tomor
row night.
The system of rushing and pledging
used this year is entirely foreign to
the fraternities on the campus. Al
though the sororities follow a some
what similar line in their pledging, the
fraternities have a more extended and
complicated method.
The number of freshmen pledged
by any one house was small, the larg
est number pledged by a single house
being nine.
Those pledged to the various fra
ternities are:
Zeta Psi —R. I. Cravens, L. C. Vena
ter, A. W. Burton, J. H. Smith, A. B.
McAlpine, A. R. Sutch, P. S. Schnei
der, W. B. Bowden.
Phi Delta Theta—P. R. Piggott, R.
D. Vial, H. M. Clark, J. O. Reavis.
Phi Kappa Psi —E. Heater, Don Hut
ton, D. E. Wood, A. C. Kirkwood, F,
L. Kennedy, E. A. Patterson, John
Earle.
