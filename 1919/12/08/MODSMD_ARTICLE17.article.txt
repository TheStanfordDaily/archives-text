# A
						CRISIS AND THE BEARING OF STUDENT EFFORT
## 
### 
WHY is it that a professor's announcement that a recitation hour will be
omitted invariably draws forth expressions of delight from the class?
An uninformed onlooker would assume that the men and women of the
class room were wage earners about to be given a day off with full pay
instead of a group of students enjoying the privileges of an expensive edu
cation.
There is not a sane member of the student body who would buy a dozen
apples and then urge the grocer to take back four or five as a gift. And yet
almost anyone seems anxious to give back to the college any number of the
days of education which they have received.
Aside from the mercenary aspect of the-matter a true realization of the
fundamental purposes for which he has come to college should make the stu
dent hesitate to give up unnecessarily an hour of academic work.
From a selfish standpoint his future success depends in large measure
upon the foundations which he is laying here. From the altruistic stand
point the world is depending on the colleges to furnish the leaders of the
future.
The world is at present passing through one of the most critical stages
in its history. It is a crisis which will not be passed quickly. It is the
fated task of the college students of the present to settle the existing world
problems for better or for worse. The amount of serious effort which students
put into their college work now will have a direct bearing on the future
welfare of the world. â€”Grinnell "Scarlet and Black."
