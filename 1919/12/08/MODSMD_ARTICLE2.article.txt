# FRATERNITY GIVES $80 SCHOLARSHIP
## Phi Kappa Sigma Meets the Proposal of Stanford Student 
### 
Plii Kappa Sigma fraternity an
nounced in a letter to Dean J. E. Mc-
Dowell today that it would establish an
$80 scholarship to pay the tuition of
one student fr?r the remainder of the
current year. The scholarship is to
he established under the plan proposed
by an anonymous Stanford student last
week, which was that the student would
establish a $40 scholarship for every
$40 scholarship up to three established
by any other Stanford student or Stan
ford group, and this means that at least
$160 tuition scholarships will be available
for the next two quarters.
The anonymous student, in a letter
to President Wilbur, agreed to establish
his scholarships for the winter and
spring quarters of the present year.
There still remain two scholarships for
the winter quarter and two for the
spring quarter of $40 each that the anon
ymous student will equal if they are
established by other students or groups.
The letter of the Phi Kappa Sigma
fraternity is as follows :
"Appreciating fully the conditions
which it necessary to charge a
tuition fee and desiring in every way to
co-operate with the administration, the
Phi Kappa Sigma fraternity wishes to
establish a scholarship of $80 to pay the
tuition of one student for the balance
of the current year. It is our desire that
this scholarship be voted by the proper
University authorities to a needy and
worthy freshman or sophomore male
student.
"Our purpose in making this contri
bution is: First, to keep in the Univer
sity some worthy student who might
otherwise have to leave; second, to show
in concrete form our realization of the
immense benefits that we arc drawing
from the University and the responsi
bility that these benefits entail upon us."
