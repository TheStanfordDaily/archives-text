# Ram's Head Plans To Produce Show
## C.K. Field, '95, Congratulates Society on Big Game Vaudeville 
### 
Ram's Head Society will give the
first show of the Winter quarter ac
cording to an announcement today.
They expect to follow the old custom
of using men in both male and female
roles. "Biff! Bang!! Bullsheveek!!! 'â€¢
is the only production of this kind for
a number of years past. The fact
that only men will take part in the
show makes it one of the biggest
novelties among college productions

The words and music will be writ
ten by campus talent, and plans for
the show have already been formu

Kegley, '18, have charge of the music,
and promise a number of new song
hits which are expected to become
very popular.
