# SOPHOMORE PLAY BIG SUCCESS OF THIS QUARTER
## COLLIER'S COMEDY WINS LOUD APPLAUSE "Never Say Die" Is Given In Professional Style 
### R. W. Kenny, '21 
짜 AST Friday night's audience at the
sophomore presentation of "Never
Say Die," is indebted to the author of
this cleverest of comedies, William Col
lier, to the extent of two and one-half
hours of solid fun. Brilliant dialogue,
combined with a complication of ingeni
ous situations, left the plsy without a
dull moment.
It was a very creditable array of dra
matic talent that the sophomores got to
gether to produce this fun show.
Throughout, the cast was one of more
than usual brilliance in the run of class
prductions. The comedy characters,
with which the play abounded, found
very able interpreters, and the "straight"
parts were almost equally well taken.
The action, and the Collier comedy had
lots of it, ran off with almost a pro
fessional smoothness, a tribute to the
coaching of Gordon Davis.
It was Lester Seib's naturalness, his
matchless gift of being absolutely at
home on the stage, that earned him the
star position in "N ,ver Say Die." A
resultant of this natural quality was ihe
complete understanding and sympathy
with which he handled his role. Seib
showed a superior lensc"* ct comedy
values and gave them a far subtler treat
ment than did most of the cast.
Playing opposite him, as "Violet Ste
venson," Miss Eleanor Anderson was a
perfect ingenue. Her acting had an in
definable delicate quality that won the
hearts of the audience and a certain in
dividual grace, that marked her person
ally. It was unfortunate that at times
her otherwise graceful work was marred
by some affectedness and seeming in
sincerity.
Perhaps the tiling that would draw
one's attention to the nervousness and
lack of genuine feeling in the acting of
some of the cast, was the contrast shown
by the restful ease with which Miss
Sarahbelle Arnott handled her matronly
role of "Mrs. Stevenson." At all times
Miss Arnott showed a mastery of her
part.
J. E. Lambie sustained the part of
"Griggs," the valet, with remarkable
success, proving to be a comedian of

the first water. The two doctors, played
by Warren F. Lewis and S. W. Harri
son, were very funny, and Harrison
especially carried his part with unusual
merit, although his makeup was in sore
need of renovation.
Melba Berry, as "La Cigale," the
dancer, gave a very spirited interpreta
tion of what was perhaps the most dif
ficult of the female parts. The dash and
vivacity of her manner marked her as
a really capable character actress.
It must be said that a little more poise
on the part of R. E. Blood would have
helped his reading of the role of "Hector
Walters" immensely. He showed, how
ever. a very clear conception of his part.
Hal Bumbaugh, as "Verchesi," the
chef, was very amusing in his minor
role.
Taking everything into consideration.
"Never Say Die" has set a mark that
is bound to make it rank well with the
season's productions.

by some affectedness and seeming in
sincerity.
Perhaps the tiling that would draw
one's attention to the nervousness and
lack of genuine feeling in the acting of
some of the cast, was the contrast shown
by the restful ease with which Miss
Sarahbelle Arnott handled her matronly
role of "Mrs. Stevenson." At all times
Miss Arnott showed a mastery of her
part.
J. E. Lambie sustained the part of
"Griggs," the valet, with remarkable
success, proving to be a comedian of

the first water. The two doctors, played
by Warren F. Lewis and S. W. Harri
son, were very funny, and Harrison
especially carried his part with unusual
merit, although his makeup was in sore
need of renovation.
Melba Berry, as "La Cigale," the
dancer, gave a very spirited interpreta
tion of what was perhaps the most dif
ficult of the female parts. The dash and
vivacity of her manner marked her as
a really capable character actress.
It must be said that a little more poise
on the part of R. E. Blood would have
helped his reading of the role of "Hector
Walters" immensely. He showed, how
ever. a very clear conception of his part.
Hal Bumbaugh, as "Verchesi," the
chef, was very amusing in his minor
role.
Taking everything into consideration.
"Never Say Die" has set a mark that
is bound to make it rank well with the
season's productions.
짜 AST Friday night's audience at the
sophomore presentation of "Never
Say Die," is indebted to the author of
this cleverest of comedies, William Col
lier, to the extent of two and one-half
hours of solid fun. Brilliant dialogue,
combined with a complication of ingeni
ous situations, left the plsy without a
dull moment.
It was a very creditable array of dra
matic talent that the sophomores got to
gether to produce this fun show.
Throughout, the cast was one of more
than usual brilliance in the run of class
prductions. The comedy characters,
with which the play abounded, found
very able interpreters, and the "straight"
parts were almost equally well taken.
The action, and the Collier comedy had
lots of it, ran off with almost a pro
fessional smoothness, a tribute to the
coaching of Gordon Davis.
It was Lester Seib's naturalness, his
matchless gift of being absolutely at
home on the stage, that earned him the
star position in "N ,ver Say Die." A
resultant of this natural quality was ihe
complete understanding and sympathy
with which he handled his role. Seib
showed a superior lensc"* ct comedy
values and gave them a far subtler treat
ment than did most of the cast.
Playing opposite him, as "Violet Ste
venson," Miss Eleanor Anderson was a
perfect ingenue. Her acting had an in
definable delicate quality that won the
hearts of the audience and a certain in
dividual grace, that marked her person
ally. It was unfortunate that at times
her otherwise graceful work was marred
by some affectedness and seeming in
sincerity.
