# TWO MORE TUITION SCHOLARSHIPS ARE FOUNDED BY GIFT
## 
### 
Two more tuition scholarships for
the coming two quarters were estab
lished today by Manly Axwell Moule,
'17. The establishment of the scholar
ships was announced in a letter to
Dean J. E. McDowell. These two
scholarships do not have any con
nection with the plan proposed by an
anonymous Stanford student last week,
and are separate from that plan.
The letter received by Dean Mc-
Dowell this morning was from H. J.
Moule, father of the donor of the $160
which is 1o be used for the scholar
ships. The provision for awarding the
scholarship differ* from the provisions
announced by the anonymous Stan
ford student, who agreed to fund a
scholarship for every scholarship
founded by another student or group,
up to three for the next two quarters.
The letter from Moule follows:
"Pursuant to our conversation of
this day you will please find check
inclosed in the sum of $160 for the
establishment of two tyition scholar
ships covering payment of tuition for
the two following quarters, with the
hope in mind that this nominal fund
will steadily grow from contributions
from various sources. The awards to
be in the hands of Dr. Wilbur and
yourself.
"It strikes the writer that a fund of
this character, though small in the
beginning has a potentiality of growth
through generosity and co-operation of
Stanford's friends always ready to be
of assistance to earnest young men
and women desirous of obtaining a
higher education such as this uni
versity affords. The increased cost

of living today is making it a dif
ficult matter for many students to get
along without financial worry, there
fore, it is up to some of us older ones
to help the hoys out particularly at
this time. The donor of the gift is
Manly Axwell Moule, '17. Very sin
cerely, H. J. MOTTLE."
