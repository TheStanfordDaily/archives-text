IT HAS BEEN MADE KNOWN to the campus through our news columns
of the last few days that a Stanford student has made an anonymous offer
which will total $240 to be used to help pay the tuition fees of students who
would otherwise be forced to drop out of Stanford. When this offer was
made, it was stipulated that some other students or organizations would have
to make a like offer; that is for every $40 tuition fee paid for by some one
else up to six, this student would also pay for one.
Yesterday the Phi Kappa Sigma fraternity notified President Wilbur that
its members would pay $80 for two tuition fees. This, we hope has started
the ball rolling. To secure the remaining $160', the same amount will have
to be offered to this fund by other individuals or groups. The situation fully
understood, there is little question but that other offers will be made to the
University President. The installation of the tuition fee system in January
will force many of our best students to drop out of the University. They
have been offered the opportunity of signing notes payable in seven years
at 7 per cent interest, but the sentiment of a majority of the students is
distinctly against this. In our number there are many who can more easily
afford to pay double tuition than these students can afford to pay the extra
$40. Thi3 is not asked, although one student, an easterner, who has been
very much impressed with out democratic spirit, has seen fit to make an
offer of $240. If other groups will follow the lead of the Phi Kappa Sigma
fraternity, enough money will soon be raised to meet this added expense,
that some of our most deserving would otherwise be unable to stand.
