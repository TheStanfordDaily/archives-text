## Military Unit and Rushing Problems Discussed in Thursday's Issue 
### 
Stanford's part in the Mexican situa
tion as played by Lieut. Paul H. Davis,
'06, who was captured and held by the
bandit leader Renteria last August, will
lie one of the features in The Illustrated
Review Thursday.
The account of the seizure of Davis
and his brother officer, H. G. Peterson,
is written by Robert Blankesey, who was
corresponding with the two aviators at
tlie time the episode occurred. Blanke
sey's article describes the flight along
the border and the breakdown of the
machine which forced the jrfitrol to the
ground. In cndeavnring to reach one
of the border towns, the jwo officers
were captured by Renteria who was
leading a foray near El Paso. The
men subsequently released follow
ing the payment of a ransom, the rais
ing of which is described in Blankesey's
account of the affair. Several illustra
tions of the two aviators also feature
the article.
Garrison Costar, '07, has contributed
an article describing the world's great
est gas lire, which occurred at Taft
last July. Costar was an eye-witness to
the spectaclc and gives a vivid account
of the burning well. Some idea of the
magnitude of the fire may be gained
from the fact that people were able to
read newspapers at midnight in towns
seven miles distant from the blaze.
Under the heading "Unravel the Rush
ing Tangle;" E. C. Smith, '16, offers
some criticisms and solutions to the
present problem before the fraternities.
Adams suggests that the sorority method
of closed rushing periods furnishes one
answer, and also points out the advan
tages of a three-week rushing period,
followed by bidding.
Col. Leroy P. Collins, head of the
Stanford military unit, has written nn
account of the artillery unit here, in
which he tells of the results of the new
addition to the military program at
Stanford. A half page of illustrations
of the unit will also be shown.
