# STANFORD AND U.C. WILL PLAY RUGBY HERE ON SATURDAY
## 
### 
Definite arrangements for the trial
rugby game between Stanford and
California, which will be played here
next Saturday, preliminary to the
choosing of an all-California team to
represent the two universities in the
north during the Christmas vacation,
-ere completed this morning by Coach
Harry Maloney and Nichols of Cali
fornia.
In spite of the final examinations at
Berkeley, great interest has been cre
ated among rugby players at the pros
pect of accompanying Stanford on the
trip, and Nichols was able to assure
local authorities that a strong team
would be brought here for Saturday's
game.
Victoria's offer for a match has
been accepted by Stanford, and the
fourth contest for the all-star fifteen
is practically assured. The game will
be played on December 26, a legal
holiday for British subjects.
After the choice of a line-up for
the all-stars, the fifteen will com
mence practice at once, in order to
perfect its team work before the squad
leaves Stanford. Prospcts indicate
that the strongest team on the coast
will result from the combination, and
success in the northern congests seems
assured.
