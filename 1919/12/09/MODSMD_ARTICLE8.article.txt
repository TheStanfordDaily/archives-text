## P.C.C. ARRANGES GAMES Dr. F.R. Angell Is Elected President of Pacific Coast Conference 
### 
DACIFIC Coast Conference closed its
1919 session in Seattle yesterday by
the election for the ensuing year of Dr.
Frank Angell as president and Dr.
Lynch, of the University of California,
as secretary. Dr. Angell's election comes
as a result of a long experience in han
dling athletic affairs, notably as chair
man of the former faculty athletic com
mittee at Stanford. San Francisco was
designated as the meeting place for the
next conference, December 4, 1920.
Stanford will meet two new universi
ties next season in football, according
to the schedule made at the meeting of
the officials of the Pacific Coast Con
ference in Seattle. The University of
Washington will play the Cardinal
eleven at Seattle on November 6. The
University of Oregon will journey to
Stanford campus on October 30 for a
battle with Coach Evans' men.
The Big Game wit 1 ! the University of
California will take place on November
20 at Berkeley.
Manager Ames is arranging other
games and lie will announce the com
pleted schedule for the Stanford varsity
in a few days.
The freshman football team will be
restricted next year to the playing of
but two intercollegiate games. No lim
itation, however, was set on the number
of games that may be scheduled with
high-school squads. The last contest of
the season must take place not later than
two weeks before Thanksgiving.
The application of the University of
Southern California for membership in
the conference was presented by Dr. A.
D. Browne, Stanford's delegate. Al
though the application failed of ap
proval, U. S. C. was advised that fav
orable action could be expected at next
year's session of the conference.
A post-season game, it was decided,
between champion Eastern and Pacific
Coast gridmcn will be scheduled as the
closing event hereafter of the football
season. To reduce the difficulties of
selecting the champion aggregation from
the Pacific Coast, the conference itself
will name the team for the coast. The
place for playing will be selected by the
college designated to represent the con
ference.
Football men on the campus today ex
pressed the opinion that Stanford's
chances of being designated next year
as the coast champion will be increased
by this definite method of selection. It
is pointed out that Stanford will not
be forced to depend upon the haphazard
recognition of unofficial committees or
sport writers to gain recognition for her
football team.

Washington will play the Cardinal
eleven at Seattle on November 6. The
University of Oregon will journey to
Stanford campus on October 30 for a
battle with Coach Evans' men.
The Big Game wit 1 ! the University of
California will take place on November
20 at Berkeley.
Manager Ames is arranging other
games and lie will announce the com
pleted schedule for the Stanford varsity
in a few days.
The freshman football team will be
restricted next year to the playing of
but two intercollegiate games. No lim
itation, however, was set on the number
of games that may be scheduled with
high-school squads. The last contest of
the season must take place not later than
two weeks before Thanksgiving.
The application of the University of
Southern California for membership in
the conference was presented by Dr. A.
D. Browne, Stanford's delegate. Al
though the application failed of ap
proval, U. S. C. was advised that fav
orable action could be expected at next
year's session of the conference.
A post-season game, it was decided,
between champion Eastern and Pacific
Coast gridmcn will be scheduled as the
closing event hereafter of the football
season. To reduce the difficulties of
selecting the champion aggregation from
the Pacific Coast, the conference itself
will name the team for the coast. The
place for playing will be selected by the
college designated to represent the con
ference.
Football men on the campus today ex
pressed the opinion that Stanford's
chances of being designated next year
as the coast champion will be increased
by this definite method of selection. It
is pointed out that Stanford will not
be forced to depend upon the haphazard
recognition of unofficial committees or
sport writers to gain recognition for her
football team.
