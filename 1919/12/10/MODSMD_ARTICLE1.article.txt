# ACTIVITIES OF WOMEN WILL GET DEFINITE BUDGET
## NEW PLAN IS ADOPTED Women's Athletics to Receive A Portion of Students' Incidental Fees 
### 
DASSAGE by thfe Executive Committee
last evening of the new scheme origi
nated by the finance committee of the
Organized Women, for the financing of
women's athletics at Stanford, marks an
exceptionally important event in the
history of Stanford women. Accord
ing to this arrangement, the women will
receive seventy-five cents out of the total
two dollars they pay to support student
activities; of this two dollars, twenty
five cents from the dollar each woman
pays to the Executive Committee, and
fifty cents out of every dollar paid to
the Board of Athletic Control will go
to support the women's organizations.
Formerly, any money which the
women needed for activities was appor
tioned by these two boards, acting upon
a specific request of a team or organiza
tion, and granted only for a certain
event. There has never been a definite,
specified fund created for the use of
women, before this time, and it has been
felt by the women that this was the
cause of the lack of support of the
teams, and a general disinterestedness
in women's activities as a whole.
Under this plan, the twenty-five cents
which will be taken from the dollar paid
to the Executive Committee will be paid
through the comptroller's office, to the
Organized Women of Stanford, and will
be spent by them with the express con-
sent of the Finance Committee of that
body, which committee was the origi
nator and propagator of this plan. The
fifty cents, also apportioned by the
Comptroller, from the dollar paid to
the Board of Athletic Control, will he
handled by the Women's Athletic As
sociation, with the consent of the finance
committee of that body.
This plan will create a standing fund
of $125 a quarter for the support of
general women's activities, and a fund
of $250 for the use of women's athletics.
The money which is not used each quar
ter, will be put into a sinking fund kept
separate by each body, and reserved for
future necessity.
