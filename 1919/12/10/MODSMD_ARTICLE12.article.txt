# Miss Dorothy Marcuse Gives Piano Recital
## 
### 
Miss Dorothy Marcuse, who last even
ing- gave a piano recital in the Little
Theater, interested her audience from
the beginning of her program to the end
with her surety of touch and expression,
intermingled with a most pleasing per
sonality.
Perhaps the most distinguishing point
in her playing was her execution of
sweet clear trills and runs in her in
terpretation of "Silver Spring" by Wil
liam Mason. The pieces of Chopin,
Bach, and Beethoven were most credit
ably rendered. The splendid quality of
her singing tones in the "Etude G. Flat"
by Moszkowski, and "Romance" by
Schumann must not be overlooked.
