# Krehbiel Resigns Faculty Position
## Well-Known Professor Quits Stanford For Field of Commerce 
### 
Professor Edward Krehbiel, of the
history department and one of Stan
ford's best known faculty members, has
tendered his resignation to President
Ray Lyman Wilbur, in order that he
may continue work with Weinstock Lu
bin & Co., of Sacramento, on which he
has been engaged since September 1.
Dr. Krehbiel went to Sacramento in
September to serve as organizer for the
new scheme of management of Wein
stock, Lubin & Co., by which the firm
has turned over the control of the
business to its employees. While on
leave of absence from the University,
he has been working out the system*by
which this new method of management
will be operated, and is still engaged
in completing the details.
Under the new scheme, Dr. Krchbiel
himself is manager of the Public Rela
tions Division, one of the seven divisions
under which all the activities of the
store are organized, and he will continue
in that position after the scheme of man
agement by the employees is completed.
"The chief reason for my coming
here." he says in a letter, "is that I
believe that the relations of employer
and employee and industrial problems
generally will be the great problem of
the next era. I am not willing to be
as little identified with the solution as
I should have been compelled to be in
the University. I wished to be in the
front trenches and to have the authority
that comes from being in touch with
things—a privilege that would have been
denied me as long as I remained in the
University faculty, and could, therefore,
be described as 'a mere theorist.'"
