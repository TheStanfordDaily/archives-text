# EASE UP THE PRESSURE

### 
•PHE busy whirl of classes, activities, and social events is almost over, and
for most of us it is with a feeling of unpreparedness that we realize that
final examinations are but a few days distant. Because of this we have a
suggestion which we hope will be taken only as a suggestion given in good
faith ,and with the best of motives behind it. The quarter system has
changed things at Stanford. No longer do we have time to spare during
the course of weeks before the examinations, and no longer are we able
to keep absolutely up to date in all of our work. With classes meeting
more often than under the old schedule, and with what we once regarded
as just the ordinary social events and University activities crowding up
the week-ends, it has been difficult for the most conscientious to keep above
the danger mark.
Final examinations are scheduled to begin on Wednesday in accordance
with the University regulations, we understand that a majority of the pro
fessors are planning on conducting their regular classes up until that time.
This will work to a serious disadvantage to the students. There are many
who will have two four-hour examinations on Wednesday, and will be handi
capped in their preparations because of this fact. While we are sure that
the University authorities will not consider officially cancelling the meeting
of classes on Monday and Tuesday, the students would consider it as time
dedicated to serious study, and as an opportunity to catch up the loose ends,
if the professors would realize their plfght, and on Friday post notices to
this effect: "This class will not meet on Monday or Tuesday."
