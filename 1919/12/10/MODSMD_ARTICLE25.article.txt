### Ivan BENSON, '18 
Some brute (male, white, unmarried)
lias said that Love is hounded on the
north hy the weight of a fellow's pocket
hook, on the south hy the color of the
girl's eyes, on the east hy the temper of
the girl's mother, and on the west by
circumstance.
* * *
Happy thought! Especially the color
of the girl's eyes.
* * *
How would you bound it?
* * *
Well, the candidates for steerage ac
commodations in the realm of house
hills, exchange dinners, and jazz music
will now begin to pay for their meals,
prepare for the worst, boys. Life is
not one long dream.
â™¦ * *
Whatever you went was right. Ask
the fellows who dragged you into it.
* * *
If you have a good pal lurking in the
shadows of the tall uncut with his gum
shoes on, be a sport and slip him a
tip. Tell him the woods are safer.
