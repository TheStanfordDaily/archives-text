# Quad Refuses to Give Name of Foolish Editor
## 
### 
No names will be announced in con
nection with the josh section of the
1920 Quad, Editor F. L. McElroy stated
today, because of an agreement with the
"foolish editor" that his name shall not
be published. He asserts, however, that
his section will be full of "razzes" of
the "better" type.
Two large silver cups now being
made in San Francisco will be offered
for the best individual and living group
"razz." Competition has already started
and will continue several weeks. The
josh editor states that groups and indi
viduals should be hit as hard and fairly
as possible, and that material should be
mailed to box 1166 at once.
