# DR. TAYLOR ADDRESSES ASSEMBLY ON WORK IN EUROPE
## SHOWS CHANGE IN VIEWS Feels America Came Out of Struggle Unharmed by Militaristic Aims 
### 
nk. ALONZO E. TAYLOR, in an
address before a University assem
bly this morning in the Assembly Hall,
showed very forcibly and clearly the
part that Americans played in the recon
structive policies of the world today,
keeping them free from the stigma of
militarism and substitution of a dynamic
point of view for the more or less
static views which were characteristic
of Europe before the war.
In speaking of actual relief work,
Dr. Taylor said:
"It was American credit that paid for
the work, American commodities which
were used in the work, and American
men which directed the work." Eighty
eight per cent of the financial credit
which was the basis of the relief work
came from the United States, as well
as ninety-two per cent of the commodi
ties, and ninety-nine per cent of the
direction.
The gradual change of viewpoint
which has had to come over Europe was
personified in the work of the Economic
War Council. Seven hundred and fifty
American officers proved that the eco
nomic viewpoint was just as essential to
the winning of the war as the political
and militaristic viewpoint, and, accord
ing to Dr. Taylor, a dynamic viewpoint
alone can insure the reconstructive pro
gram any success against future calami
ties such as the world has just passed
through.
