Look Well and Fit Well
We can say that without fear of
contradiction from any quarter if
we have supplied the glasses.
Instead of detracting from one's

improve the appearance and add
an air of dignity.
If you need glasses you do your
self an injustice by putting off
the matter another day.

to the selection of each of our cards when we
ordered them —"Cards that are different"
