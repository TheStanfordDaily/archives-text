a separate vote of faculty and stu

visory committee of President Hadley
of Yale, Lowell of Harvard, Hibben of
Princeton and Butler of Columbia.
According to the telegram received
by the Daily Palo Alto yesterday, four
separate propositions will be voted
on. The propositions are: â€”(1) Do
you favor the League and the Treaty
without amendments or reservations;
(2) Are you opposed to the ratifica
tion of the League and the Treaty in
any form; (3) Are you in favor of the
ratification of the Treaty and the
League but only with the specific re
servations as voted by the majority
of the Senate; (4) Do you favor any
compromise on the reservations which
will make possible immediate ratifica
tion of the Treaty and the League.
President Wilbur has stated that
he is in favor of conducting the vote
and has sent the following telegram:
Stanford University, Dec. 10, 1919.
C. E. Couch, Secretary Intercollegiate
