# DUAL LINE-UP FOR RUGBY TEAM WILL BE MADE SATURDAY
## "LES" WARK COMES OUT Picked Squad From Stanford California Game Will Go To Vancouver 
### 
With the addition of "Les" Wark to
the list of candidates for the Stanford-
California all-star rugby fifteen, the
number of contestants is complete. All
the rugby veterans available are out
trying for positions on what is heralded
as the strongest prospective combination
of rugby men on the Pacific Coast.
The personnel of the California squad
which comes here Saturday to complete
the dual line-up for the northern trip,
has so far been veiled in mystery; but
the most important athletes in the bay
university will compose the group.
Estimates of the proportion of Stan
ford men who will make positions on the
all-star fifteen, compared with the pro
portion of California men, vary from
twelve to fifteen, over half of the
final line-up will be formed of Stanford
players.
News from Vancouver and Victoria
indicates that enthusiasm is rife in those
cities at prospects of the California in
vasion, and the teams are practicing
daily in order to put their fifteens in top
form for the coming contests. Arrange
ments are already being made for seat
sales at the big games, and the supply
will be as scarce as it was at the Cali
fornia-Stanford football battle, accord
ing to newspaper comment.
Line-ups for the game on Saturday
will not be determined upon by Wylie
and Maloney until the arrival of the
California delegation; but two strong
fifteens are sure of taking the field
against each other. With the addition
of forward material from California, the
ultimate fifteen will be the best bal
anced in the history of the game.
