# BROWNE BELIEVES NEW P.C.C. POLICIES FAVOR STANFORD
## SPRING OVAL MEET HERE Co-operation of California and Stanford Noted by New President 
### 
Dr. A. D. Browne, on his return yes
terday from Seattle, where he represent
ed Stanford at the Pacific Coast Con
ference, in an interview explained the
decisions of the conference in relation
to Stanford's athletics for next year.
"The results of the meeting," he de
clared, "were entirely favorable to Stan
ford both in the schedules and policies
adopted."
For example, the conference field and
track meet will be held on the local field
May 14 and 15. Stanford will entertain
representatives of all conference univer
sities on those dates, as a special meet
ing of the conference will be held in
conjunction with the. track meet. In
addition, the next regular meeting of the
conference will be held at Stanford,
December 4, over which Dr. Browne as
president will preside.
An important substitution in the foot
ball schedule was distinctly favorable to
Stanford, in the opinion of the physical
director. Stanford instead of the Uni
versity of California will play the Uni
versity of Washington for the annual
"Big Game" of the northern school. The
Cardinal team will then have the ad
vantage of contesting the other two ma
jor pigskin aggregations on the coast
each fall. This scheduling will be ad
vantageous financially to our student
body as under a ruling adopted at the
conference each school will receive an
equal share of the gate receipts.
The rule that training tables shall be
limited to the evening meal was adopted
at the instance of the northern univer
sities. The action taken is to avoid the
financial loss which usually occurs with
the maintenance of the tables. The rul
ing follows the precedent of the Eastern

universities, most of whom have abol
ished the table.
Change in the status of several sports
was made by the conference. Cross
country running and water polo were
made conference sports, which, declared
the physical director, fits in with Stan
ford's policy of the encouragement of
these sports. In addition, the Northwest
champion wrestling team is scheduled
to come to Stanford for matches on a
date to be later announced.
"Especially noteworthy," said Dr.
Browne, "was the cordial co-operation
of the University of California with
Stanford." Througl out the conference
the delegates of the two schools were
able to work together for the promotion
of mutual interests.
