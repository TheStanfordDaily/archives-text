# A.E. WHYTE, M.P., WRITES FOR 'CARDINAL'
## Treatise On Labor Problems Is Especially Prepared For New Issue 
### 
Hon. A. E. Whyte, member of parlia,
ment who recently lectured here, has
prepared an articlc especially for the
December issue of the Cardinal, "Great
Britain and the Labor Party." Mr.
Whyte shows the trend of labor in
Great Britain, especially as regards the
labor party, and suggests the lines along
which the final settlement will he made.
The article is of particular interest in
that it is generally felt that England's
solution of the labor question will fur
nish the groundwork of dissipating the
present labor unrest in the United States,
and may influence greatly the decisions
of the Industrial Conference of which
Herbert Hoover, '95, is a member.
Dealing with the labor question from
a different, angle, J. D. Adams, '15, has
written on "The Industrial Conference."
Adams, a law graduate, has made a
particular study of the actual demands
of labor, especially in regard to meet
ing them by adequate legislation. The
article, written thus from the double
standpoint of a lawyer and a labor in
vestigator. gives exceptional weight to
his conclusions, and will be of interest
to all who are working toward a solu
tion of the present problems.
