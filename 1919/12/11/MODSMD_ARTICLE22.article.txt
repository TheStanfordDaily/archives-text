# WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

IT would be presumed that a college student studying history, economics and
allied subjects, supposed to be alive to the events of the times, would have
a fair knowledge of "who's who" and "what's what." Our University classes
would soon dispell any such illusion.
For example we hear of Eamon De Valera, the great Mexican bandit,
whom one girl was so foolish as to think was an I. W. W. connected with
the Centralia affair. We hear of Mr. Titloy, senator from Illinois, senator
from Washington, representative from Washington, president of the coal
miners' union, and I. W. W. suspect. He is usually democratic state chair
man. Everybody knows Woodrow Wilson. A few think on Carter Glass,
secretary of the interior, William G. McAdoo, secretary of the treasury, or
Franklin K. Lane, secretary of labor.
Of course you, yourself are not so ignorant as all that, but by way of
interest, ask yourself to name all the members of the president's cabinet.
Then recite the planks in the platform of the new labor party which was
just born in Detroit —or was it Cincinnati? What is the number of the con
gress just assembled? Which session? And by the way, what big event just
transpired in Michigan? Supposing you know all this, can you tell the latest
in the coal strike? Then as a crowning feat name the senators and rep
resentatives from your state!
The number of students who should be able to answer the above ques
tions, but can't, is appalling. If a university education with all its broaden
ing influence, etc., etc., hasn't given the students even a working knowledge
of public affairs it is a sign that there is something wrong somewhere. There
is no excuse for gross ignorance in an institution of higher education, with
"Lux Sit" for its motto. Better neglect sports and society a little and find
out what's happening—University of Washington Daily.
