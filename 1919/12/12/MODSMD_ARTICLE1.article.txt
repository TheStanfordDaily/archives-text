# PRESS CONDITIONS AT PEACE CONFERENCE ARE EXPLAINED
## WILSON THOUGHT TOO IDEALISTIC White Blames President For Stopping Sources Of American News 
### 
WILLIAM ALLEN WHITE in the
first of his two addresses last
night in the Assembly Hall, gave a
clear explanation of the difficulties
which constantly faced the American
press at the Peace Conference. Al
though there were seventy-five re
porters representing the newspapers
of the United States, in Paris, it was
practically impossible for these men
lo get any news except through the
British and French sources as to what
was actually going on. Mr. White put
the responsibility for these conditions
upon President Wilson. His reticence
stopped up all the news sources. Col.
House was the only man who could
get near President Wilson and then
he was not allowed to give out the
news. None of the other American
diplomats had any idea of what Presi
dent Wilson's intentions were and
they were in no way taken into the
confidence of the President, although
they were supposedly representing this
country at the most important con
ference this world has ever seen.
Mr. White pointed out some of the
difficulties under which President Wil
son went to Paris. The entire back
ground of American thought was es
sentially idealistic as far as the war
was concerned. President Wilson had
spoken to the American people in
idealistic terms and what he said had
been accepted. On the actual war
arena, however, conditions were en
tirely different. The people of Europe
had been faced with the realization
of war too long to be able to accept
philosophizing for practical and im
mediate measures. This was in a
way largely responsible for the dif
ference in point of view between the
President and such men as Clemen
ceau and Lloyd George.
At the conclusion of his speech, Mr.
White answered questions asked by
the audience.
This afternoon at 4:15, Mr. White
gave his second address on the in
dustrial conference which was held
recently in Washington, D. C. He
explained the conditions which ex
isted between the two factions and
the attempt which has been made at
reconciliation.
