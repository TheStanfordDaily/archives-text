# PRESS CONDITIONS AT PEACE CONFERENCE ARE EXPLAINED
## WILSON THOUGHT TOO IDEALISTIC White Blames President For Stopping Sources Of American News 
### 
WILLIAM ALLEN WHITE in the
first of his two addresses last
night in the Assembly Hall, gave a
clear explanation of the difficulties
which constantly faced the American
press at the Peace Conference. Al
though there were seventy-five re
porters representing the newspapers
of the United States, in Paris, it was
practically impossible for these men
lo get any news except through the
British and French sources as to what
was actually going on. Mr. White put
the responsibility for these conditions
upon President Wilson. His reticence
stopped up all the news sources. Col.
House was the only man who could
get near President Wilson and then
he was not allowed to give out the
news. None of the other American
diplomats had any idea of what Presi
dent Wilson's intentions were and
they were in no way taken into the
confidence of the President, although
they were supposedly representing this
country at the most important con
ference this world has ever seen.
Mr. White pointed out some of the
difficulties under which President Wil
son went to Paris. The entire back
ground of American thought was es
sentially idealistic as far as the war
