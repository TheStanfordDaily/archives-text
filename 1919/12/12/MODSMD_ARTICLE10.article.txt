# RED CROSS CAMPAIGN NETS LARGE RETURNS
## Income From Sale of Seals Exceeds Any Previous Canvass 
### 
First detailed returns of the sale of
Red Cross Christmas seals show that
the first three days of the drive have
netted three hundred dollars. This sale
represents the highest mark ever reached
in Red Cross campaigns in campus his
tory. The largest previous purchase of
stamps was in 1915 for $91. A large
amount of seals are in the hands of
salesmen who have not reported.
Ten thousand dollars has been set as
the goal for Santa Clara County to the
managers of the drive by the State Red
Cross Society, and the county headquar
ters has apportioned $1,000 of this sum
as Stanford's quota. With three days
left in which to conduct the drive on
the campus, the campaign managers be
