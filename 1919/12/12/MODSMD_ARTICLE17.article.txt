issue, an article entitled "The
Danube." The author describes his
experiences up and down this romantic
river of south-eastern Europe during
the period of the armistice, when
Serbs, Hungarians and Roumanians
were contending for control. Numer

scenery and surrounding along this
historic stream.
Professor H. C. Brown has written
a very timely and interesting article

Opinion."
Exceptionally good stories have
been contributed by J. A. Quinby, '18,
and A. F. Binns, '22. Quinby writes
"The Road to Very," and Binns gives
the local coloring of the northwestern
lumbering country in a story entitled
"Logs."
Dr. David Starr Jordan again shows
bis versatility by contributing a poem
of exceptional merit entitled "I Heard
a Lark." Other poems included in
