lITHEN the forms are locked today and the press starts its roll, our last
" issue will be on its way to the readers of the Daily Palo Alto. We feel
it to be opportune for us to express here our appreciation of the loyal work
of the staff members. In proof that there is an increased interest among
the student body in the Daily Palo Alto, the number of tryoutees this quarter
was nearly double that of any previous tryout period. Those who success
fully withstood the elimination process, have harmoniously worked toward
the making of a better student paper.
We realize fully that we have made mistakes. However, we have con
scientiously attempted to speak for the students, and at times when student
body opinion was undivided, to lead the way. We have not at all times
succeeded in this, but we have forced our students to think on matters of
not. onlv local, but far-reaching interests, and this result in itself has been
» us.
he future of the Daily:—The time has come when the University
n its paper. The Daily Palo Alto must be enlarged to success
t correct influence, and to do this a larger press must be in
\ope that this will soon be accomplished, and we are confident
-jditor will have a successful term.
