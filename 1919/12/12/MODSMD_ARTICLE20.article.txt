# Christmas Spirit Is Expressed By Recital
## 
### 
The real Christmas spirit of renewed
hope, of trimuph and rejoicing was ex
pressed in the music of the organ recital
at the Memorial Church Thursday after
noon. Warren D. Allen, University or
ganist, selected four compositions for
the program that in different ways ex
pressed the atmosphere of Christmas.
One of the most beautiful numbers
was Guilmont's "Fantasy on Two
Noels," in which "Adeste Fidelis" by
Louis Daquin, charmed the hearer with
the delicate beauty of the flute tones.
The theme expressed a somewhat sedate
happiness.
The most imaginative composition
played was Otto Mailing's "Shepherds
in the Field." Opening with a quaint
melody of medieval suggestion, it rises
to a climax of vibrating chords, and in
the change from the quiet pastoral to
the sublime chorus, depicts the Christ
mas story.
