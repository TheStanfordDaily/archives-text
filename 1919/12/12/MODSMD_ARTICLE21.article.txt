# English Class Will Present One-Act Plays

### 
The remainder of the series of one
act plays which are being given by
Miss Buckingham's class in Vocal In
terpretation will be given Friday, Sat
urday, and Monday eveninys in the
Little Theatre at 8 o'clock and on
Saturday afternoon at 3:30. The class,
which has chosen for itself the title
of the "dramatic workshop," is pre
senting these plays entirely through
the management and direction of
members of the class, the producer
of each play being responsible for its
rehearsals, costumes, and properties.
It is the purpose of the class to carry
out the Little Theatre plan and to
develop individual initiative.
