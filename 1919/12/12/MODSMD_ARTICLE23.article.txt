# ROAD PAST ENCINA GYM BEING BUILT
## PART OF FUTURE PLANS This Road Forms Link In Approach to Campus From Palo Alto 
### 
The University authorities have a
gang of workmen grading a stretch of
roadway alongside the trollev track past
the men's gymnasium and Encina Hall,
which will form a link in a new and
more direct route from Palo Alto to
the residence district on the campus.
The most convenient course between
these two points when the system is
completed will take the road that runs
from Palm Drive past the Faculty Club
house to the trolley track, where it will
bend to the right along the new piece
of road, following the car tracks and
then to Alvarado Row.
In the near future the road will be
continued from the point where it strikes
Alvarado Row in a loop around to the
postoffice, cutting through the site of
two or three houses now standing on
Alvarado Row and Salvatierra street,
furnishing still more easy access to the
whole of the residence district of the
college campus. Ultimately the system
will be developed from this point by
the filling in of a few links to make a
continuous road between the campus
and Palo Alto on the west side of Palm
Drive also.
The new approach to the campus is
made desirable as a substitute for the
old route straight out Palm Drive and
past the Quad by th ebuilding of the
new library and the development of the
new Quadrangle. The route now being
developed, utilizing roadways alreadv
constructed for the most part, obviates
the disadvantages of sending traffic so
near the University classrooms, which
are disturbed by it, and gives an equal
ly easy access to all parts of the resi
