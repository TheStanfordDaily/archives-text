# Juniors May Take Quad Pictures During Week
## 
### 
Juniors who have not taken pictures
for the 1921 Quad may be photographed
by "Davy" in Palo Alto tomorrow or
during examination week, regardless of
whether or not dues liave been paid.
The management expects that the reg
ular junior photographic section will be
closed after the holidays, and pictures
which arc not taken before vacation will
appear only in the auxiliary junior sec
tion ; that is, the pages reserved for
juniors entering college after Christmas.
