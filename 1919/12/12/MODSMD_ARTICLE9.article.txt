### 
MADAME JEANNE R. IIOULLIEII,
of Palo Alto, mother of Mrs. Mar
celle Henriette Roullier Calley, who
graduated from the University in
15)15, and who died June 16, 1918, has
established a tuition scholarship in
memory of her daughter.
Marcelle Rouiller was graduated
from the Romanic Language depart
ment in which she won Phi Beta
Kappa through her excellent scholar
ship. Mrs. Roullier, in a letter to
President Wilbur, says that she in
tended to establish a scholarship in
the Romanic Language department for
a woman student as a memorial, but
on reading of the offer of the under
graduate student to establish tuition
scholarships if other students would
do the same she was impressed with
the idea that it would be better to
help a young man or woman to get an
education from the beginning than to
reward a student after she had se
cured that start towards an educa
tion.
Today she sent to the University
through Dr. Wilbur, ner check in pay
ment of the first of the annual
scholarships she has founded. This
check will pay the tuition of one stu
dent for all four quarters of the year,
so that it is probable that more than
a single student will be benefited by
her gift each year.
