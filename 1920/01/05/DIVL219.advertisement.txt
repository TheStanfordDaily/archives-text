Electricity—
the Master Force in Manufacturing
THE marvels of electricity have revolutionized our manu
facturing industries. With belts and pulleys replaced
by electric motors operating automatic —almost human
machines, many a slow and tedious process has been elimi
nated. The factory worker s task of yesterday is made
pleasant by his command of this magic power.
The Crane Company's plant at Chicago—electrical through
out —is a model of industrial efficiency. Its 10,000 horse
power of driving energy is brought by three small wires
from a distant power plant. Then electricity drives the
machinery which handles the coal for heating, cuts the steel,
sifts the sand and sorts the material —in fact does everything
from scrubbing the floor to winding the clock.
Such an institution is marvelous—superhuman—made thus
by the man-multiplying force of electricity. The General
Electric Company has been instrumental in effecting this
evolution. First, by developing successful electric gener
ating and transmission apparatus to furnish economically
this modern form of power. Secondly, through many years
of active co-operation with hundreds of manufacturers, it
has mastered the art of applying the use of electrical energy
to a multitude of needs. And finally, through branch
offices and other distributing channels, its products are
made accessible to all.
