spite of the extra heavy registration,
perhaps from war conditions, and the
fraternity rushing season. >
Mortality statistics, given out from the
Registrar's office today show that only
10 per cent of the men students had de
ftciences in scholarship which were seri
ous enough to give them a first failure
or cause their withdrawal from the Uni
versity. Only nineteen women students
had serious deficiencies in scholarship.
Eighty-four men students were dis
missed from the University, and 109
were given a first failure. These figures
cover 10 per cent of the men in the
University. In addition to the above,
seventy-three men students were placed
