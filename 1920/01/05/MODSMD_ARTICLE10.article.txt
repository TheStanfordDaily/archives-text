# RAM'S HEAD SHOW ON FEBRUARY 7TH
## 
### 
February 7 is the date selected by the
Ram's Head Society for the production
(if their annual show. The play and
original songs are still in the process of
composition, but the general lines of the
performance are to be based on the form
of a musical extravaganza similar to the
successful "Biff! l'%ng! Bullsheveek!"
of last year.
Nearly all the stars of that Russian
riot are in college this year and with a
wealth of new material, prospects are
favorable for a repetition of Ram's
Head success. The leading feature of
the Ram's Head burjesquc will be the
"actresses" in the production, whose
parts will be taken by female impersona
tors.
