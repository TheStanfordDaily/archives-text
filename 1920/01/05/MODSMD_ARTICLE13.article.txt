# UNIVERSITY WILL HOLD REFERENDUM ON PEACE TREATY
## 
### 
Stanford University will participate in
an intercollegiate referendum on the
Peace Treaty, to be held Tuesday, Jan
uary 13. It is a non-partisan election,
and no propaganda whatever will be cir
culated in regard to it. The plan is sole
ly to stimulate discussion in the acade
mic communities and to obtain as ac
curate as possible expression of college
sentiment. The feeling is that the edu
cational results of this effort will be very
great, and that the indication of senti
ment thus obtained will be enlightening
to every one concerned.
The election will be held on the Quad
and the following six propositions will
be voted on (the voters are to vote on
only one of the six) :
1. I favor the ratification of the
League and Treaty, without amend
ments or reservations
2. I am opposed to the ratification of
the League and Treaty in any form.
3. 1 am in favor of the ratification of
the Treaty and League but only with the
specific reservations as voted by the ma
jority of the Senate.
4. I favor any compromise on the res
ervations that will make possible imme-
mediate ratification of the Treaty and
League.
5. I favor the Government proceed
ing to make peace with Germany at once
and leaving the question of a League of
Nations to be settled afterwards.
6. I favor a compromise of such a
character as will avoid the danger of de
feating ratification while making clear
that America can only be involved in
war by a declaration of Congress, that
domestic questions and the Monroe Doc
trine are entirely outside of the jurisdic
tion of the League, that plural votes of
any members are all to be disqualified in
the event of a dispute wherein we are
disqualified from voting, and that on de
ciding to withdraw, we are to be the
judge of whether our obligations have
been met.
