# EXCEPTION MADE TO ONE YEAR DORMITORY RULING
## IN EFFECT THIS QUARTER Freshmen May Now Live in Their Fraternity Houses 
### 
MEN students, who have been living in
the dormitories during the past
quarter, will be permitted to live else
where on the campus for the balance of
the present year, provided that the Dean
of Men can secure a suitable substitute
for their room on the dormitory. A
letter was received by Dean McDowell
today from President Wilbur authoriz
ing this action.
This action will permit fraternity
freshmen pledges to live in their respec
tive houses for the balance of the year.
Incoming freshmen, however, must re
main in the dormitories for one quarter.
Although not applying directly to the
one-year dormitory rule for freshmen,
the action taken by President Wilbur
virtually makes a temporary exception to
the ride.
The letter to Dean McDowell follows:
Mr. J. E. McDowell.
Dean of Men.
Dear Mr. McDowell:
For the balance of the present year
you are authorized to permit any man
student who has lived in either dormi
tory for at least one quarter to live else
where on the campus, provided you can
secure a substitute for his room in the
dormitory.
You are authorized to assign only two
men to each double room in the base
ment of Encina Hall.
Yours very truly,
RAY LYMAN WILBUR,
President.
It is understood Uiat the above ac
tion was taken as a result of the crowded
condition of the men's dormitories.
