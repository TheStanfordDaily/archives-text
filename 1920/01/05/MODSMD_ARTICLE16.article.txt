# Stanford Rugby Stars Victorious
## Card'-U.C. Combine Sweeps the North For Four Big Wins 
### 
Stanford rugby stars returned to the
campus today after scoring a clean
sweep of their games in the Christ
mas invasion of tthe north. Four vic
tories out of four starts marked their
success, and for the first time in in
tercollegiate history the California
goal line remained untouched by the
northern teams.
Combined Vancouver went down to
defeat before the Californians in the
first game 3 to 0. The University of
British Columbia was the next victim,
8 to 0. A second contest against com
bined Vancouver was won by Wiley's
men by 3 to 0, after the hardest battle
of the schedule. The Victoria All-
Stars were beaten in the last game
10 to 4, after scoring the only points
made against California by a field
I goal.
Interest in rugby was promoted to
I such an extent by the extraordinary
I achievement of the local fifteen that
the University of British Columbia
has determined to apply for an annual
"Big Game" against Stanford. The
record of the Californians is the more
remarkable since the northern teams
presented formidable opposition as
usual, in spite of athletic handicaps
consequent upon war. Another tour
has been arranged for next year, as
well as an invasion of the Stafford
soccerites planned for June.
The combined strength of Stanford
and California has been named as the
logical defender of the United States
in the Olympic games, if rugby is de
cided on as one of the sports.
In appreciation of Harry Maloney's
work as trainer and manager, the team
presented him with a chafing dish on
the homeward voyage.
