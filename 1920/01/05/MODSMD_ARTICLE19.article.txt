# A 						WISE MOVE
## 
### 
niHE announcement coming today from the Office of the Dean of Men that
President Wilbur has granted authority for men who have lived one quarter
in the university dormitories to live outside of the dormitory this year if they
so desire and a substitute can be found is a gratifying one. Under the ex
isting circumstances we believe that no better move could have been made.
With the unusually large registration the halls have been crowded to capacity
and in addition a large number of men were forced to live in Palo Alto. The
temporary suspension of the one year dormitory rule, resulting of course in
the fraternity pledges moving to their respective houses, will allow most of
these men to reside on the campus. For all Stanford students to live on
the campus has been the aim of Stanford people for a long time and we think
that this decision makes it one step closer.
