# Women's Privileges Outlined in Grant
## Student Affairs Committee Defines Boundaries of Self-Government 
### 
Questions concerirug the scope of the
self-government privileges of the organ
ized women of Stanford University
have been definitely settled in a grant
of powers, which has been drafted by
the Student Affairs Committee upon the
recommendation of the Women's Con
ference, delegating certain privileges and
establishing the limit' of their authority.
The grant will be passed upon by Wom
en's Conference some time this week.
The grant consists for the most part
in a codification of existing practices.
The powers of Women's Conference as
specified in the grant are two â€”the privi
lege of recommending to the Student
Affairs Committee amendments or addi
tions to the existing University regu
lations, subject to the approval of the
president; and the authority to make
other rulings of a non-disciplinary na
ture.
Women's Council is formally accord
ed the power to exercise judicial func
tions in matters relating to the conduct
of women students. In other words,
Council shall enforce the University reg
ulations, and recommend to the Student
Affairs Committee punishments for the
violations of these rulings, except in ex
treme or urgent cases when the commit
tee will act.
The grant of authority further states
that Conference and Council are to
transmit their recommendations to Stu
dent Affairs Committee through the of
fice of the Dean of Women. Minutes
of the meetings of both organizations
must be filed in the Dean's office during
the vacation periods. Minutes shall in
clude full details of procedures relat
ing to discipline. A full report of the
activities of both organizations and a
list of their members must be presented
to the Student Affairs Committee at
the close of each quarter.
It is thought that this definite state
ment of the powers of the organized
women will clear up the misunderstand
ing which has heretofore existed, and
will make for more efficient student gov
ernment.
The ten-thirty rule lias been excepted
on Friday and Saturday nights, enabl
ing women students to return from San
Francisco on the theater train, and to
sign out until 11:30 for functions other
than campus dances, such as the movies,
as was announced at the close of last
quarter. The new pr vileges were grant
ed by the Student Affairs Committee
upon the recommendation of Women's
Conference. It will be noted that the
exceptions apply to Friday and Satur
day nights only.
