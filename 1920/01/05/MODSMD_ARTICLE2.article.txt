# Women's Privileges Outlined in Grant
## Student Affairs Committee Defines Boundaries of Self-Government 
### 
Questions concerirug the scope of the
self-government privileges of the organ
ized women of Stanford University
have been definitely settled in a grant
of powers, which has been drafted by
the Student Affairs Committee upon the
recommendation of the Women's Con
ference, delegating certain privileges and
establishing the limit' of their authority.
The grant will be passed upon by Wom
en's Conference some time this week.
The grant consists for the most part
in a codification of existing practices.
The powers of Women's Conference as
specified in the grant are two â€”the privi
lege of recommending to the Student
Affairs Committee amendments or addi
tions to the existing University regu
lations, subject to the approval of the
president; and the authority to make
other rulings of a non-disciplinary na
ture.
Women's Council is formally accord
ed the power to exercise judicial func
tions in matters relating to the conduct
of women students. In other words,
Council shall enforce the University reg
ulations, and recommend to the Student
Affairs Committee punishments for the
violations of these rulings, except in ex
treme or urgent cases when the commit
tee will act.
