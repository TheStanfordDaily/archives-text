IT the start of each quarter the circulation department of the Daily Palo
Alto is confronted with the problem of securing the correct address of
the registered students of the University. Since a large proportion of our
subscribers are registered students and live off the campus, this is necessary
to make correct delivery. The Registrar is making every effort to furnish
us with this list as soon as possible arid within the week we should have it.
In the meantime we ask the forebearance of our subscribers. Every endeavor
is being made this quarter to see that proper delivery of the Daily is made.
The Business Director is to have office hours from 1 to 2 p.m. daily, in our
office in the Press Building and subscribers failing to receive their paper
will confer a favor 011 the management if they will either call in person at
those hours or telephone Palo Alto 1074.
