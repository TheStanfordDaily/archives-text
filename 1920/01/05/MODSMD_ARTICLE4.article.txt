# "Aristocratic" is Chappie Issue Out Tomorrow
## 
### 
Chaparral will offer its "Aristocra
tic" number to the campus public on
the Quad tomorrow morning. The
issue features more than the custom
ary number of drawings by the best
campus artists, including a clever girl
and auto cover design by Dale Mac-
Boyle, '20. An effort has been made
to make the Newyear's Chappie the
most popular the comic has yet
issued. â€ž
The management states that the
publication will print more copies than
previously, in order that not many of
the Caparral readers will be disap
pointed, as was the case last month.
