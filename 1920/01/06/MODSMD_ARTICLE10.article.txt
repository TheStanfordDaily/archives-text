## 
### 
Juniors who have not taken pictures
for the 1921 Quad may report now at
Davey's in Palo Alto for sittings, the
management announced this morning.
Because of the rainy weather before
vacation and other poor studio condi
tions, many who appeared at the
photographer's were not accommo
dated. Davey is prepared to take
care of the remaining juniors now.
The Quad editor requests the help
of all 1921 students in the matter of
pictures, as the preparation of a
photographic section of the yearbook
is a difficult one and cannot be ac
complished without the aid of all the
juniors. The completed section forms
an important record of the 1921 class.
