# STUDENTS WILL VOTE ON DISPOSITION OF SURPLUS
## Funds Available for Athletics 
### 
a three or four thousand dollar surplus which the Board of
Athletic Control will have available, will be used for financing the crew,
or for constructing a basketball pavilion will be the subject of a referendum
vote of the students at an election to be held in the near future. A decision
to hold such an election was reached recently and was announced today.

The election probably will be held in
a week in order that student opinion on
the alternate propositions may have time
to crystalize. The Athletic Board has
prepared a set of arguments which favor
appropriating the surplus for the erec
tion of a basketball pavilion and a sec
ond set which favors appropriating the
money for crew assistance.
The statement of the Board issued to
day follows:
After paying for the new bleachers
and setting aside amounts sufficient to
meet the urgent requirements of the
gymnasium and athletic fields (including
a resurfacing of the track) the Board of
Athletic Control finds that there will be
available for further use from $3,000 to
$4,000. There are many uses to which
this money could be put, the financing
of the crew with the purchase of needed
equipment and the building of a basket
ball pavilion being perhaps the most
urgent.
The Board of Athletic Control is de
sirous of following the wishes of the
students in the expenditure of this
money and has therefore requested that
the student representatives of the Board
conduct a referendum vote among the
students in order that their wishes in
this matter may be known.
