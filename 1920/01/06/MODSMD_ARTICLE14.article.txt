# STUDENTS WILL VOTE ON DISPOSITION OF SURPLUS
## Funds Available for Athletics 
### 
a three or four thousand dollar surplus which the Board of
Athletic Control will have available, will be used for financing the crew,
or for constructing a basketball pavilion will be the subject of a referendum
vote of the students at an election to be held in the near future. A decision
to hold such an election was reached recently and was announced today.

The election probably will be held in
a week in order that student opinion on
the alternate propositions may have time
to crystalize. The Athletic Board has
prepared a set of arguments which favor
appropriating the surplus for the erec
tion of a basketball pavilion and a sec
ond set which favors appropriating the
money for crew assistance.
The statement of the Board issued to
day follows:
After paying for the new bleachers
and setting aside amounts sufficient to
meet the urgent requirements of the
gymnasium and athletic fields (including
a resurfacing of the track) the Board of
Athletic Control finds that there will be
available for further use from $3,000 to
$4,000. There are many uses to which
this money could be put, the financing
of the crew with the purchase of needed
equipment and the building of a basket
ball pavilion being perhaps the most
urgent.
The Board of Athletic Control is de
sirous of following the wishes of the
students in the expenditure of this
money and has therefore requested that
the student representatives of the Board
conduct a referendum vote among the
students in order that their wishes in
this matter may be known.

problem:
Arguments for appropriating available
funds for the erection of a basket-ball
pavilion:
1. With an unusually large number of
men signing up the need for additional
basket-ball courts is pressing.
2. The present gymnasium courts are
laid on a solid foundation, and past ex
perience shows that a team can never
be kept in the best condition when prac
ticing on these courts.
3. The present gymnasium floor has
only limited facilities for spectators, and
the revenue from additional attendance
at games would pay a large percentage
of the cost of a pavilion the first year.
4. Rowing should not be continued at
Stanford for the following reasons:
(a) The natural advantages necessary
for rowing are not present, and our
crews must always train under disad
vantageous conditions.
b) Crew will never become a sport for'
the many. Participation in actual races

will be very limited.
(c) It is not desirable from the stand
point of the spectator. The majority of
Stanford students have never seen a
rrf>w race.
i of financing crew rep
annual loss, and other
Ter because of this ex
:w budget for 1916 was
917, $3,561.36. In 1919
nning crew under most
tions was $1,287. The
:ded equipment and the
e coming season will re
-300 to $6,000, which will
represent a toial loss.
(c) The physical effects of rowing
are a matter of considerable argument.
Arguments in favor of using the
available funds for financing crew:
1. The failure to make a substantial
appropriation for crew virtually means
the discontinuance of rowing as a sport
at Stanford. There would be little like
lihood of the sport ever being revived
after once being discontinued.
2. Crew is a desirable sport for the
following reasons:
(a) The criticism that it is a sport
for the few is not valid. From sixty to
one hundred men have always reported
in past seasons, and at least thirty have
remained throughout the season. This
compares favorably with the number
participating in other major sports.
(/;) Crew is one of the oldest and
manliest of college sports and is par
ticipated in by few colleges only because
of the fact that facilities for rowing are

present at only a small per cent of the
colleges.
3. Stanford crews have been unusually
successful. In fourteen Varsity races,
California has finished first but three
times The successes of crews sent
East have done more to put Stanford on
the athletic map than any other team
ever developed.
4. Failure to appropriate the available
funds for a basket-ball pavilion will not
necessitate a discontinuance of the sport,
but merely means that it will be con
tinued under existing; conditions.
