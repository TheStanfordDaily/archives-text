# STANFORD WILL MEET ANZAC'S RUGBY TEAM
## Cardinal Ruggers Will Go to Sacramento For Third Game 
### 
Inter-collegiate rugby for the winter
quarter begins on Saturday, when
Stanford meets the strong Davis Farm
Australians at Buffalo Park, Sacra
mento, in the first scheduled game of
the University Rugby Union.
Stanford will be represented by
practically the same team which made
such a notable record in the north
during Christmas. The only great
loss in the former All-Star line-up is
that of the California forward, Rag
gio. who made a fine showing in the
Vancouver contests.
The Anzacs and Stanford have play
ed two matches, to date. In the first
game, on the local field. Stanford was
the victor, defeating the Davis Farm
men 21 to 13. Australia evened the
play in the second game at Sacra
mento on Thanksgiving, by winning
from Stanford on a wind-swept field,
where cold and rain impeded good
play for either team. The third game
between the two rivals for supremacy
in the league will break the tie. The
Cardinal fifteen goes on the field a
slight favorite, thanks to its record in
the north, and a victory will put It
at the head of the league.
Twenty men will entrain on Satur
day morning, accompanied by Harry
Maloney and Jim Wvlie, the coaches.
The complete winter schedule of the
league will be made public after the
next executive meeting of the organi
zation, which is to be held in San
Francisco tomorrow night.
