# BASKETBALL vs. CREW

### 
fTHE BOARD OF ATHLETIC CONTROL today announces that a referendum
election is to be held to determine whether a three to four thousand dol
lar paper surplus shall be awarded to crew or to basketball. This election
is to determine the opinion of all undergraduates, and in fact of all members
of the Associated Students. Supporters of basketball claim that the award
«IB necessary t. O basketeball to construct a new pavilion, this being essential
from their point of view to place the sport on a firm footing and to enable
Stanford to turn out a winning team. They also claim that crew is a sport
for the few, both from the standpoint of the participants- and of the spec
tators. Crew adherents on the other hand realize that failure to award a
substantial allowance to the sport practically means a discontinuance of the
sport here and are apparently able to advance just as able arguments as to
why it should be continued. The fact that our crews have been so success
ful and have made a name for Stanford in the athletic world is, of course,
a strong point in their favor. What is desired in this election is a truly
representative vote and for that reason every student must vote. What do
you think about it? In order to get a thorough expression of student opinion
the Daily will welcome communications on the question and will publish as
many as our space will permit.
