## 
### 
Several renovations have been made
in the Stanford Bookstore (luring the
Christmas holidays. Formerly the
store has been crowded for room, but
an increase in space has been ac
complished by dividing the stock into
three departments, the book, labora
tory equipment, and art department,
the miscellaneous department (engi
neering supplies, note paper, pens,
pte.) and the stationery department.
As a further innovation, the Book
store has done away with the agency
for the Bank of Palo Alto, and with
the handling of street, car and railroad
accommodation tickets because it was
found that this work interfered seri
ously with the regular Bookstore
work. For the same reason, the
County Library branch has been
moved to the primary school.
