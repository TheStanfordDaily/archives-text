## WILLIS MAKES STATEMENT Vote to Show the Attitude of University to Be Held Tuesday 
### 
IN conncction with the referendum on
the peace treaty to be held under the
direction of the Daily Palo Alto next
Tuesday, January 13, the opinions of
several members of the Faculty in re
gard to the league have been secured.

The six propositions that the faculty
and students will vote on in the Treaty
Referendum, held by the Daily Palo
Alto, next Tuesday, read as follows:
1. I favor the ratification of the
League and Treaty, without any
amendments or reservations.
2. lam opposed to the ratifica
tion of the League and Treaty in
any form.
3. I am in favor of the ratifi
cation of the Treaty and League
but only with the specific reser
vations as voted by the majority
of the Senate.
4. I favor any compromise on
the reservation that will make
possible immediate ratification of
the Treaty and League.
5. I favor the Government pro
ceeding to make peace with
Germany at once and leaving the
question of a League of Nations
to be settled afterwards.
6. I favor a compromise of such
a character as will avoid the
danger of defeating ratification
while making clear that America
can only be involved in war by a
declaration of Congress, that dom
estic questions and the Monroe
Doctrine are entirely outside of
the jurisdiction of the League,
that plural votes of any members
are all to be disqualified in the
event of a dispute wherein we are
disqualified from voting, and that
on deciding to withdraw, we are
to be the judge of whether our
obligations have been met.

President Wilbur stated today that
