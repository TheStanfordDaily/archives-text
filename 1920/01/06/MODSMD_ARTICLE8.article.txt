# MEMBERS OF FACULTY FAVOR THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS
## WILLIS MAKES STATEMENT Vote to Show the Attitude of University to Be Held Tuesday 
### 
IN conncction with the referendum on
the peace treaty to be held under the
direction of the Daily Palo Alto next
Tuesday, January 13, the opinions of
several members of the Faculty in re
gard to the league have been secured.

The six propositions that the faculty
and students will vote on in the Treaty
Referendum, held by the Daily Palo
Alto, next Tuesday, read as follows:
1. I favor the ratification of the
League and Treaty, without any
amendments or reservations.
2. lam opposed to the ratifica
tion of the League and Treaty in
any form.
3. I am in favor of the ratifi
cation of the Treaty and League
but only with the specific reser
vations as voted by the majority
of the Senate.
4. I favor any compromise on
the reservation that will make
possible immediate ratification of
the Treaty and League.
5. I favor the Government pro
ceeding to make peace with
Germany at once and leaving the
question of a League of Nations
to be settled afterwards.
6. I favor a compromise of such
a character as will avoid the
danger of defeating ratification
while making clear that America
can only be involved in war by a
declaration of Congress, that dom
estic questions and the Monroe
Doctrine are entirely outside of
the jurisdiction of the League,
that plural votes of any members
are all to be disqualified in the
event of a dispute wherein we are
disqualified from voting, and that
on deciding to withdraw, we are
to be the judge of whether our
obligations have been met.

President Wilbur stated today that
he favored the ratification of tlie league
with reasonable interpretative amend
ments, but without change in either the
preamble or in Article Ten.
Chancellor Jordan stated that he fav
ored the league with such amendments
that were not silly or suicidal to our in
terests.
Professor Bailey Willis issued the fol
lowing statement today in regard to his
attitude on the league: "I was unquali
fiedly in favor of ratification of the
league and treaty without amendment or
qualification, because I wished to see
America take the leadership of the world
on the great moral issues of the day.
That aspiration has for the time being
been nullified by the Little Americans
in the Senate. They have sacrificed
American ideals to their pettiness and
provincialism. To retrieve our position
as soon as possible I am in favor of
immediate ratification under any terms
that will make us a working partner of
our allies to restore peace."
Professor E. D. Adams, recently re
turned from Europe stated that he fav
ored ratification with the reservations as
voted by the Senate, with the exception
that lie was not in favor of the reserva
tion that objected to the plural vote of
England, his reason being a conviction
that the future interests of America will
be better served by giving individual
votes to Australia and to Canada than
by refusing them an independent voice.
The Daily Palo Alto and others pro
moting the vote bel'eve that every one
must agree that it is of supreme im
portance that this issue be intgiellently
discussed by the wMle American pub
lic. In no centers should this discussion
be more fruitful or valuable than in the
academic communities.

direction of the Daily Palo Alto next
Tuesday, January 13, the opinions of
several members of the Faculty in re
gard to the league have been secured.

The six propositions that the faculty
and students will vote on in the Treaty
Referendum, held by the Daily Palo
Alto, next Tuesday, read as follows:
1. I favor the ratification of the
League and Treaty, without any
amendments or reservations.
2. lam opposed to the ratifica
tion of the League and Treaty in
any form.
3. I am in favor of the ratifi
cation of the Treaty and League
but only with the specific reser
vations as voted by the majority
of the Senate.
4. I favor any compromise on
the reservation that will make
possible immediate ratification of
the Treaty and League.
5. I favor the Government pro
ceeding to make peace with
Germany at once and leaving the
question of a League of Nations
to be settled afterwards.
6. I favor a compromise of such
a character as will avoid the
danger of defeating ratification
while making clear that America
can only be involved in war by a
declaration of Congress, that dom
estic questions and the Monroe
Doctrine are entirely outside of
the jurisdiction of the League,
that plural votes of any members
are all to be disqualified in the
event of a dispute wherein we are
disqualified from voting, and that
on deciding to withdraw, we are
to be the judge of whether our
obligations have been met.

President Wilbur stated today that
he favored the ratification of tlie league
with reasonable interpretative amend
ments, but without change in either the
preamble or in Article Ten.
Chancellor Jordan stated that he fav
ored the league with such amendments
that were not silly or suicidal to our in
terests.
Professor Bailey Willis issued the fol
lowing statement today in regard to his
attitude on the league: "I was unquali
fiedly in favor of ratification of the
league and treaty without amendment or
qualification, because I wished to see
America take the leadership of the world
on the great moral issues of the day.
That aspiration has for the time being
been nullified by the Little Americans
in the Senate. They have sacrificed
American ideals to their pettiness and
provincialism. To retrieve our position
as soon as possible I am in favor of
immediate ratification under any terms
that will make us a working partner of
our allies to restore peace."
Professor E. D. Adams, recently re
turned from Europe stated that he fav
ored ratification with the reservations as
voted by the Senate, with the exception
that lie was not in favor of the reserva
tion that objected to the plural vote of
England, his reason being a conviction
that the future interests of America will
be better served by giving individual
votes to Australia and to Canada than
by refusing them an independent voice.
The Daily Palo Alto and others pro
moting the vote bel'eve that every one
must agree that it is of supreme im
portance that this issue be intgiellently
discussed by the wMle American pub
lic. In no centers should this discussion
be more fruitful or valuable than in the
academic communities.
