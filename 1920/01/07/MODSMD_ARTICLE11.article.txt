# Consolidation of D.P.A. Offices Is Plan of Writer

### 
Enlargement of the Daily Palo Alto
and the placing of the general super
vision of the publication in the hands
of the Editor-in-Chief instead of hav
ing the business management and the
editorial department separately is ad
vocated by Neil H. Petree, *19, former
editor, in an article written for the
January issue of the Stanford Illust
rated Review.
Petree goes over the present short
comings of tlife "Daily," showing that
Stanford has outgrown its small five
column paper, and discusses the pos
sibilities of its enlargement as soon
as the University can provide the nec
essary press facilities. A larger paper
could be printed at about the same
cost as at present and it would not
be necessary to fill so much of the
editorial space with advertisements.
It is the plan of the Daily Palo Alto
management to make this change as
soon as feasible. There is enough
news on the campus to fill twice as
much space as is now available.
Petree suggests changes in the pres
ent plan of management, which would
give the Editor-in-Chief more control
as in other newspapers.
Under the present system, Petree
maintains, the editor must shoulder
the blame for inefficiency and is un
able to build up a better system.
