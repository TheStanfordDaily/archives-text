# Printers' Strikes Hold Up Needed Textbooks
## 
### 
The Stanford Bookstore announces
the arrival of Ames' "Equity," Vol. I,
and Huffcut's "Negotiable Instru
ments."
Much difficulty has been experienced
by the Bookstore in obtaining the re
quired textbooks from the publishers
for the current quarter, because of
labor difficulties in the East. Prac
tically twenty-five per cent of the
books ordered have not yet arrived,
but every effort is being made to
speed up shipments and to secure suf
ficient supplies to meet the student de
mand.
