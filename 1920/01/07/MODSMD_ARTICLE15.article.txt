# REFERENDUM VOTE ON SURPLUS WILL BE HELD TUESDAY
## QUESTION UP TO VOTERS Opinion On Propositions Is About Evenly Divided 
### 
Next Tuesday has been set as the date
for the special Quad election for the
student referendum vote which will de
cide- whether the athletic surplus of
three or four thousand dollars will be
used for financing the crew or for con
structing a new basketball pavilion.
Ihe Board of Athletic Control has
decided to submit the question to the
student body in order that student opin
ion may determine the course for them
to follow. After paying for the new
bleachers and setting aside amounts suf
ficient to meet the urgent requirements
of the gymnasium and athletic fields, the
board finds t here is from $3,000 to $4,000
available for further use.
The advocates for basketball come
fortli with the argument that the surplus
should be spent in the building of a new
pavilion. It is claimed by them that it
is not only necessary to accommodate
the large number of candidates that
are coming out for basketball, but it is
also urged because the present floor is
said to be unsuitable to use for the
practice of the varsity and freshman
squads. On account of the solid floor
now used it is claimcd to be impossible

Crew advocates are asking for the
money in order that they will be able
to maintain their sport throughout the
present season, and claim that unless the
surplus is used for crew there will be
no boat put up against California and
Washington this year. Stanford crews
are said to accommodate as many can
didates for the squad as basketball, and
that the crew training is much better for
the individual participant.
