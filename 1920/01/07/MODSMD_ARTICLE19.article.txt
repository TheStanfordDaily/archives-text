INSULT has been added to injury once more by the Stanford Bookstore. This
time the specific complaint is that the distribution of free ink, a service
rendered by the Bookstore so long that it is almost a Stanford tradition, has
been abolished. Students have been in the habit for years of dropping by the
Bookstore on their way to class and filling their fountain pens and in fact
are still doing so, only to find that along with other services, this has dis
appeared. We can not understand the particular motive behind this move
of the management of the Bookstore unless it is merely for the sake of ad
ditional revenue, and frankly feel that they can well afford to furnish stu
dents with ink. Some consideration should be given by the Bookstore to the
fact that the monopoly situation that they enjoy is worth a good deal and
that they owe us some service in return. We do not know just where to
place the blame for this new policy, whether on the new board of directors,
or on the manager, but we do feel that whoever is responsible should recon
sider and establish the custom of "free ink."
