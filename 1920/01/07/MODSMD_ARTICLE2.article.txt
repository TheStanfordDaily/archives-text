# ATHLETIC BOARD CHANGES PROPOSED
## Student Representation Is Now Unsatisfactory, Says Council 
### 
Because of numerous difficulties which
have arisen under the present system of
student representation on the Board of
Vthletic Control, a committee of three
was appointed by the Executive Council
last evening to draw up an amendment
to the study body constitution to provide
for a new arrangement.
The new amendment will he voted on
at the next special Quad election, to he
held on January 13.
Under the present system, the Board
of athletic control is composed of three
alumni representatives, three faculty
members, and three students. The stu
dents are represented by the student
manager, the study body president, and
the captain of whatever athletic team is
in season. The fact that the student
manager is both an employee and a mem
ber of the board has led to dissatisfac
tion. As the third member of the board
changes often, no one man has an op
portunity to become thoroughly familiar
with the work. The new amendment,
it is hoped, wil provide for a different
arrangement which will prove more sat
isfactory.
