# A 						RESIGNATION
## 
### 
IT it with regret that we announce today the resignation from the staff of
Miss Ruth Searcy, '20, Associate Editor. Miss Searcy has been a member
of the staff since the spring of 1917, and her services have been very valuable
to the Daily especially during the war period when it was difficult to keep up
publication with a limited staff and a great deal of credit is due her for her
efforts.
