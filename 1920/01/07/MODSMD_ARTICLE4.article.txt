# D.P.A. Will Hold Treaty Referendum
## Faculty and Students Will Vote on Issues Tuesday 
### 
In order to obtain an accurate and
comparative expression of the intercol
legiate point of view towards the Peace
Treaty, a committee of the editors of
four leading Eastern college publications
was formed to take charge of an Inter
collegiate Treaty Referendum. This
committe in charge selected the Daily
Palo Alto recently to he the medium
through which a local straw vote on this
most important issue of the time would
be taken. Stanford sentiment on the
treaty will thus be determined by a ref
erendum under the auspices of the Daily
Palo Alto next Tuesday.
Six uniform propositions furnished by
the Intercollegiate Treaty Referendum
committee will be voted on next Tuesday
at all the leading colleges of the United
States and the results will be a con
crete expression of nation-wide college
sentiment. Two separate votes will be
made, one by the faculty, and another
by the students and the two results will
be tallied and wired to the Intercollegi
ate Treaty Referendum headquarters in
New York. Totals from all the colleges
of the country will be wired back from
New York in time for the Thursday
issue.
Suggestions in the word of the prop
ositions so as to make them absolutely
fair and impartial to both sides were
made by Senator Lodge, leader of the
Senate opposition to the League of Na
tions, and Senator Hitchcock, the Sen
ate administration leader. For the in
formation of the local community, the
League to Enforce Peace has sent copies
of the peace treaty and the League of
Nations covenant to the Daily Palo Alto
office, where they will be available to
the public.
If the straw vote at Stanford is to
be at all representative of the whole
opinion of the faculty and student body
it will be nccessary that thought and
discussion on the issue be stimulated.
The six propositions, as well as the opin
ions of President Wilbur, Chancellor
Jordan, and sever*! faculty members
were printed yesterday in the Daily Palo
Alto.
