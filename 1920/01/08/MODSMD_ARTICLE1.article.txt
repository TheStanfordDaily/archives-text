# BASKETBALL SEASON OPENS SATURDAY NIGHT
## TWO GAMES SCHEDULED Varsity Plays St. Ignatius â€”Freshmen to Meet Lowell 
### 
Varsity and freshman basketball
teams will play their first game of
the season Saturday night, in the Eti
cina gymnasium, at 7:30 o'clock. The
Varsity squad will meet the St. Ignatius
quintet, while the freshment will match
their skill against that of the Lowell
High School.
Both Stanford teams will work under
considerable handicap due to the short
time the teams have been out for prac
tice, while their opponents are said to
have been in training for over a month.
Although there is a large number of
candidates for the two squads, Coach
Evans and Acker will welcome any fur
ther material for the teams.
Last year the St. Ignatius five de
feated the Cardinal Varsity on the Mis
sionites' own court, but it is hoped that
this year's team will come back with a
win on our court. Basketball is one
of St. Ignatius' strongest sports and
will probably be able to stand her own
against the Stanford quintet.
For forwards in the Varsity game the
coach will probably start either Mills,
Richmond, or Hood. At center, Righter
or Carver will play; while the guards
will be selected from Pelouze, Butt,
Austin, or Adams. During the game
Evans hopes to be able to use all of
his material in order that lie may get
a definite line on his men.
Coach Acker announced this morning
that he would select five of the follow
ing men to start the game against Low
ell : Guards, Pollard, Tritle, William
son, Carpenter. Papazian, and Sproull;
Center, Howell or DeGroot; Forwards,
Barkhard. Dake, Rogers, and Schindler.
