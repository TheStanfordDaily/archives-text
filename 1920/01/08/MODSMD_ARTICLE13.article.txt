# Intra-Mural Series of Basketball Games Will Commence Next Week
## 
### 
Intra-mural basketball will start next
week, according to the announcement
given out by Dr. Browne today. Each
house or living group that expects to
enter a team must turn in the name of
their captain and eligible players at the
gymasium office by tomorrow afternoon.
The purpose of the intra-mural con
tests is to raise enthusiasm for sports,
and in order to make the teams more
even, letter men are not allowed to play
in their special sport. The games will
be played round-robin, and the definite
schedule will be announced next Mon
day.
