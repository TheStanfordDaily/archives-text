# ATHLETIC SURPLUS IS CAUSE OF MUCH DISCUSSION
## BOTH SPORTS WANT FUND Referendum Vote of Students Will Determine Question 
### 
OTUDENT discussion is being voiced
by the advocates of both sports
over the disposal of the three or four
thousand dollars surplus. The Roard
of Athletic Control has submitted the
mptter to a vote of the students, to
decide whether the money shall be
devoted to the expenses of producing
a 1920 crew, or the building of a new
basketball pavilion.
It has not been definitely decided
whether or not. crew will be forced
to become abandoned at Stanford, if
the money is turned over for the build
ing of a basketball pavilion. Crew
supporters claim, however, that there
will be no possibility of a Cardinal
boat on the water this year unless the
money is used for that sport.
Crew advocates claim it is the older
of the two sports at Stanford and was
the main factor in putting the Cardi
nal on the athletic map. Basketball
was only recently changed from a
minor to a major sport, and basket
ball enthusiasts want the money in
order that basketeball can get on an
equal footing with other sports.
The present gymnasium floor is laid
on a solid cement base and is a handi
cap in the producing of the best pos
sible basketball team.
The following are some of the opini
ons of campus men:
Wm. C. Fundenberg, '19
"The question at stake is not
one of relative importance be
tween basketball and crew, but
whether Stanford shall he a quit
ter under fire. Last year when it
looked as though California
would abandon crew, strong pres
sure was brought from Stanford
to have California continue the
sport.
"Stanford was defeated by Cali
fornia for the first time in a num
ber of years, and now some of
the Stanford students want to
abandon crew. California is al
ready talking of sending a shell
back to Poughkeepsie this year,
so let's not let the Stanford Spirit
die by letting California steal
a march."
W. K. Hood, '20
"For the first time iif several years
Stanford has a surplus in its athletic
funds to be spent in one of two pro
posed ways; first, to support crew
and to buy new equipment for it;
second, to buy a new basketball pa
vilion.
"The need for a new basketball
floor is certainly appreciated by
those who play the game. The
present floor is built on a solid ce
ment foundation, and it is impossi
ble to keep tiie teams in good condi
dition throughout the season. The
older men here realize the many
times that valuable men have been
unable to play : n the important
games because of their sore feet or
stiff legs, due to.the gym floor. In
fact, nearly every man that is out
for the first teams must be out of
the game for a few weeks, sometime
during the season in order to re
cover from the effects of playing on
our present floor.
"In order to have a winning team
we must have a t<nm that can stay
in prime condition. This is impos
sible under the existing conditions,
but could be accomplished with the
new pavilion and new floor. It
would be, I believe, a permanent
improvement that would be a great
aid to putting out winning Stanford
basketball teams.
"I would not want to sec crew
given up, but I believe that by sup
porting basketball now, we will soon
be able to carry on crew with great
success."
Paul Campbell, '20
"The question of whether we
should better the basketball situa
tion at Stanford, thereby sacrificing
crew is of vital importance at this
time.
"It is conceded that conditions for
basketball are not what they should
be, and that the surplus could be
spent in improving them. Hut we
must stop and consider what it will
mean if the money is so used.
"Stanford has always maintained
a crew of the highest standards.
One need to refer to previous rec
ords to learn this. Also do not for
get that Stanford crews have done
much to gain recognition for Stan,
ford not only among western col
leges, hut also among those of the
East.
"The question of whether we are
going to support a crew or not has
reached its climax. Basketball will
continue even if the surplus is used
for crew,, and it will be a question
of only a short time until we could
satisfy the needs of basketball. Now
is the time to support the college
and vote for crew."

"The question at stake is not
one of relative importance be
tween basketball and crew, but
whether Stanford shall he a quit
ter under fire. Last year when it
looked as though California
would abandon crew, strong pres
sure was brought from Stanford
to have California continue the
sport.
"Stanford was defeated by Cali
fornia for the first time in a num
ber of years, and now some of
the Stanford students want to
abandon crew. California is al
ready talking of sending a shell
back to Poughkeepsie this year,
so let's not let the Stanford Spirit
die by letting California steal

"For the first time iif several years
Stanford has a surplus in its athletic
funds to be spent in one of two pro
posed ways; first, to support crew
and to buy new equipment for it;
second, to buy a new basketball pa
vilion.
"The need for a new basketball
floor is certainly appreciated by
those who play the game. The
present floor is built on a solid ce
ment foundation, and it is impossi
ble to keep tiie teams in good condi
dition throughout the season. The
older men here realize the many
times that valuable men have been
unable to play : n the important
games because of their sore feet or
stiff legs, due to.the gym floor. In
fact, nearly every man that is out
for the first teams must be out of
the game for a few weeks, sometime
during the season in order to re
cover from the effects of playing on
our present floor.
"In order to have a winning team
we must have a t<nm that can stay
in prime condition. This is impos
sible under the existing conditions,
but could be accomplished with the
new pavilion and new floor. It
would be, I believe, a permanent
improvement that would be a great
aid to putting out winning Stanford
basketball teams.
"I would not want to sec crew
given up, but I believe that by sup
porting basketball now, we will soon
be able to carry on crew with great
success."
Paul Campbell, '20
"The question of whether we
should better the basketball situa
tion at Stanford, thereby sacrificing
crew is of vital importance at this
time.
"It is conceded that conditions for
basketball are not what they should
be, and that the surplus could be
spent in improving them. Hut we
must stop and consider what it will
mean if the money is so used.
"Stanford has always maintained
a crew of the highest standards.
One need to refer to previous rec
ords to learn this. Also do not for
get that Stanford crews have done
much to gain recognition for Stan,
ford not only among western col
leges, hut also among those of the
East.
"The question of whether we are
going to support a crew or not has
reached its climax. Basketball will
continue even if the surplus is used
for crew,, and it will be a question
of only a short time until we could
satisfy the needs of basketball. Now
is the time to support the college
and vote for crew."
OTUDENT discussion is being voiced
by the advocates of both sports
over the disposal of the three or four
thousand dollars surplus. The Roard
of Athletic Control has submitted the
mptter to a vote of the students, to
decide whether the money shall be
devoted to the expenses of producing
a 1920 crew, or the building of a new
basketball pavilion.
It has not been definitely decided
whether or not. crew will be forced
to become abandoned at Stanford, if
the money is turned over for the build
ing of a basketball pavilion. Crew
supporters claim, however, that there
will be no possibility of a Cardinal
boat on the water this year unless the
money is used for that sport.
Crew advocates claim it is the older
of the two sports at Stanford and was
the main factor in putting the Cardi
nal on the athletic map. Basketball
was only recently changed from a
minor to a major sport, and basket
ball enthusiasts want the money in
order that basketeball can get on an
equal footing with other sports.
The present gymnasium floor is laid
on a solid cement base and is a handi
cap in the producing of the best pos
sible basketball team.

ons of campus men:
