# WOMEN ARE URGED TO SIGN FOR BASKETBALL
## Stanford Will Meet Mills and U.C. in Inter-class Contests 
### 
With games scheduled with both
Mills and California, the basketball sea
son for women is starting off in a fair
manner. However, not nearly enough
tryoutces have signed up to play on the
interclass teams, and unless more do
sign up quickly, the games with the
other universities may have to be can
celled. The number entered from the
freshman and senior classes especially,
is too small to even admit of a second
team for practice work.
Any one wishing to come out for the
sport may do so by signing up with Miss
Bunting, Associate Director, at Roble
Gymnasium. Practice starts today at
4 o'clock.
