II7HAT is the United States going to do about the Peace Treaty and the
League of Nations? That is one of the big questions that naturally
should be in the mind of all Americans today. How much do you know about
the League of Nations as proposed by the Conference at Versailles on April
28, 1919? Are you in favor of its adoption without any amendments or
reservations, are you unalterably opposed to the League in any form, or are
you in favor of it with reservations or amendments. Stanford men and
women are going to be given an opportunity to answer these questions printed
in our news columns tonight. At the same time at a majority of the other
American Universities, college men and women, both faculty and students,
will be making the same expression of opinion. Stanford must make a show
ing that will compare favorably with any of the Eastern colleges. This
movement, started by the Yale News, and which now has the backing of all
the leading college publications of the country, should give a very good idea
of what the sentimen of the United States is on this question. Arthur T.
Hadley, President of Yale University, "I heartily approve the action
of the Yale News in getting an expression of our students' sentiments on
the League of Nations controversy. If a similar vote could be had in all
of the colleges of the country, I believe we should get a useful intimation
of what our country thought, which would do great good " Senator Henry
C. Lodge, Republican leader in the Senate, and Senator Gilbert M. Hitchcock,
Democratic leader, have both expressed themselves as being very much in
favor of the taking of this straw vote in the universities of the country.
For the purpose of getting as large a vote as possible on this subject, the
Daily Palo Alto hopes to be able to conduct the vote through the class rooms,
so that practically every one will be called upon to cast his or her vote. In
order that this should be an intelligent expression of opinion, we feel that
every student should make it a point to consider the six propositions to be
voted upon.
