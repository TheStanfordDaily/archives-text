# TWO GAMES WILL OPEN BASKETBALL SEASON TOMORROW
## VARSITY AND FRESHMEN IN CONTESTS Teams Enter First Battles After One Week of Practice 
### 
A DOUBLE-HEADER will be played
on the Encina gymnasium basket
ball court at 7:00 o'clock tomorrow
night, when the varsity and freshman
quintets will play their first games of
the season. The frosli-Lowell high
school will be a preliminary game to
the varsity-St. Ignatius contst.
St. Ignatius has the edge on San
ford with about a month's longer train
ing, but Coach Evans said Lis squad
will be in good condition, even though
his men have only been out for prac
tice during the past week. Last year
the Cardinal team met defeat from
the bay city five.
Evans will probably use a large num
ber of Lis possibilities in order that
he may get a definite line on the men
early in the season. Some of the can
didates that may play tomorrow night
are: Forwards, Richmond, Hood, Mills,
Esgen and Davies; center, Righter and
Carver; guards, Capt. Pelouze, Austin,
Adams, Butts and Larsen.
The freshman squad lost several
good players, who didn't return to col
lege this quarter, but Coach Acker has
worked up a good team to meet the
Lowell boys.
