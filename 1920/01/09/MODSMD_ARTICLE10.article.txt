# MALONEY BEGINS STANFORD OLYMPIC RUGBY CAMPAIGN
## 
### 
Trainer Harry Maloney has fired the
first gun in the campaign which he
hopes will culminate with the choice
of a Stanford-California combination to
represent America in the 1920 Olympic
games. Encouraged by the fine record
made by the California All-stars in their
invasion of the north during the holi
days, Maloney sent the following tele
gram to Secretary Rubier of the Ama
teur Athletic Union at its headquarters
in New York:
"Combined Stanford and California
Universities rugby teams toured British
Columbia Christmas vacation. Defeated
two all-star athletic teams 3 to 0 and
University of British Columbia 8 to 0.
Defeated all-star team Victoria 10 to 4.
"Strongly urge American representa
tion in rugby at Olympic games. Sev
eral world famous men available as
players and coaches. American team in
final game during Inter-Allied games,
only beaten 8 to 3 by all-star French
team.
"(Signed) H. Wilfred Maloney."
The A. A. U., by choosing Stanford
and California to represent the United
States would automatically concede the
national championship in rugby to the
central California colleges. Stanford
would be accredited with a world cham
pionship in cas eof victory at the games,
and the University would establish an
enduring record in the sport. Practical
ly the same men who played in the north
would gain places on the Olympic squad,
which would be coached by Jim Wylie
and Harry Maloney.
