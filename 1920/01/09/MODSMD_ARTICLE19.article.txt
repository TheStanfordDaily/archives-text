# CAST YOUR BALLOT
## 
### 
STANFORD UNDERGRADUATES will have the opportunity on Tuesday of
determining whether an athletic surplus shall be voted to basketball or
to crew. Supporters of both sides are daily advancing the respective claims
of the two sports, and in all frankness it may be said that there is a great
deal of argument on both sides. However, the idea of allowing students to
express their opinion as to how their money should be spent, an idea which
is ideal in theory, will fail entirely if only a meager handful of Stanford stu
dents vote. To actually get a representative opinion from the Associated
Students, every man s,nd woman in the University must make it a point
to cast a ballot. To bring this about, we would suggest that pressure be
brought to bear by the heads of the various living groups on the campus,
to see that all their members do their duty by voting. In this election it is
desirable, as it is in all elections, that an intelligent vote be cast. Voters
should thoroughly understand what it means to vote for crew or on the other
hand what it means to vote for basketball. Opinions of men and women
well-known on the campus are being printed each night in the Daily, pre
senting the arguments of both sides. Study these and then formulate your
own opinion. Above all, be sure to cast your ballot at the election next
Tuesday, on the Quad.
