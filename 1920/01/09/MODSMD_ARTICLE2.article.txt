# ANDREW J. FIELD, '12 MAKES GIFT OF $100
## San Francisco Business Man Donates Sum of Money to University 
### 
As an outcome of the Stanford Alumni
dinner to Herbert Hoover in San Fran
cisco last month, Andrew J. Field, a
graduate of the University with the
class of 1912, and now a San Fran
cisco business man, has turned over $100
to be expended for the University in any
way that President Wilbur sees fit.
Field writes that he approves of the
"Twenty-fifth Class Birthday Gift" plan
that was proposed by Hoover at the
dinner, but he sees no reason why those
who are able should not return some
thing to the University before they have
been away for a quarter of a century.
At the conclusion of Hoover's and
President Wilbur's talks at the dinner,
in which they pointed out Stanford's
need for more money. Field handed
Hoover his check for $50, which Hoov
er turned over to President Wilbur. Dr.
Wilbur, in thanking Field for the gift,
asked him if he had any preference as
to the way in which it should be ex
pended. In reply Field wrote as fol
lows :
"Your letter of the 6th is just received
and is much appreciated. I hope Mr.
Hoover and those whose talks preceded
his at the dinner succeeded in convinc
ing many others besides myself that they
owe their Alma Mater such substantial
support as they may each le able to
give, financially or otherwise. While
the 'Twenty-fifth Birthday' idea is a
very good one, I don't see any reason
why those who achieve some measure of
success in less time than that should
wait until then—especially when they
attribute that success very largely to
the training they received at Stanford.
"Since closing my books for 1919 I
find myself able, and very glad, to add
another $50, enclosed herewith.
"Answering your queries: Having ma
jored in electrical engineering, I have a
high regard for the benefits of an engi
neering course, whether they are later]
applied professionally or to commercial
pursuits. Therefore if there is some
particular need for this small amount in
the Electrical Engineering Department
or some other engineering department, I
would somewhat prefer its use there.
Otherwise I leave its disposition to your
good judgment.
"I am not desiring or seeking publici
ty in the matter, but have no objections
to my name being used if there should
appear to you to be any good reason
therefor. If some such expression as 'An
Alumnus' would do just as well it would
suit me better."
