# FIRST OF SYMPHONIES IS HEARD YESTERDAY
## 
### 
The first of a series of six sym
phonies by M. Charles Marie Widor,
which Warren D. Allen will play the
first Sunday in each month, was
heard fey an appreciative audience at
the Memorial Church yesterday. This
was the first regular recital since the
holidays. M. Widor's work includes
ten "Symphonies," the first six of
which will be given in chronological
order. Mr. Allen was a pupil of M.
Vidor in Paris, and is thus enabled to
give an unusually fine interpretation
of the master's works.
The first number played, the Pre
lude, opened with a short movement
of quiet beauty, and developed into a
stately rythm of massive chords. In
contrast was the Adagio, a hunting
melody, rising and falling, and ending
on a sustained chord.
The third number, the Intermezzo,
was one of the most difficult of the
five movements. It is a cheerful com
position, with a somewhat pompous
melody and running accompaniment.
Perhaps the most beautiful number
was the Meditation. Its perfect beauty
of tone and chords, with the flute
melody gave it an exquisite appeal.
The final number was the Marche

Pontificale, a stirring and impressive
composition, with the grace and ma
jesty of a great Cathedral.
