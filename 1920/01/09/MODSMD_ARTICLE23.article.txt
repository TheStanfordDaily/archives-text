# SIX PROPOSITIONS FOR TREATY VOTE
## 
### 
Students and faculty will vote on
one of the following propositions in
the Intercollegiate Treaty Referen
dum which will be held by the Daily
Palo Alto next Tuesday. The six
propositions will read as follows:
1. I favor the ratification of the
League and Treaty, without any
amendments or reservations.
2. I am opposed to the ratification
of the League and Treaty in any
form.
3. I am in favor of the ratification
of the Treaty and League, but only
with the specific reservations as voted
by the majority of the Senate.
4. I favor any compromise on the
reservation that will make possible
immediate ratification of the Treaty
and League.
5. I favor the Government pro
ceeding to make peace with Germany
at once and leaving the question of
a League of Nations to be settled
afterwards.
6. I favor a compromise of such a
character as will avoid the danger of
defeating ratification while making
clear that America can only be in- !
volved in war by a declaration of
Congress, that domestic questions and
the Monroe Doctrine are entirely out
side of the jurisdiction of the
League; that plural votes of any
members arc all to be disqualified in
the event of a dispute wherein we
are disqualified from voting, and that
on deciding to withdraw, we are to
be the judge of whether our obliga
tions have been met.
