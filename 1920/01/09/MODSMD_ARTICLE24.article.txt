# INTRA-MURAL BASKET BALL NEXT WEEK
## 
### 
Initial game In the Intra-Mural
Basketball League will be played the
first of next week between 4 and 6
p.m. on the floor of the Encina Gym.
Forty-six living groups have been
selected as the basis of competition,
each group being entitld to a squad of
eight. The great number of teams
has made it necessary to divide the
squads into four or five competing
leagues.
Definite determination of the dates
of the schedule is being delayed by
the failure of certain groups to or
ganize for league membership. The
Physical Director urges that any
groups who have not done so, at once
elect a captain to represent the group
in the league.
Team members will be allowed
credit for all intra-mural games played,
as only two practices a week by squad
members will ba required.
