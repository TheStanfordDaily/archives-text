# EIGHT THOUSAND ARE PRESENT AT MEETING
## 
### 
Eight thousand students, from a thou
sand different colleges and universities
in Canada and the United States, rep
resenting thirty-nine nationalities, were
present at the Coliseum in Des Moines,
Iowa, when Dr. John R. Mott let the
gavel fall at 2 :30 Wednesday, December
31.
In the words of Dr. Mott: "We were
assembled to receive a new challenge—
a fresh commission—and this of tre
mendous significance since the disturb
ances of the Great War have opened
the whole world to evangelization."
Although the Coliseum seats eight
thousand it was not possible to accom
modate all who were interested in the
convention. On that account "overflow"
meetings were held at several of the
larger churches.
Over two hundred missionaries and
others addressed the different sessions.
A few of the most prominent speakers
were Dr. John R. Mott, Chairman Ex
ecutive Committee; Dr. Karl Fries,
Scandinavia; Sherwood Eddy, Rev. S.
M. Zwemer, R. P. Wilder, founder of
the Student Volunteer Movement, and
Robert E. Sneer.
Stanford, the University of California,
and other delegations from the Pacific
Coast went to Des Moines on a special
train, and it is hoped that acquaintances
made between the students from the
Western universities will lead to a closer
friendship and more beneficial relation
ships between our colleges and universi
ties. Furthermore the fact that so many
students from so various places met
and exchanged opinions at Des Moines
will bind closer together not Only the
educational institutions of the West, but
the universities of North America. Eu
rope, and the whole world. And we
dare look forward to greater accom
plishments by this generation, especially
that students of world interests and
sympathies will multiply as one of the
results of the Des Moines Convention.
Miss Rollins, a former Stanford stu
dent, entertained the Stanford delega
tion and the delegation from the Boston
School of Technology at her home at
dinner on Sunday evening.
Every delegate is enthusiastic over the
general success of the convention, and
over the clearer understanding re
ceived of the way mission work is laying
foundations for future democratic civili
zations among the backward races of the
world. Arrangements are being made
for reports from the delegates to the
students at an early date.
