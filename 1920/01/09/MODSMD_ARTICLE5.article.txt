Eight thousand students, from a thou
sand different colleges and universities
in Canada and the United States, rep
resenting thirty-nine nationalities, were
present at the Coliseum in Des Moines,
Iowa, when Dr. John R. Mott let the
gavel fall at 2 :30 Wednesday, December
31.
In the words of Dr. Mott: "We were
assembled to receive a new challenge—
a fresh commission—and this of tre
mendous significance since the disturb
ances of the Great War have opened
the whole world to evangelization."
Although the Coliseum seats eight
thousand it was not possible to accom
modate all who were interested in the
convention. On that account "overflow"
meetings were held at several of the
larger churches.
Over two hundred missionaries and
others addressed the different sessions.
A few of the most prominent speakers
were Dr. John R. Mott, Chairman Ex
ecutive Committee; Dr. Karl Fries,
Scandinavia; Sherwood Eddy, Rev. S.
M. Zwemer, R. P. Wilder, founder of
the Student Volunteer Movement, and
Robert E. Sneer.
