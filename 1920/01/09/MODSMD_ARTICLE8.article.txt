# STANFORD CHILDREN'S HOME HAS $12,000 ENDOWMENT
## REPORT OF COMMITTEE SHOWS WORK Eleven Children Are At Convalescent Home on Campus 
### 
fTHE Stanford Home for Convalescent
Children in the old Acacia fratern
ity house on the campus now has a
permanent endowment of nearly $12,-
500. Mr. Timothy Hopkins, chairman
of the endowment committee, in a re
port just received by Chaplain Charles
D. Gardner, president of the board of
directors, shows that so far her com
mittee has raised $12,470.46, which has
been invested and is yielding an in
come which helps to support the home.
Ultimately, according to the plan,
the endowment will be large enough
to maintain the home, but in the mean
time most of the running expenses
must be met by contributions from
those who know of the work which the
convalescent home is doing in restor
ing poor children to health and to
strength. Last year $3,000 was con
tributed.
The Convalescent Home is an out
growth of the Auxiliary to the Stan
ford Clinics, established by Stanford
people to aid the dipcharged patients
of the free clinics of the Stanford
Hospital, many of whom were unable
| to afford what was needed to regain
\ their health. In 1917 a number of
| children were brought down to the
University isolation hospital for the
summer months. The next summer a
"roup was sent to St. Dorothy's Rest
at Camp Meeker, Sonoma county.
In April, 1919, the home was made
a permanent, year-round institution,
j It will accommodate ten children at
j one tiim, and is always full. The In
' mates are drawn mainly from the
' patients of the children's clinics, al-
I though others may be recommended
by the social service committee of the
University Hospital, and neighborhood
children are admitted at the discretion
of the board of directors. The home
is thus of direct benefit to the com
munity, as well as being a charity
that appeals on account of its work
for sick children of poor parents in
San Francisco.
Of the part of the endowment fund
already collected Mrs. Hopkins her
self has contributed $5,000 and Mrs.
Herbert Hoover $5,000, while residents
of San Francisco, Palo Alto and the
peninsula tov/ns have given sums of
various amounts. Mrs. Harriet R.
Hahn of Menlo Park has pledged a
yearly contribution of $100. The en
dowment fund is invested by the board
of trustees of the University on behalf
of the Convalescent Home.
The endowment committee is com
posed of Mrs. Timothy Hopkins, chair
man; Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, Mrs.
Charles G. Lathrop, Mrs. Herbert
Hoover, and Mrs. Selah Chamberlain.
The board of directors is composed
for the most part of Stanford and Palo
Alto men and women. Chaplain C. D.
Gardner is the president, and Profes
sor W. F. Durand, vice-president, while
Miss Elizabeth Thompson of Palo Alto,
a Stanford graduate, is secretary-trea
surer. The other members are Mrs.
Clay Miller of Palo Alto, Mrs. Pay
son J. Treat of Stanford, Miss Lois

come which helps to support the home.
Ultimately, according to the plan,
the endowment will be large enough
to maintain the home, but in the mean
time most of the running expenses
must be met by contributions from
those who know of the work which the
convalescent home is doing in restor
ing poor children to health and to
strength. Last year $3,000 was con
tributed.
The Convalescent Home is an out
growth of the Auxiliary to the Stan
ford Clinics, established by Stanford
people to aid the dipcharged patients
of the free clinics of the Stanford
Hospital, many of whom were unable
| to afford what was needed to regain
\ their health. In 1917 a number of
| children were brought down to the
University isolation hospital for the
summer months. The next summer a
"roup was sent to St. Dorothy's Rest
at Camp Meeker, Sonoma county.
In April, 1919, the home was made
a permanent, year-round institution,
j It will accommodate ten children at
j one tiim, and is always full. The In
' mates are drawn mainly from the
' patients of the children's clinics, al-
I though others may be recommended
by the social service committee of the
University Hospital, and neighborhood
children are admitted at the discretion
of the board of directors. The home
is thus of direct benefit to the com
munity, as well as being a charity
that appeals on account of its work
for sick children of poor parents in
San Francisco.
Of the part of the endowment fund
already collected Mrs. Hopkins her
self has contributed $5,000 and Mrs.
Herbert Hoover $5,000, while residents
of San Francisco, Palo Alto and the
peninsula tov/ns have given sums of
various amounts. Mrs. Harriet R.
Hahn of Menlo Park has pledged a
yearly contribution of $100. The en
dowment fund is invested by the board
of trustees of the University on behalf
of the Convalescent Home.
The endowment committee is com
posed of Mrs. Timothy Hopkins, chair
man; Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, Mrs.
Charles G. Lathrop, Mrs. Herbert
Hoover, and Mrs. Selah Chamberlain.
The board of directors is composed
for the most part of Stanford and Palo
Alto men and women. Chaplain C. D.
Gardner is the president, and Profes
sor W. F. Durand, vice-president, while
Miss Elizabeth Thompson of Palo Alto,
a Stanford graduate, is secretary-trea
surer. The other members are Mrs.
Clay Miller of Palo Alto, Mrs. Pay
son J. Treat of Stanford, Miss Lois
Park, '20, of Stanford, and Timothy
Hopkins.
