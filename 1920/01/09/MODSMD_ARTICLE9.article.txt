# Athletic Surplus is Object of Argument
## Campus Opinion Expressed by Bonney for Basketball and Heron for Crew 
### 
Advocates of crew and basketball
are working hard to have the athletic
surplus turned over to their sport.
Basketball wants to build a new pa
vilion, and crew is trying to get the
money to meet the expenses of the
1920 boat.
The Board of Atliltic Control has
submitted the matter to a referendum
vote of the men and women in the
University, who will decide the ques
tion at a special quad election next
Tuesday.
Opinions of some of the campus men
follows:
C. E. Rlghter, '19
There are many sides to be con
sidered in the question as to
whether the money available in the
student body treasury should he
used to put the crew on its feet or
build a pavilion with a iloor which
could he used for basketball or gym
classes. Let us look at the crew
side of the argument. Many stu
dents are in favor of keeping crew
'for sentimental reasons. Any
sport which exists in a school for
any length of time has its traditions
which are hard to do away with.
But look at the practical side of the
crew situation. At present the
crew needs a new float, new rowing
machines, a coaching launch, and—
most important of all—a competent
coach. The crew that made a name
for itself at Poughkecpsie was com
posed of men of exceptional phy-.
siquc, trained by an excellent coach.
Husky Gucrena is no longer avail
able as a coach, which means that
the chances of a winning crcw arc
negligible.. Crcw men have admit
ted that the $4,(XX) estimate surplus
will not adequately support a crcw,
and even if all the surplus is voted
to crew they will have to do with-
out many things which arc essen
tial to a winning crew. But what
will the money do if it is used to
build a pavilion next to the pres
ent gymnasium. Due to the require
ment that all students shall haxe
six quarters of physical or military
training, greater demands than ever
before are being made for floor
space at the gymnasium. A new
building can be used for gymnasium
classes as well as basketball, there
by enabling all students to have the
chance to develop which they have
every reason to expect. At present
the main floor is used from four to
six by gymnasium classes and inter
mural basketball, leaving the varsity
and freshmen teams to practice at
night. The floor is unsuited for
basketball, making it nearly impossible
to turn out a whining team regardless
of the material. This year and the
years following we will have games
with the leading teams of the Pa
cific Coast, two teams from Wash
ington, two from Oregon, as well
as California and the Bay colleges.
Here we get competition with a
large number of schools, games
which can be enjoyed by everyone
instead of a crew race at Seattle
reported to us by the morning pa
pers. Anyone who attends the St.
Ignatius game to-morrow night will
see that it is impossible to accommo
date a crowd in our present gym,
and interstate games must be played
at a heavy loss to the student body.
Shall we, then, spend this $4,000 ,
surplus, plus $1,000, which is esti
mated by the Board of Athletic Con
trol as necessary to adequately fi
nance the crcw or shall wc spend
this money on a building so equipped
that wc can handle a large crowd at
our basketball games and put this
rising sport on a paying basis. Re
member also, students who arc using
the gymnasium, that by voting for
the new building you are giving
yourselves a better chance for ath
letic development instead of giving
a few men a chance to participate
in a sport which makes but one pub
lic appearance a year, and then can
omv be seen by a comparatively few
students. Stanford is not a crew
college. Her distance from the wa
ter makes it inevitable that crew be
be dropped' from her sport calendar
at some date, so why not now instead
of sinking any more money into the
sport. Let Stanford, then, concen
trate upon the sports for which she
is best suited.
Ivan C. Heron, '18
From the first, defeat of Cali
fornia, Stanford has had great,
pride in the reputation and ability
of her crews and since the won
derful showing at Poughkeepsie,
when Stanford was adjudged the
most powerful crew on the river,
our i ride was fully justified for in
the east Stanford's reputation was
spread broadcast —the reputation
of a college that produced men
and teams.
Keep crew, for ifonce dropped
It will never be reorganized. Don't
quit a sport after a defeat or two,
or bcause of adversity. Stanford
has the men and ability to dupli
cate the teams of former years
and pile up many more great vic
tories of Cordinal crews.
Fred S. Bonney, '19
If Stanford is to have a success
ful basketball team either this
year or in the future, there must
be a new pavilion erected, or the
floor in the old gym raised from
its present foundation. In the
past it has not been a question of
material for good teams that has
prevented championship teams,
but rather than continued prac
tice upon the present gym floor
has caused many unnecessary in
juries, and, when victory seemed
certain, defeat has been the result.
With the material Coach Evans
has this year and the confidence
the men on the squad have in his
ability, there is an opportunity to
defeat California and, finally to
win the coast championship. To
deprive basketball of unlimited
support this year seems to me
to be depriving Stanford of a
golden opportunity for success.
In addition I do not think that
of necessity crew will te discon
tinued and personally I would not
wish to be understood as support
ing a movement to abolish a sport
In which Stanford has been so
successful in the past and the
record of which all Stanford men
are i.roud. But with tho erection
of a new pavilion, baskettall will
be more than a self-supporting
activity this semester and, then,
with the proceeds, additional
material may be furnished crew,
besides that already on hand from
last year, during the spring se
mester when crew naturally has
its place.

student body treasury should he
used to put the crew on its feet or
build a pavilion with a iloor which
could he used for basketball or gym
classes. Let us look at the crew
side of the argument. Many stu
dents are in favor of keeping crew
'for sentimental reasons. Any
sport which exists in a school for
any length of time has its traditions
which are hard to do away with.
But look at the practical side of the
crew situation. At present the
crew needs a new float, new rowing
machines, a coaching launch, and—
most important of all—a competent
coach. The crew that made a name
for itself at Poughkecpsie was com
posed of men of exceptional phy-.
siquc, trained by an excellent coach.
Husky Gucrena is no longer avail
able as a coach, which means that
the chances of a winning crcw arc
negligible.. Crcw men have admit
ted that the $4,(XX) estimate surplus
will not adequately support a crcw,
and even if all the surplus is voted
to crew they will have to do with-
out many things which arc essen
tial to a winning crew. But what
will the money do if it is used to
build a pavilion next to the pres
ent gymnasium. Due to the require
ment that all students shall haxe
six quarters of physical or military
training, greater demands than ever
before are being made for floor
space at the gymnasium. A new
building can be used for gymnasium
classes as well as basketball, there
by enabling all students to have the
chance to develop which they have
every reason to expect. At present
the main floor is used from four to
six by gymnasium classes and inter
mural basketball, leaving the varsity
and freshmen teams to practice at
night. The floor is unsuited for
basketball, making it nearly impossible
to turn out a whining team regardless
of the material. This year and the
years following we will have games
with the leading teams of the Pa
cific Coast, two teams from Wash
ington, two from Oregon, as well
as California and the Bay colleges.
Here we get competition with a
large number of schools, games
which can be enjoyed by everyone
instead of a crew race at Seattle
reported to us by the morning pa
pers. Anyone who attends the St.
Ignatius game to-morrow night will
see that it is impossible to accommo
date a crowd in our present gym,
and interstate games must be played
at a heavy loss to the student body.
Shall we, then, spend this $4,000 ,
surplus, plus $1,000, which is esti
mated by the Board of Athletic Con
trol as necessary to adequately fi
nance the crcw or shall wc spend
this money on a building so equipped
that wc can handle a large crowd at
our basketball games and put this
rising sport on a paying basis. Re
member also, students who arc using
the gymnasium, that by voting for
the new building you are giving
yourselves a better chance for ath
letic development instead of giving
a few men a chance to participate
in a sport which makes but one pub
lic appearance a year, and then can
omv be seen by a comparatively few
students. Stanford is not a crew
college. Her distance from the wa
ter makes it inevitable that crew be
be dropped' from her sport calendar
at some date, so why not now instead
of sinking any more money into the
sport. Let Stanford, then, concen
trate upon the sports for which she
is best suited.

From the first, defeat of Cali
fornia, Stanford has had great,
pride in the reputation and ability
of her crews and since the won
derful showing at Poughkeepsie,
when Stanford was adjudged the
most powerful crew on the river,
our i ride was fully justified for in
the east Stanford's reputation was
spread broadcast —the reputation
of a college that produced men
and teams.
Keep crew, for ifonce dropped
It will never be reorganized. Don't
quit a sport after a defeat or two,
or bcause of adversity. Stanford
has the men and ability to dupli
cate the teams of former years
and pile up many more great vic
tories of Cordinal crews.

If Stanford is to have a success
ful basketball team either this
year or in the future, there must
be a new pavilion erected, or the
floor in the old gym raised from
its present foundation. In the
past it has not been a question of
material for good teams that has
prevented championship teams,
but rather than continued prac
tice upon the present gym floor
has caused many unnecessary in
juries, and, when victory seemed
certain, defeat has been the result.
With the material Coach Evans
has this year and the confidence
the men on the squad have in his
ability, there is an opportunity to
defeat California and, finally to
win the coast championship. To
deprive basketball of unlimited
support this year seems to me
to be depriving Stanford of a
golden opportunity for success.
In addition I do not think that
of necessity crew will te discon
tinued and personally I would not
wish to be understood as support
ing a movement to abolish a sport
In which Stanford has been so
successful in the past and the
record of which all Stanford men
are i.roud. But with tho erection
of a new pavilion, baskettall will
be more than a self-supporting
activity this semester and, then,
with the proceeds, additional
material may be furnished crew,
besides that already on hand from
last year, during the spring se
mester when crew naturally has
its place.
Advocates of crew and basketball
are working hard to have the athletic
surplus turned over to their sport.
Basketball wants to build a new pa

money to meet the expenses of the

siquc, trained by an excellent coach.
Husky Gucrena is no longer avail
able as a coach, which means that
the chances of a winning crcw arc
negligible.. Crcw men have admit
ted that the $4,(XX) estimate surplus
will not adequately support a crcw,
and even if all the surplus is voted
to crew they will have to do with-
out many things which arc essen
tial to a winning crew. But what
will the money do if it is used to
build a pavilion next to the pres
ent gymnasium. Due to the require
ment that all students shall haxe
six quarters of physical or military
training, greater demands than ever
before are being made for floor
space at the gymnasium. A new
building can be used for gymnasium
classes as well as basketball, there
by enabling all students to have the
chance to develop which they have
every reason to expect. At present
the main floor is used from four to
six by gymnasium classes and inter
mural basketball, leaving the varsity
and freshmen teams to practice at
night. The floor is unsuited for
basketball, making it nearly impossible
to turn out a whining team regardless
of the material. This year and the
years following we will have games
with the leading teams of the Pa
cific Coast, two teams from Wash
ington, two from Oregon, as well
as California and the Bay colleges.
Here we get competition with a
large number of schools, games
which can be enjoyed by everyone
instead of a crew race at Seattle
reported to us by the morning pa
pers. Anyone who attends the St.
Ignatius game to-morrow night will
see that it is impossible to accommo
date a crowd in our present gym,
and interstate games must be played
at a heavy loss to the student body.
Shall we, then, spend this $4,000 ,
surplus, plus $1,000, which is esti
mated by the Board of Athletic Con
trol as necessary to adequately fi
nance the crcw or shall wc spend
this money on a building so equipped
that wc can handle a large crowd at
our basketball games and put this
rising sport on a paying basis. Re
member also, students who arc using
the gymnasium, that by voting for
the new building you are giving
yourselves a better chance for ath
letic development instead of giving
a few men a chance to participate
in a sport which makes but one pub
lic appearance a year, and then can
omv be seen by a comparatively few
students. Stanford is not a crew
college. Her distance from the wa
ter makes it inevitable that crew be
be dropped' from her sport calendar
at some date, so why not now instead
of sinking any more money into the
sport. Let Stanford, then, concen
trate upon the sports for which she
is best suited.

From the first, defeat of Cali
fornia, Stanford has had great,
pride in the reputation and ability
of her crews and since the won
derful showing at Poughkeepsie,
when Stanford was adjudged the
most powerful crew on the river,
our i ride was fully justified for in
the east Stanford's reputation was
spread broadcast —the reputation
of a college that produced men
and teams.
Keep crew, for ifonce dropped
It will never be reorganized. Don't
quit a sport after a defeat or two,
or bcause of adversity. Stanford
has the men and ability to dupli
cate the teams of former years
and pile up many more great vic
tories of Cordinal crews.
Fred S. Bonney, '19
If Stanford is to have a success
ful basketball team either this
year or in the future, there must
be a new pavilion erected, or the
floor in the old gym raised from
its present foundation. In the
past it has not been a question of
material for good teams that has
prevented championship teams,
but rather than continued prac
tice upon the present gym floor
has caused many unnecessary in
juries, and, when victory seemed
certain, defeat has been the result.
With the material Coach Evans
has this year and the confidence
the men on the squad have in his
ability, there is an opportunity to
defeat California and, finally to
win the coast championship. To
deprive basketball of unlimited
support this year seems to me
to be depriving Stanford of a
golden opportunity for success.
In addition I do not think that
of necessity crew will te discon
tinued and personally I would not
wish to be understood as support
ing a movement to abolish a sport
In which Stanford has been so
successful in the past and the
record of which all Stanford men
are i.roud. But with tho erection
of a new pavilion, baskettall will
be more than a self-supporting
activity this semester and, then,
with the proceeds, additional
material may be furnished crew,
besides that already on hand from
last year, during the spring se
mester when crew naturally has
its place.
Advocates of crew and basketball
are working hard to have the athletic
surplus turned over to their sport.
Basketball wants to build a new pa
vilion, and crew is trying to get the
money to meet the expenses of the
1920 boat.
The Board of Atliltic Control has
submitted the matter to a referendum
vote of the men and women in the
University, who will decide the ques
tion at a special quad election next
Tuesday.
Opinions of some of the campus men
follows:
C. E. Rlghter, '19
There are many sides to be con
sidered in the question as to
whether the money available in the
student body treasury should he
used to put the crew on its feet or
build a pavilion with a iloor which
could he used for basketball or gym
classes. Let us look at the crew
side of the argument. Many stu
dents are in favor of keeping crew
'for sentimental reasons. Any
sport which exists in a school for
any length of time has its traditions
which are hard to do away with.
But look at the practical side of the
crew situation. At present the
crew needs a new float, new rowing
machines, a coaching launch, and—
most important of all—a competent
coach. The crew that made a name
for itself at Poughkecpsie was com
posed of men of exceptional phy-.
siquc, trained by an excellent coach.
Husky Gucrena is no longer avail
able as a coach, which means that
the chances of a winning crcw arc

ted that the $4,(XX) estimate surplus

and even if all the surplus is voted
