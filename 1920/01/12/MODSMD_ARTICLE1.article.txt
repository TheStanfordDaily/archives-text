# VARSITY QUINTET WINS FIRST LEAGUE GAME
## BABES DEFEAT LOWELL Good Showing Made Against St. Ignatius After One Week of Practice 
### 
Stanford scored a double victory
last Saturday night, when the varsity
quintet defeated St. Ignatius, winning
the first game of the season in the
California-Nevada League, and the
freshmen beat the Lowell high school
team. Both games were played on
the Encina gymnasium court, the var
sity winning its game by a score of
45 to 35, and the freshmen winning
by 30> to 18.
Although neither of the Cardinal
teams were in danger of defeat during
the full period of play, the teams were
matched evenly enough to make the
game of interest to the spectators,
who more than filled the seating ca
pacity of the gymnasium.
St. Ignatius was unable to hold its
own on the defense, when the Cardinal
scoring trio, Mills, Hood and Righter,
would get started. Molkenbuhr, cap
tain of the bay city five, nearly proved
himself too fast for Stanford's defense
however, by scoring 14 points during
the game.
The Stanford team work, with Cap
tain Pelouze shifted to guard, showed
up well, considering the fact that
Coach Evans has only had the team
out for practice during the past week.
Even though the Cardinal's playing
was somewhat ragged at times, their
system of play naw nevertheless much
superior to that of their opponents,
who have been in training for the
past month.
Coach Evans was pleased over the
results of the game, but realizes the
hardships before the team this season.
Last year the squad won the first ten
games, but was so crippled up at the
last of the season, that Stanford lost
the series.
The frosh team showed up well
against the Lowell squad, but won the
game more on individual playing than
team work. Burkhard at forward
threw 12 of the freshmen's points.
Coach Acker is getting a fast club
started and should have a winning
team by the end of the season.
