# VARSITY QUINTET WINS FIRST LEAGUE GAME
## BABES DEFEAT LOWELL Good Showing Made Against St. Ignatius After One Week of Practice 
### 
Stanford scored a double victory
last Saturday night, when the varsity
quintet defeated St. Ignatius, winning
the first game of the season in the
California-Nevada League, and the
freshmen beat the Lowell high school
team. Both games were played on
the Encina gymnasium court, the var
sity winning its game by a score of
45 to 35, and the freshmen winning
by 30> to 18.
Although neither of the Cardinal
teams were in danger of defeat during
the full period of play, the teams were
matched evenly enough to make the
game of interest to the spectators,
who more than filled the seating ca
pacity of the gymnasium.
St. Ignatius was unable to hold its
own on the defense, when the Cardinal
scoring trio, Mills, Hood and Righter,
would get started. Molkenbuhr, cap
tain of the bay city five, nearly proved
himself too fast for Stanford's defense
