# Stanford Loses Game To Anzac Rugby Team
## 
### 
Davis Farm Australians reinforced
by several American players, defeated a
weakened Stanford rugby fifteen 6 to 5
at Davis last Saturday. The game was
featured by the fast work of the Austra
lian forwards, which culminated in two
trys during the last half and the point
necessary to win the game.
I Stanford, handicapped by the loss of
i Righter, Card, Lynn, and Wrenn, to
gether with the California forwards who
formed an important part of the combi
nation which was so successful in the
north, was outplayed by the Davis Farm
men in the final stages of the contest.
Three points resulting from a trv scored
by Roulware, after an Anzac fumble in
the first half, and a conversion by Tem
l plcton, constituted the only Stanford
i score.
In the last half the ball was kept con
stantly in Stanford territory, and only
' the strong defensive play of the Cardi
nal backs kept the Australians from
further scores. Roth of their attempts
to convert failed. The game was hard
a'd fast throughout, and the weather
conditions furthered good play.
