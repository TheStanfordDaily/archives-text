# CREW AND BASKETBALL CAPTAINS PRESENT FACTS
## DAVIS SAYS CREW MUST HAVE MONEY OR BE ABOLISHED 
### S.C. Davis, '20 (Varsity Crew Captain 
The present controversy is not one
of crew vs. basketball, but of crew vs.
a new basketball pavilion. Basketball
itself will continue without the added
luxury of a new pavilion, whereas crew
has reached the point where a lack of
repairs and new equipment will abso
lutely not permit of its continuance.
Once the sport is dropped it will be
gone for all time.
The argument that our crews must al
ways train at a disadvantage is certainly
no reason for quitting. The wonderful
record of past Stanford crews would
seem to discourage the idea of our
quitting because of a few inconveniences
which could easily be overcome by the
expenditure of a little money.
It is claimed that crew brings in no
revenue. All the more reason for giv
ing the appropriation to crew: Basket
ball is practically self-supporting. We
do not have amateur sports to make
money out of them primarily. We have
them for the physical and mental bene
fits they give to us, and we should be
willing to pay for these benefits. The
question of profit or loss must not enter
into college athletics.
