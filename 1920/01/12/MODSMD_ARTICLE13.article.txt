# ILLUSTRATED REVIEW ON SALE THURSDAY
## 
### 
An article in the January "Illustrated
Review" which will attract a good
deal of attention and doubtless cause
some reflection, is one by Robert A.
Donaldson. '17. concerning Stanford
"Fratres in Silverware."
"Community silver," Donaldson says,
"is no where so popular as here on the
campus." He shows how many houses,
somewhat in debt, or having failed to
pledge many "bank roll Frosh" this
quarter, have adopted the policy of ap
propriating silverware from San Fran
cisco hostelrics, especially the St. Fran
cis and the Palace, and adds that these
places are getting on the trail of some of
our "noble-minded fraternities."
The "Review" will be on sale Thurs
day morning on Quad.
