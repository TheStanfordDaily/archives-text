# PELOUZE WOULD ABANDON CREW AND ERECT PAVILION

The arguments in support of contin
uing crew at Stanford are largely sen
timental. Because we turned out one
famous crew in fourteen years of row
ing there are those who believe that the
sport should be fostered in spite of all
the practical objections. These persons
are looking at the question solely from
the standpoint of the advertising and
publicity gained through rowing.
Yet those persons who desire to see
crew continued for advertising purposes
overlook the fact that with the three to
six thousand dollars required annually
for crew we could each year send our
best athletic teams on a tour of the en
tire country. One year we could send a
track team East, the next year baseball,
football, and so on. If athletic fame is
what we desire, the case is not even
arguable.
This year Oregon University's foot
ball team gave Oregon more advertis
ing than twenty crews will give Stan
ford. The attention of the entire sport
ing public was focused on the team for
two weeks. Pictures of players and
coaches, with personal write-ups, ap
peared in the New York Times for
days.
If we desire publicity, why not try for
such a football team rather than handi
capping football and all other sports as
well by spending thousands of dollars
for crew.
For the present crew season Washing
ton has appropriated $8,500 and Cali
fornia $6,000. Our crew working under
the disadvantages, starting late (the
crews of California and Washington
have been out for weeks), will try to
compete with a $3,000 appropriation. It
is "obvious and the crew men admit that
we cannot run crew as it should be run
this season. In 1917 we spent $6,400
on crew and failed.
Many students are trying to make this
an argument between basketball and
crew. It is an argument between crew
on the one hand and our physical train
ing department and all sports on the
other.
A thousand men are trying to use
Encina Gymnasium from four to six in
the afternoon. Five hundred and fifty
men are signed up for basketball, two
hundred and eighty for boxing, sixty
for gymnastics, forty for wrestling, and
so on. And all of these men must suf
fer from lack of floor space and equip
ment. Not only could the proper provi
sions for taking care of these men be
had, but intercollegiate competition for
at least two hundped men, through the
organization of class and weight teams,
could be had by the use of the money
which annually will go to crew.
It is because of such reasons that I
believe that the present surplus of the
Board of Athletic Control should not be
used to finance crew.
