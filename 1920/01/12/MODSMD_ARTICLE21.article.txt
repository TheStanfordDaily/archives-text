# VOTE, AND VOTE EARLY

### 
/TOMORROW Stanford students will be given the opportunity to vote in two
■* elections. The first election is to determine the opinion of the students,
and also of the faculty, on the League of Nations and the Peace Treaty. The
second election, and the more important from our standpoint, is to determine
whether a surplus which the Board of Athletic Control estimates that they
■will have, shall be awarded to basketball so that sport may be properly taken
care of, or whether the award shall be made to crew for the same purpose.
Of the first election little need be said as to voting for the Daily Palo Alto
feels that its method in conducting this vote, namely in the class-rooms, will
bring it to the attention of practically every student in the University. The
important point here is that we hope that a study will have been made of
the six propositions to be voted upon so that an intelligent vote may be
made. It is especially desirous though that every one, both men and women,
make it a point to cast a ballot in the basketball-crew election. The Board
of Athletic Control have wisely left the decision of making the award up to
the students, and to justify their action in doing this we must have a large
representative vote. For merely a couple of hundred of us to turn out, would
be to almost make a joke of the entire idea. Once more, therefore we would
suggest, that the heads of the living groups on the campus make every effort
to Bee to it that their membership vote tomorrow.
