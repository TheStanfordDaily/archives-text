# A 						GOOD SPIRIT

P' is especially pleasing to note the gift to the University by Andrew J. Field,
Stanford alumnus of the class of 1912. Of course we are always glad to
see any gift made to the University, but the particularly gratifying point
about that gift of Field's is the way in which it is given. No conditions
whatsoever are made on the use to which the money is to me put. Its use
is simply left to the judgment of those who are at the time in charge of
affairs of the University. To quote Fields, "If there is some particular need
for this small amount in the Electrical Engineering Department, or some
other engineering department, I would somewhat prefer it used there. Other
wise I leave its disposition to your good judgment." We are glad to see a
Stanford alumnus of so recent a time making a gift in such a spirit.
