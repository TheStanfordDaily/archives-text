# TREATY REFERENDUM HAS 6 PROPOSITIONS
## 
### 
Following are the six propositions
which students and faculty will
vote on in the INTER-COLL EG l-
ATE TREATY REFERENDUM
that will be held by the Daily Palo
Alto tomorrow. Only one proposi
tion is to be voted for:
1. I favor the ratification of the
League and Treaty, without any
amendments or reservations.
2. I am opposed to the ratification
of the League and Treaty in any
form.
3. I am in favor of the ratification
of the Treaty and League, but only
with the specific reservations as voted
by the majority of the Senate.
4. I favor any compromise on the
reservation that will make possible
immediate ratification of the Treaty
and League.
5. I favor the Government pro
ceeding to make peace with Germany
at once and leaving the question of
a League of Nations to be settled
afterwards.
6. I favor a compromise of such a
character as will avoid the danger of
defeating ratification while making
clear that America can only be in
volved in war by a declaration of
Congress, that domestic questions and
the Monroe Doctrine arc entirely out
side of the jurisdiction of the
League; that plural votes of any
members arc all to be disqualified in
the event of a dispute wherein wc
are disqualified from voting, and that
on deciding to withdraw, wc are to
be the judge of whether our obliga
tions have been met.
