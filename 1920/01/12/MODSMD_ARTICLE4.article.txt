this year, and Mrs. Herbert Hoover,
both of them graduates of the Depart
m nt of Geology, have each established
a fellowship paying $600 a year for
two years to defray the expenses of a
student for the two years of graduate
study in the mining department.
When Professor Hoover joined the
faculty as head of the mining depart

uate school offering professional train
ing in mining and metallurgy leading
to the degree of Engineer on the com
pletion of the two-year graduate course.
Students must have received their un
dergraduate degree before enrollment in
the school of mining, for which the de
partment of geology offers the usual
preparation in the University.
The fellowship established by Pro
