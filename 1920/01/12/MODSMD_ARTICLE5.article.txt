# BREAK CAMPUS RECORD IN RED CROSS DRIVE
## 
### 
Sales from the Red Cross Christmas
Seal campaign, which was waged on
the campus prior to the close of last
quarter, totaled $389.74. This amount
exceeded the largest previous sales,
which was made in 1915, by nearly
two hundred dollars.
In recognition of the record of the
campus during the drive, the Santa
Clara County Red Cross Committee
has written to Miss Ruth Brooks, who
acted as local manager of the cam
paign: "We feel thai this is a splendid
showing for your community and the
committee v:'°h to thank everyone who
participated in the support of the good

▼/ork.
Following are tabulated returns from
the drive: Alpha Delta Phi, $4.85;
Alpha Tau Omega, $5 85; Alpha Sig
ma Phi, $5 50; Beta Theta Pi, $9.00;
Chi Psi, $11.00; Delta Chi, $11.15;
Delta Kappa Epsilon, no report; Delta
Tau Delta, $9.75; Delta Upsilon, $5.05;
Now that the Big Game has returned
and in addition the other conference
football games, there will be a much
larger surplus on hand in the future
than that of the year just passed. The
statement that the $4,000 surplus will
rot adequately support a crew is hardly
correct. The money will be used to
purchase a new shell, oars, and for re
pairing the old boats and boathouse.
It will go a long way toward putting
crew on its feet and in a position to be
maintained at less expense in the future.
We have a competent coach at hand
and i large amount of available mate
rial to pick from. Crew can hardly be
a "sport of the few" as the turnout is
one of the largest of any sport in the
University, and the greater part of the
men are kepi on the squad throughout
the season.
There can be no such thing as giving
basketball the preference at present with
the hope of reviving crew in the spring.
To turi: out a winning crew we must
start wo-'c j-.t once. This is the crucial
moment as far as crew is concerned.
Sha 1 we continue one of the most suc
cessful sports Stanford has ever had
or see it dropped forever?
