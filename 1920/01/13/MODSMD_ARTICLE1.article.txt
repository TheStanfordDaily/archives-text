# STANFORD VOTES RATIFICATION WITH MILD AMENDMENTS
## HEAVY VOTE IS CAST First Proposition Gets Second Highest Place on Ballot 
### 
OTANFORD endorsed the Peace
Treaty and the League of Nations by
an overwhelming vote in the straw vote
conducted by the Daily Palo Alto this
morning. The results of the canvas of
local opinion show that the proposition
favoring ratification of the league and
treaty and the proposition favoring rat
ification with mild reservations took a
heavy majority over the other four prop
ositions. The total number of votes cast
—I,ll4—were the largest returns ever
made in a campus election. Only fifty
six of this number categorically opposed
the treaty.
Ninety-eight faculty members voting
returned a majority of fifty-seven in fa
vor of ratification without reservation.
The next most favored proposition
among the faculty was No. 4, which fa
vored any compromise which would
make immediate ratification possible.
Among the students, Proposition 6, with
the mild reservations, was the most pop
ular, leading even the first proposition,
which supported ratification without
amendments. Figures compiled by the
Daily Palo Alto show that 28 per cent
of the student vote went to the sixth
proposition and 27 per cent to the first.
It is a fact worthy of some notice that
out of all the faculty members voting,
not one supported the second proposi
tion which opposed ratification in any
form.
Totals for the entire Intcrcollegiate
Referendum which was held throughout
the country today probably will be in by
the end of the week.
Totals for both faculty and students
arc as follows:
FACULTY —Proposition one,. 57;
four, 22; six, 16: five, 3, two, 0.
Total, 99.
STUDENTS —Proposition six, 326;
one. 306: three, 165; five, 161; four,
100; two. 56. Total 1114.
