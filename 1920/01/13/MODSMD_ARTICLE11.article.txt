# REVIEW DISCUSSES PLACE OF COLLEGE PEOPLE IN 'MOVIES'
## 
### 
Written by a Stanford graduate
about a Stanford graduate, Miss Alary
E. Walter's, '98, story of Denison Clift,
'07, "who made the world step aside,"
lias unusual interest to University stu
dents. Miss Walters is connected with
the publicity department of the William
Fox West Coast Studios : Hollywood,
of which Clift is the head of the sce
nario department. He begar. his lit
erary career as editor of the Sequoia,
Chaparral and Alumnus magazines, and
from that has advanced rapidly to his
splendid position.
As to whether or not the motion
picture business offers a field in which
the college-bred man and woman may
find for their talents and attainments
a satisfactory exploitation combined with
a sufficient remuneration, finds excellent
answer in this article.
To students interested in Stanford
traditions, institutions, and organiza
tions, Floyd L. McElroy's story of "The
Evolution of the Quad" will prove of
value and information. The growth of
the annual from the extremely small pub
lication of 250 pages, bound in white
boards with a red-back cover, which
appeared on the campus for the first
time in April, 1894, to the present per
fect volume, forms a part of the history
of the University.
The Review will be on sale Thursday
morning.
