STANFORD people today have declared themselves in favor of the League
of Nations. A great many of us have also stated that we favor any sort
of a compromise that will lead to immediate ratification of the Peace Treaty.
At the same time through all the colleges of the country a similar vote is
being taken. By means of this vote, taken simultaneously and on a uniform
ballot, some idea of the opinion of a large body of impartial and interested
voters is being secured. This result because of its national character will
be fairly representative of the public sentiment on the questions which are
now of the utmost interest to the national government. As far as we know
this is the first time that an attempt has been made to sound out college
sentiment-on any large national question of the day and the opinion expressed
will have a weight out of proportion to the numbers actually voting. The
result will be interesting to watch.
