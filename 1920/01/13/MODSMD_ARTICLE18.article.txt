IN the announcement today of the resignation of Farm Superintendent J. E.
Hewston, Stanford students are losing a friend. Coming here nine years
ago at the request of the late Charles Lathrop, former Business Manager of
the University, Hewston has labored incessantly for what he considered the
interests of Stanford. Of course at times we may have had our minor dis
