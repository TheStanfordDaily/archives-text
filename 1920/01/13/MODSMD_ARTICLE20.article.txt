### 
The Junipero Serra Club will give an
informal dance next Friday evening
in the Women's Clubhouse. The dance
is open to the campus public, and
since there are no other campus
dances being given on that evening,
it is hoped that a large number will
attend. Arrangements have been made
for the securing of Lisner's four
piece Jazz Orchestra. An admission
price of $1.00 a couple will be charged.
