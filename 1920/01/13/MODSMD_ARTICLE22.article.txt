### 
Carolina Lazzari, whose recital will be
the second of the Ganz-Lazzari-Galli-
Curci series under the direction of
Frank W. Healy, is said to be the fore
most among the contraltos before the
public today. Her voice Is of unusual
range and smoothness as evidenced by
the fact that some of her records con
tain the lowest note of a female voice
ever reported for phonograph purposes.
Miss Lazzari received her training in
Milano, Italy. After returning to this
country she did some important work,
but decided to abandon such efforts and
locate permanently New York City
for the completion of her vocal and dra
matic studies, declining every offer of
an engagement, to permit her vocal work
to go on uninterrupted.
At the end of two and a half years
she came under the observation of Cleo
fonte Campanini, and under the man
agement of Charles L. Wagner, the for
mer immediately engaging her for lead
ing contralto roles in the Chicago Grand
Opera Company, in which she made 20
appearances during the past season.
Tickets are on sale at Crandall's and
at the Bookstore.
