### 
OANTA CLARA will he Stanford's sec
ond opponent in the California-Ne
vada basketball series, when the two
teams meet on the San Jose High
School's court Wednesday nij>ht. Next
Saturday the Cardinal quintet will jour
ney to play Davis Farm on the Sacra
mento Y. M. C. A. floor.
Last year Santa Clara was defeated
by the Stanford five after a hard-fought
game. This season the Missionites have
another strong line-up, that has been in
practice longer than the Cardinal squad.
That fact probably will mean that the
game will be close throughout the en
tire time of play.
Coach Evans has developed a fast of
fense for his team, and is now spend
ing most of his time on the defense.
Hood, Mills, Righter, Carver, and Rich
mond will keep Santa Clar 's best of
guards on their feet every minute. Pe
louze, Austin, Butt, and Swanholm will
try to hold the Mission school point
makers down to a low score.
The Varsity squad is practicing every
night at the gymnasium, but the night
practice is working hardships on the
men out for the team. Evans is now
making an effort to alter this adverse
condition.
