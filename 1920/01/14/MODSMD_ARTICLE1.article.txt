### 
rrONIGHT Stanford will meet the
Santa Clara basketball team on
the San Jose High School court, at
8 o'clock. This will be the Stanford
quintet's second game in the Cali
fornia-Nevada series, having defeated
the St. Ignatius five last Saturday
night.
Coach Evans will start the game
tonight with the same line-up that
started the St. Ignatius match. Hood
and Mills will play at forward, while
Righter will hold his position at
center. Captain Palouze and Austin
will work the defensive end of the
court.
During the past few nights, the
coach has spent most of his time work
ing on the guards. With an improve
ment in the team's defense, Evans
will have a smoothly running spuad.
Last year the Cardinal team defeated
the Missionites, only after a liard
fought game. Tonight's game should
lie close because Stanford has not
been out for practice as long as their
opponents.
On the Encina gymnasium floor, the
freshmen team will meet the Palo
Alto High School five in a practice
game tonight, which will start at 7:30
o'clock. Coach Acker will probably
start the game with a combination of
live from the following: Burkhard,
Rogers, DeGroot. Howell. Pollard.
Tritle and Williamson.
