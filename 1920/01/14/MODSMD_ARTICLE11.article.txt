# Whitaker Tells of Compensated Dollar
## Article Will be Published in the Current Issue of the "Cardinal" 
### 
In an article entitled "The Stabilized
Dollar," which will appear in the
forthcoming issue of the Cardinal,
Professor A. C. Whitaker discusses
what has happened to the dollar dur
ing the last two years due to the on
slaught of the high cost of living, and
deals with the merits of the novel and
radical scheme proposed by Professor
Irving Fisher of Yale, to "stabilize"
or "compensate" the money unit. This
scheme is beginning to be more and
more regarded throughout the country
as nssentiall sound, so much so in fact,
that a bill is now before Congress
which would put this system into ef
fect.
The system is, in effect, the aboli
tion of a definite quantity of gold as
an arbitrary and absolute standard,
and the semi-substitution of the neces
sities of life as the collateral for our
currency. Figuratively, the dollar
would cease to have a definite gold
value, but would be measured in terms
of an average of a plate of ham and
eggs, a scuttle of coal, a suit of clothes.
A dollar woidd in the main have the
same value, as it could always buy
relatively the same amount of goods.
Under this system, the amount of gold
that a dollar woidd be redeemed for
would be varied from time to time, in
accordance with the plentifulness or
shortage of commodities. The scheme,
according to Professor Whitaker, is
far from being as radical as it seems,
and the great danger is that it will
be misunderstood. He discusses it
thoroughly in his article, and demon
strates how it would work.
The Cardinal will appear early next
week.
