# RUGBY WINS FAVOR AS AN OLYMPIC SPORT
## The 						Metropolitan Dailies Are Advocating for Coast Fifteen 
### 
Victory in its three rugby matches,
scheduled for this quarter by the Cali
fornia Rugby Union at its recent meet
ing, will increase Stanford's prospect
of climbing with California to send
a fifteen to tin; Olympic games. New
York newspapers have entered into
the campaign for making rugby one
of the events of the seventh Olympiad,
and are aligning themselves with
trainer Harry Maloney in advocating
a coast, team to represent the United
States. Maloney's telegram to Rubi
er, stating that several world-famous
players and coaches were available for
a team, has been published in the
metropolitan sheets as their strongest
argument in favor of the sport.
The Associated Press has asked for
an article on the personnel which will
compose the Stanford section of the
team, conceding that the opportunity
for gaining Maloney's goal is excep
tionally good. On the tentative list of
events drawn up by the newly ap
pointed Olypian Gages Committee of
the A. A. U., rugby has been given
a place.
Another letter will be sent to that
organization by University officials,
listing the names of several Stanford
athletes they believe qualified to make
places on the American team in other

events. The names have not been
made public, but it is known that
Templeton will be mentioned in the
high-jump, Caughey and Bihlman in
the shot-put, and Green in the pole
vault.

union are as follows:
San Mateo at Stanford, January 17;

Olympic Club at Stanford, January
24; Spalding referee.
Stanford at California, February 14;
