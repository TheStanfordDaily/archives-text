# SIGN UP
## 
### 
STANFORD will hold the annual spring sports sign-up rally tomorrow night
in the Kncina Club Rooms. Every man in the University should be in
attendance at that time. A chance will be given all to sign up for som6
branch of sport. This is an opportunity which comes only once a year and
should be taken advantage of by as many as possible. A wide diversity of
sports are offered this spring. Among the major sports are track, baseball,
basketball, and crew. Basketball workouts are already well under way
but the practice for the other sports has not started as yet, and it is these
in particular that we must prepare now. By a clear and decisive majority
yesterday, Stanford students decided that they wanted to maintain crew as a
sport. The next thing now is to turn out a successful crew, and to do this
it is absolutely as necessary that there be a large turnout of men as it is that
we vote sufficient money to the sport to conduct it. The same thing holds
true of the other sports. That competition is the essence of success is an
old truth. The greater the number of men that sign up tomorrow night the
surer we will be of turning out winning teams this spring.
We all know that teams are only developed and perfected when the second
and third string of men make the first string men fight for their positions.
It is surely better to have been a man in the lowest division than not to have
tried at all. Scarcely a place exists in the entire country where conditions
are more ideal for the indulging in of out-of-door sports than right here on
the farm, and full advantage should be taken of this situation. Be on hand
toworrow night to sign up for some sport.
