Jhe report that California has strength
ened its fifteen by the addition of sev
eral football men, added to the fact that
Stanford is conceded a good opportuni

turn out immediately and keep the team
work tip to the standard of last quar
ter. The coach joined hands with

Rugby officials are beginning imme
diately to shape up a tentative team for

es are anxious to win a world victory
for Stanford.
The next game for the fifteen is
against San Mateo Athletic Club, and
is to be played here on Saturday aft
ernoon. In order not to injure Stan
ford's chances for the games the minor
