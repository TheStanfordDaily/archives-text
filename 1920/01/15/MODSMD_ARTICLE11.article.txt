# Dr. Murray Shows Polish Conditions
## Stewed Grass and Wild Roots Form Only Foodstuffs Says Lecturer 
### 
"Approximately 500,000 human beings
in Poland will starve to death within
the next year regardless of efforts made
to send food in because of the poor
transportation facilities and the pitiful
ly insufficient amount of food-stuffs in
the country at the present time," stated
Dr. Virginia Murray, '14, in discussing
her war experiences in Poland before
a large audience last evening in the Lit
tle Theatre. The people of Poland are
subsisting on stewed grass and wild
roots and fruits at the present time,
and this meager supply will not hold out
much longer.
Dr. Murray served with the Americait
Red Cross in Poland during the war,
