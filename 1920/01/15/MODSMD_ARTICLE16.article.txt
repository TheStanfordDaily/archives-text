# Y.M.C.A. ARRANGES RELIGIOUS LECTURES
## 
### 
Tentative plans for a lecture course
composed of six lectures of a religious
nature are being arranged by the local
Y. M. C. A. The subjects of these
lectures will be "The Social Aspect
of Foreign Missions," or "Compara
tive Religions," or some other such
similar topic. This course will be
given if fifty, or more, students call
at the "Y" office this week and signi
fy their intention of taking it. The
time of the lectures will be arranged
in such a manner that the majority
of those who sign up will be able to
attend without inconvenience in their
other work.
