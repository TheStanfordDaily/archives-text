# FRESHMAN FIVE WINS FROM PALO ALTO BY ONE-SIDED SCORE
## 
### 
The Stanford Frosh basketball team
took the Palo Alto High five into camp
last night in the Encina gym by the
score of 40-5. The game was one-sided
throughout, and the first-year players
had 110 trouble at any time. Coach
Acker used the entire squad against the
opposing team, playing twelve men.
Rogers put up a fast game at forward,
scoring most of the baskets while he'was
in. The teamwork, as a whole was
rather loose and showed the need of
more practice.
The Babes meet the San Jose High
School team on the local floor next Sat
urday night.
