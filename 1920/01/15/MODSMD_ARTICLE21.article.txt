## 
### 
There arc still some 125 individual
pictures of Juniors to be taken for the
Quad. The management requests that
all pictures he in before the second week
in February. All those who intend to
graduate with the class of 1921 are con
sidered as juniors, even though they did
not originally register with the present
Junior Class. All who come under this
classification but who wish to appear in
the Quad as members of the class of
1921 arc requested to pay their junior
assessment and to report to Davey's
Studio in Palo Alto to have their pic
tures taken as soon as possible.
