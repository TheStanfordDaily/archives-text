# NO QUEENING

### 
IN the announcement that the first upper-class jolly-up of the year will occur
Saturday night comes the opportunity for Stanford people to become
thoroughly acquainted. Plans call for the wearing of "Quad" clothes and no
queening; in other words the jolly-up is to be placed back in the position
which it formerly occupied. The word jolly-up itself perhaps expresses the
original purpose of the affair better than anything else and is itself peculiar
to Stanford. In years back every man and woman in the University attended,
and the rules as to dress and queening were what made this possible.
No better chance will be offered one to make friends than this function
Saturday night. This year more than ever before there are many men and
women in Stanford unacquainted. Unusual conditions have perhaps brought
this about but the fact exists nevertheless. Many service men have returned
to the campus and find that their class has in the meantime graduated and
as a result their acquaintance is not as wide as it formerly was. Many new
women entered last fall, and probably due to the fact that the jolly-ups for
some unxeplainable reason were not held, have not become acquainted.
To make the jolly-up the success it ought to be, co-operation is necessary
from both men and women. The rules laid down by the management as to
dress and queening will have to be followed. The chances are that the regula
tions regarding dress will be carried out but this is really the minor point
of the two. For success of the affair the no-queening rule will have to be
rigidly enforced. We would suggest that the old custom of the men lining
up at the door in readiness for the first man who comes escorting a woman be
reinstated. Let's have co-operation from all, and a big attendance at the
jolly-up.
