### 
The question whether the United
States should intervene in Mexico has
been chosen by the members of Nestoria
as the subject of the try-outs to be held
this evening for the annual debate be
tween Euphronia and Nestoria.
All of the members of the society are
eligible for the debate. A number have
already signified their intention of try
ing for a position on the team, and it
is expected as a result that more inter
est will be taken jn the contest than
formerly.
