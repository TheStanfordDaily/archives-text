Coach M. L. McCJintock today re
ceived a telegram from the University
of Notre Dame requesting a debate
with Stanford sometime during the
spring quarter when the eastern de
haters will tour California.
McClintock believed that owing to
a full schedule he will be unable to
arrange the clash requested, though
no definite answer is yet made. The
University of Southern California T.aw
School has also asked for a debate
during the spring quarter.
