# CARDINAL ARTICLE DISCUSSES NEW MANIA
## "Mania For Being Obvious" Is Theme of Novel Criticism 
### 
That a new mania exists abroad,
the "Mania For Being Obvious." is the
opinion of W. J. Losh, '17, in an ar
ticle for the forthcoming issue of the
Cardinal. Although the general pub
lic is bad enough, he declares that the
campus has taken most heartily to the
new tendency.
According to Losh, everyone is tak*
ing particular pains to see that what
ever he does is pointedly exposed to
the public view. Naturalness and
subtlety have completely disappeared,
and everycftie, after picking up a few
hobbies or manners of impressing
people, uses tactics as patent as those
of moving-picture actors in "register
ing," usually by "close-ups." Although
no class of people are exempt by
Losh, certain types are particularly
marked by their obvious activities.
The late type of "arm-waving" drunks,
the co-eds, whom he claims are the
worst of all in this respect, the varsi
ty athletes, and many others, even
the much berated professors, fall be
fore his onslaught.
The Cardinal will appear on the
Quad early next week.
