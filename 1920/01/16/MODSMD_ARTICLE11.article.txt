# One Fence Is... Total Damage.. For Last Night
## 
### 
Leaving several uprooted fence-posts
and saplings in his wake, an unknown
driver piloted his touring car through
the fence surrounding the Stanford
bandstand last night, hurdled the same
fence again and then dived for the bank
on the opposite side of the road. An
examination of the wreckage shows that
though what must have been almost a
miracle, the mysteri- us assailant of the
fence escaped with his automobile, as
well as himself, fairly intact. Who the
driver was and why he developed this
sudden grudge against the inoffensive
bandstand fencepostf remains a mystery.
Thefe is only the mute evidence of the
prostrate fence and shrubbery, and pos
sibly that of the calendar which shows
on close examination that the attack on
the fence occurred on the eve of Janu
ary 16.
