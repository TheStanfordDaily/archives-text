The campus residents who are or
ganizing to take up the problem of
high living costs determined to Invite
the residents of Palo Alto, Mayfleld,
and Los Altos, to co-operate with
them in forming an organization in
cluding the whole of this community,
at a meeting held in the Women's
Clubhouse yesterday afternoon.
This action was taken because it
is felt that the larger and more com
prehensive body can be more effective
than the smaller one of the Stanford
campus alone and on account of the
evidences of widespread interest in
the enterprise that have been shown
by women of these other communi
ties.
The organization committee, consist

L. L. Burlingame, Mrs. Henry W.
Stuart, and Mrs. Frank M. McParland,
of the campus group, was instructed

dotf.ils of a plan of action will be laft
