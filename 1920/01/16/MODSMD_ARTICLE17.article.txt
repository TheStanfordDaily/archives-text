# GRANT OF AUTHORITY TO WOMEN SUMMARIZED
## 
### 
The grant of authority drafted by the
Student Affairs Committee in which the
powers of the organized women of Stan
ford University are definitely set forth
was passed upon and accepted by a
meeting of Women's Council yesterday,
and by Women's Conference which met
last evening. This grant of powers was
drawn up in answer lo an appeal by the
women to be given written statement
of their powers in student government.
The grant is virtually a codification of
existing practices.
Expulsion or suspension are the pen
alticcs for a violation against the Uni
versity ruling which taboos riding on
the highway at night, according to an
announcement made by Conference.
This punishment is not an innovation.
