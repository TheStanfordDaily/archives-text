# TO BE EXPECTED

### 
COMMENTING editorially yesterday on the recent straw vote in the colleges
of the country upon the League of Nations, the San Francisco Chronicle
says that "it is rather interesting but of no particular consequence." This
is exactly what we wotald expect from the Chronicle â€”neither more nor less.
The only question in our mind is whether they honestly believe what they
say or whether they are simply trying to delude themselves into thinking
that it is so, for, of course, we all know what the San Francisco publication's
political ideas and hopes on this subject are.
They give the professors of the country credit for being learned men but
at the time say that the professionel attitude of the professor is to follow
some one else in practical affairs. They are of the opinion that the women
among the faculties of the universities have probably never read the treaty.
Little credit is given to students for their ability to think and the Chronicle
seems to think that the entire vote is intereseting merely as showing the
influence of sentiment. A splendid state of affiairs to picture for a college
community. Compare their opinion with that of the Christian Science Moni
tor which says: "If any considerable number of 35,000 to 40,000 faculty per
guau ailU fIOO (OOrt fiollcgno und lHjiVOroltioo
record themselves sincerely, the result will surpass in interest and import
ance any straw vote ever taken before. For the colleges and universities
offer unusual facilities for organizing the voting, just as they provide a body
of voters whose opinion will be peculiarly worth nothing, especially as the
faculty and the students vote will be tabulated separately. And the number
of diffusion of the institutions participating will give a Nation-wide char
acter to the expression, along with a certain element that is authoritative."
We believe that when the result of the entire vote is known, tentative
results of which already show a preponderance of favors for the League of
Nations in some form or another, that certain leaders among politicians will
be guided by it to a larger extent than the Chronicle will admit.
