of the Amateur Athletic Union in New
York, as a follow-up to the telegram in
which he stated that ' several world
famous rugby players and coaches were
available at Stanford for an American
fifteen.
In answer to the wire, which was re
printed by the metropolitan dailies, Ru
bien wrote that the committee had not
yet taken steps in *he matter, and in
ferred that the chance to have rugby
entered in the games was favorable.
His recent letter to Rubien is Malo
ney's recommendation for athletes in still
other events. He says, in part:
"I notice some ve r y likely material in
the bunch. Reg. Caughcy, shot; Dink
Templeton, high-jump; Wells, hurdles;
Green, pole-vault; and Morris Kirksey,
national junior champion in the sprints,
are all back in col\ege. 'Jud' House,
hurdler, will be back in the spring. All

be in the running when the Olympic try
outs take place."
All the officials in charge of athletics
emphasize the importance of a maximum
number of candidates turning out for
rugby at once, so that when the invita
tion to Stanford comes, it will find the
strongest fifteen in the university in
readiness.
