# MEETING OF COLLEGES ATTENDED BY HUSTON
## 
### 
Dean A. C. Huston returned this week
from a meeting of the Association of
American Colleges held in Chicago.
While in Chicago he also attended the
annual meeting of the Association of
American Law.
Professor Huston stated today that
the chief business of the college asso
ciation was a discussion of plans for an
international exchange of college stu
dents. It is already planned for 200
French college women to be sent to
American colleges by the French Gov
ernment this next year. It is hoped

further that the United States will send
a number of its students to European
institutions. General Leonard Wood
spoke at the meeting on the general need
of preparedness in the American col
leges.
At the meeting of the law association
the advisability of lengthening the law
curriculum to font- years instead of the
customary three was discussed. Altho
no definite action on the question was
taken, Dean Huston stated that lie
looked for the change to come in a few
years.
While in Chicago Dean Huston spent
a few days as a guest of Professor and
Mrs. Woodward. Mr. Woodward was
formerly dean of the law school here.
