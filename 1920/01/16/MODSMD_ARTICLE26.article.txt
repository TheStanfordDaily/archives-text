# Y.M.C.A. WILL HOLD CLASSES IN CHURCH
## 
### 
Announcement has been made by
the local Y. M. C. A. that a class for
the discussion of religious and bible
questions will be conducted in the
Memorial Church vestry on Sunday
mornings at 10:00 o'clock. This class
will be conducted by O. M. Johnston,
head of the Romanic Language De
partment, and has been instituted as
a special convenience to men students
living on the campus who do not have
the opportunity to go to the Sunday
morning services in the different
churches in Palo Alto.
The Y. M. C. A. has asked that any
men students who are considering
entering this class leave any questions
that they would like to have discussed
at the "Y" office. The first meeting
of the class will be held next Sunday
morning.
