# DE VRIES TELLS OF FREEDOM IN FRANCE FOR THE 'CARDINAL'
## 
### 
With the question of the prestige
and power of France on the continent
of Europe, and its influence on the
League of Nations and world politics
one of the burning problems of rhe
hour, the article by Professor Louis
P. de Vries, of the French Department,
on "The Progress of Freedom in
France," in the January issue of the
Cardinal, is especially timely.
Professor de Vries has made an
especial study of the subject, and dis
cusses in broad terms the influence
that France has played in spreading
freedom throughout the modern world
during the last thousand years. He
shows how the modern ideas of re
action, and the wildest forms of revo
lutionary thought have sprung from
the conflict* in France. His article
aims to give a background of the out
come of similar movements in past
history to anyone who is attempting
to forecast what is coming in the
present conflict between the froces of
direct action, reacting, and the great
body of the people. This avticle will
be of special interest to ex-service
men, and others who know of condi
tions at first hand.
The psychology of ex-soldiers in re
lation to the present national unrest
is ably penetrated by R. A. Donaldson,
who writes on Henri Barbusse's new
novel, "Light"—the most powerful and
challenging book on after-the-war con
ditions yet published. Barbusse was
a soldier in the French army, and
wrote the war-book, "Under Five,"
which swept Europe and America like
wildfire when it appeared during the
great battles in 1918. Donaldson con
tends that the attitude of men return
ing from the war must be taken into
account in dealing with national prob
lems, and shows that Barbusse's novel
is an equally unsound result of the
restlessness experienced by every ex
service man on returning to civilian
life.
The Cardinal will be on sale Tues
