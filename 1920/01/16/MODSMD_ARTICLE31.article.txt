# AMERICAN LEGION HAS INTERESTING PROGRAM
## 
### 
Fremont Post No, 52, of the American
Legion, combined business with pleasure
last Wednesday night, by following up
its regular monthly meeting- with an
amusement program, which varied in
acts from boxing matches to mono
logues. Stanford men furnished the
bulk of the talent, which was arranged
by Harry Maloney, in charge of the en
tertainment. Among the numbers on the
program were fencing in which Maloney
himself took part, a monologue by Les
ter Seib, gym acts by Hudson, wrestling
by McCullough and Miller, and boxing
by "Phil" Neer, Bovcher, Madden, and
Brown.
