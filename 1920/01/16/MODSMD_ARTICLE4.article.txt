# CARDINAL FIFTEEN TO MEET SAN MATEO RUGGERS SATURDAY
## 
### 
Stanford faces the rugby fifteen of
the San Mateo Athletic Club on the
Stanford field tomorrow afternoon,
with a practically rebuilt forward line.
The. weakness of the team, as dis
played in its defeat by the Australians
at Davis Farm, was due to the loss of
the forwards who made the northern
trip, and who left the squad, some to
return to California, and others to play
varsity basketball.
Wylie and Carroll have been giving
all their time during the week to re
inforce the forward line, and tomor
row's game will see the result of their
efforts. Wylie would not make a state
ment today as to the strength of the
new first line, but it is thought that
he is planning a surprise by playing
an unusually strong combination.
In spite of Wylie's request that ad
ditional material try out for the team,
in view of the proximity of the Cali
fornia game and the Olympics, an in
sufficient number of candidates have
answered the call. Still more should
bring their support to the squad on
Monday, is the opinion of the coaches.
The following men will take the field
tomorrow afternoon at 2:30:
Templeton, Kirksey, Morris, Black,
Maltby, Foster, Lynn, Doe, Carroll,
Wrenn. Dickey, James, Boulware,
Wallace, Nelson, Kelley, Hale, Reavis,
Glasson, and Patrick.
