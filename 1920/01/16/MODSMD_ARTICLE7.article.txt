# SPRING SPORTS RALLY STARTS NEW SEASON GOING
## VARSITY MEN SPEAK Coach Evans and Dr. Angell Urge Candidates to Sign Up 
### 
Enthusiasm reigned supreme at
the annual spring sports rally, last
night, which was held in Encina Hall.
"Doc" Martin, and his assistant yell
leaders kept the club room in an up-roar
throughout the evening, letting down
only long enough to hear talks by lead
ers of the various spring sports.
Dr. Angell, Coach Evans, "Cash"
Davis, "Jess" Wells, "Bobby" Pelouze,
and W. H. Maloney gave short talks
urging the men to sign up for one or
more of the sports. Several hundred
of the men present signified their inten
tion of reporting for some athletic
event.
Two parades lead the men over to
Encina for the rally, one of them start
ing at the Sigma Nu, the other starting
at Sequoia Hall. When the two sec
tions gathered at Encina, along with the
men already there the Hall was com
pletely filled.
