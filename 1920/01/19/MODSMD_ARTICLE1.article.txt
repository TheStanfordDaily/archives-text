# VARSITY BEATS DAVIS FARM QUINTET 38-21
## TEAM DEFENSE SHOWS UP WELL Stanford Wins Third League Game by Fast Rally in Second Half 
### 
Stanford captured its third game of
the California-Nevada Basketball
League, when Davis Farm went down
to defeat last Saturday night by a
score o* 38 to 21. The game was
played at the Sacramento Y. M. C. A.
The Cardinal quintet failed to get
started until the beginning of the sec
ond half, when the score stood 15 to
14 against them.
Stanford's defense showed up well
throughout the contest, Davis Farm
making only four field goals. The
Farm had a strong team on the floor,
which was considerably larger and
heavier than the Stanford five. The
strength of Davis lay in her guards
and in the ability to basket foul goals.
Coach Evans started the following
line-up: Hood and Davies, forwards;
Righter, center; Capt. Pelouze and
Austin, guards. Later in the game the
offensive lineup was changed to Hood
and Righter, forwards; Carver, center.
