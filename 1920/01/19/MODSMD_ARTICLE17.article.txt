# STANFORD "FROSH" WIN FROM SAN JOSE HIGH
## Basketball Game Goes to the Babes by Score of 20to16 
### 
With both teams playing a ragged
game, the freshman squad defeated
the San Jose High School five, by a
score of 10 to 16. The contest was
played on the Encina court last Sat
urday afternoon.
Poor passes, fumbles, and lack of
team work, characterized the playing
of both quintets. The team work of
the San Jose team showed up consider
ably better than that of Stanford, part
ly because of the fact that the fresh
men have not been in practice as long
as their opponents this season. A few
lucky individual plays saved the fresh
men from defeat.
Burkhard, Rogers, Austin, Howell,
DeGroot, Pollard, Tritle, Carpenter,
Clark and Piggett were used in the
game by Coach Acker. San Jose
played the following: Howell, Mc-
Laren, Driscoll, Sf>arks, Spoon, Kelly
and Walker.
