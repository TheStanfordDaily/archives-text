# RUGBY TEAM WINS FROM BELTISTON CLUB
## Fifteen Takes Gameâ€”10-3; Team Work Not Too Smooth 
### 
In spite of comparatively weak team
work and a newly built forward line
which was not working too smoothly,
Wylie's rugby fifteen defeated the Bel
tiston Athletic Club team 10 to 3 on
the local field Saturday afternoon.
Until the closing minutes of the sec
ond half, the game was hard and even,
though the ball was kept in Beltiston
territory the greater part of the time.
Three regulars on the Stanford squad,
lent to the visitors for the occasion,
helped check Cardinal scoring during the
first half, and it was only by desperate
sprinting that Kirksey rushed the ball
over for the initial Stanford score before
the whistle ended period. Temple
ton converted, and the half ended 5 to 3
in favor of Stanford.
Loose play by both sides, and a relapse
on the part of the Stanford backs, who
had been carrying the brunt of the at
tack, spoiled the second period. The
ball was kept on the San Mateo goal
line, but Patrick alone broke through
for the second and last Cardinal score.
"Dink," whose kicking throughout the
game had been poor, redeemed himself
by converting from a difficult angle.
Wallace played fine ball as one of the
forwards, and Patrick, Kirksey, and
Card featured with him. Wylie has de
termined on a general shake-up before
next Saturday's battle with the Olympic
Club.
