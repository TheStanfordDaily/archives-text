REGISTRATION for the National Election is now open to all qualified voters.
According to the laws of the State of California, voters have until April
3 to register so as to vote in the May primaries. Of course it is desirable
that all register now so as to be certain that it is done, and politicians are
making every effort to see that the adherents of their party do register.
Obviously from a standpoint of interest in the nation, it is desirable that
every one who has the right to vote should exercise that privilege, and to
do this it is necessary to register.
To be able to register, it is necessary that you swear that you have been
a resident of the State of California for one year, of the county in which
you reside for ninety days, and of the precinct in which you register thirty
days, and of course, that you are twenty-one years of age. Those people
who desire to register at Stanford therefore must have lived in California
one year, in Santa Clara County for ninety days, and Stanford University for
thirty days. To be able to consider yourself as having a residence here, it is
necessary that you consider this your home for the time being. This does
not mean that you intend to remain here permanently but merely that you
consider this your home now.
In considering the desirability of registering here there are several factors
to be considered. In the first place if you do not intend to be here next fall,
voo-iatpr here and not re-register elsewhere, unless you return here
you would lose your vote in the iNauuimi — o* .•* r%r, ao ii»io
to register here now and to vote in the May primaries, and then to register
again in another precinct thirty days before the fall election, or if you have
moved to another county, ninety days' residence there will be required for
registration. Those who intend to leave the State of California at the close of
either tho winter or spring quarters, too, will by registering here now deprive
themselves of an opportunity to vote unless they return to California. For by
registering here now you make yourself a resident of the State of California,
and as most of the States of the Union require at least a year's residence to
acquire the right to vote, it would be impossible to establish a residence in
another state in time to register, because it is less than a year from now
until the presidential election.
Incidentally, too, Stanford people have another thing to consider when
registering. Laws of California require that you specify your party when
registering, and at the primaries you vote only the ticket of the party speci
fied. We all have a particular interest in Herbert Hoover, and if by any
chance he should become a candidate of one or the other large party, if you
had already registered in the opposite party from which he was making his
candidacy for the nomination, you would be deprived from aiding in nominat
ing him.
Consequently Stanford voters have many things to consider about their
registration.
The individual must consider carefully the things affecting his or her
particular case, and decide whether it is desirable to register now, and
whether to register at Stanford. By all means see to it that you are registered
so as to vote in the primaries, if possible, but the presidential election at
all events.

chance he should become a candidate of one or the other large party, if you
had already registered in the opposite party from which he was making his
candidacy for the nomination, you would be deprived from aiding in nominat
ing him.
Consequently Stanford voters have many things to consider about their
registration.
The individual must consider carefully the things affecting his or her
particular case, and decide whether it is desirable to register now, and
whether to register at Stanford. By all means see to it that you are registered
so as to vote in the primaries, if possible, but the presidential election at
all events.
REGISTRATION for the National Election is now open to all qualified voters.
According to the laws of the State of California, voters have until April
3 to register so as to vote in the May primaries. Of course it is desirable
that all register now so as to be certain that it is done, and politicians are
making every effort to see that the adherents of their party do register.
Obviously from a standpoint of interest in the nation, it is desirable that
every one who has the right to vote should exercise that privilege, and to
do this it is necessary to register.
To be able to register, it is necessary that you swear that you have been
a resident of the State of California for one year, of the county in which
you reside for ninety days, and of the precinct in which you register thirty
days, and of course, that you are twenty-one years of age. Those people
who desire to register at Stanford therefore must have lived in California
one year, in Santa Clara County for ninety days, and Stanford University for
thirty days. To be able to consider yourself as having a residence here, it is
necessary that you consider this your home for the time being. This does
not mean that you intend to remain here permanently but merely that you
consider this your home now.
In considering the desirability of registering here there are several factors
to be considered. In the first place if you do not intend to be here next fall,
voo-iatpr here and not re-register elsewhere, unless you return here
you would lose your vote in the iNauuimi — o* .•* r%r, ao ii»io
to register here now and to vote in the May primaries, and then to register
again in another precinct thirty days before the fall election, or if you have
moved to another county, ninety days' residence there will be required for
registration. Those who intend to leave the State of California at the close of
either tho winter or spring quarters, too, will by registering here now deprive
themselves of an opportunity to vote unless they return to California. For by
registering here now you make yourself a resident of the State of California,
and as most of the States of the Union require at least a year's residence to
acquire the right to vote, it would be impossible to establish a residence in
another state in time to register, because it is less than a year from now
until the presidential election.
Incidentally, too, Stanford people have another thing to consider when
registering. Laws of California require that you specify your party when
registering, and at the primaries you vote only the ticket of the party speci
fied. We all have a particular interest in Herbert Hoover, and if by any
chance he should become a candidate of one or the other large party, if you
had already registered in the opposite party from which he was making his
candidacy for the nomination, you would be deprived from aiding in nominat
ing him.
