In a recent editorial entitled "The
Bookstore Again" you suggest that our
action in doing away with free ink
is an insult to students added to in
juries' which have previously occurred.
A few words of explanation may lead
you to see this matter in a different
light.
The demands upon the bookstore
have naturally increased with the in
creased student body. More clerks
had to lie employed, better salaries
had to be paid and more space was
needed.
A number of public service features,
of which free ink was one, were tak
ing so much time, costing so much to
maintain and interfering so seriously
with the convenience of the custom
ers that we decided to do away with
these and bend all our efforts toward
the main purpose of the store—to pro
vide the necessary books and supplies
at as low a cost as possible and with
as efficient service as possible.
We taught that the free ink de
tracted greatly from the appearance
of the store and interfered consider
ably with our work. Incidentally, the
patrons were paying at least $50 a
year to maintain it and relatively few
received any benefit.
We believe that the features which
have been discontinued will in most
cases be provided for elsewhere with
much better facilities than were pos
sible in the bookstore.
The directors and the manager are
doing .all they can to make this or
ganization serve its main purpose and
they would greatly appreciate the
hearty co-operation of the students and
especially of the student publications
in their efforts.
Very truly yours,
JOSEPH G. BROWN,
President of The Stanford Bookstore.
