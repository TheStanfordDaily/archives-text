# Disabled Soldier Is Victimized By Petty Crook
## 
### 
There is a certain type of humanity
that the Stanford community usually
congratulates itself on being free from.
But now and again we are inflicted by
"small beers" in the profession of petty
crime who lack enough courage to at
tempt safe-cracking hut are cowardly
enough to break into a locker when they
are protected by the confidence of Stan
ford in the honesty of Stanford people.
A victim of one of these despicable
petty criminals came into the Daily Palo
Alto office this morning. He was a dis
abled ex-service man. According to his
story, some one removed his gloves from
an overcoat that he had left hanging
outside while he was in a class room.
He added that they were the only gloves
he had and that he had less than fifty
dollars to finish out the winter.
The disabled ex-soldier showed a for
giving spirit. If the petty larceipst felt
that he needed the gloves worse than he
did, he could have them. In his own
words, "Not that I cxpcct to recover
my property by pleading for its return
to the place where it was found, but with
the same self-sacrificing spirit that its
owner had whci*he carried two rifles on
forced marches in eastern France, I
give them to you, Buddie, and your con
science need never hurt you."
The ex-soldier is optimistic; he thinks
that the culprit will return them on
reading.his appeal. But he is wrong.
Our tinhorn crook is too busy to read.
Just now he is probably engaged in put
ting arsenic in his grandmother's Cream
of Wheat.
