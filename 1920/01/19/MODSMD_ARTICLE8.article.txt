### 
Try-outs for the English Club play,
which has been announced as "Ruther
ford and Son," to be produced February
20, are scheduled for next Wednesday
afternoon in the Assembly Hall at one
o'clock. The committee in charge is
very anxious that all men and women on
the campus who are interested in dram
atics report to the try-outs, on account
of the dearth of known material now
on the campus.
"Rutherford and Son" was written by
Githa Sowerby and represents a more
serious type of play than has been at
tempted on the campus in some time.
It is the hope of English Club that this
play represent the same kind of work
as was done in "Justice," which was
produced four years ago.
Try-outs should offer more opportu
nities than ever before on account of
the entirely different work which is
needed., "Rutherford and Son" presents
a distinct contrast to the very popular
Broadway successes which have been
given here during the last few years.
It is a play of the more or less drab,
naturalistic school, realistic in atmos
phere, and polished in tone. "Ruther
ford and Son" will come as something
as distinctively different for the Stanford
theater-goer.
