# ALUMNI ENDOWMENT FUND FOR STANFORD SUGGESTED BY TREAT
## LETTER EXPLAINS IDEA Professor and Wife Found New Tuition Scholarship 
### 
ESTABLISHMENT of an "Alumni
Endowment Fund," the income from
which would be used for general Univer
sity purposes, is suggested by Professor
Payson J. Treat, of the History Depart
ment, in a letter written to President
Ray Lyman Wilbur, and made public
this morning. The suggestion is made
in a communication concerning a tui
tion scholarship which Professor and
Mrs. Treat have just established. They
hav turned over $120 to the University
and will repeat the gift annually.
Professor Treat expresses the hope
that after the money situation becomes
normal again, all alumni contributions
may be placed in a general alumni fund
to furnish an income for the University.
The donors of the most recent scholar
ship believe that every graduate of a
University owes an obligation to it, at
least to the extent of the money ex
pended for his education.
The Treat scholarship will be awarded
by the University committee appointed to
make these awards.
The letter from Professor Treat, in
part, follows:
"May I add that we have long recog
nized the duty of every one who has
attended a college or university to as
sume an obligation to reimburse the in
stitution to the extent of its expenditure
for his education. This should be a min
imum—beyond that the contributions of
the former student should increase with
his opportunity to give. I have acted in
accordance with this belief in the case
of my eastern alma mater. But in the
case of Stanford we both labored under
the prevailing ideas of the sufficiency
of. the University endowments. The es
tablishment of the tuition fee seemed to
offer an opportunity to use a small sum
advantageously, and we availed our
selves of it. But after the present emerg
ency is over it occurs to us that it might
be well to place these small alumni con
tributions in an 'Alumni Endowment
Fund,' the income from which should be
used, however, for general University
purposes. A general acceptance of such
an obligation on the part of the alumni
would result in a steadily increasing
fund available for the progressive needs
of the University."
