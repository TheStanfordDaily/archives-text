# New Candidates Needed for Fifteen
## Coaches Are Training For Olympic Club Contest 
### 
Still handicapped by an insufficient
number of new candidates, Coaches Wy
lic and Carroll have been putting the
rugby fifteen through hard intensive
drills in preparation for Saturday's con
test with the Olympic Club. New com
binations are being formed in the line of
forwards, and every effort is being made
to smooth the teamwork which did not
prove itself up to par against the Bel
tiston Club.
By recouping for its defeat by the
Auzacs at the expense of the club men,
who won over the Davis Farm men
Saturday in the best league game of the
quarter, the "fifteen" hopes to prove its
right to the club title, and increase its
opportunity to defend America in the
Olympiad. Another defeat will tend to
discountenance the record made by Stan
ford in the north, upon which is based
the claim to national prominence.
