# New Candidates Needed for Fifteen
## Coaches Are Training For Olympic Club Contest 
### 
Still handicapped by an insufficient
number of new candidates, Coaches Wy
lic and Carroll have been putting the
rugby fifteen through hard intensive
drills in preparation for Saturday's con
test with the Olympic Club. New com
binations are being formed in the line of
forwards, and every effort is being made
to smooth the teamwork which did not
prove itself up to par against the Bel
tiston Club.
By recouping for its defeat by the
Auzacs at the expense of the club men,
who won over the Davis Farm men
Saturday in the best league game of the
quarter, the "fifteen" hopes to prove its
right to the club title, and increase its
opportunity to defend America in the
Olympiad. Another defeat will tend to
discountenance the record made by Stan
ford in the north, upon which is based
the claim to national prominence.
The two most important games of the
league scheduled for Saturday are the
Olympia-Stanford and Bcliston-Davis
Farm contests. At the former contest, to
be held here, student-tickets will have to
be shown at the gate to gain admittance.
Admission will be charged to outsiders,
with the view of starting a fund to send
the fifteen to Antwerp if the central Cal
ifornia universities are granted the
honor of representing the United States.
The funds procured frofri the Beltiston-
Anzac game will be used for the same
purpose.
Wylie announced yesterday that in
spite of his appeal, enough new material
has not yet answered the call. The
coach stated that he was astonished at

the lack of enthusiasm in the sport, espe
cially at such an important crisis, when
the chance for world representation is
at stake.
