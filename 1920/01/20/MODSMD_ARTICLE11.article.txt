Soccer wins through default, owing
to the non-appearance of the rival
elevens, will soon be a thing of the
past, according to statements made
today by Quinby and Maloney, the
varsity coaches. Both officials are to
attend the meeting of the University
soccer league in San Francisco to
night, and will register strong pro
tests against the action of the tail
end clubs of the league which have
lost heart to the extent of granting
matches by forfeit instead of playing
their schedule. The race for titular
honors centering about three teams,
the Olympic Club, Stanford, and Cali
fornia, has caused a loss of interest
in those elevens which have lost their
chance of championship.
Stanford has increased its lead in
the league to two points, and a third
victory over California, in the Febru
ary game, will clinch a Cardinal cham
pionship. In spite of various upsets
the university soccerites are keeping
in top form, and developing new first
class material by their daily practice.
