### 
Mrs. P. J. Treat, at the first meeting:
of Pan Hellenic yesterday, discussed
Dr. Wilbur's plan of building dormi
tories to house all the women on the
campus. This may take within five or
ten years. Just as soon as the money
can he secured, Dr. Wilbur intends start
ing on his scheme.
The present sorority houses will then
be turned over to the men for fraternity
houses and for eating clubs. The com
mittee of Alumni that visited Dr. Wil
bur reported that it is not personal dis
like for sorority chapters, but rather it
is the sorority houses that Dr. Wilbur
is against. According to the committee,
he expressed a belief that the Univer
sity could take care of the women in
dormitories more satisfactorily than the
present housing conditions, and that it
had always been the sentiment of the
Stanfords to have the women cared for
in this way. Dr. Wilbur has nothing
against the fraternities; in fact, he en
courages an increase of fraternity chap
ters.
