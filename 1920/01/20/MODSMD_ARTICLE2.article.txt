# English Club Will Hold Play Try-Outs
## Cast of 'Rutherford and Sons' Will Be Chosen From the University 
### 
Tryouts tomorrow for the English
Club play will be held at 2 o'clock in
stead of 1, as was previously an
nounced, and will continue until 5.
The English Club, in the production
of plays in the past, has maintained
a high standard of material because
it has not confined itself to picking
its casts from certain dramatic organi
zations but from a broader field.
"Rutherford and Sons" might almost
be called a tragedy. It was produced
in London and in New York with de
cided success, but has never been
produced in the west. Bitha Sowerby,
the author, has givfen a wonderful
picture of factory life in "Rutherford
and Sons." The author lived among
the people of Northcumberland and
her presentation of the North Country
life is intensely realistic. Although
an English play, the cnaracters and
plot have a wide and universal appeal.
"Rutherford and Sons'' will prove a
novelty to the campus.
