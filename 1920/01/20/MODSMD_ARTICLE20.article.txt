# SHELVING YOUR IDEALS
## 
### 
f|IHIS thing of doing as the Romans do may always be carried too far. Indi
* viduality is supremacy, because it implies that you ARE because you
have a right to BE. It means that you passess a thing rare, unusual, and
valuable that every one in the world does not possess.
So much argument is advanced to the effect that university people should
adapt themselves to conditions as they find them, that a great misunder
standing may accrue as to just what this adaptability means. It means
getting acquainted with many personalities so that you may choose and follow
in the footsteps of those whom you most emulate. It does not mean sub
mergance to everyone's particular whim, because the man who could satisfy
all opinions or policies would be peculiar, and not much good in the long
run. Adaptation rather means locating your group and standing by those
ideals which through associations or training you deem most valuable.
At hand we have a suggestion that contains a vivid truth. "Many men
and women enter Michigan with high ideals. Some of these they lose sight
of —at least temporary—because of a conflict with pleasure or something
else that would appear to pay better dividends." False ideals are the only
ones that should be extinguished. Why shelve those attributes of character
which the university will help mold into a sane form of expression? With
out any ideals at all a person is practically a nonentity. Not standing for
anything he might just as well cease to stand.
Ideals cannot be put upon a reserved shelf. They cannot be hunted up to
suit a particular occasion. They either live or they are soon destroyed en
tirely through the process of decay.—Michigan Daily.
