# LAZZARI WINS PRAISE OF MUSIC REVIEWERS
## San Francisco Enthused by Selections of the Noted Contralto 
### 
The recital given by Carolina Lazzari
in San Francisco last Sunday was a
success as can be shown in the criti
cisms of the San Francisco reviewers.
Redfern Mason of the Examiner wrote,
"Like a nymph from a Renaissance
frieze, Carolina Lazzari, singer by the

harmony of divine gifts and human vir
tues, sang herself into the heart of San
Francisco."
Ray C. Brown, of the Chronicle, in
voicing his criticisms, made the state
ment, -"Unless my prophetic intuition is
at fault, the units of that audience will
be happy within a few years to be able
to say that they heard her first San
Francisco recital, for Miss Lazzari will
surely be one of the reigning royalties
in songland. Even now she is a princess
in rank, and the crown awaits only the
hoars of acclamation. Democratic
American though she is, that honor is
one that she can not refuse, unless she
abdicates her talents."
Miss Lazzari will appear at Stanford
University on Wednesday evening. Her
program is composed of numbers which
will probably exhibit to a greater ex
tent the lyric qualities of her voice,
showing the delightfully finished tones
and the easy grace in the lighter forms
of song.
