# English Class Will Give "Neighbors" in Palo Alto
## 
### 
"The Neighbors," a play by 2ona Gale,
will be given by Miss Buckingham's
class in vocal interpretation in the Com
munity Theater in Palo Alto on the
evening of February 3. The play, which
was presented on the campus by the
class in the fall quarter, is unique in
the fact that it has been offered free for
presentation by the author if the pro
ducer will agree to plant a spruce tree
to be used as a community Christmas
tree. It is on account of this provision
that royalties for the presentation of
the play in Palo Alto have been secured.
