"Dairy to Doorstep"
First of a series of educational articles, telling how
milk is handled from "Dairy to your Doorstep."
Milking
Cows are washed daily; given clean food, and
kept in sanitary whitewashed stalls; milkers are
in fresh-laundered uniforms, and are clean in
handling the milk.
The milk is obtained in patent-covered, sanitary
pails, and immediately cooled. After cooling, the
cans of milk (n6t yet two hours old) are rushed
to our downtown store for further processes.
To be continued next Monday.
