## 
### 
According to the Gymnasium Depart
ment, many of the tennis matches in
the interclass tournament have not yet
been played off. These preliminary
matches were supposed to have been fin
ished by the end of last quarter, in order
to allow the second rounds to be started
at once. Miss Elsie Leicester, '20, who
is in charge of the tournament, is very
anxious that all those who have not yet
met their opponents, do so this week, if
possible. Otherwise the games will have
to be forfeited.
