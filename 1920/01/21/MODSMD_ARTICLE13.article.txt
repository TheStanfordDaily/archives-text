# Carolina Lazzari Sings To-night
## Same Selections That Won San Francisco Will Be Rendered Here 
### 
Tonight, Miss Carolina Lazzari, the
leading contralto of the Chicago and
Metropolitan Opera Companies, and
the one selected by Charles P. Wag
ner of New York, as being the one en
dowed for concert association with
Madame Galli-Curci, and John Mc-
Cormack, will appear in concert at
the Assembly Hall.
The singer was educated partly in
New England, but most of her vocal
training was obtained in Milan. Al
though of French rescent, there is
little distinctly French about her art.
Miss Lazzari this evening will give
the same program, with which she
won her way into the hearts of the
San Francisco audience. Of her inter
pretation of Bemberg's "Chanson des
Caisers" Redfern Mason of the Ex
aminer, wrote: "I have rarely heard
anything so perfect as the abandon of
that song."
