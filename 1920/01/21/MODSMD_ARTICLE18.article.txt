# RED CROSS IN WAR AND PEACE IS TOPIC
## Flora L. Bradford Outlines Future of Red Cross 
### 
Red Cross activities in war and in
peace were described by Miss Flora L.
Bradford, secretary for the Nursing
Service of the Pacific Division of the
Red Cross who lectured last evening in
the Little Theater. She took the place
of Dr. W. 11. Richardson of San Fran
cisco who was prevented by "illness, from
giving the talk on "Red Cross First-Aid"
which was announced earlier.
"The* Red Cross will not in any way
diminish its world-wide service because
the war has ended, but with a greater
realization of human suffering gained in
the war will follow in the footsteps of
accident, disease, and starvation intent
on its mission of mercy," said Miss
Bradford. Typhus and small-pox, aug
mented by starvation, arc ravaging
southern Kurope like a plague; Europe
is still suffering from the results of the
war, and accidents are occurring daily
which call for medical aid.
These are examples of the need for or
ganized relief force,' such as the Red
Cross.
The Red Cross of the future will not
lack leadership because of the allegiance
of the returned soldiers who owe life
and health to its service, according to
Miss Bradford.
The program of the Red Cross which
includes Junior Red Cross work through
which the Red Cross of the future is
trained, first-aid, home hygiene, and
care of the sick. Public Health Service
in the rural communities, and dietics,
were explained in detail. Miss Brad
ford concluded her talk with an appeal
for the same support for Red Cross in
peace times that was so willingly given
during the war.
