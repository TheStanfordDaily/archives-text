# RED CROSS IN WAR AND PEACE IS TOPIC
## Flora L. Bradford Outlines Future of Red Cross 
### 
Red Cross activities in war and in
peace were described by Miss Flora L.
Bradford, secretary for the Nursing
Service of the Pacific Division of the
Red Cross who lectured last evening in
the Little Theater. She took the place
of Dr. W. 11. Richardson of San Fran
cisco who was prevented by "illness, from
giving the talk on "Red Cross First-Aid"
which was announced earlier.
"The* Red Cross will not in any way
diminish its world-wide service because
the war has ended, but with a greater
realization of human suffering gained in
the war will follow in the footsteps of
accident, disease, and starvation intent
on its mission of mercy," said Miss
Bradford. Typhus and small-pox, aug
mented by starvation, arc ravaging
southern Kurope like a plague; Europe
is still suffering from the results of the
war, and accidents are occurring daily
which call for medical aid.
