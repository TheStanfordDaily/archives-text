# UNION GETS ANOTHER GIFT FROM ALUMNUS
## An Anonymous Donor Gives $300 to Stanford Union 
### 
The Stanford Union has received a
gift of $300 from an alumnus who
wishes to remain anonymous. This
is the second large monetary gift made
to the Union within the last few
weeks. The donor of the $300 placed
the money in the hands of President
Ray Lyman Wilbur to transmit to the
Board of Directors of the Union with
the provision that it may be used for
whatever purpose the board deems
most desirable. Extensive plans for
gardening around the Union are be
ing considered by the board and these
two girfts make it possible for the
board to carry their ideas into con
sumation.
