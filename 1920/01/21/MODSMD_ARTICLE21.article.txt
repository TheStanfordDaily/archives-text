# TURN OUT
## 
### 
OTANFORD'S basketball varsity meets the University of Nevada tonight at
8 o'clock, on the floor of Encina Gymnasium. We think everyone should
attend this game and really support the basketball men as they deserve. This
more than ever before we owe to them. They are working under dif
ficulties and deserve support. Recently we voted as to whether an award
should be made for the construction of a basketball pavilion, which every
one realizes we need, or whether the award should be made for the con
tinuance of crew. The result, as is well known, favored the crew, not that
we did not wish for the new pavilion or did not care for basketball, but
merely that a majority of students felt that basketball could live without the
award and crew could not. As a result basketball men are not certain as to
just what the sentiment of the Student Body is towards the sport. Show
them tonight that we are back of them to the last degree by a big turnout.
Incidentally it would not be a bad idea to turn out early and boost the fresh
man five.
Along this line we might mention the fact that one of the professors
visiting Stanford this quarter showed an excellent spirit this morning and
one that we would like to see followed out by our regular Stanford professors.
The professor mentioned had an examination scheduled for tomorrow morning
but noted that there was an intercollegiate game tonight, and consequently
postponed the examination to a later date. This was probably done with
little inconvenience to him but was a splendid thing from the standpoint of
the students. Who knows but what such actions as these account for the
splendid basketball fives turned out by one of the Northern Universities.
