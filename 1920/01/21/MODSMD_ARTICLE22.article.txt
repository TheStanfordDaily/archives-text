1 COMMNUNICATION was received by us yesterday but to which only the
" signature "An Indignant Student" was affixed. Obviously we can not pub
lish communications unless we know the writer. It is not ncessary that the
name be published but merely we at least know who the writer is. The
editor would like to have "An Indignant Student" get in touch with him as
soon as possible.
