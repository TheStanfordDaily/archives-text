A course of Thursday afternoon lec

being given in San Jose by Professor
H. D. Gray of the English department.
In connection with this series of
lectures Dr. Gray is interested in estab
lishing in San Jose a Committee for
Better Films. He has for some time
been active in promoting the Better
Film movement and is the organizer
of committees throughout the state.

He has already established such a
committee in San Francisco and one
in Palo Alto, of which Mrs. Herbert
C. Hoover is chairman.
The movement is a national one
with headquarters in New York. The
purpose of the committees is, like the
Drama League, not to censor moving
pictures, but to call attention to good
films and to make no mention of un
desirable ones. The committee posts
each week notices of films which can
be safely recommended. Professor
Gray plans to go to New York in the
spring, where he will consult with
the National Committee.
