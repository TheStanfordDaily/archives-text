# SOCCER MEN READY FOR OLYMPIC CLUB
## 
### 
After two weeks without a game, the
Stanford soccer eleven, strong in newly
discovered talent and smooth through
constant practice, is ready for its game
with the Olympic Club men on Saturday.
The San Franciscans are determined to
annex the soccer championship together
with the rughy honors. By winning over
Stanford the race for league honors will
be practically even between California,
Stanford, and the winged 'O."
Both McSkilling and Weller, who
were to have taken part in their first
varsity game against the Chinese "Y"
last week, will probably be given a
chance to show their wares by Quinby,
the Cardinal pilot.
The game will be played as a "curtain
raiser" for the Olympic Stanford rugby
game if arrangements can be completed
to get the club men here early enough on
Saturday.
More Tryouts for
Play Announced
Additional tryouts for any new mate
rial wishing to comf out for the English
Club play, "Rutherford & Son," will be
held at 2 p. rti. tomorrow in the Assem
blv hall.
