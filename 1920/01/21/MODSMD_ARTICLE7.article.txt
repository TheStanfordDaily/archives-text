# UNIVERSITY MATMEN READY TO COMPETE
## 
### 
Coach P. V. McCullough, in charge of
the University matmen, said today that
preparations are now under way for the
first practice wrestling contests. With a
greater number of candidates out for the
sport than ever before, the prospects for
a first-class team art- unusually good.
More than fifty men have turned out for
the varsity teams, and are already round
ing into form, thanks to hard daily work
outs.
Plans for the first intercollegiate meet
are still indefinite, hut the coach expects
to give a performance for the benefit of
the student body in the near future.
