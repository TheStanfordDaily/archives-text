# STANFORD WILL MEET NEVADA WITH NEW COMBINATION
## CLOSE GAME EXPECTED Varsity Quintet Will Play Fourth League Game Tonight 
### 
OTANFORD will meet the Nevada
quintet tonight with a shift in the
Varsity line-up. This fourth game of
the California-Nevada series will be
played immediately following the
freshman-Palo Alto contest, which will
be called at 7 o'clock. An admission
of twenty-five cents will be charged
all those not holding registration tick
ets.
Evans is planning to start Carver
at center, with Righter and Mills at
forwards. Captain Pelouze and Austin
will start the game at the guard po
sitions.
Last year Stanford easily defeated
the team from Reno, but this season
Nevada is appearing with a much
stronger aggregation. They were the
victors of a game against the fast St.
Mary's team, last Tuesday night, on
Oakland College court, and will give
the Cardinal varsity a hard fight for
the game tonight.
The Palo Alto high school team
should be an easy win for the "frosh,"
since the babes defeated them 40 to
5 last week.
