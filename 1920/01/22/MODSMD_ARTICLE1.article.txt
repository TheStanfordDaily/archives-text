# STANFORD FIVE LOSES TO NEVADA IN THE SECOND HALF
## PILES UP 29 TO 16 SCORE IN FAST GAME Stanford Leads in First Period Big Crowd Sees Game 
### 
IVTEVADA, with a fast came-back in
the last half, won from the Cardinal
quintet last night, by fi score of 25 to
19, on the Encina gymnasium court.
Victory seemed in sight for the
Stanford team during the first part
of the game, the first half ending
with a score of 14 to 6. But in the
second period of play the Reno team
outplayed their opponents with their
clever teamwork. Several times they
would slip some man through the
Stanford defense unguarded, who then
would drop the ball in the basket for
two points.
The defense did not show itself as
weak as the Stanford offense. The
men appeared unable to hit the basket.
Finding it impossible to make goals
under the basket the men resorted to
long shots, but with no success. Mills
and Righter were Stanford's only
point-winners. Righter threw four
field goals, and Mills threw two, and
seven foul shots.
Both squads put up a strong fight
throughout the game, and during the
last ten minutes of play it .vas either
team's game. The score kept even
until the last two minutes of play
when Nevada scored two more field
goals and a foul shot, and then held
their lead until the whistle blew.
The spectators, numbering about
five hundred, were forced to entertain
themselves with songs and yells during
a period of thirty-five minutes of dark
ness. After the ball had been in play
for four minutes the light in the gym
nasium went out because of the storm
in the mountains. This proved a hard
ship on both teams, since they had to
follow rules and remain inside of the
basketball court. It proved, however,
to be an excellent impromptu rally for
Stanford songs.

follow rules and remain inside of the
basketball court. It proved, however,
to be an excellent impromptu rally for
Stanford songs.
