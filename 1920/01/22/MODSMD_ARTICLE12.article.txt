### 
Unable to establish a quorum, on
account of the absences of California,
the chief plaignant against Olympic
Club, on the grounds of usingg "ring
ers" in a recent game, the University
Soccer League was unable to take up
its official business, and its meeting
last night devolved into an informal
discussion of the soccer situation and
the future plans of the league.
The Olympic Club determined to
play its game with Stanford here on
on Saturday, as a preliminary to the
winged "0"-Stanford rugby game. The
game will be called at 2:00 sharp, and
should be one of the hardest matches
of the quarter.
Coaches Quinby and Maloney will
