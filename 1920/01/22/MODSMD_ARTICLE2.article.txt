M. S. C. To have a Student Body car-
had an opera company surrounding her.
But, she did not need the company to
portray her winning qualities. In her
"Aria: Lieti Signor from 'Gli TJgnotti,'"
her interpretation, revealing her genu
ine dramatic splendor and forcefulness,
was indeed flawless.
Of her French songs very little need
he said. She is of French descent, and
equally gracious with the songs of
France as with those of her own coun
try. America.
Miss Lazzari was very liberal with
her encores, among which were two well
known to many—"Mighty Lak a Rose"
and"The Rosary." One may tire of
these when sung by amateurs, but when
sung by a woman with such deep pathos
and feeling, they yield the greatest
amount of pleasure.
Miss Blanche Barbot, her accompanist,
was also an artist, playing her accom
paniments with finished technique and
beautiful resonant tones. When Miss
Lazzari was singing "Roadways," the
light went out, but Miss Barbot con
tinued playing with absolute case, and
the number was not affected in (he least.
