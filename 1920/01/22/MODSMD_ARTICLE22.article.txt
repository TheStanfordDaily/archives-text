# TIRESOME READING
## 
### 
THIS is tiresome reading. However, it is just about as tiresome to write
so at that you haven't anything on us. Urging people to vote becomes
monotonous but it is necessary nevertheless. The facts of the case, however,
are that the point has been reached where Stanford men are either going
to make student control work or let it fail. Tomorrow on the Quad we will
have the opportunity of selecting three men to fill the existing vacancies on
the Men's Council for Student Control, and it is up to us individually and
collectively to vote, and vote for good men.
You may not believe in student control. That is, neither here nor there,
and it is no time for arguing it. We have Student Control and should give
it an opportunity to work. Personally we feel that student control is by far
the most satisfactory system for governing students, but to make it work,
suitable men must be elected to enforce the rules. At present, it is on trial
and to really give it a fair trial good men must be elected tomorrow. There
can be no question about the existence of their job. It is there and a good
rigid one, too. Fortunately there have been sufficient nominations for the
election tomorrow to really make good selection possible. See to it that we
do our part and cast our ballots. All men with five quarters of University
standing are eligible to vote, this being interpreted to mean seventy-five units.
An amendment to the Associated Student Constitution will also be voted
upon tomorrow. The purpose of this amendment is to give the students better
representation upon the Board of Athletic Control. It provides that the presi
dent of the Associated Students shall automatically become a member of the
Board, and that the other two student members to the Board shall be elected
by the student body at large.
Under the present arrangement, the President of the Associated Students,
the Student Manager and the captain of the major sport in season constitute
the student representatives of the Board of Athletic Control. The proposed
amendment will make the Student Manager merely an ex-officio member of
the Board with no power to vote. This is as it should be for it seems a
wrong principle for the manager to be both an employee of the Board and a
member of it. The captain of the major sport in season changes too often
for efficiency. The new amendment will remedy these conditions. Vote
for it.
