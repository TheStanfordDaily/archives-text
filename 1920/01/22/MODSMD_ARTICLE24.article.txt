# STRENGTHEN TEAM FOR OLYMPIAD, SAYS LETTER
## Rugby Man Says Stanford Must Double Its Strength 
### 
Another sidelight on the "Stanford to
Antwerp" drive was brought to light to
day in a letter from Secretary Wood
ward of the Vancouver Rugby Union to
Dr. A. D. Browne.
Woodward praised the work of the
fifteen in its northern games, and dis
cussed the possibility of a Stanford rep
resentation in the Olympiad. Even
though the team is a strong one, in his
opinion, it will want doubling in strength
to insure a good showing in the games.
He states further:
"Hayes, Tilden, and Righter, the lat
ter particularly, were the outstanding
men in your pack, while Mohr and Dan
Carroll were fine in their inside positions
and Kirksey took a tremendous amount
of stopping on the occasions he got any
openings.
"But, and this is said with a somewhat
extensive knowledge of the subject, the
strength of the team would want dou
bling if they are to go to Antwerp and
meet other national sides at the Olym
pic contests."
Woodward's opinion shows how im
portant preparations for an opportunity
to compete in the overseas event are,
and what the coaches still have to ac
complish before there is any assurance
of success.
