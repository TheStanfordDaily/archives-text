# L.C. ROGERS IS MADE COACH OF VARSITY EIGHT
## NINETY SIGN FOR CREW Preliminary Training Begins For Large Squad of Candidates 
### 
L. C. Rogers, '17, was appointed crew
coach for this year, at a meeting of
the Board of Athletic Control, last
night. Rogers is a veteran of three
victorious Stanford crews, rowing No.
6 and No. 4. He was a member of
the 1915 crew that rowed the Cardinal
colors into second place at the inter
collegiate regatta at Poughkeepsie.
Nearly ninety men have signed up
for early season crew work and from
this abundance of first class material,
Captain Davis is confident of strong
varsity and freshman squads. Beside
Davis, three of last year's varsity,
Cary, McGillivray and Wilbur are
working out. All of last year's fresh
man crew, with the exception of Han
cock, are out for the varsity.
Prliminary practice, consisting most
ly of wind gaining exercises, com
menced at the boathouse Monday,
under the direction of varsity rowers.
Some sixty freshmen reported as can
didates for the '23 crew.
The athletic surplus voted by the
associated students has given crew
work an added impetus this season as
many of the facilities needed for a
long time will soon become realities.
