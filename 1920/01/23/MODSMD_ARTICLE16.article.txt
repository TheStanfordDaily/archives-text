# CAMPUS ENTERTAINED BY SYMPHONY CONCERT
## Famous Numbers Rendered to Charmed Stanford Audience 
### Miss Adelheid Saier, '22 
To believe that Bach, who Is usually
considered purely technical, could be
played as pleasingly and beautifully that
the audience would applaud that number
more than others on the program, sounds
like a fairy tale. But this was the case
last night when Louis Persinger and
Arthur Argiewicz, at the San Francisco
Symphony Orchestra Concert, played
Bach's "Concerto for Two Violins, in D.
Minor." Perhaps it was the playing of
the soloists, who during the entire num
ber seemed endowed with true inspira
tion. The accompaniment as played by
the rest of the orchestra was exquisite.
The "Symphony Pathetique" appealed
to many as the best and most effective
number on the program, for in it the
entire orchestra was playing to the full
extent of its ability and there was a
great deal of variation. The movements
most appealing last evening were the
'Allegro Vivoce" of the first part and
the third part. At the beginning of a
concert the audience is apt to feel that
music is to lull the soul into peace and
restfulness; but when the fortissimo
chord was struck at the beginning of the
"Allegro Vivoce," every one was aroused
—there was a thrill, as of electricity, to
fill every one with vivacity, which lasted
until the end of the program. The third
part appealed to the audience because
it was heavy and voluminous, and they
seemed in a mood for such music.
Conductor Herz ended his program
as usual with "The Star-Spangled Ban
ner," played as only an orchestra of per
fect training could—g'ving an enthusias
tic, energetic stimulant to the audience
as a parting inspiration.
