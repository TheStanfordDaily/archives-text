# A 						GREAT NEED

"DERHAPS greater than ever before In the history of our country is the need.
" for men who think and who, possessed of a sound general education, are
able to give expression to their thoughts in such a manner that others may
profit by them. We begin in youth to accumulate a great mass of facts and
later our training at public school, especially those in rural districts, is un
fortunately not of a nature which taxes our powers of reason.
If then we are to acquire this habit of thought it must be at the uni
versity. This should be ever before us. Perhaps classics occupy our atten
tion and after a time a grasp of Greek and Latin is obtained. We gradually
learn to appreciate language but if we are to benefit to the full extent we
must go a step further. We must see behind its beauty of phraseology, a
civilization which inspired the author to write such lines. Perchance art
interests us. A' few years of study will enable us to identify the world's
greatest masterpieces but unless we have learned to picture what was in the
mind of the master when he sat down before his easel we have profited
little by our work. We conclude then that education is not a measure of
what we actually know about a subject but it implies something more, a
process involving vision and reason.
If we as university students are to do things worth while we must not
be mere sponges for the reception of facts but we must submit them to the
process of season, secondly correlate them, and last of all employ them as
an aid in the conception of new ideas, the result of logical thought. From
this view our studies are worth while and the result must be a beneficial
one not only to ourselves but to civilization.â€”McGill Daily.
