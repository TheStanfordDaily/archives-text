# WORKS OF BONNET PLAYED AT RECITAL
## 
### 
Purity and strength characterized the
works of Joseph Bonnet, played at the
organ recital yesterday afternoon by
Warren D. Allen, in the Memorial
Church. The most impressive of the
numbers was the "Variations de Con
cert." Alternating between the power
ful first theme, and a minor air of great
beauty, with the counterpoint giving the
the effect of an antiphonal, it devel
oped into the final theme suggestive of
a storm with rolling thunder, wind, and
rain.
"Ariel," composed after a reading of
Shakespeare, is of lighter quality as the
title indicates. It is a lively melody,
with a mischievous strain, though a bit
heavy for so ethereal a creature as
Shakespeare's Ariel.
Another of the heavier works was the

"Caprice Heroique." Opening with a
melody of high, sweet tones, anticipatory
of the noble processional that followed,
a stately composition with a strongly
marked rhythm in the following cad
ences.
The most appealing number on the
program was the "Romance Sans Pa
roles." The repetition of the haunting
melody and the effective use of the echo
organ made it a composition of delicate
beauty and appealing <*harm.
The program will be repeated Sunday
afternoon at four o'clock, with the addi
tion of two solos by Mr. Harry Robert
son, tenor, "The Procession," by Caesar
Franck, and "Santa Maria," by Faure.
