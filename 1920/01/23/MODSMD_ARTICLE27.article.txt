# ART EXHIBITION OF WATER COLORS EXCITES COMMENT
## 
### 
The water color exhibition at the
Stanford Art Gallery reveals two
prominent features to the many
guests. One was that the collection is
one of the best exhibitions ever shown
in the west and the other feature is
that without exception Stanford con
tains the best art gallery on the Pa
cific Coast for showing paintings either
by the artificial light or by daylight.
The collection consists of 128 water
colors, pastels and charcoal drawings,
made by the members of the Amer
ican water color society, an organiza
tion composed of the best talent of
the eastern states. This exhibition
has been made possible in the west
by the American federation of art, an
organization in Washington, D. C.,
created for the purpose of fostering
and disseminating good art. So great
has its activities become that its mem
bership includes practically every art
organization of the United States.
Through the munifience of wealthy
American benefactors the federation is
able to assemble and send to even
isolated districts the best of art.
Stanford University as a member
of the federation will receive from
time to time other collections to show
at the, art gallery.
The present collection includes rep
resentative work of various schools
or periods that have marked the his
tory of watercolor.
Some subjects like the one entitled
"An evening with shakespeare," by
Claude Hirst, represents the work of
detailists where the artist has sought
to convey every part and shade of
the subject. This fidelity and con
centration has an important and
necessary part in the development of
American painting and we find much
of the best of American art to have
been produced during this era.
Those who work in the other ex
treme or the ultra-modernists are

happily missing in the collection.-
Their work undoubtedly is merely in
its formative stages and why should
incomplete and weird experiments be
displayed as completed productions?
Among those who have painted in
bold and direct color and whose work
can be found on the walls of the gal
lery, are the names of Mahomi Young,
Roth, Litchfield, George O. Hart, H.
Giles, and Gilford Beal.
The picture by George O. Hart,
"Market in Trinidad," is remarkable
for its rapid, abbreviated technique,
creating at a few feet's distance a
complete outdoor scene. Excellent
draughtsmanship and confidence in
every stroke is required to enable an
artist to complete such a production.
Paul Dougherty, the eastern artist,
famous for his oil paintings of marine
views, is represented by a marine
scene painted at Point Lobos in Cali
fornia, during one of his summer trips.
On the same wall is a sparkling wave
picture by Arthur Beaumont.
A group of decorative water colors
are among the collection. These are
by Lief Mandross, Norwood MacGil
vray, Frances Comstock, Harry Hoff
man, Lucy Hurry and others.
Two fine portrait studies are shown
among the pastels. The one entitled,
"Pomona," a modern Eve, gayly hold
ing a bowl of tempting apples is sure
to hold the attention of every visitor.
Near it is a study entitled "Firelight,"
in which the subtle glow of the firefly
is charmingly patterned on the fea
tures of a young lady.
The collection of black and white
studies by Thornton Oakley made
from views of shipbuilding activities
on Hog Island for the government,
present a collection of excellently com
posed subjects. These were used for
publicity work by the United States
shipping board during the war.
