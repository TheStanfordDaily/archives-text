# Kansas Students Make Aeroplane Sled
## 
### 
The engineers of the Kansas State
Agricultural College have made a new
snow sled. It is an aeroplane sled
that will make fifty miles per hour on
snow or ice. The sled has been built
in the shops by the shop practice
students. A high speed automobile
motor has been installed and the wood
working department is building the
five and one-half foot aeroplane pro
peller that will pull the sled.
