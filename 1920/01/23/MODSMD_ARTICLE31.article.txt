Editor, Daily Palo Alto, Stanford
University, Cal. Dear Sir:â€”Your is
sue yesterday stated that I had estab
lished the Committee for Better Films
in Palo Alto "of which Mrs. Herbert
C. Hoover is Chairman." Mrs. Theo
dore Hoover is the chairman of that
committee, and it was she who estab
lished it.
Please permit me to take this op
portunity, however, of saying that I
am interested in organizing commit
tees which direct the movement for
better films; and that I should be glad
to confer with students who wish to
see such committees established in
their home towns. I am authorized by
the National Committee to organize
affiliatd committees in any city of Cali
fornia where I find a group of people
who are sufficiently interested to in
sist that the best available films shall
be shown in their local theaters and
the bringing of objectionable pictures
discouraged. Very truly yours,
H. D. GRAY.
