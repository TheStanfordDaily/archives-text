# "RUTHERFORD AND SON" WILL HAVE DAVIS AS COACH
## 
### 
Gordon Davis '18 will coacti the Eng
lish Cluh play, it was officially an
nounced today. Although the recent
tryouts have been held under the direc
tion of Davis, it had not as yet been
decided whether he would be able to do
the work or not. Davis is admirably
fitted to undertake the production of the
play, "Rutherford & Son." He played
the big part in "Justice," given four
years ago, and as "Rutherford & Son"
is the most ambitious piece of work since
that time, Davis' experience will do
much toward making the play a success.
Tryouts were held Wednesday and
yesterday, but as yet no decision has been
made in regard to the cast. The com
mittee and Coach Davis are anxious that
any students who have not turned out so
far would do so at 9 a m., tomorrow
morning in the Assembly Hall. The
final selection of the cast will probably
be made at that time.
So far, considerable material lias
turned out and there are several pros
pects for the heavier parts. Because
of the peculiar realism of the play, the
cast will be unusually difficult to pick
on account of the mature parts. Only
eight characters in the entire play
but every person in the cast will be
given a chance to show his ability.
