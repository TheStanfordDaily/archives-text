"Dairy to Doorstep"
or How We Handle Milk
CLARIFYING
(BRIEF SYNOPSIS OF PRECEDING ARTICLES)
(Cows are washed daily and given clean food.
Stalls are sprayed and painted with disinfectant
liquids, milk is obtained in sanitary patent-cover
milk pails, in which it is immediately cooled, and
rushed to our downtown store.)
When the milk is received at the store, it is
weighed, and poured into a covered tank. The
milk is then pumped into the CLARIFIER.
This Clarifier is a large, rapidly revolving drum,
and is of the newest pattern —a large improve
ment over old-style straining.
The centrifugal force of this machine throws
out any foreign matter which may be in the milk.
This is merely a precautionary measure and is not
absolutely necessary; but to insure absolute clean
liness in our milk, we use it.
