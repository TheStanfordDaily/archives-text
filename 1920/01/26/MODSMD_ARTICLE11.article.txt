# Plans Under Way For Construction of New Pavilion
## 
### 
Plans for the erection of a basketball
pavilion in the near future are under
consideration by a committee composed
of Dr. A. D. Browne and E. R. Caughey
'18, which was appointed at the last
meeting of the Board of Athletic Con
trol. The preference given crew in the
recent student body vote will not stand
in the way of the building of the pa
vilion.
Need for adequate facilities for hand
ling the overflow of athletic activities, de
clares the physical director, makes this
step imperative. Not only will basket
ball games be staged, but boxing and
wrestling activities will be handled in
the proposed building.
Bleachers with a capacity of 2,500 will
surround the pavilion's floor. The com
mittee has been instructed to report the
plans for the building agreed upon to
the Board of Control within the next
month.
