# "HELLO"
## 
### 
IVEMOCRACY is and has always been an essential characteristic of this
community. It is the thing which makes us a large family and which
brings everyone into a unified group. Without this democratic attitude Stan
ford- simply would not be Stanford. So ingrained is this democracy in all
undergraduates and also graduates that it is impossible to think of Stan
ford without it.
Among other things that we have always taken pride in is the fact that
every student speaks to every other student whether he knows him by name
or not. This is one of the really worth-while traditions that we have here
and we can think of no better evidence of democracy than to hear students
exchange friendly "hello" as they pass. Visitors to the campus have often
been surprised at this cordial greeting, especially when students have said
"hello" to them the same as to any one else. We have never heard anything
but favorable comment either on this democratic spirit.
Recently though there has been a tendency towards forgetting this custom.
Especially among the freshmen has this been true; but they are not the only
ones falling down in this respect.
And if the greeting has been exchanged it is sort of lialf-liearted "hello"
that is returned. Apparently the full significance of the expression has not
dawned on some of us. However, it is not too late yet, and we can all get
into the habit. This democratic spirit has a world of influence and should
be encouraged.#
