# OLYMPIC CLUB WINS FAST SOCCER MATCH
## Stanford Ties With Olympic Players for Lead in League 
### 
In the fastest and most scientific
match of the year, the varsity soccer
ites were beaten by the Olympic Club
eleven on Saturday afternoon. Wash
eur, crack Sunday league player, made
the only score of the game, late in
the last half.
Stanford put its strongest team of
the season on the field. The clubmen
brought with them the best soccer
players in San Francisco, regardless
of league. Their team was even
stronger than that which won from
California a short time ago.
The ball spent most of its time in
mid-field, the kicking of both backs
sending it out of danger. Newlands
featured for the varsity at goal, stop
ping difficult shots from every angle.
Jim Quinby played a clean hard
game, breaking the Olympic attack.
Robinson booted the ball from uni
versity territory whenever the club
forwards dribbled it close to the goal.
Weller, playing his first game for
Stanford, exhibited enough speed and
skill to win himself a permanent po
sition.
Stanford and the Olympic Club are
now tied for the lead in the University
Soccer League, and a game will be
arranged to decide first place in the
near future.
