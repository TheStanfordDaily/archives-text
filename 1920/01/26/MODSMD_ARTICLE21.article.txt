# Dartmouth Plans Gay Winter
## 
### 
Final plans for the big Dartmouth
Whiter Carnival are getting into shape.
The main events that have taken place
for the past years will be featured
again this year. A more prominent
position, however, will be occupied by
the intercollegiate ski and snowshoe
meets on account of the great number
of cr.uies from other colleges. The
dates set for the carnival are Febru
ary 12 to 14, during which time a
dramatic production, musical club con
i cert, basketball game with Penn,
1 hockey game and innumerable dances
I will be staged.
