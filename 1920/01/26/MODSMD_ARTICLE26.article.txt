nearby University buildings. The mate
rial for this wall will be obtained from
the stones salvaged from the library and
mens' gymnasium buildings destroyed in
1906.
The bunkhouse and big storage barn
will be torn down next. The bunk
house was moved from the old trotting
farm and has been used as living quar
ters for some of the University labor
ers, although recently practically all the
men who have been permanently on the
payrolls as laborers have been married
and have lived with their families in
nearby towns. The bunk house has been
a shelter for transient laborers who have
stayed at the University for compara
tively short times. The labor force is
now comparatively small,

These two buildings are the largest
structures on the women's athletic fields
area. The junk now stored there will be
sold for what it will bring, and all the
sheds and small storage buildings will
be cleared away. As soon as possible
all the lumber and building materials
now stored in various places will be
brought inside the Corporation Yard,
and the women's athletic fields area will
then be in shape for development.
The big solidly built residence barn
now being torn down housed the fine
horses and carriages of the Stanfords
for years before the University was
founded. When the Corporation Yard
was built several years ago in the inter
est of economy in centering all upkeep
activities in one central place the big
barn was moved nearly a mile cross-lots
to the site from which it is now being
torn down.
