# Cardinal Ruggers Win from Olympics
## Speedy Tries in Last Period Score Brilliant Victory 
### 
With a burst of speed and team
work in th last ten minutes of play,
the Stanford rugby fifteen forged
ahead of the liard-fighting Olympic
Club team, and scored the only two
tries of the game.
Neither side had the advantage dur
ing the first half of the contest. With
Smitherun to bolster it, the Cardinal
forward line braced against the club
attack, but was weak in offense. The
winged "O" players crushed every
attempted get-away, but were them
selves stopped time and again by the
clever tackling of the varsity backs.
It was only aiker condition told on
the clubmen that the Stanford rushes
begau to gain ground. Wylie had
formed a strong back-field combina
tion in the persons of Kirksey, Carroll,
Patrick, Foster, and Wark, and with
ten minutes to go, Foster swept over
a corner of the Olympic goal-line for
the fiirst score of the game.
The angle was difficult, and Patrick
failed to convert. He carried the ball
over for the second try within the
next three minutes, converting his own
score.
The clubmen fought hard during the
remaining moments, but the university
goal-line was not threatened, and the
final score remained 8 to 0.
Coach Maloney is attempting to se

build, will continue work on his for
ward line for the next few days.
