### 
Tryouts for the intercollegiate rifle
contests will commence next week,
Captain S. M. Parker announced to
day. The tryouts will consist of the
shooting of a series of record scores.
The first match of the competition
will begin the week ending February
14, when all the colleges will tele
graph the results of the initial contest
to Washington, for a percentage com
parison of scores.
A team of ten men from a squad of
twenty will be selected by the military
instructor to represent Stanford. No
squad member, declares Captain Park

sition throughout the season. The
team will be selected weekly on the
basis of shooting ability shown by
comparison of the rifle score cards.
Bronze medals will be awarded the
champion team of the state at the
conclusion of the schedule. A special
bronze figure given by the Columbia
University Rifle Team will become the
permanent possession of the college
winning the greatest number of con
tests in the next ten years.
