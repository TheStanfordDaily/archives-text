(Cows are washed daily and given clean food. Stalls are sprayed
and painted with disinfectant liquids, milk is obtained in sanitary
patent-cover milk pails, in which it is immediately cooled, and rushed

cooler, where it is held at 38 degrees for 20 min
utes. This process is the most important one in
milk distribution. Any germs, if existing are thus
killed. No danger of catching tuberculosis, scarlet
