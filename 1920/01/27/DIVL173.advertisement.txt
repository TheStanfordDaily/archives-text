Oriental Turkish tobacco charmed
the natives hundreds of years ago.
And when travelers visited the Orient, a new delight
awaited and thrilled them —in smoking Turkish cigarettes.
The tobacco in Murad is 100"o Turkish and is
gathered from those famous lands —and Murads are both
charming and thrilling.
p I rue they are a little more expensive than ordinary
i cigarettes—but oh, such a difference!
"Judge for yourself—!"
