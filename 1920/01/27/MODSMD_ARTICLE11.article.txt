# PRESIDENT OUTLINES HOUSING POLICY
## Report Urges Trustees to Hasten Dormitory Building 
### 
RETAILS of the policy of Stanford University to assume direct jurisdiction
over the living facilities on the campus are made public in a partial
analysis of the forth-coming annual report of President Ray Lyman Wilbur,
given out at the President's office today.
The policy, which had its inception in the Founding Grant and which
was reiterated in a resolution passed by the Board of Trustees on April 26.
1907, and again in a resolution of the Board in March, 1919, is to eliminate
fraternity and sorority houses entirely, replacing them with dormitories
under the immediate management and supervision of the University.
Right To Organize Not Essential
President Wilbur's report urges that "additional dormitories and dining
halls be supplied as promptly as possible," by the Trustees. He sets forth
that the right of students "to organize along lines of natural choice and
cleavage is not a part of the question"; the question, on the other hand,
being "the carrying on by them of a housing function properly belonging to
the University."
Excerpts from the report were given out because of the present interest
in the subject, the President says. The part of the report made public today
is as follows:
Senator Stanford Planned Encina
Senator Stanford in constructing the first buildings for the University
planned to house and care for all of the entering students. Encina Hall was
largely constructed by day labor under his special supervision and on the
pattern of a building in Switzerland which had particularly attracted his at
tention. Roble Hall, now Squoia Hall, was hurriedly built of reinforced con
crete to prepare for the women who were seeking admission. Because of
the time required, the foundations laid for a larger building—similar to
Encina Hall —were temporarily abandoned, and have never been used. The
influx of students was greater than expected and because of the early death
of the Senator, with the subsequent financial difficulties, the growth of
dormitories did not keep pace with the enlarging student body. Nevertheless
the foundation principle of Senator Stanford was and still is sound: i.e., all
students should be housed and fed in suitable buildings owned and controlled
by the University. In so far as circumstances have compelled departure from
this plan have we developed problems associated with the physical well-being
and conduct of our students. I wish to urge upon you the responsibility of
the University to see that additional dormitories and dining halls are sup
plied as promptly as possible. With a student body limited in numbers
there is every reason to provide such facilities for all who enter, so that the
most favorable conditions for the growth of a loyal democratic and closely
knit student group may prevail.
Fraternities
Inevitable
The growth of the fraternity-house
system upon the campus has been the in
evitable result of the failure or inability
of the University to meet the housing
needs of the students. Independent
groups with national affiliations occupy
ing houses owned by them upon Uni
versity property and carrying out a func
tion properly belonging to the University
naturally do not merge into the full life
of the University. Stanford is not
unique in this respect, but it has a
greater opportunity than most other in
stitutions to meet this problem on its
merits and not continue to deal with it
on the basis of the past, which has been
largely that of expediency. The right
lof students to organize along lines of
natural choice and cleavage is not a part
of the question, which is the carrying on
by them of a housing function properly
belonging to the University. It is prob
ably inevitable that secret fraternities
will continue to exist in human society,
and if they are conducted at Stanford
so as to be consistent with the Found
ing Grant, which specifies:
"The University has been endowed
with a view of offering instruction free,
or nearly free, that it may resist the
tendency to the stratification of society,
by keeping open an avenue whereby the
deserving and exceptional may rise
through their own efforts from the low
est to the highest stations of life. A
spirit of equality must accordingly be
maintained within the University. To
this end it shall be the duty of the Uni
versity authorities to prohibit excessive
expenditures and other excesses on the
part of the students, and the formation
or growth of any organization, custom,
or social function that tends to the de
velopment of exclusive or undemocratic
castes within the University, and to ex
clude from the institution any one whose
conduct is inconsistent with the spirit
of the foundation."
—there need be no occasion to interfere
with them.
Trustees
Take Steps
Certain steps have been taken by the
Board of Trustees toward a settlement
of the housing question which has gradu
ally reached its present untenable posi
tion.
Under the date of April 26, 1907, the
following resolution was passed by the
Board of Trustees:
"RESOLVED, That it is the sense of
the Committee on Student Affairs that
the promiscuous mingling of fraternity
and sorority houses on the University
campus is not for the best interests of
the University community, and that it is
desirable, where possible, in the assign
ment of building site* m the new sub
divisions, that close proximity of frater
nity and sorority houses should be avoid
ed ; and that it is especially undesirable
that any sorority should be located at
a relatively remote point in the campus
community with only fraternities for im
mediate neighbors."
With the construction of the first units
of the new Roble Hall, capable of hous
ing nearly one-half ot the University
women on a part of the campus near
Lagunita and adjacent to the women's
gymnasium, and swimming pool and to
the projected athletic grounds for wom
en, the chance to clear up the whole sit
uation, as far as the women are con
cerned. is evident, 'ine completion of
these dormitory facilities will permit the
housing iiV University buildings of all
of those women students not living at
home. The existing sorority houses can
then be purchased under the resolution
of the board under dare of March 28,
1919, to-wit:
It was resolved, under date of January
.31, 1919, that the Board of Trustees pur
chase such fraternity and sorority houses
at the University as may be offered to
it at properly appraised valuation, but
do not and will not assume any financial
obligations of any fraternity or sorority;
that any agreements 10 permit building
or leasing sorority or fraternity houses
be accompanied by sucn restrictions as
to conditions under which they shall be
operated as may be recommended by the
President of the University, and approv
ed by this Board; that pursuant to rec
ommendation presented by the President
of the University, any agreement here
after made for the building or leasing of
houses for fraternity or sorority pur
poses contain a clause that suitable quar
ters be provided for a matron therein,
and that each fraternity or sorority shall
employ, and continue to employ, a ma
tron satisfactory to the University au
thorities, said matron to live in the
house; and further, resolved, that any
houses hereafter built by fraternities or
sororities in accordance with this reso
lution shall revert at the expiration or
sooner termination of the leasehold to
the University without cost.
If this is done the women will be well
cared for on a University basis, and ad
ditional University buildings will be
available for men.
Grouping
Urged
As rapidly as possible the buildings
for men should be grouped together in
the area bounded by Alvarado, Lasuen,
and Arguello Streets, or about the east
ern Quadrangle and Lncma Hall. En
larged dining facilities, both for large
groups and possibly for dining clubs,
should be constructed in this area, pref
erably near the Stanford Union. This
will give a solidarity to the men of the
student body that is impossible now with
the scattered groups in existence.
I wotdd urge also that for the most
part the houses of the professors be built
outside the area specified and that the
original cottages in this area be not re
placed as they deteriorate.
It will take time to work out this plan;
but it is important that every step taken
should lead towards the final solution.
All student rooms should be properly
lighted, ventilated, and heated, and ex
pert supervision should be provided for
all dining halls. These latter can not be
conducted properly at a profit.
