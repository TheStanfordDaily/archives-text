# PRESIDENT OUTLINES HOUSING POLICY
## Report Urges Trustees to Hasten Dormitory Building 
### 
RETAILS of the policy of Stanford University to assume direct jurisdiction
over the living facilities on the campus are made public in a partial
analysis of the forth-coming annual report of President Ray Lyman Wilbur,
given out at the President's office today.
The policy, which had its inception in the Founding Grant and which
was reiterated in a resolution passed by the Board of Trustees on April 26.
1907, and again in a resolution of the Board in March, 1919, is to eliminate
fraternity and sorority houses entirely, replacing them with dormitories
under the immediate management and supervision of the University.
Right To Organize Not Essential
President Wilbur's report urges that "additional dormitories and dining
halls be supplied as promptly as possible," by the Trustees. He sets forth
that the right of students "to organize along lines of natural choice and
cleavage is not a part of the question"; the question, on the other hand,
being "the carrying on by them of a housing function properly belonging to
the University."
Excerpts from the report were given out because of the present interest
in the subject, the President says. The part of the report made public today
is as follows:
Senator Stanford Planned Encina
Senator Stanford in constructing the first buildings for the University
planned to house and care for all of the entering students. Encina Hall was
largely constructed by day labor under his special supervision and on the
pattern of a building in Switzerland which had particularly attracted his at
tention. Roble Hall, now Squoia Hall, was hurriedly built of reinforced con
crete to prepare for the women who were seeking admission. Because of
the time required, the foundations laid for a larger building—similar to
Encina Hall —were temporarily abandoned, and have never been used. The
influx of students was greater than expected and because of the early death
of the Senator, with the subsequent financial difficulties, the growth of
dormitories did not keep pace with the enlarging student body. Nevertheless
the foundation principle of Senator Stanford was and still is sound: i.e., all
students should be housed and fed in suitable buildings owned and controlled
by the University. In so far as circumstances have compelled departure from
this plan have we developed problems associated with the physical well-being
and conduct of our students. I wish to urge upon you the responsibility of
the University to see that additional dormitories and dining halls are sup
plied as promptly as possible. With a student body limited in numbers
there is every reason to provide such facilities for all who enter, so that the
most favorable conditions for the growth of a loyal democratic and closely
knit student group may prevail.
