# HOOVER FOR PRESIDENT
## 
### 
PRESIDENT WILBUR today comes to the defense of Hoover as against the
charges of Hearst that he is pro-British. "The campaign of lies about
Herbert Hoover that is again being given free circulation is an insult to the
intelligence of the American people," says Dr. Wilbur, and we think that in
itself is sufficient answer to the Examiner.
If a foreigner who knew nothing of American politics had read American
newspapers the last few days he might have thought that Herbert Hoover
was in a dilemma as to whether he would accept the Republican or Demo
cratic nomination for President. Readers of the San Francisco Examiner and
all other papers owned by William Randolph Hearst would also be puzzled
as to why Hoover was so suddenly coming to the limelight and being played
as a man who would favor the British as against the United States.
The fact remains it is a great tribute to Hoover that he should be in
the public eye as a possible presidential candidate without using politics.
It is evident that there is a large body of voters in the United States who
are sick and tired of the old party politics and who are looking upon Hoover
as a candidate not only because he is a big man and has proven this by the
big jobs successfully carried out, but also because he is not a politician.
As to the first point at issue, whether Hoover would accept the Repub
lican or Democratic nomination. Most of us we think are agreed that it
would make little difference. The main thing at issue is the man and not
the party. In this day of political clubs and the like, we think that an ex
cellent idea would be to formulate a "Hoover for President" club on the
Stanford campus, the home of Hoover.
