# Wilbur Comes to Hoover's Defense
## President Says Reports Are Only a "Campaign of Lies" 
### 
President Ray/Lyman Wilbur came
to the defense of Herbert Hoover to
day in a statement that characterized
as a "campaign of lies" reports insinu
ating pro-British leanings on the part
of the former Food Administrator, that
are being circulated throughout the
United States. The President states
that he "considers it my duty as
Hoover's most intimate friend since
boyhood to state the truth for those
who wish it."
The executive terms the reports
about Hoover as a "deliberate attempt
to attack his nationality, citizenship
and Americanism," and tells in detail
Hoover's activities in this and other
countries.
The statement issued by President
Wilbur follows:
"The campaign of lies about Herbert
Hoover that is again being given free
circulation is an insult to the intelli
gence of the American people. The
facts are easy to obtain, if facts are
sought. I consider it my duty as
Hoover's most intimate frind since
boyhood to state the truth for those
who wish it, so that they may not be
misled by the renewal of the former
deliberate attempt to attack his nation
ality, citizenship and Americanism.
"I have maintained close contact
with Hoover throughout his career and
know intimately ftf his comings and
goings. His family, birth, raising and
education are known to me in detail.
lowa, Oregon, and California were his
only residences, except for his work
on the Geological Survey of Arkansas.
With his graduation from Stanford
University in Mining Engineering his
professional life, which has had a
world scope, began. During the period
of some twelve years prior to the
war, when he enjoyed an internation
al practice as an engineer, no calendar
year ever went by, with the exception
of 1898 and 1907, in which he was
not for some portion of the year a
resident in the United States. On
these two occasions of considerable
absence he was engaged in engineer
ing constructive work in Australia.
His engineering practice has taken him
into every country in the world. It
is a credit to the universities of the
United States that her engineers are in
such demand. In such work it is
within my knowledge that the total
period that Hoover could have been
actually in England would not exceed
an aggregate of more than three or
four years of the total forty-six of his
life. Although at times he left his
family there when he was obliged to
journey to Russia and other parts of
Europe on professional business. His
son came home in time for the fall
term of school in California as soon
as be was old enough for public
school. He has been actively con
nected with Stanford University, act
ing as advisor to the President in the
Engineering Department or as a Trus
tee of the University for over twelve
years. He has maintained for his
family a home either in San Francisco
or at the University during this en
tire time. His life has emphasized
those striking American qualities that
are the pride of us all.
"As his friend, college mate, phy
sician and colleague, I am happy to
say that I kiiow no finer character,
no better American, no more genuine
lover of the United States than Her
bert Hoover. I hope that we may
speedily have conditions in this coun
try so that vilification, tirades and
abuse may I>e supplanted by construct
ive public service.
