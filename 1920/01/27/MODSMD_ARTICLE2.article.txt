"The campaign of lies about Herbert
Hoover that is again being given free
circulation is an insult to the intelli
gence of the American people. The
facts are easy to obtain, if facts are
sought. I consider it my duty as
Hoover's most intimate frind since
boyhood to state the truth for those
who wish it, so that they may not be
misled by the renewal of the former
deliberate attempt to attack his nation
ality, citizenship and Americanism.
"I have maintained close contact
with Hoover throughout his career and
know intimately ftf his comings and
goings. His family, birth, raising and
education are known to me in detail.
lowa, Oregon, and California were his
only residences, except for his work
on the Geological Survey of Arkansas.
