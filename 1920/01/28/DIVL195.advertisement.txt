"Dairy to Doorstep"
or How We Handle Milk
BOTTLING
(BRIEF SYNOPSIS OF PRECEDING ARTICLES) '
(Cows are washed daily and given clean food. Stalls are sprayed
and painted with disinfectant liquids, milk is obtained in sanitary
patent-cover milk pails, in which it is immediately cooled, and rushed
to our downtown store. Then comes the Clarifying Process, which
is the ejection of foreign substances from the milk by means of centri
gal force which is more effective than straining. After this comes
the Pasteurizing—a process which kills all germs, thus preventing pos
sible infection from tuberculosis, diphtheria or scarlet fever bacteria.
Afther Pasteurization, the milk is cooled.)
After cooling the milk is pumped into the Auto
matic Sanitary Bottling Machine (the only dairy in
the vicinity which bottles entirely by machine).
Bottles are filled and capped without ever being
touched by hand —here is one of the finest ex
» amples of true cleanliness, for under the old
bottling by hand process, many particles of dirt
and germs could have been bottled in.
