To the President of Stanford Uni
versity, California.
Dear Mr. President: —
On the occasion of the first New
Year's celebration since the re
sumption of our course the stu
dents of the University of Louvain
(who on the 15th of May, 1918,
had the honor of being received
with ceremony by your university
with the corp of Belgian Armored
Motor Car men returning from
Russia), send you and your uni
versity their respectful and cordial
wishes for prosperity and happi
ness.
They remember with deep pleas
ure the affecting reception which
was tendered them in your com
munity. American nobility and
generosity has bound the Belgian
people, and our university especi
ally, to your nation with indis
solvable bonds of friendship and
gratitude. We are happy to ex
press these sentiments which the
ceremony of our visit has remark
ably strengthened). We beg you,
Mr. President, to accept this ex
pression of our enduring good
wishes.
This was signed by nine students,
after which the Rector, himself, added
his own message of greeting.
The Rector of the University
of Louvain joins in the thanks and
gratitude of his students and of
the body which they represent to
Stanford University."
P. LADEUZE,
Rector. University
Louvain, January 1. 1920."
