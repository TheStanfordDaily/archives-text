"Pop" Herron, '18, is working along
with Coach Evans as the trainer of
the basketball squad. This is the first
season that Stanford has had a trainer
for the quintet, but the condition of
the men after their hard practices and
scrimmages on the poor floor, requires
especial care in order that the team
will be kept in prime condition. Cap
tain Pelouze, who hurt his leg in the
Nevada game, will not be able to enter
the games with Washington this week
