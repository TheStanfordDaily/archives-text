# Y.M.C.A. TO RESUME "STANDARDS" COURSE
## 
### 
Plans arc under way by the local Y.
M. C. A. to resume the course in "Stan
ford Standards," which was started last
quarter for the freshmen in order that
they would become properly acquainted
with Stanford customs, traditions, and
ideals.
The exact date for the first class,
which will be a lecture on "Men and
Women on the Campus," by Professor
J. H. Hildebrand of the University of
California, has not as yet been definitely
set, but it is expected that it will be with
in the next two weeks. The second and
third classes will be devoted to group
discussions in the halls on the questions,
"Student Body Control Rules" and"The
Honor System." The fourth class will
be a lecture, the subject of which will
be later decided. All of the lectures
which will be given in the course will
be given on Monday nights at the Little
Theater.
