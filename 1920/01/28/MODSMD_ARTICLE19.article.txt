# ROUGHS-AND ROUGHS

### 
ACTION of certain roughs during the last week-end brings up the time
worn subject of roughing once more. It has been said that there are
roughs and then again, there are roughs—just the same as there are vary
ing grades of almost everything else on the campus. We have no quarrel with
members of the first type. They are usually regular fellows.
It is the second species that we are after. There isn't much that can be
said for him except that he is unfortunately termed a rough. In places other
than the Stanford campus he would be more properly termed a vandal or
something worse. Breaking of windows and stealing of property can hardly
be included in the privilege of roughing as most of us understand it. Yet
this is exactly what occurred on Friday night last.
The Men's Council of Student Control have disapproved the action of
these roughnecks and have asked the support of the students in seeing that
no repetition of this act occurs. About one more such occurrence and we
will be apt to find that roughing has gone by the boards. • It is too valuable
a privilege for the men of Stanford to lose. It is up to the decent self-respect
ing fellows in cords who like to watch the social game from the outside to
protect their privilege and to check the action of the non-representative
rough. Will they do it?
