# PALO ALTO SQUAD TO MEET BABES TONIGHT
## 
### 
The Stanford freshmen quintet will
meet the Palo Alto high school team
tonight, at 7 o'clock. This will be the
third time this season that the two
teams have met. No admission will be
charged.
The game will be an easy match for
the Babes, and Coach Acker will prob
ably use a number of his substitutes.
His object is twofold; it will give all
of his men an opportunity for practice,
and it will save his men for the other
two matches for the Babes this week.
Friday night they will meet the Oak
land Tech five; and Saturday night they
will go up against the Fort Scott quintet.
These two latter games will be prelimi
nary contests for the Varsity-Washing
ton State matches.
