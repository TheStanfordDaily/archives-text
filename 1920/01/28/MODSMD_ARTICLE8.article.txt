leading parts in "Rutherford and Son"

the play. The rest of the cast are
well-known In campus dramatics.
"This cast," said Davis," is really
an all-star cast as far as campus
dramatics go. All of the parts in the
play are significant and I believe that
'Rutherford and Son* will be one of
the sensations of the yeai for the
Stanford man and woman who likes
good dramatic work."
Miss Elsinger will be remembered
for her work in"The First Born" and
Junior Opera. Miss Teresa Hihn, *18,
took the lead in the Sophomore Play
in the fall of 1916 and again showed
her dramatic ability in"The First
Born." Josephine Terrill, *21, has had
considerable dramatic experience out
of campus dramatics and has taken
part in several faculty plays. Melba
Berry, '22, demonstrated her ability in
character work in the sophomore play
recently and she will have every op
portunity to keep up her good work
as Mrs. Henderson in "Rutherford and
Son."
Wendt and Fuessle have both had
considerable dramatic experience in
the south and in these two men the
campus should find some interesting
work. Russell Johnston* '20, will be
admirably adapted to this type of play
on account of his work in "Justice"
four years ago. James Quinby, '18. is
probably the real veteran of the cast.
He has been prominent in Ram's Head,
was in the Junior Opera in 1915, and
played in "Justice." His most recent
work was that in"The First Born"
when he played the part of the Chinese
father. Quinby's interpretation of
Martin in "Rutherford and Son" will
undoubtedly add new laurels to his
dramatic experience.
