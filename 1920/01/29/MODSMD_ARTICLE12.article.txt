# PEACE CONFERENCE SITUATION SUBJECT OF TALK BY ADAMS
## 
### 
"The European Situation at the Peace
Conference," was the subject of an ad
dress delivered by Professor E. D. Ad
ams, head of the History Department,
before an open meeting of Euphronia
Debating society last evening.
Many interesting experiences which
occurred in his work of the collccting
of historical material of the Great War,
for the Stanford Library, were re-count
ed by Professor Adams.
By reason of Dr. and Mrs. Adams'
efforts Stanford will have the most com
plete library of historical material of the
war for any college. Professor Ad
ams stated that the collection will prob
ably total over 70,000 volumes, and in
many cases valuable original volumes
have been secured.
An interesting part of the collection
will be the vast number of pamphlets
collected from over 150 societies of
Paris. These pamphlets. Professor Ad
ams stated, show more clearly than any
other material available the public opin
ion of France during the peace confer
ence.
