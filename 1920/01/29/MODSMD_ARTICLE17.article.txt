# FIFTEEN PREPARES FOR FINAL RUGBY CONTEST
## 
### 
Varsity ruggers arc already beginning
their final drills for the Stanford-Cali
fornia game, the last contest of the Car
dinal fifteen and the deciding factor in
the league supermacy, which is to be
played at California February 14.
No games remain on the University
schedule until that date, but Coach Wy
lie has determined upon a practice game
for Saturday, in order to give the new
material on the squad a chance to show.
After working on his forwards for an
other week, the coach feels confident of
having the best line-up of the season
ready for the field by the time of the
"big" game.
With the decision of the Olympic
Games Committee in regard to rugby a
question of only a few days, the show
ing of the team in its last game will
probably decide whether the invitation
to compete will be extended to Stanford
direct,, or to the western universities as
a whole. .
