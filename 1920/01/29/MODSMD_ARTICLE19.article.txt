fjpHE PACIFIC COAST CONFERENCE at their recent meeting in Seattle
adopted a rule of a 50-50 split on the gate receipts. This rule was
adopted by a five to one vote, the University of Washington taking the
minority view and favoring the old system, where the visitor receives ex
penses and nothing else. The University of Washington is now refusing to
sign contracts on the conference basis and is making efforts to sign con
tracts on the old scheme.
Stanford received one of these contracts for football games in 1920i and
1921, one of the games to be played here and the other in Seattle. The Board
of Athletic Control decided that they would consider such a contract on a
50-50 split of the gate receipts, which is of course what the University of
Washington is trying to get away from. In all probability they will refuse
to sign such a contract and in this case Stanford should flatly refuse to con
sider any other terms.
We feel that the conference ruling is fair and is for the best interests of
football on the Pacific Coast. Even if we did not think so we believe that
Stanford should abide by the rules of the conference. Only by so doing may
we hope for athletics, or for that matter for anything else where men deal
through organizations to accomplish what they are supposed to.
We imagine the other universities of the conference will stand firm on
this decision. If they do the University of Washington will be forced to
bring Eastern teams for their big games, and this would not be a very suc
cessful procedure. In the first place, assuming that the finances of the
games would take care of itself, which may be doubted, would the student
body of Washington be satisfied? Probably not. Washington will find that
she is attempting a good deal when she publicly announces her intention to
refuse to obey the rules of the Pacific Coast Conference. If all the other
universities stand pat, Washington will find that she can not play a lone
hand, and will be forced to play under the rules of the conference.
