# FRESHMAN FIVE AGAIN DEFEATS P.A. TEAM
## Babes Are Scheduled For Two More Games This Week 
### 
The Stanford freshman five were
easily victors of a basketball game, in
the Encina Gymnasium last night,
winning from the Palo Alto high school
squad by a score of 25 to 8. This is
the third time the babes have beaten
(he high school quintet this season.
The. forwards failed to come up to
their usual standard of teamwork, and
would continually lose the ball while
taking it down the field. Burkhard
and Howell, however, played a good
game in the offensive end of the
court, while Tritle and Pollard were
the outstanding stars on the defense.
The freshmen playing the game
were, forwards, Anderson, Rogers,
Austin, Clark and Burkhard; center,
Howell, Piggett and HeGroot; guards,
Williamson, Pollard, Tritle. Root and
Carpenter.
The Palo Alto line-up was, Hayes,
Scofield Arata, Richards and Shaw.
