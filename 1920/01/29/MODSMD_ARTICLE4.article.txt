# Cow Catcher Catches Cute, Cunning Calves
## 
### 
Six cunning calves, owned and oper
ated by three young things, were seen
mysteriously standing on the rear cow
catcher of a Pally-bound car one even
ing this week. Spectators of this start
ling and spectacular stunt spied with
surprise the objects on the rear of the
car. Searching their minds for a rea
son, they decided that this was indeed
novel, inasmuch as the three young
things were college co-eds, and not reg
istered in the Palo Alto kindergarten.
IDEA: Foolish freshmen found frol
icking. should be suppressed by sedate
seniors. /
