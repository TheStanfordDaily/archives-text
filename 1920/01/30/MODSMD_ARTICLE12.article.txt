# Cap and Gown Will Give First of Series of Informal Dances
## 
### 
The first of a series of informal
dances to be given this quarter by Cap
and Gown has been announced for Feb
ruary 6th at the Woman's Clubhouse.
Unusual and entertaining features, to be
announced later, give assurance of a
dance as enjoyable as those given in the
past by the women's honor society.
"Jack" Kegley, '18, will come from the
University of California to provide the
music. The admission price has been
set at $1 a couple.
Raising of funds for charity work
at Lane Clinic is Cap and Gown's aim
in giving the dances. The second dance
will probably be held in March, and an
other one is planned for April.
