# BASEBALL TEAM WILL MEET O.A.C. ON MARCH 17-18
## HAWAII TRIP PLANNED Slight Change in Basketball Schedule Is Made by Board of Control 
### 
Oregon Agricultural College will send
a baseball team south to meet Stanford
for a two-game series here on March 17
and 18. Definite arrangements for this
meeting with the 'Aggies was settled at
a meeting of the Board of Athletic Con
trol last night.
Further plans for the varsity baseball
team include a tentative proposal for a
trip in the Northwest following the
game with O. A. C. here, and a trip to
Honolulu still later in the year. Nothing
definite in this direction was arranged,
however, at last night's meeting.
A slight change was made in the var
sity basketball schedule. In order to
give the team a rest-up after meeting
the University of Oregon before the
games with O. A. C., the U. of O. games
have been moved back one day. As a
result of this change the Stanford-
Oregon games will be played on Feb
ruary 24 and 25, instead of 25 and 26.
