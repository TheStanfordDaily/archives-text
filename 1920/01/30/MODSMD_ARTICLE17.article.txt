# 'RUTHERFORD AND SON' REHEARSALS BEGIN
## English Club Production Will Mark New Milestone in Campus Dramatics 
### 
Rehearsals for the play of "Ruther
ford and Son" to be produced under
the auspices of the English Club ou
February 20, are well under way ac
cording to Coach Davis. The keen
interest among the cast in making
this unique play a success on the
campus will do much to make "Ruther
ford and Son" a significant milestone
in the history of Stanford dramatics.
"Rutherford ana Son"' was produced
in New York in 1913 at Winthrop
Ames' Little Theater. Although the
initial introduction of the play was
given in London, it was not until 1913
that the play came to the attention of
the American public. The potent
realism of the Rutherford family made
an instant appeal to the lovers of good
drama. The play was reviewed and
commented upon as a distinct contri
bution to modern dramatic literature.
"Rutherford and Son" according to
critics, is a play "which will live.
Since the New York production of
"Rutherford and Son," the play has
never been seen in the West. The
English Club presentation is therefore
thought to be particularly interesting
as February 20 will give Stanford the
atre lovers the first opportunity to
see "Rutherford and Son" a classic
in modern drama heretofore never
presented,on the Western stage.
