# WHY NOT QUEEN THERE?
## 
### 
STANFORD plays her first basketball game in the Pacific Coast Conference
tonight, at Encina Gymnasium. Washington State College, well-known
in past years for its success in producing basketball teams, and undefeated
as yet this year, will oppose the varsity. When the whistle for the varsity
game is blown at 8:00 o'clock tonight the sidelines should be filled by Cardi
nal rooters.
Unfortunately the social calendar for the evening is well-filled and we
are afraid that this may keep many students away from the game. The
Student Manager has promised that it will begin sharply at 8 p.m., which will
give plenty of time for students to attend both the game and dances. Our
suggestion to those planning to take in the latter is to queen to the basket
ball game, too. There will then be plenty of time to get to the dance. Since
(he Student Body Dance at Encina, where the Washington State men are to
be guests of honor, will nof start until after game, this will indeed simplify
matters for those planning to attend it.
Incidentally, we would recommend that those who especially like the court
game, come early to witness the freshman contest with Oakland Tech. Those
who see the games tonight will probably need no invitation to attend tomor
row night whon Stanford and Washington State met in a second contest.
