# COLLEGES ASKED TO FURNISH RUGBY MEN
## Plans Under Way to Draw Up Fifteen for Olympic Games 
### 
Preparation to draw up an all-Pacific
rugby fifteen for the Olympic Games
is at last under way, through action
of Stanford offiicials, taken yesterday,
in the form of a written request to
all the important California universi
ties, asking them to secure informa
tion and report here immediately on
all players they feel available for such
a team.
The ttep was determined upon after
receipt of a letter from Secretary
Rubien of the A. A. U., in which he
asked Stanford to make her arrange
ments for the fifteen, investigate the
possibility of securing funds to finance
it, and to send him definite news as
soon as possible. He stated that al
though official action had not yet been
taken by the committee, it was his
personal opinion, after talking the
matter over with several of its mem
bers, that the decision would be in
favor of Stanford. He promised that
lie, personally, would do all in his
power to further the movement.
As a result of the New York com
munication, letters have been sent to
the University of California, Santa
Clara, St. Mary's, the Los Angeles
Athletic Club, Olympic Club of San
Francisco, and the University of
Southern California.
Cardinal coaches have already be
gun to list and classify the university
squad with a view to submitting names
of Stanford rugby men they consider
eligible. A committee has also been
formed for the purpose of looking
after the financial arrangements.
Upon the showing made by the local
squad in the last days of the season,
and particularly in the California
game, will depend the number of Stan
ford men recommended for the Ant
werp trip. It is planned to take a
party of about twenty ruggers, al
together. The men will leave the
United States on the liner which is to
carry the other American athletes,
and will sail in the early part of July.
The number of Stanford men sure to
qualify is not as great as the number
who made the northern trip with Cali
fornia. Advance information predicts
that three players from California, one
from the Olympic Club, one from Santa
Clara, one each from St. Mary's and
the Lop. Angeles Club, and two from
University of Southern California, are
sure of positions, limiting the number
of local rug?;ers to elsven.
Hard drills for the squad will be
staged by Coaches Wvlie, Carroll, and
Maloney, from now 011 until the end
of the season. A practice match is
scheduled for tomorrow afternoon. The
coaches wish to announce that there
is still a good opportunity for new
candidates, and that every man will
be given his chance.
