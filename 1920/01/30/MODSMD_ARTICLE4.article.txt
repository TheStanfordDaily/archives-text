# Stanford Soccerites Ready For National Carbon Company Team
## 
### 
With the return of Bucklin to the
squad, the university soccerites are
prepared to xneet the National Carbon
Company tomorrow afternoon at 3
p.m., on the turf field, with an even
stronger eleven than the one which
held the fast Olympic team to a single
point victory last Saturday.
Now leading the field for the Lath
rop trophy, Stanford faces two tail
enders before the California game,
which will decide the championship.
After forfeiting one game to the Car
dinal eleven, the Carbon Company has
been practicing with renewed vigor in
the hopes of squaring accounts. A
defeat for Stanford will again put the
Cardinal in second place, with a small
chance of regaining the lead.
Quinby had decided upon the fol
lowing line-up for the game:
Goal, Newland; forwards, Bucklin,
Strauss, Weller, Pillsbury, Green;
half-becks, Myers, Robinson, Quinby;
full-backs, Mendoza, Adams.
