STANFORD REPUBLICAN
CLUB
This year will witness one of the
most momentous presidential elections
in the history of the United States.
The settlement of the great econom
ic, social, and labor problems of the
day will rest squarely on the should
ers of the next occupant of the White
House, and it will be incumbent upon
him not only to restore our domestic
tranquility, but also to find correct
solutions for our relations with Eu
rope and Mexico.
That a true American, a real patri
ot, and a man of unquestioned ability
is needed to fill the place, almost goes
without saying; and not since I860 1 has
the country been more in need of a
return to a Republican Administration
than at the present day.
The people have determined to
eliminate the continuance of a peace
with Mexico which has so far cost
more American lives than our War
with Spain, to uproot the insidious
propaganda of foreign and native
radicals, to stop the wasteful extrava
gance of administration, and to place
in office officials of experience, and not
petty politicians of the Solid South.
The Republican National Convention
will meet at Chicago on June 8th, to
select a standard-bearer for the No
vember election. But in several states,
of which California is one, the voters
will have an opportunity to record
their preference at the presidential
primary elections to be held in the
near future. The California primary
will take place in May, and it is
necessary that every voters register
immediately to be able to qualify.
The Stanford Republican Club,
therefore, urges every affiiliated mem
ber to at once register, in order that
they may participate in the coming
election.
The Campus Registrar of Voters is
in the Dean of Men's Office in the
Administrative (old library) Building
on the Quad. Any student who is over
the age of 21, has been in the State
of California one year, and considers
the campus as his or her residence
is entitled to qualify as a legal voter,
and should at once do so.
Any student who has retained a
legal residence elsewhere, may be
able to vote by mail by the laws of
his home state. Those wishing in
formation on this point should ad
dress Republican Club, Box 82, Cam
pus, and will be advised by personal
letter as to the necessary procedure.
