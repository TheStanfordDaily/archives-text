# SPEEDERS WARNED TO SLOW UP ON CAMPUS
## A.E. ROTH THREATENS ARRESTS State Statute Applies to University Grounds Says Comptroller 
### 
Careless automobile driving and
speeding 011 the Stanford campus is
ordered stopped in a warning issued
by Comptroller A. E. Roth, this morn
ing. The warning designates the post
office and bookstore sections of the
campus a business district, and the
row as a closely built up district, and
sets forth that the speed limits as
provided by State statutes apply to
the campus.
Instruction to use their authority as
deputy sheriffs in case of future vio
lations has been issued to men on the
University staff by Roth.
The present warning is the result of
three serious accidents which have
occurred on the campus in the past
month. In two of these accidents,
Roth points out, the drivers of cars
subjected themselves to penitentiary
terms for failure to stop and render
assistance.
The warning follows:
"For the information of students and
others driving automobiles on the Uni
versity campus, attention is called to the
fact that under the provisions of the
California Motor Vehicle Act as amend
ed in 1919, the grounds of private edu
cational institutions are included within
the definition of highways subject to the
act. All the provisions of this act there
fore apply to the Stanford campus. .
"This act provides the following speed
limits:
"15 miles in business districts;
"20 miles in closely built-up dis
tricts;
"15 miles when approaching electric
railway crossings, or intersec
tions of highways, or approach
ing and going around corners
and curves:
"35 miles on unobstructed highways
in day time;
"30 miles on unobstructed highways
in night time.
"The general area immediately adja
cent to the bookstore, press building,
corporation yard and post-office hereby
is designated as a business district. The
areas adjacent to the Quadrangle, Roble
Hall, Encina Hall and the streets of the
Row are designated as closely built-up
districts.
"During the past month three serious
accidents have occurred on the campus
as a result of reckless driving and
speeding. In two instances the drivers
of automobiles have failed to stop and
render aid to persons injured. Such
failure constitutes a felony.
"The provisions of the Motor Vehicle
Act hereafter will be strictly enforced
on the Stanford campus."
