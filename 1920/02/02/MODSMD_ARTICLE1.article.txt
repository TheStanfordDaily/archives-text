# SPEEDERS WARNED TO SLOW UP ON CAMPUS
## A.E. ROTH THREATENS ARRESTS State Statute Applies to University Grounds Says Comptroller 
### 
Careless automobile driving and
speeding 011 the Stanford campus is
ordered stopped in a warning issued
by Comptroller A. E. Roth, this morn
ing. The warning designates the post
office and bookstore sections of the
campus a business district, and the
row as a closely built up district, and
sets forth that the speed limits as
provided by State statutes apply to
the campus.
Instruction to use their authority as
deputy sheriffs in case of future vio
lations has been issued to men on the
University staff by Roth.
The present warning is the result of
three serious accidents which have
occurred on the campus in the past
month. In two of these accidents,
Roth points out, the drivers of cars
subjected themselves to penitentiary
terms for failure to stop and render
assistance.
