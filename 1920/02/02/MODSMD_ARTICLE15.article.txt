# HOOVER CLUB IS FORMED IN VIRGINIA
## 
### 
Organization of a Hoover Club at
Stanford that would advocate the selec
tion of Herbert Hoover, '95, as the
Democratic candidate for the presidency
was suggested in a telegram received
here yesterday from the Hoover Club
of the University of Virginia. Douglas
Arant, the temporary chairman of the
Virginia organization, has asked for the
support of Stanford men in the organiz
ation of college clubs throughout the
country for this purpose.
This telegram has fallen in line al
most exactly with an editorial published
in the Daily Palo Alto last Tuesday that
urged the formation of" a "Hoover-for-
President Club" that would support the
ex-food administrator on any ticket he
should happen to run on. The Univer
sity of Virginia suggestion runs on the
lines of a Democratic club only, in dis
tinction to the Daily Palo Alto's favor
ing Hoover on a non-partisan basis.
No Hoover club has been formed at
Stanford so far.
