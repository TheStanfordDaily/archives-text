# Refugee Benefit Dance Nets Large Returns
## 
### 
With a total sum of $197 taken in and
only a few expenses to meet, the dance
given by the Kappa Kappa Gamma so
rority Saturday night proved a financial
success. The money will go to the sup
port of the national work of the sorority
which is the maintenance of relief work
for the refugees at Bellvue Meudon,
France. The dance was well attended,
the door receipts totaling ahout $110,
while the rest of the proceeds came from
the raffling of home-made cakes and
hoxes of candy.
