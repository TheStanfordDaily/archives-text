ing the victory to the Cardinal team.

play as fast a game next Saturday
against California, the Cardinal sun
porters will be able to give the Blue
and Gold five a hard fight for the
laurels. The Coach has worked out
a number of different combinations,
several of which he used in the Wash
ington State games. He is able to
shift his line-up to meet any offense
that may be made by the California
coach.
Righter was shifted from center to
forward, while Hood was played
against Washington at all three posi
tions. Mills was used at forward and
running guard, and if the occasion
had arisen, he could have gone in at
center. With these different shifts,
along Nvitli the possibilities that Evans
has on the bench, he will put a team
on the floor next Saturday that might
defeat the University of California.
Captain Pelouze, who was unable to
play in either of the first two Confer
ence games on account of an injury
he received in the Nevada game, will
again be out for practice this week.

to his old position at forward, instead
of guard.

that may be made by the California
coach.

forward, while Hood was played
against Washington at all three posi
tions. Mills was used at forward and
running guard, and if the occasion
had arisen, he could have gone in at

has on the bench, he will put a team
on the floor next Saturday that might
defeat the University of California.

play in either of the first two Confer
ence games on account of an injury
he received in the Nevada game, will
