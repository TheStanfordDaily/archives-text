# FRESHMAN FIVE WINS GAME BY FREAK SCORE
## Babes Defeat Fort Scott In One-Sided Game; 63â€”0 
### 
Winning by a freak score of 63 to 0,
the Stanford freshmen defeated the
Fort Scott quintet, in a preliminary
game to the Varsity-Washington State
contest, Saturday night, in the Encina
gymnasium. In a more closely match
ed game, the babes won from th Oak
land Technical team, Friday night, by
19 to 9.
To roll up a score of 63 points is
something unusual in a basketball
game, but to hold the opposing team
scoreless is nearly unbelievable.
Coaches Acker and Evans said after
the game that this was the first time
that they had ever seen such a freak
score. The only other peculiar game
of such a nature that they could re
call, was one between two Eastern
schools, ending with a score of 67 to 1.
The "frosh"Jtiave at last mastered
the science of team work, and dur
ing both of the games, used teamwork
instead of their usual individual play
ing. With Burkhard, Rogers, Howell
and DeGroot playing in the offensive
end of the court, Coach Acker is build
ing up a strong machine among the
freshman basketeball candidates.
On Wednesday night of this week
the five will be matched against the
University High School of Oakland.
The game will be played on the En
cina court.
