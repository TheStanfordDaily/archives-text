# A 						WORTHY CAUSE
## 
### 
MEMBERS of the local Young Men and Young Women's Christian Associa
tions today start their annual campaign for funds. In the case of the
Y. M. C. A. the fund is for two separate purposes, one for the support of the
loval "Y," and the other for the suppor of E. H. Lockwood, former Stan
ford man and now a missionary in China. Contributions may be made to
one or to the other, or in fact to both, just as the giver may choose. The
women are soliciting for the campus organization only.
We do not think that there is need of us saying why the Stanford
Y. M. C. A. is entitled to contributions. Most of us realize that they fill a
definite place on our campus and are of a great deal of service. One thing
in particular that they take care of, and this entirely aside from the religi
ous question, is the finding of jobs for Stanford men who need them. This
service is in itself of great value and should be remembered. The women's
association is also just as deserving and the women of the University will
no doubt ably support it as they have in the past.
As to the Lockwood fund, the goal of which was set by the campaign
committee at lunch today at $1000, Stanford men who know Lockwood will
need little urging to contribute to such a worthy work. The rest of us will
simply have to take the word of those who knew him and contribute to the
cause of a former Stanford man as best we can.
Personally or editorially, whichever it is, we believe that the Stanford
man or woman who contributes, after deciding where their dime or dollar
will accomplish the most, will be doing something well worth while.
