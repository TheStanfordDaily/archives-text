# Palo Alto Protests Against Torture Cage
## 
### 
A number of Palo Alto citizens met
last week to take action on the "Torture
Cage" of Alcatraz Island, and as a result
the following protest has been sent to the
War Department in telegraphic form:
"At a public meeting of Palo Alto
citizens, January 30, the following reso
lution was passed unanimously, 'Re
solved, That a telegraphic protest be sent
to the Secretary of War against the use
of steel cages at Alcatraz. These cages
are 23 inches long, 12 inches wide, and
6 feet high, in dark, cold, underground,
solitary cells. Dozens of newspapers

print full details. Commandant is
quoted as saying Simmons may stand in
cage the working hours of every day for
six years. General public is horrified.
Constitution forbids cruel and unusual
punishment.'"
