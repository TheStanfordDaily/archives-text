# Y.M.C.A. STARTS JOINT CAMPAIGN AMONG STUDENTS
## 
### 
Definite amounts for the goals for the
two joint campaigns which are being
started today by the local Y. C. were
set by the "Y" cabinet and workers at
a luncheon held at noon in the Engineer
ing Building. The amount for the cam
paign to raise funds for the local work
was set at $500, while the goal for the
Lockwood campaign was set at $1,000.
The Lockwood work is being conduct
ed at Canton, China, by E. H. Lock
wood, a former Stanford Y. M. C. A.
worker. Mr. Lockwood was at this
school as Y. M. C. A. secretary in 1913
and 1914. When the custom of sending
missionaries to foreign fields was start
ed by the universities of America Stan
ford sent Mr. Lockwood to Canton to
act as "Y" secretary i nthis city. His
success and the scope of his work de
pends entirely upon the manner in which
the students and alumni subscribe to the
campaign for funds which are to be used
for his support. In past years the
amount subscribed to this work has
never exceeded $500, and as this amount
is far behind the average set by the other
schools throughout the country, the local
Workers are working doubly hard to ob
tain the desired amount.
The campaign now being conducted by
the Y. W. C. A. is not in any way con
nected with the Y. M. C. A. These two
campaigns are being conducted for en
tirely different purposes, and the men of
the institution will be solicited for one
and the women for the other. Workers
for the Y. M. C. A. will start soliciting
the halls and other campus groups this
evening.
