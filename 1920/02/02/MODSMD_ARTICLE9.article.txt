# CREW CANDIDATES NOW WORKING OUT AT REDWOOD
## COACH ROGERS PLEASED WITH MATERIAL Four Veterans Back to Claim Positions In Shell 
### 
Active work for the Stanford Crew
started last Friday when Coach Le:
Rogers took forty of his candidates to
the Redwood Estuaiy and sent them
through a series of workouts in the
shell. Several new men have shown up
for practice that look good for varsity
berths. Rogers has four letter men as
a nucleus around which to build his
crew, Captain "Cash" Davis, McGilliv
ray, Cary and Wilbur being on hand
again.
Practically every member of last
year's freshman crew is out for a var
sity berth this season, providing a great
amount of talent for Rogers to work
with. Regular trips to Redwood will
be in order from now on and practice in
the shell has worked wonders with the
men already.
Fully sixty of the ninety that reported
for crew were freshmen and from this
number of men, Rogers should find little
difficulty in turning out a strong '23
crew. Most of the men are big and
strong and possess some knowledge of
rowing already.
As yet the date for the triangular race
in the Northwest with California and
the University of Washington has not
been definitely arranged. There are
prospects for the freshmen crews of the
three universities meeting as a prelimi
nary race to the varsity affair, but this
also has not been arranged definitely.
The annual race with California is set
for May 1 at the Oakland Estuary. Cal
ifornia had the strongest crew she ever
had last year, and most of her men are
back this year, so Coach Rogers has a
real job before him.
