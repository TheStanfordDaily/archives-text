# CALIFORNIA WINS CONFERENCE GAME FROM WASHINGTON
## FIVES CLOSELY MATCHED Northerners Lose Game To Blue and Gold Quintet By Two Points 
### 
WASHINGTON STATE was defeated
by the University of California
basketball team, by a score of 28 to
26, 011 the Harmon gymnasium floor,
last night. The results of this game
seem to dope the Stanford-California
game of next Saturday as an evenly
matched contest.
The Washington live outplayed the
Berkeley squad with their superior
teamwork and playing, and remained
in the lead during the first part of
the game. The team went to pieces
for a few minutes just before the end
of the first half, due to the strain of
the heavy schedule of games that the
northerners have played during the
past week.
At the beginning of the second half,
the Blue and Gold was in the lead and
maintained it until the close of the
contest. California's larger and heavi
er team is all that saved them from
defeat.
Stafford and California play the
same kind of game, both relying more
on the fight of the respective teams,
than to the corresponding teamwork.
Neither of the two teams have been
out for practice long enought this sea
son to have the polished playing of
the Washington State College team.
