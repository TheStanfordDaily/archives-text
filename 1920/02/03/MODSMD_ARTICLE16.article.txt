# SORORITY PROBLEM IS DISCUSSED BY PRESIDENT WILBUR
## WOMEN HOLD MEETING Alumni Committee Submits Several Propositions to College Head 
### 
sororities as such may continue
to exist, but that the sorority-house
system is unsatisfactory and doomed to
give way to the dormitory system, was
the principal statement of President
Wilbur, addressing a meeting of over
two hundred women, principally from
the Row, last night. The president says
that lie is working for the "greatest good
of the greatest number," and that in all
liis plans he is thinking of the woman
who will come to Stanford five or ten
years from now, and that he is deter
mined that in the future every Stanford
woman shall have an equal chance.
Previous to President Wilbur's talk,
a report from the Alumni Committee
which has been working upon this ques
tion, was made by Mrs. J. W. Bingham,
chairman, who stated that the committee
had met with President Wilbur, and had
submitted several propositions to him,
in the form of four queries.
The first query was, "Would the Uni
versity allow the women to build their
own houses in suitable places (i.e., in
the district surrounding Roble Hall) ?"
The answer was, "No." The second
was, "Would the University build houses
and rent them to the sororities?" This
again was answered in the negative. The
third was, "Would the University allow
the sorority to build its own rooms on
the Campus for meeting purposes?" The
reply was that this would be too much
financial burden on the women. The last
proposition was, "Would the extremely
small unit dormitory system be possi
ble?" The answer to this was that such
a system would depend upon its practi
cability and upon the financial standing
of the University. With the acceptance
of this report, it was decided to appoint
a permanent committee to draw up some
plan of building dormitories, to submit
to President Wilbur.
President Wilbur's speech was devot
ed for the most part to answering ques
tions asked by several of the alumni
women and sorority women present.
But prior to this, he gave a short out
line of the plans of the University, il
lustrating them by charts. According
to President Wilbur, bis investigation of
the situation at other universities, to
which he has made special trips, has con
vinced him that the present housing plan
here is highly unsatisfactory, and that
the women are not receiving the ade
quate care that the University should
give them, in some such building as
Roble Hall.
The rest of the meeting was devoted
to the asking and answering of questions
the most important of which follow:
Question: Why is the new housing
plan better than the old?
Answer: To the effect that the sorori
ty houses are badly located, being situ
ated next to fraternity houses. Also
many non-sorority women are dissatis
fied with the isolation of the sorority
women. (President Wilbur's objection
is not to the mere natural grouping of
some people, as chapter entities, but to
their isolation in houses.)
Question : Where does the University
get the right to say where the University
shall house its students?
Answer: To the effect that the Uni
versity must accept all or no responsi
bility for students, and Stanford has
chosen to assume full responsibility.
Question: If the environment of the
sorority house fosters good, why re
move it?
Answer: To the effect that sororities
existed before sorority houses, therefore
it is not the house that does the good.
Question: If the sorority would give
the houses to the University, would the
University work out some plan of Uni
versity supervision, and let the women
live in their houses?
Answer: It is possible.
President Wilbur concluded by saying
that his opinion was based upon twenty
five years of watching campus life, and
that he was striving to provide "the
greatest good fur the greatest number."

tions asked by several of the alumni
women and sorority women present.
But prior to this, he gave a short out
line of the plans of the University, il
lustrating them by charts. According
to President Wilbur, bis investigation of
the situation at other universities, to
which he has made special trips, has con
vinced him that the present housing plan
here is highly unsatisfactory, and that
the women are not receiving the ade
quate care that the University should
give them, in some such building as
Roble Hall.
The rest of the meeting was devoted
to the asking and answering of questions
the most important of which follow:
Question: Why is the new housing
plan better than the old?
Answer: To the effect that the sorori
ty houses are badly located, being situ
ated next to fraternity houses. Also
many non-sorority women are dissatis
fied with the isolation of the sorority
women. (President Wilbur's objection
is not to the mere natural grouping of
some people, as chapter entities, but to
their isolation in houses.)
Question : Where does the University
get the right to say where the University
shall house its students?
Answer: To the effect that the Uni
versity must accept all or no responsi
bility for students, and Stanford has
chosen to assume full responsibility.
Question: If the environment of the
sorority house fosters good, why re
move it?
Answer: To the effect that sororities
existed before sorority houses, therefore
it is not the house that does the good.
Question: If the sorority would give
the houses to the University, would the
University work out some plan of Uni
versity supervision, and let the women
live in their houses?
Answer: It is possible.
President Wilbur concluded by saying
that his opinion was based upon twenty
five years of watching campus life, and
that he was striving to provide "the
greatest good fur the greatest number."
sororities as such may continue
to exist, but that the sorority-house
system is unsatisfactory and doomed to
give way to the dormitory system, was
the principal statement of President
Wilbur, addressing a meeting of over
two hundred women, principally from
the Row, last night. The president says
that lie is working for the "greatest good
of the greatest number," and that in all
liis plans he is thinking of the woman
who will come to Stanford five or ten
years from now, and that he is deter
mined that in the future every Stanford
woman shall have an equal chance.
Previous to President Wilbur's talk,
a report from the Alumni Committee
which has been working upon this ques
tion, was made by Mrs. J. W. Bingham,
chairman, who stated that the committee
had met with President Wilbur, and had
submitted several propositions to him,
in the form of four queries.
The first query was, "Would the Uni
versity allow the women to build their
own houses in suitable places (i.e., in
the district surrounding Roble Hall) ?"
The answer was, "No." The second
was, "Would the University build houses
and rent them to the sororities?" This
again was answered in the negative. The
third was, "Would the University allow
the sorority to build its own rooms on
the Campus for meeting purposes?" The
reply was that this would be too much
financial burden on the women. The last
proposition was, "Would the extremely
small unit dormitory system be possi
ble?" The answer to this was that such
a system would depend upon its practi
cability and upon the financial standing
of the University. With the acceptance
of this report, it was decided to appoint
a permanent committee to draw up some
plan of building dormitories, to submit
to President Wilbur.
President Wilbur's speech was devot
ed for the most part to answering ques
tions asked by several of the alumni
women and sorority women present.
