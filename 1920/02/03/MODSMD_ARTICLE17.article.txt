# M. Jusserand Will Select Joffre Topic
## French Electorate System Stimulates Interest in April Contest 
### 
M. Jusserand, the present French am
bassador to the United States, will prob
ably he asked, Coach M. L. McClintock
announced today, to name the specific
question for the big Joffre forensic con
test with the University of California
in April. This action will be a continu
ation of the policy inaugurated last year
by the debating coach when Professor
O'Neil of the University of Wisconsin
decided the topic which was placed be
fore the debaters two hours prior to the
contest. In the event the French ambas
sador is unable to pick the subject for
discussion, it is ccrtain that one of the
foremost of the national authorities o*
France, possibly a professor from a*
Eastern university, will choose the deti
nite question.
Representatives of the French govern
ment in this country are showing a keen
interest in the forensic battle, as the
Jnffre debate, because of its unique na
ture, is one of the most important dis
cussions of public policy in the West.
Consul-General Neltner, who represents
the French Republic at San Francisco,
presided at the Jouie '.ast spring.
It is probable that M. Neltner will act
as chairman for the big scrap this year.
Unusual interest has been aroused
both in Stanford and University of Cali
fornia debating circles by the genera!
question which has been submitted for
debate. The joint committee of profes
sors of the two universities a short time
ago announced the "French Election
System" as the topic for discussion.
The question is pertinent at the present
time because of the controversy now ex
isting in the French Chamber of Depu
ties over the present election system.
The methods now in vogue in France
have given rise to much criticism on the
ground that they inadvertently represent
French opinion. Present-day discussion
will undoubtedly be reflected in the
speeches of the contestants the night of
the forensic battle.
