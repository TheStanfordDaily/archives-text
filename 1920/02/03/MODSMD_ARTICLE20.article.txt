COMPTROLLER A. E. ROTH says that the California State speed laws are
to be enforced on the Stanford campus. Most of us will be glad to hear
that such is the case, particularly will we be pleased to really see them be
ing enforced. This is espcially true of us who walk, but we believe that the
majority of drivers of automobiles will themselves be glad to have some sort
of traffic regulation as protection to the sane driver.
Along with the speed regulations, there ought to be something done to
the fellow who insists on driving with his muffler wide open, who seems
to delight in making as much noise as possible. He is almost as much of a
trial to our nerves as the speeder is to our lives.
In the old days when the campus possessed only a few motor vehicles,
and most of these were one-lunged motorcycles, traffic regulations were of
no use. Today, however, when the air is filled with the odor of gasoline, we
wonder at the speed of those fortunate enough to possess automobiles, and
truly marvel at the way in which they dodge one another. Regulations are
necessary and in additiop to this the co-operation of the drivers in obeying
the regulations is more than necessary. It is obvious that if someone should
get bumped today, tomorrow would be too late to cut down the speed. Obey
the speed laws.
