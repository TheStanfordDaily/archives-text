Partial reports of the joint campaign
of -the local Y. M. C. A. which were
compiled last night indicate that, if
the present average of subscription is
maintained, the goals which were set
will be reached within the limit of
the three day period. Complete re
ports from two of the fraternity houses
show that an exceptional high average
per capita is being set by the row
men. Members of Tlieta Delta Chi
have pledged $35.00. and members of
Alpha Delta Phi have subscribed
$33.50. Complete results from the
canvass of the men's dormitories and
the rest of fraternities are expected
to be in this evening and it is hoped
that the average rate ot subscription
will be sufficiently high to insure a
large portion of the desired sum.
