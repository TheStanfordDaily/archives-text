# STUART WALKER IS PLEASED WITH SHOWING OF CAST
## LOCAL PLAY IS PLEASING Eastern Impressario Visits "Rutherford and Son" Rehearsals 
### 
ENGLISH Club Dramatic coaclics re
ccived a visit from Stewart Walker
this morning. Walker is manager of
the Portmanteau Theater and is well
known in Eastern dramatic circles. He
expressed himself as pleased with both
the play and cast chosen by the club
for its coming production, "Rutherford
and Son."
A. W. Wendt, '18, and Kenneth Fues
sle, '23, who are carrying the two leading
roles for men in the cast, are working
splendidly into their parts. Wendt's
previous experience has fitted him ad
mirably for the part of John Rutherford
â€”the father who has dominated his
entire family to the extent that none of
them have had the opportunity to de
velop and live their own lives. The slow
rebellion in the Rutherford family
against the father centers around the
reprobate son, played by Fuessle. The
conflict between the two is inevitable and
makes one of the gripping scenes of the
play.
Miss Ruth Ensinger, '20, has a very
difficult part to interpret in Janet Ruth
erford, the woman in the situation. The
tragic hopelessness of her lot coupled
with the smouldering tires of resentment
which lead to further complications in
the plot, make up one of the intense
threads which run through the theme
of "Rutherford and Son."
