JOHN EZRA McDOWELL, Dean of
" Men and Alumni Secretary, has re

graduates and former students.
President Wilbur requested him to
continue as alumni secretary, and agreed
to relieve him from the position of Dean

your occupancy of the office of academic
secretary, will give the University the

your services in bringing the alumni and
the University into close association."
