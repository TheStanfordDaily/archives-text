# J.E. M'DOWELL RESIGNS AS DEAN OF MEN
## IS ALUMNI SECRETARY Long Hours Required by Both Offices Leads to New Move 
### 
JOHN EZRA McDOWELL, Dean of
" Men and Alumni Secretary, has re
signed the former position in order
that he may devote himself more fully
to the work of the latter. The resig
nation has beer accepted by President
Ray Lyman Wilbur, and becomes ef
fective at the end of the present
quarter.
Long hours necessary to properly
carry on the activities of both the of
fices of dean and alumni secretary,
have told on Dean McDowell's health,
and he assigns this as a reason for
resigning as dean.
No successor has been named.
In a letter to President Wilbur, Mc-
Dowell asked to be relieved from one
of the positions, expressing his own
belief that he could be of greater ser
vice to the university as alumni sec
retary, by bringing about a closer re
lation between the University and its
graduates and former students.
President Wilbur requested him to
continue as alumni secretary, and agreed
to relieve him from the position of Dean
of Men at the end of the present quarter.
McDowell has held both positions
since September, 1918.
"We wish," President Wilbur said in
his answer to McDowell, "to take full
advantage of your wide knowledge of
the alumni, particularly at this time when
we are entering upon a new period in the
life of the University, and when our
future will depend largely upon the in
terest and help that will come to us
from our alumni and former students.
A position of alumni secretary, or per
haps alumni registrar, together with
your occupancy of the office of academic
secretary, will give the University the
opportunity of getting the benefit of
your services in bringing the alumni and
the University into close association."
For many years McDowell lias served
the Alumni Association as secretary of
its executive committee through annual
election of the association. Four years
ago he was appointed alumni secretary
on the University staff, attached to the
president's office, the two offices, al
though separate, being brought into har
monious operation through his holding
both.
During the war President Wilbur
asked him to serve as Dean of Men also,
and the time and labor required for this
task lias interfered with the development
of the alumni work and threatens to
break his health. '
One of the immediate tasks that the
president has asked the alumni secretary
to undertake is to get into touch with all
men and women whave been students at
Stanford but have not taken a degree at
tbe University, in order to bring them
into closer relations with the University
than they have ever occupied. An alum
ni directory will be published this year,
in which the names of these students aÂ»
well as those of the graduates will be
included. This will require several
months of hard work in preparation.
Tbe last directory of the sort was pub
lished in 1910, when it was planned to
issue such a publication every ten years.
At that time the names of former stu
dents who had not received degrees were
printed, but no details of their activities
since leaving the University were includ
ed, as was done with the graduates. In
the forthcoming volume such matter
will be given for all former students,
whether they graduated or not.
McDowell plans also to devote more
time than has been possible recently
to the campaign for money to erect a
War Memorial bulding on the campus.
He will visit alumni centers in various
parts of the country, also in order to
keep former students more closely in
formed of University activities and
plans;
The Dean was graduated from Stan
ford in 1900, and for twenty-four years,
including a portion of his undergradu
ate period, when he was a member of ;
the Registrar's staff, has been in the
service of the University, the last ten
years as Alumni Secretary. During
his tenure of the latter office there
has been a steady development of the
recognition of the alumni as a resps- j
ible and important body in the con-'
duct of University affairs, a recogni-1
tion which is given additional em-'
phasis by the recent action.
