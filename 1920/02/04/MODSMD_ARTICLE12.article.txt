# THETA XI BASKETERS WIN THIRD VICTORY
## 
### 
Theta Xi added a third to its two
previous victories in the intramural bas
ketball league yesterday by defeating the
Breakers by a score of 28 to 4. The
Chinese Club quintet scored only five
points in a match with Kappa Alpha,
permitting their opponents to shoot
eleven field goals. The only close scrap
of the day was the contest between San
Jose and Beta Theta Pi. The final goal
thrown by the Betas was needed to over
come the strong teamwork of the Gar
den City basketeers, making the score
22 to 20, in favor of the fraternity.
An extra heavy schedule has been ar
ranged for tomorrow, as follows: Delta
Kappa Epsilon vs. Sequoia Second Floor,
Phi Delta Theta vs. Encina East Base
ment, Encina Kast Second Moor vs.
Alpha Delta Phi, Sigma Chi vs. Sequoia
First Floor, Zeta Psi vs. Chi Psi.
