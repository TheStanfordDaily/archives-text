# DR. TULLY C. KNOLES DELIVERS ADDRESS
## Tests of Democracy Are Discussed by President of Nearby College 
### 
"The final test of democracy is the
quality and the number of the citizens
which it can produce," said Dr. Tully
C. Knoles, President of the College of
the Pacific, in his address on "The
Ultimate Tests of Democracy," at the
Little Theater last evening.
Dr. Knoles approached his subject
from the three different angles of
democracy; political, industrial, and
social, with special attention to the
first. Beginning with the statement
that the test of political democracy is
representation, he described the evo
lution of political democracy in Eng
land, the source of modern democrat
ic institutions.
France has never met the test of
democracy, according to Dr. Knoles,
for she can not accomplish political
changes without revolution; she ac
cepts all or nothing. In contrast to
France, America has met the test
most brilliantly; a new party enter
ing into power builds upon what has
already been developed, instead of
tearing down, and beginning all over
again. Thus, in America, representa
tion is perpetual; policies of one age
continue their influence on into the
next.
In explanation of the fact that the
American tendency is toward two
parties, and the continental toward
many more, l)r. Knoles said that party
division in the United States is per
pendicular, differences are in belief
only; people of widely divergent social
status may belong to the same party,
while in Europe the division is hori
zontal ; social position determines the
individual's political party.
In discussing social democracy, Dr.
Knoles stated that the test lies in
equal functions of citizens, as such.
White men and negroes, for instance,
can never be exactly equal, yet it is
possible for them to have the same
privileges of citizenship. Social dem
ocracy presents a more delicate and
vexing problem, one in which count
less prejudices must be conquered.
"Labor could elect the next presi
dent if its forces were properly organ
ized and marshaled," was the state
ment with which Professor Knoles
began his consideration of industrial
democracy. Yet, there is no danger
of such an occurrence as labor will
not and can not completely organize.
Here in America, the lines of distinc
tion are not filearly drawn between
labor and capital; people are not de
finitely relegated to one class or an
other.
Dr. Knoles spoke of the numerous
experiments in industrial democracy
which have been made since the war,
and of the efforts to establish industri
al democracy through legal means.
Neither amount of production or pro
fits are tests rial democracy,
said Dr. Knc ather the appli
cation of ec. inciples of pro
duction to pr and the attitude
of employer uployees. The
ideal conditi Is that employ
ers and emp u an equal foot
ing.
