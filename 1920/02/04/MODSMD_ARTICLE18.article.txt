# LEARNING HOW TO BEGIN
## 
### 
MUCH valuable paper is wasted by pedagogues who spend their time telling
that college men are destined to be the leaders. Their inference is that
a college education is an open sesame to the doors of success and the gates
of heaven. If we believe all we hear, we would think that when one has been
granted his diploma he has attained all knowledge.
Fortunately this is not true. Some college men and some college women
will be some of the leaders in life. But every berth near the top of the
ladder will not be occupied by the erudite. Far from it. If the majority of
places are held by college graduates it will be because these persons have
learned how to begin.
This is the great thing that every man and every woman should get out
of college—the knowledge that will enable him to begin right. The man
who takes every course in every scientific school in the country will not be
able to build as good a bridge or lay as perfect a grade as the engineer who
has had real experience—barring, of course, the genius. But this man will
have an immense advantage over the competitor who has not had such
training—barring again the genius. The difference will be that the college
man will have learned how to begin.
This is not true alone of the scientific student. A man with an A.B.
will have similar advantage over the uneducated competitor, whatever line
it is. He will have a more ordered mind, a better regulated habit of thought.
He will be better able to grasp his problems and to solve them. The point
is not that he is to be whisked by, as an Aladdin's lamp to the pinnacle of
success, but that he has a head start in the race.
This is what college students are in college for —to learn how to begin.
The sooner we forget the saying that college men are to be the nation's
leaders, and settle down to the business of earning our places, the better
off we will be. —University of Washington Daily.
