FORMATION of a "Hoover-for-Presi
dent Club at Stanford is made the
object of a meeting of Stanford men
and women to be held in the Stanford
Union Tuesday evening, February 10.
The meeting is fostered by the Quad

that organization last night. On the
other hand, the recently organized Stan

Hoover for the Democratic nomination
for president, falling in line with similar
college Democrats clubs throughout the
country.

States.
"Be It Further Resclved, That a meet
ing of Stanford men and women be held
at the Stanford Union on Tuesday even

forming such an organization."
