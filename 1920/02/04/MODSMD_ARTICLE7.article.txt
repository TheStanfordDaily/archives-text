# TWO ORGANIZATIONS GET BACK OF HOOVER
## HOOVER CLUB PROPOSED Quadrangle Club Calls Meeting; Democrats Urge Candidacy 
### 
FORMATION of a "Hoover-for-Presi
dent Club at Stanford is made the
object of a meeting of Stanford men
and women to be held in the Stanford
Union Tuesday evening, February 10.
The meeting is fostered by the Quad
rangle Club in a resolution passed by
that organization last night. On the
other hand, the recently organized Stan
ford Democratic Club has come out for
Hoover for the Democratic nomination
for president, falling in line with similar
college Democrats clubs throughout the
country.
The feeling of Quadrangle Club is
that the Hoover Club should be strictly
non-partisan.
The resolution follows:
"Be It Resolved, That Quadrangle
Club go on record as favoring the or
ganization of a 'Hoover-for-President'
Club at Stanford with the idea of ad
vocating the candidacy of Herbert
Hoover for president of the United
States.
"Be It Further Resclved, That a meet
ing of Stanford men and women be held
at the Stanford Union on Tuesday even
ing, February 10, for the purpose of
forming such an organization."
The Stanford Democratic Club has
replied to a telegram recently received
from the Democratic Club of the Uni
versity of Virginia, which advocated
Hoover lor the Democratic nomination,
stating a "hearty indorsement"' of the
proposal of the eastern university.
The telegram sent by the Stanford !
Club follows:
"The Stanford Democratic Club read j
with great interest the telegram from
your organization. We commend your
idea of urging the formation of Demo
cratic clubs in the universities of the
country, and will be glad to co-operate j
actively with you in the project. Espe- j
cially welcome is your commendation of
Herbert Hoover, an alumnus and trus- j
tee of Stanford University, as Demo
cratic candidate for president. We be
lieve that his magnificent, non-political,
and personally disinterested achieve
ments during the war, which express so
well the fundamental principles of ideal- j
ism and action of the Democratic party, i
can be duplicated by him in whatever
position he chooses to accept. It is our
earnest hope that the nation will insist
that Mr. Hoover be a candidate for the
nomination at the Democratic conven
tion in San Francisco in June."
The statement in regard to Hoover
which President Ray Lyman Wilbur re
cently issued, has been placed in the
Congressional Record through the mo-1
tion of Senator Chamberlain, Democrat, j
according to press dispatches from
Washihgton.
