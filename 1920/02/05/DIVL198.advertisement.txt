The one big new note that is causing the most
comment and is soliciting the greatest popu
larity is OXFORDS FOR MEN for Spring and
Slimmer, 1920.
New models in both Boots and Oxfords are
arriving daily, and soon we will have as many
models to show you as there are presidential
candidates.
Brogues are going to go strong this Spring
with the younger men—especially for Sports
wear. We are showing some beautiful new
models that are in the best of good taste.
But w r hy talk? The best way to get next to the
new styles is to try them on. Stocks are ready
and we are glad to show you what is going
to be what and what is what whenever you
have time.
A—A snappy new model in Brown Russia Calf.
Priced now at $13l
B—A Nettleton Brogue in finest Norse Calf. Bench
made. $20.
C—A Brogue boot in beautiful Shell Cordovan. $18.
D—A new Peather-Tread model in Brown Russia
Calf with rubber heels. ?$12.50.
And then the feet in Herold's Shoes always
show a clean pair of heels—always well-shod
and never slip-shod. Made of fine materials
over correct lasts. They look well and they
FIT. Get that—FlT COMFORTABLY.
