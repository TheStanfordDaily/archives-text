/GENERAL MEZROP NEWTON
AZGATATION, commander of the
Russian Armenian forces during the
war, will address an University as
sembly next Monday morning at 11
o'clock, in the Assembly Hall. The
subject of his address will be "The
Armenian Situation."
General Azgatatian. on account of
his extensive experience on the mili
tary front before Russia withdrew
from the war and his later work in
civilian relief, is exceptionally well
informed. There will be no difficulty
in understanding General Azgatatian
as it is said that he has a perfect com
mand of English.
The assembly Monday will be the
first assembly held this quarter? The
Committee on Public Exercises is par
ticularly anxious that the students
of the University turn out to hear
General Azagatatian. On account of
Professor Bassett's absence from the
campus last quarter, the University
has not been able to have as many
assemblies as usual.
General Azgatatian comes to the
campus under the auspices of the
Committee for Relief in the Near East.
He has been very active in campaign
work all over the United States in
connection with the drive which is
now under way for funds for the sup
port of the work of the committee.
