thoroughly demonstrated her ability to
character work, and as "Aunt Anne"
she is expected to materially strengthen
the cast.
"Rutherfor and Son" is largely de
pendent upon character work. James
Quinby, '18, in the role of "Martin," is
showing up exceptionally well. Melba
Berry, '22 has another chance to show
up in character work although the part
is of a totally different nature from that

Davis is calling rehearsals for every
afternoon. The cast has to work ex
ceptionally hard on account of the short
time between the present and the date
ofxthe production of the play, "Ruther
ford and Son." is a play is hard to pro
duce using a college cost, on account of
the intense depth of emotional feeling
and the handicap of time only adds to
the difficulties. In spite of this situa

"Rutherford and Son" will be one of
the most succesful plays the Stan
ford campus has seen in some time.
