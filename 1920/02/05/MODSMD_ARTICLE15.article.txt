# CALIFORNIA WILL HAVE SLIGHT EDGE ON STANFORD
## QUINTETS SHOULD PLAY FAST GAME Rival Varsities to Meet at Encina Gymnasium Saturday 
### 
DECAUSE of two wins from Washing
ton State, the California basketball
team will come to the Encina gymnasi
um, Saturday night, a slight favorite
in the eyes of the "dopsters," but
Coach Evans has directed a week of
strenuous practice which' should over
come the advantage of the bruin five.
The freshmen will meet the Oakland
High School quintet, as a preliminary
contest to the Stanford-California
match.
Although the Blue and Gold squad
defeated the northern team in both
games, the relative strength of the
Stanford and California teams against
Washington State stands about par.
The teams will meet each other next
Saturday night, neither one confident
of victory. The breaks of the game
should decide the victor.
Coach Hollander of the U. C. squad
will place his hopes of winning in the
ability of Jack Symes and Eggleston
to hit the basket, while he is expect
ing Majors and Russell to handle the
Cardinal goal shooters.
The Berkeley team will probably be
a heavier aggregation than the Stan
ford quintet, but may be outplayed by
the speed of the Cardinal men, who
are faster and work with more team
work.
Captain Pelouze will not be able to
go in this first game of the Stanford
-California series, but will be in con
dition to enter the second game which
will be played against the California
five on the following Saturday night.
A third game of the series will be
played if necessary, on March 6.
