# COMMANDANT EXPLAINS COMPENSATION RULES
## Right to Draw $12 Allowance Limited to Advanced Students 
### 
Misunderstanding has arisen, declared
Captain S. M. Parker today, over the
commutation of rations allowed certain
members of the R. O. T. C. unit by the
War Department. The right to draw
the commutation, which has been set at
$12 a month, is dependent upon the com
pletion of the two years' basic military
course. Only those actually enrolled in
the advanced course are entitled to the
monthly allowance.
Attendance at last year's S. A. T. C.
is counted as the equivalent of a full
year's work of the basic military course.
Any one who lias attended a previous
summer R. O. T. C. camp, whether in
the army or in school, is excused from
enrollment in the Stanford summer
camp, which is required of all those re
ceiving the ration allowance.
