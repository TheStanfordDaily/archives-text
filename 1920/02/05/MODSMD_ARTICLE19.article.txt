# McMOWELL-ALUMNI SECRETARY
## 
### 
WITH the announcement yesterday of the resignation of J. E. McDowell as
Dean of Men, leaving him to continue as Alumni Secretary, there comes
to Stanford an opportunity to really get in touch with their alumni. Most
of us can see that if the Alumni Secretary's work is made what it ought to
be, that there will be no time to devote to the work of the Dean of Men, and
vice versa. Two men should fill these offices and we are glad to see that the
administration has realized this.
No wiser choice could have been made than to select McDowell to con
tinue the work as Alumni Secretary. Having served the University for
twenty-four years, he undoubtedly knows more about Stanford Alumni than
any other one man. He has previously served as secretary of the Executive
Committee of the Alumni Association, and for the last four years has been
the Alumni Secretary attached to the University Staff. While these two
offices are separate they have been united in the administration of one man.
McDowell should make an ideal Alumni Secretary.
Heretofore Stanford has not kept in as close touch with its alumni as
it should. Even more noticeable has been the disregard of men and women
who formerly attended Stanford but who for one reason or another never
graduated and as a result are not in the ranks of alumni. All universities
are beginning to realize the benefits to be derived from the aid of their
alumni and their former students, and are making every effort to keep up
their interest in their alma mater. President Wilbur expressed this opinion
when he said "Our future will depend largely upon the interest and help
that will come to us from our alumni and former students."
The publication this year of a new Alumni Directory which will con
tain the names, addresses, and occupations of all former Stanford students,
will be the first big effort to again get in touch with alumni and former stu
dents. The decision to incorporate the names of every former Stanford man
dent in this book is the first step towards making that group a real part of
the University. The decision to make the Alumni Secretary's work a posi
tion in itself is the second step. Anything that leads towards a closer union
of students, former students and alumni should be encouraged.
