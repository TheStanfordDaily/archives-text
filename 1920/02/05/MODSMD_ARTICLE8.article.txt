# NEW PARTY COALITION FOR HOOVER IS PROPOSED
## NON-PARTISAN CLUB IS DESIRED Organizers Want Republicans And Democrats to Come In 
### 
rjOALITION of the Republican, Dem
ocratic and non-partisan political
elements on the campus, with the aim
of advocating the non-partisan candi
dacy of Herbert Hoover for president
of the United States, is the goal which
has been announced by the sponsors of
the proposed "Hoover-for-President"
Club. Organization of the club will be
effected at a meeting to be held in the
Stanford Union next Tuesday evening,
February 10.
The sponsors referred to arc the
members of the Quadrangle Club, who
have passed a resolution advocating the
candidacy of Hoover, and who are or
ganizing the meeting Tuesday night.
These men affirm that the Hoover Club
is to be a purely student affair, the aim
of which is to make a Stanford man the
next president.
This club will be the third political
organization to come into existence on
the campus this year. The Democrats
and Republicans already have organized
party clubs, and each claims a large
membership. The organizors of the
Hoover Club hope to claim every stu
dent on the campus as a member, thus
swallowing the other two clubs in so
far as the presidential race is concerned.
The Democratic Club has just sent a
telegram to a similar club at the Uni
versity of Virginia, commending the ac
tion of the eastern club in advocating
Hoover's candidacy on the Democratic
ticket. The Hoover Club backers hope
to gain the support of the Democratic
Club in the campaign to gain Hoover
the non-partisan nomination.
On the other hand, the Republican
Club was organized in the first place
with purely Republican ideas and ideals.
How the members of that club will take
to the Hoover idea is a question to be
settled by the future.
Interesting sidelights on Hoover were
given out by the Quadrangle Club today.
Every one on the campus knows that
he graduated from Stanford with the
Class' of '95. His undergraduate days
in Stanford saw him as the first Student
Manager (now Graduate Manager). In
that capacity he organized athletics finan
cially.
He practically founded the Stanford
Union himself, and that fact makes the
Union a fitting place in which to organ
ize the Hoover Club. He gave the first
$I,(XK) for the building of the Union and
his contributions since then total $11,000.
He picked out his present homesite on
the hill while he was a student here.
Mrs. Hoover is a Stanford woman, hav
ing graduated from the same department
—Geology and Mining—as her husband.
Both men and women are asked to
attend the organization meeting next
Tuesday night.
