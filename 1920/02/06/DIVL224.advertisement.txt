The Old Darkey on the
Wharves of New Orleans
Yells to His Partner
"Tote Fair"
That means, in Southern
darkey dialect "Carry Fair" or
be fair in what you lift. This
admonition can well be applied
to your eyesight. "TOTE FAIR"
with your vision. Your eyes
will never go back on you unless
they are abused. Protect them
with correctly fitted glasses.
