Let s do the darn
job together"
— Ches. Field
WHY is it that more and more
smokers (millions now) are getting
together with Chesterfields?
First of all, fine tobaccos. Our own
buyers in the Orient send us the pick of
the finest Turkish varieties (Xanthi,
Cavalla, Smyrna and Samsoun). We
blend these by a accret method with
specially choice Domestic leaf.
This method brings out new qualities
of flavor—a smoothness, a richness, a
mellowness that £o right to the spot.
That's the reason Chesterfields satisfy
And remember —"Satisfy" is Chester
field's secret, based on o: r own private
formula, which cannot be copied.
Every package has a moisture-proof
wrapping—another reason for Chester
field's unchanging quality of flavor.
