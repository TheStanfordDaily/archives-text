scries. Both teams have a stronger de
fend than offense. Berkeley will start
the game with Majors and Green at the
positions of guard, while Stanford will
start with Lilly and Adams. The coaches
of both teams are relying on their
guards to win or lose the intercollegiate
match. The announcement of Lilly in
the Cardinal line-up came as a complete
surprise from the coach this morning
He will be back in his position of guard
which he held last year.
The two men who will jump center
are about evenly matched. Mills will
start at center for the Varsity, while

will go in at the forward positions.
