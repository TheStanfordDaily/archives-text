# P.A. MARTIN WILL GIVE ADDRESS TO DEMOCRATIC CLUB
## 
### 
Professor P. A. M&rtiri, of the His
tory department will address a pub
lic meeting of the Stanford Demo
cratic Club next Wednesday evening,
at 7:30 p.m., at the Women's Club
House. His subject will be "The Mexi
can Situation." Professor Martin has
spent considerable time studying con
ditions in Mexico, and is today one
of the foremost authorities on the sub
ject in America. The address will be
of particular interest in that there is
a possibility that the Mexican policy
of the administration may become one
of the issues of the next political cam
paign. His address, however, will not
touch any of the political phases of
the subject. Professor Martin has but
recently returned from Washington,
where he was secretary of the Pan-
American Congress which recently
held its conferences there.
