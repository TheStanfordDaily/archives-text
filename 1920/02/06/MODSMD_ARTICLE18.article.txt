# "THE KIND OF A MAN FOR PRESIDENT"
## 
### 
STANFORD supporters of Herbert Hoover for President of the United States
will meet in the Stanford Union, Monday night, at 7:45. The purpose of
the meeting, which is being sponsored by Quadrangle Club, is to organize a
"Hoover-for-President" Club. Every man and every woman who feels that
Herbert Hoover is the man for the presidency is wanted at this meeting. It
makes no difference whether you are a member of the Rpublican, the Demo
cratic, the Socialist or any other political party. The idea is simply to sponsor
Herbert Hoover for President regardless of party lines.
The New York World of January 21 says, "We should be glad to support
Mr. Hoover as the Democratic candidate for President on a platform that rep
resents the historical principles of the Democratic Party. We should be glad
to support him as an independent candidate on a platform of progressive liber
alism. We should not hesitate to support him as the Republican candidate on
a platform representing the kind of government which Mr. Hoover has ex
emplified in his public career."
Today there does not appear to be any real vital differences between the
two political parties, Party lines as formerly known have disappeared. In
fact partisan objections to Hoover, are really arguments in his favor for such
objections are coming from political manipulators and not from the people.
A voter today can be a good Republican, and favor Hoover, or he can be a
good Democrat, and favor Hoover.
This week's issue of Life says"It has been very funny to read the com
ments of the politicians. Most of them insist upon knowing whether Hoover
is a Republican or Democrat. To them that seems important. To the people
who want Hoover that seems not important at all. Like the World, they will
vote for him whichever party nominates him, though doubtless it is expedi
ent for technical reasons that one of the great parties should accept him as
a candidate."
"For itself, the World does not care whether Mr. Hoover calls himself
a Democrat or a Republican or a Progressive or an Independent. He is the
kind of a man that ought to be President of the United States, and he is the
man the World intends to support for President of the TJnitd States regard
less of all the artificial barriers of a debased and discredited partisanship."
These papers express the exact ideas that we hope to see the Stanford
"Hoover Club" take. We want to see the Union crowded with supporters of
Hoover when the meeting is called Monday night.
