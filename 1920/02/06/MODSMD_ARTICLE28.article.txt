# Quad Jolly-Up to Chase Friday, Thirteenth, Jinx
## 
### 
Friday the thirteenth, is the very
inauspicious date that has been se
lected by the "1921 Quad" organiza
tion for its jolly-up. Quad dances are
annual and their purpose is to
provide additional funds for the
Junior year-book. Fifty cents in ad
vance will cover the cost of jollying
up to the strains of something new in
the campus orchestra line, a week
from tonight. "Jinx Day" stunts of
an annual nature will drive away the
usual Friday the Thirteenth gloom.
