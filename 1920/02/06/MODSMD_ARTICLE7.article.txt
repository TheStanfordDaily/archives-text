# INTRAMURAL QUINTETS HAVE CLOSE CONTESTS
## 
### 
Yesterday's games of intramural bas
ketball proved to be the closest contests
of the week in the inter-house league.
Phi Delta Tlieta maintained its lead in
the Third League by defeating the East
Ikisement men of Eucina, 28 to 9. A
better brand of ball enabled Delta Kappa
Epsilon to appropriate the winning end
of a 15 to 11 score in their contest with
Sequoia, Second Floor. Alpha Delta
Phi showed their ability to pass the ball
but the goal shooting forwards of the
Second Floor (East) Encina men gave
the victory to the Hall men by the
score of 17 to 8. The biggest score of
the day was run up when the quintet of
Sigma Chi scored 28 points and held
their opponents, the First Floor men
of Sequoia, down to a solitary point,
gained by the throwing of a free goal.
The close match of yesterday's series
was between Zeta Phi and Chi Psi, the
former throwing nine field goals while
the latter made 22 points.
