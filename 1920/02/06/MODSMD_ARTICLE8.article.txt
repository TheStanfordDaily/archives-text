# HOOVER MEN CHANGE MEETING TO MONDAY
## STUDENTS WILL SPEAK Men and Women Urged to Attend Organization Meeting 
### 
Backers* of Herbert Hoover will or
ganize their "Hoover - for - President"
Club next Monday night at 7 :45 o'clock,
instead of Tuesday night. The organ
ization meeting will be held in the Stan
ford Union, as previously intended. The
change in the date was made necessary
because of the open meeting the Republi
can Club already had planned for Tues
day night, at which time Samuel Short
ridge, a prominent San Francisco attor
ney, will deliver a political address."
Efforts are being made by the Hoover
men to have all campus organizations
shorten their regular Monday night
meetings in order that a large represen
tation may be present at the Hoover
meeting.
Three student speakers will address
the Hoover Club meeting, but the names
of the speakers have not yet been an
nounced. These speakers will outline
the general purposes of the proposed
club. Following their talks, the meeting
will be thrown open for general dis
cussion.
The organizer , arv urging men and
women both to attend this meeting and
confidently expect that they will be able
to tell Hoover the entire Stanford cam
pus is back of him.
