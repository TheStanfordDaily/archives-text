# DEMOCRATIC CLUB MAKES STATEMENT
## Organization Brands Attempt At Coalition Wholly Impossible 
### 
The stand that the Stanford Demo
cratic Club will take in regard to its
relation with the proposed "Hoover
for-President" Club was outlined today
in a statement issued by the club. In
the main part the local Democrats
object to any kind of an alliance with
Republicans for either the formation
of a third party supporting Hoover or
a dual nomination of that candidate.
Nevertheless, the Democratic Club, for
its own part is "heartily in favor of
Mr. Hoover for President."
Th statement in full, follows:
"The Stanford Democratic Club is
heartily in favor of Mr. Hoover for
President, and is actively urging his
nomination in San Francisco in June.
It is similarly in favor of any move
ment to stimulate the Hoover senti
ment. We cannot but feel, however,
that any attempt to form a coalition of
Republicans and Democrats with a
view of launching a third party is
utter folly, and tends to nullify the
very purpose which those who favor
Mr. Hoover have in mind —namely, to
make Mr. Hoover the next President
of the United States.
"If, on the other hand, the present
move is an attempt to unite Democrats
and Republicans with view to a dual
nomination of Mr. Hoover, the situa
tion is equally impossible. A political
party is organized to advocate prin
ciples, and to sponsor the men who
hold such principles, and are best
fitted to execute them. The issues
of the Democratic party are squarely
defined. These issues, the Republi
can party is fighting, tooth and nail —
a look at the United States Senate and
the issue of the League of Nations as
it stands before that body will prove
that to even the most doubtful.
"Advocacy of Hoover must come
about by one party or the other by
reason of Mr. Hoover's adherence to
the principles which one of these
parties stands for. Only by the height
of insincerity could he allow himself to
be sponsored by both parties. Mr.
Hoover declared himself squarely in
favor of the League of Nations in an
address delivered here last October.
The Republicans are set against the
League of Nations. The Stanford pub
lic voted overwhelmingly in favor of
the League of Nations. Mr. Hoover
urged the election of a Democratic
Congress in Nov., 1918. If his advice
had been listened to our position
in regard to the treaty would not now
be in its present chaotic state. Mr.
Hoover's entire policy has been in co
ordination with the liberal and pro
gressive policies of the Democratic
party. To consider him as a candi
date on a platform of the present Re
publican issues—which are counter to
all he has done and said during the
last five years, would seem impossible.
Mr. Hoover's position may be seen by
the fact that whereas William Ran
dolph Hearst is backing Senator Lodge
and the Republicans, he is violently
attacking both the Democratic party
and Mr. Hoover. The San Francisco
Chronicle, a strong Republican paper,
cuts out Mr. Hoover's name wherever
possible in all news stories wherein
he is mentioned.
"The Democratic Club cannot com
promise its principles by uniting with
representatives of these elements in
any fashion. While it approves any
organization which crystallizes per
sonal sentiment for Mr. Hoover, it
does not consider it either in keep
ing with the principles of Democracy,
or with Mr. Hoover's position to at
tempt to give it compromised and in
sincere political color."
The Stanford Democratic Club."
