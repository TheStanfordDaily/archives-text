# GENERAL AZGATATIAN MAKES PLEA FOR ARMENIANS
## RUSSIA WITHELD NEWS OF TROOPS General Asks For American Support of Armenian "Ideal Republic" 
### 
General Merzog Azgatatian made an
impressive plea for Armenia in an ad
dress on "The Armenian Situation" at
the Assembly Hall this morning. He
spoke with a dramatic intensity which
was unusually effective on account of
General Azgatatian being an Armenian
himself and having such a perfect com
mand of the English language.
On account of the secret treaty be
tween England and Russia, according to
General Azgatatian, Russia withheld any
mention of the Armenian troops, and
therefore little is known about their
heroic valor. The Armenians did not
hesitate to ally themselves with the Rus
sians although tremendous pressure was
brought to bear on them by the Turks.
Territory and a guarantee for an Ar
menian republic was offered to the Ar
menians and, although this was an ideal
toward which the Armenians had strug
gles for generations, they still swung
their support to the side of the Allies.
As a request of this step, the 1 urkish
massacre came and the practice of de
portation of the Christians was en
couraged.
General Azgatatian gave a very graph
ic description of an incident in which
the Armenian and Russian troops were
completely surrounded by the Turks.
Step by step General Azgatatian de
scribed how the Armenians drove back
the enemy by their valiant fcourage and
terrific fighting. He also told of the
work of the Armenians at Verdun and
also of the large number who served in
the United States army.
The closing plea for America to stand
by Armenia and see that she was given
the opportunity to rule herself was par
ticularly effective.
General Azgatatian was commander of
the Russian Armenian divisions and was
brought to the, United States under the
auspices of the Committee for Relief in
the Near East.
