# COAST TRYOUTS FOR OLYMPIAD NOT YET GIVEN TO STANFORD
## 
### 
According to word received today
from Secretary Rubien of the Olympic
Games Committee in New York, his
organization is at present deliberating
on the choice of a location for the
Pacific Coast Olympic Game tryouts,
and the award will be made in the
near future.
Stanford's request for the trials, sent
by letter, dated January 20, reached
New York headquarters after wires
from Los Angeles, announcing its ap
plication. and dated January 21. Both
proposals were made public by the
committee at the same time, and
neither given the preference. A tele
phone call was received by Rubien
from president Humphrey, of the
Olympic Club, asking for information
as to the committee's decision on the
matter, and backing Stanford's re
quest.
