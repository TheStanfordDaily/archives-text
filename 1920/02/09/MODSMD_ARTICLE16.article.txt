# HOOVER BACKERS WILL ORGANIZE CLUB TONIGHT
## SPEAKER WILL TELL HIS PURPOSES U.C. Also Steps Into Hoover Lists With Student Club 
### 
"Hoover for President," regardless of
his personal party affiliations. That is
the principle upon which the Stanford
"Hoover for President" Club will come
into existence in the Stanford Union to
night. The meeting will be called at
7:45 with D. B. Carroll, '16, as chair
man.
Three students will address the meet
ing. J. G. Driscoll, '18, will be the first
speaker and will discuss Hoover's qual
ifications for the presidency. Driscoll is
recognized as one of the best speakers
on the campus, and he has made a care
ful study of his subject.
H. H. Hoss, '18, will discuss the neces
sity of students to take an active part
in politics. He will urge the affiliation
of every student on the campus with
the "Hoover for President" Club.
F. L. King, '19, president of the Asso
ciated Students, will have as the subject
of a speech the reasons for, and possi
bilities of, a Hoover Club on the cam
pus.
As outlined by the organizers of the
proposed club, it will be Hoover as
Hoover that the club will back. His per
sonal party affiliations will be immaterial,
and in that sense the club will be free
from any party affiliation itself.
Following the three talks, the meeting
tonight will be thrown open to general
discussion. It is hoped by the backers
of the club that ideas will be forthcom
ing from those present. Both men and
women are urged to attend.
A Herbert Hoover Club already has
been formed at the University of Cali
fornia and has a membership of 100 men
and women. Professor Thomas H.
Reed, of the Political Science Depart
ment of the University of California, and
once executive secretary to Hiram John
son, when lie was governor, addressed
the organization meeting of the Califor
nia Club. His address, as given by the
Daily Californian, the student daily at
Berkeley, was in part as follows:
"I am for Hoover for President of
the United States because:
"1. Our country faces the most seri
ous international problems of its history.
It requires for its president a man fa
miliar with international affairs—one
who is afflicted neither by sentimehtal
ism nor narrow provincialistp in his
views of America's future in the world.
No other American citizen posseses this
qualification in such marked degree as
Herbert Hoover. He has shown him
self a match for foreign diplomats. He
lias the respect of the whole world.
"2. Our national government must in
the next four years reconstruct its ad
ministrative machinery upon a peace
time basis. It must practice economy
without sacrificing any essential service.
It must lift the burden of taxation from
the shoulders of the public. This task
calls for an administrator of the highest
order. Such an administrator Hoover
lias proved himself to be. Eyery other
man even remotely mentioned for the
presidency is decisively his inferior in
demonstrated capacity to manage colos
sal enterprises.
"3. The American people have before
them serious problems of social and eco
nomic adjustment. They call for the
leadership of a man both wise and
strong —a man of broad social sympa
thies, extensive knowledge of the work
ings of commerce and industry, of the
will determined to hold in check every
element of disorder. Hoover has shown
in his public career that these qualities
are his qualities. The tact and courage
with which he handled Belgian relief un
der German accupation are needed to
meet the industrial crisis of today. No
other candidate has such a record or ex
perience.
"4. In any tour-year period—most cer
tainly in that which is coming—questions
are thrust upon a president calling for
I an open mind and an undivided allegi
ance to public duty for their satisfactory
solution. The old-time leaders of both
parties have shown in the momentous
issue of the treaty of peace a spiril of
narrow partisanship which disqualifies
them for future leadership. We can ex
pect nothing of such partisans but par
tisanship. Hoover is not a politician nor
an active partisan. He is simply an
American.
"5. When all of the qualifications re
quired of a successful president are
taken together, the superiority of
Hoover to every recent aspirant is still
more obvious. He has a combination
of qualities—knowledge of foreign rela
tions, administrative skill, business ex
perience, social vision, tact, courage, and
untrammelled Americanism —which no
rival can boast. They can surpass him
in one thing only—talk, and we have
had enough of political babble.
"As a Republican I shall vote for him
in the presidential primary because I
believe that the party which nominates
him will desejve success. As an Ameri
can citizen I shall strive to contribute
to his elcctoin, irrespective of partisan
considerations."
