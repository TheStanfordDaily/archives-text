# CARDINAL SOCCERITES TIE WITH ALL-STARS
## Quinby and Clark Score Goals For Stanford Team 
### 
Stanford soccerites, weakened by
last-minute losses of regular players,
held the all star San Francisco eleven
to two goals, last Saturday, and by
scoring two themselves, tied the
match.
San Francisco, represented by pick
ed Sunday league players, and the
strongest team the city could putin
the field was outplayed throughout the
last half by the University men in
what, according to bay city papers,
was the best contest of the season.
Goals from the toes of Quinby and
Clark of the Cardinal eleven accounted
for the varsity scores, and saved the
game for Stanford.
The work of the University backs
was the feature of the day, the kick
ink of Robinson sending the ball out
of danger at several crises.
Coach Jim Wylie is planning to put
his men through hard daily drills this
week in preparation for the deciding
California game, which is to be play
ed here next Saturday, as a prelimin
ary to the Cardinal-California rugby
match. Stanford will meet the Cali
fornia soccerites with the strongest
line-up of the year, in spite of losses
and injuries incurred during a long
season of play.
