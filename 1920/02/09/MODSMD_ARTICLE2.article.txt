# FRESHMAN FIVE WINS FROM OAKLAND HIGH
## Babes Are Victorious In Slow Game with O.H.S. Quintet 
### 
With a fast come-back in the second
half, the Stanford freshmen defeated
the Oakland High School basketball
team by a score of 23 to 19, last Satur
day night as a preliminary game to the
Stanford-California match. The score
at half time stood 12 to 10 in favor of
the high-school five.
During the first part of the play, the
liabes seemed unable to either guard
their men, or to hit their own basket.
The Stanford defense was unable to
keep Murphy, Oakland's crack forward,
from making baskets.
Those playing for the 1923 team were:
Rogers, Austin and Piggott, forwards;
Howell and DeGroot, centcrs; Ander
son, Pollard and Carpenter, guards.
