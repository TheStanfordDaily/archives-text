IIIGHT NOW to be as opportune a time as any to express our views
" on what the position of Dean of Men in Stanford University should be.
The resignation of J. E. McDowell, the present Dean of Men, will take effect
at the end of this quarter and the administration must look for a successor
to Mr. McDowell. A few suggestions as to the students' ideas of the Dean
of Men should not be out of place at this time.
In the first place, the Dean of Men should not be the disciplinary officer
of the University. Where the Dean is placed in this position, he is never able
to gain the fullest confidence of the men of the University. Instead of the
impression being that the Dean of Men is the man who is to watch for of
fenders, the contrary should be true. In other words, if a student commits
some offense, the feeling should be that the Dean of Men is the best man to
offer advice and to look after the interests of <he offender. It is obvious that
under a system where the Dean of Men is the disciplinary officer this feeling
of confidence can not exist. It is no fault whatsoever of the man filling the
position, it is simply a fault of the system.
Our idea of a Dean of Men is a man who will represent the interests of
the men of the University in all cases and along all lines. Confidences made
to him would be treated even more confidentially than the lawyer treats those
of his clients, if such can be possible. He would represent the interests of
the' students at all times and in cases necessitating it, would present their
viewpoints to the President of the University. He would be a friend and
advisor, not a policeman.
• Where then should the duty of disciplining, that we propose to take
from the Dean of Men, be placed? The answer to this question is not an
easy one to make. Our idea of where it should be is in the Men's Council
of Student Control. Some one will probably say that that is where it is now.
Others may think it belongs in some other place. Possibly so. We do not
care to argue about that now. Our point is that regardless of where this
power is now, or where it has been in the past, it should never rest in the
Dean of Men. Establish a Dean of Men who will advise and represent the
interests of the men without being a disciplinarian and a position will be
created which would be of immeasurable value to the University, Along
these lines, we offer the suggestion that a Dean of Men secured from our
Alumni will be of more value than one secured from the faculty. An alumnus
will be better able to understand the student viewpoint that a man who has
been a member of the faculty would be.
Everything that we have said in regard to the Dean of Men, also holds
true to the Dean of Women. She should occupy the same place among the
women as we have endeavored to picture the Dean of Men occupying among
the men. For example, if the women of the University should have difficulty
with the Gymnasium Department, we believe that it should be the duty of
the Dean of Women to hear the students' complaints, look into the facts of
the case, and if the facts warrant it, present the women's side of the case to
the President of the University. The Dean of Women should be a confidential
advisor to every woman in the University. If she has really gained their
confidence, she will be able to give them real advice. But under a system
where the Dean of Women is forced to look after discipline, she will not be
able to get this confidence, and so is unable to look truly after the welfare
of the women students.
This editorial is not written in a spirit of criticism, but rather in a frank
attempt to picture the positions of the Deans of Men and Women as the stu
dents think they should be, and as they would like to see them.

to Mr. McDowell. A few suggestions as to the students' ideas of the Dean
of Men should not be out of place at this time.
In the first place, the Dean of Men should not be the disciplinary officer
of the University. Where the Dean is placed in this position, he is never able
to gain the fullest confidence of the men of the University. Instead of the
impression being that the Dean of Men is the man who is to watch for of
fenders, the contrary should be true. In other words, if a student commits
some offense, the feeling should be that the Dean of Men is the best man to
offer advice and to look after the interests of <he offender. It is obvious that
under a system where the Dean of Men is the disciplinary officer this feeling
of confidence can not exist. It is no fault whatsoever of the man filling the
position, it is simply a fault of the system.
Our idea of a Dean of Men is a man who will represent the interests of
the men of the University in all cases and along all lines. Confidences made
to him would be treated even more confidentially than the lawyer treats those
of his clients, if such can be possible. He would represent the interests of
the' students at all times and in cases necessitating it, would present their
viewpoints to the President of the University. He would be a friend and
advisor, not a policeman.
• Where then should the duty of disciplining, that we propose to take
from the Dean of Men, be placed? The answer to this question is not an
easy one to make. Our idea of where it should be is in the Men's Council
of Student Control. Some one will probably say that that is where it is now.
Others may think it belongs in some other place. Possibly so. We do not
care to argue about that now. Our point is that regardless of where this
power is now, or where it has been in the past, it should never rest in the
Dean of Men. Establish a Dean of Men who will advise and represent the
interests of the men without being a disciplinarian and a position will be
created which would be of immeasurable value to the University, Along
these lines, we offer the suggestion that a Dean of Men secured from our
Alumni will be of more value than one secured from the faculty. An alumnus
will be better able to understand the student viewpoint that a man who has
been a member of the faculty would be.
Everything that we have said in regard to the Dean of Men, also holds
true to the Dean of Women. She should occupy the same place among the
women as we have endeavored to picture the Dean of Men occupying among
the men. For example, if the women of the University should have difficulty
with the Gymnasium Department, we believe that it should be the duty of
the Dean of Women to hear the students' complaints, look into the facts of
the case, and if the facts warrant it, present the women's side of the case to
the President of the University. The Dean of Women should be a confidential
advisor to every woman in the University. If she has really gained their
confidence, she will be able to give them real advice. But under a system
where the Dean of Women is forced to look after discipline, she will not be
able to get this confidence, and so is unable to look truly after the welfare
of the women students.
This editorial is not written in a spirit of criticism, but rather in a frank
attempt to picture the positions of the Deans of Men and Women as the stu
dents think they should be, and as they would like to see them.
IIIGHT NOW to be as opportune a time as any to express our views
" on what the position of Dean of Men in Stanford University should be.
The resignation of J. E. McDowell, the present Dean of Men, will take effect
at the end of this quarter and the administration must look for a successor
to Mr. McDowell. A few suggestions as to the students' ideas of the Dean
of Men should not be out of place at this time.
