# Campaign For Benefit Of Convalescent Home Will Be Inaugurated
## 
### 
Plans for a campaign for the benefit
of the endowment fund of the Stanford
Convalescent Home are being made by
members of a committee of which Dr.
D. Charles Gardner is chairman. The
work of the home is maintained by sub
scription, but it is planned by the com
mittee to make the undertaking self-sup
porting by establishing a fund, the in
come of which will be sufficient for the
maintenance of the home. Several thou
sand dollars have already been sub
scribed, and the Women's Service Board
will conduct the drive on the campus,
which will be begun in a few weeks.
The Convalescent Home is the only
Stanford social service activity. It is
for the care of children who have had
free treatment in the Lane Clinic in San
Francisco. They are brought down for
a period of two weeks in order that they
may have proper care while recovering.
There arc at present fourteen children
at the home, which is in the old Acacia
House. The Women's Service Board is
anxious to have women interested in
the children to entertain them at the
home, or take them out walking or driv
ing in the afternoons during the week
and on Sunday.
