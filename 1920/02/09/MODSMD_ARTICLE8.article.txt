# STANFORD BASKETERS WIN FIRST GAME FROM CALIFORNIA FIVE
## BEARS LOOSE BY 27-20 SCORE Opponents are Outclassed by Floorwork of Varsity Players 
### 
With both teams showing up in their
best of form, Stanford defeated the
California basketball quintet by a score
of 27 to 20, when the two teams met last
Saturday night in one of the fastest
matches that has been played on the En
cina court this season. The second game
of the Stanford-California series will be
played in the Harmon gymnasium next
Saturday night, and if necessary a third
contest will take place on March 6.
Outclassing the bruin five for probably
the first time in intercollegiate history in
both floor work and field shooting, the
Cardinal combination annexed eleven
goals to California's five. In the depart
ment of free throwing, however, the
Stanford men showed to a disadvantage,
missing over half their tries, while the
Bruins counted most of their chances
due to fouling.
Righter and Mills were the chief point
winners for Stanford, and Symes ac
counted for all but two of California's
goals.
The Cardinal system, working fairly
smoothly in the first half.and holding
the Bruins to four field baskets, tight
ened noticeably in the second period and
allowed the Bears only one goal from
the floor. More consistency in the con
verting of free throws would have made
the victory one of the clearest ever won
from so dangerous an opponent.
Over 1,200 people crowded the gym
nasium to see the contest and many were
turned away.
