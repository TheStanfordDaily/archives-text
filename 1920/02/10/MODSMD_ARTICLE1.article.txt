# RIVAL VARSITIES WILL PLAY SECOND CONTEST SATURDAY
## TEAMS TIED IN P.C.C Victory For Stanford Will Mean a Double Defeat For California 
### 
STANFORD and California will mix in
a second basketball game, next
Saturday night, when the two varsities
meet on the Harmon gymnasium floor
in Berkeley. Both quintets are tied
in the Pacific Coast Conference, each
having won two games and lost one.
A Cardinal victory in Saturday's con
test will not only put Stanford ahead
of the Blue and Gold team in the P.
C. C., but it will also give the Cardinal
the Stanford-California 1920 basket
ball title.
For the first time in a number of
years Stanford has a chance of win
ning the annual inter-collegite series.
Last week Stanford out-classed the
California team in all lines, except
that of shooting foul goals. During
the practices of this week, Coach
Rvans is planning on his forwards
spending a large amount of their
time shooting fouls. Should Davis
start in the next game, the Coach may
use him for the foul shots.
