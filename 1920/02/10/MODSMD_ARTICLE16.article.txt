# ONE HUNDRED JOIN NEW HOOVER CLUB; SUPPORT PLEDGED
## TELEGRAM FORWARDED J.G. Driscoll is Elected Permanent Chairman of Club 
### 
«AT a meeting of Stanford students
at the Stanford Union tonight, a
'Hoover For President Club' war orga
nized. It was enthusiastically voted
to assure you of the support of Stan
ford students in any course you choose
to pursue."
That was the message sent to Her
bert Hoover in Washington, by the
new "Hoover For President" Club,
organized with a membership of one
hundred students at the Stanford Uni
versity last night. The meeting wan
attended by about 150 students, many
of them claiming membership in the
Stanford Republican Club and Stan
ford Democratic Club.
J. G. Driscoll, '18, was elected presi
dent of the new club. An executive
committee composed of C. C. Crosby,
'19, R. A. Donaldson, '17, J. W. Temple
ton, gr„ B. C. Wohlford, '18, and Miss
Margaret Shedd, '20, was also named.
Other officers will be electd at the
next meeting.
The meeting last night was conduct
ed by D. B. Carroll '16, as temporary
chairman. Following a few words by
Carroll, short talks were made by
Driscoll and F. L. King, '19.
Driscoll characterized Hoover as
"cosmopolitan and composite of Amer
ica." He made three points during
the course of his address: First, that
college students now have a chance to
take a chance on national affairs;
second, that this offers an opportuni
ty to support a Stanford man; and
third, this is an opportunity to per
form a national service by getting a
man who has proved that he is equip
ped for the presidency.
King discussed Hoover's character
istics and his relation to Stanford. He
emphasized the practical side of Herb
ert Hoover's line of work.
When the meeting was thrown open
for discussion, H. L. Leve, '19, a promi
nent member of the Stanford Republi
can Club, declared that the idea of
running Hoover on a purely non-parti
san ticket is impossible. He pointed
out that Hoover had himself declared
that students should affiliate with one
or another of the great parties.
The executive committee, which has
the power of enlarging its personnel,
is composed of Democrats and Repub
licans in part. Crosby already has
affiliated with the Republican Club.
Donaldson has Democratic leanings,
and Miss Shedd, upon her nomination
last night, inquired if being a Demo
crat would bar her as a member of
the Hoover Club. She was told that
that would be no bar.
The club has commenced an active
campaign for members, and will hold
a meeting in the near future for the
election of other officers.
