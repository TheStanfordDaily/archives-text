# Heavy Intramural Schedule Played
## Delta Tau Delta Basketers Run Steam Roller Over Encina Basement 
### 
An unusually heavy schedule of bas
ketball was played in yesterday's con
tests for the intramural cup. Recover
ing from the slump of last week, the
Delta Tau Delta squad ran a "steam
roller" over the west basement men of
Encina. The final score was 39 to 12
in favor of the fraternity. The El
Campo quintet proved itself unequal to
the Beta Theto Phi team, the latter win
ning by a 15 to 4 score. The second
floor men of Encina (east) and Sequoia
were matched together, the Encina men
running their score up to 23 points and
holding their opponents down to three
field goals. The contest between Se
quoia, first floor, and the east basement
men of Encina was the closest scrap of
the day. The Sequoia quintet played a
better brand of ball and edged the En
cina squad out of victory by 14 to 11
score. Alpha Sigma Phi team failed to
appear at the court, giving the fourth
floor men of Encina (west) the credit of
an additional victory.
The following games are scheduled
for Wednesday's contests: Encina East
Fifth Floor vs. S. A. E.; Chi Psi vs.
Encina East First Floor; Phi Kappa
