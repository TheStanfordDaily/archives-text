# QUAD JOLLY-UP COMES ON VALENTINE'S EVE
## 
### 
St. Valentine's eve, and Friday the
thirteenth, will both be celebrated at the
Quad Jolly-lip next Friday night. With
this culmination of favorable dates,
many special features have been ar
ranged by the year-book organization
with an eye to attracting nearly every
one on the campus that has the fifty
five cent admission fee. Pre-eminent
among these features is the orchestra
led by Jack Kegley, which will be im
ported especially from Berkeley for the
Quad Jolly-up. Every one is invited to
attend the affair.
