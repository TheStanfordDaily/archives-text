# New Argeement to Govern Debaters
## Specific Rules Will Control Contest for Joffre Medal 
### 
April 29 has been set as the tenta
tive date for the Joffre forensic clash
with the University of California.
Coach McClintock is in consultation
with the California debating manager
concerning the details of the extem
poraneous debate and expects to an
nounce shortly the definite plans for
the big contest. This spring's scrap
will be held in Wheeler Hall, on the
Berkeley campus.
A new departure in the management
of the annual debate will beÂ« inaugu
rated this year by the drawing up of
;< permanent Joffre agreement between
the two universities. During the two
decades that teams from the rivals
have annually clashed, only a gentle
men's agreement has governed the
contest.
No friction has arisen, declares, M.
L. McClintock, with U. C., but the
lack of a definite understanding often
makes difficult the settling of new
problems. Points constantly arise
concerning which the present informal
understanding makes no provision.
The proposed agreement will be a
codification of the past traditions
which have grown out of the debate
and the rules governing the details of
the contest.
Coach McClintock and George Boaz,
California debating manager, arc now
working on the formal understanding
and expect to announce the plan prior
to the spring contest.
