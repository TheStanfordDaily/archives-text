# OFF TO A GOOD START

THE beginning of Stanford's "Hoover For President" Club was made last
night, when J. G. Driscoll was chosen permanent chairman and an Exe
cutive Committee chosen to work out a policy whreby the demand for Hoover
could be made felt most.
The general sentiment of the meeting was clearly for Hoover regardless
of party affiliations. This is as it should be. It should be Hoover for Presi
dent if he is a Republican or Hoover for President of he is a Democrat. In
fact we do not care what his party affiliations are. The point at issue is
that we want Hoover for President on any ticket he chooses to run.
Under the heading of "Another Viewpoint" today we publish a communi
cation which takes the stand lhat to be effective the Hoover Club must bury
the party hatchet right now. With that we agree. However, we think that
the writer overlooked one point made by the representative of the Republican
Club which was well taken. That point was that it was useless to work for
Hoover from the outside, and that the only way to accomplish anything was
to work from within the party. That we believe to be true. For Hoover to
be elected it will be necessary for one of the two great parties to nominate
him. Consequently as Republicans we can work within the party to endeavor
to secure the nomination for him, and then regardless of which party nomi
nates him, back him in the general election for President. Of course, the
speaker last night went on to show that Hoover was a Republican and favored
that party. We think that this statement would have to be taken with con
siderable grain of salt.
