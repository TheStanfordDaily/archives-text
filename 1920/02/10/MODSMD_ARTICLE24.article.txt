Dear Sir:
To the casual sitter-in on the chris
tening of the Hoover-for-President Club
last night the real high spot of the meet
ing was the strong bid made by a very
able representative of the Stanford Re
publican Club to swing the occasion
into a happy hunting grounds for that
energetic organization. The speaker out
lined a most exurberant vision of Mr.
Hoover as a stand-pat G. O. P. from
the cradle to the Food Commission, with
a prudent favorable word for another
"famous Californian" tfirown in. Now
the significant point is, that if the Stan
ford or any other Hoover-for-President
club is to effectively do business, it must
bury the party hatchet right now. and
come out squarely for Hoover absolutely
regardless of the party affiliations he
may make, or the party nomination
which he may accept. People arc heart
sick of politics, and want policies—
strong, far-sighted policies that will
mean progressive international action
and decisive domestic measures, and
they turn to Hoover as the one man
big enough to fill the bill. As a result,
both national committees, their prudent
ears to the ground, arc right now having
their ear-drums nearly split by the cry
for Hoover that is sweeping over the
country, and consequently a scramble is
scheduled for the claiming and nomina
tion of the man the country wants. And
since it is unlikely that a man of Hoov
er's sagacity will run on an independent
platform in view of the history of such
idealistic adventures. The student who
signs up for a Hoover-for-President
Club must be courageous enough and
far-sighted enough to be ready to sac
rifice party affiliations in the interests of
getting the right man into the White
House in 1 ( )20. The party man who
stands for his party, right or wrong, and
having opinions only by grace of his
national committee, has no place in a
Hoover-for- President Club. The Hoov
er-for-President Club should pledge its
support without reservations to this man
whose good works the whole world has
seen, and should refuse to pin its faith to
an organization whose royalty, ideas and
purposes are controlled by a little con
clave of committeemen in the East.
