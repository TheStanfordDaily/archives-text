" Howdy,
Men,!"
"I just got in from Chi-
This suit I'm wearing, is
the latest Snappy Spring
Style from our old friends,
Hart Schaffner & Marx"
"It's a belter, in a tweed,
built on athletic lines. It is
sure to wear well, and hold
its shape, for it is made of
Pure Virgin Wool
It only cost $45.00."
You can get one like it at-
Roos Bros,
The House of Courtesy"
