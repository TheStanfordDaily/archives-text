## 
### 
i The February Cardinal, which will
be on sale early next week, will con
tain two especially interesting stories,
"Nonnie," by Dale Van Every. '18. and
"The Greater Destiny," by Archie
Binns, '22. Van Every contributed
two noticeable two-part stories to the
Sequoia in the spring of 1917. "Jerry
Mac Gowan," written by him is con
sidered one of the best stories written
by a Stanford Undergraduate. "The
Greater Destiny" is a very unusual
fvpe of story in which influences of
character and race clash with events
to bring about a helpless tragedy of
lives.
The Cardinal for February contains
a diversity of material and illustra
| tions.
