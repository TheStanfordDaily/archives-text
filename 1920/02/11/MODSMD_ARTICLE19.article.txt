STANFORD meets California on the Rugby Field here next Saturday after
noon. When the team trots on the field there should be a good-sized
crowd of Stanford rooters on hand to encourage the Cardinal fifteen. Of
course we realize that rugby is a minor sport here now but even at that it
should be supported as are the other minor sports. Perhaps even more than
ever should we support it this year for all indications point to a Pacific Coast
fifteen being selected for the Olympic Games at Antwerp, Belgium. It is
obvious that if such a fifteen is selected that a majority of the team will be
Stanford and California men.
As an additional attraction Stanford soccer men also meet the California
ans. Student tickets will admit to the game and under such conditions Stan
ford should have a good rooting section in the bleachers when the whistle
is blown.
