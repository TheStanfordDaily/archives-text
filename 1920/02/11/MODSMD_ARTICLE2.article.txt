# PELOUZE MAY PLAY IN LINE-UP AGAINST U.C.
## GAME SATURDAY NIGHT Captain May Be In Quintet For Second California-Stanford Game 
### 
Captain Pelouze will probably be
used in the next basketball game
against the California quintet, Satur
day night in the Harmon gymnasium,
in Berkeley, according to an announce
ment given out by Coach Evans. Pe
louze has been out of the game since
liis injury in the Stanford-Nevada con
test, several weeks ago.
Should the Cardinal captain start in
the game next Saturday night, ho will
be used at his old position of forward,
instead of playing a guard position, as
he has been doing this season. Adams
and Lilly will start the game in the
two guard positions, while llighter and
Mills will probably be used as other
two members of the five.
The squad will be in better condi
tion than they were last Saturday
night. The Harmon court is sixteen
feet longer than the Eencina court,
so the Stanford men will need an ad
ditional amount of endurance.
