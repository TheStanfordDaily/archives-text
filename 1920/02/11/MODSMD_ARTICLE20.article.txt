k KANSAS CITY paper advocates the adoption of a budget system —a sys
tem of "writing it down" —even to the sundaes and eclairs, by the young
women of America. Such a system applied to the University women would
be a wonderful boon to the school, and extensively practiced, would bring
about a real campus democracy.
The budget system would allow each woman to take equal percentages
of "snap courses" —whereas now they are unequally distributed. Dates would
also have to be apportioned, and who can contend this would not tend to
equalization of the inhabitants of Mount Oread?
By the judicial use of this system, the men would be required to buy a
certain amount of cakes, candy, and eclairs for their "beloveds" each week —
all this figured out on an average which would probably amount to five and
one-half cokes, three and one-third eclairs, and seven ounces of gumdrops, or
something of the sort.
This might help, also in the apportionment of wearing apparel at the
sorority house, certain »isters being selected to furnish the hair pins, powder
puffs, dancing pumps, et al, for each semester.
Yes, undoubtedly, the budget system is a grand opportunity for the
women to show their advancement along the path of knowledge and ecen
omy—but let's see. Who'll be the first to try it? —Daily Kansan.
