# Basket Competition Was Very Feeble Yesterday
## 
### 
Yesterday's contests provided the
weakest competition yet seen on the
floor of Encina gymnasium in the race
for the intra-mural basketball cup.
Two games were won by forfeit. The
Alpha Tau Omega quintet were ad
vanced a place in the ranking of their
league by the failure of the first-floor
men of Encina to appear. Phi Gamma
Delta was credited with a victory by
the forfeiting of the Phi Psi team.
The fifth-floor men of Encina (west),
offered 110 effective resistence to the
Off-Campus basketers. The Com
muter team rolled up 38 points and
only allowed their opponents two field
goals and one free throw.
