"Immigration and Democracy' was the
subject of an addres« given by Henry
K. Norton, executive officer of the state
commission on immigration and housing,
before the Cosmopolitan Club Monday
Mr. Norton showed that the chief argu
ment against free immigration from the
Orient is that we may have already
reached the point of diminishing re
turns. Speaking of the argument that
Orientals do not become assimilated, he
sai d:
"We place marriage barriers before
them; we have placed naturalization bar
riers in their path; now we seek to im
pose economic barriers—and we say
they won't assimilate.'"
The address was followed by active
discussion by club members, several
economics professors taking part. No
business meeting was held.
