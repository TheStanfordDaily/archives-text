# FENCING COACH ASKS FOR MORE CANDIDATES
## 
### 
Richard Kahle, coach of the Uni
versity fencing team, today issued a
call for more candidates. He stated
that there is an insufficient number of
men out for the team which is to meet
California on March 12. The men who
began last quarter have discontinued
for one cause or another. The coach
wishes to announce that although,
with only a month in which to work,
a winning team can be developed, and
it is imperative for more men to come
out for the sport at once.
(11 spite of the sparcity of candi
dates, there are some very good men
lo choose from, in his opinion. Among
tboso who are showing to advantage
may be numbered Shephard, P. Thomp
son, E. Hadley, Sr., C. Willis, Sr., J.
Faulds, Jr., R. Richardson, Jr., and
Dir.gley.
