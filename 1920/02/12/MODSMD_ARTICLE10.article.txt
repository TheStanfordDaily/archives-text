# Professor P. Martin Discusses Mexico And Intervention
## 
### 
"It is incumbent upon us as Amer-
I icans to help as best we can in direct
ing public opinion towards a mason
able understanding of conditions in
Mexico, and to approach the subject
with sympathy and friendship," said
Professor Percy A. Martin of the His-
I tory department, in discussing the
| "Mexican Situation" in a lecture given
j under the auspices of the Stanford
1 Democratic Club last evening in the
Women's Clubhouse. Intervention, he
said, if inevitable, should come as a
last resource. "If Mexico's task of
working out her own affairs is found
impossible, the United States must
help her, but as long as it seems pos
sible for her to solve her own prob
lems, we should permit her to do so.
Professor Martin also pointed out
the relation of the Mexican situation
to the coming election.
