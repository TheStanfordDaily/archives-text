# OUR NEW TRUSTEE
## 
### 
THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES in electing John T. Nourse, '00, as one of their
members, have' Beleeted one of Stanford's prominent alumni. Ordinarily
this should meet with great favor among students and alumni. The only
cloud in the sky in this case is that only two weeks ago, in one of the San
Francisco dailies, Judge Nourse was quoted on the fraternity question as be
ing of the opinion that fraternities were all wrong and ought to be abolished.
If this is a true statement of Nourse's opinions on the subject, in all frank
ness, we say that we are sorry to see him put on the Board of Trustees of
the University. This board determines the policy of the University and surely
should be composed of men who are impartial and at the least are willing
to give both sides of the question a fair hearing. With the fraternity issue
at the point it is now, fraternity students and alumni had a right to expect a
man who was at least open to conviction would be elected. They did not
expect that a pro-fraternity man would be chosen but they had a right to
expect that a strong anti-fraternity man would not be chosen.
We are in hopes that Judge Nourse has been misunderstood. An alumnus
on the Board of Trustees should be of great service as he should thoroughly
understand th undergraduate. Judging from the record made in Stanford,
John Nourse should certainly be able to understand him. He was acquainted
with the athletic side of the university life through participation in football
and being a member of the varsity track team. He was also an editor of
the Daily Palo Alto and an associate editor of the "Quad." With such a
broad undergraduate career as this, Nourse should logically prove of great
value to the Board. Since his graduation Nourse has kept in close touch
with the University through the Alumni Association, his service for it cul
minating last year in his election as President of the Alumni Association.
We hope to see Judge Nourse prove a valuable friend on the Board of
Trustees.
