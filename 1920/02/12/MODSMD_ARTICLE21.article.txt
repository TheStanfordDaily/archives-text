ITODAY is the birthday of one of our greatest Americans, Abraham Lincoln.
* Americans should pause a moment to honor the memory of this great
President, and to consider the great principles for which he stood. Lincoln
bid fair to be not only a great war president, but what was more important,
a great president in a time of reconstruction. The United States today is
going through just such a period and it is to be hoped that the administrators
of this country today will consider the principles for which he stood and will
be guided by the ideals for which he strove.
