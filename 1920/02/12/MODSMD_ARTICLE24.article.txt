Dear Sir:
In view of the criticism which has
been directed, through your columns, at
the policy advocated by me at the for
mation of the "Hoover-for-President
Club, it is obvious that an erroneous
opmion has arisen.
Let me, therefore, repeat that I wish
the Hoover Club every success in bring
ing about the result which they desire,
but a result which can be accomplished
only by "playing the game" in the politi
cal sense.
It was not my intention to attempt to
stampede the Hoover gathering into the
ranks of the Republican Club, but to
show that Hoover's nominatioh can be
brought about only by working from
within the party, and in conformity to
the peculiarities of the California pri
mary laws.
A glance at political history will show
that non-partisan movements have al
ways been unsuccessful owing to the
fact that they lacked the vital driving
force of being affiliated with a party,
because it is only through such affilia
tion that the politicians, not only listen
to expressions of -opinion, but solicit
them.
In addition, the California voter has
the favored position of being in one of
sixteen primary states, the importance of
which can not be too strongly empha
sized.
In the old convention states the dele
gates to the National Conventions are
picked by the state party organization
without regard to the preference of the
individual voter, but in California the in
dividual may vote directly at the pri
mary for his own choice of delegates,
but to be entitled to such primary vote,
it is necessary to register party affilia
tion, as there is no non-partisan primary
ballot.
Therefore, I must repeat, that those
who are really desirous of promoting
Hoover's candidacy should register Re
nublican for the primary( which in no
way affects their right to vote for any
candidate at the election in November),
as I believe that a fair inference from
the facts discloses that Hoover lias the
better chance of success by running Re
publican, owing to post-war conditions.
It must not be overlooked that Hoover
was for many years a member of a Re
publican club in New York City, and
that he has, in his statement tQ the press
on February 9th, disclosed the fact that
he was for the League of Nations treaty,
only with such reservations as zvould
guarantee the independence of the
United States.
