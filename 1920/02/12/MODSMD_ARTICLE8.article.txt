# PETITION WILL URGE HOOVER TO BE CANDIDATE
## CLUB ASKS SUPPORT OF CAMPUS Purpose Is To Demonstrate Sentiment That He Enter Race 
### 
HERBERT HOOVER will be urged to
j be a candidate for the President
j of the United States, in a petition that
will be circulated on the campus by the
"Hoover For President" Club, next
Monday.
The petition now being formulated
by the executive committee of the
| new club, will be addressed directly
I to Hoover, and will be forwarded to
I him as soon as it has been circulated
j on the campus.
The petition will simply urge Hoover
i to be a candidate, and will not state
; a preference for any particular po-
I litical party. It will pledge support to
Hoover, however, on any decision he
makes in the future as to his politics.
The members of the Hoover Club re
itrate that it is not the purpose of the
club to urge Hoover as a candidate
of any particular party, but that it is
the purpose of the club to first impress
upon him the desire that he does be
! come a candidate for the presidency,
and then support him after he enters
the race.
Hoover has announced his belief that
the theory of the American govern
ment is bi-party and that a decision
must be made between one or the
other of the great parties. He also has
made the implication that if the senti
ment of the people is that he should
be a candidate for president, that he
would abide by that sentiment. The
Hoover Club has as one of its pur
poses the molding of a strong senti
ment throughout the country to this
effect. The petition which it to be
circulated will, according to members
of the club, demonstrate to Hoover
that it is the sentiment of the Stan
ford community that he should be a
candidate. With this end in view, the
club hopes to have as nearly as pos
sibly a one-hundred percent support
for Hoover on the campus.
The club is urging that every stu
dent should sign the petition notwith
standing his present particular party
leanings. The basis for this is, as
pointed out by speakers at the organi
zation meeting, that Hoover is a Stan
ford man in the lirst place, and in the
second place has demonstrated his
ability as an organizer, administrator
and leader.
