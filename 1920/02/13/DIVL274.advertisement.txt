SAFETY
Uncle Sam's mighty right arm
guards, (lay and night, the door
of America's mint and treasury.
He guards your interest and my
interest that lays there. That
is a service that is in his
mighty power to perform. But
your treasury and my treasury
of eyesighf is beyond the abili
ty of Uncle Sam to watch for
us —and yet it is more useful to
us, individually, than our part of
the U. S. Treasury.
We are the sentinels of our own
vision. If we sleep on watch the
enemies of our eyesight will
steal in and rob.
Do not wait until it is too late.
The protection of your vision is
up to you.
