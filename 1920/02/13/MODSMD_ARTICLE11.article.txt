Seattle, while Cardinal representatives
clash the same evening with the Uni
versity of Oregon in the Assembly Hall.

peting for the dual teams. Of the thirty
who arc now members of the squad,
a half a dozen are seasoned debaters
with a record of successful experience
that assures a high standard for the
debate of next week. Promising new

An interesting feature of this quar
ter's debating is the possibility of Stan

coming contests. Ruth Dickey, '20,
Alice Eddy, '21, and Dorothy Webster,
21, are members of the squad and will
make a strong bid for the varsity team.
