# "FLU" CONDITIONS CAUSE CHANGE OF BASKETBALL GAME
## 
### 
Because of the prevailing health regu
lations in Berkeley due to the "flu," the
second basketball game which was
scheduled to be played between the
Stanford and California quintets on
the Harmon gymnasium court, will
either be played without spectators, or
postponed until March sor 6. Ae defi
nite decision will be reached by Student
Manager Stamp of Stanford, and Grad
uate Manager Nichols of California to
night.
Health officials will not permit the
game to be played with spectators, be
cause of the city ruling against the
holding of meetings where crowds can
congregate. Two other alternatives that
were offered, both of which were refused
by the California adherents. It was sug
gested that the Blue and Gold play an
other game on the Stanford court, or on
an independent court in San Francisco,
but the Bears want the advantage of
playing this game on their own court.
