# NEW LIGHTING SYSTEM TO BE USED IN PLAY
## Scheme Invented by "Dick" Morgan, '17, Will Be Feature 
### 
Plans have been submitted for an en
tirely new system of lighting for the
play, "Rutherford &- Son," to be pre
sented next Friday evening. This is
the llrst time that any such attempt has
been made, and comes as the result of
successful experiments carried out a
short time ago by the well-known Junior
Opera director, Dick Morgan, '17, man
ager and art director of the Majestic
Theater in Los Angeles.
Mood lighting is used under this sys
tem. whereby the light can be directed
to any portion of the stage that might
be wanted. David Belasco is using this
system in bis new productions and has
found it eminently successful. It is
thought that this system will do muck
toward revolutionizing scenic and light
ing effects on the stage.
On account of Morgan's long experi
ence in coaching the Junior Operas, he
knew the stage of the Assembly Hal!
well enough to draw up plans. The work
will proceed under the direction of Le
land Pickering, '20, through whose ef
forts the plans were obtained.
