# SIGN THE PETITION
## 
### 
WHIS coming Monday, Stanford .students are to be put to a test, or to several
tests of loyalty, of intelligence, and of the right to be called conscientious
citizens of a great democracy. A petition asking Herbert Hoover to enter
the contest for the Presidency of the United States, and assuring him of
support in whatever policy he may pursue, will be circulated and all Stanford
is asked to sign it. And the number of names found on the petition at the
end of the day will be the answer of this test. For as to the merit of such
a demonstration of sentiment there is no doubt. Hoover towers* head above
every man MlO is now considered in the political field. And added to tUi3,
he is a Stanford men, and Stanford has a reputation of honoring her sons.
It ie true that Hoover is not in the race for the presidency, but if the people
â– show in no doubtful terms that he is their choice, he will not refuse to ac
cept a nomination, nor will the parlies dare but tender it to him. Of course,
signing one petition will not make Hoover President of the United States.
But every expression of opinion, every demonstration of which way the wind
of sentiment is blowing, is watched, and heeded. At Stanford at least we can
create a Hoover gale, perhaps one which may form the nucleus of an enthusi
asm that will assume no mean proportion. But at any rate, it is the least
we can do. Herbert Hoover has done much for Stanford, Stanford can at
least show some little appreciation by making the petition unanimous.
