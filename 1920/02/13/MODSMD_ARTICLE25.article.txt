## FOOD MAN STANDS FIRM Non-Partisan Attitute Maintained by Stanford Man

We reprint below in its entirety an
editorial from the Fresno Republican, of
February \otli on "Hoover on Nonparti
san ship." Chester H. Rowe 11, editor of
the Republican, has here stated in the
clearest possible zuords, not only his own,
but also the feeling of the Stanford
"Hoover for President" Club, tozvards
Hoover and his candidacy for President
of the United States. —Editor.
However far Herbert Hoover may
have put. himself out of the running
for any party nomination —if he has —
by his declaration of non-partisanship,
he has at least rendered a service to
the millions of nonpartisan American
citizens by expressing more clearly
than most of them could have done it
themselves, the reason for their non
partisanship. Hoover is not opposed
to parties. He believes in them, and
he thinks that there ought to be only
two of them. These two he hopes will
be the historic parties through which
Americans are accustomed to act.
Also, he is not a vacillating person,
who has difficulty in making up his
mind between two propositions. But
he refuses to make up his mind which
party he will stand with until the
parties make up their minds what
they will stand for. He knows what
he stands for, and states it very clear
ly. He will stand with whatever party
stands for that. It is for the parties,
not for him, to make up their minds.
Or in his own language:
"I am being urged by many people
in both parties to declare my allegi
ance to either one or the other. Those
who know me know that I am able to
make up my mind when a subject is
clearly defined. Consequently,* until
it more definitely appears what the!
party ma ringore ctarxl foi>, I rtn\ot
exercise a prerogative of American
citizenship and decline to pledge my
vote blindfolded. I am not unappreci- j
ative of the many kind things that
my friends have advanced on my be
half. Yet I hope that they will realize
my sincerity in not tying myself to
undefined partisanship."
"Pledge my vote blindfolded" and
"undefined partisanship" are phrases
that go to the root of the matter.
Let theie be no more of that superior
sneering contempt on the part of po
litical leaders who ask supercilciously
"Is he a Republican or a Democrat?"
Until they can themselves answer the
question, "What is a Republican?" or
"What is a Democrat?" their own
question is meaningless.
Millions of American voters are ask
ing themselves that question, this
year, and until they get a clear an
swer they will refuse, as Hoover does,
to pledge their votes blindfolded, or to
tie themselves to an undefined parti
sanship. Most of them have tradition
al affiliations with one party of the
other, just as Hoover is traditionally
a Republican, and they would act
more comfortably with the party of
their tradition than with the other.
Each will hope that his own habitual
party will be the one to get right.
But they will not tie themselves to
any party until they know what that
party is going to try to tie them to.
And they will thank Herbert Hoover
for having so clearly defined their po
sition.
