# DELTA CHI DEFEATS CHINESE CLUB TEAM
## 
### 
Yesterday's competition in the race
for the intramural basketball cup of
fered only two uneven games. The
Delta Chi quintet gently ran a steam
roller over the Chinese Club squad. The
fraternity men rolled up 48 points be
fore the concluding whistle stopped the
fast work of their forwards, while the
guards of the winning team kept the
Chinese aggregation down to one field
goal and four free throws. The second
match of the day between Phi Delta
Theta and Sigma Chi resulted in a vic
tory by the former contestants. The
Sigma Chi basketers were able to score
only 6 points and permitted their oppo
nents to score 14 points. The Alpha
Delta Phi quintet failed to appear at the
gymnasium, thus crediting Delta Kappa
Epsilon with a victory.
Saturday's contests have been sched
uled as follows: Delta Upsilon vs. En
cina (east) four floor; Theta Delta Chi
vs. Sigma Nu.
