The Power of Electricity
in Transportation
Generator room of one of the hydro-clcctric
plan! which supply power to the C. M. & St. P.
Some Advantages of
Railroad Electrification
Saving the Nation's coal
Lower maintenance costo.
Greater relißbility and fewer
delays.
Abilitv to haul smoothly I
heavier trains at higher
speed.
Operation of electric locomo
tives unaffected by extreme
cold.
Ability to brake trains on I
descending grades by re
turning power to the trolley.
has leveled out
the Contirrental Divide. The
steam locomotive, marvelous as it is
after a century of development, can
not meet a 11 of the present demandsfor
transportation facilities. Its electric
rival has proved to be far superior.
On the mountain divisions of the
Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul
Railway—the world's greatest elec
trification—giant electric locomotives
today lift an ever increasing freight
tonnage over the mile-high Rockies
and also make traveling clean and
comfortable. They utilize the abun
dant energy of distant waterfalls and
then, by returning some of this
power to the trolley, safely brake the
trains on descending grades. And
their capabilities are not impaired
by excessively cold weather when the
Steam engine is frozen and helpless.
Electricity is the power which
drives the trains of Ntw York City 's
bubway and elevated systems. It
operates the locks and tows the ships
through the Panama Canal. It pro
pels the Navy's latest super-dread
naught, the New Mexico. Electric
mine locomotives have replaced the
slow-moving mule and the electric
automobile has also come to (loan im
portant service. Such achievements
were made possible by the extensive
research and manufacturing activities
of the General Electric Company.
Electricity has become the universal
motive power. It has contributed
efficiency and comfort to every form
of transportation service ami in this
evolution General 1 "lectric apparatus
has played a large part — fiotfi
mighty electric locomotives to
the tiny lamp for the automobile.
