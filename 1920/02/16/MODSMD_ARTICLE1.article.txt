Director Leland Pickering, '20, has
assigned the "straight" leading roles
of Davenport Oystermoor and Agonies
Payne to F. H. Bennett, '22. and D. H.
Riddell, '2:>. The casting of these two
new-comers to these leading parts is
in keeping with th old policy of Ram's
Head in nncivering new dramatic ma
terial on the campus. Schnier, how
ever. is a familiar figure in local
productions, and last year he had a
leading part in "Biff! Bang! ! Bullshe-
veek!!!"
C. E. Arnn, '20, has a rich comedy
part in Three Star Hennessy, who is
hilled as an athlete. The female parts
in the cast and chorus have been given
to female impersonators according to
Ram's Head tradition. Ram's Head
Society is following another of its
customs in withholding the name of
the play until a few days before its
final presentation. This year's show
was written by S. E. Briggs, '19, and
Les Levy, '19, and the musical score
is the result of the work of T. M.
Reynolds, '18, and C. S. Kegley, ex-'IS.
The production will be given on March
12, in the Assembly Hall.
