# Relativity Is Explained In February "Cardinal"
## 
### 
The February issue of the Cardinal,
which will appear the latter part of the
week, will contain an unusual article
by G. R. Harrison, a graduate student
in Physics, o nthe Theory of Relativity.
Relativity has recently come very much
into the scientific and popular limelight
owing to the investigations of the Swiss
scientist Einstein, and to the fact that
his theories were suddenly accepted by
the Royal Society in England, owing to
the unusual observations made during
the astronomical phenomena of Decem
ber 17. 1919.
Harrison's article is non-technical,
and is written with a view to explaining
the general conclusions of the theory to
the average reader, and of destroying
many of the popular illusions regarding
its application in the ordniary affairs of
life.
