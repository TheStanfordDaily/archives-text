"Rutherford and Son," which is to be
presented Friday, February 20.
The play deals with the factory life
and conditions in England, and was
written by Gertlia Sowerby, who has
made herself thoroughly acquainted
with these conditions. Rutherford,
Sr., tyrant and owner of factories is
rebelled against by the members of
his own family. He is not able to rea
lize the tact, that one by one the mem
bers of his family turn against him,
as he believes he is doing all he can
for them, but there is something else.
The play as a whole is instructive,
interesting and realistic. It deals with
facts iVerwoven in a tragedy of
starved hearts.
