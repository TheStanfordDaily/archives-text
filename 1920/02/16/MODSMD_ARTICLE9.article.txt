Four weeks of competition for the
intramural basketball cups have devel
oped a number of consistent game
winning quintets. From the teams
on the Row, the basketers represent
ing Kappa Sigma, Delta Upsilon, Chi
Psi and Theta Delta Chi are mak
ing a determined light tor the league
championship. The dormitory squads
of Encina (west) second floor, Encina
(west) third floor, and El Camino, are
expected by their supporters to make
a strong bid for the cup.
Close competition marked two of
the three games played Friday after
noon. Only a one-point lead enabled
the second-floor men of Encina (west)
to defeat the Theta Xi basketers, the
final score tallying 7 to 6 in favor of
the dormitory men. Close guarding
on the part of both squads prevented
the shooting of few baskets in the
match between El Toro and Zeta Psi.
The final basket shot by the eating
club quintet gave them the victory by
a 8 to 6 score. The San Jose Com
muters proved no match for the team
work of the Breakers team. The score
of the later squad totalled 18 while
they held their opponents down to one
field goal and a free throw.
Two matches Saturday concluded
the schedule for the fourth week of
competition. The game between the
fourth-floor men of Encina (east) and
Delta Upsilon, ended with a one-sided
score of 24 to 10 in favor of the
fraternity. The match gives Delta
Upsilon a fourth consecutive victory,
placing it to the front rank of the
First League. Theta Delta Chi failed
to appear at the gymnasium, crediting
Sigma Nu with a victory.
