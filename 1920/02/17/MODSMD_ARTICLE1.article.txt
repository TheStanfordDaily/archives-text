# OREGON VARSITY FIVE WILL PLAY HERE TONIGHT
## TWO GAMES SCHEDULED Owing to "Flu" Situation at Berkeley Stanford Will Enter Extra Match 
### 
AREGON will meet the Stanford bas
kctball team tonight on the Encina
gymnasium court, at 8 o'clock. There
will be no preliminary game, and an ad
mission fee of fifty-five cents will be
charged those not holding registration
cards. The teams will play a second
game on the Encina floor tomorrow
night.
Stanford was scheduled to meet the
northerners Thursday, but owing to the
"flu" situation around Berkeley, Student
Manager Stamp arranged for Stanford
to take over the California dates. To
play the Blue and Gold tonight, Oregon
would have been forced to play behind
closed doors, so it was decided to meet
California the latter part of the week,
rind play the Cardinal team tonight and
tomorrow night.
With all of the doors and windows of
the gymnasium thrown open, and with
smoking prohibited, the Encina gym
nasium makes an excellent substitute for
an open-air court.
Coach Evans is planning on starting
the game with the same line-up that was
used in the Stanford-California match.
Those scheduled to start playing for
Stanford are: Righter and Davies, for
wards; Mills, center; Lilly and Adams,
guards. The line-up may be shifted by
the coach at the last minute, according
to the way the Oregon men stack up.
Captain Pelouze may be played in his
old position at forward, with Righter.
There has been a steady improvement of
the playing of Butts, so he will probably
he used sometime during the period of
play.
Stanford, according to predictions,
should be able to chalk up another vic
tory in the Pacific Coast Conference
series if the Cardinal squad plays the
same style ball that won in the U. C.
contest.
