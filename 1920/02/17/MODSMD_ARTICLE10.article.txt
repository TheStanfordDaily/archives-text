# Intramural Teams To Play Heavy Schedule Tomorrow
## 
### 
| An unusually heavy schedule has been
I arranged for the intramural basketball
|games tomorrow afternoon and evening.
. The match between Beta Theta Phi and
the third-floor men â€¢of Sequoia, which
was originally scheduled for February
16, has been postponed until Wednesday
afternoon. In addition to this match,
j the schedule calls for the following con
gests: Alpha Delta Phi vs. Encina East
j Basement; Delta Kappa Epsilon vs. En
jcina East Second Floor; Alpha Tau
I Omega vs. Encina East Third Floor;
Off Campus vs. Encina West First
Floor; El Camino vs. Phi Gamma Delta;
Beta Theta Pi vs. Sequoia Third Floor.
No games were played yesterday in
the intramural competition, due to the
j failure of two teams to appear at the
gymnasium. The fourth-floor men of
Encina (east) were advanced one place
in the ranking of their league by the
forfeit of Alpha Sigma. The basketers
of Beta Theta Phi were credited with a
victory through the failure of the Theta
Delta Chi squad to enter a quintet.
