# A 						Tragedy of Love is the Theme of English Club Play

### S. M. Winkelbleck 
For thirty-six years she never loved,
had never been loved, and had never
kept company with the opposite sex.
Can you place yourself in this condition
and realize what your life would mean
to you? Then, to love and to feel that
you have won—to lose and try again?
Can your imagination visualize the sor
didness accompanying such a life; the
isolation from one of the greatest boons
of human nature—love?
Such a life did Janet Rutherford live.
Her father, narrownig his vision merely

to the building up of a great factory sys
tem, could not comprehend the hardship
he was placing on his family. For thirty
six years his daughter was kept in se
clusion from any member of the other
sex. She never had callers, and after
she did love she could not enjoy this
pleasure.
Janet, realizing that her life was be
ing wasted, sought to love Martin, the
foreman of her father's factories. Mar
tin became affectionate, and Janet real
ized her dream, for some one loved her.
Fearing the anger of Rutherford, the
couple kept their love secret, but like
the best of secrets, Rutherford heard
of it. In his rage, he discharged the
foreman. Martin had learned to wor-


James Quinby, '18, and Ruth Elsinger,
'20, in a dramatic moment in
"Rutherford and Son"
ship his employer and 011 being dis
charged, he lost his love for Janet.
Again she must win him. Did she?
The plot is well worked out by Githa
Sowerby in "Rutherford & Son," to be
presented next Friday evening, Febru
ary 20, in the Assembly Hall. Tickets ■
will be placed 011 sale today at the office I
