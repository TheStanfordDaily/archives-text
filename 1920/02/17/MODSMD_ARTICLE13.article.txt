# INTER-SOCIETY DEBATE WON BY EUPHRONIA TEAM
## DECISION IS UNANIMOUS "Closed Shop" is Subject of Argument by the Two Organizations 
### 
ARGUING that the "Closed Shop"
would result in a great labor
monopoly, Euphronia Debating Socie
ty won a unanimous decision over the
Nestoria team at the annual inter
society debate held last evening in the
Little Theater. The decision makes
Euphronia the victor over Nestoria in
23 out of 25 debates held between the
two societies.
The question under discussion was
the one which the University will de
bate in its dual argument against the
Universities of Washington and Ore
gon; namely, "Resolved, That public
opinion should support labor in its
movement for the closed shop."
Euphronia was adjudged superior in
argument. Her speakers contended
that the adoption of the closed shop
would result in a dangerous labor
monopoly that would be contrary to
the best interests of the employers
and the public. They showed that
restriction of output in industries
would result from such a measure,
and that the plan of arbitration ad
vocated by the Third Industrial Con
ference would better meet the inter
ests of nil concerned. The negative
team of Euphronia was composed of
T. E. Bowen, '23; H. A. Fendler, '22;
