# "THE 'DIPPY'S' DECLINE OF PRESTIGE"
## 
### 
IN a letter appearing in the "illustrated Review" this morning, the business
management of the Daily Palo Alto launched an attack against the editor's
policy of the paper in defense of its own shortcomings. Let it be noted that
faults in one department do not excuse those in another.
Frequent allusions are made to the " 'Dippy's' decline of prestige." We
cannot agree with this statement. The Daily Palo Alto has not been allowed
to expand with the constantly growing conditions of the University, and in
view of this fact, we believe that the Daily Palo Alto has maintained a
prestige expected from this size paper against amazing difficulties.
One of the most hampering difficulties is the proportion of space devoted
to advertising in comparison to that given over to reading matter. Our form
er editor, consequently, suggested cutting down the advertising as the busi
ness management had apparently lost all sense of proportion of the proper
relation of the two. It would not seem unreasonable that the editor should
have some check upon this ridiculous situation. Any edition of the Daily
Palo Alto will illustrate our point. "The little surplus earnings" turned
over to the student body are earned at the expense of the best interests of
the paper.
To quote again concerning advertising u "even the appearance of an over
supply of advertising can often be traced to the editor, since the printer is
often called upon to throw in dead advertising to fill up space." This state
ment is absolutely unjustified. Since October 1, only cnce to our knowledge,
has a dead ad been used and that was a small three-inch classified adver
tisement. At 110 time has this been a common practice.
We feel convinced that with very little difficulty, given the facilities,
we could put out a seven-column paper. To this end the editor will do every
thing in her power to make such a paper possible.
The amount of news coming in per day is difficult to judge and the state
ment that the business management has always been willing to run an extra
page is misleading. When an insert is run it means planning the day before
to have early copy on certain stories. There is considerable work connected
with it and it is not possible simply to decide at the last minute to run the
extra amount of news.
Finally we feel that avery grave charge has been made against the Daily
Palo Alto when the writer of the communication refers to that time when
"The Daily Palo Alto becomes a source of reliable news." At every and all
times the staff of The Daily Palo Alto has done all in its power to give out
the news of the University as accurately and as fully as possible. At times
we have made mistakes but those mistakes, in so far as we know, have not
been on account of a deliberate intention at any time to withold the truth.
We hope that the students of the University will be able to judge con
ditions for themselves and will not be misled by any such statement as ap
peared in the Illustrated Review.
