To the Editor of the Daily Palo Alto:
â€”May I, jus an old Stanford P. G.,
make a suggestion through your
columns?
Last Saturday's basketball game was
great. I cheered till my lungs ached.
But I swallowed volumes of tobacco
smoke in doing so. Those boys cannot
do their best if they inhale smoke in
stead of oxygen while playing.
Some one responsible ought to get
spectators to understand regulations.
Sincerely yours,
E. A. ROGERS.
