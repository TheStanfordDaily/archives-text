Professor Emeritus Mellville Best An
derson will read selections from his
translation of Dante in Room 42, Edu
cation Building at 4:15 Wednesday
afternoon.
Dr. Anderson assisted Dr. Jordan in
the foundation of the University, and
was Professor of English for a number
of years. Ever since his retirement
from the University faculty lie has been
living in Italy where he occupied a home
formely owned by D'Annunzio. He has
devoted much time all his life to the
study of Dante, and since taking up his
residence in Italy lias made his transla
tion his life work.
Dr. Anderson's translation is the first
attempt to reproduce in English the ori
ginal Italian "terza rima," a difficult
rhyme scheme. Dr. Anderson's transla
tion is soon to be published.
The reading will be the second of a
series of Wednesday afternoon readings
which are being given under the direc
tion of the English department, and the
department is anxious for all students,
especially those who are not acquainted
with Dr. Anderson, to hear his reading.
He is considered one of the best authori
ties on Dante.
The Wednesday readings are open
both to the campus and to the Palo Alto
