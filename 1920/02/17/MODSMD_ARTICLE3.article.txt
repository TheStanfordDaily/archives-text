I'hrough the courtesy of John E. Mc -
Dowell, tlie office of tlie Dean of Men
will be used for the sale of tickets for
the English Club play, Rutherford &
San." I ickcts will be on sale three clays,
beginning tomorrow morning.
The action of the Dean has saved the
English Club the great inconvenience and
expense which would otherwise have
been incurred. The Board of Directors
of the Stanford Bookstore refused to
permit the sale of tickets for this play
in the store. Though Mr. Miller (the
manager) was willing to provide store
space for student ticket sellers, the Di
rectors believed that their presence
would incommode tlie clerks. Comptrol
ler A. E. Roth likewise refused to grant
the use of the Administration P»uilding
lobby for tlie ticket sale.
