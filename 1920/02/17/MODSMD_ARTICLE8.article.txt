MORE than one thousand Stanford

urging Herbert Hoover to be a candi

States. The petition is being circu

for President" Club recently organized
on the campus.
Released on the campus yesterday
noon, the petition was circulated
around fraternity and sorority houses
and at the dormitories last night. It
also was circulated on the Quad this
morning. It is expected that the num

hundred by the time the petition is
forwarded to Hoover at Washington.
J. G. Driscoll, '18, president of the
Hoover Club, will forward the petition
to Hoover within the next few days.
He will send a personal letter to Mr.
Hoover at the same time, emphasizing
the desire of Stanford that he be a
candidate.
