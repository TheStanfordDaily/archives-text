# STANDARDS CLASS IS ATTENDED BY MANY
## Rakestraw, Roth and Hood Speak on Stanford Traditions 
### 
VVith a large number of first-year men
and new students in attendance, the
second meeting of the class in Stanford
Standards was held last night in the As
sembly Hall. N. W. Rakestraw, '17, of
the Chemistry Department, spoke of the
j "Honor System" in the Chemistry, Law,
i and Geology and Mining departments,
and gave specific incidents of the success
| which this code has been received in
these branches of the University.
One distressing fact which he ex
j plained was a recent happening in the
' library. A certain department was giv
! ing a special examination, the material
j for which was to be found in four
| books on the shelves (if the reserved
i book room. Two days previous to the
date of the examination all four of the
books were missing and the large ma
jority of the students in the class had
not had the opportunity to cover the
l work.
Mr. Rakestraw, pointed out that it was
obvious that the students would have to
prove themselves equal to the confidence
!of the library authorities, or else lose
I the privilege of using books in the re
served book room without having them
charged against them. He also stated
that out of fifty books removed from
the reserved book room in the past year
only a very small percentage have been
returned.
W. K. Hood, '20, explained the work
ings of the Men's Student Council, and
told of the method of government of the
Associated Student Body.
A. E. Roth, comptroller, spoke on the
"Stanford Spirit," and explained how
Cardinal fighting spirit, and the spirit of
fighting fair, has had such a large in
fluence on Stanford victories in the past.
The meeting was presided over by F.
L. King, '19, who made a few closing
remarks upon the benefits which the
classes in Stanford Stanfords were of
ering to the new students.
