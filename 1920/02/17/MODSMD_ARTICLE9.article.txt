VVith a large number of first-year men
and new students in attendance, the
second meeting of the class in Stanford
Standards was held last night in the As
sembly Hall. N. W. Rakestraw, '17, of
the Chemistry Department, spoke of the
j "Honor System" in the Chemistry, Law,
i and Geology and Mining departments,
and gave specific incidents of the success
| which this code has been received in
these branches of the University.
One distressing fact which he ex
j plained was a recent happening in the
' library. A certain department was giv
! ing a special examination, the material
j for which was to be found in four
| books on the shelves (if the reserved
i book room. Two days previous to the
date of the examination all four of the
books were missing and the large ma
jority of the students in the class had
not had the opportunity to cover the
