"Let's take it easy
for a while"
—Ches. Field
A CIGARETTE that invites you tm
enjoy a smoke as you never havi
before—that's Chesterfield.
Not merely fine tobaccos, mind you.
though we use the finest of Turkish and
Domestic leaf, but an exclusive blending
method that brings out hidden flavors
flavors that others have failed to find, j
That's why Chesterfields are different.
That's why they satisfy. And this
method is a closely guarded secret.
That's why none but Chesterfields can
satisfy.
Chesterfields reach you in prime shape
i
for smoking — always — because
every separate package is wrapped In
moisture-proof glassine paper.
