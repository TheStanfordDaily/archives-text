# EIGHT STANFORD MEN ARE POSSIBLES FOR OLYMPIAD
## U.C. HAS FOUR STARS Maloney Predicts a Strong Western Representation at Big Games 
### 
IN THE first survey of Pacific Coast
track candidates for the American
contingent in the Seventh Olympiad, re
leased to the United Press last night by
H. Wilfred Maloney, in his capacity as
University track and field coach, eight
Stanford athletes are touted as leading
contestants. Four California stars, three
U. S. C. athletes, two Olympic Club
members, two from the Multnomah A.
C., and three unattached runners, and
one man each from the Spokane A. C.,
Oregon A. C., and Washington State,
complete the list.
Among the other athletic events, in
which the writer prophesies a strong
western representation, are swimming
(which will be featured by Norman
Ross, a former Stanford man) and
rugby. One of the distinguishing feat
ures of this sport prospectus, is the
small amount of material picked from
the colleges of the Northwest.
Stanford men who are chosen by Ma
loney to show in the games are Morris
Kirksey, Ken Lilly, Jud House, Willard
Wells, John K. Norton, Dink Temple
ton, Norman Green and Reg Caughey.
Among the leading athletes from other
universities are: Charles Paddock and
George Schiller, of U. S. C.; Carrol
Grunsky, "Pesky'' Sprott, "Brick"
would be uncovered under the basket.
Butts, playing at running guard, made
tour goals from the middle of the field.
His defensive work, along with that of
Adams, was above reproach. Righter
played a good game, but failed to come
up to his usual standard of play. Davies,
who entered the second half, started
with a bang which made a marked im
provement on the teamwork of the
squad.
Tonight Stanford should again raise
Iter percentage in the Pacific Coast Con
ference series. However, unless the
team tightens up their style of play,
Oregon may come back at the Reds for
a victory. Coach Evans will pick his
line-up to start the second match against
Oregon, from the following men: Right
er, Davies, Pelouze, and Richmond, for
wards; Mills and Hood, center; Adams,
Butts, Lilly, and Austin, guards.
