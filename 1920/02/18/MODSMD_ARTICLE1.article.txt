# EIGHT STANFORD MEN ARE POSSIBLES FOR OLYMPIAD
## U.C. HAS FOUR STARS Maloney Predicts a Strong Western Representation at Big Games 
### 
IN THE first survey of Pacific Coast
track candidates for the American
contingent in the Seventh Olympiad, re
leased to the United Press last night by
H. Wilfred Maloney, in his capacity as
University track and field coach, eight
Stanford athletes are touted as leading
contestants. Four California stars, three
U. S. C. athletes, two Olympic Club
members, two from the Multnomah A.
C., and three unattached runners, and
one man each from the Spokane A. C.,
Oregon A. C., and Washington State,
complete the list.
Among the other athletic events, in
which the writer prophesies a strong
western representation, are swimming
(which will be featured by Norman
Ross, a former Stanford man) and
rugby. One of the distinguishing feat
ures of this sport prospectus, is the
small amount of material picked from
the colleges of the Northwest.
Stanford men who are chosen by Ma
loney to show in the games are Morris
Kirksey, Ken Lilly, Jud House, Willard
Wells, John K. Norton, Dink Temple
ton, Norman Green and Reg Caughey.
Among the leading athletes from other
universities are: Charles Paddock and
George Schiller, of U. S. C.; Carrol
Grunsky, "Pesky'' Sprott, "Brick"
