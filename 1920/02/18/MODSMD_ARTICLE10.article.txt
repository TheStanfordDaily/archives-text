# English Club Play Has Unique Action
## Melba Berry, '22, Takes Part of Old Degraded Drunkard 
### 
Mrs. Henderson gets most of the
"kick" out of "Rutherford & Son." Once
testing, then drinking—oh! what a glori
ous feeling. This is the case of Melba
Berry who has the part of Mrs. Hen
derson in that production. It is well
known that there is an art in putting
across the intoxication motif with
nothing stronger than grape juice to
drink.
In the life of Mrfe. Henderson three
things enter—her dignity, her son, and
her drink. Preservation of her dignity
she holds first, getting her son "iust
one more chance"; second and last, but
just as important is her drink, which
sustains her courage.
Rutherford has had his foreman, Mar
tin, discharge young Henderson for
stealing money from the factory. This
brings Mrs. Henderson to the scene.
Well supplied with good old high-voltage
stuff, she has a hearing before the
"master" — Rutherford. He gives her
little satisfaction and her dignity totters.
For the fiirst time in Rutherford's domi
neering life he receives a scathing re
buke.
The drama is well supplied with life
and the part of Miss Berry gives an inti
mate insight to life of the lower classes
of the small town of Brantly, where
Rutherford reigns supremely. The play
itself is a tragedy of suppressed pas
sions—a peep into the lives of the people
of north England—a veritable epic of
those black Northumberland moors upon
which Githa Sowerby, the author, spent
much of her early life.
Seats can still be obtained at the Dean
of men's office. The English Club feel
that the production next Friday, Febru
ary 20 will be a big success,"and promise
that it will long be remembered as a
milestone in campus dramatics.
