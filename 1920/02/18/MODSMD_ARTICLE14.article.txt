# STANFORD WINS GAME FROM OREGON QUINTET
## GAME ON ENCINA COURT Northern Team Will Meet Cardinal Five Again Tonight 
### 
STANFORD'S basketball team was
easily the victor in a game against
the Oregon University quintet, on the
Encina court last night, which ended
with a score of 39 to 22. The Cardinal
five will play the northern squad a sec
ond game tonight on the same floor. The
varsity game will be preceded by a con
test between the Stanford freshmen and
the Mountain View High School team,
which is scheduled to start at 7 p. m.
Last night's game was slow from the
start, Stanford never having an ad
verse situation which forced the men to
fight hard. While the Oregon teamwork
was equal, if not superior to that oÂ£
the Cardinal men, the northerners were
unable to hit the basket. They only
shot five field goals, but raised their
total score by the foul goal shooting of
Durna, who made twelve out of fifteen
tries. Mills, on the other hand for Stan
ford, was able to make only three out
of eight.
Stanford played an unusually lax game
of ball, failing to cover their men time
after time; and trying too much indi
vidual playing, when their own men
Muller, Harry Liversedge, and John
Merchant, of California; Henry Wil
liams, Spokane A. C. sprinter; Grant
Swan, of the Oregon Aggies, a miler;
Ralph Sperrow, of the Multnomah A.
C.; and Eldcn Jenne, of Washington
State in the pole vault.
