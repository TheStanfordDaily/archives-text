# EMPIRE SYSTEM OF BRITAIN DESCRIBED
## Arthur P. Newton Talks On Organization of British Realms 
### 
"The British realm is a museum of
governments," declared Professor Ar
thur P. Newton, of London University,
in his address on the present organiza
tion of the British empire last evening
in the Little Theater. "Under the Brit
ish crown is found every variety of state,
ranging in political stature from the
primitive level to the adult, responsible
form of government."
Professor Newton divided the British
realm into four classes: those Ancient
Realms situated in the British Seas, the
self-governing Territories, the Empire
of India, and that loose, vague class
which we may call Colonies and De
pendencies.
Under the Ancient Realms falls the
United Kingdom of England, Scotland,
and Ireland, and also the Channel
Islands which owe allegiance to the
king, not as king of England, but as
Duke of Normandy.
"A separate legislative assembly for
South Ireland and Ulster with a joint
council to consider matters of commo*
concern is a coming innovation in Ire
land," declared Mr. Newton. "The im
perial Parliament is overburdoned, an 4
a plan for the establishment of provin
cial councils throughout the empire iw
now under way."
"There are two lndias," said Mr.
Newton; "Native India ruled by native
princes, and British India ruled directly
by representatives of the crown." India
proved her loyalty and responsibility
very thoroughly during the war, showing
that she has become politically adult,
and merits greater independence in gov
ernment. Native India is now to have
a Chamber of Princes. Further free
dom will be given the Indian Empire
within the next few years.
The dependencies and colonies of the
British Realm present a greater prob
lem, as many of them are still feudal
in governmental forms. These colonies
are as dependent upon the peoples of the
United Kingdom as a young child is
upon its parents, according to Mr. New
ton That Great Britain's highest ambi
tion is to establish democratic govern
ments throughout her realm so that the
people under her care may enjoy peace,
prosperity, and contentment was empha
sized by Mr. Newton.
