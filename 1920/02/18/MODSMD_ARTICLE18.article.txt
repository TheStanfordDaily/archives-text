STANFORD SPIRIT was criticized, and justifiably so, by our visitors at the
basketball game last night. Every time the play started down the floor
toward a basket —if Stanford failed to make a basket, a' groan ran through
the spectators. If any member of the team failed to catch the ball, out came
another groan. We feel that this is probably due to carelessness on the part
of the students of the University, but the discouraging influence upon, not
only the individual players, but the team as a whole, makes such actions
inexcusable. Let's be good sports and encourage our men, and never forget
Stanford courtesy.

When the yell leader leaves before the game is over and Stanford fails to
give the yells or sing the songs expected at the end of a game, outsiders put
the blame upon the lack of spirit shown by the Stanford student body as a
whole. We are not trying to tell the yell leader what to do but are suggesting
that some improvement might be made.
