# COULD YOU BLAME HIM?

IPROPO of mid-semester smokeups, the following conversation is repeated.
Scene —the Library. Time, final week.
"Hello, Sam, what you doing? Thought you had a final."
"Huh? Sure have. Went over, looked at the questions and, Oh, Boy!
Thought I'd better step over between halves and look up a little about the
ancients."
"Well, I'll be darned. You sure have the nerve."
"Gotta get by."
The story isn't much and we know it is a little extreme, but it has a
point. At some universities such a thing as the Honor System exists. If
there is no such thing as a system at least the Honor Spirit is sometimes
apoken of. Such a thing seems to be entirely lacking at Stanford. A student
goes to take a final examination. He is carefully seated so that he shall under
no circumstances sit next to his neighbor. Somebody generally stays to
keep his eye on you. The fault may be that of the student or it may be that
of the faculty, but nevertheless the condidition exists. A little education is
needed on either one side or the other.
It is absolutely impossible for the faculty to take the responsibility of
a student's sense of honor. No arrangements of seating, no amount of watch
ing will make a man or woman play the game square. After the student
leaves .college, the outside world will make no effort to give him a prop.
He will have to stand on his own feet. Why shouldn't this be taught at the
University?
Had Sam, in our little story, known that it was absolutely up to him as
to whether or not he played square; if he had known that his fellow students
would have given him a razz for his smart conversation, nine chances to one
he would have learned a little about the ancients before he went to the ex
instead of afterwards. In other words, something is wrong. If the student
body will think about it and the faculty will give us the chance, we believe
that a little of the Honor Spirit could be cultivated at Stanford.
