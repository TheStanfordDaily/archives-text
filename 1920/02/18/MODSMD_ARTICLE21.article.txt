# JOFFRE PRELIMINARY DEBATERS ARE CHOSEN
## Coach McClintock Expects to Develop a Winning Combination 
### 
A squad, unusually well equipped
for intercollegiate debating competi
tion, will try out this spring for the
Joffre Extemporaneous Team. The
six debaters who were admitted to the
preliminary squad by Coach M. L.
McClintock on the basis of previous
forensic experience are: H. G. Blote,
*18. M. M. Goldstein, '20, W. F. Leiser,
'21, D. L. Goodman, '22, L. B. Martin,
'22, and E. A. Burke, '22.
With the best debating material of
the university competing for member
ship on the team, the Cardinal's
chances for reversing last year's de
cision in favor of a California repre
sentative are increased. As the Joffre
Medaille is the most coveted trophy
in western debating circles, the mem
bers of the local squad are striving
for a decision which gives the winner
an extended recognition as a speaker.
The brilliant rebuttal work of M. M.
Goldstein, '20, in the class with the
University of California last November
indicates that he will be a dangerous
competitor ia the tryouts in which
refutation ability usually wins the de
cision. W. F. Leiser, '21, for the third
year is debating on the Joffre squad,
as he was a Cardinal representative
in the 1918 and 1919 teams. Stanford
debaters admit that Leiser's familiari
ty with French questions will make
him a difficult man to handle in the
coming tryout.
An interesting feature of the spring
scrap may be the appearance of a
former Stanford man as a member of
the California squad. A. E. Murphy,
'23, who was alternate on the Cardinal
team last, fall is attending the Berke
ley school and is a candidate for the
Blue and Gold team.
