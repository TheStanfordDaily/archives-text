## 
### 
The principal business of the Stu
dent Executive Committee last night
was the loaning of $200i to the fresh
man class. The class owed this
amount to make up the deficit on the
sweater bill. The only other action
was to limit April 23 to three dates
beside the Upper Class Jolly-up, and
to allow Ram's Head and Chaparral
to give dances.
