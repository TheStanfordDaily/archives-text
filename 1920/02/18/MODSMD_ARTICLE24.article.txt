Your issue of yesterday contained
an arraignment of the Bookstore and
the Comptroller in the matter of a
refusal to allow customary locations
to be used for seat-sale for the coming
production of "Rutherford and 'Son."
In the attack upon the Bookstore I
concur, heartily, but as I was, through
my carelessness in conversation, res
ponsible for your joining of the Comp
troller as co-defendant, 1 wish to take
this opportunity of correcting my
error. In the campus activities with
which I have been associated, Mr.
Roth has always shown the greatest
readiness in rendering advice and as
sistance.
