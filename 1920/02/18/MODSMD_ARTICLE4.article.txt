# FORMER EDITOR OF CHAPARRAL WRITES FOR THE 'CARDINAL'
## 
### 
Lansing Warren, '17, former editor
of Chaparral, who became famous a
few years ago through abdicating that
position and becoming "Editor Emer
itus," owing to difficulties with the
administration over his "irresponsible
editorial policy" has written an essay
in his characteristically witty style for
the February "Cardinal," which will
be on sale Friday. His article is en
titled "The Inalienable Right of Worth
lessness." His contention is that the
majority of public is in conspiracy to
prevent a man from becoming worth
less if he wants to. If, in spite of
the difficulties and obstacles society
puts in the way of a youth he arrives
at the age of twenty-one with his
worthlessness still intact, Warren
claims he has the inalienable right of
exercising it.
George Hall, '19, has contributed a
series of witty caricatures, entitled,
"Reminiscences of the Grande Guerre."
The drawings are exceedingly clever.
James Quinby, '17, has written a
critical review of "Rutherford and
Son" with some hitherto unpublished
photographs.
Pedro Lemos, Art Director of the
Cardinal, has contributed a four-color
frontispiece, "Stanford Roofs" which
has been accepted by the Southern
California Art Association for its ex
hibit that will soon make a tour of
the country.
