# PRESIDENT'S ANNUAL REPORT IS ISSUED BY WILBUR
## HAZING BEING DISCUSSED Measure Favors Control By Students of Their Own Personal Affairs 
### 
ITNIVERSITY property valued at
$3,500,000 has been disposed of by
the administration during the past year.
President Wilbur's report, made public
late yesterday, shows the sale of the
Pacific Improvement Company's hold
ings, in which the University holds a
large interest, including the Hotel Del
Monte, and the Hope and Lone ranches.
Waterfront lands in Alameda county,
the Calistoga Springs property, and the
Vina and Durham ranches were also dis
posed of.
The president's report also deals with
hazing and the new student control sys
tem. A change in attitude toward in
coming students was promised and ef
fected during the current year by both
Encina and fraternity men.
Dr. Wilbur made the following state
ment with reference to the present meth
od of student control:
"There is no reason why a student
group should not be self-governing un
der a good and wise leadership. The
body of University regulations has the
same relation to them that the Constitu
tion of the United States and of the
State, and the existing code has to the
ordinary community. Administration is
the principal part of the problem, with
some legislation as new conditions arise.
It is hoped that the students will be will
ing to take the responsibility of main
taining student conduct in accordance
