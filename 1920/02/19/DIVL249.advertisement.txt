AMERTCA is fast becoming a pipe smoking country. Every
- year more and more men are realizing the comfort, the satis
faction, and the economy of the pipe. And by natural selection,
more and more men are smoking WD C Pipes. This is not
chance. It is because WDC Pipes offer the utmost in pipe value.
Honest French briar, seasoned; by our own special process make
WDC Pipes break in sweet and mellow. Coupled with that is a
self-governed body of pipe makers whose sole object is to fashion
pipes which are without peers in all the world. And it has been
accomplished. Ask any good dealer.
