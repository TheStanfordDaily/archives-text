# STANFORD TAKES LEAD IN BASKETBALL CONFERENCE
## SQUAD WILL TAKE TRIP NORTH NEXT WEEK Cardinal Five Wins Second Contest From Oregon Last Night 
### 
STANFORD took the lead in thfe Pa
cific Coast Conference last night,
when Oregon was defeated by the local
varsity squad, 36 to 21, on the Encina
court. This is the Cardinal team's
fourth victory in the Conference, as
they were defeated only in the second
match against the Washington State
quintet. California stands second in the
series with one defeat and two victories.
Oregon was outplayed in every phase
of the game except teamwork. The Stan
ford defense didn't come up to par, and
allowed the northerners to slip by sev
eral times. The Cardinal men failed to
cover the defense, and only superior
basket shooting and fight won the game
for the Red.
"Swede" Righter showed up in his
usual good form last night, throwing a
third of the baskets for Stanford.
Righter seems to be used as a nucleus
for all of the offensive Cardinal plays.
His work, along with that of Captain
Pelouze and Davies at the other for
ward positions, kept the Oregon guards
constantly guessing.
Throughout the season, the Stanford
team has been below standard in the
department of foul goal shooting. Last
night, Coach Evans tried out Captain
Pelouze with success. He dropped four
of his five tries into the basket. Davies
may be given a chance at foul shooting
in the next varsity game, which will be
palyed with Oregon next Tuesday night
at Eugene.
