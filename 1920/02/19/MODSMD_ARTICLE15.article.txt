# Professor Anderson Reads Translations From Dante
## 
### 
Prof. Emeritus Mellville Rest Ander
son read selections from the twenty
seventh and twenty-eighth cantos of his
translation of Dante's "Divine Comedy"
at cm informal reading given under the
direction of the English Department
yesterday afternoon.
Dr. Anderson has made the transla
tion of Dante his life work since his re
tirement from the faculty several years
ago, and has been living in Italy for
the purpose of better studying old forms
of Italian poetry. His work of transla
ting has been made difficult because of
the "Terza Rima" scheme of rhyme
which he has chosen and which is the
meter and rhyme scheme of the original
Italian version. Dr. Anderson's transla
tion is soon to be published.
