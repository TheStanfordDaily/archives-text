# DR. WILBUR AND WOMEN'S ATHLETICS
## 
### 
|\R. WILBUR in his statement before the fraternity women of the University,
** gave as one reason for moving the women to the far side of the campus,
the desirability of easy access to the athletic fields. His point is an interest
ing one for this aspect of the problem has not been seriously considered by
the average student. Nevertheless, the University plans carefully provide
for tennis courts, hockey fields, track oval, and handball courts, all conveni
ently near the proposed living groups.
Compulsory athletic work for underclass-women has done much to
foster a general interest in athletics but the rigid regulations of the gym
nasium department detracts materially from the spontaneity of athletic en
thusiasm. The number of upperclass-women actively interested in athletic
is woefully out of proportion to the number in the University. Dr. Wilbur
no doubt made his statement with these facts in mind.
There are two organizations among the women of the University who
could do much to awaken the women of the campus to the possibilities of
athletics. The Women's Athletic Association is the natural group to under
take this work. A broadening of their field along the lines suggested would
come as a natural expansion. On the other hand, the Organized Women
took the first active step in the women's rally for the Big Game. Women's
athletics is an important consideration and the co-operation of these two
organizations could do much to foster the constructive idea which lies be
hind Dr. Wilbur's statement.
