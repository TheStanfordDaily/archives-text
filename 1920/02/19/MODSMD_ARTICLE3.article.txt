# ORGAN RECITAL IS ANNOUNCED TONIGHT
## 
### 
The second of the Thursday evening
organ recitals will be held tonight in the
Memorial Church at 7 o'clock. A spe
cially selected program of American mu
sic will be played by Warren D. Allen,
University organist.
An inteersting program was given on
Tuesday afternoon, consisting of four
numbers. "L'organo primitive," by Pie
tro A. Yon, is medieval in character, en
tirely lacking in the sonorous, rolling
ilepth that characterizes modern organ
music. A beautiful cello melody with a
veiled accompanimcnt was the "Vox in
ima," by Pietro Floridia.
