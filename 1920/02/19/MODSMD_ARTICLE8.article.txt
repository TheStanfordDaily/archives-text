rTHE English Club p'ay for tomorrow
night portrays Rutherford who
domineers, not only over his own
family and his factories, but over the
whole population of the small town
of Grantly. He had built the town
along with his great factory system
and he held its citizens as slaves. Re
gardless of his strict and harsh rul
ing, Martin, his foreman, learns to
love him as a master. A great bond
of fidelity binds his foreman to him.
Then the test comes.
Martin loved Rutherford's daughter
and due to this love he looses his po
sition. For twenty-five years he had
faithfully slaved for the unrelenting
t'actorv owner. Here his fidelity for

the employer and his love for the
daughter collide. To be sure, Martin
forgets the true love he had received
from Janet Rutleiford and the rest
less hour, of from the master,
but which wins in the end? Is the
love of women greater than the bond
of faithfulness between men! Githa
Soworby cleverly works this complca
tion cut. This scene alone is a won

Good seats can still be obtained at
the Dean of Men's office. The drama
is well worth the time of any college
student and those who will be able to
witness it are assured ol' a unique and
interesting play.
