# WAR COLLECTION GIVEN STANFORD BY HOOVER
## IS PRICELESS RESUME Work Divided Into Six Main Classifications and Sub-Divisions 
### 
An historical collection of great im
portance upon the war lias been made
by Herbert Hooker and presented to
his Alma Mater, Stanford University.
Professor E. D. Adams, head of the
History Department, who went to
I Europe last May, to make this col
lection, has given out the following
facts:
The collection consists of books,
pamphlets, newspapers, and manu
script material bearing especially ou
thfj political, social and economic es
pects of the war. Little effort was
made to gather purely military ma
terial, since this will naturally be the
work of the governments at war. Iu
general the collection now rapidly
coming into the Library at Stanford
is in six main classifications:
(1) Delegation propaganda and
claims presented to the Peace Confer
ence. There were seventy such dele
gations at Paris. These were visited
and their authentic proj aganda and
claim*, ir the shape of pamphletg,
books, and manuscripts, secured. In
addition a collection was made of
unauthentic and often disavowed pro
paganda, a great quantity of which
was floating about Paris.
(2) Government Documents for the
period 19141P1 C \ of every kind and
type whether apparently bearing on
the war or not, were secured from
forty-seven European, American, and
Asiatic Governments, the idea being
that as complete as possible a col
lection fhould be made of public docu
ments and especially everything
bearing on industrial, economic and
food conditions in the warring and
neutral countries.
(3) Society publications, 1914-1919,
were secured from some one hundred
and fifty Parisian societies, and three
hundred British. This feature of the
collection is being pushed in other
important centers. The societies of
the world do the pamphleteering of
the present day, and their publica
tions represent, together with news
papers, group, as distinguished from
personal, or official opinion and action.
These societies are of every kind of
variety and interest, and the materials
secured from any one society vary
from a single pamphlet to hundreds.
Especially interesting are the publi
cations of the "suppressed" societies,
whose materials are supposedly unob
tainable, but whose agents hearing of
the Stanford collection succeeded in
getting their materials into Professor
Adams' hands.
(4) Arrangements for the purchase
of the ordinary books on the war
which appeared during the war and
are still appearing, were made in five
main centers, Paris for France, Italy,
Spain and Portugal; Brussels for Bel
gium; Berlin for Germany and
Austria; Zurich for Switzerland; and
London for the British Empire. In
each city experts were secured to draw
up purchase lists of the things worth
while, and in each city scholars were
found who generously consented to
act as advisors. In London, for ex
ample, such advisors are Professor A.
F. Pollard of the University of London,
Dr. Prothero. Editor of the "Quarterly
Review," and Mr. Hubert Hall of the
Public Record Office. Professor Adams
made the arrangements in Paris,
Brussels, Berlin, and London, but be
cause it was difficult to make busi
ness arrangements with the countries
of central eastern Europe a special
agent was sent to them. This was
Lieutenant Ralph H. Lutz, a professor
in the History department of the Uni
versity of Washington, who had been
in the American Military Mission in
Berlin for some months, and who was
demobilized in September. He was
sent on a general collecting and pur
chasing trip to Poland, Czecho-Slova
kia, Hungary, Austria, Serbia, and
Bulgaria.
(5) Odds and end of "picturesque"
and "rare" publications of the war —
such as files of the "Libre Belgique"
the "Gazette des Ardennes," and
similar publications, were secured as
opportunity offered, but only the more
important of these were desired.
(6) Archives and files of the Com
mission for Relief in Belgium, were
complete as early as Oct. 1914. At the
request of the History .department of
Stanford University. Mr. Hoover gave
directions that extreme care in keep
ing absolutely everything in the way
of records and correspondence of this
unique "Piratical government for phil
anthropy" (as Earl Grey called it)
should be exercised, and promised
that Stanford University should be
the ultimate depository. The Rotter
dam files are already at Stanford; and
others are on their way.
The work on the collection so far
accomplished largely relates to Eu
ropean countries, both belligerent and
neutral. This is now being extended
to the countries of North and South
America, with the idea that while the
European collection shall be compre
hensive, that for the Americas shall
be as complete as it is possible to
make it. The European materials are
now rapidly coming into the Library,
but will not be ready for use for some
time, since it is harder to organize a
collection for use than to gather it.
That the gift of Hoover is an ex
ceedingly valuable one, not merely to
Stanford University, but to the whole
Pacific Coast, is best shown by the
fact that Herbert Putnam, of the Lib
rary of Congress, has entered into an
agreement by which the "Atlantic
Coast collection" and the "Pacific
Coast collection," on the war, as he
calls them, shall aid and assist each
other in every way possible. In both
collections, for example, where gifts
are secured from various sources, it is
inevitable that duplicates will come in.
For all such duplicates in the Library
of Congress, the collection of Stanford
University is given first call, and the
same advantage is given the library
of Congress for the Stanford Univer
sity collection duplicates.
The amount of money furnished by
Hoover for the collection is not an
nounced, but Professor Adams states
"we have only made a beginning, and
the work of collecting will go on for
the next twenty-five years." He states
also that the Library of Congress col
lection is the only American rival at
present and that no other university
has as yet attempted a similar work,
and that while certain portions of the
collection, like book purchase, can be
secured at any time, there are others,
such as the authentic delegation pro
paganda, that are even now not to
be had in anything like complete form.

claims presented to the Peace Confer
ence. There were seventy such dele
gations at Paris. These were visited
and their authentic proj aganda and
claim*, ir the shape of pamphletg,
books, and manuscripts, secured. In
addition a collection was made of
unauthentic and often disavowed pro
paganda, a great quantity of which
was floating about Paris.
(2) Government Documents for the
period 19141P1 C \ of every kind and
type whether apparently bearing on
the war or not, were secured from
forty-seven European, American, and
Asiatic Governments, the idea being
that as complete as possible a col
lection fhould be made of public docu
ments and especially everything
bearing on industrial, economic and
food conditions in the warring and
neutral countries.
(3) Society publications, 1914-1919,
were secured from some one hundred
and fifty Parisian societies, and three
hundred British. This feature of the
collection is being pushed in other
important centers. The societies of
the world do the pamphleteering of
the present day, and their publica
tions represent, together with news
papers, group, as distinguished from
personal, or official opinion and action.
These societies are of every kind of
variety and interest, and the materials
secured from any one society vary
from a single pamphlet to hundreds.
Especially interesting are the publi
cations of the "suppressed" societies,
whose materials are supposedly unob
tainable, but whose agents hearing of
the Stanford collection succeeded in
getting their materials into Professor
Adams' hands.
(4) Arrangements for the purchase
of the ordinary books on the war
which appeared during the war and
are still appearing, were made in five
main centers, Paris for France, Italy,
Spain and Portugal; Brussels for Bel
gium; Berlin for Germany and
Austria; Zurich for Switzerland; and
London for the British Empire. In
each city experts were secured to draw
up purchase lists of the things worth
while, and in each city scholars were
found who generously consented to
act as advisors. In London, for ex
ample, such advisors are Professor A.
F. Pollard of the University of London,
Dr. Prothero. Editor of the "Quarterly
Review," and Mr. Hubert Hall of the
Public Record Office. Professor Adams
made the arrangements in Paris,
Brussels, Berlin, and London, but be
cause it was difficult to make busi
ness arrangements with the countries
of central eastern Europe a special
agent was sent to them. This was
Lieutenant Ralph H. Lutz, a professor
in the History department of the Uni
versity of Washington, who had been
in the American Military Mission in
Berlin for some months, and who was
demobilized in September. He was
sent on a general collecting and pur
chasing trip to Poland, Czecho-Slova
kia, Hungary, Austria, Serbia, and
Bulgaria.
(5) Odds and end of "picturesque"
and "rare" publications of the war —
such as files of the "Libre Belgique"
the "Gazette des Ardennes," and
similar publications, were secured as
opportunity offered, but only the more
important of these were desired.
(6) Archives and files of the Com
mission for Relief in Belgium, were
complete as early as Oct. 1914. At the
request of the History .department of
Stanford University. Mr. Hoover gave
directions that extreme care in keep
ing absolutely everything in the way
of records and correspondence of this
unique "Piratical government for phil
anthropy" (as Earl Grey called it)
should be exercised, and promised
that Stanford University should be
the ultimate depository. The Rotter
dam files are already at Stanford; and
others are on their way.
The work on the collection so far
accomplished largely relates to Eu
ropean countries, both belligerent and
neutral. This is now being extended
to the countries of North and South
America, with the idea that while the
European collection shall be compre
hensive, that for the Americas shall
be as complete as it is possible to
make it. The European materials are
now rapidly coming into the Library,
but will not be ready for use for some
time, since it is harder to organize a
collection for use than to gather it.
That the gift of Hoover is an ex
ceedingly valuable one, not merely to
Stanford University, but to the whole
Pacific Coast, is best shown by the
fact that Herbert Putnam, of the Lib
rary of Congress, has entered into an
agreement by which the "Atlantic
Coast collection" and the "Pacific
Coast collection," on the war, as he
calls them, shall aid and assist each
other in every way possible. In both
collections, for example, where gifts
are secured from various sources, it is
inevitable that duplicates will come in.
For all such duplicates in the Library
of Congress, the collection of Stanford
University is given first call, and the
same advantage is given the library
of Congress for the Stanford Univer
sity collection duplicates.
The amount of money furnished by
Hoover for the collection is not an
nounced, but Professor Adams states
"we have only made a beginning, and
the work of collecting will go on for
the next twenty-five years." He states
also that the Library of Congress col
lection is the only American rival at
present and that no other university
has as yet attempted a similar work,
and that while certain portions of the
collection, like book purchase, can be
secured at any time, there are others,
such as the authentic delegation pro
paganda, that are even now not to
be had in anything like complete form.
An historical collection of great im
portance upon the war lias been made
by Herbert Hooker and presented to
his Alma Mater, Stanford University.
Professor E. D. Adams, head of the
History Department, who went to
I Europe last May, to make this col
lection, has given out the following
facts:
The collection consists of books,
pamphlets, newspapers, and manu
script material bearing especially ou
thfj political, social and economic es
pects of the war. Little effort was
made to gather purely military ma
terial, since this will naturally be the
work of the governments at war. Iu

(3) Society publications, 1914-1919,
were secured from some one hundred
and fifty Parisian societies, and three
hundred British. This feature of the
collection is being pushed in other
important centers. The societies of
the world do the pamphleteering of
the present day, and their publica
tions represent, together with news
papers, group, as distinguished from
personal, or official opinion and action.
These societies are of every kind of
variety and interest, and the materials
secured from any one society vary
from a single pamphlet to hundreds.
Especially interesting are the publi
cations of the "suppressed" societies,
whose materials are supposedly unob
tainable, but whose agents hearing of
the Stanford collection succeeded in
getting their materials into Professor
Adams' hands.
(4) Arrangements for the purchase
of the ordinary books on the war
which appeared during the war and
are still appearing, were made in five
main centers, Paris for France, Italy,
Spain and Portugal; Brussels for Bel
gium; Berlin for Germany and
Austria; Zurich for Switzerland; and
London for the British Empire. In
each city experts were secured to draw
up purchase lists of the things worth
while, and in each city scholars were
found who generously consented to
act as advisors. In London, for ex
ample, such advisors are Professor A.
F. Pollard of the University of London,
Dr. Prothero. Editor of the "Quarterly
Review," and Mr. Hubert Hall of the
Public Record Office. Professor Adams
made the arrangements in Paris,
Brussels, Berlin, and London, but be
cause it was difficult to make busi
ness arrangements with the countries
of central eastern Europe a special
agent was sent to them. This was
Lieutenant Ralph H. Lutz, a professor
in the History department of the Uni
versity of Washington, who had been
in the American Military Mission in
Berlin for some months, and who was
demobilized in September. He was
sent on a general collecting and pur
chasing trip to Poland, Czecho-Slova
kia, Hungary, Austria, Serbia, and
Bulgaria.
(5) Odds and end of "picturesque"
and "rare" publications of the war —
such as files of the "Libre Belgique"
the "Gazette des Ardennes," and
similar publications, were secured as
opportunity offered, but only the more
important of these were desired.
(6) Archives and files of the Com
mission for Relief in Belgium, were
complete as early as Oct. 1914. At the
request of the History .department of
Stanford University. Mr. Hoover gave
directions that extreme care in keep
ing absolutely everything in the way
of records and correspondence of this
unique "Piratical government for phil
anthropy" (as Earl Grey called it)
should be exercised, and promised
that Stanford University should be
the ultimate depository. The Rotter
dam files are already at Stanford; and
others are on their way.
The work on the collection so far
accomplished largely relates to Eu
ropean countries, both belligerent and
neutral. This is now being extended
to the countries of North and South
America, with the idea that while the
European collection shall be compre
hensive, that for the Americas shall
be as complete as it is possible to
make it. The European materials are
now rapidly coming into the Library,
but will not be ready for use for some
time, since it is harder to organize a
collection for use than to gather it.
That the gift of Hoover is an ex
ceedingly valuable one, not merely to
Stanford University, but to the whole
Pacific Coast, is best shown by the
fact that Herbert Putnam, of the Lib
rary of Congress, has entered into an
agreement by which the "Atlantic
Coast collection" and the "Pacific
Coast collection," on the war, as he
calls them, shall aid and assist each
other in every way possible. In both
collections, for example, where gifts
are secured from various sources, it is
inevitable that duplicates will come in.
For all such duplicates in the Library
of Congress, the collection of Stanford
University is given first call, and the
same advantage is given the library
of Congress for the Stanford Univer
sity collection duplicates.
The amount of money furnished by
Hoover for the collection is not an
nounced, but Professor Adams states
"we have only made a beginning, and
the work of collecting will go on for
the next twenty-five years." He states
also that the Library of Congress col
lection is the only American rival at
present and that no other university
has as yet attempted a similar work,
and that while certain portions of the
collection, like book purchase, can be
secured at any time, there are others,
such as the authentic delegation pro
paganda, that are even now not to
be had in anything like complete form.
An historical collection of great im
portance upon the war lias been made
by Herbert Hooker and presented to
his Alma Mater, Stanford University.
Professor E. D. Adams, head of the
History Department, who went to
I Europe last May, to make this col
lection, has given out the following
facts:
The collection consists of books,
pamphlets, newspapers, and manu
script material bearing especially ou
thfj political, social and economic es
pects of the war. Little effort was
made to gather purely military ma
terial, since this will naturally be the
work of the governments at war. Iu
general the collection now rapidly
coming into the Library at Stanford
is in six main classifications:
(1) Delegation propaganda and
claims presented to the Peace Confer
ence. There were seventy such dele
gations at Paris. These were visited
and their authentic proj aganda and
claim*, ir the shape of pamphletg,
books, and manuscripts, secured. In
addition a collection was made of
unauthentic and often disavowed pro
paganda, a great quantity of which
was floating about Paris.
(2) Government Documents for the
period 19141P1 C \ of every kind and
type whether apparently bearing on
the war or not, were secured from
forty-seven European, American, and
Asiatic Governments, the idea being
that as complete as possible a col
lection fhould be made of public docu
ments and especially everything
bearing on industrial, economic and
food conditions in the warring and
neutral countries.
(3) Society publications, 1914-1919,
were secured from some one hundred
and fifty Parisian societies, and three
hundred British. This feature of the
collection is being pushed in other
important centers. The societies of

tions represent, together with news
