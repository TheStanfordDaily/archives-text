The better film tpovemont is a na
tional one with committee headquart
ers in New York. The purpose of the
committee is. like the Drama League,
not to censor moving pictures, but to
I call attention to good films and to
make no mention of undesirable ones,
j The committee posts each week
notices of plays which can safely be
recommended. Professor Gray plans
to go to New York in the spring where
he will consult with the National Com
mittee.
