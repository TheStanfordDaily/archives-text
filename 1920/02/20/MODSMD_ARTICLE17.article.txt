# GEORGE WASHINGTON TODAY
## 
### 
MONDAY has been set aside as a University Holiday, as a tribute to a man
whose influence haß lived and whose words have echoed through the life
of the world's greatest republic . . . George Washington. The story
of Valley Forge still rings in our ears. We look back upon the inspiring
heroism of that little army, which endured such gruelling hardships, and
see in it the first expression of (hat fine spirit which made the world pay
homage to American manhood in the recent Great War.
As a statesman, George Washington proved himself a man of unusual
vision. The United States today is looking for a man to guide the destinies
of our country with the same sagacity and foresight that Washington exerted
in the first troublesome years of his presidential term. The warning advice
of the Farewell Address is still remembered and it is difficult to realize that
the United States at last has taken the irretrievable step whereby she can
no longer hold aloof from the rest of the world. Many of the present prob
lems of the United States are world-problems and the politics within the
nation vitally affect the world at large.
Nevertheless, in spite of the changed position of this country interna
tionally, the American people would do well to look back to the Father of
His Country in choosing a presidential candidate. Washington was possessed
with a keen analytical power which divided a problem into its elements and
exposed the underlying forces behind it. He was at all times fairminded and
Just. He was fearless in standing up for what he thought to be for the best
interests of the country but he did not turn deaf to constructive advice.
Above all, he was essentially an American. He understood American ideals,
American business, American problems, and at all times acted like an Amer
ican goßtiSmaa. It is to be hoped that the American electorate, in the com
ing presidential election, will be widely intelligent enough to understand
their tremendous responsibility and will pick a man worthy of American ideals
and traditions.
