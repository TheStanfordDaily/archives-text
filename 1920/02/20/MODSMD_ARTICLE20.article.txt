# STANFORD WILL LEAD FIELD IN OLYMPICS
## Maloney Prophecies Cardinal Preponderance In Candidates 
### 
A detailed resume of the first pros
pectus dealing with probable coast
entries in the American track team
which will represent the United
States in the Seventh Olympiad at
Antwerp, recently released to the
United Press by H. Wilfred Maloney,
field and track coach of Stanford Uni
versity, points to the preponderance of
Cardinal athletes over those of any
other coast university.
The writer, who was coach of the
American athletes in the Inter-Allied
Games, held at Paris last year, came
into close contact with the majority of
the stars who will form the bulk of
the United States team at this year's
games, and is in a better position than
any other authority to judge of their
merits.
In his first published statement on
the subject, Maloney picks nine Stan
ford, or former Stanford, men, as load
ing contestants for the Pacific Coast.
The nearest rival of the Cardinal is
California, five of whose stars have
been given places on the list. The
universities of the northwest are given
a negligible number of candidates. It
is the opinion of the writer that more
than fifty per cent, of the Olympic
material cents about San Francisco.
Stanford contenders who have
proved themselves competitors for
world recognition beyond doubt num
ber four. The rest have still their
international fame to win. It seems
a safe statement, however, that "Reg"
Caughey will represent the country
in the weights, ably seconded by Liver
sedge of California; that Jud House
will place in the hurdles; Kirksey in
the sprints, and Templeton in the
jumpâ€”although the latter, in a com
parison of past records, is least sure
pf a place.
Unless unexpected talent material
izeu from tlie< north, Stanford will
lead the field. Besides track and
swimming, U. C. and Stanford will
have the unique honor of sending a
rugby representation without prelimi
nary competition with other nationally
famous organizations.
