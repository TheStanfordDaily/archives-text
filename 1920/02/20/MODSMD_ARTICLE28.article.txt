### 
NEW YORK, Feb. 20. â€”"From the
humble and inconspicuous role of a
'swipe' in the stables. John Jone&,
freshman at Blank University, rose
to the highest ranK of university
greatness today. Astride the pony he
had been gr >oming and rubbing down
for weeks he entered the game in the
final period and after a daring Bill
Hart ride down the field, with a skill
ful swing of the mallet he knocked the
tiny sphere for a goal thai gave the
Blank polo team a spectacular victory
over Excollege in the deciding game
for the championship."
This is an advance of some game,
some place, some time in the future.
Harvard, Yale, Cornell and Prince
ton have adopted polo as an inter
collegiate sport.
Last fall, General March chief of
staff of the army, ordered polo es
tablished as a major sport in all the
camps, posts and garrisons of the
service.
Declaring that polo brought about
"the development of horsemanship,
skill and daring so valuable for all
Americans," he urged that colleges
take up the sport.
In all colleges where the R.O.T.C.
is operated, the war department of
fered to furnish the instructors, the
mounts, saddles, mallets and all the
paraphernalia.
Twenty-four ponies, purchased in
Texas, have been assigned to Yale and
Cornell, which were among the first to
accept the offer of the government.
According to reports practice will be
started this spring at both universi
ties.
Princeton has applied to the war
department for equipment and after
a field is secured Harvard is to join
the ranks.
O'ving to the novelty of the venture
and inexperience of the teams no in
ter-collegiate matches will be attempt
ed for at least a year.
Polo for years has been flourishing
in many of the larger army posts, es
pecially in Texas. The success result
ing here prompted the war department
to put the sport on a broader scale
and nationalize it if possible.
