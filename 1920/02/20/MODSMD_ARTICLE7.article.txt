# Student Council Will Investigate Student Pranks
## 
### 
It has been brought to the notice
of the Metis' Council for Student
Control that certain thoughtless and
dangerous practices have been in
dulged in by students traveling on the
street cars between the campus and
Palo Alto. They include pulling the
trolley from the overhead wire, ap
plying the brakes at the rear of the
car, and mutilating advertisements.
Another dangerous act carried on by
students is that of greasing the tracks
; near Encina, thus causing the car to
, become unmanageable.
A week ago, because of such an
act, a serious accident was narrowly
averted, the electric car nearly crash
ing into an automobile.
If any such acts occur in the fu
ture, the Student Council threatens a
thorough investigation, stating that
the miscreants will be seriously dealt
with.
