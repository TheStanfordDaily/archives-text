Curci, under the direction of Frank W.

The last of the group of three artists
brought to Stanford this season by Mr.
Healy, Mme. Galli-Curci is for many
the greatest favorite and decidedly the
most universally known.
At present she is appearing in New
York with the Chicago Opera Company
at the Lexington Opera House. Accord
ing to the New York critics, every ap
pearance of this artist contributes in
creasingly to her already great reputa
tion. The largest audiences that have
been seen in the Lexington Theater this
season have come to hear her.
