Speaking of
Good Values
It's natural enough for a man to be attracted by low
price figures. That's human nature. But remember,
in clothes-buying, the real basis for satisfaction is to
consider what you get, and not altogether what you
pay.
In other words, when you choose clothes, compare
values and not price figures. If you are sure of the
quality in a garment, you'll be willing to pay a fair
price.
Kuppenheimer Clothes
Will satisfy your demands for satisfaction, because in
every detail they are made with your best interests in
mind. Good value is always a feature, but partic
ularly now, because our prices are based on purchase
costs months ago, and not on prevailing high market
prices.
