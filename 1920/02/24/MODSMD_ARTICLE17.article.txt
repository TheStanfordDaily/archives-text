# SECOND TRACK MEET OF SEASON IS HELD
## Kirksey and Templeton Win First Places in Several Events 
### 
Exceptionally good times on a poor
track marked the second informal track
meet held last Friday afternoon on the
oval. A large turnout answered the
summons of Coach Maloney, and as
these meets are to he held every Friday
afternoon until the schedule opens, it is
foreseen that keen competition will re
sult.
Haskell, a former U. C. man, now
eligible to compete for the Cardinal, has
been the biggest find in the distances.
Kirksey clipped off a 10:1 hundred
which is good time for so early in the
year. In the 440 heats both Maynard
and Hamlin circled in 55 seconds flat.
H. F. Campbell shoved the shot 38 feet.
