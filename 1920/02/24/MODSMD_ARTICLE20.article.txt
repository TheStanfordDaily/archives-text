# CONSTRUCTIVE THINKING
## 
### 
CARELESS criticism is a fault of the world at large. Nothing is easier than
telling what is wrong with this or that. The ability to point out what
will correct this or that, however, is an entirely different thing but it is just
this ability which the university student should develop.
"Constructive thinking." is a term which has been used constantly since
the wave of war idealism swept the country. University lectures, Tuesday
evening speakers, Y. W. C. A. and Y. M. C. A. workers have pleaded for
constructive thinking. On the whole, these men and women have received
a temporary response from the students of the University but what about
the practical application?
Student activities are far from perfect. Considerable criticism is heard
about the work of various organizations 011 the campus, most of it probably
justified. Nevertheless, it is a noteworthy fact, that our progress toward
changing conditions is painfully slow. The brief four-year cycle of student
life is one important factor but still it can be said that the student doesn't
get busy along the right lines soon enough. An appalling number of stu
dents sit back and criticise without making the least effort toward building
up that which they criticise. As soon as every Stanford student puts his
shoulder to the wheel, learns to think for himself and to consider cause as
well as effect, then Stanford student life will be strenghtened and enriched
beyond measure by the influence of campus men and women.
