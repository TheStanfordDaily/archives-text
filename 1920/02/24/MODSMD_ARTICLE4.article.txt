# COLLEGE RUGGERS PLAY ELIMINATION GAME FOR OLYMPIAD
## 
### 
Templeton's drop kick, from a dif
ficult angle, swung victory towards the
Alt-British rugby fifteen, in its game
with the Ail-American stars, played
at EWing Field, San Francisco, Satur
day afternoon. Up to the time the
Cardinal athlete's toe sent the ball
sailing over the bar, the All-American
aggregation had a decided edge over
its rival. The field goal, hoAvever,
closed the scoring for the day, the
count being 8 to 6.
According to San Francisco news
papers, the name "All-British" was a
misnomer, for all the boys taking part
in the game learned their rugby at
California, Stanford, Santa Clara, and
the Olympic Club.
Hunter scored the first try for the
British Alteon, after a rush by Patrick
and Dr>e. Templeton entered the game
in time to convert.
Another contest will be played next
Saturday, as a third elimination con
test for the Olympic Games, with the
fourth and last to follow soon after.
The selection committee will release
its latest official list of the present
squad, composed since Saturday's
game, before the next line-up is
chosen.
