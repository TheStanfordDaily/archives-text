# ORIGINAL COMEDY SONGS TO FEATURE RAM'S HEAD SHOW
## 
### 
Original songs will feature the Ram's
Head musical extravaganza which will
be produced here 011 March. 12. The
appeal of the comedy songs, which hold
the boards during most of the show, lies
in their application to local conditions.
The celeverest of these is "That's What
I Pay Tuition For." The lyrics and
music were written by T. S. Reynolds,
'18. and C. S. Kegley, ex-'lB.
A fairy dance entitled "YVieland's
Gulp." is bound to be one of the laugh
hits of the show, according to the indica
tions given in rehearsals. Ofc the senti
mental songs. "You Can't Blame Me
for Loving You." is one of the most
beautiful.
Neil Mofet, who wrote "Monterey,"
and many other song hits, is the com
poser of two unpublished songs which
will be "tried out" in the local production
next month.
Ram's Head Society will reveal the
name of their show next week.
