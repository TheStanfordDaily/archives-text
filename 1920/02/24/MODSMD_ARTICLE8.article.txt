# "RUTHERFORD AND SON" IS PRESENTED BY ENGLISH CLUB
## PRAISE DUE CAST FOR ITS EFFORTS Drama Badly Chosen In View of Available Campus Talent 
### Richard A. Martinsen 
Two preliminary statements are
necessary to, a criticism of "Ruther
ford and Son," played by the English
Club actors at the Auditorium Satur
day night.
First —the Vast deserves exceptional
praise for its effort to render an un
usually difficult piece. Second —the
vehicle chosen for that cast to play
was entirely beyond its power, just
as it would be beyond the power of
any campus talent in the United
States.
The result of a very evident attempt
on the part of English Club officials
to uphold a standard was to attempt
a production out of all artistic pro
portion to the available talent "Ruth
erford and Son" has great potentiali
ties, but those potentialities cannot
be brought out successfully save by
a mature and well-balanced cast —so
dependent are 4hey on the creation
and maintenance of an emotional at
mosphere. The play as shown here,
handicapped as it must be through
lack of a sufficiently professional
cast, was pre-destined to failure, if
judged from a solely abstract and pro
fessional artistic standpoint, in spite
of an excellent coach in the person
of Gordon Davis—who demonstrated
his ability in staging an "atmosphere"
play by his work in"The First Born" —
and ai earnest, hard-working cast.
To Ruth Elsinger, as "Janet," must
go the credit for the most valuable
performance. The strongest point in
her rendition of the role was the dia
logue with the "master," towards the
close of the second act. Miss El
singer, with her clear, well-modulated
voice, and her power to convey that
suppressed emotion which is one of
the main essentials of the drama, was
able, at times, to overcome the handi
cap of a role for which she was not
entirely suited. It was often an actual
relief to have the cue passed her.
Melba Berry, as "Mrs. Henderson,"
was altogether effective during her
brief appearance—with merely an oc
casional lapse in dialect. She was
thoroughly master of her role —a role
more within the field of campus cap
ability than the others.
James Quinby, as "Martin," another
victim to a part that could not suit
him, at least enunciated distinctly, and
gave an even-tenored characterization
from first to last.. At times he gave
the impression of trying to attain the
necessary emotional climax without
sufficient support or incentive for his
fellow players.
Wendt, as "Rutherford," had in his
favor an ideal build, good facial ex
pression. and a thorough mechanical
knowledge of his part.
Kenneth Fuessle, as "John," had a
good delivery, and the rough basis of
that valuable gift—stage presence.
Josephine Terrill as "Mary," his wife,
had also a pleasing voice, and con
veyed an impression of sincere ef
fort.
Fern Weaver, in the role of "Ann,"
had the most difficult part of the
play. In her attempt to remain true to
dialect, she forfeited clearness and
distinctiveness. It was only occasion
ally that she could be understood.
Russell Johnston, as "Richard," was
able to convey the desired impression
of harmless effeminacy.
