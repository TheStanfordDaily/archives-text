# DEBATING SQUAD PICKED BY COACH
## Kilpatrick and Fisher Will Represent Cardinal In Contest 
### 
Final tryouts were held yesterday
afternoon in the Little Theater for the
Tri-State and Redlands debating teams.
Coach McClintock used the Joffre ex
temporaneous method in picking the
squads. Though the candidates knew
the question under debate—the closed
shop movement—prior to the clash, the
side which each speaker supported was
not determined until five minutes before
the debate. Close competition marked
both tryouts yesterday as the twelve
contestants had been previously picked,
as the best of a squad of thirty-two.
R. C. Fisher, '22, and W. M. Kil
patrick, '23, constitute the team that will
meet the University of Wahsington in
Seattle, March 5, on the closed-shop
question. Fisher is well known for his
forensic work as he represented Stan
ford last spring in the contest with the
University of Southern California. His
experience will make him a dangerous
man to the Washington team. Kilpat
rick, a first-year man, was the ''dark
horse" of the tryout. This contest is his
first appearance in intercollegiate de
bating.
The squad that meets the University
of Oregon the same evening in the As
sembly Hall in the triangle scrap is
composed of Clyde Crobaugh, '20, and
P. H. Erickson, '21. Crobaugh is an
Economics major who has specialized in
labor problems. His familiarity with
the relation of the closed shop to the
labor question will make him a difficult
man for the Oregon speakers to handle.
The second member, Erickson, is a
former president of the Euphronia De
bating Society. He was the mainstay of
the Euphronia team in its recent annual
debate with Nestoria for the intersociety
championship.
The following team of four was
picked to represent the Cardinal in the
debate with the University of Redlands
the first week of* April: J. H. Anglin,
'23, T. C. Irwin, '23, Miss Alice Eddy,
'21. and L. W. Hodges, '21.
