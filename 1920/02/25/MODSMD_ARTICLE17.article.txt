# Former Stanford Man Gives Recital
## Harry Robertson, '10, Gives Musical Program Before Large Audience 
### 
A tenor voice of rich timbre and a
delightful personality won for Harry
Robertson, *10, the enthusiastic approv
al of the large audience which crowded
the Little Theater to hear his song
recital last night. Robertson's geni
ality and spontaneous humour created
a favorable impression from the first.
The program of songs, for which
Warren D. Allen played the accom
paniements, were almost entirely in
French, and varying in nature from
street ditties to arias from grand
opera. Especially well-rendered was
"Crescent Moon." a love-song and
"Land of the Leal," a Scottish lyric.
Mr. Robertson has a voice of un
usilal sweetness and clarity which
shows superior training. His higher
notes were especially good, and well
modulated.
Harry Robertson was prominent in
college life here. During the war he
was a captain in aviation.
