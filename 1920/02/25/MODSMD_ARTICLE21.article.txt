# COMMENT ON HOOVER
## 
### 
THE editorial in this morning's Cronicle entitled, "Hoover and the Treaty,
It is Not Perfectly Clear What He Really Does Think About It" is rather
amusing to those of us who were fortunate enough to hear Mr. Hoover's
first speech on this question in the Assembly Hall soon after his return
to the campus. The sincerity and conviction which ran through his words
in his ardent support of the League are not easily forgotten. We of Stan
ford cannot feel that Mr. Hoover has backed down in his beliefs nor do we
think that his possible candidacy for President of the United States would
materially shake his faith in either the Treaty or the League of Nations.
If no candidate can commit himself on either the League or the Treaty with
out "putting his foot in it" then Mr. Hoover is in, and in deep.
The editorial goes on to say that "he does hope that the Treaty will
be ratified somehow before the Presidential campaign gets hot, for if not the
candidates will have to say right out what they actually think about the
Treaty, which might be embarrassing." Tt would be difficult to imagine Mr.
Hoover embarrassed over his opinion concerning the Peace Treaty. Decision
arid a certain fearlessness to stand up for what he thinks is right, were char
acteristics of Mr. Hoover before there was any talk about his looking toward
the White House.
Hoover is not a man accustomed to evade issues. To some extent he
looks at the Treaty as a business proposition. The fact that Hoover is a
straightforward business man has done much toward making him a figure of
popular appeal. It would not be difficult to find out exactly what Mr. Hoover
thinks of the Treaty today and it is not reasonable to suppose that he has
changed his ideas radically since he delivered his message concerning the
Treaty to his "home folks." \
