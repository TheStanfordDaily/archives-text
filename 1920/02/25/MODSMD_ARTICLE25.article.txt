## 
### 
NEW YORK, Feb. 25.â€”The Pacific
Coast, schools will probably be well
represented in the Poughkeepsie re
gatta next June, according to word
received in eastern rowing circles.
The Universities of Washington and
California are in favor of sending their
sweep swingers to the eastern classic.
With the new appropriation to the
crew, Stanford, too, will probably enter
a team. The actual decision to com
pete will rest largely on the outcome
of the Pacific Coast regatta on the
Oakland estuary, May 1.
