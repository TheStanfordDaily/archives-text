(Continued from page one)

Barrows as stating, "1 told the com
mittee waiting on me that under no cir
cumstances would I extend an invitation
to Mr. Robins." The reason given for j
the president's action by the Examiner,
is that Robins was refused his invitation
due to alleged sympathy for the Bftlshe- j
vik principles of government.
The president's office at Berkeley, when
urged to make a direct statement for
the Daily Palo Alto, in reference to its
action towards the lecturer as reported
by the Examiner, refused to substantiate
the newspaper. While admitting that an
invitation to Robins had been refused
by Barrows, the president's office would J
give no opinion, officially or personally,!
on the reason for his rejection.
