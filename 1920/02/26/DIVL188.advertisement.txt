Hi
For University Men —
ONLY a Magician could make a good hat at a cheap
price this year—
The chief reason is, of course, the scarcity and high
cost of good hatters' fur, most of which comes from the
Balkans or Australia.
So—this season, be sure you buy a hat with a NAME
in it that stands for QUALITY !
Mallory is a good hat-name. For 100 years it ha*
meant quality, regardless of war-costs or anything else.
See the Mallory Dealer today—he is showing tome
mighty smart new spring models
