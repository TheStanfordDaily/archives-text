# RAYMOND ROBINS WILL SPEAK HERE FRIDAY MORNING
## Ten O'clock Assembly Set To Hear Noted Lecturer 
### 
'THOUGH not invited to speak to the
students at the University of Cali
fornia, Raymond Robins, well known
orator, politician, and Red Cross
leader, will give an address at the
Stanford Assembly Hall at 10 o'clock
tomorrow morning, as previously an
nounced. Choosing as his topic, "The
Challenge of the Hour," Mr. Robins
has been touring the United States,
talking at all large colleges in the
South, and everywhere creating a
favorable impression by his forceful
ness and sincerity.
According to Mr. A. E. Worthy, of
the Y. M. C. A., the opposition to Mr.
Robins at the University of California
is due to personal feeling on the part
of President Barrows. While Mr.
Robins was working in Russia as head
of the American Red Cross, Worthy
says, he came into personal contact
with Dr. Barrows, and because the
views of the two men were diametric
ally opposed on the subjects of the
Soviet and the Bolshevik factions in
Russia, a personal enmity grew up
which lias resulted in the falure to j
invite Mr. Robins to speak at Ber-1
keley.
Sent hero by the Interchui'cli World i
i
Movement, Mr. Robins, has for his
specific purpose that of this organi-'
zation for which he is working, with- j
out any pay whatsoever, the recruit-,
ins of 10,000 college students for
Christian work, including the ministry. \
missions, Christian Associations, and
also business and teaching. Indirectly,
Mr. Robins will inform the campus'
public of the movements and condi
tions in the world today.
The life history of Mr. Robins is j
extremely interesting. Reared in San '
Francisco, lie entered the law prac
tice there, but later joined the gold
rush to the Yukon, where he struck
it "lucky," and immensely wealthy,
returned to the United States.
He settled down in the famous
Seventeenth Ward in Chicago, and for
many years he has been an influence
in the social and political life of his
city. In 1912, he was temporary chair
man of the Progressive National Con
vention Committee, and in 1917, he ran
for United States Senator from Illi
nois.
Mr. Robins is one of a series of
speakers who will be on the campus
Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday
and Tuesday, under the auspices of
the local Y. M. C. A. He will speak
to an assembly at 7:30 in the even
ing on Friday, upon the topic of "The
Indispensable Place of Chistianity in
the New Democracies," and to the
Faculty Club, at a luncheon at the
Women's Clubhouse at noon. Mr.
Robing earned a reputation as an ex
tiemely interesting speaker when he
spoke here in 1917, and Stanford stu
dents will be glad of this opportunity
to hear him.
