# FRESHMAN QUINTET TO MEET U.C. FROSH
## Second Game of Series Will Be Played Saturday Night 
### 
> Coach Acker is putting his basket
ball squad through a week of snappy
practice preparatory to the second
game of the California-freshman seri
es which is to be played Saturday
night in Encina gymnasium.
Weaknesses which appeared in the
game at Berkeley are being worked
on, and a stronger team will take the
floor against the Blue and Cold babes
Saturday night than has so far repre
sented the Cardinal freshmen.
A strong defensive system has been
developed by Acker and if the for
wards work up to form, a Stanford
victory may be expected.
Captain Rogers "has been shifted to
floor guard with Austin or Piggot tak
ing his place at forward. This change
is expected to strengthen the team's
offense.
