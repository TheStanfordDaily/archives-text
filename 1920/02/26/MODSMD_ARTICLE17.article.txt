RAYMOND ROBIN'S visit to the University and particularly the address
which he will make tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock in the Assembly Hall
has taken on a particular interest on account of the action of President Bar
rows of the University of California in refusing to invite Mr. Robins to speak
there. Undoubtedly President Barrows feels that he has sufficient grounds
for such an action and it has been intimated that his action came as the
result of the work which the two men did in Russia.
The peculiar interest, however, which the situation has for Stanford
people lies in the fact that Acting President Marx, Professor L. E. Bassett,
chairman of the committee for Public Exercises, and Dr. Morgan of the
Y. M. C. A. do not look on Mr. Robins in the same light. The right of
free speech is one of the fundamental privileges of the people of this country
and it is probable that Stanford officials recognized this factor.
President Barrows' action is one more touch to an already romantic
history surrounding Mr. Robins. It is Baid that he made his fortune in Alaska
and since that time has worked as a lecturer, never taking remuneration for
his work. He was sent to Russia under the American Red Cross and it was
during his activities there that he was charged with having very pronounced
sympathies with Bolsheviki ideals of government. He has written extensive
ly for periodicals concerning his experiences in Russia and has brought both
commendation and praiie on his head.
With such a background, the address tomorrow morning promises to be
one of the most interesting of the year. Stanford students will be given the
opportunity to judge the man for themselves and this is certainly an in
stance when individual thinking and analysis are necessary.
