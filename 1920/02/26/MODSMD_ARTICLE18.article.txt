# PROPOSED CHANGES
## 
### 
Â»|*HB election system of the Daily Palo Alto has been more or less of an
experiment and as such, several possible changes for the best interests
of the paper have come to notice. The appointment of a committee, by the
executive committee, all of whom are well informed as to the conditions and
circumstances connected with the Daily Palo Alto, will make possible the
best possible organization of the paper. We heartily approve of the step
taken by the executive committee and will do all in our power toward suc
cessful co-operation with the committee Just appointed.
