# "Sarcasm" Chaparral Will Be Published March 4th
## 
### 
March Chaparral, which will come out
the fourth of the month, promises to be
one of the most attractive and ironical
numbers yet published, in its large va
riety of art, and its unsparing campus
hints. It is a sarcastic number, and the
cover by George Hall, '21, will be ex
tremely clever in that.it will bear out
the idea of sarcasm. There will be many
long features by new contributors to
Chappie, and W. E. Antrim, cx-'l9, has
contributed three or four pictures more
atrocious than ever before. Miss Delia
Taylor, '23, will feature a page on sorori
ties, putting forth the ideas concerning
queening after their abolishment.
