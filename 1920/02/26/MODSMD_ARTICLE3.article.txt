## 
### 
Water polo and water baseball
will no longer monopolize the
field of aquatic sports with the
completion of the plans of the un
organized Lagunita Golf Club.
Lake golf is this latest innova
tion of iliis club and a six-hole
links has already been mapped
out on the Lagunita; which is not
so difficult as it should be, con
sidering this year's drought which
lias left the local pond high and
dry, indeed.
With the substitution of "lake
golf" for the former Lagunita
pastime of "rocking the boat,"
Stanford has been treated to one
of the strangest incongruities of
the year. The native frog colony
which has lived apart year in and
year out now has to scurry for
cover 011 the cry of "fore."
An idea of how dry the Lagunita
must be can be gained from an
interview with members of the
golf club, who deplore their in
ability to maintain a nineteenth
hole. Who said July 1?.
