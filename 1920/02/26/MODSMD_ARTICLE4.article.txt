## 
### 
Five of the most important social and
moral problems of South America and
their remedy, were discussed by Profes
sor P. A. Martin, of the Department of
History, last evening. His lecture was
given under the auspices of the Y. M.
C. A., in the Little Theater.
In introduction, Professor Martin ex
plained that there had been much prog
ress in Latin-America in the field of
economics. He said that the social and
moral phases were most important feat
ures of their present progress.
Growth in the capacity of self-govern
ment, growth of civic conscience, im
provement in sanitation and public
health, better labor legislation, and an
increase in religious activity were the
problems which he dealt with. Since the
countries of Central and South America
are made up of a very polyglot people,
the social progress has necessarily been
slow. The tendency, however, is toward
progress in almost every Latin-American
country.
If the United States is to help these
sister republics, Professor Martin said
that the best work that could be accom
plished is through missionaries and Y.
M. C. A. workers who have and will in
crease the -religious and educational ac
tivities of their peoples.
