# Professor P.J. Treat Lectures In Palo Alto
## 
### 
"Merchants of the Far East" was
the subject of a talk made before the
Palo Alto Chamber of Commerce
members at their weekly ltincheon
meeting yesterday by Professor Pay
son J. Treat of the History Depart
ment.
Professor Treat drew comparisons
between the merchants of China and
Japan. Me stated that the Chinese
policy of honesty has been a basic
principle in that country for centuries,
and that their success in trading was
not confined to their own country, but
extends alto to the Dutch East Indies
and India and that 85 per cent of the
retail trade in the Philippines is man
aged by the Chinese.
The 'old myth' that the Japanese
employ Chinese hank tellers because
they cannot trust their own country
men, is unfounded The Japanese, he
said, are less conservative in busi
ness than thr Chinese.
