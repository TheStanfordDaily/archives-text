# Women's Assembly Will Be Held on Monday to Amend the Constitution
## 
### 
Organized women of Stanford Uni
versity will hold an assembly Monday
afternoon at 4:30, in the Women's
Clubhouse. Changes in the constitu
tion of the women's student body will
be considered, and plans for more
complete organization of the women
discussed.
At this meeting, Miss Oolooah
Burner, national student secretary of
the Y. W. C. A., will talk on the Inter-
Church World Conference, which is
now in progress in the United States.
Miss Burner comes to Stanford under
the auspices of the Vocational Guid
ance Committee or the University
and the Y. W. C. A. She will discuss
the possibilities of the church as a
vocational field.
Changes in the constitution of the
Organized Women, drawn up by the
Women's Council, were passed upon
by Conference at its meeting last
night. By this action the constitu
tion may be brought before the Or
ganized Women for amendment.
The improvements in the constitu
tion call for. first, the election of the
.student body officers and the Council
in April instead of in May, that the
new officers may become thoroughly
familiar with their duties before the
close of the college year. The method
of election will also be changed. An
other amendment will provide for the
establishment of a separate secretary
for Council and Conference because
one individual can not handle both
offices. As the Finance Committee has
assumed full charge of money mat
ters, the office of treasurer is to be
done away with.
The revised constitution, together
with University regulations, and Coun
cil and Conference rulings, will be
published in a "Rule Book," to be is
sued in the near future.
A statement placing responcibility
for conduct at dances and entertain
ments on the campus was made
known at the meeting of Conference
last evening. It is as follows: "Men's
Council and Women's Council are un
animously of the opinion that a dance
committee should assume full responsi
bility for the conduct of every indi
vidual on the floor at a dance, in the
case of entertainments the committee
should assume responsibility for all
actions both on the stage and in the
audience."
