# Campus Women Ask For More Room on Steps
## 
### 
The Daily Palo Alto has received
the following letter:
"Because many other girls have had
the same difficulty. I ask you to allow
me to make a suggestion in the
columns of your paper.
"A few months ago you published an
editorial, telling the girls to stay away
from the law steps, because by tra
dition they belonged to the men.
"The girls did as they were re
quested and went up and down other
: tens, whereupon some men decided
to take possession of the now more
interesting ones. At present the men
are attempting to monopolize all the
steps. Many women are not anxious
to be criticized by a group of men,
who have nofhing else to do and are
therefore compelled to walk a long
distance out of their way.
"I should like to suggest that if the
men need to congregate between class
es that they limit their meeting places
to those given them by tradition.
(Signed)
A CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTOR."
