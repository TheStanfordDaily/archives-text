# RIGHTER IS PLAYING AT RUNNING GUARD
## Evans Shifts Varsity Team Against Northern Quintets 
### 
Working a new combination. Coach
Evans will put his basketball team
up against the Oregon Agricultural
College five, tonight and tomorrow
night, at Corvallis. These will be
Stanford's last Conference games,
with the exception of the remainder
of the California series, next week.
"Swede" Righter has been shifted
from forward to floor guard, while
Captain Pelouze and Davies will play
the basket-tossing positions. Mills
will work at center, while Adams or
Butts will start the games at the
standing guard position.
This shift of line-up worked with
perfect harmony against the Oregon
team last Tuesday ard Wednesday
nights, giving the Cardinal squad two
more victories in the Pacific Coast
Conference series.
If Evaps' men win their games
against O. A. C.. California will be
the only team between Stanford and
first honors in the Pacific Coast
championship.
