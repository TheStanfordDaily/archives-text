# LAW ASSOCIATION VOTES AGAINST BUREAU PLAN
## 
### 
\ proposal that the Stanford Law
Association conduct a bureau that would
aid Stanford law school graduates to
find positions in law offices has been
voted down by the members of the as
sociation. The faculty of the law school
at present floes such work, and the asso
ciation feels that it would be unneces
sary for it to duplicate.
