STUDENT SUPPORT of the Tuesday evening lectures has been deplorably
lacking. In several instances the reception of some of the finest lecturers
has been more or less embarrassing because of the obvious lack of interest
on the part of the student body. Attending Tuesday evening lectures is more
or less of a habit. The programs are thoughtfully planned for the enjoy
ment primarily of the students of the University and not for the few people
from Palo Alto who apparently make the continuance of the lectures possible.
Dr. Wilbur re-established the system of regular lectures free from charges
of any kind, largely as the result of his own experience in the University
in older days. At that time the lectures were successful. The reason they
are not more of a success today is largely on account of carelessness. It is
so easy to be "too busy" but the students of the University will find that these
Tuesday evening lectures will almost invariably be worth finding time to
attend.
