# WOMEN'S RULES
## 
### 
A MASS MEETING of the Organized Women of the University will be held
next Monday afternoon and at that time the women of the University will
have an opportunity to make some definite changes which the Women's
Council has been working on for a number of terms. The approval of the
codification of women's rule√ü in some definite form is one of the most im
portant steps to be taken at the meeting and this work of the Council will
prove of inevitable value to the women of the University.
Ever since the announcement of the new rules for women at the time
Camp Fremont was established in the university vicinity, a certain vagueness
and continual misunderstanding of women's rules has been prevalent among
both men and women on the campus. The Council has had to deal con
stantly with cases involving the infraction of rules simply on account of a
misunderstanding on the part of women students. The possibility of a rule
book is an important move toward making women's student government
much more definite and far more stable.
