# Peacetime Red Cross Work Subject of Talk
## 
### 
"Peacetime Work of the Red Cross"
was the subject of an interesting talk
given by Miss Mary L. Cole, of San
Francisco, at the Y. M. C. A. meeting
yesterday afternoon. Miss Cole is the
director of the Pacific Division of the
Bureau of Public Health Nursing, and
has served overseas in the Red Cross
during the war.
Miss Cole told of the problems the
Red Cross has been meeting in all
parts of the world since the close of
the war. The main thing it has to
combat now is the spreading of dis
ease, and to do this division of Pub
lic Health Nurses are established in
all of the larger cities. From these
main offices, nurses are sent to all
rural districts.
Miss Cole pointed out the urgent
need for well-educated women in this
field of work. The Public Health
Nurse is a combination of social ser
vice worker and trained nurse. There
are some 8,000 of these nurses now
on active duty in this country. There
is need for f>o,oop< nurses, and it is
for this reason that the appeal to
college people is made.
