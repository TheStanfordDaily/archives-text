# RAYMOND ROBINS STIRS LARGE ASSEMBLY BY ADDRESS
## Declares U.S. Only Nation Economically Able to Meet Challenge 
### 
That the social order is more chal
lenged today than it was in 1914; that
this challenge which comes out of Rus
sia can not be met by the nations of
Europe because of iheir internal dis
turbances; and that the United States
is the only nation in the world today
which can meet thit= fundamental and
subtle challenge, wen. the most striking
statements of Dr. Raymond Robins this
morning. Speaking to one of the largest
assemblies of the year, he held the at
tention and interest of his hearers for
the better part of an hour by his virile
method of address and his logical and
well-chosen argument, in support of his
doctrines.
Robins' contention is that this chal
lenge coming out of Russia, but which
is not peculiar to Russia, simply crystal
lizes the class economic forces rising out
of all nations. The social order in Rus
sia, and the other European countries,
lias been greatly changed by the war.
and while certain of these changes must
pass away, the more basic ones will re
main. Working under Kerensky for
four months and under Lenine and
Trotsky for eight, Raymond Robins is
fitted to speak the truth when he de
clares that in Russia today 93 per cent
of the people are done with the old
regime of autocracy, czarism, and reli
gious oppression forever — that they
crave and will adhere only to the new.
America alone can meet the challenge,
is Mr. Robins' viewpoint, for in Amer
ica alone is found that great trinity that
insures strength; and this trinity con
sists of political social control, religious
harmony and faith among the people,!
and a fairly adequate economic insti- j
tution.-
By far the most important phase of
the three is the economic one, and that'
constitutes the point of attack today.'
An economic system to be adequate must,
do four things: It must produce; it must
leave freedom for the producing intel
ligence to function without delay; it
must have the viewpoint of the outdoor;
fact business mind; and it must give i
superior reward for superior effort.
The American system more than any]
other in the world does these four j
things, according to Mr. Robins. But it
has inherent weaknesses, such as its
tendency towards monopoly, which de- j
teriorates and the tendency to
regard labor values as a commodity, I
and its tendency to trust in force against
ideas. These difficulties, however, can
be overcome.
In conclusion, Mr. Robins read a state-i
ment of Abraham Lincoln's that "labor
is prior to and independent of capital.
Capital is the fruit of labor. It is supe- 1
rior to it and deserves more considera- j
tion. When labor representing the
rights of persons and capital represent
ing the rights of property meet, property
must give way. In the strength of
American institutions and freedom we
shall weather this hour and blaze the |
way for all the nations of the earth.
ROBIN SPEAKS TO FACULTY
Speaking before a large number of
faculty members, Dr. Raymond Robins
outlined the growth and policy of the
Russian revolution in a short lecture fol
lowing the faculty luncheon given today
in his honor at the Women's Clubhouse.

Crosss and also a representative of the
government. He was in Russia during
some of the most dangerous periods
and had personal interviews with Keren
sky, one of the early leaders, on an av
erage of three times per week for a
period of six months. He also had
many personal dealings with Lenine and
had the opportunity to obtain the views
and aims of these leaders.
What the ultimate results of the revo
lution will lie and what effect it will have
upon society and the different countries
of the world in general were discussed
by the speaker, who stated that the prob
lem was one which was of vital import
ance to every democratic country in the
world today.
Dr. David Starr Jordan, chancellor
emeritus, acted as chairman of the meet
ing and introduced the speaker.
