# COLUMBIA SEEKS A DEBATE WITH STANFORD TEAM
## 
### 
Tentative proposals for a forensic
contest between Columbia University's
crack debating team and Stanford have
been made by Coach A. O. Dawson of
Columbia. Having won high honors in
eastern debating circles, the Columbia
team plans to make a tour of the West,
hoping to include on their list Stanford,
University of Southern California, and
several of the northwestern • colleges.
The contemplated tour is to be a repeti
tion of the Columbia trip through the
West in 1916.
Owing to the fact that Stanford has
seven debates this year, it is not probable
that the eastern university's proposal
will be accepted. The proposed date was
set for the first part of April, but such
a date would conflict with the Redlands
debate on the fifth of that month. The
Pacific Coast League contest, which is
to take place next week, and the later
debates with California and U. S. C.
will make it quite difficult to make satis
factory arrangements with Columbia.
