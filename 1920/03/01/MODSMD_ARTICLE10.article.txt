# Intra-Mural League Will Wind Up Its Schedule This Week
## 
### 
This week finds the intramural quin
tets running through their last games.
Leagues 3, 4, and 5 will complete their
schedule this week if nothing outside
interferes. Last Friday's games brought
on a tie in League 3, when the Delta
Kappa Epsilon five nosed out the men
from Encina (west) second. The game
was in doubt throughout the entire time
and ended in a score of 13 to 12, with
the fraternity men o:. the long cnyi.
Beta Theta Pi won from the Sequoia
third floor with an easy 18 to 11 points.
The match was a poor exhibition of
basketball, neither the fraternity nor
Hall men showing any interest in the
game. Alpha Delta Phi won from Phi
Delta Theta, 10 to 5. There were three
forfeits: Encina (west) first to Off
Campus, Alpha Tau Omega and Phi
Gamma Delta mutual, and Encina
(west) first and Phi Kappa Psi mutual.
Today the Off Campus basketeers
meet the Phi Gamma Deltas; Zeta Psi
and Encina (west) third clash. El Ca
mino will probably get a forfeit from
Encina (west) one, as the hall men are
at the bottom of their league.
Games scheduled for tomorrow are
Alpha Tau Omega vs. Eneina (west)
rive, Phi Kappa Psi vs. Encina (west)
three, and the San Jose Commuters vs.
Sequoia third.
