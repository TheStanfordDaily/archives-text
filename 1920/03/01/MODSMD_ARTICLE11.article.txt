# DRILLING OF ENCINA WELL BEGINS TODAY
## 
### 
The task of drilling the artesian
well in the Encina gymnasium grounds
was to have begun this morning. The
derrick was in place Saturday and if
the weather had not hampered, the
drilling would have been well under
way today. The Western Well Com
pany of San Jose has the contract
which calls for a depth of 300 feet.
The drilling will take about three
weeks but it will probably be eight
or ten weeks before the pump is in
stalled and in operation. The water
is for the swimming pool and later
for the showers. The cost of the well
will be about $4,500.
The name "artesial" came from
Artois, France, where there originated
the kind of well bored to a depth
where the water-pressure is great
enough to force the water out at the
surface.
