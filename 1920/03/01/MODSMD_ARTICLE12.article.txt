# FACULTY WOMEN'S PLAY IS SUCCESS
## 
### 
Scoring a decided success, "The
Collision," a play by Mrs. A. C. Huston,
member of the Faculty Women's Club
was presented at the club's basket
lunch in the Women's Clubhouse last
Friday evening. The cast was com
posed entirely of members of the
faculty, directed by the authoress, Mrs.
Huston.
The play dealt with the actions of
an overbearing and popular member
of a Stanford social club, who was
inclined to regard herself as superior
to her fellow members, but who
through a series of accidents, by
which the play derives its name, comes
to realize the true state of affairs and
mends her ways. The role was very
cleverly portrayed by Mrs. Whittier.
During the acts Mrs. S. S. Seward
entertained with a number of vocal
selections.
