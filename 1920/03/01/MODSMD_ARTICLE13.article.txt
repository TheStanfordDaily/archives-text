# STANFORD QUINTET TAKES CONFERENCE CHAMPIONSHIP
## U.C. FRESHMEN WIN BASKETBALL SERIES California Babes Take Second Game After Hard Fight 
### 
California took the freshman basket
ball series, when the Bruin babes won
a second game from the Stanford
"frosh" by a four-point margin, on the
Encina court, Saturday night. The Car
dinal team showed considerable improve
ment over their playing of the previous
week. The results of the two games
were 36-22 and 32-28.
Starting the game with a bang, vic
tory began to loom in sight for the Stan
ford men. They ran up eight points
before the Blue and Gold squad got
started, but soon lost the advantage,
ending the first half with an 18-to-17
score against the local team.
In the second half both sides started
with perfect playing and teamwork.
California maintained her lead through
out this period of play, but at no one
time had a margin of enough points to
be certain of victory.
Riebe caused Stanford's defeat. His
speed and unusual ability to handle the
ball was a problem too hard for the
Cardinal men to solve. Riebe, along
with Coop, California's captain, nearly
make up a basketball team by them
selves.
Stanford's skipoer, Rogers, played the
best game for the Red, making twelve
points of the total score. All of the
players played a good game, and deserve
no little credit for their playing during
the whole basketball season of 1919-20.
