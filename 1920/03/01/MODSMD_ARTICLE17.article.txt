# SQUAD WINS FOUR STRAIGHT GAMES ON OREGON TRIP
## Varsity Will Meet Blue and Gold Team Saturday Night 
### 
The following shows the relative
standing in the P. C. C. basketball
series:
Team W. L. Pet.
Stanford 8 1 .889
California 5 4 .556
W. S. C. 5 6 .456
O. A. C 5 7 .417
Washington 4 6 .400
Oregon 5 8 .385

Stanford virtually won the Pacific
Coast Conference basketball series, by
the Cardinal quintet winning four
straight games on the northern trip.
Whether Stanford is the winner of the
series against California this week, or
r.ot, the P. C. C. league percentage will
still leave the local five at the top.
Last Friday and Saturday nights, the
Oregon Agricultural College squad
went down to defeat before the Car
dinal team. The Oregon University
five suffered two defeats earlier in
the week to the Stanford men. Cali
fornia, already having two games
lost, went on their northern trip, and
lost two more games, one to Wash
ington State and one to Washington
University. These two defeats puts
the Blue and Gold out of the running
for first honors in the Conference.
Starting tomorrow afternoon, the
Varsity will begin strenuous practice,
in preparation for the second Stan
ford-California game, which will be
played in the Harmon gymnasium,
next Friday night. Should a third
game be necessary in this series, it
will be played on the following even
ing at Stanford.
