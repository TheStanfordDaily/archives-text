# THE
						LAST LAP
## 
### 
STANFORD may well be proud of the showing our basketball team made in
Oregon last week. For the second time this year, Cardinal teams have
shown the North what Stanford grit and spirit are. The southern invasion
will not be forgotten soon by our northern competitors.
We have done more, however, than show the Oregon universities Stan
ford excellence along athletic lines. We have established our place in the
Pacific Coast Conference. It is not without significance that Stanford had
a sensational football season and now in the basketball series added new
laurels to her athletic record. The first year of our membership in the Con
ference put us to a test and it is with considerable pride that the University
can look at those men who have so adequately represented the athletic tra
ditions of Stanford.
We are now entering upon the last lap for the Conference basketball
championship. The winning of our four games, two each with the University
of Oregon and the Oregon Agricultural College, has strengthened our lead.
Friday night we play California on the California court. If necessary a third
game will be played Saturday night at Stanford. Spectators will be allowed
at both games. Every Stanford man and woman knows, however, that if
the student body gets behind the team, Stanford will win. We should have
a record turn-out for both games, if two are played, and put Stanford over
the top.
