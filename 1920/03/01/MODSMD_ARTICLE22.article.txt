IN tonight's edition of the Daily Palo Alto, we offer a paper set solid for
*â–  the approval of the campus. The pressure for space decided us in taking
this step, as the equivalent of nearly two extra columns can be incorporated
in the same five columns of the paper. If the readers of the Daily Palo Alto
find the paper a little less easy to read, we ask campus indulgence as this
is merely an experiment in an attempt to solve one of the most pressing
problems connected with the paper.
