fFHE STANFORD FRESHMEN earned well-deserved praise in the game Sat
*â–  urday night with the California Babes. For a time it seemed as though
the jinx was lifted but in spite of their gritty fighting the tide turned against
our men. The game was well fought and credit is due the '23 men for their
showing.
