# All-British Rugby Men Win Over Americans
## 
### 
All-British rugby stars scored their
second consecutive victory over the
Ail-American fifteen on the local turf
Saturday afternoon, by a score of 18
to 3. The game was played as the
third of a series of four elimination
trials for the Olympic Games fifteen,
under the auspices of the California
Rugby Union. The play was fairly
even during the firbt half. In the last*
period, however, the all-around superi
ority of the All-British team was made
cl jar by 13 points scored as against
no tallies made by the Americans.
A solitary try constituted the only
American tally of the game, and, al
though made directly in front of the
goal posts, it was not converted.
Templeton converted three of the four
All-British tries.
The fourth and last game between
the rival fifteens will be played next
Saturday, and from the showing made
by the candidates on the teams will
be chosen the final squad which is to
represent the United States at Ant
werp.
