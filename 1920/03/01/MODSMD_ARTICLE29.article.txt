# Polo Squad Equipment Is Expected Here Soon
## 
### 
Equipment for the recently formed
polo squad has been sent to Captain Col
lins, of the R. O. T. C., and is expected
to arrive at any time. Practice has thus
far been carried on without standard
equipment, and the new materials will
be a great aid. The course is open only
to men enrolled in the field Artillery
Unit of the R. O. T. C.
Ten small horses were sent by the
War Department for the use of the polo
squad, and the local unit was already
provided with a number of suitable
horses, so there will be enough mounts
for the 35 men already out. As the
men are all inexperienced, there will
probably be no outside games this year.
