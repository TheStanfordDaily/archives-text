## 
### 
The Freshman baseball team made
its initial appearance 011 the local

able to bunch their hits effectively.
Kelly, pitching for the Freshmen,
allowed but five hits and struck out
ten men. The Commerce team had
men 011 the bases throughout the
game, but clever pitching coupled with
good support enabled Kelly to escape
each time without much damage be
ing done.

hits apiece and Welsh drove one past
the left-fielder for a home-run in the
fourth inning.
The freshmen have a promising

they should win the majority of their
games.
