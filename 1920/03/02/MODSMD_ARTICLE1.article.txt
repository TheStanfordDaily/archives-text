organization of the women's activities
was presented to the asesmbly by Miss
Anne Hardy, '21. The outstanding feat

board composed of representatives of
all women's activities such as W. A. A.,

our life aim; we should thus consider
something besides personal gain.

for the Methodist church, and Miss
Mary I. Bentley, the executive of the
