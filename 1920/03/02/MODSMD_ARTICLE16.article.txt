## Coach Rogers Sends Crews Through 17-Mile Row In Shell Trials 
### 
Unhampered by the adverse climatic
conditions, Stanford's crew men have
been working out daily on the Redwood
Estuary. Since Coach "Les" Rogers, *17,
announced his varsity, second varsity,
and freshmen squads last week, strict
training rules have gone into effect and
more or less permanent places in the
shells have been assigned.
Coach Rogers has a strong list of can
didates, practically all of them having
had previous experience in rowing. The
men are rapidly rounding into shape and
appear ready for a good racc already.
Financial difficulties may yet prevent
the entrance of the varsity eight in the
triangular regatta in the north with the
Universities of Washington and Califor
nia. This race had definitely been set
for May 7 on Lake Washington, but will
probably have to be advanced for May
22 because of final examinations being
held a tthe University of California on
the earlier date. If the Cardinal crew
does not go north, California and Wash
ington will compete in a dual regatta.
Because of the high tide yesterday and
today no rowing was done at Redwood,
but work will be resumed tomorrow.
Sunday afternoon Coach Rogers sent his
crews through a seventeen-mile row
down the bay and was very well pleased
with the way his men stood up under
the pace. The freshman crew is now
holding its own with the other eights in
practice rows and the men are all be
coming more accustomed to their work.
Despite the $4,000 surplus voted crew
by the student body, it will be an im
possibility to purchase a new shell this
year. As a result the old shells have
been thoroughly overhauled and are now
in first-class condition.
