# P.C.L. DEBATERS MAKE FINAL PREPARATIONS
## Annual Tri-State Forensic Contest Will Be Held This Week 
### 
Final preparations for the annual tri
angular forensic contest between Stan
ford, University of Washington, and
Oregon Universty, to T>e held on Fri
day of this week, have been made by the
Cardinal debaters. W. M. Kilpatrick,
23, and R. E. Fisher. '22, feave tonight
for Seattle, where they will vie for the
honors with the Washington team on
the question, "Resolved, That public
opinion should support labor in its move
ment for a closed shop." At the same
time Oregon will receive a team from
Washington, and Stanford, in turn, will
meet a team from Oregon on the local
platform. P. F. Frickson, '21, and C. J.
Crobaugh. '20, will uphold the affirma
tive for Stanford against Oregon.
Kilpatrick, who has been signing sick
reports in Hawaii for the last two years,
has created a sensation in local debating
circles by a display of unusual ability as
a speaker. His success in rating top
notch in his initial appearance, proves
him to be a valuable addition to varsity
debating teams.
Fisher has appeared on the platform
before in behalf of the Cardinal cause,
having taken part in a debate with
Southern California last year.
Together, these two will constitute a
formidable team, from whom Wnsliirur-
tun will experience the greatest difficulty
in wresting the honors.
Erickson and Crobaugh, who will sup
port the affirmative of the question in
the contest with Oregon, are both sea
soned debaters, whose arguments carry
the weight of their convictions.
Coach McClintock professes himself
pleased with the outcome of the past
six weeks' work. "Whether we win our
debates or not," he said, "we at least
can say that we have men in this col
lege who can stand on their two feet
and tell an audience what they have in
their minds without being forced to re
sort to a fixed speech. 1 am more than
pleased with the work of the squad and
1 anticipate a favorable outcome."
The affirmative team will arrive in
Seattle in time to get the latest news of
the labor disputes there, and will thus
be able to put a little local color in their
arguments.
The contest with Oregon will take
place in_ the Little Theater on Friday,
March 5, at 8:(X) p. m. The public is
invited to attend. i
