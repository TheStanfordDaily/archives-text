With a rccord of foilr straight vic
tories in the north to its credit, the var
sity basketball squad returned last night
and will settle down to a week's hard
practice in preparation for the second
game with California. It is to be played
next Friday night in Harmon gym
nasium.
Pelouze was the bright light of the
first game with Oregon, making six
field goals and seven fouls for a total
of nineteen points. Righter shone in
the second Oregon game, caging eight
field goals.
Mills was the star of both of the
O. A. C. games, tossing in eleven field
goals in the first game, and six field and
live foul shots in the second game.
By playing all his men on the trip,
Coach Evans kept his squad in good
condition, and will have a fit team for
the game next Friday.
If necessary a third game will be
played with U. C. on the local floor next
Saturday night.
