# TIME FOR DEFINITE ACTION
## 
### 
NUMEROUS editorials have been written on the subject of roughing and the
value of roughing as a tradition at Stanford. Numerous resolutions have
been passed by Student Councils and as many sentiments have been voiced
against vandalism on the part of the roughs at dances. The time has now
come for some kind of definite action.
On the front page of tonight's edition of the Daily Palo Alto is a state
ment of the activities of the roughs during the last week-end; also expres
sions from men, who are representative of campus opinion, on what they
think of roughing. There is hardly a man or woman on the campus who
would begrudge the rough the privilege of looking in on a dance, but when
that pivilege is abused to the extent that in order to give a party on the
campus one has to place refreshments under lock and key and hire a body
guard to keep your furniture from being destroyed, and on top of that have
chemicals thrown in on the party sufficiently strong in odor to make the
rest of the dance extremely unpleasant, then the time has come when the
roughs no longer deserve to have the privilege once extended.
It is understood that this matter is to come before the Men's Council.
Some talk has it that the Inter-Fraternity Conference is to discuss the ques
tion of roughing. The Daily Palo Alto believes that if the privilege of rough
ing is not withdrawn entirely (and we would see the custom go with con
siderable regret) that at least some very definite period of probation should
be outlined and if the roughs break that period of probation then the privilege
of roughing should be taken away with very definite penalties attached.
Student opinion can do more to solve this problem than any other one
thing. If any man or woman in the University knows that the campus as
a whole will disapprove of an action it is probable that very few students
would indulge in such practices. Smoking on Quad is an example of this.
Student opinion is against smoking and therefore it is not done. Why can't
the men and women of the campus formulate student opinion so definitely
that any action unbecoming a gentleman on the part of a rough will prac
tically be impossible? The tradition of roughing is a part of Stanford
democracy, but when that part of democracy becomes red-flag destruction,
then official student action and general campus opinion should prevent re
currences unworth of Stanford ideals and traditions.
