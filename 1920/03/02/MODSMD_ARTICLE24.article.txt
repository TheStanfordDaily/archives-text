# RIFLE MEN ARE HOLDING CONTEST
## 
### 
Shooting in the first intercollegiate
contest took place the latter part of last
week and the first part of this week.
The records are to be forwarded to
Washington. D. C., and there to be com
pared with the records of other colleges.
The authorities at Washington publish
a weekly bulletin of the standings of the
various American colleges and univer
sities.
The records made by the Stanford
rifle men are as follows: S. E. Vaughan,
184; R. B. Ardell, 182; T. O. Radcliffe,
164; W. W. Wegner, 160; J. C. Coman,
158; R. Murray, 143.
Three men, L. D. Wilbur, M. Steineke,
and H. Popeneo, have not shot yet, and
Sergeant Beard requests that those men
hand in their records as soon as possible,
so that the report need not be delayed
longer.
