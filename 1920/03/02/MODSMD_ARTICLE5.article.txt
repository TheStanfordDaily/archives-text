# Ram's Head Maiden Addles Wits of Pally Grocery Boy
## 
### 
There is a little grocery boy in Palo
Alto today who is dreaming of the
beautiful lady who came upon him while
he was performing his sordid duties of
delivering butter and coffee. How this
gorgeous stranger met this poor youth,
and, smiling upon him with eyes of love,
fired his imagination with romance,
reads like a fairy story.
Hut the grocery boy ought to have
kpown better. He should have known
that the days are past when fair dam
sels came out of their leafy bowers and
made violent love to passing knights.
Those days are past and the love-strick
en grocery boy must be disillusioned
The strange lady, whom the Palo
Alto youth met, was W. E. Prather, '23,
one of the stars in "Sin Sin," the Ram's
Head musical extravaganza, which will
lie given here on March 12, Prather
has the part of Lily Pucker in the
show and was one of a group of Ram's
Head comedians who were taken out
yesterday to the Lathrop home, back of
the campus, for the purpose of having
tlieir costume pictures taken. He is one
of the many skilled female impersona
tors in the cast who take all the wom
en's parts in the show.
Prather was dressed in costume to
fit the character of Lily Pucker, who is
the ingenue in the plot of "Sin Sin,"
and was egged on by his fellow-actors
to "vamp" the youth who happened to be
delivering groceries to a home near the
place where their out-door pictures were
being taken.
