## 
### 
Kenneth Saunders, Y. M. C. A.
worker and a student of Eastern re
ligions, last night discussed the nature
and importance of Buddhism in the
world today, in an illustrated lecture
given under the auspices of the Y.
M. C. A. in the Little Theater, in con
nection with the Inter-Church move
ment.
Dr. Saunders has been in Iudia for
many years and is now making a study
of the Buddist religion in America. Dr.
H. H. Bell, the other speaker of the
evening, is an associate recruiting
officer in the New York office in the
Inter-Church movement. He spoke of
the need of leadership of the nations
of the world, at the present time point
ing out America's answer in the
World War, and showing that it is
to America that these nations look for
the answer to their challenge of
leadership. According to the recent
survey made by his office, 1926 mis
sionaries are needed in foreign coun
tries this year. America must supply
this need, he said, largely from her
'schools and colleges.
Mr. Saunders, in his illustrated lec
ture which followed, showed the ad
vance made by Buddhism since the
birth of Guatama Budda, in 560 B.C.
India, lie said, is the greatest scene
for the trial of Christianity. It is for
us to give to people who have such
a good religion, a better one, and to
arrest the progress of the powerful
belief of Buddhism which now is fol
lowed by half the population of the
world. He showed slides illustrating
the religious customs of Buddhism,
and the forms it has taken in Japan
and China, showing the important
temples and images in these countries.
