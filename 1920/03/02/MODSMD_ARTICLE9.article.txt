# ROUGHING CAUSES DAMAGE
## Vandalism Arouses Campus Sentiment Prominent Students State Their Views of Roughing 
### 
Acts of vandalism which occurred
at all of the campus dances last week
end have been the cause of strong
campus feeling. It is certain that the
Men's Council will take up the matter
immediately, and some action will be
taken which will settle the question of
roughing either one way of another.
In the meantime the Daily Palo Alto
has asked for expressions of opinion
from a few men oa the campus who
represent student sentiment.
ROY KING, '19—"The tradition of
roughing at dances has long been one
of our most cherished traditions, and
now, due to the actions of a few
thoughtless and irresponsible persons,
that practice is in danger of being
abolished. The majority of Stanford
men are capable of enjoying this pri
vilege in a gentlemanly manner and
it is due only to the actions of a small
minority that the present situation
exists. Roughing is a part of our life
on the campus and every effort should
be made to retain this custom but at
the same time we should abolish the
vandalism which has of late character
ized it. Though we want to see the
custom continue, it would be far bet
ter to do away with it altogether than
to have any future repetition of the
actions of certain men during the last
few weeks."
F. A. BETTS, '19—"I am in favor of
roughing when it is done in the pro
per spirit because roughing is one of
Stanford's best traditions and should
be maintained. However, when
roughing is carried on as it was Sat
urday, I am unreservedly opposed to
it. I believe those guilty of the acts
of vandalism of Saturday night should
be punished. If it is impossible to
control such acts then roughing should
be abolished."
B. W. GILLESPIE, '17—"When the
true spirit of a Stanford tradition is
broken as I believe it was bv those
students guilty of the acts of vandal
ism Saturday night, it is time to in
vestigate the matter and to punish
those responsible."
C. S. HOBBS, '19—"Over the last
week-end the existence of a long
standing Stanford custom was serious
up jeopardized by the actions of a few
thoughtless persons. We all enjoy
this harmless week-end sport of look
ing in at the various campus affairs
with the hopeful expectation of a hand
out now and then, and would hate to
see the ban placed on roughing. It
is clearly the duty of every man who
has the interest of Stanford at heart
to see to it that the actions of other
Stanford men are at all times those of
gentlemen."
W. I. AMES, '17—"I am opposed to
roughing when done in the spirit it
was Saturday night. If a good Stan
ford tradition cannot be perpetuated
because a certain few take delight in
violating it, then it is time to punish
those guilty of the offense."
S. E. BRIGGS, '19—"Roughing as it
was carried on last Saturday night is
an imposition and should not be tole
rated at Stanford. It will soon cause
the elimination of decent roughing.
Those who were implicated last Satur
day should be punished."
B. C. WOHLFORD, '18—"When the
privilege of roughing is willfully vio
lated and acts of pue and simple van
dalism are done, it will be neeessarv
to either punish those guilty or else
stop roughing altogether. When done
in the proper way, I am in favor of
roughing."
Every weed-end dance lias brought
about a worse condition of affairs for
some time, but the record of last Satur
day night brought matters to a crisis.
Tt is believed that the Men's Council
will be guided by the opinion of the stu
dent body in their action dealing with
the question of "roughing" at dances.
