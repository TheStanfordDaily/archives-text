HERE'S where the particular smoker
meets the particular smoke
Chesterfield.
Particular is right! Not only do wef
use the four choicest varieties of Turkish)
tobacco—Xanthi, Cavalla, Smyrna and
Samsoun—but to these we add the rich,j
sun-ripened leaves of specially choice!
Domestic tobacco.
Fine as these tobaccos are, it's the
exclusive process by which they are
blended that gives to Chesterfields that
satisfying body, that mellow richness
which makes a smoke mean something.
Chesterfields certainly do satisfy as no «
other cigarette has satisfied you before—
and to top it off, they are packed in a
glassine paper package that preserves
for you all of that delicious flavor.
