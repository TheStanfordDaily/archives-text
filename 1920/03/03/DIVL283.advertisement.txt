"FRAMED UP"
A Two-Reel Jester Comedy
It's dollars
to doughnuts—
no man ever smoked
a better cigarette at
any price!
CAMELS quality, and
their expert blend of
choice Turkish and choice
Domestic tobaccos hand you
a cigarette that will satisfy
every smoke desire you ever
expressed. You will prefer
this Camel blend to either
kind smoked straight!
Camels mellow-mildness
will certainly appeal to you.
The "body" is all there, but
that smoothness! It's a
delight!
Go the limit with Camels!
They will not tire your taste.
And, they leave no un
pleasant cigaretty aftertaste
or unpleasant cigaretty odor!
Just compare Camels
with any cigarette in the
world at any price!
