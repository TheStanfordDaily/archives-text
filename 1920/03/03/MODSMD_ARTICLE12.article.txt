# DR. WILBUR SPEAKS AT NEW YORK CIVIC FORUM
## President Portrays Character of Herbert Hoover in Eastern Address 
### 
Speaking before the New York Civic
Forum, which two weeks ago presented
Herbert Hoover with its much-coveted
medal, President Wilbur recently por
trayed the character of Hoover. The
speech was made during President Wil
bur's trip in the jiast.
"The voluntary features of the Food
Administration will always stand as a
monument to our particular democracy,
and to our form of government," said
Dr. Wilbur. "It was made possible by-
Mr. Hoover's inborn grasp of the best
in American life, and because the un
conscious self-expression of his own
heart compelled profound understanding
of the people of the United States. His
intense loyalty and faith in the United
States has been a predominant charac
teristic. No man to whom Lincoln has
been a constant guiding star could be
otherwise. In all his great relief work
there has been in his heart the desire
to do everything possible for the honor
of his country."
In concluding, Dr. Wilbur said, "The
name of Herbert Hoover will be remem
bered in America, not because of his or
ganizing genius, bis fertility of resource
in action, his scientific achievements, but
because he has typified in his service
those qualities of mind and heart that
we love to consider truly American."
Wilbur Speaks
In Chicago
I)r. Ray Lyman Wilbur addressed
the Annual Congress of Medical Edu
cation at Chicago, Monday, on the sub
ject of the care of the insane. The
situation as regards our insane hos
pitals was described as "terrible."
Emphasizing needs for teaching hos
pitals in every large city, he said, "We
put tens of thousands ot' the mentally
sick into great isolated institutions,
largely without medical students or
training schools for nurses. The ig
norance of the average medical man
of psychology and psychiatry is pain
ful. When the existing medical in
stitutions become centers of educa
tion of one form or another we envy
the physical comfort and happiness of
the race."
