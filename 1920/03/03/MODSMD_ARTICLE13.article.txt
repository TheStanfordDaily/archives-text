# Encina Club Votes For The "Sponsor" System
## 
### 
11l order to aid freshmen in getting
on the boat, Encina Club voted last
night to inaugurate what is called the
sponsor system, whereby each first-year
man will select some tipperclassman to
whom he will go for advice and infor
mation concerning Stanford customs and
traditions. It was pointed out at the
meeting that the abolishment of such
things as telephone duty, by means of
which freshmen came in contact with
a good many men, is making it increas
ingly hard for them to get on the boat.
It is hoped that the new system will do
much to remedy this condition. A com
mittee of three has been appointed to
manage the inauguration of the sponsor
plan.
