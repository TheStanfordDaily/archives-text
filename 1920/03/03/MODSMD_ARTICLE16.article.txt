# MANY INTRA-MURAL BASKETBALL TEAMS FORFEIT CONTESTS
## 
### 
The basketball schedule of the intra
mural teams this week has been marked
chiefly by a series of forfeits. On Mon
day there were no games, Phi Gamma
Delta forfeiting to the Off Campus five,
Zeta Psi to Encina west third, and En
cina west first forfeited to the El Ca
mino Club. The latter forfeit puts the
El Camino team in a good way to make
a bid for the interleague championship.
Yesterday the San Jose Commuters
squeezed out the Sequoia third quintet
with a 1 l-to-13 score. The men on both
teams showed some very good form,
and the final whistle stopped the game
just at an opportune time for the San
Jose men. The two other games sched
uled for the day failed to materialize
when none of the contestants showed up.
According to Coach Acker, who is in
charge of the intramural leagues, today's
games should be hotly contested. Beta
Theta Pi meets the husky Breakers five,
and as both teams are next to the head
of -the league, there ought to be a hot
fight for the decision. Encina fourth
floor clashes when the east and west
ends of that floor meet this afternoon.
The standing of the two hall teams is
equal and neither intends to allow the
other to get the lead. Phi Kappa Sig
ma meets Sigma Alpha Epsilon. Games
scheduled for this evening are Alpha
Delta Phi vs. Sequoia second, Phi Delta
Theta vs. Encina east second, and Chi
Psi vs. El Toro.
Tomorrow the Delta Taus meet the
Delta Upsilon quintet. The Delta Upsi
lons are at the head of their league and
show a speedy exhibition of basketball.
Delta Kappa Epsilon is matched with
Sequoia first, and Sigma Chi against En
cina cast basement.
