# COACH EVANS' MEN READY FOR CLASH WITH BRUIN FIVE
## Stanford-California Series To Be Finished This Week 
### 
Coach Evans' basketball five will be
pitted against California's quintet and
Coach Hollander's system Friday, at
Berkeley, in the first real test of the two
styles of play taught by master pilots.
Coach Hollander, with his unique sys
tem of play, was last year successful in
every way against the Stanford com
bination. ilowever. in the contest with
the Bruin team a month ago, the Car
dinal five seemed to have mastered ev
ery department of its opponents' play,
as well as to have strengthened the vul
nerable points of its own offensiveâ€”
for only because of the Cardinals' lade
of ability to score free throws was Cali
fornia superior in winning foul points.
If Stanford is able, Friday night, to
choke the floor work of the bears as ef
fectively as in the last battle, and if
they can at the same time put a few
more free throws through the ring,
there should be no need of a third
game Saturday.
Too much stress, however, should not
be placed on the outcome of the trips
made *by the two teams, as the Blue and
Gold and the Cardinal fives both have
styles of play entirely different from
tiiat of any of the northern combina
tions. The outcome of the Stanford-
California contest can not in any way
be determined by the results of the
northern invasions.
