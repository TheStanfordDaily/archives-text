# Women's Service Board Wants More Support
## 
### 
The Women's Service Board wishes
to have more women interested in the
Convalescent Home for Lane Clinic
Children, which is being maintained
in the old Acacia house. The work
of the homo is supported by subscrip
tions, and entertainment of the chil
dren is the work of the Woman's Ser
vice Board. This is the only social
service activity now being carried on
by the Stanford women, and the board
is anxious to have more women volun
teer to take the children walking or
driving in the afternoons, or to enter
tain the children at the Home.
The children are sent down from the
Lane Clinic in San Francisco for a
period of two weeks. They are usu
ally about fifteen children in the home,
frohi four to fourteen years of age.
The financial report of the Homp is
carried on by a committee of which
T>r. Gardner is chairman. Campus
women wishing to become interested
in the work of the Home may see
Margaret White, '22. who is in charfcw
of the entertainment of the children.
