# SATURDAY AND PRE-WAR RUTS
## 
### 
SATURDAY night's escapade in roughing, strikes a deeper note than the
mere surface of the incident might suggest. One of the real tragedies of
war is the ease with which the people of a nation forget, ignore, or turn
aside from the fine idealism of the late conflict. This tendency to revert to
old customs is manifested in every community and probably takes on a
different aspect with each individual group. It may be the abuse of roughing,
It may be vice, it may be graft, but the underlying force is the same.
Tremendous efforts have been made by numerous organizations through
out the United States to 3ave this nation from slipping back into the pre
war ruts. Speakers have been sent out in the interests of various move
ments but all had the same end. When all is said and done, however, the
only effective check lies in individual responsibility, and in the realization
of the cheapness of the reaction. Those men who indulged in the petty,
small-boy amusement last week-end probably went into it impulsively but the
university man has a responsibility which cannot be guided by impulse. The
university men and women of this country are important factors in saving
at least a small portion of the war's idealism which alone justified the sacri
fice of the battlefield.
The symbol of all that is fine in Stanford manhood hangs in the Me
morial Church. Each star represents some personal sacrifice and the gold
stars the sacrifice supreme. Every rian and woman of the University owes
something to the ideal for which the Service Flag stands and it is this obli
gation which will not allow us to tolerate such behavior as has just been
forced upon the attention of the campus.
