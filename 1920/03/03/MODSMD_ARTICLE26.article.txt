# NEW LAURALS FOR COACH EVANS
## 
### 
F' was with considerable regret and protest that the student body received
the decision of the Board of Athletic Control dismissing Coach Evans in
the early part of this quarter. Since the victorious invasion of the North by
the Cardinal quintet, Coach Evans has won a place in the heart of the men
and women of the campus who will now view Evans' departure with even
deeper regret.
Both in football and basketball, Coach Evans has shown a wonderful
ability to put out a winning team. Stanford's work in the Big Game this
year put the University back on the map among the other colleges of the
United States as far as American football is concerned. Today Stanford has
one of the finest basketball teams ever put out and we recognize the large
amount of credit Coach Evans deserves in this.
In both of the games, Coach Evans has shown a remarkable ingenuity
and originality. Both teams are known as having played a unique game.
Evan√ü believes in using brains, and headwork has made Stanford's eminent
place in Pacific Coast athletics this year. At all times, he has developed
individual initiative in his players and has commanded the respect of the
men working under him. The results of his methods speak for themselves.
When the time comes for Coach Evans to leave, Stanford will lose a man
who has proved himself capable of living up to the athletic traditions of the
University. It will be with the sincerest regret that the students of Stanford
will see Coach Evans leave at the end of his term.
