# INTERCLASS TRACK MEET WILL BE HELD TOMORROW
## Holdover Show and Irish Marathon Are Postponed Till Wednesday 
### 
Because of the freshman track meet
with Oakland Technical High School
Saturday, Coach Maloney of the track
team decided to hold the interclass meet
tomorrow afternoon at 4 p. m.
The senior, junior, sophomore and
freshman classes will enter teams and in
addition the holdovers will engage in
the competition. The holdovers have
i several strong men on their list and
they will give the other teams a hard
race for honors. Coach Maloney is
especially anxious that each class turn
out with a large team, as the prime pur
pose of the meet is to get a line on pos
sible material for the varsity.
The Irish Marathon will be held on
Wednesday of next week, and the four
classes and the holdovers will enter
teams in the distance race. As a part of
the afternoon's program, the holdovers
will present their annual Holdover Show
â€”which always provides amusement for |
the bleachers.
The freshmen will make their first
formal appearance on the track Satur
day, against a team from Oakland
"Tech." Coach Art Acker has not had
time to give much attention to his team
on account of basketball, but he will put
a strong squad up against the visitors.
