# Y.W.C.A. TO DISCUSS INDUSTRIAL PROBLEMS
## 
### 
An open discussion on the industrial
questions, which will be voted on at
the Y. W. C. A. convention this coming
April, will be held at the Y. W. C. A.
meeting in the Women's Clubhouse,
Thursday afternoon at 5:00 o'clock. At
the Industrial Convention held in Wash
ington, D. C., this last October, the
women representing the various indus
trial units drayv up a resolution contain
ing seven main points, which they are
asking the national Y. W. C. A. to rec
ognize. These points cover the problems
of minimum wage, working hours, work
ing conditions, child labor, and the right
of collective bargaining.
The Stanford branch of the organiza
tion will have a vote at the convention
where these points will be decided, and
for this reason a straw vote will be
taken at the meeting to determine the
sentiment of the members. This is one
of the two important issues to be
brought up at the convention, and all
members are asked to attend the meet
ing and cast their votes.
