the raising of wheat and sheep and em
ployed "Sam," custodian of the athletic
fields, to look after the work, in addi
tion to his regular duties on the ath
letic fields.
",Sam" said yesterday that the rain
lias been worth $2,000 to his crops. Not
only the wheat but the sheep are much
benefited by the rainfall. This fanning
is of interest to the students when they
see that the money made is used to fur
ther their interests in athletics.
Sam has been very successful in the
work and has been able to profitably add
100 more sheep to the flock. As Sam
said that additional rain will be worth
$1,000 a day, the Board may soon be
the wealthiest organization of the Uni
