Mallory Hats for University Mew
Have three hats!
How can you expect one lone liat to behave like a
chameleon and harmonize with nil the different suits and
shirts 'and ties you wear ?
Well-dressed men now change their hats as thev change
their suits.
It is stylish and economical. Your hats not only look
better, but they wear longer.
The Hatters are now showing the new Mallory Spring
Models. Go take a look at them--and try on three
different ones. You'll get the idea at once.
