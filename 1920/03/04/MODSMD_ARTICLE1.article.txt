# RAM'S HEAD SHOW HAS UNIQUE CHARACTER PART
## M.D. Flowers Does Clever Avoirdupois Bit As Little Violet 
### 
Easily the most remarkable and ori
ginal character conception that has ap
peared on the local boards in years, is
the character of "Little Violet," played
by M. D. ("Fat") Flowers, '17, in "Sin
Sin." In creating this character the co
authors of the Ram's Head extrava
ganza, S. E. Briggs. '19, and M. L. Levy,
'19, have brought forth a refreshing
change from the usual run of avoirdu
pois comedy.
Little Violet is the senior partner in
the reforming firm of Violet and Wie
land Gulp. A glance at the compara
tive physical specifications of Violet and
Gulp, whose part is played by J. P.
Schnicr, '20, is bound to give one some
idea of why Violet is the senior partner
of this redoubtable company of reform
ers. As far as weight goes, Violet
might be putin the unlimited class.
When Gulp measures up beside her bulk,
a striking contrast in size is achieved.
The authors have endowed her with
a rich and flowing vocabulary of slang.
As a result, in Violet's most heated mo
ments of reforming zeal, she is never
at loss for some apt phrase to choose
from her quaint and extensive slang col
lection. Take this as a sample:
Violet (to Wieland Gulp) : "Run
along, little rash, you irritate me. Go
on, and take your eczema ointment.''
This leading "female" comedy part in
"Sin Sin" is remarkably well-filled by
Flowers, who is an actor of wide ex
perience. Flowers appeared here a few
years ago in a Sword and Sandals play
and later, while serving in France, he
was connected with the managing end
of the government theatrical bureau that
supervised the entertainment of the
American overseas forces.
