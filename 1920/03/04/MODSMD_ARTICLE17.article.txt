# O Chimeless Chapel Queeners Hit Hard
## 
### 
Chapel chimes have not sounded after
10 at night, for more than two months.
Dean McDowell, upon being complained
to, denied the silence in the wee, small
hours. He insisted that times had not
changed, but that somnolence muffled
the longing tars of the campus. Comp
troller Roth, however, as reviewing au
thority, said the sudden silence was due
to Superintendent Hewston's parting re
quest, that the bells be stilled from 10
at night till 6 in the morning. As a
result, campus queeners are "out of
luck." "Used to be hard enough to obey
the rules when the warning peals called
us home," they wail. "Oh, mister, please
give us back them poignant notes."
