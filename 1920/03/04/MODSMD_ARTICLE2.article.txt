# FRESHMAN NINE WINS SECOND GAME ON LOCAL DIAMOND
## 
### 
Palo Alto High School lost to the
freshman baseball teatn yesterday after
noon on the local diamond, by a score of
10 to 0.
It was the second appearance this
season of the babes, and although the
game was somewhat ragged, it brought
out some good material for a freshman
team.
Coach "Ken" Lilly used practically all
of his men in the game in an effort to
get a line on the players he will use in
future games.
The line-up of the teams at the start
of the game was:
Palo Alto High—Aytelot, c.; Shedd,
p.; A. Green, lb.; Herrington, 2b.;
Klein, 3b.; W. Hayes, If.; C. Hayes, cf.;
Card, rf.; Howe, p.
Stanford Freshmen—G. Green, c.;
Schwartz, p.; Silen, lb.; Pearcy, 2b.;
Patterson, ss.; Kelly, 3b.; R. Green, rf.;
R. Welch, If.; Thomas, cf.
Next Saturday the freshmen will play
Mountain View High School on the
Stanford field.
