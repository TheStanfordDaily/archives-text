"The Song of the Banjo," "Gunga
Din," "Mandalay," and selections from
the "Seven Seas" and the "Five Na
tions," were among the poems by Kip
ling which were read by Professor L.
E. Bassett at an informal reading given
under the auspices of the English De
partment yesterday afternoon.
Before each poem Professor Bassett
gave a short account of it's nature and
position in the classification of Kipling's
verse, choosing poems representative of
his different types of poetry. A few
years ago, a new poem by Kipling was
regarded as an international event, Pro
fessor Bassett said, and the "Reces
sional" and"The Female of the Species"
were cabled across the Atlantic ocean.
He characterized Kipling's verse style as
an aggressive, virile form of poetry
written about men and women, life and
death, things he knew about and things
he did not.
"The Gods of the Copy Book Max
ims," Kipling's most recent poem, Dr.
Bassett considers to be the best ex
ample of his irony and satirical style.
