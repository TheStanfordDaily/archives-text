## Stanford Will Start Game With Edge on U.C. Basketers 
### 
Tomorrow night Stanford will have
a chance to win the three-game basket
ball series between the University of
California and Stanford. "This will be
the second game of the series, the Cardi
nal quintet having defeated the Blue
and Gold squad last month. Referee
Harris is to start the match at 8 o'clock
on the Rerkeley Harmon gymnasium
court. Should the bay city university
win Friday night's contest, the two teams
will be matched against each other o*
the Encina floor Saturday night.
For the first time since basketball was
made a major sport, the Stanford five
will start the game with an edge on Cal
ifornia. Although the Cardinal has
taken several games in the competition
against the California quintets, the five
from the "farm" has never been success
ful enough to take a scries.
The squad will work out on the Har
mon gymnasium floor, today and tomor
row, in order that they may accustom
themselves to the longer floor. Coach
Kvans will not announce the definite
line-up that will start the game until
tomorrow, but it is expected that he will
start the five that has been used to
start most of the Conference contests.
Righter is certain of holding down
one of the forward positions, while
Evans has not decided whether to use
Captain Pelouze or Davies in the other
position. Pelouze's record in the Ore
gon game will probably give him the
edge on Davies. Mills will undoubtedly
start in the line-up at center, while Butts
and Adams will fill the defensive posi
tions of the team.
