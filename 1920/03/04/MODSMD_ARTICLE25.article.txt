## 
### 
A large audience heard Professor
Perry Martin's address at the Classical
Club meeting last night. He spoke upon
the Greek arts, and traced in an inter
esting manner the growth of Greek mu
sic, showing its relation to Greek poetry.
Several selections were given in illustra
tion of this point, some of which showed
a modern trend.
The program also included solos by
Mr. M. Waters, and a Greek dance by
Miss Clytie Sweet from "Iphigenia and
Aulis." Refreshments were served.
