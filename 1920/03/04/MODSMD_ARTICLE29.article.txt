# TWO CLASHES IN DEBATE
## 
### 
TWO Stanford men. W. M. Kilpatrick, '23, and R. E. Fisher, '22, have gone
to Seattle to represent Stanford in the forensic contest tomorrow night,
with the University of Washington. On the home platform, P. F. Erickson,
'21, and C. J. Crobaugh, '20, will uphold the Cardinal argument with Oregon.
Few students on the campus appreciate the large amount of work and train
ing which is necessary to turn out a winning team. Coach McClintock has
been working with his men for some months and every possible effort has
been made to put out the best possible teams. Stanford has failed to give
the support which debating really deserves during the last few years. Big
debates at California are well attended and there is no reason why the
campus should not turn out strong behind our men. In appreciation of the
effort put into debating by our own men and in courtesy to the Oregon
visitors, the student body should have a good representation tomorrow night
in the Assembly Hall.
