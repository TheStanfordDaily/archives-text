Rugby Game Saturday. Admis
sion 55 cents, plus war tax. Women
free.
Apropos of women's rights, how
about men's rights? Many a man who
had doubtless spent his 55 cents, or
more, taking his lady to the "shifties,"
Friday night, turned away from the
gate Saturday while said lady went
sweetly in. Equality, where is thy
sting?
—oOo —
Now that the rain has brought
peace to the erstwhile tormented deni
zens of the Lagunita, namely the
frogs, we wonder what the golf en
thusiasts will do. Play croquet prob
ably.
—oOo —
Now that the roughs are becoming
so obstreperous, we remember with
mingled pain and joy the days not
long past when any man roughing at
a dance was invited without much
ceremony to leave the campus. Not
that we desire that but —forewarned
is forewarned.
—oOo —
Since the rain has come, disillusion
ment has followed in its trail. Roughs
may be rough, but what is rougher

than a rough carrying a blue silk um
brella. 's a fact. We saw him.
—oOo —
Politeness is getting to be a lost
art when mere man clambers onto
these ultra-rapid vehicles of transit,
otherwise known as Peninsula Rail
way cars, leaving the women to fol
low in their wake. But, then, what
can one expect in these days of the
aforesaid women's rights?
—ooo —
Since the good old days of "Ten
Nights in a Bar-room" have succumbed
to "Ten Eves in a Bevo Room," our
collegians must still have something
to amuse themselves with. Jin —rick-
shaws are the latest. Time —5:30.
Place, Lagunita Drive, near the Post
office. Participants, two young gentle
men in track attire. Senior seated in
the horseless carriage, while young
freshman plays horse. Moral—When
you haven't got a buzz-wagon, use
your frosh.
