# COACH EVANS' WORK IS DISCUSSED BY STUDENTS
## Letters to Daily Palo Alto Show success in Athletics 
### 
The Daily Palo Alto has received the
following communications, which ex
plain themselves:
Your editorial in yesterday's issue
of the D. P. A. expressing an appreci
ation of the work of Coach Evans in
turning out Stanford's first winning
basketeball team, raises in my mind
the question, "Why is Coach Evans
not being retained at Stanford?"
Upon reflection, it must seem to
every student, a most unusual situa
tion in athletic affairs, when a coach
who has demonstrated his ability as
Evans has done is not retained to con
tinue his successful work.
The Board of Athletic control has
announced that Evans will not be
reappointed. There seems to be no
definite explanation of the reasons for
such action, and the general student
body is left entirely in the dark to
conjecture about the matter.
Inasmuch as the general student
body is most closely connected and
associated with athletics; since it sup
plies material for the teams, the funds
and the moral support necessary for
athletic competition, it would not
seem unreasonable that they, through
their representatives should mainly
determine such a vital question of
athletic policy, as the personnel of the
coaching staff. At least the consider
ation of the question should be largely
guided by the expression of general
student body sentiment.
I am confident that the student body
as a whole is amazed at the present
situation. For the first time in the
memory of the writer Stanford has
produced a Championship Basketball
Team. Since the material for the
team is practically the same as has
existed in recent years, our success
can only be ascribed to the ability of
the coach. Last year for the first
time since 1913 a Stanford baseball
team under Coach Evans' direction
succeeded in defeating California.
Lastly, the 1919 Stanford football team
coached by Evans made an extraordi
nary showing, in the face of general
prediction of certain defeat. There is
not a parallel in western athletics with
this record.
In the face of this demonstration of
ability, Coach Evans is not to be re
appointed, and no particular reason is
assigned. It seems tnat if a matter
of salary stands in the way of his
re-appointment, that basis of com
promise might be found. If some other
reason lies behind the action of the
Board of Athletic Control, a recon
sideration of the question in the light
of recent events might serve to find
a solution.
I have no wish to embarrass the
action of the Board of Athletic Con
trol, nor to in any way impugn their
judgment. They, no doubt, have not
acted without cause. Nevertheless,
after reflecting upon Mr. Evans' rec
ord, it seems that every attempt
should be made to remove any ob
stacles that stand in the way of his
appointment.
In view of the foregoing are the
students not justified in asking that
the Board reconsider its action?
G. W. DRISCOLL, JR., '18.

I. C. Heron writes as follows:
Since the decision of the Board of
Athletic Control to refuse to retain
Coach Evans there has been a grow
ing tendency on the part of the stu
dents who support and make up Stan
ford teams to question the wisdom of
this action. In the brief year that
Coach Evans has had charge of ath
letics here he has taken absolutely
raw material and made a football team
that stood second to none on the Pa
cific Coast in downright ability and
pluck. Last year for the first time in
seasons Stanford won the baseball
series from California and this year
for the first time Stanford has brought
the title of Pacific Coast Conference
basketball champions to the Quad.
The editorial in last night's Daily
Palo Alto expressed the lack of un
derstanding of this decision by the
â€¢Dutj.ru ui Aimeuc uoniroi. wacn day
on the Quad and in the different
houses we have heard groups asking
"Why dod we let Coach Evans ?"
The writer believes there is but one
answer; that the Board of Athletic
Control did not understand student
opinion. If an election to decide the
position of Coach Evans were held
tomorrow it would be a landslide in
favor of retaining him.
The writer has had the pleasure of
working as trainer with Evans for the
past two seasons and in this capacity
has formed the following opinions:
that every man who has played under
Evans respects his personality, ad
mires liis ability to turn out winning
teams and strives to imitate his meth
ods of "putting everything in the
game" in that hard clean way we
call Stanford Spirit; every student
who lias watched Evans' teams play
realizes the almost miraculous ability
he has for combining brain and brawn
into a perfectly co-ordinated team.
Evans has made athletes out of men
who never knew what the word meant.
More than any other Stanford coach,
he has striven to give every candidate
a fair deal no matter whether he was
the college hero or the poorest novice.
The writer sincerely believes that
Bob Evans should be retained an
coach of the Stanford teams and if
Stanford students will let the Board
of Athletic Control know their true
opinions we believe there will be a
reconsideration of Evans as the Stan
ford coach.
