# OLYMPIC RUGGERS TO PLAY FINAL MATCH
## All-American and All-British Fifteens Meet Again Saturday 
### 
Preparations for the fourth and last
elimination rugby contest for the Olym
pic games squad, to be played here Sat
urday at 3 p. m., under the auspices of
the California Rugby Union, have been
completed by the selection committee.
All-British and All-American fifteens
will meet on Saturday in their third
struggle for supremacy. After the game
the final squad will be chosen, and will
go into immediate training for the big
event. After several practice matches
on this side of the water, many of which
will probably be played at Stanford since
a great part of the team should be com
posed of university athletes, the team
will journey to England, where several
more important contests are being ar
ranged.
By the time rugby is called at the Ant
werp classics, the team expects to have
attained perfect form. The only diffi
culty the coaches expect to encounter in
training the men is lack of consistent
team-work, caused by the fast that so
many individual stars are playing to
gether for the first time.
