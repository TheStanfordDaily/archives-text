# OREGON DEBATERS MEET STANFORD ON PLATFORM TONIGHT
## Contest at Little Theater Is One of Three-Cornered Coast League Fight

Tri-state debating honors, between
Oregon, Washington, and Stanford Uni
versities, will be settled tonight in three
forensic contests on the question, "Re
solved, That organized labor, in its move
ment for a closed shop, should receive
the support of public opinion." Oregon
and Stanford will clash here at Stan

at Seattle, and Washington and Oregon
at Eugene, will compete the triangular

Kenneth Armstrong and Paul Patterson,

While Erickson and Crobaugh debate,
with Oregon, W. M. Kilpatrick, '23, and
R. E. Fisher, '22, will be fighting a for
ensic battle for Stanford with the Uni
versity of Washington at Seattle. Kil
patrick and Fisher left Stanford for
