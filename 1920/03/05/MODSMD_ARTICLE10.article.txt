# STANFORD HAS EDGE ON CALIFORNIA FIVE TONIGHT
## GAME PLAYED AT U.C Teams Will Play on Encina Court Tomorrow Night If U.C. Wins 
### 
Stanford and California will meet on
the Harmon gymnasium floor tonight,
for the second game of the basketball
series between the two rival universities,
ff the Cardinal quintet is victorious, the
series will be finished; but a third game
will be played on the Encina court Sat
urday night should the Blue and Gold
five have the longer end of the score.
For the first time in the history of
basketball on the "farm," Stanford will
start the game with a edge on
tin Bruins. Although Cardinal teams
have taken a few gamee from California,
a complete series have never ( been won.
Coach Hollander's men have been im
proving the caliber of their playing to
such an extent; since the first game of
the series, and they will be no easy mark
for the Cardinal quintet.
Captain Pelouze and Righter will start
the game at the forward positions.
Righter is the old Cardinal stand-by,
when goals arc needed. Last year he
was captain and played at the center
position. Captain Pelouze, although he
lias been out of play during a large part
of this season due to an injury received
in the game against Nevada, is once
more in perfect condition. His demon
stration in the north last week, running
up 19 points in the first Oregon game,
has assured him of his old place in the
line-up.
Adams and Butt will fill the defensive
positions in the game against California
tonight. Both of these men have been
in the line-up to start a majority of thfe*
season's Conference games. Mills, who
always plays a consistent game at the
center position, will also be on the line
up to start the match.
Davies. Hood, and Austin arc the most
promising p|ayers that will have an op
portunity of playing in the contest to
night. Davies, who has been playing
forward until the return of Pelouze,
will probably substitute for the captain
in the second half. Hood will be used
as a utility man for either forward or
center. His accuracy in goal shooting,
especially foul shots, makes him a valu
able man on the squad. Austin will sub
stitute for the guard positions.
