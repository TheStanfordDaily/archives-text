# Party Choice is Not Required in Primary Election
## 
### 
Voters at thte California Presidential
Preferential Primary election, May 4,
may choose their ballot at the polls
regardless of party affiliation made at
the time of registration, according
to a statement by J. M. Cremin, elec
tion expert in v the office of Secretary
of State Frank C. Jordan.
Cremin quoted from opinions by At
torney-General U. S. Webb, and Lieu
tenant-Governor C. C. Young, author
of the primary election act, and said
his statement was intended to cor
rect what seemed to be a widespread
belief that when a voter "declined to
state" his party affiliations when re
gistering he would be barred at the
polls from using a party ballot.
