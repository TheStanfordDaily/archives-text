The setting of "Sin Sin"" is at Hare
ford CcfUegc, which, according to thv
plot, is the home of the "spree" and all
the rest of the collegiate vices. The
only election that is hotly contested at
Ham ford is the race for vice-president,
who is the man who manages all the
vice. The first act of the show presents
Ham ford's morality at its lowest ebb.
Students go about the stage, actually
drinking!
Hut in the second act, Hamford i
pulled out of the mire by two conscien
tious roformers, Little Violet and Wie
land Gulp. Comedy situations pile up od
top of one another until the startling
denouement is reached.
The Ram's Head production strikes a
satirical note in its application to local
situations. Two of the feature songs
in the show point out this trend very
well. One of these is, "That's What I
Pay Tuition For,"and the other, "Why
Don't the Pretty Girls Come to Col
lege." The titles almost speak for them
selves, as well as for the rest of the
show. The lyrics were written by M. L.
Levy, '19, and S. E. Briggs, '19.
