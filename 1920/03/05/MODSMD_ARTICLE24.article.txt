# SPRING SPORTS WELL UNDER WAY
## 
### 
OPRING sports are well under way with the opening ol' the baseball and track
seasons. Crew, also, is under way and men are turning out well for all
of the activities. Our brilliant record in football and basketball has set a
standard for the spring sports which will necessitate their shooting high.
It, is often noted that after a man has been under a tension for a certain
length of time, he starts sliding and this fact can often be applied to a student
body. Our after-war athletics have started off with a boom and Stanford has
a record which she can look at with justifiable pride. We know that the
men who are turning out for spring sports are doing all in their power to
keep up the splendid yrork which has been started. The coaches are de
moting an infinite amount of time and energy toward perfecting the work o£
the men in training. The students of the University will have to come
through with the best support ever.
The end of the quarter is fast approaching and the worries of final ex
aminations are imminent. It is just about this time that the sliding begins.
The same thing is true of the year as a whole. Only a few months are left
before the current year will be over and it is in the spring that we usually
'begin to slide. Spring sports deserve the backing of every man and woman
tn the University. We have started on the last lap and we must carry Stan
ford athletics through to a big finale in Spring Sports.
