# A 						SIGNIFICANT MONUMENT IN HISTORY

AN international movement has been started toward raising funds for a
' monument which will be one of the most significant touch-stones in
history.: 'Just as the.Field of Waterloo brings to the minds of the thousands
who either visit or read about that historic spot, the downfall of one of the
strongest, powers Europe ever faced, sa will, this monument mark the down
fall of a power which threatened to dominate all the nations of the modern
world,
~ Today a wooden cross marks the historic spot where the Germans were
turned back by that gallant army when Paris itself was threatened. That
'er6ss marks the high-water mark of the German invasion when the grey
green hordes poured in upon those gallant men who were fighting for the
■qery nation's existence. The humiliation of 1876 seemed about to be re
peated again, but as the last vistage oMiope loomed on the horizon, the grey-
Igreen ranks turned in retreat.
Probably no monument in the hißtory of the world will have quite the.
international significance which will be connected with the proposed memorial.
The associations and idealism which made the winning of the war possible,
will make this a symbol of light and truth for millions of people scattered
over the earth. Every American should be proud to have a part in this and
though as yet no definite plan of campaign has been presented at Stanford,
should the opportunity come, we will gladly respond to the call.
