# BOUTS MONDAY TO DECIDE WRESTLERS WHO WILL MEET U.C.
## 
### 
Stanford matmen will clash Monday
afternoon in Encina gymnasium at 4:00
o'clock, in the- elimination tournament
to determine places on the team sched
uled to wrestle against California on
March 17. According to Coach Mc-
Cullough, fortune seems to favor Stan
ford in all save the 175-lb. class, and,
in lesser degree, the 158-lb. class. Bunds,
the best heavyweight produced this sea
son, fractured his rib in practice yester
day, and his probable absence leaves a
big gap. Additional material must turn
out if Stanford expects to win in these
two classes.
By recent ruling of the athletic coun
cil, wrestling has been made a first-class
minor sport. The tournament with Cal
ifornia is as important as the California
game in any of the other minor sports.
The date set for the meet looms near,
and, in spite of several appeals made
public by the coach, a lack of candi
dates stiil threatens some of the classes.
As another incentive to the wrestling
fans, a tournament will be scheduled
next quarter with either the Oregon or
Washington University, in the north.
The men who have been chosen to
compete in Monday's bouts are as fol
lows:
Varsity—125-lb. class: Egami and
Mead; 135 pounds, Brazil. May, and
McBride; 145 pounds, Erickson and
