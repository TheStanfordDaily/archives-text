# THIRST FOR LEARNING IS COOK'S DOWNFALL
## 
### 
As a result of his thirst for knowl
edge the cook at the Delta Gamma
house on the Row is nursing a badly
cut throat and other body bruises.
Deeply engrossed in his study of meta
physical progress and other erudite
matters, he walked down University
Avenue yesterday, entirely unaware
of imminent danger. But, much after
the fashion of a Chaplin comedy,
friend cook disappeared in the depths
of a yawning man-hole. Hence the
bruises.
