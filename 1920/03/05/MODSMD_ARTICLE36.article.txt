# SEAT SALE LARGE FOR COMING CONCERT BY MME. GALLI-CURCI
## 
### 
' Special interest is being centered in
the concert of Mine. Galli-Curci, to be
given under the auspices of Prank W.
Healey at Stanford, on May 3, as this
will be her tirst concert in the north.
Due to a lire in the Los Angeles the
atre, where she was -to have sung,
her dates have been changed and she
will not appear in San Francisco un
til a later date.
Because of this fact, many San
Franciscans are very anxious to pro
cure tickets to the Stanford concert
The second big reason that mans
want tickets to this recital is that
Mme. Galli-Curci has promised to com
ply to requests and sing the same pro
gram which she gave at her first con
cert appearance in New York a little
over three and a half years ago.
Mme. Galli-Curci is now singing in
New York with the Chicago Opera
Company. Miss Lazzari, who appeared
here a few months ago is also a mem
ber of this company and recently sang
in the opera of "Damorah," in which
Mme. Galli-Curci held the lead.
Frank W. Healy has decided to
limit, the ticket sale for the next few
days to the people of the peninsula
only by plans to give the San Fran
cisco people a chance later. Persors
wishing tickets are warned that they
had better obtain them immediately
at either Crandall's in Palo Alto or
at Stanford Bookstore.
