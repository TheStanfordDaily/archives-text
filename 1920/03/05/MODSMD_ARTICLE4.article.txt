# Shortage of P.O. Boxes May Be Relieved Soon
## 
### 
The inconvenience at the post-office,
caused by an insufficient number of
boxes, may be relieved soon. An
order was sent east at the beginning
ot the quarter for three new sections
which will be sufficient. The boxes
may arrive at any time now and will
be installed immediately along the
north end of the building.
