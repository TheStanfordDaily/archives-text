# Bright, Shiny Speed Limit Signs Mark End of Auto Restrictions by University
## 
### 
When the Comptroller had the en
ameled speed limit signs installed
about the University grounds this
week, the automobile was graduated
by Stanford from its "horseless car
riage stage." The process of the rec
ognition of the automobile at Stan
ford has been a long one and has ex
tended over all the time that passed
since Selden took out his patent.
The red triangle warning to campus
speeders marks the last and most
liberal restriction to be imposed on
the automobile. For years after the
automobile was in common use, It
was not permitted on the Stanford
grounds. Later, although allowed on
certain parts of the campus, motorists
were not allowed to use Palm Drive.
Large rolling bumps, spaced about
twenty feet apart, were installed in
the road to dampen the ardor of
speeders.
About seven or eight years ago these
bumps were removed and the auto
mobilist was permitted to use Palm
Drive under a speed limit, applied and
enforced by the University.
The new state law has put the en
forcement of speed limits on roads in
educational institutions under state
control. The new signs are a result
of that regulation and the automobile
has at last come into its own at Stan
ford.
