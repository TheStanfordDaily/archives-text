# Freshman Track Men To Meet Oakland Technical
## 
### 
The freshman track squad will meet
the Oakland "Tech" team tomorrow af
ternoon on the local oval in the first
contest of the year. This meet will give
Coach Acker a chance to pick his men
and to get a definite line on freshman
material. From all indications the first
year men will have a strong aggregation
in the field this year and should have
no trouble disposing of the visiting
athletes.
