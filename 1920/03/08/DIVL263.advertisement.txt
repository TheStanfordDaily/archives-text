" Hoover
• \ »
Makes
Good!"
In a recent test of the HOOVER VACUUM CLEANER
it demonstrated its ability to efficiently remove all
dirt in a carpet, but also, to draw through the carpet
any dirt that was placed BENEATH it.
Considering this remarkable cleaning demonstra
tion, and also remembering that the HOOVER is
ECONOMICAL in operation, don't you think you
should own one?
