A FOOL AND HIS
MONEY SOON PART!
The wise men conserve for a
rainy day.
Eyesight spent lavishly and fool
ishly depletes your treasury of
vision. Are YOUR eyes spend
ing more of your vigor than they
should?
If so you need GLASSES, and
should give the matter proper
attention.
CHINN-BERETTA glasses are
the kind you want —they fit the
features as well as the eyes.
This is important—looks go a
long way these days.
