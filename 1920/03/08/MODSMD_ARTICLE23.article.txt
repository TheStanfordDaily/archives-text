# FOUNDERS' DAY AND STUDENT OBLIGATIONS
## 
### 
the University pauses once again in reverence to the memory
* of the Stanford family. In the hurry and rush of the college year, the
student has little time to think of the far-reaching vision of the University
founders, although every student of Stanford senses, at least instinctively,
the thought and ideal which lay behind the actual establishment of the
University.
Senator and Mrs. Stanford dreamed of an institution which would serve
the children of California. The pressing and increased demands of today and
the coming morrow, have broadened the Stanford ideal. Each day opens out
broader vistas of work to be accomplished by Stanford men and women. The
University has broadened its policies, as well as its curriculum, in accordance
with' the new forces; traditions have been disregarded, original intentions
cast aside for the general good of those men and women who were to enter
Stanford's portals.
It is often difficult for students in the University to realize that they have
an obligation to serve the University rather than the University just serving
them. Students seldom have the vision which will insure the best interests
of the University and therefore the obligation of the alumni is even grfeElter
to keep in close contact with Stanford after their undergraduate days are
over. Founders' Day should bring to the minds of the students of the Uni
versity a fuller realization of the obligations which must some day be ful
filled in return for the advantages which the Stanford family made possible.
