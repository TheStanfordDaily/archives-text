Harvard University
Takes Over Dormitories
Acting in accord with President
Lowell's policy of intensifying the in
fluence of the college upon the stu
dents by housing as many as possible
in college dormitories rather than in
private houses, Harvard University
has taken over three halls from their
private owners. Next year these
buildings will be administered by the
University authorities as regular col
lege dormitories.
