## 
### 
"Sin Sin" will be reviewed by the
local censorship at the cast rehearsal
tonight. A member of the fatuity
Committee on Public Exercises .will be
on hand to approve or disapprove of
the Ram's Head production, which has
been billed as a comedy of wickedness.
Ram's Head Society members are
confident thet "Sin Sin's" morals will
bear up under the scrutiny of the cen
sor. On the other hand many who
have seen the show in rehearsals
maintain that some faculty expurga
tion tonight will be necessary to save
the campus audience from some sud
den shocks when the comedy is pub
licly produced on Friday night.
"Naughtiness" is the vogue in re
cent comedy and the co-authors of
"Sin Sin." S. E. Briggs, '19, and M. L.
Levy, 19, are more than living up to
the "Parlor. Bedroom, and Bath" tra
dition that is now sweeping the Amer
ican stage. This is probably the most
telling argument that the Rani's Head
management will present to the cen
sor tonight.
Ticket drawings for "Sin Sin" will
be held at 1 p.m., tomorrow at Wil
son's campus store and at Crandall's
in Palo Alto.
