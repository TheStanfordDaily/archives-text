# FRESHMEN NINE WINS MOUNTAIN VIEW GAME
## 
### 
The freshman baseball team won a
loose, one-sided game from Mountain
\ iew High last Saturday, the score at
the end of six innings being 21-1.
An attempt is being made to secure
games with semi-pro teams because of
the lack of competition for the babes
from the high schools in this section.
Wednesday, the freshmen play Palo
Alto High School, and Saturday they
will meet a nine from San Jose.
The batteries for last Saturday's
game were: Stanford—Schwartz and G.
Green; Mountain View—Hawkins and
Regli.
