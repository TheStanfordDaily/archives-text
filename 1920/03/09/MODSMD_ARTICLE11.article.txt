# Dr. Jordan to Speak On Treaty Question
## Chancellor Jordan Lectures Oh America's Obligation Tomorrow Night 
### 
Dr. David Starr Jordan, chancellor
emeritus, will lecture at the Little Thea
ter Wednesday night on the subject,
"America's Obligation to the World.''
The lecture is being given under the
auspices of the Y. M. C. A. and Y. W.
C. A.
Dr. Jordan will discuss both sides of
the question of the ratification of the
treaty. At the present time one party
in the senate believes that America
should discharge her duties to the world
as quickly as possible in order that
the proper consideration will be paid to
our -more pressing obligations. The
other group believes that America's ob
ligation to the world is to help maintain
peacc and good will among foreign
countries, and in order to carry out this
policy immediate ratification of the
treaty is necessary. It is also probable
that the speaker will discuss President
Wilson's present policy and his attitude
at the beginning and end of the program,
and was much enjoyed.
Ray Ground, president of the club, di
rected the program. The only difficulties
were in the enforced competition with
the Ram's Head rehearsal upstairs, and
a dog whose appreciation was expressed
in a somewhat disturbing manner.
