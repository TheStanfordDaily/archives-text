# Sarcastic Chaparral Scores Hit on Campus
## 
### 
When Chaparral readers received
their Sarcastic Number on the Quad this
morning they forgot all about the dreary
weather. "Chappie" put out a fine pub
lication this month and he deserves
praise. The cover and the opening poem
are especially clever. The editorials and
the bright and subtle humor of the jokes
are very much to Chappie's credit. And
we seriously doubt if Punch or Life
could have depicted some of the prac
tical situations about the campus better
than Chappie did.
