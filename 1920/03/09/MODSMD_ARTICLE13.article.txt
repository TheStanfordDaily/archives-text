# STANFORD HONORS FOUNDERS' DAY IN MORNING ASSEMBLY
## Congressman Kent Speaks on Economic Problems of The Present Day 
### 
Founder's Day was observed on the
campus this morning by an asembly of
students which was addressed by ex-
Congressman William Kent. "Econom
ics under Democracy" was the topic with
which he dealt. The entire student body
attended the lecture in the Assembly
Hall at 1 1 o'clock.
The problem of economics which is
confronting the world at the present is
a more equitable distribution of the
products of the world among the factors
of production, capital and labor. Mr.
Kent showed that the old system of
laisses-fairc which allowed cutthroat
competition and the absolute power of
the capitalistic class had proved a fail
ure.
He said that the plans proposed by the
bureaucratic socialists or the syndicalists
was intolerable under a democratic
state. Before a more equitable plan of
distribution can be accomplished we
must see that there are enough com
modities produced to distribute equally.
The capitalistic, socialistic, and syndical
istic theories leave the human element
out of their systems, which makes them
impossible. No man has the right to a
part of the goods of the world unless
he helps to produce them.
Cooperative methods and government
control or ownership have helped in
some cases to secure a better distribu
tion. The solution of the problem with
out the acceptance of any radical theory
is to be found in careful thinking by all
concerned with the rights of the ither
party in everybody's mind.
Mr. Kent was accompanied by his wife
and they were entertained at luncheon
by Dr. and Mrs. Rav Lyman Wilbur.
