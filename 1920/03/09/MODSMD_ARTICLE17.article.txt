men of the right caliber to complete
their education and receive special train
ing at Government expense. These men
will be trained to become commissioned
officers iii the Coast Guard Academy at
New London, Conn., in a course which
will last three years. Those who are
interested have been asked to write to

rely on our judgment this one time,
the Board shauld he done away with,
and athletics should return to faculty
control."
