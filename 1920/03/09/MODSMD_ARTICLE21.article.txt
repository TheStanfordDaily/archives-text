# PROBLEMS FOR '23

### 
OROUD of the opportunity to attempt to make journalistic'impressions at
such an early period in our life at Stanford, the freshmen members of
the Daily staff today issue the annual green-sheet. It is our hope that we
can adequately represent the grand and glorious class of 1923, from whom
much is to be expected, and, much will be fulfilled. Four years from now
when the sacred sombrero is our prize and we are in the position to dominate
undergraduate feeling and sentiments, there must be no stain from any
actions of the class. We have surmounted the hills, and the mountains are
before us, but we enter into the four years before us unafraid and prepared to
wrestle relentlessly with the problems that we are certain to confront. It
is for us to profit by the records, good and bad, of preceding classes for the
lessons to be learned exist in rich abundance. Our early association with
college men, personifying the typical Stanford spirit that has already become
dear to us, has broadened our vision and given birth to a finer sense of
responsibility within, not only to this class spirit raised from the war which
we must sacredly hold in respect, but above all to the University and to the
things for which it stands.
