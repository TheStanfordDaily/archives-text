# THE 						BEST WAY OUT

IT is with some apprehension that the editor finds himself confronted with
" the necessity, apparently, of saying something on last night's decisive
action of the Board of Athletic Control. It is felt that such an important
subject should be handled, editorially at least, by those who from greater ex
perience on the "farm," could treat it more intelligently. However, a peaceful
settlement of the differences between the faculty and aluiiini members of the
board on the one hand and by the students on the other is particularly grate
ful. Those of us who entered the institution last fall and learned what the
never-say-die spirit of a Stanford team is, by seeing it so forcibly presented
on the football field, cannot help feeling that the wisest course for the stu
dent members of the Board was to compromise with the opposition for the
sake of the future of the University's athletics. A split at this time might
have resulted in a grave situation. It has been averted. The matter should be
forgotten as an issue bravely fought for but lost for the best interests of the
University.
The student body should be grateful to their representatives on the
Board in their strong fight to present student opinion and in the end for
their decision to abide by the rule of the majority of the Board, despite the
fact that they held their original view of the matter, in order to present a
united front in athletic matters.
