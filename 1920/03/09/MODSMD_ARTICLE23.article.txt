# A 						BONFIRE WITHOUT A GUARD
## 
### 
MOST all freshmen realize that some sort of first-year discipline is a neces
sary evil. A "key-down" period is a good thing, a fair warning that prep
school records don't count at all unless they can be duplicated here. Loyal
members of the 1923 class were glad to build the bonfire for the football
rally. Most of them, on the other hand, objected to guarding it. Disregard
ing the obviously true argument that it is a place where valuable friendships
are often formed, the guarding of the fire is a moral breach of faith with
the University of California. , A recognized agreement exists between the
two institutions against the invasion of rival campuses. Tf we do not believe
that those across the bay are sincere in their relations, there is no particular
good that may come from any such agreement. On the other hand, a group
looking for troble generally has little difficulty in finding it. It is suggested
that when the class of 1923 reaches the second step in the college ladder
entitling the ownership of the coveted red hat and control over underclass
relations, that there be no bon-fire guard. It is worth a trial at least.
