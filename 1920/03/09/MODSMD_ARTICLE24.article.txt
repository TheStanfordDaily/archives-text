## 
### 
Delta Upsilon won the championship
of League One of the intramural bask
etball leagues, yesterday afternoon,
when they downed the strong quintet
of Kappa Sigma by a decisive score
of 15 to 6. The game has been looked
forward to from the beginning of the
series on account of the fact that both
teams had a number of near-varsity
men on them. The D. U. five, with
the addition of Ralph Carver at center,
proved too much for the Kappa Sigma
men, and the latter were never able
to overcome the lead that D. U. took
011 the start. However, the team of
the Kappa Sigma men kept their in
terest in the game at all times and
the final score was only made by a
considerable effort on the part of the
Delta Upsilon five. This win puts
the D. U. team in a very good posi
tion to annex the intramural title.

as loffows. Delta Upsilon:—Forwards,
Lacy and Roy Carver; center, Ralph
Carver; guards, Sanger and Hob Ro
gers. Reiuholtz substituted for Roy
