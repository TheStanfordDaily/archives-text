# EUPHRONIA DEBATERS TO USE JOFFRE PLAN
## 
### 
To relieve the monotony of weekly
announced debates, Euphronia Debating
Society has reserved the topic for dis
cussion until the meeting tomorrow
night in Room 12, Law Building. The
debate will be modeled after the Joffre,
the question not to be stated until a few
before the discussion. This system will
permit more extemporaneous speaking
on the matter in hand and will probably
result in renewed interest in the so
ciety meetings.
