# 'PALLY' BASEBALL TEAM DOOMED TO DEFEAT BY 1923
## 
### 
The frosh baseball team will meet
Palo Alto High on the frosh diamond
tomorrow afternoon at 4 o'clotk for the
second time this season. The last game
with "Paly" was a decided victory for
the Babes, and was \von by a score of
10 to I). Captain Gif?n and Swartz will
start as the freshman battery, and if
nothing unforseen turns up they will
give the high-school fellows a better
run than last time.
Green would like to see a few of the
class of '23 out on the side lines rooting
tomorrow. Last game the cheers from
footers were limited to about One voice,
and with nine more he feels that the
team could "kid" themselves into believ
ing they had good support.
The material this year is good. With
a few more practice games the Babes
will shape up into regular "go getters."
