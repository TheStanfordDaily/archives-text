# CENSOR APPROVES RAM'S HEAD SHOW AT CAST REHEARSAL
## 
### 
The whole-hearted approval of the
faculty censor was granted the Ram's
Head musical extravaganza, "Sin Sin,"
at a cast rehearsal held last night.
In fact, the noble work of reform pro
mulgated by Little Violet and Wie
land Gulp is likely to be of such moral
uplift to the campus, that the play
was praised as an admirable influence.
Ft was announced this afternoon that
'"Sin Sin" would be presented just as
it was written by S. E. Briggs, '19,
and M. L. Levy, '19.
It is noteworthy that several of the
most important, roles are to be car
ried by freshmen. Ned Prather, '23,
as "Lily" has already captivated the
entire cast with his maidenly charms
and will easily be one of the features
of the production. A number of
minor parts and positions in the male
and female choruses are also held by
members of the class of '23.
Jack Kegley, ex-'18, has sent word
from Berkeley that interest in Ram's
Head show is keen on the University
of California campus. He says that
there will undoubtedly be a large
delegation from there to witness the
production. Word of the "naughty"
element of "Sin Sin" has spread and
Friday night's audience will be pre
pared to receive the promised shocks,
which were not expurgated by the
faculty censor.
Ticket drawing began at 1 today
at Wilson's campus store and at Cran
dall's in Palo Alto and will continue
until all seats are sold, which, from
present indications will be soon. The
admission prices will be $1.10 and
85 cents.
The show will he followed by a
jolly-up in the Women's Clubhouse,
which is attracting almost an equal
amount of interest. The music will
be furnished by the Ham's Head or
chestra and the admission price will
be 75 rents for queeners and 50 cents
for roughs.
