# CENSOR APPROVES RAM'S HEAD SHOW AT CAST REHEARSAL
## 
### 
The whole-hearted approval of the
faculty censor was granted the Ram's
Head musical extravaganza, "Sin Sin,"
at a cast rehearsal held last night.
In fact, the noble work of reform pro
mulgated by Little Violet and Wie
land Gulp is likely to be of such moral
uplift to the campus, that the play
was praised as an admirable influence.
Ft was announced this afternoon that
'"Sin Sin" would be presented just as
it was written by S. E. Briggs, '19,
and M. L. Levy, '19.
It is noteworthy that several of the
most important, roles are to be car
ried by freshmen. Ned Prather, '23,
as "Lily" has already captivated the
entire cast with his maidenly charms
and will easily be one of the features
of the production. A number of
minor parts and positions in the male
and female choruses are also held by
members of the class of '23.
Jack Kegley, ex-'18, has sent word
from Berkeley that interest in Ram's
Head show is keen on the University
