# Kilpatrick-Fisher Fail to Convince Seattle Bolshevists
## 
### 
That "speaking to the Seattle labor
union Bolshevists who. packed the front
section of Meanv Hall at the debate be
tween Stanford and Washington Uni
versities. was like trying to urge the
re nomination of President Wilson to a
crowd of Republican senators," accord
ing to a letter from W. M. Kirkpatrick,
'23, received by a member of the Daily
Palo Alto staff last night.
Kilpatrick and Fisher, in upholding
the negative of the question for debate
in the tri-state contest, found public
sentiment entirely opposed to their side
of the question at Seattle, but they do
not ascribe the judges' decision to any
biased or preconceived ideas with regard
to the question or the crowd present.
The contest was at any event very close,
and Washington showed the local men a
good time after the debate was over.
Kilpatrick writes that Washington has
a wonderful school spirit; and that over
a thousand attended the debate. Less
than a hundred attended the local con
test.
