### 
The establishment of an annual ath
letic award to be given to the student
who does the most for Stanford ath
letics each year, was announced today
by W. I. Ames, '19, President of the
Quadrangle Club, through whom the
medal is to be donated. The award
will be called the "Aupperle Memorial
Medal," in accordance with the desire
of the donor. Albert John Hettin
ger, '16.
Hettinger has placed the entire de
cision in regard to the award into the
hands of the Quadrangle Club, of
which both he and Aupperle were
active members when at the Universi
ty. The only provisions he names in
the letter sent from Harvard Uni
versity, are that the award be given
in memory of Harold Vincent Aupper
le, '17, and to the man who in the
judgment of the Quadrangle Club
committee does the most each 3 r ear
for Stanford athletics.
The spirit typical of the giving of
the medal is expressed in Hettinger's
letter which in part says:
"All of us who knew *Aup' remem
ber what Stanford meant to him, and
what he did for Stanford. . . . Person
ally I'll always treasure the memory
of the year (his junior, my senior)
