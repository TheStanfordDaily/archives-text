# NOVELTY PROLOG TO BE FEATURED IN "SIN SIN" SHOW
## "Three Star Hennesey" Will Sin For Ram's Head Customers 
### 
One of the many surprises that will be
sprung on the "Sin Sin" audience Fri
day night will be a novelty prologue.
Details of tiie curtain-raising scene have
been cloaked in mystery by the Ram's
Head coach, but one of the facts that has
not been withheld is that it will be semi
allegorical in its nature and will present
some local "bad men" in their native,
sinful haunts.
And speaking of sin, which, after all,
is the guiding force in the production,
the title of the most sinful character in
the plot belongs to Three-Star Hen
nessy. Th<; part of this paragon of
wickedness is played by Charles Arnn,
'19, a comedian who would make almost
any audience yelp with joy.
Hennessey earns the gonfalon of evil
through his versatile proclivities as
drunkard, cave-man, and athlete. His
forte in athletics, however, is lawn or
table dice. In this line he is a profes
sional. the autfiors of "Sin Sin" having
endowed liirn with peculiar faculties as
a tutor of the educated ivories.
All the songs of the Ram's Head show
have been orchestrated and will be
played by a ten-piece orchestra. This
orchestra will be led by J. T. Reynolds,
'18, who is allowing his hair to grow to
the proper length for the occasion.
Snappy, original songs will be a feature
of the performance.
Ram's Head shows in the past have
always been the laugh hits of the season,
and according to advance indications,
"Sin Sin" will be no falling off in the

Ram's Head tradition. Plot, cast,
chorus, songs, and costuming, all com
bine to make "Sin Sin" a riot of fun.
The seat sale will be continued at Wil
son's campus store and at Crandall's in
Palo Alto. The ticket drawings yester
day were more than usually well attend
ed ; but, according to the Ram's Head
management, there are many choice
tickets still available.
