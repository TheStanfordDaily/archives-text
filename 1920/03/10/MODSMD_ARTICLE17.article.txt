# FICTION TO FEATURE MARCH "CARDINAL"
## 
### 
An unusual high standard of fiction is
upheld in the March Cardinal, which
will appear on the Quad early next
week. James A. Quinby, '18, one of the
veteran fiction writers of the campus,
has contributed a story. "The Third
God," tile complete action of which is
limited to a period of ten seconds. "An
dante Appasionate," by Dorothy Hos
kins.i '19, is a story of the difference
between the recording of life and the
actual living. Those who remember
Miss Hoskins' story in the December
Cardinal will find this story written in
much the same vein.
A new contributor to campus journal
ism, Harry Wyckoff, '20, has contribu
ted "Left-Overs," a story which gives
promise of unusual talent.
