# THE 						FUTURE OF STANFORD ATHLETICS
## 
### 
RBlÂ£ EVANS CONSTROVERBY although brought to a peaceful settlement,
called to the attention of a number of the students of the University sev
eral interesting facts. For the first time, the student body was forced to
recognize the vitally important role which the alumni members of the Board
play in shaping the athletic policy of the University. In Mr. Cutler's state
ment that if the student body cannot accept the decision of the Board, then
the Board should be dissolved and athletics returned to faculty control, the
key-note is struck as to the position of the alumni in Stanford athletics.
Prom the past history of University sports, it is at least reasonable to assume
that many of the faculty are against varsity athletics and intercollegiate con
tests. It was largely through the efforts of a few. including the alumni mem
bers, that the American game came back to Stanford and it has become
evident that Stanford will probably lose her Big Game as soon as the alumni
steps out of the Board of Athletic Cofitrol.
The Evans decision has been made and we believe the Board acted with
the best interests of the University at heart. A new coach will be selected in
the near future. Through the efforts of Coach Evans and the men who
worked under him Stanford has now a name which as long as Stanford spirit
lives and the University has a capable coach, will continue in Pacific Coast
athletics. Mr. Evans' departure will still be viewed with regret by many 011
the campus, but a new era is opening and the student body must stand ready
to back the man who will take Coach Evans' place. The alumni have been
largely responsible for varsity athletics today and we must show them that
Varsity .athletics at Stanford will not be the cause of disruption but will be
the means whereby the faculty, alumni, and students will be bound closer
together than ever before.
