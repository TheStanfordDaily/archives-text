# Boxing Team to Meet California Tomorrow
## 
### 
Stanford's boxing team clashes with
the Bruin team at 8 o'clock tomorrow
evening at Encina gym. The meet gives
promise of being a hard-fought one as
both teams have some well known and
experienced boxers. California consid
ers Cline, an old football star, their
stellar boxer and the bout between he
and Stewart (S) will probably be a close
one.
Coach Murphy has been able to secure
Willie Ritchie to referee the bouts.
Ritchie is well known in boxing circles
and formerly held the world's light
weight boxing championship.
Convalescents at the government hos
pital will be guests of the University at
the intercollegiate meet.
