# STATISTICIAN DOES SOME FAST FIGURE WORK ON BAWL-OUT
## 
### 
Some energetic person in the Bureau
of Statistics has taken the pains to
find out how many John Browns and
Jim Smiths there are in the United
States and how many of their wives
are named Mary or Anna. Spurred on
by this example another person, not
a member of the above mentioned
bureau, lias investigated the Bawl-Out
to find out how many of each species
there are in Stanford University.
Twenty-five groups of the most
prevalent names were chosen. Out
of these groups twelve were in groups
of nine or seven. There were seven
groups of seven each and five groups
of nine each. Not being a follower of
the ouija board the statistician was
unable to state the psychic meaning of
these mystic groupings. Two groups
of thirteen each were discovered.
The total number in these group
ings of seven or over were two hun
dred and fifty-seven or approximately
one tenth of the student population.
Smiths head the list with twenty-two
and Browns are a close second with
twenty. The compiler says that this
shows that the University is still as
democratic as ever.
Seventy-nine persons have the ir
revocable right to the appelation of
"Mac," according to the records. One
other person who is not recorded in
the Bawl-Out should be included in
the list according to the statistics
hound. He to have heard a
man call the ruler of the Stanford
Inn "Mac." He thinks that it stands
for Mikado.
