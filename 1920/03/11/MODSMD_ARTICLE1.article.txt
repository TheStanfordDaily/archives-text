# REHEARSAL INDICATES RAM'S HEAD SHOW WILL BE HIT
## "Sin Sin" Chorus and Songs Put Snap Into Trial Performance 
### 
It was a well-trained, smoothly work
ing cast and chorus that the Ram's Head
coach directed in the "Sin Sin" dress
rehearsal last night. The brilliant dia
logue ran off evenly through the two
acts of the extravaganza and the excel
lence of r the chorus work gave promise
of success when the show is finally pro
duced tomorrow evening:
In selecting a cost for "Sin Sin."
Rain's Head Society uncovered a galaxy
of new stars in the local theatrical firma
ment. Tlie "straight" leading role, as
well as many of the most important
comedy parts are taken by newcomers to
the Stanford stage.
Francis Bennett, '20, in the part of
Davenport Oystermoor is one of these,
who will undoubtedly earn footlight
honors tomorrow evening. Bennett's
interpretation of the "he-vampire" role
to which lie has been assigned, is one
that is, distinctly his own. He has de
veloped a peculiar comic that is
sure to furnish tomorrow audi
ence with many of the big laughs of the
evening. It is Bennett who will sing
the feature song of the shew, "That's
What I Pay Tuition For"and "Why
Don't the Pretty Girls Come to College.
Another man Rapi's Head cus
tomers are advised to watch tomorrow'
evening is j. P. Schnier, '20, who, as
Wieland Gulp, is the comedy lead of the
shg>v, After all, this entirely
unnecessary, Schnier's work is bound to
compel that attention anyway. He 'is
a clever comedian who lias graduated
from the stage of development
and who prefers the subtler forms of
the art of clowning. He and M. D.
("Fat") Flowers, '17, are the premier
fun-makers of the show.
So long as advance tribute is being
handed out lavishly, the female chorus
must come in for its share of the pre
liminary laurels on the strength of its
showing in the dress rehearsal. The
apothesis of the make-up man's art has
been achieved in transforming these un
derclassmen into bewitching "chorus
ladies."
The seat sale so far has been a record
one for Ram's Headshpws. It is being
continued at Wilson's campus store and
at Crandall's in Palo Alto.
