# DR. JORDAN SHOWS AMERICA'S NEED OF RELIGIOUS REVIVAL
## 
### 
That a religious revival is the only
solution of the social problem that conr
fronts the world today was the principle
upon which Dr. David Starr Jordan
based his lecture on. "America's Obliga :
tion to the World," in the Little Thea
ter last night. "What is needed is a re
vival of intelligence and of emo
tionalism." the chancellpr-emeritus said.
"Wisdom is knowing what one ought to
do next; doing it is virtue; and'religion
is the reason why. Religion is the ele
ment that stands bafk of it all."
Dr. Jordan seemed to indicate that re
ligion in reality was knowing the right
and doing it. He went on to show that
the rise of Bolshevism in Russia. aw}
qf kindred beliefs, andidoctrines in
countries, vyas due largely to political
and religious suppression in th& past;
The sudden change from passive obedi
ence under tyranny to abnorrpal aptiy
ity under a less powerful,government in
those countries involved in the recent
war, and who are now without a govern
ment, has the religious and, poli
tical aspect of, the world as a
Freedom of the.pf.ess and of speech, and
all the rights that go to make up a
democracy, t3r. Jordan continued, ac
counts for the solidity of the United
States, who entered the war whole, and
emerged from the conflict without hav
ing suffered the evil of an overturned
social regime.
"It was this freedom in every insti
tution that made for the best religious
spirit, and consequently insured the per
manence of our social state," proceeded
the chancellor-emeritus. "The demons
of greed, militarism, and vindictiveness
that upset the social machinery of gov
ernment all over the world could not
exist in a land of free institutions, such
as ours. With our individual responsi
bility, together with a spirit of coopera
tion and conciliatbn, we have as a funda
mental principle the very essence of
democracy. Our government and our
institutions are borrowed in part from
Europe, and it is our duty to repay that
country with cooperation. When we en
tered the war, we entered European poli
tics and religion, and now that we are
once in, the only way out is forward!
It is our duty as American citizens, and
as exponents of American democracy to
see the thing through. There is no
back way out.
"I favor the League of Nations," con
tinued Dr. Jordan, "but I do not believe
that Article X is all that it should be.
It is much too vague. 1 would favor
the pact with any number of reserva
tions, so long as they did not impair the
fundamental principles upon which the
document is based."
