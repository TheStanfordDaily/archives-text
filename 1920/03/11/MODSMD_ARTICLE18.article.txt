# SOPHIE BRASLAU WILL GIVE CONCERT TONIGHT
## Noted Singer to Appear at Stanford Assembly Hall 
### 
Miss Sophie BraÂ§lau : comes to Stap
fort}, under the auspjcsjs of., the
Peninsula Musical Association, after
winning the approval of large audiences
in New York, Chicago, and San Fran
cisco.
After hearing hc;r sing in San Fran
cisco last Sunday, Mason of
the Examiher wrote, "Miss Sophie Bras
lau is an American and we ought to
he proud of her." Criticizing the song
"Eiii, Fiji," which she will sing tonight,
he said, "When the artist moved to the
depths of this song, the words wore
clothed with a mantle of tone richlv
somber. There is a wailing passiop in
her voice like one finds, in the Lamenta
tions of Jeremiah. The race sang it,
as if it was poignant;"
Though Miss Braslau's rise to fame
has been very rapidj the reason she could
acquire so much in such a short time,
is that she was endowed by nature with
singularly rare gifts. She is unusually
equipped with every attribute that goes
to make up a great artist.
