# CHAMBERLAIN SPEAKS ON NATIONS' LEAGUE
## Senate Apposition is Purely Political, Asserts Speaker 
### 
"We are at war, and there is no war;!
we are at peace, and there is.no peace,"
is the way in which Thomas G. Cham
berlain Stated the present condition of
this country in his address on "The
League of Nations." He spoke under
the auspices of the Democratic Club at
the Women's Club House at 7:15 lagt
evening. The meeting was presided
over by Chancellor Jordan.
Throughout five thousand years of
history there has been no greater ques
tion confronting the nations of the
world than that of organizing for a
permanent peace. Mr. Chamberlain said
that there was one point that was the
crux of tile whole debate now in prog
ress in, the Senate. This point is the
delay that the acceptance of the covenant
of the League of Nations will force
upon nations who wish to war upon each
other. He cited incidents from history
showing that when intervention was
brought between nations contemplating
conflict and that the conflict was averted.
Twq. other important features of the
covenant are the reduction of armament
and the protection of the rights of small
nations. In this way "we are writing
into international relations the great
American principles of life, liberty, and
the pursuit of happiness," said Mr.
Chamberlain.
Those Senators who are opposing the
League, Mr. Chamberlain believes, are
not opposing the league, but are oppos
ing President Wilson for purely political
reasons. Senator Lodge has accepted
any form of reservation in order to hold
the opposition together. The Republican
majority has used the covenant as the
football of politics.
In conclusion he showed that the
American people are in favor of the
league, and that the American ex-sol
diers are.
