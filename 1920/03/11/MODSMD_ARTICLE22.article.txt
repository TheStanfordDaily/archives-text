# CONCERNING THE DAILY PALO ALTO STAFF
## 
### 
fIIHE first announcement of the Daily Palo Alto Staff is made in this edition.
* As announced before, R. E. Wedekind, '19. has been appointed as Man
aging Editor. E. E. Crowe, '22, is now the ranking news editon
Crowe has worked faithfully on the Daily Palo Alto since his freshman
year and his work at all times has showed ability along journalistic lines.
R. E. Kenny, '21, and W. F. Leiser, '21, will continue their work as news
editors. Both of these men are veterans of the staff and have done much
toward setting the standard of the Daily Palo Alto. F. S. Reeder, '22, ap
pointed as news editor at the first of the quarter, has shown himself to be
Well fitted to handle the work oh the desk. We take pleasure in announcing
the appointment of Florence Hocking as the fifth news editor on the Daily
Palo Alto. Miss Hocking has shown particular ability in organizing her
work and we believe that she will uphold the standards of news editors in
the past.
R. A. Martinsen, '21, has been promoted to the position of rank on the
reportori'al staff. Mai'tinsen has worked steadily and well deserves mention
for his ability as a journalist. The other members of the staff include Miss
Elaine'Adrian, '22, Miss Mary'-Jane Clark, '22, R. C. Fisher, '22, Miss Olive
Brooking, '22, Miss Adelheid Saier, '22, E. C. West, '23, and W. M. Kilpatrick,
'.23, and are to be complimented upon the faithfullness with which they have
worked and the effort which t"hey have made to meet the increased demand
for copy which came with letting the paper solid.
Eight new members have been taken on the staff, three sophomores and
five freshmen. W. C. Evans, '22, H. J. Borba, '22, and W. J. Jameson, '22,
have been added to the sophomore staff as having showed ability in news
paper work. T. G. Irwin, '23, M. C. Kirby, '23, C. R. Minard, '23, L. H.
Tritle, '23, and K. N. Stewart, '23, have been added to the freshman class.
The selection of new freshmen members was particularly difficult on ac
count of the high standard of material which turned out. Other names would
undobtedly have been added if the size of the staff had permitted.
A new plan will be inaugurated in the announcement of the staff. After
this the staff will be announced on Friday of each week. The names of the
staff will be rated according to the work which they have done during- the
week depending largely on the amount of copy which is turned in, the ability
to cover assignments definitely given out and to dig up stories unassigned.
There are two advantages in this system: First, it will stimulate com
petition among members of the staff. Any man who does not keep up his
work will first be dropped to the bottom of his class and then if no improve
ment comes must necessarily be dropped from the staff entirely. In the
second place, this system will conserve space allowing considerable more
space for news. With co-operation and conscientious work, the Daily Palo
Alto staff will turn out a paper of which Stanford may well be proud.

17ICENTE BLASCO IBANEZ, a recent visitor of the Stanford campus, is
" quoted by the New York Times as saying, "PJvery man is a coward be
fore a woman, and his status today is identical with that of the Southern
negro before the advent of Abraham Lincoln." The Times continues, "But
the American woman, he believes, is surfeited with all the respect and adula
tion bestowed on her, and is simply langishing for a little rough treat
and 'cave man stuff.' "
It is too bad that Professor Espinosa failed to show his distinguished
guest the Stanford "roughs." They would have been an eye-opener to Mr.
Ibanez. The eminent author might have thought there was still hope for the
American male.

the past.
R. A. Martinsen, '21, has been promoted to the position of rank on the
reportori'al staff. Mai'tinsen has worked steadily and well deserves mention
for his ability as a journalist. The other members of the staff include Miss
Elaine'Adrian, '22, Miss Mary'-Jane Clark, '22, R. C. Fisher, '22, Miss Olive
Brooking, '22, Miss Adelheid Saier, '22, E. C. West, '23, and W. M. Kilpatrick,
'.23, and are to be complimented upon the faithfullness with which they have
worked and the effort which t"hey have made to meet the increased demand
for copy which came with letting the paper solid.
Eight new members have been taken on the staff, three sophomores and
five freshmen. W. C. Evans, '22, H. J. Borba, '22, and W. J. Jameson, '22,
have been added to the sophomore staff as having showed ability in news
paper work. T. G. Irwin, '23, M. C. Kirby, '23, C. R. Minard, '23, L. H.
Tritle, '23, and K. N. Stewart, '23, have been added to the freshman class.
The selection of new freshmen members was particularly difficult on ac
count of the high standard of material which turned out. Other names would
undobtedly have been added if the size of the staff had permitted.
A new plan will be inaugurated in the announcement of the staff. After
this the staff will be announced on Friday of each week. The names of the
staff will be rated according to the work which they have done during- the
week depending largely on the amount of copy which is turned in, the ability
to cover assignments definitely given out and to dig up stories unassigned.
There are two advantages in this system: First, it will stimulate com
petition among members of the staff. Any man who does not keep up his
work will first be dropped to the bottom of his class and then if no improve
ment comes must necessarily be dropped from the staff entirely. In the
second place, this system will conserve space allowing considerable more
space for news. With co-operation and conscientious work, the Daily Palo
Alto staff will turn out a paper of which Stanford may well be proud.

17ICENTE BLASCO IBANEZ, a recent visitor of the Stanford campus, is
" quoted by the New York Times as saying, "PJvery man is a coward be
fore a woman, and his status today is identical with that of the Southern
negro before the advent of Abraham Lincoln." The Times continues, "But
the American woman, he believes, is surfeited with all the respect and adula
tion bestowed on her, and is simply langishing for a little rough treat
and 'cave man stuff.' "
It is too bad that Professor Espinosa failed to show his distinguished
guest the Stanford "roughs." They would have been an eye-opener to Mr.
Ibanez. The eminent author might have thought there was still hope for the
American male.
