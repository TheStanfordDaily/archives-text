# D.K.E. WINS TITLE IN THIRD LEAGUE
## Games Tomorrow Will Finish Intramural Elimination Basket Matches 
### 
The Delta Alpha Epsilon quintet de
feated the Phi Delta in a one-sided
game Tuesday, annexing the intra
mural title in League Three. They
are now ready to meet other league
leaders in the semi-finals. Theta Xi
and Beta Theta l'i both took their
game on forfeit and are tied for sec
ond place in League Two. If Beta
triumphs in their game with Encina
(west) second, tomorrow, there will
be a three-cornered tie for the lead
ership in Leagu One. At present the
Encina team has a perfect score but
they have met no good resistance in
the last few weeks and so no forecast
can be made on the outcome of the
game. League Two is the last to
finish its schedule.
There are no deciding games today,
but tomorrow Theta Xi meets Delta
Chi, and the Beta five clashes with
the Encina champs. A loss for either
Theta Xi or Beta tomorrow, throws
away the chance to meet once more
for the title of League Two.
Acker expects to start the finals
in the intra-mural leagues on next
Monday. The contestants will be:
Delta ITpsilon from League One; Delta
Kappa Epsilon, League Three; Chi
Psi, League Four, and El Camino in
League Five. The outcome of League
Two iÂ« still in doubt.
