# Indignant Student Wants to Know Who Got "Justice" Nickels
## 
### 
The following communication was re
ceived at the Daily Palo Alto office to
day :
"In view of the interest aroused by
the student body in the late Evans epi
sode, I wish to submit the following
for consideration in your paper:
"a question for the campus sleuths;
OK, WHO GOT THE JITNEYS?"
"Although the Evans situation lias
been definitely settled, there still re
mains the question in the minds of many
of whether Mr. Evans or Mr. Justice,
in whose behalf the late nickel-grabbing
campaign was conducted with such
bountiful success, secured the booty.
Diligent search of the Bawlout fails to
reveal the name of Justice, so that we
are still in doubt as to the identity of
the gentleman with the itching palm.
From past experience we would judge
that the board of trustees, that money
grabbing gang, was in some way con
nected with this new, original, brilliant,
effective, and efficient means of bleed
ing the meek, humble, and industrious
student. With such a precedent we may
expect to see the same stunt pulled again,
,and with still greater success, for in spite
of their recent experience, the number
of suckers has not decreased.
"Charles Smith."
