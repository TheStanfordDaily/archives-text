# PRACTICAL CHEMICAL LECTURES PLANNED
## 
### 
As a result of the large attendance
and enthusiasm of the students shown
at Dr. Cox's lecture last week on
"Chemistry in the Philippines," it has
been decided that this lecture i> to be
the first of a series which will be
given primarily for the students in the
Chemistry Department. With the co
operation of Professor Swain, who is
anxious to promote this movement, it
is hoped to secure eminent authorities
on Chemistry to deliver addresses on
the average of at least once a month.
The subjects of these lectures, while
they will prove of especial interest to
chemistry students, will be planned
to be of interest to majors in other
departments as well.
The main purpose of this series of
lectures is to bring the students in
contact with actual outside practice of
the "dry theories" of this science and
show the practical value and use of
chemistry.
