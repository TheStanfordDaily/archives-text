# SHORT TALKS WILL FEATURE VOCATIONAL CONFERENCE, MAY 22
## 
### 
More interest is being shown this year
in the annual Vocational Conference
than in the past. The nature of such a
conference seems to be somewhat ob
scure in the minds of a great many of
the women students and these are the
people that the committee in charge is
planning to reach. Speakers arc brought
here, and these men or women give half
hour talks all during the day, and after
their talks are available for special in
dividual conferences. Those who arc
brought here are people who are emi
nently suited by their study, or successes
in life to discuss the topic assigned to
them.
Most in demand at the present time
seems to be information upon journal
ism, social-service work, secretarial
training and various kinds of teaching
occupations. These talks are in a line
with what the Dean of Women, Miss
Harriet Bradford is trying to do in the
short conferences that she holds with all
women during their freshman and soph
omore years.
Annual vocational conferences are
held by other colleges every year and
have been tremendous successes. Wheth
er they will be continued here and en
larged in scope depends largely upon
the interest which is shown by the
women in this next conference, the ten
tative date for .which has been set as
May 22.
