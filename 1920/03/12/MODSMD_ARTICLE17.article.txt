Arrangements are now being made by
the local Y. M. C. A. and Y. W. C. A.
for the organization of three religious
discussion classes which will begin meet
ing next quarter. The classes will be
held in the Memorial Church on Sun
day mornings, at 10 o'clock, and will be
conducted by members of the faculty.

the outgrowth o-f the class in religious
discussion which was started jointly at
the beginning of the present quarter by
the Y. M. C. A. and Y. W. C. A. Pro
fessor O. M. Johnson, of the Depart
ment of Romanic Languages, has been
instructor of the course but will not be
at the University during the spring quar
ter The course of study in the different
classes next quarter will lie largely de
termined by the members of the class
and by the instructor. The question of
deciding whether the classes are to be
mixed or are to be organized separately
for both the men and the women will
be decided by a vote which will be taken
among those who signify their intention
of joining one of the classes. Full in
formation regarding enrollment in any
one of the classes may be obtained at
either the Y. M. C. A. or Y. W. C. A.
office.
