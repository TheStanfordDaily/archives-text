# BABES ENTERED IN FOUR CORNERED MEET
## Freshmen and High School Track Teams to Contest Here Saturday 
### 
The freshmen track team will test
speed with the San Jose, Mountain View
rind Palo Alto High School squads to
morrow afternoon in a four-cornered
meet on the Stanford oval.
Coach Ackcr has a strong aggregation
in the field and the frosh should win an
easy victory. The first-year men who
are counted on for sure points are:
Roberts, in the 100 and 220-yard dashes;
Williamson, in the 440 and 880-yard
runs; Elliott, in the mile; Howell, in
the high and broad jumps and shot-put;
and Rice, in the two hurdle events and
the discus. Owing to a misunderstand
ing among some of the freshmen, eight
who ran last Saturday while on pro.
had their period of probation etxended
another quarter. Sanger and Keller,
two promising weight men, were lost by
this action.
Immediately after the freshman meet
which starts at two o'clock the varsity
athletes will stage an informal meet in
which some Olympic runners may enter.
The meet to have been held with the
Olympic Club was called off on account
of the sickness of several of their men.
However, in Saturday's competition,
Coach Harry Maloney will be given a
chance to get a line on his material to
run in the Redlands rind Pomona meet,
March 20.
