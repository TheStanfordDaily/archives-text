# SOPHIE BRASLAU IN CONCERT PLEASES ALL
## Attractive Artist's Mellow Voice Fascinates at Assembly Musical 
### Adelheid Saier, '22 
Miss Sophie Braslau, who gave a con
cert last night in the Assembly Hall, was
very attractive and had a beautiful smile,
but when she sang with all dignity of a
true artist and displayed her mellow
deep voice she was indeed fascinating.
Her effervescent joy was .first shown
in the interpretation that she gave to her
second number, "Brindisi." by Donizetti.
1 here was no affectation in her voice,
and the song seemed to come with the
same spirit that prompts a child to shout
for his own pleasure. The same emo
tional enthusiasm was felt when she
sang, "Villanella," and *'La Girometta."
and "Tell Me Not of a Lovely Lass." r
Her ability to sing the heavier, dra
matic songs in contrast to the equally as
well interpreted lively, exbilarant ones
or the sweet, low and melodious songs,
was shown when she could master. so
splendidly the three songs, "Eili, Eili,"
"Le Carnival," and Cecil Forsyth's
"Rest."
Saint-Saens' "Mon coeur s'ouvre a ta
voix" because of its familiar theme and
her ability to grasp the spirit, proved
that she was worthy of her position as
a metropolitan star.
The only complaints that could be of
fered are that she was not very generous
with her encores and her program' was
too short.
