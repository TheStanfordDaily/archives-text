# ARE WE TOO EASILY SATISFIED?

### 
rE question was once asked why aren't there more brilliant men and wo
men in this world? and the answer came that most men and women
are too'easily satisfied. This charge has often been made against the col
leges of the country and in many instances the charge is justified.
Such remarks as these are common enough and we have all heard them,
"Well did you hit the Ex.?"
"Oh, guefes I'll get by."
In planning a course we frequently hear something like this:
"It isn't the course I want, it's the honor points. What a pipe!"
These incidents are typical of university life and Stanford is no excep
tion. The ideas are thoughtlessly expressed yet there is a more serious
aspect in (he attitude which lies behind. The great mass of people in this
world are too easily satisfied. Ruts are comfortable and don't take much
effort. Men are rare who have exceptional ability. Geniuses are not normal.
It is rather the man who makes the most of brains that were given him, who
gets along in this world.
College men and women arc expected to be the leaders in the new re
construction period which the world is facing today. Leaders are men of ex
ceptional attainments. If the college man and woman is too easily satisfied,
if they are willing to accept a mediocre standard and make no effort to raise
theWfelVes aboVe that standard then those men and women are unworthy
of the advantages extended to them and will fail when the call comes. The
standard rests on individual responsibility. For those men and women to
whom Stanford ideals and Standford traditions are an inspiration, the medi
ocre 'Will never satisfy. They will work ever to carry the name of Stanford
into fields where the best is none too good, where the big problems of the
world are wrestled with and solved.
