V3OR those of us who are more or leas vitally interested in sixty dollars a
* Quarter tuition fee a very interesting suggestion appears in a recent num
ber of the New Republic. According to the theories of a business efficiency
expert, a large percentage of students come to universities to be "in college"
and not to seek a higher education. Therefore he reasoned, students would
be willing to pay to stay in college. The result is that no students are ex
pelled from college, no students are asked to leave the university. Instead
they are asked to pay a fine for low scholarship. "Flunking out" is unknown
except for the fellow who can't scrape up the sheckels to stay in college.
Most parents, it has been found, are willing to pay the fine to their
children In college and save them from the disgrace of being asked
a university.
According to the article, this system aided materially in the financial
difficulties of the university. Instead of letting the College of the Pacific
reap the benefits from ex-Stanford students, the business office would be

richer. Academically, the system proved a success because there was an
> added incentive toward higher scholarship. A very high standard was set
so that the wealth reaped during tie period the student fell into step with
the new regime, did much to solve the financial difficulties faoing the institu
tion.
The suggestion is interesting because it throws a new light on the college,
education and looks a fact in the face. It is perfectly true that large number
of students come to the University just to be "in college" and are willing
to pay for the privilege. A certain amount of benefit must necessarily come
with that desire even though the educational motive is not dominate. But
even more significant than this is the fact that there seems to be a general
tendency to get away from the tuition idea if possible. A student values his
education more if he pays for it but that is no reason why an education
should be put at too high a premium.
