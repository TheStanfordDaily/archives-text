# Quad Management Offers Reward For Stolen "Razz" Cup
## 
### 
A ten dollar reward was offered by
the Quad management this morning
for the return of the silver cup which
was stolen from Wilson's window last
Sunday.
The "Josh" editor of the yearbook
first believed that some practical joker
had removed the trophy in an attempt
to "razz" 011 the Quad's "razz" sec
tion. But as 110 light has as yet been
thrown on the theft the reward was
offered this morning.
The cup taken was one of the two
to be awarded by the yearbook to the
winners of the contest for campus
"razzes." The student furnishing the
best sidelight on any campus individu
al or event suitable for the "josh sec
tion" was to receive one of the cups,
while the other was to go to the or
ganization contributing the best comic
material.
Much of the material already is in
the hands of the josh editor in direct
"razzes" toward a limited group of
fraternity and sorority houses. A
more general distribution of criticism
is desired.
April 10 is the date set for the close
of the contest.
The name of the "josh" editor will
for ever be kept a secret, the editor
of the yearbook stated today.
