# HONOR SYSTEM TO BE INTRODUCED AT EASTERN COLLEGE
## 
### 
[ Radical changes in the traditional
honor system at Columbia University,
to take effect next September, have
been announced by Dean Herbert E.
Hawkes of the University. The method
of awarding honors is expected to
draw closer together students having
the most market scholarly interests
and abilities.
This is characterized as the latest
of three imporant departures from
academic tradition taken by the
faculty of Columbia during the post
war period, the others being the adop
tion of the psychological tests as an
alternative method of admission, and
the five-hour required freshman course
in contemporary civilization.
The main purposes of the honor
system, according to a statement by
Dean Hawkes in explaining the pro
posed innovation, are, first, to recog
nize scholarly accomplishment and,
second to stimulate it. The first pur
pose is considered of value in deal
ing with those stuuents who are pre
paring for professional schools, such
as the pre-medical students and the
pre-engineering students. These stu
dents have the "professional urge" and
need to stimulus to do their best work.
For them the honor system offers re
cognition of their scholastic achieve
ment.
"The undergraduates, however, who
are taking their college work in the
traditional fashion and not preparing
for professional training don't need a
stimulus." Dean Hawkes said. "All
students who declare themselves as
candidates for honors will be given
a list of books upon which in the judg
ment of the faculty, our civilization
depends. Included will be works of
philosophy, history, science, and econ
omics. Under .he direction of men
whose study of these books has been
most thorough the students will be
required to read, discuss and study
them. The honor men will present
their ideas and impressions in weekly
meetings and these discussions will not
be allowed to take the form of lec
tures at which the leader gives his
opinions.
"Another phase of the work will be
the selection by each candidate of
some particular field of study in which
he desires to do special work. This
work is limited only to the resources
of the university and the ability and
diligence of the student himself. An
instructor, who is sympathetic with
the students and who is in the depart
ment under which the student plans
to do his special work, will help him
and direct his special studies. It is
hoped by the faculty that some stu
dents will choose work which will
cross departmental lines. A student
making a study of the Balkans, for
example, would be required, is he de
sired to make his study thorough, to
learn something of the language,
economics, and history of the Balkans.
To do this he would take courses
under various university departments."
The faculty of Columbia University
has adopted the report of the Special
Committee on Honor Work which
says that the honor program has the
following chief aims: To draw into
closer intellectual companionship the
college students of most marked
scholarly interests and abilities, to
minimize the merely pedagogical di
vision of knowledge, to promote and
reward the mastery of subjects rather
than the taking of courses and to
cultivate the desire for and to develop
the habit of independent reading and
reflection.
The committee recommended that a
group of members of the teaching staff
be appointed to serve as Honor Direc
tors, each of whom will guide and
superintend the honor work of the
candidates whom he accepts, and who
will together constitute a committee,
Mider the ex-officio chairmanship of
the Dean, responsible to the faculty
through the Dean, for all that con
cerns the honor program and the stu
dents. These Honor Directors shall
be granted such relief from their other
duties as will enable them to do full
justice to their honor students.

vision of knowledge, to promote and
reward the mastery of subjects rather
than the taking of courses and to
cultivate the desire for and to develop
the habit of independent reading and
reflection.
The committee recommended that a
group of members of the teaching staff
be appointed to serve as Honor Direc
tors, each of whom will guide and
superintend the honor work of the
candidates whom he accepts, and who
will together constitute a committee,
Mider the ex-officio chairmanship of
the Dean, responsible to the faculty
through the Dean, for all that con
cerns the honor program and the stu
dents. These Honor Directors shall
be granted such relief from their other
duties as will enable them to do full
justice to their honor students.
[ Radical changes in the traditional
honor system at Columbia University,
to take effect next September, have
been announced by Dean Herbert E.
Hawkes of the University. The method
of awarding honors is expected to
draw closer together students having
the most market scholarly interests
and abilities.
This is characterized as the latest
of three imporant departures from
academic tradition taken by the
faculty of Columbia during the post
war period, the others being the adop
tion of the psychological tests as an
alternative method of admission, and
the five-hour required freshman course
in contemporary civilization.
The main purposes of the honor
system, according to a statement by
Dean Hawkes in explaining the pro
posed innovation, are, first, to recog
nize scholarly accomplishment and,
second to stimulate it. The first pur
pose is considered of value in deal
ing with those stuuents who are pre
paring for professional schools, such
as the pre-medical students and the
pre-engineering students. These stu
dents have the "professional urge" and
need to stimulus to do their best work.
For them the honor system offers re
cognition of their scholastic achieve
ment.
"The undergraduates, however, who
are taking their college work in the
traditional fashion and not preparing
for professional training don't need a
stimulus." Dean Hawkes said. "All
students who declare themselves as
candidates for honors will be given
a list of books upon which in the judg
ment of the faculty, our civilization
depends. Included will be works of
philosophy, history, science, and econ
omics. Under .he direction of men
whose study of these books has been
most thorough the students will be
required to read, discuss and study
them. The honor men will present
their ideas and impressions in weekly
meetings and these discussions will not
be allowed to take the form of lec
tures at which the leader gives his
opinions.
"Another phase of the work will be
the selection by each candidate of
some particular field of study in which
he desires to do special work. This
work is limited only to the resources
of the university and the ability and
diligence of the student himself. An
instructor, who is sympathetic with
the students and who is in the depart
ment under which the student plans
to do his special work, will help him
and direct his special studies. It is
hoped by the faculty that some stu
dents will choose work which will
cross departmental lines. A student
making a study of the Balkans, for
example, would be required, is he de
sired to make his study thorough, to
learn something of the language,
economics, and history of the Balkans.
To do this he would take courses
under various university departments."
The faculty of Columbia University
has adopted the report of the Special
Committee on Honor Work which
says that the honor program has the
following chief aims: To draw into
closer intellectual companionship the
college students of most marked
scholarly interests and abilities, to
minimize the merely pedagogical di
vision of knowledge, to promote and
reward the mastery of subjects rather
than the taking of courses and to
cultivate the desire for and to develop
the habit of independent reading and
reflection.
