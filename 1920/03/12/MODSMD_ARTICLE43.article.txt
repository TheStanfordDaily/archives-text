### 
WALLA WALLA, March 12.â€”In
vestigations regarding the amount of
time and money that a student spends
on affairs and work outside of the
college curriculum has starter at Whit
man College by committees of the
Associated Students and faculty, for
the purpose of working out some plan
to meet the rising cost of college life
and to remove the obstacles in the
path to higher education.
Originating independently with the
executive committee of the Associ
ated Students and with a committee
from the faculty, was the desire to
investigate, and make a thorough can
vass of the time, energy, and money
which the students expend on outside
activities.
It has been felt by many students
that college life has been unusually
strenuous this year and that if pos
sible some means should be taken to
readjust school and outside activities
so that the students would be able to
get more out of college work and
still maintain themselves financially
and socially in thfe community life.
With this in view it is desired that
each student, without revealing his
Identity, make a complete tabulation
of his financial receipts and ex
penditures and especially of the
amount of time spent on school ac
tivities and community affairs when
provided with the necessary blanks.
From the answers to such questions
as, "How much time and money does
a student spend on outside activi
ties?" "Where does he get the money
and how does he spend it?" and
"How much does he earn and how
much time does he spend in earning
it?", the committee hope to work out
sraie plan to meet the rising cost
of college life and to remove the
obstacles in the path to higher edu
cation.
The matter will be brought before
the students in the near future by
means of a questionnaire which in
cludes a budget to show receipts and
expenditures for the year 1919-20 and
a list of student activities.
In the large coast schools, such as
the University of Oregon and Wash
ington a. Point System is used where
by various activities are rated ac
cording to the time and energy called
for.
