## University Aims to Raise the Salaries of Members of the Faculty 
### 
Stanford University credited with
the largest percentage of members of
the 1909 faculty still in service at the
University of any of the universities
throughout the country in a survey
made by Washington State College.
The percentages range from 20 r / ( for
Washington State College, which is
the lowest, to 71% for this University.
The average percentage of faculty
still til sorvice in the same institu
tion is 47%.
Tlhw? figures were compiled at
Washington State College, and pub
lished in the "Evergreen," the stu
dent paper. They include data from
ten representative colleges and uni
versities in all sections of the nation.
Figures given out by President Wil
bur today show that during the period
1914 to 1919 the aggregate number of
faculty members has increased only
by six, although (here have been
numerous changes from time to time.
The salaries during this time, how
ever. have increased by $176,000 per
year.
"These figures are significant," said
Dr. Wilbur, "in that they show a ten
dency on the part of Stanford Uni
versity toward progress on the teach
ing staff. It is our aim, not to in
crease the number of the faculty, but
to employ only the best instructors
possible. This University is already
recognized as the leading privately en
dowed university of the West."
