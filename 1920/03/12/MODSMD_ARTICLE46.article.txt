# CHEMISTRY STUDENTS DISCOVER NEW WAY OF MAKING SUGAR
## 
### 
The chemistry students at Ohio State
University have discovered a new proc
cess for making sugar from sugar beets,
according to the February number of
the Journal of Industrial and Economic
Chemistry. The process for making the
sugar syrup from beets is said to he ex
ceptionally simple and adaptable to
kitchen use where enough sugar can he
obtained from the family garden plot to
supply all average household needs. Dr.
James R. Withrow declares that an acre
planted in sugar beets would yield from
one to two tons of sugar.
The development of the process came
after an interesting experimental cam
paign had been waged in sugar-beet
growing, by J. W. Hotson, of the Uni
versity of Washington. Dr. Hotson's
research was carried on during the war
where numerous experiments gave proof
that sugar beets grown in the botanical
gardens of the campus produce from
twelve to twenty per cent sugar. A
syrup taken from the sugar beets by
classes in organic chemistry at first
showed a peculiarity in taste, a failing
which was afterwards remedied by cut
ting away green matter at the crown
of the beet.
