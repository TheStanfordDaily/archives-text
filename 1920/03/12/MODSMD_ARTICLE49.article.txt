# BRYN MAWR OPENS CAMPAIGN TO RAISE FUND OF $2,000,000
## "College Influence Weakened By Tuition System"â€” Miss Helen Taft 
### 
Miss Helen Taft recently opened a
campaign for $2,000,000 for the . en
dowment fund for Bryn Mawr. Miss
Taft is a close friend of Miss Harriet
Bradford and her views on tuition are
interesting in this connection. Miss
Taft is now the acting-president of
Bryn Mawr College and the problem
of finances faced her as it did Stan
ford. Miss Taft. however, was quoted
by the New York Times as saying
that she did not favor the system of
tuition.
She gave as her reasons the fact
that private educational institutions
started the higher educational work
of the country and on account of this
had won a prestige with the American
public which was too valuable to lose.
Miss Taft believes that the tuition
system weakens the influence of the
private college as many good students
turn toward the State institutions for
a cheaper education.
Miss Taft; the daughter of ex-presi
dent Taft, has won considerable dis
tinction on account of her work at
Bryn Mawr. She has written several
interesting articles on college and
educational problems for current peri
odicals. Many of the alumnae of
Bryn Mawr were surprised at the
large amount which Miss Taft put as
the minimum of her drive but Miss
Taft in reply declared that the amount
was hardly enough. She allowed a
large proportion of the money for a
building fund and the rest for teach
ers' salaries.
