# CHANGE IN FOOTBALL RULES IS PROPOSED
## 
### 
ITHICA. N. Y.. Mar. 12.—West V»r
ginia University football authorities to
day sent a recommendation to the foot
ball rules committee that the same pro
tection be provided for the thrower of
a forward pass as is already provided
for the kicker. "Roughing the kicker"
draws a penalty under the present rules
of fifteen yards, and the same is asked to
be provided for "roughing the passer."
