### 
SEATTLE, March 12.â€”A co-opera
tive store for university organizations
is being discussed in detail by the
University of Washington Interfrater
nity Council.
A community storehouse, managed
by a board commissioned by the
A. S. U. W. has been suggested. Here
student organizations would be able
to purchase supplies at wholesale
prices.
The movement originated with the
organizations themselves, members be
lieving that in view of the large
volume of supplies needed each year,
some method of reducing the cost
would be desirable.
It is said that fraternities will first
try out the plan, with sororities and
house clubs joining as soon as practi
cable. The Universities of Wisconsin,
California, Michigan and O. A. C. are
successfully using such a system.
