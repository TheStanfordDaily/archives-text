Temporary officers were elected and
plans for a campaign formed at a meet
ing of the Hoover Club held here re
cently.
A number of the faculty members are
interested in the movement, and among
those present at the meeting were Dean
Olin Templin of the college, Prof. Dins
more Alter of the department of astron
omy, and Professor Brandt of the Eng
lish department.
One of the student leaders says: "We
believe that Hoover has shown the
greatest executive ability of any man in
the United States both in a financial and
in an economic way and although he has
not declared himself a candidate for the
presidency, we believe him to be the
logical man for the place."
