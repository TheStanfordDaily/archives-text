# FIRST DEGREES TO WOMEN GRANTED BY U. OF LONDON
## 
### 
The University of London was the
first academic body in the United
Kingdom to grant degrees to women —
this occurring in 1878. Oddly enough,
Oxford and Cambridge do not yet ad
mit women to regular membership in
the university or grant degrees to
them. Women,are allowed to study
there under certain restrictions, but
they receive only certificates. They
are not expected to enter into con
versation with men undergraduates at
tending the same lectures. they may
not accept invitations to dances, and
they may attend public entertain
ments and athletic events only under
conditions approved by their principal.
The men students take very little
notice of them.
