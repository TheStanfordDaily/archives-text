# OPERA COMMITTEE CALLS FOR PLOTS
## 
### 
Plots and dialogue in competition for
the Junior Opera will be received by
K. S. Pershing, '21, of the opera com
mittee at any time before Thursday of
next week. According to the chairman
prospective authors need not complete
all the lines before presentation to the
committee: The finished plot together
with one scene will be sufficient basis for
comparative judgment.
The committee expects to appoint a
coach and select an opera before the end
of the quarter.
