# YALE UNIVERSITY STARTS CAMPAIGN FOR "BOWL" FUND
## 
### 
In view of the fact that a recent
editorial in the Cardinal proposed that
the money for the Memorial Fund be
used for the erection of a Bowl, the
following extraxts from the Harvard
"Crimson" may be of interest to Stan
ford people."
Yale has started a campaign for
the raising of $?>OO,OOO to complete
the Howl. The original plans
contemplated a complete cement
structure instead of the present
combination of sand and wood,
which serves-as a foundation for
about half of the seats.
Every graduate or undergradu
ate who Subscribes at least $100
will be given in return the right
to seats in the best sections for
football games for the next 15
years, whether the games are at
New Haven or elsewhere.
