PRIVILEGE
of taking cr.ro of the optical re
quirements of quite a number

dents of Stanford University.

br —we want more of you to
come to us —it will be to our
mutual advantage. When you
think—"GLASSES" — we want

upon your mind —that's why this
ad appears here twice a week —
wo hope it is getting over.
