Mixing baseball skill and wit, Cliff
Ireland's Independents won a second
game from the Stanford nine, Satur
day, by a score of 9 to 3. Six hits
off of Newlands and an error on
Stevenson, in the ninth inning, cost
the varsity a possible victory.
Bundy, the first Cardinal man at bat,
popped a grounder to the pitcher, who
threw it over the first baseman's head.
This error allowed Bundav to reach
third. A timely hit by Crowe brought
in tlie first run. Tuebner scored the
second tally for Stanford when he
c rossed the home bag in the third
inning.
The Independents were unable to
hit or score off of Draper's pitching
during the first fiive innings, but in
the sixth they made three safe hits,
and two runs, which tied the score.
Newlands took the box in the seventh.
With the score two-all, at the first
of the ninth, Ireland's men used New
land as the center of a merry-go-round,
seven men crossing the home plate.
The muffling of a long fly to left field
was partly responsible for this dis
astrous inning. In the last of the
ninth Kallam made Stanford's third
run.
