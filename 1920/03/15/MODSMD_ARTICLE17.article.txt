## Six Veterans of Victorious Quintet to Return For Next Year's Team 
###

ford's basketball captain for the 1920

varsity basketers. The consistent
]>laying of Butt as running guard on
the 1918 and 1920 teams lead to his
selection. Elected to serve as Cap
tain for the 1919 team he entered the
military service before the start of the
1919 season. Re-entering Stanford last
fall he played guard on the football
eleven, that upset dope sheets in the
scrap with California. Butt registers

transferred to Stanford from the Uni

next year are bright. Righter, Pe
louze, Hood and Lilly, however, will
not be eligible for the five next year.
Captain Butt. Adams, and Austin will
be back to uphold the defensive end of
the 1921 varsity basketball team.
Davies, Mills, and Richmond are the
varsity basket-tossers that will again
be out for the offensive end of the
court.
Although the All-Star five of the
Pacific Coast has not yet been chosen
by the coaches of the six universities

ford should have at least two mem
bers of the team. Righter is practi
cally assured of a place in the line-up.

Adams, Pelouze, and Mills also have
a chance of being chosen for the team.
Too much credit cannot be given to
the players and coach that gave Stan
ford the Pacific Coast Conference
basketball title. Not only were the
men given instruction on the gym
nasium floor, but Coach Evans con
ducted a special course of lectures in
basketball. This course gave each
man a better understanding of the
relative advantages of the different
systems of play.
