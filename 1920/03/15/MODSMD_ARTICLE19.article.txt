# WOMEN MUST RETAKE MANY QUAD PICTURES
## 
### 
Senior records for the 1921 Quad
should he tilled out and handed in at the
office of the yearbook before the coming
vacation. The Quad editor states that
record blanks may be obtained at his
office, at room 330, Encina, or from
any of the sophomore try-outees.
Owing to duplication of names at the
photographer's in Palo Alto, there is
space reserved in the junior book for
twenty more junior pictures than have
been taken. Juniors who have not al
ready had taken pictures for the year
book may do so this week. Women
who have taken sororitv pictures intend
ing to have them used in the junior sec
tion of tlie book also, will have to re
port again at Davey's if their photo
graph is to appear in the 1021 section of
the book, because pictures taken for so
rority mountings can not be used in both
places.
