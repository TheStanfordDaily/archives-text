## 
### 
Coach Harry Maloney's track squacl
participated in an informal track meet
Saturday afternoon in which Sudden,
Saxby, Farmer and Bowers of the
Olympic Club entered. Wells and Hani
lin worked best for the Varsity, while
each of the Winged "O" men secured
first places and Bowers who took second
in the discus.
The turnout of varsity men was small,
and Maloney stated after the meet that
if the candidates for the track meet
failed to show hereafter for any kind of
competition, they would be dropped from
the squad.
The next Saturday was to have been
with the Olympic Club, but sickness and
lack of practice prevented the club men
from comins* down in force. However,
the competition allowed Coach Maloney
to make a partial choice of the team that
will represent Stanford against the com
bined Redlands-Pomona track team
