# FACTORS IN STANFORD PROBLEMS
## 
### 
IjUNAL EXAMINATIONS are almost upon us again and with the close of the
. current quarter we indulge in looking back in a general survey. Often
by recognizing the mistakes of the past we can do much to correct them in
the future and it is with this hope that the Daily Palo Alto will attempt to
analyze in a general way the relationship of students, faculty, and alumni
of the University.
One of the outstanding features of the entire year has been a general
restlessness among the student body. This was more or less to be expected
as many men were coming back, not because of their own personal inclina
tions, but because they felt that a degree was necessary for the work they
hoped to make a success of later. Consequently, many are simply marking
time until they got out and it is natural that they should be restless. It will
probably be a year or so before Stanford will get away from that spirit of
discontent.
Nevertheless, other factors enter into the situation and we cannot blame
the holdover for all of the discontent, the tenseness with which the air
sometimes seems to be charged. Exactly what these factors are, we will
attempt to analyze in a later editorial, but some recognition is necessary in
the general survey of conditions. Student control, relations with the faculty,
athletic problems, are all important considerations of the problem.
In contrast to the restlessness of the student body, we find a peculiar
inertia on the part of the alumni. There are few active alumni who devote
time, money, and energy to the best interests of Stanford, but on the whole
it can well be said that there is a noticeable lack of alumni enthusiasm. Con
ditions are steadily improving, however, and with the coming work of the
alumni secretary there is little doubt but what the alumni will be much
more active in the future. Stanford is comparatively young and her alumni
are young. They have not had the advantages of a hundred years or so
training of what an alumnus is expected to do, but again this is an import
ant part of the general survey of the existing situation.
There has always been a certain amount of misunderstanding between
the students and faculty which, in a large measure, should be avoided.
Every student in the University has at least one good friend among the
faculty and no doubt if the students and faculty had the opportunity to know
one another more intimately much of the existing antagonism would be
avoided. The faculty and students in many instances have different view
points but there is no doubt of the fact that there is a certain amount of
common ground upon which the faculty and students could come into closer
contact..
Stanford has entered upon a period of reconstruction following the war.
The need for constructive criticism and thought is more necessary than ever
before. We must face the past squarely and ask, wherein have we failed?
The answer to that question will not be pleasant but it will show us our
weaknesses and our strength. It will tell us how to build for the future and
it will give us the opportunity to prove our resources and sincerity of purpose.
The editorials which will appear in these columns for the remainder of the
week will be an attempt, to look squarely in the face, a few of the more
vital problems of the University, which are connected with the student body.
Our suggestions may not be what others would have it but we hope
that many of the students, faculty, and alumni who happen to read our
attempts may at least be spurred on to think seriously on Stanford's prob
lems.
