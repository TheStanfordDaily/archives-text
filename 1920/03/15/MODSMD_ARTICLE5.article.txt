# "Pss-t" Women's War Whoop! "The Worm Turns !!"
## 
### 
A Woman's Razz Sheet 1 At last
the unthinkable, the unbelievable
has come to pass! The masculine
element of the Farm will get a. de
cided jar Wednesday morning at
eight o'clock, when a sheet entitled
"P-s-st—The Worm Turns" floods
the campus, and the "inside dope"
on our most noted characters is re
vealed for the first time. Startling
revelations on parties believed un
known outside of the circle of the
"initiated" will greet the unsuspect
ing rough and the sorority-house
door-mat alike as he hurries to his
eight o'clock in the early morning
mist. No longer can the "Snake"
make his comments on the "fair
sex" with impunity. Chappie's caus
tic barbs of insinuation, and un
bridled sarcasm are to be answered
at last. The "500" have taken up
the callenge which has gone by un
answered and ignored since the
early days.
As for the authors of this start
ling sheet—there are numerous ru
mors—Organized Women, en masse
perhaps—or Theta Sigma Phi.
Well, anyway, it will be here on
Wednesday morning at the price of
10 cents—but it's worth more than
that!
