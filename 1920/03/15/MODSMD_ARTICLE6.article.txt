## 
### 
"American prestige <in Europe had
been greatly diminished" bv the Peace
Conference, was the central thought of
Professor p. 1). Adams' speech late Fri
day afternoon before the Commonwealth
C lub of San Francisco. The speech l>v
the head of the history department of
Stanford contained the conclusions of
his study of European affairs made on
his recent extended tour of Europe.
" The American peace emissaries
went to France confident that thev would
be successful," declared Professor
Adams, "in effecting a peace treaty that
would be satisfactorv to all the powers
and at the same time keep the United
States out of European politics. For
some reason our deleagtes were not able
to carry out their original intentions."
Several factors combined to render
the work of the American representa
tives difficult, according to the Stanford
historian. The secrecy which marked
the sessions of the conference made i»
impossible to secure popular support for
many democratic proposals. The Amer
ican efforts were continually blocked by
the old-school diplomat . who were in
tent upon grabbing land for the coun
tries thev represented. T T nwittingly the
United States was placed in a very un
favorable position when she antagonized
the territorial aspirations of the Euro
pean powers.
"In the end our emissaries came back
to the United States." concluded Profes
sor Adams, "a very disheartened eroup
of men, wondering if their efforts would
be understood by their people."
