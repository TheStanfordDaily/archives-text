their ability to keep up a rapid succes
sion of "sure-fre" lines that gave the
audience no recite from laughing- In

loud applause. Originalitv was the out
standing featui of the show, and al

Ihe whole a iosphere of the show
was one of nous' se, and all of the mem
bers of the cast nd chorus entered into
this spirit whol hcartedly. The result
was a care-fre . good-humored inter
pretation of th piece, which quickly
brought the aud'ence into intimate sym
pathy with the extravaganza.
Frank Bennett '19, as Davenport Oys
tormoor. took off the "lounget-lizard"
type in a way that showed a strong in
terpretative ability in burlesque roles.
His clear, lyrical voice put over the
song bits of the show.

comic effect. M. I). Flowers, '17, as
Little Violet, carried away the honors of
the evening. Flowers had all the stage
presence in the world, over two hun
dred pounds of it, and, with his ridicu
lous make-up. his appearance on the
stage was alone enough to convulse the
audience.

Opposite him, in the character of YVie
land CJulp. played by J. P. Schnier, '20,
win i made a diminutive figure against
Little Violet's bulk. For contrast's sake,
it was ;i fortunate bit of casting when
these two were given the opposite roles
of the two reformers. Schnier's antics
011 the stage furnished one of the fea
tures of the show. It is possible, how
ever, that he could have uncovered a
lot more fun in his character than he
actually did, even though his reading
was far above the average.
T. R. Carksadon, '22, as Mrs. Chap
A. Rone, was by far the ablest of the
female impersonators. His insight into
the typical lowa dowager role to which
he was assigned was perfect. And, al

though their female impersonation roles
were not as difficult as the part that
Sarskadon faced, Ned Prat her, '23. and
Hugh Boyd, *20, were all that could he
asked for. Prather made an adorable
bathing-girl.
The part of the sinner in the show
was taken admirably by Charles Arnn,
'19, at his best moments was unimpeach
able, but at times he failed to sustain
his character entirely. But, after all, to
be consistently wicked during a two-hour
performance is almost beyond ordinary
human endurance, anyway.
In "bkck-face," L. I .Thompson, '19,
earned a good deal of credit by the way
lie sang the character "This Ain't
Heaven" W. G. Hall, '19, had an ex
cellent conception of his part as the
"hen-picked" husband.
The work of the choruses was indis
putably good, although a little more
money spent on costuming the "girls"
would have advanced the illusion of fe
male impersonation almost 100 per cent.
"Why Don't the Pretty Ciirls Come to
College" and "Drop Me Down Among a
Bunch of the Beautiful Girls" scored
as the song hits of the evening, although
they were crowded for this position by
Several other numbers on the musical
score. The ten-piece orchestra, directed
by J. T. Reynolds. 'IX, was the big con
tributing factor towards success in the
musical line.
