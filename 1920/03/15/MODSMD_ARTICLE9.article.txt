To (rive the'• public what it wants is
the first rule i. r popular success in.the
theatrical gam.- Ihe success of Ratn's
I lead Society ii its presentation of "Sin
Sin" last Frid iy night was the result
'of a strict adherence to thi> dramatic
axiom. Ihe society made no attempt at
inspiring an audience or educating one,
but tried simply and avowedly only to
amuse one. Tlie results of this attempt
are well known now. "Sin Sin" took
Fridayaudience bv storm and left it
crying for 11101,'e. Coach L. L. Picker
ing, '20, is largely responsible for the
effective dramatic staging of the show.
lo heap • riditule on the professional
reformer was tl<e motif of the burlesque,
and in this the co-authors, S. E. Rriggs,
19, and M. L Levy. 19, struck home
remarkably welt with their clever satire.
1 he writers earned no end of credit for
their ability to keep up a rapid succes
sion of "sure-fre" lines that gave the
audience no recite from laughing- In
cidental hits at Stanford issues, such the
payment of tu ion, received long and
loud applause. Originalitv was the out
standing featui of the show, and al
though some of s freshness was some
what rubbed o by a little too much
similarity of att k on the same subject,
there was not a ne or idea in the show
that could be ei •(! shop-worn.
Ihe whole a iosphere of the show
was one of nous' se, and all of the mem
bers of the cast nd chorus entered into
this spirit whol hcartedly. The result
was a care-fre . good-humored inter
pretation of th piece, which quickly
brought the aud'ence into intimate sym
pathy with the extravaganza.
