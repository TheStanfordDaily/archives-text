WOW!
Our idea was to encourage a lot of
young literary idealists by printing their
immature but earnest compositions in a
gre£it national magazine.
The cover design is a fair sample of
how unsophisticated are these modern
students.
Unsophisticated—hell! They're un
principled young devils. Absolutely no
restraint. They ought to be suppressed
—not encouraged.
And gosh ! The way they talk about
girl 3.
They kiss a girl with about as much
shy reserve as you would feel picking up
a fat lady's bundle in a street car.
And drink! Why you would think
prohibition had driven all the joy out of
their lives -taken the edge out of college,
as you might say. There, we thougiW
up a joke all ourselves.
Say, but the kids are clever.
There's something about this wit ol
youth that gets you —a freshness —an
irresponsible sparkle —something of the
wild, untrammelled, devilish joyousness
that older men feel when they slip ofi
into the woods for a holiday.
We can't describe it —but nothing just
like this issue of JUDGE was ever
published befoYe. In its waj% it's a
masterpiece.
We've caught on the wing the essence
of that glorious, elusive something that
makes old men long for one more
golden hour on the campus—for the free
true-hearted jollity of the days when
good fellows got together —for the cyni
cism that was happy, the wit that didn't
sting, the oath that didn't curse, the
sin that didn't soil.
And art! There are at least thirty
nine different schools of art born in this
issue.
All the regular JUDGE features of
course Walt Mason —foreign jokes—
the theatre —"Bad Breaks".
Are you reading these "Bad Breaks"?
They are great —a dollar's worth of
laughs in this one department.
Don't miss this wonderful issue of
The Happy Medium "
