# PRES. HOPKINS OF DARTMOUTH COLLEGE ADDRESSES ASSEMBLY
## Problems and Opportunities of Today Are Outlined in Stirring Talk 
### 
"Colleges exist for the purpose of
creating good intellects v/hich nre
bent on seeking truth, and, what is
more, are able to recognize truth,"
said President Ernest IVftrtin Hopkins
of Dartmouth College in his address
on the problems and opportunities of
the present age, at the University
assembly this morning: "Unless the
college tan produce keen and open
tninds, it, is? a useless institution. The
hope of the coming years lies with the
men and women now in college; the
habits of mind which they are develop
ing in these formative years determine
their future intellectual capacity, and
thus, indirectly, the influences which
will predominate in the coming age."
College men and women of today
stand 011 the threshold between two
eras, with a vision brightened and
sharpened by the lessons of the war.
"The war was a lightning flash reveal
ing the true status of the world land
scape more clearly than the ordinary
light of an even and peaceful age
could eyer have done," said President
Hopkins. The problem of today is:
how are we to use this new> vision
that good may come of it? We are
confronted by two great problems of
growth: Can we increase and sustain
economic wealth, in other words, eco
nomic production? And can we in
crease the growth of intellectual ca
pacity, or education in its broadest
sense? For their, solutipn the ,wqr|d
looks to the leadership of qollege peo
ple whose training should fit them for
just such situations.
President Hopkins jpausqd hete to
elucidate 011 the nature of leadership
"True leadership is? now .interpreted
as influence rather tha,n mastery;
leadership ill,,the modern sense strives
tor the ideal of co-operative good
rather than sejfifjh advancement. To
dgjU, leadership is a pres
ent day problem.
The world today is the scene Of a
struggle between the opposing theories
o£ eo-pperatiqn and individualism. The
usefulness qf ..individualism is on the
wane; we are approaching an era in
which co-operation will be thp guiding
ideal. ; Individualism .settled in this
country,\in ths pioneer flays it yvas at
its maximum height find leap to much
exploration. NOw, the civilization of
this country has beejn pushed to the
frontiers. The village zone
has become a worjoi zone; the ends
of the earth are bjoftnd together by
transportatiqp ( afid -coipTpunication.
The world is, inclusi re— bound in by
a zone of common interest. The civili-.
zation of pur democracy is turned in
upon itself, and herein, lies a great
danger. Rome's civilization on turn
ing in upon itself turned to excesses
and decay; we of Amterica
must guard lest y the fabric of
all we cherish in society and govern
ment be destroyed. Through co-opera
tion the principles of democracy can
be kept intact, qrtc| the worj'fl guided
safely through this most critical era.
