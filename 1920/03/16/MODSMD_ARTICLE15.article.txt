# CREW PROSPECTS ARE FAIRLY BRIGHT
## Coach Rogers Builds Eight Around Nucleus of Old Varsity Men 
### 
By HI. C. Wkst, '23
Stanford's Varsity Crew will face a
difficult proposition when, it lines up
against the California Eight April 17,
on the historic Oakland Estuary, the
scene of many Cardinal victories on the
water. Lip until last year. California
had never finished in front of a Stan
ford eight since 1908. but last season
the I Hue and Gold rowers overwhelmed
the Stanford eight. Their crew was the
best the Berkeley institution had turned
out in years. This year practically the
same men are in the LI. C. shell.
Coach Les Rogers started the season
with everything against him. Only four
letter men were back. 1 lie crew situa
tion was serious and had it not been for
the Quad election which gave funds
for tlie maintenance of an eight, crew
would have died a natural death. De
spite this handicap and numerous others,
such as a long trip to the Redwood Es
tuary every day under tlie most adverse
conditions, Rogers has turned out a
formidable appearing eight. A coaching
launch has at last been purchased, per
mitting C oach Rogers a better opportu
nity to look over his men. When the
shells start on the morning of the inter
collegiate regatta, Stanford will have an
excellent chance against Ben Wallis and
his strong California crew.
Around Captain Davis, an ex
perienced crew man, Cary, McGillivray,
and Wilbur, Rogers .has formed his
eight. Second varsity men of last year
and old timers returning from the serv
ice compose the rest of the shell. All
of the crews are on strict training rules
and undergo a long pull on the Estuary
every afternoon. The freshman eight
looks strong, most of the men having
had some experience in rowing and tak
ing to the shells naturally.
When the rival universities await the
crack of the gun April 17, Rogers be
lieves his men will have an equal chance
with the best that California can pro
duce.
