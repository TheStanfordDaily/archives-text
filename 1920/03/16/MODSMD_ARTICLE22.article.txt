Charles Doc. president of the Senior

secretary of the Faculty Club, inviting
all the men of the Senior class io meet
the men of the Faculty at the Faculty
Clubhouse, on Friday. April 9, at 8 p. m.
The evening's entertainment will be very
informal and the faculty hope to see
as many present as possible. President

notified immediately in case there is any
strong reason why the invitation should
not be accepted for that night.
