# WHEREIN HAVE THE FACULTY FAILED?

### 
WHEN a freshman enters college, he comes with an open mind and enthusi
asm for everything from the Freshman-Sophomore Rush to the President
of the University. The sudden loss of enthusiasm for the administration of
the University, however, comes within the first three months of his residence
here, no matter whether he really has anything to base his opinion on or not.
The reason for this is the attitude which the student body in general holds
toward the faculty and the administration. There is a disturbing lark of
sympathy between the two groups which make up the active life of the Uni
versity. The question now comes, what can we do about it?
Student assemblies have proved veery elective in molding student senti
ment. In order to make them successful, howeVer, men and women who can
reach the Btudents by convincing and sane ideas must speak with some ap
preciation of the student viewpoint. Some emphasis should be made on the
fact that the students and the faculty are both working for the same end, the
welfare of the University as a whole. If every man and woman who enters
Stanford could have this idea imbedded within his mind, then the faculty,
administration, and students would have some common ground to work upon.
Student assemblies, compulsory if necessary, would do much toward mold
ing the sentiment needed.
A man with an appealing personality—and there are many who would
qualify among the faculty of the University—whom every student would
come to know and respect; a man whose, confidence was prized and who
would be willing to unselfishly give his time to the students, could exert a
more profound influence than most people realize. In addition to the in
fluence of a single personality, some means should be devised whereby other
members of the faculty could come before the students of the University.
In this way there would be some chance of the student body and the faculty,
most particularly the administration, getting together and pulling together.
Criticism could be made both of the faculty and the students in the past, and
very justifiable comment at that, out it is not what has been done in the
past which is going to count so much as it is what is going to come of the
future.
The unsettled conditions during the war made much of the work along
these lines impossible. President Wilbur spent the larger part of his time in
Washington, D. C. The students of the University do not know their Presi
it. Although he is willing to see students at all times in his office, it is
possible for so large a student body to become acquainted. The deans
„..ve both been very influential but their work is more or less limited. Both
of the offices are comparatively new. The ideal is that eventually these two
offices should be the most influential as far as the students are concerned, in
the entire University.
There are times when a personal note will do more toward creating
friendly feeling than anything else in the world. To forget the official ca
pacity once in a while and just "be friends" would do more to create the
spirit which both faculty and students reverence in Stanford, than any other
one thing.
