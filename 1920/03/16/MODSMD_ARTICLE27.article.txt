Yesterday afternoon saw the two best
battles of the intramural season, when
the Delta Upsilons met Encina West
Second, and the Chi Psi clashed with
the Delta Kappa Epsilons. Both games
were good exhibitions of basketball and
no team ever got a lead of more than
four points on its opponent. The first
match was between the Chi Psi five and
the Delta Kappa Epsilons. The game
looked like anybody's when the final
whistle blew and decided the score in
favor of the Delta Kappa Epsilons,
15 to 14. Both teams made many fouls,
the greater part of Chi Psi's score being
made on free throws. Wilcox at for
ward for the Chi Psi team made one
free throw, Wallace (forward) two
field goals, and Starkey (center) two
field goals and five free throws.. Moul
ton at forward for the Delta Kappa Ep
silon five made the greatest number of
points, fie annexed three field goals
and four free throws. Schlaudeman
made the prettiest shot of the game
when lie dropped the ball through the
basket for two tallies just at the last
of the game. Coonse (center) got one
field goal and one free throw.
Jn the Delta Upsilon-Encina game the
score was even more in doubt during the
second half. Larson, the star center of
the Encina quintet, was hit in the neck
during the scuffle and the tide seemed to
go in the D. U.'s favor from that time
to the end. Many personal fouls char
acterized the play of both sides and
the work of the men who threw the
free baskets counted for a great deal
in the final score. When the whistle
blew for the end of the game the score
stood 19 to 18, in favor of the D. U.
There was a double foul to throw for
in order to complete the game. Encina
had first throw and made the basket,
placing them even with the fraternity
men. Roy Carver, who had been throw
ing the free throws for the D. U. five,
took the ball and the game hung in the
balance while he threw. The shot was
perfect and the l>all sailed over the edge
of the ring, winning the game for the
D. U. men by a .ZQ.to-19 score,
