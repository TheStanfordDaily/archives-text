MAN to man, now, here's the most
companionable bunch of tobacco
that was ever rolled into a cigarette.
Our own buyers in the Orient select
for Chesterfields the finest aromatic
Turkish leaf. Our experts blend with
these costly tobaccos the best full
flavored Domestic—fine Blue Grass Bur
ley and the famous "bright" Virginia.
What's more, these tobaccos are put
together in a way that brings out hidden
flavors—flavors that other and less skill
ful methods have not discovered.
And it's a closely guarded secret, this
blend—the manufacturer's own private
formula. It cannot be copied.
Look up Chesterfields if you've got a
summons out for *'Satisfy."
You'll notice, too, how that moisture
proof package keeps your smokes firm
and fresh, always.
