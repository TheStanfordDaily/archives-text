# CARNIVAL COMMITTEE WILL HEAR PLANS
## Reps. Will Meet Tomorrow Night to Plan For Big Event 
### 
Plans for the student-body carnival,
to be held April 23, will be outlined to
some fifty or sixty representatives of
campus organizations at a meeting to be
held in the Little 1 heater at 7:30 tomor
row night. These representatives have
been appointed to organize the prepara
tions for the carnival in their respec
tive groups. The meeting tomorrow
night has been called by the Carnival
Executive Committee, recently appoint
ed to take charge of this year's carnival.
Chairman E. W. Martin, '18, is urging
all the representatives to be present to
morrow night, for it is important that
the preparations for the carnival be fur
thered as much possible before vaca
tions. All organizations which have not
yet named representatives, are asked to
do so before tomorrow night and to have
those representatives present at the
meeting in the Little Theater.
The representatives are asked if pos
sible to come to the meeting prepared to
state what part the respective organiza
tion they represent will take in the car
nival this year. Two or more organiza
tions will be permitted to join in one
stunt or concession, but it is hoped that
the groups will have such stunt or con
cession assigned to them as soon as
possible.
In order that mistakes may be avoided,
it has been decided to designate the rep
resentatives of the organizations as the
committee of representatives, while the
main carnival committee will be known
as the executive committee.
The executive committee met at the
Kappa Kappa Gamma house last night
and furthered the carnival plans. Chair
man Martin appointed members of this
committee to direct various parts of the
work. C. S. Hobbs, '19, will have charge
of the stunts or performances which will
