# Pss-t! Plus H--sst! Answer is K--sst!

### 
P--sst! H--sst! These are not, as
might easily be supposed, sibilant
sounds emitted by the slithering ser
pent, but the cognomen of two recently
born campus publications. Based upon
the time-honored principle that {all
humans are created equal, which, free
ly translated, means that all humans
have equal access to printers' ink,
our new, youthful organs, were con
c ived in the same harmless spirit
of naviete and innocence that marks
the raison d'etre of "Town Topics", or,
perhaps "Parisienne". They were no
sooner released than they were en
gulfed in the avid maws of the hust
ling, joyous, care-free intriguers,
yclept Sons of the Stanford Red â€”
anxious to read what the daughters
of Stanford said.
H--sst! and P--sst! Otherwise
known as "Male and Female," give
promise of eclipsing the w.k. Jim Jam
Jems in instantaneous and widespread
popularity. Have you a heart to sell?
Does the matrimonial tingle send its
thrills along your spine? It pays to
advertise!
A third publication, it is rumored,
will be sold on the Quad in the near
future. Not to be outdone by its
fellows, it will bear the euphonious
title of K--sst! It's a sequel of the
nuptials of H--sst and P--sst!?
