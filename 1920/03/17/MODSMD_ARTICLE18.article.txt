of the Camera Club.
Silberstein began study as a bobby
ten years ago. He lias made an unusu
ally complete collection of photos show
ing Chinese manners and customs. He
has done this in spite of the difficulty of
obtaining these views, on account of
Chinese objections to photography. The
pictures are hand-tinted to show the Ori
ental color harmonies and make an ef
fective decorative display. Many of the
views were taken in San Francisco's
Chinatown, and there are a number of
poses of \ aleska Suratt in costume.
The exhibition of prints in the rear
gallery will close March 19 instead of
March 22, as previously announced, be
cause of transportation difficulties.

ings by Charles Roland Peters. The
paintings will be transported to the Art
Gallery in motor trucks, and Mr. Peters
will himself supervise their hanging.
