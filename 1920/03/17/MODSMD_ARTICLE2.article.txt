# D.K.E. Intramural Five Beats D.U.
## El Camino Quintet Loses to Encina (West) Second Floor Team 
### 
The Dekes won their second game
last night by defeating the D. U. quin
tet by a 9-to-4 score. The D. U. five
was unable to get its offense to working
and could not make a basket in the sec
ond half. The Dekes were playing a
much tighter brand of basketball than
on Monday, and they did not lose so
many points on fouls. This win of the
Dekes gives them the edge on the inter
league championship as they have a clean
score of 1.000.
Encina (west) second won from the
El Camino Club in a match that was
chiefly a question of which side could
throw the largest percentage of free
throws. Only one field goal was made
and that in the last two minutes of play.
The El Camino team had eleven throws
and only made four of them. The En
cina team was better on the basket work
and largely on that account was able to
make the necessary points to win the
game. The final score was 7 to 6, in
favor of the hall men.
Tomorrow the D. U. five meets El
Camino, and the Encina champs tangle
with the Chi Psi quintet. Botli of the
games ought to be fast as all of the
teams are out to bring up their standing.
Encina will be in good shape as they arc
resting today.
