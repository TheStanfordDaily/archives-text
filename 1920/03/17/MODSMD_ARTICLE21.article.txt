### 
H. G. Blote, '18, M. M. Goldstein, '20,
and W. F. Leiser, 21, were the trio se
lected, at the final elimination try-out
yesterday, with D. L. Goodman, '22, as
alternate, to represent the Cardinal in
the Joffre debate with the University of
California next month.
Three hours prior to the try-out,
Coach McClintock announced the fol
lowing question for the elimination con
test: "Resolved, That the President of
France should be elected by the direct
vote of the people." The affirmative was
advanced by D. L. Goodman, '22, E. F.
Burke, '22, and H. G. Blote, '18. Re
jection of the proposed measure was
urged by M. M. Goldstein, '20, L. B.

The showing made by the contestants
yesterday makes it certain that the Car
dinal representatives will make a strong
bid for the Joffre medal next month.
The trio selected is without doubt the
strongest squad chosen this year. Stan
ford will not be forced to depend upon
any one of the squad to bring the medal
back from Berkeley, as each member
of the team is confidently backed as
likely winner of the big scrap.
Keen competition in the try-out made
the composition of the squad uncertain
until the final rebuttal. The polished
delivery of Blote assured him a place on
the team. Goldstein's clear analysis of
the issues and ready rebuttal was one
of the outstanding features of the con
test. A surprise attack sprung by Leiser
as concluding speaker, with his rebuttal
showing the irrelevance of his oppo
nent's argument to the issues, made his
membership on the squad certain. A
close race was made by Goodman and
Martin for the position of alternate,
Goodman just edging the latter out of
the place. The poor delivery of
placed him at a disadvantage despite his
excellent argument.
