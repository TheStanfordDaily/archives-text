# THE 						FUTURE OF STUDENT RESPONSIBILITY
## 
### 
IT has often been said that in the youth of a nation lies the idealism of a
nation and this is hi a large measure true. The college man and woman
should have hopes and aspirations of which they are not afraid and in which
they have every confidence. The man or woman with a degree has had a
training which brings the realization of things hoped for closer; he has the
inspiring example of men who have gone from the portals of his university
and who have made good in the world; he has had the associations which
always look forward toward building above the average standard; and he has
the faith and the confidence of those who have had a part in those advantages
which have done so much toward making him a leader. Training, culture,
idealism, are all on the side of the college man or woman and it is logical
to conclude that a student body should reflect this background. Their chal
lenge is, do we live up to what the world at large lias a right to expect of us?
The practical application of ideals begins with the small routine of
every-day practicalities. Campus publications should reflect the best in stu
dent body expression. In this respect, many feel that Stanford is making
strides. The Cardinal, the Illustrated Review, The Chaparral, and we hope
the Daily Palo Alto have taken on a tone and have expressed an open-mind
edness of which the campus is justifiably proud. There is still much to be
desired in campus publications and with this end in view the journalists of
the campus must work.
Nevertheless, there is a retisence about talking about the ideals, the
thoughts which mean most to us. We would not cheapen them by common
talk but when the occasion arises there should be no hesitancy in speaking
up. Our periodicals are hesitant, our leaders of student opinion are often
hesitant. No one is ashamed of the finer things which he thinks or feels
but we often fail to make the finer things in our lives vital forces. If we
can't bring the idealism of the campus down to the smaller things of life
then we'll have a difficult time in applying tliem to the bigger issues. Habits
of mind and thought need daily exercise.
In looking toward the future, the time has come when the students of
the campus must prove that student government can be a success. They
must inspire confidence in the faculty and we must show then that to the
students of the University is due a certain amount of consideration, as a
thinking body. Intelligence and rationality will do more to win the respect
of the older men and women connected with the University than anything
else. The waves and shifting of campus opinion from one stand to another
have necessarily brought about a certain amount of distrust of student
opinion. Hasty and ill-advised sentiments sweep the student body like
wildfire. The students generally come around to sound conclusions in time
but it is the first illogical outbursts that we must guard against. There is
much to be said in our defense but we must inevitably assume a share of
the blame.
Idealism has always been a force in guiding the athletic policy of Stan
ford and clean sport and fair play have always been a criterion of the Stan
ford athlete. The student body is known by the outsider for its wonderful
spirit and enthusiasm. It is this same spirit which we would have carried
on into other fields of campus and student activities.
Too little Is expected of the student body at present but before we can
expect to be given new responsibilities we must first prove that we can live
up to those we already have. If the finer spirit is always put first in the
future activities of the student body, student control will prove a success,
athletics will always be on the ascendency, and the printed expression of
student sentiment will always be a credit to Stanford men and women.

STANFORD rugby enthusiasts would he inspired by the account of a game
recently held in Edinburgh, before 25,000 spectators, in which the Scots
defeated the Irish. The game was one of a series played for the United King
dom Championship. France, Wales and Ireland, have gone down to defeat
before the Scots, and only the Calcutta Cup game on March 20 stands between
them and the championship.
Probably the success of the English game is due to the opportunity which
they have to develop it along international lines. It is too bad that Stanford
isn't nearer the United Kingdom so that she could enter in the keen compe
tition which the sport deserves. Rugby has played a brilliant part in the
history of Stanford athletics and it is with considerable regret that many
watch the decline of the sport on account of the lack of competition and
general interest.

much to be said in our defense but we must inevitably assume a share of
the blame.
Idealism has always been a force in guiding the athletic policy of Stan
ford and clean sport and fair play have always been a criterion of the Stan
ford athlete. The student body is known by the outsider for its wonderful
spirit and enthusiasm. It is this same spirit which we would have carried
on into other fields of campus and student activities.
Too little Is expected of the student body at present but before we can
expect to be given new responsibilities we must first prove that we can live
up to those we already have. If the finer spirit is always put first in the
future activities of the student body, student control will prove a success,
athletics will always be on the ascendency, and the printed expression of
student sentiment will always be a credit to Stanford men and women.

STANFORD rugby enthusiasts would he inspired by the account of a game
recently held in Edinburgh, before 25,000 spectators, in which the Scots
defeated the Irish. The game was one of a series played for the United King
dom Championship. France, Wales and Ireland, have gone down to defeat
before the Scots, and only the Calcutta Cup game on March 20 stands between
them and the championship.
Probably the success of the English game is due to the opportunity which
they have to develop it along international lines. It is too bad that Stanford
isn't nearer the United Kingdom so that she could enter in the keen compe
tition which the sport deserves. Rugby has played a brilliant part in the
history of Stanford athletics and it is with considerable regret that many
watch the decline of the sport on account of the lack of competition and
general interest.
IT has often been said that in the youth of a nation lies the idealism of a
nation and this is hi a large measure true. The college man and woman
should have hopes and aspirations of which they are not afraid and in which
they have every confidence. The man or woman with a degree has had a
training which brings the realization of things hoped for closer; he has the
inspiring example of men who have gone from the portals of his university
and who have made good in the world; he has had the associations which
always look forward toward building above the average standard; and he has
the faith and the confidence of those who have had a part in those advantages
which have done so much toward making him a leader. Training, culture,
idealism, are all on the side of the college man or woman and it is logical
to conclude that a student body should reflect this background. Their chal
lenge is, do we live up to what the world at large lias a right to expect of us?
The practical application of ideals begins with the small routine of
every-day practicalities. Campus publications should reflect the best in stu
dent body expression. In this respect, many feel that Stanford is making
strides. The Cardinal, the Illustrated Review, The Chaparral, and we hope
the Daily Palo Alto have taken on a tone and have expressed an open-mind
edness of which the campus is justifiably proud. There is still much to be
desired in campus publications and with this end in view the journalists of
the campus must work.
Nevertheless, there is a retisence about talking about the ideals, the
thoughts which mean most to us. We would not cheapen them by common
talk but when the occasion arises there should be no hesitancy in speaking
up. Our periodicals are hesitant, our leaders of student opinion are often
hesitant. No one is ashamed of the finer things which he thinks or feels
but we often fail to make the finer things in our lives vital forces. If we
can't bring the idealism of the campus down to the smaller things of life
then we'll have a difficult time in applying tliem to the bigger issues. Habits
of mind and thought need daily exercise.
In looking toward the future, the time has come when the students of
the campus must prove that student government can be a success. They
must inspire confidence in the faculty and we must show then that to the
students of the University is due a certain amount of consideration, as a
thinking body. Intelligence and rationality will do more to win the respect
of the older men and women connected with the University than anything
else. The waves and shifting of campus opinion from one stand to another
have necessarily brought about a certain amount of distrust of student
opinion. Hasty and ill-advised sentiments sweep the student body like
wildfire. The students generally come around to sound conclusions in time
but it is the first illogical outbursts that we must guard against. There is
much to be said in our defense but we must inevitably assume a share of
the blame.
