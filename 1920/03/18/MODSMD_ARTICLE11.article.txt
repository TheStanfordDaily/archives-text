# DEAN OF WOMEN POINTS OUT OBJECTIONS TO SORORITIES
## President's Report Contains First Attack on Organizations 
### 
"Close observation for three years"
of certain conditions on the Stanford
campus "has convinced the Dean of
Women that she is a witness to the
'growth of exclusive and undemocratic
castes within the University' which
the founding grant states 'is "the duty
of the University authorities to pro
hibit, " says Dean Harriet Bradford
in her section of the President's an
nual report to the Board of Trustees
recently made.
Conditions Set Forth
Tlie conditions set forth in Dean
Bradford's report are: (1) The atti
tude of sorority pledges and initiates
living in Roble Hall; (2), the tone of
social ideals expressed in various
campus functions and (3), the lack
of friendliness and comradeship be
tween the members of the sororities
themselvesfi and between the members
of the sororities and Roble Hall girls.
The section of Dean Bradford's re
port relating to the sorority house
question is as follows:
The success of Roble Hall indicates
that the University can reasonably as
sume the duty of housing eventually
all its women students except those
living with parents or legal guardians.
It would seem well, therefore, for this
to be an announced university policy.
In line with this are the following reso
lutions of the Board of Trustees, (1)
expressing willingness to purchase any
fraternity houses offered for sale;
(2) favoring the dormitory plan of
housing students.
During the year 1918-19, the Dean of
Women, as opportunity occurred in
discussion of student problems has
stated to individual students that the
University hopes ultimately to house
all its women students in University
residence halls. She has intended
thereby to point out the probable
future of sorority houses at Stanford
far enough in advance of the comple
tion of the second residence hall that
the sorority chapters may be prepar
ing themselves for further extension
of the dormitory facilities of the Uni
versity. Thus, if there is any prin
ciple behind opposition to the assump
tion by the University of its housing
obligation, it may be placed squarely
alongside the principle upon which the
University proposes acting in assum
ing this obligation and the two may
be weighed together.
Defects Pointed Out
The decision to make a beginning
toward preparing student opinion for
the gradual elimination of the sorority
house was hastened by certain defects
of the sorority house system that be
came apparent during the year 1918-
19: (1) The attitude of the sorority
pledges and initiates living in Roble
Hall under the residence regulation
indicated a sense of superiority to be
one of the results of their having been
asked to join a sorority. Since these
students otherwise showed often more
than average refinement, the responsi
bility for this condition in Roble Hall
rested obviously with the system. (2)
The tone of social ideals (using "so
cial" in its narrow sense) expressed
in various campus functions, such as
the Athletic Carnival in April 1919,
showed a failure of the sororities to
realize their responsibilities in the
community. The tone of the "con
cessions" of the sororities at this
Carnival was not representative of the
best at Stanford and reflected no
credit on Stanford girls. Yet sorori
ties, by virtue of their very existence,
must be expected to set the social
pace, since their members are the
leaders of campus life and are often
the girls of greatest power among the
women students.
Other Difficulties
Previous to the observation of these
conditions, other difficulties inherent
in the sorority house had presented
themselves. (1) Each house is prac
tically closed to non-sorority girls or
members of other sororities, except on
special invitation. It is rare that out
siders feel free to ring the door bell
and run into see their friends, as is

the custom in the Halls, and it too
often happens that the girls in one
house have no more than a bowing
acquaintance with those of another,
although the proximity of the houses
and the relatively small number liv
ing in each should encourage friendli
ness and comradeship.
Growth of Castes
Close observations, for three years,
of such conditions as those stated
above has convinced the Dean of Wo
men that she is a witness to the
"growth of exclusive and undemocratic
castes within the University," which,
the founding grant state,"it is the
duty of the University authorities to
prohibit." Moreover, in contemplating
further developments at the University
in the interests of the women stu
dents, the Dean of Women is faced by
the fact that if there is to be real
progress toward wholesome college
life among the women students, stu
dent life can not continue to find its
basis in or to exist in spite of divisions
and consequest inequality of opportun
ity among the women students.
It may be that when the sorority
house was allowed to establish itself
as a part of the university communi
ty, the simplicity of social life and the
pioneer spirit of pulling together in
spite of differences may have minim
ized the inherent difficulties of the
system. But the development of a
more and more artificial social life,
within and without the University
gates, and the apparent prosperity of
students organizations at the Uni
versity have contributed to emphasize
group rivalries and to put at a premi
um the "social" advantage of "mak
in ; a house."
Roble Hall has been filled to capaci
ty (211 students) since its opening in
October 1918, and Alvarado Hall, run
by Mrs. A. Hurd, has housed those
who applied too late to be accom
modated in Roble.
Roble Hall Satisfactory
The arrangement and equipment of
Roble Hall are proving for the most
part satisfactory and receive favorable
comment from visitors who have
studied the problems of housing in
other colleges. Certain minor defects
are being noted with a view to cor
recting them in the plans for the
second hall. The dining rooms and
main reception rooms are now some
what crowded, because of the tempo
rary connection of the additional wing
with this first building. In view of
this and of the use of Alvarado Hall
during the year 1918-19 and of the
marked increase in applicants for
Roble Hall for the year 1919-20, the
Dean of Women recommends that the
University proceed to complete at the
earliest possible moment the second
residence hall for women students. |
Thus progress will be made toward the
ultimate elimination of the problems
arising from houses run by the sorori-,
ty chapters which have inevitably re
solved the sororities into a distinct
social caste, destructive of that equal
ity of opportunity upon which the
founders built the University. I

October 1918, and Alvarado Hall, run
by Mrs. A. Hurd, has housed those
who applied too late to be accom
modated in Roble.
Roble Hall Satisfactory
The arrangement and equipment of
Roble Hall are proving for the most
part satisfactory and receive favorable
comment from visitors who have
studied the problems of housing in
other colleges. Certain minor defects
are being noted with a view to cor
recting them in the plans for the
second hall. The dining rooms and
main reception rooms are now some
what crowded, because of the tempo
rary connection of the additional wing
with this first building. In view of
this and of the use of Alvarado Hall
during the year 1918-19 and of the
marked increase in applicants for
Roble Hall for the year 1919-20, the
Dean of Women recommends that the
University proceed to complete at the
earliest possible moment the second
residence hall for women students. |
Thus progress will be made toward the
ultimate elimination of the problems
arising from houses run by the sorori-,
ty chapters which have inevitably re
solved the sororities into a distinct
social caste, destructive of that equal
ity of opportunity upon which the
founders built the University. I
"Close observation for three years"
of certain conditions on the Stanford
campus "has convinced the Dean of
Women that she is a witness to the
'growth of exclusive and undemocratic
castes within the University' which
the founding grant states 'is "the duty
of the University authorities to pro
hibit, " says Dean Harriet Bradford
in her section of the President's an
nual report to the Board of Trustees
recently made.
Conditions Set Forth
Tlie conditions set forth in Dean
Bradford's report are: (1) The atti
tude of sorority pledges and initiates
living in Roble Hall; (2), the tone of
social ideals expressed in various
campus functions and (3), the lack
of friendliness and comradeship be
tween the members of the sororities
themselvesfi and between the members
of the sororities and Roble Hall girls.
The section of Dean Bradford's re
port relating to the sorority house
question is as follows:
The success of Roble Hall indicates
that the University can reasonably as
sume the duty of housing eventually
all its women students except those
living with parents or legal guardians.
It would seem well, therefore, for this
to be an announced university policy.
In line with this are the following reso
lutions of the Board of Trustees, (1)
expressing willingness to purchase any
fraternity houses offered for sale;
(2) favoring the dormitory plan of
housing students.
During the year 1918-19, the Dean of
Women, as opportunity occurred in
discussion of student problems has
stated to individual students that the
University hopes ultimately to house
all its women students in University
residence halls. She has intended
thereby to point out the probable
future of sorority houses at Stanford
far enough in advance of the comple
tion of the second residence hall that
the sorority chapters may be prepar
ing themselves for further extension
of the dormitory facilities of the Uni
versity. Thus, if there is any prin
ciple behind opposition to the assump
tion by the University of its housing
obligation, it may be placed squarely
alongside the principle upon which the
University proposes acting in assum
ing this obligation and the two may
be weighed together.
Defects Pointed Out
The decision to make a beginning
toward preparing student opinion for
the gradual elimination of the sorority
house was hastened by certain defects
of the sorority house system that be
came apparent during the year 1918-
19: (1) The attitude of the sorority
pledges and initiates living in Roble
Hall under the residence regulation
indicated a sense of superiority to be
one of the results of their having been
asked to join a sorority. Since these
students otherwise showed often more
than average refinement, the responsi
bility for this condition in Roble Hall
rested obviously with the system. (2)
The tone of social ideals (using "so
cial" in its narrow sense) expressed
in various campus functions, such as
the Athletic Carnival in April 1919,
showed a failure of the sororities to
realize their responsibilities in the
community. The tone of the "con
cessions" of the sororities at this
Carnival was not representative of the
best at Stanford and reflected no
credit on Stanford girls. Yet sorori
ties, by virtue of their very existence,
must be expected to set the social
pace, since their members are the
leaders of campus life and are often
the girls of greatest power among the
women students.
Other Difficulties
Previous to the observation of these
conditions, other difficulties inherent
in the sorority house had presented
themselves. (1) Each house is prac
tically closed to non-sorority girls or
members of other sororities, except on
special invitation. It is rare that out
siders feel free to ring the door bell
and run into see their friends, as is

the custom in the Halls, and it too
often happens that the girls in one
house have no more than a bowing
acquaintance with those of another,
although the proximity of the houses
and the relatively small number liv
ing in each should encourage friendli
ness and comradeship.
Growth of Castes
Close observations, for three years,
of such conditions as those stated
above has convinced the Dean of Wo
men that she is a witness to the
"growth of exclusive and undemocratic
castes within the University," which,
the founding grant state,"it is the
duty of the University authorities to
prohibit." Moreover, in contemplating
further developments at the University
in the interests of the women stu
dents, the Dean of Women is faced by
the fact that if there is to be real
progress toward wholesome college
life among the women students, stu
dent life can not continue to find its
basis in or to exist in spite of divisions
and consequest inequality of opportun
ity among the women students.
It may be that when the sorority
house was allowed to establish itself
as a part of the university communi
ty, the simplicity of social life and the
pioneer spirit of pulling together in
spite of differences may have minim
ized the inherent difficulties of the
system. But the development of a
more and more artificial social life,
within and without the University
gates, and the apparent prosperity of
students organizations at the Uni
versity have contributed to emphasize
group rivalries and to put at a premi
um the "social" advantage of "mak
in ; a house."

"growth of exclusive and undemocratic
castes within the University," which,
the founding grant state,"it is the
duty of the University authorities to
prohibit." Moreover, in contemplating
further developments at the University
in the interests of the women stu

the fact that if there is to be real
progress toward wholesome college
life among the women students, stu

and consequest inequality of opportun

It may be that when the sorority
house was allowed to establish itself
as a part of the university communi
ty, the simplicity of social life and the
pioneer spirit of pulling together in
spite of differences may have minim
ized the inherent difficulties of the
system. But the development of a
more and more artificial social life,
within and without the University
gates, and the apparent prosperity of
students organizations at the Uni
versity have contributed to emphasize
group rivalries and to put at a premi
um the "social" advantage of "mak
in ; a house."
Roble Hall has been filled to capaci
ty (211 students) since its opening in
October 1918, and Alvarado Hall, run
by Mrs. A. Hurd, has housed those
who applied too late to be accom
modated in Roble.
Roble Hall Satisfactory
The arrangement and equipment of
Roble Hall are proving for the most
part satisfactory and receive favorable
comment from visitors who have
studied the problems of housing in
other colleges. Certain minor defects
are being noted with a view to cor
recting them in the plans for the
second hall. The dining rooms and
main reception rooms are now some
what crowded, because of the tempo
rary connection of the additional wing
with this first building. In view of
this and of the use of Alvarado Hall
during the year 1918-19 and of the
marked increase in applicants for
Roble Hall for the year 1919-20, the
Dean of Women recommends that the
University proceed to complete at the
earliest possible moment the second
residence hall for women students. |
Thus progress will be made toward the
ultimate elimination of the problems
arising from houses run by the sorori-,
ty chapters which have inevitably re
solved the sororities into a distinct
social caste, destructive of that equal

founders built the University. I
"Close observation for three years"
of certain conditions on the Stanford
campus "has convinced the Dean of
Women that she is a witness to the
'growth of exclusive and undemocratic
castes within the University' which
the founding grant states 'is "the duty
of the University authorities to pro
hibit, " says Dean Harriet Bradford
in her section of the President's an
nual report to the Board of Trustees
recently made.
Conditions Set Forth
Tlie conditions set forth in Dean
Bradford's report are: (1) The atti
tude of sorority pledges and initiates
living in Roble Hall; (2), the tone of
social ideals expressed in various
campus functions and (3), the lack
of friendliness and comradeship be
tween the members of the sororities
themselvesfi and between the members
of the sororities and Roble Hall girls.
The section of Dean Bradford's re
port relating to the sorority house
question is as follows:
The success of Roble Hall indicates
that the University can reasonably as
sume the duty of housing eventually
all its women students except those
living with parents or legal guardians.
It would seem well, therefore, for this
to be an announced university policy.
In line with this are the following reso
lutions of the Board of Trustees, (1)
expressing willingness to purchase any
fraternity houses offered for sale;
(2) favoring the dormitory plan of
housing students.
During the year 1918-19, the Dean of
Women, as opportunity occurred in
discussion of student problems has
stated to individual students that the
University hopes ultimately to house
all its women students in University
residence halls. She has intended
thereby to point out the probable
future of sorority houses at Stanford
far enough in advance of the comple
tion of the second residence hall that
the sorority chapters may be prepar
ing themselves for further extension
of the dormitory facilities of the Uni
versity. Thus, if there is any prin
ciple behind opposition to the assump
tion by the University of its housing
obligation, it may be placed squarely
alongside the principle upon which the
University proposes acting in assum
ing this obligation and the two may
be weighed together.
Defects Pointed Out
The decision to make a beginning
toward preparing student opinion for
the gradual elimination of the sorority
house was hastened by certain defects
of the sorority house system that be
came apparent during the year 1918-
19: (1) The attitude of the sorority
pledges and initiates living in Roble
Hall under the residence regulation
indicated a sense of superiority to be
one of the results of their having been
asked to join a sorority. Since these
students otherwise showed often more
than average refinement, the responsi
bility for this condition in Roble Hall
rested obviously with the system. (2)
The tone of social ideals (using "so
cial" in its narrow sense) expressed
in various campus functions, such as
the Athletic Carnival in April 1919,
showed a failure of the sororities to
realize their responsibilities in the
community. The tone of the "con
cessions" of the sororities at this
Carnival was not representative of the
best at Stanford and reflected no
credit on Stanford girls. Yet sorori
ties, by virtue of their very existence,
must be expected to set the social
pace, since their members are the
leaders of campus life and are often
the girls of greatest power among the
women students.
Other Difficulties
Previous to the observation of these
conditions, other difficulties inherent
in the sorority house had presented
themselves. (1) Each house is prac
tically closed to non-sorority girls or
members of other sororities, except on
special invitation. It is rare that out
siders feel free to ring the door bell
and run into see their friends, as is

the custom in the Halls, and it too
often happens that the girls in one
house have no more than a bowing
acquaintance with those of another,
although the proximity of the houses
and the relatively small number liv
ing in each should encourage friendli
ness and comradeship.
Growth of Castes
Close observations, for three years,
of such conditions as those stated
above has convinced the Dean of Wo
men that she is a witness to the
"growth of exclusive and undemocratic
castes within the University," which,
the founding grant state,"it is the
duty of the University authorities to
prohibit." Moreover, in contemplating
