# DEAN OF WOMEN POINTS OUT OBJECTIONS TO SORORITIES
## President's Report Contains First Attack on Organizations 
### 
"Close observation for three years"
of certain conditions on the Stanford
campus "has convinced the Dean of
Women that she is a witness to the
'growth of exclusive and undemocratic
castes within the University' which
the founding grant states 'is "the duty
of the University authorities to pro
hibit, " says Dean Harriet Bradford
in her section of the President's an
nual report to the Board of Trustees
recently made.
Conditions Set Forth
Tlie conditions set forth in Dean
Bradford's report are: (1) The atti
tude of sorority pledges and initiates
living in Roble Hall; (2), the tone of
social ideals expressed in various
campus functions and (3), the lack
of friendliness and comradeship be
tween the members of the sororities
themselvesfi and between the members
of the sororities and Roble Hall girls.
The section of Dean Bradford's re
port relating to the sorority house
question is as follows:
The success of Roble Hall indicates
that the University can reasonably as
sume the duty of housing eventually
all its women students except those
living with parents or legal guardians.
It would seem well, therefore, for this
to be an announced university policy.
In line with this are the following reso
lutions of the Board of Trustees, (1)
expressing willingness to purchase any
fraternity houses offered for sale;
(2) favoring the dormitory plan of
housing students.
During the year 1918-19, the Dean of
Women, as opportunity occurred in
discussion of student problems has
stated to individual students that the
University hopes ultimately to house
all its women students in University
residence halls. She has intended
thereby to point out the probable
future of sorority houses at Stanford
far enough in advance of the comple
tion of the second residence hall that
the sorority chapters may be prepar
ing themselves for further extension
of the dormitory facilities of the Uni
versity. Thus, if there is any prin
ciple behind opposition to the assump
tion by the University of its housing
