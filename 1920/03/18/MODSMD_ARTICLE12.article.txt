# Women Issue Handbook To Be Distributed On Registration Day
## 
### 
Information of particular interest to
the women of the University lias been
compiled in the Women's Handbook
which will be ready for distribution on
Registration Day of next quarter. The
Handbook was made up by the present
Women's Council in answer to a long
felt need for such a pamphlet. It will be
distributed from the Registrar's Office
free of charge by members of Women's
Con ference.
The Handbook begins with a fore
word by Dean Harriet Bradford, in
which the aims and ideals of Stanford
women are outlined. The grant of au
thority issued to Organized Women by
President Wilbur is the next feature.
I his grant of powers is a codification
of the existing regulations pertaining to
the women students, and also defines
the authority of the various organiza
tions. It was recently secured through
the efforts of Women's Council.
The Handbook also contains all the
University regulations and Women's
Conference rulings with which all the
recent changes are incorporated. A list
of the women's organizations concludes
the book.
