# FRESHMAN NINE WILL PLAY AT SAN JOSE
## 
### 
The freshman baseball team will play
San Jose High School tomorrow after
noon at San Jose. Owing to the rains
the babes have played no games this
week, so will be well rested.
Either Rogers or Gray will start the
game for the freshmen, with George
Green behind the bat.
New uniforms of a dark red color
have been issued the first-year men,
who are fast rounding into good shape
for the California games to be played
next quarter.
The game tomorrow will be called at
four o'clock.
