# HIGH TIDES PREVENT REGULAR CREW WORK
## Borrowed California Shell Arrives—Rogers Uses Coaching Launch 
### 
High tide at the Redwood Estuary
has prevented practice in the shells
for the crews during the past two
days and Coach Rogers has sent his
men through a four mile run instead.
Work on the water will be resumed
today if possible. The University of
California has loaned a shell which
arrived today giving more adequate
facilities for the men. The new
coaching launch now being used has
provided Coach Rogers a better op
portunity to size up his men than
has been possible in the past.
On the days that high tide has pre
vented practice at Redwood, the men
have been sent through long runs.
When at Redwood the work has been
confined to rows averaging six miles
and on Sundays about twenty miles.
The last time the crews worked
out at Redwood, the following men
were in the boats:
Varsity—Steinbeck, stroke; McCor
mack, 7; Brown, 6; McGillivray, 5;
Davis, 4; Snow, 3; Moore, 2; and
Jeffers, bow.
Second varsity—Cary, stroke; Woost
er, 7; McKinnon, 6; Adams, 5; Smith,
4; Pehl. 3; Olmstead, 2; and Wilbur
bow.
Freshman—Walters, stroke; Min
shall, 7; Loomis, 6; Helser, 5; Hicks,
4; Bowes, 3; Mattox, 2; and Rosen
blum, bow.
Rice, Tucker, King, Bogel, Richard
son and Giessler have also worked out
in the freshman crew regularly.
