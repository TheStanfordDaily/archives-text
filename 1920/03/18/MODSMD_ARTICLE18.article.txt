# Comptroller Roth Makes Changes in Dormitories
## 
### 
lii connection with the reorganization
of the business system of the Univer
sity by Comptroller A. E. Roth, decided
changes are being made in Encina and
Sequoia Halls. Changing of rooms will
be arranged under a better system, and
an up-to-date directory of each hall will
be kept so that telegrams may be deliv
ered readily. Express coming prepaid
or sent collect will be handled through
the offices of the custodians, as an ac
commodation for the students. As re
gards damage and breakage, if the same
is reported immediately, it will be re
paired immediately. The storerooms
will have less loss because of Yale locks
and a card-index system kept by the
custodian.
