# VARSITY WINS RAGGED GAME FROM O.A.C.
## Nines Show Poor Form In First Conference Match 
### 
By a score of 4 to 3, Stanford won
a ragged baseball game from the
Oregon Aggies. yesterday afternoon on
the varsity diamond. This first Pa
cific Coast Conference game will be
followed by another between the same
nines this afternoon.
Bundy, heading the Cardinal batting
order, made first base on an error.
Kline cracked a three-bagger into left
field, scoring Bundy. Before the end
of the first inning, Kline crossed the
home plate.
From then on, the game was a battle
between the two pitchers, both hav
ing poor fielding support. Draper al
lowed only one man to walk, seven
hits, and struck out four. Keene,
pitching for the Oregon team, walked
seven men, struck out nine, and al
lowed only three hits.
The first two tallies for the Aggies
were made in different innings, when
there had already been two outs
chalked up. Also, because of poor
fielding support, Tuebner made Stan
ford's third run.
The only exciting feature of the
game happened in the ninth inning,
when the score stood 3 to 3. Mit
chell was on third base, waiting to
make the Cardinal's winning run.
With two outs, Draper took the bat,
and knocked the ball to the Aggie sec-
ond baseman, whose error gave Stan
ford the victory.
