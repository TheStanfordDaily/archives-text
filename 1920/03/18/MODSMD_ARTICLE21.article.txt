# CAMPAIGN BEGINS FOR "AMERICA'S GIFT TO FRANCE"
## 
### 
A campaign for contributions to the
national fund for "America's Gift to
France", a statue to be erected at
Meaux, Prance, in commemoration Â» 112
the Battle of the Marne, will be
launched on the campus the first part
of this week. The collection will be
carried on throughout the United
States for three days and in order to
make Stanford's subscription one
hundred per cent, and to secure the
support of every student in the Uni
versity, the rate of subscription on
the campus has been placed at ten
cents per person. A campaign will
be made among all the living groups
and an opportunity will be given every
one to contribute to the memorial
fund.
The project is under the direction of
a national committee, headed by Hon.
Myron T. Herrick, former ambassador
to France, and is the outcome of a
plan begun in 1917, when a committee
of representative American citizens
dedicated themselves to the purpose
of raising, by public subscription, suf
ficient funds to erect on the site of
the first battle of the Marne a colos-
sal statue in commemoration of the
victory of the French in 1914. The
American sculptor, Frederick Mac-
Monies, is now working on sketches
for a statue of a size worthy of the
event which it is to commemorate.
When completed, it is to constitute
the embodiment of the feeling which
we, as Americans, have for France.
It is estimated that $250,000 will
be required to design and construct
this statue, to transport it to France
and to erect it at Meaux, where the
battle was fought, upon a site to be
selected by Marshal Foch and Marshal
Joft're. In order that the statue may
be "America's Gift to France" in the
true sense of the words, the funds
must come from all parts of the coun
try, from people in every walk of life.
With the comparatively limited sum
required, it has been decided by the
committee to solicit popular subscrip
tions ranging from one cent to any
amount the donor cares to give.
