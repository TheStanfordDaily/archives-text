# ALUMNI INFLUENCE ON THE UNDERGRADUATE
## 
### 
OTANFORD has a peculiar situation facing her in regard to her alumni. The
oldest of her alumni today are only middle-aged and the '95 class is still
making traditions for the University. There is no traditional custom as to
procedure for class reunions. There is no definite period of reunion which
is generally known, although steps are being taken along that line. The
founding of the University is still so vivid in the minds of most of the older
men and women of Stanford that they cannot realize that she is well on her
way toward growing up.
This institution has its reflection in the active student body. The alumni
of many universities, most particularly those in the eastern part of the
United States, have a decided influence in the trend of student sentiment
upon questions which concern the university as a whole. The weight of
alumni opinion expressed through campus reunions and successful alumni
organizations wherever there are enough alumni to warrant an association,
attract and hold the attention of the undergraduate. Such organizations give
the students an opportunity to know the alumni and to view their opinion
with admiration and respect. Stanford students, while active in college for
the most part, have been denied this privilege.
June of this year marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of the graduation
of the Pioneer Class. Plans are now under way for the big reunion of that
class. It would seem fitting and proper that this group should take steps
toward building up such an organization that the active student body would
look for guidance from the alumni of the University.
J. E. McDowell's active work as alumni secretary will probably do much
to arouse alumni enthusiasm. In the hurry and rush of the outside world
the alumnus often needs a reminder of the fact that his Alma Mater still
needs him more than ever. The recollection of old associations will do much
to bind the University to those who have gone out from her gates. Mr.
McDowell is admirably fitted to strike the personal note which will quicken
the old spirit. He can present the problems of the University and have the
opportunity to make the alumni realize that in the future they will be ex
pected to play a much more active part in the affairs of Stanford than they
have, in the past.
The appointment of alumni on the Board of Trustees is a step toward
welding a closer bond between the University and the alumni. The active
work of the Board of Athletic Control is another step in the same direction.
Students instinctively feel that alumni represent, or at least are champions,
of the undergraduate. Whether this is true or not, there is a definite
psychological value in the attitude, which can be utilized by graduates of the
University for a definite good.
We hope that next June will see some definite steps taken toward
further alumni organization. The opportunity will come at that time to
head up all of the work which has been done in various communities in
dependent of university suggestion. Active work toward the Alumni En
dowment Fund will make both the undergraduates and the administration
feel the necessity of alumni support. The outlook is promosing for Stan
ford to meet her alumni' problem at last and we hope that she will not miss
her opportunity.

of the Pioneer Class. Plans are now under way for the big reunion of that
class. It would seem fitting and proper that this group should take steps
toward building up such an organization that the active student body would
look for guidance from the alumni of the University.
J. E. McDowell's active work as alumni secretary will probably do much
to arouse alumni enthusiasm. In the hurry and rush of the outside world
the alumnus often needs a reminder of the fact that his Alma Mater still
needs him more than ever. The recollection of old associations will do much
to bind the University to those who have gone out from her gates. Mr.
McDowell is admirably fitted to strike the personal note which will quicken
the old spirit. He can present the problems of the University and have the
opportunity to make the alumni realize that in the future they will be ex
pected to play a much more active part in the affairs of Stanford than they
have, in the past.
The appointment of alumni on the Board of Trustees is a step toward
welding a closer bond between the University and the alumni. The active
work of the Board of Athletic Control is another step in the same direction.
Students instinctively feel that alumni represent, or at least are champions,
of the undergraduate. Whether this is true or not, there is a definite
psychological value in the attitude, which can be utilized by graduates of the
University for a definite good.
We hope that next June will see some definite steps taken toward
further alumni organization. The opportunity will come at that time to
head up all of the work which has been done in various communities in
dependent of university suggestion. Active work toward the Alumni En
dowment Fund will make both the undergraduates and the administration
feel the necessity of alumni support. The outlook is promosing for Stan
ford to meet her alumni' problem at last and we hope that she will not miss
her opportunity.
