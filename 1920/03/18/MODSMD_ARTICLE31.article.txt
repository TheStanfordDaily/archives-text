# PELICAN RAZZES STANFORD "VAMP"
## Social Life on the Farm is Ridiculed in Berkeley Paper 
### 
A unique "razz" on the supposed
mediocrity of Stanford social life, and
the general "back-woods" atmosphere
of the "Farm" appears in the last
issue of the "Pelican," the University
of California comic magazine.
It is in the form of the life-history
of a "Vamp" who, prepared by ex
tensive training for conquests, goes to
the University of California, only to
find her natural talents and strenuous
training outshone by the Berkeley
Cleopatras. She almost gives up and
leaves college for all times, when she
realizes a last forlorn hope. To quote
directly from the story:
"Jane entered Stanford, and made
a tremendous hit with ths jays on the
Farm. They were wild to escort her
across tne pastures between the adobe
huts. Here the small-town vamp was
in her cheap class. Not for nothing
had she spent these weary months at
Berkeley, learning how it could be
done. She became the leader of the
Stanford farm-hands."
