# ARTILLERY ADJUTANT DISCUSSES MILITARY TRAINING
## Captain Howard Eager Shows Reasons For Bill Now Before Congress 
### 
"If the United States had had an
efficient program of nniversal military
training at the time the European
War gtafted, Germany would probably
never have involved us in it," said
Captain Howard Eager, Adjutant of
the Artillery Unit of the R. O. T. C.
here in discussing the proposed Uni
versal Training Bill today.
"In FiÂ«ld Artillery, for instance," he
stated, "at the time the United States
entered the War, there were only 240
trained artillery officers, with previ
ous service of one year or more.
Around this small group there had to
be built up the vast army of trained
artillery officers which we had at the
close of the war."
The proposal to include provision
for universal military training in the
army reorganization bill now before
Congress has been postponed for con
sideration until after the Presidential
election. It was thought too danger
ous to include it in the present bill,
owing to the time which will be con
sumed in debating it.
"It is impossible to state definitely
whether or not the bill will ultimately
be passed," said Capt. Eager, "but the
present indications are that it is look
ed on very favorably in both houses
of Congress. The only opposition is
on the grounds of the cost, but a num
ber of military officers have pointed
out the vast saving it will mean to
the nation in case of another war.
There are a great many so-called
pacifists in this country who oppose
the bill, but whether or not they will
control the next Congress or not it
is impossible to state."
The bills proposed in the Senate and
House of Representatives if passed,
would have made military training
compulsory for all men of a certain
age, for a period of from three to six
months, with the privilege of choos
ing a four-year enlistment in the Na
tional Guard in place of the three or
six months training camp.
This will probably be the basis of
the bill which Congressman Julius
Kahn of California has been promised
will be presented at the next session
of Congress.
