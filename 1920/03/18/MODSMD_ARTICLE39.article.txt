# DEAN OF COLUMBIA LAW SCHOOL WANTS CHANGE IN METHODS
## 
### 
The necessity for the elimination of
"dramatics and parrot-fashion teach
ing in law training" is emphasized in
the annual report of Dean Harlan F.
Stone of the Law School of Columbia
University. Law training in pleading
and practice lacks unity and definite
ness of aim, he believes.
"A few schools," he says, "acknowl
edge their inability to deal with the
problem by offering brief courses in
common law pleading only, leaving
graduates to struggle in practice with
procedure under the codes or prac
tice acts as best they can. The func
tion of the law school is to train the
individual student and not to display
the ability of the teacher."
The ultimate test of the success of
the professional law school, he be
lieves, must be its ability to impart
to its students the spirit of creative
scholarship, so that as members of
the bar they will be able to possess
the power and the inclination to bring
to bear on the problems of law ad
ministration a thoroughly trained ca
pacity for analysis and a trained judg
ment, aided by a well-grounded knowl
edge of courses and the vital ele
ments of legal justice. "The future of
the bar," the Dean concludes, "and
of the administration of justice in this
country depends more on the law
schools of the country than on any
other bingle factor."
