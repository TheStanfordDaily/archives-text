# TWO PUBLISHERS ASK TO PRINT REDLANDS DEBATE
## Coach McClintock Announces Order of Speakers for Redlands Trio 
### 
Owing to a misunderstanding be
tween Coach McClintock and Presi
dent Egbert Nichols of Redlands Uni
versity, the arguments given by both
the Redlands and Stanford trios in
their debate on compulsory arbitra
tion here next quarter, may not be
printed in the Debater's Handbook
series, as has been previously an
nounced. Both President Nichols and
the H. E. Wilson Company have an
nounced their intentions of including
the speeches of the Stanford-Redlands
contest in their next debating pub
lication. However, unless other ar
rangements are made, the plan will
probably be carried out by only one
of the parties.
The speeches are to be taken as de
livered by the contestants at the time
of the debate by an expert stenog
rapher, and printed in one, or perhaps
both of these publications devoted to
inter-collegiate debating.
J. H. Anglim, '23, L. W. Hodges, '21,
and T. G. Irwin, '23, will uphold the
negative of the question against the
Redlands trio on the local platform
on April 6. The question as submitted
is, "Resolved, That all railway labor
disputes should be referred to a
Federal Board of Arbitration with
compulsory powers."
The local trio has had previous ex
perience in squad work on industrial
problems, including almost a full
quarter's work on the closed shop
question. Their study of labor prob
lems has given them a broad founda
tion on which to base convincing con
structive argument. The recent change
of railway ownership in the United
States together with the threatened
strikes resulting from the undesirable
labor conditions claimed to prevail
in that industry makes the topic for
discussion one of general interest.
Anglim has the advantage of hav
ing had practical experience in squad
debates on the Plumm Plan. Although
he is a first-year man, his easy de
livery and fluency naturally places
him as first negative speaker.
Hodges has been prominent in so
ciety and class contests for the past
two years and is well fitted to repre
sent Stanford in this debate. He will
act at second negative speaker.
IrwiH, another first-year man, is new
at the debating game at Stanford,
but his adaptability to both construc
tive argument and refutation has lead
to his selection as concluding speaker
for the negative.
The Redlands team, which is now
debating eastern colleges, will uphold
the affirmative of the question here,

as they have been doing during their
eastern trip. Although this will be
Stanford's first forensic contest with
Redlands University, it is certain that
in view of the visitors' reputation
elsewhere, that they will be formid
able opponents. Their previous ex
perience in debating other colleges on
this question will be a difficult handi
cap for the Stanford team to over
come, but the lccal trio is looking for
ward to a victory despite the obvious
disadvantages of their position.
