# GLEE CLUB WILL TOUR SOUTH ON VACATION TRIP
## 
### 
Plans are now being completed for
the concert tour of the Stanford Glee
Club, on which they will start next Fri
day afternoon, March 26. This is the
first time the club has been active dur
ing the last three years, owing to the
scarcity of men on the campus during
the war.
Over forty men have been working
and practicing for an opportunity to be
taken on the trip, but only about twenty
eight, including those in a special or
chestra will go. Willard J. Schindler,
'23, will be the soloist for the occasion,
while Lester L. Seib, '22, will provide
the funny light amusement, giving mon
ologues and perhaps impersonations.
The trip will be made in automobiles,
with concerts to be given at Pacific
(Trove, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara,
Los Angeles, Pasadena, Long Beach,
Riverside, Santa Ana, and if time per
mits they will return San Joa
quin valley, stopping at all the larger
cities.
