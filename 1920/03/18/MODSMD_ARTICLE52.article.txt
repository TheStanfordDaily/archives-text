# PALO ALTO LACKS HOUSES FOR RENT
## 
### 
A canvass of the real estate offices
in Palo Alto disclosed the fact that the
number of houses for sale is sufficient,
but that the number of houses for rent
is negative. The real estate men report
that there is a heavy demand for rentals,
but that there is only one house for
rent in Palo Alto.
