# CAMPUS COMMITTEE URGES SIGNING OF HOOVER PETITION
## 
### 
A petition to put Herbert Hoover's
name in the California presidential pri
maries will be circulated on the campus
tonight and tomorrow morning, and the
Stanford Hoover Club is extremely anx
ious to have all registered voters at
Stanford sign. The Hoover Committee
of California prepared the petition on
short notice, and it must be presented
to the county clerk's office very soon.
Owing to the short time allowed the
local organization to obtain the signa
tures, the petition will be circulated
among the living groups tonight only.
It is not necessary that the signers of
the petition have Republican convictions,
but they must be registered. Any one
not yet registered can do so at Dean
McDowell's office, or, if they live in Palo
Alto, registration can be made there.
