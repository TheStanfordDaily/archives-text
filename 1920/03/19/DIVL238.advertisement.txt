The Service of an Electrical
Research Laboratory
The research facilities of the General Electric Company
are an asset of world-wide importance, as recent war
work has so clearly demonstrated. Their advantages
in pursuits of peace made Ithem of inestimable value
in time of war.
A most interesting story tells of the devices evolved which sub
stantially aided in solving one of the most pressing problems of
the war—the submarine menace. Fanciful, but no less real, were
the results attained in radio communication which enabled an
aviator to control a fleet of flying battleships, and made possible
the sending, without a wire, history-making messages and orders
to ships at sea. Scarcely less important was the X-ray tube,
specially designed for field hospital use and a notable contribution to
the militarvsurgical service. And many other products,ior both com
batant and industrial use, did their fuil share in securing the victory.
In the laboratories are employed highly trained physicists,chemists,
metallurgists and engineers, some of whom are experts of inter
national raputation. These men are working not only to convert
the resources of Nature to be of service t) man. but to increase
the usefulness of electricity in every line of endeavor. Tlieir
achievements benefit every individual wherever electricity is used.
Scientific research works hand in hand with the development of new
devices, more efficient apparatus and processes of manufacture. It
results in the discovery of better and more useful materials and ulti
mately in making happier and more livable the life of all mankind.
