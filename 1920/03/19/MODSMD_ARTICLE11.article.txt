# COLLECTION FOR "GIFT TO FRANCE" FUND IS STARTED
## "10-Cent" Rate Aims to Make Stanford Contribution 100 per cent 
### 
Contributions for "America's Gift to
!â€¢ ranee," the national campaign for
funds for the Marne memorial which
is being carried on throughout the
United States, will be collected on the
campus next Monday. Tn order to make
Stanford's subscription 100 per cent, and
and to secure the support of every stu
dent in the University, the rate of sub
scription on the campus has been placed
at ten cents per person. A campaign
will be made among all the living groups
; nd some one has been appointed in each
house to take charge of the collection,
so that ?.i opporUnity will be given
every one to contribute to the fund.
it is estimated that the total cost of
the memorial, which is to be a colossol
statue to be set up at Meaux, France,
and now being designed by the Ameri
can sculptor. Frederick Mac Monies, will
amount to $250,000, and with this com
paratively limited sum, the national
committee in charge of the project
wishes to make the statue the gift of all
America by soliciting popular subscrip
tions ranging from one cent to any
amount the doner cares to give.
The offer of this memorial to the
French Government has received the
highest official sanction of the French
Republic, and it has been accepted, with
many expressions of graitude. There is
precedent for such a gift in our own
Statue of Liberty, which was presented
to the United States by the people of
France, and represents the liberty which
France helped America to win over a
hundred years ago. "America's Gift to
France" is to be a symbol of the liberty
France maintained at the battle of the
Marne, and will represent France as a
woman rising from the field of battle,
holding in her hand the flag of liberty.
A Memorial Book, containing the names
of all cities, and towns, and societies
which have subscribed, will be presented
to the French Republic and placed in a
museum in the base of the statue, in
token of the friendship of the two re
publics.
