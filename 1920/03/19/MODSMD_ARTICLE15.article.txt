# STANFORD STUDENTS MAY STUDY IN BELGIUM
## Exchange Fellowship System Provides Expenses For Two Graduates 
### 
Two graduates of Stanford University
will be privileged to pursue studies at
a Belgian University or technical school
next year, while two Belgian students
will pursue a course at Stanford, as the
result of a system of exchange graduate
fellowships which has been established
by the Commission for Relief in Bel
gium.
President Wilbur today received a pre
liminary announcement of the plan, to
gether with an invitation to nominate
two Stanford graduates as holders of
the fellowships in Belgium. The offer
is open to men students only, and the
fellowships of the Americans in Bel
gium will pay 10,000 francs in addition
to necessary traveling expenses from
the United States to Belgium and return,
along with any necessary tuition fees.
For the Belgians coming to America the
stipend will be $1,000 in addition to the
necessary expenses.
Five American universities are includ
ed in this plan and five Belgian. The
American institutions which are privi
ltged to send two graduates each to
Belgium while receiving two Belgian
students, are, besides Stanford: Yale,
Harvard, Princeton, and the University
of California. The Belgian institutions
are: The University of Brussels, the
University of Ghent, the University of
Liege, the University of Louvain, and
the SchÂ«ol of Mines at Mons.
Stanford University will, of coursc,
aci ept an offer of applications for the
fellowships will doubtless be made
through the regular channels for such
applications although there has not yet
l een opportunity to take any official ac
tion in the matter. These applications
must be in the hands of the New York
office of the fellowship committee before
the first of May, 1920. The Fellowship
Committee of the Commission for Re
lief in Belgium which has charge of the
plan includes Professors Vernon Kel
logg of Stanford, and Edgar Rickard
and Prentiss N. Gray of the University
of California, all of whom were very
closely associated with Herbert Hoover
throughout the entire period of the work
of the Commission for Relief in Bel
gium.
These fellowships will be open only
to male graduate students; that is, to
Americans holding a Bachelor's degree,
from recognized universities, and to
Belgians qualified for admission to grad
uate standing in the American univer
sities. American candidates for the Bel
gian fellowships should be able to write
and speak French, and Belgian candi
dates for the American fellowships
should be able to write and speak Eng
lish. In choosing fellows, preference
is to be given those who arc unable by
their own means to support the cost
of their studies in Belgium or America.
