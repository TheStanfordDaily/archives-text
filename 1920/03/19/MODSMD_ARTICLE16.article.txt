# CAST OF OPERA TO BE SELECTED NEXT QUARTER BY SEIB
## 
### 
Tryouts for leads and choruses of
Junior Opera will take place immedi
ately on the beginning of the spring
quarter. Coach L. B. Seib, '22, states
that a large number of candidates will
he needed at the first tryouts, and he
is anxious that all eligible persons be
ready to enter competition for parts
as soon as the vacation is over.
The Opera Committee is spending
several hours daily in consideration
of the plots and plays submitted, and
it is expected that a selection will be
made this week.
A few operas have been discarded
because of their direct bearing on
campus or Stanford University life.
It is probable that open competition
for songs to be included in the pro
duction will be conducted by the com
mittee early next quarter.
