# THREE QUINTETS TIED FOR INTRAMURAL LEAD
## 
### 
Two hard battles marked yesterday's
intramural card in the Encina Gym. The
Encina second Hoor quintet "hung the
sack" on the Chi Psis for 14 points to
9 for the Chi Psi five. Fouling on the
part of the Chi Psis helped the Encina
team to pile up their score, and if they
had been as good at throwing free
throws as they were at field-work, they
would probably have comc out on the
long end of the score. Larson, the star
of the Hall five, made four of the five
field goals, and his clever work in taking
the ball from the opponents did a great
deal towards winning the game. Wallace
was the chief point winner for the Chi
Psis, making two out of three field and
free goals.
El Camino handed out another knock
out when they put the D. U. five away
with a 10-to-7 tally. El Camino showed
the same speed and form that has char
acterized their playing from the first,
and the Delta Upsilon men, tired by
four days of continuous playing, were
unable to overcome the lead that El
Camino took at the beginning of the
second half. Hogle was working good
and put over eight of the ten points
scored by the El Camino quintet.
The results of the two games yester
day further complicated the schedule
and upset all the previous "dope." There
are now three teams tied for first honors
in the finals, all with the percentage of
666. Two of these, the Dekes and En
ciria (west) second, meet this afternoon;
and the other, El Camino, is matched
with Chi Psi. The latter game should
he a win for the El Camino Club if
present standing is any guide. The D.
K. E. five has a slight advantage over
the Encina quintet on account of having
rested yesterday, but Encina is a little
better in the basket work.
The winners of the two games today
will meet to decide the championship of
the intramural leagues. At present the
date is not known, but it will probably be
after vacation unless the two contestants
for the title can arrange to meet the last
of this week.
