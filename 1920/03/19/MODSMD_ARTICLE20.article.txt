# STANFORD SCORES SECOND WIN OVES NORTHERN TEAM
## Cardinals Will Cross Bats With Olympics Tomorrow 
### 
Stanford started the Pacific Coast
Conference baseball series, with two vic
tories scored against the Oregon Aggies.
Following Wednesday's defeat, the
northerners lost yesterday's game by a
3-to-2 score. Both games were marked
with ragged playing due to the early
ciason condition of the players.
When the Cardinal nine went to bat in
the ninth inning yesterday afternoon, the
score stood 2 to 1, in favor of the visit
ing team. Bundy made a single and
was advanced to second by an error on
the Aggie second baseman, which also
put Kallam on first. A line drive to
right by Kline brought Bunday home,
trying the score. Crowe took the bat
arid popped a single over the second
baseman's head, allowing Kallam to
make the winning run for Stanford.
Newland struck out six of the north
erners, and failed to allow a single man
to reach first on balls arid only allowed
four hits. Miller, the Agricultural Col
lege "southpaw," allowed one walk, and
struck out nine men.
The work of the varsity men shows
their improvement during the past two
weeks of practice under Coach Evans.
Although the team runs ragged at times,
the general form of the nine is above re
proach. With workouts every afternoon
of the spring vacation, a strong squad
will be ready to take the field against the
Blue and Gold on Tuesday, April 6.
Tomorrow afternoon at 3:30 o'clock,
the Stanford nine will match itself
against the Olympic Club team for a
second game of this season. Fifty-five
cents admission will be charged those
