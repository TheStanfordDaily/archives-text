# STRENGTHENING THE NAME OF STANFORD
## 
### 
THE "common ground" upon which faculty, alumni, and students stand is
the "University" and by this we mean the University as distinct from
the administration, the University apart of the student body, the University
separate from its alumni. Stanford is a name we use which includes all of
these elements and much more. The University includes all those things
which go to make the younger generation look forward to coming here and
which makes the older generation proud to have shared the privileges which
Stanford offers. The Memorial Church as nearly as any concrete building
could, typifies the finer side of Stanford. There is a certain reverence, a
certain sanctity which is closely connected with our Alma Mater.
There are many elements which go to make up that attitude toward the
University. Associations of one kind and another are probably the most
important factors. Life friendships are made in college days between stu
dents. These friendships will draw the man and woman of college educa
tion back to the University from the ends of the earth. Friendships will
bring to mind university days no matter where the children of Stanford hap
pen to be. It is this spirit which must be fostered in the undergraduate days.
Friendships between students and faculty while always worth-while in
studeijt days will prove more so later. After the student has left the Uni
versity he will always feel that there is someone whom he knows back on
the Farm if he is acquainted with members of the faculty. He will realize
what good friends they are and as soon as the academic viewpoint is re
moved, the professor turns out to be more or less of a pal after all.
Friendships between students and friendships between students and
faculty will do much toward making a stronger alumni. These are the two
ties which must inevitably bind Stanford men and women to the University.
If these ties can be fostered in undergraduate days, then the feeling will be
stronger when the University has been left behind.
In the week's editorials we have tried to point out in a general way,
some of the steps which might be considered along this line. The faculty
has done much toward making friends with the students and many, no doubt,
feel a little discouraged with the results. Nevertheless, the informal social
gatherings which so many of the faculty give, have done much toward pro
moting better feeling between the faculty and students. More than this is
needed, however. There should be some provision whereby faculty members
could come to the attention of the student body as a whole. It has been
suggested that in order to accomplish this end the means would have to be
made compulsory. Details could be worked out.
Students have certain responsibilities which must be lived up to. Stu
dent government is constantly growing stronger both among the men and
the women. The Men's Council and the Women's Council have assumed
more independent positions and for the most part have the backing of the
Student Affairs Committee in their decisions. The students will have to do
their part in meeting the faculty. The councils have carried on their work
successfully and have met the faculty on friendly terms. Now it is up to
the student body as a whole.
Finally, a closer alumni organization which the students could feel,
will do much toward doing away with the feeling of restlessness among the
present student body. As we have said befo r e the alumni members of the
Board of Athlotic Control and the Board of Trustees can do much toward
winning student confidence and the creation of an Alumni Endowment Fund
will bring about a closer alumni feeling.
Stanford faculty, alumni, and active students have stood together in the
past. There has been violent differences in viewpoints and opinions but in
the end they came to know what was the best for Stanford. The University
has always furnished the common ground and the means toward amalgamat
ing the diverse viewpoints. In the future that common ground must be closer
and the tie stronger for even as wo strengthen these two factors so will we
buiid and strengthen the name of Stanford.
