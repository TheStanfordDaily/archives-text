Supporters of baseball will have
their last chance to see the freshmen
in action before the holidays when
the babes meet the Bank of Italy
nine, tomorrow afternoon on the aux
iliary diamond.
The first-year men are developing
into a snappy ball club, and can be
counted on to give the California
freshmen a good battle.
The battery is composed of G.
Green, catcher; Gray, Rogers, and
Schwartz, pitchers. Patterson, Peavey,
C. Green and Heokendorf make up the
infield, while Carver, Welsh, and
Clinch hold down the outfield posi

The Bank of Itly nine has earned
quite a reputation while playing in
the city leagues of Oakland and San
Francisco.
The game will be started at 3:30
o'clock.
