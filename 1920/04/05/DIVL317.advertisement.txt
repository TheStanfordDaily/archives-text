A casting for one of the
huge water-wheel driven
generators installed in the
Mississippi River Power
Company's plant at Keo
kuk. This installation will
ultimately consist of thirty
of these machines, giving
a total capacity of 216,000
kilowatts (300,000 horse
power). It is the largest
hydro-electric development
in the world. The General
Electric Company builds
generator for water-wheel
drive in sizes ranging from
37h to 32,500 kilowatts and
the aggregate capacity of
G-K units now in successful
operation is in excess of
four million horse-power.

Utilizing Nature's Power
ELECTRICAL energy generated by water
power has grown to be one of our greatest
natural resources — and we have only begun to
reach its possibilities. It mines and refines our
ores, turns the wheels of industry, drives our
street cars and lights our cities and towns. The
power obtained from Nature sayes many million
tons of coal every year.
At first the field of its utilization was limited by the dis
tance electricity could be transported. But soon research
and engineering skill pointed the way to larger and better
electrical apparatus necessary for high-voltage trans
mission. Then ingenious devices were invented to insure
protection against lightning, short-circuits, etc., which
cause damage and interrupt the service. And now all over
the country a network of wires begins to appear, carry
ing the magic power.
The General Electric Company, with its many years' ex
perience, has played «a great part in hydro-electric develop
ment. By successfully co-ordinating the inventive genius
of the company and its engineering and manufacturing
abilities, it has accomplished some of the greatest achieve
ments in the production and application cf electrical
energy. • «- - , , ,
The old mill wheel of yesterday has gone. Today the
forces of immense volumes of water are harnessed and
sent miles away to supply the needs of industry and
business and the comforts of the home.
