# GEO. CULVER, '97, IS NAMED IN PLACE OF M'DOWELL AS DEAN OF UNIVERSITY MEN
## New Advisor Was Known as An Athlete and Journalist During Course at Stanford 
### 
Announcement was made on March 26
of the appointment of George B. Culver,
'97, Dean of Men, to fill the vacancy
which will be made with the retirement
of J. E. McDowell this quarter. The
appointment came as a surprise to many
of Culver's friends who are on the cam
pus, and considerable favorable comment
has been made by those who knew Cul
ver in his position at the Los Angeles
High School. He will not come to
Stanford until October of this year.
Culver has had an unusual breadth of
experience in a number of activities. He
graduated from Stanford in the Zoology
Department and in this connection was
Dr. Jordan's assistant in the Mazatlan
expedition to the western coast of Mex
ico in his freshman year. He was a
member of the varsity track squad and
was associate editor of Sequoia. In
1902 lie took the degree of B. L.in the
George Washington University in Wash
ington, D. C., where he was also engaged
in government work. The next year he
was a member of the editorial staff of
the Baltimore American. He returned
to California and in 1907 he became
teacher of science in the Los Angeles
High School. In 1908 he was elected
principal of the Santa Monica High
School, but was later called back to
his former school as head of the Science
Department.
Culver has been remembered for his
other activities rather than as a teacher
in the Los Angeles High School. He
acted as track coach and proved to be
immensely popular although having to
work under iinusually adverse criticism
on the part of the student body in the
early part of his work. In this connec
tion he came into contact with men who
were later to become well known Stan
ford athletes. Tom Coleman,' —, "Mick
ey" McClure, ' —, Brace Harrington, ' —,
and "Ted" Geissler, ' —, were among
those whom Culver gave their early
training. Culver is also well acquainted
with a considerable group of undergrad
uates on the campus which will facili
tate his first work as Dean of Men.
Besides his athletic work, Culver was
active in literary lines in the school.
On account of his newspaper experience,
Culver acted as advisor along journalis
tic lines and also gave a rather remark
able course in short-story writing which
continued over several quarters without
credit yet was always crowded. He act
ed on the debating committee and con
ducted work in hygiene.
There will be no Acting Dean of Men
during the spring and summer quarters.
