# ROY KING WILL ASSIST IN COACHING CREW MEN
## 
### 
Roy King, '19, who rowed stroke on
the last two Stanford crews, as well
as his freshman eight, will start as
sisting the coaching of the carsmen
today. "Les" Rogers, during the sea
son, has been unable to leave his busi
ness in San Francisco more than two
afternoons each week, so he requested
King to put the men through their
daily workouts for the final two weeks
grind before the annual regatta.
The varsity, freshman and second
varsity eights all took a twenty-five
mile pull yesterday morning. During
the next few days the men will be
put through strenuous workouts, and
then the remainder of the time before
the big race will be spent in putting
the finishing touches on the oarsmen
that are picked for the different po
sitions on the three boats.
Although no one can be certain of
his seat in the varsity shell, several
of the oarsmen have been rowing so
consistently in the same position that
they will probably be on the lineup
when the eight is picked next week.
Captain "Cash" Davis, rowing 4; Mc-
Gillivray, 5; Snow, 3; and Steinbeck,
stroke, are very seldom shifted around
the boat, and appear to be the strong

est contestants for their respective
seats.
The other two positions on the port
side of the boat, 2 and (5, will probably
be chosen from the following: Gary,
Brown, Moore, Brieson, McKinnon and
Olmstead. The positions of bow and
7, on the star-board side will be picked
from McCormack, Jeffers, Adams, Tell,
Wooster and Ells.
Competition is so keen for the
freshmen positions that it would be
unusually difficult to pick any tenta
tive eight. However, it is expected
that the men will be more or less per
manently seated before the end of
this week, when an announcement
will be made of their possible lineup.
During the spring vacation the crew
candidates practiced daily with extra
long runs. Several trial heats were
made which seemed to give Coach
Rogers a brighter outlook for the
coming regatta.
Practice has been greatly assisted
by the new coaching launch, and the
shell that was loaned by the Univer
sity of California. Work will con
tinue on the Redwood Estuary until
two days before the race, when the
different line-ups will be announced,
and the men will depart for the final
workouts, which will be on the Oak
land Estuary.
