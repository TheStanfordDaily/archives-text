# FLONZALEY QUARTET WILL GIVE CONCERT
## 
### 
Announcements are out for the con
cert of the Peninsula Musical Associa
tion's series for the present season, which
will be a program by the Flonzaley Quar
tet on Monday evening. April 12, in the
Stanford Assembly Hall.
This famous quartet is accepted the
world over as the foremost exponent
of chamber music at the present time.
Eor sixteen years they have held this
pre-eminent position, the one change in
their organization being the withdrawal
of Ugo Ara in 1917 to go into war serv
ice with the Italian forces. His position
as viola player was and still is tilled by
Louis Pailly, and the artistic excellence
of the playing of the Flonzaleys is in
nowise suffering from the change.
