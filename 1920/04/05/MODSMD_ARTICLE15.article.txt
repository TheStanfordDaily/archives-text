# OPERA COMMITTEE CHOOSES SCRIPT BY MONA GARDNER, '20, FOR JUNIOR SHOW
## MacBoyle, Midgley, and Hall To Write Lyrics and Songs For Annual Production 
### 
Miss Mona Gardner, '20, is author
ess of the 1921 Junior Opera. Her
opera, the tentative title of which is
"A Leap-Year Leap," was selected
from all the manuscripts submitted in
competition to the Junior Opera
Committee. Miss Gardner had the
leading part in the Senior Farce last
year and is a writer of unusual spirit
and originality. She is a member of
the Chi Omega sorority.
In selecting the Junior Opera, the
Committee also uncovered some new
talent in the local song writer's field.
L. W. Midgeley, '23, who with Miss
Gardner is a newcomer to Stanford
dramatics, had ten of his songs ac
cepted in the song-writing contest.
Two numbers written by T. J. Rey
nolds, '18, and R. S. Sewell, '20, were
also chosen for the 1921 production.
W. G. Hall, '19, is to write the lyrics
following out suggestions given him
by Miss Gardner.
What influenced the committee most
in selecting Miss Gardner's opera was
the freshness and originality of its
plot. The writer has evolved a maze
of humorous and romantic complica
tions for her interesting characters
and has carried out the general idea
with a spirit of subdued and subtle
fun. The book actually bubbles over
with clever lines and Miss Gardner
has crowded her plot with comedy
characters of a striking newness of
type.
The action of the opera centers
about an Indian Prince who has been
taken out of his oriental environment
and set down in a western world of
society. His penchant for letter-writ
ing gets him in an unusual middle and
before he is out of his predicament
he finds himself engaged to an Amer
ican girl. Two or three mix-ups of
mistaken identity help to complete the
tangled situation before the ingenuous
denouement.
One scene of the show takes place
in an artist's studio and the situation
there gives no end of opportunity for
original scenic effects. Many novelty
songs will feature the Junior produc
tion and they will be aided by the
lavish costuming on which the com
mittee is planning.
Coach Lester Seib, *22, will hold try
outs early in the quarter. A definite
date in Junior Week for the Opera
has not been settled as yet.
