# UNIVERSITY HEATING AND BUYING
## 
### 
fTHE discussion of the housing problem which came with the announcement
* of the university housing policy has brought several interesting sidelights
on the difficulties under which the student groups have been working and
several remedies have been suggested. The tremendous increase in the price
of foodstuffs has been one of the serious problems which the groups have
had to face. Although buying a considerable quantity of commodities, it was
found that the quantity was not sufficient to bring down prices materially.
University buying for the campus as a whole would undoubtdly have solved
the question and if this had been successfully carried out the administration
would not have found many of the groups in the financial position they are
today. As 1 ng as the University feels the necessity of assuming the responsi
bility of "providing an adequate home" for its students, it might be well to
have university buying until the dormitories are completed.
In this connection, university heating has been suggested. Although this
plan is perhaps not quite so practical as university buying on account of the
cost of installation, nevertheless it would have done much toward more com
fortable living for the students of the, campus. Heating has been one of the
big problems of the living groups. Many of the heating systems on the
campus were destroyed in the earthquake and have never benn replaced.
Pressure along financial lines has prevented the proper installation of heat
ing systems in most of the houses which have furnaces. The charge of in
adequate heating is a just one but the responsibility is no doubt divided be
tween the university and the living group. University co-operation should
have begun a long time ago and we hope that it will not drag in the time
which the living groups have to continue.
