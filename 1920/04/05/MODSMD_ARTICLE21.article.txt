# THE 						NEW DEAN OF MEN
## 
### 
fTHE appointment of George B. Culver, '97, as Dean of Men has been received
* on the campus with considerable enthusiasm by those students who knew
Culver in the Los Angeles High School. Reports concerning Culver's work
in Los Angeles portend for a brilliant outlook and Stanford can look forward
with pleasure to Culver's arrival on the campus.
Culver has had considerable experience in a variety of activities which
peculiarly adapt him to such an office as the Dean of Men. Not only is he
a specialist along scientific lines but he has acted as a newspaper man, track
coach, and confidant to the students of the southern school. He evidently has
the ability to handle men, to win their respect and confidence.
With such qualifications, Culver can take over his new duties with the
support of the University as whole behind him. The office of Dean of Men
is still in a formulative stage. Many misapprehensions are prevalent con
cerning the office and it is to be hoped that Culver can wipe the slate clean.
The Dean of Men is primarily a confidant and advisor, not a disciplinarian.
Culver is interested in student problems and with the goodwill of the student
body behind him. Culver will be able to make the office of the Dean of Men
considerable more influential than it is now by carrying the work already
started into new fields with perspective and vision.
