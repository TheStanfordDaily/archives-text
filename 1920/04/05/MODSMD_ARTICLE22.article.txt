# CLASS ROOM COURTESY
## 
### 
117ITH the opening of the new quarter it is appropriate to take stock of a
few of our faults and to make new resolutions and these motives could
not be better directed than to the classroom. Students have a habit of scrap
ing their feet toward the end of the hour even though the professor is still
lecturing. This habit is neither courteous nor excusable. It is annoying tt
the professor and to those members of the class who have some desire tc
listen to the closing words which are often the summary of the lecture.
No doubt this habit has arisen from thoughtlessness and no intentional
rudeness yet it is no credit to Stanford men and women. At best, the col
lege professor often works under difficulties, and this added confusion does
net promote good feeling. V'"hen a man or woman signs up for a course, a
certain obligation is assumed and in thih courtesy is certainly
included. Courtesy in thought and deed is a part of a successful education
and the men and women of Stanford should apnly it to the classroom.
