Winning both track meets on its
southern trip during spring vacation, the
varsity track team is now in shape for
the big meet with the University of
California on April 17 on the Berkeley
oval. The Varsity won from the Uni
versity of Southern California by the
score of 61 to 52, and from the com

place on the Stanford oval on Thursday,
and it will be the last competition for
the Varsity before the Stanford-Cali

showed up well on their southern trio.
Morris Kirksey negotiated the century
in 0:9 4-5 in the Redlands meet and tied
the intercollegiate record in the 220 by
making 0:21 3-5. Kirksey was not up
to his standard when he ran a sains
Paddock, the U. S. C. sprinter, and lost
to the southerner in both the 100 and
220. However, Kirksey will have a
chance to come back against Paddock
on Thursday.
Captain Jess Wells was a big point
winner in the U. S. C. meet, but failed
to perform up to standard against the
Redland-Pomona team. Floete. the third
sprinter on the squad, took third in the
220 against Redlands.
Scofield finished second to Kilbv. the
Redlands star, in the quarter, and Has

their pace in the polevault, and Temple
