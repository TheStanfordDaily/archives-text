# STANFORD FROSH WIN IN TWO TRACK MEETS
## 
### 
With all preliminary meets completed,
the Stanford Freshman track team is
putting in a final week of hard practice
for the California-Stanford meet to be
held on the local oval next Saturday at
3 o'clock.
During spring vacation the Babes easi
ly defeated Oakland and Lowell llighs
on March 27 by the score of 90 1-5 to
31 1-5, and Berkeley, Hollistei', and San
Francisco Polytechnic llighs on April
3 by the count of 74 1-4 to 51 1-4.
The babes were handicapped in the
last meet as they had no entries in the
pole vault and the javelin, but managed
to win by an easy margin.
A comparison of times and distances
made by the California first-year men to
those of the Stanford team point to a
close victory for the Cardinal. Even
with the loss of Douglas in the weights
and Roberts in the sprints, who went on
probation. Stanford has a slight edge
on its opponents.
Elliot's performance in the mile and
two-mile events easily surpasses any
thing done by California, and his time
of 4:40 and 11:2 can be cut down con
siderably under stiff competition. Wil
liamson and Thompson have made 52
and 2:06 in the 440 and 880, and Rice
is running the high hurdles in a con
sistent 16 seconds. Howell is jumping
over the six-foot mark at 11 feet in the
pole. With these men as a nucleus the
Stanford team has developed a strong
aggregation under the coaching of Coach
Acker and should come out victors over
the U. C. freshmen next Saturday-
