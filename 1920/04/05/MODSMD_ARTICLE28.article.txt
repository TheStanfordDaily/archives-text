B. Owens, who was appointed associ
ate professor of law; and Miss Catha

Dr. Lutz graduated from Stanford
in 1906 and studied the following
summer at the University of Cali
fornia. He received the degree of
LL.B from the University of Wash
ington in 1907. The next three years
he spent in study at the Universities
of Bonn and Heidelberg, receiving the
degree of A.M. and Ph.D. He con

came an Instructor in History at the
University of Washington in 1915, be
ing promoted to Assistant Professor
in 1916.
When the United States enter the
war he went into the first Officers'
Training Camp in Washington, and re
ceived a commission as second lieuten
ant and was later promoted to a first
lieutenancy. He railed over seas on
August 17, 1918, ■ and in France was
graduated from the Army Intelligence
School at Langres and served with
various headquarter divisions. In
March 1919, he was sent to Berlin on
the American Military Mission. In
August he was assigned to the Su
preme Economic Council in Paris and
was honorably discharged from the
service in September. He was in
Berlin during the Spartacist revolu
tion of last spring and the suceeding
summer.
When Professor E. D. Adams went
t > Europe to gatuer material for the
War History Collection, which is be
ing financed by Herbert Hoover, Lieut.
Lutz tecame his assistant and selected
the first lot of books from Berlin. In
September he wnt through Poland,
Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Austria,
Serbia, and Bulgaria, selecting and
arranging lor the purchase of publi
cations in these countries during the
war, and on his return acted as agent
of the collection in Italy and Swit
zerland. His first-hand knowledge
of the material in these countries and
of that already purchased, will make
him a valuable aid in carrying on the
work of the Hoover War History Col
lections and he will assist in this
work at the University.
Professor Lutz has taught at Stan
ford before, offering courses in the
History Department in 1915 and 1916
during the absence of Professor
Krelibiel.
Owens is a graduate of the Stan
ford Law School and has taught here
before, being an instructor in law in
1915 and 1916. After taking his LL.B.
at Stanford in 1915 he continued his
law studies at the University of Cali
fornia and the University of Chicago
and began practice in Fresno, later
removing to Los Angeles.
In July 1917, he joined the legal
staff of the United States Food Admin
istration and upon the passage of the
Food Control Law, which necessitated
the licensing of food dealers, manu
facturers, millers, and others engaged
in occupations having to do with the
manufacture and distribution of food
products, he was putin charge of
the license division of the Food Ad
ministration. In this capacity he had
to organize and direct the work of
licensing many thousand individuals
and firms, an undertaking requiring
great ability in organization and detail
work. He remained a member of the
law division of the Food Administra
tion while carrying on this separate
work, his chief duties being in connec
tion with the licensing provisions of
the Food Control Act.
He resigned from the Food Admin
istration upon the completion of i.ts
work in February 1919, and re-entered
private practice. Since that time he
has been with the Title Insurance and
Trust Company of Los Angeles, his
work being partly legal and partly ad
ministrative in connection with the
management of properties and ad
ministration of estates. Through his
varied experience in legal practice, as
well as through his special studies he
is particularly qualified to give courses
in California Practice and Commercial
Law, which will be his special pro
vince. The work in California Prac
tice has therefore been given by lec
turers, men in active practice and
who offered no other courses in the
University, but hereafter will be given
by Professor Owens. He assisted in
the California Practice work when he
was a member of the teaching force
in 1915-1916.
Miss Cox is a graduate of the Ger
man Department of Stanford and re
ceived her M.A. here. She spent a
year in Germany studying at various
institutions, has-taught five years at
the College of the Pacific, and has
practically completed her work for the
degree of Ph.D. at Stanford. Miss
Cox is now engaged in relief work in
Germany.

Professor Lutz has taught at Stan
ford before, offering courses in the
History Department in 1915 and 1916
during the absence of Professor
Krelibiel.
Owens is a graduate of the Stan
ford Law School and has taught here
before, being an instructor in law in
1915 and 1916. After taking his LL.B.
at Stanford in 1915 he continued his
law studies at the University of Cali
fornia and the University of Chicago
and began practice in Fresno, later
removing to Los Angeles.
In July 1917, he joined the legal
staff of the United States Food Admin
istration and upon the passage of the
Food Control Law, which necessitated
the licensing of food dealers, manu
facturers, millers, and others engaged
in occupations having to do with the
manufacture and distribution of food
products, he was putin charge of
the license division of the Food Ad
ministration. In this capacity he had
to organize and direct the work of
licensing many thousand individuals
and firms, an undertaking requiring
great ability in organization and detail
work. He remained a member of the
law division of the Food Administra
tion while carrying on this separate
work, his chief duties being in connec
tion with the licensing provisions of
the Food Control Act.
He resigned from the Food Admin
istration upon the completion of i.ts
work in February 1919, and re-entered
private practice. Since that time he
has been with the Title Insurance and
Trust Company of Los Angeles, his
work being partly legal and partly ad
ministrative in connection with the
management of properties and ad
ministration of estates. Through his
varied experience in legal practice, as
well as through his special studies he
is particularly qualified to give courses
in California Practice and Commercial
Law, which will be his special pro
vince. The work in California Prac
tice has therefore been given by lec
turers, men in active practice and
who offered no other courses in the
University, but hereafter will be given
by Professor Owens. He assisted in
the California Practice work when he
was a member of the teaching force
in 1915-1916.
Miss Cox is a graduate of the Ger

institutions, has-taught five years at
the College of the Pacific, and has
practically completed her work for the

Cox is now engaged in relief work in
Germany.
