# NEW DEAN OF MEN RECEIVES FAVORABLE STUDENT COMMENT
## Letters Sent In by Students Who Know Culver Are Enthusiastic 
### 
Several letters have been received by
the Daily Palo Alto which for those
students who have not had the privilege
of knowing George B. Culver, Dean of
Men-elect, will prove interesting as a
side-light on Mr. Culver's personality.
They run as follows:
"For some time past I have been think
ing of an ideal man to fill the important
position of Dean of Men at Stanford;
not because my choice might mean so
much but rather because the success of
the University means a lot to me and
I realize that only a man like George B.
Culver can make a success in that posi
tion.
"There are few men from the south
ern part of the state who do not know
Mr. Culver, either personally or by repu
tation, for he has been the friend of
every man at Los Angeles High School
for many years; and the friend of men
in other high schools as well. In the
ten years I have known him he has al
ways been a booster for Stanford and
was always trying to send some good
track man or football star to the right
college.
"It only remains, now that he is Dean
of Men, for the present student body to
get behind him, both the Hall and the
Row, for truly he will be every man's
friend and with the interests of the stu
dents always in sight.
"R. O. BULLIS, '18."
"Nothing could have given as much
pleasure to those of us who know
George B. Culver as the announcement
that he is to be the next Dean of Men.
No one who has associated with him,
no one who has come under his influence
in any way, can but feel that he is the
man for the position.
"He is one of those quiet enthusiasts,
ever at work without pomp or show, im
parting his enthusiasm to those who are
fortunate enough to come in contact
with him, and he is not alone a teacher,
but a friendâ€”a true friend, such as
are but rarely found. Some of the fond
est recollections of high-school days take
us back to his little office, where a group
of his students would collect, and each
would tell his little joys and sorrows,
seeking his friendly advice. No one
,knew the intimate life of the high school,
or of its students individually; no one
was liked by all. as was Mr. Culver.
"Ever at work for Stanford, he has
directed towards its portals many of the
finest men who have come here. Now
that he himself has come to stay, Stan
ford will find in him a man who can be
a good fellow, as well as a sympathetic
teacher and an intimate friend.
"Raoul M. MAY, '22."
