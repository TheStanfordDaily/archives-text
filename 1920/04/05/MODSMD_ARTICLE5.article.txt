# FRATERNITY WOMEN PRESENT VIEWS ON HOUSING PROBLEMS FOR CONSIDERATION
## Plan Outlined For Dormitory Change for Board Passed By Pan-Hellenic Delegates 
### 
Sorority women of the eampns in a
letter to the Board of Trustees submitted
for their meeting last Friday made
their ideas concerning' the proposed
change in housing for the women of the
University advocating a small-unit sys
tem. The letter was drawn up by a
committee of three authorized by the
presidents of the various living groups
and approved by Pan-Hellenic. The
letter was signed by all of the women's
fraternities and by the committee who
drew up the latter.
Two points are particularly empha
sized concerning the housing system:
(1) That it should be based on a small
unit plan; and (2) that the University
should not undertake any entensive
change until it is in a position finan
cially to meet the small-unit system. The
letter did not contain any defense for
sororities as organizations, but confined
their statements entirely to the housing
problem. The letter reads as follows:
PREAMBLE OPENS LETTER
"We. the fraternity women of Stan
ford University, being keenly interested
in the housing problem of the students
of the University, do hereby present this
report which comes as the result of care
ful investigation and a thoughtful en
deavor to grasp the problem of the wel
fare of Stanford women.
"We believe that in the present system
of housing there are certain obvious de
fects, such as the geographical isolation
of one group from another.
"We believe, however, that in the
present system there are certain inherent
advantages, such as the benefits derived
from the small group.
"We believe, therefore, and urge, that
any contemplated alteration of the pres
ent system should exclude the defects
and include the advantages set forth in
the following report.
"It is our earnest appeal that the
Administration, in order to guarantee the
best possible living conditions for Stan
ford women, should carry out such
plans in the change of housing only to
the extent that those plans preserve the
advantages of the small group; and that
at no time shall the Administration dis
regard these advantages because of scar
city of funds.
"We believe that it would be a grave
injustice to all concerned to uproot the
present stable system until each step of
any comprehensive change can be
financed adequately.
PRESENT SYSTEM'S ADVANTAGES
"In the discussion of a new housing
system for Stanford we believe it is only
fair to consider what advantages there
are inherent in the system as it stands
today.
"Without discussion it may be as
sumed, we suppose, that the inevitable
tendency of any large organization is
to break up into smaller groups.
"This is amply illustrated by the situ
ation at Roble Hall, where, according
to statements made by Hall girls, the j
lines of cleavage arc even clearer be
tween certain non-fraternity groups than
between different fraternity freshmen
living at Roble. The division, then, into
small groups is not an unnatural one,
and if recognized and properly utilized
it becomes a basis of great good. We
believe that in making the small unit a
living group this tendency is best util
ized.
SMALL GROUP BENEFITS
We shall summarize, then, the advan
tages which upon reflection present
themselves to us as belonging to the
small living-group system as contasted
to the large group subdivided into small
social units.
"1. There are certain 'Home' advan
tages. It is not to be contended that
any college environment can or should
completely duplicate home conditions.
Our principal attribute of college life
should be its independence and its de
mand upon personal resourcefulness.
But there are, we believe, certain home
like influences which are essential to the
best development of the college woman.
The family represents an intimate asso
ciation between older and younger per
sons. To a certain extent a parallel is
found in the intimate association be
tween older and younger girls in a living
group. This intimacy in both cases,
arises from the constant daily working
together in a home, and the substitute of
living under conditions regulated from
above, as in a large dormitory, in no
way offers equal advantages. There are,
in the small group, further associations
of a valuable nature with the house
mother (who can personally know 25
girls, where she can not know 250 girls) ;
and between undergraduates and
alumnae.
SOCIAL FACILITIES OUTLINED
"2. There are social facilities in the
small living group which are entirely
absent in the large dormitory. It would
not be fair to use the present Roble Hall
as a criterion in this respect; but even
assuming that there would be added so
cial facilities in further dormitories, a
satisfactory arrangement would be im
possible in a large dormitory. If. as in
the case in the women's houses on the
Row, three or four sitting rooms only
are sufficient, it would follow that in a
dormitory of 250, thirty or forty such
rooms ought to be provided. The ab
surdity of this is evident. And yet we
believe it is not unessential to consider
this point in all seriousness. It is as
sumed that it is always the intention of
those who direct the living conditions in
the University to place every girl in as
congenial surroundings as possible in
which to carry on her college work. A
happy comradeship among the girls
themselves is dependent, to a large ex
tent, on their opportunities to gather to
gether in groups in comfortable and
ample living rooms. The wholesome
ness of their social relations with the
men whom they wish to entertain is also
dependent to some extent on these same
social facilities.
SMALL-GROUP LEADERSHIP
"3. We believe that the individual de
velopment of the college girl is genuine
ly aided by her residence in a small
group. We need not discuss the college
career of tile girl of exceptional quali
ties; she will probably advance herself
under any living conditions; but it is a
point of real importance to consider the
career of the average or backward girl.
There are two influences in a small
group, absent in a large, which encour
age a girl to avail herself of opportuni
ties to actively enter into college life;
one is the element of rivalry between her
groups and others; and the second is
the personal interest in her and encour
agement by her associates which grows
out of the small living group associa
tions. We can not help but feel that in
addition to the more conspicuous quali
ties of leadership and activity which a
small group develops there are personal
qualities which are oftentimes discovered
and developed.
"In this same connection we append a
question of very practical nature. .The
problem of discipline in a large group
is a real one; in a small group it be
comes merely an administrative process.
We state with the approval of the
Chairman of Women's Council (the dis
ciplinary body of the women students),'
who is a non-fraternity girl and a resi
dent of Roble Hall, and with the ap

proval of the president of Roble Hall,
that it is impossible to establish any
normal control over the girls in the Hall
and that the problem of discipline in
the dormitory is a grave one.
"These advantages which, after just
consideration we feel are inherent and
inseparable from the small living group
system, are of such a nature which
should surely not be denied any women
attending Stanford. Furthermore, we
believe that these advantages may be em
bodied in any alteration of the housing
system.
HOUSING WOMEN ON ROW
"In order to remedy the admitted
geographical isolation of a certain pro
portion of the women of the University
and to preserve the advantages of the
small group, two courses present them
selves. First, to move the upperclass
occupants of Roble Hall into small group
houses for the entire body of women
in the vicinity of the present dormitory.
In either case Roble Hall would be pre
served as a freshman or underclass
dormitory.
"Obvious objections to the possibility
of housing all upperclass University
women on the Row are: (1) The scat
tered housing system resulting which, we
believe, would be contrary to the plans
of the Administration for the concen
tration of women's activities; and (2)
the isolation of freshman women from
association with the older women of the
University.
PATIO PLAN
"Hence we believe the most practical
and advantageous solution of this prob
lem rests in the erection of small group
housing units around Roble Hall, where
would be housed all the women of the
University with the exception of the
first-year students, who would be housed
in Roble Hall in compliance with the |
University ruling.
"The following is, in general, the plan
drawn up and approved by the fraternity
women of Stanford for the housing of
women students:
"1. That the University purchase the
houses now owned and occupied by local
chapters of national fraternities. These
houses could be converted into additional
men's dormitories to relieve the con
gestion in Encina Hall.
' ' "2. That the University permit the
fraternity women to build, according to
plans uniform in nature, designated by
the Administration, houses for their ac
commodation near Roble Hall; or that
"3. The University build these houses
to be rented from the University by
the fraternity chapters as a group; or
that rooms in these houses be rented to
individuals of the fraternity chapter.
M 4. That the University build similar
houses in the same locality for non-fra
ternity women, the same to be rented
from the University in accordance with
the present system of room rental at
Roble Hall.
ALTERATION OF ROBLE
"We offer the following suggestions
of alteration of the present Roble Hall.
"Roble Hall as it now stands is an
admitted failure. Women residents of
the Hall will substantiate its defects:
(1) Lack of advantages of the small
group enumerated above; (2) inade
quate social facilities; (3) inadequate
ventilation of the bedrooms by one win
dow, and the unsanitary, undesirability
of a stationary washstand in a sleeping
room.
"It is our earnest appeal that the Uni
versity remedy, in so far as it is able,
these defects in the Hall and make every
effort to avoid duplication of these de
fects in any further University dormi
tories.
"We suggest that the size of Roble
be cut down from 210 women to 150
women, which ho subdivided into smaller
groups of 75 by the use of additional
partitions. We suggest that the present
dining rooms be maintained and that
further reception rooms, libraries, and
study rooms be provided on the main
floor.
"The above plan provides for the
maintenance of separate kitchens and
dining rooms in the small group houses
with the assumption that University
wholesale buying and a common heating
system, for which there is pressing need
even in the present housing system,
would be a feature of such a housing
system.
"Should, however, the maintenance of
j separate dining rooms prove, on closer
investigation, to be uneconomical, we
I suggest a variation of the plan, which,
we believe, would maintain any possi
bility of economic loss. This variation
we will call the Patio Plan.
"We suggest that with the present
Roble Hall as one side of a tentative
square, that semi-detached houses ac
commodating from 15 to 20 women with
sleeping rooms and living rooms but
without dining quarters be built in the
form of an open square. This, we be
lieve, would result in a housing group
of compactness and in it could lie pre
served the architectural harmony of the
University buildings. Rooms in these
semi-detached houses would be rented
from the University by the women occu
pying them. However, we believe, that
in the formation of the groups that non
fraternity women as well as members of
fraternities should be allowed to build
up their living groups by choice.
"Under the Patio Plan we suggest that
the University provide eating commons
for the women residents of the small
group units accommodating approxi
mately 75 women each. Such eating
commons would offer an opportunity for
the women to meet three times a day
under no restrictions of membership in
any particular living group.
WQMEN APPROVE PLAN
"This, in brief, is the substance of the
housing plan approved by approximately
250 University- women who have ' iff-' 1

joyed the benefits of the small living
group and wish those advantages per
petuated and extended in any alteration
of the system to the entire body of
women students at Stanford.
"We lay this matter before you and
earnestly appeal for your consideration.

proval of the president of Roble Hall,
that it is impossible to establish any
normal control over the girls in the Hall
and that the problem of discipline in
the dormitory is a grave one.
"These advantages which, after just
consideration we feel are inherent and
inseparable from the small living group
system, are of such a nature which
should surely not be denied any women
attending Stanford. Furthermore, we
believe that these advantages may be em

system.
HOUSING WOMEN ON ROW
"In order to remedy the admitted
geographical isolation of a certain pro
portion of the women of the University
and to preserve the advantages of the
small group, two courses present them
selves. First, to move the upperclass
occupants of Roble Hall into small group
houses for the entire body of women
in the vicinity of the present dormitory.
In either case Roble Hall would be pre
served as a freshman or underclass
dormitory.
"Obvious objections to the possibility
of housing all upperclass University
women on the Row are: (1) The scat
tered housing system resulting which, we
believe, would be contrary to the plans
of the Administration for the concen
tration of women's activities; and (2)
the isolation of freshman women from
association with the older women of the
University.
PATIO PLAN
"Hence we believe the most practical
and advantageous solution of this prob
lem rests in the erection of small group
housing units around Roble Hall, where
would be housed all the women of the
University with the exception of the
first-year students, who would be housed
in Roble Hall in compliance with the |
University ruling.
"The following is, in general, the plan
drawn up and approved by the fraternity
women of Stanford for the housing of
women students:
"1. That the University purchase the
houses now owned and occupied by local
chapters of national fraternities. These
houses could be converted into additional
men's dormitories to relieve the con
gestion in Encina Hall.
' ' "2. That the University permit the
fraternity women to build, according to
plans uniform in nature, designated by
the Administration, houses for their ac
commodation near Roble Hall; or that
"3. The University build these houses
to be rented from the University by
the fraternity chapters as a group; or
that rooms in these houses be rented to
individuals of the fraternity chapter.
M 4. That the University build similar
houses in the same locality for non-fra
ternity women, the same to be rented
from the University in accordance with
the present system of room rental at
Roble Hall.
ALTERATION OF ROBLE
"We offer the following suggestions
of alteration of the present Roble Hall.
"Roble Hall as it now stands is an
admitted failure. Women residents of
the Hall will substantiate its defects:
(1) Lack of advantages of the small
group enumerated above; (2) inade
quate social facilities; (3) inadequate
ventilation of the bedrooms by one win
dow, and the unsanitary, undesirability
of a stationary washstand in a sleeping
room.
"It is our earnest appeal that the Uni
versity remedy, in so far as it is able,
these defects in the Hall and make every
effort to avoid duplication of these de
fects in any further University dormi
tories.
"We suggest that the size of Roble
be cut down from 210 women to 150
women, which ho subdivided into smaller
groups of 75 by the use of additional
partitions. We suggest that the present
dining rooms be maintained and that
further reception rooms, libraries, and
study rooms be provided on the main
floor.
"The above plan provides for the
maintenance of separate kitchens and
dining rooms in the small group houses
with the assumption that University
wholesale buying and a common heating
system, for which there is pressing need
even in the present housing system,
would be a feature of such a housing
system.
"Should, however, the maintenance of
j separate dining rooms prove, on closer
investigation, to be uneconomical, we
I suggest a variation of the plan, which,
we believe, would maintain any possi
bility of economic loss. This variation
we will call the Patio Plan.
"We suggest that with the present
Roble Hall as one side of a tentative
square, that semi-detached houses ac
commodating from 15 to 20 women with
sleeping rooms and living rooms but
without dining quarters be built in the
form of an open square. This, we be
lieve, would result in a housing group
of compactness and in it could lie pre
served the architectural harmony of the
University buildings. Rooms in these
semi-detached houses would be rented
from the University by the women occu
pying them. However, we believe, that
in the formation of the groups that non
fraternity women as well as members of
fraternities should be allowed to build
up their living groups by choice.
"Under the Patio Plan we suggest that
the University provide eating commons
for the women residents of the small
group units accommodating approxi
mately 75 women each. Such eating
commons would offer an opportunity for
the women to meet three times a day
under no restrictions of membership in
any particular living group.

Sorority women of the eampns in a
letter to the Board of Trustees submitted
for their meeting last Friday made
their ideas concerning' the proposed
change in housing for the women of the
University advocating a small-unit sys

committee of three authorized by the
presidents of the various living groups
and approved by Pan-Hellenic. The
letter was signed by all of the women's
fraternities and by the committee who
drew up the latter.
Two points are particularly empha
sized concerning the housing system:
(1) That it should be based on a small
unit plan; and (2) that the University
should not undertake any entensive
change until it is in a position finan
cially to meet the small-unit system. The
letter did not contain any defense for
sororities as organizations, but confined
their statements entirely to the housing
problem. The letter reads as follows:
PREAMBLE OPENS LETTER
"We. the fraternity women of Stan
ford University, being keenly interested
in the housing problem of the students
of the University, do hereby present this
report which comes as the result of care
ful investigation and a thoughtful en
deavor to grasp the problem of the wel
fare of Stanford women.
"We believe that in the present system
of housing there are certain obvious de
fects, such as the geographical isolation
of one group from another.
"We believe, however, that in the
present system there are certain inherent
advantages, such as the benefits derived
from the small group.
"We believe, therefore, and urge, that
any contemplated alteration of the pres
ent system should exclude the defects
and include the advantages set forth in
the following report.
"It is our earnest appeal that the
Administration, in order to guarantee the
best possible living conditions for Stan
ford women, should carry out such
plans in the change of housing only to
the extent that those plans preserve the
advantages of the small group; and that
at no time shall the Administration dis
regard these advantages because of scar
city of funds.
"We believe that it would be a grave
injustice to all concerned to uproot the
present stable system until each step of
any comprehensive change can be
financed adequately.
PRESENT SYSTEM'S ADVANTAGES
"In the discussion of a new housing
system for Stanford we believe it is only
fair to consider what advantages there
are inherent in the system as it stands
today.
"Without discussion it may be as
sumed, we suppose, that the inevitable
tendency of any large organization is
to break up into smaller groups.
"This is amply illustrated by the situ
ation at Roble Hall, where, according
to statements made by Hall girls, the j
lines of cleavage arc even clearer be
tween certain non-fraternity groups than
between different fraternity freshmen
living at Roble. The division, then, into
small groups is not an unnatural one,
and if recognized and properly utilized
it becomes a basis of great good. We
believe that in making the small unit a
living group this tendency is best util
ized.
SMALL GROUP BENEFITS
We shall summarize, then, the advan
tages which upon reflection present
themselves to us as belonging to the
small living-group system as contasted
to the large group subdivided into small
social units.
"1. There are certain 'Home' advan
tages. It is not to be contended that
any college environment can or should
completely duplicate home conditions.
Our principal attribute of college life
should be its independence and its de
mand upon personal resourcefulness.
But there are, we believe, certain home
like influences which are essential to the
best development of the college woman.
The family represents an intimate asso
ciation between older and younger per
sons. To a certain extent a parallel is
found in the intimate association be
tween older and younger girls in a living
group. This intimacy in both cases,
arises from the constant daily working
together in a home, and the substitute of
living under conditions regulated from
above, as in a large dormitory, in no
way offers equal advantages. There are,
in the small group, further associations
of a valuable nature with the house
mother (who can personally know 25
girls, where she can not know 250 girls) ;
and between undergraduates and
alumnae.
SOCIAL FACILITIES OUTLINED
"2. There are social facilities in the
small living group which are entirely
absent in the large dormitory. It would
not be fair to use the present Roble Hall
as a criterion in this respect; but even
assuming that there would be added so
cial facilities in further dormitories, a
satisfactory arrangement would be im
possible in a large dormitory. If. as in
the case in the women's houses on the
Row, three or four sitting rooms only
are sufficient, it would follow that in a
dormitory of 250, thirty or forty such
rooms ought to be provided. The ab
surdity of this is evident. And yet we
believe it is not unessential to consider
this point in all seriousness. It is as
sumed that it is always the intention of
those who direct the living conditions in
the University to place every girl in as
congenial surroundings as possible in
which to carry on her college work. A
happy comradeship among the girls
themselves is dependent, to a large ex
tent, on their opportunities to gather to
gether in groups in comfortable and
ample living rooms. The wholesome
ness of their social relations with the
men whom they wish to entertain is also
dependent to some extent on these same
social facilities.
SMALL-GROUP LEADERSHIP
"3. We believe that the individual de
velopment of the college girl is genuine
ly aided by her residence in a small
group. We need not discuss the college
career of tile girl of exceptional quali
ties; she will probably advance herself
under any living conditions; but it is a
point of real importance to consider the
career of the average or backward girl.
There are two influences in a small
group, absent in a large, which encour
age a girl to avail herself of opportuni
ties to actively enter into college life;
one is the element of rivalry between her
groups and others; and the second is
the personal interest in her and encour
agement by her associates which grows
out of the small living group associa
tions. We can not help but feel that in
addition to the more conspicuous quali
ties of leadership and activity which a
small group develops there are personal
qualities which are oftentimes discovered
and developed.
"In this same connection we append a
question of very practical nature. .The
problem of discipline in a large group
is a real one; in a small group it be
comes merely an administrative process.
We state with the approval of the
Chairman of Women's Council (the dis
ciplinary body of the women students),'
who is a non-fraternity girl and a resi
dent of Roble Hall, and with the ap

proval of the president of Roble Hall,
that it is impossible to establish any
normal control over the girls in the Hall
and that the problem of discipline in
the dormitory is a grave one.
"These advantages which, after just
consideration we feel are inherent and
inseparable from the small living group
system, are of such a nature which
should surely not be denied any women
attending Stanford. Furthermore, we
believe that these advantages may be em
bodied in any alteration of the housing
system.

of the University, do hereby present this
report which comes as the result of care
ful investigation and a thoughtful en
deavor to grasp the problem of the wel
fare of Stanford women.
"We believe that in the present system
of housing there are certain obvious de
fects, such as the geographical isolation
of one group from another.
"We believe, however, that in the
present system there are certain inherent
advantages, such as the benefits derived
from the small group.
"We believe, therefore, and urge, that
any contemplated alteration of the pres
ent system should exclude the defects
and include the advantages set forth in
the following report.
"It is our earnest appeal that the
Administration, in order to guarantee the
best possible living conditions for Stan
ford women, should carry out such
plans in the change of housing only to
the extent that those plans preserve the
advantages of the small group; and that
at no time shall the Administration dis
regard these advantages because of scar
city of funds.
"We believe that it would be a grave
injustice to all concerned to uproot the
present stable system until each step of
any comprehensive change can be
financed adequately.
PRESENT SYSTEM'S ADVANTAGES
"In the discussion of a new housing
system for Stanford we believe it is only
fair to consider what advantages there
are inherent in the system as it stands
today.
"Without discussion it may be as
sumed, we suppose, that the inevitable
tendency of any large organization is
to break up into smaller groups.
"This is amply illustrated by the situ
ation at Roble Hall, where, according
to statements made by Hall girls, the j
lines of cleavage arc even clearer be
tween certain non-fraternity groups than
between different fraternity freshmen
living at Roble. The division, then, into
small groups is not an unnatural one,
and if recognized and properly utilized
it becomes a basis of great good. We
believe that in making the small unit a
living group this tendency is best util
ized.
SMALL GROUP BENEFITS
We shall summarize, then, the advan
tages which upon reflection present
themselves to us as belonging to the
small living-group system as contasted
to the large group subdivided into small
social units.
"1. There are certain 'Home' advan
tages. It is not to be contended that
any college environment can or should
completely duplicate home conditions.
Our principal attribute of college life
should be its independence and its de
mand upon personal resourcefulness.
But there are, we believe, certain home
like influences which are essential to the
best development of the college woman.
The family represents an intimate asso
ciation between older and younger per
sons. To a certain extent a parallel is
found in the intimate association be
tween older and younger girls in a living
group. This intimacy in both cases,
arises from the constant daily working
together in a home, and the substitute of
living under conditions regulated from
above, as in a large dormitory, in no
way offers equal advantages. There are,
in the small group, further associations
of a valuable nature with the house
mother (who can personally know 25
girls, where she can not know 250 girls) ;
and between undergraduates and
alumnae.
SOCIAL FACILITIES OUTLINED
"2. There are social facilities in the
small living group which are entirely
absent in the large dormitory. It would
not be fair to use the present Roble Hall
as a criterion in this respect; but even
assuming that there would be added so
cial facilities in further dormitories, a
satisfactory arrangement would be im
possible in a large dormitory. If. as in
the case in the women's houses on the
Row, three or four sitting rooms only
are sufficient, it would follow that in a
dormitory of 250, thirty or forty such
rooms ought to be provided. The ab
surdity of this is evident. And yet we
believe it is not unessential to consider
this point in all seriousness. It is as
sumed that it is always the intention of
those who direct the living conditions in
the University to place every girl in as
congenial surroundings as possible in
which to carry on her college work. A
happy comradeship among the girls
themselves is dependent, to a large ex
tent, on their opportunities to gather to
gether in groups in comfortable and
ample living rooms. The wholesome
ness of their social relations with the
men whom they wish to entertain is also
dependent to some extent on these same
social facilities.
SMALL-GROUP LEADERSHIP
"3. We believe that the individual de
velopment of the college girl is genuine
ly aided by her residence in a small
group. We need not discuss the college
career of tile girl of exceptional quali
ties; she will probably advance herself
under any living conditions; but it is a
point of real importance to consider the
career of the average or backward girl.
There are two influences in a small
group, absent in a large, which encour
age a girl to avail herself of opportuni
ties to actively enter into college life;
one is the element of rivalry between her
groups and others; and the second is
the personal interest in her and encour
agement by her associates which grows
out of the small living group associa
tions. We can not help but feel that in
addition to the more conspicuous quali
ties of leadership and activity which a
small group develops there are personal
qualities which are oftentimes discovered
and developed.
"In this same connection we append a
question of very practical nature. .The
problem of discipline in a large group
is a real one; in a small group it be
comes merely an administrative process.
We state with the approval of the
Chairman of Women's Council (the dis
ciplinary body of the women students),'
who is a non-fraternity girl and a resi
dent of Roble Hall, and with the ap

proval of the president of Roble Hall,
that it is impossible to establish any
normal control over the girls in the Hall
and that the problem of discipline in
the dormitory is a grave one.
"These advantages which, after just
consideration we feel are inherent and
inseparable from the small living group
system, are of such a nature which
should surely not be denied any women
attending Stanford. Furthermore, we
believe that these advantages may be em
bodied in any alteration of the housing
system.
HOUSING WOMEN ON ROW
"In order to remedy the admitted
geographical isolation of a certain pro
portion of the women of the University
and to preserve the advantages of the
small group, two courses present them
selves. First, to move the upperclass
occupants of Roble Hall into small group
houses for the entire body of women
in the vicinity of the present dormitory.
In either case Roble Hall would be pre
served as a freshman or underclass
dormitory.
"Obvious objections to the possibility
of housing all upperclass University
women on the Row are: (1) The scat
tered housing system resulting which, we
believe, would be contrary to the plans
of the Administration for the concen
tration of women's activities; and (2)
the isolation of freshman women from
association with the older women of the
University.
PATIO PLAN
"Hence we believe the most practical
and advantageous solution of this prob
lem rests in the erection of small group
housing units around Roble Hall, where
would be housed all the women of the
University with the exception of the
first-year students, who would be housed
in Roble Hall in compliance with the |
University ruling.
"The following is, in general, the plan
drawn up and approved by the fraternity
women of Stanford for the housing of
women students:
"1. That the University purchase the
houses now owned and occupied by local
chapters of national fraternities. These
houses could be converted into additional
men's dormitories to relieve the con
gestion in Encina Hall.
' ' "2. That the University permit the
fraternity women to build, according to
plans uniform in nature, designated by
the Administration, houses for their ac
commodation near Roble Hall; or that
"3. The University build these houses
to be rented from the University by
the fraternity chapters as a group; or
that rooms in these houses be rented to
individuals of the fraternity chapter.
M 4. That the University build similar
houses in the same locality for non-fra
ternity women, the same to be rented
from the University in accordance with
the present system of room rental at
Roble Hall.
ALTERATION OF ROBLE
"We offer the following suggestions
of alteration of the present Roble Hall.
"Roble Hall as it now stands is an
admitted failure. Women residents of
the Hall will substantiate its defects:
(1) Lack of advantages of the small
group enumerated above; (2) inade
quate social facilities; (3) inadequate
ventilation of the bedrooms by one win
dow, and the unsanitary, undesirability
of a stationary washstand in a sleeping
room.
"It is our earnest appeal that the Uni
versity remedy, in so far as it is able,
these defects in the Hall and make every
effort to avoid duplication of these de
fects in any further University dormi
tories.
"We suggest that the size of Roble
be cut down from 210 women to 150
women, which ho subdivided into smaller
groups of 75 by the use of additional
partitions. We suggest that the present
dining rooms be maintained and that
further reception rooms, libraries, and
study rooms be provided on the main
floor.
"The above plan provides for the
maintenance of separate kitchens and
dining rooms in the small group houses
with the assumption that University
wholesale buying and a common heating
system, for which there is pressing need
even in the present housing system,
would be a feature of such a housing
system.
"Should, however, the maintenance of
j separate dining rooms prove, on closer
investigation, to be uneconomical, we
I suggest a variation of the plan, which,
we believe, would maintain any possi
bility of economic loss. This variation
we will call the Patio Plan.
"We suggest that with the present
Roble Hall as one side of a tentative
square, that semi-detached houses ac
commodating from 15 to 20 women with
sleeping rooms and living rooms but
without dining quarters be built in the
form of an open square. This, we be
lieve, would result in a housing group
of compactness and in it could lie pre
served the architectural harmony of the
University buildings. Rooms in these
semi-detached houses would be rented
from the University by the women occu
pying them. However, we believe, that
in the formation of the groups that non
fraternity women as well as members of
fraternities should be allowed to build
up their living groups by choice.
"Under the Patio Plan we suggest that
the University provide eating commons
for the women residents of the small
group units accommodating approxi
mately 75 women each. Such eating
commons would offer an opportunity for
the women to meet three times a day
under no restrictions of membership in
any particular living group.
WQMEN APPROVE PLAN
"This, in brief, is the substance of the
housing plan approved by approximately
250 University- women who have ' iff-' 1

joyed the benefits of the small living
group and wish those advantages per
petuated and extended in any alteration
of the system to the entire body of
women students at Stanford.
"We lay this matter before you and
earnestly appeal for your consideration.
"Very truly yours,
"The Inter-Sorority

"Ellen Calhoun."
Sorority women of the eampns in a
letter to the Board of Trustees submitted
for their meeting last Friday made
their ideas concerning' the proposed
change in housing for the women of the
University advocating a small-unit sys
tem. The letter was drawn up by a
committee of three authorized by the
presidents of the various living groups
and approved by Pan-Hellenic. The
letter was signed by all of the women's
fraternities and by the committee who
drew up the latter.
Two points are particularly empha
sized concerning the housing system:
(1) That it should be based on a small
unit plan; and (2) that the University
should not undertake any entensive
change until it is in a position finan
cially to meet the small-unit system. The
letter did not contain any defense for
sororities as organizations, but confined
their statements entirely to the housing
problem. The letter reads as follows:

of the Administration for the concen
tration of women's activities; and (2)
the isolation of freshman women from
association with the older women of the
University.
PATIO PLAN
"Hence we believe the most practical
and advantageous solution of this prob
lem rests in the erection of small group
housing units around Roble Hall, where
would be housed all the women of the
University with the exception of the
first-year students, who would be housed
in Roble Hall in compliance with the |
University ruling.
"The following is, in general, the plan
drawn up and approved by the fraternity
women of Stanford for the housing of
women students:
"1. That the University purchase the
houses now owned and occupied by local
chapters of national fraternities. These
houses could be converted into additional
men's dormitories to relieve the con
gestion in Encina Hall.
' ' "2. That the University permit the
fraternity women to build, according to
plans uniform in nature, designated by
the Administration, houses for their ac
commodation near Roble Hall; or that
"3. The University build these houses
to be rented from the University by
the fraternity chapters as a group; or
that rooms in these houses be rented to
individuals of the fraternity chapter.
M 4. That the University build similar
houses in the same locality for non-fra
ternity women, the same to be rented
from the University in accordance with
the present system of room rental at
Roble Hall.
ALTERATION OF ROBLE
"We offer the following suggestions
of alteration of the present Roble Hall.
"Roble Hall as it now stands is an
admitted failure. Women residents of
the Hall will substantiate its defects:
(1) Lack of advantages of the small
group enumerated above; (2) inade
quate social facilities; (3) inadequate
ventilation of the bedrooms by one win
dow, and the unsanitary, undesirability
of a stationary washstand in a sleeping
room.
"It is our earnest appeal that the Uni
versity remedy, in so far as it is able,
these defects in the Hall and make every
effort to avoid duplication of these de
fects in any further University dormi
tories.
"We suggest that the size of Roble
be cut down from 210 women to 150
women, which ho subdivided into smaller
groups of 75 by the use of additional
partitions. We suggest that the present
dining rooms be maintained and that
further reception rooms, libraries, and
study rooms be provided on the main
floor.
"The above plan provides for the
maintenance of separate kitchens and
dining rooms in the small group houses
with the assumption that University
wholesale buying and a common heating
system, for which there is pressing need
even in the present housing system,
would be a feature of such a housing
system.
"Should, however, the maintenance of
j separate dining rooms prove, on closer
investigation, to be uneconomical, we
I suggest a variation of the plan, which,
we believe, would maintain any possi
bility of economic loss. This variation
we will call the Patio Plan.
"We suggest that with the present
Roble Hall as one side of a tentative
square, that semi-detached houses ac
commodating from 15 to 20 women with
sleeping rooms and living rooms but
without dining quarters be built in the
form of an open square. This, we be
lieve, would result in a housing group
of compactness and in it could lie pre
served the architectural harmony of the
University buildings. Rooms in these
semi-detached houses would be rented
from the University by the women occu
pying them. However, we believe, that
in the formation of the groups that non
fraternity women as well as members of
fraternities should be allowed to build
up their living groups by choice.
"Under the Patio Plan we suggest that
the University provide eating commons
for the women residents of the small
group units accommodating approxi
mately 75 women each. Such eating
commons would offer an opportunity for
the women to meet three times a day
under no restrictions of membership in
any particular living group.

Sorority women of the eampns in a

for their meeting last Friday made
their ideas concerning' the proposed
change in housing for the women of the

committee of three authorized by the
presidents of the various living groups
and approved by Pan-Hellenic. The
letter was signed by all of the women's
fraternities and by the committee who
drew up the latter.
Two points are particularly empha
sized concerning the housing system:
(1) That it should be based on a small
unit plan; and (2) that the University
should not undertake any entensive
change until it is in a position finan
cially to meet the small-unit system. The
letter did not contain any defense for
sororities as organizations, but confined
their statements entirely to the housing
problem. The letter reads as follows:
PREAMBLE OPENS LETTER
"We. the fraternity women of Stan
ford University, being keenly interested
in the housing problem of the students
of the University, do hereby present this
report which comes as the result of care
ful investigation and a thoughtful en
deavor to grasp the problem of the wel
fare of Stanford women.
"We believe that in the present system
of housing there are certain obvious de
fects, such as the geographical isolation
of one group from another.
"We believe, however, that in the
present system there are certain inherent
advantages, such as the benefits derived
from the small group.
"We believe, therefore, and urge, that
any contemplated alteration of the pres
ent system should exclude the defects
and include the advantages set forth in
the following report.
"It is our earnest appeal that the
Administration, in order to guarantee the
best possible living conditions for Stan
ford women, should carry out such
plans in the change of housing only to
the extent that those plans preserve the
advantages of the small group; and that
at no time shall the Administration dis
regard these advantages because of scar
city of funds.
"We believe that it would be a grave
injustice to all concerned to uproot the
present stable system until each step of
any comprehensive change can be
financed adequately.
PRESENT SYSTEM'S ADVANTAGES
"In the discussion of a new housing
system for Stanford we believe it is only
fair to consider what advantages there
are inherent in the system as it stands
today.
"Without discussion it may be as
sumed, we suppose, that the inevitable
tendency of any large organization is
to break up into smaller groups.
"This is amply illustrated by the situ
ation at Roble Hall, where, according
to statements made by Hall girls, the j
lines of cleavage arc even clearer be
tween certain non-fraternity groups than
between different fraternity freshmen
living at Roble. The division, then, into
small groups is not an unnatural one,
and if recognized and properly utilized
it becomes a basis of great good. We
believe that in making the small unit a
living group this tendency is best util
ized.
SMALL GROUP BENEFITS
We shall summarize, then, the advan
tages which upon reflection present
themselves to us as belonging to the
small living-group system as contasted
to the large group subdivided into small
social units.
"1. There are certain 'Home' advan
tages. It is not to be contended that
any college environment can or should
completely duplicate home conditions.
Our principal attribute of college life
should be its independence and its de
mand upon personal resourcefulness.
But there are, we believe, certain home
like influences which are essential to the
best development of the college woman.
The family represents an intimate asso
ciation between older and younger per
sons. To a certain extent a parallel is
found in the intimate association be
tween older and younger girls in a living
group. This intimacy in both cases,
arises from the constant daily working
together in a home, and the substitute of
living under conditions regulated from
above, as in a large dormitory, in no
way offers equal advantages. There are,
in the small group, further associations
of a valuable nature with the house
mother (who can personally know 25
girls, where she can not know 250 girls) ;
and between undergraduates and
alumnae.
SOCIAL FACILITIES OUTLINED
"2. There are social facilities in the
small living group which are entirely
absent in the large dormitory. It would
not be fair to use the present Roble Hall
as a criterion in this respect; but even
assuming that there would be added so
cial facilities in further dormitories, a
satisfactory arrangement would be im
possible in a large dormitory. If. as in
the case in the women's houses on the
Row, three or four sitting rooms only
are sufficient, it would follow that in a
dormitory of 250, thirty or forty such
rooms ought to be provided. The ab
surdity of this is evident. And yet we
believe it is not unessential to consider
this point in all seriousness. It is as
sumed that it is always the intention of
those who direct the living conditions in
the University to place every girl in as
congenial surroundings as possible in
which to carry on her college work. A
happy comradeship among the girls
themselves is dependent, to a large ex
tent, on their opportunities to gather to
gether in groups in comfortable and
ample living rooms. The wholesome
ness of their social relations with the
men whom they wish to entertain is also
dependent to some extent on these same
social facilities.
SMALL-GROUP LEADERSHIP
"3. We believe that the individual de
velopment of the college girl is genuine
ly aided by her residence in a small
group. We need not discuss the college
career of tile girl of exceptional quali
ties; she will probably advance herself
under any living conditions; but it is a
point of real importance to consider the
career of the average or backward girl.
There are two influences in a small
group, absent in a large, which encour
age a girl to avail herself of opportuni
ties to actively enter into college life;
one is the element of rivalry between her
groups and others; and the second is
the personal interest in her and encour
agement by her associates which grows
out of the small living group associa
tions. We can not help but feel that in
addition to the more conspicuous quali
ties of leadership and activity which a
small group develops there are personal
qualities which are oftentimes discovered
and developed.
"In this same connection we append a
question of very practical nature. .The
problem of discipline in a large group
is a real one; in a small group it be
comes merely an administrative process.
We state with the approval of the
Chairman of Women's Council (the dis
ciplinary body of the women students),'
who is a non-fraternity girl and a resi
dent of Roble Hall, and with the ap

proval of the president of Roble Hall,
that it is impossible to establish any
normal control over the girls in the Hall
and that the problem of discipline in
the dormitory is a grave one.
"These advantages which, after just
consideration we feel are inherent and
inseparable from the small living group
system, are of such a nature which
should surely not be denied any women
attending Stanford. Furthermore, we
believe that these advantages may be em
bodied in any alteration of the housing
system.
HOUSING WOMEN ON ROW
"In order to remedy the admitted
geographical isolation of a certain pro
portion of the women of the University
and to preserve the advantages of the
small group, two courses present them
selves. First, to move the upperclass
occupants of Roble Hall into small group
houses for the entire body of women
in the vicinity of the present dormitory.
In either case Roble Hall would be pre
served as a freshman or underclass
dormitory.
"Obvious objections to the possibility
of housing all upperclass University
women on the Row are: (1) The scat
tered housing system resulting which, we
believe, would be contrary to the plans
of the Administration for the concen
tration of women's activities; and (2)
the isolation of freshman women from
association with the older women of the
University.
PATIO PLAN
"Hence we believe the most practical
and advantageous solution of this prob

housing units around Roble Hall, where
would be housed all the women of the

PRESENT SYSTEM'S ADVANTAGES
"In the discussion of a new housing
system for Stanford we believe it is only
fair to consider what advantages there
are inherent in the system as it stands
today.
"Without discussion it may be as
sumed, we suppose, that the inevitable
tendency of any large organization is
to break up into smaller groups.
"This is amply illustrated by the situ
ation at Roble Hall, where, according
to statements made by Hall girls, the j
lines of cleavage arc even clearer be
tween certain non-fraternity groups than
between different fraternity freshmen
living at Roble. The division, then, into
small groups is not an unnatural one,
and if recognized and properly utilized
it becomes a basis of great good. We
believe that in making the small unit a
living group this tendency is best util
ized.
SMALL GROUP BENEFITS
We shall summarize, then, the advan
tages which upon reflection present
themselves to us as belonging to the
small living-group system as contasted
to the large group subdivided into small
social units.
"1. There are certain 'Home' advan
tages. It is not to be contended that
any college environment can or should
completely duplicate home conditions.
Our principal attribute of college life
should be its independence and its de
mand upon personal resourcefulness.
But there are, we believe, certain home
like influences which are essential to the
best development of the college woman.
The family represents an intimate asso
ciation between older and younger per
sons. To a certain extent a parallel is
found in the intimate association be
tween older and younger girls in a living
group. This intimacy in both cases,
arises from the constant daily working
together in a home, and the substitute of
living under conditions regulated from
above, as in a large dormitory, in no
way offers equal advantages. There are,
in the small group, further associations
of a valuable nature with the house
mother (who can personally know 25
girls, where she can not know 250 girls) ;
and between undergraduates and
alumnae.
SOCIAL FACILITIES OUTLINED
"2. There are social facilities in the
small living group which are entirely
absent in the large dormitory. It would
not be fair to use the present Roble Hall
as a criterion in this respect; but even
assuming that there would be added so
cial facilities in further dormitories, a
satisfactory arrangement would be im
possible in a large dormitory. If. as in
the case in the women's houses on the
Row, three or four sitting rooms only
are sufficient, it would follow that in a
dormitory of 250, thirty or forty such
rooms ought to be provided. The ab
surdity of this is evident. And yet we
believe it is not unessential to consider
this point in all seriousness. It is as
sumed that it is always the intention of
those who direct the living conditions in
the University to place every girl in as
congenial surroundings as possible in
which to carry on her college work. A
happy comradeship among the girls
themselves is dependent, to a large ex
tent, on their opportunities to gather to
gether in groups in comfortable and
ample living rooms. The wholesome
ness of their social relations with the
men whom they wish to entertain is also
dependent to some extent on these same
social facilities.
SMALL-GROUP LEADERSHIP
"3. We believe that the individual de
velopment of the college girl is genuine
ly aided by her residence in a small
group. We need not discuss the college
career of tile girl of exceptional quali
ties; she will probably advance herself
under any living conditions; but it is a
point of real importance to consider the
career of the average or backward girl.
There are two influences in a small
group, absent in a large, which encour
age a girl to avail herself of opportuni
ties to actively enter into college life;
one is the element of rivalry between her
groups and others; and the second is
the personal interest in her and encour
agement by her associates which grows
out of the small living group associa
tions. We can not help but feel that in
addition to the more conspicuous quali
ties of leadership and activity which a
small group develops there are personal
qualities which are oftentimes discovered
and developed.
"In this same connection we append a
question of very practical nature. .The
problem of discipline in a large group
is a real one; in a small group it be
comes merely an administrative process.
We state with the approval of the
Chairman of Women's Council (the dis
ciplinary body of the women students),'
who is a non-fraternity girl and a resi
dent of Roble Hall, and with the ap

proval of the president of Roble Hall,
that it is impossible to establish any
normal control over the girls in the Hall
and that the problem of discipline in
the dormitory is a grave one.
"These advantages which, after just
consideration we feel are inherent and
inseparable from the small living group
system, are of such a nature which
should surely not be denied any women
attending Stanford. Furthermore, we
believe that these advantages may be em
bodied in any alteration of the housing
system.
HOUSING WOMEN ON ROW
"In order to remedy the admitted
geographical isolation of a certain pro
portion of the women of the University
and to preserve the advantages of the
small group, two courses present them
selves. First, to move the upperclass
occupants of Roble Hall into small group
houses for the entire body of women
in the vicinity of the present dormitory.
In either case Roble Hall would be pre
served as a freshman or underclass
dormitory.
"Obvious objections to the possibility
of housing all upperclass University
women on the Row are: (1) The scat
tered housing system resulting which, we
believe, would be contrary to the plans
of the Administration for the concen
tration of women's activities; and (2)
the isolation of freshman women from
association with the older women of the
University.
PATIO PLAN
"Hence we believe the most practical
and advantageous solution of this prob
lem rests in the erection of small group
housing units around Roble Hall, where
would be housed all the women of the
University with the exception of the
first-year students, who would be housed
in Roble Hall in compliance with the |
University ruling.
"The following is, in general, the plan
drawn up and approved by the fraternity
women of Stanford for the housing of
women students:
"1. That the University purchase the
houses now owned and occupied by local
chapters of national fraternities. These
houses could be converted into additional
men's dormitories to relieve the con
gestion in Encina Hall.
' ' "2. That the University permit the
fraternity women to build, according to
plans uniform in nature, designated by
the Administration, houses for their ac
commodation near Roble Hall; or that
"3. The University build these houses
to be rented from the University by
the fraternity chapters as a group; or
that rooms in these houses be rented to
individuals of the fraternity chapter.
M 4. That the University build similar
houses in the same locality for non-fra
ternity women, the same to be rented
from the University in accordance with
the present system of room rental at
Roble Hall.
ALTERATION OF ROBLE
"We offer the following suggestions
of alteration of the present Roble Hall.
"Roble Hall as it now stands is an
admitted failure. Women residents of
the Hall will substantiate its defects:
(1) Lack of advantages of the small
group enumerated above; (2) inade
quate social facilities; (3) inadequate
ventilation of the bedrooms by one win
dow, and the unsanitary, undesirability
of a stationary washstand in a sleeping
room.
"It is our earnest appeal that the Uni
versity remedy, in so far as it is able,
these defects in the Hall and make every
effort to avoid duplication of these de
fects in any further University dormi
tories.
"We suggest that the size of Roble
be cut down from 210 women to 150
women, which ho subdivided into smaller
groups of 75 by the use of additional
partitions. We suggest that the present
dining rooms be maintained and that
further reception rooms, libraries, and
study rooms be provided on the main
floor.
"The above plan provides for the
maintenance of separate kitchens and
dining rooms in the small group houses
with the assumption that University
wholesale buying and a common heating
system, for which there is pressing need
even in the present housing system,
would be a feature of such a housing
system.
"Should, however, the maintenance of
j separate dining rooms prove, on closer
investigation, to be uneconomical, we
I suggest a variation of the plan, which,
we believe, would maintain any possi
bility of economic loss. This variation
we will call the Patio Plan.
"We suggest that with the present
Roble Hall as one side of a tentative
square, that semi-detached houses ac
commodating from 15 to 20 women with
sleeping rooms and living rooms but
without dining quarters be built in the
form of an open square. This, we be
lieve, would result in a housing group
of compactness and in it could lie pre
served the architectural harmony of the
University buildings. Rooms in these
semi-detached houses would be rented
from the University by the women occu
pying them. However, we believe, that
in the formation of the groups that non
fraternity women as well as members of
fraternities should be allowed to build
up their living groups by choice.
"Under the Patio Plan we suggest that
the University provide eating commons
for the women residents of the small
group units accommodating approxi
mately 75 women each. Such eating
commons would offer an opportunity for
the women to meet three times a day
under no restrictions of membership in
any particular living group.
WQMEN APPROVE PLAN
"This, in brief, is the substance of the
housing plan approved by approximately
250 University- women who have ' iff-' 1

joyed the benefits of the small living
group and wish those advantages per
petuated and extended in any alteration
of the system to the entire body of
women students at Stanford.
"We lay this matter before you and
earnestly appeal for your consideration.
"Very truly yours,
"The Inter-Sorority
1 NVESTIGATION COM MITTEE.

"Ellen Calhoun."
Sorority women of the eampns in a
letter to the Board of Trustees submitted
for their meeting last Friday made
their ideas concerning' the proposed
change in housing for the women of the
University advocating a small-unit sys
tem. The letter was drawn up by a
committee of three authorized by the
presidents of the various living groups
and approved by Pan-Hellenic. The
letter was signed by all of the women's
fraternities and by the committee who
drew up the latter.
Two points are particularly empha
sized concerning the housing system:
(1) That it should be based on a small
unit plan; and (2) that the University
should not undertake any entensive
change until it is in a position finan
cially to meet the small-unit system. The
letter did not contain any defense for
sororities as organizations, but confined
their statements entirely to the housing
problem. The letter reads as follows:
PREAMBLE OPENS LETTER
"We. the fraternity women of Stan
ford University, being keenly interested
in the housing problem of the students
of the University, do hereby present this
report which comes as the result of care
ful investigation and a thoughtful en
deavor to grasp the problem of the wel
fare of Stanford women.
"We believe that in the present system
of housing there are certain obvious de
fects, such as the geographical isolation
of one group from another.
"We believe, however, that in the
present system there are certain inherent
advantages, such as the benefits derived
from the small group.
"We believe, therefore, and urge, that
any contemplated alteration of the pres
ent system should exclude the defects
and include the advantages set forth in
the following report.
"It is our earnest appeal that the
Administration, in order to guarantee the
best possible living conditions for Stan
ford women, should carry out such
plans in the change of housing only to
the extent that those plans preserve the
advantages of the small group; and that
at no time shall the Administration dis
regard these advantages because of scar
city of funds.
"We believe that it would be a grave
injustice to all concerned to uproot the
present stable system until each step of
any comprehensive change can be
financed adequately.
PRESENT SYSTEM'S ADVANTAGES
"In the discussion of a new housing
system for Stanford we believe it is only
fair to consider what advantages there
are inherent in the system as it stands
