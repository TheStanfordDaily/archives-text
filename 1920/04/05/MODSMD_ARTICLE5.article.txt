# FRATERNITY WOMEN PRESENT VIEWS ON HOUSING PROBLEMS FOR CONSIDERATION
## Plan Outlined For Dormitory Change for Board Passed By Pan-Hellenic Delegates 
### 
Sorority women of the eampns in a
letter to the Board of Trustees submitted
for their meeting last Friday made
their ideas concerning' the proposed
change in housing for the women of the
University advocating a small-unit sys
tem. The letter was drawn up by a
committee of three authorized by the
presidents of the various living groups
and approved by Pan-Hellenic. The
letter was signed by all of the women's
fraternities and by the committee who
drew up the latter.
Two points are particularly empha
sized concerning the housing system:
(1) That it should be based on a small
unit plan; and (2) that the University
should not undertake any entensive
change until it is in a position finan
cially to meet the small-unit system. The
letter did not contain any defense for
sororities as organizations, but confined
their statements entirely to the housing
problem. The letter reads as follows:
