# CARDINAL IS READY FOR U.C.
## Babes Clash With U.C. Bruins 
### 
This afternoon the Freshmen are play
ing their first game with the University
of California babes, on the Stanford dia
mond. The Cardinal first-year men are
seriously handicapped by the loss of
Gray, first string pitcher, who is on
probation.
Schwartz is starting the game the
mound for Stanford, with Rogers held
in reserve. Captain George Green is re
ceiving, although he is suffering from a
broken finger obtained in a game last
week. â€ž
Patterson is holding down the first
sack position, while Peavy and C. Green
are playing second and short, respective
ly. Heckendorf will handle anything
that comes near third base.
Carver, B. Green, and Welsh will play
the outfield.
The babes have been working hard
for this game and have developed into a
fast club. With a fair percentage of the
"breaks" in their favor, the freshmen
will make the game interesting for the
Bruin Cubs.

Should the Cards perform in the same
scintillating manner tomorrow after
noon against the University of Cali
fornia diamond artists as they did dur
ing the past week in practice skirmishes.
King Victory will perch on the farm
staff for the second time in as many
years.
Captain Kalian stated today that his
proteges were in the pink of condition
for the first varsity melee tomorrow aft
ernoon on the California lot.
Coaches Evans and Zamlock express
confidence in their respective aggrega
tions, and from the way things loom to
day, either Newland or Draper will grace
the mound for Stanford, while Ellison
or McHenry are sure to get a chance for
the opposition.
Local enthusiasts will remember Elli
son for his eratic fielding in the box in
the fracases of last year, which paved
the way for Cardinal victories.
The Varsity and "Frosh" have been
engaging against each other during the
