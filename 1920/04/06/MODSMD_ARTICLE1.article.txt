# CALIFORNIA BABES DEFEAT CARDINAL FIRST-YEAR NINE
## Bruins Tenth-Inning Rally Wins Ragged Game From Freshmen 
### 
After coming from behind and tying
the score in the eighth inning, the
California freshmen held the Stanford
Babes and then scored again in the
tenth, thu√ü winning the first of the
series between the two teams.
The winning run was the result of a
long fly to center field by Hermle, the
Blue and Gold first baseman, which R.
Green misjudged, allowing Hermle to
circle the bases.
California scored first in the second
when they chalked up two runs 'oc
two hits and an error. Stanford cam<
back in their half of this inning and
tied the score. Neither side counted
again until the fifth, when, the Cardi
nal Babes staged a rally. Hawkins,
first man up, walked, and advanced
to second on Rogers' fielders' choice.
The double steal was successfully exe
cuted and both men scored on Peavy's
single to right. Heckendorf chased
Peavey in ahead of him, when he
drove a home run to deep center.
This outburst netted the Babes four
more runs.
Not to be outdone, California es
sayed a come back in the sixth, which
resulted in three more runs to their
credit. "Brick" Muller slammed the
horsehide over the Cardinal left field
er's head for a home run, in the
eighth, tying the score, and then
everything was tranquil until the fatal
tenth.
Muller starred for California with
four hits out of five trips to the plate.
The umpire seemed to have diffi
culty in pleasing both teams. He was
continually besieged and threatened
by first one and then the other club,
as he gave unpopular decisions.
