'I wo Â£mrii>lishing companies plan to
print tje speeches in their debaters'
handbook series. President Egbert Nich
ols of Redlands University, author of
the Debucer's Annual, and the H. E.
Wilson Company, publishers of the
Morningside Series, have made arrange
ments to have the speeches taken bv an
expert stenographer at the time of de
livery.
The Redlands trio has had previous
experience in debates on this question,
having defeated Occidental College and
taken part in a discussion of the ques
tion before a meeting of a national de
bating fraternity at Morningside a few
days ago.
The Honorable William H. Langdon,
Presiding justice of the District Court
of Appeals.of San Francisco; Professor
Cline of the College of the Pacific, and
Mr. Charles F. Woods, city librarian of
San Jose, have agreed to act as judges.
Professor Basset of the Public Speaking
Department will preside as chairman.
The question for debate is one of
more than usual interest, dealing dircct-'
ly with the problem of industrial unrest.
The rich background acquired by the
Stanford trio in their study of labor
problems for more than a quarter should
put them on a par with the Redlands
team, despite-the visitors' advantage of
previous experience with this question.
The debate will be held in the Little
Theatre tonight at 8:00 o'clock.
