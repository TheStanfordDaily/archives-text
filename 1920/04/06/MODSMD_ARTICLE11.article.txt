# JORDAN COLLECTION OF FOSSILS SHOWN AT ART GALLERY
## 
### 
A group of fish fossils from the
Jordan collection, lately arrived at the
Stanford Museum, with photographs
and sketches prepared by Dr. Jordan,
will be on view at the Thomas Welton
Stanford Art Gallery during the next
two weeks. The photographs are
hand-colored and with the drawings
represent the fishes of the Miocene
period.
In the latter part of April an exhibi
tion of oil painting by Charles Rollo
Peters will be shown. This collection
was formerly announced, but it has
been postponed a week. It will last
until commencement week when a
group of oil paintings representing the
works of artists of Boston, New York,
and Philadelphia, will form one of
the most interesting exhibits of the
year. The collection comprises the
work of twenty or thirty distinguished
artists, and is held by Pedro J. Lenios,
curator of the Museum and director
of the Art Gallery, to be the finest ex
hibition of paintings that has come to
the Coast this year, not excepting the
San Francisco exhibits. The groups
will be the last art showing of this
year. The display of Chinese photo
graphs concluded yesterday.
