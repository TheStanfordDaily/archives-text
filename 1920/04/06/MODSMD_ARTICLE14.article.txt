### 
Stanford's second victim of robbers'
wiles while queening on the campus is
Edgar Hale '20. Last night
while walking along the shores of Lake
Lagunita with one of the fair co-eds of
the Farm, a very business-like robber
demanded that Nfassetjiold up his hands
and turn over tyfk wafceh and money.
As the victim is Vseasoned queener. the
unknown robber was able to secure over
$10 in cash from his adventure. Musser
states that while he has often been walk
ing along Lagunita's shores, this is the
first tittle that he has been disturbed by
any bold bad men. It is thought that the
perpetrator of the crime is the same
man that robbed another unfortunate
student in the vicinity of bridge
last quarter. Musser is a member of
.Alpha Delta Phi and registers froir. Al-
