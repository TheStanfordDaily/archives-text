## 
### 
Many southern people got their first
taste of Art Hickman jazz when the
Stanford Glee Club featured their nine
piece orchestra on their recent trip
through the southland. Never before
has such an orchestra been carried
with the club, and the southern critics
say it is the best collegiate syncopated
orchestra that has ever toured the
south. Hotel Ambassador of Santa
Barbara attempted to hire the entire
nine for the summer.....
Following the concert nevt Saturday
night, a - dance will be given by the
Glee Club at the Woman's Club House.
The music will be furnished by the
jazz orchestra, and its pieces will be
increased to twelve. This will be the
largest campus jazz orchestra that has
ever played at any dance. It is a com
plete collction of local syncopaters.
All Glee Club members havte been
requested to meet in Room 84, at 4:30
on Wednesday afternoon. .
