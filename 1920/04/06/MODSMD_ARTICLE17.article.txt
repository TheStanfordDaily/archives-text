tion for the final debate is: "Resolved,
That college teachers should organize
and affiliate with the American Federa
tion of Labor." The specific society
which will represent the University of
California has not yet been chosen, as
elimination debates are still being held
among the Berkeley societies, the win
ner of which will send a team to the
Stanford Campus.
Tryouts for the Euphronia team will
be held Thursday evening in room 12 of
the Law Building. All members of the
society except those who have already
participated in some intercollegiate con
test are eligible for the team. It is
urged thjjt all interested should begin

California societies for several months,
and several debates have already hern
held on the subject. The tryout speech
es will be five minutes in length for the
main speeches and two minutes for the
rebuttals.
