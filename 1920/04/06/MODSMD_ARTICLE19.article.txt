# STANFORD MEETS CALIFORNIA NINE IN INITIAL GAME
## Evans and Kallan Confident of Cardinal Victory; Two Bets in Box 
### 
The first of a series of three dia
mond skirmishes is on college sport
program at Berkeley this afternoon,
when the Stanford varsity meets the'
Bruins, The result of the game today
will mould to a large extent any
chance the Cardinal has to win the
second consecutive series from the
Blue and Gold.
Newland or Draper will perform on
the rubber, Mntor Evans announced
this morning before his departure with
the team. He is certain his proteges
will deal out a flashy brand of the
national pastime. Reports from the
bay region indicate that Coach Carl
Zamlock will choose Ellison for duty
on the mound. If he cuts up antics
today as he did in the games last
season, the Bruins will be forced to use
a big derrick.
Captain Kalian is jubilant over the
way his men played during practice
games last week, both with the fresh
men and with army tossers at the
Monterey Presidio.
Following is the announced line-up
for Stanford:
Newland or Draper, p; Bundy, c;
Ratner, lb; Kalian, 2b; Thompson, ss;
Crowe or Mailotte, 3b; Mitchell, If;
Wayland, cf, and Kline, rf.
