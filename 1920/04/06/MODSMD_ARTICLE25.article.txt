# WOMEN'S RULES AND THE HANDBOOK
## 
### 
ffIHE Handbook for the Organized Women appeared on the campus for the
first time yesterday and it was read with considerable interest. Many
of the women on the campus probably read rules which they never knew
existed before and in this connection the present codification will prove im
mensely beneficial. The one objection to the rules as they now stand is that
so many of them are subject to interpretation. Entertainments in Palo Alto
are vague. Do these apply to dances in Palo Alto? As a matter of fact the
house president can give late leave in such circumstances if she sees fit.
However, the step in the handbook is a long one in advance and with several
successive appearances it will not be a great while before it is fairly per
fected in detail. The women on the campus at least have an idea where
they stand.
To many the rules came as quite a surprise because the general im
pression has been that they are much more complicated than they really are.
In comparison with many other universities, including state institutions,
Stanford is remarkably free from rules and regulations and it is hoped that
student government will prove so successful that we will always remain so.
As the rules now stand the motoring regulation is practically the only rule
which is felt to be strict and only a small percentage of the women of the
campus are really seriously affected by that. The definite codification of
the regulations brings out this point clearly and the Women's Council may
feel that they have accomplished something very worth-while in the editing
of this little book.
