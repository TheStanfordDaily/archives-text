# GLEE CLUB COMES BACK
## 
### 
11EPOUTS from southern newspapers of the trip which the Stanford Glee
Club took in the south, would indicate that the Glee Glub has once more
come back into its own. In the old days the Glee Club was one of the best
known institutions which Stanford had. Unfortunate circumstances prac
tically made the club extinct, but with its revival it is to be hoped that
it has come back to stay.
Members of the Glee Club have worked faithfully and hard to get the
Club back on its feet again under the direction of Dean Warren Allen. They
will make their appearance on the campus next Saturday evening and the
University should show them that we are glad the singing days are back.
A good Glee Club concert is exceptionally entertaining and lias the peculiar
flavor of a college production. The clever songs, good harmony, and stunts
are always enjoyed by a campus audience. With this new beginning the Glee
Club should have a successful season.
