THE DAILY PALO ALTO received a letter last quarter in which it was
asked why a student must pay fifty-five cents to gain -admission to athletic
contests after paying the incidental fee, part of which goes to support athlet
ics. We take great pleasure in informing the writer of the letter that stu
dents presenting registration cards do not have to pay admission to the
great majority of athletic contests played 011 the campus. But aside from
this, every student should be willing, ready, and anxious to pay fifty-five cents
to see any Stanford team in action, even if he had to pay that amount 011
top of the incidental fee. We cannot remember a Stanford team which
has not been worth fifty-five cents to see in action.
