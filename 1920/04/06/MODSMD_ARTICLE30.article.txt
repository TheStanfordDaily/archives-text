half mile several times this year and
should break his own record of 2:05
made last year on the California track.
He will also be entered in the mile.
Phillip Scotield of Palo Alto is counted
upon to give Pearce a good battle in the
half. Becklcy of Ukiali has done 11 feet
6 inches in the pole vault several times
this season, and man go even higher in
the keen competition that will be afford
ed Saturday morning.
The main purpose of this section meet
is to select the men to run at the state
meet at Bakersfleld. The first three men
in each event will be sent to the state
meet to compete with the men from
the other three sections.
