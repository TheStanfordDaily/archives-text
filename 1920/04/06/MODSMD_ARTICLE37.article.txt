# 1948 STUDENTS ON REGISTER FOR
## SPRING QUARTER Enrollment Is Higher Than in Previous Yearsâ€”Will Reach 2000 
### 
Enrollment in the University for this
quarter evidently will pass the 2,0(10
mark and may exceed 2,1(X).
Registration for the year continues to
be higher than in any previous year in
the University, although, as is always
the case, it shows a steady falling off
from the total at the beginning of the
fall quarter.
The total number last nifht at the
close of the first day's registration was
1.948. This to be compared with 1,462
at the end of the first day's registra
tion for the spring quarter last year.
The total at the beginning of the sec
ond semester for 1915-1916. when the
enrollment was the largest in the Uni
| versity's history up to the present year,
which lias broken all records, was 1,834.
The enrollment for this quarter doubt
| less will be considerably increased with-
I in the next few days, since this is the
case in every term. The Glee Club, num
bering 4() men. has not yet returned to
college, and the usual increase lias re
cently been around 150 over the lirst
day's registration, so that the total reg
istration for this quarter will be ap
parently well over 2.0(H) and may sur
pass 2,100.
In the spring quarter last year the reg
istration ran from 2.146 at the end ot
the ilr t day's registration to 2.305 at
the end of the quarter. In the fall quar- %
ter this year the enrollment ran from
2,297 at the end of the first day's reg
istration to 2,450 at the end of the
quarter.
Of the 1,948 registered yesterday. 20
were former students of the University"
men and women, who had not registered
before this year. Forty-two were new
men students. No new women students
were admitted, there being no vacancies
since the 500 limit was already filled.
