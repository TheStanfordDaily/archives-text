# TRACK TRAINING TABLE MEMBERS ARE ANNOUNCED
## 
### 
Twenty-one members for the track
training table to be established at the
Alpha Delta Phi house were named by
Coach Maloney this morning. They are
Kirksey, Wells, Floete, Lilly, Davis,
Wright, Scofield, Hertel, King, Carl
smith, Haskell, Westwick, Wilkie, Tem
pleton, Weaver, Green, Wilcox, Gilles
pie, Tauzer, Adams, Rogers, Heath,
Deering and Hammer.
With the big dual California meet
only twelve days away, Maloney and
Trainer "Dad" Moulton are straining
every effort to get the men into proper
shape, as both mentors have expressed
their belief that the outcome of the com
ing close battle hangs in the balance on
the condition of the athletes.
Captain "Jess" Wells, Templeton, and
a few others resumed training with
short workouts yesterday morning, while
all the squad members are working this
afternoon.
From the results of the meets in
southern California, the Bruins, in the
opinion of many, have a slight edge on
the Cardinal tracksters, due to a superi
ority in the field events. Excetional
records, however, made by certain of
the Stanford competitors, seem to cinch
-a number of points for Moloney's men,
and the breaks of the day nfobably will
determine whether or not the Cardinal
trackmen mark up the eighth consecu
iive> victory.
