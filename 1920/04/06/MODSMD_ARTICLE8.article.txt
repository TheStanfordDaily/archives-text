# HANDBALL FINALS TO BE PLAYED SATURDAY
## 
### 
Saturday afternoon on the Encina
gymnasium courts, the Stanford hand
ball team will play a concluding tour
nament in a series of three matches
with the University of California. The
Cardinal squad is practicing every aft
ernoon this week in preparation for
the contest, which will be the decid
ing match in the series with the Blue
and Gold.
The same team which represented
Stanford in the last tournament with
U. C. will play on the Encina court
Saturday. A fast match is certain
as the northern players have recently
won a number of contests with Bay
City teams. The local squad is ex
pected by the athletic coach to upset
the predictions of the sport dopsters
of Berkeley that an additional victory
will be scored by the Blue and Gold
in the determining tournament of the
series.
