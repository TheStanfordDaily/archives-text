IF you want to play a winner; sure
thing —put your money on Ches
terfield.
In less than three years, more than
three million smokers have become
Chesterfield fans.
And no wonder! Never were finer
tobaccos used in any cigarette. The
silkiest leaves of aromatic Turkish and
the choicest of ripe, sweet Domestic
stock are put together by an exclusive
blending method that brings out a new
deliciousness of flavor.
Satisfy"? Right down to your toes!
Chesterfields have put added enjoyment
into every puff —enjoyment that you
don't get and can't get in any other
cigarette because the Chesterfield blend
can't be copied.
A man's best pal is his smoke
