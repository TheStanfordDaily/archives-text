# CARDINAL TRACK MEN TO MEET TROJANS TOMORROW
## Kirksey and Paddock Will Feature in Hundred-Yard Event 
### 
As the final competition before the
big meet with California on April 17,
the Stanford Varsity will meet the Uni
versity of Southern California track team
in a return meet on the Stanford oval
tomorrow afternoon at 3:15. Stanford
won from the Trojans during the spring
vacation by the score of 61 to 52.
Coach Harry Maloney has asked
President Robert Dodd of the Amateur
Athletic Union to send official timers
down tomorrow, as he expects record
time to be made in several of the events.
Kirksey and Paddock probably will pro
vide the features of the meet in their
two races, and the Cardinal runner is
expected to come against the Trojan
and make record time in the century and
the 220.
The Varsity will be minus the services
of Hamlyn, quarter-miler and member
of the relay team, who went on proba
tion. However, Wright of last, year's
Varsity is back this quarter and will take
Hamlyn's places in both events.
Captain Jess Wells is in excellent form
after the meets during vacation, and he
will be the big point winner for the
Varsity. Green, Templeton, and Wil
cox are in good shape for the field
events, and they will repeat their per
formances of the south.
