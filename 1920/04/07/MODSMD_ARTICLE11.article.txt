# CREW DEVELOPES GOOD FORM FOR COMING BIG REGATTA
## Daily Workouts on Redwood Estuary to Smooth Out Faults in Shell 
### 
Stanford's Varsity crew is now fast
rounding into shape with only the fin
ishing touches necessary to good row
ing form. Some of the men are prac
tically sure of their positions in the
shell, though there is chance for change
in several places. Yesterday's work was
taken up chiefly in starts and sprints and
perfecting of the racing tactics which
the coach is now drilling into the men.
The Varsity showed plenty of strength
in the starts and sprints and seemed to
work very well with Steinbeck at stroke.
Several of the members of last night's
first Varsity eight showed minor de
fects in their stroke, but the next week's
practice is to be devoted to taking out
these faults.
Every man now rowing on the Varsity
has rowed in at least one freshman or
varsity race on the estuary against Cali
fornia, and so inexperience should be a
negligible factor in this year's race.
Yesterday's first Varsity consisted of
Steinbeck stroke, McCormack seven.
Brown six, McGillvray five, Davis four,
Snow three, Carey two, and JefTers bow.
The second Varsity were out in the
English shell that has just been repaired,
and several of the men were showing
form that gives them a very fair chance
of a seat in the Varsity boat, unless
there is improvement in some of the
members there. A number of the men
now rowing in the second boat will be
excellent Varsity material in another
season, according to Roy King, '19, who
is assisting Rogers in the coaching.
The freshmen showed decided im
provement over their work of the last
few days and seem to be in some meas
ure overcoming the raggedness that
marks every freshman eight. From the
side they look fine, and it is only from
the coaching launch that one gets a
look at the line they hold in the boat.
Several of the*ttien show a slight ten
dency to fall away from their oar, but
it is the opinion of King that this can
be overcome by practice between now
and the time of the race. The Rabes
have plenty of weight and all kinds of
fight but lack the finish that marks the
varsities. The freshmen are being con
stantly chantred around in the boat, and
in the rest of the squad and at the pres
ent time no one is sure of a place in
the shell. The freshmen line-up in the
boat yesterday was: Lindstrum stroke,
Helser seven, Richardson six, Rowes
five, Loomis four. Rosenblum three,
Walthers two. and Hicks bow.
