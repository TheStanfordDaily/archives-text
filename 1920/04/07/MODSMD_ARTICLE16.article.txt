The lucky seventh Rave California
the first game of the 1920 baseball se
ries when the Stanford nine allowed
four Blue and Gold players to cross the
rubber. The game, which was played on
the Berkeley diamond, was witnessed by
two thousand spectators and ended with
a final tally of 5 to 1.
Captain Rohwer, who was the first
bruin batter in the seventh, was walked
by Newlands. Rowc went to bat and
knocked a two-bagger in center, scoring
Rohwer. Makin was thrown out at
first. Dexter popped a single, which
was followed by a double by White, al
lowing two more men to reach home.
An error by Mailott allowed Ellison to
reach first, but was catieht off first, mak
ing the second out. Newland fumbled
a bunt, which allowed Meyers to reach
first and White to score the fourth run
for that inning. The inning ended when
Works knocked an easy ball to New
land. Another run was made bv Roh
wer, who circled all four bags on a hit
into the grand stand in the fourth in
ning.
A faint shadow of hope for a Cardi
nal victory appeared in the ninth inning,
when Ellison walked Kallam. Kline
reached first on an infield tap. but Kal
lam was caucrht on his way to second.
Wayland made the second out bv strik
ing. Ratner then took the bat and
slapped a three-bagger into left, scoring
Kline. Ellison struck out the next Stan
ford batter, leaving Ratner on third and
winning the game for the bay city col
lege.
With the exception of the play dur
ing the fatal inning, the average playing
nf the men on both clubs was about par.
Both sides played close ball, each re
ceiving only two errors during the time
of play.
Newland and Ellison both pitched good
ball, the latter ha vine a slip"-' advantage
over the Stanford twirler, due to his
lonsrer experience pitching colleee ball.
Ellison struck out nine while Newlands
struck out three men. The California
pitcher allowed three Stanford men to
reach first on balls, and Newlands al
lowed i'ist one walk during the came.
The Cardinal nine will have an on
portunitv to statre a comeback, when the
two teams cross bats in a second game,
