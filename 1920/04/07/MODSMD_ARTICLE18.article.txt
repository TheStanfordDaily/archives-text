# Changes Are Made In Law School Faculty
## 
### 
Associate Professor W. B. Owens,
who was appointed to the faculty of the
Law School for the coming quarter, will
assume his duties on the first of May.
Until his arrival, Dean Huston is con
ducting his course in Agency. Profes
sor Huston expects to leave some time
during the quarter for the East. He
will teach in the Law School of Yale
University during the summer, giving
courses in Corporation Law.
Mr. Hill, who has been acting as lec
turer in charge of the course in Califor
nia practice, will be unable to continue
his work after this quarter, owing to
the growth of his private law practice.
Mr. Mill has consented to continue as a
lecturer on special topics in California
practice next year and will give special
lectures in connection with the course in
Corporations and Property. Mr. Hill is
one of the leaders of the Santa Clara
County Par, and his resignation is re
gretted by all of the law faculty and
students. Mr. Hill formerly was a stu
dent at Stanford, securing his Juris Doc
tor's degree in 1911.
