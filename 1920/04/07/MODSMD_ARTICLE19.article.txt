The Carnival Committee already has
received much favorable comment on its
decision to have a King and Queen for
the festive occasion. Much interest in
the plan manifested itself on the cam
pus today, and already followers are ral
lying to the support of their favorite
candidates. A large vote is assured, as
campaigning for a number of well
known students was started today.
Election of a King and Queen to
reign over the Spring Carnival bids fair
to become a Stanford tradition and an
honor which will be sought in this and
future carnivals.
King Hilarity and Queen Merriment
bespeak the spirit that the carnival will
take this year. Joy truly will be the
motif.
The spectacle presented by the royal
court will be one of much beautv and
splendor, under the present plans of
the Carnival Committee. Nothing will
be spared in costuming the King and
Ouoen and their courtiers in royal robes
befitting those selected to portray the
ioyful side of Stanford life.
