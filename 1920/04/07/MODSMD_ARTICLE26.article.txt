# THE
						PEACE DOVE SHOWS ITS CLAWS

### 
IJRANCE, driven to desperate measures at last by Germany's obstinate and
calculating refusal to actively ratify the terms of agreement with the
Allies, and aroused because of her own proximity to the scene of Teuton in
ternal revolt, which is rapidly assuming the aspect of radical Bolshevism,
has thrown her armed troops over the border in a filial attempt to protect
a trembling peace, and the fruits of a questionable victory.
The as yet bloodless advance of the t.ri-color columus into Frankfort and
Darnstadt, and the immediate consequent action of the Italian government
in extending to France a moral, but under no circumstances a material, sup
port, seems to disclose several significant omens, reflecting directly upon the
future welfare of a continental peace. First of all, if Italy's is a fair ex
ample, the alliance which conquered over Germany seems in a fair way to
topple under the first strain. France, endeavoring as a last resort to force
ratification of the proposed peace, finds herself left entirely alone in her
dilemna against a still powerful foe. The American and English troops have
been, as far as possible, withdrawn. Secondly, should Germany, like Russia,
proceed from a revolutionary state to a state of absolute anarchy, offering
hostile resistance to the demands of the Allies, under existing conditions
France would be powerless to enforce German obedience, and her situation
would be as precarious as that of the general who found one of his triumphs
so costly that another such victory would mean disaster.
From the brief reports concerning the position of the United States,
Washington seems to have taken a definite stand against the French action
and a London dispatch this morning says that our position is quite clearly
defined. Just what definite action the United States will take in regard to
this new diplomatic tangle is a matter of conjecture but it bids fair toward
serious international complications. Undoubtedly, we are hardly in a po
sition to appreciate the motive which lead to the French invasion, but we can
hardly fail to recognize the breach of contract. Allied support either one way
or another is almost essential and it is to be hoped that those nations who
won the war will not split on this issue.
