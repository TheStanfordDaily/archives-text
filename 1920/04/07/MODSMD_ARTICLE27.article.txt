# THE 						FACULTY AS HOSTS
## 
### 
mHE DAILY PALO ALTO wishes to express its sincere appreciation of the
effort which is being made on the part of the faculty to meet the stu
dents of the University. Next Friday night, the faculty men are entertain
ing the men of the senior and holdover classes at a smoker in the Faculty
Clubhouse. We hope that the men to whom the invitation is extended will
do their part in fostering that spirit of comradeship between faculty and
students which is so essential to a healthy college life. Plans are also under
way, we understand, for a general faculty-senior reception to be held during
the current quarter, which we look forward to with considerable pleasure.
Through the editorial columns of the Daily Palo Alto last quarter, we
urged a closer friendship between faculty and students. Many members of
the faculty feel that the response from the students in this direction is not
worth the effort. The time has come when we must make good. Every
senior man who possibly can should be at the Faculty Clubhouse next Fri
day night and later at the faculty-senior reception, the whole class should
turn out en mass. The seniors have the chance to show the rest of the
University how it can be done and as the leaders of undergraduate life, they
will make good the responsibility.
