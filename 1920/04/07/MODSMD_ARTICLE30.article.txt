# STANDARD OIL OFFERS FOREIGN SERVICE OPPORTUNITIES
## Unique Business Training is Open to Stanford Seniors 
### 
Stanford students who are interested
in foreign service with the Standard Oil
Company of New York will be given an
opportunity to qualify for the training in
New York at Stanford provided enough
students arc interested to make it worth
while for a representative to come to the
coast. It was originally announced that
the candidates would have to go to New
York to take the examinations, but upon
Mrs. Snell's protestation the Standard
Oil Company has agreed to send a man
to the coast.
The applications are only open to se
niors between the ages of twenty-one
and twenty-eight, The men must be un
married, but there is no objection to
marrying after two or three years of
service.
The successful candidates will be sent
to New York for a four months' course
in the Standard Oil College. The men
who do not meet the requirements will
be dropped out during the four months.
At the end of the course the men will
be assigned to foreign service along lines
to which they seem best suited. The
kinds of work that are open are clerical,
selling, and organizing of branch agen
cies.
While in training the men will receive
$23 a week to cover their living ex
penses. When the assignments are made
the men will receive, in the currency of
the country to which they are assigned,
the equivalent of $166.66 per month in
American gold.
An engineering course is particularly
practical for men who desire to enter
this service, but is in no way a require
ment. A knowledge of a foreign lan
guage is desirable, but the men will be
expected to learn the lantruage of the
country to which they are assigned.
Men who are interested in this service'
should obtain application blanks from
the appointment office immediately as
the Standard Oil Company is desirous of
making the selections as soon as pos
sible.
