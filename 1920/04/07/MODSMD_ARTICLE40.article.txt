# PRESIDENT OF YALE WILL RETIRE IN 1921

### 
NEW YORK, April 7â€” Dr. Albert
P. Hadley, president of Yale Univer
sity, will retire in the spring of 1921,
"unless some grave emergency should
arise," he has announced. He will be
65 years old then and his retirement
will be in accord with his often-ex
pressed decision, he added.
"When I accepted the presidency of
Yale in 1899, I announced that I
should retire upon reaching the age
of 65," Dr. Hadley said, "I shall attain
that age in the spring of 1921 and

yet I foresee 110 reason for altering
my original intention. Unless some
grave emergency should arise which
would render expedient my continu
ance in office for the welfare of the
University I shall retire at the speci
fied time."
Dr. Hadley characterized queries as
to whom he favored as his successor
as premature.
