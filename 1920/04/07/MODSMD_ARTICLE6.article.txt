# N.H. Petree Writes On "Store Democracy" For "Illustrated"
## 
### 
"Store Democracy" is the suggestive
title of a story in this issue of the
Illustrated Review by Neil H. Petree,
'19. Mr. Petree is now connected with
the Winestock-Lubin Company of Sac
ramento, working under Mr. Edward H.
Krehbiel, who was formerly a profes
sor in the History Department of Stan
ford, but who is now in charge of the
work with the employees of that com
pany. Methods of improving labor con
ditions and thoroughly organizing such
stores are discussed in this timely article.
Needs of the Lane Clinic are outlined
in a graphic story of its work, writ
ten by Miss Edith Mirrielees, entitled,
" 'S' for Service." Service was Stan
ford's aim all during the war, and the
Lane Clinic offers an excellent oppor
tunity for carrying out this aim now.
The Illustrated Review will be on sale
April 12th.
