# REDLANDS DEBATERS WIN FROM STANFORD
## Southern Speakers Exhibit Marked Experience and Platform Ability 
### 
Redlands University debaters won a
decision from the Stanford forensic
trio last night in the Little Theatre, ar
guing for a proposition demanding com
pulsory arbitration for all railroad labor
disputes. The Redlands speakers have
just returned from an extensive tour of
the East, where they were victorious in
the national debating conference. A su
periority of platform ability and a better
exercise of debating tactics determined
the southerners' victorv over the Cardi
nal combination.
The Cardinal trio attempted to prove
the inadvisability of compulsory arbi
tration by a preponderance of evidence
collected from statements of economists,
laborers, and employees of the railroads.
In advocating compulsor" arbitration,
Redlands speakers pointed out the rail
road strikes inherent in the present sys
tem with all their attendant evils, saving
their new plan would remedy these
faults and demanding from the negative
some other plan which would relieve the
situation better than would compulsory
arbitration.
The negative refused the burden of
presenting a substitute, and here, in the
opinion of a Delta Sigma Rh'o represen
tative present, lost the debate in "fail
ing to show either that the evils of com
pulsory arbitration were greater than, or
would aggravate those of the present
system; or that some other plan would
remedy the situation better than the
proposed plan.
"The negative seemed to be advocat
ing that labor was a reasonable body of
men who would not strike in the future."
Professor Victor J. West of the Polit
ical Science Department presided at the
contest. The judges were: Judge Wil
liam IT. Langdon of San Francisco,
Professor Cline of the College of the
Pacific, and Mr. C. F. Wbods of San
Tose. Representing Stanford were T. G.
Trwin, '23. J. A. Anglin, '23, and L. W.
Hodges, '21.
