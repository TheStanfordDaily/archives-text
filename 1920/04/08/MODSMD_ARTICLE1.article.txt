# CARDINAL VARSITY NINE READY FOR CALIFORNIA GAME
## Squad Will Fight Hard For Ball Contest on Local Field Saturday 
### 
In an effort to stage a strong come
back against the University of Califor
nia nine next Saturday afternoon, Coach
Evans has been devoting all of his time
to the daily baseball practices. The
contest will be played on the local dia
mond at 3:30 p. m. An admission of
thirty-five cents will be charged student
body card holders, while fifty cents will
be the general price of admission.
Although the Bruins were the victors
of the first game of the 1920 Stanford-
California ball series, the two rival uni
versities are tied in their standing in the
Pacific Coast Conference. The Cardi
nal team was the winner of both of the
contests with the Oregon Aggies, while
the Blub and Gold split first honors
with O. A. C.
Stanford seems to have a weakness
in her batting, while the Bay City team
is unusually strong along this depart
ment of the game. Captain Rohwer, of
California, is apparently able to hit the
ball at will. During the first game
against the Cardinals, one of his hits
resulted in a clean home run.
The possibility of Ellison not working
in the box for the visitors will give a
slight advantage to the team on the
"Farm." Ellison is a stronger twirler
than McHenry, but Coach Zamlock is in
continual fear of a blow-up similar to
the one last year, which then gave Stan
ford the winning game of the series.
Coach Evans will not give out any
definite dope on his pitching staff. He
will start the same infield and outfield
that played the game last Tuesday with
probably one or possibly two changes,
which he will announce later.
Yell-Leader "Doc" Martin will be on
hand with his assistants, Armstrong and
Kinrtey, and is anxious to have every
one see the game not only to yell for
the baseball team, but also to conduct
practice for the track meet yell.
