# BEHYMER PLEASED WITH GLEE CLUB
## Local Musicians Will Have Home Concert Next Saturday 
### 
L. E. Behymer, Maestro Impresario,
of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Or
chestra, and probably the greatest
musical manager of the Pacific Coast,
recommends the Stanford Glee Club
as follows: "Stanford's Glee Club is
the best of its class I have ever heard
during my musical career. None has
ever come up to its standard and I
want to express my appreciation for
their part taken in the recent concert
given by the Los Angeles Philharmon
ic Orchestra."
Two concerts were given in which
the club took the part as soloists.
One was with the Los Angeles Sym
phony Orchestra and the other with
the Philharmonic. On Easter morn
ing the club r.ang at the Hotel Hunt
ington, Pasadena, and they were ac
companied by the Los Angeles Sym
phony, an orchestra composed of
eighty pieces. The Philharmonic con
cert was given at the Trinity Audi
torium, Los Angeles. Both numbers
met with great applause.
After having this experience of
singing with two of the greatest west
ern orchestras the club will put on
their home concert in the Assembly
Hall next Saturday night. From re
commendations and press notices of
the southern cities, this year's club
is evidently the best Stanford has
ever produced. Never before has such
a successful trip been made and this
was the first time that any club has
participated in concerts given by large
symphony orchestras.
