owing to the amount of work that he
was compelled to do before relinquish
ing hi- work as Dean of Men. He has
also been compiling an alumni direc
tory which has demanded a great deal
of his time, lie plans in his itinerary to
<ro by way of Salt Lake to Chicaco.
During his journey he will visit among
tlv Eastern universities.
McDowell expects to arrive on the
campus during the first part of June, and
from that time on he will spend all of
his time in his capacity as Alumni Sec

J. E. McDowell, Secretary of the
Stanford Alumni Association, will leave
April 20 for the East to attend a meet
im' of the National Association of Alum
ni Secretaries which will he held at Ann
Arbcr, Mich., during the middle of Ma>\
This will he the third meeting of alumni
secretaries that Mr. McDowell has at
tended in his capacity as Secretary of
the Stanford alumni. In 1914 he went
East to an association meeting, and
while there prevailed upon the members
to have their meeting the following
year at Stanford.
McDowell is making the trio with the
principal aim of becoming acquainted
with the alumni problems of the other
universities and of renewing the ac
quaintances of eastern Stanford alumni.
During l is journey he will explain to
the various Stanford clubs and alumni
associations the problems of the Uni
versity and the plans that are being
made here to have these conditions met.
A part-of his time will be given over to
an explanation of the proposed War
Memorial to be erected in honor of the
Stanford participants in the late war.
Already over $70,000 has been pledged
by the alumni, students and friends of
the University, and it is hoped that as
a result of this personal solicitation on
the part of Mr. McDowell, the fund can
be raised to the amount necessary to
carry the plan through to a successful
completion.
A great deal of interest in the pro
posed trip of Mr. McDowell has been
shown by tile Stanford clubs and asso
ciations. He has been flooded with let
ters during the past few weeks from
alumni requesting him to visit them.
Among the prominent alumni whom lie
will visit are W. Lee Lewis, now pro
fessor of chemistry at Northwestern
University and the inventor of the Lew
istite explosive, and B. G. Higley, presi
dent of the Stanford Club in New York
and the donor of the lliglev scholar
ship.
As McDowell without doubt knows
more students and alumni than anv
other graduate of Stanford, his trip will
be able to inform all of the alumni's
activities. From his college days he
has been in intimate association with
University graduates and members. Un
til his appointment as Dean of Men in
the fall of 1918 he was Assistant Regis
trar. His duties as Alumni Secretary
since 1907 have broueht him into close
association with alumni and students.
McDowell had planned to start his
trip earlier, but was unable to do so,
owing to the amount of work that he
was compelled to do before relinquish
ing hi- work as Dean of Men. He has
also been compiling an alumni direc
tory which has demanded a great deal
of his time, lie plans in his itinerary to
<ro by way of Salt Lake to Chicaco.
During his journey he will visit among
