# TAKING TIME FOR FRIENDSHIPS
## 
### 
IN the hurried life of the campus, students often neglect the one thing which
will later prove Ihe most valuable part of a college education. Friend
ships are made more easily in a college group, perhaps, than any other walk
of life. There is a natural comradeship which is taken for granted as soon
as man or woman comes to the campus. Undergraduate life is built upon
strong common interests. Intellectually, the college group more nearly ap
proximates a standard than any other group and there is a remarkable simi
larity in other activities. Therefore, friendships come more or less as a
matter of course and do not need the fostering which often is necessary in
the outside world.
The value of a friendship lies in its personal appeal. Friendships make
for the human element in life which, when all is said and done, makes life
worth the living. After a man or woman leaves college, the tie that binds
him to his Alma Mater is a personal one. Reminiscences, recollections, per
sonal friendships in the aggregate endear college days to even the under
graduate and this is certainly more true after the University is left behind.
In spite of all these things being true, however, it can certainly be said
that university men and women do not take time enough to form as many
close friendships as they should. The neglect is not intentional, yet it will
undoubtedly prove to be more serious in years to come. Every man or woman
when leaving college says, "There are so many people on the campus whom
T should like to have known better" and they leave with a feeling of regret
because the opportunity has slipped by. The many interests in college which
take our time, make us neglect one another. If every freshman could be
made to understand the importance of knowing as many people as possible
intimately, freshman training would accomplish something essentially worth
while. Friendships promote undergraduate loyalty, alumni loyalty, and loy
alty to those university ideals which are so important in the outside world.
Take time to make friendships and foster the Stanford spirit,
