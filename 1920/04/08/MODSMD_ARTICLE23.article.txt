						DISTINGUISHED VISITOR

### 
MISS HELEN TAPT is the guest of the University this evening and it is
with much pleasure that we extent to her a welcome to the Stanford
campus. Miss Taft, we feel, is the type of woman who inspires the women
of the universities in this country toward a nearer realization of the pos
sibilities Of a college education. At the present time Miss Taft is the acting
president of Bryn Mawr college and is heading a movement among the
alumnae for an endowment fund. Miss Taft, like so many other educators in
the United States, recognizes the great need for higher paid teachers and
Bryn Mawr is facing the same problem which so many other institutions are.
Miss Taft is interesting from another standpoint. Miss Taft has made
good in spite of her father's name â€”not on account of it. Miss Taft's rise in
educational fields has been a brilliant one. At the present time she is known
not so much as the daughter of ex-President Taft as the acting-president of
Bryn Mawr college. In her tour of the United States she has attracted con
siderable attention 011 account of her views on the possibilities in the future
women of the United States. Many of the old traditions concerning women
are rapidly being broken on account of just such work as Miss Taft is doing.
As a co-educationel institution, Stanford will listen with great interest to
what Miss Taft has to .say.
