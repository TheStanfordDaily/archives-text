# PLANS BEING MADE FOR CELEBRATION OF MAYFLOWER ARRIVAL
## 
### 
A nation-wide event, in which
schools and colleges will play an
important part, -s the celebration, by
all English speaking peoples, of the
landing of the pilgrims three hundred
years ago. Just what Stanford's part
in the tercentenary celebration will
be, has not as yet been decided, but
every effort is being made throughout
the United States to make the celebra
tion a fitting expression, the deeper
significance of the first arrival of the
Mayflower.
Indicating the importance of the
events is the fact that the United
States alone will not celebrate this
event in her early history. All Eng
lish-speaking peoples will participate
in official, institutional and community
exercises, and Great Britain, Canada
and Australia will take part in com
memorating the tercentenary which
will mark the present year.
Beginning with the first of May, in
England, according to the plans of
the Sulgrave Institution, the activiti
es will commence, and will proceed
later to the old port of Leyden in
Holland, and then to the United
States. Again the Mayflower will sail
from England, following the route of
the pilgrims, touching at Leyden, and
next at Provincetown, Massachusetts,
which in August will be the scene of
celebrations. Later Plymouth, Massa
chusetts, will hold the center of the
stage.
It is expected that the event mark
ing this tercentenary will be distri
buted throughout the United States
and will touch all sections and classes
of people, from highest officialdom
down to little private groups of peo
ple and social clubs, embracing in
this downward sweep institutions, or
ganizations and societies. The plan
is a vast one and in order to achieve
good results, patriotic and dramatic
societie , organizations and institu
tions everywhere will have to start
ahead of time, and put forth serious
effort. Community service officials
have already done some work in this
connection, and, through the depart
ment of pageantry and dramatics, they
plan to offer still further assistance
to communities undertaking celebra
tions. They have planned an exhibi
tion to be given in store in all the
cities throughout the United States,
and are making a catalogue of informa
tion as to stage settings suitable for
plays and pageants commemorating
the landing of the pilgrims in 1620.
The exhibition also includes a dozen
water colors by a British artist,
Stephen Reid, R.A., showing Sulgrave
Manor. These are loaned by the Sul
grave Institution, the custodian of
Sulgrave Manor.
Celebrations in England are being
arranged by the Sulgrave Institution
which takes its name from the ancient
seat of the Washington family, Sul
grave Manor. North Hants, England.
At this manor a special celebration
will mark the Tercentenary. The
English committee includes the Arch
bishop of Canterbury, Viscount Bryce,
Viscount Grey, David Lloyd George,
Cardinal Bourne, and the Lord Mayor
of London.
John A. Stewart is chairman of the
New York Board of Governors which
includes, among others, Brand Wliit
lock, James M. Beck, and Charles W.
Eliot. The advisory committee in
cludes J. P. Morgan, Samuel Gompers,
the Rev. Dr. William Manning, Cardi
nal Gilbons, Gen. John J. Pershing,
Major General Leonard Wood, Frank
lin K. Lane, and William Howard
Taft.
