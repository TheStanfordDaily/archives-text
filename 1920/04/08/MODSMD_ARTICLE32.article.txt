# "HUSKY" GUERENA LIKES SHOWING OF STANFORD CREW
## Coach Rogers to Give Men Finishing Touches From Now On 
### 
"Husky" Guerena, former Stanford
crew coach, who was largely respons
ible for the success of the Cardinal's
eight at Poughkeepsie in 1916, visited
the Redwood Estuary over the week
end and watched the line-ups being
sent through the paces. During the
practice, emphasis was laid on form
rather than speed, and Guerena stated
that he was very well pleased with
the progress that has been made by
all three of the crews. Though the
men were not timed, their form
showed that a fast eight will surely
he developed in the remaining two
weeks before the regatta.
The combined efforts of Coach Les
Rogers and his assistant, Roy King,
are rapidly putting the crews into
final shape. During the spring vaca
tion strenuous work-outs were held,
so that the finishing touches will oc
cupy the hulk of the coaches' time
until the regatta on April 24.
Sunday the varsity, second varsity,
and freshman crews took a twenty
five mile row. The line-up of the var
sity shell for the day was: Steinbeck,
stroke; McCormack, 7; Brown, 6;
McGillivary, 5; Captain Davis, 4;
Snow, 3; Cary, 2; and Jeffers, bow.
This was not a final choice of men for
this shell, but was merely the par
ticular grouping for the day. The
leading eight will not be chosen until
a day or two before the meet. The
other strong contestants for the shell
are: Olmstead, Brieson, Moore, Mc-
Kinnon, Adams, Tell, Wooster, and
Ells.
The freshmen have been making
fine progress under the rigid work
outs of the past two weeks and are
rapidly developing into a dangerous
aggregation for the Bruin Babes to
meete. Those rowing on the freshman
eight Sunday were: Lindstrom,
stroke; Helser, 7; Richardson, 6;
Bowes, 5; Loomis, 4; Rosenblum, 3;
Mattox, 2; and Hicks, bow.
