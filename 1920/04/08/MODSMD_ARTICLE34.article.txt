# ACKER GIVES TENTATIVE TRACK MEET ENTRIES
## Coach Ready For California Men in Freshman Meet Next Saturday 
### 
Art Acker, freshman track coach, yes
terday gave out a tentative list of the
entries for the meet Saturday afternoon
with the University of California.
Elliott, rated as the best middle-dis
tance and distance runner on the squad,
will run the mile and two-mile. His
times in these events in past perform
ances this season make him look like a
ten-point man. Williamson in the 440
and 880 is also expected to bring in a
generous contribution to the point col
umn. In the latter race he will have
close competition from his teammate
Thompson. Forester, Wright, and John
in the sprints, and Rice and Falk in the
hurdles, balance up an unusually strong
track team, while the field team appears
to be good enough to hold its own if
not win a majority of points in that de
partment.
