# MONTANA FOOTBALL COACH RESIGNS JOB
## 
### 
MISSOULA, Mont., April B.â€”
Bernie Bierman, former Minnesota
football luminary, and captain of the
1915 Gophers, will not return to the
University of Montana as football
coach next season. He gave no reason
for his decision when the announce
ment was made last week. Bierman
made a good showing at Montana with
rather weak material and was re
ported to have high standing with the
student body.
