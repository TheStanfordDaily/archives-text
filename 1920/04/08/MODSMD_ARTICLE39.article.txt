# WELTON STANFORD BEQUEST IS MADE PARTLY AVAILABLE
## Stanford University Residuary Legatee Gets 30,000 Pounds 
### 
The Board of Trustees of the Uni
versity recently received word from
Australia that 30,000 pounds of the be
quest of the late Thomas Welton Stan
ford has become available to the Uni
versity. Thomas Welton Stanford, the
younger brother of Leland Stanford, and
a benefactor of the University in a
variety of ways, made the University his
residuary legatee by his will. The Uni
versity expects to receive considerably
more than one-half million dollars when
the estate is finally settled and other
bequests are paid. Most of the property
was in real estate and it was through the
conversion of a portion of this real
estate into cash by the executors of his
will that the 30,000 pounds was made
available. The executors have been re
quested to deposit this 30,000 pounds at
interest in the bank of Australia to the
credit of the University since it is in
advisable with the present rates of ex
change to convert this sum into Ameri
can money at the present moment.
Thomas Welton Stanford, brother of
Leland Stanford and last survivor of
that generation, died August 28, 1918,
aged 86. He had been a trustee of the
University since 1893, and his first con
siderable gift to the University was the
old library building, which has recently
been remodeled and is now the admin
istration building. The money which he
devoted to this purpose was bequeathed
to him by Senator Stanford but he pre
ferred to devote it to University pur
poses. More recently he gave 100,000
dollars to the University with which was
built the art gallery which bears his
name. On different occasions he gave
the University a large number of very
fine paintings which now hang on the
walls of the museum and art gallery. A
gift which attracted considerable atten
tion was that of $50,000 as an endow
ment for research work in psychic
phenomena. He, himself, was a keen
student and investigator of these prob
lems and desired to make it possible for
research work to be conducted by care
fully trained men under the supervision
of the University. The trustees, there
fore, established the Thomas Welton
Stanford Fellowship for Psychic Re
search which lias been held continually
by Professor John Edgar Coover.
