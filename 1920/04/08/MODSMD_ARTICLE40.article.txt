in the teaching and commercial research
fields, after it became known that he
contemplated coming to Stanford, but
after visiting the campus recently, he
determined that the opportunity for
teaching in a congenial field and for
research work here over-balanced the
much larger pay that was offered him
in various eastern positions. One of
these positions insured his receiving at
least three times as much money as his
Stanford salary will amount to. Presi
de nt Wilbur and several older members
of the faculty scientific departments feel
that in Dr. Webster the University has
obtained a young man similar to those
who constituted the brilliant young fac
ulty of the early days of the University
and who have gained credit for them
selves and Stanford by their accomplish
ments here. Dr. Webster is still in this
ments here. Dr. Webster is still in his
thirties. He graduated from Harvard in
1910 and spent several years afterwards
teaching there and doing advanced work,
receiving his Ph. D. from the same in
stitution in 1913. He had just accepted
an appointment at the University of
Michigan when the United States en
tered the war. He immediately entered
war service and became a member of
the National Research Council, devot
ing himself especially to the study of
problems in the development of aeron
nautical instruments. In order to carry
on practical tests on these instruments
he qualified as an aviator, becoming a
lieutenant in the air service, and is now
a member of the Aeronautic Reserve.
He devised what arc unquestionably the
two best forms of drift indicator, these
instruments being especially important
in connection with bomb dropping. In
this service he was in the division under
Professor Milliken who held the rank of
colonel.
After he was demobilized he joined
the faculty of the Massachusetts Insti
tute of Technology in a combined teach
ing and research capacity and will com
plete the year there, coming to Stan
ford to take up his work here next Oc
tober.
