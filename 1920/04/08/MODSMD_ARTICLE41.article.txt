Harvard's famous "gold coast" has
been engulfed in the march of democ
racy, the university authorities hav
ing recently purchased Clavery, Ap
ley, and Weshmorlv Halls, formerly
privately owned dormitories main

This purchase extends the holdings
of the university in the Mount Au

all the formerly private owned dormi
tories are now under the control of the
university.
The athletic buildings and swim

the buildings have now been turned
over to the athletic association as
part of the athletic equipment.
