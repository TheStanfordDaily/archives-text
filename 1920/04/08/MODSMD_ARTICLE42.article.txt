# BRITISH COLLEGE IS SUPERIOR SAYS LASKI
## ENGLISHMAN IS KEENER Oxford Professor Admits Our Graduate Schools Are the Best 
### 
CAMBRIDGE, April B—The aver
age undergraduate at Oxford or Cain
bridge is far superior to the typical
American college student, while the
American graduate schools greatly sur
pass those of the English universities,
according to an article by Harold J.
Laski, lecturer in the Department of
History at the University, which ap
peared recently in the Anglo-American
number of the "Manchester Guardian."
"That almost 600 colleges, varying in
size from forty students to the 12,000
Columbia, should have the right to
grant degrees," writes Mr. Laski,
"would seem evidence of an enthusi
asm lacking in Great Britain. But
that is not, in fact, the case. The
number of really first-class colleges
is proportionately small; and the work
done in them, for at any rate the first
two years, does not go beyond the
work of the last two forms of a good
English public school. It is only in
the third and fourth years of his uni
versity education that the American
undergraduate can be compared with
the English student."
Radical Difference in Students
After describing the methods of
American universities, Mr. Laski con
tinues: "The result is a student and a
university radically different from the
English model. The American stu
dent, I should judge, has a wider range
of facts at his disposal than the Eng
lish undergraduate; but his thinking
apparatus is less keenly trained. His
teachers tend to become mere lec
turers whom he does not know outside
the class room. He is so hampered
by the number of lectures he must
attend that he has little time for inde
pendent thought. His reading is large
ly the reading necessary for his speci
fied courses; he has neither time nor
energy for exploration for its own
sake. There is no plethora of clubs
for discussion; when these exist they
are mainly social in their nature.
There is not the stimulus to origin
ality which a good man can get at
Oxford or Cambridge. On the other
hand, there is more equality of treat
ment; the passman does not fall into
the slough of ignorant content which
the English universities offer him. In
the result the average man fares bet
ter than he does in England, while
the progress of the man of genuine
capacity is sacrificed to this doubtful
relic of Jeffersonianism.
American Professor a Machine
"The result on the American profes
sor is very marked. Hp tends to be
come a mere lecturing machine, whose
inadequate income makes his leisure
a seedtime for the growth of text
books. He does not know his students
in the way in which an Oxford pro
fessor knows them. . . . The stu
dent does not come to his home.
"Nor must one neglect the great
oasee in the desert. Lecturers like
those of Haskins and Kittredge at Har
vard, of Farrand at Yale, of Morse
Stephens at California, of Gildersleeve
at Johns Hopkins, have marked a
great epoch in American education.
They have been something more than
careful digests of accessible informa
tion. There has gone into tham the
living blood of rich personality, and
the student is a different personality
for having heard them. And there
are special subjects, like psychology
and logic;, which are taught in Amer
ica with a skill and equipment unequal
led in England."

oasee in the desert. Lecturers like
those of Haskins and Kittredge at Har

great epoch in American education.
They have been something more than
careful digests of accessible informa

CAMBRIDGE, April B—The aver
age undergraduate at Oxford or Cain
bridge is far superior to the typical
American college student, while the
American graduate schools greatly sur
pass those of the English universities,
according to an article by Harold J.
Laski, lecturer in the Department of
History at the University, which ap
peared recently in the Anglo-American
number of the "Manchester Guardian."
"That almost 600 colleges, varying in
size from forty students to the 12,000
Columbia, should have the right to
grant degrees," writes Mr. Laski,
"would seem evidence of an enthusi
asm lacking in Great Britain. But
that is not, in fact, the case. The
number of really first-class colleges
is proportionately small; and the work
done in them, for at any rate the first
two years, does not go beyond the
work of the last two forms of a good
English public school. It is only in
the third and fourth years of his uni
versity education that the American
undergraduate can be compared with
the English student."
Radical Difference in Students
After describing the methods of
American universities, Mr. Laski con
tinues: "The result is a student and a
university radically different from the
English model. The American stu
dent, I should judge, has a wider range
of facts at his disposal than the Eng
lish undergraduate; but his thinking
apparatus is less keenly trained. His
teachers tend to become mere lec
turers whom he does not know outside
the class room. He is so hampered
by the number of lectures he must
attend that he has little time for inde
pendent thought. His reading is large
ly the reading necessary for his speci
fied courses; he has neither time nor
energy for exploration for its own
sake. There is no plethora of clubs
for discussion; when these exist they
are mainly social in their nature.
There is not the stimulus to origin
ality which a good man can get at
Oxford or Cambridge. On the other
hand, there is more equality of treat
ment; the passman does not fall into
the slough of ignorant content which
the English universities offer him. In
the result the average man fares bet
ter than he does in England, while
the progress of the man of genuine
capacity is sacrificed to this doubtful
relic of Jeffersonianism.
