CAMBRIDGE, Mass., April 8 â€”
Universities are the most enduring in
stitutions in the world, says Dr. A. L.
Lowell, president of Harvard.
"Did it ever occur to you that the
University of Paris has seen all the up
heavals that have taken place in
France and that have usually taken
place within the sound of the Sor
bonne, and has survived them all."
"Did it ever occur to you that Ox
ford and Cambridge have lived through
th War of the Roses and through the
English Revolution, and have con
tinued to be just as vital and just as
strong as they ever were before? Why
is that? It is because the university
really contributes to the highest civili
zation something that is eternal."
