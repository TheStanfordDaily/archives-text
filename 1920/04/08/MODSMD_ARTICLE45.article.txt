# FAMOUS SOPRANO SOON WILL PLEASE STANFORD AUDIENCE
## Amelita Galli-Curci Will Sing Pleasing Program Here April 29th 
### 
It is reported that Mme. Galli-Curci,
who is to appear in song-recital at As
cembly Hall, Stanford, on Thursday
night, April 29th, is having her tour for
1921 planned by her managers—Charles
L. Wagner and D. F. McSweeney, to

include England, and then possibly the
colonies. Now she wishes to complete
her big American and Canadian tour.
Her song recitals have made her ac
quainted with the masses of the Ameri
can public, and it is no unusual occur
rence for her to sing to fifteen or twenty
thousand people in a week. At the Hip
podrome a few days ago, there was an
audience of seven thousand, and New
Yorkers are not prone to worship at a
shrine unless one of wondrous beauty.
Mr. Healy has just been advised that
Howard E. Potter will represent the
Charles L. Wagner management, when
Mme. Galli-Curci makes her California
tour. A letter from Mr. Potter inti
mates that Mme. Galli-Curci's farewell
to New York was a distinct triumph, as
was her concert on Easter Sunday at the
big Chicago Auditorium.
Mme. Galli-Curci will arrive in San
Francisco a few days in advance of her
Stanford concert, so that she will have
several days of relaxation, in which to
enjoy the springtime hospitality of Cali
fornia.

Young Boy (to mother) —I am going
to a party tonight; shall I wash lor a
high or a low collar?


Mme. Galli-Curci
