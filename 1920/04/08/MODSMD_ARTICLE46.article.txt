# HARVARD HOOVER CLUB DECLARES PRINCIPLES
## 
### 
BOSTON, Mass., April 8. â€”The
Executive Committee of the Hoover
League of Harvard has adopted the
following declaration of principles:
The Hoover League of Harvard is
organized to help bring about the no
mination and election of Herbert
Hoover as President of the United
States.
The members of the League believe,
as do multitudes of Americans through
out the country, that Mr. Hoover is
better qualified for the Presidency
than any other man in the field. No
other candidate excells him in exe
cutive capacity, administrative experi
ence, leadership, and the ability to se
lect big men and work with them.
No other candidate is his equal or any
thing like his equal in knowledge of
economic conditions, in understanding
of world politics and world trade, in
breadth of vision and in the ability
to translate liberal ideals into prac
tice. He does not repeat popular
catch-words, evade issues, and utter
vaguely patriotic generalities; he
takes loyalty for granted as every

reasonable American should, keeps his
eyes on the real political and economic:
issues of the new day.and talks clear
ly, explicitly, and sensibly.
His support is not confined to any
one party; therefore the Hoover
League of Harvard will enroll mem
bers of the University who believe in
Herbert Hoover, regardless of their
party affiliation.
The League will aim to crystallize
within the University a sentiment
which is now seeking expression at
Harvard as in every other American
community; the sentiment that at a
time when the old issues which have
traditionally separated our two poli
tical parties have disappeared, and
new issues and problems confront us,
the election of the wisest, broadest,
and most intelligent leader in the
United States is to be striven for
above all else. Without question, that
leader is Herbert Hoover.
