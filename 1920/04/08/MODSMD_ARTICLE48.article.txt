### 
After the music lovers of Stanfora
have had the opportunity this* season of
listening to a splendid varietj of musi
cians. including the symphony orchestra
and many singers, on Monday evening
It is a program by the Flonzaley Quar
tet, composed of only string instruments,
another type of concert will he given,
and lead by Adolfo Betti. The concert
will be in the Assembly Hall.
When telling of the struggles of the
quartet in their rise to fame, Betti said.
"For a string quartet to achieve fame is
a much more difficult thing than for a
solo virtuoso or for an orchestra. The
obstacles to be overcome are none the
less real for being more subtle and in
tangible. The reason successful quar
tets are rarer than orchestras or soloists,
of the same celebrity, lies in the intricate
and delicate form of the quartet. I
think it is far more difficult for four
artists to work together in perfect uni
son. accord and sympathy than for a
hundred musicians under a gifted con
ductor; while the individual virtuoso is
free to travel his own chosen path with
out hindrance or need to consider any
one but himself."
