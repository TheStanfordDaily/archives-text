## 
### 
The age-old problem of "Who's
loony low?" was solved on the ball
diamond yesterday afternoon. The
correct answer to thiH knotty question
is —Stamp, that is, Student Manager
W. M. Stamp, '20.
It all happened when Stamp yester
day morning announced that the Stan
ford ball club would meet St. Mary's
in the afternoon. The announcement
came a little late but the doughty
Student Manager didn't let any grass
grow under hia feet until he had seen
the news was spread all over the
campus. One of his henchmen spent
the noon hour phoning the good news
to all the fraternity and sorority
houses.
After a few hours of this kind of
strenuous effort, the scheduled time
for the Stanford-St. Mary's game came
around, and the fans started streaming
into the ball park. There they waited
for the St. Mary's team to appear.
But it didn't and that put Stamp
to work thinking. And in the midst
of this complicated process, Stamp
made a horrible discovery that tele
scoped his train of thought!
He had announced the wrong date!
The Stanford-St. Mary's baseball game
was billed for a week from Wednes
day, not yesterday. The crowd went
home to the tur.e of Mr. Stamp buy
ing cigars all around.
