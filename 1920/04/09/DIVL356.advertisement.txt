HIRAM JOHNSON
FOR PRESIDENT
The formal announcement from
Washington of the candidacy of Sen
ator Hiram W. Johnson for President
is merely the official confirmation of
the announcement already made by his
friends in California. It begins the
national campaign, and it announces
the policy of that campaign as an ap
peal to the people rather than to the
politicians.
When the candidacy was first an
nounced in California, the League of
Nations issue was not yet in the fore
ground, and Senator Johnson's spon
sors, who differed among themselves
on this issue, avoided all reference
to it, hoping that long before election
it would he settled and relegated to
history. Since then it has become
the great unknown factor in the situa
tion. and Senator Johnson has been
the leading national opponent of a
policy which the majority of his Cali
fornia friends and constituents favor.
H6 took this position after full con
sideration and with no illusions as
to its difficulties and embarassments,
There are therefore no misunderstand
ings, either way. Nevertheless, with
the assent of those who differ with
him on this question, but who agree
! with him oil others and who have
loyal confidence in him personally, he
will doubtless have the delegation
from California, unopposed. As a
practical problem, the question will
doubtless be settled soon, by the rati
