The coronation of the King and the
Queen is to be the opening event of
the carnival, when the ruling pair
will be presented with the ruling
specter and an especially constructed
throne at the football field. The roy
al pair will also open the dance at
the gymnasium, and will give official
sanction to each of the carnival events.
The best and most imaginative of
campus and possibly San Francisco
designers will be secured to develop
the proper costumes for the reigning
couple, and the committee states that
a great deal of time and money is
bing spent in insuring an elaborate
royal array for the King and Queen
and their courtiers.
