# STANFORD BABES WILL MIX WITH U.C. NINE
## Freshman Nine Will Meet the Blue and Gold in Attempt to Even Up Series 
### 
In, an effort to even up the series with
a victory, Coacli Evans will take the
freshman baseball nine to Berkeley to
morrow morning; to meet the California
freshmen in the second game between
the two teams.
With the loss of Gray, the mainstay of
the pitching staff, and Outfielder Welsh,
the Cardinal first-year men have' had
their defense seriously weakened. Ev
ans uncovered a twirling possibility yes
terday, however, who may he of assist
ance in the task of humbling Coach
Zamlock's proteges from across the bay.
This newcomer is a portsider and in a
few innings of practice against the var
sity yesterday afternoon, showed that
he had some good stuff on the ball.
He will be held in readiness to relieve
Schwartz, who will probably start the
game Saturday.
The rest of the line-up will be as fol
lows: G. Green, c.: Patterson, lb.;
Peavy, 2b.; C. Green, ss.; Heckendorf,
3b. The out field will be selected from
Carver, Rogers, Hawkins, Edwards,
Clinch, and R. Green.
