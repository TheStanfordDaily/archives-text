# THE
						FUTURE OF THE ATHLETIC CARNIVAL
## 
### 
fTHE annual athletic carnival is one of Stanford's traditions and in years
to come will be even more endeared to the fun-loving hearts of the
campus. The future of the Spring Carnival, however, largely lies in the
hands of those who plan each individual carnival and they should recognize
their responsibility. Last year's carnival was severely criticiser by faculty
outsiders, and some members of the student body. A number of concessions,
many felt, were not up to the social standards of the campus and it was
especially unfortunate that Dean Harriet Bradford made particular mention
of the Carnival as being no credit to Stanford women. In this statement
lies the warning.
Plans are well under way for the Spring Carnival, April 24, concessions
have been determined pretty well, and the carnival promises to be a brilliant
affair. King Hilarity and Queen Merriment will lead dignity as well as a
little comedy to the occasion. The king and queen will typify the Mardi
Gras spirit and the campus will eagerly follow them.
If the coming carnival fails to meet the standards of the campus this
year, this carnival undoubtedly will be the last one. The executive com
mittee will watch the general plan of the concessions as closely as possible
but they cannot assume all of the responsibility for the tone of the con
cessions. Every man and woman who participates should keep vigilant
guard against anything which might be considered improper. Details often
make a concession objectionable or pleasing. Stanford men and women are
capable of appreciating good, clean amusement which will assure the future
of the Carnival. We have an obligation to meet and in the coming carnival
Stanford students can prove themselves.

ONE would think that California and Stanford would be squarely split
on the Hoover-Johnson fight inasmuch as Johnson is a California man and
Hoover is a son of the Stanford Red. But Hoover's backing at the State
Institution compares favorably with the strength of the Johnson element
there, while here on the Farm, it certainly cannot be said that the campus is
100 per cent Hoover-strong.
