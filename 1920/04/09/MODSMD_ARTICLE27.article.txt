# CARNIVAL COMMITTEE SUBMITS CONCESSIONS
## Spring Carnival Promises To Be Brilliant and Very Entertaining 
### 
Plans for the Spring Carnival to be
held April 24 011 the Football Field
have been submitted by PI R. Martin,
chairman of the executive committee.
The Stanford campus will be offered
every kind of amusement from the
old-time "Forty-nine Camp" to the last
word in the Fashion Groups
are working well together and the
whole affair promises to be the most
brilliant that Stanford has ever seen.
Several groups on the campus have
not submitted plans to the Carnival
Committee as yet and they are urged
to do so at once as the committee is
■anxious to have everything organized
immediately 011 account of the short
time which is left to perfect details.
Even a larger number of variety
of concessions have been planned than
were offered at the carnival last year.
Sequoia with offer "Trixie, the Edu
cated Horse and Other Attractions,"
which promises to be one of the draw
ing cards of the evening. A "Chinese
Den" will satisfy the longing for the
unusual and the Hot Dog Stand will
offer satisfaction for the inner crav
ing. Ram's Head's Public Show is
thought to have unusual possibilities
as this does not break the rule con
•erning public initiations. Ram's
will at last have its fling almost
<out restriction.
