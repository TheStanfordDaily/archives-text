# Northern Crew Coach Says Stanford Must Improve Form to Win
## 
### 
SEATTLE, Wash., March 16. â€”Crew
Coach Ed Leader is of the opinion
that the regatta this year will be the
scene of one of the hardest craw races
that the coast has ever witnessed.
He bases his prediction on informa
tion from the southern colleges, and
from personal observations made dur
ing the race with Stanford and Cali
fornia last year.
"The change in the California stroke
during the past two years is remark
able," said Coach Leader. "We went
south last year believing that Stanford
would be by far the hardest boat to
beat. On paper they were the best
crew of the three. They outweighed
Washington eight pounds to the man,
and besides had twice the number of
varsity men that either of the other
boats carried. But as soon as I had
seen the two crews in action I knew
that it was California and not Stan
ford whom we had to watch.
"Under the coaching of Ben Wal
lis, a Yale crew man, California had
abandoned their old stroke entirely
and had adopted a stroke so much like
our own that the race became a con
test of form and endurance instead of
a contest of strokes. California had
always rowed a very fast and short
stroke wliic-h usually gave them the
lead for the first mile, but which tired
the men so much that they usually
fell behind in the second mile, and
finished many lengths behind the other
crews. Now they are rowing a
long, slow stroke which puts them 011
a par with us. Last year's race show
ed the result. California took the
lead l'rom the first but was unable
to hold it to the end. The shells were
so nearly together that the men did
not know who had won until they
got back to the boathouse. Stanford
lost by forty seconds. Though the
men fought hard their form was so
poor that they had no chance. They
were splashing water at every stroke,
and were unable to get together in
the rhythm that every crew must have
to win
"Bui whether Stanford comes north
this year or not the students here can
look forward to a final race. Unless
Stanford improves rapidly she will
have little chance of beating California
and the race here will probably be
between the two best crews. I still
hope Stanford will live xxp to her
contract and come north."
