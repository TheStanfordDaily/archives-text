# VETERANS TO RECEIVE VOCATIONAL TRAINING
## 
### 
All men at Stanford University or
elsewhere who are receiving compensa
tion from the United States govern
ment for injuries incurred during serv
ice in the late war, are requested to
establish contact with either the San
Francisco or the local office of the Fed
eral Hoard for Vocational Education.
The Federal Government wishes to aid
them by providing training that they
may be able to pursue their civil occupa
tions in the most efficient manner. The
Federal Hoard will train these men in
any trade or profession which the offi
cials of the board deem plausible. The
great task of establishing personal con
tact with each of the disabled may be
readily appreciated. That the designat
ed men may be placed in training as soon
as possible is the desire of the govern
ment. To accomplish this aim their co
operation is essential. Professor Proc
tor. the local representative of the Fed
eral Board, will tfive each case his im
mediate attention.
