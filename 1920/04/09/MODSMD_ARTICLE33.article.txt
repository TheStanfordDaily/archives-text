# JORDAN CONTRIBUTES IMPORTANT MATERIAL TO SCIENTIFIC WORK
## 
### 
Dr. David Starr Jordan, long a world
authority on fishes, dead as well as liv
ing, has lately given special attention
to the field of fossil ichthyology. Late
ly he has made a notable addition by
laying before the scientific world sixty
hitherto unknown species of the Mio
cene Age. These were bay fishes from
Southern California and number six
times the total that was known of
Miocene bony fishes in America before
Dr. Jordan's work. From America
there were before this only ten kinds
of bony fishes known from this period
although some sixty kinds of sharks
had been identified in the Carolina
region and twenty in California.
This collection is on exhibit at the
Art Gallery this week.
Stanford's collection of fossil fishes
of this age is now larger than that
of all other institutions put together,
numbering about 400 individuals. One
item in the Stanford collection is the
largest single slab of fossil fishes ever
obtained. It measures 8 feet by 4
feet in one solid unbloken slab. This
particular specimen comes from the
Lompoc deposit which lies in Santa
Barbara county within an angle on
the north side of the Sierra Santa
Ynez.
Dr. Jordan's interest in this par
ticular field was aroused some years
ago when Dr. Gilbert brought' him
some fossil specimens which he had
found in that part of the state. This
led to more intensive and extensixe in
vestigations, the first results of which
have just been published. They found
about forty different kinds of fossils
new to science in these first studies,
for the most part young fishes that
had crept into the bays around the
archipelago which in prehistoric time,
covered the greater portion of Los
Angeles and Orange counties.
