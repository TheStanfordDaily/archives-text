# Mount Holyoke College Starts Endowment Fund Campaign
## 
### 
Mount Holyoke College, following
the example of Bryn Mawr, has
launched an endowment campaign.
Alumnae and former students have
been organized throughout the coun
try for raising a fund of $3,000,000
two thi ds of which is to he used in
raising the salaries of the faculty and
the remainder for a building fund.
Mount Holyoke is the oldest educa
tional institution for women of its
kind in the country. It was opened in
1837 at South Hadley, Mass., by Miss
Mary Lyon, as Mount Holyoke Semi
nary. Miss Lyon toured New Eng
land for three years before 1837 to
obtain the necessary funds. In 1888
Mount Holyoke was incorporated as
a college.
Until just before the war its en
dowment fund of a little more than
$2,000,000 was sufficient for the needs
of the institution, but it is felt by
alumnae that the institution cannot do
its work unless it is able to retain its
teaching staff by giving a substantial
salary increase. An increase of ap
proximately 50 per cent for members
of the teaching staff is planned with
the attainment of the endowment
fund. Mount Holyoke suffered a se
vere loss in 1917 when Williston Hall,
its science building, was destroyed by
lire. Valuablo apparatus and research
records on which some of the faculty
had spent most of their lives were
destroyed. Through an additional
endowment it is expected that this
hall can be replaced by a modern and
properly equipped science building.
Mount Holyoke houses all of its un
dergraduate body on the campus, so

that a new dormitory is urgently
needed to care for the increased en
rollment.
