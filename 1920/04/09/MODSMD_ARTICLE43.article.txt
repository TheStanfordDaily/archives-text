The Flonzaley Quartet was orga
nized over sixteen years ago by Ed
ward J. deCoppet, with an aim of im
personal musical excellence; not in
dividual distinction but a body of four
musicians serving essentially as one.
Daniel Gregory Mason recently said
that the pride with which deCoppet
always spoke of 'our artists' was
justified most, of all by the fact that
he, too, was an artist; the Flonzaley
Quartet was his work of art. His
method of creating what he was after
was all of genuine art; indefatigable
experiment, proceeding by trial and
error, requiring endless thought, and
extending through a long series of
years.
The quartet's organization was only
changed once when Ugo Ara withdrew
in 1917 for war service in italy. Louis
Bailey has taken his place and every
one agrees that the excellence of the
playing of the Flonzaleys has not
been impaired by the change.
The program to be presented at the
Assembly Hall includes compositions
by Mozart, Dvorak, and Tschaikow
i sky.
