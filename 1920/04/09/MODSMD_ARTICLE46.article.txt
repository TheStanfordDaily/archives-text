a woman needs is knowledge. Slu- must

A more fundamental kind of political
education must be given women in their
early training. More women must be
given higher education to supply wom

need and are flocking to the universities
and colleges in large numbers, said Miss
Taft. They desire to get an education

will overcome the provincial viewpoint of
women and will enable them to see ne

The greatest effect of granting the
franchise to women will be the creation
of a disinterested class of citizens who
will follow political life without being
attached to it professionally. The mass
of men voters bave been too busy to
give much time to political questions
and have placed them in the hands of. a
professional political group. Women
will find time to follow out the smaller
interests and details of community work
that the men have overlooked.
