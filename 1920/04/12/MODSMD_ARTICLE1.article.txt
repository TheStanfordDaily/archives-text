# INTRAMURAL NINES OPEN SEASON ON UNIVERSITY FIELDS
## Six Teams From First Three Leagues Meet in Opening Games of Series 
### 
Six teams start the intramural base
ball season this afternoon when the
first two teams in leagues one, two,
and three meet on the several diam
onds of the university. The nines from
the various organizations on the
campus have been practicing hard and
there promises to be some fast games
on the local fields. Some of the teams
have developed good mound artists
and this afternoon will probably bring
out a good deal of unknown talent in
the baseball line.
Beta Theta Pi and Encina (first
fioor), clash in the first game of league
one on the rugby field; A. T. O. meets
Encina (second floor) on the turf, and
Phi Kappa Psi tangles with the Un
attached (off campus) on the soccer
field. The faculty field will be open
for practice this afternoon and on Fri
day afternoon, but a four-game sched
ule on the other three afternoons fills
up all the available diamonds. Games
scheduled for tomorrow are: 1). K. E.
vs. Sequoia (second); Alpha Delta Phi
vs. Japanese Club; Sequoia (third) vs.
Delta Chi, and Theta Xi vs. Phi Delta
Theta. All the games are timed to
start at 4 o'clock and it is necessary
that everyone be on time in order that
games may be finished before 6 o'clock.
Eighteen games will be played each
ween of the season thus playing every
one of the thirty-six teams one every
week. The games will be played on
the same plan as in the basketball
season and the winners of each league
will meet to decide the championship
of the university. The schedule for
the ensuing week will be given in the
Friday issue of the D. P. A., and the
games for the next day in the issue
of the previous evening. The bulletin
board in the gymnasium will show the
diamond upon which the games are
to be played.
