# STANFORD EIGHTS BEGIN FINAL WEEK IN RACE PRACTICE
## Crews Will Work on Speed; Go North on Thursday To Race Saturday 
### 
The Varsity eight enters on its final
week of practice today. The crew
goes north on Thursday to take a
couple of days practice on the Oakland
Estuary where they will race Satur
day. Captain "Cash" Davis is back in
the boat after a lay-off of several days
due to a strained tendon in his wrist.
He is in good shape now and the slight
strain has been completely rested.
Yesterday the varsity and freshman
eights worked out in short spurts and
speed tests. This sort of work will
constitute that done by the crews from
now until the time of the race. In
the speed tests yesterday the freshmen
stood up very well against the varsity
and showed much better form than
has characterized their work so far.
The crews are nearly certain of their
positions in the boats now with the
exception of two cases. McCormack
and Snow are still changing around
between three and seven, and McKin
non is giving Carey a hard fight for a
berth at two. McKinnon will row to
day.
The boat builder has been overhaul
ing the shells the last week in pre
paration for the races and everything
is ready now for the northern trip
on Thursday. The varsity and fresh
man squads will probably leave on
an early train on Thursday morning
in order that they may have a work
out in the afternoon on the estuary
at Oakland.
