the high jump Muller defeated Howell
of Stanford by three quarters of an
inch with a leap of 6 feet 2% inches,
after spirited competition.
The Stanford track men won every
race with the exception of the 880 and
100. Elliott broke the tape in the mile
and soon after repeated in the two-mile,
finishing with a sensational sprint in
which he passed every runner in the last
two hundred yards. Elliott tied with
Muller of California for high point win
near, each taking two firsts.
Forster pulled a surprise in the 220
when lie nosed out the California sprin
ters in the last ten yards. Falk and
Rice were both pushed hard in the
hurdle events, but alternated for first
and third in each race. Williamson and
Wright finished first and second in the
440 from a large field of competitors.
In the field events California almost
made a clean sweep, taking every place
in the broad jump and javelin and al
lowing Stanford only eleven points.
