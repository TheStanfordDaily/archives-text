# STANFORD OUTFIELD BOOTS CONTEST TO CALIFORNIA BEARS
## Wayland, Kline, and Mitchell Hand Series to Bruins On Silver Platter 
### 
After getting off to a flying start by
registering three runs in the first in
ning the Stanford Varsity went down
to defeat before the superior University
of California clan Saturday afternoon
by a count of 10 to 7, thereby losing the
series.
With the exception of the first inning
Stanford showed no flash in the pan,
and Carl Zainlock's Bears had every
thing their own way.
Bonchead baseball was the main rea
son for the Cardinal submission.
Mitchell, Wayland and Kline, conceded
to be fast outergardeners, deprived
.Stanford of its chance to win.
Wayland muffed easy flies and al
lowed a commonplace single to trickle
through his legs, and the drive went for
a three-cushion play. Mitchell retrieved
the ball, while Wayland swelled the
spectator ranks.
Kline booted an easy fly in his en
thusiasm to dispatch the ball to the
plate and choke off a tally. He pum
meled a three-base hit to deep right in
the first inning, however, paving the
way for a trio of runs.
Draper started on the mound for Stan
ford, and had he been given any sup
port, the locals would have won the
game. He worked nicely, considering
the wretched support he received.
Newland, who followed him, did not
get enough support to keep a chorus
girl in talcum powder. California hit
him with reckless abandon, lacing out
bingle after bingle.
After Coach Evans initiated him to
the derrick, Sam Briggs was called to
the scene. He pitched good ball and
registered a hit and free transportation
in two trips to the pentagon.
McTfenry, a sidewheeler. started for
the Bears. He was yanked after walk
ing three men, allowing a Texas leag-
tier and Kline's third hassock swat.
Ellison, who worked on the mound
after McHenry's dismal failure, per
formed like an iron man with the ex
ception of one inning, when he was a
little wild. He contributed to his team's
victory with two clean-hits.
The opposition stole Bundy's shoes.
Every time a runner reached first, it
was as good as a two-base hit. Bundy
suffered a split linger in the seventh in
ning.
The series is oyer, for which all are
thankful.

McTfenry, a sidewheeler. started for
the Bears. He was yanked after walk
ing three men, allowing a Texas leag-

Ellison, who worked on the mound

Two-base hit, Works; three-base hit,
Kline. First on balls, off Draper 2, off
Newland 2, off McHcnry 3, off Elli
son 2, off Briggs 1. Struck out. by
Draper 3, by Briggs 1, by Ellison 5.
After getting off to a flying start by
registering three runs in the first in
ning the Stanford Varsity went down
to defeat before the superior University
of California clan Saturday afternoon
by a count of 10 to 7, thereby losing the
series.
With the exception of the first inning
Stanford showed no flash in the pan,
and Carl Zainlock's Bears had every
thing their own way.
Bonchead baseball was the main rea
son for the Cardinal submission.
Mitchell, Wayland and Kline, conceded
to be fast outergardeners, deprived
.Stanford of its chance to win.
Wayland muffed easy flies and al
lowed a commonplace single to trickle
through his legs, and the drive went for
a three-cushion play. Mitchell retrieved
the ball, while Wayland swelled the
spectator ranks.
Kline booted an easy fly in his en
thusiasm to dispatch the ball to the
plate and choke off a tally. He pum
meled a three-base hit to deep right in
the first inning, however, paving the
way for a trio of runs.
Draper started on the mound for Stan
ford, and had he been given any sup
port, the locals would have won the
game. He worked nicely, considering
the wretched support he received.
Newland, who followed him, did not
get enough support to keep a chorus
girl in talcum powder. California hit
him with reckless abandon, lacing out
bingle after bingle.
After Coach Evans initiated him to
the derrick, Sam Briggs was called to
the scene. He pitched good ball and
registered a hit and free transportation
in two trips to the pentagon.
McTfenry, a sidewheeler. started for
the Bears. He was yanked after walk

tier and Kline's third hassock swat.
