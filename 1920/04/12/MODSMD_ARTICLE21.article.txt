# GLEE CLUB CONCERT PROVES BIG SUCCESS
## 
### 
Success did not leave the Stanford
Glee Club when they returned from their
southern trip, for Saturday night's con
cert brought home to many people that
which has been highly complimented by
southern critics and presses. Congratu
lations are due to Warren D. Allen, di
rector of the Glee Club, for his achieve
ment in turning out one of the best
clubs the University lias ever had.
Not only was their big hit due to the
club's chorus, but also to the individual
members, the stunt man, and the ten
piece jazz orchestra. L. L. Seib, '22,
the club's comedian, met with great
favor, lip first impersonated a Hebrew,
and with equal ability lie represented a
small girl. His true and original wit
with his perfect interpretation brought
the house to pleasing applause.
Each and every song sung by the club
showed perfect preparation, and no dis
cords or lack of time were evident. The
orchestra also was successful with its
number. Taking the concert as a whole
there is only one thing to be said, and
that is it "got by" and "got by big."
After the concert many campus queen
ers enjoyed the dance at the Women's
Clubhouse. Music was furnished by the
Glee Clul)'s orchestra.
