# NEXT SATURDAY AND STANFORD LOYALTY
## 
### 
/CHARACTER is formed along certain general lines and there are few quali-
ties which should be inherent in most of the human race. Of all these
generalities loyalty is one of the most important and a quality which often
dies in the hurried rush after money in the modern world. Loyalty has al
ways been one of the watchwords of Stanford men and women. Athletic
teams have gone to victory before overwhelming odds because the flame of
the Stanford Red burned within them and those who backed the team.
When the University lay in ruins after the earthquake, Stanford loyalty rose
again and cariied the burden. Loyalty makes tradition and carries the Stan
for spirit from one generation to another. It is instinctive and cannot be
forced but Stanford men and women always have it.
Next Saturday the test of loyalty will be given again. In the. morning
two crews will go out to represent the Cardinal. In the afternoon our track
men will appear on the oval at California. Whether victory will come to us
again or not is a question, but not nearly so important a one as whether or
not we are going to back these men as students of Stanford should. The
trip to California takes the better part of a day, but it is time well spent.
The California rooting section has always been one of the sights of the meet
and the Cardinal rooters ought to furnish lively competition. It is still early
in the week. Every man and woman who possibly can should make up their
minds to go. Loyalty is one of the most inspiring things in the world.
Stanford enthusiasm will come to the front next Saturday and we should
make it worthy of the name of the University. *
