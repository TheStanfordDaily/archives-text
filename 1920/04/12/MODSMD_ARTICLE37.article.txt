## 
### 
C. J. Crobaugh, '20>, P. F. Erickson,
'21, W. H. Miller, '21, and T. E. Bowen,
'23, were selected by Coach McClintock
last Friday from about twenty try
outees who contested for places on the
debating team which clashes with Oc
cidental College and the University
of Southern California, on May 14th
and 15th.
The men chosen to represent the
Cardinal in Southern California this
spring have a busy month before them.
They must prepare to meet Occidental
College on May 14, to discuss the
question, "Resolved; That the United
States should become a mandatory
to Mexico," and on the following night
they will debate some other phase of
the Mexican problem with the Uni
versity of Southern California.
Both the southern colleges have
proven to be strong in forensic activi
ties, and in view of the fact that the
Stanford men must meet representa
tives of both universities, the local
team will have their work cut .out
for them for a few weeks.
