## A 						Message From Mayor Rolph of San Francisco to the People of California. 
### 
Mayor James Rolph, Jr., cabled yes
terday from Honolulu his felicitations
011 that result to the headquarters.
His message is as follows:
The remarkable victory of Sena
tor Johnson in the Michigan primary
demonstrates that he is the people's
choice for the Presidency.
I am confident that the Republican
national convention will obey the plain
mandate of the Republican electors
and will not make the mistake of per
mitting any groups of politicans to
thwart the will of the people, on whose
votes the party must rely 011 election
day.
Every Californian ought to do every
thing in his power to secure the nomi
nation of California's foremost citizen.
For the first time in its history Cali
fornia has an opportunity to elect one
of its sons to the Presidency." Let
us not permit any division among the
people of California to imperil that
opportunity.
It is obvious that Hoover will not be
nominated by the convention, even in
the event that he captured the Cali
fornia delegation, so that the net re
sult of a defeat of Johnson by Hoover
in California would be to prevent the
nomination of any Californian.
Hiram W. Johnson should be the
unanimous choice of the Republicans
of the State which he has served so
well. â€”Stanford Johnson Republican
Club.
