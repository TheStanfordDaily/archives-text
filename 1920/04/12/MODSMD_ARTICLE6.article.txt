# CALIFORNIA BABES TAKE SERIES FROM CARDINAL FRESHMEN
## 
### 
California's freshman baseball team
clearly established its supremacy over
the Stanford first-year nine by winning
the second game of the series last Sat
urday by a score of 12 to 0. The con
test was played on the Berkeley dia
mond and ended the season for the
Cardinal babes.
Schwartz weakened in the first inning
and allowed three Blue and Gold men
to cross the plate. He was replaced by
Rogers. California scored four tallys
in the second and then remained inactive
until the seventh, when they counted
five more.
O'Neil twirled the entire game for the
Bruin Cubs, and held Stanford to three
hits, while his team-mates were gar
nering eighteen bingles from the com
bined deliveries of Schwartz and Rogers.
The result of this game came as a
surprise to freshman supporters, as the
babes were considered almost on a par
with rivals from across the bay,
after the close game of the week be
fore, in which ten innings were re
quired to down Coach Evans' men.
