THE TURKISH
CIGARETTE
Y ou can throw any kind of
* light on Murad, and find
them 100 pure Turkish
tobacco, the world's most famous
tobacco for cigarettes. It is this
famous tobacco that makes Murad
the famous cigarette.
"You can't make a silk purse out of a
sow's ear." Neither can you make a real
enjoyable cigarette out of any other than
Turkish tobacco.
People! — listen to this talk — it's all for
your good. It's your money you're spending.
It is true that "ordinary" cigarettes cost
a trifle less.
Judge for yourself—!
