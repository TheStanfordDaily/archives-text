Returns of the first day's balloting on

races for the two positions to be hotly
contested. F. H. Bennett, '19, and Miss
Mary Tuthill, '20, are the leaders fol
lowing today's voting. Returns will be
published from day to day until the win

A Spring Carnival Cup will be award
ed by the Carnival King and Queen to
the concession that best fulfills their re
quirements of originality, financial re
turn, popularity, and attractiveness. The
trophy will be a handsome silver cup,
and its presentation will be one of the
features of the Carnival.
So far twenty concessions have been
entered in the Carnival. E. R. Martin.
18, chairman of the committee, reports
that there are still places left for ten
more booths. Two weeks remain to pre
pare for the event which will be held 011
the evening of April 23 on the football
field and in Encina gymnasium.
Of the concessions perhaps the most
novel entered yet is that of Ram's Head
Society. This society will put on a
Junior Opera is capsule form. The
management of this tabloid show will
be under the direction of R. E. Mc-
Conaughy, '21.
Prominent Stanford swimmers of both

comic and fancy aquatic stunts.
Lighting arrangements for the Carni
val have just been completed. Members
of the Electrical Engineering society
have planned to install centrally located
flood lights with auxiliary strings. These
will play streams of colored lights over
the carnival revelers on the football
field and will be one of the largest con
tributing factors in spreading the car
nival spirit. *

features of the Carnival.
So far twenty concessions have been
entered in the Carnival. E. R. Martin.

that there are still places left for ten
more booths. Two weeks remain to pre

flood lights with auxiliary strings. These
will play streams of colored lights over
the carnival revelers on the football
field and will be one of the largest con
tributing factors in spreading the car
nival spirit. *
