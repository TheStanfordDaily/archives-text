## 
### 
"The Theory of Advertising" was ex
plained by A. C. Haskins, Advertising
Manager of the Albers Milling and Man
ufacturing Company, the Adver
tising Class yesterday morning.
The first important factor of adver
tising, lie said, is to announce the com
modity for sale to the readers of maga
zines and newspapers. The second fac
tor is to allow the ultimate consumer to
gain some knowledge of the article that
he wishes to buy. The third factor of
advertising is to accumulate profits for
the company that is advertising.
Haskins said that the single impres
sion was the only way of getting an idea
across to the readers. The greatest trag
edy of advertising in his mind is the
use of so many commonplace methods
of advertising when there are so many
novel ways that might be used. The lo
cation of the advertisement in the paper
or magazine is one of the important
features of the work.
There is so much advertising in use
that if it were strung out it would en
circle the world seven times. Only one
per cent of this advertising brings in
returns.
This was the third of a series of lec
tures by men who are authorities on ad
vertising.
