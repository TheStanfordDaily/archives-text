# ST. MARY'S NINE MEETS CARDINAL VARSITY TOMORROW
## Oakland Team is Reputed to Be One of Strongest In Bay District 
### 
St. Mary's varsity will come to Stan
ford tomorrow to engage the Cardinal
baseball nine in battle. Even though de
feated by the California team. Stanford
still has a chance to win the conference
series.
The Varsity has settled down to hard
practice after the defeat last Saturday,
and may hit its proper stride during the
remainder of the season.
St. Mary's always puts a strong ag
gregation on the field and will come here
with expectation of a victory over the
Cardinal. From comparative scores, the
Oakland institution will have the edge
on Stanford, having beaten Olympic
Club nine, which has in turn won from
both California and Coach Evans' ath
letes.
Student activity cards will admit stu
dents to the gamp, which will be called
at 3:3(). The admission to outsiders
will be fifty cents.
