# HOOVER FOR PRESIDENT
## 
### 
/CALIFORNIA is faced with the problem of choosing between two native sons
in the presidential primaries. Upon her decision will largely depend the
chances of either one of the candidates for the Republican nomination in
June. Such a situation has never been seen before in the political history
of the country. The West is taking on a new aspect in national affairs and
the time has now come when the West can prove her right to political in
fluence by a sane and wise decision.
Herbert C. Hoover has had an exceptional opportunity in the past few
years to prove his ability in domestic as well as foreign affairs. Stanford
is remarkably fortunate in that the man of the hour looks toward Stanford
as his Alma Mater and his home. On account of these facts, Stanford has
an unusual opportunity to back the man whose record has fitted him better
for the position of President of the United States than any other candidate.
Hoover has the knowledge of foreign affairs, European diplomacy, and do
mestic problems which face the nation today. The popular support which
Hoover has inspired all over the country, regardless of party, is significant
of the confidence which Hoover's remarkable war record has developed.
In past presidential elections, it is interesting to note tlje marked influ
ence which the universities of such men as Taft and Roosevelt have had in
active campaigning. The opportunity has now come to a western university
for the first time and the movement has now come when the men and women
of Stanford must decide whether or not they are going to stand by this son
of the Stanford Red. The formation of the Hoover Club on the campus has
given us a working nucleus. The brunt of the work will fall on the organizers
but their enthusiasm will spread and the larger percentage of the student
body can become effective units in the Hoover campaign,
Tomorrow night, Thomas Reed, Professor of Political Science at the
University of California, will address an open meeting of the Hoover Club.
All those members of the student body who have not made up their minds
either for or against Hoover, should inform themselves as to Hoover's plat
form and fitness as a candidate for the presidency and it is hardly necessary
to urge those members of the Hoover Club to attend. Opportunity has come
to the gates of Stanford and Stanford loyalty will come to the front tomor
row night at the Union.
