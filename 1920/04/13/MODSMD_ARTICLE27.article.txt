# FLONZALEY CONCERT PROVES TRUE FEAST FOR MUSIC LOVERS
## 
### Adelheid Saier, '22 
Last night, at the Flonzaley concert,
the audience witnessed a true ex
ample of four souls being amalgamated
by a common force. These men have
worked and have been together for so
many years that they seem to live with
â– the greatest composers of their quar
tet music. In the interpretation of the
numbers on their string instruments
there was nothing mechanical because
of their co-operation.
Everyone felt after their rendition
of the Quartet in D major by Mozart
followed by the American Quartet by
Dvorak, that they have the greatest of
all gifts. They can journey into the
world of the most supreme dignity and
serious thought and then immediately
enter that of the sweot expression of
simple and happy melodies.
It is evident after last night that
only a quartet of the Flonzaley type
can have the power to render its en
tire audience enthusiastic. The in
dividual singer can not appeal to all
his audience because his personality
and music is limited to one sphere.
The large symphony has to direct all
the music according to the interpre
tation of its leader. But, in the quartet
each man has his own voice and can
express it through the medium of his
instrument.
The only regret that we have after
the musical is that the quartet cannot
give a series of concerts here for their
realm of music is so beautifully spirit
ual that many of us long for the op
portunity of always dwelling therein
with them.
