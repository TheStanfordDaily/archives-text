# NO COMPETITION IN INTRAMURAL OPENERS
## Majority of Teams Forfeit First Games of New Series 
### 
Intergroup baseball began yesterday
afternoon between the living groups on
the campus. The teams from Encina
failed to putin an appearance and lost
their games by forfeit to Beta Theta Pi
and Alpha Tau Omega. The Phi Psi
nine met the Off-Campus diamond art
ists on the faculty held in the only sched
uled game of the day. The game was a
good track meet. Both pitchers had
poor support, and each hit to the infield
netted several bases. The game ended
with a final score of 10 to 9, the Phi
Psi nine on the long end.
Beta Theta Pi and Phi Gamma Delta
played an impromptu game on the rug
by field. The Phi Gam nine did not
have all their regular players and the
game was a 10 to 3 victory for the Betas.
Reid, the mound man of the Beta nine,
showed surprising form, his delivery be
ing a puzzle to the opposing batters. If
he were eligible for freshman athletics
he would show up good on the mound
for the Babes.
The teams competing this afternoon
have had more warning than those of
yesterday, and Coach Acker hopes to see
a better adherence to the schedule ar
ranged. Games for tomorrow are: Al
pha Sigma Phi vs. El Campo, Theta
Delta Chi vs. Kappa Alpha, Encina
Fourth Floor vs. Chi Psi, and Kappa
Sigma vs. S. A. E. The 1 beta Delta-
K. A. game looks good, for the teams
have been putting in a good deal of work
improving their form and should be able
to put up a pretty fair brand of ball.
