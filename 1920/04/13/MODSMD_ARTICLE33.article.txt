# Varsity Batting Average Compiled
## 
### 
Batting averages of the varsity base
ball players, compiled for the twelve
games played, explain their defeat at the
hands of California in two straight
games. The team boasts of but three
hitters who are over the three hundred
mark, and two of these men have played
in less than half of the games. The out
fielders, who are usually the heavy hit
ters on a baseball team, are among the
poorest batters. Kline is hitting .2s) for
eleven games and leads the gardeners.
! Mitchell and Wayland are both below
, the two hundred mark.
Briggs is leading the hitters, but since
1 he has played, in but four games he can
hardly be called the leading hitter.
I Crowe, with an average of .316 in eight
games shapes up as the real leader.
The average of the team as a whole is
very low. Out of a total of 357 times
at bat 64 hits were made for an average
j of .179.
The averages show those players who
have made one or more hits during the
season.
