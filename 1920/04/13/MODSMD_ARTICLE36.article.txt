Dr. Saanders has had a wide range

was engaged in government work in
that country, and was then again en
gaged by the International Committee
of the Y. M. C. A. to make a world
wide study of Buddhism. Following
the completion of a lecture tour which
he is now making he will return to
the Orient to engaged in a more ex
tensive study of its people, their
customs, and religions.
