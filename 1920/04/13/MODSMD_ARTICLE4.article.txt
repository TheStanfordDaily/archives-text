a rugby team in the Olympic games at
Antwerp next summer is assured, an
nounced Coach Harry Maloney this
morning. The California Rugby Union
will now proceed with the arrangements
necessary to enter the rugby men in the
world meet this summer.
Coach Maloney conferred last Satur
day with Mr. Sam Goodman, Pacific
Coast representative of the A. A. A. U.,
who recently returned from Antwerp.
Mr. Goodman assured the Stanford
coach that the Games Committee of the
Athletic Union favored the entrance of
a Rugby squad in the Olympic meet.
As rugby is not a national sport, the ex
penses of the squad will not be paid by
the national union.
An estimate of $25 000 has been made
to finance the rugby team. The officers
of the California Rugby Union are in
touch with a number of prominent Cali
forni asportsmen interested in rugby
who will be appealed to for the financial
underwriting of the Antwerp trip.
The team, contrary to current asser
tion, has not been picked, declared Coach
Maloney. As a result of the last try
out held on the local turf, Maloney has
selected a tentative squad of thirty men.
Tll May. on a date toÂ«be later announced,
the final tryout will be conducted 011 the
Stanford field.
