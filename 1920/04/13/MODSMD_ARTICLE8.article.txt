# FIELD PROSPECTS ARE IMPROVING FOR 'BIG MEET'
## Hanner is Hurling Javelin Around 175 Feet in Practice 
### 
Prospects in the field events assumed
a brighter aspect yesterday when Han
ner, Stanford's sole hope in the javelin,
threw the wand 175 feet, which is about
15 feet better than Johnny Merchant,
the Blue and Gold star, has done this
season. Merchant has been making
around 160 feet. Coach Maloney feels
jubilant over Hanner's performance, as
first place had been conceded in this
event to California.
Maloney has another hope in the jave
lin now in Sentous, who is showing form
in hurling the stick.
"Fat" Flowers, Adams, and Hanner
are the Cardinal entries in the shot-put.
All of these men are putting the shot
around 39 feet, but the California weight
men are doing around 42 and 43 feet.
Unless the Stanford men show consid
erable improvement in the next few
days, the best that can be hoped for is
a third place.
In the other field events, the pole vault,
discus and the jumps, Stanford has a
much better chance. Green and Wilcox
will undoubtedly grab the first two
places in the pole, and Green, Templeton,
Heath, and Weaver will easily take all
three places in the high jump. "Bat"
Gillespie, "Red" Tauzer, and Green will
give Johnny Merchant a fight for the
honors in the discus.
Upon "Dink" Templeton may again
depend the result of the meet. Temple
ton defeated Merchant in the broad
jump last year in a critical moment, and
Stanford fans look for him to repeat
his feat this year. Merchant has been
doing quite a bit better than Templeton
and the dope is against the Cardinal
man, but Coach Maloney hopes for a
first place.
