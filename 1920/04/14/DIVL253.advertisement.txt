CALIFORNIA'S
OPPORTUNITY
The primary election in Michigan
should bring to the minds not only
of the people of California but to the
people of all the States on the Pacific

no one can seriously question the
probable ability of Hiram Johnson

many of the Senate's seasoned leaders
to be active champions in his fight for
the Republican nomination for Presi

In Johnson's direct appeal to the
people, the response he has received
throughout the East and Middle West
has been spectacular. Many astute
politicians see in this successful east

may be chosen the standard bearer at
Chicago. But the same atstute poli

this primary to give him an unquali
fied endorsement.
The most ardent admirers of Mr.
Hoover, and they are many and sin

Hoover, so definitely nonpartisan, has
any possible chance of being selected
by the definitely partisan convention
which will be held in Chicago. The
