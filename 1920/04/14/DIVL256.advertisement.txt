LIGHT up a Chesterfield. Now you're
' in luck.
No mistake about it, Chesterfields sure
do come through on "Satisfy"!
None but the finest varieties of Turkish
and Domestic tobaccos, specially selected
and expertly blended —is it any wonder
that Chesterfields welcome comparison
with the best you ever smoked?
Ordinary blending brings out flavor, of
course, but blending by Chesterfield's
process brings out a new flavor—a flavor
that "they" didn't know was there.
And this blend is exclusive—based on
our private formula. It cannot be dupli
cated, or even closely imitated.
You get "Satisfy" in Chesterfields and
nowhere else.
And the special, moisture-proof wrap
ping lets none cf their flavor escape.
"Luck kind of low?
Time for a smoke 99
