# STANFORD NINE MEETS CHICAGO TEAM TOMORROW
## Rejuvenated Varsity Will Take Field Against Easterners 
### 
Stanford vs. University of Chicago
will be the main event on the baseball
sport calendar tomorrow afternoon ac
cording to arrangements made by Stu
dent Manager Stamp yesterday after
noon. The Chicago team is now in San
Francisco waiting to take passage for
Japan, where they will play the four
Japanese universities in a month's series.
Coach Evans plans to put his strongest
team on the field tomorrow against the
Chicago team in an effort to defeat the
visitors. Evans has changed his team
around considerably since the defeat at
the hands of California Saturday, and
the team tomorrow probably will present
a different appearance. The choice of
moundsman for the game will be made
from Newland, Draper, and Briggs, with
Moisten and Stewart in line for the
catching job. Bundy is on the injured
list at present with a bad finger.
The Chicago team contains several
stars, both in baseball and in other lines
of sport. The Chicago coach probably
will use several pitchers in the game in
order to get his hurlers in trim for the
hard schedule in the Orient.
The Chicago nine will line up against
California on Friday.
