# IN APPRECIATION OF THE STANFORD CREW
## 
### 
AF all the spring sports, crew gets less advertising than any other athletic
" activity. Baseball and track have the advantage of working on the Uni
versity grounds, but even more important than this, these sports have the
opportunity for preliminary appearances before the big meet. In both of
these respects crew is at a disadvantage. Outside of the fact that a few
students see the crew bus leave the Union every afternoon, few people ever
think of the men who are working out every day.
Crew in the past has been one of the best advertisements Stanford has
ever had. The showing of the Stanford crew at Poughkeepsie in 1914 will
go down as one of the classics in the distory of eastern athletics. At all
times the record of the versity shell has been one worthy of the name of
Stanford particularly when the conditions under which crew men have had
to work are taken into consideration.
Saturday morning the freshman and varsity shells will appear on the
Oakland Estuary. Just what our chances are we don't know but we do know
that these men will do all in their power to bring the Cardinal home to
victory. After the long siege of practice the whole student body should
come out to back the oarsmen in their initial and only appearance. Crew
has been possible only under very adverse conditions and the time has now
come when the men and women of Stanford must show these men some
appreciation for their work. If crew is to continue in the future, it must
have the support of the student body. Crew has proved its right to a place
in Stanford athletics in the past and we hope that it may continue in the
future.
