# JOIN THE HOOVER CLUB
## 
### 
STANFORD STUDENTS will have another opportunity during the present
week to endorse Herbert Hoover as their choice for President, and to
definitely join the local movement which has been organized to further the
interests of the Hoover campaign and do all it can toward creating an over
whelming Hoover sentiment on the campus and elsewhere. Cards for mem
bership to the Hoover Club are being circulated this week. among all the
living groups on the campus, on the Quad and elsewhere, so that every mem
ber of the University, no matter where his residence may be, will have ample
opportunity to join. And it is extremely important that everyone should sign
these cards. Stanford is the home of Hoover, it is considered his strong
hold, and it would be fatal to the success of his campaign if it were shown
that we did not support him by an overwhelming majority. Of Hoover's
qualifications for the position, and of his political stand, there is no longer
any doubt. He has declared himself to be a Republican, and has outlined
a platform which sets down clearly, and with a definiteness which shows
his clear insight into affairs both economic and political, his position on all
the questions before the people today. Hoover is by far the largest man on
the political horizon, the only man whose actual records of achievement would
warrant election to the highest honor which America can bestow. And
above that, he is a Stanford man, and here on the Farm the tradition of
confidence in, and loyalty to graduates, is justly notable and far famed. It
is the least anyone can do to join the club for Herbert Hoover, and neglect
to do so would be hard to justify.
