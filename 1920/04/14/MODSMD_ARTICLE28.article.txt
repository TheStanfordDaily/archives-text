# DR. JORDAN GIVES POPULAR ADDRESS
## Ascent of Matterhorn is Described by President Emeritus 
### 
"No one who has ever seen the Mat
terhorn can ever forget its form; it
burns itself into the memory as nothing
else in all Europe does," said l)r. Jordan
in the course of his address, "The As
cent of the Matterhorn," which he gave
in the Assembly Hall last evening. "It
is not the highest mountain of the Alps,
but no other mountain in the world
makes such use of its height as the Mat
terhorn. Other mountains have rounded
heads and gradual slopes, but no glacier
has worn its angles into curves. Its
slopes are too steep for snow to cling
to; it is solely a creature of the sun and
the frost."
Dr. Jordan made the ascent of the
Matterhorn in 1881 with a party of live
friends from his home state of Illinois,
among whom were Professor Charles
11. Gilbert, now of Stanford, and Dr.
Melville Andersen, former head of the
English Department here.
The party set out from the village of
Zermat, which is at the foot of the Mat
terhorn, at 1 o'clock in the morning in
charge of five guides, one of whom,
"John the Baptist" later attained consid
erable fame for his mountain feats. All
paths ceased a short way up the moun
tain, and the rest of the ascent was made
by crawling on hands and knees up the
rock ledges, or climbing up ropes. All
the members of the party were tied to
gether by ropes ; the leading guide would
progress a few steps and anchor himself,
then pull up the next man, and so on,
until the last one had reached a position
of safety. The summit was reachcd at
1 o'clock in the afternoon.
In making the descent, great difficul
ties were encountered with falling rocks,
loosened by the "tournament/' a sort of
whirlwind peculiar to the mountains, and
also by the travelers themselves. Hardly
had the party begun to make the descent
when a large rock was lossened and
plunged down the mountain side, hitting
Professor Gilbert full in the face and
knocking him over the ledge. He was
dragged back by the rope which con
nected him to the rest of the men. The
remainder of the descent with an in
jured man to take care of was exceed
ingly difficult. When the upper hut was
reached, Dr. Jordan, Mr. Gilbert, and
three other members of the party were
left behind, and there they spent the
night in the terrific cold. Early the next
morning they proceeded on to the lower
cabin, where they were met by a doc
tor and four men bearing a sedan chair.
The rest of the trip was made in ease
and safety, and the adventurers were
greeted in Zermat as the heroes of the
hour.
