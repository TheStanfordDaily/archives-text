days on the campus as the guest of the
local chapter. During her stay here, she
has been the incentive for a number of
social .functions, one of which was a
tea given in her honor Sunday after
noon. She is extremely interested in
the sorority housing problem that is
troubling this campus at the present
time. Yesterday afternoon she spoke to
a group of resident sorority women on
the subject.
