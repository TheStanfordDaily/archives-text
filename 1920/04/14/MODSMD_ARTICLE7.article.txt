# HAYES WILL CHOOSE QUESTION FOR 'JOFFRE'
## Extemporaneous Debaters to Meet California on April 24 
### 
Choice of the question for the Joffre
debate, which is to be held in Wheeler
Hall at the University of California on
April 24, will be made by Professor Carl
ton Hayes, a famous authority on French
affairs at Columbia University. The
general proposition for this year's con
test deals with the French election sys
tem. At 6 p. m., on April 24, the six de
baters, three representing Stanford and
three representing California, will
receive the message stating the phase
of the general question to be discussed
from Professor Hayes. After each con
testant has drawn for side and place he
will be locked in a room with only such
material as he saw fit to bring prior to
the statement of the question.
Promptly at 8 p. m.the first speaker
for the affirmative will open the discus
sion. The contestants will be allowed
to divide their fifteen-minute's time be
tween constructive argument and refu
tation. The drawings will be so ar
ranged as to insure the presence of at
least one man from each university on
the opposing team. No rules will gov
ern the decision of the judges except
that the Joffre Medaille is to be award
ed "to the most effective speaker."
Hal G. Rlote, '18, M. M. Goldstein,
'20, and W. F. Leiser, '21, will uphold
the Cardinal in this year's contest.
Rlote, who has previously been a mem
ber of the Joffre squad, and has taken
part in other intercollegiate debates, is
considered one of the most effective
speakers of the Stanford trio. He is a
member of Sigma Chi and Sigma Delta
Chi.
Goldstein is another seasoned debtaer,
having taken part in several intercol
legiate clashes. His easy flow of words
and admirable style of delivery are fac
tors that the judges cannot disregard in
making their decisions. Goldstein is a
member of Encina Club.
Leiser appears on the Joffre squad
this year for the third successive season.
ITe is a member of Fncina Club and
Delta Sigma Rho.
Nothing definite has been learned of
California's team except that only one
experienced man was representing
Berkeley this season. Local debating en
thusiasts declare that Stanford's chances
for bringing home the medal were better.
