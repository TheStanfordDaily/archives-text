THE JOHNSON CAMPAIGN
A Great Written-in Vote For
Him in the City of
Chicago
We are inclined to think that the
tact that 4(5,659 voters of the State of
Illinois took the trouble to write in j
Senator Johnson's name on the pri
mary ballot the most significant inci
dent of the Presidential campaign.
Governor Lowden of Illinois is a
candidate for the Presidency and with-,
out doubt is the preference of a ma
jority of the Republican voters of his j
State. Realizing that, and from can
didatorial courtesy, Senator Johnson
made no effort in that State. His
name was not printed on the primary i
ballot, and it was not expected that
it would appear in the canvass of the
returns.
Hut in spite of that in the city of j
Chicago alone no less than 40,881
voters wrote in his name as their |
preference for President.
That is a very significant thing.
There is no ground for expecting the
nomination of either Governor Lowden
or General Wood in the convention,
although it will meet in Chicago. The
vote in Chicago was: Lowden 222,103,
for Wood 149,301, for Johnson 49,881,
making 190,182 Republican voters of
that city who preferred some other
candidate than their own Governor.
So large a vote against Lowden in his
own State will greatly weaken him in j
the convention, while the spontaneous
vote for Johnson will correspondingly
strengthen him.
So far as the candidacy of Mr.
Hoover is concerned, it may be re
garded as nearly a closed incident.
Only f>oo voter: in Illinois took the
trouble to write in his name. His uni
versity and other personal friends will
doubtless stand by him, but he has!
