Hoover's refusal to accept a Demo
cratic nomination cuts off any hope of

snubbed. Attempts to create an or

Hoover came in contact with a great
many people, and it is to his credit

promote his political fortunes, but as
to any national movement in support
of his candidacy it simply does not
exist.

would be injurious to the Republican
party, to the State and to the entire
West, for that matter. There is need

in this need, but there is to be con
sidered the gratification of a warranted
and laudable State pride in having
the President chosen from our number.
It is unfortunate that any other
name has been suggested for our
preference. That our delegation will
go to Chicago pledged to Senator
Johnson is absolutely certain. And

It would be graceful for the friends
of Mr. Hoover formally to withdraw
his name. He has not. in any way
sought the nomination and while he
could not, but be proud of a spontane
