# BROWNE SAYS "PROS" ARE KILLING RUGBY
## Commercial Sportsmen's Plot Against the Game is Exposed 
### 
Professional athletes are seeking to
dictate the athletic polic}- of California
schools, declared Dr. A. D. Browne this
morning, by attempting to eliminate the
playing of rugby both in the high schools
and colleges of the state. The commer
cial sportsmen have failed to coerce the
latter and are now concentrating upon
the secondary schools, hoping to indi
rectly force the universities to abandon
the sport. If rugby is killed in the high
schools, professionalism will attempt to
dictate its policy to the universities.
The recently organized Pacific Coast
bootball Association, asserted Dr.
Browne, is simply a group of football
officials, chiefly referees, who hope by
promoting the American brand of foot
ball, to provide lucrative positions for
themselves. A concerted attempt bv
members of this association to force rug
by out of the California schools has been
evident for the past few months. An
attempt to make the Oakland High
Schools play only American football
was recently defeated by the-physical <li
rector of that city.
1 lie past year several commercial
sporting houses have been quietly dis
couraging rugby and seeking to make
American the sole football game to be
played in the State. Their attempt has
been largely a failure, declared the local
physical director. The Spaulding house
lately has given assurance, through
Manager Brandenburg, that the company
will pursue a policy of "hands off" in the
controversy.
Letters from high school principal's
and educators have come in in numbers
in the last few weeks to Harry Maloney,
as President of California Rugby Union,
asking for assistance in the light against
professionalism. Stanford will not, as
serted the physical trainer, attempt to
dictate to the high schools what athletic
policy they should pursue. A legitimate
effort will be made, however, to com
bat the efforts of the professional ath
letes and stimulate the playing of rugby
throughout the State. Maloney today
forwarded the following letter to prom
inent educators of California, requesting
their co-operation in the formation of
a Junior Rugby League:
"At the request of several coaches and
directors of high school athletics a move
ment is on foot to organize a High
School Rugby League to include all
schools and teams intending to play
rugby football during, the coming sea-
