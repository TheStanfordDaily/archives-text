# Four Campus Editors Back Herbert Hoover
## 
### 
Editors of all the campus pub
lications have come out behind
Herbert Hoover for President
with the following statement:
Herbert Hoover has proved
himself beyond a doubt to be
the man who should be at the
at the head of the government
of the United States. His
achievements are the strongest
recommendation that any can
didate for such a position could
have. Stanford thought has
shown itself to unquestionably
recognize these facts. This is
manifest in the overwhelming
Hoover sentiment that per
vades the Stanford community.
As editors, we desire to repre
sent this sentiment, and with
that in view, take this method
of formally announcing that all
the Stanford publications are
behind Herbert Hoover as a
candidate for the presidency.
