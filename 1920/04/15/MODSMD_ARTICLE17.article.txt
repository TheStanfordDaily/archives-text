Stanford and California clash in their
annual swimming meet and water polo
came in the Olympic Club pool of San
Francisco next Saturday at 8:30.
Coach Braridsten has his men in first
class condition and is confident of a vic
tory. Drake, who swam such fast races
in the south during the spring vacation
tour, is expected to clean up in both the
sprint events. Austin, his team-mate, is
also a fast man over the 50 and 100 yard
courses. Flowers, Mills, and Dickey are
three heavyweights who should figure in
the plunge for distance. With these men
as the nucleus of a well-balanced team,
Stanford should win. The water polo
