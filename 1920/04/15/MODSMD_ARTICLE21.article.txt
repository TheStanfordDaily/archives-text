# COLLEGE ACTIVITIES IN THE UNIVERSITY
## 
### 
PRESIDENT NIELSON of Smith College in a recent address made an inter
■®- esting statement concerning the place of college activities in an university
education to the effect that if educators would be honest with themselves,
they would have to admit that the student gained more knowledge and train
ing of a practical nature, which would serve him in later life, than anything
he got in the classroom. By this statement President Nielson meant that in
college activities, men and women learn to deal .with other men and women.
TUey learn the importance of the human factor which 110 book could teach
and which can only be learned through practical experience.
This statement is undoubtedly backed up by those men and women who
hare had experience in college activities. It would therefore be natural to
conclude that the greatest possible number of students should have the op
portunity to turn out for college activities. This point is the chief advantage
of a point system whereby only a certain number of activities can be en
gaged in by a student during a current year. The monopoly of college activi
ties is thus eliminated although it has the corresponding disadvantage in
limiting the possibilities of the student who has the talent and the ability to
do more.
No set system will ever solve the problem but to those men and women
who are interested in college activities President Nielson's statment takes
on a particular significance. The line of action is clear. Those students who
are active in campus life should not let their activities absorb their attention
to the extent where they fail to bring other students into active life. Those
men and women should try continually to bring in as many students as pos
sible in organizing their particular work. In this way, the greatest possible
number can be reached without the hindrance of the eternal regulation.
