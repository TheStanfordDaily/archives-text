After two days' hot competition in
the race for Spring Carnival King and
Queen, Miss Mary Tuthill maintained
her lead over the field of prospective
Queens, while Miss Melba Berry and
Miss Adelaide Graves changed places,
Miss Graves capturing second by ten
votes. Miss Eleanor Anderson drew up
into fourth place, while Miss Marie Hut
ton's support weakened: Miss Hutton
falling back into' the ninth position.
L\ Hendepsou sailed into the lead as
King, with McDermott giving him a
hard chase. Bennetf, the former leader,
sank into third place, hotly pursued by
Pershing.
The Carnival will be celebrated en
tirely within the walls of Encina gym
nasium, instead of partially upon the
football as . formerly planned, in
accordance with a recent decision on the
part of the committee in charge. The
possibility of bad weather, and lack of
sufficient concentration of interest if the
events of the spring festival were scat
tered over several fields, led to the de
cision.
Plans for tbe Carnival are becoming
daily more elaborate and unique. A
meeting of the Representative Commit
tee will be held tonight at the Little
'1 heater, at 7:15, to make further ar
rangements, and institute other pos
sible changes, for the initial plans.
The representatives of all the cam
pus organizations taking part in the
carnival must be present. All the de
tails of construction will be worked out.
Representatives should be prepared to
give an outline of their plans, a de
scription of their "stunts," a list of those
to take parts, a sketch showing the con
struction needed for their concession.
Space in the Encina gym yard will be
allotted to the various organizations at
tonight's meeting.

possibility of bad weather, and lack of
sufficient concentration of interest if the
events of the spring festival were scat

After two days' hot competition in
the race for Spring Carnival King and
Queen, Miss Mary Tuthill maintained
her lead over the field of prospective
Queens, while Miss Melba Berry and
Miss Adelaide Graves changed places,
Miss Graves capturing second by ten
votes. Miss Eleanor Anderson drew up
into fourth place, while Miss Marie Hut
ton's support weakened: Miss Hutton
falling back into' the ninth position.
L\ Hendepsou sailed into the lead as
King, with McDermott giving him a
hard chase. Bennetf, the former leader,
sank into third place, hotly pursued by
Pershing.
The Carnival will be celebrated en
tirely within the walls of Encina gym
nasium, instead of partially upon the
football as . formerly planned, in
accordance with a recent decision on the
part of the committee in charge. The
possibility of bad weather, and lack of
sufficient concentration of interest if the
events of the spring festival were scat
tered over several fields, led to the de
cision.
