# TWO SESSIONS TO COMPRISE SUMMER SCHOOL THIS YEAR
## Two Hundred and Thirty-One Courses Will be Given By Able Faculty 
### 
A unique opportunity was made pos
sible for Stanford students this sum-!
mer by the splitting of the summer
quarter into two sessions, the first ex- 1
tending from June 22 to July 28, and
the second lasting from July 29 to
September 3d. Enrollment will be
possible in either one of the sessions,
or any student desiring a full quar
ter's work may continue throughout!
both sessions. Tuition charges, an
nounces the Registrar, "will be for
either half of the summer quarter—l
one half of the corresponding fee of
the whole quarter."
Though the dual session plan will j
probably induce an additional number j
of regular Stanford students to enroll j
in the summer session, a more im- 1
portant effect of the innovation will
be its attraction to the public of the ;
state. Before the adoption of the
quarterly plan at Stanford, no summer
instruction,-v-.c given on the "Farm."
The length of the summer session un
til this year has made entrance into
it prohibitive to teachers or employees
desiring a few weeks of university in
struction during a brief vacation. The
short sessions of the 1920 summer
quarter may draw to Stanford part of
this class, especially of ex-Stanford
students desiring to remain in touch
with the latest developments in their
professions.
Though a balance course in till de
partments of the University is given,
emphasis is placed on several phases
of work that will appeal to the class
of students that registers for the sum
mer session. The Education, Eng
lish, Medical and Romanic Language
departments, particularly, are com
plete in the classes offered. Four
classes only in engineering are in
cluded in the quarter's curriculum.
Administrative problems will be
emphasized in the School of Educa
tion. Will C. Wood, State Commis
sioner of Education, will present his
views on administrative work as gain
ed from experience in a number of
important administrative positions.
Secondary education will be treated
by one of the foremost High School
educators of the state, W. H. Nichols,
Principal of the Palo Alto High School.
The difficulties in educating mental
and juvenile delinquents will be treat
ed by J. H. Williams, the Director of
Research at the Whittier State School.
Walker Stuart, a lecturer on dram
atic art, will teach several classes
that are certain to evoke interest.
The problems of the theatrical world
will be viewed in their practical
phases in courses on Play Construc
tion, the Staging of Plays and The
atrical Scenery. A study of master
pieces from the technical side will be
made, and the work of theaters ana
lyzed. The students of Mr. Stuart's
classes will have the benefit of his
experience as manager of the Belasco
Play Bureau and of the Portmanteau
Theater of Cincinnati.
The nine courses of the Psysical
Training Department for women offer
an unusual training. In addition to
Mrs. G. J. Brandstens' classes in
swimming, Helen Masters Bunting
will direct classes in Playground
Management and in the Theory of
Athletics for Women. Miss Bunting
comes to Stanford after a varied ex
perience, including the directorship
of physical education for women at the
University of Colorado.
Prominent professors, in addition to
the regular Stanford faculty, are in
cluded in many of the departmental
staffs. James W. Garner, who has
been professor of Political Science at
the University of Illinois since 1904,
is scheduled for courses on European
Governments and the History of Po
litical Theory. Nationality problems
before the Peace Confenrence will be
discussed in a seminar on European
history by Frank A. Golder of the
Washington State College. A noted
authority on Celtic literature, Profes
sor Tom Peete Cross of the University
of Chicago, will direct study on the
relation of the Cs»lts to European
literature.
The 231 courses scheduled for the
sessions form a variety of classes that
will appeal both to Stanford students
and those desiring a brief course of
summer instruction. The number of
registrants for the summer will un
doubtedly be the largest since the in
auguration of the quarterly plan at
Stanford.
