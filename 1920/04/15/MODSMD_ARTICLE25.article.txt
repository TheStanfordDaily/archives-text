# TRAINING GIVEN IN FARM TRACTORS
## 
### 
Cornell University is co-operating
with a number of other universities
throughout the east in an intensive
course in training in farm machinery
and tractors. The work is in charge
of the Cornell Department of Agricul
ture. It, is estimated that there will
be a reduction of a million acres in
cultivated lands for the current year
because of scarcity of help.
This reduction will take place large
ly among crops that call for a great
deal of labor, such as raising of po
tatoes and cabbage, and is therefore
considered a great impediment to the
reduction of the cost of living. There
are several remedies for this outlook,
the most effective of which is an in
crease on the farms of the amount of
labor-saving machinery.
