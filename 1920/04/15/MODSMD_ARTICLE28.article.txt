# PROFESSOR WITCHER TO SPEAK APRIL 21
## Advance of the British in Palestine and Far East To be Described 
### 
Professor E. C. Wicher who was
attached to the staff of General Al
lenby when the British army marched
from Egypt to Palestine, will speak
at the second meeting of the World's
Problems Forum, which will be held
on Wednesday evening, April 21. Pro
fessor Wicher was with the British
army during the entire time of its
campaign in the holy land and has
secured a large number of photo
graphs, as well as an invaluable store
of knowledge in connection with this
historic land which had been domi
nated ver for so many centuries by
the Turks.
Although the" Y. M. C. A., under
whose auspices the World's Problems
Forum has been organized, has not
received an announcement from the
lecturer as to the definite subject of
his address, it is expected that he will
describe the advance of the British
and tell of the condition of the land
and people who were ruled by the
Turks. He will undoubtedly outline
the possibilities of Palestine in the
future, now that this country has been
freed. Professor Wicher has a large
number of stereopticon slides which
will be shown with his lecture.
