# CIRLE 'S' SOCIETY IS REVIVED HERE
## 
### 
Minor sportsmen of the Cardinal
met Wednesday night in the Stanford
Union and organized the Circle "S"
Society with an initial membership
of twenty-four. The organization is
the revival of the old Circle "S" So
ciety, which before the war actively
promoted the interests of minor sports
at Stanford.
The report of the constitutional
committee, appointed at an informal
meeting of minor sportsmen last quar
ter, was considered, and a constitu
tion adopted. Officers were elected
for the remainder of the year, as fol
lows: W. K. Hood. *20, president;
Harry Newlands, '21, vice-president;
W. T. Martin, '20, secretary and
treasurer.
Anyone who was awarded a circle
"S" prior to this quarter is eligible
for membership in the reorganized
society. The circle "S" men plan to
stimulate competition for membership
on minor sports teams and public s'up
port of the intercollegate contests in
which the minor sportsmen engage.
