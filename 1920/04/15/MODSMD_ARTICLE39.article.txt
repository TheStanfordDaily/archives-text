# DR. KENNETH SAUNDERS GIVES TALK ON INDIA
## Tells of India's Gift to Civilization From a Religious View 
### 
"India's gift to Civilization" was the
subject of an interesting lecture given in
the Little Theater last night by Dr. Ken
neth Saunders, who has been engaged
in Indian government work, and also
in Y. M. C. A. work.
Dr. Saunders presented to his audi
ence a very clear, unprejudiced view of
the state of the religion which exists
in India today. He compared it to the
religion of the western world, and al
though he pointed out many features in
the customs and beliefs of the inhabi
tants of the Far East which are at fault,
Jie also gave many illustrations which
brought out the fallacies of the religious
standards in America and western Eu
rope. Tfie speaker gave several good ex
amples of Hindu faith and devotion
which showed that the country as a
whole depended a great deal on divine
help and aid from the unseen. He fur
ther outlined the prospects of applying
this faith and devoltion to the present
day Christian religion, but in applying
these virtues he did not forget that
there is much good in India with all of
its evil. It would be his plan to leave
the work of solving many of their own
problems to the people themselves, al
lowing them to keep those beliefs and
customs which are not contrary to the
true Christian belief.
Dr. Saunders closed his lecture with
the remark, "The teachings of Jesus, it
seems to me, are just beginning to get
a grip on the people throughout the
world, and we need the help of this
Eastern world. The great gift that In
dia is going to give to civilization is that
she will be unflingingly idealistic, and
when ?he sees a tiling, she is going
through with it at any cost."
The International committee of the
Y. M. C. A. has again engaged Dr. Saun
ders to go to the Orient to make a fur
ther study of Buddhism, and he sails
Saturday for Japan, where he will re
sume his work.
