actly as he brought it from France.
Senator Bodge wants the Treaty only
with his reservations, Senator John
srtn wants no Treaty for a League of
Nations at all. "Mr. Hoover wants
something with which to start. He is
willing to take what he can get and
build upon that constructively for the
future."
Mr. Reed said that Senator John
son had never given one single con
structive sentence in regard to the
League. Johnson's idea is that we can
avoid entangling alliances. He be
lieves that we can bury our heads in
the sand, flap our wings, and shout
that we are Americans, and that then
the rest of the world will leave us to
our own devices. "Senator Johnson
has distinguished himself for the
Presidency of the United States in the
existing crisis because he absolutely
denies that the United States is a part
of the world. Such a man is not quali
fied to bring the ship of state safely
through the stormy waters of the next
four years."
The issue is whether or not we can
keep out of international affairs and
Johnson admits it. Professor Reed
said that he did not disagree with
Johnson's policies that he practiced
as Governor of this state. On the other
hand he said he firmly believed in
them. But, we are not electing a
Governor of the state by a President
of the United States. Senator John
son does possess qualities for deal
ing in international relations.
Courage, tact, persistence, genuis,
the sort of tact that can play the
European diplomatist's game with him
and beat him at it, that is Herbert

Hoover. He showed his ability time
and again during the war in dealing
with international affairs.
Besides international affairs there
are momentous civil questions that
must be answered in the coming ad
ministration. The President will have
to be a man free from the ordinary
bonds of politics. Herbert Hoover is
a Republican but not a partisan. He
is a man who is able to put his coun
try first in every consideration. Amer
ica first can be executed better by
Herbert Hoover than a man who has
been in political affairs for years. Big
politicians don't like Herbert Hoover
because lie won't take orders.
A man to meet the crisis must have
a knowledge of economic principles.
The keynote of Hoover's economic
principles is that every individual
should have an equal opportunity. Mr.
Hoover says that he is not in favor of
the nationalizing of the railroads be
cause he does not think that the gov
ernment will.be able to pick executives
as. well as the system of competition
can. He warns the railroad owners,
however, that if they do not give the
best service possible that they must
watch out for their positions.
While Herbert Hoover was in Wash
ington giving his services free to the
Industrial Commission, Senator John
son was out touring the country for
himself and he was not in the Senate
to vote on the Commings bill Which
was the most important one that has
come before Congress.
Economy is another thing that must
be practiced during the next admin
istration. Hoover's name has become
a synonym for economy. Offices in
bureaus created for war needs must
be abolished. Johnson would never
abolish these offices which his sup
porters might fill.
In speaking of Governor Lowden of
Illinois the speaker said that although
he was a better candidate than John
son he had not had enough experi
ence to cope with international af
fairs as well as Hoover.
The San Francisco papers the Ex
aminer, the Call, and the Chronicle
are strong in their support of John
son. Professor Reed gave Johnson's
statement made in 1916 that there
wasn't room in the same party for
himself and Michael de Young, owner
of the Chronicle. Things have changed
now and deYoung is supporting John
son for the presidency. The opposi
tion of the Chronicle Reed said was a
political asset.
Although San Francisco will prob
ably go for Johnson he said that
Hoover had the best chance in Los
Angeles. In the state at the present
there are 115 Hoover clubs. If every
one works for Hoover he believes the
state can be carried.
