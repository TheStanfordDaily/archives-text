# POLITICAL SCIENCE HEAD ADVOCATES HOOVER'S CANDIDICY
## 
### Professor V.J. West 
"I am for Hoover for nomination
by the Republican party as its candi
date for President. He is the only
man so far mentioned by voters in
that party who measures up to the re
quirements of the office. If he is
mentioned by the Republicans it will
be a most hopefully significant event
for the American people, for it will
mean that the Republican party will
have acquired great ideals and new
vision. No Republican should let
himself be fooled by the efforts now
being made by the Johnson organiza
tion to induce Hoover supporters to
vote for Johnson in the coming pri
maries in order to keep two Californi
ans before the convention. The fal
lacy of this argument is revealed if
you consider whether you should vote
for Abe Ruef instead of Johnson, if
these two were the candidates, in
order to keep two Californians in the
running. The Johnson people pay
Hoover a pretty compliment, but dele
gates, not compliments, win nomina
tions in conventions. The nation
needs Hoover, not just any Californian.
Let's vote for him."
