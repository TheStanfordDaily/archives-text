# Gregory Will Speak Friday to Assembly
## "Dictator of Central Europe" Is Stanford Graduate and Trustee 
### 
Undoubtedly better qualified by his ex
perience to speak upon the subject, "The
European Crisis and What It Means to
Us," than any man who could come
to us at this time, Thomas T. C. Greg
ory, Stanford graduate in '99, trustees of
the University, and one-time dictator of
the central countries of Europe, will
speak at the Assembly Hall tomorrow
morning at 10 o'clock.
At the opening of the war, Gregory
withdrew from his law offices in San
Francisco to become a captain in the
"Grizzlies." After the preliminary
treaty in November. 1918, Gregory was
attached to the American Relief Expe
dition under Herbert Hoover and at
the latter's special request, he estab
lished headquarters in Austria, a hot
bed of revolution and anarchy, and there
set about putting the people in such con
dition economically and financially that
they would be able to stand on their feet
when Allied support should be sus
pended.
It is largely due to the commanding
ability of Gregory that Franz Josef,
archduke of Austria of the old Haps
burg lintj, who was plotting to establish
himself on the throne, was induced to
withdraw. This success was jthe occa
sion of the famous telegram sent by
Gregory to Hoover, sitting in Paris.
Since the wire must pass through sev
eral countries and it was necessary to
keep American political interference
pretty dark, it went as follows: "Josic
on mat at 12 m.; put at 12 :10."
While still in Europe, Gregory was
elected a member of the Board of Trus
tees of Stanford University. Tonight
he will' deliver an address at the Uni
versity of California.
The Stanford Orchestra has agreed to
play before the assembly tomorrow, and
it is,,expected : thatlarge .number of
students will attend to hear the speaker.
