# HOOVER ONLY ONE FOR REPUBLICAN PARTY SAYS REED
## International Affairs Must Be Met by Man With Great Abilities 
### 
"Big politicians don't like Herbert
Hoover, but they like defeat, less,"
said Professor Thomas Lleed of the
University of California last evening.
Professor Reed spoke in behalf of
Hoover in an open meeting of the
Hoover Club in the Stanford Union
at 8 o'clock.
it doesn't matter what university
the presidential candidates are from,"
said Reed. The problem is not one of
glorifying the uiweiait.v but ot elect
ing a president of the States.
"As a matter of fact th* University
of California stands shoulder to shoul
der with Stanford 011 the proposition
of the support of Herbert Hoover.
One hundred and ten members of the
faculty of the University of California
are firmly for Herbert Hoover. The
great majority of the student body is
for Hoover."
International relations now call for
a man with administrative qualities
which Herbert Hoover alone of the
presidential possibilities possesses. In
Washington's time we could and did
live separate from the refet of the
world. This is now impossible. We
are now a part of, the world. This
was , shown when we were inevitably
sucked into the war. "There is no
such thing as an isolated America to
day, There can never be another
world war in which we will not take
a part." Herbert Hoover has the qua
lities to lead us through the trouble
some .times .of international affairs.
In referring to the charge made by
Senator Johnson that Hoover had
shifted Ixis., ground in regard to the
League of Nations the speaker said,
"Mr. Hoover : has been the most con
sistent .-practical friend of the League
in Hoover • has always
wanted a League. He has continued
to want a League. The "half-truth"
that has been used as campaign ma
terial by the Johnson faction that
Hoover supported the Lodge reserva
tions is true. Jle supported the F.odge
reservations so that the Treaty would
not be entirely defeated. President
Wilson wants the Treaty passed ex-
