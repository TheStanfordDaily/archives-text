—and what will you
wear on
"Carnival Night"?
We've had you in mind —knowing you'd want
a party frock and sport togs of the smartest
sort, for this excitingly important event.
When you see the party dresses you ll be able
to hear the tantalizing fox-trots and dreamy
waltzes —a week away! And the clever,
jaunty sport togs, simply leave nothing to be
desired. Run down Saturday on the electric
—and see these. And many other interesting
things at prices that can't fail to "intrigue"
your fancy.
140 So. First St., San Jose, Calif.
