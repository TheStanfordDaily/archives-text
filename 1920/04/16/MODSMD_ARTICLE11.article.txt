### 
If you see certain gentlemen wander
ing around the quad that look like all the
rest of us with the exception that they
are wearing high collars and black bow
ties, don't think that they are trying to
impersonate the professors. They arc
the victims of Alpha Chi Sigma initia
tions.
To become members of the chemical
fraternity these men must wear the
above attire. A nicely sugared doughnut
is worn on a string around the neck and
is kept to heart at all times. A large
size bottle of Pluto Water is kept on
the bodies of the pledglings around the
neck of which is festooned a yard of
blue and gold ribbon. Formal initiation
will be held next Wednesday.
