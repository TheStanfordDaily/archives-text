# STANFORD STANDS READY
## 
### 
OTANFORD stands ready. Tomorrow will see the culmination of the ath
letic schedule for the year 1919-1920. We look back with pride at the
football and basketeball seasons. With equal pride and confidence we look
forward to the track and crew exhibitions at California tomorrow.
Those of us who remember Stanford during the period of the war and
the dreary monotony of campus and athletic life on the Farm look on the
coming meet and crew race with added enthusiasm. We are glad to see the
Cardinal back on its feet and to know that those men who represent us are
the best we have, that they are men who feel the responsibility placed upon
them and will do all that clean sportsmanship can do to come home triumph
ant. We are all behind these men so let out the old war cry—"LET'S BRING
HOME THE BACON!"
