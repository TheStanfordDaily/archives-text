# STANFORD CREWS MEET CALIFORNIA TO-MORROW
## 
### W.C. Evans, '22 
The crew classic taking place on
the Oakland Estuary tomorrow morn
ing marks the end of a season of
gruelling training and practice for the
Stanford eights. Every man of the
varsity, second varsity and freshman
crews has putin all the honest effort
of which he has been capable, and
now the only thing that will carry
Stanford to victory is the application
of this effort in the race on Saturday
morning. There is little difference in
the crews of the two universities with
regard to the varsity eights. The
Cardinal varsity pulls a slightly faster
stroke than the California men and
depend upon an early lead to give
them the race at the end.
California has a heavier freshman
crew than Stanford has but the Cardi
nal babes seem to be of slightly better
material than the babes in the Bruin
boat and then there is the Cardinal
spirit that is always present.
Every one of the men on the varsity
have rowed in at least one race against
California and so may be counted on

to have the necessary strength to last
out the race Saturday.
Assistant Coach Roy King says, "Our
crews have been through a season of
rigorous training and every man in
the boats is now in the best condition
possible. We are handicapped by- the
loss of Captain Davis through the
psychological effect his presence would
have, as well as though the loss of his
power in the boat. I believe though
that we will take the lead at the start
of the race and keep it throughout the
course."
Captain "Cash" Davis said in part:
"Of course the injury to my hand that
keeps me out of the boat is a great
blow to me personally but every mem
berof the crew has been trained to
such a state of efficiency that my be
ing out of the boat should not change
matters much. We are in this race to
'win and Stanford is not going to let
the loss of one man beat her in any
contest. With the help of the Cardinal
spirit and the rooters we ought to
win Saturday."
