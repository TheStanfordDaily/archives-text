TRACK has always been one of the stellar stars in the athletic horizon of
Stanfoid For eight consecutive years the Cardinal track squads have taken
the meet from the Berkeley Bear and we hope to do it again. So far this
season cur men have made a good showing. The usual pessimists have the
odds ngainst us but odds on the wrong side of the fence Lave lirouglit more
than one Stanford team the winning end of the score. It is with the greatest
pleasure that the Daily Palo Alto takes this opportunity to express the ap
preciation of the student body for the work the track men have done for the
name of Stanford.
CREW has always held the place of the most spectacular sport Stanford
has ever fostered. Our career has been a brilliant one and Stanford pluck
and grit have come to the attention of the athletic world through our re
markable showing in crew. We have expressed our appreciation of the work
of the crew men already this week through the editorial column, but the
Daily Palo Alto extends the best wishes of good luck from every man and
wcman on the campus.
BASEBALL is perhaps held more dear by those men of the '95 class,
who undoubtedly hold a more profound and deeper reverence for the name
of Stanford than any of us will ever have the privilege of holding. They
watch the baseball season with a closer interest than we realize and feel a
deeper pride in the baseball teams than even many of us do. Their pride
and interest has been justified by the good sportsmanship of our men. The
esore has not always been on our side but the pluck and stubborn spirit of
the men have prevented any walkaway. Last yea.' we showed California
what we cou'd do. This year the faculty axe hit the team. TII3 Daily Palo
iA,lto is glad to c>tend an expression from the students of Stanford for their
work during the season.
