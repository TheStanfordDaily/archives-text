# CARDINAL VICTORY PROMISED BY CAPTAIN
## San Francisco "Dopesters" Silent on Outcome of Big Meet 
### Captain "Jess" Wells, '20 
Early in the season, when the first
call for track men was issued, things
looked unusually bright. For the first
time in several years we had a real
coaching- "staff" in Marry Maloncy and
his assistant "Dad" Moulton. At the
Soring Sports Rallv about 250 men
signed the track cards and promised to
come out. I hey did, until they found
they could sign the role and then go
home. After this the track squad dwin
dled to the present team of about thirty
men.
Weather conditions have been rather
unfavorable, but fortunately for us, the
same conditions exist across the bay.
Should it rain to-morrow the meet will
be slow and rather unpleasant to watch,
but both teams will be handicapped even
ly and the results should be the same
as they will be if the weather is good.
Competition started, with the varsity,
in a series of Informal meet/s lover
shortened distances. Several new men
appeared in these meets and were
warmly welcomed by Coach Maloney.
I he Interclass meet on March 3 was
first of a series of Cardinal victories
which will reach the climax tomorrow
when we take the eighth straight meet
from California.
Local dopesters have been busy of late
giving the meet to us by a small mar
gin. California men have been winning
the meet by a large score, backing their
guesses by the comparative times and
scores in the meets with U. S. C. and
Redlands and Pamona. There is one
thing, however, that they are forgetting
and that is that in nearlv every meet
we cut out some event because the rival
team was weak there, while California
added the nine points to their score.
The really surprising part of the pre
season dope is the silence which is char
acterizino- several well-known and usual
ly voluable, oracles in the near-by city.
Perhaps they have been consulting the
ouija board. Tn any event if the fates
do not give the "breaks'* to California
we will win. The team that will run to
morrow is the smallest, in numbers, that
has ever competed against California
and the score will be pretty even but
the string of Stanford victories will not
be broken.
