# MALONEY SAYS TRACK TEAM WILL WIN MEET
## 
### 
"I have been asked to make a state
ment t'or the readers of the Daily Palo
Alto as to our chances in our dual
meet with California Saturday after
noon next. There is not room nor
time to write even a review of the
track season. A few plain facts will,
probably, be better than anything else.
There has not been the interest shown
by the student body at large in ath
letics during the present college year.
There has been also a dearth of ma
terial, especially in track and field,
with which to round out a well-bal
anced team. The raw material is here
on the campus, but it can not be de
veloped on the Quadrangle; the place
for such development is on the track.
However, we are now on the eve of
our annual intercollegiate track meet
with California. We have a very
small but select track team with which
to meet our opponents. No one as
yet has seen these select few at their
best. The object has been to try to
have them at their best when they
would be most needed, that is, on
April 17. All that we ask for is good
weather and sunshine, and the team
can be counted upon to do the rest.
If the entire student body stands by
them on the bleachers from the first
event to the last, Stantyrd will, I feel
sure, celebrate her eighth successive
victory over her -worthy rival at Ber
keley.
H. WILFRED MALONEY."
