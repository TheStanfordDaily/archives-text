# THOS. C. GREGORY, '99, SPEAKS ON LEAGUE OF NATIONS
## EUROPEAN SITUATION IS EXPLAINED Advocates the Immediate Adoption of League Covenant 
### 
"If we fail to adopt the Treaty with
a League of Nations and fail to enter
upon a sensible foreign policy design
ed for the benefit of our industrial and
agricultural producers, we will not
only cut off our market but will render
the present European governments
less able to withstand the pressure
of reaction on the one hand and of
radicalism on the other," said Thomas
T. C. Gregory, '99, in addressing a
University Assembly this morning. Mr.
Gregory is a Stanford trustee and a
resident of Palo Alto.
Continuing, the speaker said that
the wonderful era of prosperity which
is upon us can not continue indefin
itely. "With the damming of ex-,
ports, prices, when the terrific demand
ceases, are going down, and we may
before long be witnessing a slump
which is a necessary prerequisite to
readjustment. Our high standard of
living, the highest in the world, can
only be continued through a surplus
of production and export. The era of
high prices will continue until the
world's production has again approach
ed the normal."
"Another war is inevitable unless
matters in Europe are quickly read
justed and a definite agreement be
tween go vernments is reached," said
Mr. Gregory. "The present form of
the League of Nations is a minor con
sideration. The League represents to
my mind an ideal, r> state of mind, a
principle. To be sure the organ of
its expression is not yet perfected,
but for that matter neither was the
steamboat in its pioneer days or the
automobile. The machine of the
League of Nations can be perfected
only through use. We that know the
war, knew its terrific toll of sacrifice
and suffering, are willing to accept the
imperfect machine for the sake of the
principle which prompts it."
"America does not wish to be in
volved with Europe politically any
more than is necessary, but she
should engage in close business rela
tions with Europe; she should be con
cerned economically in world affairs.
Right now Europe stands in need of
credit. Industry is at a standstill, the
people are idle because there is no
money available to start the baseness
world ro?'ng again. America's duty
and privilege is plain: To supply
Europe with the necessary credit.
This business backing can not come
from the government; it must come
from the people of tlie United State3
through the great financiers. Let us
prove that the United States is not
insular but vitally concerned in the
welfare of other peoples."
