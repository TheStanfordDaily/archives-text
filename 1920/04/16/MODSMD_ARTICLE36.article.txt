## 
### 
Mine. Amelita Galli-Curci, who will be
heard in a concert here this month, is
said to be one of the most delightful
women of the lyric stage. She lias al
ways been a special favorite of the Royal
Family of Spain from whom she has re
ceived many tokens of esteem.
In other parts of the world she has
been honored to the same degree, and
every country that she has visited wants
her back. ,
At the present time her contract with
the Chicago Opera Compativ has held
her in America and she decided to visit
the western states this season.
Her appearance in New York and
Chicago have been marked with the
greatest amount of enthusiasm possible,
and many dignified audiences have
cheered and waved handkerchiefs to give
vent to their joy.
