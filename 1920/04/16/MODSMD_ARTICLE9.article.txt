# VACHEL LINDSAY TO VISIT CAMPUS SOON
## "Poet of the Small Towns" Will Address Campus Organizations 
### 
Vachel Linsay, the well-known poet
and lecturer, will arrive on the campus
Monday for a two days' visit. During
his stay here Mr. Lindsay will address
various classes and organizations, among
them the English Club, and Professor
Carruth's class in "Verse Writing." He
will read from his verses, in the Assem
bly Hall, on Tuesday evening.
Mr. Lindsay has often been called
"the poet of the little towns," for he is
a strong admirer of small town life,
and many of his poems are concerned
with it. He is a unique individual in
many ways aside from his reputation as
a poet. In 1912 he undertook an in
teresting experiment, walking from Illi
nois to New Mexico and selling rhymes
and filling speaking engagements along
the way. As an outcome of his walk
he published a book entiteld "Adventures
While Preaching th.e Gosoel of Beauty."
