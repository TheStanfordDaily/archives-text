* I ''HIRTY denominations of the Church are uniting in
a simultaneous campaign in the week of April 25th-
May 2nd.
They are uniting because the task before the Church is
too great for any one denomination; because there must be
no duplication of effort; no waste.
These churches know that the world needs many things;
but it needs Faith most of aIL
They know that there can be no final solution of our
economic problems that is not a spiritual solution, based
on the teachings of Jesus Christ and His Golden Rule.

and (4) hospitals supported by the Churches, (5) the reli

for the Church's ministers.

increase his contribution by only a few J Jl
dollars the whole amount would be J jg®. /
