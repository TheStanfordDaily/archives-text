# THREE CARDINAL CREWS BEATEN BY CALIFORNIA BEARS
## Freshman Eight Loses by Two Lengths in Closest Event of the Day 
### C.M. Jenks, '22 
Three Stanford eights went down to
defeat before the victorious California
crews on the Oakland Estuary last
Saturday morning. The best race of
the day was furnished by the freshmen
crews. The California babes finished
a scarce two lengths in the lead of the
much lighter Cardinal eight. The
Varsity race was California's from the
start. The Blue and Gold boat took
the lead with the crack of the gun
and gradually pulled out, crossing the
line three lengths in the lead. The
second varsity turned out to be a race
between the California second and
third varsities with the Cardinal sec
ond varsity trailiijg eight lengths ia
rear of the winning Bruin second
boat.
The main race of the day, between
the two varsity boats, showed Stan
ford's lack of coaching. The Cali
fornia eight took the lead with a per
fect start. The Stanford shell fought
the entire distance trying to catch the
Blue and Gold boat but the "Cal." boat,
pulling a slow stroke with a fast catch
at the end, was able to increase the
lead established at the start and cros
sed the line with two Ingths of open
water between the shells. The Cardi
nal eight had the advantage of weight
and height over the California men
but they lacked the steady stroke and
perfect team work that comes only
with daily coaching. The Stanford men
fought every inch of the three miles
but their short fast stroke did not
carry the power behind it that was
necessary to send the men to victory.
The rough water made the time rather
slow, the California boat crossing the
credit is due Coach Maloney and "Dad"
Moulton, his assistant, for the way in
which they handled the Cardinal team.
Working with the smallest track squad
that Stanford has had in the last ten
years, the Stanford coach did all that
could he expected with his men.

boat.
The main race of the day, between
the two varsity boats, showed Stan
ford's lack of coaching. The Cali
fornia eight took the lead with a per
fect start. The Stanford shell fought
the entire distance trying to catch the
Blue and Gold boat but the "Cal." boat,
pulling a slow stroke with a fast catch
at the end, was able to increase the
lead established at the start and cros
sed the line with two Ingths of open
water between the shells. The Cardi
nal eight had the advantage of weight
and height over the California men
but they lacked the steady stroke and
perfect team work that comes only
with daily coaching. The Stanford men
fought every inch of the three miles
but their short fast stroke did not
carry the power behind it that was
necessary to send the men to victory.
The rough water made the time rather
slow, the California boat crossing the
credit is due Coach Maloney and "Dad"
Moulton, his assistant, for the way in
which they handled the Cardinal team.
Working with the smallest track squad
that Stanford has had in the last ten
years, the Stanford coach did all that
could he expected with his men.

Three Stanford eights went down to
defeat before the victorious California
crews on the Oakland Estuary last
Saturday morning. The best race of
the day was furnished by the freshmen
crews. The California babes finished
a scarce two lengths in the lead of the
much lighter Cardinal eight. The
Varsity race was California's from the
start. The Blue and Gold boat took
the lead with the crack of the gun
and gradually pulled out, crossing the
line three lengths in the lead. The
second varsity turned out to be a race
between the California second and
third varsities with the Cardinal sec
ond varsity trailiijg eight lengths ia
