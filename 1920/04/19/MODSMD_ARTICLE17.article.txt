"Mr. Morgan was one of the most
valuable members of the Board of Trus
tees. He was always thoroughly inter

life and willing at any time to render
unselfish service without regard to his
personal business or to the amount of
time involved, lie was one of the mem
bers of the Board who spent one or more
whole days each year checking up per
sonally on the bonds owned by the Uni
versity. He had an unusual knowledge
of accounting and of large business
problems. The University has had the
benefit of his advice during the recent
reorganization of the finances. He will
be very much missed by all of his as
sociates on the l+oard. Every Stanford
man should be grateful to him for his
years of quiet, disinterested and helpful
work of the University."

Board, said:
"I am deeply shocked to learn of the
death of niv fellow trustee, Percy T.
Morgan, lie lias been a member of
the Finance Committee since he first
came to the Board of Trustees. He has
rendered invaluable help not only in
recommendations in regard to invest
ments, but also in handling the detail
of many of the financial problems of
the University. He had an unsual skill
with figures. I lis long experience with
many diverse large business enterprises
made it possible for him to render much
service in the recent reorganization of
the University's business. Only those
who have been in close contact with him
(in the Board can realize how great the
loss to the University has been. Ilis
work was always quiet, thorough, and
unselfish.
