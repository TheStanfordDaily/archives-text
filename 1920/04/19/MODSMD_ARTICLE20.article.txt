# A 						LOSS TO THE UNIVERSITY
## 
### 
TIHE death of P. T. Morgan, a member of the Board of Trustees and well
known in financial circles, was received on the campus with the sincerest
regret by those who knew Mr. Morgan. A1 all times Mr. Morgan served the
University with untiring effort and patience. The tragedy of his death is
poignant to even those who did not have the privilege of knowing Mr. Morgan.
A man of strong principles and commanding personality, Mr. Morgan always
acted as a strong influence for good in this community.
Mr. Morgan had suffered from ill health since 1911. In 1914 he went to
Europe. Upon his return he sustained injuries in an automobile accident
which were slow in healing and finally resulted in Mr. Morgan going East
for treatment at Johns Hopkins. Although somewhat improved in health,
Mr. Morgan returned to California far from recovered health. The long
and continued illness of so active a man as Mr. Morgan, lead to the final
tragedy when he took his life Friday morning.
The University will feel the loss of Mr. Morgan most keenly. Although
in recent years Mr. Morgan spent considerable time in Europe after his retire
ment from active business life, he always kept in active touch with the Uni
versity. His home in Los Altos, practically in the Stanford neighborhood,
stands as one of the beauty spots of the Peninsula so that university acquaint
ances felt that Mr. Morgan was an intimate part of Stanford life. The Board
of Trustees will have a difficult task in finding a man who can adequately
fill the vacancy left by Mr. Morgan on the Board.
