# STUDENT RESPONSIBILITY FOR CREW
## 
### 
17VERY Stanford man or woman who saw the crew races Saturday morning
was not impressed so much, with the l'act that our men lost as they were
with the fact that they showed up as. well as they did. It was apparent to
everyone that the equipment which our men were forced to use was a dis
grace. Our oars were broken and the shells were hopelessly out of repair.
The men had done the best that could have been expected in patching but
when the time came for the Cardinal showing, they went out knowing that
the University had not backed up the months of work they had given to train
ing with the equipment which would let them show what they were capable
of doing.
The future of crew at Stanford is undoubtedly hanging in the balance.
Men cannot be expected to be willing to turn out in the future if this year's
experience is going to be repeated. Some means must be devised to meet the
requirements of crew or give the sport up entirely. Crew has a long victorious
record behind it and has earned the support of Stanford men and women.
The question now is are we going to meet the problem or are we going to
sit back and let the sport die which has added so much to the glory of Stan
ford? The time has come for action and intelligent thinking. The Daily
Palo Alto sees only one way to vindicate this year's failure and that is to
come to the front for next year's crew.

P. F. NEER, '22, and J. M. DAVIES, '22, added laurels to the Stanford
tennis record when they went down to the Ojai Valley Tennis Tournaments
and came back with everything in sight. Eight cups went to the two Stan
ford men as result of their coming hack strong at the opponents who defeated
them only a week ago. Tennis is not followed with the interest which it de
serves at Stanford. In many other Universities tennis is a major sport. Stan
ford is fortunate in having a few strong tennis players who keep the sport
alive.

WE are glad to note that somebody can make an impression on the Men's
Council as far as roughing is concerned. If the roughs are forbidden to look
in on the dances given in the Women's Clubhouse maybe they will come to
