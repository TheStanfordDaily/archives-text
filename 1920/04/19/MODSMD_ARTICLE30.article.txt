# EUROPEAN STUDENTS ASK FOR FOOD RELIEF
## Suggest Aid Through Hoover System of American Warehouses 
### 
Appeals are reaching Stanford from
university students and faculties in
Austria and Hungary for food relief,
in order that students in those coun
tries many continue their educational
work and that tendency towards dan
gerous radicalism among undergradu
ates may be checked. The faculties
of the various universities say that
outbreaks in student bodies are the
result of norvous desperation due to
under-nouribhmen and to the worry
on the students' part over the situa
tion among their families as shown
to them by letters from home.
The most effective means of relief
suggested by American university
men is through the American relief
warehouses which have been estab
lished under Herbert Hoover's . direc
tion in these countries and the pos
sibility of sending food immediately
from these warehouses by means of
.American Relief Administration's
system of "food drafts." These food
drafts may be purchased of banks in
the United States and call for the
immediate distribution of the amount
of food paid for here from the ware
houses in accordance with the instruc
tions of the draft purchasers. It is the
most reliable way in existence of in
suring the speedy receipt of assist
ance.
The faculty of Columbia University
has organized a Relief Committee
the students to aid the faculty
and students at the University of
Vienna in this way and have sent
word through Dr. Jordan that Stan
ford might profitably organize such
,a committee for the relief of some
other university.

Dr. Jordan has also received for
transmission to the University a copy
of an appeal to the universities and
high schools of the United States for
the aid of German university students
from Dr. Foerster of the University
of Munich. Dr. Foerster is one of the
most distinguished scholars in Ger
many, and one who held out vigorously
from the first to last against the mili
tary and economic policies of the
Kaiser and his pan-Germanic advisors.
Dr. Foerster writes from Switzerland
and quotes from a teacher in Munich
as typical of the whole situation:
"What we need before anything else
is to be quickly provided with victu
als from foreign countries. Besides
we want worn clothes, linen and shoes.
Such gifts would indeed in our pres
ent situation constitute our last hope
to save from utter ruin between two
and three thousand youths and girls
studying at the high schools of
Munich."
