# BRUINS FINALLY WIN TRACK MEET FROM CARDINAL
## Hopes For Eighth Straight Victory Vanish When U.C. Wins Relay 
### E.E. Crowe, '21 
Stanford failed to "make it eight
straight" from the University of Cali
fornia Saturday in the annual track
meet between the two institutions, and
the Cardinal varsity lost to the Blue
and Gold by the count of 70 to 61. As
Coach Maloney had figured the meet
hinged on the relay, and he had placed
all of is hopes on his best possible com
bination, Wells, Hertel, Schofield, and
Kirksey. Wells and Kirksey, although
sprinters, ran great races in their quar
ter-mile laps, but they were not fast
enough to head Walter Christie's team.
Morris Kirksey and Captain Jess
Wells were the individual stars for Stan
ford, and Johnny Merchant starred for
California with 14 "points. Kirksey won
(the 100-yard dash and the 220-yard
dash with ease and placed second in the
discus throw. His time of 212-5 in the
220-yard dash was not allowed because
of the strong wind that was blowing.
Captain 1 Wells came through almost as
well as he did last year, tying for first
against Grunsky in the high hurdles and
winning the low hurdles in 24 1-5, tying
the conference record. Wells unset the
dope sheet by tying Grunskv in the high
hurdles, as the Blue and Gold star was
figured to have the edge.
Haskell failed to place in the mile,
which was a blow to the Stanford dope
sters, but Eddleman and Adams par
tially made up the points lost by taking
third places in the 2-mile and shot-put
events, respectively. True to dope, Stan
ford took all places in the high jump.
Templeton cleared the bar at 6 feet 4
inches. Templeton placed second tu
Johnny Merchant in the broad jump.
In the pole vault, Norman Green failed
to do better than 12 feet 1 inch and
tied with Captain Peterson of California
for first place. Wilcox took third place
after he was forced to retire with an in
jured foot.
Hanner of Stanford added five points
to the Stanford column bv hurling the
javelin out 165 feet 9 inches, beating
Merchant by two *ket. <
