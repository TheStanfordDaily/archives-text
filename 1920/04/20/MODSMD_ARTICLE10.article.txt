# INVITE A GUEST' NEW SLOGAN FOR SPRING CARNIVAL
## Preparations Fast Rounding Into Shape For Big Gala Night 
### 
Invite a guest to the Spring Carnival!
Every student who has a friend or
relative within "coming distance" of
Stanford is urged by the Student Body
Spring Carnival Committee to ask that
person as a guest for the Carnival at
Encina Gymnasium next Friday night.
The committee decided to make the Car
nival a peninsula affair today, and with
that in view is making the suggestion
that the Carnival be brought to the at
tention of outsiders in this manner.
Preparations for the Carnival are rap
idly rounding into shape under'the di
rection of the committee and the rep
resevtatives (if the various organizations.
With the King and Queen contest over,
the committee has turned its attention to
the construction work for the conces
sions that will be necessary at Encina
gymnasium. The construction work is
under the immediate supervision of C.
S. Hobbs, '19. Details will be handled
entirely by Hobbs. The concessions will
be in the enclosure at the rear of the
gymnasium for the most part, but a few
will be placed in the hallways. The main
gymnasium pavilion will be devoted to
dancing.
Arrangements have been made by the
Carnival Committee for special 1 o'clock
cars from the gymnasium to Palo Alto
to accommodate those attending from
there.
The Row will be taken care of as far
as transportation is concerned by the
Hammer and Coffin Society, which will
run a large bus between the fraternity
and sorority houses and Encina gymna
sium. This will be Hammer and Coffin's
concession. The fare will be ten cents
a passenger, and the proceeds will go
for the benefit of the Student Body, the
same as the other proceeds of the Car
nival.
A new feature of the Carnival this
year will be a printed program, which
has been assembled by Loraine West, '21,
a member of the Carnival Committee.
This program will contain the official an
nouncement of the rvening!s" amuse
ments.
All sales for the evening have been
placed in the hands of Mary Larcent,
'21, another member of the committee.
Members of the 500, appronriately cos
tumed, wilj sell tickets under Miss Lar
gent's direction.
The committee is striving this year to
set a high standard for future spring
carnivals. The concessions all have been
gone over in detail, and the program
of amusements contains nothing but
hi<ih-class entertainment.
