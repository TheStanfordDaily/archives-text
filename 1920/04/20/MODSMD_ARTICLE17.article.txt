# FACULTY MEMBERS TALK TO BODY OF FRATERNITY MEN
## Dr. Mitchell and President Wilbur Present Two Points of View 
### 
Two different views regarding the so
lution of the fraternity question at Stan
ford were presented to the fraternity
men at the smoker given by the Inter
fraternity Conference last night.
Dr. J. Pearce Mitchell of the Depart
ment of Chemistry was the first speaker
of the evening. Dr. Mitchell is a mem
ber of the class of '03 and is a frater
nity man himself. He explained to his
audience that every college in America
is going through a period of reconstruc
tion at this time, and that the place
which fraternities occupy at the end of
this period will be judged entirely by
their justification. Stating that the aim
of a fraternity was two-fold, social and
academic, lie reminded the men that the
fundamental purpose for their attendance
here was for the acquisition of knowl
edge. He further said that the unpleas
ant fact that the average grade of a
fraternity man was slightly below that
of the general average was not con
clusive in the assumption that the worth
of the organization could be judged by
its standing in scholarship. The meth
ods and standards of marking, he said,
were in a large measure artificial, but
were the best method yet discovered.
In closing, Dr. Mitchell said that the rec
ord which the fraternities make now will
have a large influence on their existence
in the future, and that if a good record
were made the impression made on the
authorities would be very favorable.
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur next spoke
to the men at the meeting and explained
his policy in regard to his actions on the
fraternity question. He said that it was
his duty to look ahead and to forsee the
thing which would be the best for Stan
ford in the future. He explained that a
university, to be successful, must increase
yearly, and that he has had the oppor
tunity of seeing this institution and its
organization grow from the date of their
founding. College fraternities have their
ups and downs, he said; they are not
uniformly successful, nor are they uni
formly backed by their alumni. He add
°d. however that there was something
about college fraternities which help
college men and that as a whole they
were high in their ideals. It is his plan,
as he explained it, not to do away with
the fraternity system, but to supplant the
chapter house system with a system of
university dormitories. This, he said,
would make tlie cost of living cheaper
and within the reach of all and would
promote the strong democratic spirit for
which Stanford is so noted. Dr. Wilbur
requested the fraternity men to look at
the question with an impersonal, cold
blooded point of view. The proposed
change will not come during the time
of the present generation and is therefore
worthy of impersonal consideration, he
said. In summing up his policy Dr. Wil
bur said that it was his hope and plan
to bring about the proposed change for
the betterment of Staiifo'rd find for
the promotion of the prevalent demo
cratic spirit.
Previous to the speeches by these
men a jazz orchestra furnished enter
tainment. and several songs were sung
by the Glee Club quartet. A. A. Cur
tice, '19. acted as chairman of the meet
ing. Following the addresses, a three
round boxing bout was staged. Eats
and smokes were served following the
entertainment.

worthy of impersonal consideration, he
said. In summing up his policy Dr. Wil
bur said that it was his hope and plan
to bring about the proposed change for
the betterment of Staiifo'rd find for
the promotion of the prevalent demo
cratic spirit.
Previous to the speeches by these
men a jazz orchestra furnished enter
tainment. and several songs were sung
by the Glee Club quartet. A. A. Cur
tice, '19. acted as chairman of the meet
ing. Following the addresses, a three
round boxing bout was staged. Eats
and smokes were served following the
entertainment.
Two different views regarding the so
lution of the fraternity question at Stan
ford were presented to the fraternity
men at the smoker given by the Inter
fraternity Conference last night.
Dr. J. Pearce Mitchell of the Depart
ment of Chemistry was the first speaker
of the evening. Dr. Mitchell is a mem
ber of the class of '03 and is a frater
nity man himself. He explained to his
audience that every college in America
is going through a period of reconstruc
tion at this time, and that the place
which fraternities occupy at the end of
this period will be judged entirely by
their justification. Stating that the aim
of a fraternity was two-fold, social and
academic, lie reminded the men that the
fundamental purpose for their attendance
here was for the acquisition of knowl
edge. He further said that the unpleas
ant fact that the average grade of a
fraternity man was slightly below that
of the general average was not con
clusive in the assumption that the worth
of the organization could be judged by
its standing in scholarship. The meth
ods and standards of marking, he said,
were in a large measure artificial, but
were the best method yet discovered.
In closing, Dr. Mitchell said that the rec
ord which the fraternities make now will
have a large influence on their existence
in the future, and that if a good record
were made the impression made on the
authorities would be very favorable.
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur next spoke
to the men at the meeting and explained
his policy in regard to his actions on the
fraternity question. He said that it was
his duty to look ahead and to forsee the
thing which would be the best for Stan
ford in the future. He explained that a
university, to be successful, must increase
yearly, and that he has had the oppor
tunity of seeing this institution and its
organization grow from the date of their
founding. College fraternities have their
ups and downs, he said; they are not
uniformly successful, nor are they uni
formly backed by their alumni. He add
°d. however that there was something
about college fraternities which help
college men and that as a whole they
were high in their ideals. It is his plan,
as he explained it, not to do away with
the fraternity system, but to supplant the
chapter house system with a system of
university dormitories. This, he said,
would make tlie cost of living cheaper
and within the reach of all and would
promote the strong democratic spirit for
which Stanford is so noted. Dr. Wilbur
requested the fraternity men to look at
the question with an impersonal, cold
blooded point of view. The proposed
change will not come during the time
of the present generation and is therefore
worthy of impersonal consideration, he
said. In summing up his policy Dr. Wil
bur said that it was his hope and plan
to bring about the proposed change for
the betterment of Staiifo'rd find for

cratic spirit.
