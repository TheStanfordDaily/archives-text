# TEAM IS CHOSEN TO MEET DEBATERS OF "CAL." TOMORROW
## 
### 
C. G. Smith, '22; H. A. Fendler, '22;
and E. H. Landel, '21, will represent
Euphronia tomorrow evening in their
debate against the Congress, a for
ensic society of California. The three
have been working diligently for the
contest for several weeks and are
thus in good debating form for the
argument. Fendler is a debater of
some experience having participated
in the annual contest between Nestoria
and Euphronia this year. Landel is
new in the inter-society debating but
is showing himself to be of inter
collegiate caliber. Smith was on the
team which debated the College of
Pacific last December.
The Congress will bank their hopes
on R. T. Jomper, '23, A. E. Murphy,
'23, and J. G. Benson. '22. Murphy
attended Stanford for the first quar
ter of the year. While here he was
an alternate for the varsity debate
team that met Berkeley last fall. He
will prove a dangerous contender for
the local men.
The question which will be discuss
ed tomorrow evening will be whether
or not university teachers should or
ganize and affiliate with the American
Federation of Labor. The Euphronia
team will oppose the measure.
Professors Wildman, Kirkwood, and
Bassett will be the judges for the
contest. The debate will be held in
Room 12, of the Law Building, at 7:30.
