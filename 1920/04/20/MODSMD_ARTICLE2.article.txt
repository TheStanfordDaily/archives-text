Todd will fly during the morning and
afternoon of each day between now and

be given an aerial view of the cam

plane, and Mr. Todd will do some
''stunt" work as advertisement for the
Carnival.
Flight tickets may be obtained from
any member of the Carnival Executive
Committee or on the Polo Field. Tlicy
