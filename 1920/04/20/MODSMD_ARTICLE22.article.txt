# DEFINE THE FRATERNITY ISSUES
## 
### 
THE fraternity situation on the campus is discussed more than outward
appearances might indicate as a number of national officers of various
fraternities and sororities have been visiting on the campus. Extreme and
ridiculous reports have gotten out in the East concerning university action
which even goes so far as to say that all fraternity houses have been sold
and that chapters are handing in their charters. With such impressions
rampant it is necessary that the fraternity men and women of the campus
think clearly and intelligently on the situation. This will necessitate a clear
definition of the issues involved.
As soon as outsiders as well as students on the campus recognize the
fact that the University is not concerning itself with fraternity organizations
as such in any way, the sooner they will be able to meet the problem on
common ground with the university authorities. To the administration the
problem is purely one of housing its students adequately. In other words the
question is not that of the continued existence of the fraternity but purely
an economic question even though it may vitally affect fraternity organiza
tion.
Although these two issues are difficult to separate clearly it is essential
that those who are anxious to accomplish anything along mediatory lines must
meet President Wilbur upon his own ground. Plans for housing have been
completed as the result of long study and deliberation and only those plans
which show thought and deliberation on the part of those who would change
the plans already worked out by the University, will even be considered.
As far as the women are concerned, the question has practically resolved
itself down to their advocating a small unit system and in order to get the
small unit they must prove that it can be maintained economically as a pay
ing investment. Just what the issues will be for the men have not yet been
determined but the same proposition will hold true. Any argument pre
sented against the proposed change must be considered as a business proposi
tion.
If the fraternity men and women will recognize these factors in the situa
tion, they will be able to meet the question on a sane basis and avoid the
hysterical, empty arguments which come in the first discussion of any
radical change. The fraternity men and women of the campus must prove
their right to a hearing by sane and logical thinking which includes a clear
presentation of the real situation and issues to outsiders visiting the campus.
