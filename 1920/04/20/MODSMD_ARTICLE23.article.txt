# ATHLETICS STILL GOING STRONG
## 
### 
fPHE social calendar for the remainder of the quarter is unusually full and
* it may cause many students of the campus to think that the athletic
season was concluded with the track meet and crew races. This is not true,
as baseball and track both run for another month. Four track meets are still
on the schedule. In the next month Stanford will meet the Oregon Agri
cultural College, Santa Clara, the P. A. A. and will be entered in the Pacific
Coast Conference Meet. The baseball team is scheduled for a trip north,
a game with Santa Clara, and the University of Washington will play Stan
ford here.
There is always a tendency to let down after the more spectacular events
of the athletic schedule are over. It is to be hoped that the men and women
of the campus will give both of these teams the needed support to keep them
doing their best. Stanford has a good chance to make a fine showing if the
student body will stand strong behind her teams.
