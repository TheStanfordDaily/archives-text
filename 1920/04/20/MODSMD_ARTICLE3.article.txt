## 
### 
Justice Holmes, of the United States
Supreme Court, in a recent case before
the tribunal, called the attention of the
council to the book of Dean C. A. Hus
ton of the Stanford Law School, "The
Enforcement of Decrees and Equity."
The book had also been cited in the brief
nf the counsel for one side during the
case, and it had discussed its position at
*<Â»me length. Professor Huston's book
was written in 1911. Dean Pound of
the Harvard Law School stated, in
reference to the case, that it was seldom
that a book was referred to as an au
thority by the Supreme Court until it
had been in print for several decades.
