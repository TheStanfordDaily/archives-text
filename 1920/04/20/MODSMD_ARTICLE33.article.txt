# STANFORD TRACK TEAM TO COMPETE IN EASTERN MEET
## Point Winners in the Pacific Coast Conference May Go to Princeton 
### 
Varsity track men who make points
in the Pacific Coast Conference track
meet at Stanford on May 15 probably
will be sent to Princeton to compete in
the annual I. C. A. A. A. A. meet, ac
cording to the plans of Coach Maloney.
Stanford must send a team east this year
in order to keep its membership in the
national organization.
As the conference meet next month
undoubtedly will be the biggest track
and field event of the West, the Stan
ford men who place in this meet will
fully qualify to enter the Princeton
classic. Coach Maloney is confident that
he will be ablbe to send a strong team.
The track team has two more meets
scheduled besides the Conference meet.
The Olympic Club will compete against
the varsity on May 1, and the Oregon
Aggies will bring a track team to Stan
ford on May 8. The meet with Santa
Clara, scheduled for this coming Sat
urday, has been called off because of
the inability of the Mission institution
to get a team together.
