his most interesting works. The lec

Lindsay is an interesting personali
ty in many ways aside from his repu
tation as a poet. He is well-accustom
ed to speaking to university students
and for many years has recited poems
before English departments in many
schools and colleges. He is also an
artist and a lecturer on other topics
than literature.
He has been interested in moving
pictures for a number of years, as he
says, "Since the photoplay is a Cali
fornia industry which I have viewed
with romantic eyes these many years."
He has lectured on the motion picture
theory illustrating his points at the
blackboard. I11 1913 he published his
book on "The Art of the Moving Pic
ture."
Among his better books aside from,
"The Art of the Moving Picture,"
are "Adventures While Preaching the
Gospel of Beauty" the outcome of his
walk which he published in 1914, and
"A Handy Guide For Beggars," which
was issued in 1916.
