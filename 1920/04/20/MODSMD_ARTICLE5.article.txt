# N.S.G.W. Plans to Preserve Landmark
## 
### 
The Palo Alto Tree is to he preserved.
This was decided yesterday at a meet
ing of the Native Sons of the Golden
West, held in San Diego, at which time
it was agreed that the society would
finance the scheme and see that the plans
were carried out.
Tree scientists say that the famous
tree will perish if not artificially nour
ished. With this in mind, the committee
in charge of the plan will have a sup
lily of tree mould deposited around the
ancient land mark. A large boulder is to
he procured upon which a bronze tablet,
fittingly worded, will be placed.
