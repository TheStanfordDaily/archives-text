# STANFORD STANDS CHANCE IN NATIONAL RIFLE TOURNAMENT
## 
### 
Competition among the principal
American colleges in rifle tournaments
indicates that Stanford will win the State
championship of California and probably
lead the western universities in the race
for the national trophy. Results of six
out of the ten weeks of intercollegiate
competition have been announced, plac
ing the Cardinal fourteenth in the list
of the highest ranking colleges. The
lead of the eastern universities is un
doubtedly due to experience gained in
previous shooting tournaments which the
big colleges of the East have conducted
for a number of years.
The last published ranking places the
Blue and Gold above the Cardinal, the
former being credited with 4668 points
and the latter with 4667. The victory
of Stanford over U. C. in the unofficial
meet of last week, however, has damp
ened the expectations of the Berkelev
riflemen that California would annex the
state championship. The local rifle men
are confident that by the end of the
series Stanford will have outdistanced
the Bruin squad.
