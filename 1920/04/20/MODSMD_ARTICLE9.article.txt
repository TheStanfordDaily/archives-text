Palo Alto High School has joined
in the protest against the high cost
of living. A hundred and twenty-five
students and six faculty members have
taken the pledge not to buy any new
dollies until prices go down.
Principal Walter H. Nichols and
Major Stanley Dugan, commandant of
the Cadet Corps, are among those who
are wearing overalls and soft shirts.
