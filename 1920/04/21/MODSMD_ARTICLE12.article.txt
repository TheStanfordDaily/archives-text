# JUNIOR OPERA IS ADAPTED BY DAVIS
## Experienced Theatrical Man Takes Hand in 1921 Production 
### 
Gordon Davis, '18, coach of many
campus dramatic- productions and play
wright. of some professional reputa
tion, has lent his talent to the 1921
Junior Opera and has adapted its plot
to fit stage production. Although the
co-authors, Miss Jean Frickelton, '20,
and Miss Mona Gardner, '19, are re
sponsible for the plot and lines of
the 1921 show, Davis through his wide
theatrical experience has developed
the staging possibilities of the material
that they have furnished him.
With this combination of writing
talent at the back of the 1921 opera,
the show ought to succeed through
sheer weight of numbers. The final
production will represent the colla
boration of some of the cleverest
amateur dramatists that have been on
the campus in years. Coach Lester
Seib, "'22, reports that in his opinion
the show is mechanically perfect on
account of Davis' skillful handling of
the staging details.
Members of the opera committee
said today that the title, "A Leap
Year Leap" was' subject to change
without notice.' This name was
chosen tentatively for the opera in
the earlier stages of the production
and the committee lias finally arrived
at. the decision that the title hardly
interprets the spirit of the book. The
new title will probably be announced
tomorrow.
Rehearsals of both cast and chorus
are now in full swing under Coach
Seib's direction. A rehearsal of the
female chorus will be held in the As
sembly Hall tonight at 7 o'clock, and
the entire chorus will meet tomorrow
night at the same time and place.
