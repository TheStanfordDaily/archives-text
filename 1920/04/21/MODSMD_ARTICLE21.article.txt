# STRAW BALLOT ON CANDIDATES TO BE TAKEN BY 'DAILY'
## Students and Faculty Will be Given Chance to Express Choice 
### R.E. Wedekind, '19 
In order to place at rest any doubt
as to the sentiment of the Stanford
campus and to obtain exact figures
on the candidates' standing here, the
Daily Palo Alto will, on next Tuesday,
conduct a straw vote on the presidenU
al candidates. This vote will be taken
among both the students and faculty
and an effort will be made to make it
as comprehensive as possible.
Details of the method in which the
vote will be taken are now being work
ed out by members of the Daily Palo
Alto staff and will be announced at a
later date. The co-operation of stu
dents and faculty is asked so that
when the figures are published it can
be said that they truly represent the
attitude of Stanford.
At present, it is planned to keep
the vote of the faculty separate from
that of the students, and also to
distinguish between the vote of the men
and of the women of the student body.
The Daily Palo Alto feels that in
asmuch as Herbert Hoover, a graduate
of Stanford and a member of the Board
of Trustees, is, in the words of the
Literary Digest, a "Presidential Pos
sibility," that the definite sentiment of
the campus community should be made
known. It is with this in view that
the vote next Teusday will be taken.
Every student should make it a
pqint to cast his or her vote. There
is no doubt but that the results of this
straw ballot will be published widely,
throughout California at least, and the
figures should indicate accurately
Stanford's choice.
The keen interest in the coming
California primaries which already has
manifested itself on the campus makes
it certain that a large vote will be
cast. The Daily Palo Alto, however,
hopes that the vote will be 100 per
cent and in order to assure such a
vote, urges those students who have
not already decided on one candidate
or the other, to do so before next
Tuesday.
Representatives of the Stanford-
Johnson Club and the Stanford-Hoover
Club will be invited by the Daly Palo
Alto to assist in counting the votes.
Announcement of the voting plan
will be made in the Daily Palo Alto in
the next few days.
