# THE 						STRAW BALLOT
## 
### 
fTHE DAILY PALO ALTO will conduct a straw ballot on Tuesday of next
week to give every man and woman on the campus the opportunity to
express his or her preference for one of the presidential candidates running
for the primary election to be held May 4 in the State of California. The
success of a straw ballot depends upon the amount of interest and co-opera
tion which is taken by the members of a community and it is to be hoped
that Stanford will respond to the efforts made on our part. The Daily Palo
Alto has declared itself in favor of Mr. Hoover and although the ballot will
be conducted largely in behalf of Hoover we feel that the Johnson-Republican
Club will back such a movement with the same enthusiasm.
The straw ballot will give both political organizations on the campus
the opportunity to know their strength and their weaknesses. Both organi
zations realize the importance of the primaries and also recognize the large
percentage of men and women on the campus who are indifferent to all
thought of a political contest. If the straw ballot will serve to arouse the
interest of some few uninterested prospective voters on the campus it will
have served its purpose.
Ballots will be printed in the Daily Palo Alto Monday night. Each stu
dent in the University is asked to cut the coupon out and send it into the
Daily Palo Alto where the votes will be counted and the result announced as
soon as possible. Undoubtedly the figures resulting from the ballot will be
taken as representative of the sentiment of the University among both stu
dents and faculty and for this reason we hope that the Daily Palo Alto will
meet with the hearty co-operation of the students of the campus.
In order to conduct the election on a fair and impartial basis, repre
sentatives from both the Hoover and Johnson-Republican Clubs will be asked
to act as officials in conducting the straw ballot. The Daily Palo Alto in this
way hopes to inspire the confidence of all those students who are interested in
the coming election.
