riLASS PICNICS have never been fostered much at Stanford, but in other j
Universities they have proved a success, particularly as a means toward
getting the members of a class acquainted. The possibilities of such func
tions at Stanford are unlimited and it is to be regretted that members of
each class do not avail themselves of the opportunities offered. Lake sports,
races, and even the old-fashioned barbeque could be worked in on an attractive
program.
Such a plan is successfully worked out at the University of Washington
on even a more ambitious scale. The all-university picnic is one of the gala
days of the social calendar and has been found effective in promoting stu
dent body unity. The undertaking there with four thousand students is'
much larger than it would be at Stanford. The Daily Palo Alto tenders this
only as a suggestion toward working for the unity of the student body as a
whole.
