## Democrats and Republicans Requested to Help Down Johnson Machine 
### 
\n appeal to campus voters to cast
ihe:r ballots for Herbert llor\er n ihe
May 4 primary was issued this morning
by the 'o<*al Hoover organization. 1 lie
autcnitnt follows:
"The Stanford Hoover Club appeals
to all campus voters to be sure and cast
their votes in the May 4 primary for
Herbert Hoover, regardless of whether
they are Democrats or Republicans.
There is no contest on in the primary
on the Democratic party, as there is but
one delegation on the ballot and that
is uninstructed. The primary law al
lows anyone who has registered in the
primary, regardless of party, to demand
whatever ballot he chooses at the polls.
Thus local Democrats may go to the
polls and register their choice for the
Republican nomination and help defeat
the Johnson political machine, which has
held the state in its grip for the last ten
years and in addition, merely in the in
terest of good government, help make
Mr. Hoover a candidate, so that both
the Republican and Democratic candi
dates in the November election will be
men whom the nation can trust, regard
less of who is the victor. The Hoover
Club also points out that it is just as
much in the interests of the Democratic
party to destroy the iron-clad grip of
the Johnson political machine as it is of
the Hoover forces. The move has been
sponsored by many of the local Demo
crats, whose second choice of a candi
date, outside of their own party, is Her
bert Hoover."
The local enrollment in the Stanford
Hoover Club has now reached 925. It
is expected that before the primaries
fully 1,500 will have been enrolled. Cir
cular letters are at present being sent out
by the club in the interests of Hoover,
and an organization of Stanford people
to thoroughly cover the entire county
is rapidly being built up. The slogan of
the movement is "Do Something for
Hoover."
