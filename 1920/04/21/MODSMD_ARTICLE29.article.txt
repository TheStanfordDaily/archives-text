# BREAKERS DEFEAT DELTA UPSILON IN SPEEDY BALL GAME
## 
### 
The Breakers stick artists put over a
9-to-4 knockout on the Delta Upsilon
nine Monday night in the first game of
their league. "Dink" Templeton, working
for the Breakers, shut the D. U.'s down
to a minimum of hits, and his support in
the field was so good that the fraternity
men were unable to collect on their few
hits. Delta Upsilon was fast in the field,
but unable to stop the hitting of the
Breakers nine. All the members of the
Breakers seemed to be able to pound
the horsehide over the lot, and only by
the greatest work were the 1). U. men
able to hold the Breakers to the score
that they finally got awn- with.
Delta Tan Delta and I\. A. fought out
a more or less slow game, although the
score was not as hiÂ»h as in the D. IJ.-
Breakers game. Kappa Alpha won bv
the score of 7 to 5.
Encina Third forfeited to El Toro,
and the Sequoia Second Floor nine to
Theta Delta Chi.
