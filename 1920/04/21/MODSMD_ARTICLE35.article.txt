# FIELD ARTILLERY DAY PLANNED AT STANFORD
## Polo and Rifle Teams Will Feature Exhibitions During Program 
### 
Tentative plans for a Field Artillery
Day in May have been formulated, ac
cording to an announcement this morn
ing by Captain Collins, commandant of
the Stanford Artillery Unit. The local
R. O. T. C. units intend to make the
day the occasion for the most extensive
military exhibition of the year by any
western university. Recent important
additions to the artillery equipment will
enable the Stanford units to make a com
plete displav of the methods of modern
warfare. The infantry unit under the
direction of Captain Howard will assist
the artillerymen in the disolay.
Competition among sections of the
military companies will form the basis
for the day's exhibition. Expert horse
manship will be required in the horse
races scheduled. A relay race between
the best riders of the units will be the
concluding event of the races.
The polo team which lately began
spring practice will be seen in action
for the first time in two polo matches.
With a few more weeks of intensive
practice, Captain Collins, polo coach, ex
pects to whip his material into two fast
teams.
The crack riflemen who defeated Cali
fornia last week are scheduled to give
a display. In addition, exhibition gun

drills, fancy riding, and monkey drill
will be featured on the day's program.
The Hearst Movie Weekly has asked
permission to take moving pictures of
the exhibition, announced the military
instructor. Though the Stanford unit
is not the largest company in the coun
try, the thorough training of the artil
lerymen give it the preference of the

relay. Sprott is one of the mainstays
of the Blue and Gold football team,
as well as a track star.
