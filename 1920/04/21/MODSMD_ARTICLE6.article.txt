# Fearless Queener Makes History in Carnival Plane
## 
### 
Campus queening was lifted to a new
plane, an air-plane, this afternoon,
when Miss Eleanor Anderson, '22, was
the guest of Walter J. Reid, Sp., on a
trip above the campus. The trip was
made in the plane of E. T. Todd, ex
'2o, who is flying from the Polo Feld,
east of Encina Hall, in the interest
of the Spring Carnival. This is the
first of a number of queening trips
arranged to boost this year's Carnival.
Raffles are being conducted among
the various living groups on the cam
pus for the flight tickets, entitling the
holders to rides in the Carnival plane.
Tomorrow afternoon the king and the
queen of the Carnival will fly over the
campus at 2 o'clock on an inspection
of the carnival grounds.
Court adherents and carnival enthu
siasts are urged to make flight ap
pointments with the Carnival pilot any
morning or afternoon of this week,
at the Polo Field, since a part of the
proceeds of each trip accrues to the
spring festival expense fund.
If any flying fan is eager for a few
additional thrills in the form of aerial
stunting, pilot Todd has signified his
acquiscences to provide the necessary
tremors by indulging his guests with
the latest in acrobatics. "I can assure
anybody taking trips he will see the
University in an entirely different as
pect than ever before," says the flyer.
