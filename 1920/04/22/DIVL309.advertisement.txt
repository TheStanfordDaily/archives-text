"The New Republic" editorially after pointing out
the reasons for Mr. Hoover's nomination closes with
this paragraph:
"Mr. Hoover cannot afford to destroy the influence
of men like Senator Johnson. He cannot afford to
disperse progressive strength at this juncture and it
would have been better for him not to enter the Cali
fornia primaries, and to have stood there as he stands
in the rest of the nation. If he must contest California,
he will do well to remind his supporters that they are
dealing with a veteran who as Governor, progressive
leader and United States Senator has earned the respect
and appreciation of American progressives. No man
can destroy Hiram Johnson's position and call it a good
day's work."
