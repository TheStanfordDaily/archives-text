# Royalty Invades Mysteries of The Cloud Swept Sky
## 
### 
Popularity alone has conceded Ed
ward Hendrson and Melba Berry the
right to reign supreme at the carnival
which opens tomorrow night, but this
afternoon they reigned on high.
The days when royal kingships cov
ered their domains on black chargers
or high-powered automobiles have
been blotted into the buried past, with
the innovation of aeronautics.
Stanford's king and queen were the
recipients of tail spins, left Immel
mans and barrel hoops this afternoon
when they soared through the cloud
swept skies safely tucked into the
carnival aeroplane.
E. T. Todd, ex-'2O, manager of the
flight and aeroplane stunts during the
carnival, and the carnival committee,
made it possible for this afternoon's
sail.
Aeroplane flights will be in style
tomorrow night during the carnival
revelry. Flight tickets will be raffled
by the committee. A liberal percent
age of receipts will be placed in the
carnival fund.
