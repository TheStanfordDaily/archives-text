## Santa Clara Has Fast Club; Parker Replaces Kline; Berg to Pitch 
### 
hollowing a two weeks' seige of train
ing, the varsity baseball team will essay
a comeback against Santa Clara next
Saturday afternoon on the local lot. San
ta Clara, as usual, boasts of a classy ball
team, and they are confident that they
can best the Cardinal nine.
( Since the disasters at the hands of the
Ilruins, Coach Evans lias been puttin?
the team through stiff workouts daily,
1 hey arc now a greatly improved outfit
over the one that last anneared against
California. No great changes have been
made in the line-up except in right field,
where Parker will hold forth in place
of Kline. Kline will be missed on ac
count (if his hitting, but Parker can be
counted on to make his presence in the
line-up felt both in the field and with
the willow.
Bob Pelouze, one of the pitchers
of last year's varsity, may start the game
against the prune-pickers. Pelouze
pitched line hall in the series against
California last year. This will be his
first appearance on the diamond this
season, but lie is confident that he can
twirl the same brand of baseball as be
fore. Draper, Briggs, and Newlands
will act as reserve pitchers.
The personnel of the Santa Clara team
is not known, but their record shows
that they have defeated many of the
fastest clubs out of San Francisco.
"Lefty"' I'erg, mainstay of last year's
team, will probably start the game.
