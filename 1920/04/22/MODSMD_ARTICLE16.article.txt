Additional try-outs for tlu> Xcstoria
teams which will debate St. Ignatius
University on May 12 will be held this
evening in room 12 of the Law Building.
A few weeks ago try-outs for the teams
were held, but since then the decision
of the club to have three-men teams
necessitated additional try-outs. There
will be two members of the society
chosen this evening to complete the list
of contestants.
The subject for the try-outs this eve
ning will be the same as will be de
bated in the final contest between the
two organizations, namely, "Resolved,
That the railroads of the country should
be government owned and operated."
All those of the club who did not make
the teams at the original try-outs will
be eligible.
