# THE MARDI GRAS OF THE FARM
## 
### 
PREPARATIONS for the Carnival are fairly completed and the campus
*â–  is ready for the gala event of the Spring Quarter. The Carnival commit
tee have put time, thought, and money into making this occasion worthy of
the purpose for which the money is being raised. Every possible conces
sion will be offered for the amusement of those attending. As the Carnival
poster says, "A Circus of 30 Shows, Free Open Air Entertainment, Free Div
ing and Swimming Exhibitions, Crazy House, Tabloid Junior Opera, Slides,
House of Temptation, '49 Camps, Cafes, Fashion Show, Freaks, Gypsy Camp,
Brilliant Lighting Effect and a Multitude of other Side Shows and Con
cessions."
The Spring Carnival is well on its way toward becoming an annual
event on the Stanford campus. This year promises to rival anything of the
kind which has ever been put on in past years and there is no reason why
support from the peninsula could not be worked up that Stanford would have
something which would be counted upon as one of the events of spring. In
order to get this across, however, the campus must not only give their time
to get up the concessions but they must give their money tomorrow night.
There will be plenty of temptations to make a hole in the pocketbook and
we optimistically think that each concession will be worth the price of ad
mission. Last year's Carnival showed what could be done on a short notice.
This year the committee and all those interested in the side shows have
devoted time and thought to working out something clever so that the com
ing Carnival will offer something far surpassing the efforts of last year. To
morrow night ought to make history for an annual Carnival on the Farm
so on with the Mammoth Mardi Gras!
