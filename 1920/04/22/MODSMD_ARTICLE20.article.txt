# THE 						IMPORTANCE OF TOMORROW'S ASSEMBLY
## 
### 
TOMORROW MORNING at 11 o'clock, Mr. John Collier, well-known for his
work in building up community centers, will address a university assembly
which promises to be one of the finest which the students of the University
have had the privilege of attending this year. Mr. Collier is engaged in one
of the most sweeping programs of after-war reconstruction work which has
come to our attention in some time.
There is a movement to enact a compulsory education proposal for all
young men between the ages of 18 and 21, who do not attend high schools
and who do not possess the knowledge equivalent to that taught in the sixth
grade. Such an act seems almost ridiculous to many of us in the West, but
to those who have lived in the congested cities of the East where the immi
grant is so much more a problem than on the Pacific Coast, the proposed
act is one of the most progressive steps ever taken in educational lines.
Mr. Collier's subject, "The Position of the Immigrant in Our Social Pro
gram" will no doubt deal with this educational movement.
College men and women should be particularly interested in what Mr.
Collier has to say as a part of a very small minority which has had the
privilege of higher education. College graduates will furnish the teachers
to carry on the work. If there is anything which the undergraduate can do
in this line, he should be informed and ready for the task. Tomorrow morn
ing, Mr. Collier will explain the situation and the conditions which lead to
such a measure and will probably touch on the part of the college man or
woman in this work. His address will be a part of Americanization and
good citizenship and as such should be heard by every man and woman in
the University.
