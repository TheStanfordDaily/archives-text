# MALONEY CLAIMS NATIONAL INTEREST FOR ENGLSH GAME
## American Representation In Rugby at Antwerp Popular 
### 
America will be represented at the j
Olympiad next summer in Antwerp by 1
a rugby team which will stand for a,
national and not a sectional sport.
That interest in entering a rugby team
is confined to certain sections of the
Pacific Coast is a false impression
held by certain sporting writers, was
the substance of a statement issued
today by Harry Maloney, president of
the California Rugby Union. Not only
have prominent eastern athletic clubs
and leading journals given unusual
attention to the entry of a rugby team
in the international classic but pro
posals for active co-operation have
been made by eastern athletes.
Herbert W. Clock of New York City
has written to Maloney that a rugby
team is being trained in the east to
provide for possible Inter-Sectional
rugby competition in America. Clock,
who played in the Inter-Allied meets
in Paris last year, asserts that unex- j
pected interest in the playing of the
English game is being shown by east
ern schools and clubs.
Rugby matches will possibly be
staged in New York City between two
sectional fifteens prior to the sailing
of the All-American squad for Ant
werp. An East vs. West battle would
fill the Polo Grounds of New York
recently declared a prominent New
Yorw sportsman.
Plans for America's representation
in other sports are well advanced. A
meeting of the American Olympic
committee was lately hell in the
rooms of the New York Athletic Club
at which details of the coming world
classic was minutely discussed and
plans formulated. Selection of places
and dates for the track and field try
outs for the American squad was made
by the committee.
Tryouts will be conducted for all
sections of (he country simultaneously
over the nation, on June 26. Pasadena,
for the Pacific Coast and the West!
Chicago for the middle-west, and Phila
delphia for the East, were selected as
the places for the elimination con
tests. While definite determination
has not been made for the Southern
preliminary tryouts, New Orleans is
thought to be favored by the national
committee. July 17 the final tryouts
to determine who will represent the
United States at Antwerp will be held
at Solders' Field, Cambridge, Mass.
Matthew P. Hilphin of the New
York Athletic Club has been appointed
manager of the team which will leave
New York for Antwerp, July 24. The
appointment of Halpliin was based on
his successful handling of the same
position for the American team in the
1912 Olympiad at Stockholm.
July 15, IG, and 17, the men's swim
ming trials will be conducted in Chi
cago. Norman Ross, ex-Stanford swim
mer, is certain to star in the contest
and is expected by his supporters to
be sent to Antwerp as the champion
American swimmer. A novel feature
of the swimming squad will be the
probable entry of a number of famous
Hawaiian aquatic experts, including
the Duke Kalutnamoku, Ludy Langer,
and Johnny Keoliole.
Tryouts for the women's swimming
squad will be held in New York City
on the same dates in July.
The national committee decided that
the winners of the amateur boxing
championship at Boston. April 5 and
fi. will don the gloves for the United
States at the Olympiad.
An estimate of $200,000 to finance
the American delegation to Antwerp
has been made by the A. A. U. The
sum is now being raised by popular
subscription throughout the country,
and the committee expects to shortly
announce that all necessary financial
arrangements have been completed.
