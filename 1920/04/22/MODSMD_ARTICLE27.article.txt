# UNIVERSITY UNION READY TO HANDLE AMERICAN VISITORS
## Organization Serves as a Bond Between Countries 
### 
The "American University Union in
Europe," of which Stanford is u mem
ber, has sent word from its London
office, 50 Russell Square, through its
director, George E. Mac Lean, that it
is now prepared to register American
university people upon their arrival
in London, afford a meeting place
where appointments may be made,
handle their mail, introduce them to
British universities, learned institu
tions, and in short to be of general
use as advisors about certain educa
tional matters.
The object for which the Union was
established is to serve as a bond be
tween the universities of the United
States and those of European nations,
especially by encouraging the attend
ance and advancing the welfare of
American students at the universities
of France, Great Britain and Italy. It
has offices in Paris, London, Rome,
and New York City.
Among other enterprises is the
formation of an international clear
ing house for university information
and advice. The London headquar
ters maintain close relations with the
American embassy and consulate and
itself has become, as it were, an edu
cational embassy and consulate.
