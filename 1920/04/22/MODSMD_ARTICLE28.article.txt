# PHARMACY COURSE BECOMES POPULAR AMONG WOMEN
## 
### 
Pharmacy as a field for women is
emphasized by Dean H. H. Rushy of
the College of Pharmacy of Columbia
University in his annual report.
With the increased popularity of
popularity of pharmacy as a profession
for women, there is a corresponding
increase in the number of women who
are studying to prepare themselves
to take up this work. Commenting
on the largely increased attendance of
women during the last year, the Dean
says that they have won their full
share of class honors.
The "prerequisite rule," making a
pharmacy course, based on high school
work, a precedent of admission to the
pharmacy board examination, has been
adopted in many states. Until recently
were few women in this field.
Pharmacists did not wish to employ
them. In the first place, it was con
sidered a novelty and there was the
usual hesitation to accept a novelty.
Now, according to Dean Rusby,
many women are making good in
pharmacy and some of those who
have taken advanced courses and be
coming analists are doing very good
work in chemical laboratories and for
manufacturing houses.
"The distinction between pharmacy
and medicine," said Dean Rusby, "is
that in medicine the patient is the
object of examination by the physician
and in pharmacy he is not. The phy
sician prescribes the medicine and the
pharmacist furnishes it. The pharma
cist is not supposed to know that there
is a patient. This college has been
keeping up its standard and all the
state colleges work together with us.
We have been careful not to advance
too rapidly to carry the great body
of pharmacists with us, and have en
deavored to increase the pharmacist's
conscience and to raise the education
al standard in this particular field.
