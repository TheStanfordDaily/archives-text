### 
WASHINGTON, April 22â€”A French
writer, Fred Romancet du Caillaudy,
has written and is distributing in the
United States, notably in schools and
colleges, a pamphlet showing that
most of the United States was dis
covered by the French explorer Ver
razzini, who was the first to land in
North Carolina, in 1524. He is ask
ing that in 1924, the four hundredth
anniversary of this discovery, a cele
bration be held, such as the celebra
tions commemorating the Louisiana
purchase, the Florida purchase, and
other national events.
Such a celebration, importers and
exporters say, would do much, especi
ally if held in the nature of an ex
position, toward advertising the re_
sources of this country, would invite
exhibits from this country abroad, and
would be of immense commercial
value in the way of advertising.
