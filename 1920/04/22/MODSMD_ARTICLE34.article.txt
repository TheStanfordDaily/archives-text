## 
### 
There has been received at the Uni
versity a post card from a student in
a technical high school at Graz,
Austria, reading as follows, in English
and German:
"The American Relief Admin
istration has established an Amer
ican Relief Warehouse in Vienna,
Austria. You can buy at any bank
in the United States American
Relief Warehouse Food Drafts and
send them to us in Vienna. On
presentation of these Food Drafts
at the warehouse in Vienna we
can draw American food.
"We are in great need of food
in Austria. Individual food par
cels sent from America usually
do not reach us. Money does us
no good when there is no food to
buy.
"HELP US IN OUR DISTRESS
BY SENDING AN AMERICAN
RELIEF WAREHOUSE FOOD
DRAFTâ€”QUICKLY!"
Such post cards are issued to the
students in Austria by the American
Relief Administration in order that
they individually may bring their
needs to the attention of Americans
and point out the method by which
relief may most effectively be extend
ed to them.
