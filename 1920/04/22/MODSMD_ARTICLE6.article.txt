## 
### 
Euphronia won a unanimous deci
sion in their debate held last evening
against the Congress, a debating so
ciety of the University of California.
Euphronia argued the negative of the
question whether or not the university
teachers should organize and affiliate
with the American Federation of
Labor. The debate was held in the
Law Building.
The Euphronia speakers last even
ing were H. A. Fendler, '22; C. G.
Smith, '22; and E. H. Landel, '21.
California's affirmative team was com
posed of J. G. Benson, '22; R. T.
Jumper, '23; and A. E. Murphy, '23.
Professor Wildman, of the Economics
department; Professor Kirlcwood, of
the Law department, and Professor
Bassett of the English department
judged the contest.
The California speakers based their
arguments on the contention that the
university teachers today are very
poorly paid as professional men. and
that the only means by which they
may better their economic standing is
to organize and affiliate with the
American Federation of Labor. They
showed that while the average wage
of an ordinary laborer connected with
a union is over $2300 a year, the aver
age university professor only receives
a yearly remuneration of $ISOO. Great
er academic freedom of opinion and
tenure of office would be secured by
such an affiliation, they said.
Landel of Stanford proved to be
the best speaker of the evening show
ing clearly that to organize with the
American Federation of Labor would
discredit the teachers' cause and
would operate to the disadvantage of
the American universities. Murphy
was the mainstay of the California ag
gregation.
