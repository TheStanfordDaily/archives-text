## Women Will Put on Annual Event; Representative of Own Talent 
### 
Plans for a new activitv to be origi
nated and executed solely by the wom
en of the University ivere discussed at
the assembly of the oragnized women
held yesterday afternoon in the Little
Theatre. The exact nature of the ac
tivity lias not yet been determined, but
it will probably be an annual dramatic
event of some kind, a masque or a
pageant slightly similar to the Parthenia
at the University of California or the
Kirmis at Mills College
The performance will be written and
managed bv the women alone. For some
time the need has been felt for an ac
tivity representative of what the women
can independently accomplish. Stanford

women do not put on some sort of a
performance during the year without the
aid of the men. Such an activitv will
call out the great number of women
who are not now interested in any wom
en's activity.
Suggestions for such an event are
earnestly solicited, and mav be given to
;inv member of the Women's Council, or
to Marjorie Bryant, Secretary of the
Conference.

sented to the Assembly.

of the program. A short business meet
ing was held to select the member of
