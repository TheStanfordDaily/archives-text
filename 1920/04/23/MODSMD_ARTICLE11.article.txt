# Hoover Club Has Work For "Frosh" Volunteers
## 
### 
Freshmen who volunteered for work
in the Hoover campaign will have their
first chance to do active work in the
drive which is now in full swing among
University alumni and the people of
Santa Clara county. Hoover headquar
ters are anxious to have every freshman
who signed up to report as soon as pos
sible, as their services are urgently
needed.
