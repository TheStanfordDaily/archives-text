# FACULTY CONSIDERS INSTRUCTION CHANGE
## PLAN ABOLISHES MAJOR SYSTEM FOR FIRST TWO YEARS May Call Underclass Years of University Work "Lower Division" 
### 
Thoroughgoing changes in the pres
ent plan of undergraduate instruction
at Stanford University were proposed
in a report submitted by a committee
appointed by the Advisory Board to
the Academic Council, meeting at 4:15
today. The outstanding features of
these recommendations are the aboli
tion of the major subject system dur
ing the freshnan and sophomore
years, its continuance during the
junior and senior years, and the im
position of certain requirements upon
underclass students, some of which
must be met in high schools, and
others in the first two years of work
here.
Agitation upon this subject was
started in 1917, and after some cor
respondence between the President
and the Advisory Board, a committee
was appointed in June, 1919, and this
report is the result of their considera
tion of the subject, lasting nearly a
year. The formation of such a scheme
has been practically made necessary
by the growth of the Junior College
system elsewhere, the need to meet
the requiremnt of advanced students
from these Junior Colleges and other
institutions, and the trend towards
elective studies in high schools, which
has sent many students to college with
their minds still uncertain as to what
they wish to make their major sub
ject, and insufficiently prepared in
many respects to take up the major
work. This plan is proposed by the
committee in the hope of providing
a college education for students who
desire to follow no particular roca
i, and to provide a liberal educa
tion as a founuation for specialized
students.
In no way, though, it is planned to
interfere with any student who has
already settled upon his major sub
ject when he enters college, as he will
be referred to this major department
for advice, and exclusive of the total
.'56 or 58 units of required work dur
ing the first two years, his other 32
or 54 units may be elected from the
major department courses. These 32
units, in any event, leaves every stu
dent plenty of opportunity for elect
ives.
Exceptions to these rules, will be
made in the case of the Applied Sci
ence Department, such as Engineer
ing, where students will register as
majors in these departments in their
freshman year, though such students
will be required to fill the specific re
quirements, demanded of all students.
The administration of this program
will be in the hands of a special facul
ty committee, whose duties will bo to
handle matters of application rules
and exceptions, to advise students,
sign study cards, arrange courses for
students and insure that a sufficient
number of elective courses are offered
for freshmen.
Such are the recommendations
which were offered for consideration
tliis afternoon to the Advisory Coun
cil. If the Advisory Council passes
upon them, and the Board of Trustees
also passes them, the plan will be put
into operation as soon as possible,
piobably at the opening of the autumn
quarter next year. It is understood
tHat tnose already enrolled here will
not be subject to these requirements.
The name suggested for the first two
>oors of work is the "Lower Division."
Following are the requirements as
listed in the report:
1. Mathematics —To be taken in
high school; elementary algebra and
plane geometry, one high school unit
in each.
2. English—To be required for ad
mission to the University; (1) Eng
lish composition as at present; (2) the
two high school units of English pre
scribed by the California State Board
of Education. To be taken during the
second year in the University; six
units of English composition.
3. Foreign Languages—To be taken
either in high school or in the Uni
versity or in both together; 2 units (3
high school units) in one foreign lan
guage or 15 units (2 high school units)
in each of two foreign languages.
4. Natural Sciences —General Biol
ogy. Nine units in the University or
one unit in high school.
2. Physics or Chemistry — Nine
units in the University or one unit in
the high school.
3. Of the required two courses in
natural science indicated above one
must be taken in the University and
one may be taken in the high school.
In lieu of the couse which may be
taken in the high school, one high
school unit in general science may be
offered.
