# REORGANIZATION OF UNDERGRADUATE INSTRUCTION
## 
### 
rpHE reorganization of undergraduate instruction as announced in the Daily
Palo Alto tonight is neither as sweeping a change as it might appear on
first reading nor as conservative a measure as might appear when the reader
starts to discount the radical element. The radical element comes in that
fact that the University is partially doing away with a system which has
been a distinctive part of Stanford and a direct contribution of David Starr
Jordan, who originally drew up the major subject system and installed it at
Stanford. On the other hand, such a system as is proposed is now in practice
at the larger number of state institutions and is nothing particularly new in
educational work.
The new system proposes to better conditions for the underclassmen
and it will undoubtedly accomplish its purpose. The significant point which
enters the student mind is whether or not this system aims to do away with
interclass instruction entirely in the University. The report to the Academic
Council makes this point clear. For the present, at least, no such intention
is held by the University, in looking into the future, however, one cannot
overlook the fact that the machinery is ready if the first two years of college
work should be eliminated. With the steady increase of upperclass students
the cost of university instruction is increasing proportionately. The time
will undoubtedly come when endowment will be necessary to retain the under
class years. At that time the proposed system will be tested.
In the meantime, the University has taken a progressive step toward
solving many of the difficulties which freshmen in particular are forced to
work under. All the advantages of the major subject system are retained and
the disadvantages eliminated. The underclassman is given the chance to make
up his mind as to his specialized work, the same system which now is em
ployed in the Law School. Even taking into consideration its dangers, the
new system will work for the benefit of the coming generation.
