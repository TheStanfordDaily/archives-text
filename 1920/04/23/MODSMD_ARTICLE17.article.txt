# THE 						OPENING OF THE DARDANELLS
## 
### 
TiHE opening of the Dardanelles without the co-operation of the United
States is particularly significant in its relation to the present policy of
the United States in foreign affairs. Our aloofness will undoubtedly be pleas
ing to many people in this country who have watched with anxiety the ent
rance of this country into active participation in European tangles. On the
other hand our aloofness will probably be objected to by many who hope
that the policy of isolation has come to an end.
The Dardanelles have always served as one of the famous and much
fought for strategic points of the continent. Strategically, it has interest for
European powers only and in no way concerns the United States. In spite
of the fact that Millerand expressed a sincere regret that the United States
refrained from entering into the Turkish treaty. Washington evidently takes
the attitude that France, Italy, England, Germany and the Balkans, should
be encouraged to take care of themselves. It seems as though the United
States is about to strike a happy medium in its foreign policy which will be
welcomed by a larger percentage of the thinking public.
