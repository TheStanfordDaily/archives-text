# MOONLIGHT PAINTINGS WILL BE SHOWN HERE
## 
### 
An exhibition of moonlight paintings
by Charles Rollo Peters will be on view
at the Thomas -Welton Stanford Art
Gallery tomorrow at 10 a. m. Pedro J.
Lemos, director of the gallery announced
today. The paintings were expected to
day, and Mr. and Mrs. Peters person
ally will supervise their hanging. They
will he the guests of Mr. and Mrs. Le
mos during their visit to the campus.
The exhibition will last from Saturday.
April 24, to May 4.
Tn the opinion of Mr. Peters there is
no better art gallery this side of Chi
cago than that at Stanford. Tt is the
best suited for lighting and backgrounds.
It is, moreover, typically Californian
in setting, and it is for these reasons
that Air. Peters has chosen Stanford in
stead of San Francisco for his farewell
exhibition.
