This program of concessions will be
augmented by the free entertainment
which in itself promises to be a show
well worth seeing.
One of the big attractions of the
open-air show will be the straight
jacket escape by Lionel Jacoby, '20.
The straight jacket will be furnished
by Chief Noble of the Palo Alto police
department. Chief Noble has agreed
to put Jaloby in the straight jacket so
that he cannot make an escape, but
Jacoby says Noble cannot do it. Jacoby
will make the escape in the open and
not tied in a sack as first intended.
The Carnival Committee has offered a
prize in money to anyone who can dup
licate Jacoby's feat.
Other numbers on the free program
will be the singing of the official song,
"Carnival," by Howard Deems, '21;
boxing exhibitions; singing by the
Glee Club quartet; the Ram's Head
Revue; and the presentation of the
cup to the best concession by the King
and Queen.
The Carnival Committee has been
working overtime during the week on
the arrangements for this evening's
entertainment. It has had the hearty
co-operation of all the organizations
participating and feels, in the words
of Chairman E. R. Martin, '18, that

"tonight's show will be the biggest
thing Stanford has ever seen."
The purpose of the Carnival is to
raise funds for the Student Body and
primarily for athletes. It is expected
when the receipts are counted that,
the athletic fund will liav been swelled
by several hundred dollars.

promptly at 7 o'clock!
