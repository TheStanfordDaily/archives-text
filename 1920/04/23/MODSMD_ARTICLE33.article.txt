# Program of Contrasts Is Given by Organist
## 
### 
I lie first oi the 1 hursday afternoon
organ recitals, resumed yesterday by Or
ganist Warren D. Allen, was a program
of contrasts. 'I hree compositions, by
modern and classic composers were
played. Henry Purccll's "Trumpet
J line and Air ' was a gay and lively mel
ody of great beauty. The "Carillon."
by Leo Sowcrby, is a new composition,
just published, by an American com
poser. It lias an appealing, tender qual
ity, which rises to a climax and then re
turns to the gentle first theme. The
use of the chords and the effect of the
chimes and harp stops is modern and
strikingly original. The last number,
the Scherzo and Finale from Widor's
Fourth Symphony, is in the perfect style
of the master, the Scherzo being light
and swift, with a broken rythm, and the
Finale a triumphal chorus.
The program will be repeated Sunday,
and Mr. Allen will be assisted bv Mother
Wismer, violinist of the San Francisco
Symphony Orchestra. He will play the
following numbers:
"Sonata in B minor" Bach
"Allegretto" from the Sonata, op.
F)5 Schumann
Following his plan of playing one of
Widor's Symphonies the first Sunday
in each month, Mr. Allen will give the
Fifth Symphony Sunday, May 2.
