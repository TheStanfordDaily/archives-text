# Three New Collections Purchased For Museum
## 
### 
The purchase of three new collections
for the Stanford Museum have been ap
proved by the President, and arrange
ments are now being made for their
placing. The collections will consist
of materials from the Philippine Islands,
examples of pottery and carving by the
Indians of Costa Rica, and the arrows
and blow-guns of the South American
Indians. The guns are used by the
head hunters in the interior of the con
tinent to shoot poisoned arrows. The
collection is a rare one, having been
made by a mining engineer who pene
trated the wilderness where few white
men have been.
