# VARSITY NINE PLAYS SANTA CLARA TEAM
## Team is on Edge For Coming Contest; Fast Game is Expected 
### 
Varsity baseball fans will see a re
juvenated baseball team when Coach
Evans' diamond warriors are trotted out
against Santa Clara tomorrow after
noon. The team has been practicing
daily for the last two weeks and there
is a decided improvement both in team
play and in individual work. The var
sity has shown up well in several prac
tice games played with Palo Alto high
school and they expect to clean up on
the boys from the Mission College.
However, in meeting Santa Clara they
are going up against much stronger play
than they have been experiencing during
the past fortnight and a battle royal is
to be expected. "Lefty" Berge will
work on the slab for Santa Clara. His
latest achievement is a win over the
Olympic Club team, the team which set
the varsity down earlier in the season.
Coach Evans will select a pitcher to
oppose Berg from Draper, Newlands,
Briggs, and Pelouze. These men all
throw from the starboard but any one
of them is capable of pitching high-class
baseball.
The line-up of the varsity remains the
same with the exception of right field,
where "Mel" Parker will hold forth in
place of Kline. Kline has been forced
to give up baseball for the balance of
the season on account of his duties as
Quad manager.
The game will be called promptly at
2:30. An admission of twenty-five cents
will be charged. Holders of student
body cards will be admitted free.
