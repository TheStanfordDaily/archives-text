# Advertising Manager Speaks on Copy Writing
## 
### 
John J. Cuddy, Pacific Coast represen
tative of the H. K. McCann Company,
delivered an interesting talk, entitled
"Advertising Copy," to the class in ad
vertising this morning.
"Advertising copy," said the speaker,
"is of two kinds: 'reason why' copy and
human interest copy." From a supply
of illustrations which he brought with
him Mr. Cuddy gave a graphic analysis
of these facts.
He also spoke on the modern adver
tisement as a means to stabilize the
product and discussed the value of ana
lyzing the good and faulty effects of the
competitions' product- as a means for
mure effective presentation.
