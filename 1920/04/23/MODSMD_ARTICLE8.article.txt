Carnival Night—the night of nights
—is here.
The Third Annual Student Body
Spring Carnival is ready. Every de
tail has been completed; every one
of the thirty concessions has been per
fected. Nothing has been left undone
to make the gala event a grand suc
cess.
Promptly at 7 p.m., Edward Hender
son and Melba Berry will ascend the
throne-stand at Encina Gymnasium to
night to be crowned King Hilarity and
Queen Merriment and to start their
reign over a throng of merrymakers
and a night of gayety and joy.
Bands will blare; light will glisten;
barkers will shout their wares, as the
King and Queen declare the Carnival
formally opened. The festive spirit
will predominate. Carefreeness that
marks a vacation will bo given free
reign.
Cafes, freaks, gypsy camps, vaude
ville, diving girls, fashion shows —
these are just a few of the things
that the program of entertainment for
the evening contains. The number of
amusements is of such extent that
room was hardly found to house them
all. There will be fun of all kinds,
and plenty of it.
Thme main entrance gate will be di
rectly into the enclosure back of the
gymnasium through the fence opposite
the university heating plant. The gate
will be thrown upon to the crowds
at G:3O.
The first number on the program
will be the coronation of the King and
Queen. The key to the campus and

the spectre denoting the ruling power
will be turned over to the royal pair
by President F. L. King of the Stan
ford student body.
Immediately following the corona
tion ceremony, the concessions will
open. At thirty-minute intervals dur
ing the evening there will be free en
tertainment on the main stand in the
center cf the Carnival grounds.
Later in the evening the dance hall
will be opened and the crowd will be
given one more form of amusement.
The dance hall has been cleverly de
corated with posters by some of the
best artists on the campus.
Tickets which will admit the holder
to any concession will be sold by ticket
sellers at ten cents each.
Hammer and Coffin Society is al
ready to carry the crowds from the
Row and the dormitories to the gym
nasium in its rubber-neck wagon.
Special street cars will be run by
the Peninsula Railroad Company from
Palo Alto to bring the crowds out to
the campus from down town.
All the living groups on the campus
have agreed to move the- dinner hour
ahead to 5:30 tonight in order that
everyone may be at the Gymnasium
for the coronation ceremony at 7
o'clock.
The Carnival Committee has urged
that there be little queening tonight
in order that those men who "stag"
to the Carnival will have someone to
dance with.
