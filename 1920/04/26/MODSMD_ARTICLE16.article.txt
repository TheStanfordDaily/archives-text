# ACADEMIC COUNCIL RAISES NECESSARY ADMITTANCE UNITS
## Two Years of Army Service Removes Gymnasium Requirements 
### 
Revision of the regulations governing
the admission of men to the University,
and those governing conditions and
failures, and the modification of the
physical and military training require
ments, recommended by the Executive
Committee of the Academic Council,
were accepted by the Council at its meet
ing last Friday. Recommendations of
the Chemistry Department changing the
requirements for the Chemical Engineer
degree, and the proposal of the presi
dent, giving academic rank to members
of the Library staff, and instructors in
the Training School for Nurses were
also accepted.
All men desiring admission to the
University with less than the required
15 units of recommending grade from
an approved preparatory school, will
hereafter be required to present at least
12 units of this grade among the 15 of
fered. Heretofore such students might
he allowed to enter if they presented as
many as 9 units of recommending grade
among the total of 15. The University
now admits students to first-year stand
ing, and those with less than a year and
a half advanced credit only up to the
number of 450 for the autumn quarter,
and 50 for each of the following quar
ters. Of the candidate applying for ad
mission with such underclass standing,
preference is given to candidates who
present all 15 units of recommending
grade, and the remaining vacancies are
tilled by those who have only a portion
of their 15 units of recommending
standard. The purpose of the now regu
lation is to reduce the number of can
didates in this latter class, since the
number of vacancies open to these ap
plicants is each year growing smaller.
The Council determined that hereafter
service in the Army or Navy will be ac
cepted toward fulfilling the requirement
in Physical or Military Training; two
years in the service covering the entire
requirement; lesser time a proportional
part of the requirement. Hereafter the
physical or military training work re
quired of every student will be given a
credit value of one unit a quarter. These
units will not be taken into account for
grade points or graduation, the purpose
being only to make perfectly obvious
that the training is required.
Hereafter a student conditioned or re
ported incomplete in a study may make
up either the conditions or the incom
plete within one year after it is incurred;
after this period it will be considered a
failure. Hitherto, while a student had
a year to make up a condition, he was
required to remove an incomplete in two
quarters.
On recommendation of the Chemistry
Department, the faculty voted to award
the degree of Chemical Engineer only
after the completion of two years of
graduate study, thus making the degree
of Chemical Engineer like) that of Min
ing Engineer, dependent on the comple
tion of a six-year's course. This re
quirement was desired by the Chemistry
Department because of the realization
that a large amount of the work re
quired for purely professional training
in the subject was in danger of crowd
ing out the broad * education which is
desired. The position of Chemical En
gineer is coming to be largely executive
and managerial in its duties, and the
Chemistry Department feels that men
who hold such position should have a
foundation of knowledge of economics
and other subjects of a liberal education.
The Council voted that the regular
salaried instructors in the Training
School for Nurses, which is conducted
by the Medical Department be placed on
the academic staff of the University.
The library staff will also be given flas
sification in the Academic staff where
such standing as their salaries justify.
This action places the members of the
I library staff in the same grade with
members of the teaching staff instead of
being in a separate division as hereto
fore.
The proposals of the committee ap
pointed to consider changes in the pres
ent plan of undergraduate instruction
were discussed, but definite action was
postponed till the next meeting of the
Council, scheduled for next Friday. A
discussion of the proposal caused the
Council to eliminate the mathematical
requirements proposed. The full pro
posal was published in the Daily Palo
Alto issue of April 23.
