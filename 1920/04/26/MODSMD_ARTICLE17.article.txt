# WOMEN TO SIGN FOR TENNIS TOURNAMENT
## 
### 
Practice for the women's spring tennis
tournament will begin this week. Sheets
will be placed in Roble gymnasium
where women intending to come out for
the tournament should sign.
Frances Fish, '22, tennis manager, is
anxious to have a large number of wom
en sign up as it is probable that Stan
ford will compete with the University
of Southern California women tennis
team later in the season and the results
of the spring tournament will largely
determine the players to be selected for
the inter-college games.
