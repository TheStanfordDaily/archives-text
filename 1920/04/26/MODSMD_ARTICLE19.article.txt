# THE
						ARMENIAN MANDATE
## 
### 
IN view of the refusal of the United States to take any part in the Turkish
Treaty concerning the Dardanelles, the offer of the Armenian mandatory
to the United States is particularly interesting. The mandatory, it is thought
holds little advantage as far as we are concerned and if this country accepted
the offer it would largely be on account of humanitarian motives.
Discounting the humanitarian motives, however, it must be acknowledged
that the United States has no more business in Armenia than she has in the
Dardanelles. As yet Washington has made no comment on the situation. The
offer came on account of the allied powers being unable to settle the Ar
menian boundaries to the satisfaction of President Wilson. It is largely on
account of the interest of the President in the Armenian situation that the
mandatory was offered.
Developments in this situation will be interesting us a test of the stand
already taken by Washington. If the United States is to definitely keep
clear from Southern Europe as the Dardanelles situation would indicate, the
mandatory will be refused and the United States will probably act in an
arbitrary capacity in determining the boundaries of Armenia. It would seem
that this would rather be the wiser course. It is true that our interests have
broadened but we have not changed in that our primary interests still lie in
western hemisphere. In order to fill the obligations which may arise in this
part of the world, the United States can not undertake too many obligations
which justly belong to the European powers.
