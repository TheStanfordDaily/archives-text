## 
### 
May 7 is the date set for the Junior
Prom, according to an announcement
made by members of the committee in
charge of the affair today. With but
ten days in which to prepare for the
event the students directing the decora
tion are doing a rushing business.
Under the supervision of Walter
Gores, ex-'lB, an elaborate scheme of
decoration of Arabian atmosphere lias
been worked out. Ornamentation of
the barren rafters of Encina Gym
nasium, which in the past has been a
knotty problem, has been placed in the
hands of a competent committee, who
plan to show the Stanford campus some
thing startlingly new and unique in th<\
way of decoration.
The Olympic, one of the best nine
piece orchestras in the state, has agreed
to furnish the music for the occasion.
It has been announced that the fifth and
thirteenth dances will be waltzes and
that the supper dance will be between
the ninth and tenth dances. Arrange
ments are being made by members of
the decorating committee to put the
gymnasium floor in better shape for the
coming event.
Owing to the inadequate floor space
it has been found necessary to limit the
sale of tickets to 170. No preference
is to be shown to classes. The cards
have been placed on sale at the Encina
store, at CrandaU's in Palo Alto, and at
the Stanford Bookstore.
