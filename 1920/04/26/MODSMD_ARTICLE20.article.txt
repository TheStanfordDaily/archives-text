# VOTE FOR YOUR PRESIDENTIAL CHOICE TOMORROW
## 
### 
fTHE vote for Quad elections has for the most part always been light in com
parison to the number of students registered in the University. It is
to be hoped that this will not be repeated in the straw ballot which will be
taken tomorrow from S a.m. to 4 p.m. at polls located at the Post Office.
Engineering corner, English corner, Encina and Roble. The Daily Palo Alto
hopes that every student will feel the responsibility to vote on account of
the statistics which will be used later in the State at large.
The ballot is a fair one and gives the Johnson adherents an advantage
which they will not have in the coming California primaries. All of the
presidential candidates are listed instead of just Hoover and Johnson so that
the Hoover Club will not have the advantage of the crystallization of senti
ment against Johnson. In other words many people feel strongly against
Johnson and would vote for any candidate running against him which in
California would be Hoover. It is to be hoped that as many students of the
campus as possible will vote as they would in the primary election, May 4, so
that the vote will be more nearly representative of California rather than the
nation at large. The statistics resulting will be used as California results
and not national and every voter should keep this fact in mind.

THE women are now scheduled for a new activity to be some such pro
duction as that of the Parthenia at the University of California. Experience
at the neighboring institution would show that they had better get the men's
viewpoint and save themselves the trouble of putting up a defense against
a male attack.

ENGLISH CLUB will have competition in the future as a high-brow or
ganization. The Renaissance Club has closed its membership and now con
siders itself essentially "classical" as opposed to the more "modern" organi
zation, English Club.

STANFORD will soon be in the swim. In the "Cornell Sun" we notice
the following item: "For Sale —Old established fraternity house in center
of fraternity section. Houses 22 men." It promises to be an old story
here on the Farm.

IN a recent lecture in advertising it was stated that women buy perfume
on emotion and not by intelligent conclusion. The conclusion (six dollars
an ounce) is all too intelligible and it takes emotion to get the cash across the
counter.

IT might be well if a few of the women would doff their silks and don
their denims to lower the High Cost of Living.
