Net receipts amounting to between
$1000 and $1501* will be paid over to
the student body as the profit from the
'1 hird Annual Student Body Spring
Carnival given last Friday at
Encina Gymnasium, according to the
present figures of the Carnival Com
mittee. The first report shows that
a gross total of $2400 was taken in
from all sources. The expenses will
run up to about $1000.
Definite figures are not yet ascertain
able,as some money is yet to be paid
in, and the exact amount of the ex
penses is not known.
The Carnival itself brought about
$2075. The King and Queen contest
netted $24U. it is expected that about
$30 will be made from the Carnival
airplane and the programs cleared
approximately $75.
The goal that was set was $1000
clear for the student body, so it may
be seen that financially the Carnival
was a decided success.
It is declared on all sides that the
Carnival was a success in every way,
and the event is assured as a perma
nent annual occurrence. Every ef
fort was made to give a high claos
show as well as to make a good pro
fit for the student body and it may be
said without qualification that this
program was carried out.
It would be too extensive to com
ment on all the details of the Carni
val, but it can be said that every de
tail was practically perfect.
The concessions all were good and
pome were excellent. The various
organizations on the campus partici
pating co-operated heartily with the
Carnival Committee to make the affair
successful and this end undoubtedly
was attained.
r l he Carnival Committee is prepar
ing a complete report. This report
will contain a survey of the work of
the committee and also a group of sug
gestions for future carnival commit
tees.
It was a happy throng that filled
Encina Gymnasium and the yard in
the rear Friday night. Everyone was
there for a good time and everyone
had a good time. From the corona
tion ceremony until the last dance at
1 o'clock the time was given over to
merry-making and King Hilarity and
Queen Merriment truly reigned su
preme.
The cup for the best contribution to
the program went to Ram's Head So
ciety lor its Junior Opera Tabloid.
The presentation was made by Edward
Henderson as King Hilarity. Melba
Berry as Queen Merriment made a
charming "first lady of the land." The
court attendants were Mary Tuthill,
Adelaide Graves, F. A. Betts, and W.
O. I us&ell.
Practically all the construction work
at Encina has been torn down and
cleaned up. What little remains will
j be a thing of the past in a few days.
