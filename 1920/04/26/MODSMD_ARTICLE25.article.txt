# RUGBY UNION LAUNCHES CAMPAIGN FOR $30,000
## Governor W.D. Stephens to Endorse Project in the Behalf of State 
### 
An kirplane race for Sacramcnto, to
secure Governor W. D. Stephen's en
dorsement in behalf of the state of Cali
fornia. was the opening step taken by
the California Rugby Union, last Satur
day, in its drive for $30,000, to be used
in sending an all-California rugby fif
teen to the Olympic games at Antwerp,
Belgium, this summer.
The flight was undertaken as a result
of a belated telegram from the state
capitol to R. A. Martinsen, '21, appointed
by the Union to take charge of the cam
paign, franting him an interview with
the chief executive on Saturday morn
ing. Ihe message was delivered too late
to insure his arrival in Sacramento by
train in time for the appointment. The
Union at once secured the services of
Oliver Wheeler, '20, flying for H. N.
Todd. Martinsen and Wheeler left the
campus at noon Saturday, determined to
make Sacramento by two o'clock.
At Lodi, thirty miles from the capi
tol, a leak in the plane's water system
necessitated a forced landing.
Both men escaped unhurt, and con
tinued the race by automobile, as soon
as a car could lie procured to take them.
Ihe arrival at Sacramento was made
at four o'clock, too late for the inter
view. An appointment was arranged at
once for Sunday morning. At that time
Maj or Warren I'ovard, confidential sec
retary of Governor Stephens, after a
short interview, gave Martinsen hearty
endorsement of the Union's project, on
behalf of the state. Governor Stephen's
full support and cooperation, in view
of services to be rendered California by
the trip, is en route from the capitol to
the Union officials, in the form of a
personal communication from the ex
ecutive himself. It has also been ru
mored by Union officials that a more
material sign of the governor's appre
ciation in the form of $5,000 as the first
subscription for the fund, accompanies
his endorsement.
The second step in the campaign will
take place next Monday, when drives
will be inaugurated simultaneously on
the campus of each university having
representatives on the team. Stanford,
Santa Clara, the University of Califor
nia, Davis Farm, and the Olympic Club
are among the number. Quotas will be
arranged during the week ,and all details
worked out to insure the success of the
drives. The entire sum must be raised
within three weeks.
