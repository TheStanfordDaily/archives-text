# LEADERS DEVELOPING IN CAMPUS BASEBALL
## Phi Delts Pound Phi K Nine For 24 to 1 Smashing Fast Ball Played 
### 
Last week saw the intergroup baseball
series well started after the delay due
to the rain. All the leagues have played
once around in their schedule and are
now beginning to show the leaders in
the respective groups.
The .Phi Delta Theta stickers threw
a heavy drubbing into the Phi Kappa
Sigma nine Friday. The Phi Deltas
could not seem to miss the deliveries
of the opposing pitcher, and slammed
the sphere into the fence for run after
run. When they finally tired after chas
ing around the bases in a regular mara
thon, the score stood 24 to 1, in favor
of the Phi Deltas.
Encina second floor put up a good ex
hibition of ball against the Theta Xi
team, but was unable to overcome a
lead that the latter nine took in the first
of the game. They played with spirit all
the game, but came out at the end n
10-to-8 score.
Today there are four games on the
local diamonds between the group nines.
Beta Theta Pi meets Delta Chi, and
D. U. tangles with the Alpha Delta slug
gers. A. T. O. vs. Phi Delta Theta,
and S. A. E. vs. Japanese Club complete
the program for the day.
Beta and Delta Chi are both unbeaten
nines and have great confidence in their
respective clubs. The Beta nine are
in possession of a remarkable pitcher
and the Delta Cliis are perhaps better in
the outfield. D. U. and Alpha Delta are
both strong in teamwork and promise
to put up a good brand of ball.
Games for tomorro\y are: Sequoia
third vs. Phi G., Unattached vs. El
Camino, Phi Psi vs. El Campo, and
Theta Xi vs. Phi Kappa Sigma.
