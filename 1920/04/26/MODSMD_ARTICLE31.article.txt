# Dr. J.C. Branner Will Give Dialect Stories
## 
### 
Negro dialect stories by Dr. J. C.
Branner, President Emeritus, will be a
feature of the Tuesday evening enter
tainment this week at the community
house in Palo Alto. Dr. Branner's gift
for reproducing the charm of the darky
story has made him a popular entertainer
at informal gatherings. Another part of
the program will be Hawaiian music
furnished by the natives of the islands
who are now at the government hos
pital. One of the numbers will be a
steel guitar solo.
