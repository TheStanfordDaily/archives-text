# HOOVER-JOHNSON FIGHT COMES HERE TOMORROW
## 
### 
Polls will be opened tomorrow morning at 8 o'clock for the presidential
candidates' straw ballot conducted under the auspices of The Daily Palo
Alto. The Hoover Club, the Johnson-Republican Club, and the Democratic
Club will co-operate in supervision of the polls to be placed at the post office,
Engineering corner, English corner, and Encina and Roble. The polls at the
two dormitories will be open from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m., and the other three
three will take votes until 4 p.m.
Every rnari and woman on the campus will vote either the democratic or
the republican ticket and will be asked to state their preference. The
democratic delegates from California will go to the national convention un
instructed so that the contest in the California primaries lies between the
two republican candidates, Hoover and Johnson,

Many men and women on the cam
pus are from other states than Cali
fornia and for their benefit perticularly
the ballot lists all of the candidates
for the presidential nomination. All
votes cast for candidates other than
Hoover or Johnson will have no value
as indicating California's position in
the primaries but in case any student
feels that he cannot vote for either
Hoover or Johnson the opportunity is
given him to place his vote for a
presidential candidate running outside
of the State of California.
The ballot tomorrow promises to be
closer than many of the political lead
ers of the campus thought a short
time ago. Both organizations have

been working to arouse interest in the
ballot. Letters have been sent out
by both Hoover and Johnson Republi
can Clubs urging members of both or
ganizations to vote. Just what the
outcome will be is difficult to de
termine as it is thought that the John
son men are stronger than outside
indications would seem to point out.
The Stanford community is conceded
to be a Hoover stronghold but the
active work of both organizations is
thought to bo influential in evening-up
the votes.
Votes will be brought to the office
of the Daily Palo Alto tomorrow aft
ernoon where J liey will be counted.
The result of the election will be an
nounced Wednesday.
