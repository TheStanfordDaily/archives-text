# SPRING MILITARY CARNIVAL WILL BE HELD ON MAY 22
## Infantry and Artillery to Offer Unique Events in Exhibition 
### 
May 22 is the date set for the spring
Military Carnival, Captain Collins, com
mandant of the local Field Artillery
Unit, announced this morning. The
plans of the Stanford military instruc
tors are definitely formulated, providing
for the staging of the most complete ex
hibition of military methods and tech
nique that has been attempted this year
by any western university.
The carnival will be a unique adver
tisement of Stanford, as the Hearst
Movie Weekly of Current Events has
arranged for the filming of the exhi
bition for distribution over the nation-
Stanford was selected by the Hearst
Movie Weekly director because her ar
tillery unit possesses the most modern
equipment of any college R. O. T. C. unit
in the West.
The exhibition will not be subject to
the whims of the camera men, asserts
Captain Collins, but is designed primari
ly for the carnival crowd interested in
inspecting the work of the local military
companies. Not only will a complete
exhibition of the purely military aspects
of the R. O. T. C. units be made, but
many spectacular events will be featured
throughout the day's program. Two polo
matches, wrestling, horse races and tugs
<if war are included on the schedule.
A bucking horse which was brought
to Stanford several months ago with a
record of having never been successfully
ridden, will star in a riding contest. A
number of Stanford men will attempt to
tame "Wild Bill" for the amusement of
those interested in expert horsemanship.
"Dink" Templeton, it is rumored, will
exert his educated toe to prove that the
broncho can be ridden.
A unique wrestling match is scheduled
that is certain to form the center of a
crowd. Two teams of four men each,
mounted ot) ponies, will be pitted against
each other in an effort to dismount the
opposing riders. The first aid attendant
will be ready for any emergency.
Following is the announced program
of the infantry unit: Squad competition,
close and extended order ; physical drill,
platoon drill, close and extended order;
bayonet drill; platoon games; platoon in
attack; wall scaling on the basis of
squad competition; obstacle race; in

the harnessing of horses, advancing and
fire delivery; wall scaling; mounted
