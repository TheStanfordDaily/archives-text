# Hanner Throws Javelin 187 Feet in Practice
## 
### 
In a practice heave, Flint Hanner,
'21, varsity field man, threw the jave
lin 187 feet yesterday afternoon, sur
passing the national A. A. U. record
by two feet. Hanner, who won against
California's super-man, Johnny Mer
chant, in the California-Stanford meet,
has been showing improved form in
his event and because of his recent
performances will probably be a mem
ber of the Stanford team that is to
go to Princeton to compete in the I.
C. A. A. A. A. meet. His throw is
of championship distance and if re
pented in the Pacific Coast Conference
will undoubtedly earn him a place on
the American team to compete at the
Olympic Games.
