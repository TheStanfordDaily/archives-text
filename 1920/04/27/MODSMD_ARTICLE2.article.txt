# FRENCH CLUB WILL STAGE TWO PLAYS THURSDAY, APRIL 28
## 
### 
An appeal to Stanford generosity,
in aiding the "Fatherless children of
France," has come to us through let
ters, recently received by the French
Club, from their two adopted orphans.
Since 1917, the club has been their
means of support, and a benefit is
given yearly for them. This year,
owing to the strong appeal, the bene
fit will be one a large scale than ever
before.
On the evening of April 28, in the
Little Theater, two French plays, a
comedy and a romance, will be staged
by the members of the club. Gordon
Davis, '18. has been doing the coach
ing, and has remarked that the cast
is one in which each participant is
particularly suited to his part. George
Nivon, a member of the French Engi
neers, and a special student here,
shows unlimited talent in his character
part, according to Davis. The cast
also includes Dorothy Elfving, '21,
Elizabeth McArthur, '21, and Winifred
Johnston, '21, who besides speaking
the French language fluently, are not
lacking in experience, as all have been
active in dramatics in college.
The price of admission 75 cents, and
there are a few tickets left. All those
desiring to co-operate with the French
Club to help their orphans are urged
to purchase the tickets immediately.
They may be obtained either from in
dividual members of the club, or from
the Romanic Language Department.
