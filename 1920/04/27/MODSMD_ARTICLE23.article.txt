# MISINFORMATION AND FALSE IMPRESSIONS
## 
### 
PALSE impressions concerning the proposed plan of reorganization of the
undergraduate instruction have g6ne rampant since the announcement of
the plan appeared in the San Francisco papers. Both the "Chronicle" and
the "Examiner" stated through their columns that the University intended
to drop the first two years of undergraduate instruction. Added confusion
arose on account of the inability of the city reporters to distinguish between
major-subject systems and academic councils.
The whole plan for the proposed reorganization was clearly stated in
Friday's issue of the Daily Palo Alto. It was pointed out that the University
had no intention of doing away with the first two years of college work, and
that the proposed plan was intended to work more particularly for the bene
fit of those students who come to college with no idea o£ what they wish to
specialize in. At the present time the larger percentage of the faculty un
doubtedly feel that the students who have had the complete four years of
work at Stanford are better students than those entering in the Junior year
from other colleges and more particularly from the Junior colleges.
The false impressions of the city newspapers must be cleared up on the
campus if outsiders are to be correctly informed. Many people of the San
Francisco vicinity undoubtedly believe that Stanford is to be made into a
graduate school. Every student who hears an expression of a mistaken im
pression should do all in his power to correct any false statements made.
The situation is extremely unfortunate and it is to be regretted that the im
pression must necessarily go uncorrected in the minds of so many outside
of the University.
