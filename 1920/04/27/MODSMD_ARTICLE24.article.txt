# LEADSRSHIP IN SUFFRAGE
## 
### 
TIHE ever sounding cry against suffrage is that the vote is not effective, in
* other words either the vote is not cast or it is not cast intelligently with
individual thought. University men and women have the broad training of a
college education and therefore have an unusual opportunity as well as a
duty to vote intelligently and to act as leaders in suffrage. This leadership
should begin in undergraduate life and continue after the votes has his A.B.
and goes out into other fields.
Stability is the big need in suffrage today. Intelligent leadership will
bring about stability. The first requisite for intelligent voting is knowledge.
Information concerning candidates is easily obtained, and a little exertion
in sorting out the truth from the lies will put the votes in a position to judge
for himself.
In the coming presidential campaign, California must decide between two
California candidates. The United States as a whole will be looking toward
California for her decision which makes intelligent thinking on the part of
the people of this state more imperative than ever before. Every college
man or woman should look into the history and achievements of Mr. Hoover
and Mr. Johnson, decide the issues as far as possible, and then vote. A
tremendous responsibility rests on the shoulders of California and university
students must be among those who will provide the leadership which will
make it possible for California to meet her responsibility.
