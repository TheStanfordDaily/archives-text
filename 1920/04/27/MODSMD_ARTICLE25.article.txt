# OPERA FEATURES ORIGINALITY IN CHARACTER PART
## Rehearsals Develop Talent in Leads and Choruses, Says Coach Seib 
### 
Lightness of touch 111 nearly every
phase of the production will char
acterize "A Leap Year Leap." The
plot is a breezy and fanciful concep
tion that has been delightfully handled
by the co-authors, Miss Mona Gardner,
'20, and Miss Jean Frickelton, '20.
Skillful touches by Gordon Davis, '18,
who adapted the book to the local
stage, only add to the light-hearted
spirit that permeates the book of the
1921 Junior Opera.
Written around this lively plot is
an unusually well-balanced musical
score. The music for "A Leap Year
Leap" is the work of several local
composers and as a result presents a
variety of melody that could not be
achieved otherwise. So far Coach
Lester Seib, '22, refuses to pick the
pieces that he believes will be the
song hits of the performance. "It's
harder than picking the next Presi
dent," says he. So the name of the
songs that will be featured in the per
formance remains as yet unsettled.
Too much cannot be said in favor
of Seib's method of coaching. Al
though he execises the strictest super
vision over the members of the chorus
in training them in their steps, so
far he has allowed the principals the
greatest freedom in expressing them
selves. He hopes by these means to
produce a cast that will possess far
more originality and freedom of ex
pression than the usual operetta cast
has. So far this looser system of di
tnis line Seib intends to follow
The Illinois Athletic Club, present
this policy until the final polishing
stages of the production next week.
The scenic decoration has been put
in the hands of Carol Alexander, '21,
who has made an extensive study of
the technique of the stage. Alex
ander promises to introduce some
novel scenic effects in the production
based on his study of current methods
in New York. A large amount of the
money quota to be expended on the
Junior Opera lias been laid aside for
scenic and costuming purposes.
