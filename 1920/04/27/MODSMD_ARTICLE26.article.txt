# LOCAL COLORS ARE PICTURED IN WORK BY CHARLES PETERS
## 
### Dorothy Nichols, '23 
The collection of paintings by Charles
Rollo Peters now being exhibited at the
Thomas Welton Stanford Art Gallery
is not one to be passed over hurriedly
or dismissed with a cursory visit. It
must be absorbed, as a sunset is ab
sorbed. It is this feature of reality that
strikes the layman most forcibly on
viewing Mr. Peters' work. His can
vasses not only reproduce the land
scape in its natural beauty, but they pro
duce in the' visitor the same emotional
response that the actual scene would
give. Mr. Peters is acknowledged as
one of the foremost living painters, and
perhaps the greatest of moonlight and
night artists. It is a high compliment to
the Stanford Art Gallery that he has
placed his farewell exhibition here in
stead of in San Francisco.
Mr. Peters is a native Californian,
and many of his subjects are local scenes
familiar to Stanford people. Thus, for
instance, is his study of "Yerba Buena"
at night, and of a cottage on San Fran
cisquito. Others, hardly less familiar,
are his paintings of the missions, of
adobe huts, and Spanish houses, such
as "Ramona's Home." Though the Cal
ifornia pictures predominate there are
also several English scenes, "Dorset
shire," "Anglesey." and "Old Kirk," and
some French settings.
In all of these night scenes, while they
are dark and subdued, there is a warmth
and richness of color that is startling.
It is in the blending of greens, blues, and
lavendars that he is able to depict the
brilliancy and beauty of the California
night. Especially noteworthy are his
water scenes, with the pale gleam of
moonlight, and the opalescent colors of
the sky. As perfect as is the reproduc
tion of moonlight, is the glow of yellow
light in windows, and the glitter of the
stars. In all the pictures there is imagi
nation, and it is this perhaps that ap
peals most strongly to the uncritical ob
server.
Several of Mr. Peters' earlier works
and daylight scenes are also exhibited,
but, with a few exceptions, these arc far
more ordinary than his nocturnal paint
ings. Among all the excellent works it
is impossible to pick out the best, though
perhaps the most striking are "The Clus
tering Town," and"The River." Among
the smaller pictures, "House of the
Witch Elms," "Old Kirk, England," the
mission and adobe house scenes stand
out.
The exhibition will only be on view
until next Tuesday, May 4.
