# Cardinal Nine To Meet Santa Clara
## Second Game of Series Will be Played; Newlands to Oppose Burke 
### 
The varsity baseball team will jour
ney to Santa Clara tomorrow afternoon
to play the second game of a three
game scries with the Santa Clara Col
lege team. The first game was played
last Saturday and the Cardinal team
was victorious, so Santa Clara must win
this game to even up the series.
Either Berg, the lefthander, or Burke,
who hurls from the starboard, will pitch
for Santa Clara, with Garcia doing mask
duty. Burke probably will start the
game as he worked but four innings of
last Saturday's game, and was more ef
fective than Berg, who finished the
game. â€¢
The varsity will line up the same way
as they did last Saturday. Pelouze and
Newlands will both be given a chance to
pitch against Santa Clara, and since a
third game is to t be played Saturday the
other players on the squad may be put
in during the game.
Following the third game of the sc
ries Saturday, the varsity will leave on
a trip into Washington and Oregon,
where they will meet the teams of the
northern colleges.
