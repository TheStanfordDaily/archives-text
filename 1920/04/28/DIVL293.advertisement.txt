we made this ciga
rette for you!
\ /OUR highest ideal of ciga-
J rette enjoyment begins the
day you get acquainted with
Camels. Quality wins you!
Camels expert blend of choice
Turkish and choice Domestic
Tobaccos is so new and so fasci
nating you'll prefer it to either
kind smoked straight.
Camels are wonderfully mild
and inviting, but that desirable
body is all there ! You smoke
them liberally without tiring
your taste. They leave no un
pleasant cigaretty aftertaste or
unpleasant cigaretty odor.
You appreciate Camels best
when you compare them with
any cigarette in the world at
any price!
Camels are so Id everywhere in scientifically stealed
packages of 20 cigarettes for 20 cents ; or ten pack
ages (.200 cigarettes) in u glassine-paper-covered
carton. Wo strongly recommend this carton for
the home or office supply or when you travel.
