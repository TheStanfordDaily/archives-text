# ASSEMBLY CALLED TO HEAR U. OF C. PRESIDENT SPEAK
## David Prescott Barrows is Secured to Address Students 
### 
Tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock,
President David Prescott Barrows, of
the University of California will speak
to a Stanford assembly upon a subject
as yet unannounced. Efforts have been
made for some time to secure President
Barrows' presence here, and this is the
first time that he has spoken to a Stan
ford audience.
The history of Barrows' life is an in
teresting one. He early went to the
Philippine Islands where, beginning as
city superintendent of schools in Manila,
he rose to the position of director of
education of the Islands in 1905. One
of the most instructive books on the
Philippine Islands is that by Barrows on
"A Decade of American Government in
the Philippines," and also his "History
of the Philippines."
Upon his return to the United States,
Barrows became Dean of the School of
Arts and Sciences and Dean of Facul
ties at California. He is President of
the Board of Trustees of Mills College.
Although his subject is unannounced, it
is to be expected that his wide experi
ence will undoubtedly furnish ample ma
terial for an interesting address.
