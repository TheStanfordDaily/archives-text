# "CALIFORNIA STRONG" STATES RUGBY HEAD
## Maloney Discusses Value of Campus Backing in Fund Drive 
### 
"California has been represented in
international athletic competitions by in
dividual stars, but never before has an
entire team playing- for the United
States been composed exclusively of
Californians. It will be a unique event,
even in the history of the Olympiads.
Moreover, ours will be the first rugby
fifteen to make a tour outside of the
States, and, because of that, also, we
will be am unusual drawing card on the
Continent."
H. Wilfred Maloney, president of the
California Rugby Union, made the abovt
statement this morning, when inter
viewed on the subject of the Union's
Olympic games rugby fifteen.
In regard to the chances of the Cali
fornians in winning the world contest,
Maloney said:
"No team can be sure of victory in
an international event of such magni
tude. For me to assure California that
her team will win, would be ridiculous.
The only actual facts we have that can
give any idea of the strength of the team
are those compiled from the tour of the
north by Stanford and California at
Christmas. Our record there, of four
victories, without allowing a hostile try,
speaks for itself."
With regard to the proposed drive for
funds on the campus, Maloney said:
"Going over the top here in short order
is imperative to the success of our un
dertaking. Stanford will have the most
men 011 the team â€”as many as all other
organizations put together. It will cost
over $15,000 just to pay the expenses of
the Stanford players. In approaching
supporters outside the campus the first
question asked lias been with regard
to the opinion of the University student
body. Alumni and sportsmen feel that
if Stanford is unable to give support to
her own men, it is not reasonable to ask
others to do so."
Plans for the proposed drive will be
released by Martinsen tomorrow. Only
a few days over two weeks remain with
in which to raise the full sum.
