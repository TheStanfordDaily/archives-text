# ONE GOOD GAME MARKS DAY'S PLAY
## 
### 
Only one Rood game was played on
th<: local diamonds yesterday after
noon in tne inter-group baseball series.
Plii Gamma Delta and the third floor
of Sequoia played a close game
through seven innings and the Phi
G's only won by one point with a 5-4
score. Both teams were working well
and the few bits of the game were
spaced at such intervals that the
teams could not turn them into runs.
The Phi Psis found an easy mark
in El Campo and trimmed them 10-3.
Theta Xi garnered ten runs off the
I'lii Kaps in the seven innings of play,
though this does not tell the story of
the game. The Phi Kap nine put up
a good fight but were unable to con
nect. with the curves of the Theta Xi
mound artists and only got four runs.
101 ("amino won their game from the
Unattached nine on forfeit.
Games for tomorrow are: Sequoia
(second floor) vs. Encina Bull Pen;
Phi Kappa Sigma vs. Sigma Chi; and
Kappa Sigma vs. Breakers. The last
game promises <>. be a good one for
both of the teams are fast and have
a number of good hitters in their
line-up.
The Rugby field is open tomorrow
and any team wishing to play off a.
game may arrange with Coach Acker.
