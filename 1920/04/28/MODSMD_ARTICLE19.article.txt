# THE
						REAL VALUE OF THE STRAW BALLOT
## 
### 
OERBERT HOOVER swept the campus yesterday by a four-to-one vote and
although neither the Hoover Club nor the Johnson Republican Club are
probably satisfied with the showing made, it is with distinct gratification that
The Daily Palo Alto reviews the results of the ballot. The Stanford com
munity was acknowledged a stronghold for Hoover, but it is thought that the
work of the Johnson Club had neutralized a considerable portion of Hoover
sentiment. The straw ballot has clarified the situation and both organizations
know where they stand. The ballot has cleared the way for the last hard
work before the primaries. The two political clubs undoubtedly have found
their weak spots and will be active in strengthening their position.
The real value of the straw ballot will come later when the Hoover
sentiment of the campus is made a dynamic force. The ballot is of little
value as far as actual votes are concerned because out of the 1596 votes cast
only a small percentage can be counted as actual votes for either one candi
date or another as there are only 225 registered voters on the campus. To
what use can this sentiment be turned and of what value is it?
Every man or woman who voted for Herbert Hoover yesterday in the
straw ballot has the opportunity to do effective work. The Daily Palo Alto
with the backing of the Hoover Club urges that every man and woman on
the campus write back home boosting Hoover but more particularly urging
the people whom you know intimately to vote. The larger the vote cast in
the primaries, the greater the chance for Hoover to win the California dele
gation. Mention the straw vote ballot in your letters home. Urge the home
people to boost Hoover. If you can't vote yourself do this to help get other
votes. The campus is strong behind Hoover and it should do everything to
make its opinion count in other communities. The opportunity has come for
those who will grasp it. Write home to your friends, write home to your
family and make tliem believe in this son of Stanford, the man of the hour â€”
Herbert Hoover.
