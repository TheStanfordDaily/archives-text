# RISE OF WORKERS IN EUROPE IS DESCRIBED
## Alice Riggs Hunt Discusses Present European Labor Movements 
### 
"The rise of the workers of Europe
is widespread; in practically every coun
try an upheaval of society is in progress,
giving evidence of the growing political
and social consciousness of the lower
classes," said Miss Alice Riggs Hunt,
newspaper writer and correspondent, in
her address on "Personalities of the Eu
ropean Labor Movement" last evening
in the Little Theater. "The two main
parties leading the labor movement are
the Socialists and the Communists. The
Socialists are those who believe, not in
industrial action, but in parliamentary
action; they advocate evolutionary rev
olution. Opposing them are the Com
munists, or Radicals, whose fundamental
purpose is the immediate socialization of
wealth, and the confiscation of capital
by the state. Their weapons are strike?
and raids. Then there is a third group
composed of the rich aristocrats, which
the Communists and Socialists call the
Bourgeoise, or "those who do not work."
"In Italy the labor â– movement is at its
height," continued Miss Hunt, "nowhere
else in Europe with the exception of
Russia are the Socialists and Commun
ists in such power. The army has
swung over to the side of the labor par
ties to such an extent that the only reg
iments which the government dare trust
are those composed entirely of officers.
"The Soviet government is surely im
pending in Italy," said Miss Hunt.
The Communists hold sway in Hun
gary, and are rapidly putting into effect
their ideal of abolishment of classes,
while in Austria, the "starved country,"
the Social Democrats hold sway under
Eritz Adler. Although powerful enough,
they do not bring about a revolution lie
cause, were it effected, they would lie
unable to feed it. At present the En
tente supplies the country with food, and
should a revolution take place it would
commence a food blockade, and the
country would starve.
The Jan res demonstration in Paris, in
which tiie army gave way before the
workers, was indicative of the growing
power of the labor parties.
In England, the British Labor Party
is in power. Some agitation for Soviet
government has begun in England and
in Scotland. The Irish are chiefly con
cerned with the home government prob
lem, in which the Scin Eeiners are the
chief agitators.
