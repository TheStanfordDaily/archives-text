# STANFORD AND RUGBY IN THE OLYMPIC GAMES
## 
### 
MONDAY opens the campus campaign under the auspices of the Rugby
* Union for funds to send fifteen men to represent the United States in
Rugby at the Olympic Games. Stanford has been accorded an unusual honor
in having the larger representation of the five universities sending men. On
account of this larger representation, the University has .a larger responsi
bility in providing the money to give her men the opportunity to carry Rugby
to the Olympic Games.
The quota for Stanford has been placed at $2000, a small percentage
of the $30,000 needed to successfully carry the team overseas. The cam
paign has received the endorsement of the most prominent men in the State
including Governor Stephens. This prominent endorsement will naturally
center attention of the outside world on Stanford and outsiders will watch
with interest to see how Stanford will back her men. The drive will open
Monday and continue all week. It is to be hoped that the campus will do
its part when the call is made. Stanford has the opportunity to play a big
part in the athletics of the world and it is to be hoped that the privilege of
playing that part will not be denied her by the members of her undergraduate
student body.
