# JOHNSON GETTING RADICAL VOTE IN EAST, SAYS LETTER
## Hoover Club Explains Why California is Gaining Apparent Victory 
### 
Th so-called victories of Senator
Hiram Johnson in several eastern
states are made the subject of a state
ment which has just been issued by
Ralph P. Merritt, campaign manager
of the Hoover Republican Club of Cali
fornia. The statement, which is self
explanatory, follows:
"Many inquiries are being made
about the vote which Johnson is get
ting in certain of the eastern states,
which is made to appear as great vic
tories for Johnson. His supporters
rely upon these victories to stampede
the people of California. As a matter
of fact, these are not victories; but
they are clear evidences of the type
of support which today is rallying to
Johnson. 13y appealing to the radical
and dissatisfied elements of Eastern
communities, Johnson has been able
to build up a strength which promises
disaster to this country unless the
people of California defeat him on
May 4th.
"In Michigan, he appealed to the
dissatisfied and the alien element of
the great industrial centers. In Illi
nois, the main Johnson vote was in
Chicago. The Mayor of Chicago, Win.
Hale Thompson, one of the foremost
pro-Germans in the United States de
siring to defeat Lowden, used his ma
chine together with a Hearst organiza
tion of radicals and pro-Germans to
roll up 45,000 votes for Johnson. In
Nebraska, two military men, General
Pershing and General Wood, were run
ning against each other. Against them,
Johnson again made a radical appeal
which, combined by the strength of
those who were opposed to the mili
tary candidates, brought him victory.
Forty-five per cent of the population of
Nebraska is of alien origin and 50%
of this foreign vote came originally
from either Germany or Austria. This
element is behind Johnson in order to
defeat the Treaty of Peace and in
order to enable Germany to escape
the war penalties exacted by the
Treaty of Peace.
Thus you will see that the apparent
victories of Johnson are a threat
against democracy. Arthur Brisbane
in the New York American (Hearst's
great paper) says: "Johnson should
go 10 the convention as a delegate and
then threaten third party movement
as follows: The voters of this country
have already nominated me. You do
the same if you don't want to see me
elected on an independent ticket."
For these reasons, every Hoover sup
porter should use every ounce of
strength to defeat Johnson.
