# Camp Fremont Storage Sheds To Be Scrapped
## 
### 
Following the sale or the remaining
buildings on the Camp Fremont site
at Menlo Park to a private party, a
sale of scrap lumber, to be conducted
on Thursday morning at 10 o'clock,
will mark the end of the camp as a
military possession. Stanford people
will remember the importance of Camp
Fremont when nearly 40>,000 men were
stationed there, and 200 buildings were
standing. These have dwindled down
to about thirty buildings, which are
now being removed.
