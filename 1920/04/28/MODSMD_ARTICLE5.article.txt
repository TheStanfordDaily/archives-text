# FRENCH CLUB TO GIVE PLAYS THIS EVENING
## Raoul May, '22, and Dorothy Elfving, '21, Will Have Leading Parts 
### 
Two little children "over there," in
France, without home, mother or
father, are appealing to the generosity
of Stanford students this evening. In
the Little Theater, at 8:15, two clever
French plays will be staged by the
members of the French Club, for the
benefit of the orphans. Full of lively
humor, action, and bright witticisms,
the plays promise much pleasure and
amusement to the audience. Raoul
May, '22, president of the club, re
marked today that Coach Davis has
worked so hard in his efforts to make
this affair a success, and has put so
much action into the plays that
whether one understands French or
not, he should find enjoyment in the
entertainment this evening.
French settlers in Mayfield and
Santa Clara, and residents of San
Mateo, and other adjoining peninsula
cities have displayed a vast amount
of interest and enthusiasm and have
promised to lend their co-operation by
being present this evening.
Besides the two plays, the program
will consist of selections from the
orchestra, and two piano solos by
Donuil Hillis. "La Marseillaise," sung
by Anna Franklin, '20, will conclude
the program.
