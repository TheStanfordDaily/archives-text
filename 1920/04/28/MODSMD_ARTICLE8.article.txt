# Hoover Carries Campus 4 to 1 Heavy Vote Cast For Alumnus Majority Claim G.O.P. Party
## 
### Ellen Calhoun, '20 
Herbert Hoover carried the Stan
ford campus by a four to one majority,
in the presidential primary straw bal
lot conducted by The Daily Palo Alto
yesterday. The total number of bal
lots reached 1569, which is the largest
vote ever cast at a Quad election on
the "Farm."
This ballot superceded the Rugby-
American football vote a few years
ago by a 500 margin. The Republican
vote numbered 1003, Democratic 300,
Independent 255, Socialist 4, and 7
contested.
The total vote for Hoover came to
1272, while that of Johnson numbered
307. Hoover received 1018 votes on
the Republican ticket and 257 votes
on the Democratic ticket. Lowden ran
third on the Republican ticket with
Wood a close fourth. Edwards ran a
poor second of the Democratic ticket
and McAdoo third.
The election committee was par
ticularly gratified by the indications
of intelligent voting on the part of
many members of the student body.
Although no Independent preference
was asked for on the ballot, 225 wrote
in "Independent" as opposed to either
a Republican or democratic prefer
ence. Four voted for Debs on the
Socialist ticket.
This week the Hoover Club with the
backing of The Daily Palo Alto is
launching a campaign urging all
Hoover voters to write home to their
family and friends urging them to turn
out to the polls on May 4 and vote in
the primaries. The larger the vote, it
is thought, the better the chances for
Hoover to swing the California delega
tion. Such movements have been

stronghold. Taking this fact into con

ford campus by a four to one majority,
in the presidential primary straw bal
lot conducted by The Daily Palo Alto
yesterday. The total number of bal
lots reached 1569, which is the largest
vote ever cast at a Quad election on
the "Farm."
This ballot superceded the Rugby-
American football vote a few years
ago by a 500 margin. The Republican
vote numbered 1003, Democratic 300,
Independent 255, Socialist 4, and 7
contested.
The total vote for Hoover came to
1272, while that of Johnson numbered
307. Hoover received 1018 votes on
the Republican ticket and 257 votes
on the Democratic ticket. Lowden ran
third on the Republican ticket with
Wood a close fourth. Edwards ran a
poor second of the Democratic ticket
and McAdoo third.
The election committee was par
ticularly gratified by the indications
of intelligent voting on the part of
many members of the student body.
Although no Independent preference
was asked for on the ballot, 225 wrote
in "Independent" as opposed to either
a Republican or democratic prefer
ence. Four voted for Debs on the
Socialist ticket.
This week the Hoover Club with the
backing of The Daily Palo Alto is
launching a campaign urging all
Hoover voters to write home to their
family and friends urging them to turn
out to the polls on May 4 and vote in
the primaries. The larger the vote, it
is thought, the better the chances for
Hoover to swing the California delega
tion. Such movements have been

started all over the country, particu
larly in universities where the student
body as a whole is not able to vote
but can do effective work in campaign
ing by the "write home" slogan.
The active work of the Johnson
Club was largely responsible for the
showing which he made in the ballot
yesterday. On account of Hoover be
ing a Stanford graduate and a mem
ber of the Board of Trustees, Stan
ford and the surrounding community
has always been conceded a Hoover
stronghold. Taking this fact into con
sideration, it is surprising that John
son pulled as many votes as he did.
Results of the election were wired
to New York Times this morning and
the figures of the ballot will be used
by Hoover Clubs throughout the whole
State.
