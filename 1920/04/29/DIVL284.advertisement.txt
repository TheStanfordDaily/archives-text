'HIS is a new-fashioned
world, but Murads are the
old-fashioned tasting Turkish
cigarette. 100 pure Turkish
tobacco makes thern tciste that way.
That's why thousands and thousands
~L of men demand them.
They gratify your pride and satisfy % v
your taste — and when you take them
out of your pocket in any company you have no
pologies to make. You know what we mean!
It is true that "ordinary" cigarettes cost a trifle less.
Judge for yourself— !
