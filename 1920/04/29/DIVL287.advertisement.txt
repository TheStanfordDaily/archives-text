A Rocky
Road
Tho' rough the way, and
stony,
She's nice to all who meet
her.
That stony stare she'll soon
forget;
ROCKY ROADS will make
her sweeter.
A confection that will offset even a sour disposition,
and smooth out the roughest wrinkle in Life's roadway.
A delectable combination of the lightest marshmallows,
fine-grained chocolate and rich, sweet walnuts, heavily
covered with a luscious thick dark chocolate coating.
Easy to eat. Rich and satisfying.
Learn about Rocky Roads today.
A mighty sweet road to travel.
One dime brings you the right of way.
