Distinctive Footwear .
FOR JUNIOR WEEK
Perhaps Ihe requirements of dress
demand that the claLs of the eorreet
designing and the exact fitting of
slippers for formal wear at Stanford
University be even more carefully at
tended than is customary.
Or perhaps the conservative prices on
our higher grades of footwear are an
attraction. In anv case we find that
we are enjoying the patronage of a
rapidly increasing number of custom
ers from that institution. And just
now as the number of social events
are piling up at the end of Ihe school
year we find them most interested in
our displays of party slippers. Per
haps the most popular model is
LAIHD-SCHOB Eli'S ALSACE SLIPPER IN
"Cloth of Silver"
A beautifully graceful model that
will serve to complete a variety of
costumes in a non-tarnishing metal
fabric. Strictly bench-made â€” care
fully fitted. Will permit the us of
Rhinestone buckles or may be worn
plain.
A complete selection of the accepted
patterns in the correct leathers and
fabrics awaits vour inspection.
