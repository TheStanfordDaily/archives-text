# BARROWS SCORES NEW PROPAGANDA AGAINST HOOVER
## U.C. President Denounces World Plots of Radicals Against Truth, Freedom 
### 
"Herbert Hoover is the victim of in
sidious propaganda based on his for
eign service activities, and intending to
discredit him in his own country. This
propaganda must be met by those who
know him." This was the statement
made at an Assembly this morning by
President David Prescott Barrows of the
University of California. Though not
working actively with any political or
ganization, President Barrows declared
that this deception of the American peo
ple by those political organs who would
make capital out of Hoover's service in
foreign lands was a source of annoy
ance and anger to him, and that he be
lieved that it rested with the University
students, to run down this and all other
harmful propaganda.
What we, the Universities of Stanford
and California, owe to each other as in
stitutions founded for the same identical
purpose of standing for higher learning,
was the subject of the first part of Bar
row's talk. "We stand as rivals, merely
to test each other's strength, not to de
feat each other," said Barrows. The
two universities owe each other a con
stant jealousy for each other's welfare.
Each university puts truth above all, and
since we are open to assault both as
individuals and as institutions, it lis
necessary that we sec to it that only the
truth is spoken about each other. That
the word of Stanford upon California's
good name carries greater weight than
any outside opinion, is Barrows' convic
tion.
We also owe each other support to
the proposals which emanate from the
sister institutions. Stanford showed
California the way in the great war
by finding a way of participating in it
even before the entry of the United
States, by the formation of its Ambu
lance Units and later by the Belgian Re
lief Units, and to these; efforts Califor
nia gave her loyal support.
Now the universities have a new task.
That is, by our learning we must protect
the commonwealth against deception. In
sidious propaganda of all sorts is sweep
ing the ' world. Lies, half-truths, and
underhand methods are the foundations
of world-wide movements. As an ex
ample of this. President Barrows told of
the lies which have discredited Admiral
Kolchak. a friend of his, in the eyes of
the world. Though a true patriot and
friend of liberalism, Admiral Kolchak
was maligned in this and other coun
tries. until finally, reputation gone and
deserted by his country and the Allies,
whom he was trying to help, he was
shot by the radicals. Propaganda to de
feat Poland, and perhaps Czecho-Slova
kia. was also discussed and denounced
by Barrows.
Organized propaganda must be met
by organized effort, and the University
students, with their high facultv for or
ganization are the ones best in the world
to do this. "We must have truth," de
clared Barrows in closing, "before we
can have anv of the other qualities of
justice, mercy, and generosity that we
so desire."
