# THETA DELTS, DEKES, CHI PSIS WINNERS IN INTRAMURAL LEAGUE
## 
### 
Theta Delta Chi rang up a surprise
on the Kappa Alpha nine last night
in a 7 to 2 victory on the varsity dia
mond. Both teams were in perfect
form for the first four innings and
then the K. A. nine blew up and let
in two tallies. This greased the skids
for the K. A.'s and they were unable
to come back against the three-run
lead that the Theta Delts had gained.
"Fat" Haynes on the mound for the
Theta Delts had the K. A. stick wield
ers at his mercy throughout the game
and allowed only three or four scatter
ed hits in the seven innings.
The Dekes won easily over the Chi
Psis in seven frames of easy ball. The
game promised to be good until the
first of the fifth when a double fumble
by the Chi Psis let in two runs for
the Dekes. D. K. E. collected three
runs in this frame and four in the next,
finishing with ten tallies and a lead
of eight runs over the Chi Psi nine.
Encina (second floor) was no match
for the Sigma Chi team. Neff. the
Sigma Chi luirler. held the Encina
team to a few scattered hits stretched
over several innings and his support
was so good that the few drives that
the Hall team got were grabbed off
for putouts, Steindorf in the box for
Encina had poor support and although
he did his best was unable to stop the
slide for the Sigma Chi. The game
ended in a ten to two riot for the
fraternity men.
