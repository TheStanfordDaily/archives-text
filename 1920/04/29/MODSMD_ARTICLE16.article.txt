Junior Week will open with the
Junior Prom, Friday evening, May 7.
The prom will be held in Encina Gym
nasium and from preparations which
will be made, it will be one of the most
pretentious affairs ever held on this
campus. Saturday evening the Junior
Opera will be held.
On the morning of May 8, women's
field sports are scheduled and on that
afternoon the Oregon Agricultural Col
llege will meet the Stanford track
sters. Sunday's program calls for lake
sports in the afternoon and in the
evening fireworks and music on the
Lake.
The dance committee has been hard
at work making preparations for the
Prom. Many new and novel ideas
interwoven with W. A. Gore's ability
to carry out the most complicated de
corating problems, will dress Encina
Gymnasium in a wonderful array of
beauty on the night of the Prom. An
Arabian effect will be given the ball
room and much realism will be added
by numerous Arabian relics which
have been obtained from San Fran
cisco.
The problem of catering will be
handled by a representative from
Frank Miller's of Palo Alto. System
is to be used in serving the food this
year, and it will be handled by ex
perienced waiters. During the time
taken up by dinner, entertainment
will be given. Another feature is that
punch will be served from four places
in the room, so as to decrease the
congestion around a single punch
bowl. The first dance will start at
9 o'clock sharp and music will be
furnished by the nine piece Olympic
Jazz orchestra, one of the best bay
city orchestras.
On Saturday night, Junior Opera will
hold full sway of campus activities.
This year's opera is made up of many
snappy songs and the theme of the
comedy is centered around a light
plot. All costumes are imported from
San Francisco and are chosen from
the best lots which cun be obtained.
Along with the main show, side-lights
and comic features will be worked in.
Tickets will go on sale Monday, at
12:50 p.m., for the opera, at the Book
store. There will be no drawing, but
the first there will be first served. On
Tuesday tickets will be placed on sale
at Crandall's in Palo Alto.
The last day of Junior Week is Sun
day. All festivities will be closed by
fireworks and music on the Lake, in
the evening. In the afternoon, lake
sports will be held.
