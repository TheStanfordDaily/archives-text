rjlHE DAILY PALO ALTO does not make it a policy to reprint editorials
from other publications but the following extract taken from the Satur
day Evening Post has a particlar message for the college man and woman.
We hope that the following excerpts will lead to the reading of the complete
editorial in this week's isbue of the Post.
"'They have killed the peace treaty!' was the unvarying form in
which the news was passed along when first it was flashed from Wash
ington.
"They" did not kill the peace treaty —we killed it. The buck
can't be passed so easily to Congress and the President. In their
months of wordy, windy wrangling, in their jockeying for political
place, in the maneuvering for partisan advantage, in their refusal to
forget personal animosities, "they" were the final and perfect ex
pression of our indifference to politics. Because of that indifference,
because we have been too lazy, too careless, too stupid to view gov
ernment as our personal concern, we are already paying a tremendous
bill in the disorganization of our business and the wasteful, unscienti
fic taxation of our earnings. Though it cannot be figured so accurate
ly, our failure to force the signing of peace quickly and to insist on
an agreement providing for some method by which the nations can
get together to discuss their differences, before going to war over
them, entails fresh losses, new expenditures. We are paying the
piper vast sums, and the devil is still to pay. War smoulders beneath
the ruins of Europe. As it dies down in one spot it blazes up fiercely
in another. Millions are still under arms; billions are still being
wasted.
The real causes that led to the war go back to racial hatreds,
international jealosies and shining-armor struttings. The real causes
that led to the killing of the peace treaty go back to our political
slothfulness, carelessness and partisanship. What we speak of the
Government as "they," instead of as "we," sums up our sorry con
ception of our rights and duties. We are rank outsiders in our most
important personal business because we have not had intelligence or
determination enough to get in on the ground floor.
Every right implies a duty. If you neglect that duty you cannot
complain if you forfeit the right that would be yours if you had per
formed it. If you neglect your plain duty to take part in the se
lection of the men who are to stand in the primaries, or if you allow
meaningless partisan considerations to influence your choice, you have
no right to feel aggrieved if your business is demoralized and your
income made free with by country lawyers and big-town politicians.
If you select as your representative a man whose training has quali
fied him to litigate fence-line quarrels and suits against the railroad
for cows that wander onto the right of way; if your fancy turns to
the boy orator and the demagogue—you have no legitimate complaint
when fence-line brains, hot air and confiscatory ideas are applied to
you and your problems. It is a matter of real wonder that in spite
our slackness so many men of brains; ability and honesty of purpose
do land in Congress."

WE notice that Alexander Kareff, manager of the fur trading company
on the Aleutian Islands, maintains a strictly neutral attitude in the present
political chaos. Anyone wanting to get anything which verged near Russia
these days would have to be more than neutral. From reports he would have
to be non-existant.

IT is to be regretted that the Pacific Coast Women's Athletic Association

months of wordy, windy wrangling, in their jockeying for political
place, in the maneuvering for partisan advantage, in their refusal to
forget personal animosities, "they" were the final and perfect ex
pression of our indifference to politics. Because of that indifference,
because we have been too lazy, too careless, too stupid to view gov
ernment as our personal concern, we are already paying a tremendous
bill in the disorganization of our business and the wasteful, unscienti
fic taxation of our earnings. Though it cannot be figured so accurate
ly, our failure to force the signing of peace quickly and to insist on
an agreement providing for some method by which the nations can
get together to discuss their differences, before going to war over
them, entails fresh losses, new expenditures. We are paying the
piper vast sums, and the devil is still to pay. War smoulders beneath
the ruins of Europe. As it dies down in one spot it blazes up fiercely
in another. Millions are still under arms; billions are still being
wasted.
The real causes that led to the war go back to racial hatreds,
international jealosies and shining-armor struttings. The real causes
that led to the killing of the peace treaty go back to our political
slothfulness, carelessness and partisanship. What we speak of the
Government as "they," instead of as "we," sums up our sorry con
ception of our rights and duties. We are rank outsiders in our most
important personal business because we have not had intelligence or
determination enough to get in on the ground floor.
Every right implies a duty. If you neglect that duty you cannot
complain if you forfeit the right that would be yours if you had per
formed it. If you neglect your plain duty to take part in the se
lection of the men who are to stand in the primaries, or if you allow
meaningless partisan considerations to influence your choice, you have
no right to feel aggrieved if your business is demoralized and your
income made free with by country lawyers and big-town politicians.
If you select as your representative a man whose training has quali
fied him to litigate fence-line quarrels and suits against the railroad
for cows that wander onto the right of way; if your fancy turns to
the boy orator and the demagogue—you have no legitimate complaint
when fence-line brains, hot air and confiscatory ideas are applied to
you and your problems. It is a matter of real wonder that in spite
our slackness so many men of brains; ability and honesty of purpose
do land in Congress."

WE notice that Alexander Kareff, manager of the fur trading company
on the Aleutian Islands, maintains a strictly neutral attitude in the present
political chaos. Anyone wanting to get anything which verged near Russia
these days would have to be more than neutral. From reports he would have
to be non-existant.

"'They have killed the peace treaty!' was the unvarying form in

can't be passed so easily to Congress and the President. In their
