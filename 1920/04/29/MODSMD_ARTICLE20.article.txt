# STEPHENS PRAISES OLYMPIC PLANS OF STATE RUGBY UNION
## Doe and Templeton Chosen to Handle Local Fund Drive 
### 
Campaign headquarters of the Cali
fornia Rugby Union were greatly en
couraged this morning, by the receipt
of the following letter from Governor
Stephens, officially praising the ef
forts of the Union, in behalf of Cali
fornia. Steps were immediately taken
to secure endorsements from represen
tative Chambers of Commerce, and
from officials in various parts of the
state, in order to facilitate the Union's
work in raising funds for the trip to
the Olympic Games.
The letter follows.
I understand that the Olympic
Games Rugby Team is to be picked
by the California Rugby Union
from the best amateur Rugby foot
ball players in the State of Cali
fornia and is to contest for the
world's championship in the
Olympic Games at Antwerp, Bel
gium.
I am at all times heartily in
favor of proper promotion of
amateur athletics. Furthermore,
I do not hesitate to say that a
team of clean cut, young Cali
fornia athletes will compete in
the Olympiad in a manner which
will be a credit and a splendid
advertisement for our state.
Plans for the Stanford drive, which
is to begin at 8:00 o'clock Monday
morning, were completed with the ap
pointment of "Dink" Templeton and
Chailes Doe, by H. Wilfred Maloney,
as President of the Union, to have
charge of the local campaign. Speak
ers chosen by the two managers from
among the men who are to make the
trip, will address the various living
groups on the campus tonight and to
morrow night, explaining the purposes
of the drive, and giving further in
formation with regard to the planned
tour. Among the men who will work
for the success of the campaign are
Kirksey, Patrick, Haseltine, Wrenn,
Smitherun, Wallace and Clark.
On Monday morning desks will be
set up on the quad, and a blackboard
will keep the student-body constantly
informed as to the results of the drive.
"I would like to emphasize the im
portance of Stanford's going over the
top at once," said Maloney this morn
ing. Unless the men who are to make
the trip lend their untired efforts to
wards making our undertaking a suc
cess, we cannot win. Unless they
show the student body that they are
enthusiastic about it, they should not
expect campus support. In working
outside the campus, we are even in a
more dangerous position, for unless
we can show the sportsmen we have
to reach that the Stanford, and other
universities, are behind this move, we
cannot expect them, as outsiders, to
give their share."
