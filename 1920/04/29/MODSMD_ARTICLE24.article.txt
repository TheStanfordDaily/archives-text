# TRUSTEE NOURSE MAY TAKE MELVIN'S PLACE ON BENCH
## 
### 
Judge John T. Nourse, '00, member
of the University Board of Trustees
appears to be the most likely candi
date to be appointed by Governor Wm.
D. Stephens to fill the place of the
late Henry A. Melvin on the State
Supreme Court bench. If the appoint
ment is made it will be the third
judicial appointment given Nourse by
Governor Stephens.
In 1917 he was appointed to the
Superior Court in San Francisco to
fill the vacancy created by the death
of Judge James A. Seawell. Within
six months after having been appoint
ed to this position he was elected
temporary presiding judge of the
court. Before the end of the year he
was assigned to the chair of probate
judge.
Upon the enlargement of the District
Court of Appeals he was named as
sociate justice in the second division
of the first district.
When Nourse ran for re-election
after each of these appointments to
fill unexpired terms he was always
elected.
