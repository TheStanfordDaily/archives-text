# LOCAL HOOVER CLUB APPEALS TO ALL STANFORD ALUMNAE
## 
### 
An appeal to Stanford graduates all
over California to enlist in the Hoover
cause is being made by the Stanford
Hoover Club. The appeal is in the
form of the following letter:
"Dear Stanfordite:
"There is before the country today as
a candidate for the presidency of the
United States Stanford's most famous
son—Herbert Hoover- You, with all
other Stanford people, we are sure, have
watched with particular interest the
magnificent work of Mr. Hoover during
the trying years of the war. We have
seen him emerge as a benefactor of hu
manity, honored, trusted, his hands clean
—the foremost citizen of the world. We
have seen him embodying the Stanford
spirit and the Stanford ideals in the
practical affairs of the world. He has
been trusted implicitly by every nation
of Europe, allied or enemy; he has
been trusted implicitly by the millions of
people who saved food under his direc
tion during this country's activity in the
war; he has evoked the enthusiasm and
loyalty of every man who has worked
with him in his humanitarian enter
prises.
"Because we know the Stanford ideals
which motivate Mr. Hoover, because we
know what he has done for Stanford, be
cause we believe that these characteris
tics fit him for the highest position'
which the nation can offer, we are anx
ious to do all that is in our power to aid
in his nomination and election. The
Stanford Hoover Club has been formed
to further this movement.
"We want you, as a Stanfordite,
wherever you may be, to aid in this
campaign. It is not enough merely to
be for Mr. Hoover. To carrv California
in the primary on May 4, it is necessary
for those favoring Hoover to buck
against the most powerful machine ever
known in California—that of Hiram
Johnson. The only way that this can be
done is bv the formation, by Hoover's
friends and believers, of voluntary Hoov
er Clubs, which will take an active part
in marshaling the Hoover forces for
the campaign.
"If there is already a Hoover Club in
your locality, join it, and take an active
part. If not, get together those who are
believers in Hoover and form such a
club. You can get all the Hoover lit
erature necessary from the Hoover Re
publican Club of California, Sutter and
Montgomery Streets, San Francisco, Cal.
You can obtain a capable speaker for
such a meeting by communicating with
the club in San Francisco, or, if lo
cated within any reasonable distance
of Stanford University, from this head
quarters. Get a list of the registered
voters in your locality and see that a
personal canvass is made, the Hoover
people collected, and every effort made
to sec that they get to the polls on May
4. Get the newspapers in your locality
to print Hoover publicity about the ac
tivities of your club, and if possible take
space and tell the people about Hoover,
using a return coupon for those who
want to enroll in the Hoover Club, and
for those who are willing to work with
their machines during the election, or in
other ways- Hoover placards for store
windows and similar advertising may be
obtained from the Hoover Headquarters
in San Francisco.
"With such concerted effort of a vol
untary Hoover organization, the chances
are very good of sending the Califor
nia delegation to the Chicago convention
pledged to vote for Herbert Hoover.
Let us make this the biggest Stanford
turnout ever known. Do your part in
making Stanford the victor in the big

gest contest in which it has ever been
our privilege to compete.
"Loyally yours,
"The Stanford Hoover Club."
