# MEET WITH OLYMPIC CLUB IS CALLED OFF
## 
### 
Owing to the disability of several
of the Stanford track men, the ched
uled meet with the Olympic Club to
have been held on the local oval Sat
urday afternoon, has been called off.
Klrksey, Templeton, Westwick, Wil
cox, and Green have as yet not fully
recovered from injuries to their legs
received in the California meet, and
because of this Coach Harry Maloney
is taking no chances of crippling the
te;im for the Pacific Coast Conference
moot only two weeks away. Although
the men are in no serious condition
any excessive strain may result in
eliminating them from further con
tests this season.
The Oregon Aggie meet which is
cheduled for May S may be held earlier
in order to allow the varsity team to
compete in the P. A. A. at Berkeley
on the same date.
