# VARSITY SUFFERS DEFEAT AT HANDS OF SANTA CLARA
## Four Pitchers Used by Stanford; Varsity Outhits Missionites But Fails to Win 
### 
Santa Clara handed the varsity a
drubbing yesterday afternoon at Santa
Clara, piling up twelve runs in eight in
nings against three made by Stanford.
Four pitchers were used in an effort to
stop the runmaking of the Mission play
ers, but the team was so wobbly behind
them that it was impossible. None of
the pitchers was hit hard, but skull
plays in the field and on the bases al
lowed the Santa Clarans to pile up a
big lead in the early innings, and they
were never headed.
Pelouze started the game and allowed
two hits in two innings. These two
hits coupled with four errors sent over
five runs. Newlands, who succeeded
him, was touched for four runs in the
fourth on two hits, two free passes, and
an error. Briggs went in in the sixth
and three bingles made off him added
three more runs. Ncer finished the game
and prevented any further damage.
Burke worked the whole game for
Santa Clara. Eleven safeties were gar
nered off his delivery, but they were
ineffective for the most part, because he
kept them scattered throughout the
game.
Besides the numerous errors charged
against the varsity there were many
other errors of omission that served
take the heart out of the pitches. Poor
umpiring contributed to the general
rout.
The score:
H. R. E.
Stanford 12 3 2
Santa Clara 9 12 1
Batteries — Stanford, Pelouze, New
lands, Briggs, Ncer, and Bundy. Santa
