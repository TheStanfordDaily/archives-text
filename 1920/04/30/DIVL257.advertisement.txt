Greater X-ray Service —
through Research
FOR years after the discovery of
X-rays it was evident that only
intensive research could unfold their
real possibilities.
Meanwhile, scientists of the General
Electric Company developed the pro
cess of making wrought tungsten.
This proved ideal as the target in X-ray
tubes and its use for this purpose soon
became universal.
Then further research resulted in the
development of an X-ray tube of a
radically new type — the Coolidge
Tube — with both electrodes of
wrought tungsten and containing the
highest attainable vacuum.

quantities impossible. The answer to
this problem was the Langmuir Con
densation Pump, utilizing mercury
vapor in its operation and almost
automatic.
To meet the need for simple
apparatus during the war, th
Laboratory developed the Self-Recti
fying Cooiidge Tube, which made
possible portable outfits at the front.
The latest X-ray outfit of this type
is so small it can be taken conve
niently to the home or to the bedside
in the hospital.
Thus the Research Laboratory of the
General Electric Company continues
to serve, that progress in things elec
trical may continue for the good of
humanity.
