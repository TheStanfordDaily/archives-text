T^H AT is the kind of increase in sr.lnry
the minister has received. His living
expenses have risen just as fast and as far
as yours.
But he is paid on the average just 52 ccnts
mere per church member than he was paid 34
years ago.
The Minister Never Faih You
Every officer of the Government with a war
message to deliver appealed to the ministers first
of all.
But 80% of the ministers receive less income
than government economists figure as a minimum
for the support of an average family.
When hospitals need money they enlist the
support of the ministers —and receive it.
But when sickness visits the minister or the
members of his family they must be treated in a
charity ward. His pay is less than a day laborer's.
8 out of every 10 ministers receive less than
$20 a week —about half the pay of a mechanic.
We Pay Him Half the Wages of a F."cchaaic
And of these pitifully inadequate salaries, how much do
you contribute? Nothing if you are outside the church;
an average of. less than 3c a day if you are a church
member.
All of us share in the benefits of Christian ministers to
the community. They marry us; bury us; baptize our
children; visit us when we are sick. In their hands is the
spiritual training of the youth.
We Are All Profiteers ct Their Expense
Part of the Interchurch World program is this —a living
wage for every minister of Jesus Christ; an efficient plant,
and a chance to do a big man's job.
If you want better preachers, help to pay the preachers
better. It's thf best investment for your community----and
for your childien —that you can eve' make.
