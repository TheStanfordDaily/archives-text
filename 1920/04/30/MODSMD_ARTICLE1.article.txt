# STANFORD PLAYS SANTA CLARA IN DECIDING CONTEST
## Draper to Pitch for Varsity With Lefty Berg Opposing; Exciting Game is Expected 
### 
The Santa Clara diamond warriors
will invade the campus tomorrow af
ternoon, their object being to defeat
the varsity in the third game of the
series. Tomorrow's contest will be the
deciding one, Stanford having won the
first game last Sunday afternoon by a
score of 6 to 2, and Santa Clara re
ciprocated by taking the game on
their own lot Wednesday afternoon
by 12 to 3.
Draper will start on the hill for the
Varsity with Bundy behind the log.
Draper pitched the winning game last
Saturday, setting the Mission Collegers
down with five lone hits. He has had
a week of rest and should be in fine
fettle.
Berg, the portsider, will probably
do the chucking for the visitors, with
Garcia on the receiving end. Berg has
not worked this week either, so that
prospects for a pitcher's du,el are
good.
The two teams will present the same
lineups as in the two previous games.
