# STANFORD RESIDENCE TO BE MADE CONVALESCENT HOME
## Students Will Aid in Renovation 
### 
Opportunity for the men and women
of Stanford University to do some
thing as a body for the Lane Clinics
became a possibility this afternoon
when the Board of Trustees made
available the old Stanford residence
on San Franciscquito Creek as a con
valescing home for children who have
received treatment in San Francisco.
The Trustees agreed to place the
residence at the disposal of the Board
of Directors of the Stanford Clinic
Home for that use.
The opportunity of the Stanford
student body is involved in the fol
lowing plan, the first step of which
was consummated this afternoon:
1. Adaptation of the Stanford
residence as a children's recupe
rating home in place of the old
Acacia house which is now being
used for that purpose.
2. A Student body "Labor Day"
at whioh time the men and the
women of the student body would
put thc> grounds around the resi
dence in condition for the home.
This Labor Day would be con
tinued annually.
3. Dedication of the residence
and grounds as a memorial to
Senator and Mrs. Leland Stan
ford.
With the residence and grounds now
in the hands of the directors of the
home, the next step is the Labor Day.
It is the plan to declare a university
holiday. On this day the entire stu
dent body would go to the grounds
and do the work necessary. There are
twenty-seven acres in the grounds and
at present a rank growth of weeds has
taken control. The men, under the
direction of university gardeners,
would do the manual labor while the
women of the university would serve
food.
Wilbur Approves Plan
President Wilbur has heartily ap
proved of the plan. It does not have

to be said that the student body will
not let such an opportunity pass. For
the great part, the lumbers of the
student body have done nothing to aid
in the work being carried on by the
auxiliary. In fact, the majority of the
students have known little about it.
True, there are some who already have
become keenly interested in the work
and have lent a helping hand, but for
the most part student attention has
not been turned in this direction.
This, then, is an opportunity for
the undergraduates to aid in a materi
al manner. The work necessary to
put the grounds in shape would cost
several hundred dollars. The directors
work on contributed funds and these
funds arc limited. The work possible
for the student body to do would thus
save money which could be used for
other purposes. At the same time,
the students would be doing an act
which is in furtherance of a purely
Stanford undertaking and one which
everyone realizes is a worthy one.
The Memorial Plan
The third step in the plan is to
make the ground and residence a me
morial to the Stanfords. It was one
of Mrs. Stanford's wishes that the
residence should be used for some
such purpose as was made possible
today. Nothing, then, could be more
appropriate than the use to which it
is to be put and the dedication as a
memorial.
It is not exactly accurate to say the
residence has been made available for
the purpose outlined, for the Stanford
residence proper was destroyed by the
earthquake. The building which will
be used for the children's liome is
the servants' quarters, but it is all
that remains in the building line of
what was formerly the Stanford resi
dence.
It is a large building, however, and
at least thirty children can easily be
accommodated there. In the present
quarters in the old Acacia house on
the campus only ten or twelve chil
dren can be accommodated at any one
time
Another objection to the present
quarters is that there are no grounds.
The twenty-seven acres surrounding
the Stanford residence will give ample
room for the children brought down
from San Francisco to romp and play
in and thus regain their health.
Has Interesting Grounds
The grounds contain many interest
ing things connected with the life and
nistory of Stanford. There are sev
eral trees which were planted by well
known personages. One of them was
planted by President Hayes. Two or
three otners are from seeds taken by
Mrs. Stanford from trees planted by
Marie Antoinette in the royal gardens
in France.
Another part of the grounds con
tains the swing which Leland Stan
ford. Jr., used to use. And there, also,
is his mystic maze in which he played.
An old fountain graces another spot,
but the weeds have taken control
there also, and it needs attention. In
the course of a day the men of the
university, aided by the women, could
easily make the grounds into a place
of beauty—a park which would come
to be known as a definite part of
Stanford, and not, as now, an unknown
section of the campus.
Roth Interested
Comptroller Roth, who himself is
highly interest in the plans outlined
above will furnish the necessary tools
for the Labor Day. The whole plan
is to make the day one of sacrifice on
the part of the students, at which
time they would drop their university
work in order to aid in the philanthrop
ic work.
For some time, the buildings and
grounds have been leased out and it
was only within the last few weeks
that they again came into the control
of the Trustees, making it possible for
the step taken today.
The next step rests with the mem
bers of the student body. If they are
willing to do the work it is very likely
that a university holiday for the pur
pose will be declared.
Purpose of Auxiliary
The purpose of the Children's Home
is one charity. If it were nor for
the work carried on by this organiza
tion, which is composed of Stanford
graduates and persons directly inter
ested in Stanford otherwise, children
treated at the Lane Clinics in San
Francisco wouldr, after their sickness,
be returned to their homes. Of course,
as the name implies, the Lane Clinic
does its work without charge and the
persons treated there come from the
poor element. The homes to which
the children would be returned, it fol
lows, would not be the best for re
cuperating or convalescent youngsters.
The directors took over the Acacia
house in order to get the children out
in the air and sunlight as much as
possible. But this location has the
shortcomings which have been stated.
Place Is Ideal
No more ideal a place could be
found for such a purpose than the
Stanford residence. There is an en
trance from the State Highway just
south of the San Franciscquito Creek
bridge, and roads lead to the ground
also from the campus proper. The
building itself is large and airy, with
planty of sunlight and room. There
are three stories and opportunity for
sleeping porches 011 all of them.
The grounds skirt the creek for
several hundred yards and contain
plenty of trees and shrubbery, includ
ing an orchard with various kinds of
fruit trees.

Comptroller Roth, who himself is
highly interest in the plans outlined
above will furnish the necessary tools
for the Labor Day. The whole plan
is to make the day one of sacrifice on
the part of the students, at which
time they would drop their university
work in order to aid in the philanthrop
ic work.
For some time, the buildings and
grounds have been leased out and it
was only within the last few weeks
that they again came into the control
of the Trustees, making it possible for
the step taken today.
The next step rests with the mem
bers of the student body. If they are
willing to do the work it is very likely
that a university holiday for the pur
pose will be declared.
Purpose of Auxiliary
The purpose of the Children's Home
is one charity. If it were nor for
the work carried on by this organiza
tion, which is composed of Stanford
graduates and persons directly inter
ested in Stanford otherwise, children
treated at the Lane Clinics in San
Francisco wouldr, after their sickness,
be returned to their homes. Of course,
as the name implies, the Lane Clinic
does its work without charge and the
persons treated there come from the
poor element. The homes to which
the children would be returned, it fol
lows, would not be the best for re
cuperating or convalescent youngsters.
The directors took over the Acacia
house in order to get the children out
in the air and sunlight as much as
possible. But this location has the
shortcomings which have been stated.
Place Is Ideal
No more ideal a place could be
found for such a purpose than the
Stanford residence. There is an en
trance from the State Highway just
south of the San Franciscquito Creek
bridge, and roads lead to the ground
also from the campus proper. The
building itself is large and airy, with
planty of sunlight and room. There
are three stories and opportunity for
sleeping porches 011 all of them.
The grounds skirt the creek for
several hundred yards and contain
plenty of trees and shrubbery, includ
ing an orchard with various kinds of
fruit trees.
Opportunity for the men and women
of Stanford University to do some
thing as a body for the Lane Clinics
became a possibility this afternoon
when the Board of Trustees made
available the old Stanford residence
on San Franciscquito Creek as a con
valescing home for children who have
received treatment in San Francisco.
The Trustees agreed to place the
residence at the disposal of the Board
of Directors of the Stanford Clinic
Home for that use.
The opportunity of the Stanford
student body is involved in the fol
lowing plan, the first step of which
was consummated this afternoon:
1. Adaptation of the Stanford
residence as a children's recupe
rating home in place of the old
Acacia house which is now being
used for that purpose.
2. A Student body "Labor Day"
at whioh time the men and the
women of the student body would
put thc> grounds around the resi
dence in condition for the home.
This Labor Day would be con
tinued annually.
3. Dedication of the residence
and grounds as a memorial to
Senator and Mrs. Leland Stan
ford.
With the residence and grounds now
in the hands of the directors of the
home, the next step is the Labor Day.
It is the plan to declare a university
holiday. On this day the entire stu
dent body would go to the grounds
and do the work necessary. There are
twenty-seven acres in the grounds and
at present a rank growth of weeds has
taken control. The men, under the
direction of university gardeners,
would do the manual labor while the
women of the university would serve
food.
Wilbur Approves Plan
President Wilbur has heartily ap
proved of the plan. It does not have

to be said that the student body will
not let such an opportunity pass. For
the great part, the lumbers of the
student body have done nothing to aid
in the work being carried on by the
auxiliary. In fact, the majority of the
students have known little about it.
True, there are some who already have
become keenly interested in the work
and have lent a helping hand, but for
the most part student attention has
not been turned in this direction.
This, then, is an opportunity for
the undergraduates to aid in a materi
al manner. The work necessary to
put the grounds in shape would cost
several hundred dollars. The directors
work on contributed funds and these
funds arc limited. The work possible
for the student body to do would thus
save money which could be used for
other purposes. At the same time,
the students would be doing an act
which is in furtherance of a purely
Stanford undertaking and one which
everyone realizes is a worthy one.
The Memorial Plan
The third step in the plan is to
make the ground and residence a me
morial to the Stanfords. It was one
of Mrs. Stanford's wishes that the
residence should be used for some
such purpose as was made possible
today. Nothing, then, could be more
appropriate than the use to which it
is to be put and the dedication as a
memorial.
It is not exactly accurate to say the
residence has been made available for
the purpose outlined, for the Stanford
residence proper was destroyed by the
earthquake. The building which will
be used for the children's liome is
the servants' quarters, but it is all
that remains in the building line of
what was formerly the Stanford resi
dence.
It is a large building, however, and
at least thirty children can easily be
accommodated there. In the present
quarters in the old Acacia house on
the campus only ten or twelve chil
dren can be accommodated at any one
time
Another objection to the present
quarters is that there are no grounds.
The twenty-seven acres surrounding
the Stanford residence will give ample
room for the children brought down
from San Francisco to romp and play
in and thus regain their health.
Has Interesting Grounds
The grounds contain many interest
ing things connected with the life and
nistory of Stanford. There are sev
eral trees which were planted by well
known personages. One of them was
planted by President Hayes. Two or
three otners are from seeds taken by
Mrs. Stanford from trees planted by
Marie Antoinette in the royal gardens
in France.
Another part of the grounds con
tains the swing which Leland Stan
ford. Jr., used to use. And there, also,
is his mystic maze in which he played.
An old fountain graces another spot,
but the weeds have taken control
there also, and it needs attention. In
the course of a day the men of the
university, aided by the women, could
easily make the grounds into a place
of beauty—a park which would come
to be known as a definite part of
Stanford, and not, as now, an unknown
section of the campus.

morial to the Stanfords. It was one
of Mrs. Stanford's wishes that the
residence should be used for some
such purpose as was made possible
today. Nothing, then, could be more
appropriate than the use to which it
is to be put and the dedication as a
memorial.
It is not exactly accurate to say the
residence has been made available for
the purpose outlined, for the Stanford
residence proper was destroyed by the
earthquake. The building which will
be used for the children's liome is
the servants' quarters, but it is all
that remains in the building line of
what was formerly the Stanford resi
dence.
It is a large building, however, and
at least thirty children can easily be
accommodated there. In the present
quarters in the old Acacia house on
the campus only ten or twelve chil
dren can be accommodated at any one
time
Another objection to the present
quarters is that there are no grounds.
The twenty-seven acres surrounding
the Stanford residence will give ample
room for the children brought down
from San Francisco to romp and play
in and thus regain their health.
Has Interesting Grounds
The grounds contain many interest
ing things connected with the life and
nistory of Stanford. There are sev
eral trees which were planted by well
known personages. One of them was
planted by President Hayes. Two or
three otners are from seeds taken by
Mrs. Stanford from trees planted by
Marie Antoinette in the royal gardens
in France.
Another part of the grounds con
tains the swing which Leland Stan
ford. Jr., used to use. And there, also,
is his mystic maze in which he played.
An old fountain graces another spot,
but the weeds have taken control
there also, and it needs attention. In
the course of a day the men of the
university, aided by the women, could
easily make the grounds into a place
of beauty—a park which would come
to be known as a definite part of
Stanford, and not, as now, an unknown
section of the campus.
Roth Interested
Comptroller Roth, who himself is
highly interest in the plans outlined
above will furnish the necessary tools
for the Labor Day. The whole plan
is to make the day one of sacrifice on
the part of the students, at which
time they would drop their university
work in order to aid in the philanthrop
ic work.
For some time, the buildings and
grounds have been leased out and it
was only within the last few weeks
that they again came into the control
of the Trustees, making it possible for
the step taken today.
The next step rests with the mem
bers of the student body. If they are
willing to do the work it is very likely
that a university holiday for the pur
pose will be declared.
Purpose of Auxiliary
The purpose of the Children's Home
is one charity. If it were nor for
the work carried on by this organiza
tion, which is composed of Stanford
graduates and persons directly inter
ested in Stanford otherwise, children
treated at the Lane Clinics in San
Francisco wouldr, after their sickness,
be returned to their homes. Of course,
as the name implies, the Lane Clinic
does its work without charge and the
persons treated there come from the
poor element. The homes to which
the children would be returned, it fol
lows, would not be the best for re
cuperating or convalescent youngsters.
The directors took over the Acacia
house in order to get the children out
in the air and sunlight as much as
possible. But this location has the
shortcomings which have been stated.
Place Is Ideal
No more ideal a place could be
found for such a purpose than the
Stanford residence. There is an en
trance from the State Highway just
south of the San Franciscquito Creek
bridge, and roads lead to the ground
also from the campus proper. The
building itself is large and airy, with
planty of sunlight and room. There
are three stories and opportunity for
sleeping porches 011 all of them.
The grounds skirt the creek for
several hundred yards and contain
plenty of trees and shrubbery, includ
ing an orchard with various kinds of
fruit trees.
Opportunity for the men and women
of Stanford University to do some
thing as a body for the Lane Clinics
became a possibility this afternoon
when the Board of Trustees made
available the old Stanford residence
on San Franciscquito Creek as a con
valescing home for children who have
received treatment in San Francisco.
The Trustees agreed to place the
residence at the disposal of the Board
of Directors of the Stanford Clinic
Home for that use.
The opportunity of the Stanford
student body is involved in the fol
lowing plan, the first step of which
was consummated this afternoon:
1. Adaptation of the Stanford
residence as a children's recupe
rating home in place of the old
Acacia house which is now being
used for that purpose.
2. A Student body "Labor Day"
at whioh time the men and the
women of the student body would
put thc> grounds around the resi
dence in condition for the home.
This Labor Day would be con
tinued annually.
3. Dedication of the residence
and grounds as a memorial to
Senator and Mrs. Leland Stan
ford.
With the residence and grounds now
in the hands of the directors of the
home, the next step is the Labor Day.
It is the plan to declare a university
holiday. On this day the entire stu
dent body would go to the grounds
and do the work necessary. There are
twenty-seven acres in the grounds and
at present a rank growth of weeds has
taken control. The men, under the
direction of university gardeners,
would do the manual labor while the
women of the university would serve
food.
Wilbur Approves Plan
President Wilbur has heartily ap
proved of the plan. It does not have

to be said that the student body will
not let such an opportunity pass. For
the great part, the lumbers of the
student body have done nothing to aid
in the work being carried on by the
auxiliary. In fact, the majority of the
students have known little about it.
True, there are some who already have
become keenly interested in the work
and have lent a helping hand, but for
the most part student attention has
not been turned in this direction.
This, then, is an opportunity for
the undergraduates to aid in a materi
al manner. The work necessary to
put the grounds in shape would cost
several hundred dollars. The directors
work on contributed funds and these
funds arc limited. The work possible
for the student body to do would thus
save money which could be used for
other purposes. At the same time,
the students would be doing an act
which is in furtherance of a purely
Stanford undertaking and one which
everyone realizes is a worthy one.
