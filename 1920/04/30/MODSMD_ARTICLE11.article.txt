# STANFORD RESIDENCE TO BE MADE CONVALESCENT HOME
## Students Will Aid in Renovation 
### 
Opportunity for the men and women
of Stanford University to do some
thing as a body for the Lane Clinics
became a possibility this afternoon
when the Board of Trustees made
available the old Stanford residence
on San Franciscquito Creek as a con
valescing home for children who have
received treatment in San Francisco.
The Trustees agreed to place the
residence at the disposal of the Board
of Directors of the Stanford Clinic
Home for that use.
The opportunity of the Stanford
student body is involved in the fol
lowing plan, the first step of which
was consummated this afternoon:
1. Adaptation of the Stanford
residence as a children's recupe
rating home in place of the old
Acacia house which is now being
used for that purpose.
2. A Student body "Labor Day"
at whioh time the men and the
women of the student body would
put thc> grounds around the resi
dence in condition for the home.
This Labor Day would be con
tinued annually.
3. Dedication of the residence
and grounds as a memorial to
Senator and Mrs. Leland Stan
ford.
With the residence and grounds now
in the hands of the directors of the
home, the next step is the Labor Day.
It is the plan to declare a university
holiday. On this day the entire stu
dent body would go to the grounds
and do the work necessary. There are
twenty-seven acres in the grounds and
at present a rank growth of weeds has
taken control. The men, under the
direction of university gardeners,
would do the manual labor while the
women of the university would serve
food.
Wilbur Approves Plan
President Wilbur has heartily ap
proved of the plan. It does not have

to be said that the student body will
not let such an opportunity pass. For
the great part, the lumbers of the
student body have done nothing to aid
in the work being carried on by the
auxiliary. In fact, the majority of the
students have known little about it.
True, there are some who already have
become keenly interested in the work
and have lent a helping hand, but for
the most part student attention has
not been turned in this direction.
This, then, is an opportunity for
the undergraduates to aid in a materi
al manner. The work necessary to
put the grounds in shape would cost
several hundred dollars. The directors
work on contributed funds and these
funds arc limited. The work possible
for the student body to do would thus
save money which could be used for
other purposes. At the same time,
the students would be doing an act
which is in furtherance of a purely
Stanford undertaking and one which
everyone realizes is a worthy one.
The Memorial Plan
The third step in the plan is to
make the ground and residence a me
morial to the Stanfords. It was one
of Mrs. Stanford's wishes that the
residence should be used for some
such purpose as was made possible
today. Nothing, then, could be more
appropriate than the use to which it
is to be put and the dedication as a
memorial.
It is not exactly accurate to say the
residence has been made available for
the purpose outlined, for the Stanford
residence proper was destroyed by the
earthquake. The building which will
be used for the children's liome is
the servants' quarters, but it is all
that remains in the building line of
what was formerly the Stanford resi
dence.
It is a large building, however, and
at least thirty children can easily be
