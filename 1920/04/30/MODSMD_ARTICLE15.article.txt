# GALLI-CURCI GIVES PLEASING RECITAL
## Artist's Superb Voice Carries Bird-Like Joy to Audience 
### Adelheid Saier, '22 
When Amelita Galli-Curci sang her
first notes last night in the Stanford
Assembly Hall, everyone thought she
had a wonderful voice, but before she
had ended the number her cheery ex
pression of bird-like joy was almost too
beautiful to be human. We applauded,
but awe seemed to have carried away
the strength of applause.
Her second number, "Come per me
screna," from "Sonnambula," was the
winning selection of the evening. Her
interpretation of the coloratura motives,
with the unparallcd control of her voice
pave her the power to modulate from
the strongest of crescendos to the soft
est of diminuendos on the highest of
trills.
Two numbers with the flute accom
paniment lent variety and portrayed
more clearly the qualities of her voice.
The fact that the flute and voice blended
so beautifully and perfectly that it was
very hard to distinguish them Proved her
voice to be without a flaw. But, though
•he flute was sweet, and equally as joy
ous as the voice, it brought out the con
trasting perfection of the tones of Galli-
Curci which were directly controllable
by the artist and which were never shrill
nnr lacking in their finished power of
liding from the highest note to the
lowest.
flannel Berengucr, the flutist, and
Homer Samuels, pianist, are both worthy
of a corresponding amount of praise.
The pulse which seemed to beat in the
souls of the three during their ensemble
numbers brought perfect rythm with the
softest, sweetest, and clearest tones.
The sincerity with which Mine. Galli-
Curci sang as encores the distinctly
American numbers, "The Swance River."
and "Loves Old Sweet Song." was proof
that though foreign by birth, she appre
ciates the disposition of the American
who enjoys most to hear familiar songs
rendered by the greatest of artists.
The little bluebird, synonymous of
happiness, was indeed personified in
Mine. Galli-Curci as this little woman
trilled and sent her clear voice heaven
ward in the interpretation of her num
bers.
