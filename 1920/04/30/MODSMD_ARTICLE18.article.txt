# HOOVER AND CAMPAIGN METHODS
## 
### 
ipODAY'S edition of the "Chronicle" warns "the people" against "Hoover's
* whispering squad." The charges made against the Hoover campaign
directors in San Francisco are of a religious nature and although averse to
using religion in a political campaign, the Chronicle makes the most of its
opportunity and plays up to the religious mind of its readers. In any case,
however, the point in hand is that such publicity is a direct attempt to con
fuse political issues in the minds of newspaper readers.
The attack against the Hoover campaign misses the mark in that no
presidential candidate could possibly be in a position to control such petty
actions as an attack upon the authenticity of Johnson's masonic emblem and
the nature of Mrs. Johnson's religious beliefs. The fact that the Johnson
supporters would take any note of such petty play ought to warn newspaper
readers against taking any stock in the Johnson attack against Hoover.
On the other hand, a presidential candidate has the power to control
the broader and more important facts used in a campaign which strike at the
fundamental and basic points of character or vital issues of a campaign plat
form. To this end, the words of President Barrows of the University of Cali
fornia, a Johnson admirer, come to mind. His scorn of the cheap propaganda
used in the Johnson campaign against Hoover makes the petty charges against
the "Hoover whispering squad" seem paltry and ridiculous. The Johnson
campaign struck at a fundamental issueâ€”Herbert Hoover's Americanism so
that men even within the Johnson ranks stood up and denied the slander.
Campaign methods and presidential candidates are two different things
which should not be confused. In the broader and general aspects of the
campaign, the presidential candidate can be judged but he can in no way be
held responsible for the cheaper, insignificant and often unpleasant side of a
campaign. The sensationalism of the Johnson machine has been apparent
and in contrast the clean, conservative methods of the opposing faction have
been characteristic of Hoover. It is to be regretted that the San Francisco
publicity has had to descend to rank mudflinging.
