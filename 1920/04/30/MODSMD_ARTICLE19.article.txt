"The Children of California Shall be Our Children."
IN keeping with the spirit of the founding of the University comes the an
* nouncement that the Lane Clinic Convalescent Home will take over the old
Stanford residence for the children from San Francisco. After fifteen years
the home of the Stanfords has come back to the University and it is par
ticularly appropriate that the Board of Trustees should allow the residence
to be used for the convalescent children.
During the time the home has been under lease, the grounds have ap
preciably deteriorated. It is proposed that the students of the campus be
given an opportunity, as a memorial to the Stanfords, to clean up the grounds
and make possible the taking over of the house. It is probable that the
University will declare a holiday to be known as "Labor Day"in which all
the students of the campus will devote that time to working on the grounds
and putting the house into condition.
Some such plan has been inaugurated in several universities in estab
lishing philanthropic work which is distinctly a part of the university. In
this respect Stanford is unusually fortunate. The Stanford Clinics in San
Francisco send down the children and the students of Stanford will be
willing to work for them. The opportunity has come to the men and women
of Stanford and it is to be hoped that we will be given the opportunity to pay
this marked tribute to Senator and Mrs. Stanford.
