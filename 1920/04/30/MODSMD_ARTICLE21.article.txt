# TRACK MEET WITH O.C. IS CANCELLED
## Injured Men on Squad is the Cause For Calling Off Annual Contest 
### 
With Kirksey, Templeton, Westwick, I
Wilcox, and Green suffering from in- !
juries, the dual track meet which was
scheduled to take place between the
Olympic Club of San Francisco and the j
varsity tomorrow has been called off, j
Coach Maloney deeming it advisable to
let these men have a longer layoff before
engaging in active competition, as fur
ther injuries at this time would greatly
affect the team in the coming meet with
the Oregon Aggies and in the Pacific
Coast Conference.
The Aggie meet, which takes place a
week from Saturday, should be a closely
contested affair, and it will serve as a
final preparation for the second of the
"big" meets of the year, the Conference,
which will be held here on May 15.
Coach Maloney has high hones of cap
turing the Conference title this \var. In |
1919 California won with 53 1-2 points, |
with Stanford second w.tli 38. It is j
doubtful, however, if the winning team
this year will accumulate over 45 points
as the competition will be keener. With
Kirksey, Templeton, Westwick, Green,
and Wilcox entered along with Captain
Wells, llanner, Weaver, Scofield, Lilly,
Gillespie, Eddleman and Adams, it seems
almost certain that the Cardinal men
can gather the sufficient number of
points to win.
In the Conference four places are
counted while only three places will be
allowed in the Aggie meet.
