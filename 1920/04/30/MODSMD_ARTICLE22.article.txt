campaign will start Monday, and the
campus officials of the drive expect to
raise the entire quota within three days.
Celluloid buttons will be sold on the
Quad and in the various living groups < n
the campus, and in this way the com
mittee in charge expects to receive a
contribution from everyone on the cam
pus.
Alumni have promised to equal all con
tributions from everyone on the campus.
Alumni have promised to equal all
contributions from the campus, accord
ing to R. A. Martinsen, '21 in charge
of the campaign on the campus, and the
San Francisco Stanford Club is actively
interested in sending the team abroad.
It is important that Stanford supports
the campaign, for the majority of the
men on the squad are from Stanford,
and the Union is anxiously awaiting re
sults from the campus.
President Wilbur, Professor Murrav'
and Doctor Angell are actively inter
ested in the movement, which the Rugbv
Union feels will bring Stanford more
publicity than any other one movement
since the famous Poughkcepsie regatta.
