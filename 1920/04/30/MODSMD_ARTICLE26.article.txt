# RELIGION SHOULD BE ON PLANE WITH SPORTS, SAYS ROTH
## Discussion Groups Will Try to Bring About This End 
### 
A large number of men from the
halls, the Row, and Palo Alto met at
Encina this week and laid plans for
the part the campus men are to play
in the establishment of religious dis
cussions as a permanent feature of
student activity here. The desirablitiy
of promoting the religious side of stu
dent life is being felt to an increasing
degree, the organizers say, and they
hope that the discussion units being
organized in Memorial Church will
prove useful in helping bring about
this enu.
Comptroller A. E. Roth was present
to t ncourage the project.
He finds the same tendency, he says,
to become engrossed in one phase of
college life to the exclusion of other
thing's worth, existing 011 the Campus
now as it did in the earlier days of
the University, although to a dimin
ished degree. Roth suggests that the
state of affairs to be desired is one
where it is recognized that things re
lig'ous have a significant place along
with athletics and other objects of
rve""-f , ay ctudent interest, 110 one
activity -lourishing to the exclusion of
another.
Stanford students, he thinks, are not
obliged to choose between participa
tion in Christian activity and other
work but are privileged to co-ordinate
the two in order to make the most of
a college career. He has found it to
be one of the common regrets of many
of the alumni that they denied them
selves the associations that are pos
sible where college people meet to
exchange ideas 011 vital topics.
Sunday morning at 10 o'clock the
discussion units will be organized in
the west trancept of the Memorial
Church. One will be under the direc
tion of Professor E. G. Martin of the
Department of Physiology while the
other will be headed by Dr. Murray of
the Greek Department.
The group under Professor Martin
will investigate the idea and concep
tion of God as developed from earliest
recorded time. Professor Martin's
viewpoint is that of the scientist and
to many this fact has added interest
In the discussions that are to follow.
Dr. Murray's group will debate the po
sition and mission of St. Paul. Both
men have outlined the proposed trend
of the discussions as thus far planned.
Absolute freedom in the expression
of ideas is allowed during the Sun
day morning hour and men and women
of all shades of religious belief are
web omc-d and urged to attend by these
in charge. Each class starts at 10
o'clock and ends promptly at 10:45.
