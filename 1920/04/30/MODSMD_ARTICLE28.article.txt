### Frederick Ely 
What has Herbert Hoover ever done
for union labor?
What are Herbert Hoover's views
on the issues of vital importance to
organized labor?
What is Herbert Hoover's attitude
toward organized labor?
These questions are being asked by
thousands of trade unionists of Cali
fornia who, under 110 circumstances,
will vote for Hiram Johnson for Presi
dent, and who are either supporting
Hoover or have about decided to sup
port Hoover for President providing
his labor record is satisfactory.
It is for the information of all such
and at the earnest and repeated re
quest from thousands of organized
"Eight hours a day is long enough
ing in the campaign to elect Herbert
Hoover the next President of the
United States that we publish the fol
lowing:
lu 1909, when Herbert Hoover was
employed as engineer in the Broken
Hills mine, where the miners were
working twelve hours a day, Hoover
compelled the directors ol' the mining
company to grant an eight-hour day
to the miners.
"Eight hours a day is long enough
for any man to work," said Hoover,
when the directors opposed his de
mands lor a shorter workday for the
men. Hoover put up a fight, and, as
usual, won out, and the miners got
the eight-hour day.
A. year later, when the miners want
ed a wage increase which the directors
were disinclined to grant and had
about decided 011 locking out the min
ers, Herbert Hoover, then a part own
er in the mining corporation, said:
"I'll have 110 part in a lockout. It
would be the murder of hundreds of
children." Again he won his fight for
tli miners.
Hoover believes in an equal chance
for all. Here is what ho says 011 that
subject: "The United States has been
for 150 years steadily developing a
social philosophy of its own; it is in
substance that tliero should be an
equality of opportunity —an equal
chance —to every citizen."
"The organization of workers to
better the conditions of labor is un
doubtedly a safeguard of equal op
portunity and in accordance with basic
principles The essence of combina
tion of workers is collective bargain
ing, and the recognition of the right
to combine cannot be separated from
the right to bargain collectively," says
Hoover.
Hoovet's position on the subject of
Oriental labor is in accord with that
of organized labor. On this subject
Hoover frays: "I want to protest
against the suggestion of the importa
tion of Oriental labor. That involves
a social problem. It involves the
amalgamation of races. I am opposed
to it."
Hoover has always taken a keen
interest in the welfare of children and
he "believes the attitude of a nation
toward child welfare will soon become
tli • tes f of its civilization." He also
stotes that "if we are to have healthy
people and a healthy government we
must start with healthy children." For
that reason Hoover is "absolutely op
posed to all forms of child labor." He
believes that "children should be
taken out of the mill, shop, mine and
factory and be allowed to attend
school and share in the pleasures that
mean so much to the average child."
"I could not vote with a party if it
were dominated by groups who seek

(From the San Francisco Bulletin)

to set aside our constitutional guaran
tee for free speech and free represen
tation," says Hoover.
Hoover has always been a warm
friend of the public school teachers.
He believes in universal education
and that every child r.hould have the
opportunity for education.
On the subject or compensation for
school teachers, Hoover says: "Our
tcachers have always heen paid less
than for similar abilities in commerce, j
We have no right to ar'-ept this sacri-j
fine on the part of the teachers. They ;
should be amply compensated for their
great work for humanity."
"I could not vote with a party if it i
were dominated by groups who hope!
to re-establish control of the Govern-1
mont icr profit and privilege," says j
Hoover.
'"I believe that the object of all
national economic policy must be to j
maintain and impiove the standards;
of living of the whole population,"
b. ys Hoover "I pon this enhanced
standard of living cnly can be higher
opportunities of life be built."
Hoover's definition of capital is as
follows: "Capital is nothing but the
savings of the nation represented by
tools of production and service,
whether it be land, homes, factories,
railways or stocks. Its managers are
laborers themselves."
Hoover is familiar with the work
ings of the great corporations. He
believes they should be controlled.
On this subject he says: "From a so
cial point of view, the moment the
corporations begin to dominate the
community, either in wages or prices
or production, or to prevent the
growth of competition, they are in
flagrant violation of the primary
principle of equality of opportunity."
He advocates legislation to prevent
such "violation."
Hoover has faith in American labor.
He says: "I am convinced that the
vast majority of American labor fun
damentally wishes to co-operate in
production and that that basis of good
will can be organized and the vitality
of production re-created."

Hoover the next President of the
United States that we publish the fol

lu 1909, when Herbert Hoover was
employed as engineer in the Broken
Hills mine, where the miners were
working twelve hours a day, Hoover
compelled the directors ol' the mining
company to grant an eight-hour day
to the miners.
"Eight hours a day is long enough
for any man to work," said Hoover,
when the directors opposed his de
mands lor a shorter workday for the
men. Hoover put up a fight, and, as
usual, won out, and the miners got
the eight-hour day.
A. year later, when the miners want
ed a wage increase which the directors
were disinclined to grant and had
about decided 011 locking out the min
ers, Herbert Hoover, then a part own
er in the mining corporation, said:
"I'll have 110 part in a lockout. It
would be the murder of hundreds of
children." Again he won his fight for
tli miners.
Hoover believes in an equal chance
for all. Here is what ho says 011 that
subject: "The United States has been
for 150 years steadily developing a
social philosophy of its own; it is in
substance that tliero should be an
equality of opportunity —an equal
chance —to every citizen."
"The organization of workers to
better the conditions of labor is un
doubtedly a safeguard of equal op
portunity and in accordance with basic
principles The essence of combina
tion of workers is collective bargain
ing, and the recognition of the right
to combine cannot be separated from
the right to bargain collectively," says
Hoover.
Hoovet's position on the subject of
Oriental labor is in accord with that
of organized labor. On this subject
Hoover frays: "I want to protest
against the suggestion of the importa
tion of Oriental labor. That involves
a social problem. It involves the
amalgamation of races. I am opposed
to it."
Hoover has always taken a keen
interest in the welfare of children and
he "believes the attitude of a nation
toward child welfare will soon become
tli • tes f of its civilization." He also
stotes that "if we are to have healthy
people and a healthy government we
must start with healthy children." For
that reason Hoover is "absolutely op
posed to all forms of child labor." He
believes that "children should be
taken out of the mill, shop, mine and
factory and be allowed to attend
school and share in the pleasures that
mean so much to the average child."
"I could not vote with a party if it
were dominated by groups who seek

(From the San Francisco Bulletin)

to set aside our constitutional guaran
tee for free speech and free represen
tation," says Hoover.
Hoover has always been a warm
friend of the public school teachers.
He believes in universal education
and that every child r.hould have the
opportunity for education.
On the subject or compensation for
school teachers, Hoover says: "Our
tcachers have always heen paid less
than for similar abilities in commerce, j
We have no right to ar'-ept this sacri-j
fine on the part of the teachers. They ;
should be amply compensated for their
great work for humanity."
"I could not vote with a party if it i
were dominated by groups who hope!
to re-establish control of the Govern-1
mont icr profit and privilege," says j
Hoover.

national economic policy must be to j
maintain and impiove the standards;
of living of the whole population,"
b. ys Hoover "I pon this enhanced
standard of living cnly can be higher
opportunities of life be built."
Hoover's definition of capital is as
follows: "Capital is nothing but the
savings of the nation represented by
tools of production and service,
whether it be land, homes, factories,
railways or stocks. Its managers are
laborers themselves."
Hoover is familiar with the work
ings of the great corporations. He
believes they should be controlled.
On this subject he says: "From a so
cial point of view, the moment the
corporations begin to dominate the
community, either in wages or prices
or production, or to prevent the
growth of competition, they are in
flagrant violation of the primary
principle of equality of opportunity."
He advocates legislation to prevent
such "violation."
Hoover has faith in American labor.
He says: "I am convinced that the
vast majority of American labor fun
damentally wishes to co-operate in
production and that that basis of good
will can be organized and the vitality
of production re-created."
