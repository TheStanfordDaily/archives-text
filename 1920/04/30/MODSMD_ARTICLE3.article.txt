# SIGMA CHI HURLER WHITEWASHES PHI KAPPA SIGMA TEAM
## 
### 
The Sigma Chi diamond artists
staged another smashing victory last
night when they knocked the Phi Kap
pa Sigma nine for a 10 to 0 score. Ncff,
on the mound for the Sigma Chi's,
again came through with a no-hit game,
lie has shown better in each game
played, and, according to Art Acker, has
one of the best pitching arms in the in
tramural leagues.
Encina Bull Pen put over the larrest
score of the day in the game with Se
quoia Second Floor. The Hull Pen took
a seven-run lead in the first frame and
gained steadily throughout the game,
until at the end the score stood 16 to 3
in their favor. V. Criss, '21. hurling
for the Hull Pen. worked steadily dur
ing the seven innings, and Fred Fehrcn,
'22, showed exceptional ability behind
the bat. The Hull Pen has won three
straight games and is now leading league
five. The game with the Chi Psi nine
on next Tuesday probably will decide
the championship of that league.
Kappa Sigma suffered a 6-to-0 white
wash at the bands of the Hrcaker nine.
"Dink" Templeton, pitching for the
Breakers, shut the Kappa Sigma stick
ers out from the start, and his hits aided
materially the score of the Breaker nine.
The Kappa Sigmas arc rated as one of
the best intramural teams, and their de
feat puts the Breakers up into a posi
tion to enter the finals of the interleague
games. The Breakers have a nine com
posed of practically all letter men in
some snort or other and will make a
strong bid for the intramural champion
ship of the University.
