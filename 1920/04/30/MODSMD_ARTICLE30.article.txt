###

pus store and at Crandall's in Palo
Alto. The seat sale for the opera will
be continued throughout the week un
til tliH night of the performance, Sat
urday, May 8.
Perhaps of all the leading ladies
who have appeared in local produc
tions this year. Miss Lorraine West,
'20, as Jane Sherwood in "A Leap Year
Leap," presents the most distinctly
original type. Miss West is a comedi
enne who has that rare power of sup
pression, which makes the fun that she
seems to be bubbling over with, all the
more irresistible. She puts over most
of the song hits of the show with the
clear bell-like soprano voice and her
rendition of "There's a Lover's Kiss
in Every Orange Blossom," is bound
to meet with unprecedented success.
The action all centers around her
part of Jane Sherwood. This poor
girl, in a moment of lapse, announces
that she is engaged to Jerry Roberts,
a man who she has never seen be
fore, and who to the best of her
knowledge never existed. The fun be
gins when a live man turns up and
claims this fictitious name as his own,
it having been given him by his par
ents around the time of his first birth
day. Roberts, however, has faked an
engagement also, and the complica
tions become hopelessly muddled when
the. two psuedo-fiancees meet. Frank
Bennett, '19, has the leading part of
Jerry Roberts.
