# Election Guards Are Assured Excitement
## 
### 
More election guards are needed for
next Tuesday. The call is for students
to be present and watch the counting of
the ballots in San Francisco. The city
is hotly agitated over the coming elec
tion, and trouble is expected. Volun
teers are asked to arrange to go in
groups of three or more. The Stan
ford Hoover Club will pay all expenses
of those serving as election guards.
They will leave the campus about 4
o'clock next Tuesday and will return on
the 1 o'clock train.
