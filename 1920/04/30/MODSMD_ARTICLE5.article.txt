# ACADEMIC COUNCIL TAKES FINAL ACTION
## Mathematic Requirement is Eliminated; Courses Are in Three Groups 
### 
The Academic Council last night
passed upon the final changes in the
instruction regulations which were
proposed by the Executive Committee
of the Council. That the entrance
requirements in mathematics be eli
minated was the most important re
commendation. The other changes
were slight modifications pertaining
to required courses. As the require
ment now stands the students course
for the first two years is distributed
over three general groups; (1), Lan
guige an literature, English and for
eign; (2) natural sciences and mathe
matics; (3) social sciences, including
history, political science, economics,
and philosophy. To the second group
by the action last night, has been ad
ded formative art, and to the third,
education and psychology.
Two more provisions were made con
cerning the authority of the major
departments; first, that any depart
ment may prescribe any prerequiste
for the first two years\hat it chooses,
and second, that the Committee which
is to have charge of the registration
of first and second-year students shall
each quarter find out the department
in which the student thinks himself
particularly interested, and send tne
student to that department for con
sultation. Other than this, the Com
mittee will handle all the first year
students.
The new provisions have been re
ferred to the Board of Trustees, and
will probably be passed upon today.
