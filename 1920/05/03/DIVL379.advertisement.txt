A businesslike Answer to
a businesslike Question
THIRTY denominations cooperating in the Inter
church World Movement have budgeted their
needs. No business could have done it more scientifi
cally.
They have united to prevent the possibility of duplica
tion or waste. -At least a million dollars wiil be saved
by the fact that thirty individual campaigns are joined
in one united effort.
Each denomination has arranged its budget under six
mam heads:
I FOR THE CHURCH'S WORK
U AT HOME. A score ofitemscome
under this head. Coieider only one.
Five anrl a half million people in the
United Stales cannot even read and
write the English language. Who i3
to carry forward this vnst work of
Americanization if the church does
not?
A FOR RELIGIOUS TRAINING. At
ff least 12,000,000 children and young
people under 25 year# of a»e are en
tering American life without any
religiGUStrniniftg at all. Remember
ing the faith oi Washington and
Lincoln, do you think that America
will continue 10 produce Washing
tons and Lincolns if faith dies out
of the hearts of its youth?
7 FORHOSPITALS AND HOMES.
** Every yearthoussndsof menand
women seriou.il yillareturnedaway
from Church hospitals because of
lack of room. The children's homes
are compelled to turn away iTiore
children than they can receive.
5 FOR THE CHURCH'S WORK
ABROAD. Influenza came first
from the Orient thirty years ago;
nearly all plagues are Oriental
plagues. So long as China has only
one physician t ) every 400,0C0 people
the Orient will continue to be a
menace. Solci.jj as one-third of the
babies of Inalia die before their sec
ond year our own babies are not
safe. A Christian doctor or teacher
sent abroad is working for America
ns truly as though he worked et
home.
T FOR HIGHER EDUCATION. Of
the 450,000 American students in
institutions of higher graile, one
half are in Institutions founded and
supports 1 by the Churches. Many of
these institutions have had no great
endowment campaigns, but thrir
needs «re jvst us pressing ns the
nee s of larger schools; nnd you
have or.t-r to read their list of alum
ni and alumnii" tomensurethe value
of their contribution to America.
6 PREACHERS' SALARIES! The
preacher is called the "lorgotten
man," ond well he may b». Eight
out of trn preachers are paid less
than $20 a week I
_..3ch denomination has its own detailed budget, and
will administer its own funds. Your pastor has copies
of the budget: examine them for ycurself. In the week of
April 25th-lVlay 2nd you will be given your opportunity
to help. You can do it with the full satisfaction of know
ing that every dollar cf your gilt has its pest assigned
to it in advance.
Every dollar for b ritcr Amcrica and a better world.
When your church calls cn you give—and give with
your heart as well as your pocket-bock.
