# SEAT SALE FOR OPERA WILL BE HELD TOMORROW
## Mystery Theme is Woven Into Plot of 21 Show Through Means of Unlucky Necklace 
### 
"Beware the Love of a Spaniard" is
the title of a specialty song that will
be sung by Lester Seib, '22, and Miss
Esther Flowers, '22, in a "Leap Year
Leap" next Saturday night. The two
have the roles of cabaret entertainers
who appear in the artist's studio scene
in the second agt. As Seib is coaching
the production, the only time that he will
come on the stage will be in this spe
cialty turn.
Tomorrow noon drawings will be held
for Junior Opera seats at Wilson's cam
pus store. They will immediately be on
sale there and will go on the market
in Palo Alto on Wednesday at Cran
dall's. For a while the opera manage
ment thought that it would break prece
dent and let the seats out "first come,
first served." They have changed their
minds, however, and the old system of
drawings will stand.
An element of mystery colors the plot
of "A Leap Year Leap" and much of
this intrigue centers around a certain
green-jade necklace. This necklace al
ways brings with it bad luck and also
a mysterious Hindu who is trying to
regain possession of it. As a conse
quence of this supernatural charm the
green necklace changes hands rapidly
during the course of the action. R. W.
Faville, '23, breathes the right amount
of mystery and suspense into the part
of the Hindu.
The name Blossom in the cast of
characters is misleading as far as giving
any information about the part. Blos
som is not the ingenus role, as one
might suspect, but instead it is a black
face comedy part played by Richard
Pershing, '21. Pershing is a gifted come
dian, and his work in negro dialect is
bound to make a distinct hit with Sat
urday's audience.
