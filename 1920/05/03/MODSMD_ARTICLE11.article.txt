## HERBERT HOOVER- THE FOREMOST AMERICAN 
### 
fTOMORROW sends a challenge to every thinking, intelligent man and woman
in California. The primaries are a direct appeal to each individual voter
although political machines concentrate their efforts in an attempt to destroy
individual thinking. Stanford men and women have even a keener interest
in tomorrow's election than other sections of the State in that the man who
has the backing of the more conservative and intellectual class of the nation
is a son of Stanford —Herbert Hoover. «
The League of Nations with definite reservations is an important prin
ciple in Hoover's platform. Repeated attacks have been made upon Hoover's
position on this question. Hoover has been termed "vacillating" but the
truth of the matter is that Hoover saw the American people turn down the
document which represented llie thought of the finest statesman the world
has today. Consequently he was forced to stand for anything which would
be a constructive beginning toward world peace. No one in the world knows
the horrors of war better than Herbert Hoover. No one feels that finer
stimulus of the war's idealism than Herbert Hoover and 110 one better com
bines this idealism with good, common, business sense than does Herbert
Hoover. Hoover refuses to tolerate the policy of snug isolation which is
flaunted before the American people under the term "Americanism" by those
sliort-visioned men and women who oppose the League.
In domestic affairs, Herbert Hoover would apply the principles of any
sane, successful American business man. Hoover backs a national budget
system, in his own words "a national budget system would provide for the
co-ordination of expenditure, the prevention of waste, the expedition of legis
lation and the 'exposure' of the pork barrel."
Hoover would settle the Treaty question as the first step in the solu
tion of our domestic problems, "such as the size of armament, reduction in
taxation, and the prevention of agricultural and industrial depression and con
sequent unemployment, which is dependent upon stability abroad and upon
our access to the world's markets which today are endangered by discrimina
tion against us through our inability to exercise our vote under the treaty."
Hoover believes in co-operation between capital and labor. He recog
nizes the good of trade unionism organization and believes in the control of
corporations, at the same time recognizing the possibilities of the larger
corporation unit. He opposes socialism and the red flag but takes into account
the human element in productivity: Hoover has the economic knowledge es
sential to a solution of the High Cost of Living. The gigantic war inflation
of credit and speculation are direct factors in liigli prices and Hoover is
the man to find the economic solution of the problem.
Hoover stands for more than the mere political plans of his platform
would indicate. He has shown the United States, he has shown the world
what farsighted vision really is. He has proved himself a man of almost un
canny sagacity. He has demonstrated the practical application of his prin
ciples and there isn't another man in the United States who can offer a record
of achievement which can approach that of Herbert Hoover's. Hoover is a
business success, an engineer, an economist, a statesman, a leader of national
thought. He is thoroughly American, modest, sagacious, loyal, worthy of
the fine spirit of Stanford, but even more worthy of the loyal backing of
every honest American.
