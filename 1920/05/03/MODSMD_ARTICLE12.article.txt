### 
"If the American people understood
what Herbert Hoover was doing in En
rope they would raise a monument to
him," said Dr. Jordan Friday night, in
quoting a statement of Will Irwin's of
1915. "The time has come for the erec
tion of that monument," continued the
Chancellor Emeritus. "I want to rase
a monument to him next to Lafayette
Square by giving him the White House
to live in."
"The opportunity for service is the
only form of memorial that Hoover
would care about and would best rellcct
the appreciation of this country for his
many services.
"Hoover is the greatest in caliber of
all living men. The plight and needs of
Europe show that Hoover is the only
man who can save Europe, and if we
cannot save Europe we cannot save our
selves.
"Hoover's ability to co-operate and

work with people is a factor that can
not be overlooked at this time. The
chief executive's work is now too large
a task for any single man to accomplish
b<- playing a lone game." Dr. Jordan
indicated that a deadlock between the de
partments of the national government
such as the present would not occur
yvith a man of Hoover's type in the pres
ident's office.
In considering the type of man need
ed because of the insecure position of
European nations today, Dr. Jordan
stated that Lloyd George is subject to
European bankers, and Clcmenceau, al
though able, is discredited in his own
country. Wilson has lost prestige be
cause of failure to get the treaty
through. Dr, Jordan believes, therefore,
that it is necessary for America to fur
nish a man capable of the confidence,
co-operation, and leadership of the
world.
