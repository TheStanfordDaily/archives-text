# REGISTRATION IS IMMATERIAL TOMORROW
## Any Voter May Call for Republican Ballot HOOVER STRENGTH GROWS IN STATE; JOHNSON'S WANES Campus Politicians Give Talks in San Francisco in Support of Hoover's Primary Race

Party registration makes absolutely
no difference in the California primary
election tomorrow.
This is the important fact that the
backers of Herbert Hoover have for the
past several days been calling to the
attention of the voters. Regardless of
the voter's registration, he is entitled to
call for the official Republican ballot, on
which appears the names of the dele
gates pledged to support Hoover at the
Chicago convention.
There appears to be considerable con
fusion regarding the rights of the voter.
Certain newspapers have added to this
confusion by appearing to make a sim
ple task seem intricate.
Here are things to remember:
1. Democrats who favor Hoover in
spite of their registration as Democrats
can ask for a Republican ballot at the
election booth. Party registration makes
absolutely no difference.
2. Splitting of tickets is permissable.
The voter should remember that he is
not only stating a presidential prefer
ence, as in some eastern elections, but is
sending to Chicago a list of delegates
who will not only have a voice in the
nomination of the President, but in the
writing of the platform.
3. A voter is entitled to select twenty
six delegates.
4. There is no need for confusion. A
careful study of the ballot is advised
when the delegates are being chosen.
5. The entire twenty-six delegates
pledged to Hoover may be voted for by
simply stamping the cross in the square
designated on the ballot for that pur
pose.
Reports from the Hoover Republican
Club of California in San Francisco are
to the cffect that the bay city is swing
ing into the Hoover lists. For the past
week the club lias been sending speak
ers to various sections of the city. Im
promptu talks have been made to crowds
in various parts and some of these have
been made by Stanford speakers. J. G.
Driscoll, '18, and H. F. Blote, '19, have
been the representative of Stanford in
this work, which, it is declared, has met
with excellent results.
Tt is expected that the vote tomorrow
will lie one of the largest ever counted
in California.
