# A 						PRACTICAL MEMORIAL
## 
### 
rjIHE first of this series of three lectures known as the Raymond Fred West
Memorial Lectures, will be given tomorrow night in the Little Theater.
These lectures were established as a memorial to Raymond Fred West of
Seattle who was drowned before he completed his course at Stanford some
years ago. As a memorial, his parents gave $10,000 to the University for
the series of lectures such as have been established at many eastern uni
versities.
Dr. Henry Osborn Taylor of New York City will deliver the three lectures.
Although these lectures in the past have almost exclusively been delivered by
members of the clergy, this year marks a distinct departure. For Stanford
men and women who enjoy anything of an intellectual nature, the lecture
should prove a distinct treat. Dr. Taylor is well known as a scholar and an
interesting lecturer. Such a memorial is of practical value and will be ap
preciated by many people in this community.
Practical memorials have long been in the minds of the Stanford com
munity since plans have been under way for our own War Memorial Fund.
Our attention is called to the announcement of a series of lectures which were
established as a memorial at Stanford. They are delivered every two years at
the University by outside men on the general subject of "Immortality, Human
Conduct, and Human Destiny."
