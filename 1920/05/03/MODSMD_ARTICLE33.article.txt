# WESTERN COACHES WILL ASSEMBLE AT STANFORD MAY 14
## Football Plan and Training Tables to be Subject of Conference 
### 
A special session of the Pacific Coast
Conference to~be held at Stanford the
afternoon of May 14 has been called
by. Dr. A. D. Browne, Stan
ford's Physical Director, who was elect
ed President of the Conference af the
Seattle meeting in December, believes
that there are a number of questions be
fore the coast colleges that require im
mediate attention. The conference will
be held in conjunction with the Pacific
Coast Conference track meet, which will
be conducted on the local oval May 14
and 15. A coach, graduate manager,
and faculty representative will be in at
tendance from each of the following
universities: Stanford University, Uni
versity of California, University of
Washington, University of Oregon,
Washington State College, and Oregon
Agricultural College.
The question, which gave rise to much
discussion last year relative to the finan
cial arrangements at football games, will
be considered at the session. The exact
method by which the subject will be
dealt with has not been announced, but
assurance is given that a satisfactory
settlement will be made by the delegates.
The question of training tables will be
reopened at the May Conference. Ah
effort was made at the Seattle meeting
by the northern universities to entirely
eliminate training tables. 1 lie example
of the eastern colleges in abolishing the
tables and the recommendation of the
National Intercollegiate Conference, it
was argued, should lie followed by the
coast universities. The compromise de
cision of the December conference in
allowing but one meal a day, the evening
dinner, at the table has been since con
sidered unsatisfactory.
Coaches, in relation to university ath
letic policy, will 'form an important
topic for debate. An effort will be made
to eliminate the employment of profes
sional coaches whose only connection
with the college is for a season's work
on the field. The national conference
recently advised against the casual hir
ing of professional men and recommend
ed the full-time employment of coaches
under the control of the school adminis
tration. This is the policy in vogue at
Stanford and will be supported by her
representatives at the conference.
A banquet for the delegates will lie
tendered by Stanford in the evening fol
lowing the conference. The Stanford
Union, Dr. Browne announces, probably
will be chosen both for the conference
room of the delegates and for the eve
ning banquet.
