# HOOVER OUTLINES HIS VIEWS ON ISSUES TO COME BEFORE G.O.P.
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, May 3.—Herbert
Hoover has given to the public his
first comprehensive statement on the
issues to come before the Republican
convention in June. Hoover's state
ment, made at the request of a lead
ing New York newspaper, is a clear
definition of the issues that confront
the people of America and that logic
ally ought to be commanding issues
in framing the platform of the Repub
lican party.
The former Food Administrator re
marks that the party platform will
doubtless be contructed around two
tlietnes —first, the party view as to
the many measures before the coun
try —and, second, the less tangible,
"but of even greater importance, the
ideals that the party will represent."
"Not since 1860" declares Hoover,
"ha.-i there been such a looseness of
party ties, such a lack of confidence in
party machinery and party methods,
such a scrutiny and searching of par
ties, of their promises and of their
pui poses."
As high spots, he declares that the

League of Nations will come before all
party conventions in some form; he
speaks of the necessity for business re
organization, of federal administration,
a national budget readjustment of
taxation, reduction of the cost of liv
ing, suppression of profiteering, better
ment of agricultural industry, better
distribution between capital and labor,
an American merchant marine, and
the improvement of water-ways; these
are among other important considera
tions mentioned as vital to the coun
try.
"The great ranks of our people are
neither radical nor reactionary," he
says. "Their ideal is individual liber
ty, the protection and stimulation of
individual initiative under the Amer
ican condition that there shall be equal
opportunity for all."
After discussing the various issues,
Hoover declares that the present is
the "great opportunity of the Republi
can party, the opportunity to demon
strate that it is the party of the peo
ple, that it is the party of great and
positive ideals and of a dfinitely con
structive realism."
