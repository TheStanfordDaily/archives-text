# TEXT OF HOOVER'S STATEMENT

### 
Hoover's statement is as follows:
"I am in receipt of your request for
a statement of what I consider to be
the most important issues before the
Republican Convention. The platform
will doubtless be constructed about
two general themes, first, the party
view as to the many measures before
the country, second, the less tangible
but of even greater importance, the
ideals that the party will represent.
Never before has it been to important
tha ttlxe party should convey its po
sition in these matters to the public
through definite and positive proposals,
in order that conviction may be given
not only of sincerity but in demonstra
tion of the vital necessity of the party
itself to the nation.
"The war has stirred our old con
cept of moral and economic issues;
It lias created anxious distrust of the
old methods and has raised a complex
of new visions. Not since IB6o' has
there been such a looseness of party
ties, such a lack of confidence in party
machinery and methods, such a scru
tiny and searching of parties, of their
promises and of their purposes. Our
people are groping for something far
greater than election platitudes.
"A discussion of the many issues
could not be set out in the space of
a newspaper article, for such state
ments are valueless unless they em
brace specific,, direct,., constructive
methods of solution, n fact, all of the
different party piatforms will urge
som? form of a League of Nations, a
business reorganization of Federal ad
ministration, an economy in govern
ment, a national budget readjust
ment of taxation, reduction of cost of
living, suppression of profiteering,
betterment of agricultural industry,
improved relations between capital and
labor, better distribution of wealth, an
American Merchant marine, mainten
ance of civil liberty, extension of edu
cation, improvement of water-ways,
and many other items.
"I am for all these things, but I wish
to call attention to the fact that they
will be put forward in every party;
that even the Socialists on one ex
treme or the groups frankly in favor
of special interest on the other ex
treme could also conscientiously adopt
this same favorable attitude. There
fore, tlie Republican Party must do
something more than enumerate is
sues they favor. This is not only vital
to the party, but as I will mention
more particularly later on, it is funda
mental for the working of our dem
ocracy to give confidence to the values
of party government.
"The people will value a platform
as a high purpose if it is tangible and
definite in the proposals for solution
of its items. For instance, it is not
enough to denounce profiteering; a
statement ( of the specific economic
steps by which the rise in prices must
be checked and equilibrium is restored
is required. Profiteering justifies
great deunuciation but constructive
steps do not lend themselves to ora
torical presentation. They involve
such dull things as reduction in in
flation, readjustment of taxation, better
distribution through organization of
the agricultural industry, better trans
portation, the practical reduction of
losses and margins and risks between
producers and consumers. Above all,
the problem involves an understanding
that profiteering is the effect, not the
cause, that the solution must be econ
omic, and that the attorney general's
policemen cannot overtake an eco->
nomic force allowed to run out in the
country.
"Rut there is in infintely deeper
movement of the waters than that to
be stirred by putting afloat in the
program even so specifically (level
oped solution of issues. Our people
are only secondarily interested in the
remedies and adjustments which all
sides will promise to promote. It is
not alone the solution of today's is
sues, but a necessity to command
faith of right solution of the new
problems that may confront us tomor
row. They are craving for a demon
stration of the moral, social, and eco
nomic ideals that, are to dominate the
solutions of these questions. They
want, a touchstone by which all mea
sures be caught forward may be pub

licly tested and upon the execution
of which they shall be judged. No
greater mistake can be mode than the
assumption that our people have lost
their national aspirations and idealism
because they have gone back to busi
ness. In defining these great stan
dards, the party must reach into the
aspirations of our people and into the
social philosophy upon which our na
tional life is founded.
"Our people have an ideal of world
service. It was not a passing favor in
which we made the sacrifices of the
past three years for the great ideal of
the prevention of war and for the free
dom of the oppressed. It is now a
dozen years since Republican leaders
—including Roosevelt—first proposed
a league. This ideal cannot be ignored
by the party. Its living force will in
sist upon our joining in the organi
zation of the moral forces of the world,
to reduce armament, check militarism,
and relieve oppression. Our people
do not desire to see us pledged to use
force in there purposes; furthermore,
they have no more sympathy with the
growth of militarism at home than
abroad. They will be faced with this
growth and its cost if we insist on an
isolation that we cannot maintain.
Failure to support the League of Na
tions, with proper reservations, would
be a shock to the spiritual aspirations
of the American people.
"In the ideals and standards to be
applied to our economic problems the
Republican party must enunciate a
social ideal that does not tolerate
either socialism or the centralization
of wealth and the domination of capi
tal. The great ranks of our peopde
are neither redical nor reactionary.
Their ideal is individual liberty, the
protection and stimulation of individu
al initiative under the American con
dition that there shall be equal op
portunity to all. They comprehend
that the whole mass can progress in
its moral, intellectual, and physical
standards only through the progress
of each individual. Their ideal is
that we can only secure this by main
tenance of equality of opportunity to
each and every man and woman to
take the Niche in our community to
which their abilities and character en
title them. They realize that this is
'he only protection from frozen class
barriers; either on one hand of the
class domination of reaction or on
the other of the stifling bureaucratic
domination of socialism. They under
stand full well that the domination of
any individual or any interest is a
negation of our real national faith.
They believe that such domination is
going on today and they want cor
rection of it.
"They recognize that the starting
point and safeguards of these ideals
is education. There cannot be equali
ty of opportunity without an absolute
ly equal opportunity for physical devel
opment and education of the children
of the poor and the bettr-to-do alike.
Furthermore education and the work
ing of public conscience of our com
munity in safeguard of these ideals
comprises the freedom of the press,
of assembly and of spech on a pre
war footing to advancement of ideas
through the ballot box to trial by jury.
One would have thought that these
latter liberties were so commonplace a
part of American life as to require
no pledge of abandonment of powers
granted out of military necessity but
the events of the past year prove
otherwise.
"Nor are liberal ideals alone suffici
ent. ours is a practical people to whom
ideals furnish the theory of political
action upon which they want not only
firm assurance but also effective prac
tice. They want programmes but they
want action to flow from them. They
want constructive sense. They want
the development of the common will,
not the views of a. single individual.
They are beginning to realize that
words without action are the assassins
of idealism. On the other side they
are equally disgusted with seeking
for power by destructive criticism
demagoguery specious promises and
sham.
"The maintenance of political parti
es is vital to the functioning of our
democracy and it is therefore a na

tional duty to inspire faith and con
fidence in party government. It is
perhaps an elemntal statement to say
that democracy cannot be government
of one man or group of men it is a
government by and for the pople and
a people can only express the will of
the majority through organized po
litical parties. Moreover, in our form
of government it is only by party
team work that the legislative and
administrative branches of the gov
ernment can be co-ordinated to exe
cute the will of the majority. It fol
lows also that we cannot carry on this
government successfully if we have
numerous conflicting groups. If our
party disintegrates (his disintegration
will undermine majority rule and it
will endanger us with minority rule
through logrolling for a balance of
power.
"This is therefore the great oppor
tunity of the Republican party. The
opportunity to demonstrate again that
it is a party of the people, that it is
a party of great, and positive ideals
and of definitely constructive realism.
It is only by the faith in those ideals
that it can maintain its potency and
secure and maintain Its ascendency
in the community. With the realiza
tion of this it will perform that service
in the expression of the will of the
majority for which a political party
is the most efficient instrument of
democracy."
