# STANFORD ENGINEERS PLAN AFFILIATION
## National Organization Will Have Junior Branch at Stanford 
### 
Plans for making the local Civil
Engineering society a junior branch
of the American Society of Civil Engi
neers are being rapidly completed by
members of the local organization. At
a meeting of the society, which is
nation-wide, held in Chicago recently.
Professor C. D. Marx, head of the de
partment of civil engineering, repre
sented the local society of engineers.
With the support of other men Profes
sor Marx was Instrumental In having
an amendment passed to the effect that
student, or junior branches, of the
American Society of Civil Engineers
could be established in certain uni
versities and colleges of high stand
ing which desired such affiliation.
When Stanford's loval society be
comes a member of the national or
ganization it will be the first junior
division of the kind in the country,
and a great deal of credit is due Pro
fessor Marx and his supporters in se
curing such an honor for the school,
and especially those students who will
be directly affected.
Junior membership in the society
will carry with it many of the privil
eges which are accorded to the regular
members. Students will be permitted
to attend the meetings of the society
and will be in a position to secure ex
pert advice 011 subjects of an engi
neering nature. They will also be in
vited to all of the special addresses
and 011 all of the trips which are held
at different times under the auspices
of the society. In addition to these
benefits the local organization will
have the advantage of being able to
command more interest from the stu
dents, which means that closer co
operation and better work will result.
