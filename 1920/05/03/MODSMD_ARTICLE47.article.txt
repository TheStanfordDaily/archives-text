Lansing, former secretary of state in
President Wilson's cabinet, and dele
gate at the Paris Peace Conference,
has declared for Herbert C. Hoover.
His telegram to Ralph P. Merritt,
California campaign manager, follows:
"I feel that it is only a matter of
justice to denounce the outrageous and
false reports, which you informed me
are being circulated, concerning Her
bert Hoover's lack of Americanism.
Having been closely associated with
him for nearly six years, officially,
and unofficially, especially during the
peace negotiations, I know that there
is no man more loyal to this country
or more devoted to American ideals
and principles than he. His attitude
throughout has been consistent and
patriotic. I consider him an American

whereof I speak. When such inde

that it is a duty to refute them and
but rendering justice to one who has
served America faithfully and whole
