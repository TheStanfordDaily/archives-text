# PETERS ART EXHIBIT TO CLOSE TOMORROW
## 
### 
The exhibition of paintings by Charles
Rollo Peters at the Stanford Art Gallery
has attracted more attention than any
other one group shown this year. Tues
day is the last day of the showing of this
artist, who is considered the greatest
living painter of night scenes. Many
visitors have come from San Francisco
to see the collection, which is the largest
group of his works ever shown in one
gallery. The gallery was crowded all
Sunday afternoon with people from the
Peninsula, who expressed their delight
at being given an opportunity to see the
best in art through the University gal
leries.
