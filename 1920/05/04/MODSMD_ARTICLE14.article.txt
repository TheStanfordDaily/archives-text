# DOROTHY JOHNSTON PLAYS PROMINENT JUNIOR OPERA PART
## 
### 
A record sale following the ticket
drawing at Wilson's campus store today
pointed out the popularity of "A Leap
Year Leap," the 1921 Junior Opera that
will be produced in the Assembly Hall
next Saturday night. Seats for the
production will continue on sale until
the night of the production at Wilson's
campus store and at Crandall's in Palo
Alto.
Excellent male voices will characterize
"A Leap Year Leap." All of the men's
parts in the cast have been taken by a
combination of singers of unusual tal
ent for local .productions. The vocal
work of Frank Bennett, '19, in the re
cent Ram's Head show made him the
star of "Sin Sin," and partly on the
strength of that record he was given the
part of Jerry Roberts, the lead in "A
Leap Year Leap."
But Bennett has many other stage
qualifications besides his sympathetic
tenor voice. He is a splendid interpreter
of comedy roles and is an actor of un
limited poise and naturalness on the
stage. His part of Jerry Roberts re
quires all of this that lie has, because
of the many complications which that
character finds himself in during the
course of the operetta's action. He must
adapt himself to the puzzling predica
ment of being engaged to two women
at once, having an irate father to paci
fy, and a Hindu secret societv to dodge.
Jerry Roberts finally does all these
things, but not until the final curtain.
Howard Deems, '21, is carrying off the
part of Mr. Roberts, Jerry's father, with
a degree of maturity that is seldom
reached among local amateurs. His
deep, rich baritone allows him to put
over "Widows Are Wonderful" in a
manner that is sure to make that one of
the feature songs of the show.
Miss Dorothy Johnston, '21, is one of
the cleverest entertainers in the entire
cast. She is an experienced hand in
campus theatricals and is well known
for her talent as a dancer and a singer
of the lighter forms of popular melodies.
She has the part of Loraine Willard,
the female raisoneur in the plot.
A musical score of all the song hits
of "A Leap Year Leap" will go on sale
the night of the opera. The book will
contain songs and lyrics by D. B. Mac-
Boyle, '20. R. H. Sewel, '20, and C. M.
Midgley, '23. An advance sale of this
score will be conducted throughout the
campus tomorrow night. The price is
$1.25.
