# THETA DELTA CHI DEFEATS EL TORO NINE; SCORE 9-4
## 
### 
Theta Delta Chi walked over the El
Toro nine last night for a 9-to-4 beat
ing. "Snooze" Haley, on the mound
for the Theta Delts, held the El Toro
Club to no scores through the first five
innings and then let in three runs on a
walk and two good infield hits. This
rally looked like the El Toro team
was going to stage a come-back and
catch up with the seven-point lead of
the Theta Delts, but Arnett was caught
asleep on second and the luck of the
El Toros broke there. The El Toro
nine annexed another tallv in the sixth
frame, but were unable to catch the
Theta Delts, who chalked up two more
in the sixth. The game ended 9 to 4
for the Theta Delts.
Encina Fourth Floor nroved no match
for the strong D. K. E. nine and re
ceived a 10-to-0 whitewash. The Dekes
shifted their line-up and are working
better than they did in their first game
of the series.
The other three games of the after
noon were forfeits, being between clubs
that are already out of the running as
far as the finals go.
Games for tomorrow are: Japanese
Club vs. Delta Upsilon, Beta Theta Pi
vs. Sequoia Third Floor, Unattached vs.
Sigma Nu. and Alpha Sigma Phi vs.
Phi Kappa Psi.
