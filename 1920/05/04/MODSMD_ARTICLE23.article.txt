# DOING AWAY WITH FINALS

### 
EXAMINATION systems in many universities have been a subject of con
tention for both faculty and students. Columbia University has sub
stituted psychological tests in the place of entrance examinations and the
general opinion of educators seems to be swinging toward an elimination of
final examinations.
Many students in any university have the ability to photograph the
syllabus sheets of a course in their minds clearly enough so that they can
go into an examination and pass it with a good grade. If those same stu
dents were asked to retake that examination forty-eight hours later, they
would probably flunk the examination. In other words, under our present
system cramming gets by and most of us do cram for finals, and as soon as
the finals are over we try to forget all that we ever knew about the course
and most of us are successful without much effort.
Emphasis should be placed upon daily work. In the place of final ex
aminations it might be feasible to work out a weekly or bi-weekly system.
This would apply particularly to lecture courses. The professor conduct
ing the course would announce at the beginning of the course that he would
give one question on the first week's work. The second week, he would give
one question on any part of the first two weeks' work and so on. Such a
system, through constant reviewing, would impress the course upon the
minds of the student and the professor would have something else to judge
the student by than the mark he got in the final examination. In this system
final examinations would be eliminated entirely. Some such plan as this
would prove more satisfactory for both student and professor.
