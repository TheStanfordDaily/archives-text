# EVERYBODY OUT FOR A GOOD TIME

rpHE DAILY PALO ALTO always aims to serve the students of the Uni
* versity as far as it is able and in line with this policy it has taken over
the management of the arrangements for the returns of the primary election
this evening. The doors of the Assembly Hall will be opened promptly at
9:00 o'clock. Acknowledgements are due Coach Lester Seib and the Junior
Opera cast in calling this evening's rehearsal an hour early so that the Daily
Palo Alto could secure the use of the Assembly Hall this evening. On ac
count of the rehearsal, students are asked not to go to the Hall before 9.
Arrangements have been made with the United Press for service this
evening and tomorrow. For the later dispatches bulletins will be placed on
Quad for the campus public. The co-operation of the Palo Alto Times has
also been secured so that those interested in the returns may be as fully
informed as possible. An attractive program will fill in the time when re
turns are slow to come in so that according to present plans there shouldn't
be a dull moment during the evening.
Tonight's entertainment will be free to the campus public through the
generosity of the Hoover and Johnson-Republican Clubs who have agreed to
share the expenses with the Daily Palo Alto.
Election gatherings in the past have been particularly memorable on
account of the spontaneousness of the occasion. Impromptu entertainment
has been furnished in the past and we believe that tonight will be no ex
ception. Friendly rivalry will mark the evening and a general community
spirit which we seldom have the opportunity to foster.

IT is with great pleasure that the Daily Palo Alto announces the return of
W. F. Leiser, '21, to the staff. Leiser will re-assume his duties as news
editor. S. G. Wliittelsey, '20, who took Leiser's place, will continue as news
editor. The two regular inserts have necessitated the appointment of a
sixth news editor to keep up with the work which has come with the recent
expansion of the paper.

THE only time that "The Examiner" will ever agree with the Admin
istration will be when William Randolph Hearst is President. It remains
that "The Examiner" will always be opposed to the Administration.

THE first special dispatch to the Daily Palo Alto for the northern trip
of the baseball team has brought good news to the campus. Here's hoping
the team keeps up the good work.
