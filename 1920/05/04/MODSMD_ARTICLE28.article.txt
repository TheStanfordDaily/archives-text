# J.F. NEYLAN SPEAKS AT JOHNSON MEETING
## Mayor Rolph is Unable to Attend Rally Due to Slight Illness 
### 
J. F. Neylan, proprietor of the San
Francisco Call and one o£ the foremost
Johnson supporters in the state, spoke
in behalf of the senator's nomination
for the presidency last evening in the
Women's Clubhouse. The address was
given under the auspices of the local
Johnson Republican Club.
Neylan traced the career of Johnson
while governor, showing how the latter
had been able to guide the government
from a deficit in the treasury of $258,000
to a surplus of over $7,000,000 when he
left the gubernatorial chair. His work
in pushing forward child-labor laws and
the adoption of the Workingmen's Com
pensation was reviewed. Neylan spoke
of the need of a budget system to be
adopted in the national government sim
ilar to that adopted in California dur
ing Johnson's governorship.
Mayor Rolph, of San Francisco, who
was supposed to speak last evening, was
suffering from an attack of ptomaine
poisoning so that he was unable to make
the journey down the Peninsula.
An interesting part of last evening's
program was the address given by
Sergeant Robinson, from the Base Hos
pital in Palo Alto. Robinson stated that
the votes of over 75 Johnson supporters
detained at the Base Hospital had been
disqualified on the technicality that they
were not permanent residents of the
military hospital. He maintained that

the real reason for their disqualification
was that they were Johnson supporters.
Robinson, nicknamed "Soldier Bob" by
his comrades, closed with an appeal for
a return to an od-fashioned administra
tion with Johnson as the helmsman.
Nearly two hundred students and resi
dents of Palo Alto attended the meeting.
