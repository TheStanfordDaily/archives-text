# STANFORD TO SEND TRACK TEAM EAST FOR I.C.A.A.A.A.
## 
### 
Approval was given by the Board of
Athletic Control at its meeting last week
of the proposal to send a squad of Car
dinal track men to the Intercollegiate
4-A meet in Philadelphia this month.
The names of the men who will make
the eastern trip will be announced after
the Pacific Coast Conference meet, which
will be held on the local oval the 14th
and 15th of May. Not more than six
and probably only four will make the
transcontinental journey. Local sport
dopesters predict that Kirksey, Temple
ton, Wells, and Green are assured of a
berth on the squad. Hanner undoubtedly
would be selected, but the javelin is not
included on the events of the I. C. 4-A
meet.
A finance committee composed of
Coach Maloney, "Dink" Templeton, and
"Reg" Caughey, was named at the board
meeting to conduct a campaign to pay
the expenses of the trip. An estimate of
$1,200 was made by Maloney as the sum
necessary to finance the team.
Although the main eastern universi
ties will be represented by larger squads
than Stanford, the records of the Cardi
nal tracksters assure their placing in a
number of events. Coach Maloney is
placing his hopes on the fact that many
of the eastern squads will contain men
of inferior caliber, while the Stanford
squad will be picked men of proven
ability.
