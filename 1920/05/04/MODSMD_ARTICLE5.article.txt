# HEAVY VOTE IS CAST ON CAMPUS
## 
### 
An unusually heavy vote was cast
early in the day in the campus pre
cinct today. By 2 o'clock this after
noon 300 votes out of a total registra
tion of 442 had been checked off by
the Stanford election tellers. A large
majority of the voters have called for
Republican tickets. Keen interest and
heavy voting is reported from Pa'o
Alto precincts but no definite estimate
of the early vote has been made by
the city officials.
