Walter D. Powell, at present Director
of the Department of Physical Educa
tion at the Montana State College of
Agriculture, today telegraphed accept
ance of the offer of the position of
varsity athletic coach for the coming
year tendered him by the i.oard of Ath
letic Control at its meeting last Thurs
day evening. The new coach will assume
his duties at Stanford the lirst of next
September.
Six years of successful coaching of
Ifootball and basketball teams and proven
lability as a leader were the prime rea
/jsons which led to the selection of Powell.
/ "Without exception, all the reports con
/ cerning him by men who have in the
past been in a position to judge his
work have been strongly favorable. Wal
ter Camp, who was directly associated
with him for three years, recommended
Powell when .he was asked to suggest a
man for Stanford's selection. March 9
he telegraphed Dr. A. 1). Browne: "Re
gard* Powell! excellent ability and high
est character! Can recommend him."
For the past year Powell has been
in charge of athletics at the Montana
State College of Agriculture and Me
chanic Art at Boeman, Mont. His rec
ord there has been remarkably success
ful. By defeating the Montana State
University basketball team a few wccks
ago, Powell's basketeers scored their
thirteenth consecutive victory of the
season, which was closed without a sin
gle defeat. Not only did the Montana
"Aggies" five win the state championship
but the football, baseball, and track
squads under his training made notable
records during the past season. The
Anaconda State Journal recently said:
"Powell has established a reputation for
everything that is fair and square in
sports. The football and basketball teams
he lias turned out are best proof of his
ability in coaching."
An exceptional record as an athlete
was made by Powell while attending
the University of Wisconsin from 1910 to
1914. graduating from the university in
the latter year. His brilliant playing on
the football eleven of Wisconsin for the
1911—12—13 seasons led to his selection
as All-Western Center in 1912 when
Wisconsin won the championship of the
West. As a basketball player and wrest
ler, Powell represented Wisconsin in in
tercollegiate meets.
As coach of Western Reserve Univer
sity, Ohio, from 1914 to 1917, his foot
ball team defeated its competitors for
three .years in succession. The Ohio
state championship was won by Western
Reserve in 1915.
Powell volunteered for athletic work
on the entrance of the United States in
the war and was assigned to take charge
of the athletic activities at Camp Sher
man. Chillicothe, Ohio. Following a suc
cessful record at the training camp lie
was transferred to the naval department
and assigned to the sixth naval station
at Charleston. S. C. His superior offi
cer, Commander Charles Ellis, was first
opposed to Powell undertaking athletic
work at the station, but the nature and
success of the work soon led to the com
mander's emphatic approval. At the con
clusion of eighteen months' service at
Charleston, Ellis asked that Powell be
retained in the service and that he be
commissioned permanently as an officer.
The selection of the new coach was
made after careful consideration of a
large number of candidates. '1 he Board
of Athletic Control asked a number of
reliable experts to suggest the best man
for the position. The board selected the
best of seventy men proposed and again
made careful inquiry as to their qualifi
cations. From this narrovyed list the
best qualified men were asked to per
sonally visit Stanford in order that those
directing athletics here might confer
with the candidates. Powell recently
spent a couple of days on the campus,
greatly impressing the board as a high
caliber coach. The unqualified endorse
ment of Walter Camp had great weight
in making the selection. Mr. Camp
wrote that he had made the strongest
recommendation for Powell that he had
ever made for any coach.
The new coach will assume work at
Stanford at a salary of $3,5()0 a year.
An attractive offer was made by the
Montana State College to retain him,
but Powell felt that the opportunity for
broader work was open a Stanford and
accepted the position offered by the
Hoard of Athletic Control.
