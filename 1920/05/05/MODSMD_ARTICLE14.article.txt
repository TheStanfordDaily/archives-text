# SIGMA CHI CINCHES LEAD IN LEAGUE TWO
## 
### 
Sigma Chi upset the dope in League
2 yesterday, by beating the Phi Delts
sto 4. Phi Delta Theta and the Sigma
Chis have been piling up scores that
run into the twenties abainst the op
posing teams of the league and the
game yesterday was a battle from
start to finish. Neff, star hurler for
the Sigma Chis, allowed four runs
distributed over the seven innings of
the game. He was working perfectly
in the game yesterday and pitched a
steady ball for seven innings. Clark,
on the mound for the Phi Delts came
through the first live innings in his
usual good form but weakened in the
sixth. The Phi Delt let up and al
lowed five trips around the bags by
the Sigma Chis. This one inning
ended the scoring for the Sigma Chis.
The Phi Delt nine annexed one more
tally in the seventh inning but the
game ended with them on the short
end of the 5 to 4 score. Neff and
Brown were battery for the Sigma Chis
and Clark and Aubert for the Phi
Delts. Strike outs; by Neff 9, by
Clark 5.
Encina (second floor) and Phi Kappa
Sigma played a 10 to 10 game on the
rugby field. The game was replete
with thrills, mostly long hits and stel
lar plays, although all the streaks of
real ball were too far apart to cut
down the score enough to make the
game interesting. Neither team has
made much of a showing before but
last night they wei'e about evenly
matched and played as if the champi
onship of the university depended on
the outcime of the game.
Kappa Alpha romped over the third
floor of Encina to the tune of 9 to 0.
The K. A.'s were working better than
they have in any previous game and
the Encina team never had a prayer
from start to finish in the five innings.
Chi Psi forfeited to the Bull Pen
and Encina (fifth) and (basement) to
the Delta Chi nine. Delta Chi and the
El Toro team played a practice game.
