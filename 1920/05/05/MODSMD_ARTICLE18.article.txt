# NEW COACH
## 
### 
IT IS WITH CONSIDERABLE SATISFACTION that the student body will
receive the announcement that Walter Powell from Montana State College
will come to Stanford as the varsity coach to succeed Coach Evans. The
question of coach has hung fire in the student mind for a considerable period
of time and a settlement was awaited with considerable interest.
Powell comes to Stanford with the highest recommendations. A gradu
ate of Wisconsin in 1914, he played in the western all-star football team. He
knows the American game. Walter Camp stated that he had given Powell
the highest recommendation that he had ever given any man applying for
position as football coach. He was director of the Department of Physical
Education at Montana State College and is known for the success with which
he has been accorded since coming to that institution.
With such a record behind the new coach, Stanford can look forward
with some anticipation to the athletic season next fall. Co-operation between
students, faculty, and alumni, will prove to Powell that he has the backing
of the University and will make for the best possible results during the first
quarter of Powell's residence at Stanford. The athletic problems which have
faced the University during the last few months have for the most part been
solved and with the clearing of the atmosphere it is appropriate that every
body get behind Stanford's athletic wheel and push.
