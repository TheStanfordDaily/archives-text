# MASQUERS

### 
riIHE first announcement of the three one-act plays to be put on by Masquers,
May 27, was received with pleasure by those people on the campus who
know the former work of Masquers before the war brought about the dis
continuance of the organization. Masquers in previous years represented the
best dramatic talent which the women of the campus had to offer. The type
of work which was presented always ranked among the best of the dramatic
work of the University.
Tryouts for the three plays, which are of an exceptionally interesting
nature, will be held tomorrow, in the Little Theater. There are no limita
tions on those who wish to tryout as all members of the body are
invited. Masquers have certain difficulties to overcome in rebuilding their
prestige but from those who are sincerely interested in dramatics, the re
vival of Masquer activities will receive enthusiastic support.
