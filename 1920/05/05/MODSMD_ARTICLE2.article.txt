# CLEVER INTRIGUE TANGLES PLOT OF "LEAP YEAR LEAP"
## 
### 
In the part of Trixie the authors of
"A' Leap Year Leap" have created a
really sensational character. Trixie is
what one might call a professional fian
cee. During the action of the Junior
Opera plot this lively character spreads
her engagement announcements broad
cast and recalls them at will. What is
more, she does it in an engaging spirit
of recklessness that makes the part an
irresistible one.
Miss Frances Merrill, '22, plays this
breezy part in a dashing manner that
would excite the admiration of any audi
ence. Her light-hearted treatment of
this role and the element of charming
personality that shines through her han
dling casts a spell of joy over the stage
when she makes her appearance.
The operetta is crammed full of spark
ling lines, but the fun in the show al
most reaches its zenith when Trixie and
Tom get in the midst of their many
verbal battles that take place during
the production. It is always hard to
pick the winner in these major engage
ments of sarcasm. L. V. McDermott,
'17, a oopular favorite on the local
boards, plays this part of Tom with
a touch of savoir fairc that makes it
fascinating.
The seat sale is progressing beyond
the point that the opera management had
hoped would be reached at this stage
of the sale. However, many good places
are left, and are procurable at Wilson's
campus store and at Crandall's in Palo
Alto.
Three of the snappy songs contributed
to the Junior Opera by D. B. Mac-
Boyle, '20, were sung four years ago in
London at the Alhambra Music Hall.
They were immensely popular with the
London music hall audiences at the time
and are going unusually well in rehear
sal here.
Mac√üoyle has written several popular
songs during the past year, including
"Bring Back Those Wonderful Days"
and"I Love Y'ou All the More," both
of which are on Victor records. Of the
many songs which he has contributed to
"A Leap Year Leap," "Model Girls," a
lively chorus number, and "Dreaming,"
a waltz, should prove to be favorites Sat
urday night. Both of these will be pub
lished in the musical score of the 1921
opera.
