# RELIGIOUS BELIEF OF EARLY RACES TRACED BY TAYLOR
## 
### 
"Man's best hopes have paralleled his
conception of the divine," declared Dr.
Henry Osborn Taylor in the first of
the Raymond West Memorial Lectures
delivered last night in the Little The
ater. "While there is no end to na
ture's surprises or no bottom to its
working there are blind alleys of sci
ence and thought which lead to no
deflate conclusion. We are justified
in looking on all aspects of human
nature, not only the material but the
spiritual goals which ever beckon man
on to increased effort. I do not think
it simple or so brutal to believe that
history is the outcome of conflicting
human forces. An incomprehensible
power intervenes in our conduct, the
plan of God."
A detailed analysis of the forces
working for human progress was made
by Dr. Taylor. Inherited tendencies
are the foundation for the human will,
but a new factor, conscious intelli
gence enters to play a determining
part. Wilful choices made by the
mind of man when a degree of free
dom of thought has been attained are
the true means, indicated the speaker,
by which society progresses or retro
grades.
Man's evolution at first was as slow
as the geologic changes but with the
dawn of history he has advanced at a
quickening rate. The mastery of na
ture liberated the energies of man for
other than purely material purposes.
When his first thought was no longer
protection from the beasts or storms,
the lever of judgment and spiritual
impulse entered to make progress
more rapid.
Dr. Taylor sketched early thought
in its relation to religious impulses.
While his first conscious thought was
purely utiliterian, man soon sought to
make a religious scheme embracing
moral duties. The primitive Assyrian
and Egyptian religion was marked by
horrible fear and unthinking obees
sion to many gods. In time, a sense
of sin replica of the world, a place in
which the favored class of the earth
would be exulted.
Dr. Taylor will continue his sketch
fo the history of religious thought in
the second of the Memorial lectures
which will be delivered tonight in the
Little Theater at 8:00. "Contribu
tions of the People" is the announced
subject of tonight's lecture.
