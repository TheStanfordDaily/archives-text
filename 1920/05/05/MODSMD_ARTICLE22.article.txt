# Women's Crew Given Up For New Sport
## 
### 
Women's crew as a spring sport will
be abandoned as a result of a decision
made at a meeting of tbe Women's
Athletic Association held last night. The
lack of suitable shells to carry on the
sn< >rt is given as the reason for this
action.
ino Association decided to include
archery in the list of competitive sports
for Women's Field Day. Archery has
only been introduced at Stanford during
this quarter, so the tournaments will not
be started until the players have gained
sufficient skill to enter into comoetition.
