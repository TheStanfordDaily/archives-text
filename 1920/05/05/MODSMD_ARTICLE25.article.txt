# ORCHESTRA TO PLAY ON LAKE THURSDAY
## 
### 
The Committee on Public En
tertainment has declared Satur
day a University holiday on ac
count of Junior Day. The action
was taken at the request of the
Junior Class committees in charge
of the arrangements for Junior
Day.

All festivities which were to take
place Sunday of Junior Week have
ben changed to some other date as
shown by the program printed in the
Daily Palo Alto last evening. Music
will be furnished on the lake Thurs
day night, by a Hawiian Orchestra.
H. D. Marino, '20, is collecting the
various players of the tropical instru
ments and the whole orchestra will
be made up of local talent.
Lake sports which were scheduled

for Sunday afternoon have been
cnanged to Saturday afternoon. The
lake activities will be started at 2:30
p.m., and after this will be given an
informal "tea" dance at the Zeta Psi
house. Music will be furnished by J.
T. Reynolds' orchestra.
The "tea" dance is a new phase
in Junior week activities and its in
troduction is caused by unforeseen ob
stacles arising in the plans of the
class. Nevertheless it is expected to
be an excellent "filler" to take up the
time between the lake sports and the
opera, which is to start at 8:10 that
evening.
