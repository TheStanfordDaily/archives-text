# SIGN UP SHEETS READY FOR TENNIS
## 
### 
Sign-up sheets for the women's spring
tennis tournaments will remain open
until noon Friday to give all women who
are interested in the sport a chance to
enter. Drawings for the tournament
will lie made at 1 o'clock, and the
matches will begin next week.
All University women are eligible for
the tennis tournaments whether they are
in tennis classes or not, and Francis
Fish, '22, tennis manager, wishes to urge
a large number of women to come out.
A tennis tournament between Stan
ford and the University of Southern
California has been arranged for the
latter part of May, and the players for
these matches will be selected from the
winners of the local tournament. The
W. A. A. training rules will not apply
to tennis players.
