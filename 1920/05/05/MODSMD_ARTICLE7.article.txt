NEW YORK. May s.—Hoover
issued a statement here today in
which he expressed surorise that
"under the circumstances so
large a vote should have been
cast in California for the dele
gates favoring my nomination,
for my friends, in entering my
name, introduced no personal is
sue, hut asked an opportunity to
register a protest at Senator John
son's extreme opposition to any
league to prevent war but reduce
armament.
"With a group of amateur clubs
only a month old they were, of
course, handicapped in opposing
the regular party organization,
but the real situation is that the
people of California have been
much torn between their loyalty
and friendship to the Senator for
his able rescue of the State dur
ing his governorship from vicious
corporation control and his too
narrow vision on our interna
tional interests. The fact that in
these circumstances more than a
third of the party protested
against this latter view should
strengthen its support of the Re
publican majority in the Senate."
