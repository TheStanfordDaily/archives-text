A CERTAIN man in New York filled out his
, income tgx report.
It showed an income so large that his tax was
53%. And his total gifts to church and chur
ity for the year were $148.
Think of it —thousands spent for luxuries and
pleasure for himself; and $148 to leave the world
a little better than he found it!
Most w us do better than that; but not so very
much better.
Our average cai'.y gift for all church causes is
—less than we spend for daily papers
— less than a local telephone call
— less than a third of the day's car fare
—less than 3 cents a day
No wonder that 80% of the ministers of America
are paid less tnan $20 a week. No wonder that
the church hospitals turn away thousands of sick
people a year. No wonder that China has only
one doctor for every 400,000 people. No wonder
that every church board and charity society is
forever meeting deficits, forever passing the hat.
It isn't because we are selfisn; it isn't because we
don't want to help. It's just because no one has ever put
up a great big program to us, and asked us to think of th®
work of the church in a systematic businesslike way.
The Interchurch V/orld Movement represents the united
program of thirty denominations. They have surveyed
their whole task, no business could have done it better.
They have budgeted their needs; no business have
a more scientific budget. They have united to prevent the
possibility of waste and duplication. At least a million dol
lars will be saved by the fact that thirty individual cam
paigns are joined in one united effort.
And they come to the men or women who love America
—to you — this week asking you to use them as the chan
nel through which a certain definite part of your income
can be be applied to make this a better world.
Only you can determine what part of your income that
should be.
I* 's a good time right now to answer that question.
We're passing through the world just once; how much
