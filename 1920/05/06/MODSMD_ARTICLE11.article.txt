# CLASS ENDOWMENT FUND IS PLANNED BY 1920 MEMBERS
## 
### 
Members of the class of 1920 have
determined to establish a precedent
for succeeding class, and have de
cided to voice their appreciation for
the services rendered them by the uni
versity, by establishing a substantial
endowment â€”according to a recent
statement of the class officials. A
committee, appointed by Charles Doe,
during his term of office, has been in
session for some weeks, under the
chairmanship of C. J. Tauzer, to deter
mine the exact form that the endow
ment is to take, and the means neces
sary to insure the success of the under
taking. The final report of the com
mittee has been prepared, and will be
placed before the class president.
According to Tauzer, the necessity
for class endowments from this year
on is two-fold. In the first place, some
definite support must be given the
university in its alumni of the future.
Individual class members will not be
in a positions to give such support
for some years. The class as a whole,
however, by pooling its resources so
that too much of a burden does not
fall on any individual, is well able to
extend materiail assistance. Again,
class endowments are the only means
by which the freshman and sophomore
classes can be retained in the uni
versity it is said. At present the fi
nancial situation is so serious here,
that unless some solution to the prob
lem is discovered, the university will
eventually become a graduate college.
Junior colleges, springing up all over
the state, threaten to revolutionize the
present university system.
In view of such circumstance, says
Tauzer, material aid must be rendered
the university by the graduating class
es. The committee, after studying the
situation, is now in a position to pre
sent its solution of the difficulty, and
upon their report will depend the
action to be taken by the class.
