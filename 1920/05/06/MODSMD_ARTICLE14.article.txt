# DISTINCT MOTIFS GIVE SPARKLE TO 'LEAP YEAR LEAP'
## R.C. Alexander Turns Artist's Studio Scene Into Riot of Gorgeous, Futuristic Color 
### 
Doors will open at 7 p.m. tonight
for the public dress rehearsal of the
1921 Junior Opera. "A Leap Year
Leap" will be gone over entirely from
the first to the last curtain just as it
will be performed in the formal pre
sentation next Saturday night. An ad
mission fee of 55 cents will be charged
for the rehearsal.
Combining the familiar house party
setting with a scene of the "different"
order taking place in an artist's studio,
"A Leap Year Leap" will present two
distinct motifs Saturday night. One
of these will be of a highly original
nature, untried before in musical com
edy, and the other will be of a more
usual type.
Although a new idea in the operetta
field, the artist's studio scene in the
second act adapts itself perfectly to
the staging of light musical pieces.
The setting is one in possibilities and
the coach and authors took full ad
vantage of it. A glance at the op
portunities for chorus turns in this
scene will prove this statement. For
instance, the very words â€”artists,
artists-models, and Bohemians, sug
gests the many rich, colorful effects
open to the uses of the opera coach.
The very familiarity of the seashore
houseparty theme in musical comedy
almost proves its raison d'etre. No
thing gives the chorus coach or the
costume artist more opportunities than
the bathing suit turns, and the brightly
liued summer clothes. While Coach
Lester Seib, '22, and the authors, have
done nothing, to make this scene
hackneyed in any way, they have treat
ed it so, however, that it will live up
to the expectations of anyone who has
seen the same sort of scene portrayed
in the professional "tired-business
man" shows.
Both of these settings have given
the scenic decorator, R. Carroll Alex
ander, '21, the widest opportunity to
introduce his favorite lavish methods,
that makes the stage in both acts a
riot of color governed by artistic good
taste. Alexander is in touch with the
most modern ideas in stage decoration
and his work will undobtedly be a
sensation of the 1921 Junior Opera.
His gorgeous treatment of the studio
scene in the second act is a wonderful
exposition of the futuristic style of
decoration.
The seat sale is continuing with
marked success at Wilson's campus
store, and at Crandall's in Palo Alto.
