## 
### 
Leon Sloss, treasurer of the Board
of Trustees, and one of the original
members of the Board, died at his
home in San Francisco yesterday aft
ernoon from a sudden attack of heart
trouble. Suffering intermittently for
a number of years with heart trouble,
Sloss had an attack about 11:30 Tues
day night. It was thought by his phy
sicians that he had entirely recovered,
but at 10:00 yesterday morning he
had another attack, from which he did
not rally.
In 1891, Sloss was appointed a life
member of the Board of Trustees by
the Stanfords. Three members of the
original Board survive him; Timothy
Hopkins, appointed in 18S5, when the
University was first projectd; Judge
S. F. Leib, and Joseph D. Grant. The
latter two. like Sloss, were appointed
in 1891. when the University opened.
He was secretary-treasurer of the
Board until May 1. when he resigned
the former position. T. C. C. Gregory
was made secretary and assistant
treasurer at that time.
At the time of his death, Sloss was
president of the Northern Commercial
Company, and was interested in vari

ous business enterprises in San Fran
cisco and Alaska. With his father
and his brother Louis, he had been in
t lie Alaska Commercial Company,
which had secured the seal monopoly
of the Seal Islands; and at the expi
ration of the monopoly in 1890, the
Northern Commercial Company was
formed by his brother and Sloss.
Actively interested in public af
fairs, Sloss was one of the committee
of prominent San Franciscans who
went to Washington in 1915 and se
cured the Panama-Pacific Exposition
for San Francisco. He was made one
of the executive committee of the ex
position. He was connected with
many charitable enterprises.
Sloss was a member of various San
Francisco clubs, and was a graduate
of the University of California. His
son, Leon Sloss, Jr., '20, is registered
in the University.
Professor A. W. Hewlett, head of
the medicine department of the Medi
cal School was summoned to Sloss'
bedside Wednesday.
The death of Sloss yesterday and
the recent suicide of P. T. Morgan
make two vacancies in the Board of
Trustees.
