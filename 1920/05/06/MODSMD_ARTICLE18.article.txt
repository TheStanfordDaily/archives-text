# THE 						IMPORTANCE OF THE ENDOWMENT
## 
### 
rrONIGHT'S announcement of the endowment plan for the Senior Class is
* one of the most progressive steps which any class has ever taken. Class
endowments in the universities of the East have proved immensely success
ful and it is gratifying to see that Stanford is to follow along the same lines.
There is no better time to shiw one's appreciation of his Alma Mater
than at the time of graduation. Just what form this appreciation will take
has not been announced by the committee as yet but it will undoubtedly
be something which will not work a hardship upon any individual but which
in the aggregate will mean a great deal to the University.
Any endowment idea which is to be worked out will probably specify how
the money or at least a portion of the money is to be used. Scholarships,
faculty salaries, special series of lectures, athletic funds, student enterprises
are but a few of the many suggestions which come into mind. The value of
the endowment in any case is invaluable as a precedent for the classes to
come.
In order to make the endowment a success it will take the co-operation of
every member of the Senior Class. The idea is for the most part foreign
to many members of the class but in the next week they will be given the
opportunity to acquaint themselves with the principal feature of the plan.
The other three classes of the University will be looking on with interest
and the success of the venture will largely determine what the freshman,
sophomore, and junior classes will do when it comes time for them to gradu
ate. If the class of '20 can put the endowment idea over with far-reaching
results, the other classes are going to follow in their steps. The following
classes will not be outdone by those who have gone before. The responsibility
is an important one and it is to be hoped that the Senior Class will not
shirk its responsibility.
