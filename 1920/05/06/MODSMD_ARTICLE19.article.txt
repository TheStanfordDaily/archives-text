## 
### 
rpHE news of the death of Leon Sloss, member of the Board of Trustees and
Treasurer of the University, was received with the sincerest regret and
sympathy by many members of the Stanford community who have been in
active touch with the University. Leon Sloss represented the old guard of the
Board of Trustees, as he was one of the three life members appointed by the
Stanfords. He began his services with the University in 1891 and has served
faithfully since that time.
Sloss is the third member of the Board of Trustees who passed away
recently. Vanderlyn Stow and Percy T. Morgan both represented the financial
element of the Board. These three men pulled the University through the
period of financial depression which threatened the very existence of the
University itself. It is fortunate that the ranches have been sold and that the
University is> at the present time upon a soand financial basis.
Leon Sloss is well known in San Francisco business circles and has al
ways been considered a fine financial expert. He was president of the North
ern Commercial Company. He was director of many well known companies
and was identified with a large number of charitable enterprises. He was a
graduate of the University of California as Stanford University had not been
founded at the time he took his degree.
