### 
"Junior Week" Chappie will be out on
Quad tomorrow. As an announcer for
the three days of festivity, it fulfills its
duty well by its clever and subtle car

and the opening verse and drawing is
particularly clever this month, drawn by
Chappie's girl artist, Janice Dunker, '21.
The biggest feature of this number is
a center double-page by Dorothy Plum
mer, '20, satirizing the various dancing
couples that will be seen at the "Prom."
"The Rough Who Didn't Queen to the
Prom," is the title of a humorous car
toon by George Hall, '19.
Other contributors to this issue were
Hal Crowe, 'IS; Charles Arnn, '19; Sam
Perry, '19; Darl Macßoyle, '20, and
many others.
