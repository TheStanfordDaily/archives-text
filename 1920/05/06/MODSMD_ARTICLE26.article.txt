Three comprehensive articles upon
subjects of vital interest to Stanford
Students feature this issue of the Il
lustrated Review. One is by D.
Charles Gardner, and describes the
Stanford Home for Convalescent Chil
dren which is soon to be a reality.
Although the old Stanford home was
badly wrecked by the earthquake, the
part that is left affords an excellent
home in which the youngsters sent
down from the city can recuperate.
Dr. Gardner has written his article in
a delightfully romantic vein.
A full description of the new plan
for undergraduate instruction, as re
cently passed by the Academic Coun
cil, is given in this issue.
An article which will be of especial
interest to the men, and particularly
to the athletes, is that entitled "An
Analysis of Stanford's Athletic Slump,"
by Coach W. H. Maloney. This ar
ticle accuses Stanford of having lost
something of that spirit which has
made it so well-known at home and
abroad. That "deterioration is spelled
by the recent rowdyisms on the cam
pus", is Maloney's statement.
