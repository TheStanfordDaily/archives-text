## 
### 
Stanford's quota of uslicrs for the
Democratic National Nomination Con
vention, to be held in San Francisco, lias
been reduced from 100 to 65, according
to a letter received by the local Demo
cratic Club today from George F.
O'Mara. assistant to the chairman.
This action has been taken to allow
eastern universities to be represented.
The entire state quota has been reduced
to 130, to be taken from Stanford and
the University of California, instead of
200 as was originally planned.
Mr. O'Mara has expressed a desire to
use only those men who are certain to
attend all sessions, and as more than the
quota allowed Stanford have made ap
plication, it will be necessary to limit
this number to those certain of faithful
attendance.
