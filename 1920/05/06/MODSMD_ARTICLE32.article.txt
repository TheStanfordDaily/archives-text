# STANFORD TRACK MEN MEET OREGON AGGIES SATURDAY
## 
### 
Oregon Agriculture College and Stan
ford meet on the local oval next Satur
day afternoon in the last track event be
fore the Pacific Coast Conference meet
scheduled for May 15th.
The Stanford team is now in first-class
condition, and with the exception of
Kirksey, Wilcox, and Green, will be en
tered by Coach Maloney in Saturday's
meet. Although Kirksey is able to run,
and Wilcox and Green are rounding into
proper shape, Maloney will keep these
stars off the oval to prevent any mishap
prior to the Conference meet May 14
and 15. "Dink" Templeton will be in
the running for first place in the high
and broad jumps. Westwick is figured
to break the tape in the distance events.
Wells and Lilly should put up a strong
bid for the sprints even though Kirk
sey will not compete.
Oregon Agricultural College is expect
ed to send the strongest team down Sat
urday that has represented her for ten
years. Dr. A. D. Browne, former coach
at Oregon, states that a number of stars
will compete on the local oval with the
Cardinal tracksters.
Track men have been breaking train
ing rules and have failed to report for
practice, declares Coach Maloney. The
situation is serious, according to the
coach and makes it necessary that every
Stanford track man show the proper
Cardinal spirit if Stanford wishes to
win. At the conclusion of the track sea
son Maloney will inform the Executive
Committee of the Student Body of the
names of members of the track team
who have failed to do the part assigned
them in all events after the California
meet. Any man who fails to report now
will not receive an "S" even though he
has made points in the meet with U. C.

lowing list report to him Thursday eve
