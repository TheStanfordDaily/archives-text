# ALUMNUS HEARTILY APPROVES OF CULVER
## Enthusiastically Supports the Board's Choice of Dean of Men 
### 
Frank E. (Mickie) .McClure, ex-'l5,
is enthusiastic about George B. Cul
ver. '97, as Dean of Men, in a letter
that has just been received. He says
that he supposes that the average
Stanford undergraduate will take it
for granted that the man appointed to
this office is likely to be "an old man
with dyspepsia, one foot in the grave,
and a 'crabby' unreasonable disposi
tion."
"But," says McClure, "to the con
trary the students will find him to be
a very wide-awake 'real regular fellow'
with a keen interest in all student
activities.
"I first became associated with
George B. Culver some twelve or thir
teen years ago and with each succeed
ing year my admiration for him has
grown to boundless dimensions. His
ideas linked with a wonderful per
sonality are sure to go over big with
the fellows and I can't say enough or
hope too much for the success he is
sure to achieve in his new undertak
ing.
"Just give George B. Culver an even
break, gents, and watch him go."
Walter J. Gores, '17, was head of
the Men's Student Control Council
during the autumn quarter, sent in the
following statement concerning Dean
Culver:
The office of Dean of Men at Stan
ford is a very important one; one
which can be of inestimable service
to the men students as individuals, to
the student body as whole, and to the
university administration. He is in
a position to bring about that close
bond of understanding, truthfulness
and co-operation between the students
and the administration which the best
interests of the university demand.
He should be a man of such person
ality and character that students will
seek his counsel and advice without
prejudice or distrust. He must be a
"mixer" and a friend.
I feel that the men of the univer
sity, and the university as a whole,
are to be congratulated upon the
c hoice of the Board of Trustees of Geo.
Bliss Culver to fill this difficult post.
As my own personal friend and teacher
1 came to admire him in the qualities
of tactfulness, of broad understanding
and keen human sympathy which
make him so well fitted to assume the
responsibilities of the office. To know
him is to like him for he has the
happy faculty of aspiring confidence
in an unassuming way. He has a big
heart and an unselfish desire to help
others which cannot but inspire ad
miration in those who come to know
him above all other qualities he is a
Stanford man through and through.
He is as full of red-blooded enthusi
asm now as he was when still a stu
dent on the "Farm." That augurs
well for the way in which he will dis
charge his duties. He is the kind of
alumnus Stanford men may be proud
to have in the position for which he
has been selected.

Frank E. (Mickie) .McClure, ex-'l5,
is enthusiastic about George B. Cul
ver. '97, as Dean of Men, in a letter
that has just been received. He says
that he supposes that the average
Stanford undergraduate will take it
for granted that the man appointed to
this office is likely to be "an old man
with dyspepsia, one foot in the grave,
and a 'crabby' unreasonable disposi
tion."
"But," says McClure, "to the con
trary the students will find him to be
a very wide-awake 'real regular fellow'
with a keen interest in all student
activities.
"I first became associated with
George B. Culver some twelve or thir
teen years ago and with each succeed
ing year my admiration for him has
grown to boundless dimensions. His
ideas linked with a wonderful per
sonality are sure to go over big with
the fellows and I can't say enough or
hope too much for the success he is
sure to achieve in his new undertak
ing.
"Just give George B. Culver an even
break, gents, and watch him go."
Walter J. Gores, '17, was head of
the Men's Student Control Council
during the autumn quarter, sent in the
following statement concerning Dean
Culver:
The office of Dean of Men at Stan
ford is a very important one; one
which can be of inestimable service
to the men students as individuals, to
the student body as whole, and to the
university administration. He is in
a position to bring about that close
bond of understanding, truthfulness
and co-operation between the students
and the administration which the best
interests of the university demand.
He should be a man of such person
ality and character that students will
seek his counsel and advice without
prejudice or distrust. He must be a
"mixer" and a friend.
I feel that the men of the univer
sity, and the university as a whole,
are to be congratulated upon the
c hoice of the Board of Trustees of Geo.
Bliss Culver to fill this difficult post.
As my own personal friend and teacher
1 came to admire him in the qualities
of tactfulness, of broad understanding
and keen human sympathy which
make him so well fitted to assume the
responsibilities of the office. To know
him is to like him for he has the
happy faculty of aspiring confidence
in an unassuming way. He has a big
heart and an unselfish desire to help
others which cannot but inspire ad
miration in those who come to know
him above all other qualities he is a
Stanford man through and through.
He is as full of red-blooded enthusi
asm now as he was when still a stu
dent on the "Farm." That augurs
well for the way in which he will dis
charge his duties. He is the kind of
alumnus Stanford men may be proud
to have in the position for which he
has been selected.
