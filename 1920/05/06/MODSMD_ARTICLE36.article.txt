# AMBULANCE SERVICE NAME SCHOLARSHIPS FOR STANFORD DEAD
## 
### 
Announcing a plan to perpetuate the
memory and influence of the one hun
dred and twenty Ambulance men who
were killed in the war, the American
Field Service Bulletin reappears for
the first time since the men returned
from France. The Bulletin was pub
lished during the war, and sent to all
the old ambulanciers, serving as a
bond of unity among the men who had
joined other branches of service after
the United States entered the struggle.
The men at the head of the Field Ser
vice have planned a series of com
memorative fellowships, either for
American students in French universi
ties, or for French students in Amer
ican universities, which it is hoped
will perpetuate the friendship of Amer
ica and France so stimulated by the
war.
Among the names that will be hon
ored in this way are those of three
Stanford men, who were the first to
go, and who gave all they had. These
are:
Harold Vincent Aupperle, (S.S.TJ 10)
member of the Red Cross mission to
Serbia. Died of typhus fever, Serbia,
June 14, 1919. Age 24.
Arthur Clifford Kimber, (5.5.U.14),
U. S. Aviation. Killen in Sedan of
fensive, near Bantheville, France,
September 26, 1918. Age, 22.
Alan Hammond Nichols, (S.S.U. 14),
French Aviation. Killed in aerial
combat, Compiegne, France, June 1,
1918. Age 21.
Harry W. Frqntz, '17, contributes
to the issue of the Bulletin, "A Post
script to the History of the Balkan
Sections," giving a vivid account of
Monastir, and the districts once occu
pied by Section 10, in 1918, and de
scribing the honors accorded Aupper
le at his funeral in Belgrade.
The Bulletin is anxious to secure
the addresses of all its members, in
order to get in touch with them be
fore the Field Service Reunion, to be
held in New York, May 7, S, 9. In the
list of those whose addresses are
asked for are William H. Honens, and
Walter R. Malm, formerly of Stanford
University.
