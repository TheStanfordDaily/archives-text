# Hebrew Religions Thought Outlined
## Second Memorial Lecture is Delivered by Taylor to Crowded Hall 
### 
"Jesus Christ and teachings he per
sonified stood as the culmination of the
previous gropings of the Hebrew race
toward a religious ideal," asserted Dr.
Henry Osborn Taylor in the second of
the West Memorial lectures last night.
"Moses and the prophets pointed out the
way which led to the Christian effort to
harmonize man's life with the law and
love of God. Whether Socrates and Aris
totle would have approved the teach
ings of the Nazarene we can not know
The similarity, however, in some re
spects between the doctrines of the
founder of Christianity and the Greek
thinkers enables us to say that the lat
ter broke the way for the proclaiming
of the high moral truths of Jesus."
"The historical student," continued Dr.
Taylor, "must look in vain for any ef
fect of Christianity on the moral con
duct of the Roman Empire." The ao
parent failure of our religion in the Ro
man period, indicated the speaker, can
not in the least be taken as evidence of
its lack of power. The value of the
teachings of Jesus are not exhausted to
day, and his doctrines now act as a
powerful moral stimulus.
The dominant characteristic of the
Greek was his ability to reason accu
rately. The Hellenic heroes, as Achilles,
gained renown not by their brawn but
by their intellectual ability. The Greeks
stimulated curiosity, and guided by a
keen intelligence sought to live a full
and abundant life. Spiritual thougnt was
not by them made paramount but was
given a moderate share n- a ba.anced
pioportion of intellectual interests
Knowledge was â€¢held to be of prime im
portance, and to be truly wise was the
1 of all Greek thinkers.
This evening Dr. Taylor will deliver

the contributions of the various nation?
