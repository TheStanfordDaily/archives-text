Every freshman will be required to
take a set course in "Problems of Citi

there are required courses in history,
biological studies, and in foreign lan
guages, before a student may become a
member of a major department.
One other duty falls upon the
committee in connection with preparing
students for entering a major depart
ment. It must find out what the stu

course chosen by him is approved by
the major department of his choice.
Each major department is empowered
to establish such prerequisites as it
deems advisable.
