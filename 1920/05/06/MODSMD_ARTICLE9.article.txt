ticipated in the Pacific Coast League de
bate last quarter with Oregon Universi
ty
Coach M. L. McClintock has arranged
with local professors to give the squad
a course of special instruction in Mexi
can affairs. Daily practice under Coach

of Stanford's keenest rivals in the foren
sic field in the past, having won one
more contest from the Cardinal speak

asts declare that this season's results
will make the honors even.
