Hamlet and the
Pretty Junior had
something in common..
With the melancholy Dane 'twas a question
of "to be, or not": with the charming Junior
—or indeed the lovely co-ed of any year—
it's a question of "to go, or not to go"—and
the only reason one would think of not go
ing, would be the proverbial "nothing to
wear. ' And, surely, the only occasion for
such a dilemma would be—the rather "steep"
prices of pretty clothes, yes?
Well, there 1 s no need for further hesitation
—for there's a wonderful chance to buy all
manner of nice things at very, very special
prices— party dresses, negligees, lingerie, all
sorts of tremendously smart sport togs —and
accessories!
