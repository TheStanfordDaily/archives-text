A FINE PHOTOGRAPH
Represents a great deal of time,
much expensive material, and con
siderable artistic skill.
It requires also one who takes an
intense personal interest in the suc
cess of his work.
Work such as this rarely ever comes
from Picture Factories, and is seldom
found on the bargain counter.
MY PHOTOGRAPHS ARE REASONABLY PRICED
