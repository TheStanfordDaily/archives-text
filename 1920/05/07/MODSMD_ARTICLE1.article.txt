### 
Fifteen track stars of the Oregon
Agricultural College will compete with
the Cardinal track team on the local
oval tomorrow afternoon, the meet be
ing scheduled to start at 2:30.

is uncertain as the Oregon squad is
an unknown quantity and the Stanford
team has relaxed training since the

loney will keep him off the track in
order to prevent any mishap prior
to the big scrap a week from tomor

coast universities compete for the P.

best of Oregon's pole vaulters.

Ken Lilly; hurdles, Wells, Gene Davis,
Max King; broad jump, "Dink"
