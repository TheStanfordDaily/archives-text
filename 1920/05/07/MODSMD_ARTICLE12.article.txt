# CUSS ENDOWMENT SCHEME PLANNED
## Harvard System Will Probably Be Used by Senior Committee 
### 
Preparatory to forming a feasible plan
to assure a suitable endowment to the
University on behalf of the senior class,
members of the Endowment Committee
made a rapid survey and investigation of
the methods successfully in use at other
representative universities, and finally
determined to base the system to be
put into operation here upon the Har
vard principle, according to a report re
leased today.
"Several eventualities had to be taken
into consideration, which ordinarily
would not have had to be coped with
if a system were already in operation,"
said C. J. Tauzer, chairman of the com
mittee. "In the first place we had to
decide upon some plan which could be
used by succeeding classes. We wish to
establish a precedent of lending material
support to the University from which we
graduate which can be" followed by all
the classes, thus assuring a co-operative
alumni body for the future.
After a brief survey of the methods
in use at other institutions, we deter
mined that a plan based upon the Har
vard endowment system of class insur
ance would accomplish the most for
Stanford, while placing the least burden
possible upon our class members. Our
plan, to be proposed to the class at its
next meeting, will be based upon that
method."
For a number of years the Harvard
graduating classes have endowed the
University with approximately $75,000 a
year. This has been accomplished by
insuring the classes for twenty years,
the sum accruing to the University at
the end of that time. Thus, at the"cost
of a small, individual, yearly payment,
the University has been able to count
upon the sum endowed—and, in ease of
necessity, to draw upon it in advance.
"Such a plan would not show an im
mediate return for Stanford," stated
Panzer, "but if each succeeding class
follows in our footsteps the University
will have guaranteed it the united sup
port it now lacks from its alumni body.
The advantage of a cash endowment lies
in that the University can use the money
for whatever purpose is most impera
tive to its progress."
