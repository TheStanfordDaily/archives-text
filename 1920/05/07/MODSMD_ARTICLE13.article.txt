Although no varsity men are entered
in the annual P. A. A. track meet to
be held at Berkeley Saturday after
noon, the Stanford colors will be rep
resented by a four-man freshman team
who will runjn a few events in the
Pacific Coast 'classic.
Those who have been picked to com
pete are Rice in the high hurdles and
discus;Howell in the high jump; El
liott in the mile, and Thompson in the
broad jump and 880. The past per
formances of these men should place
them in the point-column in every
event in which they participate. The
competition will be keen as all the
athletic clubs and nearby universities
are entering teams including the
University of California.
Stanford varsity tracksters are un
able to compete because of the Oregon

local oval.
