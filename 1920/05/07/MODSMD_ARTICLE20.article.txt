# GET BEHIND LABOR DAY
## 
### 
r'NTHUSiASM for any such plan as the Labor Day to be held next Thursday
is seldom spontaneous among the members of the student body. It takes
the concentrated efforts of a few who are imbued with the idea to get the
ball rolling. The committee in charge of the arrangements for Labor Day
should not find the task a difficult one in view of the cause they are work
ing for but a little educative work is always necessary.
The Board for the Convalescent Home for Children from the Stanford
Clinics have worked faithfully to give the children as much as possible.
Many times the work has been discouraging because of the lack of funds and
equipment but always a steady progressive policy has been followed in the
face of the utmost difficulties. The Stanford residence offered the grounds
and size which the Board has been looking for and it was with considerable
elation that they received the word approving their rental of the house and
grounds.
From the beginning of the Stanford home project, however, the Board
counted upon student aid to make possible the taking over of the residence.
The cost of cleaning up the grounds would almost be prohibitive if it was to
be done at the cost of the Convalescent Home, but student labor will not be
much of a hardship 011 any individual and it will mean considerable in the
end to the children who are to enjoy the privilege of running over the
grounds.
The campus will hear more about the details for Thursday and as each
new phase is announced students are asked to talk about it their friends.
If they don't know what you are talking about tell them and get them to
talk to others. There will be work for every man and woman 011 the campus.
It will be a chance for everybody to get together and show their appreciation
for the founders of the University. Mrs. Stanford always held a warm
regard for the childen of California and no more worthy way could be found
to commemorate that regard than for Stanford students to donate their
services for the invalid children of the Stanford Clinics.
