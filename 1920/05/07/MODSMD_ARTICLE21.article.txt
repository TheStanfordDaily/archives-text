# HOOVER TO MAKE A NATIONAL FIGHT
## 
### 
/TAMPUS politicians may have thought that the political situation would be
settled with the overwhelming majority for Johnson in the primary elec
tion Tuesday, but Hoover's statement is the cause for new speculation. As
alluring as are the promises of Junior Week and other campus festivities
scheduled for the remainder of the quarter, one cannot overlook the fact that
in the Hoover statement published Wednesday night Hoover makes it plain
that he will make a national fight.
No one seems quite able to determine just what the game is about in
the Hoover ranks. Hoover evidently does not think that he is beaten just
because he failed to swing his home state, in spite of whot political experts
have prophesied. Many Hoover supporters still seem to feel that Hoover
has a good chance to swing the nomination and it will be with considerable
interest that bystanders will watch the developments of the Republican Con
vention in Chicago.
Hoover may count upon the antagonism between the Johnson and Wood
forces to swing his way in a third party. Although this seems somewhat
improbable there is little doubt that the Rpublican situation is somewhat
complicated by Hoover's determination not to withdraw. Wood, Hoover and
Johnson, with Harding a possible fourth, will make the race for the nomina
tion a hot one. The nomination wilt probably be decided by a mere turn in
the cards. California with Hoover and Johnson will still play an important
part in the convention. The Johnson machine need have no worries about
California still being on the map.

"STANFORD TO ANTWERP" is a long way but we hope the boys will
make the grade.
