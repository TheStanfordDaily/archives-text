# PRESSING PROBLEMS OF EDUCATION TO BE CONFERENCE TOPIC
## 
### 
A national conference of representa
tive citizens from every part of the
United States has been called by the
United States Commissioner of Edu
cation to meet at Washington, May
19, 20, and 21, "to consider the press
ing problem of education from the
standpoint of statesmanship and the
public welfare."
Commissioner Claxton's conference
has the hearty approval of the new
Secretary of the Interior, John Bar
ton Payne, who has sent a special in
vitation to the governor of every State
to head the delegation of his State at
the conference.
In his letter to the governors, Sec
retary Payne suys:
"The emergency in education in
the United States, arising out of the
present and prospective shortage of
teachers, the necessity for immediate
increases In funds for the support of
schools of all grades, and the need
for better adjustment of educational
programs to the requirements of the
new era are, I believe, of so great im
portance as to justify the calling of a
national conference of representative
citizens to consider these pressing
problems of education from the stand
point of statesmanship and the pub
lic welfare. Such a conference is be
ing called by the Commissioner of
Education, with my approval, to meet
in Washington on May 19, 20, 21.
"It is very desirable that each State
be represented in this conference by
its chief executive, its chief school
officer, and a good number of its most
prominent and influential citizens."

In his invitation for the conference
Commissioner Claxton points out that
the proposed gathering is primarily
a citizens' conference rather than a
meeting of educators, though repre
sentative school men will be in at
tendance. Business men, farmers,
labor leaders, members of boards of
education, editors of magazines and
newspapers, and individual men and
women interested in education are
among those who will be invited.
