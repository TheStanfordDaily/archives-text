lars for permitting one's self to be
se led in a coffin and buried beneath

worth it?
Miss Golden Sylvester, coed at the
University of lowa, thinks so.
Recently the manager of the Strard

wager. He offered $20 to the young

inj day.
Miss Sylvester heard about the wa
ger. She offered to take it up. The
manager eagerly accepted, and the

ciate the idea at all. She strenuously
called attention to the 10 o'clock rule,
which apparently applies to lowa co
eds, alive cr dead.
So Miss Sylvester did not retire to
the c ffin on Friday, and the $20 wager
remains unchallenged.
