# DECORATIONS FOR PROM COMPLETED; NOTHING UNDONE
## Programs May be Obtained Until 4:45 at the Bookstore 
### 
Decorating for the Junior Prom has
been completed and nothing has been
left undone. The dance will start to
night at 9 o'clock and is to be held in
the Encina Gymnasium. The junior
class has gone to considerable ex
pense in order to secure the best of
decorations. The hall's dress throws
out an Arabian effect and is a perfect
reproduction of an Arabian tent, only
its esthetic power is greater in repre
sentation than it would be in reality.
To add more to the realism of the
place several valuable and scarce
relics have been obtained. A search
was made in San Francisco for these
relics, and the result of the efforts
spent is quite evident in the hall's
decorations.
B. A. Cody, '21, has much credit due
to him for the appearance of the ball
room. He has successfully worked out
and gr atly added to a few hints which
W. A. Gores, ex-'l7, gave him several
weeks ago. Cody, with the fullest
co-operation of the decorating com
mittee, has transformed the barren
gymnasium into an artistically deco
rated ballroom.
The dance programs are in keeping
with the decorations. They can be
obtained at the book store until 4:45
this evening and from that time on
until the beginning of the prom they
can be secured at Wilson's, on the
campus.
Many new plans will be carried out
this evening. There will be no grand
rush for food, as all catering will be
handled by representatives of Frank
Miller's of Palo Alto, and experienced
waiters will do the serving. Punch
js to be served at the four corners
of the room.
During the dinner intermission some
form of entertainment will be given,
and every moment of the time will be
supplied with some novel stunt.
