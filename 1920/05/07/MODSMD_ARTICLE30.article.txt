# INTRAMURAL LEADERS CINCH CHANCES FOR FINAL TITLE HONORS
## 
### W.C. Evans, '22 
With only one more week of play
ing before the finals, it is easy to see
the outcome in most of the leagues.
In only the third league is there doubt
as to the finals result and that will
not be settled until next week when
the last game of the series is played.
El Camino, Phi Kappa Psi, and Sigma
Nu all look like contenders for the
title in the third league with the com
parative scores giving El Camino the
edge. The Theta Delta Chi nine on a
misunderstanding lost one game to the
Delta Taus by failure to appear and
that ties them with the Kappa Alphas
for first place in league four. They
beat the K. A. team easily the last
time that they played them and there
is little possibility of any other out
come in the next meeting if the two
teams have to meet again to ploy off
the tie. The following shows the com
parative dope on the various teams:
The Beta Theta Pi nine is leading
league one with an unbroken string
of victories by large scores. They
have only one more game to play in
the league and they have already
beaten the team which will meet them
by a 19 to 3 score. "Mike" Reed, '23,
the star heaver of the Beta nine has
not been working in the last two
games and Les Wark has taken his
place and performed so well that he
is considered a pitcher of consider
able merit. Mertz, behind the hope
sack holds the team together and has
proved invaluable with his perfect
pegs and good stops.
Sigma Chi is at the head of league
two with four wins and no defeats.
When they beat the Phi Delt nine they
establish their claim to supremacy in
the league for a certainty. Neff, who
has been pitching for the Sigma Chis
has been developing steadily until he
is considered by the Gymnasium staff
to be one of the best heavers in the
intergroup leagues. In the last two
games he has let the opposition down
with a minimum of hits.
El- Camino and Phi Kappa Psi are
tied for the leadership of league three.
Both teams are well-balanced, smooth
working nines and are playing a good
brand of ball so it is hard now to pick
wh'ch one will take the league plaque.
In the fourth league the Theta Delts
seem to have a sure lead and ought
to have no trouble in their game with
the K. A. nine.
The Bull Pen will tage the fifth
league in a walk. They have a good
man on the mound in the person of
V. E. Criss and a good infield behind
him.
-All the dope gives the sixth league
title to the Breakers. "Dink" Temple
ton, the Breaker pitcher, let the S.
A. E. nine out without a single hit
in last night's game. Only three men
on the S. A. E. team connected with
the ball and those three were thrown
out a- first.

as to the finals result and that will
not be settled until next week when
the last game of the series is played.
El Camino, Phi Kappa Psi, and Sigma
Nu all look like contenders for the
title in the third league with the com
parative scores giving El Camino the
edge. The Theta Delta Chi nine on a
misunderstanding lost one game to the
Delta Taus by failure to appear and
that ties them with the Kappa Alphas
for first place in league four. They
beat the K. A. team easily the last
time that they played them and there
is little possibility of any other out
come in the next meeting if the two
teams have to meet again to ploy off
the tie. The following shows the com
parative dope on the various teams:
The Beta Theta Pi nine is leading
league one with an unbroken string
of victories by large scores. They
have only one more game to play in
the league and they have already
beaten the team which will meet them
by a 19 to 3 score. "Mike" Reed, '23,
the star heaver of the Beta nine has
not been working in the last two
games and Les Wark has taken his
place and performed so well that he
is considered a pitcher of consider
able merit. Mertz, behind the hope
sack holds the team together and has
proved invaluable with his perfect
pegs and good stops.
Sigma Chi is at the head of league
two with four wins and no defeats.
When they beat the Phi Delt nine they
establish their claim to supremacy in
the league for a certainty. Neff, who
has been pitching for the Sigma Chis
has been developing steadily until he
is considered by the Gymnasium staff
to be one of the best heavers in the
intergroup leagues. In the last two
games he has let the opposition down
with a minimum of hits.
El- Camino and Phi Kappa Psi are
tied for the leadership of league three.
Both teams are well-balanced, smooth
working nines and are playing a good
brand of ball so it is hard now to pick
wh'ch one will take the league plaque.
In the fourth league the Theta Delts
seem to have a sure lead and ought
to have no trouble in their game with
the K. A. nine.
The Bull Pen will tage the fifth
league in a walk. They have a good
man on the mound in the person of
V. E. Criss and a good infield behind
him.
-All the dope gives the sixth league
title to the Breakers. "Dink" Temple
ton, the Breaker pitcher, let the S.
A. E. nine out without a single hit
in last night's game. Only three men
on the S. A. E. team connected with
the ball and those three were thrown
out a- first.
