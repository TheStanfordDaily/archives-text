An industrial university to cost $5,-
000,000 will be erected in Shanghai,
if the plans of Chinese educators and
industrial leaders are attained. A
novel feature of the proposed uni
versity will be the incorporations in it
of a complete cotton mill which will
employ its students and require them
to perform productive toil as well as
school work.
