# DR. JORDAN WRITES FAVORING SENIOR ENDOWMENT PLAN
## 
### 
"To the Daily Palo Alto:
"I am asked for a note on the plan
for class endowments at Stanford. I
must write a little blindly for I have
heard no discussion of the plans* since
1916.
"Hut in principle it is surely an ex
cellent thing.
"The future of the University depends
in large degree on the closeness of the
relations its alumni may hold to it. A
professorship, a department, or even a
! series of scholarships, endowed by a class
I would tend to strengthen the interest of
all its members. In Eastern colleges, this
is being successfully accomplished. I
have just received word of a professor
ship endowed at Cornell, not by a class
but by my own fraternity, a method a
little different but the same in principle.
"Meanwhile the endowment of the
University, however great in the begin
ning, must go on increasing, and this
hoped-for result must be chiefly through
efforts of the alumni. Just now this
University, like others, has suffered
greatly through the loss in value of the
dollar, a necessary result of the war,
with its inflation of credit, over-taxation,
and waste. There is no increase of in
come from bonds, while everything
i which is bought has doubled in cost,
' and great increases in salary are neces
! sarv to enable professors to live. To
this end, substantial tuition fees afford
j the only visible way out. This method
may be temporary, but the time will
never come when the University s!#tll
not be obliged to pay high salaries to
good teachers. It was Mr. Stanford's
purpose to pay the highest salaries and
to secure the best of men. Every help
the graduating classes can contribute to
this end will substantially aid the Uni-
I versity, and at the same time hold closer
the devoted, but world-scattered body of
Alumni.
"Very truly yours.
"David Starr Jordan."
