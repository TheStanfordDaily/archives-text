# DEVELOPMENT OF RELIGION TRACED BY DR. TAYLOR
## Concludes Series of West Memorial Lectures Last Evening 
### 
â€¢
Tracing the progress of religion from
the early Roman days to the present
time and showing its development, con
ception, and acceptance, Dr. Henry Os
born Taylor gave the third and last
number of his series of West Memorial
lectures in the Little Theatre last eve
ning.
Dr. Taylor said:
"Christ's gospel set forth no idea of
barter or an expectation of anything in
exchange for love. It was love going
out to meet love. Men are brethren be
cause they are sons of the same Father.
Man shall love his fellow for his own
salvation and not for his perdition.
"The Greeks and Romans translated
the gospel into the Hellenic and the
Latin. Thus the teachings of Christ
came down from one age to another.
"It would appear that the Romans
would Romanize the barbarians, but to
the contrary, the barbarians seemed for
a while to barbarize the Roman insti
tutions."
Dr. Taylor turned aside at this point
to emphasize the importance science
plays in the world.
"The progress of science has been so
rapid and thorough that it is impossible
to even outline it. These last few cen
turies have undergone many great
changes, mostly due to the new inven
tions devised.
"God has kept us from ignorance, but
let us not forget that there have been
periods of regression, and let us be care
ful to keep our age free from indications
of ignorance. It is ignorance that
prompts people to condemn the practice
of vivisection. This has been one of the
greatest aids to science and physiology.
"We have come out of this great war
unstrung, but if we rely upon our knowl
edge and rational thinking we will
emerge triumphant. There is more love
in the world now than ever before. But
patience is needed.
"Love knocks at the doors of the
heart, and is admitted through the win
dows of the mind. Truth will make
you free."
