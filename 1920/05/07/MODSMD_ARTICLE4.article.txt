The line "infraction of rules" in the
above statement issued yesterday sounds
cold and bare in comparison to a story
of a night of thrills spent by two un
guarded women in an open boat, of baf
fled searching parties, and of frantic
house mothers. But the whole affair
took place before this action of the
Women's Council was threatened with
being buried in official mystery, until a
Daily Palo Alto representative was put
on the trail.
On the night of April 28, the Daily
Palo Alto representative found, a Roble
watchman discovered a pile of blankets
heaped beside of the sides of the build
ing. He left the place to report what
he had seen to Miss Gertrude Gardiner,
matron of the hall. When they returned
to the spot the blankets and pillows had
disappeared, and with thenj, Miss Gardi
ner soon found out, had gone Virginia
McFarland, '23. and Marie McDowell,
'23, two of the girls in the hall.
These two young women, who claim
Kappa Kappa Gamma as their sorority,
were on Lagunita in Miss McFarland's
canoe about 8:30 on the evening in
question, according to Miss McFarland's
story told to the representative, when
they though how "lovely" it would be
to spend the whole night there. The
thought was soon a reality.
They naddled to shore and went first
to Wilson's, where they laid in rations,
and then went to their rooms at Roble
1 fall for blankets. Returning to La
gunita they paddled to the pile of rocks
in the center of the lake, and there an
chored for the night by tying the boat to
the pipe. After enjoying the moonlight,
according to Miss McFarland, they went
to sleep about 11 o'clock.
In the meantime Miss Gardiner had
organized a searching party, and this
posse was pacing the shores of Lagunjh,
hoping to find some trace of the missing
pair. The search was useless, however,
for, in the words of Miss McFarland,
"there was too much fog for them to
see us." She did not explain what had
become of the "lovely" moon which had
enticed them onto the lake.
The Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority
house could give no information as to
their whereabouts. For that matter,
neither could the searching party that
was sent out after them. Finally the
searchers called it a night and left day
light to bring about what it could.
And it did bring about the return of
the two freshmen women, very much
bedraggled from exposure, but happy
in the experience of having spent the
night in a canoe on Lagunita. Whether
it was the influence of reading Scott's
"Lady of the Lake" or hearing "Rocked
in the Cradle of the Deep" that gave
them this bright idea. Miss McFarland
was unable to say in the interview yes
terday. She did point out the fact,
however, that the night was "lovely"—
which gives the delightful experience of
spending a night with the pollywogs a
very strong recommendation.
Anyway, the Women's Council was
much less romantic about having the La
gunita used as a sleeping porch than
were the Misses McFarland and Mc-
Dowell. Monday they gave the two
"dateless" sentence of three weeks
apiece and slapped another week's pen
alty on Miss McFarland for being an old
offender against council rules.
