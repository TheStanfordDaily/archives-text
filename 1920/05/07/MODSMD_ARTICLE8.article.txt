## Stanford Wins Fourth Straight Victory on Northern Trip; Will Play Two More Games 
### 
Spccial to the Daily Palo Alto
SALEM, Ore., May 6. —By a seven
to one score, the Stanford nine de
feated the Willamette baseball team
in a game which was played on the
local field yesterday afternoon. This
is the Cardinal team's fourth conse
cutive victory on the Northern trip.
Today and tomorrow the Oregon Agri
cultural squad will meet the Stanford
nine in two Pacific Coast Conference
matches.
The Willamette baseball team was
trampled all over by Coach Evan's
team in a slow game yesterday. The
surprise of the game came with the
announcement of the battery. Maillot,
who has been playing shortstop, was
used in the box. He allowed the
northerners only five hits. The north
ern coach in an effort to stop the
Cardinal victory used three pitchers.
Even though Stanford was up
against a weak team, they failed to
come up with many hits, considering
the camparfttive score between the
two teams.
The two final games for the Cardinal
in the north will definitely determine
the position Stanford will hold in the
final standing of the Pacific Coast
Conference season's standing. The
team from the "Farm" has already de
feated the O. A. C. nine in two Con
ference games. Games with the Uni
versity of Washington, on the Stanford
campus May 14 and 15, will be the
final Conference matches of the year.
