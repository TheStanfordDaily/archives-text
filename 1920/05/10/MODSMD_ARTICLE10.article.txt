# SANGUINE EVENTS MARK THE EVE OF SOPH-FROSH SCRAP
## 
### 
More or less sanguine skirmishes
between the freshmen and sophomores
marked the eve of the 1922-1923 base
ball fight last night, and increased in
violence this morning. A number of
red-caps were captured by the frosh
at the Union this noon, roped and
carried far from the maddening crowd
in a trusty Andrus Taxi.
Most volcanic of all were the ef
fects of the posters distributed on the
campus by the freshmen, revealing
their evil opinions and worse inten
sions towards the overalled class. The
baseball classic itself will occur on
the diamond this afternoon at 4 p.m.
Captain Kallam, at last reports, was
facing the dilemma of choosing some
non-wreckable place for the delivery
of the marked ball that ends the fight.
Two fraternity houses have already
suffered the wrath of the opposing
clans, so that the row is not favorable
to the prospect of further damage. By
the time of the game, however, some
concrete, bomb-proof edifice will have
been designated for the final scene of
the wicked battle.
