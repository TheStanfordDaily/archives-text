## President Calls Assembly For Wednesday Morning After Return From Trip South 
### 
President Wilbur will address a Uni
versity assembly at 9 o'clock Wednes
day morning, upon the subject of the
"University." Announcement of this as
sembly was made some time ago, and
the subject was just made public today.
Wilbur's speech conies as the climax of
a series of assemblies held this quarter,
with the purpose of bringing the official
side of the University into closer con
tact with the students.
Efforts to find out just what Presi
dent Wilbur intends to emphasize in his
talk have not been successful as yet, so
that somewhat of a mystery surrounds
this assembly. Although the announced
topic of the "University" is somewhat
indefinite, it is to be supposed that Wil
bur's speech will deal with the work that
is to be done in the immediate future
rather than that which has been accom
plished in the past.
The fact, however, that the president
of the University is to speak, and that
tie is undoubtedly in a better position to
discuss any topic relating to the Uni
versity than any one else, assures a large
audience Wednesday morning.
