# THE
						ANONYMOUS COWARD
## 
### 
EVERY editor, every journalist, is honored by the receipt of anonymous
communications at one time or another but unfortunately this practice is
not confined to the journalistic profession. It applies to other walks of life
particularly where there is room for criticism and where an appeal is made
to the general public.
The writer of the anonymous communication puts himself in one of two
light depnding upon the character of his message. If harmless, such as
an inquiry concerning a university course the signature "A Student" indi
cates that the writer lacks judgment and with some sympathy we give him
the benefit of the doubt by attributing it to his extreme youth. On the other
hand when communications are received from men or women on the campus
who state that they have been in the University for four or five years some
thing better is expected. An older man or woman writes with more thought
and deliberation. The chances are that the message contained in the ano
nymous letter is direct and often personal. Convictions are strongly ex
pressed. Such communications only lead to one conclusion and that is that
the writer is a coward afraid to sign his own name, afraid of a comeback.
Such men and women have no conception of the fin m- side of Stanford where
absolute honesty is a first attribute of upright thinking.
The anonymous writer of personal communications fails to realize that
the time has passed when men and women were forced to guard their words
unduly. Freedom of speech and freedom of the press are essentials in the
Constitution of the United States. If a man is afraid to stand the consequences
of what he has to say, he shouldn't write at all. He fails to realize that his
opinion may be based upon the superficial appearances and that he may have
no conception of the truth of the matter. For liis own information, it would
be better for him to act like a man and sign his name.
The Daily Palo Alto in the past has never had any tolerance for the
anonymous letter. The source of an opinion determines its value. A half
wit might offer a criticism apparently as sane as others which have been
received by the"Daily" but the very fact that he was a half-wit would destroy
the value of the criticism. The Daily Palo Alto at no time fosters the prac
tice of anonymous signatures which seems to be so prevalent on the campus.
At all times the editor and the staff of the Daily are at the services of the
student body. We are willing to clear up any misconceptions which might
arise from matter printed in our columns. We are willing to receive any
criticism and extend apologies where apologies are due. We insist upon fair
play, however, and we insist upon the right to defend ourselves. For that
reason all anonymous communications are relegated to the waste-paper basket.
If a man isn't man enough to come out in the open he isn't worth consi
deration and can only be held in contempt.
Fair play and right thinking are essentials to right living. The Daily
Palo Alto refuses to tolerate anything which is a destructive influence to the
ideals of the University. This applies to the anonymous coward.
