# INTRA MURAL FINALS SCHEDULED THIS WEEK
## 
### 
Today starts the final week of the
intramural baseball season in the pre
liminary games, n only one league
does there remain much doubt as to
who will be the champion. This is in
League Six, in which the Alpha Delta
Phi nine is tied with the Breakers
for first place. They meet Thursday
afternoon in the only game scheduled
for that day. The game will be prob
ably one of the tightest of the sea
son as both teams are at the end of
their schedule and are in good form.
Next week the finals in the inter
group series will be played on the
local diamonds between the winners
of the separate leagues. There will
be keen competition as none of the
teams are very much ahead of any
other in legard to comparative scores.
At present no dope can be placed on
the sure outcome of the finals.
The leagues have all played four
games around, except League Three,
where the El Camino Club and Phi
Kappa Psi are tied for first place with
three games won and none lost. The
Breakers have played only three games
on account of a postponement early
in tlie season in League Six. This
game will be made up this week.
