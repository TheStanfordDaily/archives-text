# TAGS FOR BLIND SOLDIER RELIEF FUND TO BE SOLD
## 
### 
Every member of the University will
be asked to contribute 15 cents tomor
row for the aid of former service men
who lost their eye sight during the
war and who are unable to continue in
their former work. The Women's Serv
ice Board will have charge of selling
tags on the campus, and the funds so
raised will be given to the Allied Perma
nent Blind Relief War Fund.
This is a national organization which
has been handling the unprecedented
problem of the war's blind, and it is the
aim of the fund to give to the blinded
soldiers a chance for re-education and
a return to active life. In France there
still remain between one and two thou
sand blinded soldiers who need re-edu
cation and the proper equipment in order
to become useful members of societv.
In Italy there are over one thousand
blinded soldiers whose condition is par
ticularly deplorable, and the work there
is only in its inception. In the occupied
countries hundreds of blinded soldiers
have been returned to their fatherlands
penniless, homeless, and in most cases
wholly unprovided for. It is the aim
of the fund to give to the blinded sol
diers for devastated countries the same
opportunities to return to active life as
have been given to those of America,
England, France, and Belgium. Here in
America the Fund has contributed $100,-
000 to the Red Cross Institute for the
Blind and has provided supplies and in
structors for Americans at Base Hos
pitals abroad.
Realizing the fact that blinded sol
diers stay blind and that it takes a long
time and large sums of money to train
them to be self-sustaining, the fund has
for its aim the securing of an amount
sufficient to train blinded soldiers of the
Allied nations to return as nearly as
possible to their former occupations in
life. Positions are found for them, and
for those unfortunate ones who, in ad
dition to being blinded, have suffered
amputation of arms and legs, the Fund
secures benefactors who will pledge
themselves to pension these men during
their life time.
