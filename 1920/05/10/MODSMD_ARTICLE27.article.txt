# TRADITIONS COURSE TO MEET TOMORROW
## 
### 
"A Jewel Hour" is the title which
Miss Berner, director of the course in
Stanford traditions, has given to tomor
row's meeting at the Women's Club
house at 5 p. m. The hours will be de
voted to the description of Mrs. Stan
ford's rare jewels and the story of their
sale.
Miss Berner was for many years pri
vate secretary to Mrs. Stanford and has
been closely associated with the Univer
sity since its founding. The course was
begun last Tuesday and will continue
for five more weeks. It is open to all
women interested in the history and de
velopment of Stanford, but is given pri
marily to instruct women students so
that they may direct groups of freshmen
next fall.
