# JAMES GORDON SPEAKS AT JUNIOR SERVICES
## 
### 
"A man who thinks crooked cannot
live straight," asserted the Rev. James
L. Gordon, speaking in the Memorial
Church "esterday morning at the special
Junior Class services. "Too much of our
thinking is illustrated by the man who,
when asked what was his religion, re
plied that it was the same as his
church's.
" 'And what doctrine does your
church hold?' he was asked.
" 'The same as I do,' he responded.
" 'What do you both believe,' per
sisted the inquirer.
"'We both believe alike,' lie calmly
concluded.
"Link up intelligent human effort with
divine direction," continued Dr. Gordan,
"and anything is possible." The speaker
outlined the different modern concep
tions of success and showed the fala
cious nature of the American who trans
lated success into terms of money, in
fluence, or power. There is but one con
ception which has the support of reason
or religion, and that is the belief which
places the material goals of success, as
money, secondary to Christ's injunction
to us to serve our neighbor as ourself.
