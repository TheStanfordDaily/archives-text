# W.G. SHELTON TO CHOOSE JUDGES FOR SOUTHERN DEBATES
## 
### 
Judges for the debates between Stan
ford and the two southern colleges, the
University of Southern California
Occidental College, are to be chosen by
W. C. Shelton, an ex-Stanford man, and
a resident representative of each of the
opposing colleges.
Shelton was prominent in debating cir
cles at Stanford and was a winner of
the Carnot, now known as the Jofifre
medal.
T. E. Bowen, '23, C. J. Crobaugh, '20,
Paul F. Erickson, '21, and J. F. Miller,
'21, will represent Stanford in these
contests. Stanford has elected to uphold
the affirmative in the debate with Occi
dental college on May 14, and will re
verse sides in the contest with the Uni
versity of Southern California on the
following night.
The question for the first contest as
stated is, "Resolved, That the United
States should undertake military inter
vention for the establishment of internal
order in Mexico." Twenty-four hours
later, Stanford will endeavor to prove
that the United States should become
a mandatory for Mexico. The term
"mandatory" is to be used as set forth
in Article 22 of the League of Nations
covenant.
The local squad will leave for the
south on Wednesday evening. The first
debate is scheduled for Friday night in
a Los Angeles theatre.
