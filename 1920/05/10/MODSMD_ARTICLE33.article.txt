# ENCINA TANK FILLED BY NEW WATER SUPPLY
## 
### 
Encina gym's tank was filled for the
first time last Friday from the new well
recently sunk adjacent to the swimming
pool. The tilling of the tank was in the
nature of a testing of the well. As onlv
seven and a half hours were required to
Dump in the water the Board of Athletic
Control is satisfied that the well will be
a distinct improvement over the former
method of using Searsville water, which
required chemical purification. When
tlie permanent engine has been installed
the time necessary to fill the tank will
be cut down to six hours, making pos
sible the ready refilling of tlie pool at
any time.
The Board of Athletic Control has ex
pended $3,500 in sinking the well, which
lias a depth of 350 feet. Friday's per
formance of pumping 250,000 gallons of
water made no appreciable reduction
of water in the well, making it certain
that a strong How of water will always
lie on tap for gymnasium use. The
$2 200 expended for the pump makes a
total expenditure of $5,700 by the board
for the installation of the new water
system.
