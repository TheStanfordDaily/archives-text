# ENDOWMENT PLAN READY FOR 1920
## Insurance Determined Upon by Members of the Committee 
### 
Members of the Senior Class Endow
ment Committee have perfected their
final plan with regard to the endow
ment planned for the university by the
class of 1920, and will present it for
approval at the meeting next Wednesday
night, according to C. J. Tau/.er, chair
man.
Details of the plan have not been re
leased for publication, but it is known
that the endowment will be in the form
of class insurance, based on the Harvard
system. This is the only system, in the
opinion of the committee, by which the
class as a whole can furnish material aid
to its alma mater, without placing indi
vidual members under too much of a
financial obligation. •
The sum with which the seniors plan
to endow the University will not be
fixed until the meeting, but it is expected
to exceed $60,000. In order to raise
such a sum. each class member will have
to take his share of the insurance. If
the resolution presented by the com
mittee is approved, immediate steps to
organize a campaign among the seniors
for the endowment will be taken at the
meeting.
