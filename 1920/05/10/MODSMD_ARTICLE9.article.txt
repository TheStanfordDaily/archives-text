# JUNIOR CLASS OPERA SCORES BIG SUCCESS
## Music Hits Feature Annual Show; Cast and Chorus Carry Their Parts Perfectly 
### R.W. Kenny, '21 
Completely under the spell of the gay,
light-hearted music and the beauty of
the scenic effects (including the work
of the chorus make-up man), Saturday
night's audience placed its stamp of ap
proval on "A Leap Year Leap" with
volley after volley of applause. For
never did an operetta on the local stage
put an audience in a happier and more
contented frame of mind. The lively
strains of "Widows Are Wonderful" in
the finale of the Junior Opera appropri
ately marked the "happy ending" of the
joyous Junior Week festivities.
In an analysis of the success of "A
Leap Year Leap" one must first seek out
the' gifted contributors to the musical
score of the opera and give them the
premiere laurels, for it was the talented
coterie consisting of D. B. Macßoyle,
'20, ,C. W. Midgeley, '23, Russell Sewall,
'20, Milton Roberts, '21, and Harry
Wadsworth, '20, the writers of the de
lightful music and original lyrics, to
whom the opera primarily owes its
success. They produced what was un
doubtedly the best musical score that
has graced a Stanford production in
recent years.
With such a wonderful bill of musical
selections to go with the show, it was
too bad that "A Leap Year Leap" had
to live up to all recent Junior Opera
precedent in the matter of slightness of
plot. The same frothy plot structure
that has characterized the last two or
three junior musical offerings was fur
nished by the co-authors of this year's
production. However, Miss Gardner and
Miss Frickelton, with the help of Gor
don Davis, handled what slight material
they had with such a light and original
touch that much of this deficiency was
covered up. A wealth of clever lines
and ingenious twists more than kept the
stage alive with action.
Only the usual imperfections of ama
teur performances were present in the
show. A misstep in the chorus now and
then, an occasional hitch in the action,
or a poorly motivated exit did not mar
the production in any other way than to
bring it to the level of all amateur the
atricals. Much credit should go to
Coach Lester Soil). '22, for the many
clrverly arranged chorus effects and the
skilled directing that the smooth per
formance of "A Leap Year Leap" gave
evidence of.
Beauty, good voices, and a fair
amount of graceful footwork marked the
pony and beauty choruses, but the work
of the eighteen members was by no
means of uniform excellence, If the
number in both choruses had been cut
down to above twelve this could un
doubtedly have been avoided, and the
stage would not have been as crowded
as it was. With a chorus of twenty-four
on a small stage, many of the chorus
movements were bound to look more
like mass plays than dances.
Miss Loraine West, '21, as Jane, made
a thoroughly charming and adorable
leading lady. She had a sweet, rest
ful voice and a graceful quality of re
pression in her acting that made her
work thoroughly enioyable. A little
more confidence, it seemed, would have
given her the buoyancy that her part
needed.
Because of an ever-present sense of
humor and her sparkling personality,
Miss Dorothy Johnston, '21, almost out
shone the star. There was an ease and
naturalness in her manner that was all
the more noticeable because of the stiff
ness of some of the others in the cast.
Ihe tenor voice of Frank Bennett,
'19, the leading man, shared honors with
Howard Deems, '21, baritone, as being
the two best male voices in the show.
Both, however, were neither exceptional
nor even convincing as actors.
By far the most polished actor in the
men's cast was L. W. M'cDermott, '17.
who took the part of Tom. His poise
and genuine appreciation of the comedy
values in his role was refreshing. Rich
ard Pershing, '21, distinguished himself
by his spirited rendering of a clever
jazz specialty song, "Some Dream." lie
proved to be a black-face comedian of
the first order. R. W. Faville. '23, gave
;i somewhat disappointing treatment of
the interesting part of the Hindu prince.
Unquestionably the best turn of the
evening was "Beware the Love of a
Spanish Maid," sung by Seib and Miss
Ksther Mowers, '22. The lovely senori
ta, the dashing caballero, the Castanet
accompaniment, the graceful fandango,
and all the rest of the accessories for a
Spanish atmosphere, all combined to
make one of the most charming bits of
color in the opera.
Miss Frances Merrill, '22, who had
the part of the diminutive "vamp," gave
a roughish interpretation of her role that
was decidedly winning. Miss Katherine
Reid, '22, and Miss Margaret Polhamus,
'22, played their dowager roles with all
the necessary maturity.

atricals. Much credit should go to
Coach Lester Soil). '22, for the many
clrverly arranged chorus effects and the
skilled directing that the smooth per
formance of "A Leap Year Leap" gave
evidence of.
Beauty, good voices, and a fair
amount of graceful footwork marked the
pony and beauty choruses, but the work
of the eighteen members was by no
means of uniform excellence, If the
number in both choruses had been cut
down to above twelve this could un
doubtedly have been avoided, and the
stage would not have been as crowded
as it was. With a chorus of twenty-four
on a small stage, many of the chorus
movements were bound to look more
like mass plays than dances.
Miss Loraine West, '21, as Jane, made
a thoroughly charming and adorable
leading lady. She had a sweet, rest
ful voice and a graceful quality of re
pression in her acting that made her
work thoroughly enioyable. A little
more confidence, it seemed, would have
given her the buoyancy that her part
needed.
Because of an ever-present sense of
humor and her sparkling personality,
Miss Dorothy Johnston, '21, almost out
shone the star. There was an ease and
naturalness in her manner that was all
the more noticeable because of the stiff
ness of some of the others in the cast.
Ihe tenor voice of Frank Bennett,
'19, the leading man, shared honors with
Howard Deems, '21, baritone, as being
the two best male voices in the show.
Both, however, were neither exceptional
nor even convincing as actors.
By far the most polished actor in the
men's cast was L. W. M'cDermott, '17.
who took the part of Tom. His poise
and genuine appreciation of the comedy
values in his role was refreshing. Rich
ard Pershing, '21, distinguished himself
by his spirited rendering of a clever
jazz specialty song, "Some Dream." lie
proved to be a black-face comedian of
the first order. R. W. Faville. '23, gave
;i somewhat disappointing treatment of
the interesting part of the Hindu prince.
Unquestionably the best turn of the
evening was "Beware the Love of a
Spanish Maid," sung by Seib and Miss
Ksther Mowers, '22. The lovely senori
ta, the dashing caballero, the Castanet
accompaniment, the graceful fandango,
and all the rest of the accessories for a
Spanish atmosphere, all combined to
make one of the most charming bits of
color in the opera.
Miss Frances Merrill, '22, who had
the part of the diminutive "vamp," gave
a roughish interpretation of her role that
was decidedly winning. Miss Katherine
Reid, '22, and Miss Margaret Polhamus,
'22, played their dowager roles with all
the necessary maturity.
Completely under the spell of the gay,
light-hearted music and the beauty of
the scenic effects (including the work
of the chorus make-up man), Saturday
night's audience placed its stamp of ap
proval on "A Leap Year Leap" with
volley after volley of applause. For
never did an operetta on the local stage
put an audience in a happier and more
contented frame of mind. The lively
strains of "Widows Are Wonderful" in
the finale of the Junior Opera appropri
ately marked the "happy ending" of the
joyous Junior Week festivities.
In an analysis of the success of "A
Leap Year Leap" one must first seek out
the' gifted contributors to the musical
score of the opera and give them the
premiere laurels, for it was the talented
coterie consisting of D. B. Macßoyle,
'20, ,C. W. Midgeley, '23, Russell Sewall,
'20, Milton Roberts, '21, and Harry
Wadsworth, '20, the writers of the de
lightful music and original lyrics, to
whom the opera primarily owes its
success. They produced what was un
doubtedly the best musical score that
has graced a Stanford production in
recent years.
With such a wonderful bill of musical
selections to go with the show, it was
too bad that "A Leap Year Leap" had
to live up to all recent Junior Opera
precedent in the matter of slightness of
plot. The same frothy plot structure
that has characterized the last two or
three junior musical offerings was fur
nished by the co-authors of this year's
production. However, Miss Gardner and
Miss Frickelton, with the help of Gor
don Davis, handled what slight material
they had with such a light and original
touch that much of this deficiency was
covered up. A wealth of clever lines
and ingenious twists more than kept the
stage alive with action.
Only the usual imperfections of ama
teur performances were present in the
show. A misstep in the chorus now and
then, an occasional hitch in the action,
or a poorly motivated exit did not mar
the production in any other way than to
bring it to the level of all amateur the
atricals. Much credit should go to
