# PACIFIC COAST CONFERENCE MEET ENTRIES NAMED
## Sprott and Swan Expected to Create Thrills in Distances Kirksey in the Sprints 
### 
Tickets for the P. C. C. track
meet will be on sale until Thurs
day afternoon at 1 o'clock in the
ticket booth in front of the Stan
ford Union. The price of admis
sion is one dollar for students
and a dollar and a half for others.

When the starter's gun sends the
milers on their way in Saturday's Con
ference Meet, spectators will see one of
the prettiest races ever held on the local
oval, with Swan of O. A. C. and Sprott
of California fighting it out all the way
to the tape. Swan is the fastest man in
the north, and already has a win over
the U. C. runner in last year's Confer
ence Meet. However ,Sprott has vastly
improved since his defeat and is expected
to turn the tables on his opponent Sat
urday, but from the form shown by
Swan in the Stanford-O. A. C. meet,
Sprott may take second honors. These
two men also come together in the two
mile event.
Morris Kirksey should at least equal
if not better the Conference record of
9 4-5 seconds in the 100-yard dash.
Kirksey finished in 9 4-5 Saturday after
a poor start, and if he is in form for
the Coast classic he should break the
tape in 9 3-5.
