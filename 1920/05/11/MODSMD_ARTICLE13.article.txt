### 
The principles of advertising design
were explained by Harold von Schmidt
of the Foster-Kleiser Outdoor Adver
tising Company before Mr. Stamford's
advertising class this morning. Mr. von
Schmidt is considered an expert in his
particular line, that of poster making
and general illustration.
The importance of correct color bal
ance and of appropriate lettering were
explained by Mr. von Schmidt. "Color
must be balanced with care, that the
eye may not be strained or irritated, and
the message-giving value of the adver
tisement destroyed, said Mr. von
Schmidt. Lettering should be in har
mony with the nature of the advertise
ment design; light and delicate letters
for artistic advertisements, and bold,
assertive lettering for aggressive copy.
Harmony of type, lettering, and color
should be closely observed if any degree
of effectiveness is expected. Mr. von
Schmidt remarked that lettering is a
particularly difficult art, and that there
arc only five men in the United States
who are capable of first-class lettering.
