# LOCAL HIGH SCHOOLS WILL CONSOLIDATE
## 
### 
That the eight high schools of Santa
Clara county must find some basis of
consolidation into three or perhaps
four school districts for the mutual
advantage of all by the beginning of
the school year of 1921, is the sub
stance of a report adopted by the Palo
Alto-Mayfield-Stanford Union High
School Board at a meeting Friday
night. Consolidation will make it pos
sible for each of the high schools to
meet the demands of modern educa
tion, and to furnish complete equip
ment for industiial training. The local
board suggests a larger high school
district that will benefit both the stu
dents and the taxpayer, to be estab
lished either in Mountain View or in
Palo Alto.
