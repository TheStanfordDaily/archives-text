# SENIORS WILL MEET TO DISCUSS CLASS INSURANCE SYSTEM
## 
### 
Senior class officials today issued a
statement requesting one hundred per
cent attendance from class members
at the most important meeting of the
year, scheduled for tomorrow night
at 7:15, in room 214 in the English
building. The plan formulated by the
endowment committee will be put to
a resolution, and opinions are desired
from individual members on the pros
pect of inaugurating a drive for the
endowment determined upon.
Vital details of the class insurance
system, which is to be used to se
cure the funds necessary to finance
the endowment will also be arranged,
and, according to President J. A.
Sturgeon, because of the importance
of the points to be discussed, class
action cannot be taken on the matter
without the presence of a representa
tive number of seniors.
After the endowment committee has
presented its report, class members
are to vote on the first steps to be
taken in the drive. If the seniors are
successful in their proposed plan, says
Sturgeon, the class of 1920 will have
paved the way for an efficient and
helpful alumni body, and to it will
accrue the credit of having made the
first move to help the University
through its period of financial diffi
culty.
