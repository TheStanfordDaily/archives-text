# SOPHOMORES WIN ANNUAL BASEBALL FIGHT WITH BABES
## Class of 1922 Are First Ones to Hold Ball Away From Captain of Varsity Nine 
### 
When the dust had finally cleared
away from the scene of the 1922-1923
baseball fight on the football field last
night, a new precedent in his annual
contest had been set. For the first
time in the history of underclass base
ball hostilities, the ball failed to reach
the varsity baseball captain before the
end of the fight. Because the fresh
men were unable to break through the
sophomore defense and hand the ball
to Harvey Newland, '21, who was to
receive it, the 1922 class was awarded
the decision.
An indomitable willingness to fight
and fight hard characterized both sides
in one of the bloodiest class battles
that the present college generation
has seen. Following a brisk encounter
on the baseball field after Captain F.
L. Kallam, '21, had thrown up the ball,
the freshmen retired from the field
with the ball in their possession.
The final clash came at 9:30 last
night on the football field. Newland
who had been appointed to receive the
ball was on one of the yell-leader
stands. Beneath him, was a pitiful
handful of sophomores, pitiful indeed,
in comparison to the mob' of first
year men that they were holding back.
The setting was a perfect one. Auto
mobile headlight played on the settl
ing mass of battle, and set off the red
sweaters of the "S" men who were
directing the fight.
The struggle lasted for a tense half
hour, the closing gun ringing out just
as two freshmen and worked their
way over the struggling humanity to
a position where they could hand in
the ball. But by that time the ball
had disappeared. The freshman who
had the ball had been carried un
conscious from the field, the ball rest
ing safely in his pocket, and the sopho
mores were awarded the decision.
