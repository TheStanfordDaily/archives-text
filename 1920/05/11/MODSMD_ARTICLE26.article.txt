# LOCAL COLOR AND FALSE POSES
## 
### 
/COLLEGE life is filled with poses of one kind and another, some unconsci
ous and others fostered with deliberate design. The language of the
college student is essentially artificial. We talk of "queening," "getting by,"
"roughing," "cutting," "smoke-ups." None of these expressions would mean
very much in the outside world and slang is not fostered outsile college life.
It is not considered acceptable on account of its distinctiveness which we
call "collegiate." It is tolerated either because it cannot be corrected or be
cause it serves as a shortcut in business expression.
Perhaps the most false pose of all Stanford life is found in the regard
which men and women view one another. Men love to pose as "anti-queeners"
or "roughs." For some the attitude is sincere but for many it is either a
means of self-protection because they aren't popular when they have queened
or they are bashful and find it convenient to pose to camoflage the fact.
Many men will be indignant probably as they read these statements, but
don't put the shoe on unless it fits.
On the other hand there is just as much to be said in condemnation of
the women. There are a few women on the campus who demand that money
be the criterion of a good time. Fortunately these are in the minority. The
women foster the rough by admiring his manly ways. Many women dress
extravagantly to attract the attention of the "rough." The women play up
the false position of the men and in that they are partly responsible for the
short-comings of the Stanford male.
Women of the campus are often accused by both faculty and men that
they do not hold the position and wield the influence which they should. To
some degree this is true although women since the war have more com
pletely shown themselves capable of carrying out certain roles on the campus.
The student executive committee has women representatives and there is a
general recognition that women have a more serious purpose on the campus
than to entertain men. It must be said, however, that men do not encourage
th idea of women going out for campus activities.
When all is said and done, every college has its poses. Some of them
are desirable and lend "local color"; some of them Stanford has outgrown;
others threaten to be detrimental but will only prove so if we let theni. As
long as we recognize what are poses and what aren't, as long as we have
the faculty of discriminating what is sincere from that which is false, then
poses are not harmful but every man and woman in Stanford at one time
or another needs a gentle reminder of the fact that these things are super
ficial.
