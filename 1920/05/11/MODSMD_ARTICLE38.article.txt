# CARDINAL VARSITY TO PLAY SERIES WITH WASHNIGTON
## Games Thursday and Friday May Decide Conference Championship 
### 
The University of Washington base
ball varsity will arrive on the cam
pus tomorrow night for a two-game se
ries with the Cardinal nine.
The championship of the Pacific Coast
Conference may hinge on the outcome
of these two contests. Washington is
now leading, as they have lost but one
game this season. Concensus of opinion
in the north is that the University of
California cannot be figured in the run
ning because they have played so few
games. If this opinion is sustained by
the Conference tlu; Bruin victories over
Stanford will not stand and the Cardi
nal will place second to Washington with
two defeats in six starts. If the Cardi
nal tossers can win the games from
\\ ashinRton they will win the chamnion
ship.
At anv rate, the games on Thursday
and Friday afternoons should be well
worth seeing. Newlands probably will
pitch the o ening game, with l>-aner a
possible starter.
The team returned from the north in
fine condition with the exception of Dra
per, who injured his hip in one of the
northern games.
The time of the games has not been
set, but they will be played during the
afternoons of Thursday and Friday. The
admission charge will be fifty cents or
student body cards.
