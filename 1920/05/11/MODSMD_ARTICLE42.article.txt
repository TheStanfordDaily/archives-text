# COSMOPOLITAN CLUB HEARS LECTURE ON MEXICAN PROBLEM
## Dr. Jordan Speaks in, Favor of the Policy Taken by President Wilson 
### 
"President Wilson has been as near
right in his Mexican policy as any man
could be," concluded David Starr Jor
dan, in addressing the Cosmopolitan
Club last night on the Mexican prob
lem.- "Hindered by the human vultures
who seek intervention for personal
profit, Wilson's policy has been misin
terpreted. Though tne war under Polk
was unjustified, ten reasons existed for
war then to one at the present time.
Failure to adhere to the Wilson policy
of non-intervention would be an eternal
disgrace to this country."
That American intervention would
clean up Mexico and establish order was
declared by Dr. Jordan to be a fallacious
argument advanced by Americans who
look with greedy eyes upon the resources
south of the Rio Grande. No country
has ever been permanently cleaned up by
an army from another country, and the

United States should not attempt the
policy with no reasonable hope of suc
cess.
An interesting analysis was made by
the Chancellor Emeritus of the Mexican
leaders whose names have been spread
across the headlines of American news
papers. Diaz would have been consid
ered a statesman if he had not made the
mistake of holding on to the presidency
too long and of attempting to pick a
successor. The opposition aroused by
these political errors enabled Madero, a
University of California graduate, to
overthrow the Diaz regime. Madero, a
cultured gentleman, would have made an
excellent president in quiet times, but
lack of executive ability and association
with greedy relatives undermined his
power. The idol of the ignorant masses,
Villa, is capable of either good or bad.
A taste of blood or whisky makes him
the""devil who perpetrates atrocities.
Carranza is a replica of Senator Lodge,
asserted Dr. Jordan, and since we know
what the famous Senator has been doing
the last few months we can understand
the course and failure of the overthrown
Mexican president.
Practical education is the only solu
tion for the Mexican unrest. This ed
ucation should take the form not of
cultural study but of instruction in me
chanics, agriculture, and the industrial
arts. The United States should honestly
try to become a friend of Mexico, an
object foreign to our past policy marked
by insulting diplomatic notes.
