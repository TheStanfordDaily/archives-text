Meet you after
the movies"
—•Ches. Field

NOTHING like following up a good
show with a good smoke—
Chesterfield.
No ordinary cigarette, this. Mellow
as an old friend, but rich with flavor—
the kind that goes right to the spot.
Our own buyers in the Orient select
for us the choicest Turkish leaf. We
blend with this several varieties of
specially selected Domestic tobacco. This
blending—by a secret method —brings
out new qualities of flavor that other and
less expert methods fail to find.
That's what we mean by "satisfy?
—an entirely new kind of smoking
enjoyment that you get in Chesterfields
only—nowhere else; for the blend is a
closely guarded secret. It can't be
copied.
