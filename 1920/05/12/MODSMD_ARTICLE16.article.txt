# NORTHERN STARS ENTER P.C.C. MEET
## 
### 
With the entry list of every team ex
cept the University of Oregon completed,
dope on the Pacific Coast Conference
track meet to be held on the Stanford
oval next Saturday has been changed by
the northern athletes.
Gus Pope is apparently the outstand
ing star of the Washington team with
a record of 140 feet 11 inches in the dis
cus, which has only been approached by
the throw of Bart Gillespie in the meet
between O. A. C. and Stanford last Sat
urday. These two men should put up a
strong fight for first place honors with
possibilities of record throws. Two par
ticularly strong men on the State College
of Washington will be Smith, a two
niiler, and Jenne, pole vaulter. Both toolc
first places in the Seattle meet last year,
and will doubtless better their perform
ances in the meet at Stanford.
The last opportunity to obtain tickets
to the Conference track meet at the re
duced price of one dollar will be tomor
row afternoon between 1:00 and 2:30 at
the ticket booth at the Union. Tickets
will not go on sale again until the morn
ing of the meet, when the price will be
$1.50 for all seats.
