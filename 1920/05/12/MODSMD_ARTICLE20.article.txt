# STANFORD NOT SELF SUSTAINING DECLARES WILBUR
## President Discusses Condition of University's Finances at Morning Assembly

For the first time in the history of
Stanford University, its president has
taken its students into his full con
fidence as to the financial conditions
of the University, its difficulties in
the past, and its hopes for the future.
This morning, speaking in full assur
ance of the support that he knew
would be forthcoming from the as
sembled student body, President Wil
bur outlined the University's exact
financial conditions, and by his clear
cut and convincing talk won his hear
ers' admiration and support to the
extent that volley after volley of ap
plause met many statements, and re
called him after his address was fin
ished.
The outstanding feature of Dr. Wil
bur's talk was the fact that the Uni
versity has admitted itself to be no
longer self-sustaining and that it has
asked for and is receiving outside aid.
Despite the $30,000,000 endowment of
Governor and Mrs. Stanford, the in
vestment of a large portion of this
amount in gilt-edged, but low interest
bearing bonds which do not mature
until 1997, has kept the University
poor, and forced it to sell almost alt
of its landed properties, including its
Del Monte holdings, ranches in the
Sacramento valley and in the south,
and the Vinas ranch. The sale of these
has just put the University into the
position where it is clear of the debt
nicurred by the earthquake.
At present Stanford has only its bonds
and the Palo Alto Farm left, the latter
bringing in rentals of about $25,000 a
year. The problem is whether to sell,
lease, or put a new water supply on this
land, which is an unavailable asset at
present. One can clearly sec that there
are no great powers of expansion under
these conditions.
There has been great difficulty in fig
uring out the academic budget. Last
summer the problem came up of paying
the professors larger salaries. The uni
versity faced the difficulty of having no
unused resources, young alumni who
were not yet in a position to help us
and the fact that there was no public
sentiment behind us since Stanford has
always been represented to the public as
a richly endowed institution in no way
in need of financial aid.
There is a marked change in public
sentiment since the adoption of the tui
tion system which went into effect last
fall, and gifts are now being received.
Up to date they have largely been for
the medical school, medical library and
hospitals. President Wilbur then made
an announcement that $100,000 has been
donated by an anonymous friend of
the University and $100,000 by the Board
of Trustees, the sum to be used in the
erection of a building, the lower floor
of which is to be used for three new
dining halls.
With the tuition money Stanford has
some expansion prospects for a few
years. In ten year's time, how
ever. the burden of developing Stanford
must fall upon the alumni, for the U:f -
versitv is no longer self-sustaining. Its
total income each year aggregates $1,-
250,000, the dormitories bringing in a
5 per cent return on $30 000, the faculty
houses 3 1-4 return and Stanford Hos
pital 5 per cent on $500,000.
"Stanford University has as line a fac
ulty as any university in the United
States," said President Wilbur. The
fact that the National Academy of
Sciences, which elects only fifteen mem
bers a year, has just nominated three
Stanford professors to membership is
sufficient proof of this. .
President Wilbur touched-briefly upon
the housing problem and stated that the
President and the Camptroller are now
directly responsible for all University
affairs with the supervision of the Board
of Trustees. Touching upon the plans
for the future, President Wilbur an
nounced that inside of twenty years the
changes which are now contemplated in
the housing system will have been a:-
