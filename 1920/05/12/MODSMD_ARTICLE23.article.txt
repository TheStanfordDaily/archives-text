# OWNERSHIP IN STANFORD
## 
### 
PRESIDENT WILBUR'S address to the students of the University this morn
ing was one of the most inspiring messages which the student body has
ever received. It established a bond of sympathy between the President and
the students which has long been needed. It cleared up misconception which
have been prevalent for months, even years. It explained the necessity for
tuition. It made us feel that we belonged to the University, in other words
"above all keep your sense of ownership in Stanford University."
Ownership, the sense that Ce belong to the University andÂ« that we are
essential to the spirit and continuance of the University can not exist with
out responsibility. President Wilbur made clear that the responsibility for
the future of the University rests in the hands of the alumni and those of
us who will soon leave undergraduate life. It is for us to build and foster
that spirit of service and University responsibility which alone can back
our Alma Mater. The time has come when personal criticism must not
supercede constructive suggestion. For the first time the responsibility for
the future of Stanford has been definitely putin our hands. For the first
time we realize that Stanford is not an immensely wealthy institution, that
the University must depend upon gifts and endowments for its continuance.
President Wilbur in the course of his entire discussion of university
problems played constantly upon one idea. There is a reason for every step
which has been taken in university policy and there is a definite motive
behind every suggestion or change which is putin by the administration.
The President's vision is far reaching. Many will be unable to follow him
but the fact that he is always working with the best interests of the University
at heart must always remain paramount.
