# SENIOR, LOOK AHEAD
## 
### 
IN view of President Wilbur's explanation of the financial situation of the
University and the pressing need for endowment, the proposal of the
Senior Class, which will be considered tonight at 7:15 in Room 214, will be
particularly important. Class endowment is being offered for the first time.
It gives every man and woman in the class the opportunity to do something
tangible for Stanford as he leaves the University. The financial burden will
be very light and yet the amount of money which will come to the University
in the end will be of immense value.
The proposal as announced in tonight's issue of the Daily Palo Alto ad
vocates the taking out of individual policies by members of the class to
cover a period of twenty-five years. The policies will range from $250i up.
The premiums will be small. Such a plan will guard members of the class
against future requests for endowment funds. It will make possible the con
tinuance of those things which are considered so essential to undergraduate
life. It will foster a spirit of enthusiasm and sympathy between the Uni
versity and its alumni. The Class of 1920 has one of the most far-reaching
and foresighted opportunities to do something big for Stanford that any class
has had the privilege to consider. It is to be hoped that every senior man
and woman in the University will not fail to attend the meeting tonight in
Room 214. Go and hear about it, go and talk about it. Have your objections
answered and give Stanford the opportunity to enjoy the privilege of class
endowment funds which such universities as Yale, Harvard and Princeton
have today.
