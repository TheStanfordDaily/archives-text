Election to the National Academy of
Sciences, Which is comparable to simi
lar academies in European countries, is
one of the highest honors that can come
to American scientists, and since only
fifteen members are elected each year
the fact that the Stanford faculty con
tains three of these brings high honor
to the University. In addition one other
man elected was Anton Julius Carlson,
who received his doctor's degree in the
Department of Physiology here in 1903
after three years as a student in the
University and is now Professor of
Physiology in the University of Chicago.
Professor Blichfeldt receives the
honor for his contributions to the knowl
edge of pure mathematics.
Professor Ryan is elected to the Acad
emy on account of his achievements in
the field of engineering, in which he has
done especially noteworthy work in high
tension voltage. , #
Professor Willis received the distinc
tion of election to the Academy through
his contributions in the field of geology.
Stanford faculty men who belonged to
the National Academv before the recent
election included Dr. J. C. Branner, for
mer head of the Department of Geology
and President of the University; Pro
fessor D. H. Campbell of the Botany De
partment; Professor W. F. Durand of

The National Academy of Sciences
was established in 1863 for the purpose
of bringing science to the aid of the gov
ernment during the Civil War and in
the recent war following the traditions
of its founding and history the Academy
offered its services to President Wilson
in organizing science and scientific men
to assist the nation in the prosecution
of the war.
