# CAMPUS PENTATHLON PLANNED BY MALONEY
## 
### 
Track Coach Harry W. Maloney is
laying plans for an intramural pen
thatlon to be staged on the University
track in the near future. Maloney
thinks that in this way be may find
good varsity material that has hitherto
remained in the shade. The intra
mural basketball and baseball games
have brought out a number of play
ers who have in this way discovered
that they can perform in the athletic
line and there are probably many men
in the University that can do as well
on the track if they will only come
out.
The plan as outlined by Harry W.
Maloney, and Art Acker who is in
charge of intramural athletics, is to
have a meet of five events. There
will be a jump, either broad or high,
a vault, a sprint and distance run
and a weight event. All organizations
on the campus will have teams in the
meet and prizes will be awarded to the
winning teams and to the man making
the highest number of ponits.
Two meets are to be held according
to the present plans, one for varsity
track men and one for non-varsity
men. From the latter will be barred
any men who have received a letter
or numeral in track. Coach Acker is
arranging for cups to be given in
place of the plaques that will be given
for former intramural contests. There
will be two cups for each meet, one
for the highest team and one for the
highest individual point-winner. It is
hoped that some definite announce
ment may be made soon as to the date
of the penthatlon.
