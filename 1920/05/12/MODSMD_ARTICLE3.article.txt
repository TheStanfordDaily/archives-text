# Spectacular Eruption Described by Lecturer
## 
### 
The astonishing volcanic eruption of
Mt. Sukurajima, Japan, which com
menced January 14, 1914, and continued
for a year and a half, was described by
Professor William Schwartz of the Col
lege of the Pacific last night. Profes
sor Schwartz witnessed the eruption
from the city of Kagoshima, which was
at that time separated from the island
Sakurajima by a narrow bodv of water.
Sukurajima had been dormant since
1779, and was inhabited by twenty-one
thousand people.
The night of January 11 a scries of
earthquakes were felt in the region of
Kagoshima. Th,e alarmed inhabitants
were informed by the authorities at Kag
oshima that they were not volcanic
earthquakes and therefore there was no
danger. Two days later the crater burst
forth, throwing out great fonts of lava,
pumice, and gas.
"A volcano may be likened to a cham
pagne bottle," said Professor Schwartz,
"the earthquakes act as fomenting gases
within the bottle which loosen the cork
or the lid of the crater. And as soon
as it is loosened the cork or crater lid
blows off, the froth which flies into the
air is the smoke and explosive gas; the
foam which runs down the side of tlie
bottle may be compared to the lava
which pours down the volcano's sides.
Volcanos, however, unlike champagne
bottles, are self-sealing. After the crater
is scaled the volcano invariably cracks
along the shoulder. This was the course
of the eruption of Sakurajima. By Feb
ruarv. 1915. lava deposits bad connected
the island to the mainland."
