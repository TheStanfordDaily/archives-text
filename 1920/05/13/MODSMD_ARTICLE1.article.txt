# WASHINGTON AND STANFORD TEAMS MIX IN FINALS
## Winner of Two-Game Ball Series to Get P.C.C. Title if U.C. is Ruled Ineligible 
### 
Stanford Varsity tangles with the
University of Washington nine this aft
ernoon and tomorrow in the final games
of the Pacific Coast Conference series.
The Cardinal team must capture both
games if it is to figure : n the champion
ship class.
Preceding the game tomorrow an event
has been arranged that should interest
every man and woman in the University.
The committee in charge has nut di
vulged the nature of the occasion: but
has attached an air of mystery to it.
However, they have urged that as many
members of the student body be present
as can possibly come.
Washington completed a two-game se
ries with the University of California
yesterdav when the Bruin varsity took
them down the line to the tunc of 10
to 8. California took both games of
the series and their standing shows five
victories and one defeat. Washington
has suffered three losses in the Con
ference while Stanford has lost four
games our of eight played. If the Con
ference authorities rule California olT
because they have played so few games
and the Cardinal team trims the. north
erners in this two-game scries Stanford
will head the list. There is every reason
to think that the Bruins will not be
figured, and opinion in the northern uni
versities is that the title will be fought
for by Stanford and the University of
Washington.
Draper and Newlands are both in fine
fettle after the norther 1 trip, and either
one of them may be called upon to start
the opener this afternoon. Bundy and
Ratncr will do the backstopping during
the series. The same team will take the
field that played in the north last week.
Student Body cards or fifty cents will
gain admission to the game.
