# NEW RECORDS MAY BE ESTABLISHED AT P.C.C. MEET
## Fifty-Seven Coast Track Stars Have Entered in Annual Conference Oval Classic 
### 
Twelve Pacific Coast Conference rec
ords probably will be broken Saturday
when the athletes from the six Pacific
Coast universities will compete on the
Stanford Oval in the second annual Con
terence meet. These records were set
last year nt the Seattle meet, and from
the appeaerances of the dope sheet, a
dozen new marks will be set in Satur
day's classic.
The record for the 100-yard dash is
102-5 seconds, held by Captain Jess
\\ ells of Stanford. This mark undoubt
edly will be broken by Morris Kirksey,
captain-elect of the Stanford varsity,
who has 9 4-5 seconds to his crcdit. Cap
tain Wells will likely better hia
own mark of 25 2-5 seconds in the 220
low hurdles, according to the time he
made in the Stanford-California meet.
"Dink rempleton, with 6 feet 4 iivhes
to his credit, probably will break the
high jump record of 6 feet 1 3-8 inches.
One of the feature races of the day will
be the mile in which Swan of C. A. C.
and "Pesky" Sprott of California will
meet. Swan defeated the Californian
last vcar and set the time for the event
at 4:342-5. Sw an has done better than
4:25 this season, and considerable inter
est is being shown in the race.
Norman Green. Stanford's premier
pole vaultcr, stands a good chance to
come back and break the record of 11
feet 8 inches. Green has done 12 feet 8
inches this year. "Bart" Gillesnie of
Stanford and Pope of Washington Uni
versity will compete against each other
in the discus. Pope holds the record
of 132 feet 8 1-2 inches. Both men have
done better this season.
The shot-put mark of 41 feet 7 inches
undoubtedly will fall by the wayside
when Majors of California heaves the
iron ball out. llis team mate, Johnny
Merchant, is expected to set a new rec
ord in the broad jump. The present
mark is 22 feet 4 3-8 inches held by
Merchant himself, but the Blue and Gold
star lias done close to 24 feet this year.
With so many fiat men entered, the
mark of 51 fiat made by Maynard of
Stanford last year probably will he brok
en. Another Stanford record, held by
Dinkelspiel in the 220-yard dash, is like
ly to be broken by Kirksey. Dinkelsoiel's
record is 22 3-5 seconds.
Tlanner of Stanford looks to be chief
contender for the record in the javelin.
The present record is 157 feet I inch
held by Merchant of California.
The order of events is as follows:
100-yard dash, mile, 440-yard, 120-vd.

Twelve Pacific Coast Conference rec
ords probably will be broken Saturday
when the athletes from the six Pacific
Coast universities will compete on the
Stanford Oval in the second annual Con
terence meet. These records were set
last year nt the Seattle meet, and from
the appeaerances of the dope sheet, a
dozen new marks will be set in Satur
day's classic.
The record for the 100-yard dash is
102-5 seconds, held by Captain Jess
\\ ells of Stanford. This mark undoubt
edly will be broken by Morris Kirksey,
captain-elect of the Stanford varsity,
who has 9 4-5 seconds to his crcdit. Cap
tain Wells will likely better hia
own mark of 25 2-5 seconds in the 220
low hurdles, according to the time he
made in the Stanford-California meet.
"Dink rempleton, with 6 feet 4 iivhes
to his credit, probably will break the
high jump record of 6 feet 1 3-8 inches.
One of the feature races of the day will
be the mile in which Swan of C. A. C.
and "Pesky" Sprott of California will
meet. Swan defeated the Californian
last vcar and set the time for the event
at 4:342-5. Sw an has done better than
4:25 this season, and considerable inter
est is being shown in the race.
Norman Green. Stanford's premier
pole vaultcr, stands a good chance to
come back and break the record of 11
feet 8 inches. Green has done 12 feet 8
inches this year. "Bart" Gillesnie of
Stanford and Pope of Washington Uni
versity will compete against each other
in the discus. Pope holds the record
of 132 feet 8 1-2 inches. Both men have
done better this season.
The shot-put mark of 41 feet 7 inches
undoubtedly will fall by the wayside
when Majors of California heaves the
iron ball out. llis team mate, Johnny
Merchant, is expected to set a new rec
ord in the broad jump. The present
mark is 22 feet 4 3-8 inches held by
Merchant himself, but the Blue and Gold
star lias done close to 24 feet this year.
With so many fiat men entered, the
mark of 51 fiat made by Maynard of
Stanford last year probably will he brok
en. Another Stanford record, held by
Dinkelspiel in the 220-yard dash, is like
ly to be broken by Kirksey. Dinkelsoiel's
record is 22 3-5 seconds.
Tlanner of Stanford looks to be chief
contender for the record in the javelin.
The present record is 157 feet I inch
held by Merchant of California.
