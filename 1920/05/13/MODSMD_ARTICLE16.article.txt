# SEAY COMPLETES THE TRIO
## 
### 
WELFORD DUFFY SEAY will come to Stanford as the freshman football
and basketball trainer and varsity track coach. The announcement will
be received by many students on the campus with the greatest pleasure on
account of his record at the Pasadena High School. Seay was well-known
both for his pleasing personality and for his almost phenomenal succes as a
coach. During his undergraduate days at Occidental College, he made a re
markable reputation for himself as an athlete. Seay was captain of both
baseball and track during his four years.
Stanford is fortunate in picking a man of the caliber which Seay is
known to be. He completes the trie of appointments recently made to the
Univrsity. He should work in advirably with Powell, the new varsity coach,
and Culver the new Dean of Men. Culver and Seay are acquainted and have
watched each other's work. Powell thoroughly approves of the appointment
of Seay so that next year looks bright for the smooth running of men's
activities.
Such men as Powell, Seay, and Culver will prove a source of inspiration
to the students of the University. All three of them understand university
problems and more particularly the problem of the individual student. All of
them are young men, interested in Stanford and willing to work for the
best in Stanford. Their records inspire confidence. All of them are out-of
door men. All of them have common interests with the students of the Uni
versity and share the student viewpoint on issues which might arise. At all
times, the students of the University can feel that their confidence can never
be misplaced in any one of these three men. Stanford is indeed fortunate in
being able to look forward to having Powell, Stay, and Culver attached to the
faculty of the University.
