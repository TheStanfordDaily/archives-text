# EVERYBODY WORKS ON THE FARM
## 
### 
AS the Daily Palo Alto goes to press, Labor Day has starter and the stu
** dents of the University have donned their overalls and old clothes for
a few hours of steady work. Weeds are being pulled, lawns raked, gardens
shoveled. The old Stanford residence is taking on a spruce appearance for
the first time in many years and it is fitting that the work should be done
by those of us who*~love Stanford.
In the meantime the women are tackling the house. Windows are to be
washed, floors cleaned, dusting, scrubbing of the nooks and crannies which
are proverbially found only by the quickness of a woman's eye. The little
tots are to have the cleanliness which is so necessary to their getting well.
And how hungry everyone will be and here comes the good old-fashioned
barbecue! Six sheep roasted before your eyes, superintended by Sam, who
is a connoisseur of good meats. Good substantial food to supplement the
roasted meat is being prepared by the women. Luscious bread and butter,
pies like you used to get at home, something baked perhaps, it doesn't matter
much what it is because you could eat nails after Labor Day.
And when it is over, the few hours of work will soon be forgotten but
the thought that you have clone your share toward making the children of
the Stanford Clinics happier who have the good fortune to come to the Con
valescent Home will be a lasting source of satisfaction. A more fitting tri
bute to Mrs. Stanford could hardly be paid for the children of California
were her children.
