bate the affirmative of tlio question
whether or not the United States
should own and operate the railroads
of the country, against Saint Ignatius
University, (his evening, at 8 o'clock,
in (In* Little Theater. This is the
tecond of the two debates held this
week between the two contestants,
Nestoria having unanimously lost the
negative of the question lest even
ing against the college in San Fran
c'sco.
Both debates have a unique form of
procedure known as "heckling" that
has never oefore been used by Stan
ford debate though the Saint Ig
natius forensic men are familiar with
tills form of argument. It consists in
having the achate take the form of a
fceiies of "questions and answers, the
opposing side being permitted at any
time diuinj- the main speech to ask
question? of the speaker which the
latter must immediately answer. This
serves to put. a premium on the ability
to speak extemporaneously and to
think quickly while speaking. Only
one rebuttal is allowed on either side.
Nestoria will be represented this
evening by C. R. Minard, *23, Lowell
Gerson, '22, and Robert Lewis, '23.
Minard is new to society debating this
being the first lime that ho has rep
resented the society. Gerson debated
for the freshmen last years in their
contest against the sophomores. Lewis
represented Nestoria in the inter-so
ciety debate held last December.
â–  The negative team that was de
feated last evening by the Saint Ig
natius men were A. J. Albouzo, *19. 11.
W. Drown, '22, and J. T. Mc Men am in.
*20. The ability to "heckle" was
largely responsible for the favorable
tie; 'ion achieved by the Saint Ignn
.tii trio.
