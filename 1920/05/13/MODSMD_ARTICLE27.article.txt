# MILITARY UNITS WILL MAKE LAST PUBLIC SHOWING
## Tournament on May 22 to be Featured With Display of Horsemanship 
### 
A Military Tournament to be given
on the Polo Kipld the afternoon of Sat
urday, May 22, by the two local R. O.
T. C. units, will be the last public car
nival on the campus prior to the close
of the spring quarter. For the first time
since their organization the Stanford
Officers' Corps plan to make an exhibi
tion of their work in all its phases. Cap
tain L. P. Collins intends to show by
next week's tournament that an up-to
date military organization is training
Stanford students as future officers.
While the military aspect of the tour
nament will be emphasized, a number of
other events will be featured through
out the afternoon's program. The re
i cently organized polo squad will make
its initial appearance in a dual match.
The military instructors are selecting
their most skillful horsemen for a
mounted wrestling contest. Two teams
of four men each, riding horseback,
will endeavor to unseat their opponents
by any means except direct charging.
"Wild Bill," the unrideable broncho,
still defies all comers, asserts Captain
Collins. The broncho was imported a
few months ago and efforts to ride him
have only resulted in sending a stream
of horsemen to the first-aid attendant for
treatment for bruised heads.
Captain S. A. Howard wishes that all
men of the infantry company consult
the following itemized schedule which
describes the exhibition which the
"doughboys" will make a week from
Saturday:
1. Equipment Race, made by two pri
vates from each squad selected by squad
corporal. Three prizes will be awarded
to competitors, judging both speed and
accuracy in assembling parts of equip
ment.
2. Physical Drill; rapid Swedish cal
csthenics under Lieutenant lladley.
3. Platoon Games—Tea tag, jumping
circle, swat to right.
4. Tent Pitching—Six men adjudged

awarded prizes.
