# Senior Endowment Plans Approved
## Class Unanimously Accepts Proposed Means of Raising Money 
### 
Unanimous approval greeted the res
| olution of the Senior Endowment Cotn
i mittec, presented at the senior meeting
j in the English Building last night. Steps
I were immediately taken to organize a
drive for what will be the first tangible
proof of appreciation for the University
ever given it in endowment form by one
of its graduation classes.
The plan of the committee is as fol
low.-; : A sum is to be raised among class
members, holdovers, and any other stu
dents or alumni desirous of doing their
share toward forwarding the success of
the first yearly Stanford endowment.
Class insurance is the means to be used.
Individual policies, the premium on
; which amounts to but $10, payable year
ly, are to be issued. These policies have
a face value of from $250 to $300, to be
paid to the university at the expiration
of twenty-five years, the time set for the
endowment. Even death cannot annul
the payment of the money to Stanford.
The Endowment Committee appointed
Mrs. A. E. Martinsen, of the Equitable
Life Assurance Association to under
write the policies. Mrs. Martinsen will
be at the Stanford bookstore from 2
till 4 o'clock on every afternoon from
date, to explain the insurance plan and
to underwrite the insurance policies.
Members who were not present at the
meeting, together with t lie holdovers,
at'Q asked by President J. A. Sturgeon
to get in touch with some member of
the committee or with Mrs. Martinsen,
| so that the situation may be fully ex
| plained to them.
"This is one of the most important
propositions ever undertaken by student
body members, and 100 per cent loy
alty is imperative to put it across," said
Chairman C. J. Tau/.er after the meet
ing. "If the spirit of loyalty is here we
will be entirely successful. We have
often spoken of our affection for Stan
ford, and of our unlimited spirit. Now
we have a chance to prove our asser
tions. This isn't a showy way,, to be
sure. There is no fame or glory or pub- !
licity involved in it. It's just a matter j
of real spirit. Other representative uni- ,
jvcrsitics do it right along, although they;
have been as hard hit by various financial j
obligations as we have. If we don't;
i come through, it simply means that our !
boasted solicitude for the University's I
future is all talk."
