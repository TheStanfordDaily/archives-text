## 'SUNDODGERS' SHUT OUT BY STANFORD TEAM BY 6 TO 0 Washington Team Blows up in Sixth Frame Letting Five Score, Second Game Today 
### 
Stanford trounced the University of
Washington yesterday afternoon in
the first game of the series by a score
of 6 to 0. The game was fast and re
plete with loi.g hits, fancy catches by
the outfielders, and clever pitching.
Newlands, chucking for the Cardinal
nine, had the northerners well in hand
throughout the contest. Five hits were
made ort his delivery, all singles, and
he walked but one man. ' Only one
Washington man reached third base.
Newland kept the hits scattered never
allowing more than one an inning so
that he was never in trouble.
Chamberlain on the hill for Wash
ington pitched shut-out ball for five
innings, but ble,. - up with a large pop
in the sixth frame, and four hits com
bined with three errors behind him
gave Stanford five runs. He steadied
in the seventh, but was knicked for
two more hits and another run in the
eighth.
This is the second time that Cham
berlain has been defeated in four
years. He suffered his first defeat at
the hands of California in the fore
part of the week and Stanford's win
yesterday is the second. He has never
been beaten in the North.
Bundy, first up in the sixth bingled
to left field. Newland hit to Cham
berlain and should have been an easy
out at first but the first sacker lost
the throw, Newland going to third and
Bundy crossing with the first run.
Mitchell hit to deep center field for
three bags scoring Newland. Mitchell
finished the circuit when the right
fielder had trouble pitching the ball
away from the fence. Thompson walk
ed and took third on Kline's two-base
hit to left field. He scored on Rat
ner's sacrifice fly to deep left field and
Kline tallied when Kallam dropped
a two-base poke into left field.
In the eighth frame Mitchell singled
to center-field took second on Thomp
son's sacrifice hit and scored on Rat
ner's single.
