## 
### 
By winning their second unanimous
decision over Nestoria debating society
last evening. Saint Ignatius University
proved to be the victor in the dual de
bate with the local society. Both de
bates were hotly contested and the
judges had difficulty in concurring in
their decisions.
The debate last evening was held in
the Little Theater, Nestoria upholding
the affirmative of the question, "Re
solved, That the United States should
own and operate the railroads of the
country." The previous evening the
local society had upheld the opposite
side of the proposition against Saint
Ignatius in the Hays Street Auditorium,
in San Francisco. Over 800 people filled
the hall in the city and a regular pro
gram was offered in addition to the
argument.
The speakers for Nestoria last even
ing were C. R. Minard, '23, Lowell Ger
son, '22, and Robert Lewis, '23. Lewis
proved to be the mainstay of the trio de
livering his arguments with a force that
carried conviction.
They were opposed by V. Clarke, T.
Fitzpatrick, and W. Swiegert. Swie
gert was the best speaker of this group
and was especially good at "heckling,"
which was the procedure followed in
both debates.
Professor A. M. Cathcart, M. R. Kirk
wood. and W. B. Owens judged the de
bate last evening. Debate Coach Miller
L. McClintock presided.
