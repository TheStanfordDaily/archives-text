# FARM HOSPITALITY FOR OUR VISITORS
## 
### 
STANFORD has the honor accorded her of entertaining athletes from all the
institutions represented in the Pacific Coast Conference meet tomorrow
afternoon. It is with great pleasure that the Daily Palo Alto extends a hearty
welcome to the guests of the University from the students of Stanford. It is
seldom that we have the opportunity of holding such an event on the Stan
ford campus and the attendance of the student body tomorrow will mark our
appreciation of the honor accorded us.
The track meet tomorrow promises to be one of the most interesting
meets of the year. The competition will be keen as many of the entries have
made remarkable showings previously in the season. The California stars
are well-known. Their ability has been praised and their work watched with
the keenest interest. Just what the Oregon and Washington men can offer
is more or less a matter of speculation but the northern records would indi
cate that the North is going to keep the South hustling to win the meet.
Stanford had a high standard set for her when the meet was held in
Seattle last year. The University of Washington made the meet one of the
classics of the Coast and Stanford must do her part to meet the requirements.
The athletic guests of the student body expect to be entertained as they were
in the North. Every effort has been made on the part of those in charge to
make our visitors the recipients of real "Farm" hospitality and this being
true, southern hospitality may be justly famad. &
