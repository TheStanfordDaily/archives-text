# GET TOGETHER ONCE A YEAR
## 
### 
I ABOR DAY proved to be one of the most successful campus holidays which
the University has ever seen. It was successful not only from the work
accomplished but it showed the value of the students of the University hav
ing an opportunity to get together at least once a year. Almost without
exception, every man and woman there saw Stanford students whom tliey had
never laid eyes on before. Every man and woman had the opportunity to
talk to men and women to whom they had never spoken a word, although
they all lived on the campus.
Good fellowship was the significant note of the occasion. For once, every
man and woman in the University had the opportunity to work for the same
thing. It didn't make any difference whether you were an entering fresh
man or the Dean of Women, everybody worked together. And after the
work came the play. The food was just plain substantial stuff but it tasted
mighty good. The program wos more or less impromptu but it was clever
and entertaining. The crowd always helped to entertain themselves and
little more could have been asked to make the day a success. The one com
plaint was that there wasn't enough work planned for the women. Next year
it is to be hoped that some definite work will be turned over to the "500".

ONE of the arguments used by the Hoover supporters in the late cam
paign was to this effect: If Hoover is an Englishman because he lived in
England three years, then every sailor who sails the seas for three years is
a codfish. Very good; and we might add that it would be just as ridiculous
to say that everyone who spends three years in Stanford is a student.

THE sooner a certain few at Stanford realize that the fence-line which
runs around the Stanford campus doos not necessarily set the campus off
from the rest of the world, the sooner both those persons and Stanford will
be better off.

IT looks as though the men will have a decent place to eat on the campus
at last. Two hundred thousand dollars ought to do quite a bit.

IF advertising is but "the selling of a thought," most of us must be
brainless wonders.
