'21. $1,000.
Policies for the endowment range
from $275 to $2,000, Each member of

class and committee officials, since 100

Li fe, will have her headquarters at the
Stanford P.ookstore from 2:00 till 4:00

sible policies, we will not be able to
reach the goal we have set for our class,"
Chairman C. J. Tauzer, in discussing the
situation. "It is necessary to give in
proportion to what we have. It is a
matter of loyalty, and not a question of
financial consideration, which
should prompt us."
