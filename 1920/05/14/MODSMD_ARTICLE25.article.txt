# Palo Alto High School Retains Rugby Game
## 
### 
Students of the Palo Alto High School
have voted unanimously to retain
rugby football as the official game of the
school team during the coming year.
The vote was the result of the meeting
of the Rugby Union in San Francisco,
where it was seen that the peninsular
and bay city schools were in favor of
playing rugby. The boys were addressed
by Harry Wilfred Maloney, instructor
in physical 'training, and Ity George
Green, '23.
Captain Maloney said that in the
twelve years he had been at Stanford
the best athletes that the University had
were Palo Alto High School graduates.
He refuted the argument that boys who
play rugby in high school could not
make good American players in college,
saying that rugby players were given
preference on the college teams, since
they were almost invariably good, all
round athletes, possessing speed, the
"football instinct," and the qualities of
initiative and self-rgliance which make
the good American player.
