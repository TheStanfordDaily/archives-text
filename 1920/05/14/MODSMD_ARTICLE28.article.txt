## 
### 
Professor Lewis M. Terman of the
Education Department was the speaker
Wednesday at Chamber of Commerce
luncheon in Palo Alto. Much attention
has been paid to the subnormal child, he
said, but it is only recently that the ed
ucation of the gifted child has been
given serious consideration. The gifted
child is not abnormal, but is mentally
more acute than the average, and is able
to do two years' work in one. On the
basis of tests, made by Professsor Ter
man, he ascertained that the majority
of children above the average in men
tality are found in families of profes
sional men and women, whose names
show American ancestry.
The gifted child, the speaker pointed
out, is never forced to exert himself to
keep up with his class and thus often de
velops lazy habits. But to push one
child ahead is to make him abnormal.
To meet this difficulty, the city of Oak
land plans to divide school children into
three classes, according to mental capac
ity, so that each group may develop nat
urally, in acocrdance with their abilities.
