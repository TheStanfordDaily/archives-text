Stanford will have three men studying
in Belgian universities as graduate fel
lows, instead of two. as planned. George
C. Kimber, '18, who receives his de
gree from the Botany Department this
year, has been appointed to this third
fellowship.
The University has not been informed
by the sponsors of the plan, the Com
mission for Relief in Belgium, of the
reasons for the third fellowship. The
plan originall provided for two men
from each of five American colleges to
study in Belgian universities. Ten Bel
gians were to come to those five Ameri
can institutions for advanced study.
Kimber will study the production of
crops and vegetables on small holdings,
and to make investigations into the eco
nomic and social questions connected
with agriculture. Belgium is an espe
cially favorable field for the studies of
such problems.
Kimber's brother, Arthur, '17, a mem
ber of the Second Stanford Ambulance
Unit, carried the first American flag to
France after the United States entered
the war. Arthur Kimber was shot down
in the American aviation service.
