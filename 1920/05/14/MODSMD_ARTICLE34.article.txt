# PROFESSOR V.J. WEST ADDRESSES WRANGLERS
## "Character and Issues of the Coming Presidential Campaign" Topic 
### 
"The character and issues of the com
ing presidential campaign will depend on
the characters of the candidates nomi
nated," said Professor Victor West, of
the Political Science department, before
an open meeting of Wranglers Society
last night.
The different parties are not widely
divided in opinion except on foreign and
labor questions, and have consistently
refrained from making definite state
ments in this regard, according to West.
"The personnel of the parties varies
in different sections of the country, and
it is only by studying the policies of the
various candidates that we can dter
mine their platforms," said West. "This
has, so far, been a difficult thing to do
as few of the men have made definite
statements as to what they are stand
ing for."
"The present campaign differs from
previous ones in that the administrative
ability of the candidate is emphasized
rather than his political qualifications. It
is executive ability that is wanted by
the people," continued West, "for they
are primarily interested in the reduc
tion of expenses by efficient economic
development of the government, but a
certain amount of political ability is nec
essary in executing the presidential
duteis.
"With the exception of Senator John
son, the prominent characteristic of the
candidates is their administrative abili
ty. They are not politicians in the sense
that they know how to get their cam
paigns before the public, but they make
their appeal to the people through their
accomplishments and it is the task of
the public to decide between the real
worth of the acts and that which has
been accredited to them."
