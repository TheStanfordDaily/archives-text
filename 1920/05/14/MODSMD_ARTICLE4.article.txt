## 
### 
A. P. Holt, '21, varsity football cap
tain for next year, has asked all men
who expect to take up spring football
to report at the gymnasium Monday
afternoon to be fitted with uniforms.
Practice will probably start Monday;
but if not, will begin Tuesday without
fail.
Next year's varsity will be'particularly
strong in the backlield, with such men
as Holt, Campbell, Bonney, Patrick, and
Shlaudeman as a nucleus. Wilcox, a
transfer from the Middle West, will be
eligible for the squad, as will Cravens,
and Douglas, coming in from the fresh
man eleven.
The line will made up of Adams, K.
Shlaudeman, Righter, Betts, Campbell,
Butt, Pershing, Pallett, Larson, Rice,
Sproul, De Groot, Mac Alpine, and Hel
ser.
The big game next year should be
better than the one last fall. The var
sity will have a year's experience at
the American game behind it, and will
be strengthened by the new material of
the freshmen.
California, while losing their star,
"Dummy" Wells, will be augmented by
the addition of "Brick" Muller, Van
Sant, and Beam.
