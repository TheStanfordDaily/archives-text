dy-fantasy by Ben Hecht and Kenneth
Goodman. Miss Margaret Shedd, '20,

acter Those who take these parts
are:
Columbine Eleanor Anderson, '22
Harlequin Hudson Proctor, '22
Pierrot D. N. Davidson, '22
Margot Melba Berry, '22
Punchinello Arnold Bayley, '23
The play which will be used as the
curtain-raiser has not been selected,
but Lester Seib will take charge of
directing it when it is finally chosen.
The piece that the society is now con
sidering is a clever playlet with
only two characters. If this is decided
on, Seib will take one of these parts.
Stoddard Atwood, '22, who was given
the lead in "Ryland," earned much
distinction from his work in the role
of the pipe-mender in"The First
Born." His acting there gave great
promise for his future work in the
serious field of local dramatics. Other
members of the cast are experienced
amateurs although several have never
appeared on the Stanford boards be
fore Miss Shedd, who will direct this
play, has taken part in many campus
productions of recent years.
The comedy cast of "Punchinello,
the Peddlar," has Miss Eleanor Ander
son for the lead. Miss Anderson had
(he premiere role in the Sophomore
Play this year. Proctor, playing the
part of Harlequin, has an excellent
eense of comedy, as has Davidson, who
will take the part of Pierrot. Bayley,
in the title role, has had considerable
experience in playing character parts
like this. Miss Mary Largent, a well
known campus acrtess, will coach this
production.
Both casts are to report at 3 p.m.,
Monday, in the Assembly Hall, for the
first rehearsal.
