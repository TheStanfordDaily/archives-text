# CAMPUS TURNS OUT TO WORK ON LABOR DAY
## Fine Eats, Good Entertainment and "Jazz" Feature Work on Stanford Home

The traditional spirit of Stanford
predominated yesterday afternoon
when 1000 men and women of the stu
dent body put into condition the
grounds of the old Stanford home,
where the children's clinic will be
established.
Grub hoes and rakes were imple
ments for the annihilation of weeds
and shrubbery, and the mail of armor
consisted of overalls, cords and ging
hams.
The first definite and physical move
in the director of the new clinic for
University Children was heralded yes
terday afternoon. Before the conclu
sion of the spring quarter, interior
renovation work on the home will have
commenced under the auspices of Uni
versity authorities.
Spurred on by a sense of Cardinal
spirit and a pride in the institution,
workers under their respective straw
leaders rallied continuously to the
work before them. At 5:30 p.m., the
grounds surrounding the old home had
been placed in first class condition,
and preparations were made for food
and entertainment.
Grilled in trenches dug in front of
the home, six sheep were browned to
a degree of lasciousness.
University wagons, drawn by men,
and carrying a cargo of co-eds rumbled
their way from the Corporation Yards
to the home aV. 2 o'clock, where the
work was commenced immediately.
Sam McDonald won his way to fame
by the manner in which he prepared
the barbecue* mc at.
