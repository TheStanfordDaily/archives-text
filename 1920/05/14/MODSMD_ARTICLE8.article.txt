## 
### 
The special session of the Pacific
Athletic Conference which was to have
been held at Stanford this afternoon
has been indefinitely postponed due to
the inability of certain representatives
of the northern universities to attend.
Dr. A. D. Browne, president of the
conference, called the meeting a few
weeks ago to consider the more press
ing of the problems now confronting
the coast colleges.
While a special conference at this
time would have been advisable, as
serted the physical director, the ques
tions to have been discussed can be
adjusted next fall. The controversy
over the division of gate receipts at
football games which has strained the
relations of the Washington colleges
is the most serious of the problems
to be settled at the next conference
meeting.
