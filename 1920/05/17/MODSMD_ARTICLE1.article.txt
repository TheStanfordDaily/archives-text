# STANFORD MEN WIN DECISION IN U.S.C. ARGUMENT
## Crobaugh, Erickson, Bowen, Take Contest in Packed Los Angeles Assembly Hall 
### 
Stanford's debaters won from the Uni
versity of Southern California last Fri
day night in the closing argument of the
forensic season. In one of the most
closely contested discussions of the year,
C. J. Crobaugh, '20, Paul F. Erickson,
'21, and T. E. Bowen, '23, upholding the
negative for Stanford against Calvin
Lauderbock, Luis D'Elia, and Claude
Reeves of the University of Southern
California, were awarded a judges' de
cision of two to one. The debate was
held before a packed house in the L T . S.
C. Assembly Hall.
The question under discussion was as
follows: "Resolved, That the United
States should become mandatory for
Mexico." It was agreed that the term
"mandatory" was to be used as set forth
in Article 22 of the League of Nations
covenant. The interpretation of Article
22 became the main issue of the argu
ment. Bowen's challenge of his oppo
nent's last rebuttal is said to have had
much bearing on the judges' decision.
More than usual credit is due the Car
dinal trio for their victory in this contest
because of the fact that Bowen and Cro
baugh had debated with Occidental Col
lege the night before. The recent trouble
in Mexico was also a disadvantage to the
Stanford team, necessitating an entire
change in the line of attack four days be
fore the contest.
The Honorable Louis Myer, Judge of
the Superior Court, and Professors
Clewe and Barton, principals of Los An
geles high schools, acted as judges.
J. F. Miller, '21, C. J. Crobaugh, '20,
and/ T. E. Bowen, '23, in upholding the
affirmative of a Mexican question lost to
Occidental College Thursday night. The
question for the first contest pertained
to the advisability of military interven
tion in Mexico on the part of the United
States.
W. C. Shelton, an ex-Stanford man. a
winner of the Joffre medal during his
course here, assisted representatives of
the two southern colleges in selecting
judges.
