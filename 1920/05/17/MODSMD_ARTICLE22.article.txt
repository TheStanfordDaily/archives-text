# CONGRATULATIONS ON SATURDAY MEET
## 
### 
CJTANFORD may well be proud of the showing she made last Saturday in
the Pacific Coast Track Meet. Kirksey lived up to expectations in the
spectacular hundred and Wells came through in the high and low hurdles.
Hanner walked away with the javelin and Templeton did fine work in the
high jump. Every man proved himself worthy of the expectations of the
Stanford student body.
Saturday's track meet proved to be one of the finest meets ever held
in the West and it was to be regretted that more people did not take the
opportunity to see it. The Pacific Coast Conference Meet in the future is to
hold the same place in the West as similar meets lv Id in the East. The
Pacific Coast athletes have proved themselves worthy of unusual recognition.
With every Conference record smashed and the worlds record approached in
the pole vault, Saturday's track meet proved itself the classic of the West.
The real value of the meet, of course, is found in the keen competition
which it offers the athletes of the six coast universities. Every event prac
tically holds a star place as the entries are of a sufficient number to offer
stars for each event. The meet promotes the finest kind of fellowship be
tween the Pacific Coast institutions and it serves as an advertisement for
each university to the the others.
The weather proved a big feature for the northern visitors. For the
first time many Californians realized what sunshine meant when they heard
the short time in which the northern universities had been in training. Many
of the northern athletes expressed the wish that they had had the opportunity
to train on the "Farm" a month before this meet. Stanford was to be con
gratulated upon the fine showing and fight they put up and in the weather
they offered for the meet.
