# MAKE TENNIS A MAJOR SPORT
## 
### 
rpHE STANFORD TENNIS TEAM came through the week-end with flying
* colors giving the Cardinal the Pacific Coast Conference championship.
Davis, Neer, Fish and Turner represented the "Farm" against the finest tennis
stars which the northwest has to offer. Allan of Washington has developed
to be one of the most prenomenal players which the North has ever devel
oped and has attracted nation-wide attention among tennis enthusiasts.
Taylor of Washington is also well-known in tennis circles in the northwest
for the consistent game which he puts up. The Cardinal team had to go
up against keep competition and the fact that they were able to upset the
northern dope was more or less of a surprise.
It is particularly appropriate at this time to suggest that the support
given tennis at Stanford is not what it should be. Stanford has some of the
finest players here that California has to offer and yet enthusiasm for the
game here cannot be compared to that which waxes in the North. In most
universities tennis is a major sport of receives the support which a major
sport deserves. The tennis tournament in almost any university is one
of the big events of the spring quarter and it is to be regretted that this is
not true of Stanford.
In view of the record which the Stanford tennis men have made this
year not only in the recent matches but previously in the season, The Daily
Palo Alto would like to suggest that the Executive Committee consider the
question of making tennis a major sport. The men are doing the work regard
less of what standing tennis holds in the University and it is fitting that
they should receive the rcognition which they deserve.
