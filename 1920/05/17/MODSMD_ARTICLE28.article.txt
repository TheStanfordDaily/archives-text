# POLO GAME WILL FEATURE MILITARY CARNIVAL, MAY 22
## Bleachers to be Built Around Polo Field For Free Exhibition 
### 
Free seats will be provided for the
military tournament to be held on the
polo field next Saturday afternoon.
Bleachers will be arranged around the
field this week by Captain Eager to fur
nish adequate seating facilities. Space
will be left between the grandstands
to give parking space to autoists.
A unique feature of the program will
be an artillery section competition. Three
sections of sixteen men will each attempt
to prove its superiority in artillery horse
manship. The whistle will start the
race with the horses hitched to the
wheels of mounted guns. The riders
must hitch, drive a hundred yards, un
limber, and fire. Intimate familiarity
with the details of artillery work will be
required to make winning time. Stan
ford's veteran coach, Harry Maloney,
will be seen in a new role as judge of
the contest. Maloney was a member of
the" famous "Black Watch" during the
Boer War. His many years of experi
ence as a horseman in. Her Miajesty's
Cavalry will be utilized in Saturday's
contests.
For the first time, Stanford's recently
organized polo teams will be seen in ac
tion. When practice in the sport was
first started Captain L. P. Collins, polo
coach, did not plan for his team to play
any exhibition games until next fall.
The good polo material uncovered in
the practices has caused the coach to
reverse his plans and schedule Saturday's
match. The initial game will see the lo
cal poloists at their best as the match
will be in the nature of a tryout for the
Stanford team which will meet a couple
of off-campus squads the last of this
quarter.
The action of Stanford in taking m
the playing of polo has aroused much
interest throughout the sporting circles
of the state. An attempt was recently
made at the University of California to
add polo to the list of sports at the
Berkeley school, but lack of facilities de
feated the project. Stanford is the only
university west of the Atlantic states
which is represented by a polo team.
Cornell, Princeton, and Yale alone of
the Eastern colleges engage in the
activity. Conditions are peculiarly fa
vorable at Stanford for the new sport
as a large number of local men are ex
perienced horsemen. Captain Collins,
who is coaching the Cardinal poloists, is
a veteran player and well equipped to
instruct his men in the finer points of
the art.
