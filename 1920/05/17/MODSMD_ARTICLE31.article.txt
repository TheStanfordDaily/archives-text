## 
### 
Water colors of California wild flow
ers, oil paintings of landscapes, photo
graphs by the California Camera Club,
and a display of the work of the Pratt
Institute of Brooklyn, N. Y., are four
interesting exhibitions now on view at
the Stanford Art Gallery.
Included in the Pratt Institute exhibi
tion are some of the best examples of
applied art. Designs for textiles, mo
siacs, and stained glass windows are
original and striking. The paintings of
still life have a wealth of color that
makes them more interesting than the
usual groups. Interior decoration is rep
resented by several excellent water
colors. Posters and illustrations of pro
fessional character show the high level
of the work of the institute.
Eighteen oil paintings and three water
colors of California landscapes by Mrs.
J. N. Culbertson, showing the beauties
of the country around Carmel, and fifty
eight water colors of California wild
flowers by Ida M. Johnson, are exhibited
in the smaller gallery.
The photographs of the California
Camera Club have been removed to one
of the smaller galleries, where they will
be displayed this week.
