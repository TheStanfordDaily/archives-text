# WASHINGTON NINE TAKES FINAL GAME FROM CARDINAL, 5-1
## Split-Second Stop Watch Is Presented to Coach by Students 
### H.J. Borba, '22 
Washington took the final baseball
game of the season from Stanford varsi
ty by a score of 5 to 1, Friday after
noon. It was presentation day on the
local baseball lot. "Bob" Pelouze, on be
half of the students of the University,
presented Coach Evans with a split
second stop watch; Umpire O'Mara pre
sented the Washington nine with a
couple of runs; and the Stanford infield,
bitten by the same bug, threw in a couple
more tallies.
The varsity was unable to connect with
the slants of Leonard, who pitched for
the "Sun Dodgers." He set Stanford
down with five measly bingles.
Guy Draper slabbed for the Cardinal
nine and pitched a good brand of base
ball, but infield errors coupled with poor
umpiring beat him. Washington made
seven singles off his delivery.
Coach Evans was presented with a
gold stop watch, a parting gift from
the students of the University. Pelouze
made the presentation, eulogizing Evans'
work since he has been connected with
athletics. Evans' reply, "1 was for Stan
ford when I came here, and I am still
for Stanford as 1 leave," was roundly
applauded by the crowd.
Stanford drew first blood in the sec
ond inning when Ratner singled to right
and made second when the fielder failed
to gather in the ball. Kallam was out
at first base, but Crowe crashcd another
hit into the right pasture, and Ratner
scored when the fielder again lost the
ball.
Washington evened the score in the
third inning. McCrosky hit to center
field. Zamberlin sacrificed, and Torrance
hit to Tompson, who threw wildly to
first base, McCrosky crossing the rubber.
Torrance bingled to center to open the
sixth inning, Foran sacrified, and Cham
berlain bingled into the same pasture.
Torrance beat the throw to the plate, and
Chamberlain took second. Land hit to
Crowe, who threw to Kallam, catching
Chamberlain napping. He was trapped
but ran around Kallam, who had the ball
and got back to second base. He should
have been called out for running out of
the base line, but O'Mara refused to see
it that way. Land singled to right field,
crowding the bases. Leonard was re
tired at first base on a hit to Thompson,
and Chamberlain crossed the rubber. Pi
gott hit to Draper, who threw to first
base, but Pigott bowled Ratner over as
he was taking the throw. The umpire
called him safe, and two more runners
crossed the plate.
