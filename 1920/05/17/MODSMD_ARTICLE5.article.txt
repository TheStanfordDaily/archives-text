# UNIVERSITY WOMEN PLAN FIESTA OF CALIFORNIA LIFE
## 
### 
An annual Spanish festival day, remi
niscent of the early California life, is
planned for next winter or early
next spring by the organized women of
the university. This plan has grown out
of the wish of the women to organize
some activity distinctly a part of their
work in the University. Several plans
were submitted, among them being an
English May Day and a Greek Pageant,
but the Spanish fiesta has been deemed
the most appropriate for Stanford.
The fiesta will be given entirely by the
women of the University, and every
member of Stanford's women's student
body will take some part in the celebra
tion. Sapnish dances, tableaux, and
reminiscent scenes will feature the en
tertainment during the festival.
Suggestions as to the name and final
plans of the fiesta are expected from the
women of the university by the commit
tee. Elizabeth Patton, '21, vice president
of the organized women, is chairman of
the Committee on Fiesta.
