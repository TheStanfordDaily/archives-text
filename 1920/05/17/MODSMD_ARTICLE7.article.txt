"Ye Legende of Ye Damde Collegiate
Bunche" is the title of a satirical article
in the Illustrated Review which will go
on sale tomorrow. The barb of the
article's satire is pointed at the more
riotous element of Stanford's student
body and considers the history of many
of the "college pranks" that are, accord
ing to the anonymous writer, prevalent
on the campus today.
The Stanford Home for Convalescent
Children, In itself a memorial,
is an article by D. Charles Gardner,
fully describing the work that the Stan
ford Clinics are trying to do, and what
they have accomplished. Tn view of the
recent Labor Day activities, Stanford
students will be glad to gain a more
comprehensive knowledge of the Con
valescent Home.
Tn keeping with this memorial issue
is the poem by Elias O. James, which is
a song of glory to the Stanford men who
died in the war. An account of the
services which will be held on Sunday,
May 30, in the Memorial Church ac
companies the poem.
Striking pictures of recent athletic
events, the Carnival, and various people
in the limelight, hold a conspicuous place
in this Review.
An article which will make Stanford
people think, is that by H. Wilfred Ma
loney, entitled, "An Analysis of Stan
ford's Athletic Slump." in which Ma
loney asserts that the old Stanford spirit
has been lacking since the war.
