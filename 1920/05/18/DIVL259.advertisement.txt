AH the world
loves a lover —
And all discriminating
lovers of cigarettes love
Murads—
Because Murads are pure Turk
ish, the world's most famous tobacco
for cigarettes.
And the fame of Murads grows
and grows and grows—they are 100
per cent Turkish, and they are 100
per cent popular with connoisseurs
everywhere.
It is true that "ordinary"
cigarettes cost a trifle less.
