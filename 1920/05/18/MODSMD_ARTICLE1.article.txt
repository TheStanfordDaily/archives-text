# SENIOR INSURANCE LAUDED BY WILBUR AS FORWARD MOVE
## "First Class to Take Step Will Set Mark of Great Advantage," Says the President 
### 
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur's attitude on
the question of the senior endowment
was made clear by his endorsement of
the Senior Insurance Endowment plan
originated by the class of 1916 three
years ago. In view of the more impera
tive demands of the University on its
graduates of today, the stand taken by
the President is of even greater impor
tance now than ever before.
"The alumni of Stanford are watching
with much interest the proposed plan for
endowment insurance now being consid
ered by the senior class. The first class
to take definite steps to provide endow
ment for the University will set a mark
that will be of great future advantage.
Stanford University is a public institu
tion. It is our duty to administer it, to
develop it, to make it increasingly useful
and of greater service. This duty and
pleasure belongs to the friends of Stan
ford, but above all to those who have
been members of the Stanford student
body.
"The University has great hopes and
great needs. We must do all that we
can to assure the future, and each one
should take some part in it, should have
the sense of ownership and responsibil
ity. Certainly we should feel that we
had failed in some measure as a uni
versity if our graduates could not suc
ceed in contributing $5 or $10 each
year for a period of twenty years after
graduation. By so doing a considerable
fund could lie given the University for
some special purpose to be determined
bv proper committees at a later date
when the needs can be studied and the
best choice made.
"I earnestly hope that a beginning may
be made this year. It will mean deeper
interest and closer association on the
part of the Alumni and steady and re
sponsive growtli for the University.
