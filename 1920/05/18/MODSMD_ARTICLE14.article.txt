# Women Gambol-Men Gambleâ€”In Annual Scrap
## 
### 
As a fitting aftermath to the base
ball fight of last week, early last even
ing the lower fraternity district was
made hideous by female screams. All
the wild chases, the scouting parties,
the tieups and even the hand-to-hand
fighting were reproduced with women
as the principals.
When the firing had died down and
the smoke had cleared away, it was
learned that the Sigma Kappa women
had been celebrating their annual
"Senior Sneak." The object of the
junior women in the sorority was to
prevent the seniors from holding a
clandestine meeting in San Jose, pre
viously planned. Whether or not the
meeting was a success is yet to be
learned, but at any rate the entertain
ment which the women provided for
the after-supper, front-porch groups
was unqualified in its merit.
