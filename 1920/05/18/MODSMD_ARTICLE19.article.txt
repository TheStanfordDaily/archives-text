# FIFTEEN ENTER TOURNAMENT FOR RIDING ABILITY
## Special Features of Military Fete on Saturday Afternoon Will Include Horsemanship 
### 
Horsemanship of the highest order
will be displayed in the military tourna
ment next Saturday afternoon in the
quartet jumping competition. A series
of difficult jumping feats have been ar
ranged which will bring into play all
the riding ability of the entrants. A
wall, bar, brush, and straight jump will
put the local riders to test in Saturday's
race.
Fifteen Stanford horsemen will en
ter the quartet race and make a bid for
the trophy to be awarded for the best
individual horsemanship. The follow
ing men will compete for the prize in
the tournament: Coman, Young, Tal
bert, Holman, Drier, Vaughan, Hall,
Haync, Spaulding, Jenkfns, Talmage,
Wilson, Skinner, and Quinby.
Prizes will be given to the victors in
all the competitive events. Captain L.
P, Collins asserts that the trophies have
aroused much interest among the en
trants and have caused a redoubling of
the preparations of the R. O. T. C. men
for Saturday's contests. A number of
Palo Altans, including Ross, Toits,
Widemans', Varsity Theatre, and Far
rell's, have contributed prizes for the
tournament victors.
The two most famous horses on the
"Farm" will be seen in action in the
tournament. Captain Collins, reputed to
be one of the most skillful army riders
in the state, will be seen on "Dobbin."
The nature of the contests in which the
Captain will compete have not been an
nounced but his entrance will be feared
by the opposing team because of his high
ability both in horsemanship and in the
tactics of all the military contests.
The much heralded fame of "Wild
Bill" has led to the request of men out
side the R. O. T. C. unit and of Palo
Alto riders to be permitted to enter the
broncho busting battle. As the mili
tary instructor has granted the request,
the chances of "Wild Bill" being tamed
next Saturday afternoon are greatly in
creased. Several Palo Alto horsemen
who boast of experience on Texas
ranches have offered bets that the bron
cho will be ridden by one of their num
ber. "Dink" Templeton may show an
other phase to his versatile ability by
attempting an argument with the pony.
