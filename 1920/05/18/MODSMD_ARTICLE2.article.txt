# WALTER A. STEMPEL WILL MANAGE THE CAMPUS BOOKSTORE
## 
### 
Walter A. Stempel, proprietor of the
College Book Store at Ohio Wesleyan
University, has been appointed manager
of the Stanford Rook Store to succeed
Guy C. Miller, '02, who resigned last
week.
Taking over the Ohio Wesleyan Book
Store three years ago, Stempel more
than doubled its business. Illness of his
wife forced him to seek a business on
the Pacific Coast. In a recent tour of
the West Stempel visited the Stanford
campus and came into contact with the
Board of Directors of the Stanford
Book Store. On Miller's resignation he
was offered the position and has just
telegraphed his acceptance.
Stempel is a young man and has had
wide experience as a book store proprie
tor. lie has made himself extremely
popular with the students at Ohio Wes
leyan, and has thoroughly demonstrated
his business ability. The Dean of the
University recommends him highly, and
letters from prominent business men of
Ohio and Nebraska tell of his business
qualities. Stempel will come to Stan
ford as soon as he can close his busi
ness in Ohio, which will be about the
middle of June.
