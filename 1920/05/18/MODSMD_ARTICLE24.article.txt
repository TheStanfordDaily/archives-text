# ELIMINATING THE ETERNAL MONEY DEMAND
## 
### 
ANOTHER DRIVE is to be launched upon the campus. The cause is a
worthy one and most of the campus-is willing to back the Salvation Army
and lend it loyal support but for many students on the campus comes the
question of where they can get the money to give. Most students come to
college on a limited income. Many are entirely dependent upon themselves
for the money with which they go through college. There is probably a
larger percentage of men and women on the campus either earning their way
partially or entirely through college. There is a still larger class of students
who receive money from their families and do not feel in a position to ask
for more when that money is spent. The facilities and opportunities in any
college community are limited when it comes to earning money.
The larger percentage of the students of the University fall into either
one or the other of these classes. Those who do not, probably fail to see any
objection to the many drives which have been held ort the campus from their
own point of view, but everyone feels the position of the other fellow. Work
for charities is essential to a full development in college life and is a part
of the training which will serve in good stead in the outside world but some
check ought to be placed upon the obligations which a student of the Uni
versity is expected to meet.
Stanford is particularly fortunate in having a charity which is peculiarly
her own. As the old time saying goes "Charity begins at home," and this
is certainly true of Stanford. The Convalescent Home needs all the student
support which can be given and the students of the University should be
allowed to concentrate their efforts in its behalf. This can only be accomp
lished if such drives as the Y. M. C. A., Salvation Army, and general organi
zations be eliminated. Some opportunity ought to be given those who wish
to support those organizations and this could be accomplished by using the
war chest idea in which a general fund would be raised for the community
to be apportioned out as the Individual calls came. In this way Stanford
would not shirk her duty to such organizations as the Salvation Army which
deserves the support of the campus and yet the burden for the student would
be lighter. Such a plan would allow the students of the University to de
vote more of their efforts toward the Convalescent Home and yet would foster
the spirit of public service and obligation in the undergraduate life of the
University.
