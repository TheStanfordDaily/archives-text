# SETTING DRAMATIC STANDARDS
## 
### 
ANE of the most outstanding features of the Junior Opera this year was the
total absence of anything which might he considered the latst bit ob
jectionable. Many campus productions, particularly those of a lighter nature,
have come in for llieir share of criticism either 011 account of lines and jokes
or the sentiments around which the songs were built.
The opera this year proved that the campus does not demand the ques
tionable touches which have characterized dramatic productions at various
times. The concensus of campus opinion seems to indicate that this year's
opera was considered as one of the finest which has ever been seen on a
Stanford stage. The lines were clever without being smutty. The plot was
of the usual mixup but it had the attractiveness in presentation which
distinguishes every dramatic which has any claim as an artistic success. The
choruses were made up of pretty girls attractively costumed. The scenic
effects were simple yet impressive. The songs were catchy and tuneful. Much
of the credit for the tone of the opera is due Coach Lester Seib. The Junior
Class is fortunate in that it had the man who took the opportunity and made
the most of it to show what could be done along clean wholesome lines.
Dramatic standards are largely determined by what the public wants.
The theater caters to classes of people and in this the campus public made
plain what it wanted. The standard has been set in the right direction and
it is to be hoped that it will continue along the same lines. The campus
doesn't want Sunday school stuff. It doesn't want insipidly sweet and girl
ish productions. It does want something worthy of intelligent men and wo
men which, if it's a farce or musical show, has lots of pep and jazz, good
looking girls and pretty costumes. If the play is more serious then the
campus asks for good lines and the best dramatic talent the campus has to
offer. Both types have their place in college life but both must be straight
and clean in tone.
