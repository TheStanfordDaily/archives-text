# AMERICAN LEGION BEGINS NATIONAL MEMBERSHIP DRIVE
## 
### 
Beginning May 7 the American Legion
is making a national membership drive
for five days. The goal of this drive
is two million and a half members, or
a gain of a million men in five days.
In previous drives the work has been
largely on a mass plan, but this drive
will be conducted entirely on a basis
of personal solicitation by the present
members. The present Legion men will
do the actual solicitation of members
among their friends, and may obtain ap
plication blanks from any member of
the committee in charge of the drive
on the campus. Coach Harry Maloney
is the chairman of the campus commit
tee. With him on the committee are
Paul Staniford, U. B. Gilroy, and George
Green. Coach Maloney may be found
in the gymnasium at any time. Gilroy
will hold office outside the gymnasium
from four to six every afternoon. Stani
ford can be found in his office in the
Press Building any afternoon from 2
to 4.
