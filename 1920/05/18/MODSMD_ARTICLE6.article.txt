# JUNIOR YEAR BOOK WILL BE SOLD ON QUAD THURSDAY
## 
### 
Advance sale of the 1921 yearbook will
be conducted by the coupon method on
the Quad Thursday. All of the unsold
copies, about 1.000, will be disposed of
in this manner.
Manager M. A. Cline and Editor F. L.
McElroy are making every effort to
guarantee the appearance of the book on
scheduled time —that is, by the latter
part of May. McElroy journeyed to
San Francisco today to officially "put the
book to sleep." The last page of copy
has been written and is in the hands
of the publishers, and so far as is known,
nothing can bar the distribution of the
yearbooks at the time stated.
The new 1921 Quad will be the largest
of Stanford publications, including some
phases of university activity heretofore
unrecognized.
A feature of the book, according to
Fred Keast of the H. S. Crocker Com
pany of San Francisco, is its freedom
from mechanical defect. A clear white
paper and an expensive blue-black ink
promise a clarity and defmiteness of
printing and design. Many of the en
gravings, imperfect at first, were done
over and there should be no dim or hazy
cuts in the final production.
The four-color prints by Pedro J. Le
inos arc up to that artist's usual stand
ard. They arc made on a new soft
rough paper, and have special mounts.
The Quad price is $5.00.
