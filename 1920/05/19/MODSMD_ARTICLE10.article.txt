# TWO POLO SQUADS ANNOUNCED FOR MILITARY FETE
## San Francisco Military Band to Furnish Jazz Saturday Afternoon for Tournament 
### 
Presidio's military band will furnish
the latest jazz for the military fete Sat
urday afternoon on the polo field. Spe
cial arrangements have been perfected
with the commander of the San Fran
cisco fort which will enable the band
to make the trip to Stanford. Forty
pieces compose the Presidio organiza
tion, giving it the reputation of being
the best army band in the West.
Lineups for the two polo teams which
will stage the initial polo scrap Satur
day were released this morning by Man
ager James Quinby. The eight men
picked have been playing consistent polo
in the preliminary practices and are ex
pected to make a stiff battle out of the
match. The Reds will be represented
by Spenser Brown '19 (No. 1). James
Quinby '18 (2), Calvert Cecil '23 (3),
Captain L. P. Collins (4). The team of
the Whites will be composed of Major
Thompson '23 (No. 1). Archie Binns '22
(2), Edward Skinner '23 (3), and James
Hicks '23 (4).
The star of the day undoubtedly will
be Captain Collins, a veteran army play
er. Collins has played on a number of
western military quartets and has estab
lished a reputation of being a fast polo
ist. Though the other players who will
be seen on the field Saturday have only
a limited polo experience they are all
expert horsemen, which is the main
requisite for a polo player. Quinby,
who holds down No. 2 on the Red team,
and Binns, occupying the same difficult
position on the Whites, are expected to
be point winners for their squads. An
army sergeant will act as referee of the
game.
Though Stanford is not familiar with
polo the similarity in scores of the game
with American football will enable any
one acquainted with the art of the pig
skin devotees to readily understand Sat
urday's game. The match will extend
through eight period* of seven and a
half minutes each, making the length of
the contest an hour and a half. The
scoring of the game awards one point
for a goal, one-half for a safety, and a
fourth for a foul. As the number of
horses which a player may use during
the game is not limited a string of 30
ponies will be kept on hand to fur
nish the players with a stream of frcSh
mounts.
