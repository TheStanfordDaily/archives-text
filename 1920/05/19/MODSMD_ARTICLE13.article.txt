# 1921 Quad Gives "Razz" Cups For Josh Materials
## 
### 
Two large silver "razz" cups were
awarded H. O. Ormsby, '20, and Darl
Macßoyle, '20, winners of the "razz"
contest conducted by the 1921 Quad.
Macßoyle contributed much informa
tion on certain well-known campus
organizations, while Ormsby has spe
cialized on enlightening material con
cerning prominent individuals.
The new Quad will include forty
pages of joshes, "razzes," cartoons,
cuts, and dissertations of various char
acter. More than a hundred pages
were submitted to the editors.
The editor of the "Josh Section" has
kept his name a secret in order that
he might go about his work without
suspicion. His picture, however, ap
pears on the first page of the "razz"
department, and in his own words he
is "not ashamed of his work," for in
no instance does he present a "razz"
to the campus public except "on a
basis of absolute truth." He has a
complete index of all original docu
ments, and according to Editor F. L.
McElroy will be able to defend him
self against any suggestion of libel.
The editor in chief returned from
San Francisco last night with a com
plete "dummy" of the new book, show
ing the new cover and the silver and
black cover stamp. The "dummy" will
be on display at the Bookstore. Ad
vance sales of the new Quad will be
conducted tomorrow. The Year Book
will sell for $5.00.
