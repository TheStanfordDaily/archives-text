# SENIORS ASKED TO AID ENDOWMENT
## 
### 
1 lie senior class endowment commit
tee today issued an appeal to members
of the class of 1920 and to holdovers, re
questing them to underwrite their poli
cies in the Senior Endowment without
further delay. Committees are to be or
ganized to canvass each senior, but be
cause of the short period of time left for
the successful pledging of the fund, it is
imperative for a great portion of the
class to investigate the situation and
carry out their share of the work with
out awaiting solicitation.
Mrs. A. R. Martinsen, of the Equitable
Life, is at the bookstore daily between
the hours of two and four. She will be
glad to explain the project and to give
any information desired. Such a con
ference will place the individual under
no obligation, and is planned merely to
aid the committee in its work 011 the
fund.
In discussing the endowment, Profes
sor Charles D. Marx of the Engineering
Department said today, "I believe this to
be a feasible method of taking the steps
advised by Dr. Wilbur and Herbert
Hoover in forwarding the interest of the
University. It is a way more valuable
by far than the outright giving of money
by individual alumni in that it fosters
and maintains the spirit of the graduat
ing classes and brings them into a closer
association with their university."
Dr. Jordan put himself upon record as
a strong advocate of the proposed fund.
"The insurance method of raising
funds in the east has proved successful,
and I see no reason why it should not
be carried out by the Stanford seniors."
he says."I am heartily in favor of the
plan."
