# THREE-MAN TEAM WILL ENTER BIG COLLEGIATE MEET
## Wells, Kirksey and Templeton Leave Thursday For the I.C.A.A.A.A. Meet 
### 
Track Captain "Jess" Wells, Morris
Kirksey, and "Dink" Templeton will
represent Stanford in the I. C. A., A. A.
A. track meet in Philadelphia, May 28
and 29, as the result of a decision
reached last night by the Board of
Athletic Control. The men are sched
uled to leave San Francisco at 1 p.m.
tomorrow
Althoug i tlie Board has made prac
tically an even break on athletics this
year, it was decided to send the men,
and make up (be deficit on ne*t year's
schedule, which will bs much more pro
fitable than thie year has bo.? >. Al
lowances hav»» already been niride for
tennis and handball, so that this will
not in any way interfere wi:'i the
plans made for these sports.
To retain membership in the Asso
ciation it is necessary to enter a team
at least every second year, and as
Stanford did not compete last year, it
was rtcessary to do so this year to
remain a member of the I.C.A.A.A.A.
It is seldom that a university has
siu-h an array of stars as Stanford has
had in track this year, and the Board
felt that insofar as the deficit will be
easily made up next year, it would be
advisable to enter a three-man team.
Kir;c. ey has already made beuei*
time than any of the eastern track
men. His consistent rccord of ) 4-5
in the century has lot been touched
by any college in the Association, and
he constantly betters the record of
21:3 made in the 220 in last year's
meet. Wells has beaten the time in
both the low and high hurdles that
was made in last year's meet, and
Templeton's work in the high jump is
better by over an inch than has been
shown by any of Jthe eastern college
men.
The team of six men entered by the
University of California has already
started East.
Coach Harry Malcney will accompa
ny the men East.
