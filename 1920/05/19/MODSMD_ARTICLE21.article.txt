# STANFORD TO PRINCETON
## 
### 
rPHE decision of the Board of Athletic Control to send a three-man team to
the I. C. A. A. A. A. meet to be held in Philadelphia, May 28-29 with
Coach Maloney, will be received on the campus with hearty enthusiasm and
by many as a considerable surprise. Captain Wells, Tejnpleton and Kirksey
will represent Stanford at Philadelphia and it is expected that each one of
them will practically make a phenomenal showing in the hurdles, the high
jump, and the 100-yard dash.
Wells has shown up consistently in hurdles throughout the track season.
Track enthusiasts have every reason to believe that Wells will take his place
with the eastern stars which will be entered against him. Templeton was
jumping something over six feet four when the eastern institutions were go
ing crazy over six feet three last Saturday. It is practically conceded that
there isn't another man in the country in amateur athletics who can touch
Templeton in the high jump. work has attracted the attention of
the athletic world for some time. He hit nine-four consistently and has been
caught repeatedly at the world's record, nine-three. He ran the former time
two days in succession, a feat which has never been accomplished before, ac
cording to Coach Maloney.
There were several objeotions to sending a team East and the Daily Palo
Alto takes this opportunity to clear up any misconceptions which might be
prevalent in connection with sending the team. Many students are under
the impression that the money appropriated for the tennis and handball im
provements will be spent on the proposed trip. On the contrary, this money
will not be touched. In fact the larger part of it has already been spent for
the purpose it was appropriated. On the other hand, a small deficit appears
on the books at the present time but the Board of Athletic Control felt that
it was imperative and highly desirable for the University to send a team
East at this time, particularly when the track squad offered such possibilities
as Wells, Templeton, and Kirksey. The students of the University are to be
congratulated upon the decision made by the Board who were far-visioned
enough to see what this representation would mean to Stanford in the future.
