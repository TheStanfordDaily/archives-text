enough practical work was offered in the curriculum. Many students
feel that the courses offered are not of a practical nature and that theory
rather than practice is over emphasized. For the many who have shared this
feeling, the announcement of a women's vocational conference to he held
here next Saturday will be welcomed. This conference has been worked up
largely through the efforts of Miss Harriet Bradford, Dean of Women, and
she is to be congratulated upon the splendid work accomplished.
Practically all of the more important fields of women's work are to be
covered in the conference. Medical Chemistry, nursing, physical education,
journalism, art, architecture, and interior decoration will be among the sub
jects offered.
All of the speakers will be women who have made a marked success in
their work and who will be able to speak from a practical standpoint. Prac
tically all of the speakers have arranged to give time for conference if any
of the women interested in particular fields want to have further advise in
the work.
Such conferences as these serve as an incentive for many prospective
students. The idea of practical work always appeals and it is to be hoped that
the men may soon have the same opportunity which the women are to enjoy.
