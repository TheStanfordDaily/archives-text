# McCLINTOCK REVIEWS DEBATES OF SEASON
## Introduction of New System Insures Success For Future Squads 
### 
Stanford's debating season has met
with a creditable degree of success
considering the difficulties with which
the Cardinal speakers have had to
contend, according to Coach M. L. Mc-1
Clintock. "The institution of the squad
system of debate in the fall quarter
of this year has served its purpose in
laying a foundation for Stanford's
future forensic seasons and has by no
means failed in upholding the Cardinal
reputation," said McClintock, yester
day."The need for new blood in local
debating circles necessitated the
change from the old try-out system to
the present plan of selecting speakers
from registered squads. The plan has
been wholly successful in every way.
A.t least ten able men will return to
Stanford next year, from whom per
haps the best teams ever known to
represent Stanford can be chosen. It
has been the intention of the public
speaking instructors to promote as
much interest in forensic activities
as possible, and by means of the squad
system more students have been en-1
rolled in Practical Debate this yearj
than ever before. Although the con-1
tests this year have served largely to
develop speakers the results have been i
more satisfactory. At no time during
the past eight years has Stanford par
ticipated in so many debates. During 1
the winter quarter, four teams were
preparing for contests, the Joffre |
squad, the two teams participating in [
the Pacific Coast League debate, and
a fourth with Redlands University.
The schedule will be reduced next
year."
The first contest of the season, the!
annual intercollegiate debate with the
University of California, was won by
the Berkeley speakers. M. M. Gold-|
stein, '20, D. W. Goodman, '22, and
C. O. Fenlason, '20, advocating the j
adoption of the Plumm Plan were un- j
able to convince the judges that the'
proposed plan should be put into ef
fect.
Oregon University won a judges' de
cision of two to one over C. J. Cro
baugh, '20, and P. F. Erickson, '21, on;
the local platform in'fhe Pacific Coast
League contest. R. C. Fisher, '21, and
W. M. Kilpatrick, '23, failed to con- j
vince the judges in the debate with the
University of Washington on the same j
night. The closed shop was chosen as I
the issue.
A. J. Anglin, '23, L. W. I-lodges, '21,!
and T. G. Irwin, '23, in upholding the;
negative of a question on compulsory I
arbitration of railway labor disputes, I
lost to Redlands University's trio early
this quarter.
T. E. Bowen, '23, J. F. Miller, '21,
P. F. Erickson, '21, and C. J. Crobaugli,
'20, participated in debates with Oc
cidental College and the University of
Southern California last week, losing
the first and winning the latter.
The Joffre debate was one of the
most closely contested forensic events
of the year. H. G. Blote, *18, M. M.
Goldstein, '20, and W. F. Leiser, '21,
were chosen after the try-outs to rep
resent the Cardinal. Leiser, who was
entering his third season on the Joffre
squad, was suddenly called home, and
was replaced by D. W. Goodman, '22.
Both Blote and Goldstein were close
contenders for the medal, which the
judges r warded to Kenneth Williams
of California, after a twenty-minute
conference.
Coach McClintock is preparing a
schedule for next year's debating sea
son as well as a revision of the sys
tem of coaching. With the return of
nearly a dozen seasoned debaters, he
predicts a majority of Cardinal wins
for the coming season.
