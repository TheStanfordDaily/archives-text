# Pratt Exhibit Shows High Standard of Art
## 
### 
Pratt Institute of Fine and Applied
Arts, whose exhibition of work is now
being displayed in the largest room
of the Art Gallery, is one of America's
greatest schools of art, and is directed
by Walter Scott Perry, well known
lecturer and critic. The work of the
students is of a high order, some of
it having a professional character.
The Pratt Institute work is connected
with industrial art needs and is a
leader in practical technical instruc
tion. It supplies probably more stu
dents to the art industries, trained as
designers and skilled art craftsmen,
than any other school in the United
States, and the exhibit is therefore of
particular value to all educators and
students.
