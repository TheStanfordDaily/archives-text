The campaign for new members that
is being carried on by the American Le
gion this week has begun to show re
sults, but not fast enough to suit the
committee in charge of the drive on the
campus. With this in mind the commit
tee has called a meeting of Legion mem
bers from the various living groups on
the campus. The purpose of this meet
ing is to lay stress on the personal solici
tation by which the drive is being carried
on and to get as many new men as pos
sible from the various fraternities and
dormitories.
Letters are being mailed to the five
hundred members o> the Fremont Post,
enclosing an application blank, and urg
ing that each member try to get one
new member. The Fremont Post rep
resentation on the campus is about two
hundred. It is hoped by the committee
that three hundred new names will be
added to the roll of the Fremont Post of
which about a hundred and fifty should
come from the campus.
It is urged by the committee that men
who have not joined the Legion because
they expect to leave the campus soon
join immediately. When the time comes
for riie man to change his post it is only
necessary to obtain a transfer card from
the secretary. It should also be noted
that the membership fees are uniform
throughout the country.
