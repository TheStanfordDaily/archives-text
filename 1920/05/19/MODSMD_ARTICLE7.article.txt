Eighty men turned out yesterday for
the first roll call of spring football.
Suits were issued and Captain Holt gave
a lecture on the rudiments of the game
for the benefit of those who had not
played football before. There was also
preliminary practice in kicking and pass
ing. More are expected to sign up to
day, and the number of candidates prob
ably will top the hundred mark.
Coach Walter Powell will be unable
to be at Stanford for spring training,
his contract with Montana lasting un
til the end of the current school year.
Captain Holt, however, will be on hand
to take charge of the men, and lie will
keep the coach in touch with develop
ments by mail. Powell will send all
his instructions to Holt who will see
that they are carried out.
Practically all varsity men will be able
to play on next year's team with the ex

Caughey, and Levy. Besides these, there
are many men who were ineligible to
play this year, but who can now play.
Among these arc Arnett, Falk. Drake,
Henry, Wilcox, and Deems. This year's
freshman team also offers a quantity of
good material to select from.
Spring football will take the place of
regular gymnasium classes. Everyone
who turns out is expected to be out for
practice every night for the next three
weeks. Roll call will be taken.
