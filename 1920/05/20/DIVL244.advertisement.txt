"The House of Courtesy"
Reaffirming an Old
Established Policy
Nowhere in this country is competition more keen for re
gular lines of merchandise than among Pacific Coast
retail stores. This competition always is of such a nature
as to keep prices at the lowest possible level.
Constantly increasing costs during the past few years
prompt us at this time to reaffirm publicly an old-estab
lished policy which has been always strictly adhered to
in this business.
We have always endeavored to maintain lines of staple
merchandise of most dependable qualities in all depart
ments of our business, at very low prices.
The size of our five-store organization, its influence on
markets and manufacturers is proof of our strength and
capacity to lend force to this policy. Our buyers are al
ways—and particularly so today—combing the markets
carefully to get the closest prices we can, always with
due regard for qualities.
In conformity with this policy, you will find in all of our
departments staple merchandise at the lowest prices
compared with costs, that we have ever offered.
We'll stand on our fifty-five-year record of "good clothes
at prices fair to you and us" and demonstrate that such
a policy brings you honest value all of the time.
