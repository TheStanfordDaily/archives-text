WE ENJOY THE
PRIVILEGE
of taking care of the optical re
quirements of quite a number
among both the Faculty and stu
dents of Stanford University.
We want to increase that num
ber —we want more of you to
come to us —it will be to our
mutual advantage. When you
think — "GLASSES" — we want
CHINN-BERETTA impressed
upon your mind —that's why this
ad appears here twice a week —
we hope it is getting over.
