TURKISH CIGARETTE

Oriental Turkish tobacco charmed
the natives hundreds of years ago.
And when travelers visited the Orient, a new delight
awaited and thrilled them—in smoking Turkish cigarettes.
The tobacco in Murad is 100% Turkish and is
gathered from those famous lands—and Murads are both
charming and thrilling.

cigarettes—but oh, such a difference!
"Judge for yourself—!"
