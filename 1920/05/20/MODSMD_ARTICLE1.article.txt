# POPULAR COMEDY CHOSEN MASQUERS CURTAIN RAISER
## Cast for The Farewell Dinner' Includes Lester Seib, Melba Berry and Frank Bennett 
### 
"The Farewell Dinner," an ultra
modern high comcdy by Arthur Schmtz
ler, the Austrian playright, has been
chosen as the curtain raiser for the
Masquers performance on June 3. The
cast for this play was chosen today:
Anatole, Lester Seib '22; Max, Frank
Bennett '19; Mimi, Melba Berry '22.
Members of this cast have already played
leading roles in former campus produc
tions, and have all fully proven their dra
matic ability. Lester Seib had the lead
in the Sophomore Play, and in last
year's Ram's Head show. He was the
Junior Opera coach this year, and is
also coaching "The Farewell Dinner."
Bennett played the leading role in the
Ram's Head Show this year and in "A
Leap Year Leap."
Miss Berry took an active part in the
English Club play, and in the Sophomore
play.
Some changes have been made in the
cast of "Punchinello, the Pedlar," an
other one-act sketch that Masquers So
ciety is staging the same evening. Helen
Dominguez, '20, will play the part of
Margot to take the place of Melba Berry,
who- has been transferred to the other
cast. Pierrot will be played by Law
rence Hall, '20.
Effective costuming in black and white
will add to the charm of the fantasy. A
colorful and decidedly modern air will
be lent to the curtain raiser bv the up-to
date costuming and the brilliant colors
that will predominate throughout.
