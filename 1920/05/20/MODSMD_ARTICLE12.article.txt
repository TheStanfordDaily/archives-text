# FIRE ENDANGERS ALPHA DELIA PHI HOUSE; $3000 DAMAGE REPORTED
## 
### 
Fire and water damaged the Alpha Delta Phi house, 19 Lasuen, shortly
before noon today, to the extent of approximately $3000. At 11:45 this morn
ing, smoke was seen coming from the roof on the north side of the building
and an alarm was immediately turned in from the Alpha Phi house next door
to the Campus Fire Department. Within ten minutes students had collected
and completely cleared the house of all furniture and personal belongings.

A defective flue is supposed to have
been the cause of the blaze which gut
ted the entire third floor. The greatest
amount of damage was done by the
water, which flooded all three floors.
The building, which is owned by the
University and rented to the fraternity,
was completely covered by insurance
as were all the Alpha Delta Phi furni
ture and belongings. The twenty-five
members of the chapter who lived in
the house will either occupy the two

lower floors or board with other fra
ternities until the damage is repaired.
In spite of the delay in getting water
to the scene, the fire-fighting was con
ducted in a very orderly manner by
the fifty men who appeareu when the
alarm was sounded.
The last campus fires of any conse
quence were in the immediate neigh
borhood of today's conflagrationâ€”the
Alpha Phi sorority four years ago and
the Kappa Alpha Theta sorority two
years ago.
