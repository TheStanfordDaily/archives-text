# TWO BLOW GUNS FEATURE EXHIBIT IN STANFORD MUSEUM
## 
### 
Two blow-guns used by the bead hunt
ers in Central America, and a collection
of stone and clay utensils excavated from
the burial grounds of the Indians in
Costa Rica, have just been added to the
many rare exhibits in the Museum. The
blow-guns were obtained from a mining
engineer, who was in the Choco district
of Colombia mining platinum. The guns
are very old, and were repaired for Mr.
Campbell by a native chief. The ar
rows shot from the guns were poisoned
with a fluid obtained from a frog which,
while killing the beast, would leave its
llesh edible. The arrows arc wrapped
with cotton liber to fit the hollow reed
that forms the gun-barrel and arc shot
by blowing in the end of the gun.
It was said that a native chief could
blow the arrow from the gun with such
force that it would penetrate more than
an inch of wood.
Ten Costa Rican articles, estimated
to be about 400 years old, were obtained
by Pedro J. Lemos, curator of the Muse
um. from Miss Ada Montcalegrc, who is
now in Berkeley. The Costa Rican gov
ernment forbids the removal of any of
these relics, and the Museum was fortu
nate in obtaining any specimens.
The painted articles come from the dis
trict of Nicoya, on the west coast of
Costa Rica, and the pestles and grinding
stones from San Tsidro.
The jars and bowls arc different from
the Indian work of the United States and
Mexico. Even the gronding stones are
decorative, and the designs resemble an
cient Creek art.
