# Stanford Athletics Show Small Deficit
## Unexpected Expenditures For Improvements Cause of Loss 
### 
Stanford athletics made practically an
even break financially, according to the
announcement of Professor J. P.
Mitchell, treasurer of the Board of Ath
letic Control.
Approximately $66,248 lias been spent
this year, as compared with the budget,
$46,245. In other words, $20,823 more
than the original estimates has been
taken in and spent. As compared with
estimated receipts there have been losses
in two departments during the year.
Fees brought in $576.83 less than was
estimated, and $915.94 less than expected
was taken in from baseball. On the
other hand, football produced an income
of nearly $14,000 more than the esti
mated $16,000, basketball made an un
expected profit of more than $650, while
track is expected to return more than
$3 000 above the budget estimates. In
addition, the profits from the sale of
athletic supplies have been $750 more
than estimated, and miscellaneous minor
sources have netted $165 more than
counted on. The net result shows an ex
cess of $17,097.30 of receipts over the
budget. When the budget was made
there was estimated balance of $3,726 on
the profits side; this added to the
1 $17,097.30 make a total of $20,823.30.
Balancing this excess of receipts is a
j total of $21,067 of additional expendi-
I tures over the original budget, leaving
an apparent deficit of $243.70. How
ever, of the $21,000 additions to the
budget, about $13,000 have been put into
permanent improvements.
It should also be noted that $3,000
planned for the building of tennis courts
for varsity tennis players and $1,200 set
| aside for hand-ball courts are already

cared fur, and will be expended as
planned.
The $21,067 of additions to the origi
nal budget was made up of the follow
ing items: Crew, $3,000; portable
bleachers, $3 375; well and pump for
the Encina pool, $2,500; repairs to track
and entertainment for the P. C. C. track
meet, $375, loss on the Rugby trip north,
$650 (estimated) miscellaneous appropri
ations, $7,390; stadium fund. $3,858. The
statdium fund was established as a pro
vision against the necessary repairs to
the bleachers before the football game
with California year after next. Into
this fund goes lO per cent of gate re
ceipts and one-half of the unexpected
income of the year.
