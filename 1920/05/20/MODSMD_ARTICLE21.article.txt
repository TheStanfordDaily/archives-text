# SIDELIGHTS ON A COLLEGE EDUCATION
## 
### 
IT has often been said that books are the least of a college education and
when one stops to consider a few of the sidelights one is tempted to be
lieve the truth of the statement. For those of us who are soon to leave the
portals of the University, the reminiscences which are most dear are not
taken, for the most part, from the classroom. Rather studies from an ap
propriate intellectual background for the more vital interests which besiege
us on the outside.
Most of us on the "Farm" have the art of "bumming" down to a science.
We may not have the opportunity to indulge in the pastime as prequently as
we would but nevertheless we make the most of the opportunity when it
comes. A jaunt to the movies, a swim in the lake will mean more to most
of us than hours in the classroom. The memory of a day's picnic in the hills
will last longer in our minds than any chapter of the most interesting text
book written. We would 1 rather snatch a few hours to bum than we would
spend the time to get an A in the next day's exam. Sometimes we call the
science queening, sometimes it isn't labeled at all. Sometimes it's a "party"
but more often it's just "bumming."
Is this science justified? Perhaps the professor might answer in the
negative and yet there are those who would approve. It is the sidelights
of the college education which make it mean more than anything else in the
world to most of us. It is the play hours sometimes snatched unwisely which
give us the memories we can never lose. Here it is we make those friends
which are to stay with us in later years. All the romance and sentiment
connected with the four most wonderful years of our lives are wound up in
this gentle art.
Bumming is a science because there are those who have never learned
to play. Its laboratory is in the pleasure of the campus. Its students range
from the President of the University to the entering "frosh." The college
student is probably the greatest master of the art in the world and that is
one reason why the college man or woman has the edge on the rest of the
population of the world. Many of us aren't scholars who indulge in the art
but we have one asset which no book could ever give us â€”we know some
t
thing about human nature.
