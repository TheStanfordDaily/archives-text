# THE
						1921 QUAD
## 
### 
rTHE Junior Class book promises to be a little out of the ordinary from those
volumes which have been offered to the campus public in the past, and it
is wilh some interest that many on the campus are waiting for the reaction.
In the first place, the book has departed from the cardinal of the University
to a deep maroon shade for the cover. The book is beautifully bound and the
editor is to be congratulated upon the type of work which characterizes the
whole book. The color scheme has been carried out consistently with un
usual effectiveness. From an artistic standpoint the Quad is a marked suc
cess. On the other hand it will be interesting to note how strong are the
ties of tradition. The continuity of the red bound volumes was broken dur
ing the period of the war on account of the impossibility of getting the dye
for the cover and in its place the campus accepted a volume of black.
Whether the following classes will stand behind this year's Quad is a matter
of speculation. The new color is undoubtedly more beautiful but one cannot
get away from the fact that it isn't cardinal. Anyone with an eye for color
will admit that the volume has been improved by the change but one must
a.lso admit that the improvement is somewhat offset by the loss of senti
ment attached to the red bound volumes of past years.
