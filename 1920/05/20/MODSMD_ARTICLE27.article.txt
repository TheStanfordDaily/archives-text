# NOVEL ATTRACTIONS WILL FEATURE GREAT MILITARY FIELD DAY
## Mounted Tug of War Between Picked Teams Will be Headliners of Day 
### 
The staging of a military tourna
ment interesting to a public jaded
with army reviews will be the difficult
feat that will bo accomplished by the
local R. O. T. C. units next Saturday
afternoon on the polo field. Aside
from the many non-military features
of the program, the purely military
events are certain to a rouse the pub
lic's interest in the work of the uni
formed students. That Stanford main
tains the only Field Artillery Training
Corps of any western university is
known by few on the campus. Satur
day's fete will show the work of the
artillery in all its phases in conjunc
tion with the more spectacular side
of the infantry course.
An exhibition of all the field guns
of the training corps will be featured
during the afternoon. The local unit
for instruction purposes uses a varie
ty of guns, including American howitz
ers and French field pieces. A repair
truck will accompany the artillery on
the field and make a display of its
work in repairing parts of guns under
conditions similar to actual battle. A
radio set will operate in conjunction
with the gunners, illustrating the
methods employed by the artillery in
extensive field campaigns. This ex
hibition will be of particular interest
as the army troops on the Mexican
border are now utilizing the radio set
with the motor car attachments in
their operations in keeping the border
quiet.
The "dough boys" will make a race
for cash prizes in the Equipment con
test. The entrants must become uni
formed, assemble their packs, and fire
their rifles in a double-quick time.
The tent-pitching race of the infantry
men is expected to show rapid work
by the teams in throwing up the dog
tents. Two-man teams will enter the
contest, the winners of which will be
awarded prizes.
Two unique mounted races are
scheduled for the artillerymen. The
staging of a rescue race will occupy
the center of the field for a short
time. A rider mounted bare-back will
endeavor to rescue a team-mate at the
further end of the field in competition
with the other entrants. A tug of war
011 horseback will give a new variation
to the familiar battle. Teams of eight
men each will contest, first aid attend
ants being at hand ready to treat, any
unhorsed rider.
Sixteen Palo Alto and campus mer
chants have offered prizes to the suc
cessful entrants in the competitive
races. In addition to cash prizes for
a number of events, the stores have
given awards ranging from a gold col
lar button to silver cup for the victors
of the fete. Those who have donated
prizes include: Christy-Rhodes, Mc-
Slie-rry Brothers, Ross, Parrel's Shoe
Store, Ethen United Cicar Store,
Thoits, Stanford Theater, Wideman's,
and the Varsity Theater.

The "dough boys" will make a race
for cash prizes in the Equipment con
test. The entrants must become uni
formed, assemble their packs, and fire
their rifles in a double-quick time.
The tent-pitching race of the infantry
men is expected to show rapid work
by the teams in throwing up the dog
tents. Two-man teams will enter the
contest, the winners of which will be
awarded prizes.
Two unique mounted races are
scheduled for the artillerymen. The
staging of a rescue race will occupy
the center of the field for a short
time. A rider mounted bare-back will
endeavor to rescue a team-mate at the
further end of the field in competition
with the other entrants. A tug of war
011 horseback will give a new variation
to the familiar battle. Teams of eight
men each will contest, first aid attend
ants being at hand ready to treat, any
unhorsed rider.
Sixteen Palo Alto and campus mer
chants have offered prizes to the suc
cessful entrants in the competitive
races. In addition to cash prizes for
a number of events, the stores have
given awards ranging from a gold col
lar button to silver cup for the victors
of the fete. Those who have donated
prizes include: Christy-Rhodes, Mc-
Slie-rry Brothers, Ross, Parrel's Shoe
Store, Ethen United Cicar Store,
Thoits, Stanford Theater, Wideman's,
and the Varsity Theater.
