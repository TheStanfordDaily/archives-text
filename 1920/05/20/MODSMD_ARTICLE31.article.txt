# FREMONT POST URGES CLAIMS ADJUSTMENT
## Instances of Delay Are Cited; Government Investigator 'Whitewashed' Facts 
### 
Branding as "whitewash" the report
of the government investigator which
was sent to Washington recently de
claring that the disability compensa
tion cases at the United State Public
Health Service Hospital here were all
being handled satisfactorily, Fremont
Post, No. 52, American Legion, wired
contrary information to the California
Congressmen in Washington today. It
was urged that every effort be made
to secure compensation for the delay-,
ed cases. The Legion committee cited
twenty-four specific instances of long
delays, two of which have been pend
ing for nearly a year, and the others
for periods as long as six months.
The government investigation was
made recently after a stormy protest
made by Fremont Post over the neg
lect of the wounded veterans. The
telegram calling the attention of the
Congressmen to the facts of the delay
ed compensation claim case were
sent to Senator James D. Phelan and
Congressmen Hugh S. Hersman, Julius
H. Kahn, and Henry E. Barbour.
