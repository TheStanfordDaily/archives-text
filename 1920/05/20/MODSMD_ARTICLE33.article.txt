# SENIORS MUST PAY DUES TO BE ON ROLE
## 
### 
Payment of a $3.50 assessment by
all members of the Senior Class,
whether graduating or not, will be
necessary before the Class Roll may
be signed, according to a statement
of F. N. Thomas, Senior Class Trea
surer. A receipt for payment of the
assessment will be required before
members of the class will be allowed
to have their names placed in the
Class Plate. The fact that many of
the activities of the 1920 Senior Week
will not be financially successful ne
cessitates the payment of the dues
before the various committees can
proceed with the plans. Representa
tives of the various living groups will
collect the dues within the next few
days.
