# TEMPLETON, WELLS, AND KIRKSEY LEAVE FOR EASTERN MEET
## 
### 
Coach Harry Malotiey, in charge of
Stanford's three entries in the Inter-
Collegiate Amateur Athletic Association
of America meet, which will be held on
Franklin Field, Philadelphia, May 29,
are now speeding across the continent.
Although it would be next to impos
sible to win the collegiate track classic
withe only three representatives, Ma
loney expressed his confidence in the
abilities of Kirksey, Captain Wells, and
Templeton, and believes that the show
ing made by them will go far to main
tain the athletic standard set up by for
mer Cardinal teams on eastern inva
sions.
The troupe boarded the Overland Lim
ited out of San Francisco at 1 o'clock
this afternoon. They will go straight to
New York and then to Philadelphia. It
is doubtful if they will have more than
one day to train on the track before the
meet. They will be back on the cam
pus the first week of June.
With the exception of Paddock, Kirk
sey has not been even pressed all sea
son and his times in the sprints com
pare favorably with the performances of
eastern sprinters.
Wells' work in the hurdles, particu
larly in the low sticks, has been verged
on the phenomenal, and he should ren
der a good account of himself.
So far this year there have been no
startling performances in the high jump
in the east, and if Dink Templeton can
pull himself over the bar at 6 feet 4 5-8
inches as he did last Saturday, there is
no reason why he should not surprise the
eastern boys and carry off the honors.
He might also find room for a place in
the broad jump.
