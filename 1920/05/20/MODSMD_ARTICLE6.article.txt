# CARDINAL WILL BE OUT TOMORROW ON QUAD
## James Quinby Contributes Detective Tale; Harry Frantz Has Story 
### 
"28J/2 Orange Alley," by James A.
Quinby, and"The Adoption of Molly,"
by Frances L. Cooper, '21, in the May
Cardinal are two of the most notable
stories that have appeared in campus
publications this year.
In "Russia Re-Examined," by Geroid
Robinson, '17, a clear description of
Russia under the Soviet government is
presented. Robinson's explanation is
clear-cut and definite and should prove
much more illuminating than the
average run of articles on Russia. "The
Future of Oil," by B. F. Hake, '18, is
especially timely on account of the
present serious sliortagle of gasoline.
Harry Frantz, '17, has contributed
an article, "The International City."
which is an amusing account of the
Babel of tongues in Salonica. An ex
tremely interesting story of life in that
cosmopolitan city is given, and the
article is profusely illustrated with pic
tures of Salonica.
The chances of the failure in college
making a success of after-life is well
explained by Professor Lewis M. Ter
man, in "Scholarship and Success."
Professor Terman proves his point
with statistics from data accumulated
at Harvard, and a comprehensive study
of "Who's Who."
Beryl Bishop-Collett, Warren Frede
ric Lewis, '22, and Archie Binns, '22,
have contributed some noteworthy
verse. The Cardinal will go on sale
tomorrow morning.
