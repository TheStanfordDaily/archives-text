# IRISH QUESTION MAY END CAREER OF LLOYD-GEORGE
## Premier May Lose Confidence of Public if Present Irish Plan Fails, Says R. Roberts 
### 
I "Lloyd George is risking his political
life on his scheme of the solution of the
Irish question, and, with this plan ap
parently doomed to fail, England's Prime
Minister's place in the public eye seems
lost." In this statement, Rev. Richard
Roberts, who addressed a University As
sembly this morning, sums up his opin
ion of the political career of Lloyd
George.
"The present proposition of George's
meets with a great deal of opposition in
Ireland at the present time. The plan is
of Home Rule order, and with
Ireland's present condition one of vir
tual civil war, the situation does not
show any chance of improvement.
"Horace Plunkett has proposed a com
promise, which suggests that the govern
ment of Ireland be conducted similar to
that of Canada under the Dominion
Home Rule. The plan provides, how
ever, that any county in Ulster may
withhold from the Rule if it so desires.
Even should Plunkett's scheme be
be adopted and prove successful, George
will be through, politically.
"Lloyd George made his crowning
mistake when he practically agreed to
give the Home Rule Convention plan to
Ireland. The day after he had given his
questioners reason to believe that their
plan would be accepted, George an
nounced that he could only allow the
scheme to go through on condition that
Ireland accept conscription. The trage
dy of it all lay in the fact that it has
since been learned that in the event of
the Home Rule being given, Ireland
would have proposed and passed a con
scription bill on her own initiative."
In sketching the political rise of Lloyd
George, Rev. Richards said:
"George received little education, but
from intensive study he became a lawyer.
He early entered into politics, adn was
elected to the House yf Commons. He
obtained great prominence because of
his unqualified opposition to the Boer
War. Because of his attitude on this
question, his life was frequently in dan
ger. lie had a passion for the poor and
was continually endeavoring to help
those in need.
He organized a Land Commission to
look into titles and claims to property
in England. Because of this investiga
tion. George became the "best hated
man" of the property owners.
"previous to his election as Prime
Minister in 1916, George had held three
governmental positions, being Chancel
lor of the Exchequer, Minister of Mu
nitions, and, upon the death of Lord
Kitchener, became Minister of War.
"I believe the future success of Eng
land, because I know what the younger
men and women of England are doing.
"I am convinced that when the youth
of England and the youth of America
draw near they will make this the kind
of world laid out in the counsels of God."
Rev. Roberts comes from the Church
of Pilgrims, in Brooklyn, N. Y., and will
be the University preacher at Stanford
until May 30. While here he will ad
dress students and others at two week
day meetings.
Next Tuesday evening, he will lecture
on "The Background of Labor Unrest."
