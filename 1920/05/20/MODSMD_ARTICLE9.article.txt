# IRISH QUESTION MAY END CAREER OF LLOYD-GEORGE
## Premier May Lose Confidence of Public if Present Irish Plan Fails, Says R. Roberts 
### 
I "Lloyd George is risking his political
life on his scheme of the solution of the
Irish question, and, with this plan ap
parently doomed to fail, England's Prime
Minister's place in the public eye seems
lost." In this statement, Rev. Richard
Roberts, who addressed a University As
sembly this morning, sums up his opin

George.
"The present proposition of George's
meets with a great deal of opposition in
Ireland at the present time. The plan is
of Home Rule order, and with
Ireland's present condition one of vir

withhold from the Rule if it so desires.
Even should Plunkett's scheme be
be adopted and prove successful, George

questioners reason to believe that their

scheme to go through on condition that
Ireland accept conscription. The trage

since been learned that in the event of
the Home Rule being given, Ireland
would have proposed and passed a con
scription bill on her own initiative."
In sketching the political rise of Lloyd
George, Rev. Richards said:
"George received little education, but
from intensive study he became a lawyer.
He early entered into politics, adn was
elected to the House yf Commons. He
obtained great prominence because of
his unqualified opposition to the Boer
War. Because of his attitude on this
question, his life was frequently in dan
ger. lie had a passion for the poor and
was continually endeavoring to help
those in need.
He organized a Land Commission to
look into titles and claims to property
in England. Because of this investiga

man" of the property owners.
"previous to his election as Prime
Minister in 1916, George had held three
