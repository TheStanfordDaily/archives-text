"The House of Courtesy"
A Value Demonstration
In Our Men's Shop
Our advertisements in last night's papers re-stated our fifty-five year policy of
"honest value ALWAYS," not just on occasions. We will demonstrate that
five-store buying and the willingness to use this power for your benefit al
ways, are factors which bring you value of unusual merit in our stores.
Demonstration No. 1
194-7 More Men's and Young Men's Suits
$47
The quantity, 1947 suits (at one price), is more than many clothing shops
have in their entire stock at all prices. That's where Buying-Power counts —
and that's why such value can be secured in our stores.
There are quantities of HART SCHAFFNER & MARX Suits, all of fine wool
fabrics. The entire lot is new, fresh stock, including even the very newest,
advance season models for Men, Young Men, and High School lads. There
are suits of Worsteds, Cassimeres, Tweeds and Homespuns, Blue Serges, Blue
Unfinished Worsteds and Blue Flannel—not a few garments, but 1947 in all,
actively demonstrating that this institution has never forgotten its value-duty
to you.
NOTE:
The quantity stated
here is the total num
ber of suits in our
five stores at this
one price.
