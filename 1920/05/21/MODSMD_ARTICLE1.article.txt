# CZECH STUDENTS MAKE APPEAL FOR STANFORD'S HELP
## Food Drafts Urgently Needed by People in Vienna, Says Letter to Rr. R.L. Wilbur 
### 
A colony of Czecho-Slovak students
in Vienna, Austria, numbering 150, has
sent a direct appeal to the student body
at Stanford to assist them in their dire
need for food. This appeal was included
in the mail to the American Relief Ad
ministration office in New York city and
was forwarded to President Wilbur by
Mr. Hoover.
The communication from these 150
Czecho-Slovaks in Vienna to the student
body at Stanford urges Stanford men
and women to send them immediate re
lief by means of food drafts established
and administered by the American Relief
Administration under Herbert Hoover.
By this scheme, which is in successful
operation, Americans may purchase food
drafts at their banks, and these drafts
will be honored by the distribution of
food packages from the American Re
lief Warehouses which have been estab
lished in various points of central Eu
rope to the amount of the drafts. By
this means a larger amount of direct
relief through food is made possible than
is possible through any other method
for the amount of money expended.
The petition of the 150 Czecho-Slo
vakian students to Stanford students is
as follows:
"To the Student Body oj Leland Stan
ford Junior University:
"The badly affected inhabitants of the
central states of Europe, owing to the
consequences of the war, are very grate
fully making use of the aid, which the
United States of America have given to
the starving population through their
different relief actions.
"It is doubtless that one of the most
suffering countries is Austria, with the
capital Vienna, which has badly to pay
through the fault of being cause of the
breaking out of the war by the frightful
need. The general victorious nations
have taken compassion of the dying city
and have given her assistance, first and
foremost America.
"American Students! In this city of
hunger and misery there lives a consid
erable Czecho-Slovak Colony, to which
belong 150 students, your colleagues, who
are obliged to study here under great dif
ficulty. We Czecho-Slovak students in
Vienna, who are organized in our aca
demic association: "Akademicky spolek
ve Vidni," have always been good sons
of their country. Mr. Th. Garrigue
Masaryk, the leader of our nation and
public, the friend of your great Mr. W.
Wilson, was formerly the chairman of
the president of the Czecho-Slovak re-
our organization. We have always ad
mired the free, democratic nation of
America, and we have written your prin
ciples on our banner.
"It would be practically impossible to
describe to you the circumstances un
der which we live. Students as a class
being without income suffer terribly. We
belong to this student class and have
the disadvantage of being in a foreign
land.
"We call upon you, more happy col
leagues, to lielo us !
"It will be known to you, that the
American Relief Administration, 115
Broadway, New York City, founded by
Mr. Hoover, has established American
relief warehouses in Europe to the pur
pose to ease the circumstances of the
life of the hungry nations. This or
ganization enables the American asso
ciations to procure American relief
warehouse food drafts for their Euro
pean sister corporations. Help us in our
distress by sending us an American food
draft for hundred fifty (ISO) members
of our Association and we shall be saved
from a most terrible fate. Quickly!
"We are conscious of the boldness of
this resolution and have determined to
make this only under the pressure of our
really unbearable circumstances, but we
hope we are not bothering you too much
as our number of members is propor
tionately only very small—lso.
"Due to the very bad state of Austrian
exchange (one dollar equals 250 crowns)
we arc unable at present to pay for these
food packages, but if you will permit
we will pay at som efuture time when
the rates of exchange will be normal.
"We are quite confident of your fra
ternal sympathy and present you our
very best respects. Believe us, gentle
men, to remain your suffering Czecho
slovak colleagues in Vienna.
"For the committee of Akademicky
spolek vs Vidni, Vienna, I. Drachen
gasse 3, Austria."
The food drafts are purchaseable at
banks in the amounts of $10 and $50 and
call for the distribution to the persons
designated of standard packages of food.
For $10, for instance, one standard pack
age contains 24 1-2 pounds of Hour, 10
pounds of beans, 8 pounds of bacon and
8 cans of milk. While another package
bf the same value substitutes 7 1-2 pounds
of cottonseed oil for the bacon and 12
cans of milk, instead of 8. For $50 the
standard package contains 140 pounds of
flour, 50 pounds of beans, 48 cans of milk
and alternative choices supplying neces
sary fats.
Mr. Hoover's letter says that other
student bodies in Austria have sent sim
ilar petitions to groups of American stu
dents and in many case these petitions
are meeting with the warm reception
that they deserve.

for the amount of money expended.
The petition of the 150 Czecho-Slo
vakian students to Stanford students is
as follows:
"To the Student Body oj Leland Stan
ford Junior University:
"The badly affected inhabitants of the
central states of Europe, owing to the
consequences of the war, are very grate
fully making use of the aid, which the
United States of America have given to
the starving population through their
different relief actions.
"It is doubtless that one of the most
suffering countries is Austria, with the
capital Vienna, which has badly to pay
through the fault of being cause of the
breaking out of the war by the frightful
need. The general victorious nations
have taken compassion of the dying city
and have given her assistance, first and
foremost America.
"American Students! In this city of
hunger and misery there lives a consid
erable Czecho-Slovak Colony, to which
belong 150 students, your colleagues, who
are obliged to study here under great dif
ficulty. We Czecho-Slovak students in
Vienna, who are organized in our aca
demic association: "Akademicky spolek
ve Vidni," have always been good sons
of their country. Mr. Th. Garrigue
Masaryk, the leader of our nation and
public, the friend of your great Mr. W.
Wilson, was formerly the chairman of
the president of the Czecho-Slovak re-
our organization. We have always ad
mired the free, democratic nation of
America, and we have written your prin
ciples on our banner.
"It would be practically impossible to
describe to you the circumstances un
der which we live. Students as a class
being without income suffer terribly. We
belong to this student class and have
the disadvantage of being in a foreign
land.
"We call upon you, more happy col
leagues, to lielo us !
"It will be known to you, that the
American Relief Administration, 115
Broadway, New York City, founded by
Mr. Hoover, has established American
relief warehouses in Europe to the pur
pose to ease the circumstances of the
life of the hungry nations. This or
ganization enables the American asso
ciations to procure American relief
warehouse food drafts for their Euro
pean sister corporations. Help us in our
distress by sending us an American food
draft for hundred fifty (ISO) members
of our Association and we shall be saved
from a most terrible fate. Quickly!
"We are conscious of the boldness of
this resolution and have determined to
make this only under the pressure of our
really unbearable circumstances, but we
hope we are not bothering you too much
as our number of members is propor
tionately only very small—lso.
"Due to the very bad state of Austrian
exchange (one dollar equals 250 crowns)
we arc unable at present to pay for these
food packages, but if you will permit
we will pay at som efuture time when
the rates of exchange will be normal.
"We are quite confident of your fra
ternal sympathy and present you our
very best respects. Believe us, gentle
men, to remain your suffering Czecho
slovak colleagues in Vienna.
"For the committee of Akademicky
spolek vs Vidni, Vienna, I. Drachen
gasse 3, Austria."
The food drafts are purchaseable at
banks in the amounts of $10 and $50 and
call for the distribution to the persons
designated of standard packages of food.
For $10, for instance, one standard pack
age contains 24 1-2 pounds of Hour, 10
pounds of beans, 8 pounds of bacon and
8 cans of milk. While another package
bf the same value substitutes 7 1-2 pounds
of cottonseed oil for the bacon and 12
cans of milk, instead of 8. For $50 the
standard package contains 140 pounds of
flour, 50 pounds of beans, 48 cans of milk
and alternative choices supplying neces
sary fats.
Mr. Hoover's letter says that other
student bodies in Austria have sent sim
ilar petitions to groups of American stu
dents and in many case these petitions
are meeting with the warm reception
that they deserve.
A colony of Czecho-Slovak students
in Vienna, Austria, numbering 150, has
sent a direct appeal to the student body
at Stanford to assist them in their dire
need for food. This appeal was included
in the mail to the American Relief Ad
ministration office in New York city and
was forwarded to President Wilbur by
Mr. Hoover.
The communication from these 150
Czecho-Slovaks in Vienna to the student
body at Stanford urges Stanford men
and women to send them immediate re
lief by means of food drafts established
and administered by the American Relief
Administration under Herbert Hoover.
By this scheme, which is in successful
operation, Americans may purchase food
drafts at their banks, and these drafts
will be honored by the distribution of
food packages from the American Re
lief Warehouses which have been estab
lished in various points of central Eu
rope to the amount of the drafts. By
this means a larger amount of direct
relief through food is made possible than
is possible through any other method
for the amount of money expended.
