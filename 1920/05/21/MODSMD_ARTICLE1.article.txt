# CZECH STUDENTS MAKE APPEAL FOR STANFORD'S HELP
## Food Drafts Urgently Needed by People in Vienna, Says Letter to Rr. R.L. Wilbur 
### 
A colony of Czecho-Slovak students
in Vienna, Austria, numbering 150, has
sent a direct appeal to the student body
at Stanford to assist them in their dire
need for food. This appeal was included
in the mail to the American Relief Ad
ministration office in New York city and
was forwarded to President Wilbur by
Mr. Hoover.
The communication from these 150
Czecho-Slovaks in Vienna to the student
body at Stanford urges Stanford men
and women to send them immediate re
lief by means of food drafts established
and administered by the American Relief
Administration under Herbert Hoover.
By this scheme, which is in successful
operation, Americans may purchase food
drafts at their banks, and these drafts
will be honored by the distribution of
food packages from the American Re
lief Warehouses which have been estab
lished in various points of central Eu
rope to the amount of the drafts. By
this means a larger amount of direct
relief through food is made possible than
is possible through any other method
for the amount of money expended.
The petition of the 150 Czecho-Slo
vakian students to Stanford students is
as follows:
"To the Student Body oj Leland Stan
ford Junior University:
"The badly affected inhabitants of the
central states of Europe, owing to the
consequences of the war, are very grate
fully making use of the aid, which the
United States of America have given to
the starving population through their
different relief actions.
"It is doubtless that one of the most
suffering countries is Austria, with the
capital Vienna, which has badly to pay
through the fault of being cause of the
breaking out of the war by the frightful
need. The general victorious nations
have taken compassion of the dying city
and have given her assistance, first and
foremost America.
"American Students! In this city of
hunger and misery there lives a consid
erable Czecho-Slovak Colony, to which
belong 150 students, your colleagues, who
are obliged to study here under great dif
ficulty. We Czecho-Slovak students in
Vienna, who are organized in our aca
demic association: "Akademicky spolek
ve Vidni," have always been good sons
of their country. Mr. Th. Garrigue
Masaryk, the leader of our nation and
public, the friend of your great Mr. W.
Wilson, was formerly the chairman of
the president of the Czecho-Slovak re-
