# Dr. Roberts Will Give Lecture On Decoration Day
## 
### 
Relatives and friends of the sixty-nine
Stanford students who lost their lives
in the great war will be given tickets to
the Memorial Day services in the Church
Sunday, May 30. Families of the facul
ty, friends, and workmen of the Uni
versity will be admitted to the galleries,
as the entire lower floor will be re
served for students, faculty, alumnae,
and trustees.
Suggested by the fact that Memorial
Day this year falls on Sunday, Chaolain
Gardner has arranged church services
for the morning and afternoon. Dr
Richard Roberts will speak in the aft
ernoon, but the morning service will be
composed entirely of music. Thirty
members of the San Francisco Sym
phony Orchestra and the University
Choir, under the direction of Organist
Allen, will give Verdi's "Incomparable
Requiem." The Glee Club will sing in
the afternoon.
