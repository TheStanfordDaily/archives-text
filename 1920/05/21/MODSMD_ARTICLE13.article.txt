# FARCE TRYOUTS WILL UNCOVER NEW TALENT
## Coach Davis Expects to Find New Dramatic Material in Farce Trials 
### 
Coach Gordon Davis, '18, is starting
the annual search for talent that begins
usually just before the Senior Farce
trv-outs each year. One of the func
tions of the Senior Farce is to uncover
the new dramatic ability on the campus
for the following year. The try-outs
next Monday afternoon in the Assembly
Hall from 2:00 to 4:00 will thus give
many a chance to get a start in the field
of local dramatics.
The type of play that is usually picked
for the Senior Farce has a variety of
parts open to try-outees of different
kinds of talent. There are always two
or three interesting character roles and
several light comedy bits in these farces.
Davis and the committee are considering
just that sort of modern comedy at pres
ent, and its title will be definitely an
nounced Monday morning.
Under Davis' efficient system of
coaching, the members of the Senior
Farce will have little to fear from loss
of time in rehearsal work. Although
the show is to be produced on the night
following the last day of finals, Davis,
through his previous experience in stag
ing Senior Farces, has arranged the
practice schedule so that no scholastic
hardship will be worked on any member
of the cast.
All students in the University, with
the exception of Freshman women, arc
eligible to try-out for the 1920 show.
