# STANFORD BOXING TEAM TO COMPETE IN LOS ANGELES
## 
### 
Coach Joe Murphy will take his stable
of boxers to Los Angeles on May 30th
to engage in two tournaments. A series
of return bouts has been arranged with
the University of Southern California.
The Los Angeles Athletic Club will also
provide an evening of entertainment for
the Cardinal mitt wielders.
Murphy is putting the boxers through
a stiff piece of training to condition
them for the southern bouts, and he is
confident that the Stanford boxers will
win a majority of their contests in the
south. The men who will compose the
team have not been definitely chosen,
but the best men in each class will com
pete.
