nia tennis team will not be able to meet
the Stanford women in a tournament on
Saturday, acocrding to a telegram re
ceived from the southern university late
yesterday afternoon.
No definite reason for calling off the
meet were given in the message. It is
believed that difficulty in obtaining play
ers from each class may be responsible
for the action, as the University of

it is not representative of the four class
es. A later date may be set for the
tournament if satisfactory arrangements
can be made between the two universi
ties.
The class tournament now in progress
