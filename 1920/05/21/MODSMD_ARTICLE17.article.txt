exhibition is scheduled for the interi n
between halves of the contest.
The prizes attached to all the com
petitive events have stimulated in
terest among all the entrants, and will
be an effective spur for exciting com

ing contest, particularly, brings into
nlay all the horsemanship of Stan
fords best riders. A series of jumps,
including the wall, bar. brush, and the
straight tests, will be the means of
judging the riders and of awarding the
prize to the most expert horseman.
Fifteen riders will enter the compe
tition.
The military phases of tomorrow's
fete will be surprisingly interesting to
those unfamiliar with the local mili
tary units. Stanford possesses one
of the Feld Artillery companies main
tained by universities in the campany.
No other college in the West attempts
any artillery work. The local artillery
plant is valued at $000,000. The equip

motorcycles and touring cars. The
best of the ninety horses of the unit
will be on the field tomorrow after
noon.
Moving pictures of the fete's events
will be taken by a director of Hearst
Current Events Weekly. Stanford will
receive an unusual advertisement by
the shawing of the films throughout
the nation. The selection of Stanford
was made by the movie director for
the filming of the tournament as the
local companies possess the most com
plete military equipment of any West
ern university.
All phases of the work of the
most completely equipped mili
tary units of any western uni
versity will be shown in the mili
tary fete tomorrow afternoon on
the Polo Field. The complete pro
gram follows:
1. Squad competition, infantry,
close and extended order.
2. Platoon drill, infantry, close
and extended order.
3. Physical drill.
4. Section competition.
5. Mounted wrestling, field artil
lery ; teams of four men each.
7. Mounted rescue race, field ar
tillery.
8. Equipment race, infantry.
9. Mounted tug of war, field ar
tillery.
10. Tent pitching, infantry.
11. Horse jumping.
12. Exhibition tractor driving.
13. Bucking horse.
14. Polo game, Whites vs. Reds.

For the past five weeks under the
direction of Captain L. P. Collins,
commandant of the Field Artillery
company, the military units have been
making intensive preparations to make
tomorrow's fete interesting to a pub
lic wearied by military parades dur
ing the war. Little of the routine
worK of the companies will be included
in the afternoon's program. From the
squad competition, which is the initial
feature of the carnival, to the conclud
ing period of the polo game, a shift
ing scene of games, races, company
drills will keep the interest of the
bleacher occupants from flagging.
History will be made and a prece
dent set to all western universities by
the playing of the polo game. With
only three other colleges in the coun
try playing polo, Harvard, Princeton,
and Cornell, the action of Stanford in
promoting the sport is one of the most
important innovations in athletic,
policy made in the West this year. The
establishment of R. O. T. C. units in
many of the universities makes 'ho
spread of polo playing possibly. Un
