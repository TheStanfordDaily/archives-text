# CRABBING VERSUS ENTHUSIASM
## 
### 
jtTEGATIVE criticism has been particularly noticeable on the campus during
A ' the last few weeks, and it is more particularly disturbing when it threat
ens the successful accomplishment of something worthwhile. Your first loy
alty and enthusiasm belongs to Stanford, and the welfare of the University
is your first prime consideration. This is too often forgotten.
No matter what the question in hand it, whether it is athletics, student
control, campus publications, or a proposal of a purely social nature, there
are two ways of going at it. Either the problem is handled negatively and
every reason on earth is brought to light as to why something cannot be ac
complished, which is crabbing in the essence usually, or the positive side of
the question is considered with the one idea of how you can put this across.
It doesn't take even average intelligence to drum up negative arguments
against any issue. The easiest thing in the world is to find reasons why
something can't be done. It doesn't make any difference whether it is study
ing which will involve a little xtra effort", the reasons for not going into the
thing simply array themselves in your mind without any deliberate intention.
On the other hand, it is quite a different thing to determine how something
can be done in the face of almost overwhelming difficulties. It takes all the
intelligence and all the grit which the Stanford man and woman is known to
have, to put such things across. It takes enthusiasm and loyalty not only for
the enterprise but for Stanford. The thought of what it is going to mean to
the finest university in the West has inspired Stanford men and women on
to deeds worthy of the name of Stanford and this same inspiration will serve
in the future.
Some men 011 the campus now are talking about the awful athletic slump
which the university is suffering at the present. There may be a slump but
that Isn't the way to get the idea out of the minds of the student that there
is a slump. Don't talk about the slump but talk about something constructive.
Talk about the thing which will correct the evil and the less said about the
thing that is wrong, the better. This is only one example of many on the
campus. Put the constructive side-of the argument forward first. When
you start to crab think what a little enthusiasm will mean. This doesn't
mean that faults should be ignored but it does nean' that when you find some
thing wrong don't just talk about it. Get in and do something. No matter
how difficult the enterprise appears if it means something worth while to
Stanford it is worth backing. Where there is a will there is a way and
Stanford men and women in the past have been famed for finding the way
and you students of Stanford must lead on to keep this spirit alive.
