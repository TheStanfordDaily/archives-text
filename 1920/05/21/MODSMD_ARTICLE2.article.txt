# FOOTBALL PRACTICE NOW ON IN EARNEST
## Training, Under Direction of Captain Holt Uncovers Good Material 
### 
Preliminary instructions have been
received from Coach Walter Powell
football training. A good number of
men are now working out every night
on the field. The ability of any previ
ously unknown stars has, as yet, had
little time to become known. It is ex
pected, however, that the training will
uncover some valuable men for next
year's team.
Work for the present will consist of
practice in punting and passing.
Every night the work will begin with
dodging practice. Also, yesterday,
teams were made up and a few signals
run off.
The field is now in very poor condi
tion, the grass being very thick, high
and dry. As soon as this is remedied,
the men will be given practice in tack
ling and falling on the ball. Until that
time, the tackling dummy will furnish
tumbling practice. It is probably that
a light workout with the tackling dum
my will be had tonight.
Material for a heavy line for next
year's varsity seems very plentiful,
llighter, Adams, Stice, DeGroot, Mc-
Alpine, Reid and Sproul are all heavy
men and first class players. Also the
Cardinal team will be materially
strengthened by the addition of Arnott,
all-southern half-back who was in
eligible to play this year.
