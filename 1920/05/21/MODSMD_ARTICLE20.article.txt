# WATCH THE MILITARY FETE
## 
### 
rPHE military fete to be held here tomorrow is an innovation for Stanford
and it is with considerable interest that many students of the University
are looking forward to it. A complete military atmosphere will return to the
campus once again and with it will come reminiscences of the days when the
S. A. T. C. ruled the Farm. A military band will furnish the jazz for the
fete and spectacular riding will provide the thrills. The polo game will be
watched with* considerable interest as the first exhibition of the new sport
which has come but recently to the campus. The intricacies of polo are
not generally understood by many campus students but Manager Quimby
seems to believe that it is never too soon to learn. The Daily Palo Alto offers
sincerest wishes for success. The military men of the campus deserve the
support of the University.
