IT'S TOO BAD that Bob Evans didn't bring his brand new stop watch
to the meet Saturday to time Kirksey in the 220. Some of the timers clocked
the Stanford speed burner in 21 2-5 seconds and others in 21 3-5. Evans' now
timepiece might have settled the argument in favor of the 21 2-5 mark and
given Kirksey the Pacific Coast record.
