# Water Shortage Not Serious Says Willis
## 
### 
No serious water shortage threatens
the the campus as yet, though the effects
of the dry season have been felt in near
by communities. Stanford has not issued
any orders curtailing the use of water,
and there is at present a sufficient sup
ply, though there is none to waste.
The threatened shortage has attracted
the attention of experts. Professor Bai
ley Willis of the Geology Department,
said in a speech before the Chamber of
Commerce in Palo Alto that the wa
ter supply of the peninsula did not
come from the High Sierras, as is com
monly supposed, and is therefore not in
exhaustible. and care must be exercised
in water conservation.
