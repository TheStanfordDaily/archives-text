# Negro Stories Will be Printed by Dr. Branner
## 
### 
"How and Why Stories," a collec
tion of stories from Negro folklore,
by President-Emeritus Branner, will
be published in book-form some time
before next Christmas. Dr. Branner
told several of these stories in darky
dialect at the Community House in
Palo Alto. It is an unusual group of
tales, which Dr. Branner gathered
when he lived in the South. The book
is in manuscript form at present.
