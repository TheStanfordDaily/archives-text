# FORENSIC PROGRAM TO BE ALTERED FOR ENSUING QUARTERS
## System of Extemporaneous Speech and Individual Help Decided 
### 
Complete revision of the coaching
system and a definite alteration in the
debating schedule for next year is
planned by Coach M. L. McClintock.
The introduction of the squad system
this year has served its purposp in
attracting new men to forensic activ
ities, in promoting general interest in
intercollegiate debating and in develop
ing new material, but has not allowed
sufficient time for personal instruc
tion, according to McClintock. The
former system of elimination by try
outs in the early part of the season
vill go into effect in the autumn quar
ter of next year.
The debating schedule for the cur
rent year has been crowded to over
flowing and has not permitted a suf
ficient amount of intensive study on
the part of the students of the vari
ous questions chosen for discussion.
The number of contests will probably
be reduced from seven to three unless
some particularly attractive contract
can be made with another university.
The schedule as planned will include
the annual intercollegiate contest with
the University of California in the
autumn quarter, the Pacific Coast
League debates with Washington and
Oregon Universities, and the Joffre
Medaille argument in the early part
of the spring quarter.
Intersociety forensic activities are
to be emphasized in the future. De
bates between the societies of the
larger universities and between the
societies and the smaller colleges in
Northern California will be held dur
ing the year. Interclass contests will
be emphasized, working under a sched
ule similar to that employed for intra
mural athletics. A debate between the
freshmen and sophomores will take
place in the autumn quarter, a second
between the juniors and seniors in
the winter quarter, and the class cham
pionship as a final contest in the spring
quarter.
A one-man team debate will be a
feature of this season. Some question

of immediate interest to the univer
sity will be chosen for discussion, and
the participants in the contest will be
given a certain amount of time for con
structive argument. The main speech
es will be followed by refutations of
five minutes for a period of perhaps
an hour, thus giving each speaker half
an hour for extemporaneous argu
ment. The introduction of such a
system in intersociety contests has
been contemplated but has not yet
been adopted.
The alterations in the debating
schedule are intended to stimulate in
terest in local forensic circles, as well
as to develop material for later inter
collegiate contests. The return of at
least a dozen experienced speakers
next year, in addition to the new ma
terial uncovered in next year's events
will insure a majority of Cardinal vic
tories for the future.
