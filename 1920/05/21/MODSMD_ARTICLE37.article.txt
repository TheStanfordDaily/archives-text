TO THE EDITOR OF THE DAILY PALO ALTO:
The article in last night's issue The
Daily Palo Alto entitled, "Seniors Must
Pay Dues to be on Roll,"' struck a very
discordant note in the minds of many
members of the graduating class. No
arbitrary and militaristic assessment
ever "gets across," and the moment a
treasurer threatens to punish a class for
neglect in the payment of dues, just at
that instant does the cloak of failure
come over such a scheme.
To many seniors this was the first
news of a class assessment, and instead
of the notice telling in a tactful man
ner of the need of money, the members
of the class are notified that they can
only sign the Class Roll upon payment
of $3.50 into the treasury. As a result,
those students who are unable to spare
that amount of money, due to excessive
taxes elsewhere and the general heavy
expense of graduation, are to be deprived
of the traditional privilege of signing the
Class Roll, a privilege that should be
above mere monetary value. And there
is the other side of the question. Even
those students who have the money on
hand will be less eager to pay their
dues under the circumstances brought
about by such arbitrary niGans being em
ployed to collect the assessment.
I do not mean to complain of class
dues, for no class can accomplish any
thing without them, but what I do de
plore is the lack of judgment shown in
the attempt to coerce persons in the
payment of the needed money. "You
can lead a horse to water, but you can't
make him drink." A Senior.
