# NEW 1921 YEARBOOK COMES FROM PRESS
## Quad Should be Distributed on Campus Next Week Says McElroy 
### 
The first complete pages of the new
1921 Quad began coming from the press,
thirty-two at a time, this afternoon at
the plant of the H. S. Crocker Company
in San Francisco. The appearance of
the first cuts and printed matter con
firms the management's choice of the
plain though expensive blue-black ink
and white paper, for according to the
critics assembled by Editor McElroy for
the occasion, the facial features in all
pictures are clear, and the final printing
is distinct and accurate.
Six or more presses will be kept busy
night and day from now until the Tues
day or Wednesday of next week, when
the work should be completed. The ma
terial will then be taken from the Crock
er plant to Kitchin's binding works,
where the pages will be cut, put to
gether, and bound in the deep maroon
special leather cover complete. The vol
umes will be brought to the campus by
the end of next week.
The color pages done by R. C. Alex
ander, '21, and a number of assistants,
will be run through the press tomorrow
or next day, when they will go to the
plant to place their official "O. K." on
the final result.
More than half the available copies of
the yearbook were sold by the coupon
method on the campus yesterday, accord
ing to Manager M. A. Kline.
