Intramural track men will have the
busiest week of the season beginning
Monday when the five-day competition
in the penathalon begins with the 100-yd.
dash.
Director Art Acker, in charge of these
events, places emphasis on the fact that
every man coming out for intramural
track will have to enter into active com
petition if he expects to get any credit
for the course. "There will be abso
lutely no exceptions," said Acker last
night, referring to the attendance in the
meet. "If any man fails to report he
will simply lose the credit for his
work."
Competition in the pentathalon will
be divided into two classes, varsity and
non-varsity. The former includes all
men who have competed in varsity track
meets and received recognition, and men
who made points in the freshman track
meet against U. C., who formerly re
ceived track numerals in their freshman
year, are also to compete 011 the varsity
teams.
With Kirksey and Wells in the east
the varsity 100-yard dash on Monday
probably will go to either Lilly, Gene
Davis, or Scoficld, although Forster or
Williamson, 1923 stars, may step in and
bid high for honors.
For the non-varsity men Roberts looks
like a winner. Roberts was ineligible
for the freshman meet with California,
but as he is in pretty good shape he
ought to clean up in the century.
On Tuesday, May 25, the second event,
the high jump, will be held. Plenty of
competition in this contest ought to re
sult, as about half of the intramural
trackmen have been taking a fling at
the bar.
Wednesday afternoon, the shot put
will be held and on Thursday the mile
run should furnish thrills for the on
lookers.
The pentathalon will be concluded Fri
day with a broad jump.
The winner will be judged according
to the A. A. U. rules governing a pen
tathalon, one thousand points being a
perfect score.
Intramural track athletics have
prospered this year under the coaching
of Maloney and Acker. On numerous
occasions relay teams composed of 24
men each have met and engaged in
spirited races.
Prizes will be given to the men who
make the best averages in both divisions,
and additional prizes will be awarded to
those living groups whose teamwork is
superior.
