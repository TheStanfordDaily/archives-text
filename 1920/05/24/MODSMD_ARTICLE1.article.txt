# MILITARY FETE ATTRACTS HUGE STANFORD CROWD
## Whites Run Steam Roller Over Reds in First Polo Scrap Witnessed on Local Field 
### 
Fifteen hundred people witnessed the
Spring Military Tournament on the Polo
Field Saturday afternoon. A varied
scene of games, races, and drills held the
interest of the large crowd to the end
despite unusually sultrv weather. The
success of the initial exhibition of Stan
ford's uniformed students makes the rep
etition of the Field Day next year prob
able.
An intimate knowledge of military
drill was shown by the local units
throughout the afternoon's program.
That the infantry company and the artil
lery battery could so successfully com
plete their maneuvers is a testimonial to
the ability of the three instructors sta
tioned by the War Department at Stan
ford.
"Wild Bill," the unrideible broncho,
was feeling kindly Saturdav afternoon,
and his bucking quickly subsided into a
pleasant ride for the broncho buster.
Following the throwing of the first rider
William Southwell '22 annexed the vic
tor's prize by steering the broncho
around the fieid.
Polo playing as a university sport was
introduced Saturday by the pole game
between the Reds and the Whites. And
unusually good brand of polo was played
by the participants in the scrap. Al
though Captain Collins was the only ex
perienced poloist on the field, the plaving
of the other men showed that the six
weeks of intensive practice which the
teams have been undergoing have pro
duced crack polo material. Manager
James Quinby, '18, probably will sched
ule a number of off-campus nolo games
prior to the close of this quarter.
Ed Skinner '23 was the star for the
Whites and aided materially in making
the 3 1-2 points that gave his team the
victory. Though the Whites were twice
penalized, the Reds were not able to
run their score above two goals, result
ing in the final score standing 3 1-4 to 2
for the quartet of Whites.
