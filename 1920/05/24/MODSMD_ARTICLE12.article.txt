# STAGER RETURNS TO FORMER POSITION IN CAMPUS BOOK STORE
## 
### 
R. M. Stager has returned to the
Stanford Bookstore after an absence
of two years, taking the place of Harry
C. Peterson who left at the end of
last week to take up new work.
Stager is familiar with Stanford
University conditions, having been in
the University storeroom for a num
ber of years before joining the'book
store here. He left the campus two
years ago to join the Wahl Stationery
Company in Sacramento. From Sac
ramento he returned to Palo Alto as
storekeeper of the Federal Telegraph
Company, the position he is leaving to
return here. For the time being and
until Walter A. Stempel, the new man
ager, arrives. Stages will carry on
the work formerly conducted by Peter
son in charge of the miscellaneous de
partment.
Peterson has taken a position an
lookout in the snow sheds at Summit,
above Sisoo, watching for forest fires
for the Southern Pacific Company. He
has taken this place partly for rest, his
health not having been very good re
cently, and partly because it affords
an opportunity for him to do some
writing.
