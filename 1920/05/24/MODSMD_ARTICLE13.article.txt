### 
CAMBRIDGE, Mass., May 24. —"I
think all college men, mindful of the
leadership and responsibility, United
States ought to assume in raising the
world from demoralization, should be
for the League of Nations." This is the
statement which Ex-President William
Howard Taft made here when asked
To express his personal opinion on the
attitude with which college men should
view the League.
"Recent developments have not
changed my opinion in respect to a
League of Nations," Mr. Taft continu
ed. "nut there is this to be said: It
has developed that we cannot secure
a League without what are called the
Lodge reservations. College men
should, therefore, be for the adoption
of the League with these reservations,
which Lord Grey's letter shows will
be accepted by the European and other
powers already united in the League.
The President's supporters should
have ratified the Treaty with the re
servations as early as November last
when they had the full opportunity
to do so, and the President should have
accepted this and submitted it to the
conference. Had this been done we
would now be in the League function
ing and greatly helping the world. I
am still hopeful that such a result may
be brought about but in the internal
we have lost precious time." „
