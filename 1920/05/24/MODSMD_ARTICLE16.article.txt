# INTRAMURAL TRACK MEET STARTS TODAY
## 
### 
With the running of the heats in the
100-yard dash this afternoon the first
Stanford intramural track meet will
start in earnest.
Coach Art Acker, in charge of the five
events, one of which will be run every
day in order that the pentathalon will
be completed by the end of the week,
predicts keen competition, as there have
been almost 200 men out for track this
quarter. Physical training credits will
not be allowed those who fail to take
part in the activities of this week.
Tomorrow afternoon the shot put
will be held, and on Wednesday the high
jump will be the event of the day.
Points will be tabulated according to the
A. A. U. standard, and the men with
the best averages will be given awards.
