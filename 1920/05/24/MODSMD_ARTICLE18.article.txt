ITHACA, N. Y„ May 24.—Cornell's
eight-oared crews defeated oarsmen of
Harvard University in two two-mile
races on Lake Cayuga, Saturday aft
ernoon. Tlarvard's varsity put up a
game battle, but did not seem to be
in as good condition as the Cornell
night and lacked the driving power of
the men from Ithaca.
