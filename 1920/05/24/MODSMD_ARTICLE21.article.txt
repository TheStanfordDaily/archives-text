little train of three wooden coaches
today brought the remains of Carranza
back to his former capital... Not more
than one hundred and fifty persons
were on hand when the train, drawn
by a rusty crippled engine, puffed its
way into the city on the narrow-gauge
railway.. A band of faithful Carranza
soldiers, ragged, dirty and unshaven,
bore the rough wooden box containing
the body solemnly on their shoulders
to the Carranza residence where Car
ranza's two daughters took charge of
it and began arrangements for the
funeral.
President Carranza and General
Morales y Molina were only persons
killed at Tijaxacalantongo, according
to newspaper dispatches received here
today. General Rodolfo Herrero is
quoted by the dispatches as saying
that he only desires to kill Carranza
and Ygnavio Bonillas. General Moral
es y Molina conducted the military
trial of General Roberto E. Cejudo,
former commander in chief of the
forces of Emiliano Zapata in Hidalgo,
who was accused of dealing with the
rebels. lie is said to have been mis
taken for Bolinas.
