## 
### 
"The Background of La? r Unrest"
will be the topic of an address to be
given by the Rev. Richard Roberts,
tomorrow evening, in the Little The
atre, at 7:30 o'clock. This will be
the last of the series of Tuesday
evening lectures this quarter.
Dr. Roberts is the pastor of the
Church of Pilgrims, Brooklyn, New
\ork, and is a Welchman by birth.
Mr. Roberts has already delivered
several interesting lectures to the stu
dents of the University during his visit
here as University preacher.
Dr. Roberts came to the United
States three years ago from England
to take up the pastorship of the Brook
lyn Church. Until this time he was
the pastor of a large church in London.
As a resit of his intimate knowledge
of English labor and industrial con
ditions during the war, he is an
authority on the present labor unrest
in England.
Both in London and America he has
been an ardent student of industrial
problems. He has contributed a num
ber of prticles to "The Nation" on
conditions in the United States and
England. Since his coming to America
Dr. Roberts has made several trips to
England and has thus been able to
keep himself well acquainted with
conditions there.
Dr. Roberts will conclude his series
of addresses here with a Memorial
Day lecture on May 30.
