# A 						DAILY WORTHY OF STANFORD
## 
### 
ffIHE editor and staff of the Daily Palo Alto presents the premier six column
edition for the first time in the history of the paper in the hope that it
will be welcomed by the students of the campus as an advance which will
make the paper worthy of the name of Stanford University. Sonsistant with
the policy of the Daily Palo Alto for the current term every possible effort
has been made to improve the publication put out by the Associated Stu
dents. Steps are at last under way for a new press to be used by the Daily
Palo Alto next year which will greatly facilitate putting out the six column
paper but the need for an experienced staff to go in next fall was felt to be
an imperative necessity and to make this possible, the step was taken at the
present time in the face of almost overwhelming difficulties.
In the early years of the Daily Palo Alto, this publication ranked as one
of the finest publications of its kind in the country. In the college exchanges
the Daily Palo Alto held its place at the top of the list almost without dispute.
As the University grew, the paper was unable to keep up on account of con
ditions and circumstances under which every succeeding editor and business
manager had had to work. The cry for a new press has been constantly re
sounded by each editor but no concerted and effective action has even been
possible. The opportunity has at last come when the men and women of
Stanford University can have a daily publication worthy of the untiring effort
which the Daily Palo Alto staff members of past generations have put into the
paper.
The Daily Palo Alto has a large exAange list and it will be with con
siderable gratification that the student body will at last know that the out
side impression of campus journalism will be a credit to the University. Next
to athletics, the various journalistic work on the campus is the most influ
ential factor in determining prospective students. The Daily Palo Alto has
long suffered in comparison with the Daily Californlan, the University of
Washington Daily, and even such publications as the Oregon Emerald of
O. A. C. Stanford holds a remarkable place in other activities, particularly
in athletics, in comparison with other universities and many students have
long wished that the might do the same with the Daily Palo Alto. The oppor
tunity has at last come and we of the Daily Palo Alto staff hope that the
campus will back is in our new enterprise.
