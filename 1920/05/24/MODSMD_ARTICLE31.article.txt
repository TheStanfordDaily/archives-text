# THE 						NEWS OF THE HOUR
## 
### 
THE DAILY PALO ALTO has felt the need of press service for some time
and it is with considerable gratification that we inaugurate such a service
with this issue. Few students on the campus have the time to read the daily
newspapers. The lack of general information concerning current events is
almost astounding and it is logical that the Daily Palo Alto should do some
thing to meet this end.
Through the combined efforts of the editorial staff and the business
management the services of the United Press have been secured. This was
only made possible by the co-operation of the business management with the
editor and the Daily Palo Alto wishes to take this opportunity to express
its appreciation.
The Daily Palo Alto will receive a five hundred-word telegraph service
regularly covering the most important stories of state, national, and inter
national interest. Throgh the columns of the Daily the campus will receive
at least the most important news of the day and will not have to depend
entirely upon the reading of a second daily paper for the news of the hour.
It is to be hoped that the student body will receive the press service with the
same enthusiasm with which the members of the Daily Palo Alto offer it.
The success of the business management puts the Daily Palo Alto in a
position to take over both press service and the enlargement of the paper
at this time. It was thought that the paper might have to show a slight
deficit for the last three weeks of publication, but according to present plans,
the Daily Palo Alto will be able to meet the added expense of the change at
this time. This statement is made to clear up any misconceptions which
might be prevalent regarding the financial side of the new Daily.
