# A 						DISTINGUISHED VISITOR

OTANFORD STUDENTS have had an unusual opportunity and privilege in
hearing the Reverend Richard Roberts of Brooklyn both in the Memorial
Church recently and in the University Assembly Thursday morning. Dr.
Roberts will be on the campus until May 30, and he is scheduled to address
other student gatherings. It is seldom that the campus has the privilege of
hearing a man so well informed on political questions but who also has the
background of religious training.
Tomorrow evening, Dr. Roberts will speak for the usual Tuesday
evening lecture, on "The Background to Labor Unrest." This address should
prove to be unusually enlightening in view of the experience and wide knowl
edge which Dr. Roberts has. He is thoroughly acquainted with conditions
in England as well as in America and will probably draw some line of com
parison between the two countries which would be unusually interesting.
The labor question is undoubtedly one of the most serious questions of the
hour and the ability of this country to meet the issue is cause for many to
voice grave doubts. Stanford men and women have an unusual opportunity
for first-hand information and it is to be hoped that they will avail thqr n
selves of the opportunity next week.
