# H.C. PETERSON LEAVES CAMPUS BOOKSTORE
## Familiar Stanford Character Will Compile History In Sierras 
### 
. P e ' ers on, until recently con
nected with the Stanford Bookstore, has
lett the campus to accept a position in
the Sierras, with the Southern Pacific
Company.
Mr. Peterson is one of the best known
and most interesting characters of the
Stanford campus. He came to Stanford
as a young man with his father, J. E.
I eterson, who for fifteen years had
charge of the foundry in the Engineer
ing Department.
Peterson himself was soon made cura
tor of the Stanford Museum, which po
sition he held for nineteen years. Four
years ago he resigned his curatorship to
work for the Hall-Scott Motor Works
in Berkeley. Prom there he transferred
"the Federal Telegraph Company, with
which company he remained until his
return to the campus last summer.
At this time Peterson accepted a posi
tion with the Stanford Bookstore in or
der that he might be in closer touch
with the University while compiling a
history of Stanford. Finding he could
not devote sufficient time to this work
while being engaged at the Bookstore,
he resigned his position to accept one
with the Southern Pacific in a lookout
station 7,000 feet up in the Sierras.
Peterson was the founder of the Palo
Alto Historical Association and has act
ed as its president since its formation
six years ago. He has also acted as a
member of the Palo Alto City Council
fofxthe past seven years.
A series of articles on Stanford his
tory were written by Peterson and pub
lished about a year ago in the San Fran
cisco Call. It is this history which he
hopes to revise and expand and to have
published in book form next fall.- It
will be fully illustrated with pictures

of the early days of the University up
to those of the present day.
No one, perhaps, is more perfectly
equipped to write this volume than is
Mr. Peterson. His long and intimate
connection with the University and his
close association with its founders and
developers as well as his relationship
with the generations of students of Stan
ford give him a background unequalled
for presenting a history of the highest
order. Mr. Peterson states that in con
trast to the history now being compiled
b" Dr. Jordan, which will be dealt with
more from the academic side, his will
be treated from the "human interest"
viewpoint.
