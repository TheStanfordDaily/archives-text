# PROFESSOR MARTIN WILL SPEAK TONIGHT ON SOUTH AMERICA
## 
### 
"The Tacna-Arica Controversy" will
be the specific topic of Professor Percy
Martin's talk before the Cosmopolitan
Club tonight in the Woman's Clubhouse
at 8 o'clock. The possession of the
provinces of Tacna and Arica are dis
puted by Bolivia, Peru, and Chile. The
main quarrel is between Peru and Chile,
but as the only seaport possible to Bo
livia is in the territory, the question is
further complicated by her claims.
The claims of Peru and Bolivia were
presented before the Peace Conference,
as these two countries broke off relations
with Germany during the recent war.
No satisfactory settlement has been
reached, however, and disorders have
resulted. The dispute has not yet
reached threatening proportions, but it
has been characterized bv Professor
Martin as a "danger spot" in South-
American politics.
