To the Editor of the Daily Palo Alto:
Evidently the writer of Another
viewpoin in Friday's issue of the Daily
Palo Alto has a wrong conception of
the assessment on members of the
Senior Class.
The Finance Committee recently
drew up a budget for the Senior Week
activities and decided that an assess
ment of $3.50 would be necessary in
order to carry out the plans. This
fact tas been mentioned at the last
two meetings of the class, and if "A
Senior" had attended either of them,
he would'nt have received such a
shock on seeing the announcement of
the assessment in the Daily Palo Alto.
An assessment on members has been
the usual way of clearing up the fi
nancial affairs of former graduating
classes. According to the Alumni Sec
retary, who has had charge of the
class roll in former years, it has also
been customary to have the Seniors
show their assessment receipts on sign
ing the Roll, so that there is nothing
novel in the plan.
This ought to clear up any miscon
ceptions which may exist.
F. N. Thomas, '20.
