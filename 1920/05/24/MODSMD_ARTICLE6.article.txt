# Steeple Jack to Liberate Captive Library Pigeons
## 
### 
Sympathy for two baby squabs, im
prisoned in one of the Library recesses
for the past week, has moved the Uni
versity authorities to provide for their
release. The story of motherly care
for the little birds is an interesting
one.
Early last week screens were placed
across all the recesses at the top of
the Library building to prevent pige
ons from roosting in them. Because
of the position of the niches the task
was a difficult one to accomplish.
Then someone heard the excited
chirping of the imprisoned birds and
for several days passers-by have
watched how the worried mother pige
on has fed the little ones through the
wiring. With her care they have been
kept alive and tomorrow they will be
released by a San Francisca construc
tion firm which is sending a steeple
jack to the campus for the purpose.
