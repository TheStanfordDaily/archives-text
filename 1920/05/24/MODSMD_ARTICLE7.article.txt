# ENCINA POOL PUMP PROVES A SUCCESS; COSTS OVER $6000
## 
### 
The Encina swimming pool was filled
yesterday bv the new oump purchased
and installed by the Board of Athletic
Control. Prof. E. P. Lesley '96, who has
supervised the boring of 'he well and
the installation of the pump on behalf
of Hie Board of Athletic Control turned
on the electric power at 1:30 o'clock, and
from that moment until the tank was
filled, taking five hours and forty min
utes, the pump ran smoothly and without
interruption, pouring 584 gallons a min
ute into the pool.
The well was bored and the pump and
motor' furnished and set up by the
Western Well Works of San Jose. It
is 350 feet deep and cost in the neigh
borhood of $3,500. The pump, motor,
and installation will amount to about
$2,600 additional. There is still some
expense to be undergone for 'nousing the
new equipment and making some alter
ations in the piping. It is planned to in
stall another pump to supply the shower
baths with water from the new well . Bv
this arrangement the Board of Athletic
Control will be able to utilize its own
well for the showers instead of pur
chasing water and to change the water
in the swimming pool as frequently is
it desires and save considerable money
on the well operation as compared with
present expenses.
