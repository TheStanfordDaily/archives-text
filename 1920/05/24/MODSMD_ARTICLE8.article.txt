# SEARSVILLE TO BE ENLARGED; GREATER SUPPLY IS NEEDED
## 
### 
The work of raising the Searsville dam
for the purpose of impounding sufficient
water during the rainy season to fore
stall any danger of scarcity from that
source has been started bv the Universi
tv. The dam is being raised 3 1-2 feet.
In addition, the old spillwa" which was
5 1-2 feet deep, is being completely
blocked and a shallow spillway being
substituted. This has the effect of rais
ing the dam *iine feet.
During recent years the level of wa
ter, which is used for irrigation, for
campus lawns, and supplementary fire
servicc supply, has been so low that the
supply lias run short durin ,T the year
The new dam will do avvav with anv
possibility of a drought.
The Searsville dam was built thirty
years ago by Senator Stanford and the
Spring Valley Water Company jointly,
the original capacity of the lake thus
formed being 337.000,000 gallons. Since
then the lake has been reduced twice, but
the present change will increase the ca
pacity within ten million gallons of its
original capacity.
The University has recently purchased
from the Spring Valley Water Company
land adjacent to the lake which will be
flooded when the new dam becomes op
erative with the floods of next winter.
