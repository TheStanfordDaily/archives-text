The Rev. Richard Roberts, pastor of
the Church of Pilgrims, Brooklyn, New

assembly last week. He will continue in
the service of the University until May
30, delivering the Memorial Day address
on that day. The address this evening
will be the closing Tuesday evening lec
ture of the quarter.
Dr. Roberts lived in England until he
came to the United States three years
ago to assume the pastorship of the
Brooklyn Church. While in England, as'
the minister of one of the largest church
es of London, he was able to make an
intimate study of industrial conditions
in London and the large English cities.
His knowledge of conditions in England
during the war obtained during his resi
dence there and by reason of his numer
ous trips there - from the United States,
places him as an authority on the labor
problems that arc today confronting
Threat Britain and the United States.
