# "RYLAND," MASQUERS PLAY TO INVOLVE STARTLING EFFECTS
## 
### 
In "Rvland," one of the plays to be
Toduced by Masquers on June 3, the so
ciety will use an entirely new method
of stage setting from any that has been
seen at Stanford before. Large screens
will be used, combined with foliage, and
simple and interesting lighting effects.
This plan will make a novel departure
from the stereotyped form of college
lramatics, and its effect is looked for
ward to with interest by those in charge.
The setting for the play has been
changed, and according to the latest
olans, the three plays will be produced
on the platform over Lagunita between
the men's and women's boathouses. The
sides of the will l>e banked
with trees and branches. The setting
for each individual play will then be
varied in accordance with the play. The
lake will appear in the background, and
the audience will be arranged along
the rise above the path.
The rehearsals have shown a great
deal of new talent, and the various
coaches expect that all will be in readi
ness for the production oÂ£ the plays on
Tune 3.
