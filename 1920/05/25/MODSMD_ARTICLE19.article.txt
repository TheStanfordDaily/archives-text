# Gas Wagon Exhibits Alpinistic Tendency

### 
There were few who passed by the
S. A. E. house opposite the post of
flee last evening without stopping
And they questioned among themselves
whether the exhibition which was go
ing on demonstrated a new aspect
of porch-climbing, the qualities of a
certain make of car, or merely college
spontaneity.
According to members of the fra
ternity, it was all started when one of
the men tried to descend the front
steps on a bicycle. Then someone
suggested to C. S. Draper, *20, that he
attempt to go up the steps in his road
ster. After three attempts which at
tracted crowds of curious spectators,
Draper succeeded in making the ascent
amid volleys of applause.
