# COMMITTEE CHOSES SNAPPY PLAY FOR 1920 SENIOR FARCE
## 
### 
"Goodness Gracious, Annabelle," is the
name of the farce which has been select
ed by the 1920 committee for production
by the seniors this year. Although the
committee had a large number of plays
to choose from, "Goodness Gracious, An
nabelle" has been so pre-eminently suc
cessful that it was selected with no op
position.
The play is by Clare Kummer, one of
America's most brilliant modern play
writes, and is filled with scintillating
lines and humorous situations. It is,
in form, a romantic farce, in three acts.
The author has seized upon a number
of complicated situations involving the
difficulty of a society man in getting a
cook. The plot though complicated, is
well connected throughout, and is thor
oughly modern in treatment.
The opportunities presented in "Good
Gracious, Annabelle" are such as have
seldom been equaled on the Stanford
stage, especially as regards the feminine
roles, said Coach Davis today. In order
adequately to produce this comedy, all
new scenery must be built, and the com
mittee is planning to spare no expense in
its production.
"Good Gracious, Annabelle" has had a
phenomenal run in New York, and it is
not without some effort that the commit
tee has persuaded the publishers to al
low its production here.
Final tryouts for the cast were held
this afternoon, and Coach Davis expects
to be able to announce the cast tomor
row.
