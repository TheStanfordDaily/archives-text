# TUBBING AND UNIVERSITY POLICY
## 
### 
THE SAFETY VALVE of the "Chronicle", Sunday, offered an item which
will serve as food for thought for many men on the campus. According
to the man who signs himself "A Philanthropist" the University has lost a
considerable sum of money because the practice of tubbing is prevalent on
the campus. The communication makes the point that the University does
not tolerate the practice officially but that in spite of official denial tubbing
continues on the campus.
The editor of the Palo Alto Daily is not in a position to go into the rela
tive merits of tubbing. No doubt there is use and misuse of this means of
punishment. It is an open question as to whether the good outweighs the bad
as is shown by the fact that campus opinion is divided on the subject.
The fact that no student can get away from, however, is that tubbing this
year lost the University a considerable sum of money. No one can deny that
tubbing has been a common practice in spite of a university regulation
against it. No student can get away from the fact that some man's reaction
was sufficiently influential to cause a public outburst in a San Francisco pub
lication and it is natural to conclude that from the standpoint of the out
sider, tubbing does the University more harm than good.
Looking at the question from the inside, it assumes different proportions.
Many men in the University are thoroughly convinced of the merits of tub
bing. Others are just as sincerely opposed to it. The administration has
made clear its policy by issuing a regulation against it, which would seem
to settle the question from the University standpoint, but this far from the
case. Instead tubbing continues hardly sub rosa. The women students of
the University and the faculty hear echoes continually. In the former case,
it is not remarkable that this should be the case but when it comes to faculty
the camouflage becomes pretty thin. If tubbing is something worth-while and
worthy of Stanford men, if it is a powerful factor in turning out the kind of
men Stanford wants to see, if tubbing is to hold a place in Stanford life, then
let it hold a respected place. Settle the question either one way or the
other. As conditions exist now tubbing is a bad influence for the under-'
graduate because it is done on the side under the excuse of a virtue and
tubbing certainly puts the University in an awkward position from the stand
point of the outsider. There isn't any doubt but what "A Philanthropist" had
strong justification for his remarks and it will be interesting to see whether
anything is to be done about the present deplorable situation.
