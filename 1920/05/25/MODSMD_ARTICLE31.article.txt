117ITH smoke-ups out, it is appropriate to pass a few remarks on the scholar
ship standard of the University. Probably only a small minority actually
feel that the scholarship standard is exceptionally high, although this group
seems to increase with the announcement of those on probation and first
failure. Nevertheless, it is generally conceded that it is more difficult to get
a degree from Stanford University than it is from any of the other universities
on the Coast. On the other hand it is probably true that the scholarship
standard at Stanford is lower than at some institutions in the East but on
the whole the University will rank as one of the most exacting in the United
States.
Many students fail to see the advantages of the truths set forth, but un
doubtedly Stanford has gained prestige from her scholarship standard. For
an institution as young as Stanford, she has sent forth an amazing number
of prominent men and women. They have made notable successes in their
work and at least a portion of that success must be accredited to the early
training received in college. A graduate of Stanford enjoys a prestige which
may or may not get him a job but at least it makes a degree from Stanford
a little more valuable than another one might be. Therefore it is natural
to conclude that although the list of first failures and probations may grow
in length, the result is for the greatest good to the greatest number. Excel
lence in scholarship is essential to the all-around development of any man and
Stanford men and women are fortunate in havig that excellence forced upon
them.
