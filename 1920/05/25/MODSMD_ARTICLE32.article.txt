# REORGANIZATION OF THE STAFF
## 
### 
riIHE enlargement and expansion of the Daily Palo Alto will necessitate a
considerable reorganization of the staff. As a first step along this line,
we take great pleasure in announcing the appointment of R. W. Kenny, '21,
as telegraph'editor. Kenny will handle the five hundred-word service coming
in daily from the United Press. The work involves considerable responsi
bility. Kenny has worked well on the staff and has advanced steadily since
his freshman year so that the appointment is made with every confidence that
the new department will be handled efficiently.
Further reorganization of the staff will probably be announced later but
most of this work will probably fall upon the coming editor-elect. There will
be some change in the type of news offered on the editorial page. The Daily
Palo Alto has never been able to work along feature lines on account of the
limitations of space but with that difficulty eliminated, the editorial page will
offer several new features. For the convennience of the student body, a
portion of a column will be turned over to the use of the appointment secre
tary, who will list the positions open to students. An interesting comparison
will also be featured called "Twenty-five Years Ago," in which items will
be reprinted from the early editions of the Daily Palo Alto. It is felt that
this work will add to the attractiveness and interest of the paper.
