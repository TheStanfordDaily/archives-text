## U.S. VAULTERS CAN BEAT EUROPE'S BEST, SAYS S.G. LANDERS American Champion Expects Little Competition at Antwerp

EDITORS' NOTE.—Sherman G. Lan
ders, national pole vault champion
in 1916 and winner of that event at the
Penn relay this year, is considered a
sure winner of the American Olympic
team. He does not confine his activi
ties to vaulting, but Is also adept at
running, hurdling and jumping. He
is now a student at the University of
Pennsylvania.—UNlTED PRESS.

(Written for the United Press)
America has lost but one Olympic
championship in the pole vault since
the resumption of the games at Athens
in 1896. Gouder of France won the
event in 1906, the second meeting at
Athens. In addition to this marvelous
fact the world's record for pole vault
ing has never departed from the
United States and this year we should
be more able than ever before to as
sert our supremacy.
The Swedes, Norwegians and Danes
are by far the best vaulters and jump
ers abroad. C. Horleman of Christia
nia, Norway, is the only serious com
petitor for our vaulters. He made a
mark of 12 feet 11 inches in the fall
of 1917, and a very good jump of
slightly over 12 feet 6 last year. Ras
mussen of Denmark succeeded in do
ing about 12 feet 3 inches in easy
fashion at the Danish championships
last fall. Word has continually come
from abroad that Coach Ernie Hjerts
berg of Sweden has been concentrat
ing upon jumpers and vaulters since
the postponement of the games to
have been held in Berlin in 1916.
The Olympic Committee's decision
to take only six men in each event
to Antwerp will play havoc with the
pole vaulters. All pole vaulters have
their good and bad days* and when
fifteen of our best vaulters, all cap
able of doing 12 feet 6 or better, line
up for the final tryout at Harvard
Stadium in July it will be an extremely
nervous aggregation. Styles of vault
ing and weather conditions will prob
ably necessitate the taking of four
men as they qualify in the tryout and
the other two from performances of
the present season.
Our representatives will come from
the various clubs and colleges. The
clubs have the best jumpers but the
college athletes will counterbalance
this by being in better condition after
a long spring season.
The following men appear at present
to be the most eligible jumpers in the
country: Frank Foss, Chicago A. A.,
holder of the world's record height 13
feet 3 9-16 inches; Marc Wright,
Boston, A. A., former record holder;
Percy Graham, Chicago A. A., and
Knourech, Illinois A. C., joint indoor
world's record holders; Floyd, Inter-
Allied champion, Carl Buch, Chicago
A. A., Sparrow, Multnomah A. C.; L.
Meyers of Dartmouth, intercollegiate
champion; Harwood of Harvard; T.
Gardner of Yale, Eldon Jenne of Wash
ington State College, Wilber New
setter, formerly of University of Penn
sylvania, and myself. There are sev
eral other possibilities that should
develop by the time of the tryouts.
A successful vaulter is as a rule
either a sprinter or a gymnast. Frank
Foss combined both; and established
the present world's record. Neither
style can claim to be the best be
cause weather conditions and differ
ent vaulting grounds have shown that
a pole vaulter unlike a runner is never
in a secure position. All vaulters will
agree that the details of keeping warm,
warming up as little as possible by
jumping, having a step, placing the
standards at the proper distance In
order to take advantage of the high
est height and clearing the bar on
the first attempt all go to make up
a successful pole vaulter, who must
in addition to all this, be a remark
able competitor.

ing has never departed from the
United States and this year we should
be more able than ever before to as
sert our supremacy.
The Swedes, Norwegians and Danes
are by far the best vaulters and jump
ers abroad. C. Horleman of Christia
nia, Norway, is the only serious com
petitor for our vaulters. He made a
mark of 12 feet 11 inches in the fall
of 1917, and a very good jump of
slightly over 12 feet 6 last year. Ras
mussen of Denmark succeeded in do
ing about 12 feet 3 inches in easy
fashion at the Danish championships
last fall. Word has continually come
from abroad that Coach Ernie Hjerts
berg of Sweden has been concentrat
ing upon jumpers and vaulters since
the postponement of the games to
have been held in Berlin in 1916.
The Olympic Committee's decision
to take only six men in each event
to Antwerp will play havoc with the
pole vaulters. All pole vaulters have
their good and bad days* and when
fifteen of our best vaulters, all cap
able of doing 12 feet 6 or better, line
up for the final tryout at Harvard
Stadium in July it will be an extremely
nervous aggregation. Styles of vault
ing and weather conditions will prob
ably necessitate the taking of four
men as they qualify in the tryout and
the other two from performances of
the present season.
Our representatives will come from
the various clubs and colleges. The
clubs have the best jumpers but the
college athletes will counterbalance
this by being in better condition after
a long spring season.
The following men appear at present
to be the most eligible jumpers in the
country: Frank Foss, Chicago A. A.,
holder of the world's record height 13
feet 3 9-16 inches; Marc Wright,
Boston, A. A., former record holder;
Percy Graham, Chicago A. A., and
Knourech, Illinois A. C., joint indoor
world's record holders; Floyd, Inter-
Allied champion, Carl Buch, Chicago
A. A., Sparrow, Multnomah A. C.; L.
Meyers of Dartmouth, intercollegiate
champion; Harwood of Harvard; T.
Gardner of Yale, Eldon Jenne of Wash
ington State College, Wilber New
setter, formerly of University of Penn
sylvania, and myself. There are sev
eral other possibilities that should
develop by the time of the tryouts.
A successful vaulter is as a rule
either a sprinter or a gymnast. Frank
Foss combined both; and established
the present world's record. Neither
style can claim to be the best be
cause weather conditions and differ
ent vaulting grounds have shown that
a pole vaulter unlike a runner is never
in a secure position. All vaulters will
agree that the details of keeping warm,
warming up as little as possible by
jumping, having a step, placing the
standards at the proper distance In
order to take advantage of the high
est height and clearing the bar on
the first attempt all go to make up
a successful pole vaulter, who must
in addition to all this, be a remark
able competitor.
EDITORS' NOTE.—Sherman G. Lan
ders, national pole vault champion
in 1916 and winner of that event at the
Penn relay this year, is considered a
sure winner of the American Olympic
team. He does not confine his activi
ties to vaulting, but Is also adept at
running, hurdling and jumping. He
is now a student at the University of
