Ratner is not content with the hitting
honors, but also leads in fielding. His
average of .980 for twelve games easily
tops the list of regulars. Briggs appears
at the top of the column with a perfect
average but he can hardly be called the
leader because he has played in so few
games. Newland, Bundy, and Kallam
are all close to the top and when the fig
ures are completed for the last four
games of the season there may be a new
leader.
Kallam has handled more chances than
any other player. He has figured in 134
plays, 126 of which he has completed
successfully.

Ratner is not content with the hitting
honors, but also leads in fielding. His
average of .980 for twelve games easily
tops the list of regulars. Briggs appears
at the top of the column with a perfect
average but he can hardly be called the
leader because he has played in so few
games. Newland, Bundy, and Kallam
are all close to the top and when the fig
ures are completed for the last four
games of the season there may be a new
leader.
Kallam has handled more chances than
any other player. He has figured in 134
plays, 126 of which he has completed
successfully.

The scores of the two-game series
played in the north with the Oregon Ag
ricultural College have not been received
yet and for this reason the averages from
thes econtests • and the last two game 3
played on the local lot with Washington
do not appear. These averages include
the first nineteen games played.
Ratner, the husky first baseman and
second-string catcher, leads the Varsity
in hitting with an average of .355, in the
figures compiled for the first nineteen
games of the season. In the averages
for the lir-t twelve games Crowe was
leading by a small margin, but Ratner
made four hits in the three-game series
with Santa Clara and seven in the first
four games played in the north md now
tops the batters.
Crowe is second with .326, having hit
safely fifteen times out of r rty-six trips
to the bat.
Kallam leads in the number of safe
ties made with seventeen. He also leads
the base stealers witli twelve thefts.
Mitchell, leftfielder, heads the list of
run-getters with eleven scores.
The team as a whole showed improve
ment in hitting during the last seven
games. The team average jumped from
.179 to .218. The figures bear out Coach
Evans' statement that "you can't win
without basehits," for of the seven games
compiled since the last average the Car
