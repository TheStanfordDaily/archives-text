nent in every line of student activity,
was made president of the Associated
Student Body at the annual spring
election. Though his opponent, Gross

victory.

oping into a newspaperman, was elect
ed editor of The Trojan by a majority
of 271 votes over Milton M. Inman,

engineering department of Liberal
Arts gave his rival a majority of their
ballots.

Body went to Myrna Ebert, '22. She
won by a margin of 94 votes over her
nearest rival, Marjorie Helm, '22.
Dorothea Mesny, of the College of
Law, was third in the race.
An overwhelming majority at the
College of Destiny was a big factor
in giving Marie Dennis a victory over
Opal Evans. Her margin was 167
votes.
James Woodward, member of last
year's football team and promoter of
college boxing, polled the largest vote
of any candidate. Woodward was
given 931 ballots to 535 for Earle
