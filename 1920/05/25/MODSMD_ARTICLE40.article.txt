Chairman C. J. Tauzer, of the Senior
Endowment Committee, today issued
the following reasons why the endow
ment plan should be instituted:
1. To meet the increased need of
financial support.
2. To establish a scholarship sys
tem, whereby needy students may se
cure scholarships at a minimum
charge.
3. To prevent Stanford from becom
ing primarily a graduate institution.
4. To enable Stanford to assume
the position we would have her as
sume.
5. To increase the salaries of the
faculty.
6. To demonstrate our loyalty and
appreciation to our alma mater.
7. To establish a precedent that
will lead oach successive class to ap
preciate the expediency of raising an
endowment fund.
He said in conclusion, "Remember
you are purchasing an interest in the
college and not paying out money
without returns. Your returns will be
satisfaction and pride."
Those who are subscriping to the
fund are taking policies for $250 or
$350 the premium upon them being
$10 payable yearly. The policies are
to be paid to the University at the
