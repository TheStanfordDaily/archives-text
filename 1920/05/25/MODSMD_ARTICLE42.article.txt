### United Press 
CORVALLIS, Ore., May 25—Under
the head of "Athletic Courtesy" the
following editorial has appeared in the
O. A. C. Barometer, the steudent pub
lication of Oregon State Agricultural
College:
During the second game of the
recent baseball series with Stan
ford, there w?s some show of poor
spirit in regard to the visiting
players by persons sitting in the
bleachers. Members of the Stan
ford team have taken offense at
the conduct which they took to
represent the student body.
Needless to say, the persons
causing the trouble were not col
lege students, and did not repre
sent the feelings of the student
body. O. A. C. has the reputa
tion of being courteous to visit
ing teams, and will continue to
uphold it. The majority of those
present are to be commented for
their spirit at the game.
Relations between Stanford and
this institution have always been
most cordipl. The southern uni
versity has always showed good
sportsmanship, and its teams are
respected alike for their athletic
prowess and their clean play.
Anything which would disrupt this
friendly spirit between the two
schools would be greatly regretted.
This instance shows how easi
ly it is to cause unfriendly rela
tions by a little inconsiderate con
duct. A few unwise words during
the excitement of a game may ex
tend their influence over years.
We should, tben, be extremely
careful of our actions at all times,
and help preserve the reputation
of the college for good sportsman
ship, and to maintain friendly rela
tions with our rival institutions.
