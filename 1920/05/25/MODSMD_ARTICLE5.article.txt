## Search on for Carranza's Slayer HERRERO IS ORDERED TO SURRENDER BY OBREGON 
### United Press 
MEXICO CITY, May 25.â€”General
Obregon, commander of the revolution
ary forces today ordered Redolfo Her
rero to surrender and answer to the
charge of assassinating Ex-President
Carranza. Obregon declared that a
clear case of treachery had been
oroven. This order followed Herrero's
offer to come to Mexico City, if given
assurance of security, in order to give
evidence which he claimed would
prove Carranza died by his own hand.
Carranza was buried amid paupers'
graves marked only by tiny heaps of
stones or simple wooden crosses in
Dolores cemetery. The services were
brief and were attended only by in
timate friends and a few officials.
President Carranza alone was killed
during the misty morning hours of
May 21 in the tiny mountain hamlet
)f Tlaxcaltenango, State of Puebla, it
became known today. First reports
stated six others met death, and later
this was reduced to one.
Scores of theories regarding Car
ranza's death are being aired here,
among them assassination with in
tent to descredit. the revolutionary
movement, and others, some even sug
gesting suicide.
The main point stressed by revo
lutionary leaders is the fact that re
peated attempts were made to induce
Carranza to accept safe conduct, with
the plain intimation that the leaders
realized the importance of avoiding
any act which might imperil recog
nition of the new' government by the
world powers
Now, it appears, liberal Constitu
tionalist leaders are aghast at the
tragedy and its possible consequences.
Adolfo de la Iluerta of Sonora was
named President ad interim of Mexico
by the extraordinary session of Con
gress yesterday. He received 224
votes against 28 to Pablo Gonzales.
