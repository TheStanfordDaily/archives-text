# 'SENIOR ENDOWMENT NOT PROGRESSING' SAYS C.J. TAUZER
## 
### 
With the addition of only three new
policy holders, the endowment planned
by the senior class is at a temporary
standstill, according to members of the
insurance committee. Policies for the
fund have been underwritten by the
following so far:
George Kimber, $500; Matt Moses
Goldstein, $275; Genevieve Hillman,
$250; Margaret Shedd, $275; Ellen Cal
houn, $300; John A. li. Sturgeon $300;
Clarence J. Tauzer, $275; Ralph L. Car
ver, $275; Edward L. H. Bissinger, $300;
Richard A. Martinsen, '21, $1,000.
Chairman Tauzer of the committee to
day made his second plea to seniors to
assume their share of the endowment
responsibility without further delay.
"It is disastrous to delay attending to
the matter until the last few days of the
year," he said. "Besides the actual un
derwriting of the policy, physical exami
nations must be undergone, and a suffi
cient length of time must be allowed the
company to either accept or reject the
risk. If everything is put off till the
last minute by members of the class, it
w*ill mean failure.
"This step should be taken immediate
lv before the final exams begin to in
terfere with the work. So far the se
niors have evidenced no desire to help
the committee in its task of going over
the top in Stanford's first undergrad
uate endowment. Further details can be
secured any afternoon from three to
four o'clock at the bookstore, where
Mrs. A. E. Martinsen of the Equitable
Life has her headquarters for the pur
pose of explaining and underwriting
the endowment policies.
