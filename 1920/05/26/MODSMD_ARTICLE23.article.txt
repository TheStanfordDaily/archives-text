# MAY ADD TENNIS TO MAJOR SPORT LIST; PROVISION
## Kinney is Elected Yell Leader; Baseball Men Get Block S's; Approve Daily Change 
### 
The student body will be called upon
at the next quad election to vote on a
proposition to make tennis a major
activity according to action taken last
night at a meeting of the Student
Executive Committee in regular ses
sion.
There has been much agitation con
cerning the status of tennis during the
past year, with the with the result
that the Executive Committee came
to the conclusion that the issue was
of enough moment to be put before the
students for a vote.
Stanford has failed to win in the
racquet sports from the University of
California since that institution voted
tennis into the major column. It is
pointed out that this is due to the
fact that good tennis players here take
part in activities that offer more honor
and are considered more representa
tive.
Wendell H. Kinney was appointed
varsity yell leader at last night's ses
sion for the ensuing year. Kinney
has been an assistant this year under
Yell Leader W. T. Martin. The ap
pointment is in harmony with stu
dent sentiment, and from the manner
in which Kinney has assisted in lead
ing it is felt that he will be an able
successor to Martin.

and sweaters for baseball. They are:
Parker, Maillot, Briggs, Draper, New
land, Ratner, Kallam, Pelouze, Thomp
son, Crowe Mitchell, Wayland, Kline,

The student body will be called upon
at the next quad election to vote on a
proposition to make tennis a major
activity according to action taken last
night at a meeting of the Student
Executive Committee in regular ses
sion.
There has been much agitation con
cerning the status of tennis during the
past year, with the with the result
that the Executive Committee came
to the conclusion that the issue was
of enough moment to be put before the
students for a vote.
Stanford has failed to win in the
racquet sports from the University of
California since that institution voted
tennis into the major column. It is
pointed out that this is due to the
fact that good tennis players here take
part in activities that offer more honor
and are considered more representa
tive.
Wendell H. Kinney was appointed
varsity yell leader at last night's ses
sion for the ensuing year. Kinney
has been an assistant this year under
Yell Leader W. T. Martin. The ap
pointment is in harmony with stu
dent sentiment, and from the manner
in which Kinney has assisted in lead
ing it is felt that he will be an able
successor to Martin.
Fifteen men were granted block S's
and sweaters for baseball. They are:
Parker, Maillot, Briggs, Draper, New
land, Ratner, Kallam, Pelouze, Thomp
son, Crowe Mitchell, Wayland, Kline,
Dundy and Holstein.
The recent change in The Daily Palo
Alto to six columns was given official
approval by the Committee. Permis
sion to use surplus profits for added fea
tures, such as the United Press pony
service, was granted.
The following were awarded second
class circle S's for varsity wrestling:
H. E. Eagin, A. Brazil, A. C. Erick
son, R. H. Jones, C. C. Bunds.
