# THE
						PSYCHOLOGY OF ATHLETIC TITLES
## 
### 
fTHE elimination of the term "coach" by the Board of Athletic Control is a
significant step in university policy in the future. From now on those
men employed by the University and the. Board of Athletic Control will be
known as "directors" of sports. The substitution of terms in itself will mean
little to most people but the psychology of the change will no doubt be far
reaching.
For many years Stanford has been trying to get away from the paid
coach idea. The policy of the University at all times has fostered the idea
of the greatest number out for the sake of the sport and not for the sake of
the coach. The growth of this idea has had a tempestuous career. The
break with California in rugby was largely on account of this principle and
the resumption of American football was made with certain very distinct
understandings.
The team coach has always carried a monitary significance with it.
The salary of practically every coach worth the title has been subject for
much interesting comment and discussion, and it is just this question of
salary which has caused the dismissal of many a coach. The term "director,"
on the other hand, is essentially official in tone. It places the position of
the man immediately and it makes clear that he is a member of the teaching
staff of the University in the Department of Physical Education just as he
would be in the Department of Law or History.
The change will be welcomed by many connected with the University
as a decided step forward along the right lines. It erases any false con
ceptions of the place of the coach in the University and at the same time
gets a very constructive idea across to the men who are to work under the
director. On the other side, however, the change will have to meet the
criticism that it is merely a means of camouflage and that coaching is coach
ing. Even more important than the camouflage, is the point that the Uni
versity will lose something of the professional tone which of course is ex
actly what the University is striking at but what many feel to be an asset
to varsity athletics. On the whole the obpections won't hold much weight
because, from the standpoint of the outsider, the term "director" will not
be considered significant, and the advantage to the team working under a
director is obvious. In other words, from now on a more concerted attempt
is going to be made to put emphasis upon the team rather than on the coach
ing. At least a balance may be reached between the two instead of having
most of the credit go to the coach. Theoretically, at least, the idea is worthy
of support and it will be interesting to note just what the actual influence of
a mere change in terms will have in the future smooth running of the Gym
nasium Department.
