# POLITICIANS REUNITE

### 
fTHE reorganization of the Republican Club on the campus will see former
* factions once again reunited. Opposition to Wood as a candidate for
the President of the United States would seem to be the unifying influence as
opposition to a military man seems to be fairly prevalent among campus
politicians. Hoover is generally conceded to be out of the race and the choice
of presidential possibilities is continually narrowing. Johnson is probably
the strongest man, at the present time, with Lowden running second. It
would be interesting to know just what the exact strength of Wood faction
actually is.
The Republican Club went on the rocks in the primaries and it will be
interesting to watch what future developments may bring forth. A protest to
Republican headquarters against any military candidate is expected soon
and whether it will pass this political organization will be matter for interest
ing speculation. At least a few campus politicians will have the opportunity
to stick their fingers in the political pie and feel important. No doubt the
Democratic Club often sits back contented when it sees the tempestuous
course which the rival organization has had to travel. If action means in
terest, the Republican Club is not lacking in life and there are some on the
campus who no dougt welcome another friendly little scrap on the question
of Wood.
