# LAST PAGES OF NEW QUAD ARE FINISHED
## 
### 
The last pages of the 1921 Quad came
off the press of the H. S. Crocker Com
pany of San Francisco yesterday
The final sheets are color plates done by
R. C. Alexander '21, with the assist
ance of several others. Editor F. L. Mc-
Elroy left for the city today to super
vise the final assemblage of the new
book.
Binding of the Quad will be done by
Kitchin's binding works, where the pages
will be cut, assembled, and bound in the
deep maroon leather cover. Critics are
unanimous in the declaration that the
management's choice of material is justi
fied by the results of the proofs sent to
the campus from the city. Clearness of
all the pictures and the distinctness and
accuracy of the printing is characteristic
of the work done on the volume through
out.
Over half the available copies of the
Quad have been sold by the coupon
method since yesterday morning, accord
ing to Manager M. A. Kline. The
volumes will be brought to the campus
bv the end of next week.
