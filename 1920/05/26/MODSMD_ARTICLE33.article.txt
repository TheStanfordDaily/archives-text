# PROFESSOR SAYS NEW CAR FUEL WON'T WORK

LAWRENCE, Kansas. May 26—"If
by some mysterious means, liquid
hydrogen could be condensed cheap
enough, and kept long enough to ordi
nary temperatures to be used as a
motor car fuel, a gallon would run an
ordinary automobile about two miles,"
said Professor H. P. Cady of the de
partment of chemistry of the Universi
ty of Kansas, in response to a news
dispatch from Rome announcing the
"discovery" of a method of using liquid
hydrogen as a motor fuel. Dr. Pasticci,
an Italian chemist, claimed 250 miles
to the gallon for his product in ordi
nary cars.
So does the realist decree the de
structions of the rosy dreams of the
auto fiend!
"But ev( n that is only an 'if-' em
phasized Professor Cady. "Liquid
hydrogen can only be kept, at ordin
ary atmospheric pressure, at tempera
tures lower than 252 degrees below
zero, centigrade—some 423 degrees
below on the Farenheit scale —clearly
making It impractical for a motor
fuel."
The reason the high mileage pre
dicted by Dr. Pasticci is impossible
according to Professor Cady, is that
there is twice as much hydrogen in
a gallon of gasoline as in a gallon of
liquid hydrogen, and it is in as avail
able form in the one as in the other.
In addition, other components of
gasoline aid in its combustion.
