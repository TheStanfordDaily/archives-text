### United Press 
CHICAGO, May 26. —The cider, grape
juice, ginger ale and near beer bever
ages will flow during the G. O. P. na
tional convention here beginning June
8, but the lid is on hard liquor.
Government prohibition agents,
aided by dry sleuths, were prepared
today to censure closely what is drunk
at the coming convention.
Reports that all bell boys have form
ed a trust and agreed not to sell whis
key for less than $40 a pint have come
to prohibition agents and the prospect
of several of them getting jobs as bell
boys was considered entirely probable
to prevent any smuggling of liquor
into guests' rooms.
Soft drink "bars" are expected to
do a big business. What space hasn't
been grabbed by politicians for a head
quarters has been taken over for con
vention week by soft drink sellers and
confectioners.
There is a plentiful supply of whiß
key and beer in Chicago, but this is
mostly sealed up by the government
and can only be sold on physicians'
prescriptions. But local Republicans
say they have some to spare for a few
drinks and it is hoped that Mayor Wil
liam Hale Thompson, national com
mitteeman from Illinois, may loosen
the lid a little and allow delegates to
have a good time.
Cabarets are to run full tilt during
convention week. The old tenderloin
district, just south of the Coliseum,
where the convention will be staged,
is taking on new life and the notorious
22d Street has opened several lively
cabarets, with "drug stores" next door.
Here until the hours of five and six
In the morning, men and girls can
drink and shimmy without fearing
interference.
