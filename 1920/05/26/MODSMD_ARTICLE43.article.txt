# PUBLIC SHOULD HAVE NEW LABOR ATTITUDE
## Rev. Richard Roberts Asks That People Consider Problem Seriously 
### 
That there should be a new attitude
of mind in reference to the problem of
labor unrest, was the contention of the
Rev. Richard Roberts, of Brooklyn,
concerning the subject of the "Back
ground of Labor Unrest." His address
was given in the Little Theater last
evening.
The substance of the speech was as
follows:
There is a tendency to say hard
things against strikers without seek
ing out the causes for the labor un
rest. We stigmatize all unrest as
Bolshevism and do not stop to think
that labor unrest existed before Bol
shevism was invented. Unrest is con
sidered as an ethical problem when it
should be considered from a purely
scientific standpoint to find out the
reason why and the best remedy.
Two phases make up the background
of labor unrest. One phase is more
remote and the other is immediate.
The historical background is the first
part of the more remote phase. "Every
strike today is a pretty long pedigree."
You can not take a particular strike
and isolate it and determine its caus
es. The historical facts that have
caused it must be studied. The strikes
of a single country must be studied in
connection with the similar cases in
history in the rest of the world. Psy
chology is another feature of this
more remote background. There has
been a large group of migratory work
ers who have had unrest as an outlet
for their energies. The division of
labor so that man is nothing more
than a cog in an industry has left the
laborer with a desire to get rid of his
excess spirit. As long as occupations
do not provide for an outlet for in
dividuality there will be labor unrest.
The last feature of this background
is the opening that man had in the
west when he considered himself op
pressed. We have now reached the
limits to which we can move west
ward and hence men must rise eco
nomically and socially when they con
sider that they have been dealt with
unfairly.
The immediate background is two
old. Workers feel a sense of inse
curity. New methods of industry have
been tending to place more and more
men in the group of the unemployed.
The present economic motive is pro

fit. The manufacturer wants to lower
the cost of production and raise the
price of his article. Labor is the big
item of production cost. Therefore
the laborer finds his wages being
forced down and prices being forced
up. Labor has had an awakening in
the desire to control in some measure
the industry in which it is empl yed.
There has been much talk about de
mocracy. This means that every man
should have an equal chance, and an
equal right to the franchise, and that
there should be no titled class. This
condition exists in religion and in poli
tics. It lioes not exist in industry.
Labor does' not demand the overthrow
of the old order. All they ask is some
hand in the control of the production
end of industry.
Difficulty has arisen not from the
problem but from the atmosphere that
surrounds the problem. The class war
is being carried on with money as a
basis instead of the real things of life
that count. Labor may get more money
and shorter hours of labor but if all
it wants them for is to satisfy its greed
it will always demand more. There
is a bitterness on both sides of the
controversy that must be done away
with.
The problem is one for the middle
class people on a salary to settle. We
must be apostles of a new point of
view. The factions must be shown
that a change of heart must take place.
A common good-will must be installed.
We must have education that will
teach people to think in terms of the
good of society as a whole. The
middle class has a right to ask labor
to stop fighting and to ask capital to
make voluntary surrenders of wealth
and land This will provide a perma
nent evolutionary solution of the prob
lem.
