# "DOWN WITH GLOOM" ACCEPTED AS SLOGAN FOR 'LASUEN LIMP'
## 
### 
"Down with Gloom!" is the keynote
of the "Lasuen Limp" to be held at the
Alpha Phi and Delta Gamma houses
Saturday evening at 8:30. The two
houses used will allow ample room for
every one and a special invitation has
been extended to the "roughs" to enjoy
an event long to be remembered in the
annals of joy.
Everything possible in the way of
real entertainment has been arranged
for. Two Jive "jazz", orchestras, of
which one is from the city, will furnish
the music. Sandwiches, fruit, ice cream
and dainties of every kind will be served
by all the houses taking no part in the
dance. The dance is to be very informal,
in the nature of a jolly-up. Cords will
he in vogue and the men who do not
"queen" will find no trouble in filling
all their dances.
The object of the dance is to pay
off the debt owed by the Women's Club
house, which must be borne by the
women. The affair is one in which
every one is concerned, for the Women's
Clubhouse is used by all on the campus
and will be forced to close if the debt
is not met. Those attending can feel
that in addition to having a wonderful
time they are contributing to a worthy
cause.
The laws of the two houses will be
decorated in Japanese garden stvle.
Tables can be reserved in the "Garden"
by applying to "Retty" McGee at the
Delta Gamma house. Lam* -'is will be
hung along the row, lighting the way
to the scenes of action, and everyone is
urged to lav their work aside and have
me last "real" good time.
