THE BEAK OF
A HAWK
represents the Bird's principal
means of livelihood. It 1b his
killing weapon, his earnlng
power—hence this astute bird
keeps it sharpened to its limit
of efficiency. The hawk does not
use reason or sense — instinct
alone tells him his "working
tools" must be up to standard.
Your reasoning power and
thinking ability should tell you
what the hawk's instinct tells
him. Keep your "EYES" —your
working tools up to the standard.
If you need glasses — WEAR
THEM.
