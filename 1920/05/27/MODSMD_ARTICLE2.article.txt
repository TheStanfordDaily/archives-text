## 
### 
According to an announcement made
last evening at a meeting of the Wom
en's Conference, the sum of $5.00 will
be collected from every sorority house
on the Row in order to help meet the
expenses that will be incurred by Sat
urday evening's affair, "The Lasuen
Limp." Owing to the difficulty of ob
taining music for that evening, only
two houses will be used for dancing.
Delta Gamma and Alpha Phi.
It was also decided to revive last quar
ter's song contest, which was dropped
because of the contribution of only one
song. The purpose of the contest is to
write Stanford a song that can be
used appropriately at women's intercol
legiate contests.
All those desiring to enter the con
test are requested to send their songs to
Marjorie Bryant '21, secretary of Wom
en's Conference, or to Dorothy Johnston
'21, president of Organized Women.
A small gold pin, decorated with the
Stanford seal, will be awarded the per
son writing the best song.
