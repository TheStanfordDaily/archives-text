# ENGINEERS PLAN OUTDOOR SMOKER
## New Central Body to Arrange Get-together for Majors in Chemistry and Engineering 
### 
An outdoor smoker on a large scale
has been chosen by the Engineering
Council as a get together movement for
next Wednesday night, June 2. Five
hundred engineering and chemistry ma
iors will participate in the first out
door all-engineer smoker ever held on
the campus. An elaborate program has
been arranged for the evening's enter
tainment under the direction of a corn
•nittee appointed by the Phi Lambda Up
silon chemistry fraternity. Committee
men in charge of the affair announced
today that in all probability the event
would take place at the bandstand.
The Engineering Council, which con
sists of representatives of the five engi
neering societies. M. E. Society, the C.
E. Society, the G. and M. Society, the
E. E. Society, and Phi Lambda Upsilon,
supervised by a faculty representative, is
a central body organized for the purpose
>112 stimulating further interest in engi
•lecrine. and to bring about a closer re
lationship between the distinctly sep
rate engineering bodies. The constitu
'ion has just been recently ratified which
will insure the Council's ability to stage
i series of get-together events, the first
>112 which will be held June 2.
The all-engineering smoker was in
ire-war days an established custom and
was given each year by one of the five
societies in honor of some well-known
•nan. Hereafter, such events will be
'iven under the auspices of one of the
ocieties directed by the Engineering
