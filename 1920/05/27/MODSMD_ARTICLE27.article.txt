# LEADS ANNOUNCED BY GORDON DAVIS FOR 1920 FARCE
## Mona Gardner, '20, Hawley Mertz, '20, Chosen; Other Parts Are Still Undecided 
### 
Mona Gardner, '20, and ITawley
Mertz, '20, were today cast for the
leading roles of this year's Senior Farce,
"Good Gracious, Annabelle," by Coach
Gordon Davis, '18. The casting of these
two to play the stellar roles assures the
campus that they will be ably handled.
Owing to the peculiar qualifications for
practically an all-star cast for this play,
Coach Davis is as yet unable to an
nounce the entire list of names of those
who will take part.
I he part of Annabelle, the effervescent
and irresponsible divorcee, who not only
spends all her alimony but writes checks
on a depleted bank account, and to cap
the climax is named as co-respondent in
'i divorce suit, will be played by Miss
Gardner. She is well known in catnous
dramatics, having played the leading
role, that of "Gwen," in last year's senior
farce, "Nothing But the Truth." Miss
Gardner has also had a great deal of
experience along the dramatic line at
the I niversity of California, from which
she transferred to Stanford. She was
'i co-author of the 1921 Junior Opera,
"A Leap Year Leap," and is a member
of Chi Omega.
Hawley Mertz, who has been selected
to play opposite Miss Gardner in the
oart of John Rawson, the well-to-do
western land owner, is comparatively a
newcomer to the local stage. Coach
Davis has chosen him, however, from a
large number of tryoutees. because of the
peculiar characteristics of the part.
The final announcement of the cast' is
expected to be made next Monday, ac
cording to the coach.
