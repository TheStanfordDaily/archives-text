# IS ALL THE JOY OF LIFE TO GO?

(THE gasoline shortage on top of prohibition will no doubt make many feel
*â–  that mosit of the joy has been taken out of life. The new announcement
of the extreme shortage of gasoline in California may hit campus machines
pretty hard. No longer will the University have to bother about the chains
and Comptroller Roth will be relieved of the necessity of issuing warnings to
speeding students. The pedestrian will once again come into his own and
old-time democracy will return to the "Farm." Bicycles will no doubht be
come popular and of the worst comes, even the horses which boast Palo Alto
as their home may come in for their share of popularity.
No matter what may be said in favor of the shortage, however, the other
side of the question is a matter for serious consideration. The campus will
mill that variety of the bug which seems to belong chiefly to the Ford species.
Many a student has enjoyed its elastic capacity when, although originally de
signed for two, the bug bravely groans under the enthusiasm of a dozen or
so student-would-be-autoists. But even worse than this is the thought of the
campus missing the thrills of a cutout around the mystic hour of midnight
when the student is .startled from peaceful slumbers. The campus will be
safe and sane for its inmates but who begrudges the startling nature of the
student machine? Safety and sanity means little in the life of the average
young student so all that can be said is expressed in the wish that the gaso
line shortage will soon be over. The one consoling thought about the short
age is, that unlike prohobition, the gasoline deficit is only temporary.
