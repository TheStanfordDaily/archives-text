# LET THE IRISH FIGHT
## 
### 
fOOD OLD IRELAND is having a bad time these days, but England seems
to be getting the worst of the bargain and Lloyd George in particular.
With new trouble breaking out in th Sinn Fein ranks the situation looks to
be more serious than ever before. The Sinn Fein men have shown that they
mean what they say when they threaten to burn public buildings if their
words and orders are not acted upon. It almost reminds one of French Revo
lutionary days if an outside power wasn't trying to settle an unsettled ques
tion. The French were at least left to themselves to fight the problem out
and when the scrap was over no one had any kick to offer.
More than one liberal-minded citizen of the world hsa often wished that
the Irish would get in and settle their domestic difficulties. Recent develop
ments have more or less shaken any faith in the ability of England to handle
the situation. The problem seems to be one which forestalls any sane so
lution from the outside as neither side seems to be able to definitely settle
the fight in an open scrap. The Irish are known for their temper and their
patriotism for the green sod. It seems as though the first characteristic is
running rampant at the present time. If they were given the chance for a
little open fighting, the chances are they might develop the loyalty idea a
little more and forget the temper. In any case it would seem that the sooner
England lets Ulster and the rest of Ireland go to it the better for all con
cerned.

WE NOTICE that the "New Bookshelf" is circulating "The Life of
Leonard Wood." From all indications the library would be wise to keep the
volume out of sight if they don't want a violent demonstration within the
peaceful portals of the Hall of Study.

THE STEAMSHIP LINES in advertising dancing on the "Stanford

DR. ROBERTS says that the public should have a new labor attitude.
If this includes a few I. W. W.'s and red flag-wavers, many of us would be
strong for it.

WE NOTICE that guns honored the Queen's birthday in London. Dublin
seemed to feel even worse than that on the subject.

ACCORDING to recent campaign reports, it seems to be an expensive pro
position to land a living in the White House.

WE ARE GLAD to see that there is still some hope for the Sophomore
Cap. It sure looked hopeless for a while.

SWIMMERS in the lake these days have to chew a place to swim be
fore the suicide dip is really a success.
IF privacy means anything to Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks, they
are sure out of luck.

SPEAKING of dirty politics, Carranza certainly got a taste of it.

THE LASUEN LIMP ought to get by on the novelty of the names.
