# Stanford Artillerymen to Attend Summer Camp at Louisville, Kentucky
## 
### 
Fifteen members of the Stanford Field
Artillery unit will attend the summer
camp to be held at Camp Knox, Louis
ville, Ky., from June 17 to July 28. Six
weeks' instruction at Camp Knox will
be required of all the advanced students
in artillery units throughout the country
who have not been exempted because of
active military service. The neces
sary expenses of the local contingent will
be paid from the date it leaves Stanford
until the return trip from Louisville is
made. The Stanford artillerymen prob
ably will touch the main middle western
cities on their summer trip.
The infantry camp for the western uni
versities will be conducted at Camp
Kearney during the same period that the
artillerymen are at Camp Knox. Only
one Stanford man will attend the Kear
ney camp.
A bill is now pending before Congress
to pay all advanced students while at
tending the summer camps. This pro
posal is being urged in order to stimulate
interest in the work of the R. O. T. C.
units. The lack of pay for the six weeks'
time spent at the camp has heretofore
prevented many from registering in the
advanced military courses.
