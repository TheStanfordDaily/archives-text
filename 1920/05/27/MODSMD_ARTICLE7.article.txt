## 
### 
The first 1921 Quad was produced
complete in its new cover this after
noon at Kitchen's binding plant in
Sacramento. The books will be turn
ed out in rapid order until Saturday
evening when they should be ready
for transportation to the campus.
Manager M. A. Kline announced today
that the books will be distributed on
Monday.
The new yearbook is the largest
ever published at Stanford. From its
clever cover stamp to the large "Josh"
section the book is said to feature a
new and unique art scheme designed
and carried out under the direction of
R. C. Alexander and such assistants
as John B. Matthews, and Louise I).
Tessin.
Tins book is said to represent an ef
ficiency of organization and the sys
tematic working of a large staff.

Editor McElroy has included in the
yearbook a large number of campus |
views, some of which have not prevl-1
ously been presented to the campus |
public. A unique air-plane view is i
among these. An excellent effect has I
been secured by producing the better j
pictures on a new rough paper with â€¢
a fine grade of duo-tone ink.
The San Francisco Medical School!
is given a section in the yearbook for |
the first time. It was felt by many'
persons that the medical schools of the I
city are an integral part of the Uni
versity and should be represented in
its official annual.
McElroy brought the first complete
yearbook from Sacramento this after
noon, and will probably place it on ex
hibition at the Bookstore.
Most of the yearbooks have been'
sold by the coupon method, accord-1
ing to the manager's statement.
