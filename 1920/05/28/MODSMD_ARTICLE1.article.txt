Filling a long-felt need for a faculty
dramatic coach, Gordon Arthur Davis,
'18, was appointed Instructor in Eng
lish and Dramatics at a meeting of the
Board of Trustees this afternoon. A
number of changes in board commit
tees were also made, and the resigna
tion of Professor Vernon Kellogg was
accepted. Professor Kellogg has been
made secretary of the National Re

Timothy Hopkins was elected trea
surer of the Board to fill the vacancy
caused by the death of Leon Sloss.
Mr. Hopkins is senior member of the
board, having been appointed in 1885.
He was for a number of years presi
dent of the board. He is one of the
largest benefactors of the University,
amonf? his most notable gifts being
the Hopkins Marine Station at Pacific
Grove, and the Hopkins Railway Lib
rary, one of the most comprehensive
in existance on the subject of railway
history and administration.
Judge John T. Nourse, '00, and
Thomas T. Gregory, '99, were elected
chairmen of the University Committee
and Finance Committee of the Board,
respectively. These committees are
the principal ones through which the
Boarci organizes and carries on its
work, and these appointments indicate
the recognition of responsibility of the
alumni of the University in its work.
As a member of the English Depart
ment of the University, Davis will de
vote a considerable part of his time to
training students in dramatic produc
tions and acting as coach for the casts
of the annual plays given by the vari
ous classes and organizations, if they
desire his services. Davis took a
prominent part in college dramatics
while an undergraduate and coached
the majority of the principal stage
productions of the University this
year.
Although Professor Kellogg has for
some time been absent from the Uni
versity, in relief work, and later in
research work, he remained a member
of the staff. He is the author of a
number of books dealing with Amer
ica's participation in the war, and
with problems growing out of the war,
his recent work being a biography of
Herbert Hoover. Mr. Kellogg came to
Stanford in 1894 as Professor of Ento
mology.
The Board approved of the immedi
ate building of a number of residences
on the campus to rent to members of
the faculty. There has been a de
mand for such houses for faculty mem
bers for some time, and at present
there are waiting lists for houses now
rented by the University to faculty
families. From seven to ten houses
will be built at first.
