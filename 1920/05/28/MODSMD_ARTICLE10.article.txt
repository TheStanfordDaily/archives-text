# PASSPORTS PROVIDED FOR ENGINEER SMOKER
## Guests Will Wear Tags as Food Tickets at Smoker Wednesday Night 
### 
Five hundred identification tags are
being printed for the guests of the all
engineering smoker which is to be held
011 Wednesday evening, June 2. In or
der to accommodate so large a crowd
the committee in charge of the affair
plans to make the smoker an outdoor
event. Arrangements have been made
to hold the entertainment at the band
stand, and in order to insure engineers
of a sufficient quantity of eats, the com
mittee has ordered tags to be printed on
which the wearer's passport will be writ
ten. Engineering and Chemistry majors
may get their "food tickets" from repre
sentatives of any one of the five en
gineering societies.
In pre-war days the all-engineering
smoker was an annual affair, held un
der the auspices of one of the engineer
ing societies and was usually given in
honor of some well-known man. Be
cause of the unusually large attendance
expected this year, the smoker must be
staged outdoors. Phi Lambda Upsilon
chemistry fraternity is in charge of the
smoker, directed by the Engineering
Council. The committee announced to
dav that the entire affair would be free
to all engineering and chemistry majors.
The expenses have been covered by a
special assessment levied on the various
societies.
An elaborate program has been worked
out and will be ready for publication by
Monday.
