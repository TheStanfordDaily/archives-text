# DAVIS DEFEATS HOWELL IN JUMP
## El Campo Leads Varsity Team With Zetes Second; Breaker in Non-Varsity Division 
### 
Winning the broad jump with a leap
of 21 feet I inch, Gene Davis crawled
up a few points yesterday on Mint
Howell, who is at present holding indi
vidual honors in the varsity division of
the intramural pentathalon. Howell
came second in the jump.
Only the mile run which will be held
Monday afternoon, remains to complete
the five events. The scores of the lead
ers in varsity competition follow: How
ell. 2,650.64; Davis, 2,495.12; Heath
2,383.24; K. Wright. 2,201.44; Scofield,
2,199.68; Thompson, 2,134.64; Maynard,
Carlsmith, 1,872.24.
HI Campo maintains a lead in the
group running, having scored 5.643.12
points; Zeta I'si is second with 5,491.40;
and the Breakers rates third with 4.928.36
points. â€¢
In the non-varsity competition, "Mutt"
TempUton is almost 500 points ahead of
Anderson, their scores Ming: 2,454.04
to 2,396.64. Hayes, Toland, Roberts, and
Kallatn are listed in the order named.
Each has been credited with over 2,000
points.
The Breakers have forged further
ahead in the group rating in this divi
sion, having 17.962.32 points. Theta Xi
is second, with 15,183.68; and Alpha
Sigma Phi third, with 12,447 38.
Unless Davis runs the mile several
seconds faster than Howell, the first
prize will go to the freshman field star.
It is expected that the records of Carl
smith, Maynard, Elliott, and Thompson
will pick up noticeably after the points
from the mile have been compiled.
