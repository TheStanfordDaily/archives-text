# MASQUERS' PLAYS ATTAIN GOOD BALANCE
## Preliminary Rehearsals Show Great Amount of New Talent 
### 
Perfect balance is the keynote of the
three plays to be produced by Masquers
next Thursday evening. From sparkling
humor and comical situations in"The
Constant Lover," the curtain-raiser, to
the tragedy and pathos in the climax of
"Ryland" the interest of the audience
is sustained throughout.
Rehearsals for the plays have been
progressing satisfactorily, acocrding to
the coaches, and a great deal of new
talent is being developed. Especially is
this' shown in "Avland," and Margaret
Shedd, '20, who is directing the play,
expects the cast to be in full readiness
for the final curtain next Thursday.
In Stoddard Atwood, '22. is all that
could be desired for the part of Ryland,
the leading character of the play by that
name. The preliminary rehearsals have
■hown, said Miss Shedd, that he has the
ability to portray a certain amount of
nonchalant resignedness without losing
to the audience the pathos of the situa
tion.
The plot of the play, while compara
tively simple .is worked up in a way
which keeps the audience guessing un
til the final curtain. The scene opens
in an English prison, with Ryland con
demned to death. Then conies Aneeli
ca, and with her the complications which
keep the final outcome in doubt.
The setting for the plays, which is to
be over the lake, allows a wonderful op
portunity for the use of various light
ing effects, and this the coaches are plan
ning to take full advantage of. A huge
cable is to be laid, which will furnish the
electricity for the numerous spotlights
on both sides of the stage. The society
is planning to make this an experiment
in outdoor play production at Stanford,
a thing which has not been attempted
in recent years.
