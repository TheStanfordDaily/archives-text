# KNOX RESOLUTION KILLED BY HOUSE ACTION 219-152
## Attempt to Over-ride Veto of President Fails When Less Than Necessary Votes Cast 
### United Press 
WASHINGTON, May 28.—The
Knox peace resolution was killed to
day by the action of the House in
refusing to override the president's
veto. The vote was 219 for overrid
ing and 152 against, or 25 less than the
necessary two-thirds.
The majority in the House last week,
when the Knox draft was accepted as a
substitute for the measure passed by the
lower branch, was seventeen votes short
of the two-thirds necessary to override
the veto, and the Democrats pointed out
at the time that they would require only
four more votes to sustain the veto,
even with the full membership present.
Democratic leaders predicted tonight
that the lineup tomorrow will be prac
tically the same as last week, and the
Republicans were inclined to agree with
this forecast. If the veto is sustained
in the House it will not "o to the Sen
ate.
Reading of the veto message was
marked by no unusual incidents. Few
more than half of the members were
present, and most of the seats in the
gallery were unoccupied.
