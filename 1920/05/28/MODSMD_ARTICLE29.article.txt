# SUCCESS TO THE LASUEN LINP
## 
### 
fTHE LASUEN LIMP is a noval innovation in Stanford life and it will be with
considerable interest that many of the old-timers will watch this last
venture in women's activities. Outside of the social nature of the affair, there
is much to be said in favor of it. In the first place it is to be given for the
benefit of the Women's Clubhouse. Very few students in the University take
an active interest in the financial support of the Clubhouse. The women pay
their dollar per year on their registration fee and let it go at that. As a mat
ter of fact, they do their share toward support but many overlook the fact
that men use the Women's Clubhouse almost as much as the women them
selves do. It is a convenient meeting place for committees which have both
men and women serving on them. Mrs. Ewell is always obliging in making
arrangements for meetings even though it causes considerable inconvenience.
Beside committee meetings, dances are popular and in keeping with the policy
of the Board that the Clubhouse rents should be as low as possible, the rent
for the hall covers the expenses of janitor service and electricity, and that
is about all. Clubs and organizations of one kind and another which list
men in their membership meet constantly in the Clubhouse gratis.
To make the situation worse, the Wonjen's Clubhouse has no such sources
of income as the Union has. The Union has considerable space which is
rented out. This forms a source of profitable income which the Women's
Clubhouse entirely lacks. More than that the Union has the support of at
least three times the number of students the Women's Clubhouse has. Not
begrudging a cent that the Union receives, the Daily Palo Alto does advocate
some plan to be worked out whereby the Women's Clubhouse receive suf
ficient support to put the building on a paying basis.
In view of this situation the Lasuen lamp should prove to be a wonder
tul success. The aid which will be given from the proceeds will do much
to tide over the financial troubles of the Women's Clubhouse. The remedy
is not permanent, yet if something is not done immediately there is a pos
sibility of the Clubhouse closing. Practically every student in the Univer
sity at one time or another has enjoyed the privileges which the Women's
Clubhouse offers and in appreciation of this fact it is to be hoped that they
will give the needed support to make the Lasuen Limp a success and enjoy
themselves thoroughly at the same time.
