# OUR TRIBUTE TO THE SIXTY-NINE
## 
### 
UVERY Stanford man or woman at one time or another feels that intangible
thing known as Stanford Spirit. The first thrill of our freshman days
brought something into our hearts which we had never experienced before,
a reverence, an inspiration, a feeling for all that was fine in University life
but more particularly a realization of what Stanford would hold for us in the
four wonderful years which lay ahead. That was out first lesson in Stanford
spirit. As the years slipped by other lessons more potent and more real came
to us, lacking, perhaps, the thrill of the first days on the yet even
more precious because more than once that lesson demanded a sacrifice for
Stanford in one way or the other. All of us at one time or another have given
something of ourselves to make Stanford the great university of the West.
It is this bit of sacrifice which fans the undying life of that intangible some
thing known as Stanford Spirit.
Sunday morning it will be our privilege to pay a tribute to sixty-nine
Stanford men who held all the fineness which Stanford has to give within
their hearts, sixty-nine men who know the joy of giving such as many of us
will never know. The spirit of their sacrifice will always live within Stan
ford hearts. The call has come for every man and women in the student body
to gather together and pay the tribute befitting the memory of those whom
Stanford looks toward with a pride and emotion too deep for words. Most
of those men would have been here with us, if the other call had not come,
and many of us, in the belief that they are not dead but still living, will wel
come this opportunity to show them that we have not forgotten so soon.
The call has been issued by each of the class presidents and the presi
dent of the student body for students and faculty to meet in the Memorial
Court, Sunday morning, where the students will march into the Church by
classes. The services will be simple and impressive. No time nor effort has
been spared on the beautiful music which will express the spirit of the ser
vice. No words will be spoken in the entire service and the success of the
tribute depends upon the spirit with which the students of the University"
enter into their share of the service. Many of us feel deeply the spirit of the
occasion and we will not fail to show our appreciation when Sunday morning
comes.
