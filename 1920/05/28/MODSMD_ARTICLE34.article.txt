# RAILROAD TICKETS ARE LEGAL TENDER
## Dearth of Small Change in Mexico Forces General Use of Substitute

. CITY OF MEXICO, May 1. (By
Mail.) â€”Having made a ten-cent pur
chase, the resident of Mexico City ex
tends the store-keeper a 50-centavo or
one peso bill. He awaits for change.
The clerk, fumbling in his pocket or
the cash drawer, produces a stack of
street car tickets. The proper change
is counted out, in tickets, the custom
er pockets them and the transaction
is complete.
Such is the situation in Mexico to
day as regards small change.
The situation is improving, however.
Not that there is any prospect of an
increase in the amount of small
change. The outlook in that respect
is as gloomy as ever but the trades
men have agreed to accept the tick
ets as legal tender. When everyone
in town had acquired so much
"change" that there was no need of
walking, even for a block, the rest of
one's natural life, the merchants de
cided it was only fair that they take
some of it back.
So now the senor-about-town pays
for his cocktails in tram ducats and
the woman in the market place lays
down the same currency in payment
for her vegetables.
Just why this change shortage
should exist nobody seems to know.
The people blame it on the govern
ment, just as everything is blamed on
the governments the world over, but
the Ministry of the Treasury declares
it has been issuing small bronze pieces
in increasing amounts. The fact re
mains, whatever the cause, that al
most every variety of "change" in
Mexico is sold at a premium ranging
from 5 to 15 per cent. Government
authorities blame speculators for this
condition. They have been hoarding
the coins, it is declared, so as to exact
a premium on their sale after they
cornered the market.
The shortage is greatest, and most
annoying, in the case of 5, 10 and 20-
cent bronze pieces. Formerly there
were silver pieces, but these have dis
appeared altogether, just as the 50-
cent silver coins disappeared when the
government began to issue paper bills.
Never was there a better illustration
of the economic theory that "cheap
money" always crowds "high priced
money" out of circulation.
