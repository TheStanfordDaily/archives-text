# EXPERIENCED DEBATERS WILL RETURN NEXT YEAR
## 
### 
Ten men experienced in forensic
activities will return to Stanford next
year, from which Coach M. L. Mc-
Clintock will probably be able to se
lect the best debating teams sent out
by the University for several years.
The debating schedule for the coming
year will be cut from seven to three
contests in order that the coach may
devote more time to training the in
dividual speakers. Tryouts will be
conducted in the future to replace the
squad system used in the study of
questions for discussion during the
past season.
Many of the returning speakers
were developed under the regime of
the squad system, and with the inten
sive training offered by frequent group
contests most of them may now be
regarded as seasoned speakers.
IV W. Ooodman, '22, who partici
pated in the intercollegiate contest
with the University of California, and
who replaced W. F. Leiser, '21, in the
Joffre debate this spring will probobly
be one of the strongest contenders for
the fall quarter team next year.
W. F. Leiser, 21, has been a mem
ber of the Joffre squad for three con
secutive seasons and will without
doubt continue his work in the annual
contest next season.
C. J. Crobaugh, '20, and P. F. Erick
son, '21, have taken part in several

intercollegiate debates, including the
Pacific Coast League contests with the
Universities of Washington and Ore
gon last quarter, and with Occidental
College and the University of Southern
California in the closing debates oft
the season.
T. E. Bowen, 23, and J. F. Miller, '21,
were colleagues with Erickson and
Crobaugh in the debates in southern
California. Both men are experienced
speakers and will probably be included
in a next year's team.
A. J. Anglim, '23, L. W. Hodges, '21,
and T. G. Irwin, '23, discussed a prob
lem on compulsory arbitration with a
team representing the University of
Redlands at the beginning of the
spring quarter. The trio will prob
ably contest for places on 'one of the
teams next season.
R. C. Fisher, '22, and W. M. Kil
patrick, '23, debated with the Universi
ty of Washington in the Pacific Coast
League contest this year. They were
considered one of the strong teams of
the season and are expected to resume
their activities at the beginning of
the next schedule.
The return of so strong a squad
should insure a series of successful
contests for the Cardinal during the
1921 season. Coach McClintock has
expressed his satifaction with the out
look for the coming year and predicts
a majority of Stanford victories.
