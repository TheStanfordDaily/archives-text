Final respcct and tribute to the sixty
nine Stanford nien whose remains rest
on French and Belgian battlefields will
be paid Sunday morning in the Me
morial Church when the student body,
faculty and alumni gather for dedicative
services.
Word received during the past few
days by the committee in charge of the
program is to the effect that a large rep
resentation of alumni from all parts of
the state will be present.
No effort is being spared to make
Sunday's service not only the most im

the University has ever known, and at
the same time a thrilling memorial ex
perience for music lovers.
The University choir will be augment
ed by singers from the Morris Club and
others, making a total of 100 voices.
Each class will be formed in a column
of twos at 10:10 o'clock.
