The exhibition of original drawings
by Kainan Teizo Shimada, which will
open at the Art Gallery June 1 will be
of unusual interest to the art student as
showing the pure Japanese art. Mr.
Shimada studied at the University of
Kyoto, Japan, and his style is not in
fluenced by Eastern or European technic.
Some of the drawings are views of this
country interpreted according to the Jap
anese school of art. This is the first time
that the drawings have been publicly
exhibited. They will be on view until
June 21.
The Contemporary Artists' exhibition

about forty oil paintings by the best
artists of New York, Philadelphia, and
Boston. Emma Lampart Cooper, and
Leonard Ochtman represent the Nation
al Academy group. Hugh Breckenridge
and George Harding are the most noted
of the Philadelphia showing. Among
the artists of Boston are Lilla Cabot
Perry, and Leslie P. Thompson. The
exhibition comes on the American Fed
eration of Arts circuit, of which Stan
ford is a member.
