### Untried Press 
LOS ANGELES, May 28.â€”Olympic
stock at the University of Southern
California has risen several points
since John Boyle, '23, recently acquir
ed the knack of tossing the discus
consistently over the 140-foot mark.
Yesterday his best throw was 145 feet,
6 inches. From all indications, his
only opponent of note in the west is
Gus Pope of the University of Wash
ington, whose best record in a meet
is 140 feet, 6 inches.
Boyle seems to have suddenly learn
ed how to toss the platter. Until the
Southern California A. A. U. meet at
Pomona College, Swede Evans was the
Trojan's best bet in the Grecian event,
as well as being the best man in the
South. Boyle upset the dope in the
meet, his fling besting both Evans of
U. S. C., and Widdes, of Pomona.
Thirteen throws over 140 feet out of
25 attempts, represents Boyle's per
formance. A week ago his best mark
was 138 feet 2 inches, with the week
before that a high mark of 132 feet.
Boyle will have to heave at least
145 feet to place on the American
team going to the Olympic meet at
Antwerp, Belgium. From all indica
tions, he will make a berth with the
squad, if he continues to keep up his
present performance.
The University of Southern Califor
nia has, in addition to the big fresh
man, two other men of Olympic cali
ber, namely Charles Paddock, in the
hundred, and George Schiller, who
runs the 440. Gwynn Wilson is also
considered a possibility in the 440
hurdles.
