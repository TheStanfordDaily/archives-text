CAMBRIDGE, May 28.—With the
adoption today of the five-column news
page instead of the four-column one
to which it has adhered since 1883,
The Harvard Crimson, Harvard's cam
pus daily, has taken a step which it
has long contemplated. For several
years the Crimson has been the only
one of the undergraduate journals
among the larger colleges and uni
versities of the country to hold to the
small page form. Now. however, that
the Crimson is installed in permanent
quarters and has recovered from the
slack season during the war, the
change has finally been made.
