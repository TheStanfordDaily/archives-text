Yale, Massachusetts Institute of Tech
nology, Brown, Rutgers, Syracuse,
Cornell, Dartmouth, Pennsylvania and

Stanford University, the University of

California, Washington State College,
the University of Oregon, and Oregon
Agricultural College having exception
ally strong men. Morris Kirksey. Stan
! ford sprinter, is the favorite in the
dashes. His time in both the hundred
: yard and 220-yard events indicates that
jhe will have an excellent chance to win
| both. In the high jump, R. L. Tem
pleton of Stanford is conceded to be one
of the most formidable entries. The third
member of the Stanford team, Captain
i Wells, should make a good appearance
in the hurdle races.
| Jenne of Washington State College is
1 conceded first place in the pole vault if
j he keeps the form he has been showing
|in meets on the Pacific Coast. Bartlett,
] the discus thrower from the University
of Oregon, considered the best Westerner

ter event. "Jit" Smith, W. S. C. dis
tance man, should figure in the two-mile
eevnt.
| The University of California's seven
j man team should figure in the point col
umn. Hendrixson, quarter-miler; Sprott,
in the half-mile; and Merchant, in the
broad jump, are consiered the most like
ly men from California. Swan, the Ore
gon Agricultural College miler, is the
dangerous candidate from the West in
that event.
Preliminaries in most of the events
will be run off today.
FRANKLIN FIELD, Philadelphia, May 28.—The pick of American track
and field athletes played to almost an empty stadium in the opening of the
44th Intercollegiate championship today.
The stage was crowded with the athletes of thirty American colleges, but
the stands were only filled by a hot, pouring sun.
Stanford University got off to a flying start by qualifying both her runners
in the hundred-yard dash. Only trials in qualifying events were scheduled in
the opening program.

The first appearence of the eight
California stars attracted attention
while warming up in mid-field.
More than thirty colleges were enter
ed. The greatest entries were made
by Stanford, California, Princeton,
Yale, Massachusetts Institute of Tech
nology, Brown, Rutgers, Syracuse,
Cornell, Dartmouth, Pennsylvania and
Purdue.

100 yards—First heat, Brown (I 1 .), 10
