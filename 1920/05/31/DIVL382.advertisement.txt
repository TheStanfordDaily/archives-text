PROCRASTINATION
THE THIEF OF TIME
If John D. Rockefeller had "put
off until next week" the effort
that started the Standard Oil
Co., he might still be a poor
laborer.
If Sergeant York had "pro
crastinated" at the battle of the
Argonne, he never would have
enjoyed the distinction of being ,
the greatest hero of the world
war.
DO IT NOW
has always been the slogan of
men who accomplish things. So
with you—if your eyes are beg
ging for the aid of glasses—DO
IT NOW —don't force your eyes
to pay the price of your pro
crastination.
