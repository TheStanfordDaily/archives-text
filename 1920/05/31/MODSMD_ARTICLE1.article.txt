# HONOR IS PAID MEN WHO FELL IN WORLD. WAR
## Immortal Stanford Heroes Who Died for Freedom Revered at Church Services 
### 
If our sons in the generations to come
should ever forget, the dead will rise
to rccall to thcin this common duty.—
Marshal Foch.
These words from the great Allied
Generalissimo, as they appeared on the
programs of the Memorial service held
yesterday morning in the Church in
honor of the sixty-nine men of Stanford
who laid their lives on the altar of free
dom, tended to stand out in contrast to
the real significance of the occasion, and
the spirit personified.
More than 2 000 students, alumni and
relatives of deceased Stanford service
men packed themselves into the Church
to pay solemn tribute. The services in
their simplicity and sincerity played upon
the very heart strings of the relatives
and members of the Board of Trustees
who occupied pews of honor on the ros
trum. With the sounding of taps from
the choir loft in the rear of the Church
heads bowed in reverence, tears came
into the eyes of Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur,
persident of the University, and mem
bers of the Board of Trustees.
The tribute paid yesterday was from
a humble University to its great men
who have passed to the beyond, and the
manner in which the students turned out.
conclusively showed the spirit of rcv
crence in which the memory of Stan
ford's fallen are held.
The faculty, alumni, and students by
classes marched to reserved sections on
the lower floor of the Church from the
Memorial Court. $
Frank L. King, student body president,
followed by Class Presidents Le Mari
nel, Sibley, Doyle, and Sturgeon, passed
in single file down the center isle of the
Church. The class presidents carried
wreaths of copper beech leaves. Fol
lowing at a distance was President Rav
.Lyman Wilbur, carrying a like wreath
with a Cardinal bow attached. Dr. D.
Charles Gardner was the last in the line
of honorary march.
The wreaths were placed on standards
stationed on either side of the rostrum,
the one carried by Dr. Wilbur being
placed in the front center of the Sanc
tuary.
Bagby Fowler and Timothy Hopkins,
respectively, represented the alumni and
Board of Trustees.
Verdi's Requiem was rendered by the
University choir, assisted b" symphony
artists from San Francisco and San
Jose.
More than $1,000 was spent by the
University in bringing the music to its
excellence in caliber and duality.
One thousand seats were reserved for
the students on the lower floor, several
hundred more than that number of stu
dents responding.
Services yesterday were declared bv
those connected with the University as
being the most effective yet held in the
history of the institution.
An atmosphere of reverence prevailed
throughout the musical rendition, the
charm remaining unbroken until the last
clear strains of taps had carried awav
and benediction had been pronounced by
Dr. Gardner.
