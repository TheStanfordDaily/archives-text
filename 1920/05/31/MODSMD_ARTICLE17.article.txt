# Hot Denial Sent To Washington By Local Hoover Club
## 
### 
Testimony of Alexander McCabe, one
of Hiram Johnson's California mana
gers, before the Senate Campaign In
vestigation Committee Saturday, to tin
effect that 300 Stanford students had
been paid to work for Herbert Hoover
in San Francisco, was branded as an
"absolute falsehood" in a telegram for
warded to the committee today by J.
G. Driscoll. '18, president of the Stanford
Hoover Club.
The telegram follows:
"Press dispatches quote Alexander Mc-
Cabe as testifying before your commit
tee that 300 Stanford University stu
dents were hired by the Hoover organi
ation on nrimary election day. This
statement is an absolute falsehood.
There were no 300 workers and there
was not a red cent paid for their serv
ices.
The facts which our records will tes
tify are as follows:
This crganiation conducted a group of
125 volunteer students to San Francisco,
a distance of thirty miles, on the night of
the election, for the purpose of watching
the count, and paid the bare cost of
transportation. The men paid their own
meals and their own street car fare. The
total expense of the trio was $175.C0.
I am prepared to forward a sworn
affidavit if it is requested."

there were any millionaires on the
Hoover delegation, McCabe said he
"never counted them but there were
a considerable number."
McCabe asserted that the Johnson
forces used about $50,000 in the Cali
fornia campaign, and testified that
