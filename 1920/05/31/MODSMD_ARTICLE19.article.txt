# DRIVE WILL START MEMORIAL FUND
## 
### 
Last year's campaign for funds to con
struct the Stanford Memorial I Tall yield
ed only half of the local quota, taken
from an appropriation of $150 000 to be
realized in four years. A second solicit
in!? of the campus will take place next
Wednesday, at which time all new stu
dents will be reached. In three more
years when the fund has been fullv col
lected the construction of the building
will be started.
The drive last year included all the
students of the campus and was readily
met. Within the next three years the
balance of the amount is expected to be
obtained from new students and those
once contributing will not be solicited
again. The canvas Wednesday will be
made on the basis of the different living
groups.
Anyone wishing to donate can pay off
their obligation by the installment nlan.
but the total contributions must he col
lected before or during the year 1923.
