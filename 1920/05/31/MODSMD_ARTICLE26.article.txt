# "GIRLS UNDEMOCRA TIZABLE"

"ller ideal world is a world of special privileges for the few, she
to be one of the few. The woman's word of distinction is 'exclusive'
which is measured by the people she docs not know. If you want to
make girls democratic, the first step is to make them into boys."â€”
Fresno Republican.
rrilE above extract taken from the Fresno Republican seems to be an ex
pression of Chester Rowell's opinion of Stanford women which is rather
surprising considering the close connection which many have felt that Mr.
Rowell has maintained with the University. If Mr. Rowell really believes
what he writes, it would be worth his while to spend a little time on the
Stanford campus and observe a few things first hand about the "500."
Mr. Rowell seems not to realize that he is talking about the girl of
yesterday. Mr. Rowell seems to forget that the day of the pink tea is over
and that life in this generation holds too many thrills for any young girl to
sit quietly at home and amuse herself over the society squabbles of the hour.
Mr. Rowell's statement well applies to the social butterfly, but Stanford lays
claim to having a little more in the feminine head than a knowledge of table
manners. Campus activities are so regulated that if a woman has any aspi
rations toward prestige on the campus she shies at the word "exclusive" and
goes in strong for the good old time democrat on the "Farm."
The sorority question evolved the outburst in the first place. It was Mr.
Rowell's contention that any university action toward abolishing sororities
would not eliminate snobbishness at Stanford, because women were inherently
snobbish and in the words of Mr. Rowell, "If you want to make girls demo
cratic, the first step is to make them into boys." Mr. Rowell maintains that
until women can have the contact with the world that men have, they will
always be "exclusive" rather than "prominent" or "democratic."
This statement seems hardly fair even when directed at most women in
general and more particularly when directed at such a group of women as
are found at Stanford. Admitting that women do not as a whole have the
opportunity to go out into the world and rub up against the stern realities
of life, at the same time it must be admitted that the average woman of
the present day has a comparatively broad field of activities outside of her
home life. This is even more true of the college woman. In the period dur
ing the war and since that time, women have proved themselves capable of
strong, vigorous, intelligent work. There always will be a certain class of the
pink-tea variety, but on the other hand, the male will probably never escape
from the parasite lounge-lizard type. Stanford women don't claim to be
Amazons nor do they claim to be militant suffragettes. They are just as
feminine as any women in the world but at the same time they do lay claim
toward mr.king an attempt to use the brains the good Lord gave them and
in no sense can it be said with any fairness that Stanford women are guilty
of the bigoted nonsense which Mr. Rowell sets forth against them.
