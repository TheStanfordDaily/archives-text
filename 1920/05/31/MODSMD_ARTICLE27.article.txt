# BOOKS AS FRIENDS
## 
### 
JT is a peculiar thing that most college men and women are surprisingly
poorly read in comparison with what might be expected of a college man or
woman. In the hurried life of co-education, at least, the famous lines of
Omar Khayyam,
"A Book of Verses underneath the Bough" doeß not seem to apply although
"A Jug of Wine, a Loaf of Bread —and thou" is a more or less common
occurrence on the beautiful ground of the Estate. In other words it is good
company and a little liquid refreshment which makes the Wilderness a Para
dise rather than any intellectual indulgence in the modern educational insti
tution.
Yet for many of us this summary is hardly quite fair. We always have
the best intentions of reading but there never seems to be time to make the
reading an accomplished fact. We hear of books we would read and wo
long for the opportunity. We make out lists of books we would read and
we long for the opportunity. We make out lists of books which must be read
but somehow the list is thrown aside for the more pressing duties of the hour.
Books are very like friends. You have to deliberately cultivate them
and you have to do your share to keep up a friendly relationship. You have
to TAKE the time to cultivate them and like anything else worth-while in this
world, you are always repaid for the effort. If you are not inspired by the
excellence of your choice, at least you have learned to avoid that variety in
the next attempt. Books prove constant friends untouehed by the vagaries
of human life. You can count upon them to make life more worth the living.
If you don't enjoy reading cultivate the habit. If you do enjoy reading,
cultivate the habit and take time to read. It is part of your education and
mine. Take time to read or the faculties which once gave you the power of
appreciation will be dulled and one of the greatest pleasures of life will lie
worthless at your feet.
