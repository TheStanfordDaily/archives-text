# "MAKE TENNIS A MAJOR SPORT"—ALLYN BARBER '18
## 
### Allyn H. Barber, '18 
For the past two years a feeling has
been growing on the campus that
something is fundamentally wrong
with the development of Stanford ten
nis teams. Two generations of stu
dents have come and gone since the
Cardinal has scored a win over the
Blue and Gold and whatever different
of opinion there may be as to the
causes, the outstanding fact is tha
something must be done, and done a
once.
It is true that Stanford has had he
individual stars. There is no brightei
light in the tennis world than Lii
Murray, '13, twice a national champion
More than a few of the championshi]
tournament cups of the Pacific Coasi
are engraved with the names of sue!
Stanford men as Herbert Hahn, '1G
and Van Dyke John, '18. However al
these men were finished players be
fore they ever came to Stanford, ex
perience in tournament play and need
ing only the added strength of year:
to bring them to the top of their game
And the fact stands out to our dis
credit that there has not been a singh
first class man developed in Stanfon
in the last twelve years. You wil
doubtless say that tennis is a gam<
which must be played from boyhoo
up—constantly played from the tim<
one is old enough to hold onto s
racket. That, it is true, has beei
more or less the history of many o
our Pacific Coast stars, but it is nol
universally so by any means, for the
University of California has consist
ently been turning out the finest kind
of tennis men who entered college a:
very mediocre material. Two recenl
examples of this are Ax Gravem, '17
who is slated to play with the
American Davis Cup team this year
and Ed Levy, '19, who is winning
matches from the best college teams
in the East at the present time.
Right here is the flaw in the Stan
ford system—a failure to develop oui
available material. And why can't wc
do the same as California has, evei
on a minor sport basis 112 The answei
is simply this: The men who pla}
receive absolutely no inducement oi
encouragement. The University fur
nishes them with very little flnancia
assistance. They must pay for al
their own equipment. They go out
for a Block "S"; out for some sport 1

receiving student body attention and
support. And neither you nor I can
blame them. But the sad part for
Stanford lies in this; that while they
may be capable of the highest develop
rnent as tennis players, capable of
winning from every college on the
•oast, as tratkmen, as ball-players, or
iasketball men, they are only medi
>cre, not better than a soore of others
trying out for the same position.
While Stanford has compelled its
ilayers to compete on a minor sport
iasis, practically every other school
>n the Pacific Coast rates tennis as
x major sport. This is true of the
University of California, University of
Washington, U. S. C., Occidental and
In the big eeastern univer
ities such as Harvard, Yale, Pirnce
on, Pennsylvania and Cornell tennis
ias been on a major sport basis for
nany years. It take 9 no large mental
ly then to find the reason who all the
'oung high school players are planning
o attend the University of California
ather than Stanford. This future
reneration cannot and must not be
snored.
The whole matter will come before
he voters of this University next
■Vednesday. Many have asked on what
asis letters would be awarded. It Is
he present plan that only those who
vin their matches in the dual meet
vith California, who win at the annual
)jai tournament (which represents the
California intercollegiate champion-)
hip) or who win either the singles or !
loubles tournament of the P. C. C.!
.vill be granted the Blo<sk "S", Skull
and Snakes has gone on record as
favoring the adoption of tennis as a I
major sport and will embody the above
restrictions in its recommendation as
to the method of awarding letters.
In conclusion to those who may be
doubtful as to the advisability of such
a change, remember that a great many j
more of us felt the same in regard to
>asketball, which four years ago was
n exactly the same situation that ten
nis Is today. It needs no words of
mine to justify that step. It is only
lecessary to bring to mind Stanford's
1920 team.
With the assistance and help which
a favorablo vote will give the game,
there is no reason why a winning club
should not be turned out next year.

In conclusion to those who may be
doubtful as to the advisability of such
a change, remember that a great many j
more of us felt the same in regard to
>asketball, which four years ago was
n exactly the same situation that ten
nis Is today. It needs no words of
mine to justify that step. It is only
lecessary to bring to mind Stanford's
1920 team.
With the assistance and help which
a favorablo vote will give the game,
there is no reason why a winning club
should not be turned out next year.
For the past two years a feeling has
been growing on the campus that
something is fundamentally wrong
with the development of Stanford ten
nis teams. Two generations of stu
dents have come and gone since the
Cardinal has scored a win over the
Blue and Gold and whatever different
of opinion there may be as to the
causes, the outstanding fact is tha
something must be done, and done a
once.
It is true that Stanford has had he
individual stars. There is no brightei
light in the tennis world than Lii
Murray, '13, twice a national champion
More than a few of the championshi]
tournament cups of the Pacific Coasi
are engraved with the names of sue!
Stanford men as Herbert Hahn, '1G
and Van Dyke John, '18. However al
these men were finished players be
fore they ever came to Stanford, ex
perience in tournament play and need
ing only the added strength of year:
to bring them to the top of their game
And the fact stands out to our dis
credit that there has not been a singh
first class man developed in Stanfon
in the last twelve years. You wil
doubtless say that tennis is a gam<
which must be played from boyhoo
up—constantly played from the tim<
one is old enough to hold onto s
racket. That, it is true, has beei
more or less the history of many o
our Pacific Coast stars, but it is nol
universally so by any means, for the
University of California has consist
ently been turning out the finest kind
of tennis men who entered college a:
very mediocre material. Two recenl
examples of this are Ax Gravem, '17
who is slated to play with the
American Davis Cup team this year
and Ed Levy, '19, who is winning
matches from the best college teams
in the East at the present time.
Right here is the flaw in the Stan
ford system—a failure to develop oui
available material. And why can't wc
do the same as California has, evei
on a minor sport basis 112 The answei
is simply this: The men who pla}
receive absolutely no inducement oi
encouragement. The University fur
nishes them with very little flnancia
assistance. They must pay for al
their own equipment. They go out
for a Block "S"; out for some sport 1

receiving student body attention and
support. And neither you nor I can
blame them. But the sad part for
Stanford lies in this; that while they
may be capable of the highest develop
rnent as tennis players, capable of
winning from every college on the
•oast, as tratkmen, as ball-players, or
iasketball men, they are only medi
>cre, not better than a soore of others
trying out for the same position.
While Stanford has compelled its
ilayers to compete on a minor sport
iasis, practically every other school
>n the Pacific Coast rates tennis as
x major sport. This is true of the
University of California, University of
Washington, U. S. C., Occidental and
In the big eeastern univer
ities such as Harvard, Yale, Pirnce
on, Pennsylvania and Cornell tennis
ias been on a major sport basis for
nany years. It take 9 no large mental
ly then to find the reason who all the
'oung high school players are planning
o attend the University of California
ather than Stanford. This future
reneration cannot and must not be
snored.
The whole matter will come before
he voters of this University next
■Vednesday. Many have asked on what
asis letters would be awarded. It Is
he present plan that only those who
vin their matches in the dual meet
vith California, who win at the annual
