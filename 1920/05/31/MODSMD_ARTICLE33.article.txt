### 
SPRINGFIELD, 111., May 31—All
operation on a boy's skull, marking a
new departure in medical science, was
performed here by Dr. G. N. Kreider,
a local physician.
Tho boy, 5-year-old John W. Wilson,
was kicked by a horse and his skull
fractured. Two large pieces of bone
were driven into the lad's brain and a
considerable portion of the brain
substance lost.
Doctor Kreider removed the two
pieces of bone and "planted" them in
the flesh of the patient below the
lower rib on his left side. By doing
this the bones were kept alive for re
placement in their original position
after the wound in the boy's head
healed. Fifty days after the skull had
been fractured the bones were re
moved and replaced in the boys skull.
The wound has entirely healed and the
lad is hale and hearty. An injury,
such as he received causes death in
many cases.
