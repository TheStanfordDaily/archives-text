LONDON, May 31.—Annoyed at the
refusal of Captain Ramsay, King's
Commissioner at Balmoral, to pay the
men working on the royal estate £3
(about $12) a week, a London labor
newspaper prints a table showing how
much it costs the nation to keep the
royal family going. It reads thus:
King George refuses his workmen
on his Scottish estates a wage per
week of £3 (about $12.)
We pay King George £528.00 a year
or per week £10,154 (about $39,092.)
We pay yearly to:
Queen Alexandra £70,000
Prince of Wales 50.000
Duke of Connaught 25,000
Princess Christian 6.000
Duchess of Argyll 6,000
Princess Beatrice 6,000
King Edward's daughters 18.000
Total: £193,000 (about $743,000.)
