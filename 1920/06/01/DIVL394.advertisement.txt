far under regular worth. There are models of

And others in a wealth of Summertime colorings. About 25
models for porch, garden, street and vacation wear; many with
scalloped organdie collars, net and organdie vestees, dainty
flchu fronts, pleated over-skirts and colored ribbon sashes. Five
store buying demonstrates its power to save your money on the
seasonable frocks you need.
