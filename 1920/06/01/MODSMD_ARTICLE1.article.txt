# A.A.U. DECIDES TO HELP FINANCE RUGBY FIFTEEN
## Maloney Secures Assurance of Officials That Expenses Will be Paid From New York 
### 
An impetus was given the Stanford
to-Antwerp campaign managers of the
California Rugby Union, by tfie receipt
of a telegram from President Maloney
sent from New York after an interview
with officials of the Olympic Games Com
mittee of the A. A. U.
After listening to Maloney's arguments
in favor of sending an American rugby
team to the Olympics, the committee
agreed to finance the expedition from
New York to Antwerp and return, thus
taking a burden amounting to approxi
mately $20,000 from the shoulders of the
California Rugby Union. The quota to
be raised here is therefore reduced from
over $30,000 to about $10,000. Nearly
$4,000 of the required sum has already
been pledged, and three weeks remain in
which to secure the additional funds
necessary.
R. A. Martinsen, local campaign man
ager, has determined to raise the bal
ance necessary among prominent resi
dents of the Peninsula this week. A
list is being compiled, the prospects on
which are to be solicited by .members of
the overseas fifteen at present on the
campus.
