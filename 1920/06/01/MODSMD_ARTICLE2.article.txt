# NEW PLANS CALL FOR EXPANSION OF FIELD ARTILLERY
## 
### 
Expansion of the Field Artillery
Battery is provided for in the plans
recently drawn up by Captain L. P.
Collins, commandant of the local R.
O. T. C. unit. The military instructor
intends to add equipment to the train
ing camp which will place it on a par
with the artillery batteries maintained
by the eastern universities.
The War Department has recently
granted the request of Collins for ad
ditional mounts to equip the battery.
Twenty-six horses and four mules will
be sent to the "Farm" priod to the
opening of the autumn quarter. The
Captain hopes to have stables erected
during the summer for the new
mounts. An F. W. D annumition truck
is on the way from the East and its
arrival is expected daily. The truck
will complete the trio used for instruc
tion in the motor course.
