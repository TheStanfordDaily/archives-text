# POST ACCUSED OF RED SYMPATHY BY ATTORNEY GENERNL
## Palmer Tells House Committee That Assistant Secretary of Labor is a Revolutionist 
### United Press 
WASHINGTON, June I.—Attorney-
General Palmer, charged before the
House Rules Committee today, that
assistant-Secretary of of Labor, Post,
"by his wholesale jail deliveries and
the release of self-confessed anarchists
of the worst type, is seeking to block
the enforcement of deportation laws
and to bring into disrepute the law
officers of the government." This
statement was made in answer to
Post's testimony during hearings on
the resolution of Representative Hoch,
which would start impeachment pro
ceedings against Post. Palmer's state
ment today revealed the bitter strife
between the two departments over de
portation questions;.
He charged further that Post had
employed a "self-willed and autocratic
substitution of his own mistaken per
sonal viewpoint for the obligations of
the public law."
Replying to Post's statements that de
portation warrants had been cancelled
"only where facts warranted such ac
tion." Mr. Palmer cited a number of
individual cases which he claimed placed
the assistant secretary in a position of
"passive tolerance and encouragement
of Bolshevik propaganda."
Palmer further said that Post had
unconsciously been drawn into the "rev
olutionary plan" and had become a fac
tor in it.
Post's assertion that "with all of these
sweeping raids, only three pistols have
been found," was refuted by Palmer in
his statement that raids conducted in
twelve cities had discovered preparations
of the aliens to use both guns and
bombs.
Jackson H. Ralston, counsel for Post,
charged that the Department of Jus
tice had provocateur agents in service
who were engaged in forming new
Communist local organizations in order
to direct raids against them. This state
ment was characterized by Palmer as
a "deliberate and unwarranted false
hood."
