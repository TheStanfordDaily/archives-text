# MAKE TENNIS A MAJOR SPORT
## 
### 
THE vote of Quad tomorrow will decide the fate of tennis as a sport on the
"Farm." The announcement made by Skull and Snakes in favor of mak
ing tennis a major sport no doubt came as a considerable surpise to many stu
dents on the campus, yet to those who know the real situation, no other step"
could have been expected. If tennis isn't made a major sport by the student
body there is considerable grave doubt as to whether it will continue in
anything like the prominence which it has held in the past.
At the present time Stanford has two of the best men in the West, men
who are recognized tennis stars. Neer and Davies have showed up splendidly
this season by their consistent and spectacular playing. Neer was runner-up
in the Junior National Championship tournament ni the East last year and
has been an acknowledged star in the northwest for some time. Either one
of these men can go to any other institution on the coast and get a varsity
"S" in recognition of the time they putin on strenuous training. Tennis takes
just as much training, skill and technique as any other game, and in Cali
fornia the season is longer than for any other university sport. Bue even more
than this, such men as Neer and Davies, no doubt, feel some embarrassment
when they play men from other colleges who have the recognition of their
universities behind them, in that for them tennis is a major sport when Stan
ford gives the sport only a secondary place in her athletics.
Looking at the situation apart from the varsity "S" angle, there are sever
al interesting features to be noted in tennis. Tennis is practically the only
outdoor game which men can enter in college and continue after they leave
the University. Football, baseball, basketball, and track are practically never
entered again by men once they leave the University. The case is quite
different with tennis. In nine cases out of ten the tennis enthusiast keeps
up the game more ardently than ever after he gets out of college. If he goes
into a community which does not support tennis, the chances are that he will
foster and work for the sport. Tennis offers the chance for community ath
letics such as no other sport offered in the University does and in this the
students of the University should recognize in tennis a civic obligation. In
order to meet these, Stanford has to have the best men in the West. Stan
ford has the climate to play all the year around. She will soon have the
facilities for fine courts. Everything points in favor of tennis as a major
sport at Stanford, and it is to be hoped that the student body will be able
to see its way toward making tennis a major sport tomorrow.
