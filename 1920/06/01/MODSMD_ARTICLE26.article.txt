# THE QUAD DEDICATION
## 
### 
JT will be with considerable gratification that the students of the University
will read the dedication in this year's Quad. "Dutch" Roth has won the
confidence of the students of the University during his short residence on
the campus and every man and woman on the campus will heartily endorse
the dedication which reads:
"To Almon E. Roth, Stanford 1909, to whom, as Comptroller
of the University, students and alumni look with trust and
confidence."
At all times, Comptroller Roth has listened to student positions and
troubles with interest and enthusiasm. The success of Labor Day was large
ly on account of Roth's efforts. He has spared neither time nor effort toward
working for the smooth running of the University and his popularity is re
mf.rketable when one thinks of how far removed from student life his work
at the University really is. Mr. Roth typifies the spirit of good fellowship
and alumni interest which has marked Stanford spirit in the past and which
will foster Stanford spirit in the future.
The dedication expresses the whole excellence which marks the year
book to go on sale Monday. The Junior Class is to be congratulated upon
the book they have put out and particular credit is due the editor, business
manager, and staff of this year's Quad.
