# THE IMPORTANCE OF THE QUAD ELECTION
## 
### 
rrOMORROW the students of the University will hold the most important
Quad election of the year. The sophomores will attract attention, no
doubt, in electing the Quad manager and editor for the coming year. The
election of President of the Associated Students will be watched with equal
interest, as this is the most important office which the student body of Stan
ford offers. The new executive committee will be elected by representatives
from classes and a wise selection of members is imperative to the success
ful carrying on of next year's work. The class presidents will also be elected
tomorrow.
From the list of officers to be filled it can easily be seen that there is a
duty before every man and woman in the Universityâ€”to turn out and vote
in the election tomorrow. The vote is useless, however, unless it is cast in
telligently. Find out about the candidates for yourself and don't take just
anybody's word on the decision. Every one of these offices are essential to
the strength and growth of the internal organization at Stanford and unless
a wise selection of men and women is made, Stanford students will have
failed to meet their obligation as members of the University community.
