## 
### 
Although Gene Davis, *20, made over
50 points more than Mint Howell, '23,
in the mile-run yesterday afternoon,
in the final event of the intramural
pentathlon, he was unable to overcome
the lead that the freshman had estab
lished and individual honors went to
Howell, who scored 3216.24 points.
Davis scored 3112.32 and Scofield came
third with 1,993.28. Heath, Wright,
Thompson and Carlsmith finished in
the order named.
El Campo carried off honors in the
varsity division scoring 7524.32 points.
Breakers beat Zeta Psi out of second
place with 7343.36 to 7026.24. Next
came Delta Tau Delta and Theta Xi.
The most interesting feature of the
pentathlon is the race between Ander
son and Templeton for individual hon

ors in the non-varsity class.
Coach Acker refuses to announce
the winner until the score has been
rechecked as an error might have crept
into the point column. At present
Templeton has 3076.16 to Anderson's
3076.04. Roberts finished third with
2836.74 and Toland, Hayned and Kal
lam as named.
Breakers won the group prize in non
varsity, 23,455.12 to the 22,759.28 of
Theta Xi, who came second. Alpha
Sigma Phi was third with 17,411.38.
Elliott, a frosh miler made the best
time yesterday, when he negotiated
the distance in 4:39:1. This time for
the mile was four-fifths of a second
faster than that made by Carlsmith.
Radcliffe ran the fastest non-varsity
mile, his time being 4:51:2.
