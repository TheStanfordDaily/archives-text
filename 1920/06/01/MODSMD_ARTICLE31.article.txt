# NEW POLICIES ADDED TO ENDOWMENT FUND
## 
### 
With the addition of three new policies
last Saturday the class endowment drive
of 1920 today entered into its third week.
Members of the committee state that the
crises of the campaign will come during
the present week. By Saturday Stan
ford's attempted endowment will be
proven either a success or a failure.
New policies were issued Friday to
Herbert S. Wells, $275; Wade M. Stamo,
$275; and Thomas D. Radcliffe, $275.
The total to date is still under $4,000.
Policies will be sold at the bookstore
from 3 to 4 o'clock every afternoon.
