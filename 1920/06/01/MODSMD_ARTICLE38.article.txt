# DEBATERS WILL BE SENT AGAINST YALE NEXT WEEK
## Agreement Between Stanford and Eastern University to Provide for Two Contests 
### 
A contract for an Eastern-Western
debating series of two years duration
between Yale and Stanford Universities
has been arranged by Coach M. L. Mc-
Clintock, according to an announcement
made by him today.
The decision is a result of several
offers for debates made by eastern uni
versities, including the University of
Wisconsin, and Columbia and Yale Uni
versities. A letter from the manager
of debating at Yale was received by Mc-
Clintock a few days ago offering to
draw up an agreement for a scries of
forensif contests between the two uni
versities, extending over a minimum
period of two years. The offer has been
accepted and the agreement to be drawn
up wilf include provisions for one de
bate each year, one to be held in New
Haven and one at Stanford. At the ex
piration of the contract an extension
may be made if such arrangements are
satisfactory to both parties.
Coach McClintock considers this addi
tion to the present debating schedule one
of the most desirable in years. "This
is perhaps the most important debating
agreement drawn up on the coast for a
good many years, and is the first agree
ment covering a regular debate between
any western university and one of the
great universities of the Atlantic sea
board, and promises to bring about a
scries of debates of great interest and
importance," said the coach.
The Associated Students have author
ized the coach to continue with the ar
rangements, guaranteeing the appropri
ation of a sufficient sum of money to
cover the minimum expenses of the de
bate, the remainder of the expenses to
be raised by admission fees. Tht two
universities will share equally in the
expenses of the visiting team each year.
A three-year debating contract is be
ing carried out at present between Yale,
Harvard, and Princeton Universities.
With the intention of broadening its
scope, Yale has looked over the west
ern debating fields and has chosen Stan
ford from all other western colleges on
the grounds that the forensic standards
at Stanford were higher, and were more
comparable to Yale's reputation.
For several years Stanford debaters
have been looking forward to a sub
stantial forensic contract with some east
ern university. It is hoped that the new
agreement will stimulate even greater
interest in debating circles at Stanford.
