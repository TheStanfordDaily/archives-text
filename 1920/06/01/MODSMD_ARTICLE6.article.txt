# QUAD ELECTION WILL BE HELD TOMORROW; TENNIS MAJOR SPORT QUESTION UP
## 
### 
Whether or not tennis will be made
a major sport will be decided by the
Stanford students tomorrow, at the
election. Various honor societies and
local committees, such as Skull and
Snakes and the Executive Committee
have investigated the advantage which
might be derived by majoring this
athletic activity. With these investi
gations, which have caused these con
centrated groups of people to give
favorable reports, it seems to be more
than wise for the less informed stu
dents to turn out and help institute in
the University something which is be
lieved to be a great advantage.
Not only have different groups of
the campus' found it fitting to make
expressions in favor of tennis as a
major sport, but individuals who have
studied the situation have made state
ments. Allyn H. Barber, '18, in his
article in last night's Daily gave the
exact conditions at the present time
and the great possibilities which may
arise if the sport is majored. Barber
was captain of last year's tennis team
and at that time he realized the situa
tion he was bucking as long as the
sport remained among the minor activ
ities. His explanation and advice
should be greatly considered by those
who are less informed in the condi
tions.
Block "S" men have readily made
expressions in favor of making tennis
a major sport. Followinf is a state
ment by I. C. Heron, '18:
"I would like to see tennis made
a major sport in order to keep up
with our collegiate rivals and to
reward a deserving few for their
enthusiastic work.
"Tennis, by those who have
never seen or played a real match,
is considered rather effeminate. A
number of men imagine a block
"S" is to be gained by simply
batting a few balls around and
that the players are hardly to be
classed as athletes.
"After witnessing a few hard
fought matches I have come to the
conclusion that tennis requires as
much or more training, stamina
and skill for one to become really

proficient, as nearly any major
sport.
"The University of California
raised tennis from a minor to a
major sport some time ago. The
result is what? Men developing
or developed who are today almost
nationally known and are carrying
their University colors victorious
ly against many of tlfe strongest
eastern colleges. Those men re
ceived a block "C", yet they were
defeated by Stanford men who
had spent most of their time try
ing out for major sports with just
a few hasty practice games of
tennis at odd times.
"What brand of tennis would be
played at Stanford if the players
had the incentive of a block "S"?
"How much farther would Stan
ford sportmanship be known than
it is today?
"I feel sure that the great ma
jority of Stanford students will
never regret it if tennis is raised
to its rightful major sport basis.
I. C. HERON, '18."
Dr. Angell has also made an ope
statement of his ideas regardin
"majorizing tennis:"
"I have been asked to say a few
words in regard to the proposed
adoption of tennis as a major
sport and in a few words I can
say, I favor it. The game may not
be a major sport at Stanford, but
there is no doubt but that it is
a major sport in the State of Cali
fornia, and sooner or later Stan
ford will have to catch up with
the procession and 'majorize the
game.' Into a detailed discussion
of the advantages of tennis it is
more or less fruitless to enter
here, almost everyone has his
favorit sport and as taste and
temperament count in ones choice,
arguments of a verbal nature don't
go far in changing opinion. But
one point should be advanced and
that is this: Every student for
his future good should practice
some form of sport in college
which will serve him in way of
