# SOCIETY SCORES WRITER; CHARGES HOTLY DENIED

### 
Skull and Snakes Society submitted
to The Daily Palo Alto today the fol
lowing resolution which was passed at
their last meeting:
The minutes of the meeting:
"It has been called to the attention
of this Society that a number of articles
of supposedly appreciable literary value
have been edited in the campus publica
tions, which are deserving of and require
our criticism. These articles have been
of a destructive nature rather than con
structive, and are therefore undesirable.
They have been entirely uncalled for,
unnecessary in their inception, and do
not evidence the kind of literature which
the members of this institution should
produce.
"We believe that two of these articles,
although confined to the Campus in cir
culation, have been unfair to those at
whom they were directed, and are there
fore undesirable. The other two were
of such a character as to attract the at
tention of the Yellow Journalism of out
side periodicals, and have resulted in
unfavorable advertising. Therefore they
are not proper for Campus publications.
" It is, therefore, Resolved, That this
organization stands on record as severely
criticising (1) M. A. Osenbaugh and F.
S. Reeder because of their article de
scribing the baseball game with Califor
nia. (2) R. W. Kenny, because of his
article, "Letting Cheaters Prosper," and
also because of the uncalled-for criticism
of the late Junior Opera.
It is further stated that this society
will consider as grounds for more defi
nite action the future publication of arti
cles falling in a class with any of the
above.
"Be it further resolved, That it is the
opinion of the Society that constructive
editorials, such as the one appearing in
the last issue of the Chaparral, will lead
to a higher plane for campus publica
tions.
"Skull and Snakes Society."

The following communication has
been submitted by R. W. Kenny, '21,
in reply to the resolution from' Skull
and Snakes:
Gentlemen:
Some one read your pompous and in
spiring pronunciamento today and said
to me, "Why, they haven't any business
to tell you how to write up a show;
they're only a bunch of athletes. How
can they tell you how to express your
own opinions?"
You can well imagine that I was deep
ly shocked and I hastily pointed out to
this person that you were a University
honor society (even if most of your
members had earned their way in
through athletic ability alone), and that
as such you wanted to discourage any
"yellow journalism" that would hurt
Stanford. I told him that, of course,
any dramatic criticism of a local sh'ow
that was not couched in the most glow
ing terms was "yellow journalism" on
its face. I showed him how my write
up, though intended to be extremely fa
vorable, wa,s still not full enough of
juicy adjectives, and as a result, had
practically wrecked the morale of the
University.
He agreed to all this, but then he said
that he thought you were after the wrong
party when you attached the blame for
the sensationalism that followed the pub
lication of "Letting Cheaters Prosper"
to the writer of the article instead of the
city papers that gave semi-garbled ver
sions of it.
Again I demonstrated that he was
wrong. I showed him that probably most
of your distinguished commentators on
journalistic ethics had never read the
article in question. That fact is evident,
considering that your august body, which
is so busy forming resolutions, had
never formed one backing up the estab
lishment of the "honor" system that the
article advocated.
But reading an article is not a vital
necessity when you are merely publicly
attacking the writer on account of it. Of
course, if you all had read "Letting
Cheaters Prosper" carefully you might
have seen what I was driving at. But.
after all, your calling me a "yellow jour
nalist" for what appeared in the city
papers and not in my own article was
done in the friendliest and kindliest of
spirits, etc., etc.
What if it isn't in your province to
publicly discuss drarrlatic judgments and
publicly misplace the blame for some
thing that you never investigated? What
if you haven't the authority to threaten
"more definite action later" ? What if
you were two months late in opening
fire with this very questionable ammu
nition? And lastly, what if you do write
childish and unfounded resolutions?
These things are of small matter.
What you have done is to crush a "yel
low journalist" who was under the delu
sion that he should write something ap
proximating his opinions under his own
name, and who falsely believed that the
city papers were responsible for what
appeared in them, not himself. I am,
Repentently,
(Signed) R. W. Kenny..
