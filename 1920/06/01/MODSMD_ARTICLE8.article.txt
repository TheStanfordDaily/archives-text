# CAMPUS ORGANIZATIONS PLAN FINANCIAL COMBINE
## 
### 
Consolidation of the business man
agement of all campus dramatic produc
tions in one committee will be proposed
to the Student Executive Committee at
its meeting tonight. The proposal will
be made by representatives of Sword
and Sandals.
The proposal includes the formation I
of a committee consisting of one mem- .
her from each of the campus dramatic
organizations, a representative of the
Senior. Junior, and Sophomore classes,
the University dramatic coach, and a
manager appointed by the other eight
members of the committee.
The manager would receive a spcci
fied salary and his tenure of office would
lie at the pleasure of the committee. His I
salar/ would be paid out of a sinking]
fund to he maintained through a 15 per |
cent tax on the proceeds of the various i
productions.
Ftom this fund also would be paid the |
expense of maintaining and improving i
the equipment of the stage in the Asscm- I
My Hall. The equipment which is now'
on hand consists of a considerable quan- '
titv of valuable material and is the prop- i

erty of Swofrd and Sandals. This or
ganization proposes to deed this equip
ment to the students of the University
to be disposed of as the committee
sees fit.
Members of Sword and Sandals point
out that by such a consolidation as this,
the business end of campus productions
would be better taken care of than un
der the present system of each organiza
tion or class appointing its own manage
ment."
This committee, of course, wotdd have
nothing to do with the selection of plays
or characters but would confine its ef
forts to the business management of the
successive plays. The manager would
be in an excellent position through ex
perience and familitarity with the work
to carry on the management of the large
number of plays throughout the year.
Coach Gordan Davis, who was re
cently appointed by the Hoard of Trus
tees as permanent dramatic coach for
the University, is one of the proposers
of the plan. Several of the campus
dramatic organizations have agreed to
advocate it.
