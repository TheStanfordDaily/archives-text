# MEMORIAL DRIVE TO BE STARTED IN HOUSES TONIGHT
## Students Who Have Not Made Subscription to be Given Opportunity This Evening 
### 
That Stanford shall have for all time
some concrete object which will call to
the minds of future students the won
derful part played by Stanford men and
women in the World War, is the motive
of the War Memorial Committee, which
is giving an opportunity tonight for the
men and women who did not subscribe
to the War Memorial last year to do so
now. The plan of the committee is to
make all subscriptions taken now pay
able not later than June, 1923, when it
is hoped that actual construction may
start. This gives an opportunity for
subscribing to those who do not feel
that they could if they were called upon
to make payment immediately, but wish
to pledge themselves as supporting the
plan.
Stanford is not alone in honoring rep
resentatives in the great war, for memo
rials Sf one description or another have
been planned by the great majority of
the large universities throughout the
country. However, the memorial has a
distinct claim on Stanford people, for
this is the tirst time that Stanford stu
dents have ever been called upon <o
support financially anything permanently
connected with their alma mater, though
demands for such support are the usual
thing at other endowed universities. For
this reason, and the fact that the causc
to which the money will be devoted is an
especially worthy one, it is expected that
all who have not already subscribed will
do so tonight.
The subscriptions will be taken on the
basis of living groups, and the amounts
pledged will be published in the Daily
Palo Alto.
