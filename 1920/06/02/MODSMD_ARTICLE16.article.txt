### 
WASHINGTON, June 2.—A group
of women, carrying banners demand
ing freedom for Ireland and that the
United States recall her loans to Eng
land, burned a British flag before the
treasury department today... They dis
appeared before the police arrived.
Women sympathizers of Irish free
day yesterday threw the Senate and
the House into an uproar with their
shouted challenges from the galleries
to members, to deny their appeal for
Irish independence. After being
ejected from Senate chambers, one
young woman slipped through the
cloak room door of the House into the
main aisle and screamed "Cowards!"
This was a signal for other women in
the galleries to shout down questions
concerning the Irish situation. After
a wild race with the guards among the
benches the women were ejected.
