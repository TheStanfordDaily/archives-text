### United Press 
CHICAGO, June 2.â€”By unanimous
vote today, the Republican national com
mittee seated the regular twelve dele
gates from Louisiana. This apparently
was a victory for Governor Lowden, as
it is understood that the regular dele
gates were pro-Lowden while the con
testing delegates were understood to be
supporting General Wood.
