# Seib and Melba Berry Will Lead In Light Comedy
## 
### 
Although the cast for"The Con
stant Lover," the opening play on the
Masquers' program Thursday evening,
includes only two numbers, the lines and
comedy situations of the play, as well as
the quality of the cast, more than make
up for the lack of numbers. In the role
of the constant lover, Lester Scib, '22,
well-known on the campus for his dra
matic ability, promises to keep the audi
ence in laughter for the fully thirty min
utes. Melba Berry '22 will play opposite
Seib.
While the plot is very slight, and the
action practically negligible, the spark
ling humor of the lines is such as is
seldom equaled in a tabloid of this kind.
What plot the play contains is woven
about a man who, though constantly in
love, is never in love with the same
girl for any length of time, giving rise to
a number of complications, which are
said to be clever in the extreme. The
author of the play, St. John Irvine, is
one of the best-known of the recent
English comedy writers.
In addition to "The Constant Lover,"
"Punchinello, the Pedlar," a phantasv
in one act, and "Ryland." a more serious
one-act drama, will be produced at the
same time. The program has been
worked up by those in charge with a
view to pleasing all tastes, including the
ludicrous os well as the serious.
The committee announces that despite
the limitation on the number of tickets
sold, tlier eare still a few available. No
scats are reserved, and those who ar
rive tirst will get the best choice of seats.
The ticket sale was continued today at a
table in front of the Women's Clubhouse.
