ponement of the voting imperative, and

days before election, the balloting was
set for Friday. The constitution also
states that nominations shall close two
days before the elections, and according

that no more nominations shall be made,
but that the candidates shall be placed on
the ballots according to the way in which
they were named before nominations
were closed yesterday.
