Ten students were put on strict pro

lation of the University ruling against
driving machines with open mufflers.
The privilege of driving their cars on
campus streets for the remainder of the
quarter will be taken from these ten
students for further violation of the reg
ulation.
Taxicab people in Palo Alto have also
been warned against violation of cam
pus and state traffic regulations, and any
further infringement will be deemed suf
ficient cause for denying them the priv
ilege of using campus streets. The
Comptroller also called attention to the
fact that the chains barring certain road
ways were to be removed at 4:30 each
day, but warned them not to regard this
as an invitation to speed on these roads.
