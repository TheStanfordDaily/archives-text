Club's successful presentation of "The
Professor's Love Story." at the Palo
Alto Union High School auditorium
Inst night. The play is one of Sir
James iÂ»l. Barrie's earlier comedies, but
one of the cleverest and most delightful
of all his dramas. The difficult part of
the professor who begins as an "old"
I man and grows younger through the
succeeding episodes, was played with an
unusual understanding of the whimsical,
humorous spirit of Rarrie. by N'orris
James, president of the Senior Class and
major of the cadet company.
Eric Jordan, son of Chancellor Jor
dan, played the Scotch countryman Pete,
whose main wor kwas keeping out of
"such a reesky thing" as marriage. Car
oline Peirce, the daughter of Prof. G.
J. Peirce. of the Botany Department,
played the maid, Effie, who finally en
snared but could not hold Pete. The
eccentric Englishman who did "hard"
work in the fields that he might undcr
who cut up bis wife's hat to demonstrate
stand how his constituents lived, and
bis theory of prices and really proved
it, was played effectively hv Alexander
. Rriggs, son of Professor W. D. Briggs,
of the English Department.
