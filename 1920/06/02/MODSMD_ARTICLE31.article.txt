# IN REGARD TO SKULL AND SNAKES
## 
### 
IT was with considerable interest that many of us on the campus received
the word of the constructive step which Skull and Snakes took upon
themselves as an organization when they formulated the resolution which
appeared in the columns of this paper last night. It will be noted that in
the opening paragraph of the minutes of the meeting that emphasis was
placed upon the two words "constructive" and "destructive," words which
serve many purposes in this day and age and yet which often mean nothing
unless backed up by action which proves the value of the idea. The accusa
tion of yellow journalism has been thrown at both THE DAILY PALO ALTO
and the ILLUSTRATED REVIEW with the emphasis 'that the real harm
comes in the stories which appear in the San Francisco newspapers.
In the first place it must be understood that neither the ILLUSTRATED
REVIEW nor THE DAILY PALO ALTO have anything to do with what goes
from this campus to the city papers. Each paper has its own correspondent
whose business it is to lover the news of the campus and send to his par
ticular city paper.
The Lack of Co-operation from Skull and Snakes
Having explained the total absence of connection between the city papers
and the publications in question, it will be interesting to go into some phases
of the cause for "yellow journalism." THE DAILY PALO ALTO in no way
excuses the write-up of the California baseball game, but it does feel that as
long as Skull and Snakes feels the need for constructive action on the cam
pus, that the first step might well be taken within their own ranks. Skull
and Snakes for the most part is made up of varsity "S" men. It is primarily
an athletic organization. It will be interesting to note, therefore, that there
has been more consistent crabbing about the athletic writeups in THE DAILY
PALO ALTO than in any one branch which the DAILY covers. The con
tinued criticism has always been kept on the outside and absolutely no at
tempt has been made on the part of Skull and Snakes to come to the Daily
and express the criticism with some suggestion of what should be done in
the future. Acknowledgements are due "Jess" Wells for the co-operation
which he has shown at all times with the DAILY but with this exception the
athletes of the University have studiously steered clear of THE DAILY PALO
ALTO office. Their criticism has always been destructive. They have made
no attempt to offer anything upon which we could build for the future'.' THE
DAILY is perfectly willing to take its share of criticism but we do expect that
those who see something wrong about the paper come to us and tell us about
it so that we can have some chance to correct the mistake. If the DAILY
has been off on the wrong foot in its athletic policy, Skull and Snakes has sat
back and let us continue along the wrong lines.
Right to Personal Opinion in Dramatic Criticism
In regard to the Junior Opera criticism, it might be stated for the bene
fit of those unacquainted with journalistic ethics that when a man signs his
name to an article he assumes are responsibility for what he says. It might
also be pointed out that a dramatic criticism is a reflection of personal opinion
and personal reaction. As a matter of fact there are twenty-one superlative
phrases in the article which Skull and Snakes refers to and any analysis of
the article will reveal the fact that on the whole it was not only a pretty fair
and just criticism but it was also strong in its praise of the Junior produc
tion. The reaction of Skull and Snakes to the Junior Opera no doubt was a
little different from R. W. Kenny's reaction still does not throw out
Kenny's work as being of destructive influence nor does it fill our definition
of yellow journalism.
The last point reviewed by Skull and Snakes is in reference to "Letting
Cheaters Prosper," which has been answered by Kenny himself. Let it suf
fice to say that it will be interesting to note whether or not Skull and Snakes
will feel bound in their new constructive platform to advacote some estab
lishment of an honor system at Stanford whereby every Tom, Dick and Harry
on the campus can't get away with cheating, which is so prevalent on the
campus at the present time.
Build on the Futureâ€”Treats Are For Children
In conclusion, THE DAILY PALO ALTO would like to suggest that the
best way for constructive action is first to find out the exact cause which
lies behind the effect objected to. Building for the future does not necessarily
entail a rehashing of the past. Bringing up old issues generally brings up
hard feeling which have long died down. Draw lessons from the past but
look ahead rather than attacking that which is long ago buried. THE DAILY
PALO ALTO at all times stands for the constructive line of action and it
heartily endorses the attitude which Skull and Snakes has taken, but it
doesn't approve the method of reform. Charity begins at home and people
in glass houses should not throw stones. If Skull and Snakes doesn't want
yellow journalism they have to show more co-operation than they have in
the past. As a last word, Skull and Snakes should realize that threats are
for children. No intelligent man or woman is afraid of a threat and Skull and
Snakes must realize that they are dealing with men and women who are just
as interested in the welfare of Stanford as they are.
