# MONEY AND STANFORD LOYALTY
## 
### 
JUST A YEAR AGO the students of the University pledged themselves to
" support a memorial which would be fitting as a tribute to the memory
of those Stanford men who lost their lives in the Great War. At that time
it was agreed that each entering class should pledge six dollars per member
toward the fund so that the student quota would be reached in the fund. To

day those students who have not pledge money to the Memorial Fund are
asked to do their share in commemorating Stanford's dead. The obligation
is a tremendous one and something which no one can shirk and feel that
he has a clear conscience. The memory of those men who so splendidly gave
their lives that we might live is one of the most precious possessions which
Stanford has today. The names of those men will always serve as an inspi
ration for the finer side of University life.
1 he call has come for students of the University to show their appre
(iation of the sacrifice made by all Stanford men who went into service. Six
dollars is a pitifully small way to express our appreciation, yet in the ag
gregate it will make possible a very beautiful memorial expressing the spirit
of service which is the keynote to the modern age. Altruism must always
play an important part in Stanford life and Stanford students will not fail to
meet this most important call.
