Two campus editors have submitted
the following communications concern
ing the Skull and Sakes resolution:
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
In the Daily Palo Alto of June Ist,
appeared a resolution adopted by Skull
and Snakes Honor Society, criticising
several campus journalists, which in
the opinion of the editorial staff of the
Stanford Illustrated Review was en
tirely uncalled for. The particular at
tack, on R. W. Kenny, '21, author of
"Letting Cheaters Prosper," which ap
peared in the Review a short while
ago, struck at the heart of a free ex
pression of opinion, or an attempt at
reform.
"Letting Cheaters Prosper" was aim
ed at an intolerable situation in the
class room, and Skull and Snakes
would have been much more within
the proper field of an honor society
had it adopted resolutions condemning
cheating and supporting the establish
ment of an honor system in examina
tions, rather than attacking campus
publications which are endeavoring to
attain constructive ends on the cam
pus.
The pompous threat of Skull and
Snakes that "this society will con
sider as grounds for more definite ac
tion the future publication of articles
falling in a class with any of the
above" is almost laughable. What
does Skull and Snakes propose to do
in case one of the campus publications
decides to expose some situation which
needs reform, and proposes methods
to accomplish such ends? The mem
bers might rise in their athletic wrath,
and inflict physical punishment on the
writers, but such action would cer

tainly not help the situation.
Might a journalist suggest that when
a campus society goes so far as to
make a public attack on a member of
the student body, it would be well to
have a decent basis for such an attack?
(Signed) H. G. SWENDSEN,
Editor Illustrated Review.
To the Editor, D. P. A.:
The question raised by the proclama
tion sent forth by Skull and Snakes
Society, yesterday, is of sufficient im
portance to be worth the considera
tion of every student. The charge
made public seems to have been that
certain designated journalists had of
fended Skull and Snakes by writing
articles which underrated the Baseball
Team, slighted the Junior Opera, and
acquired undesirable publicity by way
of being misinterpreted by San Fran
cisco papers. The question involved
is not the rather doubtful justice of
the accusation, nor is it the equally
doubtful taste of a published attack
on three individual journalists by a
respected and long-established honor
society, nor, finally, is it the undigni
fied spectacle of the powerful society
threatening belligerently to take some
mysterious "definite action" if the
three lone journalists further offend
Skull and Snakes.
What IS questioned is the freedom
of the campus publications. If Skull
and Snakes is to be a self-constituted
board of censorship, why not Cap and
Gown also? If one element in the
community may decide what, and why,
and how, things are written, in a spirit
however unselfish and public-spirited,
why may not all the others also climb

To the Editor, D. P. A.:
The question raised by the proclama
tion sent forth by Skull and Snakes
Society, yesterday, is of sufficient im
portance to be worth the considera
tion of every student. The charge
made public seems to have been that
certain designated journalists had of
fended Skull and Snakes by writing
articles which underrated the Baseball
Team, slighted the Junior Opera, and
acquired undesirable publicity by way
of being misinterpreted by San Fran
cisco papers. The question involved
is not the rather doubtful justice of
the accusation, nor is it the equally
doubtful taste of a published attack
on three individual journalists by a
respected and long-established honor
society, nor, finally, is it the undigni
fied spectacle of the powerful society
threatening belligerently to take some
mysterious "definite action" if the
three lone journalists further offend
Skull and Snakes.
What IS questioned is the freedom
of the campus publications. If Skull
and Snakes is to be a self-constituted
board of censorship, why not Cap and
Gown also? If one element in the
community may decide what, and why,
and how, things are written, in a spirit
however unselfish and public-spirited,
why may not all the others also climb

Two campus editors have submitted
the following communications concern
ing the Skull and Sakes resolution:
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
In the Daily Palo Alto of June Ist,
appeared a resolution adopted by Skull
and Snakes Honor Society, criticising
several campus journalists, which in
the opinion of the editorial staff of the
Stanford Illustrated Review was en
tirely uncalled for. The particular at
tack, on R. W. Kenny, '21, author of
"Letting Cheaters Prosper," which ap
peared in the Review a short while
ago, struck at the heart of a free ex
pression of opinion, or an attempt at
reform.
"Letting Cheaters Prosper" was aim
ed at an intolerable situation in the
class room, and Skull and Snakes
would have been much more within
the proper field of an honor society
had it adopted resolutions condemning
cheating and supporting the establish
ment of an honor system in examina
tions, rather than attacking campus
publications which are endeavoring to
attain constructive ends on the cam
pus.
The pompous threat of Skull and
Snakes that "this society will con
sider as grounds for more definite ac
tion the future publication of articles
falling in a class with any of the
above" is almost laughable. What
does Skull and Snakes propose to do
in case one of the campus publications
decides to expose some situation which
needs reform, and proposes methods
to accomplish such ends? The mem
bers might rise in their athletic wrath,
and inflict physical punishment on the
writers, but such action would cer

tainly not help the situation.
Might a journalist suggest that when
a campus society goes so far as to
make a public attack on a member of
the student body, it would be well to
have a decent basis for such an attack?
