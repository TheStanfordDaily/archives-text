# WEDEKIND'S RESIGNATION
## 
### 
IT is with considerable regret that THE DAILY PALO ALTO announces the
resignation of R. E. Wedekind, *19, as managing editor. At all times, Wede
kind has worked with the best interest of the paper in mind and it is largely
tin ugh his efforts that tho paper has attained the professional tone which
it has at the present time. For some time, Wedekind felt the pressure
of college work which he has neglected on account of his work on THE
DAILY PALO ALTO and the resignation comes after considerable contem
plation and thought. The editor of THE DAILY PALO ALTO takes this op
portunity to publicly thank Mr. Wedekind for the time and effort which he
has devoted to the paper and for his dauntless support when the paper was
working against overwhelming difficulties in striving for a realization of the
six-column size of the paper.

Miss Ei.j.en Calhoun,
F.ditor. The Daily Palo Alto,
Stanford University, Cal.
Dear Miss Calhoun:
I wish to tender mv resignation as
Managing F.ditor of The Daily Palo
Alto, to take effect at once. During the
past quarter I have devoted much time
to 1 he Daily work, and as a consequence
1 have neglected my college work a
corresponding amount. I feel that al
though there are hut a few more issues
of I he Daily to he printed this quarter,
that the time 1 would gain as far as my
studies are concerned would he consid
erable while if I remained with The
Daily I would he doing nothing hut rou
tine work, the paper having heen ad
vanced this quarter as much as possible.

I refuse longer, also, to be placed in
a position where I have to deal with a
staff, a large majority of which is seek
ing simply a college honor. I must say
that I cannot help but feel that what
progressive steps The Daily has taken
during your term of office have been in
spite of a decided lack of co operation
from the members of the staff referred
to above. These members seem to have
felt it a political duty on their part to
handicap The Daily work as much as
possible. I feel that politics should be
eliminated from The Daily, but it re
mains that their elimination has not been
effected. This feeling of political alle
giance has resulted in the lack of co
operation.
Very respectfully yours,
R. E. WF.DFKIND.
