# FAMOUS BRITISH DERBY DRAW SRARE FANS TODAY
## 
### United Press 
LONDON', June 2.—The British
sporting world—and, indeed, hundreds
of thousands, if not millions, of British
ers who do not ordinarily take much in
terest in sport—is keyed up to the high
est pitch over the race for the Derby,
the "Blue Riband of the Turf," which
will be run over the Epsom track today.
No turf event in the world attracts
so much interest as the race which was
inaugurated 140 years ago as the result
of a dispute over the merits of their re
spective horses between a small party of
English aristocrats. The Derby is an in
stitution.
Millions of dollars change hands an
nually over the race, for apart from the
actual betting on the race track and pool
rooms, every club and social community
has its "sweepstake" or pool on the race,
in which stakes may vary from the hum
ble sixpence to a pound or more, and
the prizes from a few shillings to thou
sands of pounds.
The Derby was ever a race of sur
prises, sensations and tragedies. Since
Sir Charles Banbury's equine wonder Di
omed won the first Derby in 1780 it lias
been voted a poor year indeed that has
not provided a sensation or new record
of some sort.
Sir Charles Banbury won two more
Derby's after Diomed's race, a triple
crown shared by a select band of sports
men which includes the late King Ed
ward. Only two men have won the race
four times, Sir J. llawley scoring in
1851, 1858. 1859 and 1868, and the kite
Duke of Westminster in 1880, 1882, 1886,
and .1899. *
Once, in 1884, there was a dead heat,
the judge being unable to separate J.
Hammond's St. Gatien and Sir J. Wil
loughby's Harvester.
Perhaps the most dramatic and tragic
Derby on record was that of 1867, won
by Henry Chaplin's Hermit. That year
is still spoken of as the "Snowstorm
Derby" as snow fell during the racing.
Chaplin was engaged to a beautiful so
ciety girl, daughter of a peer, who how
ever bccame enamored of the notorious
Marquis of Hastings. Some months be
fore the race she eloped with the mar
quis, leaving Chaplin waiting at the door

ot a costumier's store to which he had
taken her. •
Chaplin swore revenge and he found,
that he could accomplish part, at least,
of his aims by winning the Derby with
Hermit. The Marquis plunged heavily
against Chaplin's entry so the discarded
lover vowed that Hermit should win.
Nursing the animal as the apple of his
eye, Chaplin and his trainer got it to the
starting post lit and well, although so
little were its chances thought of by the
bookmakers that it started at odds of
1,000 to 15 (roughly 66 to 1). Hermit
won, and the Marquis of Hastings com
mitted suicide, his runawav bride dying
in broken-hearted misery shortly after
wards. Chaplin, now Viscount Chaplin,
is still alive,- a popular and highly
esteemed sportsman and landowner, but
he never won another Derby.
Three times has the Derby prize gone
to America, the late P. Lorrilard draw
ing first blood in 1881 with the mighty
Iriquois; the late W. C .Whitney follow
ing in 1901 with Volydovski, and "Boss"
Richard Croker in 1907 with Orby. Cro
ker has stated that he was practically
"broke" until Orby scooped a huge pot
for him. In 1914 America and France
shared the spoils for the Franco-Ameri
can-bred French-trained Durbar 11.
This year there are no
eign entries, and the field is likely to be
limited to home-bred performers. KinP r
George has yet to win a Derby, but he
does not look like achieving the goal
this year as none of his entries has dis
played outstanding merit.
This year's favorite is Tetratema, a
grey son of the most famous grey for
many years. The Tetrarch. It belongs to
the popular millionaire soldier-sports
man Major Dermot McCalmont, nephew
and heir to the late Colonel Harry Mc-
Calmont. Others fancied are W. Ra
phael's Allenby, who finished second in
the Guineas, and Sir M. Cunliffe-Owen's
Orpheus and Anthony de Rothschild's
Daulight patrol.
The record time for the race is 2 min
utes 35 seconds, by Lemberg in 1910.
Lady Tames Douglas, who has some
moderate entries this year, was the first
[woman to win the Derby, scoring with
Gainsborough in 1918.

lover vowed that Hermit should win.
Nursing the animal as the apple of his
eye, Chaplin and his trainer got it to the
starting post lit and well, although so
little were its chances thought of by the
bookmakers that it started at odds of
1,000 to 15 (roughly 66 to 1). Hermit
won, and the Marquis of Hastings com
mitted suicide, his runawav bride dying
in broken-hearted misery shortly after
wards. Chaplin, now Viscount Chaplin,
is still alive,- a popular and highly
esteemed sportsman and landowner, but
he never won another Derby.
Three times has the Derby prize gone
to America, the late P. Lorrilard draw
ing first blood in 1881 with the mighty
Iriquois; the late W. C .Whitney follow
ing in 1901 with Volydovski, and "Boss"
Richard Croker in 1907 with Orby. Cro
ker has stated that he was practically
"broke" until Orby scooped a huge pot
for him. In 1914 America and France
shared the spoils for the Franco-Ameri
can-bred French-trained Durbar 11.
This year there are no
eign entries, and the field is likely to be
limited to home-bred performers. KinP r
George has yet to win a Derby, but he
does not look like achieving the goal
this year as none of his entries has dis
played outstanding merit.
This year's favorite is Tetratema, a
grey son of the most famous grey for
many years. The Tetrarch. It belongs to
the popular millionaire soldier-sports
man Major Dermot McCalmont, nephew
and heir to the late Colonel Harry Mc-
Calmont. Others fancied are W. Ra
phael's Allenby, who finished second in
the Guineas, and Sir M. Cunliffe-Owen's
Orpheus and Anthony de Rothschild's
Daulight patrol.
The record time for the race is 2 min
utes 35 seconds, by Lemberg in 1910.
Lady Tames Douglas, who has some
moderate entries this year, was the first
[woman to win the Derby, scoring with
Gainsborough in 1918.
LONDON', June 2.—The British
sporting world—and, indeed, hundreds
of thousands, if not millions, of British
ers who do not ordinarily take much in
terest in sport—is keyed up to the high
est pitch over the race for the Derby,
the "Blue Riband of the Turf," which
will be run over the Epsom track today.
No turf event in the world attracts
so much interest as the race which was
inaugurated 140 years ago as the result
of a dispute over the merits of their re
spective horses between a small party of
English aristocrats. The Derby is an in
stitution.
Millions of dollars change hands an
nually over the race, for apart from the
actual betting on the race track and pool
rooms, every club and social community
has its "sweepstake" or pool on the race,
in which stakes may vary from the hum
ble sixpence to a pound or more, and
the prizes from a few shillings to thou
sands of pounds.
The Derby was ever a race of sur
prises, sensations and tragedies. Since
Sir Charles Banbury's equine wonder Di
omed won the first Derby in 1780 it lias
been voted a poor year indeed that has
not provided a sensation or new record
of some sort.
Sir Charles Banbury won two more
Derby's after Diomed's race, a triple
crown shared by a select band of sports
men which includes the late King Ed
ward. Only two men have won the race
four times, Sir J. llawley scoring in
1851, 1858. 1859 and 1868, and the kite
Duke of Westminster in 1880, 1882, 1886,
and .1899. *
Once, in 1884, there was a dead heat,
the judge being unable to separate J.
Hammond's St. Gatien and Sir J. Wil
loughby's Harvester.
Perhaps the most dramatic and tragic
Derby on record was that of 1867, won
by Henry Chaplin's Hermit. That year
is still spoken of as the "Snowstorm
Derby" as snow fell during the racing.
Chaplin was engaged to a beautiful so
ciety girl, daughter of a peer, who how
ever bccame enamored of the notorious
Marquis of Hastings. Some months be
fore the race she eloped with the mar
quis, leaving Chaplin waiting at the door

ot a costumier's store to which he had
taken her. •
Chaplin swore revenge and he found,
that he could accomplish part, at least,
of his aims by winning the Derby with
Hermit. The Marquis plunged heavily
against Chaplin's entry so the discarded
lover vowed that Hermit should win.
Nursing the animal as the apple of his
