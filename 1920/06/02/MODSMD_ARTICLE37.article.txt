A scholarship of $125 a year to be
given to an engineering major is pro
vided in the plans approved at the
last meeting of the society. $2500 will
be raised by the engineering organiza
tion to provide a permanent endow
ment fund to provide income for the
scholarship. Stanford alumni, grad
uates of the C. E. Department, will
be asked to aid the undergraduate
members of the society in rasing the
fund. In awarding the scholarship the
need of the applicants and their per
sonal qualifications will be considered.
Only upperclassmen will be eligible

American Society of Civil Engineers.
Until this year the famous engineer
ing society has refused charters to
any university undergraduate organi
