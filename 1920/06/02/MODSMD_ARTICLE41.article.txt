# CRACK YACHTS TUNE UP FOR CUP RACES NEXT JULY
## Shamrock IV, Lipton's Boat Is Here to Challange America's Best

NEW YORK. June 2â€”"Give us
ninety days and we'll nulla a sloop
that'll beat 'er."
It was back in 1851 that British
yachtsmen served this warning on old
Captain Dick Brown, who had just
sailed the America to a victory over
the Aurora and thirteen other British
crafts.
That was sixty-nine years ago and
ever since then British yachtsmen have
been trying to win back America's Cup
which was won by old Skipper Brown.
When a generation had failed, Sir
Thomas Lipton, the tea-king of Ire
land, took up the task. He has tried
four times to win the cup and spent
close to $3,000,000 upon a family of
Shamrocks that has always been too
slow for American sloops.
Shemrock IV, which was caught in
mid-ocean by the declaration of war in
1914 and which narrowly escaped de
struction by a shipyard fire this spring
after six years' "storage," will make
the "supreme effort this summer to win
back the cup.
Against either the Resolute or the
Vanitie, two American candidates for
the honor of defender, Shamrock IV
will sail a series of three races off
Sandy Hook starting July 15.
In the presence of her designer,
Charles Nicholson, British marine
expert, Shamrock IV was taken out of
her "cradle" and launched recently.
Her masts and sails, recently arrived
from England, will be installed and
she will go through her trial races with
Shamrock 111, a twenty-three foot
sloop, now on her way across the
Atlantic under her own sail.
The Vanitie, designed by Williams
Gardner and sailed by W. Starling
Burgess, will fight it out with the
Resolute, designed by Capt. Not Her
reshoff and sailed by Robert W. Em
mons 2d, for the honor of defending
the cup in a series of races starting
early in June.
Both yachts went through trial
races in 1914 but the declaration of
war caused a postponement of the race
and no choice was named. Resolute,
however, did the better work as she
was allowed 3y 2 minutes over a 30-
mile course by the Vanitie. Some
changes have been made, however, and
it is possible that Resolute may have
to allow Vanitie time. Some expert
yachtsmen connected with the New
York Yacht Club are making Vanitie
the favorite as the defender.
Captain W. P. Burton, who arrived
here recently from England with a
crew of fifteen to take charge of the
challenger said that Sir Thomas Lip
ton probably would not come over un
til early in July. Burton and his crew
have sailed together on the yacht
Octavia and have won thirty-one out
of forty-five races, he said.
Measurements have not been an
nounced but it is said that Shamrock
IV will spread about 10,600 feet of
canvas, Vanitie 9,300 and Resolute
9,100. This will require the challenger
to give the denfender about 6 minutes'
handicap.
