Competition for places on the team to
represent Stanford in the first debate
with Yale next year will be greater than
has been experienced in any previous
tryout, preliminary to a forensic contest
with any other university. Coach M. L.
McClintock believes that tlie strongest
debating squad seen on the Stanford
Campus in years will participate in next
year's forensic events. Although two
of the most active of the local debaters,
H. G. Blote '18, and M. M. Goldstein '20
will not be eligible for another season,
ten or twelve experienced men will be
able to take part in the four debates
scheduled for the coming season.
W. F. Leiscr, '21, will be one of the
strongest contenders for place on one of
the teams to represent Stanford in next
year's contests. Leiser has been a mem
ber of the Joffre squad for three con
secutive seasons, and has an established
reputation as an effective speaker. He
is a member of Encina Club and of
Delta Sigma Rho.
D. L. Goodman '22 will be another

Sigma Rho.

P. F. Erickson '21 and C. J. Crobaugh
'20 have been on several teams repre
senting Stanford on the platform dur
ing the past two years and work to
gether well on a team. Both men are
members of Delta Sigma Rho.
R. C. Fisher '22, W. M. Kilpatrick
'23, L. B. Martin '22. and E. F. Burke '22.

L. \V. Hodges '21. A. J. Anglim '23
and T. G. Irwin '23 were team mates
in a contest with Redlands University
this quarter. They are expected to try
for a place on next year's teams.
The schedule for the coming season
consists of four forensic events, the an
nual intercollegiate with the University
of California in the fall quarter, 'be Pa
cific Coast League contest in the win
ter quarter, tnd the Yale debate and
Joffre event in the spring. A three-man
team will be selected for the first event,
two two-man teams for the second, one
two-man team for the Yale debate, and
the usual three men for the Joffre, mak
ing a total of twelve places open to con
testants.
The debate with Yale probably will be
held at Stanford next year, as well as the
Joffre contest. Coach McClintock has
expressed a wish that the Eastern-
Western debating contest become an an
nual affair in order that more interest
will be taken in forensic activities in the
future. LTnless something unforeseen oc
curs, 'he contract, which will bind the
two universities, probably will be ex
tended after its expiration at '.he clc se of
the second deba'e With the eastern uni
versity.
Competition for places on the team to
represent Stanford in the first debate
with Yale next year will be greater than
has been experienced in any previous
tryout, preliminary to a forensic contest
with any other university. Coach M. L.
McClintock believes that tlie strongest
debating squad seen on the Stanford
Campus in years will participate in next
year's forensic events. Although two
of the most active of the local debaters,
H. G. Blote '18, and M. M. Goldstein '20
will not be eligible for another season,
ten or twelve experienced men will be
able to take part in the four debates
scheduled for the coming season.
W. F. Leiscr, '21, will be one of the
strongest contenders for place on one of
the teams to represent Stanford in next

ber of the Joffre squad for three con
secutive seasons, and has an established
reputation as an effective speaker. He
is a member of Encina Club and of
