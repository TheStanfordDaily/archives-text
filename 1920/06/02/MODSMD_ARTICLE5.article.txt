# Remarkable Result Is Expected From Co-ed Questionaire
## 
### 
Campus women are being solicited
by the Daily Palo Alto in regard
to the amount papa squanders on
the clothes of Stanford's five hun
dred exponents of "Vogue" as she
is done. Questionnaires are being
sent to all the feminine scholastic
body of the University, and results
wonderful and various are expected
when the answers to the queries are
received.
Prince Edward or some one else
said on his last visit to the campus
that the Stanford women were the
best dressed group of women that
he had ever seen. That is some
thing of a statement for one so cele
brated to make, and the question
arises, "How do they do it?" This
quetsion is what the Daily has start
ed out to ascertain.
Thus the question resolves itself
into one for the most intensive of
thought and any help that may come
from male members of the local
knowledge seekers will undoubtedly
prove of inestimable help. The re
sults of the inquiry will be an
nounced in the near future, and
ought to furnish material for some
remarkable treatises on how it can
be done under the present depre
ciated condition of the lamented and
often cursed dollar.
