## 
### 
CLEVELAND, 0., June 2.â€”Senator
Johnson, on arriving for two addresses
lien- today, declared his principal reason
for going to the Republican convention
in Chicago is to see that the"convention
does not pussyfoot or skulk on the
League of Nations." He said: "I shall
insist that the convention take a manly,
courageous stand in opposition to any
league. 1 am entirely satisfied with my
chances at Chicago, but I won't prog
nosticate. Early in my career I learned
that a man who bortsts what he will do
tomorrow generally has to apologize the
day after."
