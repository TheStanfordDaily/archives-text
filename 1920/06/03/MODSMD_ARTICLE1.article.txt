# LINEUP FOR ALL STAR INTRAMURAL TEAM IS CHOSEN
## Several Shining Lights Found in Recent League Race; Only Leading Nines Figure 
### 
Intramural baseball is over until next
year, and all the plaques have been or
dered for the winning teams in the
leagues and the champion of the inter
league series. Theta Delta Chi will get
the plaque for the championship of the
University, and league plaques will be
awarded to Beta Theta Pi, Sigma Chi,
Phi Kappa Psi, Theta Delta Chi, Encina
Bull Pen, and Breakers. These plaques
will be awarded without any restrictions
to the teams that, won them in the base
ball contests and will be the property of
the team permanently.
Material has been developed in the
intramural games this year that was un
known on account of never having tried
out tor a varsity sport. Next year the
intramural games will he carried on and
extended into other sports that have not
been represented" during the last two
quarters.
The several teams that have contended
in the finals of the baseball season just
passed have all shown men of exception
al ability that stood out in some particu
lar nosition on the team. The director
of intramural athletics, Art Acker, and
campus baseball men have watched the
games and have picked the following
teams to represent the entire university
as all-star intramural baseball organiza
tions. Each one of the men named be
low has shown special merit in the posi
tion which he played. No men have been
selected from a team that did not com
pete in the finals, and the selections have
been made with regard to capabilities in
fielding, batting, and head work.
The first nine has a battery of "Dink"
Templeton and Stuart, with Haley and
Criss for extra hurlers. "Dink" only
pitched in one game of the final season
011 account of going east with the track
team, hut his work was so good in the
preliminaries and he had so many strike
outs to his credit that Acker feels justi
fied in putting him at the top of the
pitchers.
Stuart has held the Breakers' pitcher
through the season, and by his general
ship has helped to make possible the vic
tories that the Breakers have made in the
past season.
Haley, the second pitcher on the nine,
has pitched the entire season for the
winning Theta Delts, and his slow ball
fooled many of the heavy hitters of the
opposing teams and has been the cause
of a slump in the batting average of
several star hitters in the different in
tramural clubs.
Criss was the backbone of the Bull
Pen nine, and his speedy delivery
brought the Bull Pen to second place
in the final standing of the league.
Lilly is conceded the first sack with
no opposition. He has been varsity cap
tain and for that reason had something
on the rest in the matter of experience.
His work at first has been a big help
to the Theta Delts in their recent fight
for the championship.
Holmes has been picked for the second
sack partly for his ability as a fielder
and partly for his base running. He
has shown good form in the field, and
his clever performances on the bases
made him stand out as a player of note.
John, who takes the third-base, played
that position on the Bull Pen nine. lie
has been a fast fielder, working through
the season with few errors, and has been
a heavy hitter against all the opposing
pitchers.
Mutt Templeton at short for the
Breakers played the most spectacular
game of the season. In the Breakers-
Sigma Chi game he got five hits and four
runs out of five times to bat, and his
fast work at short has claimed the
attention of the critics throughout the
season.
For the outfield there is a wealth of
material, and the members of the out
field have been selected chiefly for their
hitting ability, with allowance made for
errors. Hamilton of the Beta nine has
been consistent in his hitting throughout
the season and made no errors in the
field during the season. Williamson,
playing center field for the Breakers, was
one of the heaviest hitters in the league
and fast in the field. Eggleston played
right field for the Bull Pen, and his
heavy hitting was a big factor in winning
the four games that the Bull Pen took in
the finals.
On the second string, Mertz, who
caught for the Beta nine, would hold
that position. He piloted the Beta team
through the preliminary season, and
then through the finals. His catching
was without a flaw, and at the receiving
end of Reid's delivery he held the Beta
nine together until Reid lost his arm at
the end of the season.
Neff would be the first pitcher. He
was the strongest man on his team and
would have led the first string if it were
not for the slump that he took at the
last of the season. Richmond, pitcher
for the Phi Psi's, and Reid, the Beta
heaver, are the two alternates. Rich
mond pitched a good game of hall for
the first two games of the final series,
but lost his arm before the end. Reid
was considered by Acker to be the best
freshman possibility for pitcher during
the past season until studies caused him
to leave the squad. I lis work for the
Beta team was remarkable at the first of
the season, but he went to pieces at the
end from too much strain on account of
several consecutive days of playing.
Hi West would undoubtedly he
first baseman. His work on the first
sack for the Breakers was perfect at all
times, and his weakness at the bat is the
chief reason for dropping him to the sec
ond squad.
Anglitn, the big second baseman of the
Bull Pen nine, ought to have a place
on the second string. He was a heavy
hitter and fast in the field, considering
his weight, and made few errors.
Tourney Edwards, third sacker for
the Theta Delts, would be the logical
man for that position on the team. He
made an enviable batting average during
the season and, until the last two games,
played the third sack without a error.
Shortstop is about a toss-up between
Wassum, the Bull Pen shortstop, and
Sheehan, who played there for the Betas.
Sheehan is faster in the field, while
Wassum is perhaps the more versatile,
being a good emergency pitcher. They
are about equal at the bat.
Again taking the outfield chiefly for
their hitting power. Reed, Theta Delta
Chi left fielder and one of the heaviest
hitters on the team, would take first
place. Robinson, who was a consistent
hitter for the Bull Pen, and Trago of the
Theta Delts would be the other two.
