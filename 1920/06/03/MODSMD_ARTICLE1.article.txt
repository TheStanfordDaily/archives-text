## Several Shining Lights Found in Recent League Race; Only Leading Nines Figure 
### 
Intramural baseball is over until next
year, and all the plaques have been or
dered for the winning teams in the
leagues and the champion of the inter
league series. Theta Delta Chi will get
the plaque for the championship of the
University, and league plaques will be
awarded to Beta Theta Pi, Sigma Chi,
Phi Kappa Psi, Theta Delta Chi, Encina
Bull Pen, and Breakers. These plaques
will be awarded without any restrictions
to the teams that, won them in the base
ball contests and will be the property of
the team permanently.
Material has been developed in the
intramural games this year that was un
known on account of never having tried
out tor a varsity sport. Next year the
intramural games will he carried on and
extended into other sports that have not
been represented" during the last two
quarters.
The several teams that have contended
in the finals of the baseball season just
passed have all shown men of exception
al ability that stood out in some particu
lar nosition on the team. The director
of intramural athletics, Art Acker, and
campus baseball men have watched the
games and have picked the following
teams to represent the entire university
as all-star intramural baseball organiza
tions. Each one of the men named be
low has shown special merit in the posi
tion which he played. No men have been
selected from a team that did not com
pete in the finals, and the selections have
been made with regard to capabilities in
fielding, batting, and head work.
The first nine has a battery of "Dink"
Templeton and Stuart, with Haley and
Criss for extra hurlers. "Dink" only
pitched in one game of the final season
011 account of going east with the track
team, hut his work was so good in the
preliminaries and he had so many strike
outs to his credit that Acker feels justi
fied in putting him at the top of the
pitchers.
Stuart has held the Breakers' pitcher
through the season, and by his general
ship has helped to make possible the vic
tories that the Breakers have made in the
past season.
Haley, the second pitcher on the nine,
has pitched the entire season for the
winning Theta Delts, and his slow ball
fooled many of the heavy hitters of the
opposing teams and has been the cause
of a slump in the batting average of
several star hitters in the different in
tramural clubs.
Criss was the backbone of the Bull
Pen nine, and his speedy delivery
brought the Bull Pen to second place
in the final standing of the league.
Lilly is conceded the first sack with
no opposition. He has been varsity cap
tain and for that reason had something
on the rest in the matter of experience.
His work at first has been a big help
to the Theta Delts in their recent fight
for the championship.
Holmes has been picked for the second
sack partly for his ability as a fielder
and partly for his base running. He
has shown good form in the field, and
his clever performances on the bases
made him stand out as a player of note.
John, who takes the third-base, played
that position on the Bull Pen nine. lie
has been a fast fielder, working through
the season with few errors, and has been
