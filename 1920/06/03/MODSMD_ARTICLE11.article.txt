# SEATS FOR 1920 SHOW GO ON SALE NEXT THURSDAY
## 
### 
Next Thursday is the date set for the
advance seat sale for the 1920 farce,
"Good Gracious, Annabelle," by Milton
Bulkley, '20, manager of the production.
A strong appeal is being made for as
many students as possible to remain on
the campus in order to sec this, the last
production of the college year. As no
expense is being spared by the committee
to make their play one long to be re
membered in campus dramatics, a large
seat sale is expected. The appeal is
issued at this time because of the large
number who are making advance reser
vations on trains leaving Palo Alto im
mediately after finals.
"Good Gracious, Annabelle," while a
recent play, has had a considerable run
in New York, and attracted the most
favorable criticism of any play produced
there in recent years. It also appeared
a short time ago in moving pictures
with Billie Burke in the leading role,
that of Annabelle, the light-hearted and
irresponsible divorcee, who through
force of circumstances is suddenly
forced to become a domestic.
The play is, in fact, merely a romantic
farce. In'these days of expensive cooks,
or of no cooks at all, the author, Clrfre
Kummer, has seized upon the kitchen as
typifying, presumably, the balance of
power in our domestic affairs. The plot,
though complicated, is well rounded
throughout, and well connected, the au
dience at no time losing the trend of
events.
The sparkling humor, with which the
play abounds, is in no way lessened by
the completeness of the plot, the action
of the play tending rather, through many
complicated situations, to enhance the
effect of the clever lines.
