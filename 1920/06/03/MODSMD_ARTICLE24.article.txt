which is ingeniously woven about the
fate of a man who though constantly in
love, is seldom in love with his wife.
This gives rise to a number of comedy
situations and the author and cast have
cleverly demonstrated in the rehearsals
their ability to make the most of these.
The tragedy, "Ryland," the second
play on the program, is featured by elab
orate scenic effects and richness of cos
tume. The cast has been working con
sistently, according to Miss Shedd, who

pared to give a well-rounded production.
Stoddard Atwood, '22, in the part of
Ryland, around whom the play centers,

blending of costume and colors.

which are seldom equaled in amateur
dramatics will feature the entire pro
duction this evening. The plays are all
well adapted to the use of lighting ef
fects and rich costuming, and this fact
has been taken full advantage of by
Masquers.
rhe time set for the performance ro
begin is 8 o'clock, and those who have
not procured their tickets will be able
