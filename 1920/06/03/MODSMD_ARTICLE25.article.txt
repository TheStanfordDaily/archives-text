# PROFESSOR GRAY LECTURES IN EAST ON FILM CENSORS
## 
### 
Professor Henry David Gray, who is
now in New York during the spring
quarter's vacation, has been elected a
member of the National Committee for
Better Films. Dr. Gray addressed the
Hxecutive Committee of the National
Hoard of Review on the outlook in Cali
fornia, and the General Committee,
which passes upon pictures before they
are released, on raising the standards of
censorship. Before leaving California
I rofessor Gray established a central
committee for this state in San Fran
cisco, and was made president of the
Affiliation ofl California Committees for
Better Films. The National Committee
lias recognized this affiliation and given
over its work in the state of California
to Professor Gray and the committees
he may organize. To the National Com
mittee Gray advocated a policy of ac
tive propaganda throughout the country,
which the committee adopted, a plan of
publishing annotated lists of photoplays
alphabetically arranged, and a discrimi
nation between plays merely passed and
those specially recommended by the
Board, which were also adopted." Films
recommended as appropriate for chil
dren are to be specially marked. When
these lists are available it will be pos
sible to know in advance the general
character of whatever pictures are to be
shown.
Arrangements are now being made to
have pictures which are first exhibited
on the Coast passed upon in California.
Most films, wherever taken, are sent first
to New York, but there are some which
arc first shown here. On his return
Dr. Gray will select a reviewing com
mittee in Los Angeles. Recently he has
visited some of the larger studios in
New York as a representative of the
National Board of Review and seen the
pictures which arc submitted to this
Hoard before thev are released for the
public. The promicing companies never
question the changes which are recom
mended bv the Hoard, and every year a
considerable number of reels, at an ex
pense of many thousands of dollars to
the manufacturers, are destroyed.
