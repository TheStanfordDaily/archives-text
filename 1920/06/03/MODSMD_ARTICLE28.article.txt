# THE
						DAILY PALO ALTO AMENDMENT
## 
### 
AN AMENDMENT governing the election of editor and the appointment of
the managing editor will be- presented for a vote of the student body to
morrow in the election on Quad. As to the first part of the amendment, cover
ing the election of the editor, there are many points of advantage. In the past
the editors of the Daily Palo Alto have been elected either by a straight
Quad election or by a straight staff election with preferential voting. Neither
one system nor the other has proved to be absolutely satisfactory and prob
ably 110 system ever will reach that degree of perfection. In the proposed
amendment, however, the committee which drew up the recommendation,
feeling that there were advantages in both systems, offered a compromise by
having nominations made by the staff with preferential voting, the final elec
tio of the nominees to be put to a student body vote. In this it is hoped that
the bad features of both systems will be eliminated and that most of the ad
vantages will be retained. The Daily Palo Alto heartily endorses the first
part of the amendment.
As the question of the managing editor there is much to be said against
the proposed plan. In the first place, the managing editor should be an elect
ive position preferably to be determined by a straight vote of the staff. Un
der the new system, the editorial staff of the Daily Palo Alto will have abso
lutely 110 opportunity to express a preference which will be elective unless the
position of managing editor is placed within their jurisdiction.
In the second place, if the position of managing editor is still to be ap
pointive, the editor should at least be given the range of choice so that he
can be in a position to make an appointment which will be made to the best
of his ability. The proposed amendment comes as a result of the appointment
made at the beginning of this term of a man who had not served as long as
any of the newseditors at the time but who was notable on account of an
unusual training in newspaper work combined with marked ability as a
journalist. As long as the responsibility is still left to the editor to make an
appointment the chance should be given the editor fb do the best he can.
If the managing editor were even elected by the newseditors it would be
much better than still passing the responsibility to the editor. Any kind of
an elective system would be preferable to the proposed appointment with the
advice and consent of the newseditors. In many cases this system 110 doubt
might work out but exceptions always come. As long as the newseditors are
to have something to say concerning the managing editor (which is perfectly
proper) why not let them accept some responsibility by electing the manag
ing editor? For the best interests of the Daily Palo Alto it is hoped that the
student body will vote "yes" and the first part of the amendment and "no"
for the second part.
