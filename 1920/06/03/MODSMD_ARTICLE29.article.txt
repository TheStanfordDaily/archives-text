# PINK SHEET TOMORROW
## 
### 
rTHE women will come into their own in tomorrow's edition of the Daily Palo
Alto, when they put out the annual "Women's Edition," as is customary
the day before Women's Field Day. The editorial staff of the paper will be
made up exclusively of the women of the staff, following the old custom of
the Daily which gives the women full swing of the paper the day preceding
the Women's Field Day.
Florence Hocking, '22, has been chosen as the editor-in-chief for the day,
with the following staff: Managing editor, Bertha Vaughn, '22; news editor,
Mary Jane Clark, '22; telegraph editor, Dorothy Nichols, '23; assistants. Olive
Brooking, '23, Mildred Thompson, '21, and Adelhead Saier, '22.
The contents of the "pink sheet" that will be scattered over the campus
tomorrow evening have been kept a secret. It has been the general custom in
the past to use this annual chance to come back at anything which meets
with the disapproval of the 500.
Dame Rumor has circulated several facts that seem to assure the campus
of a treat in this edition of the Daily. It has been rumored that the women
are now writing several articles on different organizations and men promi
nent in campus affairs.
In view of the fact that the women of the staff would have had an ad
vantage had the present editor been a man, it is with great pleasure that she
steps out of her position as editor-in-chief and turns the office over to the other
members of the fair sex. Tomorrow will be a fair test of the ability of the
women of the staff along journalistic lines and the Daily Palo Alto feels
confident that the campus will not be disappointed.
