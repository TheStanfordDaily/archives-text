POLITICAL publicity has reached its zenith on the campus. Roble Hall
* women were honored last night by receiving small calling cards, a sample
of which is given below:
"Miss Blank, your vote will be greatly appreciated,
(Signed) BILL VOSBURGH.
The fact that Vosburgh was not acquainted with any of the young women
in question did not throw a damper on his political ambitions. He distributed
the cards with a generous hand in the hope that the women's vote might
swing the election tomorrow.
In justice to Mr. Vosburgh .it must be stated that he is a transfer and
probably is not aware of the fact that such methods are not looked on favor
ably by the students of the University. Political fights have been staged on
the Stanford campus which no doubt equal anything which has ever been
staged on any other college campus but we have refrained from open adver
tising. The first thing we know every man and woman on the campus will
be asked to wear a button for his or her candidate. Vosburg's innovation
took the prize in campus politics and let's hope there will be no future com
petition along these lines. Confine political publicity to the telephone.
