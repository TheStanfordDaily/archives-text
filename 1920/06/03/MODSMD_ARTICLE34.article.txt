In France some American Negroes |
were sitting beside the road, away be
hind the battle lines, watching troops
moving forward to the front. These
Negroes were commenting on the
on the names of the regiments which
marched by. (Many of the regiments
raised in England were named for the j
counties in which they were recruited,
"Kentish Rifles," "Northumberland
Lancers," "Third Yorkshire Infantry," |
and so forth.) As these British troops
marched by, one of the Negroes took
delight in calling out the name and
number of the regiment. Suddenly 1
down the road came a regiment of
Highlanders in kilts. The Negroes had
never seen a "kiltie' regiment" and
one of them cried: "My! My! Look
dere, Sam, what am datf I)ey is too
big for women and dey cain't be men
'cause day is wearing skirts; what do
you-all 'spose dey is?"
"Why," said Sam, "dey is dat Mid
dlesex regiment."

Here it is at last —The story that
ran't be beat! It comes from Iowa:
Seven years ago a farmer hung his vest
on a fence In the barnyard. A calf
chewed up a pocket of the garment in
which wan a standard gold watch. Last
week the animal, a staid old milch
cow, has butchered for beef, and the
timepiece was found in such a posi
tion between the lungs of the cow
that the respiration—the closing in
and the filling of the lungs—kept the
stem-winder wound up. and the watch
had only lost but four minutes In the
seven years!

"Mamma," said little Elsie, "do men
ever go to heaven?"
"Why, of course, dearie; what
makes you ask that?"
'"Cause, mamma, I never see any
picture of angels with whiskfrrs."
"Well," answered her mother, l
thoughtfulfy. "some men go to heaven,
but they get there by a close shave,
dear."

During a particularly violent dust
storm at one of the camps a recruit
ventured to seek shelter in the cook's
domain. After a time he suggested to
the cook: "If you put the lid on that
camp kettle you would not get so much
of the dust in your soup."
The cook glared at the intruder, and
then broke out: "See here, me lad,
your business is to serve your coun
i try."
"Yes," interrupted the recruit, "but
i not to eat it."

Some years ago a party of pros
' pectors were looking for minerals in
the Ozark Mountains of Southeastern
Missouri. It was during the month
of February, and the prospectors en
; countered a period of very bad
weather, varying from rain to snow
and sleet and back again to rain. One
day, when discussing the weather in
the presence of Uncle Bill Hunter, a
native Ozarkian, one of the party in
quired if the weather would not change
j soon.
"Oh. yes, hit'll change, all right,"
' replied llncle Hill. "All the gosh
durned weather in the United States
comes here to change."

moving forward to the front. These
Negroes were commenting on the
on the names of the regiments which
marched by. (Many of the regiments
raised in England were named for the j
counties in which they were recruited,
"Kentish Rifles," "Northumberland
Lancers," "Third Yorkshire Infantry," |
and so forth.) As these British troops
marched by, one of the Negroes took
delight in calling out the name and
number of the regiment. Suddenly 1
down the road came a regiment of
Highlanders in kilts. The Negroes had
never seen a "kiltie' regiment" and
one of them cried: "My! My! Look
dere, Sam, what am datf I)ey is too
big for women and dey cain't be men
'cause day is wearing skirts; what do
you-all 'spose dey is?"
"Why," said Sam, "dey is dat Mid
dlesex regiment."

Here it is at last —The story that
ran't be beat! It comes from Iowa:
Seven years ago a farmer hung his vest
on a fence In the barnyard. A calf
chewed up a pocket of the garment in
which wan a standard gold watch. Last
week the animal, a staid old milch
cow, has butchered for beef, and the
timepiece was found in such a posi
tion between the lungs of the cow
that the respiration—the closing in
and the filling of the lungs—kept the
stem-winder wound up. and the watch
had only lost but four minutes In the
seven years!

"Mamma," said little Elsie, "do men
ever go to heaven?"
"Why, of course, dearie; what
makes you ask that?"
'"Cause, mamma, I never see any
picture of angels with whiskfrrs."
"Well," answered her mother, l
thoughtfulfy. "some men go to heaven,
but they get there by a close shave,
dear."

During a particularly violent dust
storm at one of the camps a recruit
ventured to seek shelter in the cook's
domain. After a time he suggested to
the cook: "If you put the lid on that
camp kettle you would not get so much
of the dust in your soup."
The cook glared at the intruder, and
then broke out: "See here, me lad,
your business is to serve your coun
i try."
"Yes," interrupted the recruit, "but
i not to eat it."

Some years ago a party of pros
' pectors were looking for minerals in
the Ozark Mountains of Southeastern
Missouri. It was during the month
of February, and the prospectors en
; countered a period of very bad
weather, varying from rain to snow
and sleet and back again to rain. One
day, when discussing the weather in
the presence of Uncle Bill Hunter, a
native Ozarkian, one of the party in
quired if the weather would not change
j soon.
"Oh. yes, hit'll change, all right,"
' replied llncle Hill. "All the gosh
durned weather in the United States
comes here to change."
In France some American Negroes |
were sitting beside the road, away be

moving forward to the front. These
