## Land Where Ancient Games Were Born Seeks Old Laurels

Editor's Note.—As the Olympic pontes
tc'ere born in ancient Greece, tlic United
Press believed the people of the United
States would be interested in knowing
what part modern Greece zvould take in
the Olympic revival in Antwerp this
year. The following story from a U. P.
correspondent in Athens is the result.—
United Press.

(Written for the United Presss.)
ATHENS (by mail). —Grecce, back
on a more or less peace basis'after eleven
years of wars and revolution, hopes to
headtthe minor league at the Antwerp
Olympic games.
As the first step toward regaining the
athletic supremacy she once enjoyed,
Grecce will use American training meth
ods for her team, under the supervision
of Director A. E. Marriott, of the Amer
ican Y. M. C. A. physical department at
Athens, and a corps of American assist
ants brought from the United States
especially for that purpose.
King Alexander is active head of the
committee preparing the Greek athletes
I for the games. The government has ap
propriated 250,000 drachmas ($48,250)
for the team's support, and is ready to
give more if necessary.
Until this year, athletics had been prac
tically forgotten in Greece since 1909,
because of war. Following the 1909
peaceful revolution, with consequent up
heavals in political life, Greece became
a participant in the Balkan wars of 1912
and 1913. Then, with the outbreak of
the European war, she was in a delicate
position, until her entry as one of the
allied belligerents in 1917. Even since
the armistice the Greeks have been ac
tive agaist the Turks in the Smyrna dis
trict.
Under the conditions, many Greeks
bcli eved Greece would have been justified
in declining to compete in the Olympiad;
but participation was made a point of
honor. From the king downward, the
attempt at a "come back" was started
in order to remind the world that Greece
not only originated and developed ath
letic games, but instituted the Olympiad.
King Alexander became sponsor for
the team, and the invitation to compete
was accepted. The committee on the
Olympic games and the Federation of
Athletic and Gymnastic Association —the
two authoritative athletic organizations—
undertook to train the team. Ihe
j Olympic Committee formed an executive
j committee, headed by the King, of which
j specialists in all branches of athletics are
members —even the Y. M. C. A.'s physi
cal director. The executive committee by
means of propaganda familiarized all
athletes and athletic organizations with
the work to be done to form an Olympic
tean.
A suggestion by the Y. M. C. A. that
t!he team be trained under American con
ditions was accepted. Over a month ago
the conditioning of prospective members
of the team was begun at the Stadium.
All athletes arc enthusiastic oyer the
methods. Director Marriott obtained the
King's permission to try out members
of the Royal Guard—the picked men of
the entire Greek army—for the team,
and found much excellent material.
The entire army, as a matter of fact,
is expected to contribute to the team, as
athletics were introduced some months
ago in all organizations.
Taking into consideration the contin
ual mobilization of the Greek forces for
the past ten years, the Olympic out
look is hopeful. Greece is confident of
excellent representation, and though not
expecting victory over the great ath
letic nations of America and Europe,
does expect to be among the leaders of
the second division.
Because of the necessity of practically
recommencing athletics in Greece, the
formation of the actual Olympic team
has not been started. Early in June, spe
cial games will be held for the selection
of team members. '1 his plan was adopt
ed at the suggestion of Marcos Mindler,
nresident of the Federation of Greek
Athletic and Gymnastic Associations,
who was one of a few prominent men
whose support made possible the mainte
nance of athletics during the years of
war.
The greatest advantage the Greek
athletes will have at the games is that of
tradition. All Greeks are prospective
athletes, burning with desire to be
worthy of their ancestors, who taught
the world the rudiments of athletics.
There is every confidence that even in
the lirst year of their rejuvenation the
Greek athletes will uohold the national
reputation for athletic proficiency.

especially for that purpose.
King Alexander is active head of the
committee preparing the Greek athletes
I for the games. The government has ap
propriated 250,000 drachmas ($48,250)
for the team's support, and is ready to
give more if necessary.
Until this year, athletics had been prac
tically forgotten in Greece since 1909,
because of war. Following the 1909
peaceful revolution, with consequent up
heavals in political life, Greece became
a participant in the Balkan wars of 1912
and 1913. Then, with the outbreak of
the European war, she was in a delicate
position, until her entry as one of the
allied belligerents in 1917. Even since
the armistice the Greeks have been ac
tive agaist the Turks in the Smyrna dis
trict.
Under the conditions, many Greeks
bcli eved Greece would have been justified
in declining to compete in the Olympiad;
but participation was made a point of
honor. From the king downward, the
attempt at a "come back" was started
in order to remind the world that Greece
not only originated and developed ath
letic games, but instituted the Olympiad.
King Alexander became sponsor for
the team, and the invitation to compete
was accepted. The committee on the
Olympic games and the Federation of
Athletic and Gymnastic Association —the
two authoritative athletic organizations—
undertook to train the team. Ihe
j Olympic Committee formed an executive
j committee, headed by the King, of which
j specialists in all branches of athletics are
members —even the Y. M. C. A.'s physi
cal director. The executive committee by
means of propaganda familiarized all
athletes and athletic organizations with
the work to be done to form an Olympic
tean.
A suggestion by the Y. M. C. A. that
t!he team be trained under American con
ditions was accepted. Over a month ago
the conditioning of prospective members
of the team was begun at the Stadium.
All athletes arc enthusiastic oyer the
methods. Director Marriott obtained the
King's permission to try out members
of the Royal Guard—the picked men of
the entire Greek army—for the team,
and found much excellent material.
The entire army, as a matter of fact,
is expected to contribute to the team, as
athletics were introduced some months
ago in all organizations.
Taking into consideration the contin
ual mobilization of the Greek forces for
the past ten years, the Olympic out
look is hopeful. Greece is confident of
excellent representation, and though not
expecting victory over the great ath
letic nations of America and Europe,
does expect to be among the leaders of
the second division.
Because of the necessity of practically
recommencing athletics in Greece, the
formation of the actual Olympic team
has not been started. Early in June, spe
cial games will be held for the selection
of team members. '1 his plan was adopt
ed at the suggestion of Marcos Mindler,
nresident of the Federation of Greek
Athletic and Gymnastic Associations,
who was one of a few prominent men
whose support made possible the mainte
nance of athletics during the years of
war.
The greatest advantage the Greek
athletes will have at the games is that of
tradition. All Greeks are prospective
athletes, burning with desire to be
worthy of their ancestors, who taught
the world the rudiments of athletics.
There is every confidence that even in
the lirst year of their rejuvenation the
Greek athletes will uohold the national
reputation for athletic proficiency.
