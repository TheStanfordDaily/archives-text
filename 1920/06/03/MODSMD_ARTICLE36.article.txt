Editor Daily Palo Alto: â€”
The accusations made by the retiring
managing editor in the editorial col
umns of the Daily Palo Alto, of June 2,
and directed at a "large majority of
the staff" are startling, to say the least,
and in my opinion merit some cor
rection. The charges that "a large
majority of the staff are simply seek
ing college honor," that "there is a de
cided lack of co-operation from the
members of the staff," and that "these
staff members seem to have felt it a
politicial duty on their part to handi
cap the work of the Daily as much as
possible" are serious enough to war
rant student invsetigation for the pur
pose of determining their truth.
In the face of such an attack on the
college loyalty of the members of the
D. P. A. staff, who are giving their
time and energy gratis for the benefit
of the Daily, it is only just that some
thing be said in their defense. In the
opinion of one who has been closely
connected with the Daily Palo Alto for
a period of two years and a half, serv
ing in every capacity from reporter to
managing editor, the statements made
last night were preposterous. At all
times during the period I served on
the D. P. A. there existed among the
staff members the greatest personal
sacrifices for the benefit of the paper,
with little expectation of securing any
reward in the form of honor.
There was the greatest degree of co
operation in spite of personal differ
ences of opinion. On every occasion
the majority of the staff put aside per
sonal political inclinations for the
good of the paper.
If the accusations made in your
editorial column last night are true,
just how have these conditions come
about on the Daily? Never in the peri
hat the undersigned served on the
Daily Palo Alto did such conditions
exist. It does not seem probable that
such a situation has grown up since
February of this year.
I do not believe that such conditions
do actually exist. But if they do, there
should be some explanation forthcom
ing to the student body. If they do
not exist, the accusations made last
night certainly merit editorial correc
tion.
The fact that at their recent elec
tion the D. P. A. staff by a two to one
majority selected as editor for next
year a man who has earned his po
sition through three years' consistent
work, in preference to a member who
has served on the staff less than one
year, should carry considerable weight
as evidence that the majority of the
members of the D. P. A. staff are not
politically corrupt.
