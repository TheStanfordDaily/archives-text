# "PRET" HOLT URGES FOOTBALL MEN RETURN EARLY FOR PRACTICE
## 
### 
Football men arc now taking life easy
after the spring practice, which closed
Tuesday afternoon.
In a letter to the Daily Palo Alto,
Captain A. P. Holt emphasizes the im
portance of early football practice next
fall. All men are asked to report for
practice on September 15, two weeks
before the fall quarter begins.
The letter:
"Now that spring football practice is
over, I want to take the opportunity,
by means of the Daily Palo Alto, to urge
every man in the University who has
had any football experience of any kind
whatever, to return to school the fif
teenth of next September. Registration
day is October 3. and our first game
is with the Olympic Club on October 9.
ft is therefore absolutely necessary to
start practice two weeks before the
opening of the quarter.
"Also I wish to express my appre
ciation of the splendid spirit shown by
the men who, regardless of the fact
that Coach Powell could not be on hand
to take direct charge of affairs, willingly
came out and labored to perfcct them
selves in the fundamentals of the game
which are so necessary to success.
"With the acquisition of an excellent
coach, the assurance of the best mate
rial we have ever had, and the prcsencc
of an unconquerable Stanford spirit, we
may feel confident that we can now look
forward to a football season which will
be of the greatest success.
"(Signed) 'Pret' Holt."
