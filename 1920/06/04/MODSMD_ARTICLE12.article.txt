# Annabelle Solves Her Unsolvable Problem in Farce
## 
### 
Poor Annabelle, alone and helpless,
with an unbalanced bank account! She
had to do something, and do it right
away before somebody else did. Harry
worshipped her, but he was broke, and
his wife had named her as a co-respond
ent which showed why lie was broke.
George wanted her for his cook, the
bank wanted her for some bum checks,
and her husband was out in the any
where and didn't want her at all. What
could she do? What would you do if you
were in her dainty slippers: The way
she looped her imagination to find a
way out provides the big kick in the
Senior Farce.
