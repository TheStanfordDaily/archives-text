who will possess the coveted Murray
trophy for the first time offered. 'Jim'
Davies, '22, winner of several state
titles will meet Wm. Burrill, '22. Both
these players have been playing a
very consistent game and a real battle
will be necessary to decide the winner.
In the other haif 'Berry' Fish and
P. Neer meet, deciding who will meet
the winner of the Davies-Burrill
match. 'Berry' Fish has been playing
an exceptional game and win the Mid-
California championships at Monterey
last week.
The Murray trophy was donated by
the former national champion to stimu
late interest in the game at Stanford.
The result has been gratifying with
one of the largest outs in the history
of the sport at Stanford.
