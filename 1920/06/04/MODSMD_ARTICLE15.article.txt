# STANFORD HEROES WRITE ON RAISING OF "500" MARK
## 
### 
The traditional "500" mark will be
raised, as the result of an action taken
it a recent consultation of the Board of
Trustees, the Men's Conference, the
\lumni Association, and the Board of
Control. The meeting was presided over
>y the presideiit and by the Dean of
Men and the Dean of Women.
Owing to the disastrous effect 011 the
cholastic work of campus women to be
surrounded by such quantities of men,
.he straggling lines of co-eds must be
enlarged and their forces strengthened.
As a result of all this the following
communications were sent to The Daily
Palo Alto by well-known Stanford he
roes.
Wess Jells says:
"Nothing would please me more than
to have numerous co-eds z.bout, all over,
not only so that they could attend the
track meets and cheer me on to victorv
with their squeals, but so that I could
rush them for my favorite sorority—that
s, whichever one happens to be my fa
vorite at the time.
(Signed) WESS JELLS.
Yes, yes; increase the number a
the pretty ones and the rest can bring
up the co ed scholarship rccord.
Leuand Pennell Lickering.
There is something about me that co
eds seem to like. I reallv don't know
just what it is—not my figure, surely,
or my face . . . still in all modesty
I must confess it. In consideration of
this fact I must put myself in favor of
an increase in the 500 so that I may be

privileged to give pleasure to a greater
number.
Dontaville Mean Showers.
It really doesn't worry me one wav or
another—soo more or less matters little
to me. Just so that I have someone to
j conic to see me when I am sick and
someone with a machine to drive me
around when I am well, I am perfectly
contented with life.
Robert Porsythe Relouze.
Sam Griggs refused to give a state
ment for publication, but it is a well
.known fact that there is a lady fair in
| the city who answered an advertisement
jhe putin the matrimonial department
I several months ago and who is now pi
ning away for a "cozy chat and a quiet
dinner someplace." Oh, you Sammic
Useless!!!!
More women—more razzes for them
throuph the pages of that mighty period
ical, Chaparral. Bring on the co-eds,
they inspire me to more artistic methods
of razzing, which we hope in time will
become a tradition at this glorious col
lege. Anyway the ones that are here
already arc too busy; I never can get
a date.
(Miss) Les Levee.
After all, it doesn't matter whether
there are more co rds on the campus or
not. Five hundred is a big number to
be pestered with, and, anyway, there is
only one little co-ed in the world for
me. Long Walt Aims.

More women—more razzes for them

they inspire me to more artistic methods
of razzing, which we hope in time will
become a tradition at this glorious col

already arc too busy; I never can get
a date.

After all, it doesn't matter whether
there are more co rds on the campus or
not. Five hundred is a big number to
be pestered with, and, anyway, there is
only one little co-ed in the world for
me. Long Walt Aims.

it a recent consultation of the Board of

Owing to the disastrous effect 011 the
cholastic work of campus women to be
surrounded by such quantities of men,

Wess Jells says:
"Nothing would please me more than
to have numerous co-eds z.bout, all over,
not only so that they could attend the
track meets and cheer me on to victorv
with their squeals, but so that I could
rush them for my favorite sorority—that
s, whichever one happens to be my fa
vorite at the time.

Yes, yes; increase the number a
the pretty ones and the rest can bring
up the co ed scholarship rccord.
Leuand Pennell Lickering.
There is something about me that co
eds seem to like. I reallv don't know
just what it is—not my figure, surely,
or my face . . . still in all modesty
I must confess it. In consideration of
this fact I must put myself in favor of
an increase in the 500 so that I may be

privileged to give pleasure to a greater
number.
Dontaville Mean Showers.
It really doesn't worry me one wav or
another—soo more or less matters little
to me. Just so that I have someone to
j conic to see me when I am sick and
someone with a machine to drive me
around when I am well, I am perfectly
contented with life.
