# WOMEN TO OBSERVE ANNUAL FIELD DAY FESTIVITIES
## HESTER PROCTOR URGES ALL WOMEN TO SUPPORT TEAMS 
### 
Women of Stanford! Our oppor
tunity has come to show the full extent
of the well-known "Stanford spirit." I
have heard people question its presence
lately, but I am firmly convinced that it
needs onlv a little stimulus to start it
on the upward path. Let's turn out five
hundred strong and show these doubters
that we are ready and fit for action;
that we have the interest and enthusiasm
to support our teams with cheer and
songs, that we can make "dates" other
than those usually classed under that
title. In fact, we have the finest kind
of spirit ever exhibited at any time
on this campus.
"Oyer the Top" and "Carry On" from
9 until 6, and see if you aren't pleased
with the way things "go."
I thank you.
(Signed) Hester Proctor.
