# REMOVAL OF RACKS CAUSES DISCOMFORT
## 
### 
Great inconvenience has been caused
to many of the woman-haters of the
campus by the removal of the um
brella racks at Roble Hall. These
racks served as park benches for over
a year now. and just as Rommie Tey
nolds and Weg Pliealton have become
accustomed to the hardness of said
racks, and the moon and weather has
proved most favorable, the unsenti
mental powers that be have ordered
them removed. Plans are being made,
however, to have steam heat for the
racks next winter, so that the wearers
of the cords will not get rheumatism.
