# Mystic Charm Brings Quad Into Its Own
## 
### 
Yea Ouad came into its own this
week. True it was but a reflected glory
which caused its fair arcades to glow
and shimmer, but it was with the soft,
luminous glorv of the moon, which with
its gentler effulgence rivals even its light
giver, the sun, in beauty.
The weblike spell was cast throughout
the arches. It spread within the portals
of the distributor of sweetmeats. Its
magic strands wove their mystic way
even unto the furthermost crannies of
the Row. Its sunshine crept into the
hearts of all who saw, and warmed
them.
And the weaver of the spell itself?
The charmed diffuser of light and glory?
Is there any who has not felt its potencv?
Is there any ignorant of the new era
which the wondrous innovation has
brought to our very doors? Surelv there
is none who watched not and was in
spired not bv the glamour of Louis Mc-
Dermott's Maytime crown, his Greek
sombrero, his new straw lid!
