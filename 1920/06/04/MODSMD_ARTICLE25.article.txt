# CLEAN POLITICS
## 
### 
pLECTION time always brings up anew the question of clean politics. Stan
ford has been more or less invaded lately by political clubs of national
parties! and many of our aspiring candidates seem to feel that the policies of
these clubs are wise to emulate. Card-sending has been reprimanded, but it
remains that there are other equally bad practices. Every time there is an
election, the old question of Hall vs. Row comes up, and the women's houses
are beseiged by numerous telephone calls each day from each side telling
them who to vote for. The truth is that such importunities usually do not
result to the office seeker's advantage, for women have opinions as well as
men upon questions of general interest, and they do not like to be coerced
into voting for one man or another. Strictly women's elections are handled
in an excellent manner, through nominating committees, and without the po
litical workings that attend general elections.
While no direct accusations are made, the campus in general has been
cognizant for some time of the fact that misrepresentations as to qualifica
tions of political aspirants are frequently made by their supporters, rather
than by the candidates themselves. One must realize that this is a college com
munity, and that such misrepresentations are bound to be found out sooner
or later.
Nominations really made from the student body at large are getting to be
the exception rather than the rule, for meetings are held now, one on the
Row and one in the Hall, and these meetings choose candidates, and every
one of the fraternity houses or in the halls, as the case may be, then pro
ceeds to Vote as the meeting has dictated. The fault here lies with the
individual student for letting his opinions be-so influenced by another's views
that he accepts their dictate without any question.
Student control is impossible until all the students are really thinking,
and until they are thinking right and fairly in political matters.
