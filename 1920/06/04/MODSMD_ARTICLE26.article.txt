# THE 						WOMEN'S EDITION
## 
### 
DINK sheets may came and pink sheets may go, but rarely is one published
* under the extremely favorable circumstances that this one is. We refer
to the fact that this is the first pink sheet in history which should have been
a blue sheet for the men. To really be fair, the men should have put out this
edition, for with the sole remaining prop of the Daily back room gone, a
woman has now assumed both the editorship and managing editorship, some
thing which has never occurred before in the many years that the Daily has
been published. Therefore, the men of the staff should have been given the
privilege of taking their spite out on the women in this issue, but realizing
that mere man is incapable of doing so much all by himself, the seven women
of the staff have taken the responsibility upon themselves.
Of course we realize that it must be a sad blow to our faithful men's
honor societies, and non-queening fraternities to have to read once a year
a paper put out by the fairer sex. We are working under difficulties, too,
due to the fact that press of work has deprived us of the ever ready and
helpful advice of the former managing editor. If we were working merely
for college honors, as has been implied, we would probably have quit too and
left this issue to the hands of merciless fate, but we have withstood the press
of work and remained at our jobs.
The staff presents this issue to the campus public with the hope that it
will please, and that nothing of a personal nature published will offend.
