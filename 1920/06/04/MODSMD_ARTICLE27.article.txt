# WOMEN'S FIELD DAY
## 
### 
VfEVER before has Women's Field Day meant so much to the women as it
has this year. The large and enthusiastic rally held yesterday was only
the beginning of the events which are to crowd this week-end. Formerly,
Stanford women have been severely critizized for their lack of participation
in athletics, but the amount of ability and .real interest which should be
shown tomorrow, would go far to contraduct this opinion. True Stanford
spirit dictates that every Stanford woman sign up for some form of sport
tomorrow, and lend her help for the day. We have been accused of being
undemocratic, unathletic, idle spendthrifts, merely drifting through college
on our parents' initiative, and money. The census which is now being taken
of the amount spent each year by each woman for clothes will verify or
correct the spendthrift accusation. That we are not idle is something every
Stanford woman knows, (and also every man who tries to queen one), that
we are not undemocratic is something which time alone can prove, but that
we are unathletic is an accusation which can be answered very strongly on
Field Day. There is a chance for every woman to participate in one of the
many sports offered, since varsity ability is not necessary. Stanford women
can show the stuff they are made of on the athletic field tomorrow. Let
us all then give our heartiest support to whatever sport ia in our line,
and Field Day, June 5, 1920, will be the biggest one in history.
