# HEALTH AND LAGUNITA
## 
### 
ILTHOUGH a source of much pleasure for a short time every spring, La
gunita has lately become a monace to the health of the students living
in houses and dormitories near the lake. Malaria-carrying mosquitos are
very prevalent, and several students have been ill as a result of infection from
them. The lake is now being trained out, but much of the damago has al
ready been done.
President Wilbur in his annual report to the Board of Trustees outlined
as one of the needs of the University a cement floor for Lagunita. This

would enable the lake to be permanent, and would afford pleasure and better
health facilities. The outlying swamps could be drained at small expense,
and Stanford would have a body of water which could be used for crew as
well as for recreational purposes. The cost of such a flooring would be from
$30,000 to $50,000, and could only be raised by student donation or by the
gift of some alumnus. In the meantime, measures should be taken earlier in
the spring to drain the Lake and do away with malarial possibilities.
