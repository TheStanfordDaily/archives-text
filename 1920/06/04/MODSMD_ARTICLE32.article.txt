seven as he looked up from a book
he was reading, "there's a word here
that puzzles me —diplomacy."
"Diplomacy, my son," answered the
father smiling paternally, "means do

right time."

"Oh," said the boy, "then I guess I
used diplomacy last night."
"How, my boy?" asked his fond
father.
"Why, I rolled Johnny over into my
place just before ma came with the
castor oil, and then back again just
before she came to the other side."

and his harassed expression for a mo
ment gave place to one of sympathy.
"I know Just how you feel, old tops,"
he muttered. "So was I."
