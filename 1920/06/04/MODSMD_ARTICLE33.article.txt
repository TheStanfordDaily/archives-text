Editor, D. P. A.:—
May I be permitted to state, through
your columns, a need which has been
long felt in this community, and one
which has been constantly agitated for
some time past? I refer to the pro
posed establishment of an honor so
ciety for campus queeners.
Such an organization would not
necessarily have as its purpose the
encouragement of queening, the activi
ty itself supplying a sufficient impe
tus in this connection, but will aim to
further the perfection of queening
methods and principles.
Another reason advanced for the
establishment of the local chapter is
to make of queening an honor in
itself. There are honor organizations
for almost every activity, such as law,
engineering, chemistry, etc. Then why
bar from praticipation in college hon
ors those who, because of social act
ivities, are kept from membership in
other organizations? Think of the
l umber of students who spend four
long years—to say nothing of time
and expense—in arduous pursuit of
the art of queening, and at the end
of that time, what have they to show
for it all, other than a few dance pro
grams and the stubs of an empty
check-book?
It is a serious problem which con
fronts the men of the University. The
popularity of queening is growing
steadily and the number of queening
majors shows an enormous increase.
Why not give these men the honor and
recognition which is them due?
Yourd respectfully,
A DEVOTEE.

Dear Editor: —
Our fraternity house has just heard
of the movement in favor of a "Honor
Fraternity for Queeners." Now most
of the fellows are not steady queeners
and they can not realize how slpendid
the idea is. There are about six of
us, however, who queen steadily and
we are very much in favor of the
idea.
The argument is this. Those of us
who queen are always trying to bar
row money and even trying to put off
paying our board bills. But until the
present time all odds have been
against us.
But, if there are clever pins awarded
to the steady queeners then, some
times at least, we could get rich by
pawning these pins.
Let me suggest, moreover, that these
pins be paid for by the "roughs" of
the campus and not by the parties
honored. If the queeners were com
pelled to buy their membership into
that honor fraternity, (as in practically
every other one), the idea is not nearly
so good.
If the pins arc awarded twice a
year to the leading twelve couples, by
leading I mean those who have spent
the most money, the co-eds of Stan
ford would be very popular and the
poor men would feel amply awarded
for their efforts.
I hope that the society will be or
ganized at once!
(Signed) A VERY MUCH INTER
ESTED FRATERNITY MAN.
