fTHE great success scored by Masquers' plays last night, more than justified
their existence as a dramatic society. The scenery and lighting effects
were particularly good, and show what can be done with a lively imagination
and small expenditure. Other campus organizations might well follow the
lead of the Masquers, In producing original plays in an original manner.
