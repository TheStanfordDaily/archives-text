# JAPANESE PAINTINGS ARE EXHIBITED AT ART GALLERY
## 
### 
A notable exhibition of the best in
Japanese art ft now being shown in the
Art Gallery. These paintings by Kainan
two smaller rooms of the Stanford
Teizo Shimada are examples of Japanese
brush work, and show genius founded
on excellent training. Mr. Shimada's
vork includes over ninety paintings, some
of which are executed on silk and which
he has artistically framed himself. Al
though the artist is young and his paint
ings are now being shown for the first
time there is a smoothness and finish
to his work that might well belong to a
master hand.
An interesting thing to the American
observer is his treatment of California
scenes, and California bird and plant life.
The familiar Point Lobos at Carmel is
the subject for one of the paintings.
The deep colors and the freshness of the
scene are perfectly reproduced in the
picture. Mr. Shimada has a number of
bird paintings, which while giving the
impression of minute and faithful detail,
on closer examination, are seen to be
drawn with few lines and almost ex
treme simplicity. The brilliantly colored
tropical birds, "Parrot," "Peacc," "Gol
den Pheasant and Chinese Magnolia,"
make striking prints, while "Monterey
Hermit Thrust and Shooting Stars."
"Scottish Thistle," "California Wood
Pecker," "Junco and Digger-Pine" are
more familiar to the Californian.
Three excellent animal are
found in "Tiger in Korea," "River Side,"
and Lion's Roar." The last named pic
tures a lion on the rocks roaring at the
waves and gives the feeling of the inces

sant pounding and the power of the sea.
Something of the same spirit is in "Jap
anese Eagle"in the jagged cliffs and
swirling water.
I "Dragon's Deep" is perhaps the most
impressive picture in the collection, with
the rock walls framing the silver thread
of a water-fall, and the green dragon
rising from a deep blue lake. "Samidare
or Raining Season in Japan" is one of
the exquisite paintings done on silk, in
which the effect of pouring rain is re
produced. Another example of the soft
; ening of the colors is in "Night in Pa-
Icific Grove," with gray fog obscuring
' the distant trees.
| Several other beautiful landscapes,
"After the Rain," "Mountain Village at
Night," "Spring Moon in California."
"Evening in the Autumn," a number of
paintings of WQtnen and girls, and sev
eral illustrating old legends are espe
'cially pleasing.
| Under the heading "Caricatures," Mr.
Shimada presents about twenty humor
ous sketches, achieving with a few
strokes a complete impression. "Sim
plest Life" is a quaint picture of a
Japanese Omar Khayam at his ease.
I while a gourd swings from the boneh.
."Haughty Bat at the Place where Birds
do not Dwell." "Ten Diagrams to Taine
Buffaloes," "Diogenes in China," and
"Coward Knight who is afraid of his
own Shadow" are interesting examples
of this group.
The programs were prepared by Mr.
Shimada and give the legendary setting
for some of the pictures. The exhibition
will last until June 21.

scenes, and California bird and plant life.
The familiar Point Lobos at Carmel is
the subject for one of the paintings.
The deep colors and the freshness of the
scene are perfectly reproduced in the
picture. Mr. Shimada has a number of
bird paintings, which while giving the
impression of minute and faithful detail,
on closer examination, are seen to be
drawn with few lines and almost ex
treme simplicity. The brilliantly colored
tropical birds, "Parrot," "Peacc," "Gol
den Pheasant and Chinese Magnolia,"
make striking prints, while "Monterey
Hermit Thrust and Shooting Stars."
"Scottish Thistle," "California Wood
Pecker," "Junco and Digger-Pine" are
more familiar to the Californian.
Three excellent animal are
found in "Tiger in Korea," "River Side,"
and Lion's Roar." The last named pic
tures a lion on the rocks roaring at the
waves and gives the feeling of the inces

sant pounding and the power of the sea.
Something of the same spirit is in "Jap
anese Eagle"in the jagged cliffs and
swirling water.
I "Dragon's Deep" is perhaps the most
impressive picture in the collection, with
the rock walls framing the silver thread
of a water-fall, and the green dragon
rising from a deep blue lake. "Samidare
or Raining Season in Japan" is one of
the exquisite paintings done on silk, in
which the effect of pouring rain is re
produced. Another example of the soft
; ening of the colors is in "Night in Pa-
Icific Grove," with gray fog obscuring
' the distant trees.
| Several other beautiful landscapes,
"After the Rain," "Mountain Village at
Night," "Spring Moon in California."
"Evening in the Autumn," a number of
paintings of WQtnen and girls, and sev
eral illustrating old legends are espe
'cially pleasing.
| Under the heading "Caricatures," Mr.
Shimada presents about twenty humor
ous sketches, achieving with a few
strokes a complete impression. "Sim
plest Life" is a quaint picture of a
Japanese Omar Khayam at his ease.
I while a gourd swings from the boneh.
."Haughty Bat at the Place where Birds
do not Dwell." "Ten Diagrams to Taine
Buffaloes," "Diogenes in China," and
"Coward Knight who is afraid of his
own Shadow" are interesting examples
of this group.
The programs were prepared by Mr.
Shimada and give the legendary setting
for some of the pictures. The exhibition
will last until June 21.
A notable exhibition of the best in
Japanese art ft now being shown in the
Art Gallery. These paintings by Kainan
two smaller rooms of the Stanford
Teizo Shimada are examples of Japanese
brush work, and show genius founded
on excellent training. Mr. Shimada's
vork includes over ninety paintings, some
of which are executed on silk and which
he has artistically framed himself. Al
though the artist is young and his paint
ings are now being shown for the first
time there is a smoothness and finish
to his work that might well belong to a
master hand.
An interesting thing to the American
observer is his treatment of California
scenes, and California bird and plant life.
