SAN FRANCISCO, June 4.—What's
become of the breweries?
San Francisco had twelve of 'em be
•fore the country went dry. Investi
gation disclosed there are six still
operating full blast —turning out the
stuff that's soft. One has been utilized
as a chocolate plant. The other five
are abandoned.
Breweries operating are the Acme,
Enterprise, Milwaukee, Tacoma, Raini
er and Wielands. Their production of
near-beer is said to be fifty per cent
less than their output of beer with an
alcoholic content in the days of yore.
But brewers are content, it is reported
because the profit in soft drinks is
greater.
The breweries which shut down on
the advent of the dry law are the
Jackson, Hibernia, Albany, North Star,
Eagle and Anchor. The latter's plant
has been taken over by a chocolate
concern.
San Francisco's consumption of
near-beer is greater than was antici
pated, it is said, although the breweri
es do not require forces of employes
as large as previously.
