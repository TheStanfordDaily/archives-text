# MASQUERS' PLAYS AT LAKE PROVES MARKED SUCCESS
## Production Features Unique Lighting Effects and Finished Acting 
### Mary Jane Clark, '22 
Uniqueness in setting, presentation
and interpretation, as well as In va
riety of theme and scenic effects, made
the three plays, "The Constant Lover,"
"Ilyland," and "Punchinello, the Ped
dler," presented by Masquers' Society
at the lake last evening a definite
success and an event which will re
main a marked innovation in campus
dramatics.
The plays themselves were peculi
arly adapted to outdoor presentation.
The combination of artistic color ef
fects, elaborate costumes, simple but
careful details of state sets, and with
the natural setting of Lagunita and
the surrounding trees in the back
ground, together with the studied
manipulation of colored light to
harmonize with the mood of each play,
gave a new and distinct atmosphere
to the productions. The voices of the
actors carried exceptionally well in
the outdoor air, and the lines could
be easily heard in all parts of the en
closed area.
In the curtain-raiser, "The Constant
Lover," Lester Seib, '22, and Melba
Berry, *22, shared honors in the in
terpretation of the clever dialogue.
Sieb's acting showed ease and a sym-
phathetlc handling of the part of the
care-free lover, who, although con
stantly In love, finds It impossible to
remain constant to the same ginl for
any length of time. Miss Berry was
most delightful as the conventional
miss who is somewhat shocked at the
satirical views of the "constant lover."
Her acting displayed a pleasing
amount of spontaneity. The lines and
comedy situations of the players were
both good, but it seemed to lack a
certain degree of finish and smooth
ness, which may have been due to
lack of action in the plot.
"Ryland" was a distinct transition
both in mood and setting, from the
woods and sunshine of the curtain
raiser to the sombre atmosphere of
Newgate Prison. In the character of
William Ryland, Stoddard Atwood, '22,
held the stage during the entire per
formance, and showed marked pro
fessional ability in the role. Beatrice
Edmonds, '21, as Mary Ryland, and
Anna Gardner, '20, as Angelica were
particularly well suited to their res
pective parts. Miss Edmonds dis
played grace and poise, as the sub
missive wife, and Miss Gardner's act
ing, as the famous artist, was most
satisfying. Miss Gardner possesses an
unusually pleasing speaking voice.
In character work, C. M. Patten, '22,
as the gaoler, and H. M. Clark, '23, as
Sir Josua Reynolds, maintained their
character parts with a large degree
of naturalness. Ogden Reavis, '23,
as Raymond Haizlip, and Field
ing, displayed a certain amount of
animated acting, but a not quite
masterful handling of the language of
the eighteenth century.
To Margaret Shedd, '20, director of
the play, much credit should be given
for the well-rounded tone of its pre
sentation, and the ease with which the
action was carried on.
As to character interpretation,
"Punchinello, the Peddler," presented
almost an all-star cast. As Punchi
nello, Arnold Bayley, '23, selling old
loves for new. won the enthusiasm of
the audience from the time of his first
appearance, and maintained his amus
ing characterization throughout.
James Quinby, '19, as Harlequin, show
ed an appreciation of the light-hearted
character of his role, and his panto
mine work was exceptionally good.
Eleanor Anderson, *22, was a dainty
and appealing Columbine, and display
ed marked ability in the quaint role.
A1 Finney, '23, in the part of Pierrot,
was at times, dur'u.g hip ardent love
scenes, forgetful of h'.s impersonation,
but for the most part was the blasee
companion and rival of Harlequin.
Helen Dominguez, '20, as Margot, with
her witticism and constant admoni
tions, supplied much of the comedy
part, and showed herself most capable
in that line. Mary Largent, '20, who
directed the play, is responsible for
th<â€¢ working-up of the atmosphere of
fantasy as well as the thorough in
terpretation of the puns by the mem
bers of the cast.
