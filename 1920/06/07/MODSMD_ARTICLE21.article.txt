# PROMOTION AMENDMENT VALID-SUPREME COURT
## CONTENTIONS OF WETS SWEPT ASIDE IN FINAL DECISION 
### 
WASHINGTON, June 7.â€”The United
States Supreme Court upheld today the
constitutionality of the prohibition
amendment.
The court's action means that the
Volstead law prohibiting the sale of
any beverage containing one half of
one per cent or more alcohol must be
enforced by every state of the union,
regardless of whether any state has
ratified the amendment providing
higher alcoholic content such as en
acted by New Jersey, Wisconsin, or
Rhode Island.
The decree, after three months of
legal attack on the law by liquor in
terests and wet states, is a complete
victory for the federal government and
the prohibition forces.
It is so far reaching that it settles
once and for all that national prohi
bition will stand until the prohibition
amendment is removed from the con
stitution by action of three fourths of
the states. All contentions made by
skillful lawyers of the wets were
swept aside.
