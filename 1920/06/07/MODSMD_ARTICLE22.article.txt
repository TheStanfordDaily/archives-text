] lie following letter has been received
by the Daily Palo Alto which will be of
interest to students who contemplate
going East:
Editor, The Daily Palo Alto,
Leland Stanford Junior University,
Palo Alto, California.
Dear Sir: The California Club of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
was organized last October to fill what
the fifty Californians at "Tech" consid
ered an ever-growing need. In view of
the increasing number of men transfer
ring each year from 1 lie various western
colleges, and the difficulty of obtaining
real information from the official college
circulars, the California men at "Tech"
decided that an organization was needed,
from which the Westerners who intend
ed to come here to finish their college
work could obtain "straight dope" on
conditions here at the 'stute, and the sub
jects that can be taken at Stanford,
for which full credit will be given here.
In addition, the club will help new men
get located and smooth their way wher
ever possible.
There are several Stanford men here
who will always be loyal to the red and
white, and they will doubly welcome an}*
others from Palo Alto.
All those who are interested in any
way in Boston Tech are invited to com
municate with the California Club.
Sinceielv yours,
DALE D. SPOOR, Secretary,
The California Club of M. I. T.
