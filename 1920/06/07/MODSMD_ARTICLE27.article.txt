### 
Voting for the student 1 body president,
the 1922 officers, and the senior woman
representative to the student executive
council, another election will be held on
the Quad tomorrow between 11 and 2
o'clock.
Owing to the fact that no candidate
for president received a majority of the
votes cast the two highest, Fred Adams
and Floyd McElroy, will race again to
morrow.
The ballot of the 1922 class will ap
pear the same as that in last Friday's
election, voting on all class officers as
well as the editor and manager of the
Quad.
Miss Ann Hardy and Miss Margaret
McCall will have to run again for the
position of women's senior representa
tive on the executive committee. Miss
Hardy is credited with 368 votes, Miss
McCall 242, and Miss Laura Getz 150.
B. A. Cody, the only candidate running
for senior representative on the above
named committee, was elected.

sentative on the executive committee, the
count being: Bowes, 470, and Tritle, 297.
Tennis became a major sport with a
vote of 711 for the amendment, to the

the part of those opposed to the addition
of tennis to the Block S class is said to
be responsible for the overwhelming de
feat.

the Daily Palo Alto carried, 625 to 120.
