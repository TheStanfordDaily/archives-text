# McDOWELL returns TO CAMPUS AFTER TRIP THROUGH EAST
## 
### 
J. E. McDowell '00, alumni secretary
of the University, returned to his office
today after an absence of over a month
and a half, during which he visited and
met with alumni groups in centers ex
tending as far as Boston, New York, and
Washington. Altogether he held meet
ings with fifteen such groups, attended
by six or seven hundred former students
of the University.
A number of men intimated that they
intend to make substantial gifts to the
University, although Secretary McDow
ell is not at liberty to divulge the names
of any. One indication of the intention
of the alumni to support University en
terprises is the fact that, as a result of
the discussion of the W/ar Memorial
plan, McDowell received assurances of
contributions from individuals which will
total at least $25,000.
During his trip, McDowell attended
the National Association of the Ameri
can Association of Alumni Secretaries,
held at the University of Michigan in
May. Representatives of 75 universities
and colleges were in attendance.
