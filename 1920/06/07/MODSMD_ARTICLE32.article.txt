# THE 						TEACHING MANIA
## 
### 
MORE than one undergraduate has been more or less flabergasted by the
attitude of many of the departments in the University which constantly
emphasizes the desire and value of preparing for a teachers certificate. It
seems as though of all the practical uses which academic work may be put
to after the student leaves college, the University is most in favor of making
its students (particularly in the cultural departments) into teachers.
This attitude in itself is to be commended but when it is carried to the
point where the student feels himself to be more or less of an outcast if he
doesn't want to prepare for teaching, then there is room for some criticism.
This is the case in some departments of the University. From the time the
students enters the department he is made to feel that a teachers certificate
is highly desirable and that it should be the goal toward which lie is work
ing. This is all very well if the man or woman in question wants to teach
but what if he doesn't? There isn't any particular reason why he should
feel himself looked on with entire disapproval simply because he refuses to
be a pedagogue. â™¦
Some explanation if this attitude may be given. No doubt there is some
thing in the fact that there is a certain amount of loyalty to the teaching
profession which a professor instinctively wishes to make others feel. Added
to that is the tradition that teaching is the natural profession for college men
and women but most particularly this applies to the women and it is the wo
men more than the men of the University who feel the mania which exists for
teaching. The profession is woefully in want of many more teachers at the
present time but it must also be said that here is probably no more abused
profession in the world. So many take it as a stepping stone to other occu
pations.
The time has come when the University must make some recognition
that men and women of today have live vital interests which stretch beyond
the limits of teaching. Men and women should be encouraged to go out into
other fields and more particularly into those which have but recently opened
up where pioneering must be done and should be done by college men and
women. The proposed change in academic instruction will no doubt do much
to eliminate this over-fostering of the academic inclinations but it would
be a fine thing if students could go into every department and hear other
professions discussed and encouraged beside teaching.
