# MAKE THE LAST WEEK A GO
## 
### 
TIHE frenzy of the last full week of college work has again descended upon
the campus and as usual there is some question as to just how many will
come out unscratched from the fracas. The spring quarter is particularly
bad and even worse for the senior. The regret for things undone begins to
pile up ini a bewildering array and the college plodder finds himself in a
terrible dilemma. Old acquaintances should be renewed before the last days
are over. A last fling ought to be taken before the Senior is thrown out on
the world and yet neither one of these things can possibly be done and still
have time left for the eternal grind over the books.
The moral is plain and we have all heard it. Don't put off until tomor
row what you can do today. Four yeais seems a long time, young freshmen,
until you suddenly wake up and find the A.B. you thought you would never
get being thrust upon you. Maybe you, are glad to leave but ten chances to
one you are sorrier than, you will even acknowledge to yourself. Make time
for the things outside of books you want to do. Take time for the many
friendships which you will value so much after you get out of college. Count
the faculty among your friends and don't forget that they are real human
beings and good "gents." Get on the boat and stay on the boat but don't
try to run the University by crabbing. When you say something make it
worth listening to. Don't harp upon catch words but think for yourself.
And what has this to do with the last week in college? Well, it means
that every man and woman in the University wants to look back on the past
year with a certain amount of satisfaction in knowing that he had a part in
the good thing rather than the bad. There isn't much that any of us can
do for Stanford as al matter of fact, and the little that we can offer is some
times taken from U9 by a lack of vision. A little reflection when things are
almost over is a good thing. The last week is here and let's make it a big
go. The time for the sprint has come. The seniors will break the tape with
the A.B. but the rest of the student body wants to come in with colors flying.
