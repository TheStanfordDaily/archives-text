# HOOVER SUPPORTERS BOUND FOR CHICAGO
## Representatives From Every State to Boost Former Food Administrator 
### 
The following item which was re
ceived from the New York Times of
May 28 will be of interest to Hoover
supporters:
"Cheerers and boosters for
Herbert Hoover will abound at the
Republican National Convention in
Chicago. Every State, according
to announcement made yesterday
by the Hoover National Republi
can Club, will send from two to a
score of volunteer workers, bent
on bringing about the nomination
of the ex-Food Administrator by
impressing the delegates with the
strength of Hoover sentiment
throughout the country.
"At least two Hoover men from
each state will be in the conven
tion hall, a few as delegates but
more as spectators and listeners
with their ears to the ground,
ready to take advantage of the
first opportunity when Hoover's
name is mentioned to 'whoop it
up' for their candidate.
"Extensive quarters for Hoover
missionaries have been reserved
at the Hotel Morrison, at Clark
and Madison Streets. This is a
little off the beaten convention
track, but there will be at the Con
gress Hotel, which will house most
of the leaders as well as the
booms, a Hoover headquarters
which will occupy Rooms 6 and
8B on the mezzanine floor, be
tween the headquarters of Gen
eral Wood and Governor Lowden.
"It was announced last night at
Hoover headquarters in the Grand
Central Palace that State Hoover
organizations have been formed in
forty-two of the forty-eight states.
No effort has been made to merge
these into one large national or
ganization, but Hoover headquar
ters in this city in a way has been
the clearing house and distributing
point for Hoover "literature —for
all of wlioch the State organiza
tions in turn have acted as clear
ing houses for the local Hoover
clubs within their respective ter
ritories, of which there are ap
roximately 1,200 in the country at
the present time, according to an
nouncement.
"Because the State organizations
have managed affairs in their own
territory exclusively, little has
been heard in New York City of
the formation of new Hoover
clubs, said a statement made
public last night at Hoover head
quarters. "The rapidity with
which this volunteer work has
gone on in some sections may be
judged from the fact that in
Ceveland last week, forty-five new
Hoover clubs were formed in one
day. This is believed to be a high
record for the formation of or
ganizations of this sort."
