Annabelle, with a husband—some
where—whose only use to her has been
to keep her from marrying some one
she didn't love, furnishes a good share
of the laughs in this year's Senior farce.
"Good Gracious, Annabelle." In the
part of Annabelle, Mona Gardner, '20,
has shown in the rehearsals her ability to
portray the role with a sympathy which
is seldom equaled, according to Coach
Davis.
The play is not a comcdy of the "slap
stick" variety, but a romantic farce
which depends for its popularity on the
effervescence of its lines and situations.
The humor of the play has been de
scribed by eastern critics as more than
contagious, infusing the audience with
a spirit of happiness that was clearly
noticeable in its New York run.
Clare Kummer, the author of "Good
Gracious, Annabelle," was until recently
unknown in the world of American play
wrights, but has recently soared into
prominence through the contagious wit
and cleverness of her plays. A number
of her recent works have attracted fav
orable criticism on Broadway where they
have all enjoyed protracted runs. "Good
Gracious, Annabelle" was written short
ly before the United States entered the
war, and after a sensational run in New
York and Chicago, toured the country.
It has only recently been released for
amateur production, and this will be the
first time that any amateur players have
produced it in the West,
According to present plane, seats for
the 1920 show will be placed on sale next
Thursday, and the committee is anxious
that all who desire to see the farce make
their plans accordingly, before it is too
late to purchase the necessary tickets.
Owing to the unusual size of the gradu
ating class, all of whom will probably be
on the campus until Commencement,
assures an unprecedented seat sale next
Thursday.
