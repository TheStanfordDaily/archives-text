# SINN FEIN COURTS ARE IN FULL-SWING
## Hear Cases and Dispense Justice According to Own Ideas in Ireland 
### United Press 
LONDON, May 4. (By Mail.)—Sinn
Fein in Ireland is rapidly developing a
secret judicial system which, ignoring
the British government, dispenses jus
tice from the Irish viewpoint.
For several months secret courts
have been in process of formation in
southern and western Ireland. Sever
al executions of alleged traitors have
been at the doors of Sinn Fein courts,
but the vast majority of cases have
been purely civil ones—principally
land disputes.
The first instance of an ordinary
civil trial was when Irish volunteers
arrested and held six men suspected
of holding up a Mill-street, County
Cor*, bank and stealing 18,000 pounds.
Most of the money was recovered and
returned,to the bank.
Tremendous surprise was caused in
England by the arrests. Some early
reports declare the money was to be
used for Sinn Fein work, but this
proved to be untrue.
Information has been received that
Sinn Fein leaders plan a thorough sec
ret judicial system throughout Ireland.
It is expected that as the system be
comes more and more effective greater
attention will be paid to especially
flagrant criminal offenses, though pun
ishment of ordinary offenses is difficult
because of the impossibility of impri
soning convicted persons for long peri
ods.
Since its conception, the Sinn Fein
judicial system has handled hundreds
of civil cases. Throughout Ireland, the
bulk of cases in courts, are land dis
putes—over boundaries, rights of way
and such things. Sinn Fein courts,
upon application of litigants, decide
cases on evidence presented and hand
down decrees which are respected.
Sinn Feiners state that many of the
applicants for civil relief through the
secret courts are not members of
Sinn Fein.
