TOKIO, May 14, (By mail to United
Press) â€”Living costs in Tokio have
reached their peak and the trend of
prices is downward. Figures kept by
banks show prices for necessities were
6.58 percent lower last month than
for March.
Articles that have fallen include the
most important staples of the Japanese
family's diet. Rice has dropped about
5.6 percent since March 31.
The general decline is attributed to
the general economic slump in which
Japan finds herself today.
According to the Bank of Japan's
report, 36 representative commodities
were cheaper at the end of April than
they were in- March; five staples have
advanced in price, while fifteen are
running along at the same price level.
