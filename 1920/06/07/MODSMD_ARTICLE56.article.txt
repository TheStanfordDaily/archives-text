# Policy of New Palo Alto Hotel Discussed
## 
### 
Points of similarity and contrast be
tween Princeton and Stanford were
brought out by Professor Jefferson
Elmore, head of the Latin department,
in a talk before the Palo Alto Cham
ber of Commerce luncheon yesterday.
Professor Elmore visited Princeton re
cently during his sabbatical leave. He
discussed the problems confronting
the towns of Princeton and Palo Alto
and said that the example of Prince
ton should be borne in mind in buld
ing a new hotel in Palo Alto. The
famous Princeton Inn failed, he said,
"because it tried to imitate city man
ners and city prices," and the hostelry
here should be patterned along simpler
lines.
