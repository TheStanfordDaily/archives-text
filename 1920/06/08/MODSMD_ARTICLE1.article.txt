## Redemption, Reconstruction, Are twin Tasks Facing G.O.P., Claims Senator 
### 
By United Press
COLISEUM. CHICAGO, June B.—
Redemption and reconstruction of the
United States are the twin tasks to
which the Republican party must pledge ;
itself, declared Senator Lodge of Mass |
achusetts, temporary chairman of the
Republican National Convention, in his'
keynote speech, opening the convention
today.
In a hitter attack on President Wil
son and all his supporters, Lodge de
clared that the primary effort of the
Republicans in the campaign must he to
remove from control or influence over
the American government, "Mr. Wilson
and his dynasty, his heirs and assigns
or anybody that is his, who with
bent knee has served his purpose."
Scathing criticism of Wilson and his
administration marked the entire speech.
After the country has been redeemed.
Lodge said, the work of post-war recon
struction must he pushed with vigor and
intelligence. He paid tribute to what the
Republican Congress has done in this
respect; outlined measures for dealing
with the high cost o*f living; demanded
a vigorous Mexican policy instead of
watchful waiting; called on the party to
stand by the Republican Senators in the
treaty tight and said the people would
now choose between the Wilson plan
and that of the Senate; advised party
harmony and opposed government own
ership of public utilities.
Lodge was silent upon prohibition.
TASK OF PARTY
Taking up his "redemption" keynote,
Lodge declared that President YVilson
and all who agree with him, "must be
driven from all control from all influ
ence upon the government of the United
States." Lodge stressed this as the pri
mary task of the party, in this language:
"They must be driven from office and
power, not because they are Democrats,
hut because Mr. Wilson stands for a
theory of administration and government
which i;> not American. J-Its methods,
his constant if indirect assaults upon the
constitution and upon all traditions of
free government has always rested. The
return of the Democrats to power with
Mr. Wilson or one of his disciples still
the master and the leader of a great
party would be a long step in the direc
tion of the autocracy for which Mr. Wil
son yearns and a heavy blow to the
continuance of free representative gov
ernment. The peril inseparable from
Mr. Wilson and his system involves the
fundamental question of whether the
government of the United States shall
be a government of laws and not of men,
whether it shall be a free representative
government or that of a dictatorship
resting on a plebiscite carried by repel
lant methods. Mr. Wilson and the au
tocracy he represents must be put aside
and conclusively excluded from any fu
ture control. Bear this well in mind
throughout the campaign, for it is the
lirst condition of our ability to enter
upon the path which will carry us for
ward to true progress and to wiser laws.
It is the patli of Washington, Lincoln,
and Roosevelt from which Mr. Wilson
has sought to drag us. We can only
regain it by once and for all condemn
ing the man and his associates who have
thus endeavored to turn us from the
right road. We therefore make our ap
peal for support to all those who love
America, to all, whatever party name
they happen to bear, who are true to
the faith of the fathers, to join us in
this great work of redemption."
TREATY ISSUE
"We must be now and forever for
Americanism and nationalism and
against internationalism," he continued.
"There is no safety for us if we do
otherwise."
The work of redemption accomplished,
it is the party's first duty, Ludge said,
to re-establish order and respect for
law, following that with a vigorous at
tack on the domestic problems of the
day, the first of which in importance, he
said, is the high cost of living.
The Republican Congress has already
made a beginning toward handling this
and other problems, Lodge said, but
has been hampered and opposed by a
hostile prude. Many necessary econom
ic measures, particularly "protective tar
iff legislation to guard industries, arc
of socialistic proclivities in the White
impossible with a Democratic free trader
House," Lodge asserted. Reduction of
government expenditures has been .ac
complished, he added, hut only against
departmental resistance, "habits of waste
backedo by mal administration, sacrifice
of efficiency to political purposes and in
certain cases by an incompetency so mar
velous that it cannot be due to nature
but must he the result of art.
While "some of the master minds of
the Democratic party arc chiruping away
like little birds that nothing has been
done," Lodge said, "the Republican
Congress has made in 18 months a rcc
ord of legislation which he declared
would not suffer by comparison with the
five-year record of the democrats preced
ing the war. He listed as among Repub
lican legislative achievements, reduction
of government estimate more than
$1,000,000,000; enactment of the "il leas
ing and water power bills; passage of
a vocational rehabilitation bill for sol
diers; bills for disposition of war mate
rial ; improvement of the Federal reserve
and farm loan acts; increase in pen
sions of civil war veterans; adoption of
a civil service retirement measure and a
return of the army and navy to a peace
footing and increase of the pay of both
branches of the service; passage of a
budget bill which was vetoed; the mer
chant marine bill and the railroad law.
Lodge said this is but a beginning, and
counseled care rather than haste in deal
ing with reconstruction problems, so
that the action taken may be of lasting
value.
PRICES AND CURRENCY
.. T r,le . rise of prices, the high cost of
livmg, is the most pressing as it is the
most difficult and most essential problem
which confronts us," said Lodge. "Profi
teering is subject now to ample punitive
| laws, i hose laws should be enforced,
not in the headlines of the newspapers
| after the manner of the present Attor-
IGeneral, but quietly, thoroughly, and
| efficiently in the courts of the United
States. Something more in this direc
tion can be accomplished by the proper
regulation of a cold storage, and a bill
for that purpose has passed both houses
and is now in conference."
Deflation of currency and credit also
ivould do much to reduce living costs,
Lodge added, declaring that 'it should
i P ne - 'i rs t acts of Congress to
,deal with this essential point."
, Ihe most potent remedy of all, how
ever, is increased production, he said,
and though legislation cannot accomplish
; this directly, and "just how much the
(government can do is uncertain, it can
aid and support, and if anything can be
done it must be not be omitted or over
looked," Lodge said.
MEXICAN QUESTION
Lodge next took up the Mexican ques
tion._ hotly criticized the "watchful
waiting policy" of the administration,
and declared:
"We have watched and waited long
.enough. It is time that this condition,
disgraceful to us and ruinous to Mexico,
should cease. We need a firm hand at
the helm. Let the Mexicans choose as
their president some strong and upright
man, friendly to the United States, and
then let the United States give him real
,and cordial support and so strengthen
and uphold him that he will he able to
exterminate the bandits and put an end
to the civil war. The Mexican people
would not resent the influence or inter
vention of the United States if it would
: only help to bring them peace under a
president of their own choosing.
"The President has been unwilling or
unable to do anything for Mexico, but lie
thinks it our duty to take a mandate for
Armenia, which would involve our send
ing any army there for an indefinite
time, and the cost would be 276,000,000
for the first year, besides entangling us
in all the quarrels and intrigues of Asia-
Minor. Mexico lies at our door. It is
B primary duty to deal with it. We are
janxtous to help Armenia in all reasonable
ways and no doubt shall do so, but to
take a mandate—the only answer is a
plain refusal."
DISCUSSES TREATY
From Mexico and Armenia Lodge
to a discussion of the treaty. He
declared, in a lengthy review of the
treaty tight President Wilson has pre
vented restoration of peace between the
United States and Germany. The peo
ple of the conntry, he asserted, are with
the Republican Senators who refused to
accept the Wilson treaty and League of
/Nations covenant.
AGAINST GOV'T OWNERSHIP
Lodge declared emphatically against
government ownership of railroads, on
the ground that in the end it would mean
"not only that the government should
own the railroads, but that those who
run the railroads shall own the govern
ment. The rights of the general public
would disappear under this scheme and
nothing would be left to the people but
the duty of paying taxes to support the
rv>ads. Our government must not be
dominated by any one man or class or
'any selected body of men who repre
sent a part of the people and not the
whole people."

Lodge said this is but a beginning, and
counseled care rather than haste in deal

that the action taken may be of lasting

PRICES AND CURRENCY
.. T r,le . rise of prices, the high cost of
livmg, is the most pressing as it is the
most difficult and most essential problem
which confronts us," said Lodge. "Profi
teering is subject now to ample punitive
| laws, i hose laws should be enforced,
not in the headlines of the newspapers
| after the manner of the present Attor-
IGeneral, but quietly, thoroughly, and
| efficiently in the courts of the United

regulation of a cold storage, and a bill
for that purpose has passed both houses
and is now in conference."
Deflation of currency and credit also
ivould do much to reduce living costs,
Lodge added, declaring that 'it should
i P ne - 'i rs t acts of Congress to
,deal with this essential point."
, Ihe most potent remedy of all, how
ever, is increased production, he said,
and though legislation cannot accomplish
; this directly, and "just how much the
(government can do is uncertain, it can
aid and support, and if anything can be
done it must be not be omitted or over
looked," Lodge said.
MEXICAN QUESTION
Lodge next took up the Mexican ques
tion._ hotly criticized the "watchful
waiting policy" of the administration,
and declared:
"We have watched and waited long
.enough. It is time that this condition,
disgraceful to us and ruinous to Mexico,
should cease. We need a firm hand at
the helm. Let the Mexicans choose as
their president some strong and upright
man, friendly to the United States, and
then let the United States give him real
,and cordial support and so strengthen
and uphold him that he will he able to
exterminate the bandits and put an end
to the civil war. The Mexican people
would not resent the influence or inter
vention of the United States if it would
: only help to bring them peace under a
president of their own choosing.
"The President has been unwilling or
unable to do anything for Mexico, but lie
thinks it our duty to take a mandate for
Armenia, which would involve our send
ing any army there for an indefinite
time, and the cost would be 276,000,000
for the first year, besides entangling us
in all the quarrels and intrigues of Asia-
Minor. Mexico lies at our door. It is
B primary duty to deal with it. We are
janxtous to help Armenia in all reasonable
ways and no doubt shall do so, but to
take a mandate—the only answer is a
plain refusal."
DISCUSSES TREATY
From Mexico and Armenia Lodge
to a discussion of the treaty. He
declared, in a lengthy review of the
treaty tight President Wilson has pre
vented restoration of peace between the
United States and Germany. The peo
ple of the conntry, he asserted, are with
the Republican Senators who refused to
accept the Wilson treaty and League of
/Nations covenant.
AGAINST GOV'T OWNERSHIP
Lodge declared emphatically against
government ownership of railroads, on
the ground that in the end it would mean
"not only that the government should
own the railroads, but that those who
run the railroads shall own the govern
ment. The rights of the general public
would disappear under this scheme and
nothing would be left to the people but
the duty of paying taxes to support the
rv>ads. Our government must not be
dominated by any one man or class or
'any selected body of men who repre
sent a part of the people and not the
whole people."
By United Press
COLISEUM. CHICAGO, June B.—
Redemption and reconstruction of the
United States are the twin tasks to
which the Republican party must pledge ;
itself, declared Senator Lodge of Mass |
achusetts, temporary chairman of the
Republican National Convention, in his'
keynote speech, opening the convention
today.
In a hitter attack on President Wil
son and all his supporters, Lodge de
clared that the primary effort of the
Republicans in the campaign must he to
remove from control or influence over
the American government, "Mr. Wilson
and his dynasty, his heirs and assigns
or anybody that is his, who with
bent knee has served his purpose."
Scathing criticism of Wilson and his
administration marked the entire speech.
After the country has been redeemed.
Lodge said, the work of post-war recon
struction must he pushed with vigor and
intelligence. He paid tribute to what the
Republican Congress has done in this
respect; outlined measures for dealing
with the high cost o*f living; demanded
a vigorous Mexican policy instead of
watchful waiting; called on the party to
stand by the Republican Senators in the
treaty tight and said the people would
now choose between the Wilson plan
and that of the Senate; advised party
harmony and opposed government own
ership of public utilities.
Lodge was silent upon prohibition.
TASK OF PARTY
Taking up his "redemption" keynote,
Lodge declared that President YVilson
and all who agree with him, "must be
driven from all control from all influ
ence upon the government of the United
States." Lodge stressed this as the pri
mary task of the party, in this language:
"They must be driven from office and
power, not because they are Democrats,
hut because Mr. Wilson stands for a
theory of administration and government
which i;> not American. J-Its methods,
his constant if indirect assaults upon the
constitution and upon all traditions of
free government has always rested. The
return of the Democrats to power with
Mr. Wilson or one of his disciples still
the master and the leader of a great
party would be a long step in the direc
tion of the autocracy for which Mr. Wil
son yearns and a heavy blow to the
continuance of free representative gov
ernment. The peril inseparable from
Mr. Wilson and his system involves the
fundamental question of whether the
government of the United States shall
be a government of laws and not of men,
whether it shall be a free representative
government or that of a dictatorship
resting on a plebiscite carried by repel
lant methods. Mr. Wilson and the au
tocracy he represents must be put aside
and conclusively excluded from any fu
ture control. Bear this well in mind
throughout the campaign, for it is the
lirst condition of our ability to enter
upon the path which will carry us for
ward to true progress and to wiser laws.
It is the patli of Washington, Lincoln,
and Roosevelt from which Mr. Wilson
has sought to drag us. We can only
regain it by once and for all condemn
ing the man and his associates who have
thus endeavored to turn us from the
right road. We therefore make our ap
peal for support to all those who love
America, to all, whatever party name
they happen to bear, who are true to
the faith of the fathers, to join us in
this great work of redemption."
TREATY ISSUE
"We must be now and forever for
Americanism and nationalism and
against internationalism," he continued.
"There is no safety for us if we do
otherwise."
The work of redemption accomplished,
it is the party's first duty, Ludge said,
to re-establish order and respect for
law, following that with a vigorous at
tack on the domestic problems of the
day, the first of which in importance, he
said, is the high cost of living.
The Republican Congress has already
made a beginning toward handling this
and other problems, Lodge said, but
has been hampered and opposed by a
hostile prude. Many necessary econom
ic measures, particularly "protective tar
iff legislation to guard industries, arc
of socialistic proclivities in the White
impossible with a Democratic free trader
House," Lodge asserted. Reduction of
government expenditures has been .ac
complished, he added, hut only against
departmental resistance, "habits of waste
backedo by mal administration, sacrifice
of efficiency to political purposes and in
certain cases by an incompetency so mar
velous that it cannot be due to nature
but must he the result of art.
While "some of the master minds of
the Democratic party arc chiruping away
like little birds that nothing has been
done," Lodge said, "the Republican
Congress has made in 18 months a rcc
ord of legislation which he declared
would not suffer by comparison with the
five-year record of the democrats preced
ing the war. He listed as among Repub
lican legislative achievements, reduction
of government estimate more than
$1,000,000,000; enactment of the "il leas
ing and water power bills; passage of
a vocational rehabilitation bill for sol
diers; bills for disposition of war mate
rial ; improvement of the Federal reserve
and farm loan acts; increase in pen
sions of civil war veterans; adoption of
a civil service retirement measure and a
return of the army and navy to a peace

branches of the service; passage of a

After the country has been redeemed.
Lodge said, the work of post-war recon
struction must he pushed with vigor and
intelligence. He paid tribute to what the
Republican Congress has done in this
respect; outlined measures for dealing
with the high cost o*f living; demanded
a vigorous Mexican policy instead of
watchful waiting; called on the party to
stand by the Republican Senators in the
treaty tight and said the people would
now choose between the Wilson plan
and that of the Senate; advised party
harmony and opposed government own
ership of public utilities.
Lodge was silent upon prohibition.
TASK OF PARTY
Taking up his "redemption" keynote,
Lodge declared that President YVilson
and all who agree with him, "must be
driven from all control from all influ
ence upon the government of the United
States." Lodge stressed this as the pri
mary task of the party, in this language:
"They must be driven from office and
power, not because they are Democrats,
hut because Mr. Wilson stands for a
theory of administration and government
which i;> not American. J-Its methods,
his constant if indirect assaults upon the
constitution and upon all traditions of
free government has always rested. The
return of the Democrats to power with
Mr. Wilson or one of his disciples still
the master and the leader of a great
party would be a long step in the direc
tion of the autocracy for which Mr. Wil
son yearns and a heavy blow to the
continuance of free representative gov
ernment. The peril inseparable from
Mr. Wilson and his system involves the
fundamental question of whether the
government of the United States shall
be a government of laws and not of men,
whether it shall be a free representative
government or that of a dictatorship
resting on a plebiscite carried by repel
lant methods. Mr. Wilson and the au
tocracy he represents must be put aside
and conclusively excluded from any fu
ture control. Bear this well in mind
throughout the campaign, for it is the
lirst condition of our ability to enter
upon the path which will carry us for
ward to true progress and to wiser laws.
It is the patli of Washington, Lincoln,
and Roosevelt from which Mr. Wilson
has sought to drag us. We can only
regain it by once and for all condemn
ing the man and his associates who have
thus endeavored to turn us from the
right road. We therefore make our ap
peal for support to all those who love
America, to all, whatever party name
they happen to bear, who are true to
the faith of the fathers, to join us in
this great work of redemption."
TREATY ISSUE
"We must be now and forever for
Americanism and nationalism and
against internationalism," he continued.
"There is no safety for us if we do
otherwise."
The work of redemption accomplished,
it is the party's first duty, Ludge said,
to re-establish order and respect for
law, following that with a vigorous at
tack on the domestic problems of the
day, the first of which in importance, he
said, is the high cost of living.
The Republican Congress has already
made a beginning toward handling this
and other problems, Lodge said, but
has been hampered and opposed by a
hostile prude. Many necessary econom
ic measures, particularly "protective tar
iff legislation to guard industries, arc
of socialistic proclivities in the White
impossible with a Democratic free trader
House," Lodge asserted. Reduction of
government expenditures has been .ac
complished, he added, hut only against
departmental resistance, "habits of waste
backedo by mal administration, sacrifice
of efficiency to political purposes and in
certain cases by an incompetency so mar
velous that it cannot be due to nature
but must he the result of art.
While "some of the master minds of
the Democratic party arc chiruping away
like little birds that nothing has been
done," Lodge said, "the Republican
Congress has made in 18 months a rcc
ord of legislation which he declared
would not suffer by comparison with the
five-year record of the democrats preced
ing the war. He listed as among Repub
lican legislative achievements, reduction
of government estimate more than
$1,000,000,000; enactment of the "il leas
ing and water power bills; passage of
a vocational rehabilitation bill for sol
diers; bills for disposition of war mate
rial ; improvement of the Federal reserve
and farm loan acts; increase in pen
sions of civil war veterans; adoption of
a civil service retirement measure and a
return of the army and navy to a peace
footing and increase of the pay of both
branches of the service; passage of a
budget bill which was vetoed; the mer
chant marine bill and the railroad law.
Lodge said this is but a beginning, and
counseled care rather than haste in deal
ing with reconstruction problems, so
that the action taken may be of lasting
value.
PRICES AND CURRENCY
.. T r,le . rise of prices, the high cost of
livmg, is the most pressing as it is the
most difficult and most essential problem
which confronts us," said Lodge. "Profi
teering is subject now to ample punitive
| laws, i hose laws should be enforced,
not in the headlines of the newspapers
| after the manner of the present Attor-
IGeneral, but quietly, thoroughly, and
| efficiently in the courts of the United
States. Something more in this direc
tion can be accomplished by the proper
regulation of a cold storage, and a bill
for that purpose has passed both houses
and is now in conference."
Deflation of currency and credit also
ivould do much to reduce living costs,
Lodge added, declaring that 'it should
i P ne - 'i rs t acts of Congress to
,deal with this essential point."
, Ihe most potent remedy of all, how
ever, is increased production, he said,
and though legislation cannot accomplish
; this directly, and "just how much the
(government can do is uncertain, it can
aid and support, and if anything can be
done it must be not be omitted or over
looked," Lodge said.
MEXICAN QUESTION
Lodge next took up the Mexican ques
tion._ hotly criticized the "watchful
waiting policy" of the administration,
and declared:
"We have watched and waited long
.enough. It is time that this condition,
disgraceful to us and ruinous to Mexico,
should cease. We need a firm hand at
the helm. Let the Mexicans choose as
their president some strong and upright
man, friendly to the United States, and
then let the United States give him real
,and cordial support and so strengthen
and uphold him that he will he able to
exterminate the bandits and put an end
to the civil war. The Mexican people
would not resent the influence or inter
vention of the United States if it would
: only help to bring them peace under a
president of their own choosing.
"The President has been unwilling or
unable to do anything for Mexico, but lie
thinks it our duty to take a mandate for
Armenia, which would involve our send
ing any army there for an indefinite
time, and the cost would be 276,000,000
for the first year, besides entangling us
in all the quarrels and intrigues of Asia-
Minor. Mexico lies at our door. It is
B primary duty to deal with it. We are
janxtous to help Armenia in all reasonable
ways and no doubt shall do so, but to
take a mandate—the only answer is a
plain refusal."
DISCUSSES TREATY
From Mexico and Armenia Lodge
to a discussion of the treaty. He
declared, in a lengthy review of the
treaty tight President Wilson has pre
vented restoration of peace between the
United States and Germany. The peo
ple of the conntry, he asserted, are with
the Republican Senators who refused to
accept the Wilson treaty and League of
/Nations covenant.
AGAINST GOV'T OWNERSHIP
Lodge declared emphatically against
government ownership of railroads, on
the ground that in the end it would mean
"not only that the government should
own the railroads, but that those who
run the railroads shall own the govern
ment. The rights of the general public
would disappear under this scheme and
nothing would be left to the people but
the duty of paying taxes to support the
rv>ads. Our government must not be
dominated by any one man or class or
'any selected body of men who repre
sent a part of the people and not the
whole people."

United States are the twin tasks to
which the Republican party must pledge ;

Republican National Convention, in his'
keynote speech, opening the convention
today.
In a hitter attack on President Wil

most difficult and most essential problem
which confronts us," said Lodge. "Profi
teering is subject now to ample punitive
| laws, i hose laws should be enforced,
not in the headlines of the newspapers
| after the manner of the present Attor-
IGeneral, but quietly, thoroughly, and
| efficiently in the courts of the United
States. Something more in this direc
tion can be accomplished by the proper
regulation of a cold storage, and a bill
for that purpose has passed both houses
and is now in conference."
Deflation of currency and credit also
ivould do much to reduce living costs,
Lodge added, declaring that 'it should
i P ne - 'i rs t acts of Congress to
,deal with this essential point."
, Ihe most potent remedy of all, how
ever, is increased production, he said,
and though legislation cannot accomplish
; this directly, and "just how much the
(government can do is uncertain, it can
aid and support, and if anything can be
done it must be not be omitted or over
looked," Lodge said.
MEXICAN QUESTION
Lodge next took up the Mexican ques
tion._ hotly criticized the "watchful
waiting policy" of the administration,
and declared:
"We have watched and waited long
.enough. It is time that this condition,
disgraceful to us and ruinous to Mexico,
should cease. We need a firm hand at
the helm. Let the Mexicans choose as
their president some strong and upright
man, friendly to the United States, and
then let the United States give him real
,and cordial support and so strengthen
and uphold him that he will he able to
exterminate the bandits and put an end
to the civil war. The Mexican people
would not resent the influence or inter
vention of the United States if it would
: only help to bring them peace under a
president of their own choosing.
"The President has been unwilling or
unable to do anything for Mexico, but lie
thinks it our duty to take a mandate for
Armenia, which would involve our send
ing any army there for an indefinite
time, and the cost would be 276,000,000
for the first year, besides entangling us
in all the quarrels and intrigues of Asia-
Minor. Mexico lies at our door. It is
B primary duty to deal with it. We are
janxtous to help Armenia in all reasonable
ways and no doubt shall do so, but to
take a mandate—the only answer is a
plain refusal."
DISCUSSES TREATY
From Mexico and Armenia Lodge
to a discussion of the treaty. He
declared, in a lengthy review of the
treaty tight President Wilson has pre
vented restoration of peace between the
United States and Germany. The peo
ple of the conntry, he asserted, are with
the Republican Senators who refused to
accept the Wilson treaty and League of
/Nations covenant.
AGAINST GOV'T OWNERSHIP
Lodge declared emphatically against
government ownership of railroads, on
the ground that in the end it would mean
"not only that the government should
own the railroads, but that those who
run the railroads shall own the govern
ment. The rights of the general public
would disappear under this scheme and
nothing would be left to the people but
the duty of paying taxes to support the
rv>ads. Our government must not be
dominated by any one man or class or
'any selected body of men who repre
sent a part of the people and not the
whole people."
By United Press
COLISEUM. CHICAGO, June B.—
Redemption and reconstruction of the
United States are the twin tasks to
which the Republican party must pledge ;
itself, declared Senator Lodge of Mass |
achusetts, temporary chairman of the
Republican National Convention, in his'
keynote speech, opening the convention
today.
In a hitter attack on President Wil
son and all his supporters, Lodge de
clared that the primary effort of the
Republicans in the campaign must he to
remove from control or influence over
the American government, "Mr. Wilson
and his dynasty, his heirs and assigns
or anybody that is his, who with
bent knee has served his purpose."
Scathing criticism of Wilson and his
administration marked the entire speech.
After the country has been redeemed.
Lodge said, the work of post-war recon
struction must he pushed with vigor and
intelligence. He paid tribute to what the
Republican Congress has done in this
respect; outlined measures for dealing
with the high cost o*f living; demanded
a vigorous Mexican policy instead of
watchful waiting; called on the party to
stand by the Republican Senators in the
treaty tight and said the people would
now choose between the Wilson plan
and that of the Senate; advised party
harmony and opposed government own
ership of public utilities.
Lodge was silent upon prohibition.
TASK OF PARTY
Taking up his "redemption" keynote,
Lodge declared that President YVilson
and all who agree with him, "must be
driven from all control from all influ
ence upon the government of the United
States." Lodge stressed this as the pri
mary task of the party, in this language:
"They must be driven from office and
power, not because they are Democrats,
hut because Mr. Wilson stands for a
theory of administration and government
which i;> not American. J-Its methods,
his constant if indirect assaults upon the
constitution and upon all traditions of
free government has always rested. The
return of the Democrats to power with
Mr. Wilson or one of his disciples still
the master and the leader of a great
party would be a long step in the direc
tion of the autocracy for which Mr. Wil
son yearns and a heavy blow to the
continuance of free representative gov
ernment. The peril inseparable from
Mr. Wilson and his system involves the
fundamental question of whether the
government of the United States shall
be a government of laws and not of men,
whether it shall be a free representative
government or that of a dictatorship
resting on a plebiscite carried by repel
lant methods. Mr. Wilson and the au
tocracy he represents must be put aside
and conclusively excluded from any fu
ture control. Bear this well in mind
throughout the campaign, for it is the
lirst condition of our ability to enter
upon the path which will carry us for
ward to true progress and to wiser laws.
It is the patli of Washington, Lincoln,
and Roosevelt from which Mr. Wilson
has sought to drag us. We can only
regain it by once and for all condemn
ing the man and his associates who have
thus endeavored to turn us from the
right road. We therefore make our ap
peal for support to all those who love
America, to all, whatever party name
they happen to bear, who are true to
the faith of the fathers, to join us in
this great work of redemption."
TREATY ISSUE
"We must be now and forever for
Americanism and nationalism and
against internationalism," he continued.
"There is no safety for us if we do
otherwise."
The work of redemption accomplished,
it is the party's first duty, Ludge said,
to re-establish order and respect for
law, following that with a vigorous at
tack on the domestic problems of the
day, the first of which in importance, he
said, is the high cost of living.
The Republican Congress has already
made a beginning toward handling this
and other problems, Lodge said, but
has been hampered and opposed by a
hostile prude. Many necessary econom
ic measures, particularly "protective tar
iff legislation to guard industries, arc
of socialistic proclivities in the White
impossible with a Democratic free trader
House," Lodge asserted. Reduction of
government expenditures has been .ac
complished, he added, hut only against
departmental resistance, "habits of waste
backedo by mal administration, sacrifice
of efficiency to political purposes and in
certain cases by an incompetency so mar
velous that it cannot be due to nature
but must he the result of art.
While "some of the master minds of
the Democratic party arc chiruping away
like little birds that nothing has been
done," Lodge said, "the Republican
Congress has made in 18 months a rcc
ord of legislation which he declared
would not suffer by comparison with the
five-year record of the democrats preced
ing the war. He listed as among Repub
lican legislative achievements, reduction
of government estimate more than
$1,000,000,000; enactment of the "il leas
ing and water power bills; passage of
a vocational rehabilitation bill for sol
diers; bills for disposition of war mate
rial ; improvement of the Federal reserve
and farm loan acts; increase in pen
sions of civil war veterans; adoption of
a civil service retirement measure and a
return of the army and navy to a peace
footing and increase of the pay of both
branches of the service; passage of a
budget bill which was vetoed; the mer
chant marine bill and the railroad law.
Lodge said this is but a beginning, and
counseled care rather than haste in deal
ing with reconstruction problems, so
that the action taken may be of lasting
value.
PRICES AND CURRENCY
.. T r,le . rise of prices, the high cost of
livmg, is the most pressing as it is the
most difficult and most essential problem
which confronts us," said Lodge. "Profi
teering is subject now to ample punitive
