# RUGBY TEAM TO HAVE FUNDS FOR TRIP TO ANTWERP
## National Olympic Committee Promises to Cover Deficit; Stars Will Enter Big Meet 
### 
Guarantees by the National Olympic
Committee that any deficit in the sum
necessary to finance the rugby trip to
Antwerp will be covered by the com
mittee, has removed the last doubt that
a California rugby fifteen wlil be en
tered in the Olympic meet. Coach H.
Wilfred Maloney this morning an
nounced the definite decision of the
Olympic committee which will enable
the Stanford rugby stars to enter the big
contest in August.
A meeting of the Olympic Committee
was held in Philadelphia following the
I. C. A. A. meet at which Maloney
presented the claims of the rugby en
thusiasts. Financial hacking of the
rugby trip had been previously withheld
because the committee was uncertain
as to the standing of rugby as an Ameri
can game. The success of the joint
Stanford-California team in Vancouver
last December was an argument which
impressed the Easterners as indicating
the high caliber playing of the Califor
nia rugbyites. By showing the interna
tional character of rugby playing, Ma
loney was able to enlist further support
among the committeemen.
The furnishing of free oceanic trans
portation by the government will elimi
nate the largest expense item of the trip.
Maloney completed arrangements in the
East which provide that the traveling
facilities be furnished by the govern
ment for the trips both to and from
Antwerp.
The campaign to raise the remaining
$10,(XX) necessary for the trip will be
continued in full force, Maloney de
clares. Acting under the suggestion of
President Kirby of the Olympic com
mittee, the drive for rugby funds will
be combined with the campaign for the
track squad; $20,000 has been set as
the sum needed to meet the expenses of
the teams of both sports. The presence
of many track stars on the rugby fif
teen and the need of raising traveling
funds within the next few weeks were
the reasons which led to the union of the
two Olympic drives.
