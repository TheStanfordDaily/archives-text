# UNIVERSITY UNION REPORT INDICATES NEW CO-OPERATION
## 
### 
President Wilbur has just received
a report of the British Division of the
American University Union in Europe
for the first quarter of 1920, which
shows the development of that enter
prise in bringing about helpful co
operation between American Univer
sities and university people with those
of the British Isles and the continent
of Europe.
The Union during the war register
ed about 35,000 college men, aided in
placing thousands in French universi
ties and 200 in British universities
and following the war has been re
constituted on a peace time basis to
further co-operative societies between
college people on both sides of the
Atlantic. It opened its opportuni
ties to women instead of restricting
them to men and has correlated its
work with the American Council of
Education, The Institute of Interna
tional Education, New York City, The
Association of American Colleges, the
American Association of Univeristy
Professors, and with university as
sociations in Great Britain and France.
It is continuing to broaden the scope
of its affiliations and the British head
quarters now serves as a clearing
house for inquiries on educational
matters that reach the embassy and
consular services and affords a means
of introduction to visiting American
teachers and students and the British
teachers and students who visit the
United States. Through its agency
American students are given tickets
of admission to libraries, collections,
and various educational bodies to
which access is more or less difficult.

tional educational movemets and Geo.
E. Mac Lean, Director of the British
Division, who makes the report, ends

clusion may I express the belief that
the Union will prove a sheet anchor
to the windward for the storm-tossed
League of Nations."
