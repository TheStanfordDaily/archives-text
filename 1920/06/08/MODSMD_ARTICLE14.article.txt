# BATHING BEAUTY APPEARS ON NEW CHAPPIE COVER
## 
### 
A three-color plate of a bathing girl
in a red bathing suit will be the garb
in which "Chappie" will appear on
Quad tomorrow. According to editor
elect "Yank" Hall, '19, this is the most
pretentious and expensive cover that
"Chappie" has worn this year. The
designer of this piece of art is John
Matthews, '21, who also designed many
of the masterpieces that appeared in
the 1921 Quad.
In conjunction with the fact that
this is a "Summer Girl" issue, many
of the contributions are by members
of the fair sex. Delia Taylor, '23, has
contributed a double central page on
the "Summer Vacation Girl." Janice
Dunker, '22, is the artist of the front
ispiece that goes with Dan Evans', '20,
opening verse "The Leading Lady."
Dorothy Plummer, '20, has contributed
a number of cartoons, one of which
is particularly clever entitled, "Som 'er
Girls."
A. T. Harzfeld, '21, offers his usual
contribution of incomparable foolish
verse. "Farm to Farm," a poem with
accompanying cartoons expresses M.
I). Flowers', '20, idea of the campus
queen in her own home town.
The best line of jokes, verses and
stories that "Chappie" has published
for some time aid in making this num
ber one of the best ever issued.
