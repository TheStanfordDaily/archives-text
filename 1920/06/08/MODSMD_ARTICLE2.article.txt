CHICAGO, JUNE B.â€”THE NINETEEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY NA
TIONAL REPUBLICAN CONVENTION WAS CALLED TO ORDER BY
CHAIRMAN WILL HAYS, AT 11:34 THIS MORNING AND THE WORK OF
SELECTING THE G. O. P. STANDARD BEARERS BEGAN. AT THE OPEN
ING OF THE GREAT CONCLAVE IT WAS GENERALLY ADMITTED THAT
THE FIGHT WAS STILL A "FREE FOR ALL" AND THAT NONE OF THE
CANDIDATES HAVE SUCCEEDED IN CAPTURING A COMMANDING
LEAD.
THE MOST IMPORTANT EVENTS OF THE FIRST SESSION WERE
SENATOR LODGE'S KEYNOTE SPEECH AND THE APPOINTMENT OF
"BIG FOUR" COMMITTEES WHfCH WILL DECIDE THE PRINCIPLES ON
WHICH THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES WILL MAKE THEIR FIGHT
FOR ELECTION.

Hays opened the convention with a
brief speech. By 11:30 every seat in
the building was occupied. Hays pre
sented the name of Lodge as tempo
rary chairman. Lodge was elected
amid great cheering.
Lodge talked several minutes be
fore he got his first response from the
crowd. Patters of hanclapping greet
ed his first thrusts at the Democratic
party. The first roar came when he
declared that the Democrats must be
driven from power. There was an
other outburst as he called Wilson un-
American. "Mr. Wilson must be put
aside" declared Lodge, frowning and
shaking his finger. In his speech he
kept close to his manuscript, from
which he deviated but slightly. His
excoriations and thrusts drew laughs
and more frequent applause.
Lodge's description of Wilson as a
"Democratic free trader of Socialistic
Tendencies" brought a big laugh.
The crowd was evidently not in
much of a hurrying mood and wanted
to hear and for the most part its at
tention was riveted on the speaker
(as he slowly, methodically, and with
out excitement or dramatic effort de

livered smash after smash at Wilson
and his regime, and told what the Re
publicans would do about domestic
questions if putin power.
Prolonged cheering met Lodge's ref
erence to the defeat of the Wilson
treaty without reservations. Allusiqn
to Wilson's request that the United
States take mandate ,over Armenia
was greeted with a laugh. Lodge con
cluded his address at 1:18 p.m.
The convention adjourned at 1:30
until tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Senator Lodge was a picture of cool
ness and self-possession when he de
livered the Republican keynote speech.
Standing directly beneath a big sound
ing board, Lodge planted himself solid
ly on his feet, scarcely shifting them
from beginning to end. His gestures
were few but effective. Occasionally
he raised his hand to emphasize a
point or shook an admonishing finger
as he referred to the Democratic ad
ministration.
He was clad in a black frock coat,
black trousers and black shoes, and
a white waistcoat spotted with tiny
black spots. His delivery was incisive.
At the start his voice was strong but
after he had spoken a half an hour it
grew a trifle husky.
