# Grass Blaze Calls Out Campus Fire Fighters
## 
### 
A large blaze north of the campus
called out a large number of campus
cars loaded with would-be firefighters
early last evening. The fire proved to
be nothing more than a land-clearing fire
on the other side of the Stanford estate
which had gotten slightly beyond control.
