# CAST OF 1920 FARCE SHOWS GOOD PROGRESS
## Eugene Nisbet, '22, Displays Rare Talent in Role of George Wimbledon 
### 
Progress of the cast of the 1920 show,
"Good Gracious, Annabelle," has been
satisfactory, according to Coach Davis
today. Rehearsals during the past week
have more than proved Coach Davis'
assertion that the cast selected is th?
best one which has been seen on the
local stage for some time. Every mem
ber is entering into a sympathetic in
terpretation of his part, which is mak
ing for a thoroughly well-rounded play.
Eugene Nisbet, 22, in the part of
George Wimbledon, is a newcomer to
Stanford dramatics, but has earned his
part in the 1920 cast through his rare
ability at interpretation of comedy roles
His lines in "Good Gracious, Annabelle,"
give him an excellent chance to exercise
this special faculty of his.
Nisbet's part presents the familiar type
of the rich waster. Wimbledon toils
not. nor does he spin, but nevertheless
his time is pretty well tilled by his spe
cialty of being constantly drunk. To
portray such a role is a considerable
strain on an actor in these dry days, and
the way that Nisbet makes his charac
ter ignore the Supreme Court decision
brings him a great deal of credit.
The Manager, Milton Bulkley, '20, is
preparing for an unusually large seat
sale, when the pasteboards go on sale
next Thursday. It is confidently ex
pected by the committee that the demand
will be greater than has ever been ex
perienced previously for a senior farce,
owing to the size of the graduating class.
