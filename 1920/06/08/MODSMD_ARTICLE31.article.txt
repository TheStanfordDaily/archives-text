# THE
						SENATOR AND THE LEAGUE
## 
### 
TIHE SENATOR FROM CALIFORNIA seems to have put himself in a rather
difficult position on the subject of the League of Nations. He is evidently
eager in fact more than eager, even accommodating, in his efforts to secure
the Republican nomination. One could hardly imagine the Senator accepting
the Lodge reservation after all that he has said about Americanism in con
nection with his opinion of the League. In fact it would rather be difficult
for him to accept tlys plank without almost making an open apology to those
people in the United States who have seen fit to stand by the League in the
face of the Senator's scathing remarks.
What the Senator really said and what he intendede to say were un
fortunately two different things and no doubt the public takes considerable
interest in just which was the truth. Unfortunately the Senator's reply was
a little trite in that he picked on an established political phrase which might
mean anything or nothing. His answer "We will cross the bridge when we
come to it" isn't going to satisfy either those delegates who are strong for
the League or those, who are against the League, a situation which neither
coasts of political gnesse or the Senator's usual sagacity. If the Senator
isn't careful, a few more nails loosened by Lodge in that plank on the League
is going to be the downfall of the Senator's little structure for the nomina
tion and California will have less chance than ever before to be put on the
map.
