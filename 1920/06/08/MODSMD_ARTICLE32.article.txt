# THE 						CHALLENGE FOR SPECIALIZATION
## 
### 
AT this time of the year the question, "What are you going to do after you
** get out of college?" and the answer is usually the same, "I don't know.
I'm looking for a job." Even men and women in the professional depart
ments are often dubious as to just exactly where they are going to get the
money with which to find the shelter and sustenance necessary to this ex
istence. Every graduating class seems to be in this predicament and one in
variably questions whose fault is this?
The University offers a curriculum as complete and varied as possible.
Under the major subject system the student was supposedly given every
opportunity to follow his own inclinations in his course of study with Bome
attempt through department requirements at specialization. Certainly nothing
more could be asked of any institution. Stanford ha√ü some of the finest
scholars this country has to offer among her faculty and we have the privil
ege of studying under these men at a very nominal rate financially speaking.
The root of the trouble seems to lie in the fact that in spite of the oft
repeated phrase that this is an age of specialization the average college
student doesn't take it to heart. He comes to the University and aimlessly
drifts through college with no definite desire for any certain line of work and
certainly no definite plan of work. In this day and age if any man or woman
expects to get anywhere in the outside world, if he isn't goint to be a ditch
digger or stevedore, he has to be highly specialized in some one line of work.
The mediocre is rapidly going by the boards. Thank Heavens, and we find
that a college education isn't such a wonderful thing as it used to be. It Is
more essential than ever before but it doesn't place you at the top of the
ladder and it doesn't offer the specialization in comparison to those who
hadn't the training, that it once did.
The time has come when if the college man is going to have an edge on
other men he is going to have to leave college with something more than
just a broad education behind him. He is going to have to plan his course
with something definite in mind and never lose sight of the goal which he
has set. This is an age of specialization and we of the college world must
moet the requirements of the age.
