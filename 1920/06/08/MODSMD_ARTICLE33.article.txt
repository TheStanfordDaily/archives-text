# NO SENIOR BALL
## 
### 
rrHE announcement that there would be no Senior Ball did not come as a
particular surprise to many of the Class of '20' who had long anticipated
that this would be the outcome of the annual discussion on the subject of the
Senior Ball. It is to be regretted, however, that the question is not to be
definitely settled this year rather than handing the question down to the
next class. Every class will contemplate a ball and it is doubtfifl if they
will give up the, idea as has been the case this time. It seems as though
there must be some common ground which the faculty and the seniors can
get together on. The fight has come down to tradition against University
ruling and it seems as though they have come to a deadlock. It is too bad
that the big function of Senior Week has to be sacrificed on the altar of
stubborness. Everybody knows that the Senior Class will have some kind of
an affair, and it is unfortunate that neither the University nor the Class can
see their way toward making the function an official part of Senior Week.
