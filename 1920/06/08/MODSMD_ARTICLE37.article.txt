SAN FRANCISCO, June B.â€”Charles 1
Stetson Wheeler, who will nominate
Hiram W. Johnson for President at the
Chicago convention, is one of the out
standing figures of the legal profession
in the West.
Often referred to as "the higgest law
yer in the West," Wheeler lias prac
ti ed extensively in California and other
Pacific Coast states. He was identified
with the Lincoln-Roosevelt movement
from the beginning and stumped the
state in support of Johnson when the
latter's slogan was"I will kick the
Southern Pacific out of Politics."
Wheeler was born in Fruitvale and
spent his boyhood days in Vacaville,
Healdsburg and Oakland. He was grad
uated from the University of California
in 1884 and spent the following two
years as a newspaper correspondent, be
coming personally acquainted with and
interviewing most of the political char
acters of that time.
, He was admitted to the bar in 1886.
Six years later he became a membei of a
leading local firm of attorneys. Tn 1902
he was appointed regent of the Universi
ty of California, and still holds that of
fice under reappointment.
Wheeler was a member of San Fran
cisco's committee of 50 for the rehabili
tation of the city after the great fire.
In 1912 Wheeler, as a delegate to the
Progressive National convention at Chi
cago, seconded the nomination of Hiram
Johnson, who was then the running ina'c
of Theodore Roosevelt on the Progres
sive ticket.
What perhaps was the largest fee ever
paid to an attorney in the West went to
Wheeler when lie won a will contest for
heirs of the late Claus Spreckcls, San
Francisco capitalist. The estate was
valued at millions of dollars. Wheeler's
fee amounted to $700,000, it was said.
