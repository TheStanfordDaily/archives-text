### 
The issue of the Harvard Alumni
Bulletin for May 1920, contains an
article on Professor Robert Edouard
Pellisier, whose death in France in
August 1917 is commemorated by ft
bronze tablet in the Stanford Memorial
Court. The article gives an account
of his life and quotes extensively from
his letters that have been collected in
a volume called "Letters from a Chas
seur a Pied: Robert Pellissier" and
mentions his "The Neo-Classic Move
ment in Spain during the 18th Cen
tury" published at Stanford. It calls
attention to the fact that two ambu
lances were sent to the front to com
memorate the affection in which ho
was held by his friends, one from the
Bridgeport State Normal School and
the other from Stanford. "At Stan
ford" the article says,"the mere an
nouncement that contributlones would
be secured was enough to secure the
requisite fund to which nobody was
asked to contribute."
iVofesoor Pellissier, born in Franco,
was graduated from the Lawrence
Scientific School at Harvard in 1904,
received his Master degree there In
1909 and after spending a year at
Stanford under a graduate fellowship
and as an instructor, returned to Har
vard und received his Ph. T). there In
1913. He rejoined the Stanford faculty
as an instructor thereupon and was
an assistant professor when the war
broke out and he took leave of absence
for military service In Franco.
