a worthy celebration of the Mayflower
tercentenary in co-operation with other
organizations in this and other coun
tries, which should be both interde
nominational and international in its

California members of the Council, the

formerly president of Occidental Col

lege, anil Charles S. Nash, until re
cently president of the Pacific School
of Religion a* Berkeley.
The Council hopes to co-ordinate all
prgrams and proposals for celebrating
the anniversary, arranging to have all
participating organizations unite in a
culminating nation-wide series of meet
ings during Thauksgiving Week. It
seeks to have schools, colleges, and
universities, bring the attention of stu
dents to the history and significance
of the Pilgrims.
In seventy of the leading cities of
the country mass meetings will be held
between November 21-28, culminating

Hall, New York City. Six representa

the spirit of sacrifice that is so neces
sary if we are to meet the new and
pressing problems of today."
