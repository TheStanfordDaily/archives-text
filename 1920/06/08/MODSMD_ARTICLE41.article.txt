# FORENSIC PROGRAM FOR FALL OUTLINED
## Interclass Debates to be Part of McClintock's New Plans 
### 
A revival of interclass debating will
be a part of the forensic program for
next year according to the plans form
ed by Coach M. L. McClintock. The
interclass contests, as well as the de
bates between the societies, will pro
vide the training necessary to the
more inexperienced speakers, and will
at the same time stimulate further
interest in forensic activities as a
whole. McClintock hopes to place de
bating at Stanford on a par with the
recognized sports by the addition of
a minor schedule to the intercollegiate
program. The new system will be
similar to the plan adopted in the in
tramural athletic program. Such po
licies have long been in effect in other
colleges where debating has been ac
corded a high rating.
A contest between two one-man
teams will probably be arranged. A
certain number of minutes will be giv
en each speaker for constructive argu
ment and a series of three or four
five-minute refutations will follow. By
means of such a contest, participating
speakers will be given valuable prac
tical experience in extemporaneous
debate. A number of contests similar
to this plan may be scheduled previ
ous to the tryouts for the Joffre de
bate.
Together with the intercollegiate
contests, the inter-class and inter-so
ciety debates scheduled for next year
will form the most extensive forensic
program prepared on the campus for
several years.
