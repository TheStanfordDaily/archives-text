# STANFORD TRACK STARS WILL ENTER OLYMPIC TRYOUTS
## Men Who Placed in East With Four More 'Card' Winners to Enter Pasadena Tryouts 
### 
Seven Stanford track stars will enter
the elimination track meet at Pasadena
the 26th of this month to bid for a
place on the American Olympic track
squad which leaves New York next
month for Antwerp, Coach Maloney an
nounced today. Caughey, Bihlman,
Kirksey, Templeton, Wells, Green, and
1 tanner will be the Cardinal representa
tives in the trial heats. None of the
Stanford men will be eliminated at the
Pasadena meet, asserts Maloney, who
bases his conclusion on an inspection of
eastern track men during his recent trip
to Philadelphia. The National Olympic
Committee inquired concerning the Car
dinal stars and urged the Stanford coach
to enter these men in the Olympic try
outs.
Success of the local track stars at
Pasadena will result in their entrance in
the final selective contest Boston July
16. The American team will sail for
Europe not later than the 20th of next
month.
Morris Kirksey will without doubt be
a member of the American team which
leaves for Antwerp during July, declares
Maloney. That Kirksey voluntarily
withdrew from the races in Philadelphia
in no way discredits him as it proved
his good judgment in riot running with
a tied muscle. The Cardinal sprinter
has worked out on the oval since return
ing from the East, showing that lie is
again in winning form. "A member of
the Olympic Committee told me that
Kirksey was the best sprinter he had
seen this year," commenced Maloney,
"and if Charlie Paddock is his superior
be would make a special trip when the
two competed."
The Olympic Committee will draw
heavily upon western athletes for sprin
ters to represent America at Antwerp,
asserts the track coach. In the dis
cus and javelin the committee will rely
upon western men. Banner is assured a
place on the American squad, as bis
throw of 190 feet of the javelin is the
lÂ»ipr record made this. year. The East
will contribute the entrants in the long
distance runs. Sprott of California and
Swan of the Oregon Aggies are the only
other coast men who have a lighting
chance to place on the Olympic squad,
according to local sport dopestcrs.
