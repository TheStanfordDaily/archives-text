CHICAGO, June 9.—New York will
be virtually solid in voting for candi
dates and party planks, Senator Wads
worth, the delegation chairman, an
nounced today.
CHICAGO, June 9.—The adamant
position of labor in defense of its
right to strike was put before the Re
publican National Convention today,
when Samuel Gompers, the aged leader
of the American Federation of Labor,
appeared before the resolutions com
mittee and presented planks that labor
urges be adopted as part of the party
platform. Gompers declared dramatic
ally that "you are not going to stop
strikers and prevent men from hav
ing hopes of better things."
CHICAGO, June 9.—Submission of
the platform to the convention by the
Resolutions Committee will probably
be delayed until after the nomina
tions are made according to the an
rouncement made this afternoon. The
committee is having difficulties in
framing several of the important
planks including the League of Na
tions. General convention rules pro
vide that nominations shall not be in
order until all four major committees
have reported but it is probable that
this will be set aside either by unanim
ous consent or upon the recommenda
tion of the Rule Committee.

CHICAGO, June 9.—The second ses
sion of the Republican National Conven
tion opened at 11 :20 t his morning. The
reports of three of the four principal
committees were unanimously accepted
and the other routine business of the
convention was quickly concluded.
As soon as the crowd realized that
there was no further business they
broke loose and lost the apathy that had
marked the first session. In response
to the yells of the vast crowd of visitors
and delegates that packed the Colise
um. Chauncey Depew of New York
started a revival and testimonial meet
ing. His speech was characterized bv
humorous stories denouncing and ridi
culing the Democratic administration.
As he talked, the restraint that had held
the delegates in check melted away and
the Coliseum echoed with the din of
their applause.
Wtien Depew finished the crowd rose
to its feet and yelled for "Uncle Joe"
Cannon, but he was not present. Sen
ator Wadsworth of New York made the
motion to adjourn an hour after the
opening of the session.
Tomorrow's session will convene at 11
o'clock. The main business to come be
fore the convention will be the report of
the Resolutions Committee, which is
framing the platform.
