# COAST COACHES SETTLE ISSUES OF CONFERENCE
## Fifty-Fifty Division Football Receipts Abolished by Last Session of Coast Conference 
### 
By abrogating the rule that net re
ceipts of football games shall be
equally divided between competing col
leges, the Pacific Athletic Conference
in its special session in Portland last
Saturday avoided any possibility of
disrupting the organization which con
ducts the athletic relations of the
major coast universities. As the fifty
fifty rule gave rise to a bitter contro
versy among the northern colleges last
fall, the Conference felt that the di
vision of the proceeds should be placed
on an entirely new basis. Apportion
ment of receipts will be made by the
different athletic managers for the
football games of next year under the
rule approved at Portland. An after
math of the conference was the adop
tion of a number of agreements among
the managers present at Portland
which made liberal guarantees to visit
ing teams in some instances in excess
of an equal division of proceeds.
In order to remove any obstacles in
the way of collegians desiring to try
out for membership on the Olympic
teams, the conference suspended the
rule which forbids university athletes
from competing under the colors of
athletic clubs. By securing the per
mission of the faculty athletic associa
tion, a college athlete may compete
in the Olympic games as a representa
tive of one of the athletic clubs which
are attempting to enroll college men
on their teams. This rule will affect
Jenne, the crack pole vaulter of Wash
ington State College, and Grant Swan,
the O. A. C. miler, who will-probably
represent the Multnomah Club of
Portland.
The conference, as a result of a
a resolution adopted at Portland, will
hereafter be represented in the meet
ings of the National Intercollegiate
Athletic Association. Although Stan
ford and other members of tha confer
ence had previously been members of
the national association, the coast or
ganization wished to be represented
as a unit in the national body.
The controversy over the training
table was decided by restricting the
use of the table to the football and
crew squads. The policy of limiting
the table to the evening meal will be
continued next year.
Greater freedom in the scheduling
of freshman football games will be
possible under the plan approved by
the conference. The rule adopted at
the Seattle meeting in December
limiting the number of freshman foot
ball games to two a season was abro
gated. In its place a provision was
approved which makes no restriction
of the number of scheduled matches
but which closes the football season
for the freshmen on the second Satur
day before Thanksgiving.
Boxing as a college activity will be
greatly stimulated as a result of the
decision of the Portland meeting, to
make the pugilistic sport a conference
activity. A new set of rules will be
formulated which will govern all
university matches. The schedule,
providing for interecollegiate compe
tition, will be announced next fall.

The controversy over the training
table was decided by restricting the
use of the table to the football and
crew squads. The policy of limiting
the table to the evening meal will be
continued next year.
Greater freedom in the scheduling
of freshman football games will be
possible under the plan approved by
the conference. The rule adopted at
the Seattle meeting in December
limiting the number of freshman foot
ball games to two a season was abro
gated. In its place a provision was
approved which makes no restriction
of the number of scheduled matches
but which closes the football season
for the freshmen on the second Satur
day before Thanksgiving.
Boxing as a college activity will be
greatly stimulated as a result of the
decision of the Portland meeting, to
make the pugilistic sport a conference
activity. A new set of rules will be
formulated which will govern all
university matches. The schedule,
providing for interecollegiate compe
tition, will be announced next fall.
