# Aid Asked Through Draft System For Starving Austrians
## 
### 
A direct appeal to Stanford fur help
m forestalling actual starvation in Aus
tria, has reached the campus. Mem
bers of* the administrative group have
written a letter, asking that immediate
lid he sent them through the food-draft
system established by Herbert Hoover.
"If each of the American universities
should donate only one food draft," says
the letter, which is signed by the presi
dent of the university, "even that would
be of very help to us. We of the
official class in the universities turn con
fklently to the Acmciran universities,
whose readiness to extent help has been
amply demonstrated, with the urgent
plea that, in their proposed gifts for re
'ief they will remember the officials of
the University of Vienna."
Warehouses of the system of the
American Relief Administration have
been established at Budapest. Hamburg,
Prague, Vienna, and Warsaw, where all
food drafts sent to the people of Aus
tria may be redeemed. The drafts, which
arc for $10 and $50 may be purchased
at American banks. Since the ware
bouses purchase at wholesale rates, and
are not interested in making profits, the
system has proved the only reliable
method of sending relief.
