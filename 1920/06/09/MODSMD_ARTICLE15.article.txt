While $812 seems at first sight to be
'an excessive amount to spend per year
:on clothes exclusively, a glance at any
clothing advertsement that quotes prices
j will show that to be clothed in modest
manner without any attempt to over
dress would necessitate the outlay of a
sum not inconsistent with the amount re
turned. The cost of shoes must be reck
oned with as one of the largest factors
in the expense list of the modern wom
an. An ordinary pair of shoes of any
standard make cannot be purchased for
less than twenty dollars. Allowing five
pairs of shoes per year there is $11X3 gone
for one item. Wash dresses of one color
were quoted last week in one of the San
Francisco stores at $54. Silk sweaters
cost not less than $50.00.
The returns from the ouestionnaire
were large, and a good derfl of variety
was found in the answers. Some few
took the question as a joke and returned
such answers as "Ask papa" or "No
body knows."
