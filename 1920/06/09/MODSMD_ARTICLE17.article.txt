# Women's Club House Closes a Financially Successful Season
## 
### 
The past year has been the most suc
cessful in the history of the Women's
Club House, both in point of finances
and in the amount of service rendered
to the University community, according
to a recent report of the Board of Di
rectors.
The Resident Alumnae teas have
brought in nearly $650 this year, which
sum has been used in improvements to
the building. But aside from the finan
cial gain, tlie directors feel that the
spirit of helpfulness manifested by both
faculty women and by those not con
nected with the University gives ample
evidence ,of the esteem in which the
Club House is held.
The directors wish to express their
appreciation and thanks to all who acted
as hostesses for these teas, and to the
women students for the benefit which
they organized for the Club House.
This netted about $185, and will be ap
plied on the discharge of the existing
debt to the University.
The building will be kept open during
the summer, and will be available when
ever needed.
The following board of directors will
serve next year: Representing the Fac
ulty Women's Club, Mrs. C. B. Whittier,
Mrs. Bailey Willis; Alumnae, Mrs. Ed
win Thomas, Miss Elizabeth Thompson,
Mrs. A. C. Whitaker, Mrs. E. P. Cub
