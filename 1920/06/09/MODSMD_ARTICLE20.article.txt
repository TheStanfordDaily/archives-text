# TOMORROW SET FOR TICKET SALE OF SENIOR FARCE
## Drawing to be Held in Front of Wilson's Compus Store; Large Demand is Expected 
### 
Seats for the Senior Farce, "Good
Gracious, Annabelle," will go on sale
at a drawing tomorrow at 1 p.m. in
front of Wilson's campus store, accord
ing to the plans of the manager, Milton
Bulkley, '20. Notices have been mailed
to all the living groups on the campus
announcing the sale, and a large line is
expected.
That those who remain over after
finals to see "Good Gracious, Annabelle"
will be amply rewarded was the con
census of opinion of all who have wit
nessed any of the rehearsals. Not only
has Coach Davis selected one of the best
casts that has ever appeared on the local
boards, but the farce itself is one which
cannot but please the most fastidious,
through its scintillating lines, and clever
ly complicated situations.
When Annabelle, played by Mona
Gardner, '20, with a husband somewhere,
suddenly finds herself without funds, and
named as co-respondent in a divorcc
trial, the fun begins. When she takes
her friends to the home of George Wim
bledon (Eugene Nisbet '22) as servants,
and then Wimbledon appears, in his usu
al condition of semi-drunkenness, Anna
belle is putin a position from which
she has no end of trouble in extricating
herself.
As no farce is complete without a
comedy character role, "Good Gracious,
Annabelle" is not without its character
part in that of the undercook at Wimble
don's, where Annabelle has suddenly
been thrown into complications. Mar
garet Shedd '20, has shown in the re
hearsals her ability in this part. Her
part is one which adds to Annabelle's
complications, and it is all that Anna
belle and John Rauson (Hawley Mertz
'20) can do to end the play in the way
in which all good comedies should be
ended.
Following the drawing for seats to
morrow, tickets will be sold at a table
in front of Wilson's from 10 a. m. to 2
p. m. every day and at Crandall's in
Palo Alto.
