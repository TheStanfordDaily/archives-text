# REPUBLICAN DENUNCIATION OF WILSON
## 
### 
fTHE OPENING OF THE G. O. P. CONVENTION yesterday furnished one of
the most dramatic political incidents which this country has seen in many
years. The election of Senator Lodge as chairman was dramatic in itself,
which was augmented by the fact that Lodge, perhaps more than any other one
republican, has played a heavy role in the politics of the nation during recent
years. One can well imagine the tenseness with which all the delegates
awaited developments and Lodge's speech probably heightened the intensity
of the convention.
All this was more or less to be expected in the opening of any conven
tion. What made the opening of the convention so peculiarly dramatic was
that the Republicans for the first time since 1912 were coming back into their
own. The reaction to Lodge's bitter attacks on Wilson and the Democratic
administration was tremendous. Lodge's slow methodical speaking brought
the cheers of a more dramatic speaker as the crowd listened with keen at
tention to every word which this veteran Republican had to offer for the
past and for the future of the party. The same men who had probably looked
with some favor on the Wilson administration but a short while ago, now
were cheering the scathing denunciation of Wilson. One cannot help but
think of the short time which has elapsed since Wilson was thought of by
many as the nation's idol and now how he has apparently lost favor even
within the ranks of his own party.
The champion of democracy, Wilson now faces the charge of a Wilson
"dynasty." Added to this came the sweeping charge "They must be driven
from office and power, not because they are Democrats but because Mr. Wil
son stands for a theory of administration and government which is not
American, his methods, his constant If indirect assaults upon tli6 constitu
tion and upon all traditions of free government, has always rested. The
return of the Democrats to power with Mr. Wilson, or one of his disciples
still the master and the leader of a great party, would be a long step in the
direction of the autocracy for which Mr. Wilson yearns and a heavy blow to
the continuance of free representative government."
How different is this picture when one contrasts it with Wilson's first
visit to France when the people worshipped him as the champion of Dem
ocracy and hailed his fourteen ponits. It is difficult to say whether Wilson
was too big a man for the American people or too small to have the vision
for our immediate foreign and domestic affairs. In either case lies a tragedy
which is peculiarly dramatic and yet so familiar in history. Any people prove
to be fickle in the mass sometimes justifiedly so and more often riot. There
is no doubt but that Wilson is keenly aware of the reaction which has set in
against him. The one hope is that with the retirement of one statesman from
public life, the Republican Convention will give to the American nation a man
with the vision and power to lead, and hold the confidence of the American
public.
