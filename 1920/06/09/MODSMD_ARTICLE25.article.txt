# THE
						SCREAM OF THE YEAR
## 
### 
CJENIOR WEEK will undobtedly be unusually attractive this year because
this is the first class, for several years, which has graduated with the
cloud of war entirely lifted from social festivities. Plans this year are more
elaborate and in keeping with the former years.
The festivities will be opened with the Senior Farce on the last night of
final examinations. The cast promises to be unusually good and all those
who are acquainted with the play can appreciate the fine lines and keen
humor which characterizes the whole plot. The seat sale will open tomor
row for the Farce and although the committee is alarmed by the number who
have made railroad reservations for that night it is to be expected that the
Farce committee will have a good house to start the week off with a boom.
In past years the Senior Farce has always been one of the big laughing
screams of the year more so than even the Sophomore Play. Everybody is
ready to laugh after finals are over and the Seniors take the chance to forget
the worries of getting the A.8., and the regret of so soon leaving the arches
of the good old Quad behind. The Farce promises to become one of the
keenest in years and the audience should back up the play.
