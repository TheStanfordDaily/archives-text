# STANFORD, ANTWERP AND RUGBY
## 
### 
(TIHE RUGBY TEAM is at last to go to Antwerp despite the refusal of the
*â–  Antwerp clock to strike. The decision of the Rugby Union in regard to
the funds to send the men overseas will be met with much enthusiasm by
those of us who still remember when Rugby was in its prime on the campus.
Many of us still think of it as one of the prettiest games ever played on a
football field with its spectcular runs and passing.
Stanford is unusually fortunate in having men who can play on the ail-
American team. It will be wonderful advertisement for the University and a
wonderful experience for the men who are to have the privilege of going.
Whn athletics reach an internatonal scale there is a certain thrill which could
never be experienced otherwise. The double knowledge that you are an
American and from Stanford would be a wonderful inspiration and it will be
with the keenest interest that we of the Farm will watch the showing which
these men will make on foreign ground.
