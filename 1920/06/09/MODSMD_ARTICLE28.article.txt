# CHILDREN OF AUSTRIA WILLS BE FED BY WELFARE WORK
## 
### 
With the withdrawal of the missions
of American administration for the
general child welfare work, comes the
announcement- that the work formerly
done by the administration will be car
ried on by national organizations which
have been built'up for this purpose.
The general child-feeding operations
of the European Child rens' Fund, which
is the outgrowth, under the direction of
Herbert Hoover, of the American Re
lief Administration, is being brought to
a close. The extreme need of the chil
dren of Austria and Poland, however,
has led to the determination to continue
the work until May 1, 1921. And the
situation in Hungary is such that lim
ited feeding under American auspices
will be continued over until September
1, of this year. In other fields, Ameri
can administration will betrin to with
draw its missions and the continuation
of the Child Relief programs will be
carried on by national organizations
which have been built up with the aid
of the Americans for the our Dose.
The determination to continue in Aus
tria was influenced by a letter of appeal
from Dr. Clemes Pirquet who has been
engaged in the work in Vienna, and the
need of further American support there
and in Poland and Hungary was sub
stantiated by the tour of careful inves
tigation recently made by Dr. Alonzo
Taylor.
The organization of the Children's
Fund in New York will be maintained
for another year although the actual op
erations in Europe will in the main prob
ably be conducted by some other organ
ization acting as distributing agents of
the European Children's Fund in the
field, very likely the American Friends'
Service Committee. The Children's
Fund will still be responsible for the
expenditures of all funds resulting
from the operations of the "Supreme
Economic Council.
At a recent meeting of the Executive
Committee of the European Children's
Fund, held in New York, financial re
ounce....riveind,tjasv,.\tarebeoaizabyl..op-t
ports showed that United States cash
donations for the period April
amounted to $27,266, and for the period
Moy 1-15, to $168,971, making a grond
total of contributions including Arme
nia, of $3,281,546. The estimate of the
cost of child feeding operations to April
30, 1920, was $17,384,200 divided into
feeding costs of $11,409,650, and cloth
ing costs of $5,974,550. Total resources
received from cash donations amounted
to $1,857,150; from remittance funds

$3,880,000 and from residue from opera
tions of the American Relief Adminis
tration of $27,787,150.
The program of the European Chil
dren's Fund as of April 1, showed the
following situation as to the total num
ber of children fed in various countries
and the time at which the various Amer
ican missions will be withdrawn:
Withdrawal Date
Country Children Fed E.C.F. Mission
Finland 90,000 June 1, 1920

Total 2,697,000

Dr. Pirquet in his letter, addressed to
Mr. Hoover, and dated at Vienna April
2, made a plea based on his own knowl
edge of the situation that the Children's
Fund continue to aid the children of
Austria for another year. He pointed
out that next Austrian harvest will not
be sufficient to carry the children fur
ther than four or five months into the
next winter, but that if the Austrians
are aided in getting through the winter
the efforts which the Austrians are now
making to establish means and methods
of child feeding based on the scientific
determination of actual needs, will en
able them after that to carry on the
work themselves. In his letter Dr. Pir
quet said, after expressing thanks for
the work that has been done and out
lining the work that has been accom
plished under Hoover's plan of educat
ing public opinion to the point where
the state and community feel a responsi
bility for child welfare and of organizing
to meet this responsibility, says:
"This whole idea is based on the sin
cere hope that you, Mr. Hoover, will
continue to keep your kindly eye on us
at least for the next year, for we can
not imagine Austria and Austria's chil
dren without your aid. We know you
are a man who knows the economic con
ditions in this part of the world and we
know you are the man who was not han
dled nor blinded by politics. We also
know you are the man who took a real
humanitarian interest in the condition
of this unhappy part of Europe. Let me
implore you for the sake of our children
not to discontinue your efforts and to
stay our true friend forever."

of child feeding based on the scientific
determination of actual needs, will en
able them after that to carry on the
work themselves. In his letter Dr. Pir
quet said, after expressing thanks for
the work that has been done and out
lining the work that has been accom
plished under Hoover's plan of educat
ing public opinion to the point where
the state and community feel a responsi
bility for child welfare and of organizing
to meet this responsibility, says:
"This whole idea is based on the sin
cere hope that you, Mr. Hoover, will
continue to keep your kindly eye on us
at least for the next year, for we can
not imagine Austria and Austria's chil
dren without your aid. We know you
are a man who knows the economic con
ditions in this part of the world and we
know you are the man who was not han
dled nor blinded by politics. We also
know you are the man who took a real
humanitarian interest in the condition
of this unhappy part of Europe. Let me
implore you for the sake of our children
not to discontinue your efforts and to
stay our true friend forever."
With the withdrawal of the missions
of American administration for the
general child welfare work, comes the
announcement- that the work formerly
done by the administration will be car
ried on by national organizations which
have been built'up for this purpose.
The general child-feeding operations
of the European Child rens' Fund, which
is the outgrowth, under the direction of
Herbert Hoover, of the American Re
lief Administration, is being brought to
a close. The extreme need of the chil
dren of Austria and Poland, however,
has led to the determination to continue
the work until May 1, 1921. And the
situation in Hungary is such that lim
ited feeding under American auspices
will be continued over until September
1, of this year. In other fields, Ameri
can administration will betrin to with
draw its missions and the continuation
of the Child Relief programs will be
carried on by national organizations
which have been built up with the aid
of the Americans for the our Dose.
The determination to continue in Aus
tria was influenced by a letter of appeal
from Dr. Clemes Pirquet who has been
engaged in the work in Vienna, and the
need of further American support there
and in Poland and Hungary was sub
stantiated by the tour of careful inves
tigation recently made by Dr. Alonzo
Taylor.
The organization of the Children's
Fund in New York will be maintained
for another year although the actual op
erations in Europe will in the main prob
ably be conducted by some other organ
ization acting as distributing agents of
the European Children's Fund in the
field, very likely the American Friends'
Service Committee. The Children's
Fund will still be responsible for the
expenditures of all funds resulting
from the operations of the "Supreme
Economic Council.

Committee of the European Children's

amounted to $27,266, and for the period

total of contributions including Arme

cost of child feeding operations to April
30, 1920, was $17,384,200 divided into
feeding costs of $11,409,650, and cloth

received from cash donations amounted
to $1,857,150; from remittance funds

$3,880,000 and from residue from opera

Dr. Pirquet in his letter, addressed to
Mr. Hoover, and dated at Vienna April
2, made a plea based on his own knowl
edge of the situation that the Children's
Fund continue to aid the children of
Austria for another year. He pointed
out that next Austrian harvest will not
be sufficient to carry the children fur
ther than four or five months into the
next winter, but that if the Austrians
are aided in getting through the winter
the efforts which the Austrians are now
making to establish means and methods
of child feeding based on the scientific

Dr. Pirquet in his letter, addressed to
Mr. Hoover, and dated at Vienna April
2, made a plea based on his own knowl
edge of the situation that the Children's
Fund continue to aid the children of
Austria for another year. He pointed
out that next Austrian harvest will not
be sufficient to carry the children fur
ther than four or five months into the
next winter, but that if the Austrians
are aided in getting through the winter
the efforts which the Austrians are now
making to establish means and methods
of child feeding based on the scientific
determination of actual needs, will en
able them after that to carry on the
work themselves. In his letter Dr. Pir
quet said, after expressing thanks for
the work that has been done and out
lining the work that has been accom
plished under Hoover's plan of educat
ing public opinion to the point where
the state and community feel a responsi
bility for child welfare and of organizing
to meet this responsibility, says:
"This whole idea is based on the sin
cere hope that you, Mr. Hoover, will
continue to keep your kindly eye on us
at least for the next year, for we can
not imagine Austria and Austria's chil
dren without your aid. We know you
are a man who knows the economic con
ditions in this part of the world and we
know you are the man who was not han
dled nor blinded by politics. We also
know you are the man who took a real
humanitarian interest in the condition
of this unhappy part of Europe. Let me
implore you for the sake of our children
not to discontinue your efforts and to
stay our true friend forever."
