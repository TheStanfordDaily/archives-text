Major E. Ormonde Power, U. S. A.,
says the most embarassing moment of
his army life was in Havana when
he was a lieutenant, in 1898. The
United States had just taken control in
Cuba and Lieutenant Power was sent
to Havana to see about taking over
some property. While in a restau
rant he saw four Cuban officers, im
maculately garbed. In true Latin
manner they rose, bowed ceremonious
ly and invited him to sit at their table.
"Sir," said one of the officers, ris
ing, "it gives us the honor very dis
tinguished to have an American of
ficer join us —to have the valiant Amer
icans in control of our country. My
feeling is so great that I beg of you
to give me the honor of accepting my
sword."
With that he whipped out his beau
tiful Toledo blade, made of a steel the
like of which no American ever pos
sessed As the young American lieu
tenant awkwardly waited the Cuban
stuck the point of his Toledo blade in
the center of the table, bent it double,
and as it whipped back into shape he
graciously handed it to Power
Feeling it up to him also to do some

thing gracious Lieutenant Power beg
ged that the Cuban accept his sword
to establish relations further. With
that he whipped out his ten-dollar
blade, bought from a department store
on the East Side in New York. Imi
tating the Cuban he stuck the point
in the middle of the table, bent it
double —and it stayed bent!
Without a tremor Lieutenant Power
calmly handed the blade, now bent like
a pretzel, to the Cuban, and made him
a sweeping bow.

In spite of the fact that she once
thought that he was a handsome hero,
a man will insist that his wife has

"Father, do you mind advancing
me my allowance for next week?"
"My dear child, I've already ad
vanced it to you." •
"All right. My allowance for the
week after will do as well!"— Judge.

editor said. That is, he got ten years
for being too handy with a pen.
