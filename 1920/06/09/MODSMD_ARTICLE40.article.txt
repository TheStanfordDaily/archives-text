COLORADO SPRINGS, June 10.â€”
"Good Railway Service, the Primary
Need of Business," was the topic of a
speech by William Sproule, president of
the Southern Pacific Company, read here
today to the fourteenth annual meeting j
of the National Wholesale Grocers' As- ;
sociation of the United States.
Commerce is the development of dis
tribution, an dfor distribution you de
pend chiefly on the railroads, said j
Sproule.
"There is at present a shortage of I
probably 225,000 freight cars alone," the \
speaker pointed out. "Without consid- I
ering the large expenditures necessary to (
increase and improve the fixed facilities
of the railroads, as must be done con
stantly to meet the growing needs of
commerce, this interest charge of $50,-
000,000 on the money required to provide
necessary equipment, appears in itself to
be a large sum. But an increase of one
cent an hour in the wages paid to the |
railroad men of the United States j
amounts to $50,000,000 a year for that i
increase in wages of one cent an hour
alone. Don't you perceive, then, the im
portance to you of having money put
into equipment and facilities for your
service at the same time that money is
disbursed in wages to the men who work
for the railroads in giving this service?"
Sproule said the tradition has not
vet died out that the railroads are owned I
and controlled by a comparatively small
number of persons of considerable
wealth.
"The day for that has gone," he said.
"The railroads are owned by great
bodies of stockholders. The road of
which I am an officer has, for example,
over 41,000 stockholders.
"When the public is satisfied with the
service the railroads prosper. When
the public is dissatisfied and critical the
railroads suffer. Naturally we want
prosperity. Give us only the means and
we will undertake to satisfy you."
