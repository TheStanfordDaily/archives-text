LAKE TAHOE, Cal., June 10.—State
Controller John S. Chambers, addressing
the California Bankers' Association con
vention here today on "The Business of
Government in the State of California,"
advocated the training of men and wom
en to fill governmental positions.
The business of government, said
Chambers, should be carried on as near
ly as practicable as the business of a
corporation.
Briefly reviewing the early financial
history of California, the speaker as
serted the state government has grown
without particular purpose or design,
like Topsy.
What was needed, he declared, was
reorganiation, the simplification of gov
ernmental machinery. This would mean,
he said, the elimination of useless units
and consolidation of others in natural
groups. He asserted the state of Cali
fornia could save fully $1,000,000 along
lines of simplification.
Chambers suggested as practical reme
dies uniform accounting as between cit
ies, as between counties, and he hoped
some (lay between the states; also an
expenditure limitation law applied not
only to counties but to cities and to the
state government.
"The people, governors and legisla
tures," declared the controller, "should
go very slowly in the matter of assuming
new functions, new obligations.* The
time has come to reorganie and simpli
fy. This would mean that many pro
posals or objects would not be worthy,
but it would mean that a government,
like an individual, should go according
to its purse. There is a disposition, too,
to take on fads and fancies, frills and
fluting; to give money to this unfortu
nate class and that unfortunate, but we
should remember that among unfor
tunate classes worthy of due consider
ation were the taxpayers themselves."
