# HAWAIIAN CHAMPIONS SWIM IN EXHIBITION
## Inter – Fraternity Swimming Championship Won by Delta Tau Delta 
### 
With an exhibition by seven world
champion swimmers and a closely con
tested fraternity swimming meet the
biggest day in the aquatic history of
Stanford, was successfully conducted
in the Encina pool yesterday before a
crowd of eleven hundred spectators.
Although the plunge for distance is
still to be run off before the completion
of results in the inter-fraternity swim,
the Delta Tau Delta team have estab
lished a lead of seven points over the
Sigma Chi's with a total of twenty-five
and have put the mdet on ice, for hon
ors in the plunge will undoubtedly go
to Mills of the Alpha Sigma Phi house,
thus splitting the Sigma Chi points in
this last event.
Among the champions were Duke
Kahanamoku who swam an exhibition
hundred with Pau Keololm and a one
lap distance, with the foot stroke only,
in the time of 20:2 seconds; "Stubby"
Ivreuger and Warren Kealoho, present
world's back-stroke champion, who
went over the hundred yard course
in the back stroke; "Ludy" Danger
and W. Harris, Philippine middle-dis
tance champion, who swam a 300-yard
race; and Norman Ross who negoti
ated the 220 1 yard distance in 2:27:2.
None of the visitors exerted themselv
es but their form and movements
through the water was almost perfect.
The first event of the day was the
inter-fraternity relay won by Delta
Tau Delta whose team was composed
of Harry Austin, M. P. Davidson, A.
■istin, and M. Howell. The Sigma
Chi's, Chi Psi's, and Alpha Sigma Phi's
finished in the order named. One of
the best races of the meet was the
fifty yards in which artheur and Har
ry Austin barely nosed out Macconel
at the tape. The diving honors went
to Pinkston, Phi Kappa Psi, and God
dard, Alpha Sigma Phi. Young, Sigma
Chi, won the hundred yard race and
Mills, Alpha Sigma Phi. had no troub
le in crossing the line first in the 220.
The meet was closely contested
throughout and was the most success
ful ever held.
