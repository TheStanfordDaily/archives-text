# RESERVATIONISTS ARE BEATEN IN SUBCOMMITTEE
## Johnson's Defeat Presaged by Crane's Move; Convention Adjourns After 14 Minutes 
### United Press Hugh Baillie L.C. Martin 
CHICAGO, June 10.—Subcommittee
of the Resolutions Committee has un
animously adopted a treaty plans for
the Republicai National Platform. The
plank provides a condemnation of the
Treaty and League of Nations in their
present form, and the condemnation
of Senators who voted to defeat the
pact and covenant as presented by Wil
son... A statement in effect claims that
any agreement with a foreign nation
must conform with American ideas
and with the policies of Washington
and Monroe. A statement favoring
the principle of an international court
to settle disputes between nations was
included.

CHICAGO, Tune 10.—Over the pro
tests of six dissenting committeemen,
the resolutions committee voted to re
cess today until 1 p. m., to give the sub
committee which is drafting the plat
form, to complete the League of Nations
and Mexican planks.

CHICAGO, June 10.—The Republic
an Convention met for fourteen minutes
today. It then recessed to give the res
olutions committee time to go over the
platform draft as prepared by the sub
committee and to agree on it.
Senator McCormick, representing the
Resolutions Committee, appeared beside
Chairman Lodge on the rostrum and de
livered a lyessape from the committee,
saying that the subcommittee had reached
an agreement, including a League of Na
tions plank. He asked for adjournment
until 4 o'clock. There was loud objec
tion to such course, and when Lodge
called for a yea and nay vote the shout
of "N" was much louder than that of
"Aye," but it was apparent spectators
were joining in voting for "No" when a
rising vote was called for, and the mo
tion easily was carried.
Addressing the convention, McCor
mick said:
"Members of the Committee of the
Whole will consider the draft line bv
line and will have an opportunity to
offer amendments."

(United Press Staff Correspondent.)
When the full resolutions committee
going over the draft of the sub-com
mittee reached the labor plank this
afternoon, they decided to pass it over
and clear up the uncontested planks,
a substitute labor plang, which Borah
says he thinks means compulsory ar
bitration, has been placed before the
committee. Senator Smoot said that
he did not think that there was any
chance of getting the platform ready
for the convention by 4 o'clock.
CHICAGO, June 10.—A surrender by
the reservationist forces was headed by
Senator Murray Crane of Massachu
setts suddenly changed the aspect of the
fight in the Resolutions Committee over
the treaty plank, and in the opinion of
party leaders greatly reduced the danger
of a contest on the floor of the conven
tion. The Crane forces in the subcom
mittee Resolutions Committee agreed to
a plank which omitted the thing for
which they have been battling—an af
firmative declaration for ratification of
the peace treaty with reservations.
The reservationists were given conces
sions by the Borah and Johnson group of
"bitter enders" in the matter of phrase
ology, but Borah declared that the prin
ciple of no affirmation in favor of rati
fication had been conceded. Some politi
cal observers pointed out that the appar
ent defeat of reservationists may have
been a strategic move on the part of
the Crane group to get the foreign re
lations plank onto the convention floor in
its present form and that an overwhelm
ing defeat of it would thus practically
eliminate Johnson as a candidate.

until 4 o'clock. There was loud objec
tion to such course, and when Lodge
called for a yea and nay vote the shout
of "N" was much louder than that of
"Aye," but it was apparent spectators
were joining in voting for "No" when a
rising vote was called for, and the mo
tion easily was carried.
Addressing the convention, McCor
mick said:
"Members of the Committee of the
Whole will consider the draft line bv

offer amendments."

When the full resolutions committee
going over the draft of the sub-com
mittee reached the labor plank this
afternoon, they decided to pass it over
and clear up the uncontested planks,
a substitute labor plang, which Borah
says he thinks means compulsory ar
bitration, has been placed before the
committee. Senator Smoot said that
he did not think that there was any
chance of getting the platform ready
for the convention by 4 o'clock.
CHICAGO, June 10.—A surrender by
the reservationist forces was headed by
Senator Murray Crane of Massachu
setts suddenly changed the aspect of the
fight in the Resolutions Committee over
the treaty plank, and in the opinion of
party leaders greatly reduced the danger
of a contest on the floor of the conven
tion. The Crane forces in the subcom
mittee Resolutions Committee agreed to
a plank which omitted the thing for
which they have been battling—an af
firmative declaration for ratification of
the peace treaty with reservations.
The reservationists were given conces
sions by the Borah and Johnson group of
"bitter enders" in the matter of phrase
ology, but Borah declared that the prin
ciple of no affirmation in favor of rati
fication had been conceded. Some politi
cal observers pointed out that the appar
ent defeat of reservationists may have
been a strategic move on the part of
the Crane group to get the foreign re
lations plank onto the convention floor in
its present form and that an overwhelm
ing defeat of it would thus practically
eliminate Johnson as a candidate.
CHICAGO, June 10.—Subcommittee
of the Resolutions Committee has un
animously adopted a treaty plans for
the Republicai National Platform. The
plank provides a condemnation of the
Treaty and League of Nations in their
present form, and the condemnation
of Senators who voted to defeat the
pact and covenant as presented by Wil
son... A statement in effect claims that
any agreement with a foreign nation
must conform with American ideas
and with the policies of Washington
and Monroe. A statement favoring
the principle of an international court
to settle disputes between nations was
included.

CHICAGO, Tune 10.—Over the pro
tests of six dissenting committeemen,
the resolutions committee voted to re
cess today until 1 p. m., to give the sub
committee which is drafting the plat
form, to complete the League of Nations
and Mexican planks.

CHICAGO, June 10.—The Republic
an Convention met for fourteen minutes
today. It then recessed to give the res
olutions committee time to go over the
platform draft as prepared by the sub
committee and to agree on it.
Senator McCormick, representing the
Resolutions Committee, appeared beside
Chairman Lodge on the rostrum and de
livered a lyessape from the committee,
saying that the subcommittee had reached
an agreement, including a League of Na
tions plank. He asked for adjournment
