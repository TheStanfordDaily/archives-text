# Men's Council Advise Co-Ed Boathouse be Left to Women's Use
## 
### 
At the last regular meeting of the
Men's Student Council held last niglit
it was moved that the attention of all
men students be called to the fact that
the women's boathouse at the lake is for
the exclusive use of the women at the
University.
The rule forbidding social events on
Sunday has again been infringed and
emphasis was laid on the fact that this
rule applies to any form of informal
house dances at all times and must be
strictly adhered to or action would be
taken by the council.
