# SENIORS SLOW TO RESPOND TO ENDOWMENT SCHEME OF CLASS
## 
### 
With June 19 set as the closing date
of the Senior Endowment campaign,
seven days remain in which to raise
the total from approximately $6,000 to
the chosen goal of $60,000. The senior
class endowment committee officials
today evidenced surprise at the appar
ently lethargy and lack of response
towards the drive on part of the class
members.
"The seniors do not seem to realize
that only one week remains and that
a policy cannot be written off-hand.
After the actual papers are signed, a
physical examination must be taken
at Dr. Reynolds' office, and even after
that sufficient time must be given the
Equitable Association in which to ac
cept or reject the risk.
"The class of 1920> has been given
an unparalleled opportunity to show
its loyalty to Stanford in a material
way. but so far after a three week
drive, not more than $6,000 has peen
pledged, only ten per cent of our
quota."

In discussing the policies already
wirtten, officials stated that, with the
exception of members of the actual
endowment committee, not a single
woman claps member has done her
share towards making the drive a suc
cess. Seventeen out of twenty policies
have been taken by men.

pledged themselves to the endowment
