# CONFERENCE BARS PROFESSIONALISM FROM BIG SCRAP
## 
### 
"No professionalism will mar the
management of the West vs. East foot
ball gome next New Year," declared
Dr. A. D. Browne, this morning, bas
ing his assertion on the rules adopted
by the Pacific Athletic Conference
last Saturday at Portland. Changes
were made in the conference rulings
which govern the big championship
scrap that will enable the western
team participating to exercise a voice
in managing the game
The wording of the rules adopted
by the Seattle conference in December
left doubt as the place in which the
big game would be staged. The Rose
Tournament Committee, has previous
ly managed the East vs. West fight
and is anxious that the 1921 game be
played at Pasadena. Under the ruling
of the Portland conference the request
of the tournament committee will be
granted onlv on condition that the ex
penses and management be so clearly
defined that the purely commercial
interests will be barred from conduct
ing the game. Dr. Lynch of the Uni
versity of California will confer with
(lie tournament committee within the
next two weeks and arrange the rules
which will govern the contest next
year.
Changes were made in the structure
of the Pacific Athletic Conference at
the Portland meeting, that will expe
dite the future deliberations of that
body. Two advisory groups, a coach
es' and a managers' committee, were
croated, to formulate plans pertaining
to their work and advise the confer
ence what future policies should be
adopted. Every coach in the six uni
versities forming the conference will
become "ex-ollicio" a member of the
coaches' committee. The managers'
group will be composed of the gradu
ate managers of the six colleges. Al
though the two committees will have
power to initiate plans, the confer
ence retains the legislative power to
determine whether the proposal will
be approved or vetoed.
