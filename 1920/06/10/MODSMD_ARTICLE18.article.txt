# MUSIC FOR "OTHER EYES" IS WRITTEN BY C.W. MIDGLEY
## Local Author Composes Song for Use in "Good Gracious Annabelle" to be Published 
### 
When the music for "Other Eyes,"
the song which Annabelle sings to
Wimbledon in "Good Gracious, Anna
belle" failed to arrive with the manu
script of the play, Coach Davis found
himself in a difficult position. How
ever, C. W. Midgely, '23, has solved
the difficulty by writing a new piece
especially for the 1920 show. The
words were written by the author,
Claire Kummer, and the song con
tains three verses. Midgely's work
is well known on the campus, through
a number of the song hits which he
wrote for this year's Junior Opera.
After the local production of "Good
Gracious, Annabelle," the music will
be sent east for publication. In this
way Stanford audiences will have the
first chance to hear this song.
Two shares of mining stock hold the
keynote to the situation in which this
song is involved. The control of a
rich company hinges upon these two
shares, and the means which Anna
belle employs to get them are not only
drastic but unusual. It is in this
scene that Annabelle sings to Wimble
don "Other Eyes."
Coach Davis is enthusiastic over the
music which Midgely has written, and
predicts that it will make a decided
hit with the audience when "Good
Gracious Annabelle" is produced next
Thursday night.
The new scenery which has been
ordered by the 1920 class for this
play is beginning to arrive, and will
be finished in ample time for the pre
sentation, June 17, according to the
expectations of Milton Bulkley, '20,
who is managing the production. The
Owing to the fact that Wilson's and
the Bookstore find themselves unable
to continue the sale of tickets, Bulkley
has arranged for their sale at a table
near the Engineering corner every day
from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.
