# OIL PAINTINGS ARE SHOWN AT GALLERY
## 
### 
The best of modern American oil
painting is shown in the exhibition of
Contemporary Artists at the Art Gallery
this month. The exhibition is under the
auspices of the American Federation of
Arts, of which Stanford is a member,
and includes three groups: the National
Academy, Philadelphia, and Boston. A
number of the paintings are portraits.
The most striking of these is "Beatrice."
bv Frederick G. Hall. It is a realistic
study in black and white. Of a different,
more modern style, are the three por
traits, "The White Sunshade." by Ar
thur P. Spear. "The Mother," by Edith
M. Prellwitz, and "Feather Fan," by Ed
mund Greaccn. These are less minute
studies with more atmosphere. The ef
fect of bright sunlight is found in the
first of these, and in "Scituate Marshes,"
by Lillia Cabot Perry.
"Noonday Sunlight" is a typical Chas.
Curran painting with three girls on a
hill in the bright sun and wind. "Gene
vieve" is an excellent painting of a
mother and child. Thornton Oakley,
whose etchings were exhibited at Stan
ford at the beginning of last fall, contrib
utes a symbolic painting of industry en
titled "Work." -
In addition to the portraits there are
many landscapes. A most decorative
picture is one of Frank M. Moore, "Au
tumn Breezes.' Several winter scenes
by Fred Wagner, Harry F. Waltman,
and Paul King are realistic. The two
paintings which seem to show the most
imagination and have atmosphere are
"Greenwich Hills." by Leonard Ochtman
and "Wet Day" by Morris Hall Pan
coast. The colors and technique of these
paintings makes them interesting and ap
pealing.
One of the best paintings exhibited is
' Blue-eyed Dutchman," by Leopold Seyf
fert. It is an excellent example of style
suited to tlie subject.
This exhibition with that of the Jap
anese artist, Kainan Shimada, will last
until July 1.
