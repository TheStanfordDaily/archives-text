# "UNAPPRECIATIVE YOUOG HOPEFULS"
## 
### 
pHAPPIE'S first editorial of. this last issue hit the Senior Class pretty square
ly when it spoke about "another generation of unappreciative young hope
fuls." There are a good many In the Senior Class who are far from "patrolling
the sidewalks for a plate of bean soup" who ought to come through gener
ously for the Senior Endowment Fund, the biggest thing which has ever come
to any class in the way of doing something for the University before they
leave. And they aren't doing it. The man or woman who has to plan for
every penny generally comes through BIG and it is just a question of getting
the others started.
You of the Class of 1920 through the efforts of a few interested alumnae
and members of the Class have had one of the finest opportunities offered
you which any class could have the privilege of accepting. This is the
Senior Endowment Fund. SO FAR YOU HAVE FAILED. The matter was
thoroughly discussed before a small class meeting. Every possible effort
has been made to put this before you through publicity and yet you have
not responded as you should. The alumnae of Stanford are looking toward
you with interest wondering if for the second time the endowment fund
is going to fail. They stand ready to back us if we ourselves come through
but they will turn aside with a shrug if you fail.
The endowment policies are offered at a small premium if you don't feel
that you can take a larger one. Ten dollars a year is a very small amount
to give toward th University in appreciation of all that she has done for
you. It is a pitifully small amount and yet you haven't even seen your way
clear to give this.
Stanford needs endowment. It needs the closer contact with
its alumni which the endowment plan will bring. The first classes
made possible this University when the early days were largely
hardships. Are you going to fail their faith in the future genera
tions to stand loyally by their Alma Mater? The opportunity is
here. It is yours. Take out you policies at once. Mrs. Martin
sen and one of the committee are at the Bookstore every day
between three and four o'clock. The Class made the decisionâ€”
new back it up by action.
