# THE 						SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ELECTION
## 
### 
rTHE RECENT QUAD ELECTION was particularly gratifying because it
indicated so well the revived interest in student body affairs. The two
elections on Friday and yesterday polled a heavier vote than has ever been
seen on Quad before, which is more than pleasing, in the view of the fact
that so much has been said about what the campus "ought" to do. Certainly
nothing could be mare "constructive" than getting out and showing a little
interest in whether Tom, Dick, or Harry is student body president of the rep
resentative on the executive committee. The Daily Palo Alto hopes that
the good work is to be kept up so that the cry that Stanford is entirely run
by politics may become a little fainter by the mere fact that the political
gangs are run by the voters and the voters not run by the political gang.
