# NEW SCHEME REORGANIZES ALL STANFORD DRAMATICS
## 
### 
Reorganization of Stanford's dram
atic- organizations as contemplated by
Sword and Sandals Society was ac
cepted by the Executive Committee
at its last meeting. The plan
submitted by the Society provides for
the establishment of a general govern
ing body for the supervision of dram
atic productions and interests, which
shall be known as the Stanford Dram
atic Council.
The new plan further provides that
the membership of the Dramatic Coun
cil shall consist of one representative 1
from each of the following: English
Club, Masquers Society, Ram's Head
Society, Sword and Sandals Society,
Senior Class, Junior Class and Sopho
more Class.
Other members will be the Faculty
Dramatic Coach and a business man
ager to be selected by the other mem
bers ot the Council. Applications for
further membership will be referred
i to the Council.
In order to retain membership in
I the council, each organization must
i give at least one production each year,
j An advantage in membership is that
no rental will be charged member or
ganizations for the use of the stage
equipment. Outside organizations will
be charged the rates now asked by the
j Sword and Sandals Society. Funds
taken in through this source will be
payable to the treasury of the Dram
atic Council.
The power of the new organization
will include all plans for the expendi
ture of funds in improving the stage
and its equipment; the purchase or
lease of new stage equipment; the
employment of a business manager;
the right to apportion dates, subject
to the approval of the Executive Coun
cil, anil the right to settle all matters
of dispute among producing organiza
tions. Neither >(he dictation of (he
policy of any producing organization
nor the selection of any play or play
ers will be included in the powers of
the Council.
The expenditures of the organiza
tion are to be financed by a fund
maintained by a tax on productions.
The tav will consist of twenty per cent
of the gross receipt from any produc
tion using the faculty coach, or of five
per cent of the gross receipts of any
production not using the coach. The
latter includes the Junior Opera, and
Ram Head productions.
! Handling of financial affairs will be
j included in the duties of the business

manager. His powers are to include
the keeping of all accounts of labor
for all productions; the keeping of
accounts with merchants for supplies
and materials used in any production,
and the handling of all business mat
tors formerly in the hands of the in
dividuals who acted in that capacity
for individual performances, such as J
the arrangement for seat sales and ad
vertising. The services of the busi
ness manger will be free to organiza
tion* holding membership in the Dram-j
atic Council. The plans further pro
vide lor a nominal salary to be paid
the manager. His term of office will
extend from October until June for!
each college year, unless the Council
sees fit to dispense with his services
Stage property now owned by Sword
and Sandals Society will be turned
over to the Dramatic Council. The
exchange of property is to be made
under a lease, the terms of which will
be one dollar per year. Ot is esti
mated that the value of the equipment
now in the hands of the society is ap
proximately $5000.
One of the chief advantages of the
new plan will be the great saving
which the appointment of one business
manager will make. Rental of stage
property, making of contracts, and
supervision of financial matters, under
the direction of one man will result in
increased efficiency and economy. The
organization will gain by means of
the adoption of the new plan, the ser
vices of the faculty coach, a free hall,
and the free services of the business
manager, amounting to $200, $35, and
front $.Â°5 to $50, respectively, totaling
a gain of from $260 to $285.
The percentage claimed by the coun
cil on the average house will amount
to about $140.
Appointment of members by classes,
transfer of property, and tlie drafting
of the by-laws and the constitution
will be the early part of the program
outlined for the fall quarter of next
year.
