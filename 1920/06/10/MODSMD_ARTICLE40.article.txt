R. E. Hackley, head of the San Mateo
County Mosquito Abatement District,
lias submitted the following to the Daily
Palo Alto. It has been approved by
Professor 1 heodore Hoover and Pro
fessor Doane:
A recent editorial in the women's edi
tion of the Daily Palo Alto stated that
Lagunita was menacing the health of
campus residents because of inalaria
•carrying mosquitoes being very prevalent
there, several students having been iil
'ns a result of their bites.
As the article referred to might easily
cause much concern to those not familiar
with the real facts, we wish to call at
tention to the facts as they actually are
at present.
Anopheline mosquitoes are very rari
in this valley and because Lagunita is
well stocked with the minnows that feed
on mosquito larvae, no mosquitoes have
ever been found breeding in this lake.
Malaria can not be contracted by
breathing the air of swamps or bathing
in or drinking impure water. It is onl>
acquired from the bite of an Anophelini
mosquito which has previously bitten
some one who had malaria.
The few mosquitoeS that appeared
about the lake this summer came prin
cipally from an overflow due to a leak
in the bank of the lake. This water
spread out through the grass and sonu
mosquitoes emerged before the water
could be drawn down. They did not
breed in the lake itself, and they were
not of the malarial variety which only
can carry the malarial parasite.
In the past, 90 per cent of the mos
quito infestation of this vicinity was due
to insects bred upon the marshes of San
Francisco Bay. Owing to the work of
the Mosquito Abatement District operat
ing in San Mateo county and the Mata
dero Mosquito Abatement District in
this county, this salt marsh variety has
been almost completely suppressed. But
there still remain some breeding places
of the fresh-water varieties. These may
be such insignificant places as old cans
in a neglected corner of the garden, or,
as actually observed not long ago, a vase
on the front porch. In short, any ex
posed receptacle in which water stands
undisturbed for ten days or more, may
breed mosquitoes.
Santa Clara Valley has long been
known as a place that is free from ma
laria. We mean by this that no one
has ever contracted malaria in this val
ley because the few Anopheline mos
quitoes that are here have never become
infected with the malarial parasite. The
only cases of malaria that are found
here are cases that are definitely known
to have had their origin elsewhere.
All the doctors in this vicinity have
been interviewed in regard to the matter.
The medical advisers of the Univer
sity have no knowledge of malaria cases
on the campus and the local Palo Alto
physicians have only had a few cases,
none of which were of local origin.

mosquito which has previously bitten
some one who had malaria.
The few mosquitoeS that appeared
about the lake this summer came prin
cipally from an overflow due to a leak
in the bank of the lake. This water
spread out through the grass and sonu
mosquitoes emerged before the water
could be drawn down. They did not
breed in the lake itself, and they were
not of the malarial variety which only
can carry the malarial parasite.
In the past, 90 per cent of the mos
quito infestation of this vicinity was due
to insects bred upon the marshes of San
Francisco Bay. Owing to the work of
the Mosquito Abatement District operat
ing in San Mateo county and the Mata
dero Mosquito Abatement District in
this county, this salt marsh variety has
been almost completely suppressed. But
there still remain some breeding places
of the fresh-water varieties. These may
be such insignificant places as old cans
in a neglected corner of the garden, or,
as actually observed not long ago, a vase
on the front porch. In short, any ex
posed receptacle in which water stands
undisturbed for ten days or more, may
breed mosquitoes.
Santa Clara Valley has long been
known as a place that is free from ma
laria. We mean by this that no one
has ever contracted malaria in this val
ley because the few Anopheline mos
quitoes that are here have never become
infected with the malarial parasite. The
only cases of malaria that are found
here are cases that are definitely known
to have had their origin elsewhere.
All the doctors in this vicinity have
been interviewed in regard to the matter.
The medical advisers of the Univer
sity have no knowledge of malaria cases
on the campus and the local Palo Alto
physicians have only had a few cases,
none of which were of local origin.
