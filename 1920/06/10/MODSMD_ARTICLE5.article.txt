# SENIORS ARE URGED TO SIGN CLASS ROLL
## 
### 
Seniors may now sign the class roll
that is to be used in connection with the
ceremonies contingent with laying the
plate on the inner quad by the Class of
1920. Signatures will be taken at the
Registrar's Office until the end of the
quarter. Members of the Senior Class
should present a receipt for class dues,
or they may pay their dues at the Regis
trar's Office when signing the roll.
It has always been customary in the
past to pay Senior dues before signing
the roll, and this practice will be fol
lowed this year by the committee in
charge of arrangements incidental to the
laying of the plate.
