# "GOOD GRACIOUS ANNABELLE" TO BE STAGED THURSDAY
## Scenery, Costumes and Talent of Cast Make for Finished Production, Says the Coach 
### 
As the final curtain is towered on
scholastic work for this year, it will
be raised for the first event of Senior
Week, "Goodness Gracious, Annabelle."
Coach f)avis' predictions that the cast
and play are the best that, have been
seen on the local stage in a good
many years have been fully justified
in recent rehearsals. When Davis
rings up the curtain Thursday night,
the cast will be prepared to give a
finished production.
R. C. Alexander, '21, who has been
putin charge of the designing of the
new scenery has been working day
and night in an effort to produce a
number of new effects, which are near
ly completed. The designs which he
has executed give every promise of
surpassing his former efforts along
this line.
Hawley Mertz, '20, in the role of the
Western mlna owner who has acquired
a fortune and has come to Long Island
in search of the missing two shares
of stock, takes the part with a breezy
absence of self-consciousness which
makes John Rauson stand out in the
minds of the audience. In the wooing
and winning of Annabelle (Mona
Gardner, '20), Rauson faces more dif
ficulties than the average man, and
when Wimbledon, the Eastern million
aire finally corrals the missing stock
it seems as though Rauson has lost
Instead of won.
Margaret Sliedd, '20, in the part of
Lottie, an undercook at Wimbledon's,
displays more than her usual ability.
It Is a character part of the most dif
ficult type, and Miss Shedd has easily
earned her part through her clever
interpretation of It. In the part of
James Ludgate, a servant in Wimble
don's house, T. R. Carskadon, '22, fur
nished a good deal of amusement.
The plot of "Good Gravlous, Anna
belle" Is woven about two shares of
stock, a kitchen, and by no means
last, Annabelle, herself, it Is in form,
merely a romantic farce, depending
for its comedy situations on the clever
ness of the lines. It has attracted
nothing but favorable criticism where
ever It has appeared, and has done
more than Its share to raise the
author, Cralre Hummer, in the esteem
of play producers throughout the coun
try. Coach Davis' assertion that the
cast is one of the best in year, as
sures local theatre goers that they will
not be disappointed in remaining over
to see this last production of the year.
