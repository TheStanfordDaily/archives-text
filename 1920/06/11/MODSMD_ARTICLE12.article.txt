# NO SUMMER "DAILY" WILL BE PUBLISHED
## 
### 
No Daily paper will be published on
the Stanford Campus during the sum
mer quarter, according to announce
ment this morning. This statement
from the Registrar's Office indicates
that the registration this summer will
not be up to the normal and the de
mand for the Daily Palo Alto will be
correspondingly slight. In view of the
financial difficulties in the way of
putting out the paper only once or
twice a week and its detrimental effect
on fall advertising, it was decided to
suspend publication entirely for the
summer months.
