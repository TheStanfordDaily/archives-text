# TRUSTEES PRAISE ENDOWMENT FUND
## Lloyd Dinkelspiel, 20, Writes Letter to Fund Chairman Pledging $500 for Move 
### 
Two important events featured yes
terday's Senior Endowment campaign.
The first of these was a communica
tion from the University Board of
Trustees, headed by W. Mayo New
hall, as president, to Chairman Clar
ence J. Tanzer of the Endowment Com
mittee, enclosing a resolution of praise
passed by the Board in recognition of
the services rendered the university
by the class of 1920 in its establish
ment of the first Stanford endowment.
The communication in full is as fol
lows :
The Board of Trustees, Leland
Stanford Jr. University, June 4,
1920: Dear Sir: —You will please
be advised that in recognition of
the activities of your Class, the
following resolution was unanim
ously adopted by the Board of
Trustees at its meeting on Friday,
May 28, 1920:
"RESOLVED, That the act of
the Class of 1920 in undertaking
to provide substantial endowment
for the University, be and here
by is highly commended and fully
appreciated as a loyal Stanford
Spirit.
Co-operation and assistance is
welcomed by the Board of Trus
tees in its administration of the
of the University in behalf
of the public, the sons and daugh
ters of Stanford, and those follow
ing them."
Very sincerely yours,
W. MAYO NEWHALL,
President Board of Trustees.
Secondly, from far away Harvard
came a cry of loyalty to Stanford on
the part of Lloyd W. Dinkelspiel. who.
to quote himself, is still a member of
good old '20 class, although at pres
ent attending the Cambridge institu
tion. Dinkelspiel, former Daily Palo
Alto editor and track star, pledged
himself to assume a $500 share of the
'•esponsibility undertaken by the
Seniors in their endowment campaign
for $60,000. He says in part:
In reading the D. P. A. this even
ing, I ran across a list of sub
scriptions to the Senior Endow
ment Fund. Don't forget, I'm still
a member of that '20 class, and
am coming back to the Farm this
summer in the hopes of acquir
ing a degree.
I don't seo why you shouldn't
stick me for one of those policies,
and for fear that you are bash
ful or entirely forgetful of my ex
istence and Stanford affiliation,
I am forced to offer to be stuck
for a $500 policy. Please let me
know some of the details, includ
ing data as to payment, for my
present knowledge of the whole
plan is only that it is a good one!
In regard to the letter, Tauzer said:
"I don't understand why Stanford stu
dents who are as far away as "Dink"
are putting their whole hearts into the
plan, while, with only a very few
days remaining to us, the Stanford
members of our class are still fatally
slow in responding."
