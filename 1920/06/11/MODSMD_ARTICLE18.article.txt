# HOOVER PLACED BEFORE G.O.P.
## Wood and Lowden Score Cheers; Johnson Hissed 
### Hugh Baillie, United Press Staff Correspondent 
COLISEUM, CHICAGO, June 11.â€”The Republican Convention plunged Into
the business of nominating a candidate for President. At 10 o'clock today
Senator Lorge called for nominations and Governor Allen of Kansas, came
forward to nominate General Wood. As Allen concluded an emphathetic
speech demanding Wood's nomination, a mighty yell went up and repeated
blasts from horns sounded. Allen's nomination of Wood provoked a demon
stration which lasted thirey-seven minutes.
Congressman Rodenberg then made a speech nominating Lowden. When
the address ended, a rousing demonstration for Lowden broke loose which
lasted forty minutes, exceeding Wood's by three minutes.

Next Charles Wheeler of California,
delivered a speech nominating Hiram
Johnson. The preliminary mention
of Johnson's name brought forth only
a modest and short-lived cheer. The
quotation from Lincoln concerning the
"Government of the people, for the
people and by the people" brought the
first blast of applause.
When he said Johnson had won
great victories without big financial
backing there was a chorus of laughs,
boos, and hisses. It was the first evi
dence of open animus displayed to
wards any of the candidates named by
delegates from the floor. The crowd
renewed its calls and laughter, and
Wheeler was again forced to cease
speaking. The chairman was com
pelled to intercede, urging the dele
gates to be quiet saying he hoped lie
wouldn't have to use the gavel again.
There was more laughter at this.
Wheeler smiled saying: "The present
speaker takes these interruptions with
good humor." Wheeler's display of
good sportsmanship won him a good
round of applause. When Wheeler
said, "Newspaper publicity is valuable
but there are other means through
which the people can learn of the men

j God ordained to be their leaders" the
crowd half cheered. Then someone
in the gallery cried "Hearst." Con
vention roared with laughter at this
jibe.
The speaker adopted a somewhat
singsong tone. His voice weakened
when Wheeler said that there were
three bankers in the California dele
gation, renewed laughs swept the hall,
finally growing into general confusion.
The delegates were evidently getting
back at the speaker for his reference
to the financial backing of the other
nomination contenders. There were
cheers when Wheeler announced he
was nearing a close. Deviating from
the text of his address he leaned over,
shook his finger at the crowd, and
shouted. "Yes, hear, uncock your pre
judiced ears and bear for this first
time in your lives what this man
stands for. The time has come to
drive the bosses from this temple of
Republicanism." Hoots and jeers from
the delegates were the response. A
Johnson demonstration began the vo
lume of cheering, but it did not com
pare with the noise that greeted the
names and Lowden and Wood. It
only lasted for twenty-eight minutes.
