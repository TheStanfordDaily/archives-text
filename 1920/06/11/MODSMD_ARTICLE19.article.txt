# JAMMED LOBBIES GREET DELEGATES
## Scott Calhoun, 95, Gives Sidelights on the Monster Republican N. Convention 
### Scott Calhoun, '95 
I spent an interesting day in Chi
cago last Sunday, on the eve of the
Republican National Convention.
There was nothing unusual in the
jammed lohhies of every big hotel,
the flaring banners and flying rumors
or even in seeing the wise owls of
many political campaigns very seri
ously and clearly proving to small
groups here and there who was sure
to win the nomination. Those things
are a part of the scenery of all po
litical conventions.
The unusual thing I found at the
Hoover headquarters where Ralph
Arnold, '99, is in charge. These spaci
ous quarters were filled with the high
est type of men and women I have ever
seen gathered together for a political
fight. They represented, from every
state of the Union, the concentrated
idealism of American politics of to
day. These men and women are not
on the payroll of any slush fund. Each
is there at his or her own expense to
do what can be done to advance the
interest of this country in advocating
the nomination of Hoover. They know
what Hoover stands for, but, I am
frank to admit, the majority of the
delegates do not. They are mostly
practical politicians of long standing
who are looking for an available can
'idate who can win at the polls and
when the election is over each dele
gate hopes to be recognized as a
strong arm in his own state of the new
administration. That is practical
politics, and it is mentioned as evi
lence of one of the greatest obstacles
to the nomination of Herbert Hoover.
I had the pleasure of introducing a
delegation from one of the western
states to Hoover at his office in New
York last week. His talk, though
necessarily short, was an inspiring
one. in which he frankly stated that
he was much more interested in what
the Republican party was going to do
with its great opportunity to put this
country on its feet and by so doing
stabilize the world, than he was in
who was to be nominated for presi
dent.
The next day one of these delegates,
who is a power in western politics,
came to my hotel and very seriously
asked me: "Say Scott, do you honestly
believe this here guy Hoover is a big
enought man for the job?"
Stanford men are represented on
nearly all of the delegations and others
have flocked into Chicago from an un
selflish desire to help put the un
matched abilities of Herbert Hoover
at the service of his countrymen.
But as Ralph Arnold said: "Did you
ever see such a fine crowd of work
ers? But, Gee, we're rank amateurs
nt this game."
