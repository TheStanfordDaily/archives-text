# OLYMPIC TRYOUTS TO REPRESENT COLLEGES
## Northern Universities Decide to Pay Expenses of Men on Trip 
### 
Members of the Olympic Games Com
mittee of Northern California decided
yesterday to pay the expenses of college
athletes to the preliminaries of the track
and field events to be held in I'asadena.
This will allow these men to represent
their own colleges in the preliminaries,
instead of wearing the colors of ath
letic clubs, which at first was thought
to be the only way by which the men
would have the opportunity to enter the
Pasadena meet. At the proposal of
Harry Maloney, the drive for the rugby
team will be included in the committee's
drive for finances for the Northern Cal
ifornia athletes, thus making but one
drive for the entire sum. The commit
tee will also attempt to raise $20,000 for
the expenses of the California athletes
in Antwerp.
