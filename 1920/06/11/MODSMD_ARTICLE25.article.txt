# BUILDING FROM THE PAST YEAR
## 
### 
STANFORD is about to close another academic year. The last nine months
have been more or less turbulent bccause they have been primarily a
period of transition. The biggest problem facing the student body has been
the question of the holdover and the younger undergraduates. The holdover
returned to the campus feeling that he had given up that time which he
would have spent in undergraduate life and that he should once again take
over the reins where he had left them. His viewpoint was changed. He
saw campus life more or less in the terms of world value and in such a light
that many phases of student life failed to live up to the standard by which
they were judged.
In the meantime another generation had come in with definite expecta
tions of playing a prominent part in college life. The younger man was fired
with an enthusiasm which perhaps the holdover had lost. He was keenly
aware that his class was an undergraduate class and, like youth everywhere,
demanded that he be given the full share of play in undergraduate life.
The adjustment between these two factions has been difficult and slow
in coming. Both.have strong claims and the honors have been pretty fairly
divided between the two. Nevertheless out of this period of adjustment
things desirable and undesirable have come. The so-called athletic slump
is no doubt largely accounted for by this condition. For many the good
old days have gone and they are perfectly free in saying so. If such an ex
pression is reiterated frequently enough the belief spreads and this is ex
actly what has happened here. Campus politics, university dramatics, journa
lism have all suffered the same barbed shafts of criticism. The objections
were probably justified but they would nut have come .in such volley nor
would they have been quite as biting but they have served the good purpose
of a thorough housecleaning for campus thought.
Out of it all will come a new Stanford life. The indications have con
stantly grown stronger as the year progressed. The last Quad election has
showed a vevived interest in campus politics. The journalists have worked
together more closely than ever before with sound straight forward prin
ciples for a basis. Bob Donaldson, Dale Van Every, Swendsen, Yank Hall,
Wolly Wohlford, Landis Weaver and Neil Petree all deserve credit for the
work they have done this year in putting out the best publications which
Stanford has ever seen. Athletics have come back strong. From the time of
the Big Game when the fighting spirit of the Cardinal came back into its
own, through the victorious basketball season, on into track which wound
up with Stanford's wonderful showing in the East, the men and women of
the University have known that Stanford athletics still have possibilities.
The old time sportsmanship of the Stanford athlete is back on the Farm.
An occasional dispute with the athlete doesn't necessarily mean that he is
a low-brow whose opinion isn't respected.
This last year has been a building for the future in every sense of the
word. It is easy enough to point out what is wrong and for some strange
reason it always sems more difficult to sense the good which has come out of
the wrong.
With the opening of the new year, the student will probably find
that the period of transition is over. The problems which were so vexing
this year will be. gone and although new ones will come, the men and women
of Stanford can face them in the knowledge that Stanford is back again upon
a newer, finer basis.
