edition o£ the Daily Palo Alto completes Volume 57. The last four
months have seen many changes in the Daily Palo Alto which we hope have
been for the good of the paper in every instance. The first step came in
the lengthening of the columns of the five-column paper. By setting the
type solid at least a third again more news was given to the campus. The
pressure for space was still felt to be a problem, however, so every effort
was made thoward getting a six column paper. Through the co-operation of
Comptroller Roth this was finally made possible. With the assurance of a
new press for the Fall, the time had come to approach the staff on the
question.
The six column paper must be largely accredited to the co-operation of
the staff and the business management. The new problems of adjustment in
getting in three times as much copy, handling telegraph news, and planning
for a more elaborate make-up has taxed the staff to the utmost. In many
instances, it was impossible for the staff to work as smoothly as formerly but
these questions are simply a question of time in working out the solution.
The editor takes this opportunity to thank R. E. Wedenkind for .his work
as managing editor. Through his professional experience, the Daily Palo
Alto took on a more finished and polished tone and appearance. To the
news editors, E. E. Crowe, R. W. Kenny, W. F. Leiser, S. G. Whittelsey, F. S.
Reeder, and F. V. Hocking, the editor wishes to express her appreciation of
their untiring efforts to co-operate and put the paper upon a new basis.
