# PRINCETON TRACK TEAM WILL MEET ENGLISH STARS
## 
### Franklin B. Morse 
Probably no international sporting
event in the history of athletics was
more quickly arranged than the Prince
ton-Cambridge-Oxford track and field
meet which is to take place in England.
There was not so much as a hint of any
such proceedings when the British Ox
ford-Cambridge combined relay team
came over here to compete in the Phila
delphia relay races last month. Then
the athletes of the two nations met,
liked each other, and got friendly. Out
of a clear sky came the invitation from
the Englishmen, and just as quickly
Princeton accepted.
It is startling evidence of the prog
ress of time and events to the has-been
of a generation or so ago. Now a team
thinks nothing of going halfway around
the world to compete in an event which
takes but a few hours at most. In the
old days it was something of a trip to
invade another state, leave alone an
other section of the United States. Con
siderable preparation was made for an
anticipated invasion which amounted to
only a few hundred miles.
Now football teams make the trans
continental jump from New York to
Pasadena to play a football game, track
men from Stanford and Berkeley, Cal.,
take a run over to Philadelphia to run
a hundred yards or jump a score of
feet, and are back again before one has
hardly had time to read about their
achievements.
The invitation given Princeton ad
mitted of four options. They had the
choice of competing against the com
bined teams of Oxford and Cambridge
or against each in separate meets. The
Tigers decided to tackle the combination.

The meet will be held at the Queen's
Club in London under English i track
rules, the ten standard English track
events excluding the American 220-yard
low hurdles, the 220-yard dash, and the
pole vault. A suggestion has been put
forward by Oxford, subject to the ap
proval of Cambridge authorities and
which Princeton has accepted, that the
discus throw be included in the list of
events. In contrast to the American
system of scoring, only first places will
be counted, each winner getting one
point for his team.
The Princeton team is due to arrive at
Oxford about June 25. The men will
begin training for the pieet immediately
on arrival. The meet will be held some
time between July 5 and 10. The Prince
ton athletes and coaches will be quar
tered in the Oxford dormitories and will
train on the Oxford track with the
English athletes.
It is expected that about sixteen ath
letes will compose the Princeton team
and they are scheduled to leave this
country in two groups, one sailing from
New York and the other from Montreal
not later than the 12th of this month.
Princeton's track and field team is one
of the best in the country, having de
feated both Harvard and Yale in their
dual meet. It was nosed out for first
place in the annual intercollegiate meet
by Philadelphia which won a second
place in the final event of the meet upon
which hinged which would be the ulti
mate victor.
Immediately after the meet in Lon
don, those Princeton athletes which
make a good showing will return to this
country and be sent to Boston to com
pete in the Olympic trials.

ford-Cambridge combined relay team
came over here to compete in the Phila
delphia relay races last month. Then
the athletes of the two nations met,
liked each other, and got friendly. Out
of a clear sky came the invitation from
the Englishmen, and just as quickly
Princeton accepted.
It is startling evidence of the prog
ress of time and events to the has-been
of a generation or so ago. Now a team
thinks nothing of going halfway around
the world to compete in an event which
takes but a few hours at most. In the
old days it was something of a trip to
invade another state, leave alone an
other section of the United States. Con
siderable preparation was made for an
anticipated invasion which amounted to
only a few hundred miles.
Now football teams make the trans
continental jump from New York to
Pasadena to play a football game, track
men from Stanford and Berkeley, Cal.,
take a run over to Philadelphia to run
a hundred yards or jump a score of
feet, and are back again before one has
hardly had time to read about their
achievements.
The invitation given Princeton ad
mitted of four options. They had the
choice of competing against the com
bined teams of Oxford and Cambridge
or against each in separate meets. The
Tigers decided to tackle the combination.

The meet will be held at the Queen's
Club in London under English i track
rules, the ten standard English track
events excluding the American 220-yard
low hurdles, the 220-yard dash, and the
pole vault. A suggestion has been put
forward by Oxford, subject to the ap
proval of Cambridge authorities and
which Princeton has accepted, that the
discus throw be included in the list of
events. In contrast to the American
system of scoring, only first places will
be counted, each winner getting one
point for his team.
The Princeton team is due to arrive at
Oxford about June 25. The men will
begin training for the pieet immediately
on arrival. The meet will be held some
time between July 5 and 10. The Prince
ton athletes and coaches will be quar
tered in the Oxford dormitories and will
train on the Oxford track with the
English athletes.
It is expected that about sixteen ath
letes will compose the Princeton team
and they are scheduled to leave this
country in two groups, one sailing from
New York and the other from Montreal
not later than the 12th of this month.
Princeton's track and field team is one
of the best in the country, having de
feated both Harvard and Yale in their
dual meet. It was nosed out for first
place in the annual intercollegiate meet
by Philadelphia which won a second
place in the final event of the meet upon
which hinged which would be the ulti
mate victor.
Immediately after the meet in Lon
don, those Princeton athletes which
make a good showing will return to this
country and be sent to Boston to com
pete in the Olympic trials.
Probably no international sporting
event in the history of athletics was
more quickly arranged than the Prince
ton-Cambridge-Oxford track and field
meet which is to take place in England.

such proceedings when the British Ox
