LAKE TAHOE, Calif., June 11 —
(United Press) —Defeat of the Cali
fornia community property law at the
coming referendum election was urged
by L. H. Roseberry, vice-president of
the Security Trust and Savings Bank,
of Los Angeles, in an address late to
day before tlie convention of the Cali
fornia Bankers' association here.
The law, now subjects to referendum
vote of the people, gives married wo
men tenstamentary power over one
half of the community property of
husband and wife.
Following an analysis of the provisi
ons of the law, Roseberry declared it
to be fraught with legal technicalities,
strongly hampering business activities
and to be contrary to public policy
and specially wrong.
"The basic principle underlying our
community property laws is that the
husband is the 'bread winner' of the
family and as such should be vested
with sufficient title and control over
the community property to enable him
to discharge his legal and moral obli
gations," Roseberry said.
"If the husband is unduly restrict
ed in such rights, his power to ade
quately maintain and protect his fam
ily is impaired."
The law would prove to be a won
derful instrumentality for fraud and
unfair dealing by designing persons,
asserted the banker. It also seeks
to create burdens for the husband,
rather than to remove burdens to the
wife, he maintained.
