# U.S. VOCATION BOARD PROVIDES PLACEMENTS
## 
### 
Placement training for the majority of
Stanford Federal Board men has been
provided by the Vocational Board at
San Francisco. The work chosen by the
board for the various trainees coincides
with their individual courses in college
â€¢nstruction. Those who have come to
Stanford from other districts have been
transferred to their original fields for
the period of time allowed for individual
placement training. Those who have
not applied for placement work will
probably continue their courses through
out the summer session.
