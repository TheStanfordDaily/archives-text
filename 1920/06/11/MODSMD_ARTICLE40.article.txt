# AMERICAN CUP WILL COST SIR THOMAS UPTON TIDY SUM
## 
### William Unmack 
The outsider has no idea of what this
year's • chase of the America's Cup is
costing Sir Thomas Lipton. The cost
of bringing over a trial yacht for test
races with the Challenger Shamrock is
a big item in itself. That, however, is
only small considered alongside other
items.
For instance, Sir Tom has chartered
the ocean-going yacht Victoria at a cold
thousand dollars per day. Then he also
has an ocean tug at five hundred a day,
and he has chartered a "house boat" for
his various crews to live in. There arc
ISO men on the pay roll of Sir Thomas
right now in New York. Besides this,
the English yachtsman also "feeds" all
these men and is going to entertain lav
ishly on the Victoria during the races.
Figure out all these items and multiply
them by four months and you will find
a nice little bill.
That Japan will have a phenomenally
strong duct of tennis players in the
Olympic Games contests is assured. Icln
Kumagie, one of the highest ranking
players in this country, will be joined at
Antwerp by Zeno Schmituz, the present
champion of Japan and India. He was a
real sensation of the world's hard-court
title events in Paris last month and was
defeated by Goubert the Frenchman in
the final.
Eldon Jenne, of Washington State
college, now holds the Pacific Coast pole
vault record with 13 feet 1 inch, made
May 28. The new mark breaks the pre
vious record of 13 feet Y\ inch, held
jointly by Spearrow of Portland and
Jenne.
Gaston Vidal, president of the French
Sporting Federation, is of the opinion
that the athletes of France will give a
better account of themselves at Antwerp
than in any former Olympic games.
California trapshooters made a re
markable showing in the compilation of
men who have shot in 500 tournaments.
Frank Troeh, of Vancouver, Wash.,

included in the big-average men, while
Washington, Nevada, Arizonr, each
have one man high up, including Troeh.

Norman Ross, the world's swimming
champion will not be a competitor in

Neptune Beach, Alameda, tank, June
26, but has decided to return to Chicago
and compete in the trials' there. How
ever, Duke Kahanamoku, Ludy Langor,
Stubby Krugcr, and other world-famous
swimmers will compete in the trials at
Neptune. Teams from Portland (Ore.-,
Salt Lake, and California will be on
hand to give the Hawaiian swimmers
plenty of competition.
