# WOOD'S NAME PUT BEFORE CONCLAVE BY HENRY ALLEN
## Kansas Governor Emphasizes Generals Cuban Record as the Main Qualification 
### 
CHICAGO, June 11. —General Leon
ard Wood's record as governor of Cuba
and as an administrator in island pos
sessions was the great argument ad
vanced by Governor Henry Allen of
Kansas today when he presented the
general's name to the Republican con
vention as a candidate for president.
Allen quoted from Roosevelt and
Elihu Root and others to prove how
highly Wood's insular administration
was regarded.
He also touched upon the general's
foresight and his initiative as displayed
in his warnings to America to prepare
during the world war. His work with
the training camps and cantonments and
his cheerful obedience to orders which
kept him from the fighting front, also
were touched upon.
The governor also touched upon the
general's prompt assumption of control
in strike and racial disorders where, he
said, order promptly succeeded chaos
and all factions willingly yielded to his
fair control.
"Wood's views on military training
are known and can not be so twisted as
to frighten the timid." Allen declared
"There is witness of his service," Al
len said, asserting that the time calls
for an unusual leader and that the
choice now made when "restive minds
arc plastic," may shape the government
for fifty years or more to come.
"The American soldier is a citizen
soldier," Allen said. "Leonard Wood
holds fast to the tradition of the great
citizen soldiers of the republic. His
well-known belief in a small but well
trained army, his constant declaration
that he believes in the training of citi
zens for better citizenship, in sound
minds for sound bodies, can not be
twisted before an intelligent people into
a false shape with which to frighten the
timid."
Wood will not create for himself "a
neutral background out of mediocre
men," if elected, Allen promised.
"With full appreciation of the callenge
of the hour, I present the man who fits
the hour—Leonard Wood."
Applause; prolonged applause.
