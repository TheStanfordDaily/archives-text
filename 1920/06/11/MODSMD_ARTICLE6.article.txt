# BASEBALL VARSITY FINISHES WITH AN AVERAGE OF 500
## 
### 
Stanford varsity baseball team closed
the season with an average of .500, hav
ing won eleven games and lost a like
number. One game tied in twelve in
nings with the 11th Cavalry team at
Monterey brings the total of twenty
three games played during the season
This is a very creditable showing when
it is remembered that the team was
without the assistance of Coach Evans
during the first few games. Scholarship
troubles came near disrupting the team
on one occasion, forcing a complete re
construction of the infield, so that the
record made by the varsity is all to the
good.
Draper and Newland carried the bur
den of the pitching during the year.
Ihey were assisted by Briggs and Pe
louzc during the latter part of the
schedule. Newland won a majority of
his games, but Draper was followed by
an oversized jinx during the whole sea
son. The team did not hit behind him
as they ordinarily did, and a sore shoul
der bothered him during the middle of
the season.
All told the season may well be count
ed as a success, and with better luck
next year, the varsity which remains
practically intact will probably boast of
a higher average at the end of the sea
son.
