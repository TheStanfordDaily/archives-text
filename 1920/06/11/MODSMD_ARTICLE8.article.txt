# Geology Bench Takes Trip to Engineering Corner But Returns
## 
### 
This afternoon Geology Bench rests
serenely in its accustomed place at the
southwest corner of the campus, an
chored down by two dutiful geology ma
jors. This morning it was not in its
own shady spot.
The reason for this: The ordinarily
hardy engineers this morning weakened
under the strain of spring weather and
impending "exes" and determined that
if they were to hold their posts at En
gineering Corner they would need sup
port. A committee was authorized to
sneak away witli or seize bodily the
Geology Bench, to be located at the pop
ular corner of "Watchful Waiting."
For a few brief minutes the engineers
rested in peace and comfort; but geolo
gists soon appeared and the coveted
bench returned to its native haunts.
