"everything from
silk stockings to
bathing suits--"
All the clever attractive togs that well
dressed women love to possess—are
here in abundance—and such tasteful
choices! All the little odds and ends that
make a costume complete—dainty neck
wear, correct gloves, fine lingerie—as
well as the frocks, and suits and blouses
—they're here—so new, so smart —and
invariably so low-priced! It is just a
pleasant trip to San Jose —and well worth
while!
140 So. First St., San Jose, Calif.
