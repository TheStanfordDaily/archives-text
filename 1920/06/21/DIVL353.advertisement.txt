Advertising in the Daily Palo Alto by the merchants of
San Jose has had a remarkable increase this year.
This indicates that more and more Stanford people
are coming to realize that San Jose has stores that
offer real values, and that they are quicker and
easier to get to than the stores of San Francisco.
Our service between Palo Alto and San Jose is swift
and dependable, and the fare is only 65 cents the
round trip.
Our Interurban Service also includes Los Altos, Monta
Vista, Saratoga, Congress Springs, Los Gatos, Camp
bell, Cupertino and Alum Rock Park, and many other
points in the beautiful Santa Clara Valley. Timetables
and tickets may be obtained at the Southern Pacific
Ticket Office in Palo Alto, and round-trip tickets can
be purchased from conductors on cars.
We are ready at any time to run a Special Car from
Stanford to any point on our lines, for Initiations,
Parties, Picnics, etc.
For information about our service or rates, call at office
65 S. Market Street, San Jose, or Ticket Office South
ern Pacific Co., Palo Alto, or else write to Mr. F. E.
Chapin, General Manager, San Jose, Calif.
