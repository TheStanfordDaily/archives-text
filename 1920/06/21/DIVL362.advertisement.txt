Th Wash Frocks You'll Want
For Your House Parties
There are the most adorable wash dresses for almost
every minute of your vacation-time. You can be so delight
fully "dressed-up" in a gingham frock the way they're
making them now, with quaint organdie collars and wide
sashes—to say nothing of little frills running around where
you would least expect them.
For afternoon and informal evenings there are the more
elaborate organdies and French voiles in softest shell pink,
tea rose, orchid, maize, and almost every color you've ever
seen. The lace and net dresses too, are most alluring with
garnitures of ribbon and flowers.
II
And a most important part about it is that by taking advantage of
a splendid sale of wash frocks we are having this week, you may be
able to work in some extras in your summer outfit. The sale prices
will be —
$8.00
$12.00
$22.00
$28.00
Rosemary Dresses
The famous ROSEMARY DRESSES you've read about

enchanting at $35.00.
