# 'GOOD GRACIOUS ANNABELLE' SHOWS DRAMATIC ABILITY
## Sparkling Lines With Clever Acting Make Senior Farce Well Balanced Production 
### Dorothy Nichols, '23 
Broadway farce of pre-prohibition
days presents some difficulties for
western production after the war, but
the cast of Clare Rummer's clever
comedy "Good Gracious, Annabelle"
provided a thoroughly delightful three
hours for the tired ex-week student.
Around the difficulties of 'rich' people
without money the author has evolved
a plot of ingenious situation. Anna
belle, finding herself penniless, home
less, and co-respondent, not knowing
where her caveman husband is, hires
out for a cook at the Wimbledon's,
taking with her four friends for cook's
helper, parlor maid, chauffeur, and
gardener. While at Wimbledon's, she
succeeds in rescuing her husband's
fortune by stealing the two controlling
shares of stock from Wimbledon, who
got them from her by fraud. She falls
in love with her husband, now civilized
and shaved, and the curtain falls on
the reunited pair.
Swift action is the life of such a
farce, whose main interest lies in the
originality and clever turns of the
lines, but the production lacked the
smoothness and surety that is brought
by tireless rehearsing. The play was
well cast; all the players had good
voices and their enunciation was clear,
and there was more balance, with none
of the minor parts neglected, than is
usual in professional performances.
Individual effort of the actors gave
evidence of conscientious and talented
work by experienced amateurs. Mona
Gardner, '20, as the serenest confident
Annabelle, proved herself a clever and
charming actress, easy to hear, and
pleasant to watch, although at times
her mannerisms were distracting.
Hawley Mertz, '20, is a better actor
of serious parts than of comedy, and
his interpretation of the wealthy and
convenient husband, John Rawson,
was since straight-forward, and con
vincing.
The best comedy part of the play,
Lottie, the under-cook at Wimbledon's,
wits given full justice by Margaret
Shedd, '20, whose characterization of
" he honest girl" who only took her
Scotch as medicine but was cften sick,
vas unusual. luteal of the slovenly
and spiteful slavey, Lottie was good
hearted, if melancholy. The other
non-prohibition character was Wimble
don himself, kept on a humorous and
likeable plane bv Eugeno Nisbet.
The role of indigent poet, which
might easily have been overdone, was
given an exceptionally human inter
pretation by C. E. Stewart, '21. whose
ease and skill places him among Stan
ford's stars. Mortimer Kline, '21, as
Harry Murchison, and Robert Reid, '20,
as William Gosling, the lawyer, were
well adapted to their parts, and were
eminently satisfactory. T. R. Carska
day, '21, made excellent comedy in the
role of James Ludgate, George Wimble
don's man. Margaret Wood, '20, was
a most attractive parlor maid, and
her acting was such that it was to be
wished her scenes had been longer,
and had given her greater opportuni
ties. Beatrice Edmonds, '21, as the
artist in distress, Wylie Kilpatrick, '23,
as the hotel clerk, and William
Shields, '22, as Alfred Weatherby,
whose father could no longer pay his
bills, played the minor parts with
distinction. Richard Martinsen, '21,
made a terrifying house detective, and
Herbert Nieberball a most delightfully
confidential page boy.
The sets for the play were new, the
third act garden scene being the most
noteworthy. The production was di
rected by the Stanford coach, Gordon
Davis.
