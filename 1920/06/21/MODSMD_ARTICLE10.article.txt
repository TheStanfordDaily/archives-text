# COMMENCEMENT EXERCISES ENDS CAREER OF 1920 CLASS
## FIRST CLASS OF WILBUR'S REGIME GETS SHEEPSKINS 
### 
With the conferring of degrees this
morning by President Wilbur at the
impressive service in the Memorial
Church, the Twenty-ninth Commence
ment of Stanford University came to
a close. Three hundred and fifty-nine
students were granted the Bachelor
of Arts degree, fifty-two that of Master
of Arts, and five the degree of Doctor
of Philosophy.
Rabbi Stephen S. Wise of New York
City delivered the commencement ad
dress, taking for his subject the title,
"The World and the University—A
Study in Relations." President Wil
bur gave a short talk after the presen
tation of diplomas.
From the first approach of the long
line of seniors in black caps and
gowns, until the last word of "Hail,
Stanford, Hail" had died away, dig
nity and solemnity characterized the
exercises. The seriousness, the earn
estness of the occasion, and its beau
ty, were evident at every moment.
The family and friends of the gradu
ating students were seated in the
lower main floor while the faculty oc
cupied the transepts. The graduates
themselves were ushered to their
reserved seats in the center of the
church.
Following the invocation, Rabbi
Wise gave his stirring address. Rabbi
Wise, in 1907, founded the Free Syna
gogue in New York City, and since
that time has been its leader. His
vivid personality showed brilliantly in
his inspiring talk. He is so fiflid with
the woith of his work and his message,
his vision is so clear, that he filled his
audience with his enthusiasm. Beside
his sincerity, which is one of the most
striking characteristics of the man, he
has a keen, far-sighted, analytical
mind. He had arranged his subject in
the profoundly logical manner that ap
peals to the well trained mind, and
this, added to oratorical persuasive
ness and magnetic personality resulted
in a brilliant talk.
Rabbi Wise is not without humor,
for he has that broad perspective of
life which enables him to treat all
things in their proper relations. His
humor blends with his fiery and in
tense nature.
Because of this wide view, and aided
by his very human experiences, Rabbi
Wise was able to give an address that
exactly suited the needs of university
students. His was truly a Commence
ment talk.
Rabbi Wise, since beginning his
work in New York, has been active

in all phases of life. He is a recog
nized leader in religious circles, and
his work in church and industrial life
has set the standard for others to ac
complish. During the war, he was
active in a number of directions and
for a time worked in a Connecticut
shipyard as a laborer. He was given
the Cross of Chevalier of the Legion
of Honor for his services to the French
Republic. He was chairman of the
Zionist Commission to the Peace Con
ference, and one of the delegates to
Paris of the American Jewish Con
! gress.
Degrees were conferred by President
Wilbur, calling the departments in
groups. The long ceremony by which
four hundred and sixteen degrees were
?iven was at every moment impres
sive. Seniors proudly changed their
tassels on their caps to correspond
' with their new honors. Those with
higher degrees were conscious of their
vividly lined hoods. Each walked
| away with increased dignity.
The service flag which hangs in the
I church as a perpetual tribute to the
! work of Stanford men, mutely re
minded the Senior class of those of
their original number who had given
their lives just as they were ready to
begin life and work in reality. This
year's graduating class is the war
class of the University. These who
entered as freshmen saw in their first
| year the United States enter the World
War. Their junior year arrived before
j the end of the war came, and in the
meantime, Stanford ranks were largely
depleted in order to fill out the ranks
of the army and navy. Since then,
Stanford has been restored to normal,
and the senior class graduates with
the record of a "Peaceful College
Year," but tried in the experience of
two years of war.
President Wilbur addressed the
Senior Class after the degrees were
conferred. He spoke in part as fol
lows:
INSERT SPEECH—
j The benediction followed President
Wilbur's talk, and Commencement was
over save for the singing of "Hali,
Stanford, Hail." The words held an
added significance to members of the
i senior class as they sang it for the
' last time as a class.
Following the commencement exer
j cises the class and faculty and audi-
I ence met for a panorama picture of
! the assemblage with the Quad for a
background. This been establish
ed for a custom i'or the last five
I years.
