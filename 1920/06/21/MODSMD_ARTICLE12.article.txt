for many years to have a home with
spacious grounds and adequate space
for the use of the children of the Stan

of service whiclt' character'zed tho
work for the Home and what a real
part of SMrford life the Convalescent
Home should prove to be.

sity, brought out the university view
point in regard to the Home. He em
phasized what a valuable thing chari
table work was for the students of
the University and what a valuable
thing it was to have a charitable in

of the word belonged to Stanford men
and women
Mrs. Payson J. Treat, chairman of
the House Committee, gave a summary
of the activities of the House Com
mittee for the current year and ex
plained in some detail the work of
the committee. The actual running of
the hom'? is carried on by the house
committee which employs the mat
ron, cook, and nurse necessary to the
establishment. Mrs. Treat explained

wad to secure the services of the mat
ron for this year and how invaluable
her work has been toward the success
ful running of the institution.
Floyd McElroy, *21, president of the
Associated Students, represented the
student body of the University. It has
been the privilege of the students of
Stanford in having a part in the new
Home by declaring a student Labor
Day by which it was made possible
to clean up the grounds of the Home.
Labor Day will long be remembered
as one of tho finest things which has
come to the students of the Universi
ty in a long time and it is hoped that
Labor Day will be made an annual
custom in university life. It Is the
only means by which the University as
a whole can be brought into close con
tact with the work of the Convalescent
Home.
