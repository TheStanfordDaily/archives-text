# ROMANCE, WORK AND PLAY CHARACTERIZE LIFE OF STANFORD'S FOREMOST ALUMNUS

### 
Hoover, today, is undoubtedly Stan*
ford's most prominent alumnus. His
achievements stand for the finest in
American life. Although many are
acquainted with the "big" things about
Herbert Hoover, there are many who
are unfamiliar with the facts about
Hoover's life.
The following article is perhaps the
best brief summary which has been
written. It appeared in the April num
ber of "World's Work" and is only re
printed in part.
By French Strother.
Many Americans are asking these
questions about Herbert Hoover: Is
he a representative American? Has he
the personal qualities and the gifts of
leadership that fit him for the presi
dency? Where does he stand on the
political issues of the day?
Is Hoover a representative American?
He was born in lowa, in the heart of the
corn belt, in a village of 400 inhabitants,
the son of a man who was village black
smith and farmer in one. His parents
were both Quakers. He is a Quaker,
being to this day a member in good
standing of "the Highland (Oregon)
Quarterly Meeting," where he has al
ways retained the membership which he
acquired at the age of 10 and where lie
still pays his church dues.
At the age of 10, Hoover, for some
years an orphan, was sent by relatives
in lowa to live with other relatives in
Oregon. At Newburg, Ore., he spent
the next four years. Under the spark
ling inspiration of the vivid life of the
Pacific coast, his mind found its natural
bent. He insisted on supporting him
self at 14.
The next three years were spent in
Salem and Portland, Ore., where he
earned his way in a real estate office,
living in a back room which lie fitted up,
and spending his spare hours studying
mathematics. In 1891, at the age of 17,
he had saved enough money to start in
college. He wanted to be an engineer.
"Hoover's Luck" Proverbial
"Hoover's luck" became a proverb
among his fellows at Stanford Llniver
sity in California. He was in the thick
of all student activities that called for
"doing something," and he was popular
enough to hold many offices to which
he had to be elected by the votes of his
classmates. He had a genius for organ -
ization and management. He did not
care to play football; but somehow
Hoover was just the right man to man
age the team. He did not sing, but when
the glee club had to find someone to di
rect its annual tour of the coast, Hoover
was the man they asked to attend to
that. He was treasurer of his class; he
was business manager of the college
paper; he was treasurer of the student
body. Everything he put his hand to
turned out well. Hence "Hoover's
luck." Rut Dr. J. C. Branner, his pro
fessor in geology and metallurgy (after
ward president of Stanford) used to get
very angry when the phrase was used.
"Luck, nothing!" he would snort. "If
those fellows who keep talking about
'Hoover's luck' would study his meth
ods and realize that he succeeds because
he works his mind and his body twice

las hard as they do, they'd have his luck,
too r
Hoover spent his summers working in
| the mines, and for the government in
j surveys. He graduated from Stanford
| in 1895, aged 21, and spent the next year
in a gold mine in Nevada county, Cal.,
as a common laborer, learning the prac
tical side of mining. Then he went to
San Francisco and worked for a year
in the office of Louis Janin, one of the
best known of western mining engineers.
In 1897 Janin recommended him to an
English mining syndicate operating in the
new bonanza gold fields of Australia.
Within a year, Hoover, now aged 24,
had located and developed into a richly
paying property one of the best mines
in west Australia. In another year he
was the engineer and manager of a
group of three.
China Chooses Hoover
In 1899 the Chinese government cre
ated a bureau of mines. Hoover, aged
25, was appointed its chief engineer.
Soon came the Boxer rebellion, which
was the protest of the old-fashioned
Chinese against the presence of all for
eign devils and their works.
Hoover and his bride (as Miss Lou
Henry she had been a fellow student in
Geology at Stanford and Hoover had
made her acquaintance in the classroom
by way of a three-sided discussion with
Dr. Branner on the prehistoric date of
a pile of fossil bones) stayed in Tien-
Tsin during the siege, not because they
could not get away but because they felt
it their duty to stay and protect, both
from the Boxers and the European
troops, the anti-Boxer Chinese who had
loyally served Hoover while he was
chief engineer.
Hoover returned to the United States,
but soon had another offer as an engi
neer abroad and he determined to under
take international practice of his pro
fession. These operations he soon had
under way on a vast scale. Always as
engineer and administrator, Hoover op
erated mines all over the world, in North
and South America and Central Ameri
ca, as well as in Russia, Australia, South
Africa, Corea, Burma and China—so
wide was the scope of his work.
During all these years Hoover main
tained, together with his brother, his
offices in San Francisco, New York,
London, Petrograd. Rangoon, and other
points, spending a portion of every year
except one year in Australia and one
year in China—and one in Belgium—•
in States.
Residence" Scattered
His home was always in California,
and on every possible occasion he re
turned to it. He maintained a house and
his family spent a considerable portion
of the years, while he was traveling in
various parts of the world, at Monterey
and at Stanford University. He was a
"legal resident" in half a dozen coun
tries, for every civilized country con
strues a visitor a legal resident after
from 10 days to two months for pur
poses of taxation.
In 1907 Hoover, together with some
other Americans, acquired a consider
able interest in a lead mine in northern
Burma. They developed this concern

with railways, metallurgical works,
steamships, until it employed 25,000 men
In the years 1914 and 1915, the Belgian
relief requiring his undivided attention,
he sold his interest to the other part
ners and thereby gained a moderate
competence, much drawn upon during
the war. This development in the jun
! gle of North Burma was one of the
largest enterprises ever undertaken in
the Far East, and its American control
was only lost when the British govern
ment decided that no kind of aliens
should be permitted control of raw ma
terial in the British empire.
But perhaps the most characteristic
of his activities was in the Ural Moun
tains of Russia, where Hoover repre
sented himself and a group of Russian,
British, and American capitalists in the
task of restoring to productivity the
Kyshtim iron and copper mines.
Mines Are Restored
. . . These mines, long among the
richest producers of their kind in the
world, had fallen on evil days, because
they had continued operation by anti
quated methods and because the shift
from unpaid sorf labor even to the pit
tance paid to the freed peasants was too
heavy a tax on its outworn system of
management. Hoover was called in. 110
did what he has always done; he got the
best technical brains that money could
buy. and he made the most thorough ex
amination of the situation that time and
intense study could produce. Then he
prepared a plan of action. . . .
. . . Hoover's plan was to scrap the
entire plant—mine shafts, or crushers,
smelters—everying that "Kyshtim" had
meant for a hundred years. Hhe pro
posed to move the entire working force
of several thousand families to a new
site nearer the sources of ore, and start
all over again with a modern plant. . . .
His plan was to spend several million
dollars: First, to build a house, with
shower bath and sanitary plumbing, for
every man and wife connected with the
mine. Second, to build new mine build
ings and install new machinery. Third,
to pay every workman a real wage for
his work.
The plan was adopted and executed.
Vision begot vision, and |he owners
put up the millions without a whimper.
In a few months the new equipment of
new processes and the new spirit in
the men were producing profits that jus
tified Hoover's plan to the utmost.
American? Did his work in Belgium
shame us —or did it make us proud that
he was an American?
Has Herbert Hoover the personal
qualities of the executive—the quali
fies of leadership? The surface facts
of his career should be answer enough:
Managing director of vast business enter
prises at 30 or younger; oragnizer and
director of the greatest charitable enter
prise in history at 40; and then, in suc
cession, food administrator of the United
States, and head of the supreme eco
nomic council at Paris, where he held
in his hands the combined economic re
sources of the world—its food, its raw
materials, its shipping, its railroads and
its telegraphs—and practically ruled Eu
rope during the months in which the
peace treaty was being made. This con
trol was cxercised through an organiza
tion of volunteer aids, who numbered
among their thousands every type of suc
cessful business man and professional
man. Practically all these men had been
required by Hoover, before he would
let them work for him, to sell out their
private businesses and give up their pri
vate careers. And they took their pay
out in two things: the approval of their
consciences and the approval of Herbert
Hoover. Hundreds of them never saw
him; but every one of them felt that so
long as they fitted into his organization
and were allowed to go on with their
work, they had won an approbation that
was beyond price. If "the chief" said
they could stay, that was all they could
ask.
Personality Is Irresistible
I have talked to some of these men,
and the foregoing is an exact statement
of their attitude. Their loyalty goes
beyond mere devotion; it is almost a
form of worship. T could not under
stand at first just why, because every
one of them spoke of his lack of all the
ordinary qualities of conventional good
fellowship—and most of them hinted
hinted that he could be terribly frank—
but in the next breath they would fer
vently describe his infinite "charm."
They all felt it. The man is irresist
ible.
One more thing: Hoover's other pas
sion of the mind has been to get usable
knowledge. He has always had an un
canny power to find the information he
needs. Part of this power comes from
going tn the highest authority to get
the facts. If you want some practical
have not the proper conception of
the essence of genuine religion, and
whenever it has become a mere sys
tem of restrictions It is because it
has been exploited by men who had
an imperfect understanding of the
foundations of religious teachings.
"History," the preacher said, "had
been well interpreted as the story of

the long painful quest of man for the
blessings of freedom and fellowship,
and it is impossible for the life of any
high-spirited man or woman to avoid
taking the form of that double quest.
True religion," said Dr. Ross, "holds
the secret, first of the highest personal
freedom, and second, of the widest and
highest fellowship." The speaker
used illustrations from the teachings
of Jesus, and their interpretation by
Paul, and said that anyone who blinded
himself to the value to be received
from these teachings because of a
misconception of the doctrines of re
ligion, deprived himself needlessly of
a most valuable guide to the attain
ment of the true freedom, fellowship,
and happiness.
Dr. Ross, who holds degrees from
Harvard, Edinburgh, and many other
universities, is a native of Scotland,
and is at present Professor of Homi

letics at Union Theological Seminary
in New York. He occupied a pulpit
at Cambridge University for many
years, and this is his second visit to
Stanford, for he was here for some
time last year.
The Baccalaureate Services followed
the custom of Stanford baccalaureates.
The graduates, in academic dress,
entered, to a processional by Handel,
with the congregation standing. The
opening hymn, "For the Influence of
the Divine Spirit," by Dennis, was fol
lowed by a prayer for the nation, and
solo, "But the Lord is Mindful of His
Own" by Mendelsohn. After the Re
sponsive Reading and the "Gloria,"
the Scripture Lesson, Chapter Eight of
Deuteronomy, was read by President
Sturgeon of the Class of 1920. Kip
ling's "Recessional" was sung as the
anthem, and the sermon was followed
by a solo, "He that Dwelleth in the

Secret Place," by McDermid, and a
hymn, "America, the Beautiful."
The services were closed by a pray
er for the University, which, accord
ing to a custom peculiar to Stanford,
is always said by the graduating class
standing, at the close of the Baccalau
reates. After the benediction, the
graduating students retired in a body,
with the remainder of the congrega
tion standing.
