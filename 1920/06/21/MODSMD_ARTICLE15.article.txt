# HISTORY CHRONICLED AND LAST WILL READ AS 1920 CLASS LEAVES QUAD
## Historian Tells Story of Work and Play of Class 
### Daniel Evans 
The History of the 1920 Class was
read by Daniel Evans at the Class
Exercisaa, Friday, and is as follows:

It is indeed a futile task to attempt
to write the history of a class whose
real history is merged into the legends
of trench and dugout, camp and field,
and into the story of less spectacular,
but equally important work on
by the women at home. Stirred by the
sharp, clear call of the bugles, the
ranks of our class were well depleted
before we had attained the dignity of
the sophomore hat and it was not un
til the years had brought us the ma
jesty of the "somb" that 1920 was once
more united.
Consequently, he who would con
sider our history, must see us primari
ly as the War Class and at the out
set, must pay homage as wo do, to
the memory of those of our class
mates, who as loyal Americans and
Stanford men, did not hesitate to give
up their lives on Freedom's altar. On
Stanford's Service Flag are nine gold
stars for Eric E. Leach, Ward Davis
Howard, Alexander Leland Brewer,
Lorenz Max Hansen, Robert F. Boken
krager, James P. Brown, David Dean
Barrett, James Alsworth Sparks, and
Alfred Fred Woolley, all members of
the Class of 1920.
We gave some indications of our
later warlike spirit when we entered
Stanford iu September, 1916. Under
the leadership of "Snowball" Angeli,
'20 staged a terrific battle with '19,
our natural enemy, on the "Deek"
lawn. Not content with that our foot
ball men won twelve games out of
seventeen played, showing a brand of
spirit that moved the gentlemen of
the Press to remark that, "in the
amount of fight and gameness dis
played, the Stanford Babies took the
palm." Lloyd Aubert captained '20's
gridiron stars and our other leaders
were K. W. Pike, baseball; Bill Hood,
baseball; Milton Samis, track; Leslie
Tilton, Crew. "Cash" Davis who cap
tained the 1920 varsity, was also a
member of the freshman crew and it
was in that year that Gene Davis, Ad
die Westwick, Merlin Maynard and
Jess Wells showed the ability that
later secured them places in Stan
ford's Hall of Athletic Fame. More
over, it was in that year that Norman
Ross made his appearance in the
Stanford tank with our numerals.
As for the year itself, we saluted
our first "Big Game" by constructing
a record-breaking bonfire in eight days,
under the chairmanship of Norman
Ross. On the night of the presidential
election, it almost came to grief at
the hands of Santa Clara invaders, but
quick work on the part of the guards
and volunteers saved it from destruc
tion. Unfortunately, in spite of our
zeal and the intense enthusiasm shown
at the rally, the malevolent jinx of the
Yah-Hoo bird shadowed the hopes of
the Cardinal and our first "Big Game"
ended in a victory for Santa Clara.
From then we progressed evenly
through months of Cardinal victories
in track, and a less successful sea
son in baseball and basketball. With
the declaration of war in April, in
terest changed abruptly to things ma

terial and the last two months of the
school year found us hip-liipping
seriously about the campus in "In
tensive Training in Preparation for the
Greater Game on the Other Side."
With the opening of the Fall se
mester in 1917 one who should ask
for them would find but few of the
men of '20'. As the weeks rolled into
months and the months marked the
passing of two tragic years, scarcely
a week went by but that some class
mate did not leave for service. Olive
| drab and navy blue were predominant
|as the campus was turned into a
! training camp for the S. A. T. C. and
the younger classes. The women ef
iciently organized by the Women's
Service Board under Margaret Shedd
and later carried on by Lois Park, '20,
did wonderful work during that period
j and during the terrible influenza epi
demic that followed. With the spring
of 1919 old faces began to reappear
on the Quad, and with the coming of
June and Commencement, things be
gan to take on their natural pre-war
aspect.
October rolled back the curtain for
'20's last appearance. It has been a
wonderful year, a year that we shall
never forget. It has been marked for
its many manifestations of the true
Cardinal fighting spirit and its sincere
demonstrations of effort and self-sac
rifice. The return of the Big Game in
our last year brought out the best
there was or can be in Stanford
Spirit and knit us more closely in the
perfect bond of Stanford Fellowship.
We rejoice in the sweeping victory of
the baseball team and take pains to
air our just class pride in the fact that
it was a '20 man, Jess Wells, who
captained the varsity track squad and
who distinguished himself at the
Philadelphia Meet. Nor is it the men
■ alone who are objects of class pride.
The D. P. A's editor, Ellen Calhoun,
is a classmate of ours as are Mar
garet Shedd, Ruth Searcy, Mary Lar
gent, Lois Park and other leaders of
, the five hundred.
Such is the story of the class of *20.
' It is a typical Stanford history, a his
tory of constant service, service to
country, to Stanford, to the class and
to one another. As years pass and
other class histories are written, they
may vary in time and in circumstance,
but in essence they will resemble ours
as ours resembled those of all the
classes that went before us. Because
of this —because of the fact that the
! Stanford ideals impress themselves
. indelibly on each entering class and
i under the influence of these ideals
each class lives through experiences
that inculcate in them the feelings of
loyalty and devotion that appear in
their histories, the members of the
class of '20 feel themselves not only
bound to the traditions of the past,
but know that they are already linked
indissolubly to the future —to that
future which being Stanford's, can be
no other than glorious.

the sophomore hat and it was not un
til the years had brought us the ma
jesty of the "somb" that 1920 was once
more united.
Consequently, he who would con
sider our history, must see us primari
ly as the War Class and at the out
set, must pay homage as wo do, to
the memory of those of our class
mates, who as loyal Americans and
Stanford men, did not hesitate to give
up their lives on Freedom's altar. On
Stanford's Service Flag are nine gold
stars for Eric E. Leach, Ward Davis
Howard, Alexander Leland Brewer,
Lorenz Max Hansen, Robert F. Boken
krager, James P. Brown, David Dean
Barrett, James Alsworth Sparks, and
Alfred Fred Woolley, all members of
the Class of 1920.
We gave some indications of our
later warlike spirit when we entered
Stanford iu September, 1916. Under
the leadership of "Snowball" Angeli,
'20 staged a terrific battle with '19,
our natural enemy, on the "Deek"
lawn. Not content with that our foot
ball men won twelve games out of
seventeen played, showing a brand of
spirit that moved the gentlemen of
the Press to remark that, "in the
amount of fight and gameness dis
played, the Stanford Babies took the
palm." Lloyd Aubert captained '20's
gridiron stars and our other leaders
were K. W. Pike, baseball; Bill Hood,
baseball; Milton Samis, track; Leslie
Tilton, Crew. "Cash" Davis who cap
tained the 1920 varsity, was also a
member of the freshman crew and it
was in that year that Gene Davis, Ad
die Westwick, Merlin Maynard and
Jess Wells showed the ability that
later secured them places in Stan
ford's Hall of Athletic Fame. More
over, it was in that year that Norman
Ross made his appearance in the
Stanford tank with our numerals.
As for the year itself, we saluted
our first "Big Game" by constructing
a record-breaking bonfire in eight days,
under the chairmanship of Norman
Ross. On the night of the presidential
election, it almost came to grief at
the hands of Santa Clara invaders, but
quick work on the part of the guards
and volunteers saved it from destruc
tion. Unfortunately, in spite of our
zeal and the intense enthusiasm shown
at the rally, the malevolent jinx of the
Yah-Hoo bird shadowed the hopes of
the Cardinal and our first "Big Game"
ended in a victory for Santa Clara.
From then we progressed evenly
through months of Cardinal victories
in track, and a less successful sea
son in baseball and basketball. With
the declaration of war in April, in
terest changed abruptly to things ma

terial and the last two months of the
school year found us hip-liipping
seriously about the campus in "In
tensive Training in Preparation for the
Greater Game on the Other Side."
With the opening of the Fall se
mester in 1917 one who should ask
for them would find but few of the
men of '20'. As the weeks rolled into
months and the months marked the
passing of two tragic years, scarcely
a week went by but that some class
mate did not leave for service. Olive
| drab and navy blue were predominant
|as the campus was turned into a
! training camp for the S. A. T. C. and
the younger classes. The women ef
iciently organized by the Women's
Service Board under Margaret Shedd
and later carried on by Lois Park, '20,
did wonderful work during that period
j and during the terrible influenza epi
demic that followed. With the spring
of 1919 old faces began to reappear
on the Quad, and with the coming of
June and Commencement, things be
gan to take on their natural pre-war
aspect.
October rolled back the curtain for
'20's last appearance. It has been a
wonderful year, a year that we shall
never forget. It has been marked for
its many manifestations of the true
Cardinal fighting spirit and its sincere
demonstrations of effort and self-sac
rifice. The return of the Big Game in
our last year brought out the best
there was or can be in Stanford
Spirit and knit us more closely in the
perfect bond of Stanford Fellowship.
We rejoice in the sweeping victory of
the baseball team and take pains to
air our just class pride in the fact that
it was a '20 man, Jess Wells, who
captained the varsity track squad and
who distinguished himself at the
Philadelphia Meet. Nor is it the men
■ alone who are objects of class pride.
The D. P. A's editor, Ellen Calhoun,
is a classmate of ours as are Mar
garet Shedd, Ruth Searcy, Mary Lar
gent, Lois Park and other leaders of
, the five hundred.
Such is the story of the class of *20.
' It is a typical Stanford history, a his
tory of constant service, service to
country, to Stanford, to the class and
to one another. As years pass and
other class histories are written, they
may vary in time and in circumstance,
but in essence they will resemble ours
as ours resembled those of all the
classes that went before us. Because
of this —because of the fact that the
! Stanford ideals impress themselves
. indelibly on each entering class and
i under the influence of these ideals
each class lives through experiences
that inculcate in them the feelings of
loyalty and devotion that appear in
their histories, the members of the
class of '20 feel themselves not only
bound to the traditions of the past,
but know that they are already linked
indissolubly to the future —to that
future which being Stanford's, can be
no other than glorious.
The History of the 1920 Class was
read by Daniel Evans at the Class

It is indeed a futile task to attempt
to write the history of a class whose
real history is merged into the legends
of trench and dugout, camp and field,
and into the story of less spectacular,

by the women at home. Stirred by the
sharp, clear call of the bugles, the

Lorenz Max Hansen, Robert F. Boken

Barrett, James Alsworth Sparks, and
Alfred Fred Woolley, all members of
the Class of 1920.
We gave some indications of our
later warlike spirit when we entered
Stanford iu September, 1916. Under
the leadership of "Snowball" Angeli,
'20 staged a terrific battle with '19,
our natural enemy, on the "Deek"
lawn. Not content with that our foot
ball men won twelve games out of
seventeen played, showing a brand of
spirit that moved the gentlemen of
the Press to remark that, "in the
amount of fight and gameness dis
played, the Stanford Babies took the
palm." Lloyd Aubert captained '20's
gridiron stars and our other leaders
were K. W. Pike, baseball; Bill Hood,
baseball; Milton Samis, track; Leslie
Tilton, Crew. "Cash" Davis who cap
tained the 1920 varsity, was also a
member of the freshman crew and it
was in that year that Gene Davis, Ad
die Westwick, Merlin Maynard and
Jess Wells showed the ability that
later secured them places in Stan
ford's Hall of Athletic Fame. More
over, it was in that year that Norman
Ross made his appearance in the
Stanford tank with our numerals.
As for the year itself, we saluted
our first "Big Game" by constructing
a record-breaking bonfire in eight days,
under the chairmanship of Norman
Ross. On the night of the presidential
election, it almost came to grief at
the hands of Santa Clara invaders, but
quick work on the part of the guards
and volunteers saved it from destruc
tion. Unfortunately, in spite of our
zeal and the intense enthusiasm shown
at the rally, the malevolent jinx of the
Yah-Hoo bird shadowed the hopes of
the Cardinal and our first "Big Game"
ended in a victory for Santa Clara.
From then we progressed evenly
through months of Cardinal victories
in track, and a less successful sea
son in baseball and basketball. With
the declaration of war in April, in
terest changed abruptly to things ma

terial and the last two months of the
school year found us hip-liipping
seriously about the campus in "In
tensive Training in Preparation for the
Greater Game on the Other Side."
With the opening of the Fall se
mester in 1917 one who should ask
for them would find but few of the
men of '20'. As the weeks rolled into
months and the months marked the
passing of two tragic years, scarcely
a week went by but that some class
mate did not leave for service. Olive
| drab and navy blue were predominant
|as the campus was turned into a
! training camp for the S. A. T. C. and
the younger classes. The women ef
iciently organized by the Women's
Service Board under Margaret Shedd
and later carried on by Lois Park, '20,
did wonderful work during that period
j and during the terrible influenza epi
demic that followed. With the spring
of 1919 old faces began to reappear
on the Quad, and with the coming of
June and Commencement, things be
gan to take on their natural pre-war
aspect.
October rolled back the curtain for
'20's last appearance. It has been a
wonderful year, a year that we shall
never forget. It has been marked for
its many manifestations of the true
Cardinal fighting spirit and its sincere
demonstrations of effort and self-sac
rifice. The return of the Big Game in
our last year brought out the best
there was or can be in Stanford
Spirit and knit us more closely in the
perfect bond of Stanford Fellowship.
We rejoice in the sweeping victory of
the baseball team and take pains to
air our just class pride in the fact that
it was a '20 man, Jess Wells, who
captained the varsity track squad and
who distinguished himself at the
Philadelphia Meet. Nor is it the men
■ alone who are objects of class pride.
The D. P. A's editor, Ellen Calhoun,
is a classmate of ours as are Mar
garet Shedd, Ruth Searcy, Mary Lar
gent, Lois Park and other leaders of
, the five hundred.
Such is the story of the class of *20.
' It is a typical Stanford history, a his
tory of constant service, service to
country, to Stanford, to the class and
to one another. As years pass and
other class histories are written, they
may vary in time and in circumstance,
but in essence they will resemble ours
as ours resembled those of all the
classes that went before us. Because
of this —because of the fact that the
! Stanford ideals impress themselves
. indelibly on each entering class and
i under the influence of these ideals
each class lives through experiences
that inculcate in them the feelings of
loyalty and devotion that appear in
their histories, the members of the
class of '20 feel themselves not only
bound to the traditions of the past,
but know that they are already linked
indissolubly to the future —to that
future which being Stanford's, can be
no other than glorious.
The History of the 1920 Class was
read by Daniel Evans at the Class
Exercisaa, Friday, and is as follows:

It is indeed a futile task to attempt
to write the history of a class whose
real history is merged into the legends
of trench and dugout, camp and field,
and into the story of less spectacular,
but equally important work on
by the women at home. Stirred by the
sharp, clear call of the bugles, the
ranks of our class were well depleted
before we had attained the dignity of
the sophomore hat and it was not un
til the years had brought us the ma
jesty of the "somb" that 1920 was once
more united.
Consequently, he who would con
sider our history, must see us primari
ly as the War Class and at the out
set, must pay homage as wo do, to
the memory of those of our class
mates, who as loyal Americans and
Stanford men, did not hesitate to give
up their lives on Freedom's altar. On
Stanford's Service Flag are nine gold
stars for Eric E. Leach, Ward Davis
Howard, Alexander Leland Brewer,
Lorenz Max Hansen, Robert F. Boken
krager, James P. Brown, David Dean
Barrett, James Alsworth Sparks, and
Alfred Fred Woolley, all members of
the Class of 1920.
