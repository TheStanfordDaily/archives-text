# LOYALTY IN FUTURE IS PRINCIPAL BEQUEST IN '20'S LAST TESTAMENT
## 
### H.G. Swendsen 
The following Class Will was read
by H. G. Swendsen at the Class Day
exercises, Friday:

We, the members of the class of
1920 of Stanford University, being of
sound miiul and body, having attained
that point in our college career where
we are about to become graduates, and
desiring to leave to future classes our
wordly good, do make this our last
will and testament:
To the University, we bequeath our
most precious gift, loyalty in the fu
ture. This, soon to be our Alma Mater,
must be a growing institution, and only
by support of Alumni can such growth
be accomplished. We have set that
which we hope will be a precedent, the
Senior Endowment Plan, and will in
the future, again show our thanks for
the last four ye irs by coming to the
aid of Stanford University, when such
aid is needed.
It is with sadness that we will to
the Class of 1921 the Sombrero, and
its responsibilities. We do not fear
that the seniors of next year will not
be all that Stanford holds dear, but
now we are leaving the best period of
our life, and our gift is tinged with
sadness. The Stanford Spirit and all
that goes with it must be guarded care
fully by the older men of the Uni
versity, and we hope 1921 will accept
its duty in this i»egard with true Car
dinal manliness.
To F. L. McElroy we leave the cares
of the officc of Student Body President,
with the realization that the task thus
bequeathed is no small one.

The care of athletics we will to the
several varsity coaches and captains.
To Walter E. Powell, especially, we
wish success in guiding football and
basketball. We feel that intercollegi
ate athletics are in a more or less
critical stage of development at pres
ent, and hope to see built for them a
firm foundation in the next few years.
To E. E. Crowe, we leave the Daily
Palo Alto, to R. W. Kenny the Illust
rated Review, to W. G. Hall the
Chaparral, and to A. Binns the Cardi
nal, with the advice that these organs
are the reflection of Stanford life and
ideals, and should be edited with the
greatest of care to preserve the Uni
versity's high standard on the out
side.
Signed, sealed, and delivered into
our hands this nineteenth day of June,

Twenty, at Stanford University, Cali
