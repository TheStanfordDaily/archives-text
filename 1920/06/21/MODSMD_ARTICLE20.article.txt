# OUR NEW ALLEGIANCE TO STANFORD
## 
### 
COMMENCEMENT is over and the class of '20 has joined the
ranks of the alumni. Today we face new responsibilities. From
this time on our allegiance to Stanford will be new allegiance
combined with the old. The enthusiasm of undergraduate days will
be merged with the more serious aspect of the world. With time our
appreciation and loving gratitude to the Cardinal will take on a new
depth and sincerity and we will realize all too keenly what precious
years these four have been.
We have often talked of the alumni of the University in our under
graduate days, sometimes in praise, again in censure. Today no doubt
will mark a change in attitude as we look at the University from the
other side of the fence. And yet there are a few words of advice which
we might take before our own graduate days are too far behind us.
It is a well-known fact that the strength of any university is largely
dependent upon the support of its alumni. Support means not only for
the shekels from the pocket in form of endowment policies, but it means
the vital active interest in the welfare of the University, in its policies
and what it is doing. It means that when you come back to the arches
of the inner Quad you will remember the joys and heartaches of your
own undergraduate days and you will turn to the student body of a
future generation with some appreciation of the problems which are
facing them. You will realize how vital they seem to the undergradu
ate and you will tackle the problems if the opportunity should be yours,
with some appreciation of their standpoint.
But more than even this, Stanford men and women have a larger
duty to the University. Evey thought and every action of a Stanford
graduate, to some extent, reflects either to the credit or the discredit
of the University. It is our part to live our lives with all the fine up
right courage which our Alma Mater has taught us. It is ours to rever
ence the finer things in life with the sam reverence which all of us have
felt at some time in the quiet stillness of the Church. In a word, it is
ours never to forget the fine idealism which keeps the Stanford Spirit
something live and vital within the minds and hearts of every
graduate of Stanford University. At best that source of inspira
tion is a thing intangible and the men and women of Stanford have a
duty in keeping it as real and potent an influence as possible. And even
though the arches of the Quad, the buff of the sandstone and the warm
red of the tile may grow dim with years, always something within our
hearts will respond to the call of the Farm if we remain true to the
teachings of our Alma Mater.
