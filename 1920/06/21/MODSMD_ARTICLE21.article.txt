# THE
						FRIENDSHIPS OF THE FARM
## 
### 
FRIENDSHIPS are perhaps the most necessary thing - to make this
life really worth living. There is nothing more tragic in the
world than to have something to enjoy and nobody to enjoy it
with. University life above all things gives its students the knowledge
of what fine friendships are and it fortunately shuts us all off together
so that we could have the chance to know one another.
The time has come, as the walrus would say, so speak of many
things but surely nothing is more important than those friends who have
taught us what fine comradeship really means. We could leave the
Quad and the Library and the Row and the Lake without a tremor if
it weren't for the friends we have shared them with. We could forget
the stars and the still night in the arboretum if it weren's for a friend
ly handclasp. The green turf on the football field would soon be for
gotten if the memory of the wild hilarious ecstasy of a Big Game didn't
still course through our veins as we thought of it. The beautiful arcadia
of the Farm could be quickly left behind if it weren't for the warm
hearts and friendly hands left behind. Friends, friends, friends! They
are with us always if we will only keep them. The ties of Stanford are
strong. The memory of days gone will linger and bring to mind faces
almost forgotten.
Many of us have come to the parting of the ways. Some of us are
not fortunate enough to live near any number of our class mates. It
will be an effort on our part to keep in touch with one another. Some
acquaintances are bound to die but others will live if only given a little
encouragement. Don't forget your friends. Don't neglect them. They
are the most precious part of your wonderful four years. You will al
ways have a strong common bond upon which other bonds may grow.

Just a line now and then will keep many an acquaintance which might
otherwise be lost. Just a postal card, only a word of greeting will keep
you in touch not only with your friends but with Stanford. You owe
this to yourself and to the University, never to allow your interests to
so entirely absorbe life, that you will be unable to remember those
who once were so dear. A fine friendship is more precious than rubies
for the finer things of this world are more of the heart than of the
earth. Success is paltry if not shared; wealth is a curse if it drives your
fellow men from you. The men and women of Stanford have come
into a rich heritage and it is to be hoped that they will not turn aside
in the interests of the years and forget that which binds us one to an
otherâ€”the friendships of the Farm.
