# THE 						ENDOWMENT A TRADITION
## 
### 
THE CLASS OF '20 has to its credit the launching of a class en
dowmen fund which we hope will be carried on by classes to
come in the future. Whereas the class has not met with the
success with which it had originally hoped to put the Endowment Fund
over, nevertheless, there is something accomplished in that it haS been
started. It is hoped that those classes which have not had the privilege
of a class endowment will add their bit to the fund, of '20.
The calss endowment fund ought to be the first step toward alumni
nitercst in the University. It ought to be the first sign of appreciation
which the graduating class offers the University as it leaves the portals
of this great institution of the .West. It ought to serve to keep the
alumni in closer tought with the University. It ough to be a great
vitalizing force in Stanford ideals and traditions.
