# THE 						1920 CLASS POEM
## CLASS OF 1920 
### 
(Whittier Wellman)
When they came the leaves were turning, and the Quad lay warm in the sun,
All the days were deep with laughter, all the nights were free from dull fears,
So they dreamed since dreams came often, and grew wise with the lore of the
years,
For long days all life was colored, and the first high goal all but won:
Then the stir of herded millions, with the tramp and rush to Romance,
And the names of flaming villages, and the dust and blur of north France,
Took the men from field and class-room, from their books, and dreams, and
from home,
Called the student young and eager, to the mud and roar of the Somme:
And the smoke of many transports, lying low o'er sea by Calais,
With the drum of Yankee hobnails, striking sharp the planks of the Quay,
Then the steady marth to Bellau, where they broke the line of tho Guards,
And the dragging days In th' Argonne, where the gains were measured by
yards;
Yot they learned to fight and like it, and to hike in mud by the moon,
And they know the town of Very, that, is west of what's left of Verdun,
But the feel of home was present, and they hoped for peace and God's sun:
There was holiday in Paris, with the word from Foch —"It is done!"
Then followed long months of waiting, at Bordeaux,, in Brest .and Marseilles,
For the word to send them westward, for the ships to take them away.

And at last the name of Stanford, with a meaning somewhat deep'ning,
Drew them back to Quad and class-room: —in the quiet summer evening
All the scenes of the war wero fading;—and instead the gentle strumming
Of guitars upon the pathways, marked the days of summer's coming . . .
There are gold stars in the setting, for the ones who stayed forever,
And the flag lest we forget them, in their last and great endeavor . . .
As the end of it is nearing, and the future highly gleams,
Come tho men with Stanford Spirit, with the youth and strength of dreams,
As they stand above the battle, on the threshold of the world,
For a moment so, awaiting, where in silence thero is furled,
Still the answer to their challenge—of the men they leave behind —
Of their place among their fellows, of their place among mankind.
Once again tho Quad is sun-lit, once again old dreams hold sway,
As the sound of old-time laughter, speeds the Class upon its way.
