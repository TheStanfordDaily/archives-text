# STANFORD ALUMNI HONOR DR. WILBUR AT BIG REUNION
## President and Alumni Plan for Stanford's Future Development 
### 
I)r. Ray Lyman Wilbur was the
guest of honor at a joint dinner given
by the Stanford Women's Club and
the Stanford Men's Club at the Com
mercial Club rooms last Wednesday
evening. The dinner was particularly
interesting on account of the recent
organization of the two clubs into
active alumni associations. It has
been the object of these clubs to
establish a closer intercourse between
Stanford alumni in San Francisco with
the University and among themselves.
The dinner was the first joint attempt
to carry out this idea and proved to
be rnspiringly successful.
President Wilbur addressed the men
and women present an the question of
the University, its policies and prob
lems. He emphasized the need for
closer contact between the University
and its alumni and the responsibilities
which the alumni must assume in the
near future to keep Stanford the great
university of the West. The need for
endowment was emphasized along
with the more vital need of active
alumni interest in all that the Universi
ty does.
Dr. D. Charles Gardner spoke on
the Convalescent Home and the splen
did work which has been accomplished
during the year. He explained the
taking over of the old Stanford resi
dence for the children through the
kindness and co-operation of Timothy
Hopkins of the Board of Trustees. Dr.
Gardner urged that all the alumni who
are to be on the campus Friday after
noon attend the dedication of the
home. Dr. Gardner declared that the
Convalescent Home expressed the
spirit of service and reverence for our
own blessing such as nothing else con
nected with the University could pos
sibly do. The work for the Home was
in line with the wishes of the found
ers of the University who said "The
Children of California Shall be Our
Children."
The Stanford Men's Club was or
ganized on March 24th of this year.
The need had long been felt for a
closer and more active organization
for Stanford men in San Francisco.
Frank L. Guerena was elected presi
dent of the Club with A. L. Trow
bridge, '05, vice-president, and Andrew
J. Field, '12, secretary-treasurer. An
executive committee was organized to
arrange for the social functions of the
Club. D. H. Walker, Jr., '09, was made
chairman of the committee and D. W.
Burbank, '09, E. F. Kern, '13, C. T.
Keefer, '13, and R. R. Coleman, '18,
were appointed to fill out the com
mittee.
The club has for its prime interest
the problem of the University and
will do all that is possible to co-operate
with the University where the alumni
are concerned. In line with this po
licy, the alumni will consider the
question of the War Memorial and
will be influential in raising funds.
