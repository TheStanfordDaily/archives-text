# PRESIDENT AND MRS. WILBUR ENTERTAIN OUTGOING SENIORS
## 
### 
President of Mrs. Wilbur entertain
ed the members of the Senior Class,
their friends and the faculty, at their
home on Lagunita Knoll, Friday after
noon, June 18, from 4:00 to 6:00 p.m.
This is an annual commencement
reception and as it represents the last
social gathering of the departing seni
ors and faculty, there is much senti
ment attached to the occasion.
In accordance with the fact that
this is the largest graduating class in
the history of Stanford many more
people were present than in past
years. Approximately 1400 people
were received by Dr. and Mrs. Wil
bur, assisted by Mr. and Mrs. Timothy
Hopkins, Judge and Mrs. John T.
Nourse and Professor and Mrs. John
Maxßon Stillman. Judge Nourse has
recently been elected an alumni mem
ber of the Board of Trustees. The
other members of the receiving line
are well-known to Stanford people.
Guests were greeted by various pro
fessors who presented them to Dr. and
Mrs. Wilbur in the reception hall,
after which they were served refresh
ments in the beautiful outdoor court.
No more beautiful setting could be
chosen for the farewell event than this
court from which glimpses were ob
tained of the brown rolling foothills
and Lagunita—pictures which will
ever remain in the memories of Stan
ford students.
