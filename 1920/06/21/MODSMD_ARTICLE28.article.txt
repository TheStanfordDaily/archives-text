# GOLDSTEIN'S ORATION SETS HIGH GOAL FOR LIVES OF STANFORD'S GRADUATES
## 
### 
Mr. President, Fellow Classmen, and
Ladies and Gentlemen: —It is but a
matter of hours until we will be tak
ing our final leave as undergraduates
from Stanford. Four years ago when
we gathered here from the four cor
ners of the nation, Stanford was to us
but a name. During those four years
we have been shaping our future in
the Stanford mold. We are a pro
duct of this institution. Wherever we
go, we will bear the stamp of this
University. For better or for worse
we will be ■ known to the world as
Stanford men and Stanford women.
Just as nations are judged by the
type of their citicenry, so are univer
sities judged by the caliber of men
and women they produce for the
world, and it should be a matter of
just pride to us that those who have
gone from Stanford in the past have
been of broad vision and leadership,
and have established a repuation for
this university, which brings honor
to the name of Stanford. And there
fore we, my fellow classmen, accept
ing the heritage of those who have
gone before us; with a full realization
of the tremendous responsibility which
we owe to the coming generations of
Stanford, now go forth to meet the
challenge of a world of great oppor
tunity, and equally great responsibility.
The world today is troubled as it has
never been troubled before and calls
for leaders to meet its coming prob
lems.
Ours is a world in which the mind
predominates. Everything in life ex
ists only in the mind. Men create
their own standard of the beautiful,
not in the things of life as such, but
wholly in their minds. What distingu
ishes the philosopher from the embe
cile lies not in the makeup of his body,
but in the ability of his mind to ra
tionalize, to think, to dream, to pic
ture the future.
Problems insignificant in one age,
become paramount in another, not be
cause they have in reality become
greater, but because the minds of men
have raised them to a higher level.
Each age sets its own standards and
measures its problems accordingly.
In our own age there are three prob
lems that are causing the leaders of
our civilization to think. The first of
these has to do with international re
lationships. For centuries men have
been taught to resort to force for the
settlement of international difficulties.
Europe was divided into two hostile
camps. Great armies and armaments,
and navies were maintained at a tre
mendous cost, to keep the peace of
Europe. Yet the system culminated
in failure. The great war bears a
silent witness to this signal failure
of the nations of Europe to maintain
peace by resorting for force, and ar
mament. For years prior to the war

there had been going on among the
nations of Europe a mad race for ar
maments. First one alliance built a
large navy and the other compelled
to maintain its position had followed
suit. And so the mad rush went on
until the breaking point was reached.
The nations of Europe have learned
their lesson, but they have paid a tre
mendous price for it. They no longer
seek the settlement of the problems
of war by dividing into hostile camps,
but have co-operated under a league
of nations of all the nations of Europe
against the common enemy—war. Yet
we of America stand isolated. Instead
of making ourselves a power in this
great alliance against war, we hear
our statesmen talking of splendid iso
lation. There is a group of political
leaders in this country who would
have America pursue a policy of
selfishness. They know nothing of the
true mettle of our people. They ap
peal to our national patriotism in sup
port of their cause, when they know
that all the natural mandates of our
nation favors an active part in the
world game. They apply the words
of Washington, spoken in an age
when men used the same means of
communication that they used in the
time of Washington and apply them to
a twentieth century world when Eu
rope is separated from America not
by six weeks but by as many days.
We turn to the field of industry and
a struggle is going on the equal of
which the world has never witnessed
There is a continual conflict going on
between those who control the means
of production on the one hand and
those who make those means possible
on the other. For a hundred and
twenty-five years we have been en
gaged in perfecting the machinery of
production. We have, however, been
neglecting the human element in in
dustry. But today the human element
is demanding its rights. The struggle
increases in its intensity year by
year, and dissension fills the ranks of
our producers. .
We approach the file of politics and
a similar situation obtains. There is
admittedly corruption in American
politics, not to the extent to which it
existed in the past years but an
amount sufficient to cause concern to
the thinking men and women of the
world. It is not that the American
people are corrupt. It rests solely
with the leaders. Ours is a govern
ment of democratic institutions. We
hear of the rule of the people. But

as a matter of fact the people do not
rule. The leaders rule and the people
merely ratify the rule. It is because
the leaders of the past have not been
willing to work unselfishly for the
American people that our politics have
been corrupt.
The world offers great opportunities
to the college man and woman. But
the world demands its price. It is a
maxim of law that every right has a
corresponding duty. In this world we
get nothing free. Everything has its
price. There is a widespread tendency
in America, we see it in our industry,
we see it in our universities, on the
part of our people to get something
for nothing, to desire to become great,
without being willing to pay the price
of greatness, to desire to become great
leaders without being willing to fit
themselves for positions of leadership.
That is who the fifty thousand dollar
a year positions are unfilled, while
htere is a constant flood of men for
the twenty-five dollar a week posi
tions. Opportunities are not created,
men created opportunities for them
selves. It is no opportunity to the
man who can work only with his
hands that a position demanding lead
ership is open. He has not qualified
himself to meet it and to him it means
nothing. If we would fit ourselves for
great opportunities we must work and
struggle and strive. There is no sub
stitute for work.
Work without purpose however is
useless. Purpose is to greatness what
the root is to the tree, it determines
its possibility of expansion. No man
may become great without working
with an unselfish purpose in mind. The
reason why our politics is corrupt,
the reason why there have been so few
truly great men is because there have
been so few who have been willing
to be guided by an unselfish aim. The
man or woman who would work for
his own self-agrandizement is not the
true leader and is destined for a place
of oblivion. To him are due none of
the world's rewards. It is the man
of purpose, who realizes that he must
pay his debt to society, before he has
acquitted himself, that is truly great.
Society demands its price from the
college man. Before us lies the future.
It will be for us entirely what we
make it. Will we be selfish or will
we work to pay our debt to society.
The answer must be clearcut. The
world insists that we make our po
sition clear. The question which faces
us is "What will our answer be?"

greater, but because the minds of men
have raised them to a higher level.
Each age sets its own standards and
measures its problems accordingly.
In our own age there are three prob
lems that are causing the leaders of
our civilization to think. The first of
these has to do with international re
lationships. For centuries men have
been taught to resort to force for the
settlement of international difficulties.
Europe was divided into two hostile
camps. Great armies and armaments,
and navies were maintained at a tre
mendous cost, to keep the peace of
Europe. Yet the system culminated
in failure. The great war bears a
silent witness to this signal failure
of the nations of Europe to maintain
peace by resorting for force, and ar
mament. For years prior to the war

there had been going on among the
nations of Europe a mad race for ar
maments. First one alliance built a
large navy and the other compelled
to maintain its position had followed
suit. And so the mad rush went on
until the breaking point was reached.
The nations of Europe have learned
their lesson, but they have paid a tre
mendous price for it. They no longer
seek the settlement of the problems
of war by dividing into hostile camps,
but have co-operated under a league
of nations of all the nations of Europe
against the common enemy—war. Yet
we of America stand isolated. Instead
of making ourselves a power in this
great alliance against war, we hear
our statesmen talking of splendid iso
lation. There is a group of political
leaders in this country who would
have America pursue a policy of
selfishness. They know nothing of the
true mettle of our people. They ap
peal to our national patriotism in sup
port of their cause, when they know
that all the natural mandates of our
nation favors an active part in the
world game. They apply the words
of Washington, spoken in an age
when men used the same means of
communication that they used in the
time of Washington and apply them to
a twentieth century world when Eu
rope is separated from America not
by six weeks but by as many days.
We turn to the field of industry and
a struggle is going on the equal of
which the world has never witnessed
There is a continual conflict going on
between those who control the means
of production on the one hand and
those who make those means possible
on the other. For a hundred and
twenty-five years we have been en
gaged in perfecting the machinery of
production. We have, however, been
neglecting the human element in in
dustry. But today the human element
is demanding its rights. The struggle
increases in its intensity year by
year, and dissension fills the ranks of
our producers. .
We approach the file of politics and
a similar situation obtains. There is
admittedly corruption in American
politics, not to the extent to which it
existed in the past years but an
amount sufficient to cause concern to
the thinking men and women of the
world. It is not that the American
people are corrupt. It rests solely
with the leaders. Ours is a govern
ment of democratic institutions. We
hear of the rule of the people. But

as a matter of fact the people do not
rule. The leaders rule and the people
merely ratify the rule. It is because
the leaders of the past have not been
willing to work unselfishly for the
American people that our politics have
been corrupt.
The world offers great opportunities
to the college man and woman. But
the world demands its price. It is a
maxim of law that every right has a
corresponding duty. In this world we
get nothing free. Everything has its
price. There is a widespread tendency
in America, we see it in our industry,
we see it in our universities, on the
part of our people to get something
for nothing, to desire to become great,
without being willing to pay the price
of greatness, to desire to become great
leaders without being willing to fit
themselves for positions of leadership.
That is who the fifty thousand dollar
a year positions are unfilled, while
htere is a constant flood of men for
the twenty-five dollar a week posi
tions. Opportunities are not created,
men created opportunities for them
selves. It is no opportunity to the
man who can work only with his
hands that a position demanding lead
ership is open. He has not qualified
himself to meet it and to him it means
nothing. If we would fit ourselves for
great opportunities we must work and
struggle and strive. There is no sub
stitute for work.
Work without purpose however is
useless. Purpose is to greatness what
the root is to the tree, it determines
its possibility of expansion. No man
may become great without working
with an unselfish purpose in mind. The
reason why our politics is corrupt,
the reason why there have been so few
truly great men is because there have
been so few who have been willing
to be guided by an unselfish aim. The
man or woman who would work for
his own self-agrandizement is not the
true leader and is destined for a place
of oblivion. To him are due none of
the world's rewards. It is the man
of purpose, who realizes that he must
pay his debt to society, before he has
acquitted himself, that is truly great.
Society demands its price from the
college man. Before us lies the future.
It will be for us entirely what we
make it. Will we be selfish or will
we work to pay our debt to society.
The answer must be clearcut. The
world insists that we make our po
sition clear. The question which faces
us is "What will our answer be?"
Mr. President, Fellow Classmen, and
Ladies and Gentlemen: —It is but a
matter of hours until we will be tak
ing our final leave as undergraduates
from Stanford. Four years ago when
we gathered here from the four cor
ners of the nation, Stanford was to us
but a name. During those four years
we have been shaping our future in
the Stanford mold. We are a pro
duct of this institution. Wherever we
go, we will bear the stamp of this
University. For better or for worse
we will be ■ known to the world as
Stanford men and Stanford women.
Just as nations are judged by the
type of their citicenry, so are univer
sities judged by the caliber of men
and women they produce for the
world, and it should be a matter of
just pride to us that those who have
gone from Stanford in the past have
been of broad vision and leadership,
and have established a repuation for
this university, which brings honor
to the name of Stanford. And there
fore we, my fellow classmen, accept
ing the heritage of those who have
gone before us; with a full realization
of the tremendous responsibility which
we owe to the coming generations of
Stanford, now go forth to meet the
challenge of a world of great oppor
tunity, and equally great responsibility.
The world today is troubled as it has
never been troubled before and calls
for leaders to meet its coming prob
lems.
Ours is a world in which the mind
predominates. Everything in life ex
ists only in the mind. Men create
their own standard of the beautiful,
not in the things of life as such, but
wholly in their minds. What distingu
ishes the philosopher from the embe
cile lies not in the makeup of his body,
but in the ability of his mind to ra
tionalize, to think, to dream, to pic
ture the future.
Problems insignificant in one age,
become paramount in another, not be

rope is separated from America not
by six weeks but by as many days.
We turn to the field of industry and
a struggle is going on the equal of
which the world has never witnessed
There is a continual conflict going on
between those who control the means
of production on the one hand and
those who make those means possible
on the other. For a hundred and
twenty-five years we have been en
gaged in perfecting the machinery of
production. We have, however, been
neglecting the human element in in
dustry. But today the human element
is demanding its rights. The struggle
increases in its intensity year by
year, and dissension fills the ranks of
our producers. .
We approach the file of politics and
a similar situation obtains. There is
admittedly corruption in American
politics, not to the extent to which it
existed in the past years but an
amount sufficient to cause concern to
the thinking men and women of the
world. It is not that the American
people are corrupt. It rests solely
with the leaders. Ours is a govern
ment of democratic institutions. We
hear of the rule of the people. But

as a matter of fact the people do not
rule. The leaders rule and the people
merely ratify the rule. It is because
the leaders of the past have not been
willing to work unselfishly for the
American people that our politics have
been corrupt.
The world offers great opportunities
to the college man and woman. But
the world demands its price. It is a
maxim of law that every right has a
corresponding duty. In this world we
get nothing free. Everything has its
price. There is a widespread tendency
in America, we see it in our industry,
we see it in our universities, on the
part of our people to get something
for nothing, to desire to become great,
without being willing to pay the price
of greatness, to desire to become great
leaders without being willing to fit
themselves for positions of leadership.
That is who the fifty thousand dollar
a year positions are unfilled, while
htere is a constant flood of men for
the twenty-five dollar a week posi
tions. Opportunities are not created,
men created opportunities for them
selves. It is no opportunity to the
man who can work only with his
hands that a position demanding lead
ership is open. He has not qualified
himself to meet it and to him it means
nothing. If we would fit ourselves for
great opportunities we must work and
struggle and strive. There is no sub
stitute for work.
Work without purpose however is
useless. Purpose is to greatness what
the root is to the tree, it determines
its possibility of expansion. No man
may become great without working
with an unselfish purpose in mind. The
reason why our politics is corrupt,
the reason why there have been so few
truly great men is because there have
been so few who have been willing
to be guided by an unselfish aim. The
man or woman who would work for
his own self-agrandizement is not the
true leader and is destined for a place
of oblivion. To him are due none of
the world's rewards. It is the man
of purpose, who realizes that he must
pay his debt to society, before he has
acquitted himself, that is truly great.
Society demands its price from the
college man. Before us lies the future.
It will be for us entirely what we
make it. Will we be selfish or will
we work to pay our debt to society.
The answer must be clearcut. The
world insists that we make our po
sition clear. The question which faces
us is "What will our answer be?"
Mr. President, Fellow Classmen, and
Ladies and Gentlemen: —It is but a
matter of hours until we will be tak
ing our final leave as undergraduates
from Stanford. Four years ago when
we gathered here from the four cor
ners of the nation, Stanford was to us
but a name. During those four years
we have been shaping our future in
the Stanford mold. We are a pro
duct of this institution. Wherever we
go, we will bear the stamp of this
University. For better or for worse
we will be ■ known to the world as
Stanford men and Stanford women.
Just as nations are judged by the
type of their citicenry, so are univer
sities judged by the caliber of men
and women they produce for the
world, and it should be a matter of
just pride to us that those who have
gone from Stanford in the past have
been of broad vision and leadership,
and have established a repuation for
this university, which brings honor
to the name of Stanford. And there
fore we, my fellow classmen, accept
ing the heritage of those who have
gone before us; with a full realization
of the tremendous responsibility which
we owe to the coming generations of
Stanford, now go forth to meet the
challenge of a world of great oppor
tunity, and equally great responsibility.
The world today is troubled as it has
never been troubled before and calls
for leaders to meet its coming prob
lems.
Ours is a world in which the mind
predominates. Everything in life ex
ists only in the mind. Men create
their own standard of the beautiful,
not in the things of life as such, but
wholly in their minds. What distingu
ishes the philosopher from the embe
cile lies not in the makeup of his body,
but in the ability of his mind to ra
tionalize, to think, to dream, to pic
ture the future.
Problems insignificant in one age,
become paramount in another, not be
cause they have in reality become
greater, but because the minds of men
have raised them to a higher level.
Each age sets its own standards and
measures its problems accordingly.
In our own age there are three prob
lems that are causing the leaders of
our civilization to think. The first of
these has to do with international re
lationships. For centuries men have
been taught to resort to force for the
settlement of international difficulties.
Europe was divided into two hostile
camps. Great armies and armaments,
and navies were maintained at a tre
mendous cost, to keep the peace of
Europe. Yet the system culminated
in failure. The great war bears a
silent witness to this signal failure
of the nations of Europe to maintain
peace by resorting for force, and ar
mament. For years prior to the war

there had been going on among the
nations of Europe a mad race for ar
maments. First one alliance built a
large navy and the other compelled
to maintain its position had followed
suit. And so the mad rush went on
until the breaking point was reached.
The nations of Europe have learned
their lesson, but they have paid a tre
mendous price for it. They no longer
seek the settlement of the problems
of war by dividing into hostile camps,
but have co-operated under a league
of nations of all the nations of Europe
against the common enemy—war. Yet
we of America stand isolated. Instead
of making ourselves a power in this
great alliance against war, we hear
our statesmen talking of splendid iso
lation. There is a group of political
leaders in this country who would
have America pursue a policy of
selfishness. They know nothing of the
true mettle of our people. They ap
peal to our national patriotism in sup
port of their cause, when they know
that all the natural mandates of our
nation favors an active part in the
world game. They apply the words
of Washington, spoken in an age
when men used the same means of
communication that they used in the
time of Washington and apply them to
a twentieth century world when Eu
rope is separated from America not
by six weeks but by as many days.
