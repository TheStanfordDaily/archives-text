# FORMER STANFORD MAN WRITES FROM VIENNA OF RELIEF
## 
### 
Ed Kneass, ex-'lB, who was for a
time secretary to Herbert Hoover, '95,
is now in Europe in connection with
the European Children's Fund of the
American Relief Administration, which
was organized by Hoover. Recent
letters from Kneass and Dr. Charles
N. Leach, a member of the Stanford
Medical School teaching staff now on
leave of absence with the European
Children's Fund, tell of a trip they
took together through the Baltic coun
tries. Kneass writes from Warsaw
under date of May 20 and tells of dif
ficulties of traveling in Europe under
present conditions. Starting from
London and Paris he went to Vienna,
Dr. Leach's headquarters, where he
spent a couple of weeks with a side
trip to Budapest. Leach and he then
started from Vienna together to War
saw. The Polish border was closed
and they had considerable difficulty
in getting to Prague and from there
through Cracow to Warsaw. He
writes that all the little Baltic coun
tries are filled with suspicion and dis
trust of each other. Both Dr. Leach
and Kneass write that events are
working out in such a way that it
seems likely that the German will
through friendship of some of the
Baltic states gain a bridge to Russia.
Kneass emphasizes the suffering in
Vienna which every report from that
city brings. Dr. Leach, however, says
that the warehouse business of the
American Relief Administration had
grown rapidly in the last three weeks
before he wrote and had reached such
proportions that 2500 food packages
a day were being distributed through
American Relief Administration food
drafts.
Dr. Leach at the time he wrote was
on the point of leaving to attend the
Oryal Institute of Public Health In
Brussels but uxpected to bo back in
Vienna early in June.
