# DR. D. CHARLES GARDNER EXPLAINS WORK FOR CONVALESCENT HOME TO ALUMNI CLUBS
## 
### 
The following address was delivered
by Dr. D. Charles Gardner at the
Alumni Banquet last Wednesday even
ing given by the Stanford Clubs of
San Francisco. Dr. Gardner's words
were received with great interest.
The Stanford Spirit is made up of
a compound of essences of which one
is sentiment. You know the story told
of our Founder. At a time when the
sunshine of life had been clouded by
a tragic bereavement, he woke one
night from troubled drams with these
words upon his lips: "The Children of
California shall be My Children." No
one will deny the nobility of an emo
tion which turns from a tragic sense of
loneliness to embrace the children of
a State. Stanford is a monument to
sentiment —the University a memorial
to an idolized son —the Church, a
monument erected to the Glory of God
and in honor of a beloved husband.
Some of the sentiment which go
verned the Founders of Stanford has
entered into the blood of every fine
minded son and daughter of the Uni
versity. It is expressed in terms of
Love, Loyalty, and Service.
What more natural than the conse
cration of a part of our young strength
to the care of the sick poor. In its
social service work the University is
doing a bit of the ambulance work of
organized society.
Our Stanford hospital clinic is a
charity—a centre where human science
and skill are devoted to the cure of
weak, disordered and often crippled
bodies. Doctors can only do so much
for their patients. Nursing care is
necessary. Sometimes mothers are
not capable of caring for their sick
children. Others have to work. Some
are sick themselves. And city streets
and ill-kept homes are not good helps
to convalescence.
The Stanford Hospital Clinic nobly
does its part. But often what is need
ed to complete a cure is fresh air, good
food and motherly care. So it oc
curred to some of us: Why not use
the dear old Farm as an agency for
this work of labor and love? We be
gan with a summer camp for children.
In three years we gave 360 children a
taste of the country and fed them with
honest-to-goodness milk and loving
kindness.
Last April we began a modest home
in the old Acacia House, with ten sick
and crippled kiddies, and we have had

a constantly changing family of about
that number ever since. I have seen
that home miracles of healing—the
blind restored to sight—the lame made
to walk —curved spines straightened.
Under the Doctor's care, and the de
votion of our House Mother, I have
seen the sunshine of good health re
stored to the sad, sweet faces of young
children who otherwise might have
continued to suffer, and I have seen
little city toughs made to look like
plaster saints.
One cannot see such work done and
not wish to foster it. I have long
dreamed of a permanent home for
convalescent children on the Stanford
campus. Suddenly the dream has
come true. Thanks to the initiative of
Timothy Hopkins and the help of our
good Daddy Long Legs, whose eagle
eye sees every possibility for Stanford
and whose heart embraces all its in
terests—we now have a "lease of the
old Stanford Residence and 27 acres
of the grounds at a rental of $1.00 a
year. Next Friday at 3 p.m., the
Stanford residence, with all its senti
mental memories, will be dedicated
and set apart as the permanent Stan
ford Home for Convalescent Children.
It is not a white elephant, and I am
not appealing for funds. After paying
all our expenses for the year, we have
a balance of $3,000. And thanks to
Mr. and Mrs. Hopkins there has been
gathered from the friends of Mrs.
Stanford &n endowment of $30,000
which is already invested in gild-edge
bonds. We hope you will attend the
dedication on Friday—or at least visit
the Home on your Alumni Day.
The dedication of the Stanford resi
dence as the Stanford Home for Con
valescent Children constitutes a pro
per memorial to Mrs. Stanford, and
consecrates another shrine for the
Stanford Spirit. Sentiment must ex
press itself in reverence and work.
Reverence for all that is lovely in life,
pity for the weak and ailing, homage
for those who gave to the world the
great gift which we enjoy, the determi
nation to share our blessings and to
give of our time and thought for the
good of others, these are vital ele
ments in that spirit which should ani
mate all we think and do in the name,
and for the fame of our beloved Uni
versity.

nation to share our blessings and to
give of our time and thought for the
good of others, these are vital ele
ments in that spirit which should ani
mate all we think and do in the name,
and for the fame of our beloved Uni
versity.
The following address was delivered
by Dr. D. Charles Gardner at the
Alumni Banquet last Wednesday even
ing given by the Stanford Clubs of
San Francisco. Dr. Gardner's words
were received with great interest.
The Stanford Spirit is made up of
a compound of essences of which one
is sentiment. You know the story told
of our Founder. At a time when the
sunshine of life had been clouded by
a tragic bereavement, he woke one
night from troubled drams with these
words upon his lips: "The Children of
California shall be My Children." No
one will deny the nobility of an emo
tion which turns from a tragic sense of
loneliness to embrace the children of
a State. Stanford is a monument to
sentiment —the University a memorial
to an idolized son —the Church, a
monument erected to the Glory of God
and in honor of a beloved husband.
Some of the sentiment which go
verned the Founders of Stanford has
entered into the blood of every fine
minded son and daughter of the Uni
versity. It is expressed in terms of
Love, Loyalty, and Service.
What more natural than the conse
cration of a part of our young strength
to the care of the sick poor. In its
social service work the University is
doing a bit of the ambulance work of
organized society.
Our Stanford hospital clinic is a
charity—a centre where human science
and skill are devoted to the cure of
weak, disordered and often crippled
bodies. Doctors can only do so much
for their patients. Nursing care is
necessary. Sometimes mothers are
not capable of caring for their sick
children. Others have to work. Some
are sick themselves. And city streets
and ill-kept homes are not good helps
to convalescence.
The Stanford Hospital Clinic nobly
does its part. But often what is need
ed to complete a cure is fresh air, good
food and motherly care. So it oc
curred to some of us: Why not use
the dear old Farm as an agency for
this work of labor and love? We be
gan with a summer camp for children.
In three years we gave 360 children a
taste of the country and fed them with
honest-to-goodness milk and loving
kindness.
Last April we began a modest home
in the old Acacia House, with ten sick
and crippled kiddies, and we have had

a constantly changing family of about
that number ever since. I have seen
that home miracles of healing—the
blind restored to sight—the lame made
to walk —curved spines straightened.
Under the Doctor's care, and the de
votion of our House Mother, I have
seen the sunshine of good health re
stored to the sad, sweet faces of young
children who otherwise might have
continued to suffer, and I have seen
little city toughs made to look like
plaster saints.
One cannot see such work done and
not wish to foster it. I have long
dreamed of a permanent home for
convalescent children on the Stanford
campus. Suddenly the dream has
come true. Thanks to the initiative of
Timothy Hopkins and the help of our
good Daddy Long Legs, whose eagle
eye sees every possibility for Stanford
and whose heart embraces all its in
terests—we now have a "lease of the
old Stanford Residence and 27 acres
of the grounds at a rental of $1.00 a
year. Next Friday at 3 p.m., the
Stanford residence, with all its senti
mental memories, will be dedicated
and set apart as the permanent Stan
ford Home for Convalescent Children.
It is not a white elephant, and I am
not appealing for funds. After paying
all our expenses for the year, we have
a balance of $3,000. And thanks to
Mr. and Mrs. Hopkins there has been
gathered from the friends of Mrs.
Stanford &n endowment of $30,000
which is already invested in gild-edge
bonds. We hope you will attend the
dedication on Friday—or at least visit
the Home on your Alumni Day.
The dedication of the Stanford resi
dence as the Stanford Home for Con
valescent Children constitutes a pro
per memorial to Mrs. Stanford, and
consecrates another shrine for the
Stanford Spirit. Sentiment must ex
press itself in reverence and work.
Reverence for all that is lovely in life,
pity for the weak and ailing, homage
for those who gave to the world the
great gift which we enjoy, the determi
nation to share our blessings and to
give of our time and thought for the
good of others, these are vital ele
ments in that spirit which should ani
mate all we think and do in the name,
