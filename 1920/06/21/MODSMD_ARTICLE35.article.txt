# CAMPUS JOURNALISTS ORGANIZE AND MAKE CHARTER APPLICATION
## 
### 
Stanford journalists have applied
for a charter in the American Journal
ists' Association. At a meeting of
over fifty students intersted in journal
istic work at the house of Professor
E. W. Smith last Monday night a
formal application for a charter was
signed and officers of the local peti
tioning body were elected.
The american Journalists' Associa
tion is a professional organization of
newspaper writers, reporters, copy
readers, editors, and artists, and teach
ers and students of journalism. Its
purpose is to undertake plans for a
national convention of these differ
ent branches of the journalistic pro
fession. This convention has not been
held yet and the action of the Stan
ford journalistic colony last Monday
pust Stanford in the forefront of this
movement.
The principal object of this move
ment is to elevate the standards and
increase public appreciation of the
value of the profession of journalism.
It intends to encourage sympathetic
and mutually helpful co-operation be
tween newspappr publishers and their
professional employees. The new
organization will take upon itself the
function of discouraging the employ
ment in a professional capacity of
persons whose character, educational
qualifications and abilities are not
sufficient to make them a credit to the
profession. It has the ultimate ob
ject of co-operating with similar pro
fessional organizations in other coun
tries, looking forward to the establish
ment of an International Association
of Journalists.
The American Journalists' Associa
tion remains at present in an unor
ganized state. Pending the first na
tional convention, the officers of the
St. Louis Association of Journalists
are serving as the provisional officers
and organizing agents of the associa
tion. The movement received Its
first initiative in St. Louis under the
leadership of Richard L. Stokes, a
newspaper writer of that city.
The local chapter of the organization
will consist of all students interested
in journalism, including the D. P. A.
staff and those of the magazines. Local
artists are also eligible to member
ship.
The officers of the Stanford chapter
as elected last Monday, are, as fol
lows:
Chairman Prof. E. W. Smith
Vice-President....R. W. Kenny, '21
Secretary .. H. F. Ormsby, '20>
Further plans for organization will
bo carried out during the summer.
