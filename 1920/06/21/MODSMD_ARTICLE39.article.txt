# RELIGION'S VALUE TOPIC OF SERMON
## Rev. G.A.J. Ross Delivers Baccalaureate Address at the 1920 Commencement 
### 
"Religion as the Gate to Freedom"
was the theme of the Reverend G. A.
Johnston Ross, D.D., who delivered
the twenty-ninth annual Baccalaureate
Sermon in Memorial Church Sunday.
The sermon was an appeal to the
graduating students to accept the
guidance of true religion in their
lives. "Religion is not," the speaker 1
said, "a method of restrain, but is
rather a pathway or a gate to real
freedom. Those who look upon re
ligion as a series of 'Thou Shalt Nots'
information, about the art of war, you
can study text-books for a lifetime, or
you can talk to a thousand lieutenants,
or you can ask Marshal Foch. Hoover's
method is to ask Foch. It's the quick
est, surest, sanest, and most practical
method in the world.
The truth is, Hoover knows. With
his tenacious memory for simple, essen
tial facts, he went single-handed into
the sessions of the supreme economic
council in Paris, facing best political
economists and trained diplomats of Eu
rope and their swarms of "experts," and
he dominated it because he knew more
than anybody else there. Time and
again, for example, Hoover demonstrat
ed that he knew more about the food
requirements and the food stocks, the
coal, and railway and shipping resources
of England, France, and Italy, than their
own administrators knew. For example,
he proposed an allotment of food for
Italy to which the Italians raised bitter
objections, until Hoover proved to them
that they were asking for more food
than they had ever consumed in peace
times, and then showed them that they
had made this mistake by using the Brit
ish meat rations as their food-index,
whereas the British had always eaten
nearly twice the meat, man for man,
that Italians ate.
Now, to go back to the devotion of
the men who work under him. They
are big men, men of achievement, men
of imagination. Their god, almost, is
honorable success. Before they worked
for Hoover the measure of success to
most of them was money. But they
knew that even fools sometimes made
fortunes—and knaves as well. Money
was a marker of success; but only a
crude marker. But Hoover, the imper
sonal, the honest, the clear-thoughted
man who knows—his approval was a
genuine marker. If Hoover said you'd
do, you had passed a test higher than
the acquisition of money or of ordinary
fame. That approval holds big men
better than any other reward.
