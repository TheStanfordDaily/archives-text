# OLYMPIC RUGBY TEAM INCLUDES 11 STANFORD MEN
## 
### 
With the release of the exact line
up which is to represent the United
States at Antwerp this summer, of
ficials of the California Rugby Union
removed the last doubts of the public
as to whether or not the fifteen would
really make the trip. President Harry
W. Maloney, by a series of financial
coups, has been responsible for the
successful conclusion of a short fund
campaign which for a while seemed
dubious of success. The last obstacle
was removed from his path by gaining
permission from the Coast A. A. U.
to give the rugby team a place on its
budget. The A. A. U. drive for ap
proximately $30,000, the amount origin
ally set for the rugby quota alone, now
includes rugby, together with track,
swimming, and all other team and in
dividual expenses. This campaign,
headed by President William Humph
ries of the Olympic Club, is already
well on its way.
According to a statement recently
released by the California Rugby
Union, the successful candidates are to
assemble at Stanford on July 26. They
entrain for New York on July 29, play
an exhibition match at the Polo
Grounds, and sail for Antwerp on the
A. A. U.'s transport on August 5. After
the completion of the big classic, the
fifteen will play a match with Belgi
um at Brussels on September 8, a sec
ond with Paris on September 10, and
will then cross the channel. England
will be met at London on September
15, the Plymouth R. F. C. on Septem
ber 18, and either the Redruth or
Camborne R. F. C.'s on September 20.
The Calfiornians are expected to ar
rive in the United States on October
5, 1920.
