# DEAN OF WOMEN WRITES ON AVERAGE SET ON CLOTHES
## 
### 
The following letter has been re
ceived by the. Daily Palo Alto in reply
to the statistics gathered by the Busi
ness manager. Mtsr, Bradford's figures
apply to an academic year of nine
months while the Daily Palo Alto
figures applied a calendar year.
Editor Daily Palo Alto: —Readers
of the Daily Palo Alto, alumni, par
ents and others are asking whether
Stanford really finda it necessary for
the average girl studylrg here to spend
$812 per year on her clothes, as a
news item in your paper recently
stated. To help the University cor
rect a false impression, 1 shall ask
you to print this letter in a conspicu
ous place in your Commencement
edition, so that alumni who are inter
preters of Stanford to the world out
side our sates, may be properly in
formed on so important a matter.
The University's attitude toward
expenditures for dress is indicated
by the following excerpt from a letter
sent annually to parents by the Dean
of Women:
"The University recognizes that
more than all else that she brings
with her, a girl's home environment
and training count in her university
life. The University, therefore, great
ly appreciates the support of those
parents who send their daughters to
college with simple standards of ex
penditure, especially in matters of
amusement and of dress. Elaborate
parties, expensive attentions —such as
candy, flowers, and motors —are quite

out of keeping with the spirit of Stan
ford, and expensive or flashy clothes
are not representative of the real
Stanford girl. University girls should
dress in a manner fitting their work
and the good sense that has brought
; them here.
To live simply at the University a
girl needs enough money to pay her
room and board, fees, laundry, carfare,
and incidental expenses, including per
haps enough for a few simple amuse
ments and pleasures. Parents should
realize that money provided beyond
this is sure to be not only wasted on
non-essentials but wasteful of time
better spent and of the ideals of dig
nified economy that a university wo
man should take away with her
degree."
In addition to the above, the follow
ing will be sent to partns this year:
To the parents of Stanford Women
Students: —
In reply to requests frequently re
ceived the following is a rough ap
proximation for the expenses of a
woman student a tStanford Univer
sity, for the year 1920-21:
Items with fixed fees:
Tuition (per quarter) $40.00
Incidental Fee 20.00
Room at Roble Hall 30.00
Board of Roble Hall 90.00
Total, per quarter $180.00
Items whose amouns vary with the
individual but of which the following
might be taken as an average:
Syllabus fees, books, etc $30.00
(Laboratory fees not included)
Laundry 25.00
Incidentals 30'.00
Clothing (estimate on entire
wardrobe) 100.00
Total, per quarter $185.00
The University encourages simplici
ty and economy in dress, and while
$300 a year may be a low average at
present prices, a Stanford girl should
not need more than $500 a year to be
appropriately and well dressed. Par
ents would aid the University greatly
if they would emphasize style rather
than fashion in buying clothes for their
daughters and would deny them extra
vagant costumes for college use.
Sincerely yours,
(Signed) HARRIET BRADFORD,
Dean of Women.

present prices, a Stanford girl should
not need more than $500 a year to be
appropriately and well dressed. Par
ents would aid the University greatly
if they would emphasize style rather
than fashion in buying clothes for their
daughters and would deny them extra
vagant costumes for college use.

The following letter has been re
ceived by the. Daily Palo Alto in reply
to the statistics gathered by the Busi
ness manager. Mtsr, Bradford's figures
apply to an academic year of nine
months while the Daily Palo Alto
figures applied a calendar year.
Editor Daily Palo Alto: —Readers
of the Daily Palo Alto, alumni, par
ents and others are asking whether
Stanford really finda it necessary for
the average girl studylrg here to spend
$812 per year on her clothes, as a
news item in your paper recently
stated. To help the University cor
rect a false impression, 1 shall ask
you to print this letter in a conspicu
ous place in your Commencement
edition, so that alumni who are inter
preters of Stanford to the world out
side our sates, may be properly in
formed on so important a matter.
The University's attitude toward
expenditures for dress is indicated
by the following excerpt from a letter
sent annually to parents by the Dean
of Women:
"The University recognizes that
more than all else that she brings
with her, a girl's home environment
and training count in her university
life. The University, therefore, great
ly appreciates the support of those
parents who send their daughters to
college with simple standards of ex
penditure, especially in matters of
amusement and of dress. Elaborate
parties, expensive attentions —such as
candy, flowers, and motors —are quite

out of keeping with the spirit of Stan
ford, and expensive or flashy clothes
are not representative of the real
Stanford girl. University girls should
dress in a manner fitting their work
and the good sense that has brought
; them here.
To live simply at the University a
girl needs enough money to pay her
room and board, fees, laundry, carfare,
and incidental expenses, including per
haps enough for a few simple amuse
ments and pleasures. Parents should
realize that money provided beyond
this is sure to be not only wasted on
non-essentials but wasteful of time
better spent and of the ideals of dig
nified economy that a university wo
man should take away with her
degree."
In addition to the above, the follow
ing will be sent to partns this year:
