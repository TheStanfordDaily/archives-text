# MALCOLM ANDERSON, '04, WAR MEMORIAL IS NOW ESTABLISHED
## 
### 
As a memorial to Malcolm P. An
derson, '04, who lost his life in Feb
ruary 1919, while on war service as
a volunteer in a shipbuilding plant in
San Francisco, a fund, known as the
"bourse Malcolm Anderson," has been
established for the benefit of French
war orphans in the Schools of Rheims.
The bourse has been awarded for the
first year to Pierre Guth, son of Veuve
Charles Guth, a French soldier, who
rose from the ranks to be a captain
and fell at Verdun. The boy, who is
reported to be a promising student,
would have had to give up his studies
in order to help support his mother
except for this aid.
The establishment of this fund
comes about as a result of work for
French war orphans by Miss Florence
Heywood, '02, Mrs. Calvert Wilson
(Kathryn Smith. Ph.D., '96) and Pro
fessor-Emeritus Melville Best Ander
son, former head of the Stanford Eng
lish department, and father of Malcolm
Anderson.
Miss Heywood, during and since the
war has been devoting all her efforts
to the aid of French war orphans, and
has been decorated by the French gov
ernment for her services. Dr. Ander
son has aided Miss Heywood by send
ing her money himself, several hun
dred dollars of which he raised through
the sale of a poem for the purpose,
and through interesting others in rais
ing money. Among these was Mrs.
Wilson, one of his early students at
Stanford and now a resident of Los
Angeles. Wilson Is sending the
contribution she had raised in such
way as to form a memorial to Malcolm
Anderson. Miss Heywood with this in
view consulted the rector of the Uni
versity of Paris, who suggested the
idea of having it expended to aid war
orphans to secure an education.
The rector of the University of
Paris has sent a letter to Professor
Anderson, expressing appreciation for
the aid Dr. Anderson has given to the
war orphan work. He wrote:
"Miss Florence Heywood has told
me of the precious help you have given
her in the development of the work
of assistance organized by her for the
benefit of our war orphans.
"Permit me, as Head of the Uni
versity of Paris, to address to you my
thanks for your generosity, the mem
ory of whirh we shall cherish along
with that of the valor of your soldiers,
brothers of our own.
"Please accept, sir, the assurance
of my most distinguished esteem."
