# GRADUATES HEAR PRES. WILBUR IN FAREWELL TALK
## "Standard of Values" Subject of Commencement Address Given at Final Ceremonies 
### 
To the Members of the Graduating
Class:
You have now passed through one
phase of your life and arc ready to try
to work out your own problems in your
own way. For years you were guided
and eared for by your parents and n; w
for four or more years you have had ex
pert training and assistance from a de
voted body of instructors. You have
only taken out of the University just
what you put into it, but your presence
here today means that that has been suf
ficient to warrant the Academic Council
in recommending you for a degree. As
you looked forward to the goal you have
just won, it 110 doubt seemed far distant
and hard to attain, but as you look back
from now on upon the diploma that is
but the milestone of your progress, it
will grow smaller and less significant.
The,lower rungs in the ladder look smal
ler and closer together as one climbs.
Life is an adjustment to values. The
one great thing we hope you have ob
tained at Stanford is an appreciation of
values and a perception of standards.
The mental training, the information ob
tained, the methods of study acquired,
arc important, but secondary to the kind
of person you arc. Stanford will meas
ure you from now on by what you arc
and what you do, and these will nat
urally vary according to the values you
place upon the things of life. Your first
struggle will be to care for yourself and
for those immediately dependent upon
you. After that has been done the test
begins. Wjll that excess opportunity
that is yours because of your training go
to play, to idling, to simple money mak
ing beyond reasonable needs, or will you
use it to further human knowledge or
help those about you to live more com
plete and wholesome lives? What is
your constructive contribution to be?
Every community in our country needs
the thoughtful and unselfish help of its
educated citizens. Our nation calls for
great public servants, wise and selfless.
Along these lines lies the greatest possi
ble human happiness for you and for
others. If your university training has
not as ye't opened your eyes to the para
mount moral and spiritual values of life
then experience will soon do so. Don't
let the dollar mark on things confuse
you as to their significance. Success can
not be measured by the big check at the
end of the month. Its measure is in the
minds of your neighbors, not in the
vaults of a bank. Too many Americans
have judged the success or failure of
any given year by the figures at the bot
tom of a column on New Year's Day.
You life here should make such a
standard incomplete. It is not how much
you have in worldly goods or in brains
that counts, but what you do with them.
Even life itself was not considered too
valuable by some of you when meas
ured against the need of our country and
against outrage and injustice. Those
who have seen service in the army or
navy have sensed the real values of
life. They have visualized and materi
alized those ideals that lead civilization
onward and upward. Our nation has
spent billions of treasure, the time of
millions of men, and the lives of thou
sands in a war. From this we obtained
only relief from danger and certain
moral values. Unless our people con
tinue their world service these values
will be largely lost and our efforts fruit
less.
Try to see issues clearly and help
others to understand them. It takes a
world of sympathy and charity to smooth
over the rough spots due to human con
flict and human weaknesses. You will
need all you can muster not to be dis
couraged.
We want you to look back upon your
University for understanding and help.
We want your constant and loyal affec
tion and your steady interest. We hope
that your standard of values will make
you see in the University one of the
fundamental moral and intellectual struc
tures in civilization. This Faculty will
think of you as their own. They will
earnestly watch you grow in power and
usefulness. Each of you is made up in
part of contributions from them. They
want you to face the world open-minded
and unafraid, and ready to achieve in the
spirit of Lowell when he said:
"New occasions teach new duties,
Time makes ancient good uncouth.
They must upward still and onward,
Who would keep abreast of Truth."
