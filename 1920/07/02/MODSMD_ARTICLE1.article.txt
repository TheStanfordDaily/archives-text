# OLYMPIC COMMITTEE LAUNCHES ANOTHER DRIVE FOR FUNDS
## Money Needed to Send Pacific Coast Athletes to Antwerp 
### 
An intensive drive for funds to pay
expenses of Pacific Coast athletes to
Antwerp to represent the United
States in the international competi
tions was launched yesterday by the
Western Olympic Games Committee.
Should the committee in charge of
the campaign succeed in raising $10,-
000' in addition to the expenses to and
from the eastern port of embarkation,
the American Olympic Committee will
arrange for additional expenses, it was
learned today,
Approximately one-third of this
amount has already been raised, and
present plans call for a full quota
within the next ten days. W. H. Ma
loney and David Wallace are in charge
of canvassing for the Palo Alto dist
rict. George Davis, Heaton Wrenn,
and Charles Tilden are at the head
of the drive in the San Francisco dist
rict.
The fund being raised on the coast,
exclusive of donations for a special
sport, will be used in defraying ex
penses of track, rugby and swimming
athletes, Maloney explained today.
Major Charles Lee Tilden has do
nated $1000 toward rugby expenses.
He is president of the Barbarian Club
of San Francisco, and an enthusiastic
rugby booster.
Stanford University contributed
$1000 through its faculty, undergrad
uates and friends, while a like sub
scription was raised in the same way
at Santa Clara University.
Small sums from outside enthusiasts
are being received by Maloney, who
expects several large checks before
the end of the week.
The Vancouver and Victoria Rugby
Union have promised substantial sub
scriptions to this coast cause.
