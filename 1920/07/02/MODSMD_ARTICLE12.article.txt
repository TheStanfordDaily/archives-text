# Refinery is Magnet For Farm Engineers; McDowell Roused Them
## 
### 
J. M. Wadsworth, '10, designer of
the Empire Refinery Company's new
plant at St. Louis, in a recent letter
to Professor C. D. Marx disclosed that
four other Stanford men are employed
in technical positions by the same
company. They are Floyd Drown, '13,
remembered at Stanford as coach of
many champion varsity rugby teams,
and as acting instructor in the Engi
neering department, who is manager
of the pipe line department in charge
of purchasing and moving the oil;
Collin Bell, '16, engaged in research
and studying combustion problems in
boilers and stills; Elmer Brue '04,
assistant chief engineer; Clay Briggs,
ex-'l3, who has charge of all con
struction work.
Wadsworth writes: "This concern
takes in and trains engineering gradu
ates much after the system of the
General Electric Corporation and gives
a college man a definite future."
"The visit of McDowell. Academic
Secretary and Alumni Secretary, to
St. Louis in the interest of the Stan
ford War Memorial and other uni
versity matters, brought the Stanford
men together and renewed our inter
est in affairs at the Farm," Wadsworth
said.
