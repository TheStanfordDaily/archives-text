# Literature Regarded As Part of History
## Renaissance Club Addressed by Professor Tatlock Monday Night 
### 
Literature regarded as a part of
history, was the subject matter of a
paper read before the Renaissance
Club Monday evening by Professor
J. S. P. Tatlock of the English de
partment. After presenting word pic
tures of men and things found in the
great work of ancient and medieval
writers, and compairing them with
present-day life, Dr. Tatlock said:
"We take the precautions suggested
by science, while our medieval an
cestors took (he precautions suggested
by religion. We are told that there
are hostile germs everywhere; they
were told that there were hostile
demons. In the long run, is it men
tally any more wholesome to be al
ways thinking of germs, than to be
always thinking of devils?"
The speaker made the point that the
men of old acted in accord with funda
mental beliefs which were just as ra
tional to them as our are; that men
today at bottom, are no different from
them, but that many modern ideals are
radically different. Literature mirrors
those changes in ideals from age to
ago, but "a careful reading of litera
ture that such ideals as cour
age, loyalty, love and self-sacrifice
are permanent. It is those ideals,
embodied in a keenly real form, which
compose the matter of the supreme
and enduring literature.
"Often it is illuminating," he said,
"to see how, out of one set of tempo
rary ideals, the next has grown as a
reaction. The Christian preacher who
exhorts the burglar to put away his
jimmy, the murderer to put away his
revolver, the smoker to put away his
pipe, is responsible for the new gos
nol of efficiency and valor."
