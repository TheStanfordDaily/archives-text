# CONCERNING THE QUADRANGLE

### 
rrHE grocer who offers his customer something "just as good" is generally
* frowned upon, at least in the advertisements. Good business ethics dis
credit the merchant who intentionally tries to foist a substitute on the public.
On first view, the "Stanford Quadrangle" appears to be nothing more than
one of these substitutes itself. Just why the campus paper should appear this
summer "without the signature" of "The Daily Palo Alto" needs some ex
planation to save the "Stanford Quadrangle" from being placed in the above
category.
When it was decided to publish a weekly paper during the summer
quarter in return for part of the incidental fees that had been paid in by the
students of the summer school, the impossibility of continuing the"Daily
Palo Alto" became readily apparent. The editor and more than two-thirds
of the staff had failed to register for summer work. Even more important
than the absence of the staff was the fact that all of the D. P. A.'s advertis
ing contracts had been cancelled for the summer. The chances for continu
ing a paper without either a staff or money were decidedly negligible.
To achieve the publication of a summer paper, some sort of a makeshift
was therefore necessary and, as a consequence, the "Stanford Quadrangle"
was evolved through the aid of the English (Journalism) Department. Its
financing was made possible by the devotion of the major portion of the
summer students' incidental fees to its needs.
In assuming the"Daily Palo Alto's" duty of serving the campus public
during the summer, the "Stanford Quadrangle" will try to live up to estab
lished standards, set by that paper, in such a way as not to damage the
prestige of the Daily when it resumes publication next fall. With the twenty
eight year-old tradition of the"Daily Palo Alto" to back it up, this paper
has the firmest of foundations to stand on during its short summer career.
