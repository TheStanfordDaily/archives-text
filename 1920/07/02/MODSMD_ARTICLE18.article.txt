# SPREAD THE GOOD WORD

A FAVORITE topic of Stanford editors is the fact that college students, as
as a rule, are too little concerned with the doings of the outside world.
College interests should naturally de dominant, they say, but the scope of the
students' vision should by no means be limited to that narrow field.
This summer these conditions are, in part, reversed. Stanford has in
its midst a large number of short-termers, educators from all over the State
of California. To them, the college interests are not dominant, and it is only
right and natural that they should not be. But it is a reflection on Stanford's
power to impress the observer, if these summer visitors of ours should go
away without being completely saturated with the spirit of Stanford tradi
tion, spirit, and ideals.
To achieve that end to a certain extent, the "Stanford Quadrangle" will
publish a series of short articles concerning the traditions and history of the
University. The rest of the instruction must be done either directly or
indirectly by the Stanford students of longer residence who are in college this
quarter.
