LELAND STANFORD

Leland Stanford, one of California's
foremost men, stands prominent
among the pioneers of this state as
a far-sighted, observer and exe
cutive, who held constantly to ideals
which made his work so important.
He was born March 9, 1824, at Water
vliet. New York, and died June 20, 1893
at his home on the estate near Palo
Alto. His early life was spent in an
atmosphere of refinement and culture,
where work was considered no dis
grace. His father, who was interested
in the new railroad developments, gave
Leland Stanford his first training in
that business, in which he was so j
important ?i factor.
After studying in a law office for 1
three years, Stanford was admitted to
the bar and practiced in Port Wash
ington, Wisconsin. There he married
Miss Jane Lathrop, in 1850. The gold
rush which had attracted Mr. Stan
ford's brothers to California finally
won him to Michigan Bluffs, where he
developed a flourishing mercantile
business. Later he was interested in
the same work in Sacramento.
It was in Sacramento that Mr. Stan-1
ford, Collis P. Huntington and others ;
of like caliber, formed the corporation j
which developed the system known as '
the Central Pacific Railroad. Diffi-1
culties of incredible proportions were

overcome, and the government, in
order to stimulate the building of the
road, made large grants of land. Stan
ford was the president of this corpora
tion until 1885, and in 1869 drove the
spike which connected the Union Pa
cific Railroad witli the tracks of the
Central Pacific System, making the
transcontinental railroad complete.
In political life Stanford was always
a leader. He was one of the origin
ators of the Republican party in Cali
fornia, and was a member at large of
the Republican National Convention
at which Lincoln was nominated for
president. He was a very close friend
of Lincoln, and was influential in his
| nomination.
In 1801 Stanford was elected gov
ernor of California and in 1885 was
made senator from this state, and as
such gained great reputation for his
connection with the Land Loan Bill.
The greatest sorrow of Stanford's
life occurred when his son. Leland
Stanford, Jr., died from a fever in
Florence, Italy, while on a European
trip. In commemoration of his mem
i ory, Mr. and Mrs. Stanford founded
; the University on the Stanford estate.
I It is a constant reminder of the love
' of a father for his son, and through
1 him, for all peopleâ€”From the Daily
