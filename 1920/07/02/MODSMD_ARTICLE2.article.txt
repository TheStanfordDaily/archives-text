# Hurdle Record Is Smashed By Norton
## Stanford Men Place in Nine Events at Olympiad Tryouts 
### 
John K. Norton, '16, running under
the colors of the San Francisco
Olympic Club, broke the world's
record by two seconds in the 440-
yard hurdles at the Western Olympic
games track and field tryouts at the
Tournament of Roses' Park in Pasa
dena, Saturday.
Norton negotiated the quarter-mile
sticks in 54 1-5 seconds, the record
formerly being held by W. H. Meanix,
who was clocked in 54 3-5 seconds at
Cambridge, Mass., July 16, 1915. Nor
ton placed second in the 120-yard high
hurdles, and would probably have been
first had not the gruelling 440-yard
hurdles preceded the latter race.
Stanford men placed in nine events,
insuring the Cardinal of a big repre
sentation at Antwerp.
G. H. Bihlman took first place in
the 16-pound shot, hurling the iron ball
for a distance of 46 1-4 feet. "Reg"
