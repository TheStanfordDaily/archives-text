# Hurdle Record Is Smashed By Norton
## Stanford Men Place in Nine Events at Olympiad Tryouts 
### 
John K. Norton, '16, running under
the colors of the San Francisco
Olympic Club, broke the world's
record by two seconds in the 440-
yard hurdles at the Western Olympic
games track and field tryouts at the
Tournament of Roses' Park in Pasa
dena, Saturday.
Norton negotiated the quarter-mile
sticks in 54 1-5 seconds, the record
formerly being held by W. H. Meanix,
who was clocked in 54 3-5 seconds at
Cambridge, Mass., July 16, 1915. Nor
ton placed second in the 120-yard high
hurdles, and would probably have been
first had not the gruelling 440-yard
hurdles preceded the latter race.
Stanford men placed in nine events,
insuring the Cardinal of a big repre
sentation at Antwerp.
G. H. Bihlman took first place in
the 16-pound shot, hurling the iron ball
for a distance of 46 1-4 feet. "Reg"
Caughey, last year's football captain,
came second in this event. Bihlraan
took a third in the 36-pound weight
event.
Flint Hanner, Coach Maloney's dark
horse in the last Stanford California
track and field meet, beat all comers
in the javelin. He threw the spear for
a distance of 178 feet 11 inches. This
insures the San Jose athlete a place
011 the American team by virtue of
the fact that no one came anywhere
near this mark in other tryouts held
throughout the United States, Satur
day. *
Morris Kirksey, next year's track
captain, took second only to Charles
Paddock, the University of Southern
California wonder, in both the 100
yard dash and the furlong. Paddock
ran the 100 in 9 4-5 and the 220j in
21 2-5.
Dink Templton placed in the high
jump, clearing the bar at 0 feet 2 and
5-8 inches. He failed to appear for the
jump off, but his performance quali
fies him for the finals.
