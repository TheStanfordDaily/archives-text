# SWARTHMORE HEAD PRAISES DR. JORDAN AT COMMENCEMENT
## Indiana College President Introduces Chancellor in the East 
### 
Dr. Swain, president of Swarthmore
College and former vice-president of
Stanford, who graduated at Indiana in
1883 and later became president there,
introduced Chancellor-Emeritus Jordan
at the recent Commencement Exer
cises at the University of Indiana.
President Swain said in part:
"I consider myself fortunate in hav
ing entered Indiana as a student when
David Starr Jordan entered as a
teacher. We of that day had the rare
privilege of sitting at the feet of the
very best that the old faculty of gent
lemen and scholars had produced and
of being a part of the new era which
was begun under the leadership of Dr.
Jordan.
"The attic in the one college build
ing left by the lire, (which destroyed
Dr. Jordan's collection of fishes and
manuscripts), was fitted up for Biology
and some of the best work ever done
in Indiana was done that fall. Dr.
Jordan's group of students that year
contained many who afterwards be
came college professors and men of
reputation in many lines. Among
these were Rufus Green of Stanford,
Eigenmann of Indiana, Norman of
Texas (many years deceased); Ever
mann of the United States Fish Com
mission, now of California; Meek of
the Field Museum. Chicago; Bicknell
of the American Red Cross; Bollman
who was a preparatory student at
that time but came often to the labora
tory and was perhaps the most bril
\iimt of all. Not one of that group can
ever forget that term. They all realize
that not buildings and equipment but
great teachers make a university.
"The elective system introduced at
Indiana by Dr. Jordan made the gradu
ates of the university the best equip
ped persons in the state to teach in
the high schools. This is one reason
why so large a percentage of the
graduates of Indiana became teach
ers. There is no doubt of the fact
that Indiana, for the number of gradu
ates, has a large percentage of them
successfully engaged in the work of
education.
"Dr. Jordan did not allow his other
multifarious duties to interfere with
his research work. He kept up this
work through his presidency here and
at Stanford. It will hardly be believed
by this generation that Dr. Jordan,
while President, never had a private
secretary. He wrote all his letters
with his own hand.
"The spring of 1891 was a memor
able one in Indiana. Senator and Mrs.
Stanford came in their private car to
Bloomington. Watt Bradfute with his
nose for news soon learned of their
presence. Watt was impressed with
the Senator's great wealth and ex
claimed to me, 'Why, he could buy
out the whole of Monroe County!'
But Stanford did not buy the county,
but he took Jordan, Branner, Gilbert,
Campbell, Barnes, Griggs, and myself
from the faculty to the new institu
tion. At that time Jenks went to
Cornell, Matske to Johns Hopkins, and
Naylor to DePauw. Thus ten men were
taken from Indiana."
