# STANFORD MEN PLAY PART IN CONVENTION
## S.M. Pierce, '22, Records Impressions of Big Gathering 
### 
Editor's Note: —Stanford's part in
the Democratic Convention has been
by no means a minor one. Sixty-five
positions of the floor staff of the Civic
Auditorium have been taken by Stan
ford students. One of these, S. N.
Pierce, '22, an usher, has recorded
his impressions of the Bourbon gather
ing for the readers of the "Stanford
Quadrangle."

EXPOSITION AUDITORIUM, SAN
FRANCISCO, July 1. —If this were a
baseball story it would start something
like this: Homer Cummings, of Con
necticut, pinch hitting for Woodrow
Wilson, of Washington, scored the
first run, in the opening inning. In
other words, the gentleman from Con
necticut set the pace for any oppon
ents of the administration when he
defined the issues in his keynote
speech. That is how the Convention
opened and is a part of history. But,
now, everyone is trying to figure how
it will end. Some of the ushers from
Stanford and the University of Cali
fornia are developing sore feet and
are getting impatient waiting for the
final ballot.
* * *
Stanford is well represented with
ushers at the big show. Fifteen wo
men and fifty men from the University
are acting in this capacity, under the
direction of F. E. Supple, '20, president
of the Stanford Democratic Club.
Despite the fact that the crowds aren't
arriving until almost the opening hour
of the Convention, the University
ushers report little trouble in getting
them seated.
* ♦ *
A number of Stanford men have
been hired to cheer for Palmer. The
Palmer suporters seem to be the only
boosters who are carrying on a cam
paign on a large scale. According to
some of the campus politicians, who
are among the delegation of ushers, it
will take more than even the cheer

ing of a number of Stanford "leather
lungs" to put the Pennsylvania candi
date over.
* * *
"Red" Betts and Joe Murphy are
among the Stanford athletes who are
keeping themselves in trim by running
the aisles at the Convention.
♦ * *
The badges worn by the student
ushers are marked "head usher." It
is said that some of them have been
making the most of this inscription
when away from the auditorium to
identify themselves as important of
ficers of the Convention.
* * *
National Conventions do away with
class distinctions; men who can write
checks in six figures are in abundance
in the hall, wearing badges marked
"usher," "page," "assistant sergeant
at-arms," and "assistant doorkeeper."
It is the only way they can get into the
Convention.
* * *
The whole show isn't staged at the
Auditorium. The headquarters for
several of the candidates in the Palace
and St. Francis are entertaining large
crowds with bands and singers.

ents of the administration when he
defined the issues in his keynote
speech. That is how the Convention
opened and is a part of history. But,
now, everyone is trying to figure how
it will end. Some of the ushers from
Stanford and the University of Cali
fornia are developing sore feet and
are getting impatient waiting for the
final ballot.

Stanford is well represented with
ushers at the big show. Fifteen wo
men and fifty men from the University
are acting in this capacity, under the
direction of F. E. Supple, '20, president
of the Stanford Democratic Club.
Despite the fact that the crowds aren't
arriving until almost the opening hour
of the Convention, the University
ushers report little trouble in getting
them seated.

A number of Stanford men have
been hired to cheer for Palmer. The
Palmer suporters seem to be the only
boosters who are carrying on a cam
paign on a large scale. According to
some of the campus politicians, who
are among the delegation of ushers, it
will take more than even the cheer

ing of a number of Stanford "leather
lungs" to put the Pennsylvania candi
date over.

"Red" Betts and Joe Murphy are
among the Stanford athletes who are
keeping themselves in trim by running
the aisles at the Convention.

The badges worn by the student
ushers are marked "head usher." It
is said that some of them have been
making the most of this inscription
when away from the auditorium to
identify themselves as important of
ficers of the Convention.
* * *
National Conventions do away with
class distinctions; men who can write
checks in six figures are in abundance
in the hall, wearing badges marked
"usher," "page," "assistant sergeant
at-arms," and "assistant doorkeeper."
It is the only way they can get into the
Convention.

The whole show isn't staged at the
Auditorium. The headquarters for
several of the candidates in the Palace
and St. Francis are entertaining large
crowds with bands and singers.
