### 
"The Sunken Bell," Gerhart Haupt
mann's world-known drama of a wo
man's aspirations, will be read next
Tuesday evening at the Little Theater,
by Marion Craig Wentworth.
A critic has said of Mrs. Went
worth's protrayal, "Thi3 quiet, fragile
woman of deep eyes, hushes an audi
ence by the tenseness of her per
formance. Her own personality drops
away; surrounding her is all the feel
ing and atmosphere of the play into
which she has lifted herself."
Mrs. Wentworth's ability to pro
duce illusions, and to make the stage
scene as plain as though it were full
of actors, is praised by Stanford peo
ple who have seen her work. In the
presence of her vivid enunciation,
wrapt expression of face, figure and
gesture, physical stage trappings are
said to be unnecessary.
Chairman L. E. Bassett of the Com
mittee on Public Exercises urges a big
attendance of students, faculty and
other summer residents.
