# WOMEN'S POOL OPEN TO SUMMER PUBLIC
## 
### 
Swimming is the only branch of
physical training for women which is
to be continued during the summer
quarter. The tank is open to the
general public between the hours of
3:30 and 5:30 on Tuesday and Thurs
day, 5:00 and 5:30 Monday, Wednes
day and Friday, and 10 to 12 on Satur
day of each week. Registered under
graduate students who know how to
swim may enter the pool at this time
on the presentation of a towel ticket,
obtainable at the Comptroller's office
for five cents.
Registered graduate students may
have the use of the pool on the pay
ment of five dollars for the quarter,
and unregistered women on the pay
ment of fifteen dollars for the quarter,
or ten dollars for the half-quarter,
which entitles them to three lessons
a week. A fifty cent ticket will be
collected from graduates who have
not paid the five-dollar fee, and from
outsiders entering the pool during
open hours.
