# FINDS THE ROOT OF ERIN CRISIS IN ANCIENT PAST
## Dr. Cross Draws Historic Background for Sinn Fein Republic 
### 
One who would understand the
present political situation in Ireland,
must trace the inheritance of Irish
history and mythology which has in
spired succeeding generations in the
Isle." That was a part of the mes
sage on "Sinn Fein and its Origins,"
which Professor Tom Peete Cross of
the University of Chicago presented to
an audience in the Little Theater last
Tuesday evening. Dr. Cross's address
was the first of the Tuesday evening
lectures which will be a feature of
the summer quarter.
Influence in the present crisis of
legends and ideals contained in Celtic
literature, was demonstrated by the
speaker. He said that the establish
ment of the "Irish Republic" by the
Sinn Fein in 1916 was not caused by
German propoganda alone, or by op
pressive legislation by the v . British
Parliament. These were at most only
incidental irritants which tranformed
the fostered ideals of independence,
ages old, into explosive action.
The glories of the ancient Celtic
kingdom, although perhaps only leg
endary, have never been forgotten by
the Irish. Throughout the centuries
the exploits of Finn and his band, the
Fiene, have been recounted around
the fire-sides and sung by the bards.
Tales of his god-like qualities and
noble deeds, similar to those surround
ing Robin Hood, passed on from gene
ration to generation, have kept alive
the ideal of Irish independence.
The history of Ireland is that of a
subjected people. The almost myth
ical Milesian kingdom ruled her for
centuries. The Danes and Norwegians
swarmed down from the north in the
eighth century. The Normans invaded
her made her a part of their English
conquests in the eleventh century.
She remains today a part of England.
National literature has nourished the
thought of independence. Keating's
History, written in the seventeenth
century, gives incidents to prove that
Finn is sleeping with his band in a
cave waiting the time to come forth
and free Ireland. The poems of Tom
Moore in the nineteenth century in
spire the people with tales of the
Fiene.
Societies for Irish independence
have grown out of this fostered pat
riotism. The Fenian Brotherhood
established in 1865 swore to hate Eng
land and work for an Irish Republic.
The Gaelic League started in an at
tempt to revive the Gaelic language
soon became political with the same
object. Then came the Sinn Fein with
the purpose, as indicated by its name
(ourselves alont), of ousting all Eng
lish manufacturers and goods, customs,
and influence. Radical leaders came
to the front resulting in the Irish Re
public of 1916 and subsequent dis
ordered conditions.
