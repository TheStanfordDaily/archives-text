# STANFORD WILL SEND J.F. HANNER TO OLYMPIC TRIALS
## Olympic and Multnomah Athletic Clubs to Send Other Cardinal Men 
### 
Coach Maloney announces that J. F.
Hanner, '21, will be able to represent
Stanford at the coming Olympic games
at Antwerp, in August, as the result
of the recent action taken by the
Board of Athletic Control providing the
necessary expenses to send the Cardi
nal javelin man east for the final
trials.
Hanner is considered the best jave
lin man 011 the coast today, and his
entrance in the Olympic games is ex
pected to add points to America's
total. It is not yet certain that "Dink"
Templeton will be sent east, but every
effort is being made to include his
name in the list of Stanford entrants.
The Olympic Club of San Francisco
is sending four former Stanford men
to Antwerp. They are John K. Nor
ton, who last Saturday broke the
world's record in the 440-yard hurdles
at Pasadena; G. H. Bihlman, who took
first place in the 16-pound shot-put in
the same meet; "Reg" Caughey, last
year's football captain, and Morris
Kirksey, who placed second to Pad
dock in the 100-yard dash. W. B.
Wells, '20", captain of last year's track
team, will be sent by the Multnomah
Athletic Club to the games. He is ex
pected to be a point-winner.
The question of coaches is nearing
a decision. There is much talk of
selecting Harry Maloney as coach of
the track team. It is felt that since
a majority of the men composing the
team are from the west, at least one
western coach should be included.
Though at present no definite appoint
ment of coaches has been made, it is
expected that the Stanford coach will
be named to accompany the track team
to Antwerp.
