# Eastern Co-Eds Plan Invasion Of California
## 
### 
Advance reports and inquiries
seem to indicate that the women
students of the eastern colleges
desiro to come to California to
finish their college education. The
various universities in the state
have received many letters of
inquiry most of which came from
Wellesley. Vassar, and Smith. A
large number of letters have also
been received from the women
students of t ; ie Universities of
Chicago and Wisconsin.
Requests for living accomoda
tions have already reached the
California universities from twen
ty-four states, and from Hawaii
and Canada. The number of in
puiries received indicate a record
braking enrollment in all of the
coast colleges this fall.
