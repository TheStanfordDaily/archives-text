# COMMITTEE MAKES CHANGES IN RULES OF SCHOLARSHIP
## Grade Points as Well as Units Will be Considered in Reports 
### 
Grade points as well as units are to
be considered in determining what
constitutes the standard work of a
student, according to a ruling issued
by the Scholarship Committee this
week. According to Dr. O. L. Elliott,
grade points have only been consider
ed in special cases in the past. The
new system will go into effect at once.
The standard will be determined
by a system of "counts," which are
either units or grade points. A stu
dent gaining 15 units and 20 grade
points in a quarter has 35 counts for
that quarter. For students in the first
and second quarters in the University
the following schedule is maintained:
A student is probationed who
fails to abtain 22 counts.
A student is failed who fails to
obtain 12 counts.
A student is disqualified who
fails to obtain 7 counts.
After the second quarter the follow
ing schedule prevails:
A student is probationed who
fails to obtain 22 counts.
A students failed who fails to
obtain 17 counts.
A student is disqualified who
fails to obtain 12 counts.
A student "failed" in two successive
quarters on the quarter's work is dis
qualified. At the end of the secoiTd
and every subsequent quarter the stu
dent's entire accomplishment in units
and grade points is compared with
what he would have obtained had he
done standard work. If he is above,
at, or even slightly below standard
his scholarship standing is considered
normal. If his deficiency is large he
is placed on probation, and in serious
cases dismissed.
Mid-quarter reports are graded as
follows: Passing, but unsatisfactory,
D; not passing, but deficiency slight,
(+ ); deficiency serious, ( —); work
not reported will be considered as of
C-grade, or the same as the student's
previous average grade (if higher than
C).
A student in his first or second quar
ter is not disqualified or failed at mid
quarter; but if he has made less than
22 counts probation results. A stu
dent in the third or any subsequent
quarter is disqualified if he has not
made fi counts at mid-quarter, and al
so is within 10 counts of disqualifica
tion on his general average at the end
of the preceding quarter; he is failed
if he has not made 12 counts, he is on
probation if he has not made 22
counts. A failure at mid-quarter
coupled with a failure in the pre
ceding or subsequent quarter, but not
in the same quarter, results in dis
qualification.
A student who has ben disqualified
may be reinstated at the end of one
year. A petition for reinstatement
must show the accomplishment dur
ing the year of a reasonable amount
of work of academic character (not
necessarily in an educational institu
tion) with such success as to justify
an expectation of creditable work in
the University.

either units or grade points. A stu
dent gaining 15 units and 20 grade
points in a quarter has 35 counts for
that quarter. For students in the first
and second quarters in the University
the following schedule is maintained:
A student is probationed who
fails to abtain 22 counts.
A student is failed who fails to
obtain 12 counts.
A student is disqualified who
fails to obtain 7 counts.
After the second quarter the follow
ing schedule prevails:
A student is probationed who
fails to obtain 22 counts.
A students failed who fails to
obtain 17 counts.
A student is disqualified who
fails to obtain 12 counts.
A student "failed" in two successive
quarters on the quarter's work is dis
qualified. At the end of the secoiTd
and every subsequent quarter the stu
dent's entire accomplishment in units
and grade points is compared with
what he would have obtained had he
done standard work. If he is above,
at, or even slightly below standard
his scholarship standing is considered
normal. If his deficiency is large he
is placed on probation, and in serious
cases dismissed.
Mid-quarter reports are graded as
follows: Passing, but unsatisfactory,
D; not passing, but deficiency slight,
(+ ); deficiency serious, ( —); work
not reported will be considered as of
C-grade, or the same as the student's
previous average grade (if higher than
C).
A student in his first or second quar
ter is not disqualified or failed at mid
quarter; but if he has made less than
22 counts probation results. A stu
dent in the third or any subsequent
quarter is disqualified if he has not
made fi counts at mid-quarter, and al
so is within 10 counts of disqualifica
tion on his general average at the end
of the preceding quarter; he is failed
if he has not made 12 counts, he is on
probation if he has not made 22
counts. A failure at mid-quarter
coupled with a failure in the pre
ceding or subsequent quarter, but not
in the same quarter, results in dis
qualification.
A student who has ben disqualified
may be reinstated at the end of one
year. A petition for reinstatement
must show the accomplishment dur
ing the year of a reasonable amount
of work of academic character (not
necessarily in an educational institu
tion) with such success as to justify
an expectation of creditable work in
the University.
