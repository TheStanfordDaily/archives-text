# CHINA IN NEED OF AMERICAN ENGINEERS
## Peter Soo-Hoo, '10, Voices Sentiment Against Japanese 
### 
The strong demand in China for
American engineers and educators is
expressed in a letter recently received
by E. G. Sheibley, '08, Los Angeles,
from Peter Soo-Hoo, '10, now an engi
neer in Canton, China. The letter
which was sent to Professor Marx,
head of the engineering department,
reads in part as follows:
"Glad to know that you are think
ing of teaching in China. The Canton
Christian College has the highest
standing in southern China and is one
of the best in all China.
"Professor Marx was right in telling
you to come as we want more Amer
icans to help us get away from the
bad influence of the Japanese. Amer
icans are well respected and there is
no military question nor suspicion
I among Chinese and Americans. To
prove this I can say that you may go
anywhere that an ordinary Chinaman
is allowed to enter.
"There is a good chance to make
money. Get agency for selling some
thing like steel in form of material or
manufactured articles, electric ma
chines, petroleum, engines, locks,
knives, etc. But all must be cheap to
compete with European and Japanese
goods.
"I should sa? you have an oppor
tunity to do good work spiritually,
commercially, and as an educator. I
hope you will come here."
