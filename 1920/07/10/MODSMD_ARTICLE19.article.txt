# BEYOND THE CAMPUS

LAST TUESDAY, a student went up to his professor to explain his absence
during the previous week. Instead of attending classes he had been
watching the sessions of the Democratic National Convention. In accepting
this excuse, the faculty man said wisely:
"If I could have taught you half as much as you learned in the week you
spent at the Convention, the Democrats would have nominated me for Presi
dent long ago."
The broad-minded attitude taken by that professor is worthy of record.
He realized that a chance to see history in the making was infinitely* more
valuable than a chance to get cold'facts of a history made centuries ago. And
the strange point) of it all, is that such a viewpoint is so rare among both
students and faculty. Our curriculum and the attendant college activities
have a tendencey to absorb our entire interests and we are in danger of
letting the world roll on by without us.
Of course this condition is not right, but nevertheless, it is a very potent
factor in moulding our collegiate habits of thought. The only way that we
can shake off this academic indifference to practical affairs is to adopt the
sane attitude of mind that the above-mentioned professor did.
