# Mrs. M.C. Wentworth Reads German Play
## Noted Playwright Gives Reading of "The Sunken Bell" 
### 
The story of man's struggle for
achievement and freedom was por
trayed in an intelligent reading of
Gerhart Hauptman's play, "The
Sunken Bell," by Marion Craig Went
worth, the playwright, before a large
audience in the Little Theater, Tues
day evening.
The play is symbolic in nature and
lost none of its force in the able
portrayal by Mrs. Wentworth. It is
the story of man's struggle for achieve
ment and freedom. Man is personified
by an old bell-founder who attempts
to raise his bells on a mountain top.
The mystic qualities of Maeterlinck's
"Blue Bird," where man's quest of
happiness is found, is shown in this
play by the German writer, Haupt
mann.
In introducing the play Mrs. Went
worth declared that it not only is of
value for its philantrophy, but also for
the beauty of its lines. She declared
that it was a very popular fairy play
among children.
Mrs. Wentworth's remarks prefaced
the beginning of each act. These ex
planations coupled with the dramatic
manner in which she read her lines,
enabled the audience to grasp the
philosophy which the play contained.
The characters were presented by
the reader in a manner which gave the
audience the impression of reality. In
this Mrs. Wentworth was aided by a
voice which is adapted to character
portrayal.
Mrs. Wentworth lins a wide reputa
tion as a playwright as well as a read
er. Among her successes is the well
known cne-act play, "War Brides."
