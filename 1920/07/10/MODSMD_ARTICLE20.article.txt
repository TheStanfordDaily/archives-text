# THE 						NEXT PRESIDENT

### 
STANFORD was disappointed when its favorite son, Herbert Hoover, failed
to receive the consideration of the reactionary Republican convention at
Chicago. Beyond doubt the ex-Food Administrator stands as the world's
greatest public servant today. Incidentally, the next administration, whether
it be Republican or Democratic, will be exercising its divine right of foolish
ness if it does not give him a high office hi which he can serve the nation.
In the coming election, Stanford voters will vote for the man who near
est approximates the political ideals expressed by the personality of Herbeit
Hoover. Party lines were swept aside here in the California primaries and
it is to be hoped that the same intelligent position which ignores hide-bound
party allegiance, will be maintained in the national election next fall.
It is with very little hesitation that we pick the Demicratic ticket of Cox
and Roosevelt as being the most deserving of the local vote under those con
ditions. The Democratic convention was successful in nominating a progress
ive candidate and drafting an affirmative platform. Viewed in this light the
Republican convention was a failure.
There is another point that is still more important than that of who the
candidates are. It is one that concerns the whole world and the question of
America's moral leadership in it. That is the League of Nations issue. Stan
ford expressed its sentiments pretty forcibly on this issue last Spring when
it voted for the League, seven to one, in a straw vote conducted by the Daily
Palo Alto.
Because the League of Nations without any nullifying reservations was
unqualifiedly supported by the Democratic party, the "STANFORD QUAD
RANGLE," as a Stanford newspaper, is confidently supporting the Demo
cratic ticket.
