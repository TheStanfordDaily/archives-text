To Mrs. Leland Stanford, Stanford
University owes a debt of gratitude
for the endless sacrifices she made in
order that this institution might live.
It was ivlrs. Stanford who took up the
work and carried it on with noble
ness of purpose when Leland Stanford
died. She carried it through two peri
ods during which it seemed that Stan
ford University must close its doors.
Sacrifice was the keynote of Mrs.
Stanford's life. When other financial
sources failed during the time that
the estate was in litigation Mrs. Stan
ford paid the faculty with funds re
served for her household expenses.
Professors and other members of the
University staff stayed when there
was no promise of a salary.
During all the times of financial un
certainty, Mrs. Stanford kept her
jewels as a fund upon which she could
rely if other sources failed. Fortun
ately, these were kept intact and she
was able to establish the famous
"Jewel Fund." This fund at. one time
was dedicated to the building of the
Memorial Church, but other resources
were found and the money obtained

from the sale of the jewels was "made
a permanent endowment of the library
of the University." The sum she
gained from selling her San Francisco
.mansion she devoted to the buliding
of a museum and art gallery.
Other institutions received the bene
fit from Mrs. Stanford's philanthropic
nature. She gave freely to schools
and kindergartens and established a
hospital for children at Albany, New
York, her birthplace.
The greatest freedom in administra
tion and teaching was allowed. Mrs.
Stanford realized the error in exer
cising too rigid a control over the ac
tivities of the institution. In order to
give the trustees freater freedom, she
started to tour the world in 1904-5. It
was while in Honolulu that she was
taken suddenly ill. and died February
28. 1905.
David Starr Jordan gave the follow
ing appreciation at the time of her
death:
"No one outside the University can
understand tlie difficulties in her way
in the final establishment of the Uni
versity, and her patient deeds of self

sacrifice can be known only to those
who saw them l'rom day to day. Some
day the world will understand a part
of this. It will then know lier for the
wisest, as well as the most generous
friend of learning in our time. Wise,
devoted, steadfast, prudent, patient,
and just—every good word we can use
was hers by right."
