# THE 						TEARFUL TOAD
## 
### 
I met a weeping toad today,
And bitter were his woes.
I paused a moment on my way,
As tears coursed down his nose.
"Oh tell me, toad," quoth I, "I pray,
Why art so lachrymose?"
"I can't restrain this acrid tear,"
Sobbed he with streaming chops,
"For bankruptcy's my lot, I fear,
Despite the best of crops.
For since there is sale of beer
I cannot sell my hops!"—Life.
