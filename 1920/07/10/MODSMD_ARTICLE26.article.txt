## 
### 
In an effort to reorganize the Stan
ford Choir during the Summer Quar
ter, Warren D. Allen, University Or
ganist, has requested that all students
interested in singing in the choir re
port at the Memorial Church on Sun
day morning, at 10 o'clock.
A unit of university credit will be
given to members of the choir but
Sunday will be the last opportunity
for registration for credit. Twenty
five students have enrolled in the
course at the present time.
