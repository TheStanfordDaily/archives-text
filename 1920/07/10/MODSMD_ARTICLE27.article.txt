# PINKSTON AND JULIEN IN OLYMPIC TRY-OUTS
## San Francisco Club Will Send Stanford Men East 
### 
C. E. Pinkston, '23, and E. H. Julien,
'22, qualified for the Olympic Games
try-outs that are to be held in Chi
cago next Saturday. The preliminary
try-outs were held at Neptune Baths,
Alameda, on Saturday and Sunday,
June 2G and 27. In the Alameda meet
Pinkston won the high and spring
dives according to the Olympic and
American rulings. He was opposed
by the best divers on the coast but
won with very little trouble. In the
preliminary meet Julien placed sec
ond in the 200-meter breast stroke in
the closest race of the meet. Both
these men are being sent east by the
Olympic Club of San Francisco and
if they are successful in the final try
outs, Saturday, will go to Antwerp
under the club's colors.
Coach Brandsten expects Pinkston
to have no trouble in winning the div
ing events at Chicago and has evert
predictd that he will capture the cham
pionship at Antwerp. Pinkston is re
garded as one of the most competent
divers ever produced in the west and
is certain to represent America at the
Olympic Games.
