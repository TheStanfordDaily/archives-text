# GROUND BROKEN FOR NEW TENNIS COURTS
## 
### 
Two additional tennis courts are to
be laid out for the use of the men at
Encina Gymnasium. The surveying
has already been done to locate them
across the road from the swimming
pool. It is expected that the work
will be completed this summer so that
the courts may be used in the autumn
quarter.
