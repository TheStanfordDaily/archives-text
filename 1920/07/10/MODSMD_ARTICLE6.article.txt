# M.I.T. IS TRYING TO ELIMINIATE FINALS
## 
### 
Examinations undergone this month
may be the last of their kind given at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technol
ogy. A committee of faculty, alumni,
and undergraduates has been appoint
ed to investigate other than this
customary means of testing the college
man's knowledge of his work. This
step follows unsuccessful attempts to
have the students accept the honor
system at M. I. T.
At Harvard University, although 110
attempt to do away with the dreaded
end-term examinations has been made,
There has been action taken to de
crease the mental strain upon the stu
dents. Daily ten-minute musical re
citals during examination week have
been instituted to give an opportunity
for relaxation to overexercised brains
and for stimulation to sluggish minds.
