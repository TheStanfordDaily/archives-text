Follow the Trail
Which Rivers Have Made
Going east on the Canadian Pacific Railway you follow
nature's highway built a million years ago. For all
the way through
The Canadian Pacific Rockies
rom Vancouver on the coast to Calgary in the foot
lills of the Rockies—a Canadian Denver —your train
trails one waterway after another — Fraser, Thompson,
Kamloops Lake, Shuswap Lake, Columbia, Kicking Horse,
Bow — and for twenty-four hours you ride through an
Alpine Fairyland —truly
"Fifty Switzerland In One"
All the way you are welcome as a personal guest, and
the question —"Is everything quite right?"—is prompted
by desire for your pleasure felt by trainmen and by the
personnel of the CANADIAN PACIFIC HOTELS at
which you may stop off—Victoria, Vancouver, Sicamous,
Glacier, Lake Louise, Banff, Calgary, and eastward.
Let us help you with your reservations — telephone, or
write, or call at the office of
