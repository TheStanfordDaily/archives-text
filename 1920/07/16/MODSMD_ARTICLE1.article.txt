A brief summary of the local drive
and the bay city campaign of the Cali
fornia Rugby Union, for the purposes of
sending the rugby team to Belgium,
shows that the San Francisco subscrip
tions, added to the Berkeley receipts,
have totaled tipproximately $3,0()() to
date.
Nearly $1,000 was raised among the
undergraduates and faculty members of
Stanford by general subscription during
the spring quarter. The drive among
the Palo Alto merchants, which has been
under way for ten days, and is continu
ing, has so far netted $1,300, with still
further donations coming in. Santa
Clara has raised $1,700, including a $1,000
donation from Senator James D. Phelan.
Over $6,000 Collected
At the meeting of the Union, at the St.
Francis on Wednesday night, it was es
timated that $6,300 had already been
collected, and that about $4,000 is still
necessary to insure the success of the
trip. Three dances are being given by
the Union, to meet part of this deficit.
The .first takes place at the Harmon
Gymnasium, Berkeley, on Saturday
night. The following Friday will see
both the dance at De Luxe, and a benefit
dance at San Mateo, the proceeds from
which will go to the fund.
Ten days must witness the subscrib
ing of the remainder of the team's quota.
The men are scheduled to arrive at Stan
ford on July 20 —and to leave Palo Alto
for New York, by special car, on July
29. A game has been definitely arranged
in New York the day before the fifteen
sails for Antwerp, on August 5. Two
games have been arranged for in Eng
land so far, with a third pending.
Another feature of the local drive is
the donation of all funds accruing from
next Sunday's games to the "Antwerp"
boys by the Palo Alto Baseball League.
Tickets to the games will be sold at 25
cents each.
