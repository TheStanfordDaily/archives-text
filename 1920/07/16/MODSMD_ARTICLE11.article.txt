# PRESS CLUB WILL PUBLISH MAGAZINE OF STUDENT OPINION
## Alumni-Student Co-operation in "Illustrated Review" is Dissolved 
### 
A new magazine of student opinion, to
be known as the Stanford Pictorial, will
be published during the next college year
by the Stanford Press Club for the pur
pose of filling the increasing demand for
the expression of undergraduate thought.
This announcement was made this morn
ing by R. W. Kenny, '21, president of
Press Club, who will edit the new publi
cation.
The decision of Press Club to enter
the undergraduate field with a new pub
lication has been made after two years
of discussion by members of that or
ganization and after a year's experiment
in putting out a combined student and
alumni publication.
Combination Not Satisfactory.
Editorial difficulties in the publication
of The Stanford Illustrated Review as a
combined undergraduate and alumni mag
azine made the continuation of that scheme
a non-feasible undertaking. Although that
publication has made remarkable ad
vancement as the official alumni maga
zine, most students are convinced that it
could not properly fill the place of a me
dium for undergraduate expression.
The title to the Illustrated Review is
owned by the Alumni Association as a
result of a war-time agreement made
by Press Club in 1917. 1 lie withdrawal
of Press Club will leave that publication
it will withdraw from the undergraduate
purely an official alumni publication and
field.
A Magazine of Opinion
Every effort will be made on the part
of Press Club to make the new Stan
ford Pictorial an open forum for the
wholesome discussion of undergraduate
problems. Its columns will be open to all
contributors. According to present plans,
membership on the editorial staff will
not be limited to members of Press Club.
Will Feature Illustrative Side.
The attractive illustrative feature of
the publication will not be slighted. The
Stanford Pictorial will live up to its
name in giving the students the best pic
tures of current interest that a corps
of photographers will be able to produce.
This side of the Pictorial will be given
as much thought and attention as the
effort to reflect undergraduate opinion
on all points that are of concern to stu
dents.
The business management of the Pic
torial will be in the hands of Jesse E.
Thrash, '21, who has been business man
ager of the Stanford Illustrated Review
during the past year.
