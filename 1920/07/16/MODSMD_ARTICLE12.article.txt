## Templeton Will Participate in the Tryouts at Boston 
### 
Track Coacli Harry Maloney left Mon
day for Boston to attend the final Olym
pic games try-outs next week, ahd to
look out for Stanford interests. While
in the East, Maloney will also act as.
trainer for the men from Stanford who
are entered in the final trials. The Stan
j ford Coach has been suggested as a
;trainer for the American athletes, and it
is probable that he will be appointed to
accompany the team to Antwerp.
"Dink" Templeton, whose appearance
at the final competition in Boston was
for a time doubtful following the deci
sion of the Board of Athletic Control
that it would not be possible to pay his
expenses east, lias also left and will
compete in the high jump. "Dink"
placed second in the high jump at the
1 C. A. A. A. A. meet at Philadelphia,
and in his best form would be a point
winner in the Olympic games.
J. F. Hanner, '21, has been sent east by
the Board of Athletic Control to com
pete in the javelin throw. Hanner has
taken first place in recent meets on the
i Pacific Coast and is expected to qualify
|as a member of the American team.

I in the try-outs as representative of Pa-
Icific Coast Athletic Clubs are John K.
i Norton, holder of the world's record in
the 440-hurdles ; Morris Kirkscv, captain
elect of next year's track team; "Reg"
iCaughey, last year's football captain, and
