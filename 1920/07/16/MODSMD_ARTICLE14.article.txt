CJOME day a statistician will sharpen up his pencil and start figuring out how
many hours of the twenty-four the average college student manages to
waste. He should get some startling results when the totals come in. Broad
statements are liable to lay one open to attack but it is safe to say, how
ever, that the college student, taken collectively, can be picked as the most
irresponsible of all humans.
This is no reflection on the good faith of the college man in his relations
with others, his irresponsibility enters into his own obligations to himself.
He is willing to agree with, all the old adages about the efficacy of honesty
as a policy, but at the same time he ignores another old chestnut, almost as
important, which makes the bald statement that time is money, or at least
legal tender. From his apparently consistent inefficiency, he seems to re
gard time as having nothing to do with the coin of the realm whatever.
What is it then that is the trouble? It is the distinctly amateur attitude
that is taken by we sheltered denizens of the secluded campus. With no
practical responsibility on our shoulders, we gradually develop a perfect
laissez faire habit of mind. It is only when work! and affairs pile up on us
in a hopeless jumble ever so often, that we realize our shortcomings in the
direction of efficiency.
What is needed is a professional attitude, bringing with it personal ef
ficiency. "Businesslike" is the pet adjective of this modern school of effi
ciency. Once that we realize that studying philosophy is as much a business
as handling wholesale groceries, we will have the ideal angle on our college
work. It is this element of efficiency in our systems that is liable to spell
the difference between success and failure in life.
