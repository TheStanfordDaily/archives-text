# A 						New Magazine
## 
### 
STANFORD has another new publication to welcome into the fold. It is the
"Stanford Pictorial," an illustrated magazine of student opinion which will
be published by the Press Club."The Pictorial" is intended by its founders
to develop a neglected field of local journalismâ€”namely that of independent
student thought. This, coupled with an illustrated section, should make the
venture a success. The new Press Club magazine will continue the student
interests formerly represented in the "Illustrated Review," which publication
will continue its work and service to the alumni of the University.
There is no student enterprise more worth supporting than the college
magazines. These are the stimulators of the current thought of the college,
and representatives of the University before the outside world. That
Stanford has been very sympathetic to this branch of journalistic endeavor is
shown by the existence here of four excellent magazines like the "Cardinal,"
"Chaparral," "Illustrated Review," and now the future "Pictorial."
As has been said, Stanford's reading public is reasonable large and
sympathetic. However, there is still room for considerable broadening here
to give these publications the enthusiastic support they deserve in return
for the service that they are rendering the campus community.
This support is by no means limited to mere financial backing. New
ideas and new writers are also crying needs of our publications at present.
Our press here is a democratic one and contributions are solicited and en
couraged from every student. The "Pictorial" and the older magazines stand
in need of both kinds of backing. Let every student help to maintain Stan
ford's high position in this field of student activity.
