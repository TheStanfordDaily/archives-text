## THE 						FOUNDING OF STANFORD 
### 
The deep grief of Senator and Mrs.
Stanford for their son found a fitting
and beautiful expression in t ho creation
of Leland Stanford Junior University.
It was but natural that they should turn
to this idea, for the establishment of a
school "which jnight be especially for
the training of California boys and girls"
had been one of young Leland's childish
ambitions. "Henceforth," said Senator
Stanford, "the children of California
shall be our children."
Senator Stanford's own ideas of free
dom and democracy led him to preserve
in the founding the basic principles of
individuality for those who would at
tend.
"The winds of freedom are blowing,"
was his favorite motto, and he believed
firmly that a generous education Should

! be the birthright of every man and wom
an in America. His earnestness and
frankness characterize his every effort in
jbuilding Stanford, lie and Mrs. Stan
i ford visited the great universities in Eu
rope and consulted with the best minds
of the age in securing plans.
It was 110 small task to transfer thirty
millions of dollars intact to a Board of
Trustees in a way to insure for all time
a use for its given purpose. Here Sen
ator Stanford's experience as a gifted
lawyer is shown. Me himself drew up
the act which was passed through the
California Legislature in 1885, permit
ting the building of a university. On the
10th of November of the same year the
grant was duly approved and signed in
the library of the Stanford home at San
Francisco by Senator and Mrs. Stanford

and the majority of the twenty-four
trustees.
Stanford University, as a memorial, is
unique in every way. from tlie immensi
ty of the endowment, which was turned
over in person hy the givers, down to the
use of the architecture of the early
Spanish days.—Daily Palo Alto.
