### Milt Hagen 
Um-m, let me tell you how a popular
song is written in New York:
"Abner, I got it a big idee!"
"Yah? Let me lookit, Oiving."
"List-en: Here's the tie-till: 'I'm Into
Heaven When I'm Into My Ireland.'
How's that?"
"Wondraful, Oiving, wondraful! But
it ain't grammatical."
"What I care! What I care! We don't
write for eyebrows. List-en to the
chorus, Abner:
" 'I'm into heaven when I'm into my
Ireland,
My land so fair and sweet.
It's the only land to live in,
The air is fresh to breathe.
And then when conies the day
When it's up to me to die,
Oh, bury me into my Ireland,
Near Erin's hefy lyre.' "
"Exquizzit, Oiving, exquizzit! You're
a genus! But just a minute—l got it a
genuwine inspyration!"
Then follow ten minutes of thumping,
jumping, cussing, fussing, swearing,
tearing, an' the song is finished. Three
million copies are sold; Abner an' Oiving
puhchase homes in Long Island; and Mo
zart and Beethoven roll over in the Hall
of Fame.
