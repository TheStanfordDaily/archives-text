# LOWER DIVISION PROGRAM TO GIVE BROADER TRAINING
## Certain Courses Required of New Students While in First Two Years 
### 
By requiring the completion of cer
tain courses before enrolling under a
major department, the new Lower Di
vision plan which goes into effect next
October is designed to give the student
during his freshman and sophomore
years a broadening and cultural founda
tion for later study. Plans for this re
vision of the academic organization have
now been completed by the committee in
charge and work will be putin opera
tion without serious interruption of the
academic studies.
Under the Lower Division plan the
student will gain a knowledge of the
fundamental fields of human endeavor
which ivill aid him in the selection of a
major subject in his Junior year.
Affects First-Year Students
Only students entering with less than
thirty units of advanced standing will
register in the Lower Division. Stu
dents who entered last June witli less
than 30 units of advanced standing may,
if they prefer, register in the Lower Divi
sion. No other students are affected by
the new system.
Registration in the Lower Division for
the fall quarter should be completed on
September 30th. instead of October Ist.
The procedure is the same as always ex
cept that the Lower Division Committee
must be consulted instead of major de
partment faculty advisors, and the re
quirements must be followed closely in
making out a study list.
Requirements Divided
The requirements of the Lower Di
vision arc divided in two parts, specific
and distributional. A single course may
lie counted in fulfilling requirements un
der both heads. The specific require
ments cover English, foreign languages,
natural sciences, history, and problems
of citizenship. Of these, problems of cit
izenship must be faken during the whole
of the first year, and English composition
must be taken during two quarters of the
second year. The English matriculation
test is required as before. One of the
two required history courses must also
be taken in the University. The rest
may be taken either in the high school or
the University.
The distributional requirements are in
three groups: language, literature (Eng
lish and foreign), and formative art;
natural sciences and mathematics; social
sciences (including history, political
science, economics, philosophy, and ed
ucation). Every student must take nine
units of work from each of these groups
during his first two years. Either physi
cal or military training is required of all
freshmen and sophomores.
Students may not register in their
major department until they have com
pleted six quarters in the University and
fulfilled the Lower Division require
ments. But since most of the depart
ments demand prerequisites in addition
to the Lower Division requirements, stu
dents may at any registration period dur
ing their first two years designate the
department in which they expect to ma
jor. Then they will consult with that
department in choosing their electives in
order to fulfill its prerequisites. Stu
dents wishing to major in engineering
must consult with their departments at
the beginning of their first quarter and
follow the courses which the department
designates in order to obtain the degree
of A. B. in four years.
