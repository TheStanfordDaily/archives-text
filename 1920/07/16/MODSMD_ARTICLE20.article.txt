# LECTURE ON COWBOY SONGS PROGRAM FOR WEDNESDAY EVENING
## 
### 
"Cowboy Songs and Other Types of
the American Ballad" is to be the sub
ject of a lecture to be given by Profes
sor John A. Lomax of the University
of Texas, next Wednesday evening, July
21, in the Little Theatre.
Professor Lomax, who was formerly
Sheldon Fellow for the Investigation of
American Ballads, Harvard University,
has been twice President of the Ameri
can Folk-Lore Society.
Professor Frederick Tupper, Jr., of
the University of Vermont, says: "Pro
fessor Lomax's genial address upon Cow
boy Songs made such a delightful im
pression upon us all that for the past
month refrains and choruses of the
ranches have been humming in our
heads, and certain phrases of the plains
bid fair to become proverbial among us."
As a boy Professor Lomax lived by
the old Chisholm trail in central Texas
and listened to the songs of the cowboy.
As a man lie listened again and preserved
them to American literature. His trav
eling fellowship from Harvard has en
abled him to reduce to writing many
thousand pages of the fugitive authorless
epics and lyrics of America's untutored
singers, lie has searched for the songs
of the lumberman, the inland sailor, the
railroader, the soldier, the miner, and
the ne√üro.
