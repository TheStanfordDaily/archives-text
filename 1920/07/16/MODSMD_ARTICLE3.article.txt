# Hindy Cashes in His Chips---Noted Character . Passes to Great Beyond
## 
### 
Von Hindenburg is dead!
No, don't cheer, boys; this isn't the
ex-general manager of the defunct firm
of Me and Gott Co. The campus hasn't
lost an enemy, but a friend.
Hindenburg was in his fourth year at
Stanford and probably was the most
prominent member of the Zeta Psi fra
ternity chapter here. He met his death
in an automobile accident at his sum
mer home in Pasadena last week. The
funeral was private.
Known as "Hindy" to his many friends
and admirers here, the deceased was a
unique figure in local social and scholas
tic circles. He is known to be the only
living being that was able to stay in
college after yawning audibly during a
professor's lecture. He featured promi
nently in several free-for-all fights dur
ing his college career and even went so
far as to carry his brawls into class
rooms in a few instances.
However, despite these belligerent pro
clivities, he was well-known for his kind
ly disposition and especially for his fond
ness for animals. Always eccentric, he
went to the point of carrying a troupe of
pet fleas around with him to classes.
His constant attention to these pets was
a striking example of devotion to dumb
animals.
Yes, "Hindy," the Zete dog, is dead,
and his death marks the passing of a
real Stanford tradition. Something will
be missing next fall when classes recon
vene and our shaggy friend will not be
there to roam at will through them.
