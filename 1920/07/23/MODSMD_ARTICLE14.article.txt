# IRVING PICHEL TO GIVE COURSES IN DRAMA TECHNIQUE
## 
### 
Stuart Walker, the well-known au-|
thor and playwright, who was scheduled
to give some courses in connection with
drama the second half of the quarter,
has been obliged to ask to be released
from this engagement. The English De
partment, however, has been fortunate
in securing in Mr. Walker's place Mr.
Irving Pichel of New York. Mr. Pichel
is a graduate of Harvard and has lately
been staff stage director in the Shu
bert Theatre in New York. He is at
present in Santa Barbara assisting Mr.
Sam J. Hume in staging some plays in
the Greek Theatre. He is an expert in
community theatre pageantry and is fa
miliar with lighting and technical mat
ters of the theatre. Also, Mr. Pichel is
a man of extended experience, having
made productions of his own at the Lit
tle Theatre in Los Angeles, at the Art
ist's Guild in St. Louis, and at the Arts
and Crafts Theatre in Detroit. He has
been associated in his work with men
of national prominence, such as Percy
MacKayc, Emmanuel Reicher, and
Jacques Copeau.
Mr. Pichel refused the position of pro
ducing director for the Shubert Theatre
in order to come to California. He ap
parently has won a place among the
notables in connection with the drama,
having written a few short plays, many
reviews for the Boston Transcript, and
a monograph on "Stage Construction,
Lighting, and Mechanics," which will be
off the press before the end of this
month.
Courses will be offered by Mr. Pichel
as in the Summer Announcement except
that Prof. Gray will continue the course
in play construction for the second half.
Mr. Pichel will also offer a course on
the Social Function of the Theatre, an
historical and theoretical discussion of
the theatre as a social agency, including
in this pageantry and the community
drama.
