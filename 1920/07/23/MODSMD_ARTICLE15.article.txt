cluded on the team to represent the
United States at the Olympic Games in
the track and field events as the result
of selections made by the American
Olympic Committee Monday, following
the final trials at the Harvard Stadium
last week.
Of these men, only one, J. F. Han

ing the University, the other former
Cardinal men being representatives of
the Olympic Club of San Francisco.

Of the fifteen members of the Olym
pic Club chosen on the American team,
five are from Stanford. J. K. Norton,
'17, who holds the world's record in the
440 hurdles, is entered in the 400-meter
hurdles. Norton placed second in that
event in the final trials. "Here" Bihl

the men representing the Olympic Club

team would be able to make the trip to
Antwerp in August following a telegram
sent by the Olympic Games Committee
that an additional $6,000 would have to
be forwarded by the San Francisco Club
in order to defray the expenses of the
athletes to Antwerp. However, William
F. Humphrey, president of the Olympic
Club, though protesting against the de
mand, has announced that the amount
required will be sent, and their repre

by assured.
