# DANCE WILL CONCLUDE ANTWERP RUGBY DRIVE
## Palo Alto District Oversubscribes Campaign Quota 
### 
The Palo Alto Committee of the
"Stanford-to-Antwerp" Rugby Drive will
close its three weeks' campaign for funds
this evening with a benefit dance to be
held at De Luxe Hall, Palo Alto. Ex
tensive arrangements have been made by
the committee to assure the success of
the dance, and good music has been
secured. Several members of the rugby
team arc to act as hosts at the dance.
The last week of the rugby drive in
the Palo Alto district has met with un
expected success. The totals of the week
show that this district, exclusive of Stan
ford University, has subscribed already
over $3,000, which is greater than the
totals of any of the other districts, in
cluding the San Francisco district. The
latest subscriptions to be received by the
local committee are an anonymous gift
of $500 and a gift by Mrs. Herbert Hoov
er of $50. The donations already in
show the Palo Alto district to have over
subscribed its quota, and with similar re-
suits in the bay districts the success
the success of the drive apparently is
assured. Besides the donations of Palo
Alto residents nearly $1,000 was raised
among the students and faculty mem
bers last spring at the University.
The Olympic Rugby team will arrive
on the campus July 26th and will hold
practice every afternoon until the depart
ure for New York on July 29th, where
a game has been arranged on the day
before sailing for Antwerp. A second
game has been arranged in England
prior to the Olympic Games.
The dance to be given at Palo Alto to
night is one of a series of dances ar
ranged by the California Rugby Union.
The first of these dances given at Har
mon Gymnasium, Berkeley, last Satur
day netted $219 for the campaign fund.
