# STANFORD AT ANTWERP
## 
### 
rPHE final selection of the American Olympic Games team gives Stanford a
* representation that very few colleges can equal. Six Cardinal track men,
Caughey, Templeton, Norton, Bihlman, Hanner, and Kirksey were chosen last
week to wear the American colors in Belgium. Norman Ross and Pinkston,
who will be part of the American aquatic exhibit, will be two more Stanford
men at Antwerp.
But there is one feature in this businesss of representation at the
Olympiad, of which Stanford can be particularly proud. That is the fact
that an American Rugby team, composed by a majority of Stanford players,
and led by a Stanford coach and trainer, is to make a glorious attempt to
carry off world's championship honors in the ancient sport.
All of the State of California has contributed to make the European tour
of this team a success. Governor Stephens gave his hearty support to the
drive and Senator Phelan donated $1000' out of his own purse to the fund.
Stanford, which is practically home for most of the American fifteen,
will have a last opportunity to boost this most worthy of athletic causes at
the Rugby Dance tonight. For once let's not kick at a crowded dance floor,
but be glad instead to see De Luxq Hall fill up. Every dollar spent for a
Rugby Dance ticket this evening will, increase the possibilities of a world's
championship being brought home to Stanford.
