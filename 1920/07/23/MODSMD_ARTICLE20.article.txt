# YELLOW JOURNAL PUBLICITY

### 
CJENSATIONAL newspapers have done more to make college people realize
their importance and responsibilities in this world than all the commence
ment orators that have ever tiresomely pointed them out to a graduating class.
The watchful attention and care that the yellow press gives any of our local
sensations is far more flattering than any oratory ever poured out before
college audiences.
Take a concrete example of this. Two men stage a drunken brawl. An
officer separates them and takes their names. If they both turn out to be
bricklayers or jewelry clerks, well and good, our scarehead contemporaries
ignore them.
But if one of them turns out to be a college man â€”wow!
He immediately turns out, to the surprise of everyone who knows him,
to be prominent in college and the scion of a well-known California family.
These details are all a matter of course with certain familiar types of news
paper.
These kind offices of the sensational press were well-illustrated this week
on our own campus in the affair that caused the withdrawal of two women
students. Working on the principle that where there is smoke, or smoking,
it was up to the yellow journals to start a fire, Stanford, as a whole, earned
a very flashy place in the headlines for a breach of conduct committed by
two of its members.
This editorial is not directed against the sensational newspaper. It must
be put up with, for it is as inevitable as the climate. What it is trying to
do is to impress the college student with his own importance. Deriving from
this fact that he plays an important part in the considerations of the world,
he must be responsible for his acts in accordance with this position.
President Wilson wouldn't dare to wear pink spats, but it requires no
consummate courage on the part of John Smith, 111, to wear them. It is all
a matter of the position and its attendant responsibility.
The yellow newspaper has taught the college man his importance. It is
up to him to live his life accordingly and not to blame the press if it heralds
his slipping from grace in streamer headlines.
