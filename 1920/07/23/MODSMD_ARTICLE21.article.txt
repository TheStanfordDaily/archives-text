# ABOUT STANFORD
## DAVID STARR JORDAN 
### 
Chancellor David Starr Jordan, Stan
ford University's first president, will al
ways be dear to California men and
wompn as the man who is ruost typical
of the spirit of western education. Stan
ford owed the fame of 'her name di
rectly to him, for it was Dr. Jordan who
carried out and infused for all time the
broad and democratic principles of Sen
ator and Mrs. Stanford. Rugged, direct
with a touch firm and unwavering, his
work is just what he has made it, a
path always to higher things.
The name of Dr. Jordan, then head
of the University of Indiana, was already
becoming well known in the fields of
education and science when Senator
Stanford turned to the task of choosing
a president. As was characteristic of his
thorough methods, the Senator went di
rectly to Dr. Jordan for a personal in
terview. Here each discovered that he
was wholly in sympathy with the other's
ideals and plans of education.
"Stanford University." said Dr. Jor

l dan, "will not be one of the largest uni
| versifies, but one of the most intense.
i It will be an institution in which excep
j tional men and women will find excep
tional opportunities. It will not under
take all kinds of work, but it will guar
antee that what it docs will be done
by the best men in the best way."
"It will be a democratic institution as
befits one with a serious purpose. The
ideals of its founding will guide its fu
i ture."
In selecting the first faculty, Dr. Jor
dan adhered to a fundamental principle.
He chose young men who gave rich
promise of fruitful scholastic lives and
1 who had their names yet to make in the
world of science and letters. Thus a
strong intellectual tradition for Stan
j ford was insured. The faculty has at
; all times ranked high and the carrying
'out of this principle has greatly ben
efited the University. >
Many names on the list of the first
faculty arc familiar to the present cam

pus community, among them Fernando
Stanford, Charles D. Marx. Charles 11.
Gilbert, Owin Leslie Elliott. Dr.
J. C. Branner, former president of the
University, Oliver P. Jenkins. Dr. J. M.
Stillman, and James O. Griffin, all re
cently retired, arc each prominent in the
early growth and later development of
Stanford.â€”Daily Palo Alto.
