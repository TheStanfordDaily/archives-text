Truth is stranger than untruth, suh!
Lemme tell you the true story of two
Stanford chaps who made the most of
their valuable college training. It seems
as how these boys wished to see some
thing of the world, so they went to San
Fran, and applied for jobs aboard a ship,
suh.
"What can you do?" queried the capin'.
Bein' fuhst class lawyers, or medics,
or engineers, or something like that, they
piped out:
"We're fuhst class cooks, suh!"
"You're hired! All aboard!" quoth
the cap'in. Of course, neither one was
ever near anything like a cook 'cept a
"puhsonally conducted tour," possibly,
but they started to "work" just the same.
But a hiking delegate from the Cooks'
and Hashers' Holy Alliance interfered
and told them they had to join the Union
fuhst.
Very well, suh! They forked over
their last few iron chips, were made
fuhst-class membahs in good standing
and started to "work" for the second
time.
But Fate was still on the job. The
Cooks' Union immediately declared a
strike. Our heroes were outa luck again.
For a few hours only, howevah. For, as
fuhst class cooks in good standing in the
Cooks' and Hashers' Holy Alliance
they were entitled to strike benefits!
Which they are now getting regularly,
suh, and are livin' off the fat o' the land.
College education is a great thing!

Dear Professor :
Pardon me for leaving coins on your
table to the extent of ten per cent of the
length of your lecture last Wednesday.
I haven't gotten over the New York
tipping habit yet.
Yours faithfully,
(Signed) Col. Um.

Have you ever seen these chaps at
railroad crossin's holding up a big circu
lar disc sign which reads "STOP"? How
futile ! The train jes keeps on going, suh !

Ah hate to be cynical, suh, but when
Ah see some of these young chaps who
seem to have such a stand-in with the
campus queens during the summah
quarter when the attendance is low at
Stanford—well, jes you look out that
you don't feel like hot potatoes next nor
mal quarter! Any port or sherry in a
storm, if you'll buy the drinks, suh!

Th' other day a waitress at Child's in
New 'S awk, suh, turned down a job with
a big roof garden show.
"Wot! Me take a job in your chorus
at thoity dollars a week!" sezshe; "noth
in doin —I make tvvicet dat much in tips
at me hashin'!" sezshe.
But Broadway lias nothing on Stan
ford. suh! Th' other day, at a stu
dent boarding house I was waited
fo' breakfast by a B. A.; fo' lunch by an
M. A. and fo' dinnah by a Ph. D.!
