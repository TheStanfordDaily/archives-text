# QUAINT DUTCH GIRLS PLEASE BIG AUDIENCE
## Vivacious Folk Dances and Songs of Europe Win Hearty Favor 
### 
The Misses Peronne and Constance
Arntzenius, with the help of three other
Dutch singers and dancers, were warm
ly applauded last Tuesday evening in the
Assembly Hall before and after every
new appearance in their role as singers
of folk songs and dancers of folk dances.
So many people sought admission that
the Little Theatre had to be given up in
favor of the Assembly Hall.
Miss Peronne Arntzenius in her mod
est way, and in simple English, gave the
burden of every song, and the particular
guild to which each dance belonged.
Without fail she caused a ripple of ap
preciative laughter at the end of every
speech because of the humorous finishing
touch she invariably gave every song's
interpretation.
Quaint interpretations of the stories
back of the Russian, French, and Flem
ish songs, drew to Miss Arntzenius the
most notable gales of applause.
