The extension of the Tasmanian State
School system of free and compulsory
education, and the increasing number of
children that take advantage of the ex
ceptional facilities provided for them,
have caused an unprecedented shortage
of teachers. In order to meet the diffi
culty, which it is hoped will be over
come by next year, it has been found
necessary to close a number of the smal
ler schools, and transfer the teachers to
larger centers. The State Education De
partment has its own college for the
training of the teachers, but it lias been
unable to keep pace with the demand.
