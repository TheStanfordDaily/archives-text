# JOHN LOMAX GIVES EULOGY ON RAPID PASSING OF COWBOY
## 
### 
The services of that great and passing
national benefactor, the cowboy, were
commemorated last Wednesday evening
before a large audience at the Little The
atre by John A. Lomax, Professor of
English at the University of Texas and
author of "Cowboy Songs and Ballads."
In his eulogy of the cowboy, Profes
sor Lomax showed that this type of the
Westerner is passing with the passing
of the wilderness, but that some of his
old trails in Kansas, Arizona, New Mex
ico. and between Texas and Wyoming
remain and are still used. Some of
these trails blazed the way for the forty
niners, and all the early settlers of Cal
ifornia and other western states. Lo
max made it clear that the cowboy was
a real factor in the civilizing influences
of the West.
Professor Lomax told of cowboy esca
pades and showed the true heart of this
reckless, dare-devil man by reading some
of his narrative verse upholding true
manhood and Womanhood, and showing
true reverence for God and respect for
the laws of man.
