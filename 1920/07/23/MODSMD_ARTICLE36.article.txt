### 
Dr. Thomas Hunt Morgan, Professor
of Experimental Zoology at Columbia
University, visited the Department of
Science here this week. Dr. Morgan
is stationed for the summer months,
with his entire staff, at the Hopkins
Marine Station. He probably will re
main in California for the winter either
at the University of California or at
Stanford, as he is on leave of absence
from Columbia. Dr. Morgan has
aroused great interest in the scientific
world through his work in the study of
heredity and variation of the fruit fly.
