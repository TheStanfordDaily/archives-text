As a result of conduct "incompatible
with the standards of the University for
its 500 women," two women students
have been asked to withdraw from Stan
ford, it was announced this week.
1 According to Miss Harriet Bradford,
Dean of Women, the action was taken
because the women concerned have per
sisted in ill-advised conduct despite pre
vious counsel and warning. In regard
to the campus rumor that the women
were asked to withdraw because of smok
ing, Dean Bradford declared that though
the women were reprimanded for smok
ing, which is not countenanced among
women students, this was only an inci
dent in the conduct which led to the
disciplining.
It is customary that when students are
asked to leave the University their sub
sequent conduct and accomplishments
either at some educational institution or
elsewhere, determines whether they will
be permitted to re-enter Stanford at
some future time.
