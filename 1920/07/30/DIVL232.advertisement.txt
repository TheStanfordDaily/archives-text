MALLORY
FINE HATS

fc./.J,- "
For University Men —
ONLY a Magician could make a good hat at a cheap
price this year—
The chief reason is, of course, the scarcity and high
cost of good hatters' fur, most of which comes from the
Balkans or Australia.
So—this season, he sure you buy a hat with a N AME
in i-t that stands for QUALITY !
Mallory is a good hat-name. For 100 years it has
meant quality, regardless of war-costs or anything else.
See the Mallory Dealer today —he is showing some
mighty smart new spring models
