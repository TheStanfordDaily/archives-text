# Historic Stanford Landmark Passes to Hands of New Owner
## 
### 
Stanford must seek in pastures new
for its T-bone steaks. Joe Larkin, pur
veyor of succulent chops and steaks to
'two generations of Stanford students,
has locked up his restaurant, white
washed the windows, and turned over
the keys to a successor. Larkin's is the
last of the students' familiar hang-outs
of former days to close its doors.
Charley Meyer's saloon, in Menlo
Park, which opened in conjunction with
the University in 1891, was the original
favorite meeting place. Larkin's, in
Palo Alto, which opened shortly after
wards, ran Meyer's thi'.st emporium a
close second in the esteem of Stanford
men. His large, homelike lunch room,
in back of the present cigar stand, be
came the rendezvous of the Irwins, Hol
brook Blira, and thousands of other less
prominent alumni.
Later, when Meyer's closed, it was
L'.rkin who bought the large, round
topped tables that had the thousands of
initials of former Stanford men on them.
These tables were unique in that for
years no man considered that he had
completed his college career until he had
put his mark on one of them. In the
Iccnter of each table were the cryptic
Greek figures, lota Gamma Phi. Pre
sumably they represented a secret so
ciety, but in reality they stood for the
'simple phrase, "I Get Full." Larkin
used these table tops for decorations on
the walls of his lunch room.
Last summer this lunch room was
closed, and the present restaurant on
the corner opened. Early this week Joe
Larkin completed a deal by which the
Hotel Larkin has been turned over to
new hands. Larkin Will retire from the
restaurant game, and take his veteran,
student-scarred table tops with him.
