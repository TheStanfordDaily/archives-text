Effects of the Huerta regime in Mexi
co arc told in a letter received by Pro
fessor Marx of the Engineering Depart
ment from Enrique Agucrrevere, '19,
who is employed by the Henry L. Dolier
ty Co. at Tampico. Some of his most
interesting statements follow:
"Oil operators are not relieved by the
recent political change. The Huerta gov
ernment is following the Carranza pol
icy almost entirely even to keeping the
old officials.
"V. R. Garfias, '07, former assistant pro
fessor of oil technology at Stanford, of
fered his services and advice free to the
government, but, although his offer was
accepted, he has not been used as yet.
"The I- W. W. are causing us a lot of
trouble. They work openly and unham
pered by the government. The harbor
is tied up as the result of the labor up
heaval. Work on the dock for the com
pany's new terminal is almost at a stand
still. There has been no violence as yet,
but the laborers seem to be supported
by the government and the companies are
standing pat so a clash is likely. As is
usually the case most of the laborers
want to work but are afraid of the agi
tators.
"The situation politically has improved
all over the country in the last few
months. There are no formal revolu
tionists and consequently things have
quieted down considerably."

Fair new faces, up to a possible total
of 143, will appear on the Quad next
October. The Committee on Admission
and Advanced Standing has finished its
work, and the lucky numbers are as
signed.
Eighty-three women applicants have
been placed on the preferred list, and
are assured the privilege of registering
if they present themselves. Furthermore,
the first sixty of the 407 other eligible
candidates for entry next quarter are
fairly sure of success.
Will Observe 500 Limit
In the case of these sixty, the Uni
versity reserves the right to bar a part
of them if necessary, to hold the total of
women students inside the "500 limit."
Some curtailment may be required at the
last minute, since all advance calculations
have to be made on a basis of the ex
pected number of women who will really
apply for registration.

thirteen of them will enter with ad
vanced standing from other institutions;
iifty-one come from high schools and will
begin as new freshmen.
