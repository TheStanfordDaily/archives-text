# STANFORD TRACK MEN LEAVE FOR ANTWERP
## Nine Stanford Men Win Places on Swimming and Track Teams 
### 
The pick of America's athletes, who
have been selected to represent the
United States in the Olympic games in
August, sailed for Antwerp last Mon
day on the steamship Princess Matoika.
The athletes who are en route for Bel
gium include the track and field stars,
the swimming team, the wrestlers, and
boxing team. Nine Cardinal men, mem
bers of former Stanford track teams,
arc among the 230 athletes to make the
trip. Seven of them, Kirksey, Templeton,
Bihlman, Hannar, Norton, Caughey, and
Murray, will compete in the track and
field events, and two, Norman Ross,
ex-'2O. and C. E. Pinkston, '23, of last
year's freshman team, are members of
the swimming team.
These nine men, together with the
nine Stanford men on the American rug
by team, give Stanford the largest rep
resentation of any American university
in the Olympic Games, and perhaps the
greatest assemblage of stars that ever
represented a single university at an
Olympiad.
The team includes men from almost
every state in the Union and from the
Hawaiian Islands. The athletes were
given a farewell send-off before leaving
at the Manhattan Opera House in New
York. Preceding the reception the mem
bers of the team, under the leadership
of Head Coach Jack Moakley of Cor
nell, paraded through the streets to the
opera house.
