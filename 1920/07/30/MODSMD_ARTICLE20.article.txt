BERKELEY has just announced that the University of California football
team will have five football coaches to carry it through the season next
fall. Stanford will have one varsity football coach. Just what does this seem
ingly overpowering ratio mean?
It means nothing.
Reducing the proportion to an absurdity, it might mean that U. C.'s team
will be five times better than the the one that will represent the Farm. Or
by juggling figures still more it would prove that the Bruins will have a
twenty-five times better team, since their original turn-out is nearly always
five times as large as the one we have here. Of course, this is not the case.
Even Californians know that the only way they could effectively defeat Stan
ford by sheer numbers would be to put twelve or thirteen men into the field.
The only thing that this battery of coaching talent, that Berkeley has
just hired, signifies—is that those in charge of the northern institution figure
they can continue to win Big Games if they spend enough money in hiring
outside support for their teams. Their logic seems to run on the theory that
a college spending $20,000 for professional coaches should utterly demolish
a college that drops a mere $5000 for this expense.
If we regarded athletic contests as we do presidential campaigns,
Berkeley's present high finance in athletics would soon discredit it a great
deal in the public eye. As soon as Wood spent a million or two he became
a professional, and Harding, who had retained his amateur standing in the
matter of campaign expenses, was nominated.
Extravagance in training amateur athletic teams should never be en
couraged, for in time it will mean that victory can be measured in dollars
and cents alone. Only reasonable expenses on both sides will give the best
team the right to victory.
