# TUESDAY EVENING LECTURES
## 
### 
ONE of the regular features of University life that has been cotinued over
into the summer quarter is the series of lectures given every Tuesday
evening in the Little Theatre. Attractive programs have been arranged in
every instance during the present quarter, well representing an institution
that stands for Stanford's culture.
The primary purpose of these programs is to broaden the cultural horizon
of the Stanford student. Subjects of outside interest, that are missed by the
ordinary college curricula, are brought into the field of Stanford thought by
distinguished speakers. It is up to the individual student to take advantage
of this opportunity, and it is one that is,-at present, too much neglected. The
student who really wants to make good his professed culture should attend
these lectures.
