## THE 						FRESHMAN-SOPHOMORE RUSH 
### 
The right of Stanford sophomores
to enforce the traditional regulations of
governing the actions of the freshmen
dates back to the early history of the
University.
Although there had been previous
class conflicts, the most notable being
those between '95 and '96, over the pos
session of the famous water tank, the
first so-called freshman-sophomore rush
was held the night of February 10, 1894.
The tight took place in the mud and ooze
of a newly ploughed field back of Encina
Hall. During the afternoon several
freshman and one sophomore were
peacefully engaged in a game of
cards. A discussion arose, the re
sult being that soon a number of
freshmen, including the class president,
were tied, their faces smeared with green
paint and their pictures taken. The news
of this "outrage" spread rapidly and soon
the class of '96 was.in arms. At 10

o'clock the rush proper began. A junior
and senior held aloft glari.-g torches for
the benefit of spectators and others of
the upper classmen mingled with the
fighters, giving encouragement. At mid
night the freshmen were proclaimed vic
tors, as they had all but one of their op
ponents tied.
In the years that followed the class
rush changed into indiscriminate and con
tinuous class warfare. Finally, in the fall
of 1910, an organized class rush was
formed, following a series of midnight
rushes and numerous painting episodes.
This rush was held on the old football
field under the supervision of upper
I classmen. Each side was provided with
strong bands of cloth and distinguished
by green and red paint, respectively.
Since then the freshman-sophomore rush
lian become an annual affair and is dear
to the memory of all Stanford men.
