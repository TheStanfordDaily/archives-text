### MILT HAGEN 
Um-m, how would you like to live the
life of a gentleman student? One of
your professors tells me that this is pos
sible at Hahvud University.
He says no gentleman evah has a class
before 10 o'clock. No gentleman evah
has more than one flight of stairs to
climb fo' classes.
* * *
Fu'thamo', at Hahvud, he says that
"A" is the mark of a successful grind;
"B" is the mark of an unsuccessful
grind; "C" is the mark of a gentleman,
sub!
* * *
Speaking of gentlemen, my friend,
Mistah. Walter Dewberry Ames, arises to
observe as how he likes to go to bed
early because he sleeps so slowly.
* * *
One of your feminists remarked quite
heatedly to me that woman is coming
into her own at last! She said :
"In the old days, women used to be a
side issue "
"She still is a side issue," All inter
rupted ; "didn't she come from the rib of
Adam ?"
* * *
Um-m, your friend, the Colonel, is be
coming more popular every day. No less
than a dozen people about the Bay have
asked him fo' the names of the co-eds
who got their "smoke-ups" in the recent
society "puff" here.
Why, in the name of Samuel Hill, don't
they evah show the same avidity of in
terest in the names of students who at
tain scholarship honors? who excel in
lit'ry ability? or even make the checker
vahsity team? It's jes human nature,
suh! (which is a superb alibi fo' our
ignorance).
* * *
It has been said that all the world
loves a lover, but judgin' by the Sunday
supplements, they love his scandal more!
* * *
A friend of mine was telling me the
story of two traveling salesmen—one
from New Yawk, t'other from London.
"I'll betcha five dollars I can tell a
bigger lie than you can!" said Johnny
Bull.
"You're on!" replied the New Yawker.
"I'll begin. Once there was a gentleman
from New Yawk "
"Go no further!" interrupted t'other;
"you win !"
* * *
Which is not zackly fair. The police
men of New Yawk, suh, are the most
courteous gentlemen in the world! (Pro
vided. of co'se, that you are an Irish
man.)
The following letta is self-explanatory:
"Dere Sir:
"How do you get that way?
"I read in your colij paper how you
say songs are wrotten in New York by
Irving and Abner—the hind of which is
myself.
"You are all rong. Kitting songs is
just like any other descent perfession.
It is like a sir-john, a docktear or dent
ist, and I objek to your ignorantz in
such classycal matters.
"Songs are grate, nobull things, which
take yeres of time and yeres for musick
to rite.
"Also, 1 objek to the way you spel my
partner's name. It is not ?Oiving? but
it is ! Irving!, altho pronounced *Oiving*
only in New York.
"Please correck this right away or I
shall rite to the House of Correckshun
about you.
Yours accordingly,
