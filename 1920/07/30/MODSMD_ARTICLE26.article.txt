# AMERICAN SOCIETY IMPROVING DECLARES DAVID STARR JORDAN
## Educator Believes That Fair Play Will Solve Industrial Problems 
### 
Dr. David Starr Jordan in a speech
before the National Industrial Peace and
Educational Association in San Francis
co last Tuesday, praised the present
American society. He declared that with
all its faults, the system was the best
the world had ever known and that each
succeeding generation was working to
ward its improvement.
In discussing the industrial unrest Dr.
Jordan said that in view of the fact
that the burden of these breaks fell more
on the people at large than on the em
ployer and the employee, the remedy lies
in personal conciliation and fair play.
Society Improving
On the subject of American society,
lie had this to say:
"To improve it is not to break it up.
Thousands of good men and women have
agonized and died to make it as good
as it is. Moreover, it grows better with
each generation, and above all it holds,
within itself the power peacefully to re
move every defect its members recognize.
Violence sets it back and progress of
civilization is away from force toward
voluntary co-operation as the basis of
society."
"These principles," Jordan said, "also
apply to our labor disputes."
"Antagonism between capital, labor t
'and management cannot persist," he de
clared. "These three arc allies in pro
duction and it is the part of management
to make them all friends. Success in this
regard is the test of efficiency. Discord
is of old world origin, continued by the
old world methods on both sides.
Americans Plain Citizens
"A democracy knows no caste nor
class. Capitalist, bourgeoise, proletariat
are foreign appellations which lit nobody
in this country, where we are all plain
citizens."
The trade union, he said, must be in
time not a restraint on liberty, but a
trustworthy and responsible agent for
collective bargaining. It cannot remain
a government within a government, he
added.
"Each employee is entitled to a degree
of permanence in service, each employer
to a corresponding continuity," lie said.
"The waste of sudden breaks falls on
both and still more on the people at
large. The long remedy lies in person
al conciliation and fair play.
"But this cure is not yet in our hands.
No strike succeeds in the long run with
out popular approval. To make public
opinion just it must be educated. Here
lies the argument for compulsory inves
tigation. If people know the truth, they
will know what to do about it."
