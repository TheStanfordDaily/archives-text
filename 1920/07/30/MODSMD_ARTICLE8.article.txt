# HARSH MEASURES BREED CLASS FEAR DECLARES PASTOR
## Continued Use of War Time Repression Works Mischief in Society 
### 
"Think and act more like Americans
again!" This was the burden of the ad
dress which Reverend Carl S. Patton of
Los Angeles gave at the Little Theater
Tuesday evening. Early in his introduc
tion to the subject, "Is Civil Liberty in
Danger in America?" Rev. Patton said
that war calls for harsh methods of sup
pression and repression, which are un
wise in times of peace.
Taking the case of Eugene V. Debs for
ar. example, the speaker said that while
the war was on, it was an act pf treason
for h.'tn to oppose, in a public speech, the
draft iiw that the Government deemed
necessary. Had Debs opposed such a
law enactod in time of peace he went on
to say, the question that Debs raised
would have teen regarded as one merely
open to academic discussion.
Was America Wise?
"Was it wise to deal with the oO
called 'Reds' in th°. way that our Gov
ernment dealt with ihem?" was the next
question that the speaker to<~k up. He
declared that many of our most honored
citizens held that we c.'uld not in any
way have helped Bolshevism in Russia
more than by the method we pursued.
"And when rve consider," said the
speaker, "that Mr. Polk, who was instru
mental in v ithholding the deportation of
some of Vne victims, and whose record as
an American is as clear as any man's can
be, all but escaped impeachment, what
arc we to think?"
Newspapers Make Radicals
"Again take the case of the steel strik
ers. Nothing that they did suggested in
any way that they were revolutionaries,
and yet the newspapers of America, al
most with one accord, proclaimed them
such, and yet, in a vote as to what ac
tion should be taken with regard to
Bolshevists in America, more than half
of the four hundred heads of labor
unions were in favor of deportation.
"There is a tendency on the part of
many of our newspapers to help perpet
uatc war-time methods and to applaud
every form of ultra-reactionary case of
lynching or beating up of men and
smashing furniture whenever people as
semble to criticize our laws and institu
tions. Can we not afford to let these
laws and institutions speak for them
selves?
"Is it wise to drive opinion under
ground ? Does that not make it more
dangerous? Do the sort of speeches
and acts that such newspapers uphold
not confirm the fears and suspicions that
certain « 112 our foreign born and other
citizens hold, namely, that our govern
ment is in no way different from that
of Bismark's and of the Kaiser's in the
days past?"
Church Is Accused
The speaker said he had recently been
to a luncheon, at which, in the course of
the after-dinner speeches, a man rose
and without a smile on his face, but in
dead earnestness, said that the Church
from the ministry to the members of
the V. W. C. A. was reeking with Bol
shevism.
"When such are the fears and suspi
cions of men who make up our cham
bers of Commerce, is it not time that
wise counsel should urge the cool head,
the happy mean, the truly American way
of thinking and acting? Is it not time
to silence the ultra-reactionary as well
as the ultra-radical by sane speech and
writing? Let us again insist on being
given the right of free assembly, free
speech, and a free press, and recognize
the difference between the use of an
argument and the use of force."
The speaker was to have spoken on
"Spiritualistic Literature," but in apolo
gizing to the audience for not speaking
on that subject, he said that although
Sir Oliver Lodge's "Raymond" and
other such books were among the so
called "best sellers" nowadays, he had
found the subject rather barren of in
terest.
