# PORTOLA ROAD WILL BE BEAUTIFIED BY UNIVERSITY STAFF
## 
### 
Work was begun this week by the Uni
versity staff, under Superintendent Ny
quist, foreman of grounds, which will
give this section of the country a new
and beautiful drive through Searsville
Lake. The lake is not now visible from
the Portola highway.
On account of the higher water level
caused by the raising of the Searsville
dam, it has become necessary to raise
the elevation of the road approximately
four feet for a distance of 370 yards.
The work will require the moving of
some 3,400 cubic yards of till. It will
take approximately thirty days' time to
complete. A number of acres of wil
low trees will be removed, and when
raised the road will cross an arm ot
the lake. That area will be flooded by
the increased waters.
Tbis is a county road, but because the
University, by raising the dam, has
caused the flooding of the road, the staff
has undertaken the project of raising the
road above the level of the flooded area.
