# MEMORIAL PLATE FROM PELLISSIER AMBULANCE HERE
## University Receives the Plate Carried by Ambulance in World War 
### 
The memorial plate and service
record of the Pellissier ambulance,
veteran of many French battlefields,
were received by Professor O. M.
Johnston, this week. Professor Pel
lissier, in whose honor the ambulance
was equipped, was a member of the
Romanic Languages department. He
enlisted in the French Army, early in
1914, and was killed in the battle of
the Somme.
Through the efforts of Professor
Johnston, W. P. Staniford, '16, and
others, a fund was raised at Stanford
to equip an ambulance in honor of
the heroic faculty member. The
money was turned over to the Ameri
can Ambulance Field Service for a
machine. J. H. Eastman, ex-'IS, who
was one of the organizers of the first
Stanford Ambulance Unit, was the
first driver of the machine.
Carried Memorial Plate
The ambulance carried a memorial
plate bearing a dedicatory inscription
on behalf of students and faculty of
Stanford. It was this plate which re
cently was sent by the French Gov
ernment to the American Ambulance
Field Service, and forwarded by that
organization to Stanford. The ser
vice record, which accompanied the
plate, lists the battles in which the
machine took part. Both the plate
and service record have been placed
among the Stanford war records.
