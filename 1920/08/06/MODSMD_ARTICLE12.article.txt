# Dr. Patton Delivers Impressive Sermon
## Pastor Shows That Man Requires More Than Food Alone 
### 
Rev. Carl S. Patton of Los Angeles
delivered a brief but impressive ser
mon last Sunday in the Memorial
Church, taking for his text the third
verse from the eighth chapter of
Deuteronomy: "Man shall not live by
bread alone, but by every word which
proceedeth out of the mouth of God."
He showed that the fact that man can
not live by bread alone constitutes
the main difference between us and the
animals. He said, however, to ex
plain the "word which proceedeth out
of the mouth of God" is more difficult.
Man lives by hope, work, companion
ship, and love; these are some of the
words from the mouth of God which
are necessary to man's well-being.
They are not made by man, but are
rules from the heart of God.
Dr. Patton then went on to explain
the universal applications of these
rules; in the case of faith, for example,
he called attention to the fact that the
world practically runs on credit or
trust in our associates. Tn order to
master the rules of God one must
form habits thai tend to advance them.
That we live by a moral as well as a
physical necessity and that we must
keep up our standard in both aspects
of life, wore other points which Dr.
Patton brought to the attention of his
congregation.
