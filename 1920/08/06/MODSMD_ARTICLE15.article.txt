# WELCOMING MR. CULVER
## 
### 
AN the front page of the "Stanford Quadrangle" today, there appears a pic
ture of the new Dean of Men who has just arrived on the campus. There
are two ways possible for our student readers to take advantage of our
running this likeness of Mr. Culver. They can use it to identify the man
that they will have to dodge carefully in the future. Or they can take it as
an introduction to the man who will be their friend, the man who will be,
by nature of his office, the dominant influence behind all student life outside
of classrooms. The choice that will be made between these two attitudes
of reception is our problem in welcoming and establishing the new Dean.
We all know that Dean Culver earnestly wants to play the latter role of
friendship. That being the case, no one but a fool would turn down the
opportunity of making a friend, especially a man like the Dean of Men who
stands a good chance of becoming a friend in need at any time.
It has been said that the success or failure' of a Dean of Men depends
on whether he is regarded by the students as a friend at court or a plain
clothes man. The thing that complicates this is student psychology for it
doesn't matter whether he is actually either one or the other of tÂ» ese things.
The facts of the Dean's real personality and methods have nothing to do with
it. Student credulity concerning the men in this office is a remarkable thing.
For instance, although it is out of the realm of serious consideration to think
that any Dean would so lose trock of the dignity of his position as to hire
spies, the myth of the "faculty spy system" is taken for granted by a large
number on our campus. Part of the student's duty in supporting the ad
ministration of the new Dean of Men is to nail such lying rumors on the
spot. All they do is to rob the Dean's office of much of its power for good.
A few rumors and a surface impression or two are liable to form the
basis for the permanent classification that the students will make of the
Dean. Such classifications are usually unthinking ones and thus liable to be
dangerous. Once that a generation of students places a Dean in a certain
category, the said Dean stands a good chance of being permanently branded
as a good fellow or a Pinkerton agent for all collegiate time to come.
With the arrival of Mr. Culver, the studentbody has a new Dean to
classify and pigeonhole. It is a most important job, and one that should not
be taken lightly, for more than likely we are settling what the official person
ality of Mr. Culver shall be for a good many future classes. We must realize
our responsibilities when we are creating the tradition as to whether Dean
Culver is to be trusted or mistrusted by the students.
We all want to see Mr. Culver succeed in his new position. But Mr.
Culver's chances for a real success do not rest so much upon him personally
as upon all of us. A sane attitude of mind that will make the student regard
the Dean as a blessing, not as a bugaboo, is, needed. The office was created
to benefit the student. Let's help the Dean to help us!
