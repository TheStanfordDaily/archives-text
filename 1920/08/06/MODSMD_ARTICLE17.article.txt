# ABOUT STANFORD
## THE 						CHIMES 
### 
"Through the balmy air of night
How they ring out their delight!
From the molten-golden notes,
And all in tune."
The history of the Stanford bells is
an interesting one. In 1900 they were
brought f o California and placed in the
tower of the newly constructed Me
morial Church. They were ordered
by Mrs. Stanford from the celebrated
firm of Meenelly of Troy, N< w York,
and were made by them.
The largest bell weighs nearly
three-quarters of a ton, the smallest
being about 400 pounds in weight.
They are made of copper, tin and anti
mony, and are tuned that they strike
the proper notes in relation to each
other. The music of the chime is the
same as "The Westminster Chime"
composed by Handel for the clock in
the Victorian tower in the House of
Parliament in Westminster, London.
The hour bell bears the following in

scription: "Chimes of the Memorial
Church, erected to the memory of Le
land Stanford by his wife, Jane Lath
rop Stanford, A. D. 1900."
Mr. McConnell of San Francisco, an
old watchmaker, was engaged to set
the hells in position. In the process
of his work he grew to love them, and
proudly described "his bells" as "the
best that had ever come west." In
th great, earthquake of 1900 the bells
fell with the church, and it was not
until nine years later, on May 0, 1915,
when they were restored, that their
music floated once again out over the
red-tiled Quad. This time they were
placed in the present seventy-foot
tower located between the Mechanics
and Machinery buildings and directly
facing the Quadrangle. Only one face
of the clock, which was made by the
Seth Thomas Company of Connecticut,
for a four-faced tower with a seven
foot dial is shown. But this is only

a temporary home, and some day,
when the spire is restored to the
church, the bells will he placed in
their old position once more and the
four pair of hands of the preat clock
will he seen from all parts of the
campus.â€”"Daily Palo Alto."
