# Col. Um Talks

### MILT HAGEN 
Um-m, er-a your professors spin
some mighty good yarns—as well as
t'other kind, Suh. T'other day one of
them was explaining the great pride
that the Scotch have in their nationali
ty. By way of illustration, he told the
story of a Scot called McCoy.
"The first sailor in the world was a
Scot named McCoy!" boasted this
"Sandy."
"How about Noah?" asked his
friend.
"Oh, weel!" said McCoy, "if you're
gonna count foreigners!"

Speaking o' professors and jokes,
Suh, did yo' evah observe that pro
fessors' table at the Union Cafe? Some
o' the wit o' the world is made there.
But the trouble is none but the pro
fessors can understand; the students
are mystified. Fo' example, a gale of
professorial laughter will follow a
quip something like this:
First Prof. —"E pluribus Unura, hie
haec hoc!"
Second Prof. —"Quo Vadis? Veni,
vidi, vincit!"
O' course, most students being un
acquainted with Latin fail to grasp
the point of such delicious tid-bits.

Another Stanford tradition broken!
A co-ed not only walked up the tra
ditionally hallowed law steps, t'other
day, but she also sat upon them all
afternoon, Suh!
It is rumored that a mass meeting
of the students is to be held fo' the
purpose o' taking steps to protect the
steps o' the men's gym.
* * *
Yo' Colonel took an auto ride to
Mt. Hamilton t'other week-end. There
was a co-ed with a supervocabulary
along. Yo' colonel doesn't know what
he would have done without her valu
able infolimation. This is what he
learned about Lick Observatory:
"Isn't this a cunning auto?"
"What a darling trip!"
"Isn't the scenery cute?"
"WHAT A SWEET TELESCOPE!"
(Whereat the man in the moon took
a swoon!)
* * *
That was rather unusual —that stunt
o' one of your fair co-eds, who ad
vertised she "lost a diamond ring be
tween the movies, Stickey's and the
Cactus Garden." Most o' them FIND
their rings there!
* * *
What's become o' the old-fashioned
strolls that you queeners used to take
up in the old foothills back of the
University? You' Colonel took a hike
uj) there Tuesday to find out. Nothing
but limousines, roadsters, runabaouts,
motorcycles! It made me feel mighty
old, Suh!
* * *
Everything is being sacrificed for ef
ficiency Suh! We can now take our
food in capsules, our drink in
tablets, our liquor in raisins.
* * *
Ah'll venture to predict, Suh, that
even our education will become cfli
cienized. In the future, knowledge
will be given inoculation. Instead o'
having a sheepskin to show for his
degree, a Bachelor o' Arts will have
a pricked skin to show where the
"Nolcge Needle" bit him.
* * *
A Master o' Arts will have two scars
on the back o' his head t'o' his pains.
A Juris Doctor will point with pride
to his fhree scars. A Doctor of Philo
sophy will wear liis head in a bandage,
Suh!
* * *
Old "Three-Star Hennesey" will be
replaced by "Three Scar Tennessee,"
or whatever yo' name happens to bo!
