### 
Dr. William Dinsmore Briggs in
speaking before the Renaissance Club,
at the Women's Clubhouse, last Mon
day evening, on "Elizabethan Lyrical
Poetry," said in part "that the Eliza
bethan lyrics seemed to him to be
more spontaneous than modern lyrics;
that most of them were really intended
to be sung; and that the poet of that
age strove more to represent perma
nent moods and emotions common to
all of us than fleeting ones of a per
sonal character. That, moreover, they
more frequently pictured moods and
emotions objectively."
Dr. Briggs said that Shakespeare
was more of a realist than a romanti
cist when he wove so many lyrics
into his dramas, and that he under
stood and voiced sentiments common
to all ages.
