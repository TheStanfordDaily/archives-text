# SMOKING IS STUDIED AT HOPKINS STATION
## 
### 
Experiments are in progress at the
Hopkins Marine Station at Pacific
Grove to determine the effect, if any,
of the use of tobacco in its various
forms on the bodies and morals of the
users. The results obtained will be
combined with those from several
other universities throughout the
country to formulate a scientific re
port on the use of tobacco.
Stanford students at Pacific Grove
are smoking and chewing under the
direction of Professor Ernest Gail
Martin of the physiology department.
They smoke whenever and as as much
as he may direct under all conditions
where tobacco is Â£ver used. As they
smoke tests are made to determine
the individual effects of the nicotine
under different circumstances. The
students are kept in ignorance of the
results in order that there will not be
any disturbing influence to invalidate
the data obtained as to the scientific
effect of the habit.
The combined results will be con
solidated with those obtained at Johns
Hopkins, the University of Michigan,
Harvard, and Cornell, to form the basis
of a report on the use of tobacco.
This report will be entirely a scientific
treatment of the conditions discovered
and will in no means be propaganda
on the tobacco habit.
