### 
Professor Duane Reed Stuart, pro
fessor of Classics at Princeton Uni
versity, addressed the Classical Club,
Thursday evening, July 29th, on the
subject: "M«dern Biographies of
Virgil." Dr. Stuart showed that in
most centuries there have been at
tempts to interpret biographies of
Virgil, but that each century has read
into his life its own tendencies; for
example, to one century Virgil is a
saint, to another he is a miraculous
character. In recent interpretations
he has come to be a realistic character
whose poetry was governed by physic
al defects and mental twists peculiar
to his individuality. Dr. Stuart went
on to explain the technical work done
on Virgil translations during the 19th
and 20th centuries.
