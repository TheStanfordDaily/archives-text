# GEORGE B. CULVER, NEW DEAN, TAKES UP DUTIES
## 
### 
George B. Culver, *97, the new Stan
ford Dean of Men, arrived on the
campus this week, and has taken over
the duties of his office. He comes
to Stanford from the Los Angeles High
School, where has was head of the
Science department, lor a number of
years. Culver was busy renewing old
acquaintances on the campus during
the first few days after his arrival.
A large registration for the autumn
quarter is expected by the new Dean
of Men. From the number of applica
tions that are coming to his office for
rooms in Encina for the next quarter,
it may be necessary to house three
men in a room.
Culver Retains Internet
Culver retains the interest in Stan
ford athletics from the days when he
was a student here. He is a friend of
Duffy Seay, the new freshman football
and varsity track coach. Culver
speaks very highly of the new coach,
who will arrive here next month from
the south
When Culver went to Los Angeles
High School he was made tracl' coach
in addition to his position in ine Sci
ence department. He replaced a coach
who had been very popular with the
students but who did not stand well
with the faculty. Tom Coleman, later
a track star and varsity captain at
Stanford, was captain of the Los
Angeles High School team, and it is
recorded that the reception the new
coach received from him was
somewhat frigid. Los Angeles had
few track stars that year but Culver
went about his work in a faithful and
enthusiastic manner, and the result
was that his team defeated all com
ers. The students presented Culver
with a stop-watch and Tom Coleman,
his best friend in the school, did the
honors at the ceremony.
Culver Prominent in Activities
Culver took part in many activities
during his university days. He was

a zoology major and acted as Dr.
Jordan's assistant on the Mazatlan
expedition to the western coast of
Mexico in his freshman year. Culver
was president of the Zoology Club
when he graduated. He was a mem
ber of the varsity track squad. The
new Dean of Men was also interested
in journalism; while an undergraduate
he was associate editor of the Sequoia
and correspondent for the San Fran
cisco Call.
After his graduation from Stanford
Culver putin an additional year of
study here. Then he went to Wash
ington to continue his studies in the
George Washington University while
he was engaged in government work,
taking the degree of B. L. there in
1902. The next year he was a member

of the editorial staff of the Baltimore
American, and after that returned to
California and for a couple of years
was connected with the city govern
ment of Ocean Park in this state.


GEORGE B. CULVER
In 1907 he became a teacher of sci
ence in the Los Angeles High School,
and the year after that was elected
principal of the Santa Monica High
School, but was called back to become
head of the Natural Science depart
ment of the Los Angeles High School,
a position he has held until his re
turn to Stanford.
Culver has many Stanford connec
tions. With his twin brother, Dick
Culver, '99, who has since won na
tional fame as a cartoonist, he was a
member of the local chapter of Delta
Upsilon. His sister, Louise Culver,
graduated in 1896, and has been an
active member of the resident alumnae
in Palo Alto, while his niece, Katherine
Culver, ex-'OB, (Mrs. Dwight Bradley),
was a member of Kappa Alpha Theta.
The new Dean of Men was appointed
last March to fill the vacancy caused
by the resignation of J. E. McDowell,
'00, who is now devoting all his time
to the duties of Alumni Secretary.
