# Olympic Team Arrives Saturday
## 
### 
America's Olympic track and Held
team is expected to arrive at Antwerp
tomorrw, according to dispatches re
ceived from the Steamship Princess
Matoika. The crew of athletes, includ
ing the nine former Stanford Varsity
men, went through the last hard work
out yesterday, and for the rest of the
time will merely keep in trim by light
work-outs.
With the team in readiness for the
tinal competition in Belgium the dope
sters are busy forcasting the probable
outcome of the Olympic Games. Local
prophets are especially interested in the
chances of success in the events in which
Stanford men are represented.
In the swimming events, Coach Ernest
Bransten of the Stanford swimming
team has expressed the opinion that,
given a fair break in luck, C. E. Pinks
ton, '22, of last year's freshman team
will win the fancy high diving and
spring diving events. In Brandsten's
opinion Pinksten is the greatest per
former in the world in these events. In
the final try-outs for the American
Olympic swimming team. Pinksten
showed such form that lie was picked
by the committc after only a preliminary
exhibition. Norman Ross, ex'2o, at
present holder of the world's record in
the 400 and 1000 meter events, is ex
pected to win those races with Langer,
also o fthe American team as the most
formidable opponent.
"Dink" Templeton, who was barred
from* the high jump at Boston after tak
ing second place, because the officials
there considered his style illegal will
compete in that event ai Antwerp, it be
ing left to the Belgium officials to de
termine whether his style of jumping
constitutes "diving" which is barred. In
the event that lie is not disqualified.
"Dink" should easily place in the high
jump, since none of the European ath
letes arc credited with better than 6ft.

1 inch in that event.
The other events in which Stanford
men arc entered are more doubtful.
Murray and Norton in the high hurdles
will probably find little European com
petition in the hurdles, but Thompson of
the Canadian team and holder of the
world's record is a probable winner.
Thompson is a student at Dartmouth
College lint is a Canadian citizen and
competing for the Canucks.
Considerable time on the trip acroos
has been spent in drilling the American
athletes for the parade which will open
the great international games. The men
have beeen arranged into squads, and
the drill work it; carried on by former
army officers who are members fothe
team.
