# Summer Dance For Encina Is Planned
## 
### 
Encina's summer dance, to be one
of the big dances of the summer quar
ter, will be given by Encina Club on
the evening of Friday, August 20. The
dance will be informal, good music
has been provided from San Fran
cisco, and there will be decorations
and programs if the advance sale of
tickets is sufficient to assure the suc
cess of the dance.
The price of admission is $1.50 per
couple and tickets will be on sale at
Encina Cigar Store and the Union
Cigar Store. A request has been made
by the committee in charge, Ed Simp
son, '21. and Wade Stamp, '20, that
tickets be purchased before the dance
in order to niakr the affair as much of
a success as former "Encinas." The
attendance is not restricted to mem
bers of Encina Club.
