YOU will prefer Camels
smooth, delightful blend of
choice Turkish and choice Do
mestic tobaccos to either kind
smoked straight! It gives you
entirely new cigarette pleasure !
Camels never tire your taste 1
They are always appetizing—
and satisfying, because they
have such a mellow mild body.'
Camels leave no unpleasant
cigaretty aftertaste or unpleas
ant cigaretty odor.
That's why we say frankly —
compare Camels with any ciga
rette in the world at any price!
