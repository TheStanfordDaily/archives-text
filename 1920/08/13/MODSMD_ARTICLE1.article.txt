# TERZIAN DROPPED FROM STANFORD AS CONFESSED THIEF
## Culprit Doctor Under Grand Larceny Charge; Bail Set at $3,000 
### 
H. A. Terzian, a doctor of medicine
who confessed to the theft of micro
scopes from the bacteriology labora
tory, was dismissed from the Uni
versity Wednesday. He was registered
at Stantord for the summer quarter.
Terzian was given a preliminary
hearing before Justice C. F. Wright,
in Professor C. V. Burke's office in
the Bacteriology Department, Wednes
day. E. H. Eiskamp, '18, testified that
he caught Terzian in the act of taking
a microscope from the bacteriology
laboratory. Bail was set at $1,000 but
on objection of Assistant District At
torney H. M. Bridges that this figure
was too low the court raised it to
$3,000.
A number of articles were found in
Terzian's room, in the Carlton Hotel,
San Francisco, by the police. Included
were two microscopes, thirty-two cans
of ether, $1,000 worth of morphine,
two kodaks, medical text books, and
medical instruments, wearing appar
el, jewelry and razors.
According to the police the medical
instruments are similar to those which
were recently stolen from the labora
tory of the University of California.
Terzian claims he graduated from the
University of California in 1916, later
serving his interneship in the Hahne
mann Hospital, San Francisco. Sub
sequently he was attached to the staff
of a Sacramento hospital.
The police believe that he collected
the material found in his room, while
he was connected with these institu
tions. When arrested here last week
he told the authorities of the loot in
his rooms, but refused to say any
thing further. Only one charge of
grand larceny has been placed against
him.
