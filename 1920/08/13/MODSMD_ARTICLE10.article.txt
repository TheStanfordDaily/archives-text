# Freshman Bibles Go To Press For Newcomers
## 
### 
Freshman Bibles for 1920-21 go to
press this week. A copy of this hand
book will be sent to every new student
to acquaint them with Stanford cus
toms before they arrive, according to
Dr. Morgan, Y. M. C. A. Director, who
is getting out the handbook.
In conjunction with the Y. M. C. A.'s
effort to help the new students "get on
the boat" a committee is being formed
to give information as to locations and
registration procedure. This commit
tee will be on duty September 30 and
October 1, registration day. There
will be men at the station to meet
the trains and others at Encina and
the Administration building to assist
the new students in getting settled.
