# LEGION DELEGATES INSTRUCTED AS TO FAVORED POLICIES
## 
### 
Partisan politics is not a proper
field for the American Legion. That
was the opinion of Fremont Post, ex
pressed at the ireeting in the Com
munity House Wednesday evening, and
the three delegates to the California
convention in San Diego next week are
instructed to opoose any proposition
to line the Legi. n up for n political
v ole.
Delegates who will go frc m Palo
Alto to the convention are R F Cher
ington, George F Morrell, ar.d Wil
liam Rumboldt. On behalf of his as
sociate delegates. Mr. Covington out
lined some proposals which are expect
ed at the convention, and asked for
i; struction as to the stand the dele
tates shall takj.
Passage of the Wasson bill which
calls for decentralization of the War
Risk Insurance bureau, and ipposes a
combination of the vocational training
n< iT'iiititration v ith tho insuran. c
bureau, will be favored. The dele
gates will get behind any movement
of the Legion to secure constructive
compensation legislation for ex-service
men.
Fremont Post's c'elegates will act
with delegates from posts nearest the
other two public health service hospi
tals in California, to secure action by
the state executive committee look
ing toward permanent care of the in
terests of invalid soldiers. The local
post has regarded the men at the Palo
Alto hospital as its special wards, and
believes that concerted effort should
be made to aid invalid service men
throughout California.
A recent editorial in the San Fran
cisco Call and Post, said to propose a
let-up in the prosecution of "slackers,"
was condemned by the meeting as be
ing "un-American and anarchistic."
The sense of the Legionnaires was
that draft evaders should be hunted
down and convicted to the limit of
the government's ability.
Watermelons were served at the end
of the business session.
