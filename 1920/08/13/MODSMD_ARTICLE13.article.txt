# FOOTBALL COACH WILL TAKE HOLD SEPTEMBER FIRST
## Veterans of 1919 Team and New Men to Report for Early Practice 
### F.R. Pierce, '20 
Stanford's new football coach, Wal
ter D. Powell, will arrive on the cam
pus about September 1, in order to
size up the footbal situation and to
make preparations for the early prac
tice which will begin on September 15.
Duffy Seay, who will coach the fresh
men during the coming season is ex
pected to arrive with the head coach.
In spite of the fact that the varsity
will lose some of its best players,
men like "Dink" Templeton, "Reg"
Caughey, "Here" Bihlman, "Bob"
Pelouze, and "Ken" Lilly, who were
prominent on last year's eleven, the
present outlook is exceedingly bright,
and Coach Powell will have an abun
dance of promising material from
which to shape a championship team.
Transfers Will Strengthen Team
In addition to the members of last
year's varsity and freshman squads
numerous new men, transfers from
other universities with considerable
football experience will report for
practice in September. Howard
Deems, '21, who transferred to Stan
ford from Occidental last spring, has
had three years of experience at tackle
on the eleven of the southern college,
and was considered one of the best
linesmen in the southern part of the
state. "Dick" Arnett, '21, a transfer
from an eastern college, looks like
a "find" for the back field. During the
war Arnett played on an army eleven
in the east, and was considered by
various eastern critics as deserving
a position on the All-American team.
Arnett is Fast Back
Student Manager W. I. Ames knew
him in high school at Ontario, and
declares him to be one of the fastest
backs in the country. B. Faucett who
played on the 1919 Whittier eleven
and was named as All-Southern Cali
fornia End is also eligible for the
team.
Of last year's freshman team,
Douglas, Sproule, and Mac Alpine will
be valuable additions to the varsity
squad.
There has been considerable doubt
and anxiety as to whether members of
last year's team who are at present
on the rugby fifteen which will com
pete at Antwerp will be able to re
turn in time, or be in condition to
play American football this fall. Jack
Patrick and "Swede" Righter are two
of these men now on their way to Bel
gium, who starred on last year's team.
However, they have promised that
they -.v ill return in time for practice,
and have taken American footballs
with them to keep in trim abroad.
An advance guard of the class of
1924, men who have had football ex
perience in high school and who ex
pect to compete for positions on the
freshman squad this fall, have express
ed their intentions of beginning their
college careers early and will report
to Coach Seay in September.
