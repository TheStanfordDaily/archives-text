# JORDAN CHARACTERIZES CANDIDATES AS UNFIT
## 
### 
Dr. David Starr Jordan, in an in
terview for the Quadrangle on the po
litical situation, characterized the
Republican and Democratic nominees
as weak and unfitted for the office of
President. He further considers that
the 3iands of the two parties on the
Leagu-3 of Nations question will have
little weight in the coming election.
Dr. Jordan said in part:
"We are all much disappointed that
Hoover was not chosen, but under the
actual conditions that was impossible.
The Republican convention was domi
nated by the overlords of the sena
torial cabal. These allowed free play
to Johnson and Wood without the
slightest intention of nominating
either. They wanted a subservient
man and they found him in Harding,
the weakest nominee the party has
ever made.
Harding is Weakest of All Nominees
"The Democratic convention, made
up also of hand-picked delegates, was

bossed by the underworld, virtually
throwing over Wilson and all con
nected with him. Taggart of Indi
ana, Murphy of Tammany, and Bren
nan of the Chicago push, had their
own way with the convention.
"Cox is, however, a man of fair
ability, a good administrator with only
local experience. Franklin Roosevelt
is a quick-witted and resourceful
young fellow.
"Both candidates are satisfactory to
'big money' but not to the American
people, who need and deserve a man
wise and strong in this crisis. Besides
Hoover, either party could have found
such a man; the Republicans in Len
root, or Hughes; the Democrats in
Owen or Davis.
Issue of Men Not Platforms
"What the independent voter will
tlo depends on what turns up between
now snul November. The only real
issue is not between the platforms
but between men and the groups which
control them.
"There is something, though not
much yet, to be said for Christensen.
He is wide-awake, has a fine appear
ance, and is master of himself."
In regard to the platforms Dr. Jor
dan said, "As for the League of Na
tions, it is not a real issue between
the two parties. The vast majority in
both hope for a league against war.
It cannot be a new league as most
of the nations already belong to the
one now existing. But this can be
amended, and with the reservations
deemed necessary it must be ratified.
"Article 10 1 cannot be interpreted as
forcing us automatically into war.
Our constitution forbids that, and any
action under that acticle must be un
animous. Perhaps, if we were repre
sented in the league, French hate and
military intrigue would not have been
allowed to force Poland into a hope
less war with Russia. Perhaps Amer
ican influence would have solved the
hopeless mess in Turkey. All depends
on who represents America and the
President often showed strange skill
in picking the wrong man. The weak
est and most dangerous part of the
League hangs around the word
'mandate' and in the failure to for
bid the use of armies in the Interest
of politics or finance. The old 'War
of Steel and Gold' is changing into a
war for oil and no one can tell when
it will end."
