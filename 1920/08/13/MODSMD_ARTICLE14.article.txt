# JORDAN CHARACTERIZES CANDIDATES AS UNFIT
## 
### 
Dr. David Starr Jordan, in an in
terview for the Quadrangle on the po
litical situation, characterized the
Republican and Democratic nominees
as weak and unfitted for the office of
President. He further considers that
the 3iands of the two parties on the
Leagu-3 of Nations question will have
little weight in the coming election.
Dr. Jordan said in part:
"We are all much disappointed that
Hoover was not chosen, but under the
actual conditions that was impossible.
The Republican convention was domi
nated by the overlords of the sena
torial cabal. These allowed free play
to Johnson and Wood without the
slightest intention of nominating
either. They wanted a subservient
man and they found him in Harding,
the weakest nominee the party has
ever made.
Harding is Weakest of All Nominees
"The Democratic convention, made
up also of hand-picked delegates, was

bossed by the underworld, virtually
throwing over Wilson and all con
nected with him. Taggart of Indi
ana, Murphy of Tammany, and Bren
nan of the Chicago push, had their
own way with the convention.
"Cox is, however, a man of fair
ability, a good administrator with only
local experience. Franklin Roosevelt
is a quick-witted and resourceful
young fellow.
"Both candidates are satisfactory to
'big money' but not to the American
people, who need and deserve a man
wise and strong in this crisis. Besides
Hoover, either party could have found
such a man; the Republicans in Len
root, or Hughes; the Democrats in
Owen or Davis.
Issue of Men Not Platforms
"What the independent voter will
tlo depends on what turns up between
now snul November. The only real
issue is not between the platforms
