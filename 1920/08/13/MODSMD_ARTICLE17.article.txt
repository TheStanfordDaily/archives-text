# COLLEGE AND PROGRESS
## 
### 
k SULLEN indifference, and even aversion to progress seems to be a char
acteristic of the human species. Far from desiring change, human beings
shrink from the prospects of any new step in a forward direction. To this
general rule, it is unfortunate that college people are no exceptions.
The colleges of the nation, however, are run on the assumption that
that they are the repositories and the first exponents of our advanced thought.
The yokelry is always willing to credit our universities with being the lead
ers of progress. They carry this so far, at times, that colleges are often
called "hotbeds of Bolshevism," "dens of destructive theories," and the like.
But, in this line of comment, the colleges are getting credit or discredit
for a condition which does not actually exist. It is a pitiable fact that
college men do not welcome progress and change any more than the rest of
humanity does. Of course, men of education and consequently broadened
vision should, but they don't.
We have an example of this tendency here at Stanford. Just now, we have
as progressive an administration as the University has had since its found
ing. During the past four years President Wilbur has accomplished a pro
gram of advancd innnovations that has made Stanford one of the most modern
and up-to-date universities in America The many changes and advances that
his administration has brought about are far too numerous for mention in
a limited editorial space. The lower division system, the establishment of
the office of the Dean of Men, a University Press, a new Library, are only
a few parts of an extensive program of progress that can be called to mind
in a moment.
But how did the rank and file of men and women students at Stanford
receive these innovations? At the least, their reception was a grudging one.
Instead of enthusiastically backing and helping out these now measures, the
students in the street preferred to stand back and grumble, and often too
openly and unjustly criticize.
No, the country need not be afraid of the colleges progressing too far
ahead of the rest of the nation. For college men, inj general, despite their
higher education and pretensions to broader views, are unable to shake off
the common prejudice of humanity against progress. Progressives will al
ways be in the minority, even in colleges, it seems. It is consequently a great
stroke of luck for Stanford that we should have a man of unhampered vision
like Dr. Wilbur in a position to put over his program for our own good.
For innovations are nearly always a matter of enforcement; the majority
rarely accepts them voluntarily. One of the important things that a student
should derive from his college education is enough breadth of vision to make
the lot of the true reformer a little easier.
