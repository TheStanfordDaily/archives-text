# HALF A LEAGUE ONWARDS
## 
### 
phrase aptly expresses the present controversy over the
League of Nations. Friends of the League may be willing to admit for
the sake of argument the charge of its enemies that it is only "half a League"
but nevertheless, say they, it is "onwards."
Epigrammatically that expresses an important truth in the fight, over the
adoption of the League that we are faced with in America. The League of
Nations is, as Franklin Roosevelt said this week, a practical solution to a
practical situation. Like any human device, the League, as first evolved at
Paris, was hound to be full of minor imperfections. But it was nevertheless
a step in the direction of progress, towards a better world.
In that light, to ring in another chestnut, we may say that "half a League
is better than none."

THE CAMPUS was painfully shocked to hear of the serious accident
that F. S. Kallam, last year's baseball captain, met with this week. The "Quad
rangle's" sincerest editorial and personal sympathies are extended to Mr.
Kallam.
