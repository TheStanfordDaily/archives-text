## THE 						OLD HERMIT 
### 
The "old hermit," Domingo Grasso,
who lived for so many years in the
foothills directly behind the campus,
will go down in Stanford history and
will be long remembered by many past
generations of students.
It is said that he was brough to this
country from Genoa in 1869 as a vine
yard expert by a former official of the
San Francisco French Dank. In 1875
Grasso claimed to have discovered
gold on the estate of the well-known
sportsman P. D. MacDonough, near
Portola. After that he devoted him
self to mining and built his small home
in the nearby foothills.
Stanford students soon named him
the "old Hermit" and trips to his
small place became a campus habit

and tradition. Grasso never lost his
dream of a rich gold mine and claimed
to have located many prospects in the
lulls. He kept his small hut and
garden scrupulously clean and took
great pleasure in marking off paths
and bordering his spring of bubbling
clear water with whitewashed stones.
On March fl, 1915, the Daily Palo
Alto made an investigation of a re
port. that the old hermit was ill and
found that he was close to starvation
and suffering from dropsy. On April
IS, lie became partially paralyzed and
was removed by Mrs. Frank Drecesco
to the Menlo Park hospital, where lie
died three days later.
Two characteristics will always
stanl refusal to pose for a camera

memory of the old hermit; his con
slant refusal to pose for a photograper
and his hospitable manner to all visit
ors. Mome-made wine of an exceed
ingly hitter variety was always offer
ed to the new-comer and to have re
fused would have been a serious of
fense.
