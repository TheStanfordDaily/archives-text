# Dr. Jordan Talks to Informal Gathering
## Difficulties in the Way of Solving Irish Problem Are Pointed Out 
### 
Dr. David Starr Jordan in an in
formal talk to a group of students at
his home last Thursday evening, spoke
of the results of the breaking up of
the European system, and of the dif
ficulties that the Irish question pre
sented. In regard to this
problem, Dr. Jordan said 'that for
these two countries to come to an
understanding "it is for England to
remember and Ireland to forget." It
is for Ireland to forget all the seem
ing insults that England has offered,
and for England not only to remember
her injustice to Ireland, but the ma
terial aid that Ireland has been to
England in many ways.
There will be no settlement through
coercion on England's part, Dr. Jordan
continued. The very characteristics of
the Irish people would not permit that,
for the Irish are "never at peace ex
cept when fighting and never fighting
except for peace."
