# Col. Um Talks

### Milton A. Hagen 
Um-m, somebody once said that most
musical comedies are not written—
that they are re-written, M'friend,
Mistah Byron Gay, author of the fam
ous "Vamp," observes that most of
'em are rotten.
* * *
Which is about true. Your friend,
the Colonel, witnessed the writing of
such a show in about a week. It's on
Broadway now and looks good for
a week. Moral: If you want your
play to run for a year, spend a year
or so on it.

This chap, Byron Gay, by the way,
is an exception to the "Abner and
Oiving" type of songwriter. He is a
Californian and is making New York
sit up and take notice. He spends
months or work in a single song and
the results are highly satisfactory,
Suh! "The Vamp" enjoyed a sale of
some three million copies. The only
thing I have against Gay, howevah,
is that he lives in Flatbush —a village
that is three days' voyage from New
YaAvk.
* * *
Gay is one of the most noted song
writers in America. He writes freaks,
but isn't one himself. He wrote "The
Little Ford Rambles Right Along,"
"Sand Dunes," "The Vamp" and a
fuhst class musical comedy called
"Honey Moon Town." His latest per
petration is "Murder."
* * *
"Murder" is one of the cleverest
songs Ah have evah heard 011 Broad
way. Gay spent several months 011 the
"murder" good tunes, and some of the
him grinding away at it in Flatbush.
It is a sort of popular song satire —a
classic in its way. The melody is in
three parts, so that you are bound to
find one that suits you and thus assist
this chap's royalty statement.
* * *
It tells how modern jazz orchestras
"murder" good tuns, and some of the
lyrics say:
With villainous glee,
They go on a spree,
Then they ruin
With their "blu-in'"
A good melody.
It' 3 murder,
It's murder,
It's wrong, all wrong
What they do to a wonderful song.
* * *
O'course, Shakespeare would have
done much better, but Abner and Oiv
ing nevah!

No, Bertram, the Colonel does not
agree with you. "Subject to chains
without notice" would not be a good
motto lor a college!
♦ ♦ *
Ah heard a great commotion on the
campus t'other day. There were many
cheers, much hand-clapping, whistles
and what not. It sounded like an ova
tion. Ah rushed forth to learn the
cause of the excitement. Ah expected
to find this enthusiastic reception ac
corded to Mistah Herbert Hoover, or
Mistah Cox, or Mistah Harding. Or
the new Dean of Men. So wild and
warm was the demonstration!
Ah was mistaken. It was simply
two co-eds breaking Stanford tradi
tion bv walking down the law steps.
The applause they got will probably
prove to be their greatest college
activity.

Stickey Wilson is a mighty fine ex
ample of a successful Stanford man.
Many years ago as a stude, he stahted
a little candy store on the campus in
order to help put his way through col
lege. The co-eds were mighty sweet
011 his sweets, so he prospered.
i. C tt:
Today Stickey's candies are sold all
over the west, he has four stores and
is capitalized at a large slice of a
million dollahs! lie calls his choco
lates "The Candy With a College
Education." It sure pays to go to
college, Suh!
