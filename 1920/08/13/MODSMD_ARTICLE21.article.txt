# De Brunoff's Work On Aviation of Interest In Library Additions
## 
### 
Many of the books received and
catalogued by the library this week
are in foreign languages. Probably
the most interesting of these books
is a complete record of aviation during
the great war. It is a French book
by De Brunoff called "L'Aeronautic
Pendant la Guerre Mondiale." Another
very interesting book is an English-
Croatian and Croatian-English dic
tionary. Other books in foreign lan
kuages are: "Storia Delia Terratolo
gia," Taruffin; "Handbuk der Radio
logic," Marx; "Le Roman de Fauvel,"
Du Bus; "Scritti di Francesco de
Sanctis," Ferrarelli; "Historia de la
Fuenga Y Literatura Castellana,"
Frauca; and "Correspondence of Ci
cero," Tyrell and Purser.
An article on California's Anti-
Japanese Legislation in the Literary
Digest for July 31, is probably the
most interesting, to people of this
locality, of any of the stories in last
week's priodicals. Other articles
catalogued are: "Cantu Defies Huerta,"
Argonaut, August 7; "How Harding
and Cox Stand on the Big Issues,"
"$600,000,000 More Rail Wages to
Pay," "China's Blunt Speech to Brit
ain," and "Journalism is not a Rest
ful Profession" in the Literary Digest
for July 31. The same periodical for
August 7 contains: "Russia Compelling
Recognition," "A Cup \Victory that
Cheers, Resolute vs. Shamrock," "Why
Italy Grew Cold to the Allies," "The
Prison's Opportunity," "Everybody's
Picking on the Third Party," and
"Back to the Days of Barter."
