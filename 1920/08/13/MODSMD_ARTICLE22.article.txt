# Lower Speed Limit Is Sought in Palo Alto
## 
### 
Authority for lowering the speed
limit between the railroad crossing
at the Southern Pacific station and
the junction of University Avenue and
the San Jose highway, is being sought
at the request of the Palo Alto City
Council. At present this stretch of
road is considered as a highway with
a speed limit of thirty miles an hour.
According to the City Council, how
ever, the number of pedestrians and
vehicles using the road make this
speed limit too high for safety. A
communication from District Attorney
C. C. Coolidge to the City Council
said that he was unable to declare it
either i "business district" or a "close
ly built-up district," but that he would
continue his search for a "reasonable
and proper" clause of the vehicle act
by which the speed limit can be lower
ed there.
