# PASSAGE FROM ACTS IS REVEREND'S TEXT
## 
### 
Rev Carl S. Patton of Los Angeles,
in his convincingly logical sermon de
livered last Sunday in the Memorial
Church, took for his text a passage
from Acts, using as the basic idea of
his sermon an explanation of the "un
known God" there mentioned. He said
that in reality, God is not an unknown
force; that we know him as well as
we know anything in life, for there is
nothing which we can master absolute
ly in all details. We know different
forces in life, he went on to say, by
their manifestations; in this same way
we know God whose manifestations
are all about us.
â€¢ Dr. Patton has awakened great in
terest here by the sermons he has
delivered the past three Sundays and
his congregation will regret to have
him leave Stanford.
