# Baseball Captain Hurt in Accident
## 
### 
Floyd S. Kallam, '21, captain of the
1920 varsity baseball team, was seri
ously injured in San Francisco last
week, when he fell from a scaffold
ing on which he was working. Kal
lam sustained a broken leg, a frac
tured skull, and internal injuries. The
attending physicians declare that it
was only perfect physical condition
which saved his life. It is doubtful
whether Kallam will be able to par
ticipate again in any athletics and
there is a possibility that he will be
lame for life, according to reports.
Kallam is one of the fastest infield
ers that ever played on a Stanford
baseball varsity, and ranks with such
former cardinal infielders as Hugh Gal
loway and "Zeb" Terry. Besides being
a fast infielder and clever base run
ner, he was one of the best hitters on
the team. He is a member of Skull
and Snakes, and of the Theta Xi fra
ternity.
