With the track and field events of the
Olympic Games at Antwerp nearing com
pletion, the team representing the United
States has amassed nearly twice as
many points as the nearest competitor,
Finland, and the names of four Stan
ford athletes appear among the list of
those athletes who are adding points to
the American score.
Kirksey, Norton, Murray, and Tem
pleton .have all placed in final events.
Kirksey Second in Century
In the 100-meter event, Morris Kirk
sey, '18, captain-elect |pf next gear's
track team, finished second to his time
honored rival, Charles Paddock, of the
University of Southern California. Kirk
sey is running for the Olympic Club of
San Francisco. The time of the event
was 10 4-5 seconds. Kirksey has likewise
qualified for the finals of the 200-meter
event.
John K. Norton, '17, also representing
the Olympic Club, took second place in
the 440-meter hurdles. F. F. Loomis

event, established a new world's record

event was no surprise. In the final try
outs for the Olympic games the two ath

time was a whole second slower. Nor

Pacific Coast, broke the world's record
in the 440-vard hurdles.

this event by Earl Thomson, of Dart
