# STANFORD ATHLETES ARE POINT WINNERS AT OLYMPIC GAMES
## Norton, Kirksey and Murray Place for Americans in Track Events 
### 
With the track and field events of the
Olympic Games at Antwerp nearing com
pletion, the team representing the United
States has amassed nearly twice as
many points as the nearest competitor,
Finland, and the names of four Stan
ford athletes appear among the list of
those athletes who are adding points to
the American score.
Kirksey, Norton, Murray, and Tem
pleton .have all placed in final events.
Kirksey Second in Century
In the 100-meter event, Morris Kirk
sey, '18, captain-elect |pf next gear's
track team, finished second to his time
honored rival, Charles Paddock, of the
University of Southern California. Kirk
sey is running for the Olympic Club of
San Francisco. The time of the event
was 10 4-5 seconds. Kirksey has likewise
qualified for the finals of the 200-meter
event.
John K. Norton, '17, also representing
the Olympic Club, took second place in
the 440-meter hurdles. F. F. Loomis
of the Chicago A. A., who won the
event, established a new world's record
of 54 second fiat. The outcome of the
event was no surprise. In the final try
outs for the Olympic games the two ath
letes finished in the same order, but the
time was a whole second slower. Nor
ton, in the preliminary trials on the
Pacific Coast, broke the world's record
in the 440-vard hurdles.
Feg Murray Places Third
"Feg." S. Murray, '16, a former team
mate of Norton's and while at Stanford
a competitor in the same events, finished
third in the finals of the 110-meter
hurdles. He was sent to the Olympic
Games by the New York Athletic Club.
Another world's record was broken in
this event by Earl Thomson, of Dart
mouth College, a member of the Cana
dian team, who won the event in 14 4-5
seconds.
Thomson Formerly Ran for U. S. C.
Although disqualified in the high jump
because of an alleged illegality of style,
Dink Templeton, '18, qualified for the
finals of" the broad jump, repeating his
surprise of the trials by again outjump
ing Merchant, his California rival, who
failed to qualify. .In the finals Dink
placed fourth.
Templeton Barred from High Jump
Templeton was barred from the high
jump at the final trials at Cambridge,
Mass., aftering taking second place in
that event, when the. judges declared
that his style was illegal. It was claimed
that Templeton's form constituted "div
ing." lie is the second man from Stan
ford to be barred in an Olympiad in
that event. In the 1912 games at Stock
holm, George Horine '14, was disquali
fied for the same offense after breaking
the world's record in the high jump in
practice for the games.
In the finals Tuesday, R. W. Landon
of the N. Y. A. C. established a new
Olympic game record in the high jump,
clearing the bar at 1.94 meters (6 feet
3/t inches). 11. P. Muller of the 1920
California freshman team tied for second
place with Ekelund of the Swedish team;
height 1.90 meters.
The failure of "Here" Bihlman to
qualify in the 16-lb. shot-put surprised
the dopesters of that event. Bihlman is
capable of better distance than that
which qualified in the finals. A possible
explanation is the fact that the French
officials caused the entrants to believe
that they were actually competing when
in fact they were warming up.
In the events yet to take place, Mor
ris Kirksey is regarded as a probable
winner and at least a sure point winner
in the 200-meter event. In the final
trials he nosed out Paddock, and, barr
ing a "dark horse" there is no mem
ber of a foreign team who has shown
equal speed. In the swimming events
C. E. Pinkston, '22, and Norman Ross,
ex-'2O, are regarded as certain of win
ning at least a part of their events.
