# APPOINTMENT OFFICE WANTS INFORMATION
## Mrs. Snell Asks Graduates to Furnish Necessary Employment Data 
### 
Letters have been sent from the Ap
pointment office to all prospective grad
uates for this quarter requesting them
to register with the office whether they
need its services at present or not. Mrs.
Elizabeth B. Snell, the appointment sec
retary. is making every possible effort to
have all Stanford graduates registered
there and to have them keep the office
informed as to their work and where
abouts.
Reasons for Registering
â€¢ The letter gives the following reasons
for registering with the appointment
office:
1 Because your records will then be
easily and quickly available if you ever
need them.
2. Because your professors write the
best recommendations for you when they
know you best, which is at the close of
your university career.
.3. Because no one can predict what
the future holds. The professors on
whom you intend to depend for help,
should you ever need it, may not be here
to speak for you if you delay even so
much as one short year.
The appointment office endeavors to
keep track of graduates throughout their
life as well as placing them on gradu
ation. Frequently the office receives
calls to till positions which require men
of long experience. To till these the
office must have the record of Stanford
men after their graduation.
