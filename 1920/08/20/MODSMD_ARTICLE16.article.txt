# EXAMINATIONS AND EDUCATION
## 
### 
IT takes no mental giant to point out the evils and inconsistencies in our system
of final examinations. Anyone will admit the arguments that they are not
fair tests of one's knowledge, that they produce undesirable "cramming," and that
they bring about unlimited opportunities for the cheating evil. But after he has
admitted them, what is he going to do about it?
Under the system of popularized education, it seems that nothing can be done
about it. Our colleges cannot accommodate all who seek higher education. Some
limitation on numbers must be set and scholarship is the most logical means of
determining who is to bq educated and who is not. For education, if it is to be
limited at all, should be given to those to whom it is doing the most good.
At present, the only means that has been found to distinguish between good
scholarship and bad is the system of examinations. We have a few substitutes,
such as daily recitations, term papers, and the like, but they are incapable of'
general application. The examination seems to be inevitable for the present-day
college student.
The cheating evil is a still more grievous one, but it has been practically elimi
nated in several universities through the institution of the "honor system." We
could easily afford to pass up the concerts if we could only get the whole-hearted
adoption of such a system here at Stanford.
As long as we have to put up with examinations, it is only sensible that we
should at least try to make them in some way tests of our knowledge, instead of
our cleverness at unfair methods. Even if we can't get rid of the mental strain
that comes with the final ex., we have a good chance to eliminate a good deal of
the moral strain through the adoption of the "honor system" in all departments.
If we do that next year we will be removing the temptation to academic
dishonesty, and that is unquestionably the worst feature of the examination
system.
