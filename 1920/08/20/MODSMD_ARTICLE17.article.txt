# THE
						APPOINTMENT SECRETARY
## 
### 
Stanford is one of the few colleges in the United States that trains a man
and then finds him a job where he can use his training. The office of the Ap
pointment Secretary, developed during the last few years, fulfills this latter func
tion. Mrs. Snell, in charge of this department of the Administration, is placing
Stanford men and women daily in situations ranging from part-time gardening
jobs to the most highly-paid positions open to the college graduate.
The charge is often laid against our colleges that they do not prepare their
graduates for after-life and that hey leave them stranded with a useless bit of
sheepskin. A recent book, "Salt," by Charles Norris, is an excellent example of
this popular indictment of the American university. The Appointment Secretary
at Stanford is an open disavowal of this.
Mrs. Snell has invited all of this summer's candidates for graduation to register
at the Appointment Office. It is their duty to themselves to take advantage of
this offer.
