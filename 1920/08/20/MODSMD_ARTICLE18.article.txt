# ABOUT STANFORD
## THE
						PALO ALTO FARM 
### 
Senator Stanford was always a great
lover of fine horses. He became a keen
observer of tbeir characteristics and a
firm believer in the great possibilities of
development through training. In 1877
he established the Palo Alto Stock' Farm,
which, by reason of the original system
of training carried out and the remark
able results achieved, became famous
the country over.
The "kindergarten" for the weanlings,
short-distance track for the development
of speed, and the infusion of thorough
bred blood were the main features of
the Palo Alto system. The farm <if ten
thousand acres had two trotting depart
ments, one at Palo Alto, one at Vina
Ranch. There was also a thoroughbred
department at Palo Alto. In all, the
farm contained in stables and pasture
over a thousand finely bred horses. The
trotting department, of most interest to
visitors, was situated one-half mile west
of the quadrangle, a village in itself,
with its large barns, rows of stables,
paddocks, feed mill and blacksmith shop,
cottages for employes, and perfectly kept
mile and quarter-mile track-.
Senator Stanford would often sit in a
large chair in the center of the track
ring and have his favorites brought out
for a trial. It was while watching one
of these fast trotters, an animal which
had the enormous stride of twenty-three

feet, that he conceived the idea of taking
pictures in motion. The services of a
skilled photographer was secured and an
ingenious system of cameras worked by
electricity was arranged. Thus an in
stantaneous view of the animal was given
as he passed the home line. The sen
ator spent $40,000 in these experiments
alone. They resulted in overthrowing
all previous notions on the subject, and
the book which he had written and pub
lished, "The Horse in Motion," was a
valuable contribution to science.
Palo Alto Stock Farm was the home
of many celebrated horses. The great
Electioneer, Arion, Sunol, Palo Alto,
Advertiser, and may others less famous
were bred here.
"I became interested in thoroughbred
horses," Senator Stanford once said,
"through ill-health. My doctor had
ordered a vacation for me. I could not
leave, so I bought a little horse that
turned out to be remarkably fast, and it
was in the using of it that 1 became in
terested in the study of the horse." He
devoted a considerable portion of his
vast fortune to this enterprise. The
annual sale from the farm was one of
the greatest events in the world of
horses.
It is of interest to note that the once
famous Palo Alto Stock Farm is now
being used for the breeding of fine
cattle.
