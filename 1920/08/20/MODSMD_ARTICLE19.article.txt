Utn-m. news comes here of the appli
cation of a few more universities for
chapters of '"Hammer and Coffin," the
Stanford society that publishes "The
Chaparral." (For the benefit of visiting
professors, grads from other colleges,
Federal students, Frosh who come here
in the summer to escape "initiation ex
ercises,"—"The Chaparral" is not a tree,
nor a roadhouse, nor a racer, nor a new
type of "Sticky" chocolate! It is one
of the leading college comics of Amer
ica, or rather used to be before grim
war made it less comical.)
* * *
This news brings to mind, Suh, that
The Chaparral has quite a crowd of
alumni that are doing big things in the
world today. Time was, in the days
when Jack McDowell compiled statistics,
that Hammer and Coffin always ranked
last in point of scholarship among the
various campus societies. And by a
strange coincident, "The Chaparral" also
ranked last among the Stanford publi
cations in point of scholarship. To be
a member of Hammer & Coffin was con
sidered to mean that you were a superb
"800 Zound" and nothing much else,
Suh!
* * *
Here are the names of some of these
so-called "800 Zounds" of today: Wal
lace Irwin, Will Irwin, Bruce Bliven
(managing editor of the New York
Globe), Milton Gunst (Cigar Magnate),
M. M. Stearnz (short story writer),
Gerold Robinson (associate editor The
Freeman), Judge Oppenheim, Del Rey
nolds (R. R. Administration Dollar-a
year man), Dennison Clift (short story
and scenario writer), Robert Duffus
("Globe" editorial writer), Ike Russell
(prominent New York journalist),
Ralph Renaud (magazine editor), Frank
Hill (chief editoral writer, N. Y. Globe).
Lester Summerfield (district attorney
in Nevada), Bristow Adams ("Father
of The Chaparral"—an honor in itself—
and prominent Government official),
Virgil Bellows (noted artist, now de
ceased), George Morell (publisher The
Palo Alto Times), Feg Murray (artist
with "Judge), etc. These are all that
yo' Colonel knows off-hand.

Genius cannot be measured by "A's,
B's, C's and D's," it has its own alphabet.
O'course, neither can it be measured by
gallons and quarts—it would hardly be
considered "dry" wit to do so.
* * *
Ah had the pleasure of seeing Bruce
Bliven and his Stanford "gang" on the
Globe rather frequently. There were
Frank J. Taylor, Maxwell Anderson,
Robert Duffus, and Frank Hill. They're
a splendid crowd and are forming the
nucleus of literary group that is making
New York sit up and take notice. They
're men of liberal views and it's a liberal
education to talk with them.
* * *
Ah remember meeting Bliven and
Duffus at the Lyric theatre one after
noon. The show was a fine entertain
ment known as "What's In a Name,"
Suh. They were just like two school
boys off on a lark playing hookey.
Duffus was feverishly looking through
his program, trying to find the plot of
the play; Bliven was pulling up a pair of
opera-glasses on a chain from the scat
before him, which clanked like a bucket
being hoisted from a well, and he asked
me, "Wanna drink. Um? Wanna drink?
They're a mighty unassuming bunch—
no false dignity. Bliven wears a vicious
mustache, However, lie explained the
taint to me one day.
"When I was managing editor of
'Printer's Ink,'" he said, "a big business
man came in one day an' said, 'Hoy,
page the editor'! Since then I have
worn this nom de plume."
* * *
Geroid Robinson, known as "Jerry"
on the campus, is doing brilliant work 011
the radical journals. He has contributed
to the "London Nation," was associate
editor of the "Dial" and is now prac
tically the whole works on the "Free
man." He is a deadly serious chap when
he's serious and a lively humorous chap
when he's humorous.
* * *
Speaking of funny remarks reminds
me of what a mighty clever Stanford
chap—Lance Warren, cablfcd home from
the front at the time of the armistice:
"Demobilized, deloused, DFLTGH I LD."
