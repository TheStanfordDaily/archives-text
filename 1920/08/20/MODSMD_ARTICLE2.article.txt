## Laird, '13, Tells Troubles in the Fields of West Virginia

Civil Engineering and Mining gradu
ates who want strenuous work are sure
of a job in the West Virginia coal fields
according to William A. Laird, '13, sup
erintendent of the Carter Coal Com
pany's Caretta Mine in McDowell coun
ty. West Virginia. Following are parts
of his letter to Dr. Marx, telling of the
conditions there:
"After being discharged I went with
Carter, one of my fellow officers in the
Engineer Corps, to take the job he prom
ised me in his father's coal mines. I
started laying rails in the lowest level
of one of the mines. The next day I
went with the fire-boss inspecting gas
conditions.
"And let me tell you that the Olympic
committee overlooked their best bet in
not picking him for endurance running.
The amount of ground we covered over
all kinds of obstacles was amazing. Later
1 picked slate. Then ran up electric
wires. In fact I tackled every job there
was on the place, and the hardest of all
was a shift I spent on the coal cutting
machine.
"About this time I was beginning to
wonder where the good job Carter had
promised me was. But on the 15th of
February 1 was rewarded by being made
superintendent of the Carter Mine where
I am now. Then 1 thought ill my
troubles were over. But when I took
control I found a magnificent system of
graft in operation all down the line. In
putting a stop to it I had to fire some
otherwise good men and naturally antag
onized the whole force. Consequently
1 have had a steady round of motor
troubles, breakdowns, and flooding in
the lower levels.
"Most of the workmen around here
are illiterates and easily led into dis
turbances. They have absolutely no re
spect for property so you can imagine
the damage thev have doing The
