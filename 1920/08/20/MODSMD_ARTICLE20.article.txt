"The Investigation of the Increased
Cost of Living Among California Oil
Workers," made by Horace W. Cutler,
'20, a graduate of the Economics Depart
ment, was accepted as the official report
of the increased cost of living by the
President's Mediation Commission's
joint conference with the wonters and
operators.
The chairman of the General Com
mittee of Oil Operators of California,
Mr. A. L. Weil, vice-president of the
General Petroleum Corporation, and a
renown authority on mining law and
water rights, says of Cutler's results:
I placed this Investigation in charge of
Mr. Cutler, and found him industrious,
intelligent and exact in gathering a vast
amount of material, and in intelligently
presenting it. The work done by him
was of a character that the results of
the work of the statisticians on the other
side, which varied considerably from
those of Mr. Cutler, were, by mutual
consent, abandoned, and Mr. Cutler's
statistics used by both sides for the final
contract.
The general increase in the cost-of-liv
ing from May 1919 to May 1920 was
approximately 15 per cent. The former
base of roustabout labor in the oil fields
was $5.00 per day and was increased to
$5.75.
At present Mr. Cutler is engaged in
writing a series of articles concerning
the investigation he made, and their first
publication will be made in the "Mining
and Oil Bulletin," the official monthly
magazine of the Chamber of Mines and
Oil.
