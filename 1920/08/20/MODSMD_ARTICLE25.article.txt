and fugues for the organ; some sketches
by Lemare, and a selection from Sjogren.
This program will be repeated on Tues
day, August 24.
The entire program for these concerts
is as follows:
Sketch in F minor Schutnan

Evening
Cuckoo
Fantasia Emil Sjogren
At the recital to be given on Thursday
afternoon Mr. Allen will play the Grail
March from "Parcifal," and also the
94th Psalm by Julius Reubke.
The Grand Sonata is considered to
be one of the greatest compositions ever
wfitten for the organ. It is written in
four sections which correspond to the
four parts of the Psalm itself. These
passages are linked together in such a
way that the movement flows along with
out pause or interruption. The whole
forms a very impressive composition.
All the selections to be given are as
follows:
Grand Sonata, "The 94th Psalm "..Reubke
Invocation Salome
March to the Holy Grail, from
"Parcifal" Richard Wagner
