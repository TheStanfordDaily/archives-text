# CAMPUS PROPERTY RUMORED LIABLE TO COUNTY TAXATION
## 
### 
According to an opinion expressed by
Clyde E. Seavey, tax expert and mem
ber of the State Board of Control in
Sacramento, Stanford is now subject to
taxation by Santa Clara County. Since
1901 the University has been exempt
from taxation. According to a state
ment made by Seavey, the charging of
tuition by the Trustees violates the con
dition under which the exemption was
granted, and makes the property liable
to taxation.
District Attorney Coolidge, of San
Jose, has issued a statement in direct
opposition to that of Seavey. He says
that since, despite its tuition fees, Stan
ford is a non-profit institution, it is
therefore exempt from county taxation.
According to Comptroller A. E. Roth
at Stanford University, a general act
was passed by the State Legislature in
1915 covering all educational institutions,
exempting them from taxation irrespec
tive of the earlier act. Stanford Uni
versity, he said, is protected by the 1915
legislation, according to his belief.
The tuition fee system at Stanford
went into effect last January in order to
provide for the increases made in sal
aries of the teaching force. The move,
according to Roth, was taken only after
careful study of all legal angles by the
trustees.
President Ray Lyman Wilbur, being
away on vacation, was not available for
an interview on the question. No infor
mation concerning Seavey's opinion had
reached the University.
