# ROYALISTS STRONG IN GERMANY, SAYS PROFESSOR LUTZ
## History Professor Narrates Experience in Berlin After Armistice 
### 
"There is a strong monarchist party
in Germany which is well equipped with
money and we shall hear from them
again," said Professor Ralph H. Lutz,
06, in an address on "Personal Exper
iences in Berlin After the Signing of the
Armistice," in the Little Theater, Tues
ady evening. Lutz was a member of the
American Military Mission in Berlin,
early in 1919 and witnessed the Sparl
icist revolts of January and March.
"The Sparticist revolts were put down
by volunteers recruited from the middle
class. The great German military ma
chine which was able to assemble 205
divisions in March 1918 had so degen
erated that it couldn't raise three divi
sions to defend the government in 1919."
Professor Lutz declared that soviets
were formed in Germany after the
armistice. These organizations voted
for the establishment of a democracy.
The refusal of the Kaiser to abdicate
in March 1918 cost his house the
dynasty, according to Professor Lutz.
He said the Kaiser is still liked by
many thousands of Germans but the
Crown Prince is hated by all.
When the Peace Treaty was made
public, it caused much bitterness in Ger
many. Members of the American 'Mili
tary Mission were accosted on the street
by angry Germans with cries of "a just
peace", and "remember the fourteen
points." Professor Lutz praised the
enterprise of the German government in
publishing copies of the Treaty within
forty-eight hours after it was received
in Berlin, while it was not made public
in the United States for several months.
According to the speaker, Germany
was facing starvation when the armistice
was signed. The rich were able to oh-
tain food while the poor could not. A
good crop last year saved the country
from famine.
Tn spite of large losses of territory,
Germany's biggest loss is in its transpor
tation system, in the opinion of Pro
fessor Lutz. He declared the country
will recover because of the industrious
quality of the people, and socialism will
develop there in a rational way.
