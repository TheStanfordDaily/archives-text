# U. OF C. OPENS TERM WITH ENROLLMENT OF 8881 STUDENTS
## 
### 
California opened classes Tuesday
with a total registration of 8881 studen s.
Fifty-two per cent of those enrolled are
women. Although this is lower than the
total registration of last year the uni
versity authorities expect late registra
tions to bring this year's total above the
9957 for last year. Classification of the
registrants show 2276 new under grad
uates, 2723 old undergraduates, 447 new
graduate students, and 324 old gradu
ates.
The problem of accommodating all the
students is causing the university great
trouble. The women especially are finding
it very hard to find suitable living quar
ters which has caused some talk of pro
viding temporary dormitories for them.
Some of the fraternities have installed
extra cots to take care of the overflow
of men until more permanent arrange
ments can be made.
Enrollment will continue for the rest
of this week. It is expected that zy
Saturday evening there will be as many
men as women registered and the fresh
man class will number more than 3000.
