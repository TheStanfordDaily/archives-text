Have You Tried Tuxedo in the New
"TEA-FOIL" PACKAGE?
It's soft and pliable—decrease* in size as
the tobacco is used—tobacco does not Jjw
cake in the package—no digging it out .ffir
with the finger. Keeps the tobacco
in even better condition than tin. JSr
Now, don't you owe it to yourself jaSr
to buy a package and give
Tuxedo a trial? —Not quite as jjSf
much tobacco as in the tin,

—also packed in the
famous green tins
as heretofore.
