# OLD FRENCH FARCE PLEASES AUDIENCE IN LITTLE THEATRE
## Enthusiastic Gathering Is Carried Back to 1464 by Presentation 
### 
"Master Pierre Patelin," as presented
by the Renaissance Club, in the Little
Theatre on Wednesday evening, carried
an enthusiastic audience with it back to
the fifteenth century when this early
French farce was first introduced to a
Parisian audience.
Professor Gray, who made the first
verse translation of this play for the
American Academy of Dramatic Arts
in New York, gave a brief introductory
talk in which he explained the origin of
the farce as played in 1464 in the customs
of the times, saying that "it is perhaps
the most brilliant and wholesome of the
farces then given." He added that it
was chosen not to show acting but make
clear the type of study done by the club.
Pichel Calls Forth Laughter
The understanding interpretation of
the part of Master Pierre Patelin by Mr.
Irving Pichel, who is conducting several
courses in drama this term, called forth
bursts of laughter from the audience.
Guillemette, as played by Winnifred
Estabrook, was very realistic. The sup
porting cast of MacNally, Phyffer and
Brown as the draper, the judge and the
shepherd did excellent work. The setting
was as simple as possible and the play
required few properties. The costumes,
however, being so very different from
those to which the modern audience is
accustomed added to the amusing quality
of the production. Master Pierre danc
ing about, supposedly in delirium,
dressed in the night robe and cap of the
period created quite a sensation, and at
times it was almost impossible to hear
the lines above the chuckles of the many
people present.
The farce was one t of the most suc
cessful of the entertainments of the sum
mer both from the standpoint of amuse
ment and of instruction in the type of
plav pleasing to the fifteenth century as
well as to its more modern audience.
