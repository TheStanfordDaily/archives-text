# U.C. PROPHETS SEE GOOD YEAR AHEAD
## Outlook for Freshman Eleven Is Fine, According to "Dummy" Wells 
### 
The freshmen at California will
have another victorious football team if
!â€¢ reshman Coach, "Dummy" Wells is .to
be taken as prophet. According to Wells,
the material which has reported for
practice gives assurance that this year's
freshman eleven will be in every way
equal to the outfit which defeated the
Cardinal babes last fall.
Wells bases his predictions on the
records which the men who have re
ported for practice have made in high
school. One of his "hopefuls" especial
ly relied upon is Don Nichols, the
brother of graduate manager Lute Nich
ols of California. Nichols starred on
last year's Pomona High School eleven
and was picked as All-Southern Cali
fornia full-back. Berkeley High School,
which won the. Northern California
championship last year has also sent to
California ten of the members of its
team, and with these men and many
other men with American football and
rugby experience to pick from Wells
should have ample material to make good
his boasts.
Practice at present is confined to pre
paration for the inter-class games which
will take place during the first part of
September, and regular shaping of the
team will not begin until these games
have been completed. According to
Conference ruling regular football prac
tice is not permitted until the fifteenth
of September.
With regards to the Varsity outlook,
the Californians are equally confident.
Nearly all of last year's eleven are back
on the-campus this year and although
the loss of "Dummy" Wells who was
California's most brilliant illuminary last
fall, will be felt, additions from last
year's freshman squad are expected to
more than make up for his absence.
