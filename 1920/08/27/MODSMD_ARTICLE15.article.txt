# NEW CINDERS FOR TRACK
## 
### 
I'or the first time in a number of years
the Stanford track is to have real
cinders; the oval is being completely
torn up and three carloads of cinders
are to replace the clay surface. While
the cinder footing will not make the
track any faster than the compact dirt,
it will considerably facilitate training by
lessening the danger of "shin-splints."
