# U.S. MUST FIGURE IN FUTURE WORLD WARS, SAYS GARNER
## Professor Traces History of U.S. Foreign Policy to Present Day 
### 
T venture to predict there never will
be another great war in Europe into
which America will not he brought."
1 his is the opinion expressed by Pro
fessor James \V. Gardner, of the Uni
versity of Illinois, in an address on ' Our
foreign Policy and America's Duty,"
in the Little Theater, Tuesday evening.
He said the war has changed America's
policy of neutrality and it will never be
able to "relax into its old policy of
isolation anymore than we can revert
from the automobile to the stage coach."
Garner Traces Foreign Policy
Professor Garner traced the earlier
stages of America's foreign policy, neu
trality, non-interference, and intolerence
of European interference in American
affairs. Washington set an example
which was followed throughout the nine
teenth century when he declared Ameri
can ports open to all belligerents during
European conflicts. Munitions and other
Supplies were sold to any nation which
wished to purchase them. When Pres
ident Wilson declared American neutral
ity in 1914 l\e acted strictly in conformity
with the traditional American policy,
according to Professor Garner.
"Washington was against permanent
alliances and Jefferson favored no en
tangling alliances but neither Washing
ton nor Jefferson intended to lay down
the principle that America must draw the
line and remain in isolation when such
a policy would subvert our ideals. They
had in mind the dynastic compacts of J
Europe in the eighteenth century "
Quotes Lodge's Biography
I he speaker quoted Senator Henry |
Cabot Lodge's biography of Washington]
in which he says that Washington didn't I
mean that America should never join an '
European alliance.
According to Professor Garner since
the United States has become a great
power it owes duties to the rest of the
world. It is one of the trustees of civil
ization.
Speaking of the nearness of the na
tions of the world to each other, the
speaker pointed out that there was more
intercourse between the United States
and China now than there, was between
North and South Carolina a hundred
years ago.
Professor Garner said the military de
feat of Germany alone cannot insure
permanent peace. Germany was crush

ed by Napoleon but within a few years
it was able to rise again and fight three
successful wars. He declared that it
will do it again if precautions in the
form of a League of Nations are not
taken.
Answering the argument of Great
Britain's six votes to the United States
one in the League of Nations, Professor
Garner said the council is organized on
the principle of the old Polish Diet; t
unanimous vote being required to pass
any measure, hence "one vote would be
as effiective as hundred in blocking any
measure."
He said the argument against the
League of Nations on the ground that
it takes the war makin&power out of the
hands of the Congress of the United
States, and places it in the hands of the
council of the League of Nations is un
founded. According to Professor Garner
the council can only "suggest, advise, and
recommend, but has not the power to
compel."
The speaker said the League of Na
tions is now functioning. Among other
things, it is governing 13,000,000 inhabi
tants of the conquered German colonics
and 650,(T0 people in the Saar Valley of
Alsace Lorraine. Furthermore the Lea

gue has gotten beyond the stage where it
is in danger of collapse
