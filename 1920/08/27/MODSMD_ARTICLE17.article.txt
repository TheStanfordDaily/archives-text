# Puls, '19, Writes of Panama Canal Trip
## Letter to Professor Marx Recounts Experiences on the "Bradford" 
### 
A letter received by Dr. C. D. Marx,
of the Engineering department, from
Lonis G. Puis, '19, contains an interest
ing account of how Puis beat his way to
New York through the Panama Canal.
The letter follows in part:
"Reached home a week ago after a
thirty-one days trip on oil tankers. It
was a pretty tough life as far as Tam
pico, Mexico, but a delightful trip from
there on. 1 signed on the "Bradford"
at San Francisco as a "wiper" (a hot,
dirty, miserable job. but the best I could
get.) and sailed July 2. We reached the
canal in thirteen days arriving at Balboa
in the afternoon July 15. We had to
lay over there for the night as no ships
are allowed to enter the canal after 1:00
p. m. I visited Panama in the evening
and found it to be the most miserable
city I have ever encountered.
Eight Hours to go Through Canal
"It took eight hours to go through the
canal. 1 was kept below decks working
all the way but I didn't do much and
instead stayed near the port-hole from
which 1 got a good view. It was re
markable, the speed with which they
entered and discharged the ship from
those locks. Just twenty-five minutes
after the bow passed one gate the stern
had passed the other. A lock was filled
in about six minutes.
"They are washing the faces of the
Culebra Cut down to the banks. From
there il is dredged out and putin barges
and taken to fill recesses in Gatun Lake.
I hardly think there is danger of future
slides.
"I left the 'Bradford' at Tampico be
cause it was going to South America.
I could find no job on boats going up
the Atlantic coast so I stowed away on
the "Barstow" going to New York. Four
hours out I came on deck and met the
skipper. Ile was a line scout and treated
me royally. 1 worked about two hours
a day for my chow and that was all.
j We reached New York August 2."
