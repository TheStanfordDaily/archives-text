# SUMMER SESSIONS
## 
### 
It's a good deal like the old act of carrying coals (or coal) to Newcastle
for anyone to sing the praise of summer sessions in general to this year's
summer colony at Stanford. Physical conditions for work and for play
have so nearly reached perfection here during the last three months that
apologies for the summer term hardly seem necessary.
But though the old adage says that "good wine needs no bush," never
theless, a lot of rare vintage would go to waste unless some kind of bush,
or advertising, was used. That is the case with the Summer Session. We who
have tried i': and liked it this year should spread the good word so that many
more can enjoy the delights of a summer at Stanford next year. We owe
it to the weather man for the many good turns he has done us to let the rest
of the University know what it is missing by not attending summer cessions.
Summer sessions are still in the experimental stage at Stanford and, for
that matter, throughout the country. Stanford is one of a! very few universi
ties that hold a full term during the summer months. This is the third sum
mer quarter that has been in session at Stanford and it has had a somewhat
larger enrollment than either of its predecessors.
Still, the Summer Session is not receiving the popularity it deserves. In
these days of intensified education, when our universities are crowded to
overflowing, the summer term seems to be the ideal remedy for the condi
tion. There is no reason why a specialized educational plant should have to
be shut down for three months and then have to run at extra speed to handle
the crowds in the other nine. No commercial concern would think of doing
business that way.
Stanford's administration has realized this fact and is keeping that Uni
versity's doors open practically the year around. The fact that only a negli
gible percentage of nearly three thousand students take advantage of the
three summer months is, in part, a remnant of the ideas of the old days
when colleges were uncrowded and competition less keen. The modern trend
is toward more comprehensive work, and the man who can complete his
college career six months or a year early by attending summer sessions is
getting a head start in life. Surely as much can be said against the long
three months' vacation that many college men indulge in as can be said for
it. The best three months of the year at Stanford come during the summer
quarter.
Let's stop this waste and boost the summer session idea. It's one of the
big advances of modern education, and Stanford's contribution to it should not
go along alone without the support of its students.
