The Pioneer class, '95, because of their
superior numbers, were able to publish
the first Stanford Annual At a regular
meeting of the Board of Editors on De
cember 6, 1893, the present name, "The i
Stanford Quad" was chosen from a listj
of fifteen submitted, as being "most i
characteristic and substantial." Notice j
was given at this time through the col- j
umns of the Daily Palo Alto that all
material should be turned in by the
second Wednesday of the following
semester and a prize of $5 was offered
for the best cover design.
H. S. Crocker Printing Company of
San Francisco was contracted with to
print 850 copies at a cost of $1750. and
although at first it was planned that it
would sell for $1 a copy, it was found
necessary to raise the price to $1.50 and
a $2 assessment was levied on all mem
bers of the junior class.
The Quad made its appearance on the
campus nn May 15. 1894. It was a red

and white cloth-bound book of about 250
pages and was fittingly dedicated to
Leland Stanford Junior, "whose early
death opened for us an avenue to higher
I life." The publishers endeavored to
| combine in one volume a complete record
| of university affairs since the founding.
| The book contained full-paged photo
j graphs of young Stanford and Dr.
Jordan, steel and line engravings of the
'95 class under the famous oak, Univer
sity buildings and ground and pictures
of the various athletic teams. Statistics
and sketches of the literary, fraternal
and educational organizations were giv
en, alsf) a number of original poems and
short stories of university life. A very
good illustrated josh section completed
the volume.
The general plan of the make-up and
characteristic snap and vigor set by the
first Stanford annual has been main
tained successfully in each of the follow
ing Quads.
