# Col. Um Talks

### Milt Hagen 
Ah was wondering through an auto
biography of Walt Scott t'other day at
the Library, when I came across a pass
age anent the Irish which is rather inter
esting in these days of the Sinn Fein
chin fest.
* * *
Speaking of the Irish, Mistah Scott
says, "Their natural disposition is turned
to gaiety and happiness. While a
Scotchman is thinking about the term
day, or, if easy on that subject, about
hell in the next world—while an English
man is making a little hell in the present
because his muffin is not well roasted—
Pat's mind is always turned to fun and
ridicule."
♦ * •
To continue with Scott's discourse,
but broken up thus so as to make it
easier reading, as Mr. Brisbane would
have it, "They are terribly excitable to
be sure, and will murder you on slight
suspicion, and find out next day that it
was all a mistake, and that it was not
yourself they meant to kill, at all, at all."
♦ * *
Here is a jest, Sub, that is respectfully
submitted to "The Chaparral," the local
college comic that is now "on Sabbatical
leave "
Oz Wolde—Do you subscribe to any
magazine? *
Ed Munde—l don't have to; I mooch
at the Campus Bookstore.
♦ * *
Which reminds me, Suh, that the local
Bookstore used to be to the average stu
dent what the Corner Saloon used to be
to the average "Stewed Gent."
Um-m, er-r, not speaking from ex
perience, Suh, but the Corner Saloon
used to be a haven of refuge to the
poor man. He could get warmth, con
genialty, Free Lunch, er-a um-moisture,
what-not and the like.
* * *
-At the Bookstore the poor student was
wont to procure Free blotters, Free um
moisture—or rather ink, Free telephone
and Free Reading—the later course be
ing the only one now served in 1920-21.
* * *
But times have changed. You pay for
'most everything. They used to charge
you five cents for a crawl to Paly on
the local Toonville Trolly with a motley
car-crew of two thrown in for good
measure.
* * *
Ah must admit—the service was slow.
but the motor-gentleman and the lightn
ing-non-conductor did their utmost to
get you to Paly some day. Their motto
was "eventually if not now."
* * *
Today these local local electrically
propelled-vehicles are man-handled by a
crew (though Ah see nothing to crow
about) of one. And, as tho 'twere a
tribute to the departed member, we must
needs pay an additional penny! "A
penny for our thoughts?" It would take
less than that to express 'em ! ! ! !
* * *
M'friend, Mistah Yank Chandler, ob
serves as how it is the most nachel thing
in the world fo' the women's gymn to
have barb-wire entanglements along its
fence. "Aint it 'No Man's Land?" he
doth interrogate most sagely.
Yo' Colonel now says Good Bye. He
'has enjoyed his stay with you immense
ly. He would like to stay longer, but
I New Yawk is calling. He would like to
say more but—(gulp! gulp! gulp!)
Editor's Note... In justice to you Col
onel Um was not choking with emotion,
no! he suddenly became absorbed in a
bottle of "bootleg" mint-julep!
