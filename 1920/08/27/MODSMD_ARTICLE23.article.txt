# LAST OF BIG BARNS IS TO BE TORN DOWN
## 
### 
The last of the big barns has been
sold and will lit torn down this week,
This barn is situated near the press
building and all lumber and other ma
terials will be moved to the corporation
yard behind that building. What is now
the lumber yard, across the road from
the women's gymnasium, will later be
the women's athletic field. The sharp
turn beyond the press building toward
i Roble will be done away with by laying
I the road straight up behind the white
! cottage which will be removed. This will I
I allow for a graded turn. The small
building in the corporation yard now
j used as plumber's store room, will be
I reconstructed into a barn.
