# Portola Road Grading Completed August 26
## 
### 
The grading and graveling of the
Portola road which passes through an
arm of the Searsville Lake, was com
pleted Thursday, August 26. The road
will not be oiled until spring, to allow
for settling during the winter rains, but
it will be open for traffic as soon as
graded.
This completes all the work incidental
to the raising of the water level in the
lake in order to supply Lagunita. The
entire work has been done by the uni
versity staff under the direction of Sup
erintendent Nyquist, at a cost approxi
mately one-half that estimated by out
side contractors.
