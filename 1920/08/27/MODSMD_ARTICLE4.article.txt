"The College Woman in Business," is
the title of an article by Neil Petree, '19,
former editor of the' Daily Palo Alto
and the Illustrated Review, in the Octo
ber number of the Stanford Pictorial.
Petree is now connected with a large
Sacramento firm and has had an unusual
opportunity to obtain a knowledge of
his subject.
H. G. Swendsen, '20, another former
editor of the Illustrated Review, has
contributed an article to the Pictorial
suggesting that the date of all class
reunions be changed so as to coincide
with either the Big Game or the Track
Meet.
"The Hall-Hotel or Home?," by D.
W. Evans, '21, deals with the rushing
problem in Enema. Florence Hocking,
'22, writes on the co-eds.
There will be a cartoon in the initial
number of the Pictorial by George Hall.
