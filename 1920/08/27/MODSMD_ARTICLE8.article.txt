# CARDINAL TRACK ATHLETES FIGURE IN U. S. VICTORY
## Kirksey Carries Victorious Baton in 400-Meter Relay 
### 
American athletes have once again
proved their superiority in an Olympiad
by defeating, by a large score, the repre
sentatives of foreign nations in the track
and fiield events, and in this victory the
ability of Stanford athletes played an
important role. The final score of the
United States stood 210, with Finland,
its nearest competitor, credited with 105
points, and of these 210 points, members
of the team who, in the past, ran for
Stanford, contributed two second places,
a third and a fourth place, as well as a
member of the victorious relay team.
Of these former. Stanford men, Morris
Kirksey is the only one who featured in
more than one event. He was just nosed
out by Paddock of the University of
Southern California in the 100 meter
dash, and in the 400 meter relay, which
the American team won, he was able
to gain five yards on his nearest rival.
Paddock also ran for the United States
in this event.
The failure of Kirksey to win a place
in the 200 meter event was something
of a surprise. His past performances in
that event indicated that he woidd be
sure of a place and a probable winner.
The other Stanford point winners were*
John Norton, '17, who took second place
in the 400 meter hurdles, "Feg" Murray,
