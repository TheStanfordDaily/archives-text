# CARDINAL TRACK ATHLETES FIGURE IN U. S. VICTORY
## Kirksey Carries Victorious Baton in 400-Meter Relay 
### 
American athletes have once again
proved their superiority in an Olympiad
by defeating, by a large score, the repre
sentatives of foreign nations in the track
and fiield events, and in this victory the
ability of Stanford athletes played an
important role. The final score of the
United States stood 210, with Finland,
its nearest competitor, credited with 105
points, and of these 210 points, members
of the team who, in the past, ran for
Stanford, contributed two second places,
a third and a fourth place, as well as a
member of the victorious relay team.
Of these former. Stanford men, Morris
Kirksey is the only one who featured in
more than one event. He was just nosed
out by Paddock of the University of
Southern California in the 100 meter
dash, and in the 400 meter relay, which
the American team won, he was able
to gain five yards on his nearest rival.
Paddock also ran for the United States
in this event.
The failure of Kirksey to win a place
in the 200 meter event was something
of a surprise. His past performances in
that event indicated that he woidd be
sure of a place and a probable winner.
The other Stanford point winners were*
John Norton, '17, who took second place
in the 400 meter hurdles, "Feg" Murray,
'16, who placed third in the 100 meter
hurdles, and "Dink" Templeton, '18. who
finished fourth in the broad jump.
"Dink's" success in the broad jump,
against a field of reputedly better per
formers, defeating Merchant of the Uni
versity of California, was unexpected
and brings to mind his similar achieve
ment at the 1919 Track meet with Cali
fornia when with the outcome of the
meet hanging in the balance he upset the
dope by winning the event.
With the track and field events com
pleted, the swimming events are the
only remaining competitions to decide
world supremacy in athletics, and thus
far the Americans have had everything
their own way. C. E. Pinkston, '22. and
Norman Ross, ex-'2O, are the former
Cardinal swimmers who are members of
the American team.
In the finals of the 100 meter race,
Koss took fourth place. He is expected
to be a winner in the 400 meter event.
Pinkston in the fancy high dives and
springboard dives is considered by swim
ming experts to lie a sure point winner
