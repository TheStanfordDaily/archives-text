i of opening and carrying a checking account in l'alo Alto is approxi
? mately $8.75 per annum.

f is carried al a loss by the bank.

t made up of innumerable small personal checking accounts.

T expense connected with the operation of a bank has increased enor- \\
i mously within the last few years.

I carry these unprofitable accounts without any charge. |[
