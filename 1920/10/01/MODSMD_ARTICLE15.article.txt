# CAPTAIN BROWN MAKES STATEMENT ON CREW SITUATION
## 
### 
By 11. A. Brown, '19, Crew Captain
In view of the pn-f.it crew situation,
a few remarks with regard to this sport
and its career al Stanford are proper at
this time. It is a severe blow to the
University thai it has been deemed finan
cially advisable in view of the prospec
tive building program, to dispense with
rowing. It ran only be hoped that the
present idea of resuming it at some fu
ture date is no idle intention and that
when crew is again taken up it will be
supported and run in a fashion befitting
the honor and dignity of the sport itself.
Everyone appreciates the widespread
popularity of crew. It is the onlj sporl
that mighl be called international in
character. It is a major athletic actn
ity in nearly every civilized nation on the
globe, which is more than can be said of
any other sport. The eastern regattas in
this country arc the biggest inter-col
legiate soort events. Races of equal im
portance arc lnhl all over the world.
Crew, in the past at Stanford, has been
a truly big sport, and one thai at all
times has reflected credit on the I'ui
versity. The Cardinal has always been
a consistent winter over its old rivals at
Berkeley, and only during the past two
seasons has this ceased to he. Those who
have been in tlii' Easl appreciate Stan
ford's athletic prestige in that section of
the country; a regard which has been
created to a very greal extent by the
prowess of the Stanford (Tews.
The possibilities of crew at Stanford
arc limited only by the purse strings.
I here could he no sporting event on the
coast more interesting than one allowing
the several leading universities to battle
at one time for supremacy and in turn
with the besl eastern crews.
Those who have visited the training
quarters al Redwood and have followed
the crews through a training schedule
for several days appreciate the miser
abl< and adverse conditions under which
work has been carried on. It is reallv
astonishing, the calibre of crews turned
out in years gone by! The slump in
crew during # the past two years was due
to lack of equimenl and support. The
year before last it was run by donations,
last year we borrowed a shell from I . ('.
All the equipment was of pre-war vint
age and in sad need of repair. A num
ber of lurid pages of suffering mighl he
written about crew and its devotees. It
has been battered about like a stray cat
and insufficiently nourished by ■-hoe
string budgests, but has managed to ex
ist.
I ' future of crew is in the hands of
tudents. Stanford has the men,
tl e is no doubt about that, but men
I entering school cannot be expected to
furnish their own shells and oars. I be
i l ;V\e the student body of the University
. rew; 1 know the alumni do. They
have arav a\s expected more from crews
than am., i her sport, and their hopes
ha\ ild I ee'n disappointed.

In view of the pn-f.it crew situation,
a few remarks with regard to this sport
and its career al Stanford are proper at
this time. It is a severe blow to the
University thai it has been deemed finan
cially advisable in view of the prospec
tive building program, to dispense with
rowing. It ran only be hoped that the
present idea of resuming it at some fu
ture date is no idle intention and that
when crew is again taken up it will be
supported and run in a fashion befitting
the honor and dignity of the sport itself.
Everyone appreciates the widespread
popularity of crew. It is the onlj sporl
that mighl be called international in
character. It is a major athletic actn
ity in nearly every civilized nation on the
globe, which is more than can be said of
any other sport. The eastern regattas in
this country arc the biggest inter-col
legiate soort events. Races of equal im
portance arc lnhl all over the world.
Crew, in the past at Stanford, has been
a truly big sport, and one thai at all
times has reflected credit on the I'ui
versity. The Cardinal has always been
a consistent winter over its old rivals at
Berkeley, and only during the past two
seasons has this ceased to he. Those who
have been in tlii' Easl appreciate Stan
ford's athletic prestige in that section of
the country; a regard which has been
created to a very greal extent by the
prowess of the Stanford (Tews.
The possibilities of crew at Stanford
arc limited only by the purse strings.
I here could he no sporting event on the
coast more interesting than one allowing
the several leading universities to battle
at one time for supremacy and in turn
with the besl eastern crews.
