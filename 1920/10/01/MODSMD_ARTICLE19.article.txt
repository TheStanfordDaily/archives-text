# NEW BUDGET SHOWS NO APPROPRIATION FOR VARSITY CREW
## PAVILION FOR BASKETBALL WILL BE CONSTRUCTED Board Plans Completion of Great Football Stadium Within Three-year Period 
### 
Because of the lack of necessary fi
nances, the Hoard of Athletic Control
found ii impossible to Include expenses
of maintaining a crew in the L 920-21
athletic budget. With such conditions
existing, Stanford will put out no crew
this year.
Even though crew was left out of
the budget, the Hoard found that the
estimated expenses exceeded the esti
mated receipts hy $4,000. This forced
the Hoard to cut down materially on
several of the ol her sports.
It. is planned to erect a $15.0(10 bas
kethall pavilion, which is to he used
for dancing. The budget takes care
of only half the cost of the building,
Hi.' rest to be raised later. The Hoard
iias also authorized the expenditure
of $3,000 for new tennis courts and
$1,000 for new athletic fields.
Plans are now under way for the
new foot hall stadium which the Hoard
plans to have 1 erected within tin! next
three years. This year's budget does
not include an appropriation for the
commencement of the work on the
stadium. However it may he found
necessary to begin the excavation
since the ground must stand and be
allowed to setUo for a year follow
ing the excavation and banking work.
The following report has been sub
mitted io the Daily Palo Alto by Pro
fessor J. P. Mitchell:
The 1920-21 Budget for Athletics /\
At a meeting held on September 24,
1920, the Hoard of Athletic Control
ado;.ted a budget for the coming year.
Like all budgets, the one adopted is
a compromise. The income available
did not permit the Hoard to plan all
the expenditures that are desirable;
much had to be given tip to secure the
,n,i i essentia! appropriation and Im
provements. As first presented, the
proposed "expenditures exceed the esti
ma'ed receipts by some four thousand
dollars.
There was a long debate on the
question of providing for the crew.
Many factors were considered. First
of all it was apparent that it is utterly
out of the question to attempt to carry
on rowing as a major sport with an
inadequate appropriation. Thai
tried last year, and was manj£f s tl y
unfair to Hie sport and to ail fcen who
did their besl under v. ry £ a <j condi
viVnTs."' >V P 1 • i except the
launch is p'-a. ! d un. and the
present boat-WW i ntirely unsatis
factory. The estimated cost of a new
boat-house, new shells and new equip
ment was eight thousand dollars for
this year, with no provision made for
a trip to Washington. As far as could
be foreseen, it would require ten thou
sand dollars a year indefinitely to sup
port the crew properly as a major
sport of the first importance, and the
Board could not see its way clear to
undertake to provide such a sum. Back
Of the financial difficulty lies the fact
thai the geographical location of the
University imposes a very serious
handicap on all rowing activities. Th.3
physical strain upon the men who
take pari is very heavy, in some cases
the consequences have been serious,
and the sport is necessarily restricted
to a few who cannot even be observed
and encouraged by any considerable
proportion Of the student body. After
full debate, and reluctantly, the Hoard
finally voted to omit the suggested
appropriation for the crew; and then
proceeded to re-arrange, trim .and ad
just the other items until the follow
ing budget was agreed upon:
Estimatt d
Receipts
1400 students, at $15... $21,000
Fees, 2000 students at $3 6,000
Sale of season tickets.. 500
