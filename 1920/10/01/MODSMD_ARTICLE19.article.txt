Because of the lack of necessary fi
nances, the Hoard of Athletic Control
found ii impossible to Include expenses
of maintaining a crew in the L 920-21
athletic budget. With such conditions
existing, Stanford will put out no crew
this year.
Even though crew was left out of
the budget, the Hoard found that the
estimated expenses exceeded the esti
mated receipts hy $4,000. This forced
the Hoard to cut down materially on
several of the ol her sports.
It. is planned to erect a $15.0(10 bas
kethall pavilion, which is to he used
for dancing. The budget takes care
of only half the cost of the building,
Hi.' rest to be raised later. The Hoard
iias also authorized the expenditure
of $3,000 for new tennis courts and
$1,000 for new athletic fields.
Plans are now under way for the
new foot hall stadium which the Hoard
plans to have 1 erected within tin! next
three years. This year's budget does
not include an appropriation for the
commencement of the work on the
stadium. However it may he found
necessary to begin the excavation
since the ground must stand and be
allowed to setUo for a year follow
ing the excavation and banking work.
The following report has been sub
mitted io the Daily Palo Alto by Pro
fessor J. P. Mitchell:
The 1920-21 Budget for Athletics /\
At a meeting held on September 24,
1920, the Hoard of Athletic Control
ado;.ted a budget for the coming year.
Like all budgets, the one adopted is
a compromise. The income available
did not permit the Hoard to plan all
the expenditures that are desirable;
much had to be given tip to secure the
,n,i i essentia! appropriation and Im
provements. As first presented, the
proposed "expenditures exceed the esti
ma'ed receipts by some four thousand
dollars.
There was a long debate on the
question of providing for the crew.
Many factors were considered. First
of all it was apparent that it is utterly
out of the question to attempt to carry
on rowing as a major sport with an
inadequate appropriation. Thai
tried last year, and was manj£f s tl y
unfair to Hie sport and to ail fcen who
did their besl under v. ry £ a <j condi
viVnTs."' >V P 1 • i except the
launch is p'-a. ! d un. and the
present boat-WW i ntirely unsatis
factory. The estimated cost of a new
boat-house, new shells and new equip
ment was eight thousand dollars for
this year, with no provision made for
a trip to Washington. As far as could
be foreseen, it would require ten thou
sand dollars a year indefinitely to sup
port the crew properly as a major
sport of the first importance, and the
Board could not see its way clear to
undertake to provide such a sum. Back
Of the financial difficulty lies the fact
thai the geographical location of the
University imposes a very serious
handicap on all rowing activities. Th.3
physical strain upon the men who
take pari is very heavy, in some cases
the consequences have been serious,
and the sport is necessarily restricted
to a few who cannot even be observed
and encouraged by any considerable
proportion Of the student body. After
full debate, and reluctantly, the Hoard
finally voted to omit the suggested
appropriation for the crew; and then
proceeded to re-arrange, trim .and ad
just the other items until the follow
ing budget was agreed upon:

Last year the achievement of per
manent importance was the well for
the swimming pool, this year the big
work will be to provide a proper floor
for basketball. The .plan calls for a
large, properly constructed floor, with
arrangements for seating several thou
sand spectators, in a separate build
ing that can be used for dances.
Everyone knows that the present gym
nasium floor is not right for either
j basketball or dancing, the new build
i ing is to be built for both. It is
planned to nave a spring floor, with
adequate dressing-rooms for men and
wome'ii, so that the building will be
svutable in every way for the larger
college dances. The maximum cost
authorized is $15,000. The budget for
\ this year carries an appropriation of
.$7,500 and a loan is to be arranged
for the balance. When spectators can
be accommodated the receipts from
games will prove an important source
of Income to help pay the cost of the
building; and at the same time the
structure will be of recreational value
to a large proportion of the student
I body.
Tennis also receives recognition as
! a major sport.. The appropriation of
j $3,000 will permit the construction of
more tennis courts, and the Board
, plans to continue annual appropria
tions until adequate facilities have
been constructed.
To print all the details of the vari
i ouns appropriations would require too
much space. All the items have been
arrived at after much labor and many
calculations, and have been reduced
to the basis of the greatest possible
economy without sacrifice of the es
| sentials for the welfare of each sport.
j Any member of the Board will be glad
I to secure and furnish any facts which
'may be desired, for the Board realizes
that full publicity is its best policy.
Tlurc is a great undertaking ahead
which will call For the united efforts
and support of all Stanford alumni and
Students. A suitable Stanford stadium
must be built in the near future. This
will be the largest undertaking ever at
tempted in the interests of Stanford ath
letic-. It must be a fine stadium and be
planned with an eye to the future needs.
The hoard has been told by competent
engineers that the present bleechers can
be used for the Big (iame of 1021 ; after
that they must be rebuilt or replaced.
| The seating capacity of the present fields
at Stanford and at Berkeley are both in
sufficient to meet the demands of Stu
dents and alumni, and the general pub
lic cannot be accommodated at all. This
year the necessary arrangement for dis
tributing tickets for the Stanford-Cali
fornia game are very stringent, and the
limitations imposed will result in main
disappointments. Thirty forty thou
sand people simply cannot be satisfied
with some twenty-five thousand seats.
Something must be done, and it must be
on a large and expensive scale.
The board plans to face the situation
at once. The problem will be met in
three distinct Steps. First, a definite and
final location for the stadium must be
determined; second, plans must be pre
pared for the final structure; third, a
method for financing the undertaking
must be developed. The fir3t step has
been taken . At its last meeting the
board aopointed a committee consisting
of Messrs. Cutler, Williams, Browne,
Molt, and Mitchell, to confer with the
University authorities and select the lo
cation. The plans will come next. When
the cost can be estimated the financial
campaign will start. It will require every
resource of the hoard and the generous
support of all students and alumni to
make this stadium a credit to Stanford.

"Swede" Righter and Jack Patrick ex
pert to return to Stanford by October
15, according to a letter recently receiv
ed on the campus from Righter. The
two Cardinal Ruggers in company with
.1 number of other Stanford men. toured

games at Antwerp. The local gridmen
expect Patrick and Righter to join the
Varsity football squad immediately on
their return as the two were stars on

Last year the achievement of per

work will be to provide a proper floor
for basketball. The .plan calls for a
large, properly constructed floor, with
arrangements for seating several thou
sand spectators, in a separate build
ing that can be used for dances.
Everyone knows that the present gym
nasium floor is not right for either
j basketball or dancing, the new build
i ing is to be built for both. It is
planned to nave a spring floor, with
adequate dressing-rooms for men and
wome'ii, so that the building will be
svutable in every way for the larger
college dances. The maximum cost
authorized is $15,000. The budget for
\ this year carries an appropriation of
.$7,500 and a loan is to be arranged
for the balance. When spectators can
be accommodated the receipts from
games will prove an important source
of Income to help pay the cost of the
building; and at the same time the
structure will be of recreational value
to a large proportion of the student
I body.
Tennis also receives recognition as

more tennis courts, and the Board
, plans to continue annual appropria

been constructed.

sufficient to meet the demands of Stu

fornia game are very stringent, and the
limitations imposed will result in main
disappointments. Thirty forty thou
sand people simply cannot be satisfied
with some twenty-five thousand seats.
Something must be done, and it must be
on a large and expensive scale.
The board plans to face the situation
at once. The problem will be met in

determined; second, plans must be pre
pared for the final structure; third, a
method for financing the undertaking
must be developed. The fir3t step has
been taken . At its last meeting the
board aopointed a committee consisting
of Messrs. Cutler, Williams, Browne,

University authorities and select the lo
cation. The plans will come next. When
the cost can be estimated the financial
campaign will start. It will require every

support of all students and alumni to
make this stadium a credit to Stanford.

"Swede" Righter and Jack Patrick ex
pert to return to Stanford by October
15, according to a letter recently receiv
ed on the campus from Righter. The
two Cardinal Ruggers in company with
.1 number of other Stanford men. toured
through Germany following the rugby
games at Antwerp. The local gridmen
expect Patrick and Righter to join the
Varsity football squad immediately on
their return as the two were stars on
the aggregation which surprised the
Bruins in the Big ' lame last fall.
Because of the lack of necessary fi
nances, the Hoard of Athletic Control
found ii impossible to Include expenses
of maintaining a crew in the L 920-21
athletic budget. With such conditions
existing, Stanford will put out no crew
this year.
Even though crew was left out of
the budget, the Hoard found that the
estimated expenses exceeded the esti
mated receipts hy $4,000. This forced
the Hoard to cut down materially on
several of the ol her sports.
It. is planned to erect a $15.0(10 bas
kethall pavilion, which is to he used
for dancing. The budget takes care
of only half the cost of the building,
Hi.' rest to be raised later. The Hoard
iias also authorized the expenditure
of $3,000 for new tennis courts and
$1,000 for new athletic fields.
Plans are now under way for the
new foot hall stadium which the Hoard
plans to have 1 erected within tin! next
three years. This year's budget does
not include an appropriation for the
commencement of the work on the
stadium. However it may he found
necessary to begin the excavation
since the ground must stand and be
allowed to setUo for a year follow
ing the excavation and banking work.
The following report has been sub
mitted io the Daily Palo Alto by Pro
fessor J. P. Mitchell:
The 1920-21 Budget for Athletics /\
At a meeting held on September 24,
1920, the Hoard of Athletic Control
ado;.ted a budget for the coming year.
Like all budgets, the one adopted is
a compromise. The income available
did not permit the Hoard to plan all
the expenditures that are desirable;
much had to be given tip to secure the
,n,i i essentia! appropriation and Im
provements. As first presented, the
proposed "expenditures exceed the esti
ma'ed receipts by some four thousand
dollars.
There was a long debate on the
question of providing for the crew.
Many factors were considered. First
of all it was apparent that it is utterly
out of the question to attempt to carry
on rowing as a major sport with an
inadequate appropriation. Thai
tried last year, and was manj£f s tl y
unfair to Hie sport and to ail fcen who
did their besl under v. ry £ a <j condi
viVnTs."' >V P 1 • i except the
launch is p'-a. ! d un. and the
present boat-WW i ntirely unsatis
factory. The estimated cost of a new
boat-house, new shells and new equip
ment was eight thousand dollars for
this year, with no provision made for
a trip to Washington. As far as could
be foreseen, it would require ten thou
sand dollars a year indefinitely to sup
port the crew properly as a major
sport of the first importance, and the
Board could not see its way clear to
undertake to provide such a sum. Back
Of the financial difficulty lies the fact
thai the geographical location of the
University imposes a very serious
handicap on all rowing activities. Th.3
physical strain upon the men who
take pari is very heavy, in some cases
the consequences have been serious,
and the sport is necessarily restricted
to a few who cannot even be observed
and encouraged by any considerable
proportion Of the student body. After
full debate, and reluctantly, the Hoard
finally voted to omit the suggested
appropriation for the crew; and then
proceeded to re-arrange, trim .and ad
just the other items until the follow
ing budget was agreed upon:

"Swede" Righter and Jack Patrick ex
pert to return to Stanford by October
15, according to a letter recently receiv
ed on the campus from Righter. The
two Cardinal Ruggers in company with
.1 number of other Stanford men. toured
through Germany following the rugby
games at Antwerp. The local gridmen
expect Patrick and Righter to join the
Varsity football squad immediately on
their return as the two were stars on
the aggregation which surprised the
Bruins in the Big ' lame last fall.
Because of the lack of necessary fi
nances, the Hoard of Athletic Control
found ii impossible to Include expenses
of maintaining a crew in the L 920-21
athletic budget. With such conditions
existing, Stanford will put out no crew
this year.
Even though crew was left out of
the budget, the Hoard found that the
estimated expenses exceeded the esti
mated receipts hy $4,000. This forced
the Hoard to cut down materially on
several of the ol her sports.
It. is planned to erect a $15.0(10 bas
kethall pavilion, which is to he used
for dancing. The budget takes care
of only half the cost of the building,
Hi.' rest to be raised later. The Hoard
iias also authorized the expenditure
of $3,000 for new tennis courts and
$1,000 for new athletic fields.
Plans are now under way for the
new foot hall stadium which the Hoard
plans to have 1 erected within tin! next
three years. This year's budget does
not include an appropriation for the
commencement of the work on the
stadium. However it may he found
necessary to begin the excavation
since the ground must stand and be
allowed to setUo for a year follow
ing the excavation and banking work.
The following report has been sub
mitted io the Daily Palo Alto by Pro
fessor J. P. Mitchell:
The 1920-21 Budget for Athletics /\
At a meeting held on September 24,
1920, the Hoard of Athletic Control
ado;.ted a budget for the coming year.
Like all budgets, the one adopted is
a compromise. The income available
did not permit the Hoard to plan all
the expenditures that are desirable;
much had to be given tip to secure the
,n,i i essentia! appropriation and Im
provements. As first presented, the
proposed "expenditures exceed the esti
ma'ed receipts by some four thousand
dollars.
There was a long debate on the
question of providing for the crew.
Many factors were considered. First
of all it was apparent that it is utterly
out of the question to attempt to carry
on rowing as a major sport with an
inadequate appropriation. Thai
tried last year, and was manj£f s tl y
unfair to Hie sport and to ail fcen who
did their besl under v. ry £ a <j condi
viVnTs."' >V P 1 • i except the
launch is p'-a. ! d un. and the
present boat-WW i ntirely unsatis
factory. The estimated cost of a new
boat-house, new shells and new equip
ment was eight thousand dollars for
this year, with no provision made for
a trip to Washington. As far as could
be foreseen, it would require ten thou
sand dollars a year indefinitely to sup
port the crew properly as a major
sport of the first importance, and the
Board could not see its way clear to
undertake to provide such a sum. Back
Of the financial difficulty lies the fact
thai the geographical location of the
University imposes a very serious
handicap on all rowing activities. Th.3
physical strain upon the men who
take pari is very heavy, in some cases
the consequences have been serious,
and the sport is necessarily restricted
to a few who cannot even be observed
and encouraged by any considerable
proportion Of the student body. After
full debate, and reluctantly, the Hoard
finally voted to omit the suggested
appropriation for the crew; and then
proceeded to re-arrange, trim .and ad
just the other items until the follow
ing budget was agreed upon:

Last year the achievement of per
manent importance was the well for
the swimming pool, this year the big
work will be to provide a proper floor
for basketball. The .plan calls for a
large, properly constructed floor, with
arrangements for seating several thou
sand spectators, in a separate build
ing that can be used for dances.
Everyone knows that the present gym
nasium floor is not right for either
j basketball or dancing, the new build
i ing is to be built for both. It is
planned to nave a spring floor, with
adequate dressing-rooms for men and
wome'ii, so that the building will be
svutable in every way for the larger
college dances. The maximum cost
authorized is $15,000. The budget for
\ this year carries an appropriation of
.$7,500 and a loan is to be arranged
for the balance. When spectators can
be accommodated the receipts from
games will prove an important source
of Income to help pay the cost of the
building; and at the same time the
structure will be of recreational value
to a large proportion of the student
I body.
Tennis also receives recognition as
! a major sport.. The appropriation of
j $3,000 will permit the construction of
more tennis courts, and the Board
, plans to continue annual appropria
tions until adequate facilities have
been constructed.
To print all the details of the vari
i ouns appropriations would require too
much space. All the items have been
arrived at after much labor and many
calculations, and have been reduced
to the basis of the greatest possible
economy without sacrifice of the es

1920, the Hoard of Athletic Control
ado;.ted a budget for the coming year.
Like all budgets, the one adopted is
a compromise. The income available
did not permit the Hoard to plan all
the expenditures that are desirable;
much had to be given tip to secure the
,n,i i essentia! appropriation and Im
provements. As first presented, the
proposed "expenditures exceed the esti
ma'ed receipts by some four thousand
dollars.
There was a long debate on the
question of providing for the crew.
Many factors were considered. First
of all it was apparent that it is utterly
out of the question to attempt to carry
on rowing as a major sport with an
inadequate appropriation. Thai
tried last year, and was manj£f s tl y
unfair to Hie sport and to ail fcen who
did their besl under v. ry £ a <j condi
viVnTs."' >V P 1 • i except the
launch is p'-a. ! d un. and the
present boat-WW i ntirely unsatis
factory. The estimated cost of a new
boat-house, new shells and new equip
ment was eight thousand dollars for
this year, with no provision made for
a trip to Washington. As far as could
be foreseen, it would require ten thou
sand dollars a year indefinitely to sup
port the crew properly as a major
sport of the first importance, and the
Board could not see its way clear to
undertake to provide such a sum. Back
Of the financial difficulty lies the fact
thai the geographical location of the
University imposes a very serious
handicap on all rowing activities. Th.3
physical strain upon the men who
take pari is very heavy, in some cases
the consequences have been serious,
and the sport is necessarily restricted
to a few who cannot even be observed
and encouraged by any considerable
proportion Of the student body. After
full debate, and reluctantly, the Hoard
finally voted to omit the suggested
appropriation for the crew; and then
proceeded to re-arrange, trim .and ad
just the other items until the follow
ing budget was agreed upon:

Last year the achievement of per
manent importance was the well for
the swimming pool, this year the big
work will be to provide a proper floor
for basketball. The .plan calls for a
large, properly constructed floor, with
arrangements for seating several thou
sand spectators, in a separate build
ing that can be used for dances.
Everyone knows that the present gym
nasium floor is not right for either
j basketball or dancing, the new build
i ing is to be built for both. It is
planned to nave a spring floor, with
adequate dressing-rooms for men and
wome'ii, so that the building will be
svutable in every way for the larger
college dances. The maximum cost
authorized is $15,000. The budget for
\ this year carries an appropriation of
.$7,500 and a loan is to be arranged
for the balance. When spectators can
be accommodated the receipts from
games will prove an important source
of Income to help pay the cost of the
building; and at the same time the
structure will be of recreational value
to a large proportion of the student
I body.
Tennis also receives recognition as
! a major sport.. The appropriation of
j $3,000 will permit the construction of
more tennis courts, and the Board
, plans to continue annual appropria
tions until adequate facilities have
been constructed.
To print all the details of the vari
i ouns appropriations would require too
much space. All the items have been
arrived at after much labor and many
calculations, and have been reduced
to the basis of the greatest possible
economy without sacrifice of the es
| sentials for the welfare of each sport.
j Any member of the Board will be glad
I to secure and furnish any facts which
'may be desired, for the Board realizes
that full publicity is its best policy.
Tlurc is a great undertaking ahead
which will call For the united efforts
and support of all Stanford alumni and
Students. A suitable Stanford stadium
must be built in the near future. This
will be the largest undertaking ever at
tempted in the interests of Stanford ath
letic-. It must be a fine stadium and be
planned with an eye to the future needs.
The hoard has been told by competent
engineers that the present bleechers can
be used for the Big (iame of 1021 ; after
that they must be rebuilt or replaced.
| The seating capacity of the present fields
at Stanford and at Berkeley are both in
sufficient to meet the demands of Stu
dents and alumni, and the general pub
lic cannot be accommodated at all. This
year the necessary arrangement for dis
tributing tickets for the Stanford-Cali
fornia game are very stringent, and the
limitations imposed will result in main
disappointments. Thirty forty thou
sand people simply cannot be satisfied
with some twenty-five thousand seats.
Something must be done, and it must be
on a large and expensive scale.
The board plans to face the situation
at once. The problem will be met in
three distinct Steps. First, a definite and
final location for the stadium must be
determined; second, plans must be pre
pared for the final structure; third, a
method for financing the undertaking
must be developed. The fir3t step has
been taken . At its last meeting the
board aopointed a committee consisting
of Messrs. Cutler, Williams, Browne,
Molt, and Mitchell, to confer with the
University authorities and select the lo
cation. The plans will come next. When
the cost can be estimated the financial
campaign will start. It will require every
resource of the hoard and the generous
support of all students and alumni to
make this stadium a credit to Stanford.

"Swede" Righter and Jack Patrick ex
pert to return to Stanford by October
15, according to a letter recently receiv
ed on the campus from Righter. The
two Cardinal Ruggers in company with
.1 number of other Stanford men. toured
through Germany following the rugby
games at Antwerp. The local gridmen
expect Patrick and Righter to join the
Varsity football squad immediately on
their return as the two were stars on
the aggregation which surprised the
Bruins in the Big ' lame last fall.
Because of the lack of necessary fi
nances, the Hoard of Athletic Control
found ii impossible to Include expenses
of maintaining a crew in the L 920-21
athletic budget. With such conditions
existing, Stanford will put out no crew
this year.
Even though crew was left out of
the budget, the Hoard found that the
estimated expenses exceeded the esti
mated receipts hy $4,000. This forced
the Hoard to cut down materially on
several of the ol her sports.
It. is planned to erect a $15.0(10 bas
kethall pavilion, which is to he used
for dancing. The budget takes care
of only half the cost of the building,
Hi.' rest to be raised later. The Hoard
iias also authorized the expenditure
of $3,000 for new tennis courts and
$1,000 for new athletic fields.
Plans are now under way for the
new foot hall stadium which the Hoard
plans to have 1 erected within tin! next
three years. This year's budget does
not include an appropriation for the
commencement of the work on the
stadium. However it may he found
necessary to begin the excavation
since the ground must stand and be
allowed to setUo for a year follow
ing the excavation and banking work.
