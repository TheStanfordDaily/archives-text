# GROUND CLEARED FOR ROBLE FIELD
## 
### 
The proposed women's athletic fields
approach reality as the space between
Roble hall and Roble gymnasium rapidly
becomes cleared of buildings and other
obstructions. At the same time, the
University corporation yards are being
centered into a compact, sightly group.
The changes as planned by Comptrol
ler Roth and the administration have
advanced rapidly during the summer bul
there is still much work to be dene be
fore all will be ready for actual work on
the athletic grounds for women stu
dents. The outsanding recent develop
ments in the work have been the tearing
down of the old stable behind the Press
building, the moving of a smaller stable
from across the road to be used in its
place, and the transfer of the old
cemenl storage barn to the rear of the
Press building tor storing paper.
The compelted corporation yards will
he in quadrangle arrangement with all
the buildings facing inward. In the
center will stand the barn which will be
used for storage purposes, and where
the few horses which the University has
retained will he kept. In the >dic<ls
around the yard will he kept lumber,
icv(\. and other supplies.
An important change which will he
effected by the arrangement of the cor
poration yards will he the elimination of
the curve in the road south of the Quad
as it approaches Roble, The southern
isde of the yeards will he in line with
the Press building and the road will con
tinue straight along the outer edge oi
the corporation wall.
Other work in the clearing of the pro
posed athletic grounds will include the
transfer of three cottages in the vicinit)
to tin- intersection of Governor's avenue
and the old county highway near Roble
bridge,
Comptroller Roth has superintended
this work at a surprisingly low cosl t<
the I 'ni\ er h by cle\ er sales and use of
mat -rials already on hand. The work
began with the auctioning of stock and
other Universitj property near the clos<
of the spring quarter.
\-. a result tin corporation yards will
nfined t'i an area less than half as
large as f<trmeilj and will be far mor<
sightly, while StanfoVd women will hav<
the Advantage of adequate athletn
grounds in close proximitj to their dor
