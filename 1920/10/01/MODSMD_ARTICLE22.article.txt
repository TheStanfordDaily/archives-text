# THE 						CREW SITUATION
## 
### 
n\ THE ACTION 1 Of the Board of Athletic Control, crew has been stricken
from the list of major sports at Stanford, and, sorry as we are, to see it
go, it must be concluded that tin 1 Hoard was justified. A glance at the ath
letic budget for the year will bear this out. Crew has been a losing sport
financially for years, and each fall, the Board has been pinched to meet the
crew appropriation. This season it became evident that a basketball pavilion
had to be built and also funds set aside for the proposed football stadium.
In order to accomplish both of these ends, the Board set out to cut down the
budget, and crew, as a constant drain on the treasury, came first. Other
sports have also suffered in their appropriations.
The action of the Board of Athletic Control does not necessarily mean
that crew will be permanently dropped. At any time that eight or ten thou
sand dollars can be raised, the sport can be revived without opposition from
any source. The attempts of the crew men to raise funds from the students
and alumni should be encouraged and supported as fully as possible. Stan
ford men and women are proud of the Cardinal crew successes and any
thing within reason should be done to continue the sport.
