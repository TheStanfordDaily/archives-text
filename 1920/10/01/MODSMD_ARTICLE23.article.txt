fFHE DAILY PALO ALTO takes pleasure in congratulating The Stanford
* Pictorial upon its entrance to the campus journalistic field. For some
time the need for a magazine in which student thought could be freely ex
pressed has been felt and Press Club is the logical organization to issue
such a publication. Heretofore, the members of Press Club combined with
the Alumni Association in publishing the Stanford Illustrated Review, but as
this arrangement has proven unsatisfactory, Press Club has withdrawn and
is now publishing the Pictorial. The new magazine deserves solid student
support.
