"The Americans in the Philippines
ar*, very much opposed to independ

the matter is a. few ambi
tious men who want fo be President
of a new republic, and hence they
desire to make a Republic of the
Philippine Islands, independent of any
other country.
"From my limited I be
lieve that there is a strong sentiment
among the people for independence,
and the argument that a few ambitious
men want independence so they might
have a chance of being President does
not appeal to me for there are men in
til United States who want to be
President of the United States.
"I was very agreeably surprised with
the progress made in the Philippine
Islands since American occupation. I
visited the schools in Manila and never
saw better older or more attention
in any school anywhere. The chil
dren were all clean, neatly dressed
.nid certainly on theor good behavior.
Nearly all of the teachers are Filipino
teachers teaching in the English lan
guage.
"The children seem to have a total
lack of self-consciousness and were
not a bit embarrassed in the presence
of Congressmen and Senators from the
United States. They went through
their exercises, reciting and physical
culture apparently oblivious to their
visitors Poise and lack of self-con
sciousness seem to be a trait of the

Oriental and a good one for it pre
vents action under excitement and
assures calm, deliberate judgment in
governing one self and'others.
"They take great pride in their
schools and have buildings beautiful
in architecture and right: up to the
minute in sanitary conditions. They
also have fine hospitals which are
also thoroughly modern and sanitary."
