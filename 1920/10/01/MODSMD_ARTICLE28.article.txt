Frank W. Healy, San Francisco im
presario, who has given to people of
Stanford and Palo Alto the opportunity
oi hearing some of the greatest con
cert artists of the World, is preparing
another series to be given in the As
sembly hall on dates to be announced
later. As was the plan last year when
Mr. Healy presented Rudolph Ganz,
pianist, Caroline Lazarri, the contralto,
and Mme. GaUi Curci, a "course" will
be presented, the season tickets for the
group selling at a rate lower than the
charge for single admissions.
hirst on the list will come Charles
Hackett. whom the Italians affection
ately refer to as Carlo. Mr. Hackett,
who is now the leading tenor of the
Metropolitan Opera House, is an Ameri
can who has demonstrated in the world
famous La Scala Opera House in Milan.
Italy, that an American-made product
can rival anything the old world has
produced. .
Rauol Vidas, Roumanian horn violin
ist, comes as the second attraction.
Vidas, however, is a product of France,
and as an example of that country's
training and culture, us a exponent of
her exalted artistic ideals, he brings a
vital message from the sister republic.
Vidas, though hut a hoy of 18 years,
has everything that a great violinist
should haveâ€”marvelous technique* deli
cacy of style, wealth of tonal expression.
The third number on Mr. Healy's pro
gram will he that remarkable soprano of
the Metropolitan Opera House, Mme,.
Frances Alda. Alda's beautiful voice
and winsome personality is said to have
won the hearts of all who have heard
her. The best evidence of her popular
ity is found in the fact that in every
place in which she appeared last season.
a special request has been made for her
reappearance this season, with the re
sult that she has already been hooked
for more than seventy concerts in ad
dition to her Metropolitan Opera House
engagements. Mine. Alda, Mr. Hackett
and Mr. Vidas are all under the man
agement of Charles L. Wagner, who is
also the manager of John McCormack
ami Mary Garden, and who has recently
resigned the management of Galli Curci.
