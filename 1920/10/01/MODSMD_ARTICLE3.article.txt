# BORAH CANCELS SPEAKING DATES WITH HIS PARTY
## Republican "Irreconcilable" Gives No Reason for Split With National Committee 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 1- -It was
learned today from reliable sources that
Senator Borah, the leader of the "irrc
concilables" opposed to the League oi
Nations, has notified the Republican
headquarters in New York and Chicago
that he will fill no more speaking dates
under the auspices of the Republican
National Committee. He gave no reas
ons.
The breaking of relations between the
"irreconcilable" leader and the Republi
can party has been expected for several
weeks by those in touch with the situa
tioii. Senator Johnson, of California,
who has shared Borah's views on the
ie of Nations, has made no move
to follow Borah in this G. 0. I'. party
split as yet,
Senator Harding, the Republican can
• !'u,i had expressed the view that the
danger of a split with Borah had b< en
averted but this was evidently based on
the wrong information as later events
proved today. In a statement givei out
by Harding this morning al Marion.
Ohio, he said that all elements of the
Republican party were united on the
League of Nations issue. In replying to
the early reports that Senator Borah
and Johnson had advised him that they
were' going to take the stump unless a
more extreme stand was taken against
the League by the candidate, he said.
•"I'he story is untrue."
In a speech at Enid, Oklahoma, today,
Governor Cox, the Democratic candi
date, declared that no representatives of
the League of Nations can declare war
for the United States under any circum
stances. He said that the League would
have had the power to declare war for
the United States if the view of the
League to Enforce Peace and ex-Presi
dent Taft had prevailed.
