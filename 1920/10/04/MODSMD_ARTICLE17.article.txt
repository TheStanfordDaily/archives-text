Students who are interested in music
and especially in choral training may
register with Mr. Allen, the University
Organist and Choir Director, for mem-
I bership in the University Choir, any

The choir established a reputation
; to be remembered by its performance
on last Decoration Day when it gave
j Verdi's "Requiem." Redfern Mason,
of the San Francisco Examiner, said
that this was the finest rendition of
the Verdi choruses that he had heard
in this country or in Europe.
Work in the choir consists of oc
casional performances of such choral
(masterpieces with the assistance of the
| San Francisco Symphony Orchestra, in
addition to singing at the regular ser-
I vices of the Memorial Church. Uni
versity credit is allowed for the choir
course.
Old choir members should register
for choir only. New mmbers should
see Mr. Allen in his office sometime
this week and should appear next
Sunday morning at 10:45 in the organ
loft in Memorial Church. Rehearsals
i will commence on Thursday evening,
at 7:30 o'clock.
