# PHILIPPINES TO FORM TOPIC OF TUESDAY LECTURE
## Dr. Alice Dwyer Will Discuss Past and Present Situation in Far Eastern Possessions 
### 
esterday and Today in the Philli
pine Islands, will be the subject of the
illustrated lecture tomorrow evening at
7 :30 in the Little Theater by Miss Bessie
Agnes Dwyer of Washington, D. C. An
intimate knowledge of the South Sea
Islands gained by sixteen years residence
in Manila lead to the selection of Miss
Dwyer to deliver the first of the Tues
day evening lectures. While all political
or religious propaganda will be avoided
by the speaker the lecture will be of
special interest in view of the recent
investigation of the Philippines made by
a committee of forty congressmen who
returned to San Francisco last week
after a three months tour of the Orient.
Miss Dwyer has been delegated by
the Honorable James C. de Veyra, Res
ident Commissioner, to speak before
representative American audiences of
present day conditions in our Far East
ern possessions. The civilizations of the
Occident and the Orient have peculiarly
mingled, though not mixed, in the Phil
ippines and form the basis for conditions
that can no where be paralled. The
sharp contrast between the fifteenth and
the twentieth century civilidations now
existant in the islands will be protrayed
by the speaker.
Pictures, in the main colored, will alb
ustrate the lecture and reveal unusual
phases of Philippine life. Miss Dwyer
lias been fortunate in obtaining her col
lection of pictures as both the Insular
Bureau of Washington and the Govern
ment Bureau of Manila have contributed
to the set. The pictures are designed
especially to show the advance made
educationally and industrially since, the
American occupation in 1898.-
