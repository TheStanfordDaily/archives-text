# Oregon Students Try Co-operative Buying
## 
### 
Oregon Agricultural College begins
the school year with a new organization
known as the Managers Co-operative
Association. The fraternity, sorority,
and club houses of the college do their
buying from this association.
A warehouse is owned by the associa
tion in which they keep a large reserve
stock of supplies. Meat, milk, bread,
and wood are furnished to the houses
at a contract price which is much lower
than the retail price. This is made pos
sible by the system of larye scale buying
of the association. A complete stock of
groceries, canned goods and vegetables,
and staple goods are carried by the as
sociation.
Excellent manabement has been se
cured by using the services of a graduate
of the university as head of the organ
ization.^Â®
