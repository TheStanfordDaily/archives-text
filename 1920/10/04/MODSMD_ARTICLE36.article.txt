As far as it can be determined from
past records this represents the most
comprehensive schedule of interstate
games ever arranged by the managers of
Pacific Coast football teams. It has
come to be generally recognized that
these games are a wonderful stimulent
to any form of athletic sport and the
probabilities are that the number of
them will increase rather than diminish
from year to year. It also presents an
opportunity to come to some fairly good
estimate of which is the best team in
the far west and is a step toward the
establishment of a linal Far Western
game for the selection of the team to
play against the Eastern selection for
the New Year's contest at the Tourna
ment of Roses at Pasadena.
