# SOPHOMORES TO KEEP GROUNDS AT CLINIC
## 
### 
A new tradition was instituted into the
University yesterday at the Sophomore
Class meeting when it was decided that
each year the Sophomore Class should
be responsible for the keeping of the
grounds of the Stanford Clinic Home.
Eight members of the class, chosen week
ly from the class role, will go to the
grounds and make those repairs neces
sary to keep the grounds in good con
dition.
Student Body President McElroy gave
a short talk on the manner on which
this new tradition should be carried on
by each Sophomore Class. He then left
the responsibility with the present class
to see that the work was carried on.
Other business that came before the
meeting applied to poster tight and tie
up.
