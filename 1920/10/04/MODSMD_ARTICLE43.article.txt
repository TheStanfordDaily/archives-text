# U. C. CAMPAIGNING FOR AMENDMENT 12
## 
### 
An extensive campaign for support
for amendment 12, to be voted on at
the November election, is being made
at the University of California. This
amendment provides for additional ti
nancial support for the state university
by taxation.
Pictures of crowded classrooms at
California are being made to form part
of the campaign literature.
In the elementary economics class
there are lifty more students enrolled
than there are seats in Wheeler Hall
where the course is held. This is the
largest lecture hall on the campus. An
other economics class has a standing
room in the corridor.
