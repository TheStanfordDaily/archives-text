# TRAVELING COURSE STARTED AT U. C.
## Extension Division Will Give Concert and Lecture Series For the State Communities 
### 
The attention of Stanford music en
thusiasts is called to the action of the
Universit" of California which has re
cently inaugurated a traveling course of
concerts and lecture recitals designed to
bring and explain the best music of all
nations to the urban and rural communi
ties of the state. Ihe National Bureau
for the Advancement of Music was so
impressed with the value of thi plan that
it has urged all the other state universi
ties to follow suit.
Discussing his hopes of duplicating
elsewhere the work of the Berkeley in
stitution, C. M. Tremaine, director of the
Bureau, states:
"The course on the music of all the
nations to be given by the Extension Di
vision of the University of California
seems to me one of the most practical
plans yet evolved for broadening the
people's cultural horizon through the me
dium of music. The lectures and con
certs will show how the various races
develop their own particular songs and
dances, with music the companion in
their work and play and an integral part
of everyday life. This was the rich soil
in which the more complex music of the
various European countries took its root.
"In America, too, we are coming to
sec that music is for all the people, not
iust for the few, and that only on such a
foundation can we build up a national
music of our own. I am very glad that
Professor Waybur, in charge of the mu
sic extension work at the University of
California, had this important considera
tion in mind when he planned the trav
eling course. As he puts it, America em
braces all nations,'and American music
will partake of the richness of each when
we can better understand the manv
sources of our artistic impulses."
Mr. Tremaine is calling the attention
of all the state colleges in the countrv
to what is being done and is referring
them to Professor Waybur for detailed
information.
Mr. Tremaine's opinion as to the bear
ing of the course on the improvement
of civic and social lfie in the communi
ties it visits is concurred in by all other
commentators. Results in this direction
are expected because of the opportunities
the course offers for participation by
members of the community Displays of
carving and fabrics, crockery, paintings,
costumes, and even "folk songs and folk
dances are to be encouraged, and it is
believed that much interesting local talent
will be discovered in the course of the
year. This co-operation is utilized in
connection with the illustrated lecture on
the particular nation under discussion,
which precedes by a few weeks the con
cert demonstrating that nation's music
and portrays the environment in which
that music developed.
For the concerts themselves only pro
fessional talent is used. Artists claimed
by California as her very own will be
recalled from distant places to take part
in the course, and certain local artists
who are rapidly forging ahead to the
front ranks of their profession will also
appear under the auspices of the uni
versity. Among these are Olga Steeb
not of California, who will make their
imd Estelle Heartt Dreyfus. Still others,
teontribution are Miss Clara Pasvolskv,
late of Russia and now of New York,
and Miss Lucine Finch, noted for her ne
(jgro songs. B. B. Baumgardt, a Califor
nium with a national reputatio- will give
certain of the illustrated lectures, using
"the slides he has gathered from all over
the world.
