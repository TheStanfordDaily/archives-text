# EPIDEMIC AFFECTS CALIFORNIA CAPTAIN
## 
### United Press 
It was reported here today that Cort
Majors, California football captain and
bulwark of the Bruin line, was afflicted
with an illness similar to that affecting
the Santa Clara football team. The se
riousness of Major's condition was not
stated.
Santa Clara was forced to cancel its
game with California last Saturday on
account of a mysterious epidemic which
was broken out among the Mission foot
ball stars. Symptoms reported are sim
ilar to those of hay fever but are said to
be much more serious. Recovery is said
to be much slower. It was not known
today whether or not the Santa Clara
eleven would lie able to carry out its
season schedule.

"SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. sâ€”William
Williams and Andrew Harris, negroes,
met in Dreamland rink.
"Mistah Williams," quoth Harris,
"p'haps I can trouble you fo' dat two
bits which you owe me."
Williams, resenting the demand in the
presence of his friends, drew forth a
razor and hopped into action. Skaters
scampered for cover. Harris emerged
from the melee with his arms and back
slashed.
Harries was to appear before Judge
McAtee today on a charge of assault to
commit murder.
