## Upperclass Committee Issues Strict Instructions; Row to be Scene of Annual Contest 
### 
Although minor underclass rivalry
commenced this morning with the ap
pearance of several 1924 posters around
the campus, the annual freshman-soph
more poster tight and tie up will not
hold sway until 4:30 o'clock tomorrow
afternoon, and will continue until 4:20
o'clock Wednesday afternoon. This de
cision was reached at a meeting of the
student body committee of upperclass
men, appointed this year to regulate all
underclass fights.
Definite rules have been alid down by
this committee and violators of these
rules will be taken before the Men's
Council. Contestants must obey the
orders of the upperclassmen explicitly.
Both classes will meet at designated
places tomorrow afternoon following
which they will retreat to a camp in
the hills. During the night the fresh
men will post small groups of scouts
around the campus, in order to prevent
the laying of posters before the final
poster rush on the Row. Abou't 3
o'clock in the morning both classes will
meet on the Delta Kappa Epsilon, Kappa
Alpha, and Kappa Gamma lawns.
The rush and tie-up is scheduled to
take place on the football turf at 4
o'clock on the following afternoon.
Both sides will take opposite ends of
the field, and will rush together when
the gun is fired, each making an effort
to tie up as many as possible of the
opposing class. Pens will be laid out
for each class to bring their captives,
where they will be painted with red
paint. No one can be thrown in the
respective pens without being properly
tied, and no one can leave the pens
after being painted. Varsity "S" men
will patrol the field to keep all rules
enforced on the football field.
The following rules have been made
by the underclass fight committee:
