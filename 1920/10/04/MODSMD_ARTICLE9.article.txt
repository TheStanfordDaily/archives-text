## 
### United Press 
The Stanford freshmen found the
Mare Island Marine football team too
strong an opponent last Saturday after
noon on the local field when the sailors
defeated the first-year players by a score
of 17 to 6. The game was played as a
preliminary contest for the Varsity-St.
Mary's scrimmage.
Coach Duffy Seay's men showed a
marked improvement over their exhibi
tion in a practice game against the Palo
Alto High School eleven the preceding
Tuesday. The coach is slowly but sure
ly finding promising material, and is de
veloping this material into an aggrega
tion that will be presentable within the
next week.
The Marines made two touchdowns
grabbed the ball on a Marine's fumble
and one drop-kick from the field, Stan
ford's only points, being made when Judv
grabbed the ball on a Marion's fumble
and ran twenty yards for a touch. The
kick was not converted.

Stanford—Fuller, r. e.; Greenwood, r.

LONDON, October 4.—The enemies
of Bolshevism were crashing through
the soviet armies on two fronts today.
Rumors by way of Scandinavian coun
tries indicated that the Russian affairs
were in turmoil, with strikes and
hunger adding to the difficulties of
the soviet rulers. A military state
ment from Warsaw said that the Pol
ish troops were almost unhampered in
their advance eastward.
