ANNOUNCEMENT!
|| By careful analysis it has been determined that the average cost f
u of opening and carrying a checking account in Palo Alto is approxi- i
mately $8.75 per annum. j
11 Any checking account which maintains a balance less than $100.00 f
|| is carried at a loss by the bank. J
|| Palo Alto and Mayfield are essentially residential and university |
communities, consequently, the business of the local banks is largely «
made up of innumerable small personal checking accounts. f
The cost of stationery, supplies, salaries, and in fact every item of f
|| expense connected with the operation of a bank has increased enor- |
mously within the last few years. i
ii In view of the above, the banks in Palo Alto and Mayfield have i
reached the unanimous conclusion that they cannot longer afford to j
II carry these unprofitable accounts without any charge. |
|| Beginning October 1, 1920. the undersigned banks will make a |
monthly charge of 50 cents against commercial accounts the balance «
|| of which at any time during the month shall fall below $50.00. |
