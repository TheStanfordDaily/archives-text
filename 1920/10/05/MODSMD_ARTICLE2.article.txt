# CHARLES BOTSFORD SUCCEEDS ACKER AS INTRAMURAL COACH
## 
### 
Charles B. Botsford, a graduate of
Springfield College in physical educa
tion, arrived on the campus yesterday
to assume the duties of Director of
Intramural Athletics recently vacated
by the resignation of Art Acker. The
new director comes to Stanford un
usually well prepared to aid Dr. A. D.
Browne in carrying out his reorganized
plan of intramural competition. Last
year Botsford was at the University
of California occupying the same po
sition to which he has been assigned
at Stanford.
A varied and successful experience
as a physical director for the past
fourteen years lead to the selection
of the new Intramural Director, states
Dr. Browne. Following his graduation
from college in 1906, Botsford was
Assistant Physical Director at Colum
bia University for four years. Re
signing to become Athletic Director
of the Michigan School of Mines, Bots
ford gave up the position after two
years in order to accept a position as
Director at Reed College of Portland.
His seven years experience in the
Oregon College has given Botsford an
established reputation on the coast as
a successful athletic coach.
The new coach will not only over
see intramural athletics but will have
general supervision of all gymnasium
work. Dr. Browne intends to enlarge
the position held by Acker and as
sign general promotion work to the
new director.
