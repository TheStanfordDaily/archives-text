# CLEVELAND WINS FROM BROOKLYN IN FIRST GAME OF 1920 SERIES
## DODGERS UNABLE TO OVERCOME LEAD TAKEN BY INDIANS IN EARLY INNINGS OF OPENING GAME 
### 
' ' 1 EBBe'tt's FIELD, Brooklyn, Oct. s.—Cleveland, playing faultless base
ball, took the first game of the World's Series from the Brooklyn Nationals
today by a score of three to one. Covaleskie, the ex-Coast League pitcher,
held the Dodgers to five scattered hits, and by his cool, level-headed perform
ance in the box, was the star of the game.
The game opened with "Rube" Marquard, the veteran "south-paw" in
the box for Brooklyn. The first inning was an uneventful one, neither side
registering a hit. In the second, Burns led off with a single and Konetcliy,
the Dodger first baseman, helped him around with the only error of the day.
Burns' score from first on Konetchy's boot was the most sensational play
of the game.

After the smoke had finally cleared
off around first base, Wood walked and
Sewell followed with a single. 'O'Neill,
the Indian's star catcher, brought Wood
home on a timely double. After the fa
tal scoring had been done the Dodgers
tightened up and caught Sewell at third.
Covaleskie furnished the final out in the
disastrous second.
Cleveland scored again in the fourth
canto when Wood doubled and O'Neill
repeated with his second double of the
day, scoring Wood.
Brooklyn batters got their first hit off
Covaleskie when Olson singled in the
fourth. Griffith also managed to get a
single off the trusty Pole, but the Robins
failed to do any scoring until the sev
enth. In the seventh period, "Zach"'
Wheat led off with a double and scored
on a sacrifice by Konetchy.
Sparkling fielding stunts abounded ia
the game. A brilliant catch by Griffith
in the fifth inning when the Brooklynite
leaped against the right-Held wall to pull
down a drive from the bat of "Tris"
Speaker, was the high-water mark of the
game from the fielding angle. It was
one of the prettiest catches that ever
took the breath away from a world's
series audience.
Brooklyn pulled Marquard from the
box in the seventh and put in Mamaux.
Mamaux seemed to be a worthy choice,
for he justified it by taking three strike
outs away from the next three Indians
that faced him. "Uncle" Wilbert Robin
son evidently pulled a fox play when he
pulled Mamaux from the game at the
end of this inning. As long as Mamaux
was pitching in such great form, he prob
ably figured to save him for some future
game that hadn't gone quite so far to
(the dogs. Cadore finished the game.
