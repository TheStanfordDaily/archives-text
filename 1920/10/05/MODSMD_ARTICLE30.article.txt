# SYSTEM FOR DIVIDING RECEIPT OF WORD'S SERIES COMPLICATED
## Contesting Clubs Get 60 Per Cent on First Five Games 
### 
Division of the thousands of dollars
paid by baseball fans to witness the
world's series games is annually the topic
of curious interest as is the division of
any large sum of money.
Because- of the fact that the money is
divided in such an involved manner it
is well nigh impossible for the average
fan to figure out ahead of time just how
much the winning and losing teams will
receive.
The receipts for the first five games
are divided 10 per cent to the nationa
commission. 60 per. cent of the balance to
the" contesting clubs, and the remaining
40 per cent goes to all the club owners.
I f more than five, games are necessary
the extra games receipts are cut the same
way.
! he players' share is cut again in the
following manner: The two contesting
clubs receive 75 per cet of this amount
split 6P per cent to the winners and 40
per cent to the losers. The remaining
25 per cent is divided among the teams
finishing second and third in each league.
This 25 per cent is divided 60 per cent to
the two second-place teams and 40 per
cent to the t wothird-place teams.
There is another provision in the reg
ulations which makes it possible to in
crease the amounts fur each individual
player taking part in the world's series.
Since the regulations provide for a slice
of the "melon" going to the second and
third teams, it also has been provided
that if these teams engage in any post
season series, 50 per cent of the players'
share of the receipts shall he divided on
the basis of 60 per cent to the winner
and 40 per cent to the loser, and the
balance shall go into th<? players' pool
of the world's scries to be divided
among the players of the contesting
teams in the world's scries and the play
ers of the teams finishing second and
third, as explained before.
The owners of clubs taking part in
the world's series do not get all the
money from the receipts even after the
share of the national commission and
the players are deducted. The regula
tions provide that after these have been
subtraced the balance of the gross re
ceipts shall be divided equally between
the two clubs. The club owners, how
ever, are obliged to pay into the treas
uries of their respective leagues 50 per
cent of their gross receipts up to seven
games, and if it be necessary to play
tlie eighth and ninth games, then 75 per
cent of the gross receipts received by
the two clubs under this division shall
be paid into t heleague treasuries.
