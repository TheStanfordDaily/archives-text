# ON THE SQUARE
## 
### 
rpHE INTERFRATERNITY CONFERENCE, composed of representatives of
all of the fraternities on the campus, has laid down certain rules to
govern the rushing and pledging of freshmen this year. Chief of these rules
is one that restricts all rushing to the campus and Palo Alto. The law was
made to eliminate the heavy expense which the chapters incurred last fall.
It is plain and means what it says, but still it is being disobeyed. The
fraternities that follow these tactics will also find it easy to evade the law
that states that all bidding of freshmen shall be done through a lawyer.
Infractions of the rushing rules have been very slight so far, and they may
appear harmless, but nevertheless, the conference passed these laws, and
expects tliim to lie obeyed. Penalties are provided for all infractions.
However, it is a pleasure to state that as a whole, the Stanford chapters
are "011 the square." Freshman students can only be warned that when a
fraternity attempts to violate a rushing rule, that the chapter is not on the
square, and the men in it are not the right kind to associate with.
