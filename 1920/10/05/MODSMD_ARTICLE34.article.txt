# UNIVERSITIES OF STATE OPPOSING MEDICAL MEASURE
## Sentiment Aroused by Proponents of Anti-Vivisection Law is Protested 
### 
Stanford University and the Univer
sity of California have united in making
a joint public protest against the Atiti
\ ivisection law, which is Amemnent
No. 7 on the ballot for November 2.
A storm of sentiment has been raised
by the initiators of this law against
vivisection, claiming that cruelty to ani
mals is going on in this state and that
this measure would relieve such abuses.
Medical journals, universities and peo
ple of intelligence have quickly seen the
great harm that would arise from the
passage of such a law.
A section from the joint statement of
the two universities follows:
"The Univesrity of California and
Stanford University are vitally interest
ed in this initiative measure since its
passage would stop the research work
now going on in their medical schools,
hospitals, and laboratories, and in the
Bureau of Animal Industry. The stud
ies on botulism in olives, which will
not only save the ripe olive industry of
the state, but many lives, would cease,
as would likewise the manufacture of
serum for the prevention of hog cholera,
the preparation of vaccine for anthrax,
and the various other measures that an
nually asve millions of dollars and pre
vent great suffering among domestic
animals. Even feeding experiments on
animals would be impossible.
"No worse attack on the welfare of
the state and on the right of the Uni
versity to seek and teach the truth could
be made. Every man, woman and child,
every unborn babe, every domestic ani
mal in the state will be affected if this
measure becomes a law. It is unneces
sary special legislation due to prejudice
and misinformation. No one will toler
ate cruelty to animals. The present laws
of the state are drastic and quite suffic
ient to control any abuse. We know
that there is no cruelty to animals in
the laboratories of the universities.
They are in charge of men and women
of theliighest character, who are unsel
fishly working to better the lot of their
fellowmen. Anesthetics are always used
for animals in the laboratory in exactly
the same way that they are used by
surgeons in the operating room. The
real object of the anti-vivisectionist is
not the prevention of cruelty to animals,
but the prevention in science and med
icine."
The Daily Palo Alto Times for Octo
ber has the following editorial upon the
subject:
"The knowledge on which the physic
ian and health officer base their pre
scriptions and tests is founded largely
on studies made on animals. To stop
these studies, as the proposed anti-vivi
section constitutional amendment would
do, would block further advance along
the lines that yield this knowledge and
prevent its application in many instances
in which the knowledge has already been
obtained.
"For the protection of our own health,
the health of our animals, and for the
prosperity that depends upon animal
production we must protect the physic
ian and scientist in their studies on liv
ing animals. We must vote down the
proposition to bar them from the utiliz
ation of vivisection."
