# LIBRARY SECURES VALUABLE WAR FILES
## 
### 
October 5, 1920.
Stanford has acquired another notable
War History collection to be added to
those housed in the University Library.
This latest collection is files from tlnj
Paris office of the Research Information
Service. It has been obtained through
Professor W. R Durand, head of the
department of Mechanical Engineering,
at the University, who was in charge of
this Paris office.
The collection offers a complete record
of the scientific work on war problems
carried on, especially during the last
years of the war, by the United States,
Great Britain, France and Italy. It is
unique among libraries since no other
copies exist except those in the official
files in Washington.
Much of this material was of the most
confidential character during the war
and some of it is of the same character
still. It will be kept intact in the library
of the University and for the present
will be available for examination only
under special authority.
The war time Research Information
Service was organized by the National
Research Council under the joint author
ity of the Secretaries of War and Navy,
and for the purpose of effecting an ade
quate interchange of information re
garding all scientific "work on war prob
lems. Foreign offices were established
in Paris, London, and Rome, and be
tween these offices and Washington there
was a constant interchange of reports
regarding scientific research and scien
tilic problems relating to the war.
The files of the Paris office thus con
tain copies of all reports originating in
France and sent to Washington, also ex
change copies of all reports sent from
London and Rome to Washington, and
in addition, the originals of all reports
received from Washington for transmis
sion to the French and to the American
Military forces abroad.
When the Paris office of the Research
Information Service was closed after the
war the files were turned over to the
American Embassy for safe keeping.
Through a misunderstanding, however,
the Embassy returned them to Washing
ton instead of retaining them in Paris
as had been intended.
On being consulted by the authoriti-s
in Washington regarding tin? proper (lis
position of this material, Professor Du
rand, promptly made application on be
half of the University, that they be
stored in the Library of Stanford Uni
versity.
Since much of this material was ot
such confidential character, this permis
sion could not be granted without refer
ence to the chiefs of the Military and
Naval Intelligence Services, but in due
time the necessary authority was issued.
The material has been forwarded to Pro
fessor Durand for storage in the Uni
versity Library.
