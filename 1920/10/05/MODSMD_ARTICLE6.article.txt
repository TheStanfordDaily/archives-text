# DR. WILBUR WILL GREET NEW CLASS
## Welcoming Assembly Will be Held in Assembly Hall at 11:00 O'clock Tomorrow 
### 
"Welcome to Stanford" will be the
keynote of the speeches at the welcom
ing assembly to be held tomorrow
morning, in the Assembly Hall at 11
o'clock. It is customary for such a
gathering to take place early in the
quarter, in order that the incoming
class may lie imbued with something
of the same spirit that permeates
those who have already spent some
time at Stanford.
Owing to the unusually large num
ber of students who are registered
this year, it is expected that the hall
will be very crowded, and it will be
a gooil plan for everyone to be on
time in order that the assembly may
be started on time.,
President Wilbur will give the open
ing address, in which he will outline
the policy of Stanford, and describe its
magnificent spirit. Other Speakers
will be Professor Mitchell, head of
the Lower Division, who will discuss
the new system of study; Dean Har
riot Bradford, who will welcome the
women, and Dean Culver, the new
Dean of Men, will speak relative to
the men's problems.
Another assembly will be called
next week to discusse regular stu
dent body business.
