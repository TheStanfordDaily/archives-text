ANNOUNCEMENT! j
' careful analysis it has been determined that the average cost |
ening and carrying a checking account in Palo Alto is approxi- I
y $5.75 per annum. f
ly checking account which maintains a balance less than .$lOO.OO I
tried at a loss by the bank. f
do Alto and Mayfield are essentially residential and university j
mnities, consequently, the business of the local banks is largely |
up of innumerable small personal checking accounts. ?
le cost of stationery, supplies, salaries, and in fact every item of ?
lse connected with the operation of a bank has increased enor- t
ly within the last few years. 1
view of the above, the banks in Palo Alto and Mayfield have i
ed the unanimous conclusion that they cannot longer afford to ?
these unprofitable accounts without any charge. |
}ginning October 1, 1920, the undersigned banks will make a T
lilv charge of 50 cents against commercial accounts the balance I
lich at any time during the month shall fall below $50.00. f

Every Stanford student should realize the need of j
! an effective student magazine of opinion. An open j
I forum of student thought, a medium for independent f
f discussion of student problems is of the greatest neces- ?
t sity for the Stanford Student Body today. Without it !
(student opinion, undergraduate ideas and Stanford j
traditions will perish. £
The Stanford Pictorial will fill this need —but it can j
] only be made effective by getting the fullest support \
f from every Stanford student. f
