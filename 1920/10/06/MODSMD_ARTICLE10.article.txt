# TRY OUTS CLOSE TOMORROW FOR YELL LEADERS
## 
### 
Tryouts for the yell leaders were
to have closed this afternoon but on
account of the rush and tie-up there
will be no meeting at the Zete house.
Yell Lleader Wendell Kinney an
nounces that tryouts will be held to
morrow afternoon at the Zete Psi
house on Lagunita Drive at 4 p.m.
These will be absolutely the last, as
the time cannot be stretched out any
further. At the present time there is
a good chance for any man in the
junior class to make the place of as
sistant yell leader as the response has
been very slight so far in the tryouts.
Kinney asks that any junior having
a good voice or bad voice that can be
heard and any talent for leading, to
come out and try for the job.
