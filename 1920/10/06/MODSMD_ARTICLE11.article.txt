# CARDINAL ELEVEN MEETS WINGED "0" TEAM SATURDAY
## 
### 
Coach Powell's football squad will
match itself against the Olympic Club
eleven next Saturday afternoon on the
local field at 3 o'clock. Saturday's
game will be a good means to test
the relative strength of the Cardinal
gridiron warriors with tha Univer c ity
of California and the Santa Clara
teams, since the two latter named
have already met the athletic club
eleven.
Stanford's prospects look brighter
daily with the steady improvement of
the men out for the squad. Powell
is working hard with the backfield
men while Carpenter, the newly ap
pointed assistant varsity coach is pay
ing special attention to the work of
the men trying out for line positions.
Carpenter is an All-Western center
and last year captained the Wiscon
sin eleven.
Both the Stanford line and backfield
are strong this year, Coach Powell
devloping an all-around strong team
instead of a team with part stars and
part mediocre material. As shown in
last Saturday's game the line should
be able to plow through opposing lines
for large holes, while the backfield
will always be ready to take advant
age of these holes.
It is hoped that Jack Patrick and
"Swede" Righter will return to the
campus next week. If these two last
year's stars are able to get in train
ing before the trip to the University
of Southern California on October 16.
Stanford's chances of a victory will
be greatly strengthened. Righter and
Patrick have been traveling in Eu
rope with the All-Star California rugby
team and according to all reports will
be in fair shape to start playing im
mediately on their return.
