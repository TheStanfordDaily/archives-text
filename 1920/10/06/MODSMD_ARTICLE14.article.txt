A student manager for every student
activity is the object of a plan adopt
ed for a trial at Stanford by the exe
cutive committee last night. The pro
posal was presented by Graduate Man
ager Ed Martin, on behalf of the Board
of Athletic Control. It is in use suc
cessfully at Harvard, Dartmouth, the
University of California, and other
colleges, he said.
The plan provides a senior manager
for each major sport, with several
junior assistants, and as many upper
classmen as he needs. These men
will be considered candidates for the
office. One manager for all minor
sports is proposed, and a manager for
each other branch of university activi
ty. with the same system of assist
ants.
This plan will not interfere with
the present offices of graduate and stu
dent manager. The committee last
night selected Martin to carry on the
duties of manager in addition to the
graduate manager's office.
A series of six meetings for fresh
men men and women, similar to the
"Stanford Standards" meetings by the
Y. M. C. A. last year to inform the
newcomers of Stanford traditions and
customs, was decided on by the com
mittee last night.
It was decided to include the fresh
men women in the meetings after
pleas in their behalf were made by
Anne Hardy, '21. and Melba Berry,
'22, who declared that this was the
best way to inform them of Stanford
traditions. .
An investigation of the system of
managing the Quad is to be made by
a committee of the executive commit
tee to be selected by President Mc
: Elroy.
