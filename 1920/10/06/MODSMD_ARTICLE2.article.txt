# SOPHS WIN ANNUAL POSTER LAYING SCRAP
## '23-Men Routed by Babes in Afternoon; Come Back Strong With Water 
### 
The poster fight started off yester
day afternoon when a hundred and
fifty "freshmen jumped the 4-o'clock
gun and took after the sophomores
in front of Encina Hall. The '23
class was divided into two groups,
about seventy-five being in front of
Encina and some thirty or more up
at the A. T. O. house. When the
freshmen showed up on the horizon
the crowd at Encina took to their
heels and hit. for the hills. In the
field back of the Delta Delta Delta
house the babes overtook the sophs
and a battle royal ensued. The angry
mob surged back and forth until fin
ally the sophomores withdrew, leav
ing about thirty of their men in the
hands of '24. The frosh then with
drew to Sequoia Hall where they pre
pared to bivouac. They later moved
up to the field across from the Phi
Gamma Delta house and took up their
night's vigil. '
The sophomores took up their camp
in the center of the lake bottom and
sent out foragin? parties to bring in
belated comrades and the food that
they had hidden away.
Karly in the evening the rain began
to fall and the night .turned to one
of chill and rainy vind. About 3:15
rhe parties left their respective camps
and met on the row in fyont of the
Kappa Alpha house. A battle ensued
and the water began to flow under the
guidance of the husky sophs. Superi
or organization on the part of the
second-year men soon counted against
the more loosely organized frosh and
the habes began to break under the
systematic wetting of the compact
gangs of the '23 men. The fight raged
up and down in front of the Kappa
Alpha, Kappa Sigma, and Delta Kappa
Epsilon houses until the final gun was
fired. At that time there were only
a handful of freshmen at the frosh
faucet. The victory went every way
to the second-year men.
This morning there were many post
ers still in evidence around the cam
pus. They were in such conspicuous
places that the victory in the poster
contest must be awarded to the '23
men.
The tie-up came off this afternoon
at 4:00 The sophomores were busy
all day making away with the frosh
and again their superior organization
counted against, the futile efforts of
the first-year men. The freshmen put
up a game scrap but were outclassed
from the start and were nearly all in
the "soph" pen when the final gun
was sounded.

Alpha, Kappa Sigma, and Delta Kappa
Epsilon houses until the final gun was
fired. At that time there were only
a handful of freshmen at the frosh
faucet. The victory went every way
to the second-year men.
This morning there were many post
ers still in evidence around the cam
pus. They were in such conspicuous
places that the victory in the poster
contest must be awarded to the '23
men.
The tie-up came off this afternoon
at 4:00 The sophomores were busy
all day making away with the frosh
and again their superior organization
counted against, the futile efforts of
the first-year men. The freshmen put
up a game scrap but were outclassed
from the start and were nearly all in
the "soph" pen when the final gun
was sounded.
