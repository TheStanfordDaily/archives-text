# HARD FIGHT FOR U.S. IN NEXT OLYMPIAD
## America in Need of More Long Distance Runners

NEW YORK, Oct. 6.—"America is
through. 1 lie athletic crown worn so
long by the United States is destined for
another head in the Olympic games of
1924." . *
This boast was made in Antwerp by
the Finns and the Swedes following the
late ()lympic contests in which the
Americans were overwhelmingly victor
ious.
The failure of the Americans to "clean
u])" in the track events above the sprints
led the foreign experts to draw the con
elusion that the new generation of
Yankee athletes lacks endurance and
stamina.
It is a matter of record that the Amer
icans did fail to take any of the distance
events with the exception of the 3000-
metre team race, won on the last day of
the games.
lint the conclusion of the European
critics that the poor showing was the
result of a decline in the physical powers
of the new school of American athletes
is wrong.
The American distance runners did
not sweep the track as did the sprinters,
because they had no opportunity to train.
The time was so short before the open
ing of the games, the conditions so dis
agreeable on their trip to Antwerp and
the weather so abominable that they
were the victims of unavoidable circum
stances. The Swedes and the Finn - .,
whose power was noted in the long dis
tance runs, had the advantage of two
weeks, in Antwerp previous to the open
ing of the games, during which the}
were able to use the stadium track daily
and get acclimated to the peculiar weath
er conditions.
It is a fact that America had a harder
time to win the 1920 games than she
ever had before and it is a foregone con
clusion that she will have much stilfer
opposition in 1924.
Seizing upon the showing made by the
American distance men, the foreign na
tions especially. Sweden, Finland and
England are going to set out to develop
new talent in the field and track events
in which the Americans were able to
make a cleanup that gave them victory.
America's task before the next games
will be to develop a new school of dis
tance runners and to lind youngsters to
take the place of Pat McDonald, Paddy
Ryan, Matt McGrath, Dan Abeam, Mike
1 )eVanney, Ted Meredith and some
others of the "old school" who showed
in the last games that they are through.
England, strong in the running events,
will turn her attention to the develop
ment of hurdles and field stars. The
Swedes feel the necessity of developing
a bunch of good sprinters. rheFinns
superstars in the javelin, will set out to
develop other field stars and sprinters to
help balance a team strong in long dis
tance power.
American athletic officials have already
started a campaign to encourage athlet
ics in high schools. Their hope is to
have eventually a skilled man in charge
of athletics who can discourage young
athletes from "burning themselves out'
in trying to win every event on the pro
gram. The Swedes, under the direction
of Ernie Hjertsberg, have gone into
"specialization" with the greatest suc
cess. They hold up the idea to the
youngsters that it is better to excel in
one event than to be half-good in a
dozen.
The next Olympic probably will be
held in Los Angeles. The International
Olympic Committee meets in Lucerne
next spring and will decide between the
California city and Rome, which has
been making a strong bid for the games.
Los Angeles seems to be the favorite.
The Swedes, Finns, English and French
disgusted with the manner in which the
games were conducted in Antwerp, have
demanded that the games be given to
America, not only because they believe
an American city can handle them best
but because they are anxious to get the
"joy ride trip" to the Pacific Coast.
Held in America, the next games
would not present as many problems, for
the Americans that would be faced by
the necessity of another long trip to a
foreign country. The weather condi
tions in California would be ideal for
the Americans, the short trip would in
sure the good condition of the men and
more talent could he made available for
final selection.
If the powers directing amateur athlet
ics in the United States can interest
•young athletes more in the mile, two
mile and the longer events and shatter
the idea that a sprinter the greatest hero
on the track much will he done, to make
a 1924 team better balanced than the one
which carried the shield this year.
With such high class coaches in charge
of the track squads at all the big uni
versities the outlook is much brighter
as American teams of the future will
become more and more distinctive col
legiate outfits.
America has the talent, lias the best
system of athletics in the world, the
most adept pupils and with a little more
attention on the part of the officials in
charge of the governing bodies of ath
letics, there is no need of prying into
1924 in search of dark clouds.
