## 
### 
The time-honored "cord" trousers of
the upper classes in the University of
California have received a blow from the
maternal side of some California-going
I family. Some mater not an Alma Mater
j is touched to the Kwick by the of
| doughty men who parade to Berkeley
j campus in the low-brow garb of the
banana peddler and upperclassman. The
following letter appeared in the People's
| Safety Valve of the Chronicle :
"May I endeavor to answer a
["Troubled Mother" regarding the wear
ing of corduroy by the upper clasasnien
j of the University of California
"The wearing of corduroy by the up
per classmen only is a time-honored cus
tom supported by the faculty and stu
dents. To quote Dean Probert of the
'College of Mining: 'Corduroy on tlie
! campus denotes the successful laborer in
: the field of study. It is a mark of at
tainment in our community, recognized
by all.'
"Regarding the relative cost of cordu
! Roy and ordinary cloth, it has been my
experience that there is very little dif
j ference in price.
"The under clasainen are at liberty to
I adopt khaki, for instance, as the material
from which to make their trousers. It
I seems unnecessary to point out that the
under classmen would not care to wear
tlie corduroy if the tradition did not
exist. It is only in the West that the
tradition exists; in the East men of all
classes were the best they possess.
"It is a distinction that has stood the
j l est of time and therefore should not be
changed. U. C. '21."
