# SENIOR MANAGER TRY-OUTS CALLED
## New University Competition Leading to Senior Block 'S' Begins to 1 :'15 Tomorrow 
### 
All candidates for the new manager
positions to be opened by the new
system for conducting athletic and
student activity will meet in Graduate
Manager Martin's office, at 1:15 p.m.
tomorrow. According to the announce
ment a senior manager will be chosen
for all student activities.
Each Senior manager will have
several assistant junior managers and
an unlimited number of underclass
men trying for the positions to be
awarded in the senior year. To gain
the position of senior sport manager
tryoutees must obtain the recom
mendation of the captain of the sport
with which they are working, the
coach, the physical director and the
graduate manager. The manager of
student activity will be appointed on
recommendation of the President of
the Associated Students and the Grad
uate Manager.
If the system proves successful this
year, letters will be awarded to the
men who next year succeed to the
position of senior manager. No pro
vision was made for the granting of
letters this year, though action may be
taken on this later. The letters will
be similar to the regular block "S"
but distinguished in some way from
them.
This system is much like that used
in many of the large eastern universi
ties, and was passed upon by the Exe
cutive Committee last night on recom
mendation of the Board of Control.
