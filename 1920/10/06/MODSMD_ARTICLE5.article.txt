## Students and Alumni Secure Reservation of Seats Thru Graduate Manager's Office 
### 
Students may apply for one ticket to
the rooter's section and two reservations
in the alumni bleachers for the Califor
nia-Stanford big-game on November 20.
Applications for seats will be received
by the Graduate Manager only on regu
lar printed forms which will be distrib
uted to all students and mailed to alumni
on the lltli of October.
The applications cill be accepted in the
following manner: lirst students in the
rooter's section, then alumni in the
alumni section, then students in the
alumni section.
California and Stanford have similar
forms and the rules for distribution of
tickets are the same in both universities.
The seating capacity of the California
bleachers is now 27,000 and a number of
additional seats will be built. 100 boxes
of about eight scats each will construct
ed around the edge of the field, for the
use of alumni and press representatives.
All student applications for seats must
be in by 6 p. m.. October 22, and alumni
must apply by November 1. Alumni
tickets will be mailed out November 10
and student tickets will be distributed
between November 12th and 15th.
In applying for tickets everyone must
agree to use one of them personally,
and not to sell others for profit. The
penalty for scalping this year will be
blacklisting and in the future no person
on the black list will be sold tickets.
Should any seats be not taken they will
be offered to the public. This system in
general is used in conducting the large
eastern games.
