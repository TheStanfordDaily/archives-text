# FIRST ASSEMBLY TODAY WELCOMES 1924 STUDENTS
## Stanford Ideals and Standards Explained in Speeches by Faculty Student Advisers 
### 
Sounding - the keynote for the whole
welcoming assembly held this morning
in the Assembly Hall, Dean Culver sai<l
in opening his address, "the University
welcomes its men and women for what
they now are, and even more for what
they someday will be." Dean Culver
is an old Stanford man and is imbued
with the Stanford spirit to a high de
gree. His remarks upon the subject
were greeted with a great deal of en
thusiasm.
The thing that is the big problem
facing Stanford men when they matric
ulate is the responsibility of making good
on their own initiative, according to
Dean Culver. Stanford men should at
all times and under all conditions, be
gentlemen. Their moral, physical and
intellectual life is truly as important as
their intellectual life. Dean Culver
closed by saying that Stanford traditions
are the living memorials of Stanford
spirit, which although unseen to the eye,
lives in the soul of every Stanford man,
no one of whom is too big, or too busy,
too weak or too small to take part in
this thing.
Dean Harriet Bradford, speaking
especially to the women but also to the
men, complimented the entering fresh
man class, and told the women that they
were unique in that they are the lirst
class to enter college after the complete
emancipation of women by Act of Con
gress had taken place. Stanford women,
said Dean Bradford, must measure up
to Stanford men. To do this they must
realize that they are part of a community
of interest, and of a social unit, and
therefore must not indulge in license,
mistaking it for freedom. Taking a
new track, Dean Bradford turned to the
men and asked them what was their
opinion of Stanford women, adding that
whatever their standard is, the women
will measure up to it.
Dr. Gardner next addressed the As
sembly in his inimitable manner, start
ing off by saying "once a year he was
allowed in this way to see his congre
gation." Three things that Stanford
people should do are to reverence prop
erty, reverence traditions and develop
good manners and morals.
Mrs. Snell, Appointment Secretary
spoke briefly upon the duties and work
of her office, and cordially invited all
the students who need assistance to seek
it there. According to Mrs. Snell's
statistics, 110 of the students are paying
every cent of their way through college,
while 5-12 are earning part of their ex
penses, making a total per cent of -0.7
who are partially or wholly self support -
ing.
Several points of importance were em
phasized by President Wilbur, in his
closing speech. The necessity and ex
pediancy of an honor system for Stan
ford was one of the principal points.
President Wilbur was very strong in Ins
assertion that Stanford will not allow
any kind of indecency among its stu
dents, or anv unfairness from its teams
or its bleachers. The opportunity for
clean, wholesome athletics was pointed
out, and the entering men urged to par
ticipate in some form of sport.
Liberal applause and cheers greeted ail
the speakers. The Assembly closed with
the singing of "Hail, Stanford Hail."
