### 
Boxing at Stanford is already be

collegiate featherweight championship

of milling is also on deck.
Hensold and Spiers in the light
weight division are in training. These
two boys met on several occasions
last vear to attempt, to settle the little

start him in the first tournament of
the year and expects great things of
him. Hcrley Carter, '23, is the young

member of the Olympic Club of San
Francisco, where he was prominent in
boxing. He was also a member of
the crack boxing team of the Navy

Over one hundred have signed up
