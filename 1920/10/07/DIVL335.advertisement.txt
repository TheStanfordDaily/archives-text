ANNOUNCEMENT! j
By careful analysis it has been determined that the average coat |
|| of opening and carrying a checking account in Palo Alto is approxi- I
mately $8.75 per annum. j
Any checking account which maintains a balance le»s than $100.00 j
is carried at a loss by the bank. J
|| • Palo Alto and Mayfield are essentially residential and university ?
I! communities, consequently, the business of llie local banks is largely i
made up of innumerable small personal checking accounts. ?
The cost of stationery, supplies, salaries, and in fact every item of f
|| expense connected with the operation of a bank has increased enor- |
] |mously within the last few years. |
!! In view of the above, the banks in Palo Alto and Mayfield have k
reached the unanimous conclusion that they cannot longer afford to ?
|| carry these unprofitable accounts without any charge. f
|| Beginning October 1, 1920, the undersigned banks will make a I
!! monthly charge of f>o cents against commercial accounts the balance •
of which at any time during the month shall fall below $50.00.
The Bank of Palo Alto, I
The First National Bank, f
