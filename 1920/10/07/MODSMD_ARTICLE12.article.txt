# STANFORD WILL MEET SANTA CLARA ON THE NEW MISSION TURF
## 
### 
Stanford has.been scheduled to meet
the Santa Clara football squad on the
Santa Clara field on {-Saturday, October
I 23. The game originally to have been
played at Stanford, will take place on
a turf which has just been completed.
New and excellent bleachers have
been erected especially for the Stan
! ford-Santa Clara conflict. This will
be Santa Clara's big game of the year
: and is the basis for their awarding of
block letters.
Yell Leader Kinney has arranged
| for a special Stanford rooting section
and arrangements have been made for
the Stanford roters to leave en masse
on a special train which is to leave
Palo Alto at 2:29, arriving at Santa
Clara at 2:56. Kinney is anxious to
have as large an aggregation as pos
sible to attend the game, as this will
be the first tryout of this year's root
ing organization. Santa Clara has
planned some novel bleacher stunts
and the Cardinal section is also to ar
range similar effects. Admission will
be free to Stanford students upon pre
sentation of registration cards.
The new Santa Clara bleacher and
field were built particularly for the
Stanford-Santa Clara competition, and
the Missionites have long been worthy
rivals nf StnnfnrH
