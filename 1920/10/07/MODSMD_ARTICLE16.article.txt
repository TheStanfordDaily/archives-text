# BROOKLYNITES AGAIN ARE VICTORS OVER SPEAKER'S AGGREGATION, SCORE 2-1
## SHERROD SMITH HOLDS INDIANS TO THREE BLOWS -'SPOKE' SPEAKER SCORES CLEVELAND'S FIRST RUN IN SEVENTEEN INNINGS 
### United Press 
EBBETTS FIELD, October 7. —Brooklyn won the third game of the World's
Series from the Cleveland Indians today, by a score of 2 to 1. The series
now stands Brooklyn two games, Cleveland one.
Sherrod Smith pitched for the Dodgers and let the Indians down with
three lone hits. Manager Tris Speaker of the Cleveland Indians started Cald
well, former New York Yankee slabster, but pulled him in the first inning
after Brooklyn had chasen two runs across.
"Duster" Mails, finished the game for Cleveland and held the opposition
scoreless for the last eight innings.

Trouble started in the first frame
when Caldwell walked Olson. Sewell,
shortstop, booted an easy grounder
from Griffith's bat and all hands* were
safe. Zach Wheat singled scoring Ol
son, and Hap Myers singled sending
Griffith over with the second run.
Manager Tris Speaker scored the
only Cleveland tally of the game in
the fourth inning, and subsequently
broke Cleveland's run of seventeen
scoreless innings, when he doubled
and romped over the plate as the ball
rolled to the fence.
The feature of the game was the
pitching of Smith. Manager Speaker
evidently figured that Smith would
crack before nine innings had been
completed for he sent Mails in to hold
the Dodgers there by using one of his
best bets. But he reckoned without
Smith, for lie seemed to get better
as the game progressed.
The score:— R. H. E.
Cleveland 1 3 1
Brooklyn 2 6 1
