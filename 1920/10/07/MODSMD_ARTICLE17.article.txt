# SOPHS VANQUISH 1924 IN TIE-UP
## Freshmen Fight Gamely, But Are Not Able to Cope With Organization of 1923 Class 
### 
The annual tie-up was tlias year a
surprise to all concerned with per
haps the exception of the freshmen
for whose benefit and instruction it
i was held. An enormous crowd filled
the south side of the bleachers expect
! ing to see the sophomores go up
against something tough in the way
j of superior numbers.
At 4 o'clock nothing materialized and
j the sophs fretted behind the bleach
j ers and ground their teeth in anxiety
i to be at the "Green Peas" and "teach
j them their liumble place in the daily
! Stanford life."
Finally after a halfhour of delay the
i freshmen came onto the field chanting
1 their "To hell with '23." At the same
| time the sophs streamed into sight,
locked arms and ten abreast. When
! the two classes lined up side by side
| to have their picture taken, the fresh
men were dwarfed into insignificance
| by their inferior numbers.
At the starter's gun the two classes
surged toward each other and went at
the fight, first in groups and then as
both sides began to break the morgues
began to fill rapidly with red-smeared
struggling combatants. The perfect
organization and greater number of
the sophomores worked to their ad
vantage and they speedily gained on
the frosli. That the freshmen fought
gamely was evidenced by the grow
ing number of '23-men in the Babe
pen. The sophombres so far outnum
bered the first-year men, however, that
a slight loss in numbers did them no
real harm.
The thrill of the afternoon came,
however, when an over-zealous fresh
man made a breaic for liberty from
the confines of the soph pen. His at
tempt was not a success and he was
dragged ingloriously from the field
to the confines of the locker house
from which he presently emerged
filled with the idea of the soph power
and considerable Searsville. Several
sonhomores were similarly treated.
When the final gun sounded both
teams serpentined the field.
