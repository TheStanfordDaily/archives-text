Three men were suspended by the
Student Affairs Committee of the Uni
versity of California this week for dis
honesty in examinations. The students
were charged with substituting in
Course A, for friends who had previous
ly failed to pass the examination.
Subject A at IT. C. corresponds to
English A at Stanford and the examin
ation mentioned is the same as the ma
triculation test undergone by all first
year students on the "farm."
