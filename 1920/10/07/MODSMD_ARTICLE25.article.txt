# THE
						FUTURE OF THE FRATERNITIES

### 
piRATERNITY men have been too busy during the last few years in handling
1 the housing problem and trying to keep their chapters from being taken
away from them to spend much time in discussing the future of the college
fraternities. But it is interesting and at the same time inspiring to note
that prominent fraternity men and well-known educators have dared to look
into the future and they have found that the fraternity will play, a very
prominent part in the future growth of American universities. This con
clusion is based on the belief that the fraternity chapter house will assume
the part played by the "colleges" that make up the English universities of
Oxford and Cambridge.
The late William It. Baird, in his Manual of American College Fraterni
ties, Bth Edition, makes this prophesy: "The chapters, forming little inde
pendent communities, may, in time, grow into something like the English
colleges. Already in the establishment of chapter libraries, prizes and
scholarships, we may see an indication of the time when chapters shall have
their own instructors and professors, maintained by permanent endowment,
and relieving the college of much of the preliminary and subsidiary work of
instruction and taking from its hands the entire control of the discipline of
the students." Dean Herbert E. Hawkes, of Columbia, has written of the
fraternities as "supplemental educational institutions" and various other
educational authorities have expressed the same idea.
Such a development is linked up closely with the future course that the
universities will follow. There is a movement at present to combine the
traditional four year's course into two years, and to make the last two years
graduate and advanced work. Similar to the plan that has just been insti
tuted here at Stanford. The chapters could assist by employing graduate
tutors to either aid in the graduate work or take over the elementary work.
This would have to be done through the aid of the alumni of the chapter.
It has been suggested that an immediate educational aid would be for
the national organizations to organize speakers' bureaus, and send their
prominent men to speak to the chapters on all possible subjects.
These prophesies indicate that the chapters and the chapter houses are
capable of being used for something more than social purposes and can be
made of real value to the university. They should eilcourage the fraterni
ties to keep in mind the fact that there is a goal worth striving for, and
it is one that will be of inestimable value to all concerned.
