### United Press 
JERUSALEM, Palestine, Oct. 7. â€”
After delays and postponement cover
ing a period of nearly two years, the
Constituent Assembly of Palestine, to
which delegates have been elected by
the entire adult Jewish population of
the country, convened here today, for
the purpose of adopting such legisla
tion as may be deemed essential for
the political organization of Palestine's
Jewry.
The Assembly, which has now the
sanction of Sir Herbert L. Samuel,
British High Commissioner to Pale
stine, will also be called upon to estab
lish the status and functions of the
courts of arbitration.
The last prior date which had been
fixed for the meeting of this body was
May (1, but on that day Jerusalem
was recovering from a bloody clash
between the Arabs and the Jews. The
military authorities thereupon forbade
the convening of the assembly, ow
ing to fear it would serve to create
more friction and possibly lead to new
riots.
The plan for the Constituent As
sembly was worked out at several pre
liminary conferences of representa
tives of all political parties in Jewish
Palestine during the winter of 1918,
and it was hoped that its first meet
ing could be held during the follow
ing Spring. But the ultra-religious
elements in Palestine's Jewry held
that the extension of suffrage to the
women on a basis of equality with
male voters was in violation of tradi
tion. The agitation against universal
suffrage was so strong that the Zionist
Commission, under whose auspices the
preliminary conferences had been hold
fglt compelled to postpone the elec
tions. They made it clear, however,
that it would not yield to the demand
that women be excluded from either
voting for or being candidates as dele
gates to the Assembly.
The elections were finally hekMast
April, and the women not only voted in
large numbers but several were elect
ed as delegates, two from Petach Tik
vah. the oldest Jewish agricultural
settlement in Palestine. The result
of the lection, on the whole, will give
to the labor elements of the land a
majority of the delegates.
