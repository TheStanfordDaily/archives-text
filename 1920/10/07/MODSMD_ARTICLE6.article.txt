# ONE PEACE OASIS IN NEAR EAST
## 
### United Press 
LONDON. (By Mail.)— Despite all
reports to the contrary, there is one
spot in Europe where peace and pros
perity reigns. And, incongrous as it
may seem, this one spot is ill Russia.
Down in the newly created Repub
lic of Georgia, the scars of war are
invisible. In this little principality,
bounded by the Black and Caspian
Seas on the west and east respective
ly, Armenia on the south and the
Caucasus on the noth, a quiet and com
plete normal life exists, according to
the Georgian Foreign Minister, who
has arrived in London to confer with
Premier Lloyd George and Earl Cur
zon, head of the Foreign office.
The Georgian diplomat attributed
the enviable state of affairs in his
country to the temperament of the
Georgians, their geographical location
and the political self-control of the
government.
"We have been absolutely free from
the horrors of civil war which has
torn asunder the former Russian Em
pire," said M. Gugushvili. "In Geor
gia—the oasis of peace in the Near
East —the revolution did not disturb
the state as it did in most of Russia.
On the contrary it created a state on
a purely democratic basis. This is the
best proof of the political maturity
of the Georgian people.
"Now firmly established, with their
own government, it is the wish of the
Georgians to imbue the culture of the
old countries of Europe. We want
foreign capital, knowledge and experi
ence to come to our country in a
friendly way in order to utilize its
wealth to our mutual advantage."
The greatest stumbling block in the
way of economic intercourse with
other nations, according to the foreign
minister, is the hesitancy of European
nations in recognizing the complete
independence of the newly created
republic.
Several of the entente nations have
recognized the de facto government,
but are withholding de jure recogni
tion because of the stand taken by the
United States in regard to Russia.
America's "watchful waiting" policy,
together with her refusal to approve
the unbreaking of the old empire and
the establishment of independent
states out of the various provinces, it
is pointed out, prevents American as
well as foreign capital from seeking
investment and developing the im
mense natural resources.
