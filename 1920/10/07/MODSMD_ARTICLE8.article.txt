# STANFORD OFFERS STUDENT AID FOR U.C. AMENDMENT
## McElroy Writes That Students Will be Glad to Hear From Berkeley Men on Measure 
### 
Stanford will be glad to aid in anv
way possible the University of Califor
nia in their campaign for Amendment 12,
said President McElroy of the A. S.
S. U., to President j. W. Cline, of the
Associated Students of the University
of California this morning
The students at Berkeley are much
concerned with the new measure which
will provide a special tax for support
of the state university, instead of re
quiring special appropriations of the
legislature as is now necessary. Cali
fornia students have organized commit
tees in every county of the state and are
endeavoring in every way to inform the
people of the advantages of the amend
ment.
President McElroy's letter follows:
Stanford University,
October 9, 1920.
Mr. J. W. Cline,
President, A. S. U. C..
Berkeley, California.
My Dear Mr. Cline:
Our student body has followed with
interest your campaign for Amendment
12, and 1 feel that all Stanford Students
who are fully informed on the proposed
measure are interested in seeing it
passed.
Students of California and Stanford
have many common interests, and the
expansion of opportunity for higher edu
cation is certainly one of them.
In that an opportunity to be of some
slight service to you in your campaign
presents itself, we should be very glad
to have you arrange to explain the mat
ter of Amendment 12 to our students.
We would be pleased to have the
proposition taken up at a student as
sembly, or if it would be more advant
ageous, you might establish a headuqart
ers on our campus for the information
of this community, and to encourage our
students to promulgate the proper in
formation in their respective commun
ities.
Trusting that we may be af assistance
to you,
Very truly yours.
FLOYD L. McELROY.
President, A. S. S. U.
