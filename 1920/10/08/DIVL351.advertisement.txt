ANNOUNCEMENT! j
By careful analysis it has been determined that the average cost j
of opening and carrying a checking account in Palo Alto is approxi- j
mately $8.75 per annum. j
Any checking account which maintains a balance less than $100.00 j
is carried at a loss by the bank. i
Palo Alto and Mayfleld are essentially residential and university j
communities, consequently, the business of the local banks is largely <
made up of innumerable small personal checking accounts.
The cost of stationery, supplies, salaries, and in fact every item of j
expense connected with the operation of a bank has increased enor- j
mously within the last few years. j
In view of the above, the banks in J'alo Alto and Mayfleld have j
reached the unanimous conclusion that they cannot longer afford to ,
carry these unprofitable accounts without any charge. j
Beginning October 1, 1920, the' undersigned banks will make a ]
monthly charge of 50 cents against commercial accounts the balance
of which at any time during the month shall fall below $50.00. ]
