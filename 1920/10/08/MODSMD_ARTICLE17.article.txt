# "LEAGUE OR NOT" LEADING ISSUE SAYS LOCAL CLUB
## Stanford Democratic Club to Function as Cox-Roosevelt Club Until Campaign's End 
### 
An appeal to campus voters on non
partisan grounds with the League of
Nations as the paramount issue was
the keynote of speakers last night at
the Cox-Roosevelt meeting held in
the Law Building under the auspices
of the Stanford Democratic Club.
By "scrapping" the League of Na
tions in his Des Moines speech, Sen
ator Harding has made this the lead
ing" issue of the campaign, said F. E.
Supple, '17, president of the local
Democratic organization. He added:
"The controlling decisive factor in
the intelligent voter's mind now
should be, 'Am T for the League or
not?' An affirmative answer means
effective support by a vote for Gover
nor James M. Cox.
"This campus went seven to one
for the League of Nations last Janu
ary and our appeal to the voters here
should be made on the League.
"How can such men as William
Howard Taft, Herbert Hoover, and
Elihu Root, who were avowed support
ers of the League of Nations, support
Senator Harding in the light of his
speech at Des Moines, repudiating the
League?"
Upon motion of C. M. Brown, Jr.,
'20, it was decided that the Stanford
Democratic Club will function under
the name of the Cox-Roosevelt Club
for the balance of the campaign.
It was planned last night to carry
on an active campaign on the campus
and the surrounding towns. Speakers
are to be recruited to make a tour
of Santa Clara Valley to talk to the
voters on the political issues.
Brown was appointed to make ar
rangements with Democratic head
quarters in San Francisco for carry
ing on the campaign.
J. T. McMenamin, '21, spoke brifly
on the work of the Wilson administra
tion.
Efforts are to be made by the Cox-
Roosevelt Club to enroll the women
voters on the campus in the organi
zation.
Support for Senator James D. Phel
nn and Congressman Hugh Hersman
in their campaign for re-election were
voiced by the club. The following re
solution was passed in support of
Senator Phelan:
"RESOLVED: That the Cox-Roose
velt. Club of Stanford University pled
ged its unqualified support to Hon.
Jomes D. Phelan in recognition of his
consistent stand on national questions
and his unselfish interest in the wel
fare of California."
Another meeting of the club will be
held next Thursday night.
