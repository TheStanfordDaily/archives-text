## COACH POWELL TO START GRIDIRON BATTLE WITH STRONG TEAM: ROOTERS WILL VOTE FOR ASSISTANT YELL LEADER 
### 
Coach "Brick" Mitchell's Olympic
Club aggregation will clash with the
Cardinal football eleven tomorrow after
noon on the Stanford turf at 3 o'clock.
Mitchell, who acted as the assistant
coach at Stanford last year, will bring
the strongest possible team of Winged
"O" gridiron warriors to campus. The
varsity game will be preceeded by a
"frosh" game, against the U. S. S. Bos
ton eleven, which is scheduled to start
at 1:30 o'clock.
All students are expected to show up
for the freshman game so that yell
leader Kinney will lie able to conduct
rooting practice. During the course of
of the afternoon tlie twelve junior try
outees will be given the opportunity to
try out for the two positions of assist
ant yell leaders for the year 1920-21. An
election will also be held during the
afternoon. Next Saturday the varsitv
team will leave for Las Angeles to meet
the University of Southern California
squad, while the Cardinal players will
journey to Santa Clara on October 23.
This schedule makes tomorrow's game
the only scrimmage on the home turf be
fore the game against the University of
Oregon team, October 30. For this
reason Kinney is particularly anxious to
have rooting practice tomorrow during
both games.
Sporting dopsters will have an oppor
tunity to get a more definite line on the
relative strength of the Stanford and
California American warriors following
tomorrow's scrimmages. California will
play the St. Mary's team on the Cali
fornia keld. Stanford defeated the St.
Mary team by a score of 41-0, while the
Blue and Gold players walked through
the winged "O" line the previous week
for three touch downs. Results of these
two contest tomorrow will furnish foot
ball enthusiasts with a better idea of the
two rival elevens.
"Brick" Mitchell has announced his
starting lineup as follows: McCoy, r. e.,
Tendler, r. t.; Thorndike, r. g.; Callison,
c.; Hauser, 1. g.; Pike, 1. I.; Mohr,
1. e.; Cahrlton, r. e.; MacCollum, 1. h.;
Patterson, q. b.; Dodson, r. h.
Coach Powell has not definitely de
cided who will play in several of the

starting eleven until after practice this
afternoon. The players to commence
play will probably be: Pelouze, 1. e.;
Hc'lser, 1. t.; Stice, 1. g.; Rice c.; Deatns,
r. g.; Pershing, r. t.; K. Schaudeman,
r. e.; Wilcox, q.; Campbell, 1. h.; R.
Schlaudman, r. h.; Woollomes, f.
Arnett and Sproull are certain of be
ing used in the backfield during the
game. Arnett is an experienced army
player and is exceptionally strong on
open field work. Helser, DeGroot, Mc-
Alpine and Adams will be worked in
the line sometime during the game. If
the Varsity is able to run up several
touch downs on the Olympic Club team,
the coach is planning on using a large
portion of hi? squad.

Stanford football men will be the guests
of Skull and Snakes at a barbecue. The
