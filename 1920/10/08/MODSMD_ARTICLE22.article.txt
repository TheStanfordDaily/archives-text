# CARDINAL BABES TO PLAY SAILORS
## Coach Seay Prunes Freshman Squad to Thirty-seven Men First Game Called at 1:30 
### 
Stanford's Babes will play the foot
ball team of the U. S. S. Boston tomor
row afternoon on the local field. The
Freshmen are determined to wipe out
the 17 to 6 defeat administered to them
by the Mare Island Marines last Sat
urday.
Coach Duffy Seay has been putting
his squad over the jumps this week and
a number of scrimmages with the Vars
ity were held. Considerable improve
ments in team play was noticeable in the
scrimmages of Thursday and Friday
afternoons.
The U. S. S. Boston team can hardly
be classed as a world beating aggrega
tion. The Varsity beat a team repre
senting the U. S. S. Boston last year
by a score of 70 to 0, andtheCalifornia
Freshmen walloped the tarsi last Sat
urday at California field by a score of
28 to 0. However, surprises are sprung
as often in football as in baseball and
other sports, and who knows but what
they may turn the tables on the Frosh
eleven. At any rate the tars have never
been accused o'f not battling so the game
should be interesting to watch.
Coach Seay announces the following
lineup: 1. e. Slater; 1. t. Carter; 1. g.
Fullcrton; c. Dunbar; r. g. Arthur; r.
t. Hartranft; r. e. Fuller; q. b. Wood
ward; 1. h. Judy; r. h. Campbell; f.
