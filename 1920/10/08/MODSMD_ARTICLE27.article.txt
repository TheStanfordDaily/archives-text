# A 						CONTEMPTIBLE ACTION
## 
### 
WHETHER it was intentional or merely thoughtless, the story ap
pearing in this morning's San Francisco Chronicle, purporting to
be a statement by Dean Harriet Bradford on smoking in Roble Hall, is j
a direct injury to the University and as such deserves the severest j
criticism <Vf the student body. It makes the statement that Dean Har-!
riet Bradford will stoop to the practice of smelling at the key-holes in j
Roble to detect smoking in the rooms and that Miss Bradford is of the
opinion that smoking is prevalent among the women of the Hall.
This story was not sent by any of the Stanford correspondents and
must have been written by a Stanford student, as the story carries a
Stanford University date line. Such an action is the most contemptible j
thing that could be done to injure the name of the University and the
women who attend it. It is not only a misquotation of Miss Bradford's
talk to the members of Roble but it is a bald-faced lie. It gives the
sensational newspapers of the State a chance to play up a university j
scandal, and the memory of the "free-love" episode at the University ,
of California is still fresh in our minds.
It is the duty of the Men's Council and the Women's Conference
to investigate this matter and to do all in their power to detect the !
guilty person.
