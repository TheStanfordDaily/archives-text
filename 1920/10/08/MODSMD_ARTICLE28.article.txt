# AID CALIFORNIA
## 
### 
CTUDENT BODY PRESIDENT McELROY'S letter to the president
of the Associated Students of the University of California, offering j
Stanford's aid in the campaign for Amendment No. 12, is a commend- j
able action and the offer should receive the full attention of Stanford
students. The University of California is bearing the majority of the j
burden of the higher education of the State, and Stanford people should
show their appreciation by doing all in their power to aid the campaign.
The measure provides for a special tax to support the State University.
It might be within the province of the Stanford Republican and
Democratic clubs to take some of their time to spread information on
the measure, and have speakers from the University of California ad- j
dress their political meetings.
