# DECORATIONS ABSENT FROM COLLEGE ROOMS
## 
### 
''What lias become of the college stu
dent who used to lie the proud inmate
of the room with the bright colored
pennants, pictures from the pinkest of
pink sporting periodicals, photogravures
from the latest Broadway theatrical
journals and clippings of the shapely
beauties in full chorus vesture? That
is a puzzling question today—why has
the style changed, and why has the
apparent cheeriness been doffed?
"There is one explanation that will
clear the situation in a conceptive man
ner. Students often desire to get away
from the habits, precedents and customs
of their forefathers. Likewise, the dec
orations of the rooms, his quarters in
general and the very environment in
which he exists, are changed. It is one
of the sycrets of this generation ro
change often, therefore, the same dirty
pennants, pictures and trinkets pasted
to the wall become disgusting after a
few short weeks. One person might like
to see the various colors of the many
educational institutions hung lazily
around the plate rail, while others of
the later school of design and coloi
arrangement might desire to have the
walls neatly draped with an occasional
picture of a winter snow scene or a
grazing cow.
"Reports from various health com
mittees throughout the United States
report that disease and vermin often
quarter in the loose decorations of the
bedroom —the place where the ostenta
tious trinkets and keepsakes usually take
asylum until finally destroyed. Dust and
other aerial bacteria usually breed and
lie dormant in places seldom disturbed
by the ambitious housekeeper, who
spends more than half the time in the
bedroom. Everyon'e should guard
against loose decorations in sleeping
quarters, as it is indeed difficult to keep
pennants immaculately clean and ffee
from germs.
"Since the termination of the war,
building cost has gone up, people have
refused to build on account of the pre
vailing high money rates and quarters
for students have become scarcer and
scarcer every year. Because of the
shortage of available room, every inch
of space has been taken in the usual
student "hangout." Rooms are at times
so small that the paper on the west wall
is held tightly 011 the east wall. '1 he
thickness of the wall paper is a waste
of room, in these trying days of space
conservation. Why waste the paper and
the time of the paperhanger when the
student is crowded the way lie is tliia
year,
"One of the main reasons why stu
dents fail to decorate their rooms with,
the usual colorful rags and triangular
felts is the fact that there is not enougn
room in their sleeping quarters to hang
them and yet have enough room to ex
pand comfortably."—University Daily
Kansan.
