# BIG TEN ALL PRIMED FOR GRIDIRON SEASON
## 
### 
CHICAGO, Oct. B.窶認ootball fans in
the middle west are to be treated to their
"thrilling-est" gridiron season according
to reports from Big Ten football camps.
With the largest squad of rookies on
record competing for places on parsitv !
elevens, and every school retaining a I
large number of its veterans, one of the j
warmest fights for football supremacy
in the Big Ten is expected to be waged
this fall.
Illinois, winner of last year's title, I
started off the season as the favorite. !
She was favored principally because of 1
the ability to win last year and a larg.- j
number of likely candidates lighting to ;
get on the team.
At least eight of the men who will
land on Coach Stagg's Maroon are sea
soned veterans. Tackles Jackson and
McGuire. Center Reber Guard Barker,
and Ends Hinlcle and Crisler are being
strongly pushed for places in the lineup
and this is expected to give Chicago an
eleven which will be a championship con
tender.
One hundred candidates are lighting
to get 011 the Purdue team. At least
twelve of these are men who played
either on last year's regular or fresh
man elevens. The Purdue pigskin war
riors are favored by many keen football j
analysts to be at or near the top on
Thanksgiving Day.
Minnesota, according to reports from
the Twin Cities, looks a top-notch team,
Captain Johnson, Arnold Oss, Gtis Eck
burg, Ed. Rubens and Neal Arnstou are
being pushed by a score of rookies for
their places with the result that all the
veterans are in excellent lighting trim.
Northwestern will try to take the spot
light this year. Coach Elmer McDefitt
has twenty veterans and lifty recruits to
select a winning combination from.
Hard workouts, with lots of punting
have weeded out many candidates. Me
Devitt believes the material left will
give him an unbeatable team.
Warned against over-confidence by
Coach Yost, Michigan will try to make
up this year for her slipup in 1919. The
Wolverines have a good bunch of husk
ies to pick an eleven from and Yost ex
pects to have his regular lineup in the
field after the first few "practice games."
Coach Jack Wilce of Oh to State isn't
a bit gloomy over the future. Wilce be
lieves Ohio has the winning team. With
the exception of two or three, Ohio will
have practically the same team this year
as last. Wilce figures these experienced
vets combined with a little "fresh blood"
will upset the calculations of the ex
perts.
Wisconsin so far. lias made little claim
about the future. Under the tutelage
of Coach Richards, the Badger squad
went through daily workouts and now
has what those on the inside claim to
lie a very strong aggregation. Wisconsin
has several veterans to balance the team.
A wealth of material on hand has
given Indiana its best team in a decade
according to Hoosier enthusiasts. At
least fourteen letter men are lighting for
regular places 011 this year's lineup.
lowa, is said, to have the greatest
team in its history. '1 he Hawkeye school
is touted as next to Illinois as a possible
title winner.

CHICAGO, Oct. B.窶認ootball fans in
the middle west are to be treated to their
"thrilling-est" gridiron season according
to reports from Big Ten football camps.
With the largest squad of rookies on
record competing for places on parsitv !
elevens, and every school retaining a I
large number of its veterans, one of the j
warmest fights for football supremacy
in the Big Ten is expected to be waged
this fall.
Illinois, winner of last year's title, I
started off the season as the favorite. !
She was favored principally because of 1
the ability to win last year and a larg.- j
number of likely candidates lighting to ;
get on the team.
At least eight of the men who will
land on Coach Stagg's Maroon are sea
soned veterans. Tackles Jackson and
McGuire. Center Reber Guard Barker,
and Ends Hinlcle and Crisler are being
strongly pushed for places in the lineup
and this is expected to give Chicago an
eleven which will be a championship con
tender.
One hundred candidates are lighting
to get 011 the Purdue team. At least
twelve of these are men who played
either on last year's regular or fresh
man elevens. The Purdue pigskin war
riors are favored by many keen football j
analysts to be at or near the top on
Thanksgiving Day.
Minnesota, according to reports from
the Twin Cities, looks a top-notch team,
Captain Johnson, Arnold Oss, Gtis Eck
burg, Ed. Rubens and Neal Arnstou are
being pushed by a score of rookies for
their places with the result that all the
veterans are in excellent lighting trim.
Northwestern will try to take the spot
light this year. Coach Elmer McDefitt
has twenty veterans and lifty recruits to
select a winning combination from.
Hard workouts, with lots of punting
have weeded out many candidates. Me
Devitt believes the material left will
give him an unbeatable team.
Warned against over-confidence by
Coach Yost, Michigan will try to make
up this year for her slipup in 1919. The
Wolverines have a good bunch of husk
ies to pick an eleven from and Yost ex
pects to have his regular lineup in the
field after the first few "practice games."
Coach Jack Wilce of Oh to State isn't
a bit gloomy over the future. Wilce be
lieves Ohio has the winning team. With
the exception of two or three, Ohio will
have practically the same team this year
as last. Wilce figures these experienced
vets combined with a little "fresh blood"
will upset the calculations of the ex
perts.
Wisconsin so far. lias made little claim
about the future. Under the tutelage
of Coach Richards, the Badger squad
went through daily workouts and now
has what those on the inside claim to
lie a very strong aggregation. Wisconsin
has several veterans to balance the team.
A wealth of material on hand has
given Indiana its best team in a decade
according to Hoosier enthusiasts. At
least fourteen letter men are lighting for
regular places 011 this year's lineup.
