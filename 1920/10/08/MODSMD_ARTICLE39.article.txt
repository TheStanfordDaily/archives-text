# WILBUR OUTLINES REBUILDING PLANS FOR CURRENT YEAR
## 
### Florence V. Hocking, '22 
"Economy and results are to be the
key-notes of our work in beautifying
the University grounds and in our
plans for enlargment this year," said
President Wilbur yesterday, in dis
cussing university affairs.
Mr. Nyquist, who is now in charge
of the university gardening, is a man
eminetly fitted for his position, as the
profusion of flowers and shrubs on the
campus bear witness Mr. McLaren,
the exposition landscape artist is di
recting the planting of the perma
nent trees and shrubs and the final
outward appearance of the university
will be largely due to his foresight.
Oaks have been planted down the
street between the library and the
outer quadrangle, and along the road
leading to Roble Hall, so that some
future date will see Stanford Universi
ty surrounded by the most beautiful
and most enduring trees in the world.
Some pictures published in the year
book of the class of '96, President
Wilbur's graduating class, show the
bare fields where the buildings of the
quadrangles now stand, and in the
background are rows of magnificent
oaks, proving that this tree is the
natural one to be planted at Stanford.
In front of the library salvias, ze
nias and asters have been planted,
and the red, yellow and lavender flow
ers form a lively background for the
Spanish style of buildings which pre
dominate. Green shrubs which will
be permanent have been planted
among the flowers there and along the
front of the Quad among the caster
beans, so that there will be shrubbery
at all times to beautify the grounds.
The other flowers will be rotated as
their season come, and different plants
will be used in the winter, fall, spring,
and summer.
Students have no doubt noticed that
the old freight building has been
moved over into the Corporation
Yards. The garages are to be in these
grounds also. They will be suitably
placed in position there, and vines
will be planted to climb over them so
that in a few years this spot will be
as beautiful as any on the campus.
The field left vacant by the moving
of these buildings will be immediately
utilized by the women for temporary
hockey fields, and will in time be
paved and made into permanent
hockey, basketball, and tennis courts.
When asked about the construction
of new buildings President Wilbur
stated that the Men's Union Dining
Hall between the present Union and
the Women's Club House would be the
first building to he erected. The
plans have been carefully made and
are now under the consideration of
the Trustees. Actual work will be
started soon and the Union will be
ready for use early in 1921. It is a
comparatively simple building to con

j struct and will be capable of accom
modating 300 men when completed.
Its style will resemble the other build
, ings of the Quad.
Money was voted last year by the
student body to build a basketball
pavilion near Encina Hall. This will
soon be erected and it is planned to
put the very best kind of floor down
| in order that it may be used for a
dancing floor as well. The building
will be well heated, and will be an
I ideal place for large dances.
Speaking of the dormitory question
which was so agitated last year,
President Wilbur explained several
of the difficulties facing the university
in this respect.
The task of operation of private
j houses is a heavy burden in Presi
dent Wilbur's estimation. Adequate
heat, efficient house-keeping and good
| food are essentials. It is almost im
-1 possible for fraternity houses to keep
up a furnace all the time in the
! winter, due to the high cost of coal
| and janitor service. Students are
! more or less busy and more or less
careless in keeping their rooms
scrupulously clean and there should
i be some supervision to provide for
i this.
The fraternities have presented a
plan for President Wilbur's consider
| ation anu ether bodies have also of
fered suggestions. Dr. Wilbur is ve-y
anxious that anyone v,'ho has any sug
gestion as to a solution of the dormi
tory 'question should make it known to
him. Plans will soon be drawn up and
will he placed before the students and
faculty for discussion. "We must in
I this second rebuilding" declared Dr.
Wilbur, "build no more wooden build-
I ings but we must construct stone
J buildings that will endure at least a
j hundred years. That is why the pres
ent wooden fraternity houses are un
satisfactory. I shall be more than
glad to discuss these questions with
any of the s.tudents who have con
structive ideas or v/ho desire inform
ation."

"Economy and results are to be the
key-notes of our work in beautifying
the University grounds and in our
plans for enlargment this year," said
President Wilbur yesterday, in dis
cussing university affairs.
Mr. Nyquist, who is now in charge
of the university gardening, is a man
eminetly fitted for his position, as the
profusion of flowers and shrubs on the
campus bear witness Mr. McLaren,
the exposition landscape artist is di
recting the planting of the perma
nent trees and shrubs and the final
outward appearance of the university
will be largely due to his foresight.
Oaks have been planted down the
street between the library and the
outer quadrangle, and along the road
leading to Roble Hall, so that some
future date will see Stanford Universi
ty surrounded by the most beautiful
and most enduring trees in the world.
Some pictures published in the year
book of the class of '96, President
Wilbur's graduating class, show the
bare fields where the buildings of the
quadrangles now stand, and in the
background are rows of magnificent
oaks, proving that this tree is the
natural one to be planted at Stanford.
In front of the library salvias, ze
nias and asters have been planted,
and the red, yellow and lavender flow
ers form a lively background for the
Spanish style of buildings which pre
dominate. Green shrubs which will
be permanent have been planted
among the flowers there and along the
front of the Quad among the caster
beans, so that there will be shrubbery
at all times to beautify the grounds.
The other flowers will be rotated as
their season come, and different plants
will be used in the winter, fall, spring,
and summer.
Students have no doubt noticed that
the old freight building has been
moved over into the Corporation
Yards. The garages are to be in these
grounds also. They will be suitably
placed in position there, and vines
will be planted to climb over them so
that in a few years this spot will be
as beautiful as any on the campus.
The field left vacant by the moving
of these buildings will be immediately
utilized by the women for temporary
hockey fields, and will in time be
paved and made into permanent
hockey, basketball, and tennis courts.
When asked about the construction
of new buildings President Wilbur
stated that the Men's Union Dining
Hall between the present Union and
the Women's Club House would be the
first building to he erected. The
plans have been carefully made and
are now under the consideration of
the Trustees. Actual work will be
started soon and the Union will be
ready for use early in 1921. It is a
comparatively simple building to con

j struct and will be capable of accom
modating 300 men when completed.
Its style will resemble the other build
, ings of the Quad.
Money was voted last year by the
student body to build a basketball
pavilion near Encina Hall. This will
soon be erected and it is planned to
put the very best kind of floor down
| in order that it may be used for a
dancing floor as well. The building
will be well heated, and will be an
I ideal place for large dances.
Speaking of the dormitory question
which was so agitated last year,
President Wilbur explained several
of the difficulties facing the university
in this respect.
The task of operation of private
j houses is a heavy burden in Presi
dent Wilbur's estimation. Adequate
heat, efficient house-keeping and good
| food are essentials. It is almost im
-1 possible for fraternity houses to keep
up a furnace all the time in the
! winter, due to the high cost of coal
| and janitor service. Students are
! more or less busy and more or less
careless in keeping their rooms
scrupulously clean and there should
i be some supervision to provide for
i this.
The fraternities have presented a
plan for President Wilbur's consider
| ation anu ether bodies have also of
fered suggestions. Dr. Wilbur is ve-y
anxious that anyone v,'ho has any sug
gestion as to a solution of the dormi
tory 'question should make it known to
him. Plans will soon be drawn up and
will he placed before the students and
faculty for discussion. "We must in
I this second rebuilding" declared Dr.
Wilbur, "build no more wooden build-
I ings but we must construct stone
J buildings that will endure at least a
j hundred years. That is why the pres
ent wooden fraternity houses are un
satisfactory. I shall be more than
glad to discuss these questions with
any of the s.tudents who have con
