# TENNIS TEAM TO MAKE TRIP EAST
## 
### 
Arrangements are being made
whereby a team of two men will be
sent east this year to represent Stan
ford in the Natonal Intercollegiate
Tennis Meet, to be held at the Marion
Cricket Clnb in Philadelphia. The
team will play at different places in
the country as it fulfills its guarantees
and will take about three weeks on
the trip.
The trip this year is being contem
plated seriously on account of the
fact that tennis is now a major sport
in the University. Last year the Uni
versity of California sent a four-man
team east to enter the National Inter
collegiate Championship meet and
(hey showed up so well that compara
tive dope seems to show that the
struggle for honors will be between
Stanford and California. When the
team goes in the spring it will be the
first time since 1916 that Stanford has
sent a team to the east. That year
Lindley Murray and Herbert Hahn
went east to represent Stanford in the
National Intercollegiate meet.
