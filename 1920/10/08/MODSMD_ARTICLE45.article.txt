CAMBRIDGE, MASS., Oct. B.—Har-
I yard's hopes for supremacy on the grid
j iron this autumn are running high. The
| prospects for developing a we'l-balanced
Crimson squad from the wealth of ma
terial available was never brighter, ac
cording to the coaches.
J Although Head Coach Bob Fisher has
not made his final choice, his selection*
so far indicate that the average weight
of the line men will be about 190 pounds,
while that of the whole team should j
average 185 pounds.
I 1 lie candidates in their daily workouts
j have shown excellent kicking and run- ■
ning qualities. J lie entire group of!
j backlleld candidates kick well.
In assembling a tentative line, Fisher
chose three regulars, two substitutes
from last year's squad, and two new
men. This line consisted of Clark, a
new comer from Colorado, who weighs
181 pounds; Lockwood, 184 pounds;
Kane, 185 pounds; Tolbert, an Okla
homa man, 206 pounds; Brown, 200
pounds; Woods, 222 pounds, and Have
meyer, 175 pounds. Clark and Kane
were used on the end positions, Lock
wood and Tolbert as tackles, Brown and
Woods as guards and Havemeyer at |
center. This combination showed good '
teamwork.
Captain Arnold Horween, Dick Hum
phrey and Mitchell Gratwick, all stars of
last year's team, are certain to have
places in the backlicld. Dick Humph- I
rey and Art Hamilton are also working
for places on the 1920 squad.
Ibe coaches, among whom is Sam
Felton, famous Crimson punter, are lay
ing much stress on long high kicks,
running practice and interference.
Percy Haughton, who was head coacii !
for the Crimson team for nine years. |
recently watched the men workout and
expressed himself as much pleased with
the outlook.
