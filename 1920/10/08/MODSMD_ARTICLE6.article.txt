# LOVE TOO SLOW FOR WOMEN GAMBLERS NOW

### United Press 
LONDON, Oct. B.—English women
have quit gambling on lovo. to put
their hopes on the gee-gees. Astound
ing numbers of women have placed
largo bets with commission agnits
during the 1920 racing season and
these bets come from extraorJina-v
sources. A well-known book make
told the United Press that most of
the large bets placed with him by
women have been from those resid
ing in quiet country villages.
"I think they are seeking some kind
of excitement to lessen the tedium of
country life" he said. "Many of them
have taken it up only recently. They
don't profess to know anything about
horses —Form, pedigree, jockey i and
all those things which the male
gambler studies so assidiously mean
less than nothing to the women.
"Usually a woman Chooses a horse
because of its name, and a woman
will stake her all on a 'coincidence
tip'."
He pointed out that, with usual
feminine perversity, his women clients
Dover put their money on the favorite.
They don't want to hear which horse
has the best chance of winning a race;
they prefer taking risks with large
odds. One woman client came to him
with a large sum of money to put on
a horse called "Golden Guinea" ex
plaining "That's the name of a favo
rite wine of mine, and besides, it
sounds like a money-maker!"
