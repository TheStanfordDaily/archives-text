Batteries—Brooklyn. Smith and Miller.
Cleveland, Mails and O'Neill.
It was a thrilling game from every
standpoint. Mails, the Indian left-hand
recruit recently obtained from the Pa
cific Coast League, set the Robins
down with three scattered hits and
kept them away from the plate with
out trouble. This was in spite of the
loose fielding by the Indians' inner
defense. When he retired Kilduff for
the final out in the ninth inning he
had pitched sixteen consecutive score
less innings. For five innings the two
southpaws battled neck and neck with
little advantage on either Side.
