# TRYOUTS FOR ANNUAL SWORD AND SANDALS PLAY ON WEDNESDAY
## 
### 
Preliminary try-outs for the Sword
and Sandal's play to be given November
5. will be held at the Assembly hall next
Wednesday afternoon from 2 to 4
o'clock and from 8 to 9 o'clock in the
evening. As yet the play has not been
chosen, but the manuscripts are expected
to arrive this week, according to Coach
Gordon Davis.
Tryouts are open for all students, ex
cept freshmen women. In previous
years the better known talent of the
campus have been invited to try for the
heavier parts. All places on the cast
will be open to all those who wish to
make a try for them. By using this
new system, Davis expects to find some
new talent, which otherwise might not
have been found.
