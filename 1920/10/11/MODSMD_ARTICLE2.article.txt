# STAGE STARS WILL PERFORM IN SKITS FOR CORDA FRATRES
## 
### 
''Vodka, vimmen, and voice" is the
title of one of the feature skits in the
program of "On'n Off Campus Riety"
which the local chapter of the Corda
Fratres will present in the Assembh
Hall next Friday evening, October 5.
This snappy playlet will contain in its
cast several of the leading campus act
ors who will be seen on the board Fri
day evening for the first time this sea
son.
Arnold l?ayley, who played the lead in
the Masquers play last spring, is billed
for a character sketch. The work of
Bavley previous dramatic productions
shows that his acting is far above the
average of college amateurs and it is
expected that his sketch will be one of
the hits of the evening.
Off campus talent will he representee
in part by two former Orpheum players.
Nelson Valjean. '24, who is entering
Stanford this quarter from the Ore
pheum circuit, has consented to give one
of his acts which has won much popular
approval on the circuit. Valjean is
slated for a blackface skit. A chalk
talker with two years Orepheum exper
ience, is listed on the evening's bill.
Lester Seib, '22, will undoubtedly be
one of the chief drawing cards of the
"Riety." Seib for two years has pleased
Stanford audiences by his work which is
almost professional in character. A dis
tinctive character sketch will be played
by Seib.
A cut in the prices originally announc
ed by the Corda Fratres has been made
so that only a nominal crage of fifty or
seventy-five cents a seat will be made
for the Friday evening show. The time
and pla of the ticket drawing will be
announced later in the week.
