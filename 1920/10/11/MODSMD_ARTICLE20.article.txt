# VARSITY TEAM LOSES GRIDIRON SCRIMMAGE TO OLYMPIC ELEVEN
## BRICK' MITCHELL'S AGGREGATION DEFEATS COACH POWELL'S FOOTBALL SQUAD ON MUDDY TURF—10-7 
### 
Old Man Dope received a severe
blow Saturday when the Olympic Club
defeated the Stanford eleven, and the
Blue and gold football squad plugged
through St. Mary's line for eighteen
touchdowns. The former game was
more of an aquatic meet than a foot
ball battle, being played on the Stan
ford turf with the rain pouring down
during the larger portion of the
struggle. Both teams exhibited a
good brand of play, but the superior
weight of the winged "O" team helped
them materially on the slippery field.
Both clubs scored in the first quar
ter, when Campbell made seven points
for the Cardinal, only to be followed
by Tingling with a touch-down for the
visitors. In the second quarter Dob
son dropped the ball over the bar
for the Olympic Club from the fifteen
yard line.« The score remained 10-7
throughout the rest of the entire con
test.
' Because of the wet field both teams
were forced to start a kicking game
early in the struggle. Campbell do
ing the punting for the Cardinal, was
probably the most consistent gainer
for the local team. His kicking was
on a par with that of the Olympic
club's and his line plunging made gain
after gain. Bob Shlaudeman showed
up well in the backfield making yards
through an apparent impossible field.
Pelouze played his usual fast game
but was handicapped because of the
poor condition of the turf.
The Stanford line failed to play the
style of game that they exhibited
against the St. Mary eleven, probably
due to the difficulty of gaining a
strong foot hold in the mud. The
heavier Olympic line is also account
able for the winged "O" line gains.
Twice during the game the Cardinal
players pushed the ball within the
Olympic five-yard line, but were un
able to break through the line for a
touch down.
Coach Powell will start hard prac
tice this afternoon in preparation for
the battle with the U. S. C., next Sat
urday afternoon in Los Angeles. Last
year's defeat has made the varsity
determined for a Red victory.
