# BACK TO NORMAL
## 
### 
CjENATOR HARDING has made the phrase "back to normal" the
keynote in most of his speeches and it is this note that is winning
him the support of the business men, the farmers and the laborers.
These classes are interested primarily in seeing the country regain its
normal condition. Senator Harding has said, that if elected, he will
do all in his power to remedy the inflation due to the war in order to
secure relief from high living costs. He favors a method of refunding
to cut down the enormous annual interest charge of one billion dollars
on the war debt. He believes that some measure should be taken to
bring the Liberty Bonds back to par. He advocates legislation to bolster
up the railroad credit in order to meet the demands of commerce. Other
forms of transportation must be made cheaper and efficient to aid in
the material reduction of living costs. A better understanding must
be promoted between business and labor.
The fact that the Republican Party has pledged itself to accomp
lish these purposes is carrying more weight with the above classes of
people than the League of Nations issue, important as it is. The Repub
lican candidate has maintained a rather "wishy-washy" attitude on the
League for his own reasons, but we are reminded by Herbert Hoover,
in his opening campaign speech for the Harding-Coolidge ticket, that
"the essential thing is that the Republican party has pledged itself by
platform, by the actions of its majority in the Senate; by the repeated
statements of Senator Harding that they underake the fundamental
mission to put into living being the principles of an organized associa
tion of nations for the preservaton of peace. The carryng out of that
promise is the test of the entire sincerity, integrity and statesmanship of
the Republican party."
The Daily Palo Alto is aware of the fact that Stanford, as a uni
versity community, has expressed itself strongly in favor of the League
of Nations, and that many will vote the Democratic ticket on that ac
count. But it must be realized that the nation has to regain its normal
condition quickly. We must agree with Mr. Hoover that the present
administration has failed by all tests that can be applied, and according
to our system of party government, it must be retired. The Republicans
will give their attention to putting the country in a pre-war condition,
and we must take their pledge as expressed by Hoover that the highly
important principle of a world league will be adopted.
