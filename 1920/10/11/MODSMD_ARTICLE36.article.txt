# PRINCETON FOOTBALL PROSPECTS ARE GOOD
## 
### 
PRINCETON, N. J., Oct. 9. (United
Press) —The Princeton football team
has been particularly hard hit by
graduations and ineligibility, but
Coach Bill Roper is confident of build
ing a championship combination out
of the wealth of new material.
As is the case with most big eastern
elevens, Roper's hardest task is to
develop a suitable pair of ends, but in
addition, he must construct a back
field.
Although 12 letter men returned to
school this fall few of them were reg
ulars. Men must be developed to take
the place of such stars as Strubing,
Trimble, RlcGraw and Williams, who
graduated. Holmes, Snively, Euwer
and Lipscomb, all members of last
year's Freshman team, are not avail
able either because of leaving school
or being declared ineligible.
Out of the squad of 65 that reported
for first practice the following appear
to have the best chances of making
the varsity:
Ends —Raymond, Jones, Davis and
Legend re. Tackles — -Keck, Rutan
Hopper, Halsey and Upson. Guards —
Thomas, Dickinson, Morgan and Mc-
Caull. Center—-Gallalian, Opie and
Scureman. Quarter —Lourie, Stimson
and Gorman. Half's —Gilroy, Wittmer
and Murrey. Full —Scheerer, Gilroy
and Lourie.
Raymond was a varsity end last
year. Davis also had had varsity ex
perience. Jones was a freshman end
in 1919 and Legendre formerly starred
with Tulane.
"Stan v Keck was one of last year's
stars, but was out of the game most
of the time with injuries. He weighs
200 pounds and is a terrific line
plunger and an accurate place-kicker.
Rutan was on the freshman team last
year. Hooper, Halsey and Upsom
played on last year's scrubs. Thomas
was substitute center last year. Dick
inson, Morgan and McCaull have had
varsity experience. The latter may
have made a regular but for injuries.
Captain Mike Callahan will be under
studied at center by Opie and Scure
man. The latter was a sub-center
when his leg was broken last year.
Lourie, who played in part of the
Harvard game last fall, is a good open
field runner and is sure on punts.
Stimson and Gorman alternated at
quarter on the freshman eleven.
Murrey, who kicked field goals
against both Harvard and Yale last
year, seems to be certain as half back.
Gilroy was full on the freshman team.
Wittmer has had varsity experience.
Scheerer is one of the best punters
in the game. He also is a good ground
gainer, as evidenced by his perform
ance against Yale last year. Gilroy
and Lourie may also be tried out at
full. Others who are showing well
on the squad are Cleaves, Gordon and
Cutchins.
Princeton opened with Swartlimore
here last Saturday. The next game
will be with Maryland State. Wash
ington and Lee plays here Oct. 16 and
th eNavy on October 23. West Vir
ginia, which defeated Princeton 25 to
0 last year, comes Oct. 30. Colgate,
which administered a 7 to 0 defeat to
the Tiger last year, has been dropped
from the schedule. The only out of
town game is with Harvard at Cam
bridge. The teams tied 10 and 10 last
year. Yale, which Princeton beat 13
to 6 last year, comes here Nov. 13.
The Yale game will produce the uni
que feature of brothers, captains of
their respective elevens, facing each
other at center. They are Mike Calla
han of Princeton and Tim Callahan of
Yale. The latter, who was captain last
year, was reelected.

and Murrey. Full —Scheerer, Gilroy
and Lourie.
Raymond was a varsity end last
year. Davis also had had varsity ex
perience. Jones was a freshman end
in 1919 and Legendre formerly starred
with Tulane.
"Stan v Keck was one of last year's
stars, but was out of the game most
of the time with injuries. He weighs
200 pounds and is a terrific line
plunger and an accurate place-kicker.
Rutan was on the freshman team last
year. Hooper, Halsey and Upsom
played on last year's scrubs. Thomas
was substitute center last year. Dick
inson, Morgan and McCaull have had
varsity experience. The latter may
have made a regular but for injuries.
Captain Mike Callahan will be under
studied at center by Opie and Scure
man. The latter was a sub-center
when his leg was broken last year.
Lourie, who played in part of the
Harvard game last fall, is a good open
field runner and is sure on punts.
Stimson and Gorman alternated at
quarter on the freshman eleven.
Murrey, who kicked field goals
against both Harvard and Yale last
year, seems to be certain as half back.
Gilroy was full on the freshman team.
Wittmer has had varsity experience.
Scheerer is one of the best punters
in the game. He also is a good ground
gainer, as evidenced by his perform
ance against Yale last year. Gilroy
and Lourie may also be tried out at
full. Others who are showing well
on the squad are Cleaves, Gordon and
Cutchins.
Princeton opened with Swartlimore
here last Saturday. The next game
will be with Maryland State. Wash
ington and Lee plays here Oct. 16 and
th eNavy on October 23. West Vir
ginia, which defeated Princeton 25 to
0 last year, comes Oct. 30. Colgate,
which administered a 7 to 0 defeat to
the Tiger last year, has been dropped
from the schedule. The only out of
town game is with Harvard at Cam
bridge. The teams tied 10 and 10 last
year. Yale, which Princeton beat 13
to 6 last year, comes here Nov. 13.
The Yale game will produce the uni
que feature of brothers, captains of
their respective elevens, facing each
other at center. They are Mike Calla
han of Princeton and Tim Callahan of
Yale. The latter, who was captain last
year, was reelected.
PRINCETON, N. J., Oct. 9. (United
Press) —The Princeton football team
has been particularly hard hit by
graduations and ineligibility, but
Coach Bill Roper is confident of build
ing a championship combination out
of the wealth of new material.
As is the case with most big eastern
elevens, Roper's hardest task is to
develop a suitable pair of ends, but in
addition, he must construct a back
field.
Although 12 letter men returned to
school this fall few of them were reg
ulars. Men must be developed to take
the place of such stars as Strubing,
Trimble, RlcGraw and Williams, who
graduated. Holmes, Snively, Euwer
and Lipscomb, all members of last
year's Freshman team, are not avail
able either because of leaving school
or being declared ineligible.
Out of the squad of 65 that reported
for first practice the following appear
to have the best chances of making
the varsity:
Ends —Raymond, Jones, Davis and
Legend re. Tackles — -Keck, Rutan
Hopper, Halsey and Upson. Guards —
Thomas, Dickinson, Morgan and Mc-
Caull. Center—-Gallalian, Opie and
Scureman. Quarter —Lourie, Stimson
