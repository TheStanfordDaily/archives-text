"On September 6, press quotes you as
saying: 'The League has now passed be

date of October 7, Associated Press
quotes you as saying in speech in Des
Moines, lowa, this morning, in discus
sing the Covenant of the League of Na
tions, the following: 'I do not want to
clarify these obligations; I want to turn
my back on them. It is not interpreta
tion but rejection I am seeking.' If

port of you by thirty thousand women

iate ratification of the League and

composed of practically all the civilized
nations of the world. It is functioning
and accomplishing its purpose. It is an
inseparable part of the Treaty of Peace.
That Treaty will never be abandoned by
the nations of the world and no separate
peace with Germany will be tolerated by
the people of the United States."
This message was followed by a sec
ond telegram as follows:
"Before the nominating convention we
worked for the ratification of the Peace
Treaty. Until now we have kept out of
the campaign, but your recent speeches
as reported are unequivocal in their re
jection of the Versailles pact and the
League of Nations. Consequently we
propose to urge the election of your
opponent on that basis and regardless
of party lines. If we are in error in
our interpretation we should appreciate
hearing from you."

signed by the following: Mrs. William
Palmer Lucas, Mrs. Walter S. Brook

saying: 'The League has now passed be
yond possibilities of restoration.' under
date of October 7, Associated Press
quotes you as saying in speech in Des
Moines, lowa, this morning, in discus
sing the Covenant of the League of Na
tions, the following: 'I do not want to
clarify these obligations; I want to turn
my back on them. It is not interpreta
tion but rejection I am seeking.' If
these statements are true it makes sup
port of you by thirty thousand women
in California who stand for the immed
iate ratification of the League and
Treaty impossible. It is useless to dis
cuss some future concert of Nations.
The League of Nations is a fact. It is
composed of practically all the civilized
nations of the world. It is functioning
and accomplishing its purpose. It is an
inseparable part of the Treaty of Peace.
That Treaty will never be abandoned by
the nations of the world and no separate
peace with Germany will be tolerated by
the people of the United States."
This message was followed by a sec
ond telegram as follows:
"Before the nominating convention we
worked for the ratification of the Peace
Treaty. Until now we have kept out of
the campaign, but your recent speeches
as reported are unequivocal in their re
jection of the Versailles pact and the
League of Nations. Consequently we
propose to urge the election of your
opponent on that basis and regardless
of party lines. If we are in error in
our interpretation we should appreciate
hearing from you."
Besides Mrs. Wilbur the message was
signed by the following: Mrs. William
Palmer Lucas, Mrs. Walter S. Brook
ings, Katherine Chandler, Mrs. James
Ellis Tucker, Julia George, Ida Finney,
Mackrille, Mrs. David S. Pringle, Eliza
beth Gerberding, Mrs. Julia Simmons,
Mrs. Robert A. Dean, Mrs Ernest J.
Mott, Marian Delany, Francis Jolliffe.
Mrs. Timothy Healy, Mrs. Charles A.
Hawkins. Julia Hochheimer, Miss S. M
Richardson.
