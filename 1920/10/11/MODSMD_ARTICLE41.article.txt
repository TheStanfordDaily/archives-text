# Pacific Coast Football Has Come Into Its Own

SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 11.—It looks
like a tought year for pigs.
There will have to be a heap o' them
slaughtered, for Pacific Coast football
ers are going to kick- more pigskins
around the gridiron this year than in
many a year past.
American football on the coast fin
ally has come into its own once more
after surviving the combined attacks
of the war and the importation of the
Rugby game. Colleges from Canada
to Mexico have launched the season
with full schedules and with coaches
and backers loudly proclaiming that
they have the real stuff.
What's more the general public is
taking heed, and listening with the
result that there is more football in
terest in the west than there has been
for a decate.
With the season just opening the
University of California, the Univer
sity of Southern California and Wash
ington State, the University of Wash
ington and Oregon Agricultural seem
to be the outstanding teams of their
respective sections.
But the general situation is far from
clear for Stanford and the southern
branch of the University of California
having big squads out and dopesters
almost without exception regard them
as mysterious elements. Stanford
came back to the American game and
the inner circle of collegiate sport last
year after first prolonging a flirtation
with Rugby and then quarreling with
the University of California over the
question of permitting freshmen to
play. Last year her showing was a
bit sorry. But this year Stanford is
"viewed with alarm" by numerous
gridiron seers.
The University of California south
ern branch in Los Angeles boasts an
enrollment of 2,500 and with Harry
Trotter as coach, is promising to put
some exotic seasoning into the coast
football pudding.
In the Pacific northwest Washing
ton State and the University of Wash
ington have strong back fields, while
the Oregon Aggies are concentrating
on the development of a line, feeling
that their backs are in a class with
any.
The University of Oregon team
which fought Harvard to a standstill
in the East-West game on New Year's
Day at Pasadena, will be weakened
considerably this year by the loss of
many of its veterans. Coach Shy
Huntington, is about all there is left of
last year's machine.
The University of California is con
ceded things pretty much its own way
in northern California, unless Stan
ford carries out its threat to spoil the
dope sheets.
Southern California is backing the
University of Southern California to
beat the University of California and
represent the west in the East-West
game at Pasadena. The Methodists
have many of their last year's men
back on the squad. Pomona's team
is virtually the same as last year—
light and speedy. Occidental is ad
mittedly weak.
Two important intersectional games
are scheduled, both with northwestern
teams representing the coast, in ad
dition to the Pasadena classic New
Year's Day. Washington State will
play Nebraska at Lincoln on Novem
ber 25 and Dartmouth will play the
University of Washington at Seattle
November 27.

SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 11.—It looks
like a tought year for pigs.
There will have to be a heap o' them
slaughtered, for Pacific Coast football
ers are going to kick- more pigskins
around the gridiron this year than in
many a year past.
American football on the coast fin
ally has come into its own once more
after surviving the combined attacks
of the war and the importation of the
Rugby game. Colleges from Canada
to Mexico have launched the season
with full schedules and with coaches
and backers loudly proclaiming that
they have the real stuff.
What's more the general public is
taking heed, and listening with the
result that there is more football in
terest in the west than there has been
for a decate.
With the season just opening the
University of California, the Univer
sity of Southern California and Wash
ington State, the University of Wash
ington and Oregon Agricultural seem
to be the outstanding teams of their
respective sections.
But the general situation is far from
clear for Stanford and the southern
branch of the University of California
having big squads out and dopesters
almost without exception regard them
as mysterious elements. Stanford
came back to the American game and
the inner circle of collegiate sport last
year after first prolonging a flirtation
with Rugby and then quarreling with
the University of California over the
question of permitting freshmen to
play. Last year her showing was a
bit sorry. But this year Stanford is
