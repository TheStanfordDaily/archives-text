# MARINE COMMANDER VISITS ON CAMPUS
## 
### 
Colonel B. W. Sibley, commander of
the famous regiment of American mar
ines who fought in the battle of Chateau
Thierry, was a visitor on the campus
this weekend. He was the guest of
Professor C. G. Allan of the Romanic
Languages department.
Colonel Sibley was in active command
of the American Marines all through the
Chauteau Thierry battle, and saw some
of the fiercest fighting of the entire war.
It was in this battle that the great al
lied drive which finally ended in the
armistice began.
