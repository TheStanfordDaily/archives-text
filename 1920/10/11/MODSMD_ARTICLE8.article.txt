"SAN ANTONIO, Oct. 11.—The fe
male of the species is far more deadly
—and daring—than the male —especi-
ally in the ol' swimmin' hole. Of the
thirty-three rescus made this season at
San Antonio's community swimming
hole, twenty-seven were women, ac
cording to Anthony Curreon, life saver
of that, place. Women are harder to
save than men, said Curreon.
"They try to grab me around the
neck and strangle me," he said. "So
now I treat 'em rough, grabbing them
by their hair and holding them at
arm's length."
Curreon has one rule for the safety
of swimmers, which he says would
do away with pulmoters, life gaards
and first aid treatment. It is: "Don't
go in water over your head."
