### United Press 
LEAGUE PARK, Clevelond, Oct. 12.
—The Cleveland Indians are cham
pions of the base ball world. They
were crowned on League Park Feld
this afternoon when they took the
fourth straight game on their home
grounds, beating the Brooklyn Nation
als by a score of 3 to 0, making the
series count five games to two in their
favor.
Stanley Coveleskie, the Polish spit
)• ller, won a niche in Cleveland's hall
of fame for himself by pitching his
third victory over the Robins and
shutting them out with five hits. In
his three games against the Robins
Coveleskie allowed a total of fifteen
hits, five in each game and permitted
his opponents to cross the plate but
twice.
When the game was over thousands
of fans swarmed to the front of the
grand stand and staged one of the
most remarkable demonstrations ever
seen in baseball.
The moment that Sewell and
Wambsganss retired the last Brook
lyn player for the final out of the
series, manager Tris Speaker dashed
to the stands from his place in the
the center of the field and embraced
his gray-haired mother who occupied
a box.
