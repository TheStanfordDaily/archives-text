# BABES PLAY DAVIS ON STANFORD FIELD SATURDAY AFTERNOON
## 
### 
With the Stanford football varsity
in the southland playing the Univer
sity of Southern California the fresh
man game will hold the center of the
stage next Saturday. The Babes will
have for their opponents the foot
ballers from the University of Cali
fornia Farm School at Davis.
This Davis team looms up as a fair
ly strong aggregation and it should
force the Babes to hustle to beat them.
Last Saturday they hooked up with
Santa Clara and although they were
beaten 19 to 0 they made a creditable
showing against the Missionites who
are reputed to have a strong eleven.
Coach Seay is still experimenting
with new backfield material but as the
team now stands it is able to give al
most any of the teams in its class a
tough contest. The Babes are firm in
their belief that they suffered their
only defeat of the season two weeks
ago when the Marines trounced them
17 to 6, and they are contemplating a
clean sweep of the balance of their
schedule.
