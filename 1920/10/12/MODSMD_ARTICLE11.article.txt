# SEAT DRAWINGS COME TOMORROW FOR "RIETY'
## Corda Fratres Entertainment Friday Night Includes College Talent 
### 
Seat drawings for the Corda Fratres'
first big play of this season, "On'n off
Campus Riety" will take place Thurs
day. October 15. Drawings will be held
at o a. m. in Palo Alto ?it Crandall's, and
at 12:45 noon on the Campus at Sticky's.
This arrangement has been made with
the intention of accommodating the
large expected sale of seats to this sea
son's rushees, as well as the Paol Alto
theatergoers
Follows of Stanford histrionic talent
will recall the sparkling French dances
of Virginia Lowers which so pleased the
spectators of the 1919-20 Carnival. Miss
Lowers is to present some new and
gayer steps with the old and added zest
to her Friday night devotees.
An excellent company of juvenile
dancers is to be brought down from
Berkeley for the lovers of the aesthetic.
Vexing, variegated, versatile. Such
-is the act of L. A. Jacoby, '20, which
will combine with the other stellar at
tractions Friday night to entertain the
large expected attendance. Jacoby has
aptly named his clever sketch, "Refined
Prestidigitation," which title, he says,
not only clearly defines the character
istics of the act Jnit greatly aids the shy
and timid queeners in finding material
to loosen up on their stiff tongues.
Jacoby has decided to present his few
minutes of diversion as last produced or,
the Pantages Circuit. He is remembered
as being one of the features of last
year's Carnival at which he astounded
the students and the Palo Alto Police
Force by escaping unaided from a
straight-jacket. He promises something
still more novel on the 15th. It is to be
the latest Houdini escape, which is now
pleasing Hippodrome audiences in New
York.
To accomodate the terpsichorean-in
clined, a one o'clock dance has been ar
ranged for at the Women's Clubhouse
immediately after the play.
Coach Gordon Davis will hold a dress
rehearsal Thursday evening at 7 :30, and
expects to find all players prompt.
