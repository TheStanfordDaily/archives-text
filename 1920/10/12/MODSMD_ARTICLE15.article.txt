# LOCAL POLITICIANS PUN STRAW VOTE
## Polls to be Placed on Campus For Vote, Wed. Oct. 20; D. P. A. in Arrangements 
### 
The campus public will get a chance
to express its preference for presi
dential candidates before Election Day.
Arrangements for a straw vote ar- 1
being made by the Daily Palo Alto, in
conjunction with the Stanford Repub
lican Club and the local Cox-Roosevelt
Club.
Details of the vote are being worked
out by representatives of the paper
and the two political organizations.
The straw vote is in line with the
policy of the paper in keeping its read
ers informed of the campus opinion
on important matters. Jast January,
with many other colleges in the coun
try, the Daily Palo Alto held a starw
vote on the League of Nations. Seven
propositions were presented to campus
voters.
During the heated Hoover-Johnson
fight last May the paper conducted
another straw vote to determine the
campus' choice for the Republican
presidential nomination.
Considerable speculation exists as
to the campus attitude towards Hard
ing and Cox.
Local Republicans maintain that this
is a Republican year and the campus
will vote this way.
The Democrats point to the heavy
vote in favor of the League of Na
tions here and maintain that the ma
jority of this vote will go to Cox.
