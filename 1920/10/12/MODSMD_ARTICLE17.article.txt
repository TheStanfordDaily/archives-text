# STANFORD MOVES TO AID TEACHERS
## University to Grant Two Year Standing to Graduates of Normal Schools 
### 
Stanford University has taken ac
tion granting fuller recognition than
heretofore to graduates of Normal
Schools which, it is hoped, will aid
in overcoming the teacher shortage
in the State. By action of its faculty
the University will hereafter give full
two year's college standing to recom
mended graduates of approved State
Normal Schools, where the normal
training has been preceded by the full
four years of high school course or
where the high school and normal
courses together covers six years.
Hitherto such Normal School gradu
ates have been given ordinarily only
a year and one-half of college credit
upon entering the University.
This action has been taken upon the
request of a committee representing
the California Normal Schools which
conferred with the University authori
ties last summer. The Normal School
Committee advanced the argument
that this change would help to meet
the teacher shortage in California, es
pecially of men, in the elementary
schools.
The Normal School Committee felt
that more men would be likely to en
ter Normal School if at the end of
their two year course there they could
obtain the full two year's standing
at Stanford. Stanford was the more
disposed to grant this request since
the Normal School course has been
improved over its former require
ment and because such standing at
Stanford is given to good students
who have satisfactorily completed two
years in a high school Junior College.
It is felt that the two years of nor
mal training as now provided rank
at least as high as that obtained in
the average Junior College course.
The Stanford authorities have made
the proviso that Normal School grad
uates in order to obtain the two years
credit at Stanford must have taken
courses which are substantially equi
valent to the work of the Lower Di
vision at Stanford.
