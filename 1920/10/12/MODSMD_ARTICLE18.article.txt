That the function of the Men's Coun
cil is to interpret and maintain the Stan
for standard of conduct, was the key
note of the speech by Paul F. Eriekson,
'21, the prdsent president of the Council.
Eriekson sought to correct miscon
ceptions of the Council by explaining
that the disciplinary body was not pri
marily-concerned with the punishment of
individuals but with the development of
a campus spirit that wil lprevent breaches
of the Stanford standard. A frank
warning was given that the offenders of
the rule against tubbing will be severely
punished.
Dorothy Johnson, '21, president of the
Women's Conference, won instant ap
plause when she declared that the "s(X)''

the student body and not an organization
apart. The individual responsibility oi
the student and a citizen were empha
sized by the speaker.
The organization and relation of Stan
ford sports were outlined by Paul Camp
bell, a mainstay of the varsity footbail
team. Campbell was very optimistic in
his speech, declaring that the field con
ditions and training of the gridmen were
fifty per cent better this season than lasi
year. Campbell appealed for a united
support of athletics by the students in
order that the Stanford reputation m.l|
be maintained.
W. F. Leiser, '21, of the Daily Palo
Alto, presented a short resume of the
opportunities of Stanford publications.
Unusual opportunities for advancement,
await new students entering journalism
as a student activity, Leiser asserted.
The graduation of former campus edit
ors like Donaldson, Van Every, and
Wohlford. makes the addition of new
staff members to the publications nec
essary.
The closing speech of the assembly
was made by Ed Martin, '18, Graduate
Manager, who in a short talk outlined
the business condition of the student
body. Martin was emphatic in his de
claration that all students should at once
apply for "Big Game" tickets in order
that Stanford may receive a large al
location of tickets. Plans for the erection
of the football stadium to accomodate
fifty thousand spectators were explained
by the manager.
