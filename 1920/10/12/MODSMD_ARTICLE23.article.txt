# SATISFYING BOTH GROUPS
## 
### 
DERHAPS in answer to Herbert Hoover's opening campaign speech
in which Hoover reminded the nation that the Republican party is
pledged to support a world association. Senator Harding issued a state
ment yesterday in which he attempts to satisfy the Hoover group and
the Johnson-Borah clan at the same time. The candidate reaffirms
his position on a world association by declaring himself strongly in
favor of such an association, although he is unalterably opposed to the
League of Nations as it stands now.
He says, "First—l am unalterably opposed to going into the League
of Nations as that particular proposition now stands. That proposal is
contemptous and potentially destructive of the American Constitution.
It is not favored by the American people. Second—l am in favor of a
zuortd association—call it what you will; the name is of slight conse
quence—that will discourage or tend to prevent war and that will en
courage or tend to encourage a better understanding among nations
of the earth. The old order of things is done with, not only in Amer
ica, but throughout the world, and the United States, always quick with
sympathy, always just and usually led by common sense, must play its
part in this new order."
There can be no question or argument now as to Senator Harding's
position. ITe has made the above statement, probably urged by the
Hoover and Taft group, and his stand cannot be mistaken.
