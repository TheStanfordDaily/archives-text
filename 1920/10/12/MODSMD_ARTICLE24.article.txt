# STRAW BALLOT
## 
### 
JN ORDER TO determine the sentiment of the campus on the com
ing presidential election, the Daily Palo Alto, assisted by the Stan
ford Republican and Democratic clubs, will take a straw ballot of the
student body and faculty members next week. As the 90-day residence
rule will deprive many from casting their votes in the November elec
tion, the straw ballot will be their only opportunity to express a choice.
Tt is hoped that each student will make an honest and independent de
cision so that the results will be an accurate indication of campus
opinion.
