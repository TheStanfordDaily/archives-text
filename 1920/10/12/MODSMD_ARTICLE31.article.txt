According to the U. of Washington
Daily, track prospects are the best
for years. With nine letter men out
for fall track and more due to re
port later, and with nearly all of last
year's leading freshmen cinder men
back. Washington's prospects for a
winning track team are brighter this
season than they have been for some'
years past.
