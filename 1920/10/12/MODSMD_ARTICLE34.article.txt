# CONGRESSIONAL PARTY RECEIVED IN TOKIO
## Hersman, of Korean Incident, Behind Party—Sought by Interviewers 
### HENRY W. KINNEY 
( United Press Staff Correspondent )
TOKYO, September 3. (By Mail.) —
The congressional party, or rather the
remnant thereof, consisting of one sen
ator and ten congressmen who made the
trip through Korea and to Japan, finally
reached Tokyo last night, and were
given a very cordial reception by a large
number of high Japanese officials and
members of the American embassy staff,
other members of the American colony
being mainly noticeable by their absence.
The party has been put up in the Im
perial Hotel, and will now run the
gamut of a series of official receptions,
garden parties, dinners and other such
entertainment. The Japanese frankly
admit that they are aware of the fact
that their enemies will claim that they
are trying to prt*judice the congressional
visitors in their favor by appeal to their
stomachs rather than to brains, but they
want nevertheless to show the travelers
every possible courtesy and will trust to
their good sense not to misjudge their
motives.
The merry whirl began with a great
luncheon, attended by about five hund
red persons, principally Japanese officials,
and given by Prince Tokugawa, Presid
ent of the House of Peers and Speaker
Oka of the House of Representatives
The usual welcome speeches were re
sponded to by Senator W. J. Harris and
by Congressman John W. Small. The
later said, referring evidently to Cali
fornia, that one state can not sway the
public opinion of the entire United
States, adding that those who were try
ing to exaggerate the differences be
tween the United States and Japan were
only jingoes. Both countries were too
intent on justice and were too friendly
disposed towards each other ever to
make is possible for any difficulty to
find solution in other than a pacific man
ner.
The Japanese had plainly taken the
hint given when some of the congress
men let it be known that China's action
in serving grape juice only at many ban
quets there had been too exaggerated
an attention to their feelings as citizens
of the United States, and at the lunch
eon they enjoyed three kinds of wine.
The only incident which has marred
the trip so far is that in which Con
gressman Hersman, of California, was
the hero in Seoul, when he appeared at
a meeting of Koreans, and made a
speech, whereupon some Koreans made
speeches until the meeting was declared
off by the police. When the police inter
fered with the Koreans, Hersman in
.terferred with them and it took an hour
to straighten out the matter. Officiallj
it is now insisted by the party that.Hers
man actually did not know, that the
meeting had been called off and that he
went there quite innocently.
The Tokoyo papers have been anxious
to get from Hersman his version of the
affair, but he is not with the party, hav
ing remained behind at Nara to look
after his mother, who is ill.
The Tokoyo daily Torodzu in speak
ing of this incident says: "Has not Mr.
Hersman fallen into a trap laid by the
Koreans? He is a member of Congress
from California. Has he himself staged
the whole incident in order to obtain a
souvenir which he may bring home to
aid the cause of anti-Japanese agitation."
While, prior to the arrival of the
party, the Tokoyo papers took compar
atively little notice of their coming, thev
have, made up for lost time during the
past few days. Their comment has on
the whole been extremely friendly, the
great note which is running through it
all being that better acquaintance with
and the Japanese may tend to inspire
the congressmen with a feeling of friend
liness towards that nation.

and the Japanese may tend to inspire

TOKYO, September 3. (By Mail.) —
The congressional party, or rather the
remnant thereof, consisting of one sen
ator and ten congressmen who made the
trip through Korea and to Japan, finally
reached Tokyo last night, and were
given a very cordial reception by a large
number of high Japanese officials and
members of the American embassy staff,
other members of the American colony
being mainly noticeable by their absence.
The party has been put up in the Im
perial Hotel, and will now run the
gamut of a series of official receptions,
garden parties, dinners and other such
entertainment. The Japanese frankly
admit that they are aware of the fact
that their enemies will claim that they
are trying to prt*judice the congressional
visitors in their favor by appeal to their
stomachs rather than to brains, but they
want nevertheless to show the travelers
every possible courtesy and will trust to
their good sense not to misjudge their
motives.
The merry whirl began with a great
luncheon, attended by about five hund
red persons, principally Japanese officials,
and given by Prince Tokugawa, Presid
ent of the House of Peers and Speaker
Oka of the House of Representatives
The usual welcome speeches were re
sponded to by Senator W. J. Harris and
by Congressman John W. Small. The
later said, referring evidently to Cali
fornia, that one state can not sway the
public opinion of the entire United
States, adding that those who were try
ing to exaggerate the differences be
tween the United States and Japan were
only jingoes. Both countries were too
intent on justice and were too friendly
disposed towards each other ever to
make is possible for any difficulty to
find solution in other than a pacific man
ner.
The Japanese had plainly taken the
hint given when some of the congress
men let it be known that China's action
in serving grape juice only at many ban
quets there had been too exaggerated
an attention to their feelings as citizens
of the United States, and at the lunch
eon they enjoyed three kinds of wine.
The only incident which has marred
the trip so far is that in which Con
gressman Hersman, of California, was
the hero in Seoul, when he appeared at
a meeting of Koreans, and made a
speech, whereupon some Koreans made
speeches until the meeting was declared
off by the police. When the police inter
fered with the Koreans, Hersman in
.terferred with them and it took an hour
to straighten out the matter. Officiallj
it is now insisted by the party that.Hers
man actually did not know, that the
meeting had been called off and that he
went there quite innocently.
The Tokoyo papers have been anxious
to get from Hersman his version of the
affair, but he is not with the party, hav
ing remained behind at Nara to look
after his mother, who is ill.
The Tokoyo daily Torodzu in speak
ing of this incident says: "Has not Mr.
Hersman fallen into a trap laid by the
Koreans? He is a member of Congress
from California. Has he himself staged
the whole incident in order to obtain a
souvenir which he may bring home to
aid the cause of anti-Japanese agitation."
While, prior to the arrival of the
party, the Tokoyo papers took compar
atively little notice of their coming, thev
have, made up for lost time during the
past few days. Their comment has on
the whole been extremely friendly, the
great note which is running through it
all being that better acquaintance with
