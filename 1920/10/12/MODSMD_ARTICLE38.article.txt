To the D. P. A. Editor—Sir: If Herb
ert Hoover was the Republican candi
date, it is safe to say that nearly every
one of us would be cheering from the
G. O. P. side of the fence this year.
However, the Republican convention
disposed of Mr. Hoover last June by
giving him six votes out of a possible
thousand. They wanted Senator Hard
ing and now they have him.
Which one of these two men really
represents the complexion of the con
trolling forces of the Republican party
organization—Harding, who got over
900 votes and the nomination besides, or
Hoover with his six votes? Figures at
times are very illuminating and that fact
coupled with the above comparison
brings us to your editorial of yesterday.
In it you quoted the statement of
Herbert Hoover that the Republican
party was in favor of the League. What
you failed to quote was Harding's state
ment made on the same subject last
Thursday in Des Moines that informed
us that the League was "scrapped." The
line "it is not interpretation, but rejec
tion, that I am seeking" sounds like it
came from the collected works of John
son and Borah, but it was Harding that
furnished us that "irreconcilable" gem
in the same speech.
You can see that this is diametrically
opposed to Hoover's League stand. How
you are able to reconcile the two and
inform us that "we must take their (the
Republicans) pledge as expressed by
Hoover that the highly important princ
iple of a world league be adopted" is
one'on poor old Mr. Einstein. That may
be the pledge of some few Republicans,
but not of the great majority that nom
inated Harding.
But in your editorial you seemed to
get a good deal more cheer out of Hard
ing's offer to get the country "back to
normal" than you did out of his League
stand, (whateever it is at the time this
goes to press). And here I am
sorry that I have to differ. Didn't four
years of war prove that we were living
in a changing world and that getting
back to a pre-war normal now is impos
sible, if not undesirable? In such a
world of change our minds should be
directed towards the future, not the
past, and instead of spending our efforts
in getting "back to normal" we should
be experimenting to tind new means iO
handle these changed conditions. This
"back to normal" slogan lias a soothing
and deadening effect, but does it mean
anything?
I am,
Below normal,
R. W. KENNY.

Editor of the Daily Palo Alto: —
Now that the Republican attitude
has been so well expressed in your
editorial in yesterday's /Daily, cap
tioned by the phrase, "Back to Nor
mal," may not the Democratic view
point be published under the title,
"Forward to Progress." The differ
ence in the two phrases is an accurate
index to the candidates in this cam
paign. That the country insists upon
a change is conceded. Harding seeks
to meet that demand by returaing to
the "good old days," (whatever they
are); Cox is frankly forward-looking

in his program. Heaven only knows
to what normal condition Harding
wishes to return, for he has given up
no clear conception of what he desires.
We can't go "back to the normal"
days of July, 1914. The world that
existed then has gone forever. We
can't return to the "normalcy" of 1900.
A resurrection of Mark Hanna is un
thinkable.
The Harding phrase is nothing more
or less than a n attempt to take ad
vantage of the war weariness and
ennui after the strain of intense en
deavor. St. Mihiel and the Argonne
are a long ways in the past, and Mr.
Average Voter is bored and disgusted
when reference is made to our moral
obligations. "Forget it," he says, and
turns with relief to the "Back to Nor
mal" slogan with its soothing-syrup
suggestion of freedom from war taxes
and responsibilities. The phrase
simply aims to capitalize war weari
ness for partisan purposes with no
intent of frankly facing the critical
problems and recognizinz tluat the
only way "out" is "forward."
Your paragraph concerning the
League is a clever argument to catch
pro-League votes; but it is clever only
so far as it departs from the official
Republican stand. Harding is the last
few days has been unequivocal. "It
is rejection of the League that I am
seeking," he declared at Des Moines.
Admittedly, he a nebulous idea of
some form or other of a league in his
head, and tho he has painfully tried
to express it, no one yet knows what
he is proposing as a substitute for the
League. A fair interpretation of his
stand is that he will ask the world
powers to dissolve the League, al
ready in operation, and invite them to
join America in a brand new associa
tion built on "normal" plans.
I will vote for Cox because I am a
Republican. In foreign policy, the
Republican tradition dovetails in with
the assumption of responsibility in
the League. The party which pur
chased Alaska, acquired Hawaii and
the Philippins, and fought the Span
ish War, would now support the
League if the urge of partisan feeling
by the Senatorial cabel had not placed
it in an unnatural position which is
false to its past history. In domestic
policy, the only hope of progressiveism
is a stinging rebuke of the nomina
tion of the reactionary Harding and
his attempt to misrepresent Republi
canism by the phrase "Back to Nor
mal.'
