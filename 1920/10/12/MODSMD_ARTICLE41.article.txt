# FORENSIC PLANS FOR THIS YEAR ALTERED
## Old Squad System Rejected in Favor of Tryouts, Teamwork Insured 
### 
Forensic activities for the coming yeai
will assume a new aspect in view of
the altered plans arranged l»y Coach M
L. McClintock last season. The recent
practice of tryouts by means of the
squad system is to be replaced by com
petitive contests a few weeks before the
final debate, thus insuring teamwork in
the chosen squad. A regular schedule
of debates somewhat similar in aspect
to the intra-mural system now used in
athletics will be arranged later in the
season. By means of these minor de
bates new material may be found for the
college teams and a greater interest in
debating activities created. The college
debating societies will be expected to
produce their share of speakers, as well
as to promote interest in their activities.
Individual contests in extemporaneous
debates are contemplated by McClintock,
by means of which lie expects to dc
velope seasoned speakers for the Joffrc
debate with California. Alternating
speeches of five minutes by the contest
ing speakers amounting in all, to half
hour speeches by each man are the only
rules by which the extemporaneous con
tests are to be governed at the present
time.
Contests between the, local debating
societies and the societies and collegc
teams of other institutions will play a
large part in putting debating well to
ward the front in college activities. Mc-
Clintock, who will not coach debating
until the winter quarter, hopes to have a
definite schedule worked out by that
time. W. F. Lciser, '21, is acting in
McClintock's place in that capacity for
the current quarter.
