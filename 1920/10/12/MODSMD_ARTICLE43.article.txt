## 
### 
Golf is offered as a gymnasium course
this quarter under Coach Duffy Seay
A meeting was held some time ago but
there were not enough men there to
profitably form a club and a meeting i:;
called for tomorrow afternoon when all
men interested in golf are requested to
meet in the office of Encina Gymnasium
at 5:00 p. mâ€ž Coach Seay will discuss
plans for the formation of some sort of
an association to promote golf among
the students.
A special rate is offered to students
in the University by the Menlo Countiy
Club and the rate will entitle the studem
member to all the athletic privileges of
the club. There are at the present time
twelve students who have asked that
golf be included in the athletic curri
culum and the gymnasium department is
anxious to start the sport off at once.
