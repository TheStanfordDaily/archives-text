KERLIN, Oct. 1 (by mail). —Radical-
ism has had a severe setback in Ger
many.
This setback to radicalism has result
ed from a campaign of education over
true situation in Russia brought back by
the more conservative of the German so
cialist delegates to the Moscow confer
ence.
They have shown that Russia is no
workmen's paradise. By concrete evi
dence they have convinced many German
radicals that sovietism and Bolshevism
are not "the cure-all they once believed.
They have shown how a group of Ger
man workers who to Russia under
misapprehensions have now nothing but
disillusionment and home-sickness.
They have been ill-treated and are
nearly starved. And, this story has left
its imprint on the German worker. It
,is destined to lead to a snlit in the in
dependent party at its October conven
tion, when the communists will go into
one group and the more conservative in
to another.
On the other hand, the reactionaries
arc active and becoming more unified.
An organization with the title "Orgesch"
(Organization Escherich) has been
formed with branches over the whole
land, whose purpose is to keep intact
the Einwohncrwehr though not under
that name.
This body has hidden its arms, and
proposes to hang on to them. In case of
need, the old Einwohncrwehr members
would be called out, but as Orgesch men.
Included in this group are landowners,
factory owners, and in general the re
actionary elements of the community. It
is particularly strong in East Prussia
among the Junkers, and has a strong
standing in Bavaria, Pommerania, and
other places where the opposition to dis
armament is strong.
The possibility of a "Putsch" from this
direction is ever present.
Naturally, too, there is always a chance
of the communists starting something.
But, the split in the independent ranks
and the repulse of tlicr red Russian
brothers has worked as a cold douche
upon the hotheads who want to do some
more world-reyoluting in Germany.
The main danger from the "left" side
lies in the prospect of much unemploy
ment during the winter. Hunger and
worklessness may cause an upset of se
rious proportions, but at the moment the
prospects for reddism and bloodshed
have been considerably reduced.
