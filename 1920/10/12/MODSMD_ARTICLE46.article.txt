# Sequoia Club Offers Prize For New Song
## 
### 
Members of the Sequoia Club have
contributed fifteen dollars to be used as
a prize for a new Stanford song. The
money is to be offered to the student
body which will conduct the contest.
1 lie object is to secure a new song in
time for the big game.
Either an entirely new song with new
words and music, or new words set to
some familiar tune will be acceptable,
but the song must have pep, and plenty
of it, according to announcement made
by the Sequoia committee.
