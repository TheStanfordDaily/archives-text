### 
Coach Powell will journey to Los
Angeles with nineteen or twenty of
the members of the varsity football
squad to do battle with the University
of Southern California eleven, next

a strong team this season and Powell
will be forced to use his best line-up
to make a Cardinal victory.
Forty men are reporting every night
for practice with the varsity squad
and according to the announcement

made by the coach this morning no
cut will probably be made in the squad
during the season. However, only
about half of the candidates for the
team will be taken to meet the college
in the south next Saturday.
The men will be given light prac
tices again tonight because of the
condition of the men following last
week's game and because of the wet
field. There will probably be prac
tice scrimmage tomorrow night
against the freshman eleven.
The Cardinal gridiron warriors will
not be seen in action against an out
side aggregation on the campus again
until the game with the University
of Oregon team, scheduled for October
30. The Stanford players will meet
the Santa Clara football varsity on
the Mission field on October 23. Grad

special arrangements to get a large
number of rooters at attend the Stan
ford-Santa Clara game.
