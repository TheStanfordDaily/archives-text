i of opening and carrying a checking account in Palo Alto is approxi- !
* mately $8.75 per annum. |
t Any checking account which maintains a balance less than $100.00 f
I is carried at a loss by the bank. j
I Palo Alto and Mayfield are essentially residential and university |
i communities, consequently, the business of the local banks is largely •
f made up of innumerable small personal checking accounts.
f The cost of stationery, supplies, salaries, and in fact every item of i
j expense connected with the operation of a bank has increased enor- T
i mously within the last few years. I
I In view of the above, the banks in Palo Alto and Mayfield have i
t reached the unanimous conclusion that they cannot longer afford to ?
1 carry these unprofitable accounts without any charge. t
f Beginning OetOber 1, 1920, the undersigned banks will make a |
I monthly charge of 50 cents against commercial accounts the balance 1
? of which at any time during the month shall fall below $50.00.

I ANNOUNCEMENT!
1 By careful analysis it has been determined that the average cost j
i of opening and carrying a checking account in Palo Alto is approxi- !
* mately $8.75 per annum. |
t Any checking account which maintains a balance less than $100.00 f
I is carried at a loss by the bank. j
I Palo Alto and Mayfield are essentially residential and university |
i communities, consequently, the business of the local banks is largely •
f made up of innumerable small personal checking accounts.
f The cost of stationery, supplies, salaries, and in fact every item of i
j expense connected with the operation of a bank has increased enor- T
i mously within the last few years. I
I In view of the above, the banks in Palo Alto and Mayfield have i
t reached the unanimous conclusion that they cannot longer afford to ?
1 carry these unprofitable accounts without any charge. t
f Beginning OetOber 1, 1920, the undersigned banks will make a |
I monthly charge of 50 cents against commercial accounts the balance 1
? of which at any time during the month shall fall below $50.00.
