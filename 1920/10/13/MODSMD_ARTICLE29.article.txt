# ANTI-VIVISECTION AMENDMENT TOPIC OF WILBUR'S TALK
## Direct Attack Upon Right of University to Teach Truth Says President in Lecture 
### 
"The proposed anti-vivisection law
is a most direct attack upon the right
of the University to teach the truth,"
declared President Wilbur, in his ad
dress upon the subject at the Little
Theater, last evening, A large and
interested audience heard the Presi
dent discuss this very vital question.
Speaking first from a historical view
point, Dr. Wilbus outlined the history
of the movement, but spoke more es
pecially upon the injuries which would
result from the adoption of Amend
ment 7, which is the anti-vivisection
measure. The exact wording of the
measure reads as follows: "An act de
claring it to be unlawful to dissect,
vivisect, torture, or experiment upon
any living human being or living ani
mal for the purpose of experimental
physiologicol or experimental path
ological investigation."
Dr. Wilbur asserted that it was up
To the people of the State of Cali
fornia. now, rather than to the legis
lators, to defeat this so evidently
harmful measure.
A series of illustrations showed
effectively the accomplishments made
by vivisection in fighting small pox,
yellow fever, and diseases of such a
contagious nature. Should California
adopt Amendment 7, it will be a vir
tual quarantine, in relation to the
other states, since no animals could
be shipped out of the state because
they could not first be examined for
cholera, blackleg, or any other disease.
No milk could be certified against
tuberculosis, as no cows could be in
oculated with tuberculin to make the
tuberculosis test.
1 he milk industry would be serious
ly effected by this situation. The
owner of dairy cattle would probably
go bankrupt as he would be prevented
rom examining his cattle to keep them
in a healthy condition.
Without animal experimentation
thousands of benefits to mankind could
never have been discovered. It has
given us wonderful results. It has
nearly abolished lockjaw, blood poison
ing, erysipelas, hydrophobia, yellow
fever.
It has reduced the death rate of
diphtheria and recebrospinal mening
itis to one quarter of their former toll.
It has almost completely controlled
typhoid fever and bubonic plague.
Without animal experimentation
these benefits to mankind would have
been unknown.
President Wilbur also emphasized
the important work which lias been
done in the olive industry. Canning
of olives has been made absolutely
safe from botulism by animal experi
mentation.
The amendment prohibits the mak
ing of vaccination, inocculation or
other medication, a condition prece
dent for the admission of anybody to
any educational institution, public or
private, for employment in public or
private business or for any right, duty
or privilege whatever. This would
practiqally abolish quarantine |aws
and absolutely stop the present mea
sures against veneral diseases. It
would stop necessary measures for
the exclusion of typhoid carriers from
the handling of. food, and many other
important requirements for the pro
tection of the public health.
Dr. Wilbur closed by again exort
ing the citizens of the State to vote
against Amendment 7, the anti-vivi
section measure, at the election in No
vember.
