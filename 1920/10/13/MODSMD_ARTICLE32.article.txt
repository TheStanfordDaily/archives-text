CTANFORD students must realize that, as university men and women,
their actions are watched closely by the public, and any breach of the
laws of society by a university student, no matter how slight, is seized
upon immediately by the newspapers and "played up" for the benefit of
the curious public. The result is that the name of the University is
drawn into the affair and reflections cast upon the characters of its stu
dents and authorities. The impression is created that certain vices and
forms of misconduct are tolerated, and, in the end, the fair name of the
University suffers.
The recent "smoking" story" here at Stanford, and the fraternity
and "free-love" episodes at the University of California, are examples.
The Sacramento lice labored under the illusion for a long time that the
University of California closed its eves to such action, and that paper
took the trouble to institute a campaign against the authorities of the
university, claiming that the men and women of the university were
immoral.
The name of Stanford follows every student of this University
wherever he goes, and in whatever he does, and this fact must always
be kept in mind so that the name of fhis institution shall always be free
from stain.
