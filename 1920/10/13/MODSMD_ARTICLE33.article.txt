pOR the past few years, the spirit and pep manifested by the Stanford
rooters has been decidedly poor. A portion of the blame is always laid
to the yell leaders, but the major portion can perhaps be placed on the
lack of good, snappy songs. "The Cardinal Is Waving" and "Come,
Join the Band" are the only two in the Stanford song book that caiii
arouse the bleachers to any extent, and they do not have the proper "fire."
This condition can be remedied by a song contest, and suitable awards
given for the best offerings.
