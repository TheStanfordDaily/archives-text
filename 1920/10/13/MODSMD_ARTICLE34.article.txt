# FOOTBALL RALLY
## 
### 
first rally of the year will take place in Encina Hall tonight, and
all students should take the opportunity to give the Varsity a good
send-off before their trip to Los Angeles to play the University of
Southern California. It will also give football enthusiasts a chance to
meet Coach Powell and Freshman Coach Seay, and to hear their latest
information on the teams.
