# GERMANY LOOKS TO UNITED STATES

BERLIN, (By mail). —It can be said,
that Germany as a whole, despite its
dislike of the 14 Points, looks with
more favor on a working arrangement
with America than with England. In the
contest between England and America
for supremacy on the seas, Germany's
sympathy is unquestionably with Amer
ica.
The German is convinced that, despite
the fact that America has not con
cluded peace with Germany, there is
a spirit in America favoring business
relations and the rebuilding of German
economic life. On the other hand, Ger
many feels that France, who has con
cluded peace, is working unsparingly for
economic destruction of Germany for
France's own ends. This feeling has
been strengthened by Millerand's recent
journey through the occupied Rhine ter
ritory, by evidence that Gen. Lerond in
Upper Silesia was operating favorably
toward the Poles, and by the fact that

France was opposing German participa
tion in the Geneva conference.
Germany is anxious to participate in
the Geneva conference, in order to know
how to regulate its affairs. Through
Geneva, it expects clear decisions which
permit of shaping definitely for the fu
ture rather than drifting aimlessly with
out a clear understanding of what the
entente will impose on her.
