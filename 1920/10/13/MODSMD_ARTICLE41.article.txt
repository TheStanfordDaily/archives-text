# Another Viewpoint
## 
### 
After reading tlie two communications
under tlie heading "Another Viewpoint,"
in last evening's Daily Palo Alto. I was
astonished ;it the apparent misconception
of the term "Back to Normal." It seems
that this phrase carried with it, to the
two gentlemen writing, a taste of utter
reaction. I must admit that the word
Hack if looked at ni one light would
appear to imply a return—a return, let
us say. "to Normal." But 1 fail to see
how this weakens the pointedness and
expressiveness of the phrase. Let us
analyze the expression. Is it possible
that there is an objection to the reestab
lishing of a "normal bases on which lo
conduct not only our government but
likewise our every day life? We must
make a choice. Either the "normal"
basis must be taken—or the abnormal.
This brings out the heart of the apt
slogan "Back to Normal." Is it dfe
puted that during the past few yeais
that we have been existing in an ab
normal way? I think that all will agree
that abnormal conditions surrounded us.
It is to rid the country of the "hand
over" of these years that the Republican
Party proposes to return to normal.
Now, it may be asked—does the Re
publican Party fail to appreciate the fact
that certain new conditions have come
into being during these years which are
very apt to stay with us? No. I be
lieve that such is clearly not the case.
Governor Calvin Coolidge in his Accept
ance Speech of July 27, 1920, states, "In
all things a return to a peace basis does
not mean the basis of 1914. That day
is gone. It means a peace basis of the
present, higher and nobler, because of
the sacrifices made and the duties as
sumed. It is not a retreat, it is a new
summons to advance.'
It is urged that the "Back to Normal"
slogan has a soothing and deadening
effect and indeed that that is its sole
purpose—to put the American people oft
guard. Some good Republicans might
admit for the sake of argument that it
would not be a bad thing to have an
administration which could "sooth" the
American people after the wild and un
certain Democratic administration of the
past few years. The people of this
country want to be permitted to think
out their problems, rather than having
them handed to them in a predigested
form. In the Saturday Evening Pos:
of a few weeks ago was a most ex
pressive cartoon. It pictured the Demo
cratic "boss" instructing Governor Cox
to keep the spot ilght on Miss League
as she danced before the American peo
ple. In the background of the stage
stood the other dancers such as, Demo
cratic Inefficiency, Miss Autocracy, etc
The American people are not to lie fool
ed. They wish such conditions to exist
once more as have existed in the past—
to this extent that they be taken into
confidence and given a share in the con
trol of the government of this Republic.
They feel kindly to all nations, but this
does not prevent them from the decided
need of a house cleaning in our govern
ment. Vital domestic problems come
lirst. Senator Harding will meet these
problems, and with cooperation and sug
gestion will solve them. The unnatural
and abnomal conditions will be destroy
ed, but the natural and normal, though
perhaps changed, conditions will take
their rightful place. As Senator Hard
ing says, "Let us take stock for a mou
ent of America in the world. Ave, and
of America at home. Let us be done
with wiggling and wobbling. Steady
America - "

After reading tlie two communications
under tlie heading "Another Viewpoint,"
in last evening's Daily Palo Alto. I was
astonished ;it the apparent misconception
of the term "Back to Normal." It seems
that this phrase carried with it, to the
two gentlemen writing, a taste of utter
reaction. I must admit that the word
Hack if looked at ni one light would
appear to imply a return—a return, let
us say. "to Normal." But 1 fail to see
how this weakens the pointedness and
expressiveness of the phrase. Let us
analyze the expression. Is it possible
that there is an objection to the reestab
lishing of a "normal bases on which lo
conduct not only our government but
likewise our every day life? We must
make a choice. Either the "normal"
basis must be taken—or the abnormal.
This brings out the heart of the apt
slogan "Back to Normal." Is it dfe
puted that during the past few yeais
that we have been existing in an ab
normal way? I think that all will agree
that abnormal conditions surrounded us.
It is to rid the country of the "hand
over" of these years that the Republican
Party proposes to return to normal.
Now, it may be asked—does the Re
publican Party fail to appreciate the fact
that certain new conditions have come
into being during these years which are
very apt to stay with us? No. I be
lieve that such is clearly not the case.
Governor Calvin Coolidge in his Accept
ance Speech of July 27, 1920, states, "In
all things a return to a peace basis does
not mean the basis of 1914. That day
is gone. It means a peace basis of the
present, higher and nobler, because of
the sacrifices made and the duties as
sumed. It is not a retreat, it is a new
summons to advance.'
It is urged that the "Back to Normal"
slogan has a soothing and deadening
effect and indeed that that is its sole
purpose—to put the American people oft
guard. Some good Republicans might
admit for the sake of argument that it
would not be a bad thing to have an
administration which could "sooth" the
American people after the wild and un
certain Democratic administration of the
past few years. The people of this
country want to be permitted to think
out their problems, rather than having
them handed to them in a predigested
form. In the Saturday Evening Pos:
of a few weeks ago was a most ex
pressive cartoon. It pictured the Demo
cratic "boss" instructing Governor Cox
to keep the spot ilght on Miss League
as she danced before the American peo
ple. In the background of the stage
stood the other dancers such as, Demo
cratic Inefficiency, Miss Autocracy, etc
The American people are not to lie fool
ed. They wish such conditions to exist
once more as have existed in the past—
to this extent that they be taken into
confidence and given a share in the con
trol of the government of this Republic.
They feel kindly to all nations, but this
does not prevent them from the decided
need of a house cleaning in our govern
ment. Vital domestic problems come
lirst. Senator Harding will meet these
problems, and with cooperation and sug
gestion will solve them. The unnatural
and abnomal conditions will be destroy
ed, but the natural and normal, though
perhaps changed, conditions will take
their rightful place. As Senator Hard
