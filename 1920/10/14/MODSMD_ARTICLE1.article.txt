# VARSITY GRIDMEN LEAVE STANFORD TONIGHT FOR L.A.
## Sunny Day on Southern Field May Allow Real Showing Of New Cardinal Strength 
### 
Nineteen varsity football men will
leave at 8:45 o'clock tonight for
Los Angeles. They are scheduled to
meet the University of Southern
California eleven, Saturday afternoon
on the Trojan's football turf. Coach
Powell will not definitely select the
men to make the trip until after prac
tice this afternoon. He has announced
that men will be selected from the
following twenty-two gridiron candi
dates:
Ends —Pelouze, K. Shlaudeman, and
Adams.
Tackles —Pershing, McAlpine Hel
ser and Pollard.
Guards—Deems, Stice, Cravens and
Levy.
Center —liighter, Rice, Degroot.
Quarters—Wilcox, R. Shlaudemann.
Halves —Campbell, Arnett, Mertz.
Full Backs —Woollomes, Patrick and
Sproul.
If the present fair weather continues
Saturday's game will give the coach
and football players a better line on
each other. Last week's contst was
a considerable set-back to the squad,
due to the impossibility of a good
showing on a wet field. Fair weather
will also give the Cardinal men a
better chance to down the Trojans.
In the game last season the Stanford
eleven was forced to meet the U. S. C.
players on a slippery field.
It is claimed that, the University of
Southern California team will not
match up to the last year's eleven.
A Cardinal victory should be in line.
Several of the varsity players are
suffering from minor injuries but none
arc sufficient to hold any of the men
out of the scrimmage. Captain Wil
cox, who was unable to start in the
game against the Olympic Club, will
start in play at his position at quarter.
Paul Campbell will start at left half,
while Bob Shlaudemann will probably
be selected to play the other half
position. The players to start at full
will be chosen from Woollomes, Pat
rick or Sproul. The only line po
sition that can be selected before the
starting line-up is definitely an
nounced, is Bob Pelouze at left end.
All of the other positions are still
doubtful.
