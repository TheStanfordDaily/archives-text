# "PIERRE OF THE PLAINS" WILL BE STAGED NOV. 5
## Sword and Sandals Decides on Richard Bennett's Star Hit; Best Campus Talent Tryout 
### 
â€ž "Pierre of The Plains" by Edgar
Selivyn, a powerful dramatic master
piece, padded with intense scenes and
thrilling climaxes, is the play to he
staged by Sword and Sandals on No
vember 5. This drama was chosen by
the society because of its marvelous
technique which is sure to please a cam
pus audience. Preliminary tryouts for
the cast were held yesterday and as a
result some "unknown" talent has come
to the front.
"Pierre of The Plains" has a past
history o fsuccess. Tt was staged by
Richard Bennett and packed a New
York theater every night during its long
extended run in that city a few yeari
ago. Bennett lias classed it as his
"favorite starring vehicle." The plot
is not extraordinaryly heavy, nor is it
exceedingly light. It is a type of pro
duction with which an organization such
as Sword and Sandals, should meet with
great success.
As a whole the play contains acting
of the best order, sustained acting, and
although it is not a tragedy it is very
gripping and intensely popular. The
scene is laid in western Canada, among
the Royal Canadian Mountain Police.
Scenic arrangements are pretentious and
will require off-campus aid to be staged.
Coach Gordon Davis would like for ail
campus people who have had exper
ience in carpentering, scene painting and
stage building to meet him in his officc
in the English Building.
