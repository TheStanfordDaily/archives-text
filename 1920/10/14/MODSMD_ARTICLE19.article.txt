entomological books and journals, began
a systematic course of exchanging re

journals with working entomologists ail
over the world and this system he has
maintained ever since. The result is a
collection of scientific contributions to
entomology by American and foreign
experts which it would be practically im
possible to duplicate at the present time.
Upon resigning from the Stanford
faculty Dr. Kellogg presented the Uni

eral entomological subjects but he has
for the time being retained ownership
in the section of the collection covering

filed in the entomology library under
classification headings which makes them
