# U. C. DECIDES ON ONE O'CLOCK DANCE RULE
## 
### 
Senior men and women of the Univer
sity of California went on record last
week as agreeing that the one o'clock
closing rule should hold good for all
college dances, whether on or off tin
campus.
The executive committee of the As
sociated Women Students recently
placed a more lax interpretation on the
resolution passed by the women a month
ago, when it declared that fraternal
organizations might dance later if they
pleased as long as sorority women were
home in hed hy 2 a. m.
One of the tw4 decisions will have
to be revoked, an<r it is the opinion of
tlic "Daily Californian" that the A. VV.
S. will give way.
