'Riety. Hefferman is a transfer from
Syracuse University, where his ability
is well known to his admirers. The
lime-light of Syracuse often has shown

some of the very latest of these. Heffer
man brings the reputation along will

customs.

Friday night. This will mean some new
surprises for his old spectators.

Jolly-up dances, the dance to follow
'Riety will comply with those regulations
and so offer plenty of opportunity for
the lone-wolves as well as those who
got their dates in time. "Stags" will be
charged fifty cents admission to the
dance, couples seventy-five cents. This
