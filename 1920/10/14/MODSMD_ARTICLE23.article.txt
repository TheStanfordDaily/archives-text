# Extension Granted For Paying Hall Room Rents
## 
### 
The closed date for paying room
rents in Sequoia and Encina halls has
been extended until next Wednesday,
it was announced today. University
regulation provides that on the tenth
day after registration the number of
beds in each room of the halls will
be made to correspond to the exact
number of rents that have been paid
in that room, and anyone not having
paid his rent or arranged for time
extension, will not be permitted to
occupy a room in the halls. It has
been found convenient to later this
regulation.
