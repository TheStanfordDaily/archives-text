# CARELESS FINANCE
## 
### 
gVERY year the banks and merchants of Palo Alto handle hundreds
of dollars' worth of bad checks written by Stanford students. They
are used to returning checks marked "not sufficient funds" and have come
to regard it as part of their business, and an inevitable part of the student
trade. This practice of careless finance places an extra cost on the banks
and merchants to handle the checks, and by the addition of losses suf
fered from totally worthless checks, the sum amounts up to a consid
erable figure at the end of the year.
The banks in Palo Alto have recently united to charge 50 cents a
month on all accounts that fall below $50 and thus protect themselves
to some extent by this method. The merchants have long had recourse
to the simple expedient of charging a little more for their goods, and
they are justified.
The responsibility rests upon the shoulders of those students who
think that attending a university allows them the speciaj privilege of
writing a check any time, whether they have money on deposit to cover
the sum or not. Their actions injure themselves in the end, and most
important, the innocent student bears the burden, also.
A little thought on the matter might make these students a bit
more careful with their signatures.
