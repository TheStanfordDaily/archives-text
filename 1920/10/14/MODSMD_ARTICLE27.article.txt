'JMie football Varsity received splendid support last night at the rally
from the enthusiastic "peeraders." and if the same amount of spirit is
manifested the remainder of the season, the Stanford rooting- section will
regain its former standard. The Varsity will not play again on the
campus until October 30, but in the meantime the same enthusiastic
rooters who attended the rally should bear in mind the fact that the fresh
man team plays Saturday, and it is in need of just as much support as the
Varsity.
