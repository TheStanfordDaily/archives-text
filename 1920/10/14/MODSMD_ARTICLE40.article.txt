Governor Cox)
Governor James M. Cox during his
western tour set a handshaking record
that few presidential candidates have
equalled.
It is estimated that 100,000 people
west of tiie Mississippi River can boast
that they have gripped the hand of the
Democratic candidate. The tour required
just a month, and those who were with
him feel certain that lie shook hands
with at least 3,000 daily.
Cox is an ambi-dexterous hand shake:
and has a good stiff grip in each hand
His system is to reach with his left hand
to grasp that of an admirer, while an
other friend is holding his rightâ€”a
movement that reminds one of the Aus
tralian crawl swimming stroke.
This, Cox explains, prevents the
crowds from wearing out one arm.
Throughout the tour lie invited hand
shaking. He is very active and said
that the handshaking afforded him sonic
exercise, after being shut up in his pri
vate car for hours.
Cox's western tour was one of the
most strenuous ever undertaken by a
Presidential candidate, and there are
many public men who could not have
stood the strain. But the governor came
out of it with a broad smile, despite
the fact that he was a tired man when
he arrived home. A tooth, broken off
on a plum seed, shortly before the trip
began, troubled him several times and
it was necessary for him to visit dentists
in between speeches.
The life.of a Presidential stump cam
paigner is a tireless one. Here is a
typical day:
The candidate's special train arrives
at the first stop about 7 o'clock, with
the candidate and most of those aboard
asleep. A steam whistle, built to be
heard for miles around, announced the
candidate's arrival with about five min
utes of screeching, while switch engines
join in the din by clanging their bells
merrily.
Then a band congregates just outside
the candidate's window and begins to
blare forth its customary overtures,
"The Stars and Stripes and Forever,"
and "Hail to the Chief." Although the
candidate is not due to speak until ten
o'clock, a local committee swarms on
the train seeking him, not realizing that
the day before he worked just double
the eight-hour limit.
After eating a hasty breakfast, tlu
candidate is whisked off for his first
speech and then back again to the train.
Local committees swarm through hir
car. and he is forced to lock himself
up in his compartment to take a few
glances at mail or telegrams or to pre
pare his speeches. And so it continues
until almost midnight. The candidate
apparently is considered a "super-man,"
who never finds it necessary to eat a
meal or sleep more than five or six
hours. And then he must try to sleep
as his train rushes on for another day
of tehe same "show."
Cox took the grind good-naturedly at
all times and refused to worry when his
friends told him a hard day was ahead.
"There is only one way to do and that
is to take things as they come," hs
said. "As soon as you start to worry,
you might as well quit."
