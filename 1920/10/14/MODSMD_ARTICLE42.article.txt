# SATURDAY'S GAME NOT TO DISHEARTEN ST. MARY'S VARSITY
## 
### 
St. Mary's College will continue
football despite the overwhelming de
feat of last Saturday. Yesterday Pete
Smith was named as one of the coach
es and with him the team will try
to reorganize. Many of the alumni
believe that the season should be
closed and that the schedule should
be cancelled. The student body, how
ever, seemed to take a different view
of the matter and it was announced
yesterday that they would go on with
the remaining games.
Coach Hollander raised the question
that he is under contract and this in
some manner must be settled. Hol
lander is now reporting daily at the
college in fulfillment of his contract.
He states that if the matter eventu
ally gets in the courts he will call on
Coach Andy Smith of California and
Coach Walter Powell of Stanford to
prove that he has a thorough knowl
edge of football. As yet no action has
been taken by Hollander.
