# FORTY SOCCER MEN REPORT FOR DUTY TO COACH MALONEY
## 
### 
More than forty men, comprising the
largest soccer squad that Coach Harry
Maloney has had, are out for practice.
So unwieldy has the big gathering prov
ed that Maloney found it necessary to
segregate the freshman squad and place
it under the supervision of Harvey New
lands, captain of the varsity squad. Tin
first year men, totaling fifteen or more,
work out on Tuesday, Thursday and
Friday.
Saturday afternoon, in San Francisco
Stanford will oppose the Chinese "Y"
of San Francisco in the opening match
of the College-Club League. Games will
be played thereafter every Saturday
afternoon, a portion of Stanford's con
tests taking place on the turf field.
The big game of the soccer schedule
will take place on the Berkeley field
against California on the morning of
the great American football finale. Cali
fornia, by defeating Stanford in a series
of games last year, won permanent pos
session of the Lathrop trophy which had
been the bone of contention for the past
live years. Maloney has secured a new
trophy, the name of the donor to be
announced shortly.
As to the prospects of conquest by the
varsity, Maloney expresses himself as
very enthusiastic. Tlie squad feels the
loss of Jim Quinby who last season
acted in the capacity of assistant to
Coach Maloney and who gave great
strength to the team as its center lialf
bick. Quinby has left school to practice
law. The varsity eleven remains virtu
ally intact from last year with Greene,
Strauss, Weller, McSkimming, Wing,
Clark, Robinson, Hayes,
Adams, Titus, Newlands and Matsers
forming the nucleus and a worthy bunch
of second string men clamoring for
places.
