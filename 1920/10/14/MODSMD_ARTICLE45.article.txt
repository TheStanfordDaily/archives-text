### United press 
CHICAGO, Oct. 14. â€”Twelve mea.
sentenced to die on the gallows be
ginning today, are to pay the penalty
for slaying their fellowmen. Convict
ed of murder, the men were to be exe
cuted in two batches, according the the
plans of Jailer George F. Lee. The
first batch of six were scheduled to
die on the gallows in the county jail
here tomorrow. The other six are to
be executed Thursday.
Never in the history of Chicago has
there been so many men hung at one
time. Lee declares that if the pro
gram is carried out, a new hanging
record will be established in Chicago,
noted for its murders.
All the men, with the exception of
one, are white. The exception is John
Henry Reese, a negro. The alleged
victims of the condemned men were
men wiMi a single exception.
Lee plans to take the men to their
death tryst two at a time. Both will
be stood up on the trap platform and
if too weak to stand will be placed in
chairs and shot through space. Lee
or one of his assistants will stand at
the back of the gallows and pull the
string which releases the trap and
shoots the men to their death. Ar
rangements are made for dropping
them 20 feet.
Ages of the convicted men range
from those of youths to men well on
in life. The youngest is Thomas Er
rico, 19. He was convicted with four
others of slaying several men. Er
rico and the othe- four were alleged to
have been members of what was
known as the "Apache Band."
9am Cardinelli, 52, is the oldest of
the prisoners sentenced to die. He is
credited with boing the "brains" of
the "Apache Gang." Three other
members of the "gang" are Joe Cos
tanzo, Antony Lopez and Sam Ferrara.
The others sentenced to hang are:
Richard Wilson, Harry Andra, Frank
Zager, Nick Viana, Frank Campione
and Arthur E. Hanschell.
Hanscheil is the only man accused
of killing a woman. He was convict
ed of slaying his wife, but has stead
fastly maintained his innocence. The
rope which was to have ended his
life has been ready twice but last
minute reprieves saved him.
The death watch was to be placed
over the condemned men this after
noon. Three guards were assigned to
each death chamber and the prisoners
were informed they could have a
choice of foods and as many cigars
and cigarettes as they cared to smoke.
Clergymen have spent considerable
time with several of the prisoners.
Afeeling of gloom wrapped the en
tire jail today. Prisoners awaiting
trial on charges of murder and other
crimes were silent and had little to
say as the day approached for the exe
cution of the firct two men.
The hangings were to be strictly
private. Jailer Lee announced that
only the regular officials of the court
and jail, and newspapermen would be
allowed to attend.
Lee, who has pulled the death trap
on several occasions, said he felt no
qualms about the scheduled proceed
ings.
"I hope they don't collapse," he
said. "I hate to see a man have to be
propped up to be killed. They are
like dish rags and their bodies flop.
Lee said he did not know whether
he would act as executioner. There
will be no secret, he said, as ta the
identity of the executioner.. He will
stand on the gallows in plain sight of
al lthe witnesses and pull the death
string. He will not be masked, Lee
said.
Cost of hanging, Lee said, has doub
led in the last few years. Ropes to
hang people, he declared, now cost
$10 apiece. In addition 75 cents is paid
to tie the knot which makes it certain
there will be no slipping in the rope
and cause the victim to fall to the
ground after going through all the
agony of being executed.
Lee disapproves of the way murder
ers are executed. He believes they
should be hung but that it should be
done within a few hours after they
are convicted.
"This thing of keeping them wait
ing months gets on their nerves and
a close watch has to be kept to pre
vent any attempt at suicide," said Lee.
