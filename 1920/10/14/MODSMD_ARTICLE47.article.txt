# RELIEF DEMANDED BY JAPAN'S PRICE SLUMP

TOKYO, Oct. 14.—While it is gen
erally expected that Japan's business,
which is still very much depressed,
will revive considerably with the be
ginning of next year, it seems that it
will be necessary to take far more
drastic steps to bring this "about.
Following the great drop of prices
which took place some months ago
and the great slump in the export
trade, a great congestion of goods has
occurred. This is seen very strikingly
in the large ports, such as Yokohama
and Kobe, where warehouses are now
crowded to the roofs with goods,
ordered during the boom, when every
importer figured that merchandise he
ordered would increase materially in
value while in transit. This had be
come so common that merchants had
come to look therupon almost as a
fixed law of trade. Consequently when
the slump in prices occurred, thou
sands and thousands of tons of goods
ordered mainly for speculation, arrived
and their prices on arrival being con
siderably lower than when they had
been ordered. The consequence was
that in many cases the consignees
refused to accept delivery, while in
others they were unable to secure the
necessary funds from the banks, as
these became extremely tight the mo
ment the bottom dropped out of the
market.
Some little relief has been obtained
in some cases by reshipment of re
cently imported goods to foreign
countries, and many a ton of merchan
dise made the trip back to America
after it had been landed on the docks
of Yokohama or Kobe. The ware
houses remain crowded, however, and
the existing glut becomes daily greater
as tne output of Japanese factories
continues to add thereto. To offset
this the leaders of many industries
have restrained their production by
operating only part time or by clos
ing altogether. Thus the cotton mills
run only sixty per cent capacity.
The one step which seems obviously
necessary .namely, to get rid of the
glut by selling the accumulated goods
at lower prices, even at a loss if
necessary, is the one step which the
business community will not take, and
in this attitude it is upheld by the
Government, which has advanced tre
mendous sums to this and that in
dustry for the purpose of keeping up
the utterly abnormal situation. While
this may postpone the day of reckon
ing, it will, of course, be impossible
for the Government to advance funds
forever, and the only real effect will
be to make it take just so much
longer for business to get back to a
sound basis. In the mean time con
cern after concern is going under,
some of them large ones. The Gov

which is still very much depressed,
will revive considerably with the be
ginning of next year, it seems that it
will be necessary to take far more
drastic steps to bring this "about.
Following the great drop of prices
which took place some months ago
and the great slump in the export
trade, a great congestion of goods has
occurred. This is seen very strikingly
in the large ports, such as Yokohama
and Kobe, where warehouses are now
crowded to the roofs with goods,
ordered during the boom, when every
importer figured that merchandise he
ordered would increase materially in
value while in transit. This had be
come so common that merchants had
come to look therupon almost as a
fixed law of trade. Consequently when
the slump in prices occurred, thou
sands and thousands of tons of goods
ordered mainly for speculation, arrived
and their prices on arrival being con
siderably lower than when they had
been ordered. The consequence was
that in many cases the consignees
refused to accept delivery, while in
others they were unable to secure the
necessary funds from the banks, as
these became extremely tight the mo
ment the bottom dropped out of the
market.
Some little relief has been obtained
in some cases by reshipment of re
cently imported goods to foreign
countries, and many a ton of merchan
dise made the trip back to America
after it had been landed on the docks
of Yokohama or Kobe. The ware
houses remain crowded, however, and
the existing glut becomes daily greater
as tne output of Japanese factories
continues to add thereto. To offset
this the leaders of many industries
have restrained their production by
operating only part time or by clos
ing altogether. Thus the cotton mills
run only sixty per cent capacity.
The one step which seems obviously
necessary .namely, to get rid of the
glut by selling the accumulated goods
at lower prices, even at a loss if
necessary, is the one step which the
business community will not take, and
in this attitude it is upheld by the
Government, which has advanced tre
mendous sums to this and that in
dustry for the purpose of keeping up
the utterly abnormal situation. While
this may postpone the day of reckon
ing, it will, of course, be impossible
for the Government to advance funds
forever, and the only real effect will
be to make it take just so much
longer for business to get back to a
sound basis. In the mean time con
