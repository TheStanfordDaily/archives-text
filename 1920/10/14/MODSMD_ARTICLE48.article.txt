BERLIN, Oct. 14.â€”Despite the
slumping tendency in German industry
at this time, it is remarkable that
some important branches are showing
signs of great improvement.
Connections between shipyards and
coal and iron works are being made
In increasing numbers. The ship
yards are making feverish efforts to
renew Germany's commerce fleet.
Such reconstruction is given an im
petus by the recent agreements be
tween the Hamburg-Amerika line and
the American Ship and Commerce cor
poration, and between the Nordeutch
er Lloyd line and the U. S. Mail steam
ship company. Admiral Benson of the
U. S. shipping board has described
these agreements as strictly business
deals which will help put the Amer
ican shipping business on a strong
footing.
Here in Germany, one regards them
as affording a field for activity for the
old German companies and a starting
point for a quicker rebuilding of the
German fleet than one could have ex
pected under the Versailles treaty
conditions.
The German realizes that the Amer
ican agreement is not made out of
friendship for Germany, and he feels
that there is in it a clever move to
assure America's standing on the seas
as against English competition. And,
England manifestly is viewing the ar
rangement with the angry feelings of
the "Zuspaetgekommenen" (the too
late arrived) and, it is possible that
England will strive, perhaps success
fully, to make other connections with
Germany for a co-operation in the
shipping line.
