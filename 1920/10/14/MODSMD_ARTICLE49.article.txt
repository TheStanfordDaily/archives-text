### United Press 
LONDON. Oct. 14.—Miners union ex
evcutives decided that the nation wide
coal strike will begin Saturday. Herbert
Smith, vice-president of the Miners Fed
eration, decclared that the government
missed its chance to avert the strike
when it refused the wage increase of
two shillings a day. "There is a bitter
feeling among the men and if a fight
comes only starvation will defeat them,"
asserted Smith.
ness. i r ; doing what it can to encourage
various combinations for restraint of
competition and upholding of prices,
with the result that the general public
sees little benefit from the slump in
prices.
As a direct consequence of the stag
nation in export and import business,
shipping is suffering. During the war,
when freight rates soared, Japan built
hundreds of tons of shipping, but her
great merchant fleet is beginning to
become a white elephant on her hands.
Freight rates have gone down to rock
bottom, and charters with them. An
ever inccreasing number of vessels
are being laid up.
A)' these conditions have not failed
to have their effect on the labor mar
ket, as many workers have been dis
charged altogether, including many
seamen, while others work only part
time. In the same way the middle
class is being seriously affected, as
many of the largest corporations are
discharging employees, mainly in the
clerical positions, by the hundreds.
The losses caused by the slump have
been very largely "book" losses, as
Japan still lias her goods, her factories
and her ships, as well as the great
asset consisting in her industrious and,
compared to America and Europe, vir
tually strike-free population. She
must, however, train this laboring
population to become far more effect
ive, if she is to keep up successfully
in the world competition. Further
more, she must improve the quality
of her goods, abandon shady business
methods and extend considerable cred
its on her sales such as other coun
tries do, but which she has hereto
fore declined to do.
