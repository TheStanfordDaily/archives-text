# Physical Education Organization Explained
## 
### 
The new organization of the Physi
cal Education Department was today
explained by Dr. Browne.
Under the system now in effct, ath
letic directors assume positions form
erly occupied by coaches. All posi
tions in the department are under the
supervision of faculty authorities.
Such a system was inaugurated to do
away with the suggestion of profes
sionalism in college athletics.
Beginning at the top of the list Dr.
Browne, as director of the department
of physical education, is in charge of
administration, acts as Men's Medical
Advisor and is chairman of the Facul
ty Athletic Committee.
H. W. Maloney, Associate Director
of the Major Sports, acts as assist
ant to Powell in football and has base
ball and golf in charge.
c. S. Botsford, Director of Intra
mural Athletics, serves as instructor
in gymnastics, tennis and handball.
Tlie sports for which directors and
assistants in instruction have not yet
been provided are not in season this
quarter. They will be listed at a
later date.
