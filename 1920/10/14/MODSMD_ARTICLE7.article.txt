Four now men, all transfers from
varsity debating teams of other uni

at the first try-outs held by the so

prominent law school debater in U.
S. C.; H. Alexander, '22, varsity de

after the next meeting.
Freshmen are especially urged to
tryout next Wednesday night. Those
wishing to become members of Eu
phronia must tryout at two or more
meetings before, action can be taken
on admitting them, and for that rea
son the time for trying out has been
extended. The topic for discussion
at the next meeting, which will be
held in Room 12 of the Law Building
next Wednesday night, will bo "The
Japanese Question and Its Remedy."
It is hoped that a la/ge number of
underclassmen will show up and help
further Stanford's debating prospects.
