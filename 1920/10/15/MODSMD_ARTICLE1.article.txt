# STRONGEST MEN TO BOCK U.S.C. IS COACH'S PLAN
## Nineteen Players Leave to Battle With Trojan 'Grids'; No Definite Line-up Given 
### 
Coach Powell will match his strong
est combination against the University
of Southern California varsity eleven
tomorrow afternoon, when the Cardinal
squad will run out on the Los Angeles
field to do battle with the Trojans. The
Stanford team will not go into the game
overconfident, according to the an
nouncement made by Powell before leav
inglast night, but will start play fully
expectant of a Cardinal victory and will
light until the final whistle blows to
blot out last year's defeat.
Nineteen players left .last night to
compose the squad that will go up
against the southern college team. They
are: Captain Wilcox, R. Schlaudeman,
Campbell, Arnett, Mertz, Sproull, Pat
rick, Woolomes, Pelouze, Adams, K.
Schlaudeman, Pershing, McAlpine
Helser, Deems, Levy, Cravens, DeGroot,
and Rice.
Although the definite lineup could not
lie announced by the coach last nrght
several of the starting players are as
sured of their positions. Captain "Art"
Wilcox is certain of starting the play at
quarter. Paul Campbell will play the
position of left half back, while Bo.b
Schlaudeman will probably fill the other
half, with Mertz and Arnett in reserve.
Woollomes or Sproull will start the play
at full, while Patrick will probably get
itno play during the latter part of the
game. Patrick has only been out for
two afternoon's of practice and has
barely had time to get the signals well
in mind.
The positions in the line are more
doubtful than the backtield. Pelouze is
certain to start in at left end while the
coach may use either K. Schlaudeman
or Adams at the other end of the line
The tackle positions will lie between
Pershing, Helser, and McAlpine. while
the guards will be selected from Deems.
Cravens and Levy. DeGroot or Rice
will start tomorrow's game at center.
Results of the game will be wired to
the Daily Palo Alto by Yell leader
Kinney who went south to lead the
alumni rooting section. The bulletin will
be posted on the Union building immed
iately following the game.
