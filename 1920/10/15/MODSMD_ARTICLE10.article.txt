# UNIQUE PROGRAM TO BE SHOWN BY NEW DRAMATISTS
## Tickets on Sale Tonight in Box Office at 7:00 For Corda Fratres Initial Show 
### 
Innovation and variety will be injected
into Stanford dramatics by the produc
tion tonight in the Assembly Hall of
"On'n Off Campus' Riety." A distinctive
vaudeville programme at the popular
prices of fifty and seventy-five cents a
seat, is the aim of the Corda Fratrcs,
in varying from the standard of the
usual campus play. Entirely disregard
ing precedent, tonight's show will at
tempt something unique in Stanford
productions by drawing upon ol'f-campus
entertainers. Former Orpheum and
Pantages players from San Francisco
and Los Angeles will be featured on the
bill as well as the famous eight-piece
Kamaina Band from Honolulu.
Another innovation is the importation
of an orchestra for an informal dance.
The native Hawaiians, of the Kamaina
Band, who are temporarily in California
on a tour of the United States, will
furnish the jazz for the aftershow hop
in the Women's Clubhouse. The dance
will be in the nature of a jolly-up and
will last until one o'clock. A charge of
fifty cents will be made for "stags" and
seventy-live cents for a couple.
Les Seib will without doubt be the
star of the evening, playing in the skit
entitled, "Vodka, Vimmen, and Voice."
A "suprisski" is awaiting those who will
hear the act, even for those who are
familiar with Seib's work. The decided
hit which Seib made in the Ram's Head
play of 1919 by singing "Red Russian
Rose" and the "Land of True Romance"
in the Junior Opera last spring has led
to repeated calls for their resinging
Seil) promises that the two hits will be
repeated on tonight's program.

The Stanford Chapter of the Corda
Fratres has been unusually ambitious in
attempting tonight's production. Ray
Ground, '20, president of the club and
manager of the entertainment, has beet
successful, however, in securing dramatic
talent for the show and with the
cooperation of Gordan Davis and Lestei
Seib will undoubtedly make the lirsi
dramatic hit of year in "On'n Off
Campus 'Riety."
