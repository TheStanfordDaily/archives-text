PORTLAND, Ore., Oct. 15.—Miss
Aileen Joyce, who was graduated from
Bethany Colleye, Topeka, Kansas, a
year ago, is the new girl in the Lyric
theatre chorus here —the fourth from
the left.
Miss Joyce tried teaching school for
a year, but she had to walk a mile to
her school in a rural district of Kan
sas, found the work hard and the
salary meager.
Besides, she didn't have any "fun"
while teaching young America read
in', 'ritin', and 'ritlimetic. So, while
visiting relatives here this summer,
she found the opportunity of getting
into the chorus at the local theatre —
and took it. And she's glad she did.
"Teaching school, especially in the
country, in a poor life and a hard one,"
said Miss Joyce. "The stage is hard
work, but it offers one a chance of
advancement, and a better living. It
gives a girl a bit of amusement and
a touch of adventure. There's a cer
tain lure about the footlights that the
class room will never possess.
"I suppose all the girls in the so
rority house where I lived while at
Bethany would be shocked if they
knew i was. out here in the west,
dancing bfore a crowd of perfect
strangers in a chorus girl's costume.
But, anyway, it's a better life than
teaching."
