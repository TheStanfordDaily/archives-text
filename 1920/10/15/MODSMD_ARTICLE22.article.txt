MEDFORD, Ore., Oct. 15.—A. M.
Arthurs, 81, thought he had worked
long enough, a year ago, so he retired.
But Arthurs found, after a year of
"loafing" here that leading an inactive
life was the hardest work he had ever
done. So he purchased his former
property near this city and will soon
be pounding his old anvil again.
Arthurs had been a blacksmith since
: he was lf> years old, and is still hale
and hearty.
