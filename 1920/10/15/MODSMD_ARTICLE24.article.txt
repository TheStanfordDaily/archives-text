# DISCUSSION GROUPS START IN MEMORIAL CHURCH ON SUNDAY
## 
### 
Discussion groups for both freshmen
and ttpperclassmen will be inaugurated
in the Memorial Church next Sunday
at ten o'clock, lasting until 10:45.
Prominent upperclassmen will have
charge of the freshman groups and Pro
fessor R. E. Trotter will lead the dis
cussion in the "graduate" section.
Last year these groups were very
popular and meetings were held once a
week in every living group on the cam
pus. However it was felt that these
interfered with studies and would be
more attractive to students if held Sun
day morning before service.
World problems, and the religious and
ethical questions which arise from
everyday college life will be discussed,
and both freshmen and upperclassmen
arc urged to come to the Chapel next
Sunday for the morning service.
