# A 						SIGNIFICANT STATEMENT
## 
### 
â€¢yHE Republican position in respect to the League of Nations is made
much clearer by the statement issued today by thirty-one prominent
members of the party. They state that "the question of the campaign
is not whether our country shall join in such an association. It is
whether we shall join under an agreement containing the exact provi
sion negotiated by President Wilson at Paris, or under an agreement
which omits or modifies some of those provisions which are very objec
tionable to great numbers of the American people."
If this is the position of the Republican party, we will have the
League of Nations, minus some of the objectionable provisions, if Hard
ing is elected. The entire ground covered in the Peace Conference will
not have to be gone over again, which affords considerable relief to many
ardent League supporters.
The fact is worth noting that the statement takes pains to make it
clear that the question is not about the principle of a league 1 of nations,
but it is about the method of effectively applying that principle to pre
serve peace.
It is significant that such prominent Americans as Taft, Root,
Hoover, and the other men who signed the statement regard the change
of party so necessary that they have adopted this means to put Senator
Harding and the party irrevocably on record as favoring a league.
