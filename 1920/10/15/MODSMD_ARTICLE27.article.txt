# ACQUATIC SCHEDULE IS ANNOUNCED FOR YEAR
## 
### 
Swimming sports start next Thursday
on the heaviest year they have so far
had. Coach Ernest Brandsten has ar
ranged a schedule whereby the teams,
both varsity and freshmen will make
several trips oil the campus and the
varsity will go to the south for an ex
tended tour of Los Angeles and San
Diego county aquatic clubs. The inter
class meet is primarily for the purpose
of developing undiscovered talent in the
swimming and diving line and "Erny" is
confident that new material will show
up on Thursday to give the regulars a
run for their money. The old men of
last year's squad are practically all back
with the addition of the last year's fresh
man squad to their ranks.
The first meet with outsiders is with
Lowell High School of San Francisco.
The mermen from the city school are
always good and are bragging that this
year they are going better than ever.
