The Daily Palo Alto presents below

members who haz'e given the present

"You ask me why I shall vote for Cox
and I am glad of the opportunity to
tell you. In a presidential campaign art
many issues. One would be glad if he
could vote on them separately. But he
cannot do this. He must sacrifice some
ideals that others may be attained. A
voter must select the object of para
mount importance and act as though .1
stood alone.
"The greatest enterprise in which the
American peopel have engaged in two
generations was the conduct of a war
against Germany. No man can claim
that this great task is finished until a
treaty of peace has been made. The
form of treaty to which we and our
associates early subscribed advocated a
new feature, a League of Nations, de
signed to prevent another world catas
trophe. When this plan was stated ii.
detail over a year ago the vast majoriLy
of the American public approved of it
tvith great enthusiasm. This majortiy
was indicated by all the coming ages
of public opinion, by the record of in
fluential newspapers and by the utter
ances of distinguished men of lxv.h
parties on whose judgment we are ac
customed to rely. In favor of the Lea
gue of Nations was Root, Taft, Hughes,
Hoover, not to mention eminent Demo
crats. Against the League of Nations
was Reed of Missouri, Thompson of
Chicago and William Randolph Hearst,
men with whom good citizens are
ashamed to agree. This is a fair state
ment of the facts as they appeared be
fore the attempt to make a national party
issue of this greatest of all international
questions.
"The first proposals for amendment to
the League were accepted by the Pres
ident and Peace Conference and incor
porated in the document. If the Pres
ident doubted their sincerity he gave
objectors advantage of doubt.
"Since the Republican party of oppo
sition could gain nothing by these ob
jections they proposed more radical
changes which the leaders knew could
not be accepted. By this act they creat
ed the issue which they sought. If the
President had accepted these changes
who can doubt that this would have been
forthcoming indefinitely.
"The Republican leaders in the Senate
determined the issue of this campaign.
The League of Nations as it has been
constituted is the only issue of any im
portance. The Democrats accepted the
challenge their opponents presented an I
their position is clear; The position of
the Republicans is equally clear. It is
determined by their platform, the words
of their candidate and the attitude of
their accepted leaders in the Senate.
They have joined hands with Hearst
and the German American Alliance as
German language papers testify and pro
pose to put over their candidate and put
back the patronage lost eight years ago
even though by so doing they make this
country a "welcher" among the nations.
"The most effective means has been
to cloud the vision of the voter by
magnifying matters which might some
times be important but which are at
this crisis utterly beneath consideration.
This is not the "time to worry over the
awful mistakes of Woodrow Wilson oi

vague aspersions on the private charact
ers of president and candidate or to
entertain the suggestion that the Demo
crats cannot he trusted to run the gov
ernment.
"Since a political victory may not be
won by negation alone the Republican
candidate has proposed a positive pro
gram of reform. The absurdity of this
program only testifies to the bankruptcy
of his case. He will propose an associa
tion of nations instead of the League
but does not tell us what nations will
be in it nor how he will induce them to
enter. He proposes a reduction of taxes
but does not tell how the public debts
are to be paid without taxes. He will
raise the value of Liberty bonds but docs
not mention that this can only be done
by more taxes and an open market buy
ing of bonds by the Treasury.
"1 shall vote for Cox, not because 1
am a Democrat, but because the party
he represents is pledged to an accept
ance of the League of Nations and be
cause that is the next rational step in
the quest of disarmament and enduring
p6ace. I believe that until this step is
taken there is no important issue before
the country.

Political Science Department
Governor Cox should be elected Pres
ident because:—
1. Of his firm stand for the League
of Nations principle which is the real
embodiment of the sentiments for which
our sons and brothers fought and died.
2. His administrations in Ohio have
been of the most progressive type. Din
ing the last two years he has been
opposed by a Republican legislature yet
has forced through constructive meas
ures against its political opposition.
3. He is for the upholding and exten
sion of the great progressive federal
legislation of the last seven years. He
stands for the retention of the Federal
Reserve Bank system, the Farm loan
banks, and the conservation of our na
tural resources, national parks, and
water rights as a heritage of and for
the use of the people and not particular
corporations.
4. His personality is of the clearcu\
straight-forward type with no vacillation
of thought or word.
5. He stands for a government of
laws and not of men. This principle is
best shown in his career as Governor
and his methods as a presidential can
didate.
6. He can show an unbroken record
of initiative, activity and constructive
accomplishment.
I oppose Senator Harding because: —
1. He is opposed to the League of
Nations.
2. As a senator from Ohio he has
missed nearly 1200 roll and quorum calls
in less than six years. He has been one
of the most insignificant members of
the Senate.
3. He has opposed woman suffrage,
prohibition, conservation, labor, taxation
of profiteering and of large incomes. He
has supported "pork" appropriations
even during the war, conscription as a
permanent policy, League of Nations
with reservations (until recently), secret
sessions of the Senate, etc.
4. His personality impresses one as
pleasing and friendly. His speeches arc
always worded in the most hesitating,
meaningless, diffuse, and balanced
phrases and entirely lacking in construct
iveness.
5. He has stood with the "Old Guard"
politically and economically and been
regular on every issue until politically
expedient to change his attitude.
6. His public career is absolutely color
less, illogical, inconsistent and with a
most reactionary point of view.

5. He stands for a government of

6. He can show an unbroken record
of initiative, activity and constructive

I oppose Senator Harding because: —
1. He is opposed to the League of
Nations.
2. As a senator from Ohio he has
missed nearly 1200 roll and quorum calls
in less than six years. He has been one
of the most insignificant members of
the Senate.
3. He has opposed woman suffrage,
prohibition, conservation, labor, taxation
of profiteering and of large incomes. He
has supported "pork" appropriations
even during the war, conscription as a
permanent policy, League of Nations
with reservations (until recently), secret
sessions of the Senate, etc.
4. His personality impresses one as
pleasing and friendly. His speeches arc
always worded in the most hesitating,
meaningless, diffuse, and balanced
phrases and entirely lacking in construct
iveness.
5. He has stood with the "Old Guard"
politically and economically and been
regular on every issue until politically
expedient to change his attitude.
6. His public career is absolutely color
less, illogical, inconsistent and with a
most reactionary point of view.

"You ask me why I shall vote for Cox
and I am glad of the opportunity to
tell you. In a presidential campaign art
many issues. One would be glad if he
could vote on them separately. But he
cannot do this. He must sacrifice some
ideals that others may be attained. A
voter must select the object of para
mount importance and act as though .1

"The greatest enterprise in which the
American peopel have engaged in two
generations was the conduct of a war
against Germany. No man can claim
that this great task is finished until a
treaty of peace has been made. The
form of treaty to which we and our
associates early subscribed advocated a
new feature, a League of Nations, de
signed to prevent another world catas
trophe. When this plan was stated ii.
detail over a year ago the vast majoriLy
of the American public approved of it
tvith great enthusiasm. This majortiy
was indicated by all the coming ages
of public opinion, by the record of in
fluential newspapers and by the utter
ances of distinguished men of lxv.h
parties on whose judgment we are ac
customed to rely. In favor of the Lea
gue of Nations was Root, Taft, Hughes,
Hoover, not to mention eminent Demo
crats. Against the League of Nations
was Reed of Missouri, Thompson of
Chicago and William Randolph Hearst,
men with whom good citizens are
ashamed to agree. This is a fair state
ment of the facts as they appeared be
fore the attempt to make a national party
issue of this greatest of all international
questions.
"The first proposals for amendment to
the League were accepted by the Pres
ident and Peace Conference and incor
porated in the document. If the Pres
ident doubted their sincerity he gave
objectors advantage of doubt.
"Since the Republican party of oppo
sition could gain nothing by these ob
jections they proposed more radical
changes which the leaders knew could
not be accepted. By this act they creat
ed the issue which they sought. If the
President had accepted these changes
who can doubt that this would have been
forthcoming indefinitely.
"The Republican leaders in the Senate
determined the issue of this campaign.
The League of Nations as it has been
constituted is the only issue of any im
portance. The Democrats accepted the
challenge their opponents presented an I
their position is clear; The position of
the Republicans is equally clear. It is
determined by their platform, the words
of their candidate and the attitude of
their accepted leaders in the Senate.
They have joined hands with Hearst
and the German American Alliance as
German language papers testify and pro
pose to put over their candidate and put
back the patronage lost eight years ago
even though by so doing they make this
country a "welcher" among the nations.
"The most effective means has been
to cloud the vision of the voter by
magnifying matters which might some
times be important but which are at
this crisis utterly beneath consideration.
This is not the "time to worry over the
awful mistakes of Woodrow Wilson oi

vague aspersions on the private charact
ers of president and candidate or to
entertain the suggestion that the Demo
crats cannot he trusted to run the gov
ernment.
"Since a political victory may not be
won by negation alone the Republican
candidate has proposed a positive pro
gram of reform. The absurdity of this
program only testifies to the bankruptcy
of his case. He will propose an associa
tion of nations instead of the League
but does not tell us what nations will
be in it nor how he will induce them to
enter. He proposes a reduction of taxes
but does not tell how the public debts
are to be paid without taxes. He will
raise the value of Liberty bonds but docs
not mention that this can only be done
by more taxes and an open market buy
ing of bonds by the Treasury.
"1 shall vote for Cox, not because 1
am a Democrat, but because the party
he represents is pledged to an accept
ance of the League of Nations and be
cause that is the next rational step in
the quest of disarmament and enduring
p6ace. I believe that until this step is
taken there is no important issue before
the country.

Governor Cox should be elected Pres

1. Of his firm stand for the League
of Nations principle which is the real

our sons and brothers fought and died.

been of the most progressive type. Din

opposed by a Republican legislature yet
has forced through constructive meas

3. He is for the upholding and exten

gram of reform. The absurdity of this
program only testifies to the bankruptcy
of his case. He will propose an associa
tion of nations instead of the League
but does not tell us what nations will
be in it nor how he will induce them to
enter. He proposes a reduction of taxes
but does not tell how the public debts
are to be paid without taxes. He will
raise the value of Liberty bonds but docs
not mention that this can only be done
by more taxes and an open market buy

Governor Cox should be elected Pres
ident because:—
1. Of his firm stand for the League
of Nations principle which is the real
embodiment of the sentiments for which
our sons and brothers fought and died.
2. His administrations in Ohio have
been of the most progressive type. Din
ing the last two years he has been
opposed by a Republican legislature yet
has forced through constructive meas
ures against its political opposition.
3. He is for the upholding and exten
sion of the great progressive federal
legislation of the last seven years. He
stands for the retention of the Federal
Reserve Bank system, the Farm loan
banks, and the conservation of our na
tural resources, national parks, and
water rights as a heritage of and for
the use of the people and not particular
corporations.
4. His personality is of the clearcu\
straight-forward type with no vacillation
of thought or word.
5. He stands for a government of
laws and not of men. This principle is
best shown in his career as Governor
and his methods as a presidential can
didate.
6. He can show an unbroken record
of initiative, activity and constructive
accomplishment.
I oppose Senator Harding because: —
1. He is opposed to the League of
Nations.
2. As a senator from Ohio he has
missed nearly 1200 roll and quorum calls
in less than six years. He has been one
of the most insignificant members of
the Senate.
3. He has opposed woman suffrage,
prohibition, conservation, labor, taxation
of profiteering and of large incomes. He
has supported "pork" appropriations
even during the war, conscription as a
permanent policy, League of Nations
with reservations (until recently), secret
sessions of the Senate, etc.
4. His personality impresses one as
pleasing and friendly. His speeches arc
always worded in the most hesitating,
meaningless, diffuse, and balanced
phrases and entirely lacking in construct
iveness.
5. He has stood with the "Old Guard"
politically and economically and been
regular on every issue until politically
expedient to change his attitude.
6. His public career is absolutely color
less, illogical, inconsistent and with a
most reactionary point of view.

"You ask me why I shall vote for Cox
and I am glad of the opportunity to
tell you. In a presidential campaign art
many issues. One would be glad if he
could vote on them separately. But he
cannot do this. He must sacrifice some
ideals that others may be attained. A
voter must select the object of para
mount importance and act as though .1
stood alone.
"The greatest enterprise in which the
American peopel have engaged in two
generations was the conduct of a war
against Germany. No man can claim
that this great task is finished until a
treaty of peace has been made. The
form of treaty to which we and our
associates early subscribed advocated a
new feature, a League of Nations, de
signed to prevent another world catas
trophe. When this plan was stated ii.
detail over a year ago the vast majoriLy
of the American public approved of it
tvith great enthusiasm. This majortiy
was indicated by all the coming ages
of public opinion, by the record of in
fluential newspapers and by the utter
ances of distinguished men of lxv.h
parties on whose judgment we are ac
customed to rely. In favor of the Lea
gue of Nations was Root, Taft, Hughes,
Hoover, not to mention eminent Demo
crats. Against the League of Nations
was Reed of Missouri, Thompson of
Chicago and William Randolph Hearst,
men with whom good citizens are
ashamed to agree. This is a fair state
ment of the facts as they appeared be
fore the attempt to make a national party
issue of this greatest of all international
questions.
"The first proposals for amendment to
the League were accepted by the Pres
ident and Peace Conference and incor
porated in the document. If the Pres
ident doubted their sincerity he gave
objectors advantage of doubt.
"Since the Republican party of oppo
sition could gain nothing by these ob
jections they proposed more radical
changes which the leaders knew could
not be accepted. By this act they creat
ed the issue which they sought. If the
President had accepted these changes
who can doubt that this would have been
forthcoming indefinitely.
"The Republican leaders in the Senate
determined the issue of this campaign.
The League of Nations as it has been
constituted is the only issue of any im
portance. The Democrats accepted the
challenge their opponents presented an I
their position is clear; The position of
the Republicans is equally clear. It is
determined by their platform, the words
of their candidate and the attitude of
their accepted leaders in the Senate.
They have joined hands with Hearst
and the German American Alliance as
German language papers testify and pro
pose to put over their candidate and put
back the patronage lost eight years ago
even though by so doing they make this
country a "welcher" among the nations.
"The most effective means has been
to cloud the vision of the voter by
magnifying matters which might some
times be important but which are at
this crisis utterly beneath consideration.
This is not the "time to worry over the
awful mistakes of Woodrow Wilson oi

vague aspersions on the private charact
ers of president and candidate or to
entertain the suggestion that the Demo
crats cannot he trusted to run the gov
