NEW YORK, Oct. 15—The right of
Pete Herman, Johnny Kilbane, Benny
Leonard and Johnny Wilson to their
championship crowns may be disputed,
but Tex Rickard, New York promoter,
is willing to concede them all as the
best champions the world has ever
seen —at "ducking bouts."
Rickard, who, as the manager of
Madison Square garden, has become
the foremost of American promoters,
has found it almost impossible to in
duce any of the champions outside of
Jack Dempsey, the heavyweight king,
to get in the ring for a decision bout.
"We expected to have some real
fights in New York under the new
boxing bill, but the champions have
suddenly become deaf," he said.
"I have written numerous letters to
Johnny Kilbane and he has ignored
them. T even went so far as to let
him pick his own opponent. 1 have
tried to get in touch personally with
Johnny Wilson and have sent repre
sentatives to him only to have them
told that he is not ready to talk bu i
ness. I had Benny Leonard and Eddie
Fitzsimmons matched and the bout
was called off. Pete Herman has been
very slow in agreeing to meet the win
ner of the elimination series that is
being conducted among the bantams."
Rickard, however, plans to force
them into the ring. He has two plans
in mind—one through the provisions
of the Walker Bill and the other by
taking the radical stand that they are
no longer champions and offering a
club belt of his own to the winner of
an elimination scries among the con
tenders.
The Walker Bill is very clear on this
subject.
"Any boxer winning a championship
under the International Rules must
defend his title in a bona fide bout
to a decision against the best available
contender within a period of six
months from the time of winning his
title and thereafter every six months
