# U. C. Sophomores Erect Big "C" Rival On Hill
## 
### 
Sophomore students of the Uni
versity of Califronia climbed Charter
Hill Tuesday and erected a huge No.
12 above the Big "C". For the first
time sine its construction in March
1905, the Big "C" lost its supreme
right to be sole rules of the campus
hillside.
This is the first time that anything
but the Big "C" has borne the right
to hillside illumination and the first
time that a lighted symbol on Charter
Hill has not required a bodyguard
of students to ward of Cardinal as
sailants. For in the campaign for
Amendment 12 Stanford University
is giving a hearty co-operation to her
Blue and Gold rivals.
The Big "C" will come into its
own again after the election day on
November 2 when the University
hopes to see Amendment 12 adopted
by the people of the State. Mean
while, however, the huge number 12
will hold sway and throughout the
days and night until November 2 will
send out a continual appeal to the
votrs of California for their Univer
sity.
if a qualified challenger appears, un
less he is prevented by circumstances
beyond his control, in which case the
time may be extended by the board
of boxing control," the section reads.
Rlckard has already offered a belt
to (he winner of the return engage
ment between Jack Sharkey and Joe
Lynch, who fought a furious fifteen
round draw recently and are matched
to meet again on November sth in
Madison Square garden.
Rickard also promises to make some
interesting disclosures about the
weight of several champions who are
in a class heavier than their title.
While some excellent bouts have
been staged under the New York laws
and while there is little doubt that
the future will see many just as good,
it is a fact that the champions will
have to be coaxed a great deal to
step into a ring, with their crown
at stake on a decision since they can
go across the river in New Jersey
and fight a twelve-round no-decision
fight and get almost as much money.
