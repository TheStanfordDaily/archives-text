# PRESIDENT WILBUR PLEDGES SUPPORT OF SENATOR HARDING
## Party Leaders Elated Over 'International Cooperation' For Peace the Promotion 
### 
President Wilbur was today an
nounced as being one of thirty-one
prominent American who have just
announced their unqualified support
of Senator Harding for President on
the Republican ticket, and their ac
ceptance of his principles as outlined
in his speeches recently. These men
have particularly endorsed Harding's
stand on the League of Nations, de
claring it the safe and sane policy
to take at this time.
A statement of the reasons why
these men have pledged their support
follows:
The paper signed by thirty-eign Re
publican Senators in March, 1919, be
fore the league covenant was adopted
at Paris, advised the President that
the signers could not approve a treaty
in the- form then proposed, although
it was 'their sincere desire that the
nations of the world should unite to
promote peace and general disarma
ment.'
A majority of the Senate voted to
ratify the league agreement with modi
fications, which there is good evidence
to show have been accepted by the
other nations. But Wilson refused to
accept these modifications, and insist
ed upon the agreement absolutely un
changed and Democratic Senators suf
ficient in number to defeat the treaty
us modified followed Wilson by vot
ing against the ratification.
That is substantially the difference
between the parties now. The Demo
cratic platform and candidate stand
unqualified for the agreement negoti
ated at Paris, without substant J ve
modification.
On the other hand the Republican
platform says: "The Republican party
stands for agreement among the na
tions to preserve the peace of the
world. We believe that such an inter
national association must be based
upon international justice and must
provide methods which shall main
tain the rule of public right by the
development of law, and the decision
of impartial courts; and which shall
secure instant and general internation
al conference whenever peace shall be
threatened by political action so that
the nations pledged to do and insist
upon what is just, and fair may exer
cise their influence and power for the
prevention of war."
The question between the candidates
is not whether our country shall join
in such an association. It is whether
we shall join under an agreement con
taining the exact provision negotiated
by President Wilson at Paris, or under
an agreement which omits or modi
fies some of those provisions which
are very objectionable to great num
bers of the American people.
We have reached the conclusion that
the true course to bring America into
an effective league to preserve peace
is not by insisting with Cox upon the
acceptance of such a provision as
Article 10, thus prolonging the un
fortunate situation created by Wil
son's insistence upon that article; but
by frankly calling upon the other na
tions to agree to changes in the pro
posed agreement which will obviate
this vital objection and other objec
tions less the subject of dispute.

between the parties now. The Demo
cratic platform and candidate stand
unqualified for the agreement negoti
ated at Paris, without substant J ve
modification.
On the other hand the Republican
platform says: "The Republican party
stands for agreement among the na
tions to preserve the peace of the
world. We believe that such an inter
national association must be based
upon international justice and must
provide methods which shall main
tain the rule of public right by the
development of law, and the decision
of impartial courts; and which shall
secure instant and general internation
al conference whenever peace shall be
threatened by political action so that
the nations pledged to do and insist
upon what is just, and fair may exer
cise their influence and power for the
prevention of war."
The question between the candidates
is not whether our country shall join
in such an association. It is whether
we shall join under an agreement con
taining the exact provision negotiated
by President Wilson at Paris, or under
an agreement which omits or modi
fies some of those provisions which
are very objectionable to great num
bers of the American people.
We have reached the conclusion that
the true course to bring America into
an effective league to preserve peace
is not by insisting with Cox upon the
acceptance of such a provision as
Article 10, thus prolonging the un
fortunate situation created by Wil
son's insistence upon that article; but
by frankly calling upon the other na
tions to agree to changes in the pro
posed agreement which will obviate
this vital objection and other objec
tions less the subject of dispute.
President Wilbur was today an
nounced as being one of thirty-one
prominent American who have just
announced their unqualified support
of Senator Harding for President on
the Republican ticket, and their ac
ceptance of his principles as outlined
in his speeches recently. These men
have particularly endorsed Harding's
stand on the League of Nations, de
claring it the safe and sane policy
to take at this time.
A statement of the reasons why
these men have pledged their support
follows:
The paper signed by thirty-eign Re
publican Senators in March, 1919, be
fore the league covenant was adopted
at Paris, advised the President that
the signers could not approve a treaty
in the- form then proposed, although
it was 'their sincere desire that the
nations of the world should unite to
promote peace and general disarma
ment.'
A majority of the Senate voted to
ratify the league agreement with modi
fications, which there is good evidence
to show have been accepted by the
other nations. But Wilson refused to
accept these modifications, and insist
ed upon the agreement absolutely un
changed and Democratic Senators suf
ficient in number to defeat the treaty
us modified followed Wilson by vot
ing against the ratification.
That is substantially the difference
between the parties now. The Demo
cratic platform and candidate stand
unqualified for the agreement negoti
ated at Paris, without substant J ve
modification.
On the other hand the Republican
platform says: "The Republican party
stands for agreement among the na
