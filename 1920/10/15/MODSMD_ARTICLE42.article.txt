## 
### 
All students will have the oppor
tunity of learning to play chess from
experienced players on Thursday, Octo
ber 21st, in the Woman's Clubhouse.
1 he Chess Club will conduct a class in
the fundamentals of chess in order
that students may understand and tak
an interest in the game.
The Chess Club is one of the oldest
organizations at Stanford. Its purpose
is to develop players to form a team
which will defeat the University of Cali
fornia team in the annual tournament.
In past years Stanford has won a
majority of chess tournaments played
with U. C. owing to the training and
practice which the players receive as
members of the Chess Club.
, Chess is the oldest game known t
man. Its origin can be traced as far
back as the ancient Hindus. It is a
game exciting and interesting which,
when once born can not die. The most
commendable feature of the game is
its exercise of the intellect. Jt is a
game that lends opportunity for thought
which is unequalled in any otjier game.
The methods of playing it are so varied
and numerous that it is impossible to
compute them. College professors, stu
dents, old and young, may derive learn
ing and enjoymetn from Chess.
President A. V. Mueller is arranging
a series of tournaments between the
Chess Club and organizations of the
faculty, the residents of Palo Alto, and
with various universities. If you want
to learn how to play the game be sure
to attend the class to be conducted next
Thursday, at 7 :30 p. m.
For this course we can look only to
the Republican party and its candi
dates; the Democratic party and Mr.
Cox are bound not to follow it. The
Republican party is bound by every
consideration of good faith to pursue
such a course until the declared object
is attained.
The conditions of Europe make it
essential that the stabilizing effect of
the treaty already made between the
European powers shall not be lost by
them and that the necessary changes
be made by changing the terms of
that treaty rather than by beginning
entirely anew.
That course Harding is willing to
follow, for he said in his speech of
AuguA 28:
"I would take and combine all that
is good and excise all that is bad from
both organizations (the court and the
league). This statement is broad en
ough to include the suggestion that
if the league, which has heretofore ri
veted our consideration and apprehen
sion has been so entwined and inter
woven into the peace of Europe that
its good must be preserved in order to
stabilize the peace of this continent,
then it can be amended or revised so
that we may still have a remnant of
the world's aspirations in 1918, built
into the world's highest conception of
helpful co-operation in the ultimate
realization."
We therefore believe that we can
most effectively advance the cause of
international co-operation to promote
peace by supporting Mr. Harding for
election to the Presidency.
