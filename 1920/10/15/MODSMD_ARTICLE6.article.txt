# DR. JORDAN WILL NOT MAKE SCIENTIFIC TRIP
## 
### 
An erroneous report published in the
San Francisco newspapers a few days
ago that David Starr Jordan would be
one of a party of American scientists
to explore the Amazon Basin next year
was personally denied this morning by
the Chancellor.
"1 was asked to join the group which
will leave New York next January,"
stated Dr. Jordan, "but, of course it
would be unthinkable for a man of my
advanced age to make the trip with its
dangers of diseases and accidents. I
made a similar tour through the tropics
twenty years ago and I hardly care to
repeat the experience now. I admit,
however, that if 1 were younger the
offer would tempt me very much."
The invitation to join the party was
extended by Dr. H. H. Rushy of Col
umbia University, expleained Dr. Jordan,
who referred him to a former associate,
Professor Carl H. Eigenmann of the
University of Indiana. Following the
advise of the Chancellor, Dr. Eigenmann
was invited to head the group which will
study Brazillian fishes and reptiles. "I
expect very valuable investigations to be
conducted by the scientists," predicted
Dr. Jordan, "who thoroughly know their
buiness and who will go to Brazil to
secure results."
