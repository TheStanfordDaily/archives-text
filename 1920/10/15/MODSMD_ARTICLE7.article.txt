# NOVEMBER PICTORIAL DISCUSSES WOMEN'S SMOKING PROBLEM
## 
### 
"Where There Is So Much Smoke" is
the title of an article by Florence Hock
ing, '22, which will appear in the Novem
ber issue of the Stanford "Pictorial."
The editorial staff and the photograph
ers of the magazine have been busy
rounding up the material for this issue
which will make its appearance early
next month.
Miss Hocking's article takes up the
much mooted question of whether a
college woman has the right to smoke
and discusses at length the various pro
hibitions put 011 the practice by the
different colleges of the country, in
cluding those of Stanford. A few years
ago a controversy over the relations be
tween the women at Vasser and nicotine
attracted the attention of the entire
country. "Where There Is So Much
Smoke," by taking the bull by the
horns, as it were, is an article that
hopes to forestall any similar occurence
at Stanford.
"Woman, Woman!" by Marion Kyle.
'18, is an article that takes up the
cudgels for the male sex in the "great
sex war" that was stirred up by an
article entitled "Co-edphobia" in the
last issue of the "Pictorial." Kyle's
article features his style of humorous
irony and is one that will attract much
interest 011 its publication.
