# FUMBLES PERMIT HANS TO DOWN CARDINAL ELEVEN
## Injuries to Art Wilcox May Keep Cardinal Captain Out of Game For Rest of Season 
### 
Fumbling cost Stanford the game
against U. S. C.'s eleven at Los Angeles
Saturday, the score being 10-0. The
southern team made its first touchdown
early in the lirst quarter, when Johnny
Leadingham, Trojan fullback, plunged
over the line.
The Cardinals were unable to get
under way until the third quarter, and
then lost the ball each time they were
within striking distance of the U. S. C.
line.
Stanford won the toss, and Evans,
Trojan tackle, kicked over the goal line.
The ball was scrimmaged on the 20
yard line. Bob Schlauderman broke'
through left tackle for a fourteen yard
run. It was at this stage of the game
that Stanford made its lirst bobble, and
recovered the ball* a few minutes later,
only to lost it again on another fumble.
Leadingham punted to Stanford's live
yard line. Wilcox punted out thirty
yards, and Leadingham made fifteen
yards on an end run. He followed this
with a buck that netted live yards. Dean
was stopped in his tracks, but on the
next play, a split buck, Leadingham
crashed through Craven's guard for ten
yards and a touchdown. Evans kicked
the goal.
The Trojans kicked off, and recovered
the ball on Stanford's twenty-live yard
line, when the Cardinals fumbled. On
the next play, Evans scored a field goal,
which ended the scoring for the game.
During the last two periods Stanford
played a better game, with fewer fumbles
and making downs many times, which it
had been unable to do earlier in the
game.
Art Wilcox, Stanford quarter back
and captain, received injuries to his
shoulder, which it is feared may keep
him out of the game for the remainder
of the season.
