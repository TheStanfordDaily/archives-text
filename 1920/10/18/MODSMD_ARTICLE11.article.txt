# Wilson Becomes Uneasy At Hardiness Speeches
## 
### United Press 
WASHINGTON. Oct. 18.—President
Wilson today in a letter asked Senatoi
Harding if he said in his Indiana speech
Saturday that he had been "informally
approached" by a spokesman of France
who asked that America lead the way
in forming an Association of Nations.
Wilson said "grave and extraordinary
inferences may be drawn from such a
statement, namely: that the government
of France which is a member of the
League of Nations approached private
citizens of a nation which was not a
member, with a request "that the United
States lead the way to a world fratern
ity." I hesitate to draw this inference
unless assured by you, that you actually
made the statement. It was intimated
that if Harding replied, another letter
might be forthcoming,
MARION, Ohio, Oct. 18. —After read
ing copies of the president's letter,
Senator Harding announced that he
would make a statement tonight.
