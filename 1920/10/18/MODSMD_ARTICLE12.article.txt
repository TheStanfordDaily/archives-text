# FRESHMEN TEAM SUFFERS DEFEAT TO DAVIS FARM
## Visiting Gridiron Warriors Prove Too Strong For the Stanford First-Year Men 
### 
Coach Duffy Seay's Freshman team
was unable to take the measure of the
University Farm eleven on the local
gridiron Saturday afternoon but they
gave the men from Davis a hard battle
before losing by the score of 13 to/.
The Babes threw several scares into
the Davis contingent. Davis scored a
touchdown ten minutes after the game
started but failed to convert. The
Freshmen responded in the second quar
ter by shoving the ball down the lield
with a series of forward passes and line
bucks to a touchdown which they con
verted. The score at the end of the
first half was Stanford Freshmen 7,
Davis 6.
Beginning the second half the men
from Davis bucked through until they
were in the shadow of the Stanford
goal. The '24 men held them for downs
on the one yard line and it appeared as
if the danger had been averted. They
lost the ball on the first play of their
push out of danger. A. Carter recovered
the fumble and crossed the line for the
second Aggie score. Pogue kicked the
goal.
A. Carter, the Davis full back, played
the best game for the visitors. His two
touchdowns bordered on the sensational.
Davis palyed straight football, making
but one attempt at a forward pass and
that one was unsuccessful. The Babes
while fairly successful with their bucks
resorted to open field work at intervals
and especially during the last ten min
utes in an effort to put over the winning
touchdown. Four long passes were at-
tempted in the middle of the field and
any one of them if completed would
have spelled finis for tlie farmers, he
cause in each instance the man on the
receiving end was in the clear. Fumbles
in each case spoiled the chances of the
Babes to tie or win the game.

that one was unsuccessful. The Babes
while fairly successful with their bucks
resorted to open field work at intervals
and especially during the last ten min
utes in an effort to put over the winning
touchdown. Four long passes were at-
tempted in the middle of the field and
any one of them if completed would
have spelled finis for tlie farmers, he
cause in each instance the man on the
receiving end was in the clear. Fumbles
in each case spoiled the chances of the
Babes to tie or win the game.

Coach Duffy Seay's Freshman team
was unable to take the measure of the
University Farm eleven on the local
gridiron Saturday afternoon but they
gave the men from Davis a hard battle
before losing by the score of 13 to/.
The Babes threw several scares into
the Davis contingent. Davis scored a
touchdown ten minutes after the game
started but failed to convert. The
Freshmen responded in the second quar
ter by shoving the ball down the lield
with a series of forward passes and line
bucks to a touchdown which they con
verted. The score at the end of the
first half was Stanford Freshmen 7,
Davis 6.
Beginning the second half the men
from Davis bucked through until they
were in the shadow of the Stanford
goal. The '24 men held them for downs
on the one yard line and it appeared as
if the danger had been averted. They
lost the ball on the first play of their
push out of danger. A. Carter recovered
the fumble and crossed the line for the
second Aggie score. Pogue kicked the
goal.
A. Carter, the Davis full back, played
the best game for the visitors. His two
touchdowns bordered on the sensational.
Davis palyed straight football, making
but one attempt at a forward pass and
that one was unsuccessful. The Babes
while fairly successful with their bucks
resorted to open field work at intervals
and especially during the last ten min
utes in an effort to put over the winning
touchdown. Four long passes were at-
tempted in the middle of the field and
any one of them if completed would
have spelled finis for tlie farmers, he
cause in each instance the man on the
receiving end was in the clear. Fumbles
in each case spoiled the chances of the
Babes to tie or win the game.
