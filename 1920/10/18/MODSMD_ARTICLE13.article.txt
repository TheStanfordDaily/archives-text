# CORDA FRATRES ENTERTAIN WITH VARIED PROGRAM
## Valjean, Jack Hefferman and Hawaiian Orchestra. Draw Applause From Audience

"On-n Off Campus 'Riety" played
Friday evening in the Assembly Hall,
by the Corda Fratres, has led the way
for the production of a new type in
campus dramatics. Unique in assembl
ing a variety of vaudeville talent, the
program was well balanced in its ap
peal.
The Corda Fratres was possibly too
ambitious in attempting a vaudeville
this early in the year. Stanford audi
ences, accustomed to the finish of pro
fessional vaudeville of San Francisco,
are not easily satisfied by amateur pro
duction. The "Riety," with notable
exceptions, was amateurish in its
cast, and awkward delays in shifting
scenes deepened the impression that
the players lacked the certainty which
thorough rehearsing gives.
Nelson Valjean, '24, made his entree
into campus dramatics in a feature act,
entitled, "Out of the Darkness." The
naturalness of Valjean on the stage
marks him as a player who will take
a prominent part in future Stanford
plays.
Never disappointing to campus audi
ences, Lester Seib sang several songs
in "Vodka, Vimmen and Voice" which
won approval. The work of Seib was
obviously extempore and was slightly
below the professional finish which
has marked his previous performances.
"Ziegfeld Jazz," played and sung by
Jack Hefferman, a recent transfer
from Syracuse University, introduced
a new player of ability to Stanford.
Equally pleasing was the rendering of
the "Dance de Pierrot" by Virginia
Lowers. The dance was performed
with a grace worthy of an experienced
stage dancer.
The professional touch was main
tained by the Hawaiian Orchestra
through all their appearances. Corda
Fratres is to be congratulated on se
curing the band, whose Hawaiian
music was decidedly refreshing. The
innovating of string music for the
after show hop was appreciated by
those who are wearied by the jazz
of the usual dance orchestra.
The Oriental costuming of the Chi
nese players would have been a dis
tinct improvement in "Melodies of
New China." In Frank Bowers, the
boy cartoonist, the "Riety" secured an
artist of unusual ability. The omis
sions of a few of his cartoons, however
would probably have improved an act
which was admittedly good, despite
its length.*
