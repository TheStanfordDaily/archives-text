# SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA MAY GIVE CONCERTS DURING COMING YEAR
## 
### 
Plans arc underway to have the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra give a
short series of concerts on the campus.
Several conferences have been held late
ly between representatives of the various
campus musical organizations. As a
result of these conferences a meeting
was held last Friday night at which a
committee was chosen to prepare final
arrangements.
Heretofore the San Francisco Symph
ony Orchestra has given one concert
each year on the campus under the
auspices of the Peninsula Musical As
sociation. Miss Alice Kimbal, secretary
of the association has promised its help
in arranging the proposed series of con
certs.
Present plans call for at least two
concerts. In these two concerts Warren
I). Allen director of the Glee Club is
proposing to Conductor Alfred Hertz
that the club be used in place of the
usual soloists. There is also some talk
of using the Glee Club in one con
cert and the Schubert Club in the other.
These concerts will be the great mu
sical events of the year. The price of
seats will be as reasonable as possible in
order to enable the students to hear the
Symphony Orchestra. Dates for the
concerts will be announced soon.
The committee chosen to make the ar
rangements is: Professor Durand, Pro
fessor Bassett, Professor Whitaker,
Mrs. Clifford Allen, Mr. Warren D,
Allen, and Dr. Gardner. Professor Du
rand was chosen as chairman
