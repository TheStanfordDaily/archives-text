other types of dramatics. The tryouts
I trough t to the front much unknown
talent which Davis expects to utilize in
other plays this year.

the biggest campus successes."

ruled with emotional stirring qualities.
Its clever plot works to intense comf>W

that time Davis expects to have every
member thoroughly trained.
