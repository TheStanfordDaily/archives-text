# SANTA CLARA GAME
## 
### 
|MIE entire Stanford student body should join in the pilgrimage to
Santa Clara Saturday to support the Varsity in one of its hardest con
tests of the season. It will be the big game of the season for Santa
Clara, and much of the old-time Stanford-Santa Clara rivalry will be in
evidence as a reminder of the time when the two institutions played
rugby and met iu the Big Game.
