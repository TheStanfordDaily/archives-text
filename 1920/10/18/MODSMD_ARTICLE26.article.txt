# BEHIND THE VARSITY
## 
### 
WITH two straight defeats registered against the Varsity, it is time
for the "croakers" to commence their customary pessimistic talk.
Some of this element have already lost their courage and are willing to
place their money against Stanford for the balance of the season. It is
admitted that the University of California has a strong team this year,
but it is not a superhuman eleven, as "Brick" ]\Borse would have us
believe. The California men have played exceptional football thus far,
and the Stanford eleven has not excited the Coast with brilliant playing.
But on the other hand, the Cardinal eleven has played a steady, hard
game and has never been outclassed. The Cardinals have not
led the top of their form yet, and there is no cause for the "croak
to become frightened.
With the vast majority of the student Ixxly, The Daily Palo Alto
lias absolute faith in the .Stanford Varsity, in Coach Powell, and in the
ever-present Stanford Spirit to win the Big Game.
