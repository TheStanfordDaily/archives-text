### United Press 
LONDON, Oct. 18. —Lloyd George
lived up to liis reputation as a "Welsh
wizard" when he returned from Lu
cerne.
He managed lo smuggle home with
him as far as No. 10 Downing Street
a dog—not a "pom" or a "peke," but
a St. Bernard, standing about three
feet high.
Despite the regulations governing
the matter of bringing a dag into
the country, Lloyd George somehow
managed to fool them all until he had
got his new pet ensconced in a com
fortable armshair before the domestic
hearth.
Then came the moment of reckon
ing. The Board of Agriculture took
the dog away, declaring it must spend
the usual six months in quarantine
and follow all the laws laid down for
any John Smith's dog. Whereupon
Lloyd George bid his canine friend
an affectionate "an revoir" and settled
himself down to being a law-abiding
citizen.
The British Premier is a dog-lover.
He used to have a little black pug
named "Zulu" and he still has a Welsh
terrier "Cymro." The newcomer is
a St. Bernard about eight months old,
and was purchased from a shepherd in
the Rhone Valley. At a station Cap

tain Guest saw the dog and called
Lloyd George's attention to it. In
a few minutes the owner was pre
sented to the Premier and the St.
Bernard sat up and offered a paw.
The premies immediately made the
shepherd an offer. The bargain was
closed.
And now both master and dag are
waiting patipntly for the six months
quarantine to expire.
