PARIS, Oct. 18.—Should there be
another big war in the near future
Argentine, Brazil and Chile would be
in a position to give more help to
countries such as the United States
and England than France, as regards
the power of her naval artillery.
This is the essence of an article in
"Le Temps," which gives at length
actual figures about the Brazilian,
Argentine and Chilean warships. It
says:
"Before the era of the dreadnought,
the South American republics had war
navies adapted to the importance of
their part in the world. Then the
European navies had guns much bigger
than the biggest South American guns,
which rendered the latter relatively
powerless. But the dreadnought came.
Argentine, Chile and Brazil understood
that they must not build fighting ships
beaten in advance and ordered abroad
dreadnoughts able to accept a fight
with any similar ship existing.
"The change was complete. In 1914
the three South American republics
had a fleet, including seven warships
comparable to those of the European
fleets. This fleet was equal to the
present French fleet, if not superior,
because the Chilean dreadnought car
ried 356 millimeter guns superior to
the French 340 millimeter. Further,
the South American dreadnoughts
would have been a very real help to
the American fleet if difficulties had
arisen with Europe.
"The question of the warship can
only have one solution; that it be
at least equal, possibly superior to the
ships she may have to meet. The
importance of the country to which
she may belong does not matter any
longer—the enemy alone does. And
yet, in France, we have not reached
the point where stood the South Amer
ican republics before 1914. We
adopted the same caliber for heavy
artillery on our dreadnoughts several
years after them, and when England
decided to replace her 305 by the 343,
we timidly made our 340 'millimeter,
while Chile chose 356. Our 340's were
not yet in use when England had the
381; Japan and the United States pos
sessed the 356, and were on the way
t<> 406 and 467."
The article terminates by urging
I that every effort be made in Franco
to reach a point where her navy is
able to'bring any valuable help to the
Allies. It warns France that she must
not lose her rank in the world
