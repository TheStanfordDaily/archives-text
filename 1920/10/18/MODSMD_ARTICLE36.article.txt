Editor, Daily Palo Alto:
It woul dseem desirable in view of
the straw ballot you have announced
to have in mind a brief summary of
Mr. Harding's position. Some of it is
too vague to be expressed briefly (or
indeed otherwise), but the following
items are I think unquestioned:
1. He is in favor of a separate peace
with Germany. He has said he will
sign a bill to this end just as soon
as it can be presented to him by a
Republican Congress.
2. He is opposed to the present
League of Nations either with or with
out reservations. He takes this posi
tion unequivocably.
3. He favors the formation of a new
association of nations which, to use
liis own words, will "tend to prevent
war." He proposes in other words to
go to the forty-one nations who are
members of the present League and
ask llicni to disband it, ("scrap" it, as
Senator Johnson puts it), and join
in a new organization madf 1 to suit
American interests, which, Mr. Hard
ing assures us. "are not and never will
be" the interests of Europe. This re
quest to the forty-one nations to sac
rifice their own interests for the bene
fit of America involves such matters
as the calling of a new Peace Con
ference, the requiring of the existing
treaties, and the resettlement of
Europe.
4. Mr. Harding advocates a high pro
tective tariff.
I do not wish to discuss Mr. Hard
ing's program, but I venture to call
attention to a part of it at least, in
this summarized form.
J. ELMORE.
P.-S.: —The foregoing was written
before I had seen the remarkable state
ment signed by President Lowell,
Elihu Root and others which appear
ed in this morning's papers. Mr.
Harding in his Des Moines speech
explicitly rejected the present League;
it is on this understanding that he
is receiving the support of Mr. John
son and Mr. Borah. Now come Presi
dent Lowell, Mr. Root and the other
asking the people to support Mr. Hard
ing on the ground that he favors the
present League with the omossion of
Article X. and other minor changes.
Thus the battle for Mr. Harding's soul
goes on. The question is, will it be
worth having when once it is won.
