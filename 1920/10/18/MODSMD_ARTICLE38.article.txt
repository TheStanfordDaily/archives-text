# BERKELEY CUBS ARE STRONG OPPONENTS FOR VARSITY TEAM
## 
### 
The U. C. football Cubs are the
strongest opponents the California var
sity has battled, with the exception
of the Olympic Club. In practice
games the frosh make down consist
ently against the varsity, both by
straight line-plunging and open play.
The Babes have a well-developed in
terference and show up well in run
ning back punts and with the forward
pass.
The Mar*- Island Marines again went
down to defeat at the hands of a Blue
and Gold eleven, the California fresh
men beating them 14-3. The Sea-Sold
iers were handed an 88-0 lacing two
weeks ago by the California Varsity.
The California lineup: Hufford, 1 e;
Baird, 1 t ; Hoidt, 1 g; Powers, c; Nick
elman, r g; Newmeyer, r t; O'Brien, r
e; Robinson, q; Nichols, 1 h; Witter,
f; Dunn, r h.
