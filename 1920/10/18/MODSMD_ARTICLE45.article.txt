# STANFORD SOCCERITES TRAMPLE ON CHINESE Y. M. C. A. SATURDAY
## 
### 
The Stanford Soccer team defeated
the Chinese Y. M. C. A. Saturday at the
San Francisco Stadium by a score of
1 to 0. Ihe Chinese played a strong
defensive game, and a high wind spoiled
many shots for Stanford. The first half
ended with the score 0-0. Three min
utes before the end of the last half,
Shrauss scored the only goal of the
game for Stanford. Except for erratic
shooting the Stanford forwards played
a good game. The individual stars of
the game were Pon Lee for the "Y"
and Wilier for Stanford. Harry Mo
loney refereed. The game was the first
in the University-Club League. The
Chinese will probably play a return
game at Stanford later in the season.
