# Crime in Columbus Shows Steady Increase

COLUMBIjS, Ohio, Oct. 18â€”Despite
the fact that Columbus is supposed to
be "bone dry," intoxicating beverages
seem to be flowing freely in the city,
if the number of drunk cases disposed
of in police court during September
can be taken as an indication.
This facf is partly to blame, police
say, for a genoral increase of about
30 per cent in crime in Columbus.
Statistics show that during the year
the increase in crime has mounted
steadily. According to the report
compiled by Harold C. Gackenbach,
chief clerk for the criminal division
of municipal court, 560 cases of all
character were disposed of during the
month, 208 of which were for drun
kenness.
This represents an increase of about
4GO per cent over the same month in
1910 when there were only 50 drunks
arrested. In 191S, with the saloons
wide open, 311 cases were tried.
The report also shows that gambling
is on the increase.
Although the country seems to be
enjoying the greatest prosperity in
its history, police court records show
that vagrancy is on the increase.
In September last year there were
only 25 arrested for vagrancy, against
53 this year, or an increase of more
than 100 per cent.
