# Philadelphia Machine Coals Ship In Half Hour

### United Press 
PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 18. —Foreign 1
ocean-going vessels are taking ad- i
vantage of the automatic coal load- ■
ing machine which has been installed
at the Greenwich Point piers here. The j
system is borrowed from the plan in
U3e on the Great Lakes, where iron
ore is handled and shipped quickly
and cheaply. By this method of coal- j
ing an ordinary sea-going craft can
be coaled in less than half an hour,
where it formerly took several days.
Fifty railroad tracks, forming a net
work and capable of holding 1,000 cars
of coal, are built around the machine.
The cars, specially constructed wait
on the siding until a vessel is ready
to coal. Each car passes through a
concrete, steam heated thawing shed
which is used for thawing coal in the
winter. Released from the thawing
shed, the cars glide down a slight in
cliin? and up another where they are
clamped to the rails. A huge plat
form, resembling an elevator, auto
matically places itself into a position
of an acute angle. The coal is per
mitted to run from the car, onto the
platform and into a Y-shaped bowl
which connects it with a chute from
the hold of the ship.
The dumper was built at a cost of
approximately $. r >ooi,ooo and is the only
one in this, section of the United
States. Foreign vessels alone spend
$1,000,000 monthly for coaling sup
plies here. Last month broke all pre
vious records when 306,700 tons of
coal was loaded on ocean-going crafts.
