# DR. JORDAN UNABLE TO JUSTIFY "THIRTY ONE"
## Chancellor Considers Stand of Harding Opposite to the Pro-League Republicans 
### 
"I can not understand how a pro-
League Republican can vote for Harding
and expect hi into pursue a diametric
ally opposite course from his recent
stand on the League after November 2,"
declared David Starr Jordan in an inter
view today with a representative of the
Daily Palo Alto.
"How, then, do you explain the sup
port of Harding by Herbert Hoover?"
the Chancellor was asked.
"While it can be understood, I do not
believe that it can be justified 011 the
ground that Harding will uphold the
League after his election. The recent
interview of Hoover I consider to be
the best statement of the campaign and
1 endorse it with the exception of the
last clause which urges the election of
Harding for the reasons previously out
lined by Hoover. The last clause is a
non-sequetor. No connection exists be
tween the Hoover statement and the
position Harding has actually assumed
on the League."
"Disregarding the campaign issues,
how do you view the two candidates
personally?" was asked of Dr. Jordan.
"As someone remarked," he replied,
"it is a case of Debs versus Dubbs. Be
tween the two latter, there is little
choice in ability. Probably Cox is the
abler man, but he has shown no keen
insight into present day conditions. The
first speeches of Harding gave him away
completely, although his later utter
ances, edited by friends, are passable.
Even Cox stood" in a better light before
he began active campaigning. To the
Republican charge that Cax will follow
the Wilson conception of the Presidency
as a 'one man' government it can be
replied that the election of Harding will
result in a 'no man' government. An
accurate summary is to say that Hard
ing has no ideas, Cox no ideals."
Dr. Jordan expressed the view that
the Republican contention that Wilson
is a vital issue of the campaign is
untenable. Cox must be judged upon
his merits alone, he asserted, and not by
the eccentricities of the President. As
the San Francisco convention turned
down Woodrow Wilson and nomirfateu
Cox because he was not connected
politically with the President it is absurd
to treat the Cox candidacy as synonym
ous with the Wilson position.
"Personally, I believe that there is 110
poin to be gained in' this year s election
except to portest against some body or
some condition," concluded the Chancel
lor. "My vote will be solely a vote of
protest, and 1 will reserve my decision
until immediately before election.'
