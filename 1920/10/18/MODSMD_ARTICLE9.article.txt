## Prominent Suffrage Worker Speaks at Cox-Roosevelt Meeting Tomorrow Night 
### 
Miss Francis Jolliffe, prominent San
Francisco woman, will be the principal
speaker at the Stanford Cox-Roosevelt
Club's League of Nations mass meeting
in the Women's Clubhouse at 8 o'clock
tomorrow night.
Miss Jolliffe was active in the suffrage
movement in California. In 1915 with
Sara Bard Field, she took a petition to
Washington bearing the signatures of
thousands of California women for the
suffrage amendment. Miss Jolliffe has
been in the campaign for the. League of
Nations for some time and is said to
give a very clear presentation of it.
She will be the guest of Roble Club
at dinner tomorrow night.
J. W. Cline, president of the Univer
sity of California student body, will
send a U. C. student to the meeting to
speak in favor of amendment twelve,
which provides additional funds for the
state university.
Another talk on the League of Nations
will be given by a member of the Uni
versity of California Cox-Roosevelt
Club. This organization has been one
of the most active clubs in the Cox-
Roosevelt campaign and has sent speak
ers on the League into every town in
this part of the state.
F. E. Supple. '17, president of the
Stanford Cox-Roosevelt Club, today
urged that everybody interested in the
League of Nations attend the meeting
as it is to be a non-partisan affair.
The mass meeting will be on the eve
of the Presidential straw vote which
the Daily Palo Alto will hold Wednes
day in cooperating with the two local
political clubs. Arrangements have been
completed for the vote. There will be
three polling places. They will be locat
ed at engineering corner, the law steps,
and English steps.
Campus supporters of both Harding
and Cox are anxious that every student
avail himself of the privilege of voting
as the result of this vote will be used
as campaign material by the political
clubs.
Headquarters were opened in the
Union today by the Cox-Roosevelt Club.
The office will be open daily and all
those interested are urged to procure
buttons and literature there. The Stan
ford Republican Club has had head
quarters in the Union for the past two
weeks.
