# FIRST BLEACHER RALLY TO BE HELD TOMORROW, 4:30
## Lively Scrimmage Promised For Rootersâ€”Yell Leader to Prepare for Santa Clara 
### 
Yell leader Kinney announces the first
bleacher rally of the year tomorrow
afternoon at 4:30 sharp. Both men and
women are invited to come out and
watch the Varsity in informal exhibi
tion. The event will be known as the
Santa Clara Rally, and is largely to pre
pare the bleachers for the game Satur
day 011 Mission field.
The game Saturday is the great con
test of the year for the Santa Clara
eleven, and it will probably be one of
the hardest for the Varsity, according to
many sport writers who arc picking
Santa Clara to win.
A special train will take Stanford
rooters to the new Santa Clara field.
Much publicity will be given the game,
according to Kinney, and much will de
pend on the showing of the Cardinal
rooting section, and the yell leader is
anxious to have the best turnout pos
sible.
The bleacher rally tomorrow will af
ford the only opportunity for Stanford
rooters to get into trim for Saturday's
game.
Coach Powell promises a lively scrim
mage for the benefit of the bleacher
occupants.
Assistant yell leaders Connolly and
Seib will be on hand with some new
stunts, it is rumored.
