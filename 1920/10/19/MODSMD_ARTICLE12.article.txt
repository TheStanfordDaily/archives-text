# RIOTING BREAKS IN BRITAIN'S BIG MINING CENTERS
## Shop Windows Stoned and Mob Sings The Red Flag'; Damage is Done to Region 
### United Press 
LONDON, Oct. 19.—William Bract,
Labor member of Parliament, opened
way to renewed negotiations in the na
tion-wide British coal strike in a speech
to parliament in which he suggested a
new plan of settling the controversy.
He proposed that the miners be given
an increase of two shillings a day until
January first.
LONDON, Oct. 19.—First strike dis
turbances in the coal region were re
ported from the Tondu and Pandu min
ing centers in Wales where large bodies
of miners gathered singing "The Red
Flag." Shop windows were stoned. The
mobs later dispersed of their own ac
cord.
With winter staring them in the face
hunger and want are today beating at
the doors of the British People. The
strike of the coal miners has paralized
the coal dealers, and the unemployed arc
walking the streets of London with the
fires of unrest and revolution burning
in their souls. The Transport Workers
Union is meeting today to decide
whether they join the coal miners in
their strike and whether the country will

Fuel and food restrictions have been
again imposed and the nation is almost
back on a war basis of supplies. The
unemployed are increasing in numbers
by the hour and with the curtailing of
the coal supply more and more workers
will be thrown out of the large factories
and steel mills at Manchester and Birm
ingham, many other factories dependent
upon these will be forced to close if the
great distributing centers shut down.
The whole trouble between the work
ers and operators is the question of a
two shilling rise in wage. This is about
forty-live American cents. Lloyd George
is the man to whom both sides look for
the settlement of the strikes and result
ing conflict. The radical labor party de
clares that Lloyd George lias brought
about the strike to take the attention of
the people off the Irish question. Lloyd
George in turn blames Sir Robert Home
for the disturbances. Sir Robert has
had no experience in labor matters and
as president of the board of trade is
claimed to have brought on the crisis
which exists at the present.
