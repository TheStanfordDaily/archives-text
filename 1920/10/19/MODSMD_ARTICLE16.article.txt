# PLAY CALLS FOR DIFFICULT SCENE
## Pretentious Settings Must Be Solved in Presentation of "Pierre of the Plains ' 
### 
"Pierre of the Plains" has its setting
in the Canadian Northwest. The scenic
arrangement is one of the most compli
cated problems to be met with in produc
ing this play. All scenery must be built
and painted. The effect of barren north
western country must be portrayed by
special lighting.. The entire setting is
wonderful and unique when compared
with any other play ever produced on
the campus.
The most pretentious scene comes in
the third act. This is the time when the
villain and hero meet, the unraveling of
complications, the fight, and the relaxing
of suspense. Here a skyline must be
shown, hills and paths running off into
the background of the picture must be
made in miniture on the stage. Dim
lighting in teh foreground and a dull
grey sky in the distance is a problem
which must be worked out by those
handling the scenic arrangement.
"Pierre of the Plains" to be produced
in a way that none of the emotional
stirring elements are lost, so that the
atmosphere of the rough and ready
northwest is not weakened must be
staged with the greatest care. Sword
and Sandals is paying out more money
this year than last in order that the pro
duction may be one of the greatest
successes ever. New scenes arc being
bought and painted and a stronger group
of stage managers are being paid for
long hours, in order that the play may
go "over big.' 1
Coach Gordon Davis is becoming more
enthusiastic each day. The plav is of
a type never shown on the campus and
its gripping and suspense arrousing
scenes will make it one of the dramas
to stand out in campus dramatics.
