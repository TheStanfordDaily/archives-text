# INTERCLASS SWIM COMES THURSDAY IN ENCINA PLUNGE
## 
### 
The first aquatic meet of the year
will take place Thursday afternoon in
the Encina pool. The competition is
to be between the classes and all have
entered teams. The sophomores have
the strongest term in point of numbers
and it looks from comparative dope
as though they have the edge in point
winners. All the last year freshman
team are eligible to enter in the
events and they will make a strong
combination for the other classes to
buck up against.
Captain Drake of the varsity has
withheld the varsity swimmers from
competition 011 the belief that more
men will be encouraged to come out
when they think that they have a bet
ter chance of making points. There
will be four places in each event ex
cept the relay. The points will be:
First, five; second, four; third, three;
and fourth, one. The class making
the highest aggregate will win the
meet. This is a big inducement to
each class to appear in numbers.
Up to this year the class of '21
won the inter-class swim each year
since their freshman season. They
are seriously crippled now by the
withdrawing of varsity members and
it looks as though the secnod-year
men have everything their own way.
Unknown talent in the freshman class
may upset the dope however, and
Coach Brandsten looks for a hotly
contested meet.
