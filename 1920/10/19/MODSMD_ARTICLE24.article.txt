# CAMPAIGN ISSUES
## 
### 
The issues of the presidential campaign have been discussed over
and over, and campus people will have to decide tomorrow which of the
so-called issues are the most important and should directly influence
their votes. A good deal of discussion foreign to the actual issues of
the campaign have been brought into play to confuse the electorate, and
it is the job of the thinking voter to weed the minor points out, and base
his choice on the important issues. Perhaps the best summing up of
the issues is given by Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler, President of Colum
bia University, one of the prominent men who signed the recent Repub
lican statement.
He says the two most important points for the voters to bear in
mind are:
"(1) The relation which the people of the United States are to
bear to other nations and to those movements of political and eco
nomic opinion that are common to civilized peoples throughout
the world, and (2) the relative fitness of the Democratic and Re
publican parties to uphold and defend the American form of
government, and to deal in truly constructive and courageous
fashion with the problems of taxation, of cost of living, of trans
portation, of labor, of housing, of public health, and of adminis
trative efficiency which immediately confront the American peo
ple."
The position of the Republican party on a world association is
)wn. Through its platform, its candidates, and by prominent mem
•s of the party, the party is pledged to either a modified form of the
■sent League of Nations or an association amplifying The Hague
mnal idea. As to the relative fitness of the parties, the fact is evi
lt that the Democrats have failed during their term, and as Herbert
>over says: "Our form of government demands that when a party
Is. it shall be retired."
The Republican party will best serve the country during this impor
it" period, and it should succeed the Democratic administration.
