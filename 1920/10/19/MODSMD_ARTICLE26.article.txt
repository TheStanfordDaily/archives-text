# BLEACHER RALLY
## 
### 
Loyal Stanford students will have an opportunity to show that they
are behind the Varsity and Coach Powell by attending the rally tomor
row afternoon, prepared to give their best under Yell Leader Kinney's
direction. The Varsity meets Santa Clara Saturday in one of the
season's most important contests, and the student body must get back of
the football men with all their power.
At 4:30 tomorrow there should not be a vacant seat in the rooting
section.
