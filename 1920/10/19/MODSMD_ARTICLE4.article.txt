# NEW SYSTEM OF CHECKS IS MADE FOR TENNIS MEN
## 
### 
Entries for the fall tennis tourna
ment are coming fast at the gymnasi
um although there is room for many
more men than have signed up. Cap
tain Phil Neer has formed a new sys
tem of checking for the tennis men
who are taking tennis as gymnasium
requirement. Men who play will check
off each day on the bulletin board out
side the gymnasium office in the hall.
This will obviate the confusion of
taking roll on the courts.
The matches played in fall tourna
ment. will decide who is to represent,
Stanford in the intercollegiate meets,
in the spring. All entrants will have
a chance to play men above them
and those who come out ahead at the
end will form the squad that plays for
Stanford in the intercollegate meets.
The new asphalt courts are rapidly
nearing completion and will be avail
able for play within a very short
time. The other courts are of oil and
sand and will be finished shortly and
will furnish all the additional space
necessary for the intramural com
petition.
