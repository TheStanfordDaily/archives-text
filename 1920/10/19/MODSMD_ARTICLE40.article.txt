ITHACA, Oct. 18.—Powerful search
lights have been erected at Schoellkopf
field by the General Electric Company to
lie used by the Cornell football teams.
In the past, Cornell teams have worked
under a handicap because of the fact
that darkness comes so early in the fall.
Under the new system it is hoped that
practice can be carried on until late in
the evening.
