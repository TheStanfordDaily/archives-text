### United Press 
LONDON, Oct. 19. —While Peers and
landed proprietors are selling their
property, the miners are earning so
; much that they can afford to demand
the best of everything, even at present-
S day prices. •
"The miners," said a merchant, "do
not care how much they pay for the
best, as long as they get it. The men
make no secret of their wealth. They
take handfuls of notes from their
pockets just as the professional man
produces coppers."
Some colliers can show pay-sheets
showing, after all deductions, that
they have earned over $65 a week.
