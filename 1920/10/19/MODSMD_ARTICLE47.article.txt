The Library expects to receive twenty
three cases of new books in a very short
time. Word has been received that these
books were shipped from Europe by
W. D. Clark some time ago. Most of
thees new books are ones necessary to
complete a series now in the library.
Others are books that were ordered last
winter but not yet received. Mr. Clark
left Stanford list winter in December
for ibis especial purpose.
