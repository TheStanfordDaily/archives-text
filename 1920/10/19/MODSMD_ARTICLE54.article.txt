### United Press 
EDMONTON, Alta., Oct., 19.â€”More
money has been loaned to soldier
settlers in northern Alberta, than in
any other part of Canada. Albertans
point to this fact as a tribute to the
attractions of the soil and climate of
the province. Through the Edmonton
office which covers the northern half
of the province, loans to soldier set
tlers have been approved to the ex
tent of $14,000,000 and of this amount
nearly $10,000,000 has been disbursed.
About 3,200 soldiers have been actu
ally located on farms with an equal
number settled on homestead lands
for which no loans are necessary.
