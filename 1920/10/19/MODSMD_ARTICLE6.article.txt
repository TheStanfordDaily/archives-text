# FRESHMEN ENTHUSED AT FIRST MEETING OF STANDARDS COURSE
## 
### 
Four hundred freshmen gathered in
the Assembly Hall last night to at
tend the Song Rally, the first meet
ing in the course ofStanford Stand
ards and Ideals desibned for first-year
men and women. "The rally was a
huge success," declared Floyd McEl
roy, president of the student body,
"indicates that the entire series will
accomplish its purpose of acquainting
the freshmen with the past history
of the University and the present-day
conditions."
C. J. Tauzer, '20, explained in a de
tailed manner the traditions which
the past quarter of the century has
made distinctive of Stanford. The
democratic nature of campus life was
emphasized by Tauzer who appealed
to the new students to disregard the
dollar mark i ntheir social relations.
Traditions, not as a dead heritage from
the past, but as live, present-day prac
tices, was the keynote of "Red"
Tauzer's speech.
The Song Rally, lead by Pendell
Kinney, '21, and assisted by Bob Con
nelly, '22, and Les Seib. '22, gave the
freshmen a, real taste of the spirit
which marks the Big Game rally. By
first showing stereopticon lsides bear
ing the words of the songs and yells,
the yell leader acquainted the first
year men and women with the Stan
ford battle hymns. Later, switching
the lights from the screen Kinney led
the audience without aiding them by
flashing the words.
Paul F. Erickson, '21, president of
the Men's Council, who is managing
the course, concluded the meeting by
a short speech, reiterating the points
made by Tauzer.
David Starr Jordan will speak in the
Assembly Hall next Monday evening
in the second meeting of the series.
Erickson announced today. "Stanford
History and the Purposes of the
Founders" will form the subject of the
Chancellor's address.
