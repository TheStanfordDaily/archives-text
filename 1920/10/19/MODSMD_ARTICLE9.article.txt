# PROSPECTS LOOM BRIGHTLY AGAIN FOR CARDINAL
## Righter and Patrick Again in Line-up Should Add Much to Power of Varsity Team 
### 
With "Swede'' Righter back in his
position at center and Jack Patrick
working in the backfield, Stanford pros
pects in the coming Stanford-Santa
Clara contest are greatly strengthened.
Coach Powell is working hard to place
these two last year veterans in shape for
this game next Saturday, which will be
played on Santa Clara's new football
turf.
Captain "Art" Wilcox sustained a
minor injury to his shoulder in the
University of Southern Cailfornia game
last Saturday, but may be in shape to
act as skipper in the game against the
Missionites. The Santa Clara coaches
have developed a strong machine this
year, their eleven having already taken
tiie Olympic Club team down to defeat
in an early season game. Sporting
dopsters have the Santa Clara team
spotted to win the game against the
Cardinal, but the timely arrival of
Righter and Patrick may upset this dope,
if they are in condition to play.
Yell leader Wendell Kinney has an
nounced that tomorrow will be the iirst
bleacher rally of the year. A large

showing is expected for the rally in
order that the team will be given a big
send-off for Santa Calra's Big Game of
the year.
Paul Campbell, who has been playing
in all of the varsity contests at left
half, is showing up in better form with
every practice. The team is nearly al
ways assured of making yards when
Campbell is given the ball. Not only
is he strong on carrying the ball, but
lately Campbell has been doing most of
the Varsity's kicking. Undoubtedly lie
will work in his position against the
Missionites.
Pclouzc is another one of the eleven
that has been showing up in stellar form
during the season. Pelouze's speed has
saved "Stanford may yards by running
down punts. He is also strong on for
ward passes, but until recently few
passes have been used. As the team is
improving there will probably be more
and more forward passes used.
Coacli Carpenter is gradually building
up a strong line and during this week
will concentrate all of his attention on
bucking and tackling.


Paul Campbell, '20, who has played a
speedy and consistent game at right
half on the Cardinal varsity.
