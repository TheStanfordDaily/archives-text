# POLYNESIANS ARE
## NOW DISAPPEARING Beauty of Women Measured by Length of Ears, Says Speaker in Little Theater 
### 
"The Polynesians are a much ma
linged race," said Vaughan Mac-
Caugey commenting on the common
conception of the moral qualities of
the Polynesians and more especially
of the Hawaiians in nis lecture on
Polynesia, in tl>e Little Theater, last
night. MacCaughey brought out the
fact that in ancient Polynesia women
held a higher place than is common
in modern Asiatic civilization and that
many of the island states were suc
cessfully ruled by queens who were
regarded as the equals of male rulers
in all respects.
MacCaughey held a large audience
in close attention to his account of
the life and history of the Polynesian
race. The entire lecture was illust
rated with slides showing examples of
the people, their homes, surroundings
and mythology, which latter resembles
that of the Greeks in some respects.
MacCaughey told of the migrations of
the race from eastern Asia and how
they were driven further and further
into the Pacific to Hie islands they
now occupy. He dealt with the race
itself, their physique, occupations,
high morals and generosity and their
beautiful legends. ITe then told of
the home of the Polynesians and ad
mirably described the country with
its splendid covering of forests and
tropical verdure and magnificent
gorges and mountain peaks.
MacCaughey did not commend the
Caucasian for his part in the develop
ment of the race. "The record of the
white man has been one of the raven
ing wolf," he said.
Speaking of their curious customs,
he stated that they considered the
most beautiful girls those that had
the longest ear lobes —which was ob
tained by piercing the ear-lobe with
a wire on which were hung copper
weights to do the stretching requisite
for beauty. Also, the worst humili
ation that could befall a Polynesian
was to have his enemy procure one
of his bones after he was dead and
use it for a fish hook.
The modern hula-hula is not typical
of the Polynesian of former days, de
clared Mr. MacCaughey. "The dances
of old Polynesia have vanished, never
to return." he said, and added that
the so-called Hawaiian music which
we hear on the coast is not such at
all—"it is nothing but San Francisco
jazz."
In conclusion, Mr. MacCaughey
spoke of Polynesia as a "world that
is wonderful and beautiful, and has
many fine qualities which we hope
may be preserved."
