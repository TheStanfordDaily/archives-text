resented in the last events on ac
count of lack of material.

day promise to be the breast _stroke
and the back stroke. "Dud" DeGroot,
'23, and Charlie Fletcher, '24, will
contest for honors unless a dark horse

Miller, Kirkwood and Landis, '23, are
the entrants for the distance plunge.

and Riddell, Barnett, and Farmer, '23,
are the entrants in the diving contest.
The relay will be for four laps of

counted in the relay.
Stanford swimming fans will have
the first chance to see the Cardinal
mermen in action tomorrow when the
four classes meet in the Encina pool
to decide the inter-class title of the
University. The two younger classes
have entered men in every event hut
the juniors and seniors are not rep
resented in the last events on ac
count of lack of material.
The two interesting events of the
day promise to be the breast _stroke
and the back stroke. "Dud" DeGroot,
'23, and Charlie Fletcher, '24, will
contest for honors unless a dark horse
shows up from somewhere now un
known. Fletcher took the Pacific In
terscholastic Title in the breast
stroke last year at San Diego, and
DeGroot is the champion of the Coast
in the back stroke.
There will be eight events on the
program, seven swimming races and
the diving. In the fifty yard dash
there are three entries from the fresh
man class, three from the sophomore,
two from the junior, and one from
the senior classes. Proctor, Hincks,
and Miller, the freshman entrants;
"Jennie" Austin, MacConnell and
George Young for the sophs; Over
acker, and Fehren for the juniors and
Darling is the lone upholder of the
seniors.
In the 100-yard there are Miller and
Barnes, '24; Austin, MacConnell, and
young, '23; Dorland and Thomas, ";
and Darling, '21. Barnes is the lone
freshman in the 220', with W. W.
Young, Riddell, and Landis, '23;
Fehren, Overacker and Spillman, '22;
and Kline, '21.
The breast stroke will be only two
laps of the tank, on account of the
earliness of the season. Fletcher, '24,
is the favorite and art unknown quanti
ty as far as having been seen at Stan
ford. Robertson, Rosebaum, and
Lovell, all '23's, are the other ent
rants. Fletcher, '24, and DeGroot, '23,
are the two strong contenders in the
backstroke, according to the dope.
Watson, '23, and Stern, '22, and Welch,
'22. are the other entrants.
"Tubby" Ong, '24, Ankele, '21, and
Miller, Kirkwood and Landis, '23, are
