"Dink" Templeton, all star Stanford
athlete, will again be eligible for foot
ball according to an announcement made
from Encina gymnasium this morning.
Facts surrounding Templeton's eligibil
ity were released today,
The only rule that it seems could pos
sibly apply in the case is that allowing
live years after date of matriculation in
which to have five years of varsity com
petition.
This rule, it is claimed, has been modi
fied so as to sutract time spent in the
service from the time of first matricu
lation and date.
Templeton registered on the lirst of
August, six years ago. He joined the
aviation service in the fall of 1917 and
returned .to the university the spring
quarter of 1919. Due to the war Tem
pleton lost five quarters but as he en
rolled in the 'fall of 1917 and took out
a leave of absence, there is question as
to whether four or five quarters should
be subtracted.
But with only four quarters taken out
or one and one-third years, which sub
tracted from the six years is four and
two-thirds years since Templeton's ma
triculation in the university, one quarter
of eligibility would be left for him.
The three years that Templeton played
rugby with the varsity is not recognized
by the conference.
Templeton may be seen in'action
for the Cardinal eleven in the Stan
ford-Santa Clara garan, which will be
played on Santa Clara's new turf
next Saturday. The eligibility of
Templeton will greatly strengthen
Coach Powell's team, especially in
the kicking department. Templeton
is now one of the two "four star"
men in college, having gained this
honor in track. The other is "Reg"
Caughey, captain of last year's var
sity eleven.
Very little dope can be procured
on the Santa Clara eleven, but what
little dope can be figured out from
relative scores points to a Santa Clara
victory. The Santa Clara players de
feated the Olympic Club in an early
season game, by a score of 7 to 0,
while the Stanford players went down
to a 10 to 7 defeat.
Dope on relative scores, however, is
not always a safe way of judging the
strength of different teams. With
standing the fact that scores stand
against Stanford being figured a win
ner in Saturday's contest, the Cardi
nal prospects are getting brighter
daily. With Templeton and Patrick
added to the baekfield squad and with
Righter strengthening the line at
center, Stanford should have a much
stronger eleven than the one that
bueked against the Olympic Club team.
The first bleacher rally of the year
was well attended this afternoon. Yell
Leader KiKnney and his assistants
lead the rooters through the various
Stanford yells and songs. Coach
Powell put his men through a scrim
mage to interest the spectators dur
ing the yell practice.
Graduate Manager Ed Martin is
trying to arrange to have a large
delegation of Cardinal supporters at
tend the (jamn at Santa Clara, because
the Mhsionites term Saturday's con
test as their Big Game of the year.
Coach Powell is working his men
hard, in order that they will not only
lie in condition to meet Santa Clara,
but also the University of Oregon, the
following week. The Oregon eleven
is scheduled to meet the Cardinal
team on the local turf this year, and
will probably be a harder game than
the University of California scrimmage
on November 20..
Last year the Oregon team was
picked to play Harvard in the East
vs. West contest on New Year's day
in Pasadena. The northern team lost
only two or three of last year's squad.

was chosen aR the All-Paeifle Coast
quarter la'st year and received favor
able mention for the mythical All-
American eleven.

lation and date.
Templeton registered on the lirst of
August, six years ago. He joined the
aviation service in the fall of 1917 and
returned .to the university the spring
quarter of 1919. Due to the war Tem
pleton lost five quarters but as he en
rolled in the 'fall of 1917 and took out
a leave of absence, there is question as
to whether four or five quarters should
be subtracted.
But with only four quarters taken out
or one and one-third years, which sub
tracted from the six years is four and
two-thirds years since Templeton's ma
triculation in the university, one quarter
of eligibility would be left for him.
The three years that Templeton played
rugby with the varsity is not recognized
by the conference.
Templeton may be seen in'action
for the Cardinal eleven in the Stan
ford-Santa Clara garan, which will be
played on Santa Clara's new turf
next Saturday. The eligibility of
Templeton will greatly strengthen
Coach Powell's team, especially in
the kicking department. Templeton
is now one of the two "four star"
men in college, having gained this
honor in track. The other is "Reg"
Caughey, captain of last year's var
sity eleven.
Very little dope can be procured
on the Santa Clara eleven, but what
little dope can be figured out from
relative scores points to a Santa Clara
victory. The Santa Clara players de
feated the Olympic Club in an early
season game, by a score of 7 to 0,
while the Stanford players went down
to a 10 to 7 defeat.
Dope on relative scores, however, is
not always a safe way of judging the
strength of different teams. With
standing the fact that scores stand
against Stanford being figured a win
ner in Saturday's contest, the Cardi
nal prospects are getting brighter
daily. With Templeton and Patrick
added to the baekfield squad and with
Righter strengthening the line at
center, Stanford should have a much
stronger eleven than the one that
bueked against the Olympic Club team.
The first bleacher rally of the year
was well attended this afternoon. Yell
Leader KiKnney and his assistants
lead the rooters through the various
Stanford yells and songs. Coach
Powell put his men through a scrim
mage to interest the spectators dur
ing the yell practice.
Graduate Manager Ed Martin is
trying to arrange to have a large
delegation of Cardinal supporters at
tend the (jamn at Santa Clara, because
the Mhsionites term Saturday's con
test as their Big Game of the year.
Coach Powell is working his men
hard, in order that they will not only
lie in condition to meet Santa Clara,
but also the University of Oregon, the
following week. The Oregon eleven
is scheduled to meet the Cardinal
team on the local turf this year, and
will probably be a harder game than
the University of California scrimmage
on November 20..
Last year the Oregon team was
picked to play Harvard in the East
vs. West contest on New Year's day
in Pasadena. The northern team lost
only two or three of last year's squad.
Steers, their slar quarter back return
ed to the university last week. Steers
was chosen aR the All-Paeifle Coast
quarter la'st year and received favor
able mention for the mythical All-
American eleven.
"Dink" Templeton, all star Stanford
athlete, will again be eligible for foot
ball according to an announcement made
from Encina gymnasium this morning.
Facts surrounding Templeton's eligibil
ity were released today,
The only rule that it seems could pos
sibly apply in the case is that allowing
live years after date of matriculation in
which to have five years of varsity com
petition.
This rule, it is claimed, has been modi
fied so as to sutract time spent in the
service from the time of first matricu
lation and date.
