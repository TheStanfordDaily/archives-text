# EXIT MR. GLOOM
## 
### 
lyrni the announcement that "Dink" Templeton is eligible for football
this season, Old Man Gloom makes his exit from the campus. De
spite the steady showing that the Varsity has made in all its game,
the fact that the team has suffered two straight defeats has remained
the dominant fact in campus football gossip, and more or iess depression
has resulted. P>ut with Templeton's entrance into the field, the Cardinal
prospects soar way above normal, and coupled with the addition of
Patrick and Righter to the squad, it will take more than the California
Varsity to stop Powell's fighting eleven.
