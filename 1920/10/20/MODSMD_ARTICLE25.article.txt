# HOOVER AS A CABINET MEMBER
## 
### 
UERBERT HOOVER will undoubtedly receive a position in the next
Cabinet to be formed, whether it is Republican or Democratic. Both
Senator Harding and Governor Cox have indicated that they will ask
Mr. Hoover to become a member of their Cabinets, and Hoover is also
mentioned prominently in the recent poll that the Literary Digest took
of representative newspapers throughout the country on their choices
for Cabinet positions. The Republican papers selected 1 loover .as their
first choice for Secretary of the Interior and Secretary of Commerce
and third choice for Secretary of Agriculture. The Democrats named
Hoover as first choice for Secretary of Commerce and second choice
for Secretary of the Interior. The Republicans voted for Hoover for
every place in the Cabinet except the Secretaryship of the Navy, and he
received votes from the Democrats for six Cabinet posts.
The Digest expresses the opinion that as both Harding and Cox are
newspaper editors, they will give some attention to the suggestions made
by their fellow editors. However, it is almost certain that for the first
time a Stanford man will receive a position in the Cabinet.

The action of the Senior Class in reviving the custom of senior
nshers at Memorial Church is worthy of approbation. In is one of the
many Stanford traditions that fell into disuse during the war period, and
it is one that the Senior Class should enter into whole-heartedly.

Some members of the Freshman Class have evidently forgotten
that it is the custom to wear freshman "dinks."
