(United Press Staff Correspondent)
LONDON, Oct. i 20. —Charges that
the League of Nations has accom
plished nothing during its first ten
months of existence will be met when
th 3 Assembly of the League meets at
Geneva for the initial session, at 11
o'clock on the morning of November
15th.
Advance information indicates that
a number of days will be required
morely to hear the reports of the
various commissions which have been
authorized by the Council to investi
gate international questions.
The first meeting probably will be
presided over by M. Paul I-Iymans, of
Belgium. Later a permanent presi
dent will be chosen by the Assembly
to preside for the remainder of the
conference.
The first subject on the program is
the discussion and adoptoin of rules
of procedure and the appointment of
the committee to examine and report
on the credentials of the delegates.
Then will come the matter of ad
mission of states not named in the
original covenant, and not signatories
of the peace treaties. These states,
who have already qualified for full
membership rights, will be immedi
ately enrolled in the League.
Then will come the consideration
and action of the League Council in
the following matters:
The appointment of three members
of the Saar Valley boundary Com
mission.
The Saar Basin governing Commis
sion.
The appointment of the high com
mission of Danzig and the approval
of the constitution of the Free City.
Responsibilities of the League aris
ing out of the distribution of mandates
and the enforcement of Article XXII
(on mandates).
The appointment of Dr. Fridjof
Nansen. Arctic explorer, to investigate
the problem connected with the re
patriation of ex-enemy prisoners from
Russia and Germany to their respect
ive countries.
The proposed Commission of En
quiry on Russia (defunct).
The Polish Minority Treaty—Guar
antees of the League.
The resolution regarding the admis
sion of Switzerland.
The establishment of the perma
nent Commission under Article XI of
the Covenant.
The first and second budgets of the
League.

Relief in Central Europe and meth
ods and measures to combat the
spread o£ typhus.
Eupen and Malmedy (M. I)a Cunha's
report approving the plebiscite which
gave these provinces to Belgium.)
Relations between the Council and
the Assembly.
Following the Assembly's action on
these matters, Secretary Sir Eric
Drummond will report in detail on the
present organizations and work of the
League Secretariat, and the resolu
tion of the Council which established
the seat of the League at Geneva.
The next subject that will be dealt
with will be the Root-Phillimore In
ternational Court of Arbitration. In
asmuch as several European nations
are as opposed to the unlimited powers
of the Court, as the United States is
to the unqualified Article Ten of the
Covenant, considerable debate is an
ticipated before the Court's consti
tution is finally approved.
The big question in the minds of
many anti- and pro-league partisans
is: Shall the court be subservient to
the League Council or shall the
League Council be powerless to modi
fy or change any decisions arrived at
by the Court?
The other questions, on the tenta
tive agenda, and the order in which
they will be taken up are:
The establishment of a Permanent
Health organization.
An organization to deal with inter
national communications and transit
questions.
A Tribunal to attend to the settle
ment of differences referred to in
various articles of the Versailles
treaty.
The relations between Technical
Organizations and the Council and
Assembly of the League.
Recommendations of the Interna
tional Financial conference.
Preparations required to enable the
economic weapon of the League to
be used in case of necessity.
The Report of the Statistics Com
mission.
The Liquor Trade in Africa.
Supervision over the execution of
agreements reached with regard to the
traffic in women and children.
Supervision of traffic in arms and
ammunition and its control.

LONDON, Oct. i 20. —Charges that
the League of Nations has accom
plished nothing during its first ten
months of existence will be met when
th 3 Assembly of the League meets at
Geneva for the initial session, at 11
o'clock on the morning of November
15th.
Advance information indicates that
a number of days will be required
morely to hear the reports of the
various commissions which have been
authorized by the Council to investi
gate international questions.
The first meeting probably will be
presided over by M. Paul I-Iymans, of
Belgium. Later a permanent presi
dent will be chosen by the Assembly
to preside for the remainder of the
conference.
The first subject on the program is
the discussion and adoptoin of rules
of procedure and the appointment of
the committee to examine and report
on the credentials of the delegates.
Then will come the matter of ad
mission of states not named in the
original covenant, and not signatories
of the peace treaties. These states,
who have already qualified for full
membership rights, will be immedi
ately enrolled in the League.
Then will come the consideration
and action of the League Council in
the following matters:
The appointment of three members
of the Saar Valley boundary Com
mission.
The Saar Basin governing Commis
sion.
The appointment of the high com
mission of Danzig and the approval
of the constitution of the Free City.
Responsibilities of the League aris
ing out of the distribution of mandates
and the enforcement of Article XXII
(on mandates).
The appointment of Dr. Fridjof
Nansen. Arctic explorer, to investigate
the problem connected with the re
patriation of ex-enemy prisoners from
Russia and Germany to their respect
ive countries.
The proposed Commission of En
quiry on Russia (defunct).
The Polish Minority Treaty—Guar
antees of the League.
The resolution regarding the admis
sion of Switzerland.
The establishment of the perma
nent Commission under Article XI of
the Covenant.
The first and second budgets of the
League.

Relief in Central Europe and meth
ods and measures to combat the
spread o£ typhus.
Eupen and Malmedy (M. I)a Cunha's
report approving the plebiscite which
gave these provinces to Belgium.)
Relations between the Council and
the Assembly.
Following the Assembly's action on
these matters, Secretary Sir Eric
Drummond will report in detail on the
present organizations and work of the
League Secretariat, and the resolu
tion of the Council which established
the seat of the League at Geneva.
The next subject that will be dealt
with will be the Root-Phillimore In
ternational Court of Arbitration. In
asmuch as several European nations
are as opposed to the unlimited powers
of the Court, as the United States is
to the unqualified Article Ten of the
Covenant, considerable debate is an
ticipated before the Court's consti
tution is finally approved.
The big question in the minds of
many anti- and pro-league partisans
is: Shall the court be subservient to
the League Council or shall the
League Council be powerless to modi
fy or change any decisions arrived at
by the Court?
The other questions, on the tenta
tive agenda, and the order in which
they will be taken up are:
The establishment of a Permanent
Health organization.
An organization to deal with inter
national communications and transit
questions.
A Tribunal to attend to the settle
ment of differences referred to in
various articles of the Versailles
treaty.
The relations between Technical
Organizations and the Council and
Assembly of the League.
Recommendations of the Interna
tional Financial conference.
Preparations required to enable the
economic weapon of the League to
be used in case of necessity.
The Report of the Statistics Com
mission.
The Liquor Trade in Africa.
Supervision over the execution of
agreements reached with regard to the
traffic in women and children.
Supervision of traffic in arms and
ammunition and its control.
