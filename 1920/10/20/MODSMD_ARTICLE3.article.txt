Golf enthusiasts met last night in
the gymnasium and formed a golf
association to play on the links of
the Menlo Park Country Club. Cecil

of the association and will go out
to the club this afternoon to get ap
plication blanks for admission to
membership. When these are passed
on by the club the students will be
admitted to full membership in the
club with all privileges except a vote.
The student membership will bf
ten dollars per quarter and the holder
of one of these memberships has free
use of the Menlo Club links. The
privilege of the dining room and the
lockers also goes with the member
ship. Coach Duffy Seay is in charge
of the golf members and will work
up a schedule whereby the men can
arrange to spend some afternoons
each week on the links.
