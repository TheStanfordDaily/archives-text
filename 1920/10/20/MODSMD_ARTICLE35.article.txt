# SAD DAY COMING FOR THE PITCHERS

### HENRY L. FARRELL 
(United Press Staff Correspondent)
NEW YORQ, Oct. 20— Beginning
with the year 1930, professional base
ball should have a batting renais
sance.
At just about that time the unin
tentional tutoring of Babe Ruth will
begin to show its effect on the Amer
ican youth. Kids now at the iinpres
j sionable age will be beginning to break
| into box scores of professional base
ball and l the cards say that a flock of
pitchers will begin to yell for a ball
a trjfle less lively. Owners of clubs,
too, will favor legislation to keep a
flock of pellets from leaving the
gounds every day. Something new
| in the way of batting achievements
j will have to be invented, probably,
! because home runs should be as com
| mon then as ordinary hits are now.
The reason for the dip into pro
phecy naturally is that everywhere in
this broad —except perhaps mentally
—land, the ten year old kid is imitat
ing Babe Ruth. They've got his
swing, his "stance" and even his
"waggle."
Just as a caddy develops into a star
! golfer, simply through conscious or un-
I conscious imitation of the star driver
and putters he serves, so are the kids
of today going to pick up some of
Babe's home run methods.
Of course Babe is unusually adapt
i ed to heavy clouting, but it is gener
ally admitted that his swing and "fol
low through" help a lot in gaining
| distance. No one is more apt in ac
j quiring (be cunning of a star than the
ten year old boy.
Baseball players just starting their
j career should avoid becoming pitchers.
| In just a few more years the mounds-
J men will be getting their bumps.
