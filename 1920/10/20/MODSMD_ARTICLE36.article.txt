The Student Council of the University
of North Carolina is directing its atten
tion to the passing of bad checks by uni
versity students. The frequency with
which complaints are lodged is increas
ing and the Council is determined to
stamp out an evil which does great harm
to the university whether the student
j over-drawing his account does it accr
[ dentally or not.
The Council has asked any merchant
receiving a had check from a U. of N.
C, student to take the matter up with
the offending person.
