# Women Asked to Save All Bookstore Coupons
## 
### 
Stanford women are asked to save
the coupons given with purchases at
the bookstore, to help pay off Stan
ford's debts on the Woman's Club I
House. Boxes will be placed in the
bookstore and ltoble to collect these
coupons.
Last year very few women knew of â– 
this plan and only forty dollars was
collected.
The debt on the clubhouse is a heavy
one and demands several hundred in j
interest each year.
