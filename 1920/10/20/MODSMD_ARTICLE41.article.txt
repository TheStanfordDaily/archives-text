# GRECIAN MONARCH IS IN GRAVE CONDITION
## 
### 
As a result of a bit of peevishness
on the part of a member of the monkey
j tribe, Greece is in danger of losing
her sovereign monarch, King Alex-
J ander. The king was bitten by a pet
monkey a few days ago, and has since
! become gravely ill. Last night's re- 1
| port indicated that the king's condl- !
; tion was very serious. He has been j
running a high temperature, from 103.1
jto 104.9. In addition to his other ail
; ments, additional complications have
set in from congestion of the lungs,
| and his condition is described is being i
"very grave."
