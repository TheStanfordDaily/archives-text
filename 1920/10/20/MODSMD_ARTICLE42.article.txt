# Freshmen Excell In Mental Test at Oregon
## 
### 
Last year's freshman class at the Uni
versity of Oregon came out far ahead
of their sophomore rivals in a mental
test given to journalism students.
These tests were given in many uni
versities. The winner at the University
of California, Miss Dorothy Bennett,
was later featured as a writer by the
San Francisco Examiner. At Oregon,
the winner was a freshman, Fred Guyon,
but as yet no newspaper lias sought his
services.
Dean Allen of the journalism depart
ment refused last year*to give out the
result of the tests, as he believed that
it would make it difficult for the soph
mores to properly discipline the fresh
man class.
