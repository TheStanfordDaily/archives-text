For College Women
"OLYMPIC" — the name of this handsome
Brogue Oxford—was selected to symbolize
the ever-widening sphere of feminism. Its
blue-blooded style and sturdy contour will
appeal to the modern college woman — the
kind whose prowess won fame at the recent
Olympic Games.
Mannishness is featured in the broad, modulated toes and
low heels—its broguey wing tips—its picturesque perfora
tions. Developed in four leathers that go well with
heathery hose.
