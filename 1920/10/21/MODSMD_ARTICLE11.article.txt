# GENERAL WALKOUT MAY RESULT FROM ENGLISH STRIKES
## Sympathy Strike by Railways is Regarded as Signal for Complete Tieup in England 
### United Press 
LONDON, Oct. 21. —Action by the
railway men in voting for a sympa
thetic strike to support the miners,
will undoubtedly precipitate the en
tire kingdom in a walkout. Leaders
of the government feel certain that
the orders issued to the railway "Lien
to join the miners on strike will force
the other trade unions of the Empire
to issue orders of the same nature
in order not to weaken their own
cause. If the strike of the miners and
railroad men should fail, it would
weaken the rest of the unions and
for this reason it is believed that a
general walkout in all industries will
be called.
Posters carrying an appeal to the
public to back the administration in
resisting the attempts of the miners
to gain their ends by force were dis
played throughout the Empire today.
The posters carried the signature of
Premier Lloyd George and a message
from General Haig to all ex-service
men to support the government cause.
The text of General Haig's plea fol
lows:
"To all citizens, including my com
rades of all ranks in the great war:
The serious strike has begun and it is
impossible to foresee what may hap
pen before it ends. I hope all former
service men will do their part in help
ing to preserve the best interests of
the community.
Unemployed men in addition to the
striking miners now total 358,000.
These figures include men from allied
trades who have been thrown out of
employment by the strike and 1(12,000
demobilized soldiers who are still
drawing on the unemployment dona
tion fund of the government.
These men form the bulk of thr
rioters who storm Whitehall every
day. Their purpose is 1o insist upor
their right to work. Premier Lloyd
George is planning the construction
of several great roads around London
to provide these men with work.
It is almost a certainty that the
transport workers will join the striking
miners following the action. Fear is
expressed in governmental circles that
a general revolution may follow the
action of the railway workers ;md the
men in the transport work in case
they follow the lead of the railroad
men.
