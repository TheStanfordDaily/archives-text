## Masonic Head Praises Ritter and Faber in Letter to President of the University 
### 
A letter of appreciation from Charles
Albert Adams, Grand Master of 1 lie
Masons of California, has been receiv
ed by President Wilbur, saying:
"It gives me great gratification to
be able as the final official act of my
term of office to write you in apprecia
tion of the assistance Stanford Uni
versity, through Dr. Arthur J. Ritter,
and Dr. Harold K. Faber, of the de
partment of Pediatrics, have been in
our home for children at Covina."
111 his final report as Grand Master,
a copy of which he has sent to the
University, Mr. Adams writes in terms
of highest praise concerning the work
that these two members of the Stan
ford University Medical School have
performed for the children who are
inmates of the Masons' home at Co
vina.
"This year, he says, "again it be
comes the pleasing duty of the Grand
Master of Masons in this jurisdiction
to acknowledge the fraternity's debt
of gratitude to Stanford University,
tor and his associate. Dr. Harold K.
and particularly to Dr. Arthur J. Rit-
Faber of the Department of Pediatrics.
The importance of the psychological
and physical survey made at Covina
each year can not be appreciated ex
cept by one who has seen the results
thereof. It was my good fortune this
year to be able to be present during
a part of the time Dr. Ritter was con
ducting his examination of the children
at Covina; and notwithstanding my
previous knowledge of the work in
which he was engaged it was to me
a revelation. In addition to his ac
knowledged ability in his chosen pro
fession, he has a wonderful gift of
gaining confidence, and I think I may
add tho love, of little children. If our
debt of gratitude to him is ever dis
charged it will be only through the
satisfaction he so evidently finds in
the opportunity for service to them
and to the fraternity."
