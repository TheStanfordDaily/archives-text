# BOLSHEVIST LITERATURE ADDED ID COLLECTION
## 
### 
Stanford University has just re
ceived several cases of bolshevist
books, pamphlets, posters, and docu
ments from Hungary, which has fin
ally reached the University Library,
tÂ® form a part of the Hoover War Col
lection. only after several liair-breadth
escapes from destruction, the exer
cise of much diplomacy by Professor
Ralph H. Lutz, through whom it was
originally acquired, and finally the
personal intervention of Herbert C.
Hoover with the Hungarian govern
ment.
The material was gathered in the
fall of 1919 from the government or
ganized by Friedrich upon the down
fall of the Archduke Joseph.
Much of it was contraband in Hun
gary. its sale and distribution had been
forbidden and a considerable propor
tion of the documents represented had
been ordered destroyed by Friedrich.
A good deal of it originated with the
Bela Kun regime and it was only
through long argument that Professor
Lutz was able to persuade the Fried
rich administration to permit it to
become a part cf the 'comprehensive
Hoover collection, which he was gath
ering for Stanford University.
He succeeded finally, however, the
matrial was boxed, and turned Over to
the American Mission for forwarding
to the United States. Just at this
point the Friedrich govenrtnent fell
and the reactionary government which
succeeded seized the material, opened
it and removed a considerable part of
the contents refusing permission to
have it leave the country. Tt was at
this point that Herbert Hoover was
called upon to exercise his influence.
The Hungarian government was per
suaded not to destroy the prohibited
matter immediately and ultimately,
upon Hoover's representation, permit
ted the material to go forward. Pro
fessors E. D. Adams and Lutz, of the
Stanford History Department, direc
tors of the Hoover War Collection,
were highly gratified when this very
valuable collection was finally laid
down in the Stanford Library set
aside for the Hoover Collection. It
has not yet been sorted but Professor
Lutz, under whose direction it was
gathered in Hungary, snvs that it will
form a very valuable part of the
Hoover War Collection and throw a
light on the activities of the bolshe
vists in Hungary which historians
would be able to obtain satisfactorily
from no other source.
