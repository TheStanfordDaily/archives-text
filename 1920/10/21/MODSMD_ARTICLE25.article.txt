# SANTA CLARA CONFIDENT THAT MISSIONITES WILL BEAT CARDINAL ELEVEN
## PATRICK AND RIGHTER WILL PLAY AGAINST ANCIENT RIVALS 
### 
With Santa Clara confident of de
feating Stanford Saturday afternoon,
the Cardinal varsity eleven will run
out on the Missionites' football turf
in an effort to upset the prevailing
dope. According to relative scores
the Santa Clnra team has the edge
on the local team. The players from
the Mission College defeated the
Olympic Club by a 7 to 0 tally, while
the Cardinal squad went down to de
feat. before the winged "O" men by
a 13 to 7 score.
Coach Powell feels certain of being
able to use Righter and Patrick in
Saturday's line-up. but is doubtful
whether he will be able to start Temp
leton in the play. The latter has hard
ly been out for practice long enough
to learn the Varsity signals. "Art"
Wilcox will not be included in the
starting line-up because of an injury
of his shoulder sustained in the game
against the University of Southern
California last week.
Pelouze will start in his old posi
tion at left end, while K. Shlaude
man and Adams will fight for the po
sition at the other end of the line.
Pershing will start at right tackle,
with McAlpine probably playing the
left tackle. The guards wiil be se
lected from the following five men:
Deems, Cravens, DeGroot, Levy and
Stice. Righter or Rice will be in the
beginning line-up at center.
R. Shlaudeman will play quarter,
and Campbell will work at'left half.
Coach Powell will pick either Arnett
or Mertz for the other half, and will
start either Patrick or Woollomes at
full.
Coaches Powell and Carpenter are
giving the team another hard scrim
mage this afternoon, while the men
will receive only light signal work
tomorrow.
The game against the Missionites is
scheduled to start at 3 o'clock on the
new Santa Clara football turf. Grad
uate Manager Ed Martin has arranged
to have a special train carry the
Stanford rooters to what Stanford's
opponents term their Big Game of the
year. The train will return to the
campus immediately following the
contest.
