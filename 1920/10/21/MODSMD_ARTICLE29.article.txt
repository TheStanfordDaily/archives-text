Jn line with the tendency being manifested by college dailies to
bring the university community in closer touch with daily happings
and woi4<l thought, The Daily Palo Alto has arranged to have its
United Press service increased from its present size to that received by
cities of five and six thousand population. The new service will take
effect next week, and will be received by telephone direct from the San
Francisco office of the United Press. It will mean considerable more
work for members of the staff, but it is hoped that the increased service
that the paper will render to Stanford people will recompense the staff
for its lalwr.
Through the courtesy of the Comptroller and the manager of the
University Press, an up-to-date press has been purchased for the use
of this paper, and will be installed soon. With the aid of the increased
United Press service and improved press facilities, it is planned to en
large the size of the paper from its present four pages to either six or
eight pages in a short time.
With today's issue a "colyum" makes its first appearance, under the
title of "Cabbages and Things." This feature will be thrown open to
competition from all students, and contributions will be welcome.
