# "HELLO GENTS"
## 
### 
Saying "hello" to a fellow student has always been one of Stanford's
most favored traditions, and it is one that should be lived up to by the
entire student body. Stanford has always been proud of the democratic
spirit existing on the campus and the custom of greeting- each other
when passing on the Quad, or any. place on the campus has been one or
the manifestations of this spirit. "Hello, Gents!" applies equally from
the oldest "holdover down to the newest freshman.
