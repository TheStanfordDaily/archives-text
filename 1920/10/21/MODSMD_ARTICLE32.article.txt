TOKIO, Oct. 21. â€”A poultry dealer's
business requires the slaying of count
less fowls, but those of Japan do not
do so without tender regret for the
spiritual welfare of their feathered
victims.
This is shown by the fact that Tokio
poultry merchants are making pre
parations for a gigantic ceremony at
which a general mass will be said in
order to convey comfort for the spirits
of the chickens and other feathred
creatures slain during the past year.
The event will be attended by 300
dealers and by 500 of their empolyees.
"These living things love life as
much as we do," explains one of the
merchants. "Thersfore it is proper
that we comfort their spirits."
