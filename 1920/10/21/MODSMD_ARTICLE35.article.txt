# CONDITIONS IN MEXICO SHOW RAPID IMPROVEMENT

MEXICO CITY, Act. 21.—Mexico is
brightening up. It may be said, by
th same token, that Mexico also is
"picking up," both socially and com
mercially. The old-timers, both Mex
icans and foreigners, who have seen
ten years of revolution, hesitate to
venture a guess when asked how long
this condition will continue, but they
do not deny that Mexico today is more
wide-awake, more cheerful and looks
to the future with more confidence
than at any time in the past eight or
ten years.
It is five months now since Venusti
ano Carranza fled from his capital and
passed into the limbo of "late, la
mented" Mexican presidents. It is
four months since Adolfo de la Huerta,
his successor, took the oath of office.
And in a little over a month, Alvaro
Obreson, president-elect, will assume
the chair, which, if Obregon is a
strong enough man, he may occupy

for four years. So it may be oppor
tune to take stock of Mexico today.
It should be said, in justice to de la
Huerta, that a provisional government
of only six months duration is con
fronted with administration difficulties
which cannot be eliminated in such
a brief period of time. These diffi
culties will be Obregon's heritage. It
is up to Obregon to rescue Mexico.
If fails—but that is peering
into the future. This is a story of
the present.
The improved conditions throughout
the Republic are reflected particularly
in Mexico City. It is not so much any
great tangible achievement that ap
pears reassuring, for such vital re
construction problems as the railroad
situation, finances, etc., still remain
to be solved, but it is the spirit of
optimism, the belief that a better day
has arrived, that impress one now in
moving about the capital. The people
seem better dressed and of a lighter
frame o£ mind. They seem to have
more money to spend. Business is
improving. The town is cleaner. The
depression of many years' duration is
begkming to lift. Mexico City pre
sents the bustling appearance of a
metropolis going to work. Motor cars
so throng the streets that the traffic
ploblem is the most critical in history.
The hotels are full, either with Mexi
cans wh have returned from abroad,
or with foreigners, principally Ameri
cans, who have come to seek business
opponrtunities.
The beggars, ii is true, are still
with us. In fact, they seem to have
increased, perceiving that their field
is more profitable with the dawn of
prosperity. They range from the
small children, who, since the increas
ed American influx have increased
their vocabulary by learing to say,
"Hello, meester, piease gimme five
cents," to the old men and women in
rags who extend their palms with
supplications "a Dios." There is one,
singularly successful, who waits until
the traffic cop's "stop" sign has halted
the long stream of automobiles on the
main thoroughfare. Then he passes
from car to car, collecting from all
occupants who are touched by his ap
peal. The government has made ro
attempt to eliminate the beggar an
noyance.
The most signal achievement of the
provisional government, as President
> la Kuerta ren arked recently to for
eign correspondents, is the pacifica
tion of the country. It is the feeling
of safety from bandit and rebel bands
that forms the basis of the newborn
confidence. But reconstruction has
been started in many lines, such as.
the paving of the streets, the reduc
tion of the army and the reorganiza
tion of the customs service along the
Orders alrady have been
placed for new railway material, in
cluding locomotives and freight, cars,
though the national treasury does not
permit all of the necessary expedi
tures along this channel.
Construction men declare that more
building is being done today than at
any time in the past six years. One
builder considered his work so urgent
that he ordered a large supply of ce
ment from the United States to be
divided into small packages and sent
by parcels post, not wishing to wait
on the slow freight service. Business
between Mexico and the United Sta
tes is on the upgrade, the American
Chamber of Commerce estimating
that the trade of the two countries
will reach a value of $320,000,000 for
1020.
As regards the bigger problems, it
appears now that, most of them will
be left for the attention of Obregon,
who will be able to build for the
future with more certainty than de la
Huerta. It is expected, too, that Ob
regon will surround himself with al
most a wholly new cabinet, which
tends to slow up the plans of some
government departments. Obregon's
task will include the upbuilding of the
railroads, the settlement of the oil
controversy, the meeting of claims for
losses suffered by foreign nationals,
an arrangement to begin payment on
(lie national debt and the reorganiza
tion of internal finances. It is a her
culean task that confronts Obregon,
but lie will have a peaceful, increas
ingly hopeful nation to deal with, thus
giving the situation a vastly brighter
tone than it possessed six months ago.
What Mexico wants—wants above
everything else —is the recognition of
her government by the United States.
The question of recognition revolves in
a circle. It amounts to this: The
Mexican government, recognizes that
that United States —and Britain and
France as well —will demand the ful
fillment. of certain obligations on
Mexico's part.
"All right," Mexico says, "assum
ing the justice of these demands, we
are eager to settle accounts as soon
as possible."
Then Mexico proceeds to busy her
self in cleaning house. But she soon
discovers that whether the immediate
problem be the revival of the coun
try's banking system, the reorganiza
tion of the railroads, the payment of
interest on her foreign debt, or half
a dozen other matters, she doesn't
possess the wherewithal to "put it
over." She needs the moral and fi
nancial support of the outside world.
But the outside world, represented
principally by the United States,
hasn't recognized the Mexicon gov
ernment and assistance is not yet
forthcoming.
Must Mexico do certain things, be
fore she is recognized? Or must
Mexico be recognized, before she can
do these things? It's the old hen-and
the egg proposition. And ' there you
are!
