### R. W. K. HELP! HELP 
[Nowadays zve hear a lot about the
work of the colyum conductor. He is
a, fairly familiar animal. Every paper
manages to find someone who can start
and edit a colyum of humor, alleged and
otherwise. That is the easy part of the
business. Conductors can be had any
where. The shortage lies in the motor
men —the public spirited indivs. who
are r ,willing to trot their brain children
out before said public through the means
of a colyum. That is the case at Stan
ford. Underneath these words of wis
dom is one of these • colyums—or at
least a column in the making. The
D. P. A. is doing the conducting, but it
is leaving the motorman act up to the
rest of the campus. And that is the
point—send your "Cabbages," or any
thing that looks like one to the Cab
bage Editor, D. P. A. and become a
motorman.]

All this stuff about conductors and
motormen in ye ed.'s introduction
painfully reminds us of a neglected
opportunity to caption it "Carmen"
which might have wrung a laugh out
of some depraved musician.

Always treat the co-eds with the
greatest respect —they mean well, though
not looking so.
