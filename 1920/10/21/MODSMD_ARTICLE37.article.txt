# PERILS OF WILLIE

Friend Willie Gong just tore along
In his Simply-Stunning-Six;
But he hit the chains on the campus
plains,
And crossed the river Styx—P.S.

The Glee Club isn't getting a square
deal, we are indignantly informed. It
seems that a bunch of local enthusi
asts are always insisting on getting
up in public places and singing "Come
join the band." They never say a
word about the Glee Club, which
needs members a whole lot worse than
the band does.

Our college songs are giving us lots
of trouble with rival organizations.
For instance take the one that in
forms us that the Cardinal is waving
without saying a word about the "Pic
torial" or "Chappie."

P. S. writes that Doctor Jordan has
nothing on him when it comes to
choosing between Debs and Dubbs;
he has to choose between the Union
and the Inn.

It is hard to say what will make a
frosh rushee popular. A Mercer can
do it and so can a set of snappy golf
socks. However, thinks Kilp, in these
days of high house bills, a rushee by
the name of MacSwiney ought to stand
the best chance in a popularity con
test.
