For a minute it looked as if their
might be the germ of a Bolshevik up
rising among the faculty, P.iS. has
breathlessly reported to. us. This
morning Prof. Townley told his astron
omy class that "Nothing here at Stan
ford is straightâ€”it's all crooked." But
lie was only speaking of the direction
of the streets in relation to the cardi
nal points, Amanda, so don't have your
return ticket validated yet.

That ancient wiseguy who first said
that "good wine needs no bush" prob
ably never looked around for a place
to hide a quart of "very old."
