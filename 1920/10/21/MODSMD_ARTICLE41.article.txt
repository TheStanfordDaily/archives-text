# KAPPAS KAN'T KORNER KWEENER'S KOATS
## 
### 
WITH REGRET wo note that the
following advertisement appeared for
several days last week in the columns
of the afternoon campus daily: "Will
person who took red 1923 sweater and
coat from rear of Kappa house, last
Tuesday, return it to Comptroller's
OfTlee and receive reward." ,
WITH REGRET we rise to inquire
what redoubtable warrior of the class
of 1923 has so indisc.rimiately bestow
ed his Koat to the Kappas?
WITH REGRET wo ask for fi hint as
to what occasion on las) Tuesday lead
the Kweener to the' Kappa Kitchen
ette?
WITH REGRET we mournfully
acknowledge that the Comptroller's
Office refuses information and an
enveloping silence proceeds from tele
phone number, P. A. lft.T.i,â€”Kilp.
Ain't publicity grand?
