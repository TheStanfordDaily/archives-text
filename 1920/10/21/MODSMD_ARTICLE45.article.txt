# Plan Season Tickets For Faculty and Alumni
## 
### 
Faculty members and graduate
alumni will be given the opportunity
to purchase season tickets for Stan
ford games according to a plan that
is now under consideration in the
graduate manager's office.
Heretofore graduates and faculty
members have paid the regular ad
mission price which comes to $21 a
year, while students receive the same
privileges for $15, which is included in
their registration fee.
The new plan will admit the grad
uates and faculty members to all
games but the Big Game just as the
students are admitted by their regist
ration cards. The tickets will cost
$5 and will be good for three quar
ters.
Juniors and sophomores who wish
to try out for solicitors in the sale
and distribution of the fckets snould
report to the graduate manager at
cnce.
