## 
###

Cross at its first regular meeting for
the year yesterday afternoon. This
campaign, for one dollar memberships,
coincides in time with the national drive.
The request of the Y. M. C. A. for a
time for its annual campaign on the
campus for funds was considered, but
the date has not yet been finally lixed
by the Y. M. C. # A.
The Social Service Board is composed

President of the University, three wom
en students appointed" by the President

students appointed by the President of

are to pass on all proposals to solicit
funds from the students by general cam
paigns or drives, and to set times for
those that it approves, and to foster a
spirit of altruism among the students of
the University. No campaigns for mon
ey for any purpose may be carried on
among the students on the campus with
out its approval.
The Board at its meeting yesterday
expressed the desire that all organiza
tions proposing to conduct campaigns

On account of many petitions for help
that reach the University from the stu
dents, faculty and officers of universities
in Hungary and other nations where
post-war conditions have deprived these
classes of even the bare necessities of
life in food and clothing, the Board
voted to recommend to President Wilbur
that he appoint a standing committee to
take cognizance of these petitions and to
provide a means by which those who are
willing to aid may do so, although it
was the feeling of the Board that no
special drive for this purpose should be
instituted. Many American universities
and colleges have raised funds for such
relief.
The membership of the Social Service
Board is as follows: Mrs. Everett W.
Smith, chairman; Mrs. John W. Mitch
ell, Professor A. M. Cathcart, Elizabeth
McGee, Margaret McCall, Mary Sprott
