# FRESHMAN FOOTBALL STAR BREAKS ARM
## 
### 
Floyd Tull, freshman football play
er, broke his arm last night in a
scrimmage with the varsity. Tull
was a valuable man to the freshmen
and his ability to go through the op
posing line was a matter of campus
comment. Ho played the position of
guard and his assistance in downing
the opposition will be missed in the
freshman line-up.
