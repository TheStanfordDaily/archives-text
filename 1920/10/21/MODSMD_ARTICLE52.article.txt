RICHMOND, Oct. 21.— California's,
community pnflierty law. on the statute
books for more than sixty years, is a
►disgrace to the intelligent men and
women of the state, declared Mrs. A.
E. Carter of Oakland in an address Lhis
afternoon before the annual convention
of the Woman's Christian Temperance
Union of California. She is state chair
man of the community property com
mittee.
Choosing for her subject "Put the
Luck in 13." urged California to vote
in favor of amendment 13—the com
munity property bill.
"Community property is that property
which is accumulated by husband or
wife, or both after marriage. Under
the laws of California, the wife's inter
est in this property which she has helped
to accumulate is a mere expectancy,"
said Mrs. Carter.
"She has no interest in it during life,
and cannot leave one dollar of it to her
children at Iter death. It all goes auto
matically to the husband, without hts
having to pay one dollar of attorney's
fees, or to the administration of hanks
which do a trust business.
"But it is a different story when the
husband dies first. Tie lias a right to
leave iiis half to anybody or anything he
may choose, and the wife must pay the
attorney's fees on her half to have it
probated, and the estate settled, and in
order to deliver the husband's hall to
whom he lias chosen to give it.
"The new law will give husband and
wife exactly the same right to dispose
of community property at death."
