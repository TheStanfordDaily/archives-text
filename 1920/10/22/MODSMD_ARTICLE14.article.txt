## Layoff Gives Injured Chance to Mend Before Game With U.S.C. Frosh Next Week 
### 
Graduate Manager Martin was unable
to schedule a game for the Cardinal
Babes for tomorrow so the eleven will
have an enforced rest. Efforts were made
to stage a game with the Santa Clara
freshmen or Palo Alto High School, and
an appeal was made to the Pacific Coast
Football Association for a suitable op
ponent, but there were no teams around
the bay available fqr Saturday.
A rest will not hurt the Freshmen, as
the team is pretty badly bruised up from
their game last week with Davis and
their scrimmages with the Varsity. Car
ter, who plays a tackle position, is still
v ufferiug from in injured knee. Th«»;c
<>f the candidates for guard positions are
out of the game with injuries. Richard
son has a sprained ankle, Tull a broken
wrist, and "Tubby" Ong is in the hospi
tal with a dislocated shoulder.
Coach Seay is putting the balance of
the squad through a light workout every
night. Seay believes that with a week in
which to make repairs the team will be
in fine shape to battle the freshmen from
the University of Southern California in
the preliminary to the Stanford-Oregon
contest next Saturday.
