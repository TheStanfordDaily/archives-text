# NOMINATIONS FOR NINE STUDENT BODY OFFICES CLOSE MONDAY NOON
## 
### 
Rules governing student body dec
lions for the coming year have been
radically changed from those previously
in force, announced James Petrini, '21,
Chairman of the Election Board, in a
statement today explaining the recently
adopted rules.
The former method of forwarding
nominations to the Election Board which
at once published them in the Daily Palo
Alto has been discontinued. Instead, a
box will be placed in front of the
Romanic Languages Building just above
the Law steps into which any student
may place a nomination. The Election
Hoard will open the box and publish all
nominations in the same issue of the
1 )aily Palo Alto.
The new rules will have their first
trial in making the nominations for the
student body election next Wednesday
which has been called to till the posi
tions vacated by the resignations of a
number of subordinate officers. Chair
man Petrini declared nominations open
at 5:00 o'clock yesterday afternoon with
the closing time set at next Monday
noon. The Monday issue of the Daily
Palo Alto will publish the full list of
the nominees, although any nominee may
withdraw before Tuesday noon by noti
fying Petrini.
Seven student body positions and two
class offices will be idled by the Wednes
day election which will open on the
Quad at 10:00 a. m. The resignation of
Bart Gillespie, '18. makes necessary the
election of a new Secretary of the As
sociated Students. Jn addition, a Soph
more representative on the Executive
Committee (man), two representatives
to the Men's Council, two representa
tives to the Union Board of Governors,
and one representative to the Board of
Athletic Control will be selected at the
first Quad election of the year.
The seniors will lill the positions of
Class Treasurer and Vice-President
made vacant by the resignation of the
men elected to those offices last spring.
