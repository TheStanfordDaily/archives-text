Samuel J. Hume, Director of the
Greek Theater at the University of Cali
fornia, characterized the recent perform
ance of the Skull and Keys society as
"in despicably bad taste," in asking that
his connection with the organization be
severed.
"It seems strange that group of
selected men in the University of Cali
fornia will produce a performance which
would be a discredit to a savage. Even
savages do not befoul their women
folk" said Professor Hume.
Two members of the society have been
suspended for a year as a result of their
conduct during the public innitiation
held last Friday in California Field.
