# CARDINAL TEAM READY TO COMBAT WITH MISSION ELEVEN AT SANTA CLARA
## TEMPLETON MAY NOT BE USED IN CONTEST TOMORROW 
### 
The old-time athletic (rivals will
clash when the Stanford varsity runs
out on the Santa Clara gridiron to
meet the Missionite eleven, tomorrow
afternoon at 3 o'clock. Graduate
Manager Ed Martin has arranged to
have a Stanford rooters' special leave
the Southern Pacific station at 2:25
o'clock, and leave Santa Clara for the
return trip at 5:40 o'clock.
During the broken intercollegiate
athletic relations with the University
of California, the game between the
Stanford and Santa Clara elevens was
considered the Big Game of the year.
Although the Cardinal holds the Cali
for ilia contest to be the Big Game
now, Santa Clara still considers the
Stanford scrimmage the big event of
their year's athletic calendar.
Last night a monster rally and bon
fire was held by the Missionites. The
entire Santa Clara student body
gathered to give the team a big send
off. Besides singing all of their songs
and yells, several of the alumni spoke
before the rally.
Father Murphy, president of the
college set the fire off by means of
electricity, at 9 o'clock. The fiaines
extended upwards fully 75 feet into
the air. The blaze was in evidence
for fully three hours, being visible for
miles around.
Both football teams are figuring on
'defeating the other. Santa Clara is
apparently positive of victory, while
the Cardinal players are going to fight
hard to add another victory to Stan
ford's record. Santa Clara undoubted
ly has a strong team and will be a
hard eleven for the local players to
down, but during the past week the
Cardinal coaches have been putting
their men through unusually hard
scrimmages and practices in hopes
that they will be in condition to not
only block the Missionites' offense,
but also to tear through their ranks
for a touch-down.
"Dink" Templeton will probably stay
out of the game since he has hardly
had time enough to learn the varsity
signals. While the Cardinal is losing
Templeton, the Santa Clara line-up
will not include Flaherty at tackle.
Flaherty is considered one of their
best bets in the line, but will not be
able to compete against Stanford be
cause of having attended Santa Clara
only five months, while the eligibility
rules cr. 11 for a registration of at least,
one year.
Patrick and Campbell will probably
kick lor the Cardinal while Ray Scliall
will drop back from his position in
the line when Santa Clara is forced
to punt.
Caesar Manelli, the Missionites'
captain and tackle, will again buck
against a Stanford team. Manelli has
been one of Santa Clara's strongest
athletes for the past three years and
the older Cardinal men know what
they are going against when they are
forced to buck against the veteran
football man.
A special rooting section is being
reserved for the Stanford Support
ers, and Yell Leader Kinney and assist
ants will be on hand to take charge
of the cheering. All students are
urged to journey to Santa Clara and
back the football squad.
