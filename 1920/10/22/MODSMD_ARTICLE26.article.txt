# BOTULISM AND ANTI-VIVISECTION
## 
### 
rjONSIDERAIiLE agitation is being raised by olive growers and can
ning companies, aided by the Stanford Medical Schools and the Uni
versity of California! over the proposed anti-vivisection amendment.
This amendment would prevent animal experimentation and conse
quently the study of botulism. The study of botulism first started as
a result of the deaths of two Stanford a few years ago from
food-poisoning. The stud)' was taken up by Dr. Ernest C. Dickson, of
the Stanford Medical School who has become an authority on these
subject. Dr. Dickson has developed a serum, as a result of animal
experimentation, which appears to be successful, and its application upon
the two food-poisoning cases reported in Oakland today may save two
human lives.
If Dr. Dickson's experiments on animals prove to be successful in
saving human lives, as it appears it will be. it would be a criminal
offense for the voters of this State to legislate against this experimen
tation. Olive growers and prominent canning men have raised a fund
for the study of botulism in the hopes that it will save their industries,
but if the voters deny them the right to experiment on animals, food
poisoning cannot be checked and Ixith human lives and the welfare of
the fruit growers will be threatened.
VOTE AG ATX ST AMENDMENT XO. SEVEN.
