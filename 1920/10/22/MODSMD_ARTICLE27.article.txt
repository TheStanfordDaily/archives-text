# THE 						SANTA CLARA PILGRIMAGE
## 
### 
(STANFORD should move entirely to Santa Clara tomorrow to wit
ness the, football game between the* two universities. It is one of
the most important contests of the season for the Varsity, and the yell
leader and his assistants will need a solid rooting section to combat
the Santa Clara spirit. The Mission students are making this contest
their big game of the season, and the entire institution will be out to
support their eleven. A good deal of the old-time Stanford-Santa
Clara spirit will be in evidence, and Stanford should be well represented
in the rooting section.
