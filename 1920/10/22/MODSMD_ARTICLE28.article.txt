# GERMANS STRIVE FOR COMMERCIAL HOLD IN MEXICO
## 
### United Press 
MEXICO CITY, Oct. 22. â€”Germany
is beginning in earnest her drive to
regain lost commercial prestige in
Mexico. A German news service, dis
tributed free, is appearing now in the
press of the capital, and posters dis
played throughout the city announce
that German motion pictures will be
shown shortly at the local cinemas.
Te German news service, which is
under the direction of the same Gei 1 -
tnuns who dispensed propaganda here
during the war, is devoted largely to
presenting the German point of view
in European political questions, and
to information on the rehabilitation
of German industry. The movies, it
is believed, will attempt to demon
strate Germany's recovery from the
war, socially and industrially, depict
ing scenes in manufacturing plants.
How to distribute these films, how
ever, evidently has delayed their ap
pearance on the screen, for the lead
ing exchange, which controls nearly
all of the theaters, declares that the
Mexican public insists on American
and Italian films.
Tn the meantime German business
firms, who are now handling Amer
ican goods, promise their customers
that the products of German factories
will soon be ready for the market.
