# PROFESSOR ESPINOSA FINDS NEW STORIES
## Spanish Professor Reports Papers Complimentary To His Efforts 
### 
Letters from Professor Aurelio M.
Espinosa, of the Romanic Language
department at Stanford, indicate that
he is being remarkably successful in
his collection of folk lore stories in
Spain which is occupying him during
his leave of absence from the Uni
versity.
Professor Espinosa, who teaches
Spanish at Stanford, went to Europe
early last summer for the purpose of
gathering Spanish folk lore stories
under (he auspices of the American
Folk Lore Society. After visits to
Rome, Barcelona, and Madrid, he went
to northern Spain to prosecute his
work and he writes from there "There
is folk lore here for ten specialists
for years."
The Spanish newspapers have been
exceedingly complimentary to Pro
fessor Espinosa, whom they credit
with being a typical American by
birth and heart although his name is
Spanish. The purity and correctness
of his Spanish diction and pronun
ciation strikes them as particularly
-noteworthy and they credit him w#th
aiding in bringing about a closer un
derstanding between Spain and the
United States.
One writer, in "El Imparcial" the
great Madrid newspaper, in comment
ing on Professor Espinosa's work
says "lie was born on a ranch near
which lived Indians and we even sus
pect that he used to paint his face and
adorn his scholarly head with feathers
in order to ingratiate himself with
these aborigines and get them to tell
their tales." This writer says that the
Indian tale "How Did the Toad Lose
His Tail?" struck Espinosa as being
European in its origin and tells how
in Spain he lias been seeking to find
it there. Of everybody he asked
"How did the toad lose his tail?"
fruitlessly until finally an old man in
a far-off valley in northern Spain an
swered "Because he swapped it for
the eyes of the mole." Professor
Espinosa had located his Indian
story in Spain and, says the writer,
"He is doubtless the most learned man
in the world in folklore."
Professor Espinosa lias lectured to
various bodies in Spain about native
American folk lore and its relation
to that of Spanish-America and old
Spain. He is editor of the American
magazine "Hispania." He will return
to Stanford at the beginning of the
next quarter in January.
