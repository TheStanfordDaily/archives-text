# Liberal Concessions Made to Ge "Cops"

### United Press 
OAKLAND, Oct. 22. â€”In contrast to
former years when an announcement
of a vacancy in police ranks would
bring scores of aspiring "cops" to
the civil service offices, candidates for
positions on Oakland's police force
now are so scarce that the civil ser
vice commission is making liberal
concessions in order to get men. Ap
licants not heavy enough to pass the
tests are granted sixty days to make
the necessary weight. The small pay
makes it almost impossible to get
recruit patrolmen, board members say.
