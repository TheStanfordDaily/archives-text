By United Press
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Oct. 22.
—Stanford University has been of
fered a chance to add to its faculty
a man who claims to be the possessor
if not the source of all knowledge.
Not only is the applicant willing to
assume any professorship in Stanford
University on the ground of "my spe
< ial knowledge pertaining to that
chair —regardless of what It is," but
lie is ready to teach theology in
soviet Russia or for $200,000 will place
"constitutional government in the
United States."
Let the letter of application, re
ceived by Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur,
president of Stanford, speak for itself:
"I have the honor of informing you
that until Russian agents called upon
me soviet Russia was atheistic. Since
that time they have established a chair
of theology in their national univer
sity.
"This chair is vacant and will be
until such time as an applicant ap
pears before the intellectual works and
proves his fitness for the chair by
explaining everything in the universe.
I have applied for this chair.
"Of course, you understand theology
is logic applied to the first cause of
all things and until the cause, is un
derstood, humanity is deprived of the
benefits from the effects —and nature
can only be ruled through recogniz
ing and obeying the laws of nature.
"I understand that your institution
is interested in physical research and
Plato 'said a mouthful' when lie said.
'To know all about the soul, you must
know all about all tilings.'
"Now T know all about the soul.
"For your information, I charge the
Interchurch World Movement with ob
taining funds under false pretenses
and the department of justice barred
them from the use of the mails in
obtaining funds for Christian propa
ganda.
"I have also attempted to obtain a
contract from the federal government
for the purpose of placing constitu
tional government in the United
States — ; I only asked two hundred
thousand for the job—but tliey did not
have authority to close the contract
with me—'passing the buck.'
"Since I can obtain a medical license
through reciprocity and since my ideal
is 1o lecture in an institution and prac
tice medicine as well, T herewith ap
ply for a chair in your institution and
base my appointment upon my special
knowledge pertaining to that chair —
regardless of what it is."
