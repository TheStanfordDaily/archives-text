# RETURN OF HORSE IS EXPERT'S PREDICTION
## 
### United Press 
DETROIT, Mich., Oct. 22.â€”The next
five years will see the horse drawn
carriage, the saddle horse and the
trucking horse on the boulevards, in
the parks and on the highways in a
great revival of Old Dobbin's useful
ness far the statement today to the
United Press by J. C. Buckley, for
twenty-four year a horseslioer of
Detroit. Buckley is now "shoeing
horses 011 paper" as editor of the
Horseshoers Journal.
Carrying on his former business in
one location on exclusive north Wood
ward Avenue, Buckley shod the hors
es of many Detroit millionaires, among
them Hazen S. Pingree, former gov
ernor of Michigan; C. A. Newcomb of
the Newcomb-Endicott company and
Siman J. Murphy; millionaire lumber
man and owner of the Penobscot of
fice building and many otlirs.
Buckley based liis statement 011 the
movement being forwarded by many
states setting aside driving space
along the boulevards and in the parks
also 011 the fact that the tonnage of
horse shoes and nails manufactured
today is greater than at any time in
the past two or three years and on
the introduction of legislation in vari
ous states to maintain shoeing shops
where the farmers can be taught the
trade.
The lack of driving horses on the
highways now, Buckley said, is not
due so much to the fact that the auto
mobiles replaced them, but to the fact
that a man loving liis driving horse
would not risk driving him among
the automobiles. There is also a
serious shortage of men to shoe
horses, he said adding that the horse
shoes, in fear that the auto might put
him out of business entirely, has taken
ui) other lines of work, such as auto
repairing and weldnig. The black
smith trade ranks high in wages, he
said.
Speaking of the adaptability of the
horse to the trucking business Buck
ley cited statistics that a horse can
be used in this business at an ex
pense of 111 cents a mile, while car
rying 100 pounds of freight while the
automobile truck expense for the
same distance while carrying the
same weight is 25 cents.
Although conceeding that the horse
cannot completely replace the auto
truck, Buckley maintains it can be
used in more classes of work and
that the larger firms are now using
both and that large numbers of busi
ness firms have already replaced
trucks with horses.
"The next few years will see Old
Dobbin's vindication," he said.
