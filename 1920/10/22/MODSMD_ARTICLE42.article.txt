# "500" DECORATIONS OFFICIALLY REMOVED
## 
### 
Until last spring Sequoia Hall was
decorated by the banner "Roble Hall."
The men of Sequoia put up a canvas
banner with the proper inscription.
Yesterday the first official notice of
this action was taken and a real ban
ner put up, by the Comptroller's
orders. The inscription of the "500"
in Sequoa Hall is now ended.
