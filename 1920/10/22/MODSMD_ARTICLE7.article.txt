SAN MATEO, Oct. 22.â€”Work has
been commenced on the Pacific Stu
dios corporation site here where
twelve motion picture studios are to
be erected.
The location is especially desirable
because it affords a background for
the "shooting" of almost any kind of
outdoor picture. Not far away is the
ocean. Nearby is an island, almost
uninhabited. A few miles away are
the foothills.
