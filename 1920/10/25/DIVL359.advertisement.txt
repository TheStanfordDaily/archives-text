J You are so used to being asked that *
| question that you wonder if it really can j
% be done. Here is one opportunity for %
% you that will bear investigation. |
3 There is a reason, and a logical one too j
| for this: First, we buy direct from the %
J importer. No broker comes between Z
J us to get his fancy profit. Second, our *
j overhead expense is exceedingly low, J
% and that makes it possible for us to sell t
J on a closer margin of profit. And third, *
t we are content to sell and make a fair +
+ profit, and thus sell more. This policy %
J will make us many friends, and help to t
5 increase our business. t
t We can and do sell Diamonds for Less! ?
