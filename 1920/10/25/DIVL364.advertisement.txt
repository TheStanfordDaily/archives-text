r"\ON'T take a fellow's pipe. Take some other possession.
® Because wrapped up in his pipe is a fellow's peace of li'i;:'
mind, his relaxation, his contentment. This is more than
true if it's a W D C Pipe, because then a good smoke is multi
plied many times over. Our special seasoning process takes
care of this by bringing out all the sweetness and mellowness
of the genuine French briar. Just you go to any good dealer
and select several good shapes. Put them in your rack.
Smoke a cool one every time, and you'll be well on your
way to pipe-happiness.
