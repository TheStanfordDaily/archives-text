# STANFORD ARTILLERY UNIT HAS NUMBERS NEEDED TO CONTINUE
## 
### 
Continuance of the Stanford Field
Artillery Unit is now a certainty. The
War Department requires that at least
one hundred men in a university take
the work or the question is raised
whether it should be dropped. The Stan
ford unit has exceeded the one hundred
mark of enrollment and indications point
to still further increase in numbers.
Major Leroy P. Collins, head of the
unit, declares that Stanford is in every
way better adapted to field artillery
work than any other university in the
country. Out of the 22 institutions that
have Ik Id artillery R. O. T. C. units
Stanford and Oregon Agriculture Col
lege are the only ones on the Pacific
Coast. The work can be conducted all
the year round here while in the east
ern colleges weather conditions forec
them to suspend operations during cer
tain parts of the year. The topography
of this section is also much more favor
able for field artillery work than it is
in other parts of the country.
Equipment of the Stanford unit is
complete and of the best kind. Last
year there were only sixty horses but
this year theer is a string of ninety. Polo
is one of the new branches of the work
that is finding favor among members of
the unit. The Board of Athletic Control
lias this year appropriated $250 for
further polo equipment.
Since field artillery work is becoming
largely motorized the students are given
an insight into technical work. The
work is of such a nature, however, that
any normal student can take it and un
derstand it. Besides all the practical ad
vantages the course offers the men in
it they also receive a remuneration from
the government to compensate them for
participating in the work.
