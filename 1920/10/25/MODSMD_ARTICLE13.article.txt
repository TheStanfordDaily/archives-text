# MAC SWINEY DIES AFTER PROLONGED HUNGER STRIKE
## Death Comes to Lord-Mayor of Cork, at Dawn of His Seventy-Fourth Day of Fast 
### United Press 
LONDON, Oct. 25. — Terrance Mac-
Swiney died at Brixton prison this
morning without regaining conscious
ness, at the dawn of the seventy-fourth
day of his hunger strike. Mrs. Mac-
Swiney is prostrated and has been re
moved to a private home by friends.
hears that a demonstration might be
started seemed to have been dissipated
when no unusual crowds materialized.
Those that appeared seemed more cur
ious than excited. MacSwiney's last
days were painful and harrowing. He
had lain packed in hot water bottles.
During a delirious spell a few days ago
he was fed for the first time. Upon
regaining •consciousness he was so en
raged that he wore himself out. An
inquest will probably be held today.
Terence MacSwiney, Lord-Mayor of
Cork, had been imprisoned on a
technical charge which he considered
unjust. The Lord-Mayoh voiced pro
test by refusing food in any form. The
eleven other prisoners with him im
mediately joined the strike, and three
deaths have already resulted.
Mrs. MacSwiney and the sisters of
the martyred mayor were in constant
attendance upon his cot, and the news
of his death, the breaking tension,
caused his widow to collapse.
Several days ago. the scurvy began
to evidence the approaching end, and
during the ensuing uncinsciousness
the prison doctors gave the dying man
juices of meat. Stimulated by this,
he regained consciousness, and dis
covered the fact. It was the rage
which this threw him into that, in
his weakened condition, caused the
death.
The British Government, having be
fore been forced to move MacSwiney
from the Cork prison because of the
frt'q' °nt demonstrations, re-enforced
the guard today at Brixton jail. There
has been a largf crowd at all times
in front of the building, varying in
emotion, but fortunately for the ad
ministration the present one seems
not as belligerent as curious. It is
generally expected that the death
will cause fresh and more violent
outbreaks among the revolting Irish.
