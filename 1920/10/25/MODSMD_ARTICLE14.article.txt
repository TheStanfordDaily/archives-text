The Symphony Committee of Stan

is ready to announce a series of con

Orchestra, in the expectation that
such a series may become a perma
nent feature of the University calen
dar. and an annual contribution to the
musical life of the whole community.
The idea originated in the student
musical clubs, and the members of
the Glee Club, Schubert Club, and
Orchestra are backing up the series
with all their energies, with the pri
mary object of arousing more inter
est in the best music in the student
body.
It is an encouraging fact that the
project is, to this extent, a student
enterprise. With the advice and co
operation of members of the faculty
and friends of the University, a
Symphony Committee was formed last
week, with Professor W. F. Durand
as chairman; Professor L. E. Bassett,
secretary, and Professor A. C. What
aker, treasurer. Dr. I). Charles Gard
ner will act as chairman of the exe
cutive committe working with the
officers of the Musical Clubs and
others. Mrs. Clifford Allen, the en
ergetic chairman of the finance com
mittee, has won the interest of the
friends of the project who have sub
scribed over $1,000 to a guarantee
fund so that the financial part of the
venture is fully assured. Other mem
bers of the Committee are Miss Alice
Kimball, Secretary of the Peninsula
Musical Association, Warren D. Allen.
University Organist, and the officers of
the Glee and Schubert Clubs.
Season tickets will be offered for
two concerts, the first of which will
probably take place in December. The
full ensemble of eighty artists under
Alfred Hertz, conductor, will give two
of the finest symphonic programs ever
heard here, and on one of the pro
grains the Stanford Glee Club will
sing a group of classics by Rachmani
noff, Beethoven, and Grieg, with or
chestral accompaniment.
Following the lead of the Harvard
Gli o Club, the men of Stanford are
aiming to do their part in raising the
standards of college musical pro
grams. The Stanford Club appeared
with great fun; ess last Easter with
both Los Angeles Symphony Orchest
ras, with the Los Angeles Orchestra

harmonic Orchestra in Trinity Audi
torium. Their appearance here will
add a fresh and vigorous note to the
program, and is already stimulating
the pride and interest of their fellow
student,! in the whole series.
