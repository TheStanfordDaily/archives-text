## Professor Visits Salmon Canneries to See If Native Food Being Depleted by Industry 
### 
Dr. Charles H. Gilbert, head of the
Zoology Department at Stanford, has re
turned to the Campus after a tour of
inspection of the salmon industry on the
Yukon River which has occupied his
time since the early part of last May.
The purpose of his study was to dis
cover whether or not the canneries at
the mouth of the Yokon were deplet
ing the river of salmon, upon which
the natives in the interior depend,
and whether their operations ouabt
to be discontinued or restricted.
Last year a law was passed by
Congress to stop the work of the can
neries, but was held up pending the re
port that Dr. Gilbert and his contem
poraries now have ready but will not
make public until word is received from
Washington.
Dr. Gilbert left Seattle on May 7, took
the 11r>t steamer down the Yukon. Thev
broke the ice as they went, and after
they had gone as far as the steamer could
go they boarded gasoline launches and
ascended the river for 4,000 miles. Dr.
Gilbert made a careful inspection of the
canneries and an accurate census of all
the salmon caught. His return home was
delayed by the rush of tourists and of
others coming out of Alaska for the
winter.
