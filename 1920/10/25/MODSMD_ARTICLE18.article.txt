## 
### 
F. E. Morgan, general Secretary of
the "S M. C. A. on the campus, took up
in a discussion group Sunday morning
in the Memorial Church, the relation of
science to religion. This group is open
to all but first-year students and deals
not only with the physical science as
geology, astronomy and biology, but also
the sciences of psychology and sociology.
It is a co-ordination of present day
science and religion.
Professor R. G. Trotter's group is
studying the life of Christ from the
modern viewpoint. The other groups
are using "Students Standards of Ac
tion" as a textbook. Each chapter takes
up some phase of college life and ap
plies the principles of Christianity to it.
These groups are led by Newton Badcr.
a graduate student in Education; R. J.
Pryor, '21; and H. E. Raker, '21. Tlie
different groups also meet socially from
time to time.
