# DEBATE QUESTIONS TO BE CONSIDERED THIS AFTERNOON
## 
### 
Questions for the annual debate be
tween Stanford and the University of
California will be telephoned from Ber
keley this afternoon by C. C. Hildebrand,
California's debating representative.
The questions, which will be received by
W. F. Leiser. '21, Stanford Debating
Manager, will be considered immediately
upon their receipt. Tryouts for the
Stanford team will be held at once if
a suitable question is offered.
Arrangements have been made to hold
the annual contest later in the season
than has heretofore been the custom
owing to the. late decision on the ques
tion. California, however, has entered
upon the season's work already by hold
ing tryouts and picking a final team.
Last season's discussion was won by
California. Adoption of the Plumb Flan
by the United States was the theme of
the argument. Stanford upheld the
affirmative of the question.
Several experienced speakers have an
nounced their intertions of competing in
the coming tryouts. In view of that fact
that more than the usual number of
seasoned debaters have returned this
year, the honors for places on the Stan
ford team will be hotly contested. The
time and place of the tryouts will be
announced at an early date.
