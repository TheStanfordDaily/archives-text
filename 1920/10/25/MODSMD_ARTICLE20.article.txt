# Santa Clara Men Fail to Show Reputed Form
## STANFORD SQUAD BEATS OPPONENTS TO TUNE OF 21-7 Cardinal Combination is Too Strong for Opposing Team; Patrick and Righter Stars 
### 
Head work, hard kicking, and steady
grinding upset the prevalent football
dope and gave Stanford victory over
the Santa Clara eleven last Saturday
by a 21-7 score. With only four min
utes left to play an unlucky fumble al
lowed the Missionites their only touch
down and prevented the Cardinal from
scoring a shutout.
Coach Powell's team started with a
combination materially stronger than
that of any previous battle. The first
touchdown came after two successful
forward passes when the game was but
six minutes old.
In the first periods Stanford was un
able to gain through the Santa Clara
line, while the Missionites seemed
stronger and made yardage through the
Cardinal guards and tackles. Stanford
consequently played a punting game
which soon tired their opponents of line
bucks and in the last half was able to
penetrate the Missionite defense almost
at will.
"Swede" Righter back at his old po
sition at center was accountable for a
fifty per cent improvement in the Stan
ford line. He not only stopped all line
bucks through center, but went through
the Mission line to smother play after
play. His offensive work was respons
ible for a considerable amount of Stan
ford's yardage gained.
Jack Patrick and Bob Schlaudeman
were the outstanding features in the
backfield, while Campbell, Arnett. and
Woollomes made their share of gains.
Patrick made fifteen yards for Stan
ford on every exchange of punts, aver
aging over forty yards to the boot. He
gained consistently through the line in
the last half, and carried the ball over
for two of the Cardinal touchdowns.
Schlaudeman played a heady game at
quarter, and was particularly noticeable
in running back punts. He made a
sensational sixty yard run just before
the final gun.
The game summary shown the Card
inal excelling in nearly every depart
ment.

play. His offensive work was respons
ible for a considerable amount of Stan
ford's yardage gained.
Jack Patrick and Bob Schlaudeman
were the outstanding features in the
backfield, while Campbell, Arnett. and
Woollomes made their share of gains.
Patrick made fifteen yards for Stan
ford on every exchange of punts, aver
aging over forty yards to the boot. He
gained consistently through the line in
the last half, and carried the ball over
for two of the Cardinal touchdowns.
Schlaudeman played a heady game at
quarter, and was particularly noticeable
in running back punts. He made a
sensational sixty yard run just before
the final gun.
The game summary shown the Card
inal excelling in nearly every depart
ment.

Head work, hard kicking, and steady
grinding upset the prevalent football
dope and gave Stanford victory over
the Santa Clara eleven last Saturday
by a 21-7 score. With only four min
utes left to play an unlucky fumble al
lowed the Missionites their only touch
down and prevented the Cardinal from
scoring a shutout.
Coach Powell's team started with a
combination materially stronger than
that of any previous battle. The first
touchdown came after two successful
forward passes when the game was but
six minutes old.
In the first periods Stanford was un
able to gain through the Santa Clara
line, while the Missionites seemed
stronger and made yardage through the
Cardinal guards and tackles. Stanford
consequently played a punting game
which soon tired their opponents of line
bucks and in the last half was able to
penetrate the Missionite defense almost
at will.
"Swede" Righter back at his old po
sition at center was accountable for a
fifty per cent improvement in the Stan
ford line. He not only stopped all line
bucks through center, but went through
the Mission line to smother play after
play. His offensive work was respons
ible for a considerable amount of Stan
ford's yardage gained.
