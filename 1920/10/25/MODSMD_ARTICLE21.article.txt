# STANFORD SOCCER TEAM OVERWHELMS SAN FRANCISCANS
## 
### 
The Stanford soccer team overwhelm
ingly defeated the Columbia Clu of San
Francisco on the Stanford turf Satui
day by a score of 5 to 0. This is Stan
ford's second victory in the two games
played in the University-Club League.
Weller led in the scoring with three
goals, Mendoca and Peavey making one
each.
The result was never in doubt after
the first five minutes when Stanford
took the offensive. Tommy Greene
played a good game at outside right;
Clark, Robinson and Wing formed a
strong half-back line, feeding their for
wards well, and Adams and Anderson,
although not hard pressed, held the op
position's shots to a minimum. Columbia
had a brilliant defense but the forwards
did not do their share, the result being
that the defense crumbled early.
Their goal tender did some brilliant
work in the early stages of the game,
while for Stanford, Masters handled
some shots in the first half but had little
to do in the second.
Coach Harry Maloney has ordered the
squad practice five adys a week between
now and the California game. Calo
fornia has a larger squad practicing and
has had the advantage of an early start
so that Stanford has its work cut out
of the team is to defeat the Blue and
Gold.
