# THE 						TEMPLETON CASE
## 
### 
CONSIDERABLE discussion has arisen over the action of Stanford
athletic authorities in declaring "Dink" Templeton eligible for Amer
ican football this fall, and insinuatons have been made that Stanford
has not acted farly in the deal. The only answer that can be made to
these charges is: "Read the rules." Dr. Browne, president of the
Pacific Coast Conference, has written a statement on the case, which
appears in The Daily Palo Alto today, and which contains an explana
tion of the Conference rules applying to Templeton's case. Dr. Browne
is the only official in the Conference who has been connected with the
organization since its origin, and he is presumably qualified to interpret
its rules.
