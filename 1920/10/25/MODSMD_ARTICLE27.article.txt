BERLIN, Oct. 25. —Death sometimes

merchant, recently touring Austria,
j Hungary and Germany, tells an in
cident that is typical of the once gay
1 Austrial capital.
j He went into a home where a mere
; slip of a girl was the housewife for a
; family of six. Seeing her poverty, he
| gave her some money. Tears stood
| in her eyes as she thanked him, add

"That is beautiful. Now, we can
have something to eat until Satur
day. Father's pay isn't enough for
us all; it always runs out by Thurs
day and then we go hungry until
Saturday.
"Mother and one of the sisters died;
they couldn't stand it any more. It's
sau —but it gives us more room, for
we all have to cook and wash and
sleep in this one room. That's the
only way to keep warm in the winter."
That is fairly typical, says Filene.
They live and suffer and die in one
room. Goal is the ultimate answer
to all of Austria's present trouble,
says Feline, who believes that the
same agencies which made Austria
an island in the midst of eastern Eu
rope should see to it that she is pro
vided with the means of livelihood
—namely, coal sufficient to run her
industries, plus the opportunity to ex
port these goods when made.
Some scheme, such as administra
i tion by the League of Nations or other

international tribunal, must look after
Austria's case, lie believes. He would
not say directly whether he favored a
junction of Austria and Germany.
Austria is destined for another ter
rible winter, he believes. This view
is also shared by American Relief
Administration oflicials long engaged
in child relief work in Austria. While
original plans call for gradual retreat
from European work, it is now found
that 300,000 children must be cared
for in the food line this winter and
that 100,000 must be clothed.
Meantime, there is considerable agi
tation in Austria for a reuniting with
Germany, the advocates of this plan
holding that Austria would then have
access to coal and would have an open
route for its exports. As it is now.
she is hemmed in by unfriendly groups
and unable to get the materials for her
industry.
