After the straw ballot last Wednes
day, it is time to revamp the old
wheeze about the anxious parent who
said: "Don't stuff yourself, Willie,
you're no ballot box."

Campus politicians must be prepar
ing for a well-stuffed bird Thanks
giving, whispers Kilp. They had a lot
of practice on the ballot box Tuesday.

IN UMBRELLASTAN
We notice as we came up to Roble
the other night that, the old Umbrella
Racks are back in place again. We
had to stand up, however, because the
criss-cross seats were still in the shop
after some of the queeners with their
heavy dates had crashed through them
last spring quarter.
Why not start a riot in the Cabbage
Column for the return of these seats
and the installation of steam heat
pipes so that we can carry on the
winter campaign with comfort?

( Delta Gamma arises in its majesty
and solemnly declares that it is still
alive and kicking. May we now ex
pect the Business Office to beat the
tom-tom on Engineering Corner and
announce that the report of its death
is highly exaggerated.—Killy.

Dear Ed. de Cabbage:
Here's an old one that must have
been written by the man who first
had an eight o'clock:
"The scarest, rarest thing in all the
world is Time."
Right! Especially about 0:30 a.m.

In Transit
Wednesday night, "Daily" has edi
torial entitled, "On the Boat."
Thursday night, "Daily" has another
called "On the Bandwagon."
Friday night—Aw, we'd rather walk
anyway!—Kilp.

It holds good now just as it did in
old Noah's day, yourstrulys N. G. Any
one not "On the Boat" stands a good
chance of getting wet.

A rival has at last appeared for the
perennial notice to the Juniors that
the last, chance to take their class pic
tures is positively at hand, cables
Killy It. is "Make application for a
Big Game ticket before Friday even
ing."
