## 
### United Press 
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 25.â€”While
democrats would not listen to the sug
gestion, that seemed to he the greater
number of .western political observers
today favored the prediction of repub
lican year west of the Rocky Mountains.
California, Oregon, and Washington,
these dopsters figured, will be found iii
the Harding column on November 2.
Nevada and Arizona probably will In
solidly for Cox. Montana was counted
as close but probably for Harding, and
Idaho was expected to follow the lead
of Senator Borad into the Harding
camp.
Two months ago California would
have been classed as doubtful, many de
clared, but recent utterances of Senator
Hiram Johnson, and an intensive cam
paign are believed to have swung the
state in line for the republican leader,
despite its peculiar performance of four
years ago.
Not only is the Pacific coast expected
to lean towards the republican presid
tial ticket but the indications favor the
sending of a republican delegation from
the far west to both house and senate.
Democratic senatorial incumbents in
three states are being forced into spirit
ed contests for their seats.
In California Senator James D.
Phelan, democrat, and Samuel Short
ridge, republican, are engaged in a nip
and tuck race for Phelan's seat. The
result appeared a bit doubtful with the
advantage, if any, with Shortridge.
Arizona, normally democratic, is the
scene of another stifif fight for the sen
atorship with Ralph Cameron, republi
can, battling Senator Marc Smith, dem
ocratic members from Arizona, for
twenty-two years.
In Oregon Senator George Chamber
lain, democrat, is engaged in the hard
est battle of his career for re-election
against Robert N. Stanfield, republican.
Chamberlain, however, was figured as
having a little the best of it, despite a
heavy republican registration.
Washington is expected to send back
to the senate Wesley L. Jones, republi
can, by a big margin.
In Montana and Idaho no senators are
to be elected.
