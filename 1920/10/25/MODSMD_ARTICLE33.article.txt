# COMMISSION REPORTS ON NATURAL RESOURCES

### United Press 
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 25.—Point
ing out that California will not reach
the peak of development unless its
natural resources are carefully foster
ed and uniiized, the state railroad com
mission in its annual report, trans
mitted to Governor Stephens today,
urges a survey of the state's water and
power resources.
The report recalls that California re
cently was "confronted with a situa
tion which threatened the very core
of its prosperity."
"We are of the opinion that in no
other way can the great resources of
our state be developed of its full pos
sibilities realized than through the
conservation and proper distribution
of water —its most valuable crop."
Attention is called to the fact that
statistics show less than half of the
total area of arable lands susceptible
of irrigation has an available water
supply.
"Any halt] in the state's hydro-elec
tric development," the commission in
forms the governor, will spell dis
aster. The commission says the
state's paramount need is cheap power.
"The water shortage," asserts the
commission on this point, "was res
ponsible for an enormous increase in
oil consumption, the diminished sup
ply demanding more steam-made elec
tricity. So great was the oil consump
tion that a new record was established.
It was estimated that 0,000,000 barrels
of oil will be used in 1920' as against,
an average consumption in normal
years of about 5,000,000 barrels."
Discussing the problem confronting
the electric railway system of the
state, the commission declares it is
apparent the time is by no means
here when cities and rural territories
can dispense with electric railway fa
cilities. The automobile stage, the
jitney and the privately owned auto
mobile are not a substitute for the
street railway or the electric inter
urban railway, says the commission.
