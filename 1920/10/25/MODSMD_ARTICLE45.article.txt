### 
Euphronia Debating Society has today
completed its plans for the debate which
is to be held between Ex-governor Gil
lett and U. S. Senator Pittman of Ne
vada. in the Women's Clubhouse on
Wednesday night. The subject has been
definitely decided upon as "The Issues ot
the Present Campaign," but the special
topic of the debate will no doubt he
the League of Nations. Each speaker
will be allotted twenty-five minutes for
the main speech and ten minutes for
rebuttal.
In securing this debate for Stanford
University, the Euphronia Debating So
ciety had done what no other western
university has been able to do, and has
been able to choose from among the
best men of both parties. Euphronia has
been aranging this discussion without
my party prejudices, and lias had the
hearty co-operation of both the Repub
lican and Democratic National Commit
tees.
Euphronia announces that Dr. David
Starr Jordan had consented to preside
over Wednesday's meeting. Dr. Jordan
is recognized throughout the country as
an impartial authority on the political
conditions of the nation.
A reception committee has been ap
pointed by Euphronia to escort the two
speakers to the place of meeting. The
debate will commence promptly at 7:50
on Wednesday evening. All Stanford
and Palo Alto voters, students and
faculty of the university, are cordially
invited to attend the meeting.
