# DR. BROWNE EXPLAINS PLAYER'S ELIGIBILITY
## Misapprehension Concerning 'Dink' Templeton' Cleared Up by Physical Director 
### 
Misapprehension conerning Dink Tem.
pleton's eligibility to play football has
been cleared up by a statement issued
this morning by L)r. A. 13. Browne,
chairman of the Faculty Athletic Com
mittee and President of the Pacific Coast
Conference. Tcmpleton's ability as a
drop-kicker and punter inspired much
confidence with the recent announcement
that he would be able to play. Dr.
Browne is the oldest member of the
Pacific Coast Conference and probably
the best able to pass judgment on a
question of this kind.
"In view of the newspaper publicity re
cently given to Tcmpleton's eligibility
it is only fair to him as well as to the
fair name of Stanford that the Confer
ence rules be explained as far as Tcm
pleton's case is concerned.
"The Conference has jurisdiction over
certain intercollegiate sports. The first
two years of th? Conference only Ameri
can football, track, baseball, crew and
basketball were recognized. Other sports
such as soccer and tennis were added
from year to year. Rugby, like soccer
and wrestling, is a different sport from
American football and never has been
recognized by the Conference. Tcm
pleton's participation in rugby does not
count for American football participa
tion under the rule of "four years' par
ticipation in a sport if the student was
registered prior to December Ist, 1915."
"Templeton registered in 1914. He is
allowed four years of participation un
der this rule. Another part of the rule
states that the four years must come
within five years after registration. On
the face of this rule it looks as if Tem
nleton is ineligible, but on December 3d
1917, the Conference voted that any stu
dent entering any line of Federal service
in the war shall be given the athletic
standing at the close of the war that he
held on the date of his withdrawal from
college. Templeton was in the Federal
service one year and four months, which
period, if deducted from the total year?
since his first registration, gives him this
fall term for participation in intercolle
giate athletics.
"Templeton is ineligible for all inter
collegiate athletics after the. close of the
fall term, 1920.
