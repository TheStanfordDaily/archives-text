## 
### 
The Blue and Gold warriors again
demonstrated their ability to run up a
large score by tramping 011 the Univer
sity of Utah aggregation. Saturday, to
the tune of 63-0. The Mormons at no
time became dangerous on their offens
ive plays, and the California backs had
little trouble in romping through the
Utah line. Nevertheless the P.ears cred
it the Utah men with putting up a hard
er light than any of the other elevens
which have given opposition to Califoi
nia this season.
The Oregon Aggies will battle Coach
Andy Smith's team next Saturday. The
\grieulturists defeated the University
of Washington players last week, and
will arrive at the Campanile expecting to
give California its first set-back.
