1 The Wilson Grill I
Have you ever compared the cost of our
grill lunch or dinner with similar meals else
jfj where?
| This service is so distinctively different that
many other cafes are trying to adopt it.
It means a substantial, well-balanced meal $
| of deliciously prepared food at moderate
I prices. |
For example, Wednesday: j|
Veal Porterhouse, smothered with |
Mush ooms. ®
Served with three other vegetables.
You'll find it irresistible.
