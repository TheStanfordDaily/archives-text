Mrs. Fox was bragging one day about the
large number of her cubs.
"How many cubs do you bring into the
world at one time?" she asked the LIONESS.
"Only ONE," replied the Lioness —"but it s
a LION."
MURADS COST 20 CENTS for a BOX
of 10 —BUT THEY'RE MURADS!
MURADS would be lower priced if we left out all
or part of the 100/2 Turkish tobaccos of the purest and
best varieties grown —or if we substituted inferior grades
of Turkish tobacco.
But they wouldn't be MURADS —they'd only be
Foxes!
"Judge for Yourself —!"
