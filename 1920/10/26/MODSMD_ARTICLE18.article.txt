# BRITISH RULE IN IRELAND HIT HARD BY DR. JORDAN
## 
### JESSES E. THRASH, '21 
"There is no wisdom of any kind in
the policy adopted by Great Britain
toward Ireland. The history of the
whole Irish affair is a story of mis
takes, blunders, and political machi
nations," declared Dr. David Starr
Jordan, Chancellor Emeritus of the
University when commenting today
on the present situation in Ireland.
Dr.. Jordan has made an extensive
study of the Irish question and is
serving as a member of the Committee
of One Hundred on Ireland, which is
now selecting an impartial commission
(f five distinguished Americans to
make a public inquiry into the con
ditions in that country. Sessions of
the commission are to begin in Wash;
ington in November.
A Public Investigation
It is the hope of the committee, ac
cording to Dr. Jordan, to make a com
plete detailed and reliable public in
vestigation of affairs in Ireland as
they exist at the present time and to
make a public report to the people of
the United States. The British gov
ernment lias p. omised its co-operation
in the matter and has promised to
permit anyone to come to America to
testify before the commission.
It is hoped that a neutral and im
partial inquiry under American auspi
ces will bring out facts that will sug
gest a way to restoration and peace
in Ii eland.
In the light of coming investigation
the opinions of Dr. Jordan in the
Irish question arid relations of Eng
land and Ireland are unusually inter
esting.

Independence Only Solution
In the opinion of Dr. Jordan, Irish
affairs have now reached a stage,
which culminated in the # hunger strike
and death of Lord Mayor MacSwiney,
that cannot be settled by ordinary
measures or by means that would
have been effective a few years ago.
"The only solution that I can see
at the present time," the Chancellor
said, "is to let that, part of Ireland
that wants to drop out of the British
Empire drop out and let. the rest re
main. Ireland should have been
given the same government as Can
ada years ago, but it is very likely
that it is now too late to solve the
problem in that manner."
Cites South African Example
"The British should have done with
Ireland years ago what they did with
South Africa. Let them say, 'we have
conquered you, but you are going to
live here. We will take our armies
out and let you run things. The only
requirement we ask is that the kill
ing of Englishmen stop.'
"Armies are useful to throw out
other armies, as was the case in
throwing the Hun out of Belgium, but
you cannot hold down a people by
force of arms."
In 1914 Dr. Jordan made a visit to
Ireland and looked carefully into con
ditions existing there at that time.
Many of his impressions and ideas
were recorded by him in his autobio
graphy which is now being written.
At the time of his visit to Ireland,
Dr. Jordan had occasion to become
well acquainted with Sir Horace Plun
kett. whom he characterizes as the
