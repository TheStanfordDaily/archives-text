# BRITISH RULE IN IRELAND HIT HARD BY DR. JORDAN
## 
### JESSES E. THRASH, '21 
"There is no wisdom of any kind in
the policy adopted by Great Britain
toward Ireland. The history of the
whole Irish affair is a story of mis
takes, blunders, and political machi
nations," declared Dr. David Starr
Jordan, Chancellor Emeritus of the
University when commenting today
on the present situation in Ireland.
Dr.. Jordan has made an extensive
study of the Irish question and is
serving as a member of the Committee
of One Hundred on Ireland, which is
now selecting an impartial commission
(f five distinguished Americans to
make a public inquiry into the con
ditions in that country. Sessions of
the commission are to begin in Wash;
ington in November.
A Public Investigation
It is the hope of the committee, ac
cording to Dr. Jordan, to make a com
plete detailed and reliable public in
vestigation of affairs in Ireland as
they exist at the present time and to
make a public report to the people of
the United States. The British gov
ernment lias p. omised its co-operation
in the matter and has promised to
permit anyone to come to America to
testify before the commission.
It is hoped that a neutral and im
partial inquiry under American auspi
ces will bring out facts that will sug
gest a way to restoration and peace
in Ii eland.
In the light of coming investigation
the opinions of Dr. Jordan in the
Irish question arid relations of Eng
land and Ireland are unusually inter
esting.

Independence Only Solution
In the opinion of Dr. Jordan, Irish
affairs have now reached a stage,
which culminated in the # hunger strike
and death of Lord Mayor MacSwiney,
that cannot be settled by ordinary
measures or by means that would
have been effective a few years ago.
"The only solution that I can see
at the present time," the Chancellor
said, "is to let that, part of Ireland
that wants to drop out of the British
Empire drop out and let. the rest re
main. Ireland should have been
given the same government as Can
ada years ago, but it is very likely
that it is now too late to solve the
problem in that manner."
Cites South African Example
"The British should have done with
Ireland years ago what they did with
South Africa. Let them say, 'we have
conquered you, but you are going to
live here. We will take our armies
out and let you run things. The only
requirement we ask is that the kill
ing of Englishmen stop.'
"Armies are useful to throw out
other armies, as was the case in
throwing the Hun out of Belgium, but
you cannot hold down a people by
force of arms."
In 1914 Dr. Jordan made a visit to
Ireland and looked carefully into con
ditions existing there at that time.
Many of his impressions and ideas
were recorded by him in his autobio
graphy which is now being written.
At the time of his visit to Ireland,
Dr. Jordan had occasion to become
well acquainted with Sir Horace Plun
kett. whom he characterizes as the
wise man of Ireland. Plunkett, he
says, is the most self-contained man
in Ireland. He characterizes Plun
kett's chief co-worker, the poet aud
publicist, George Russell, as one of
the best men in the country.
Carson a Lord of Misrule
In contrast to these men he char
acterizes Sir Edward Carson, member
of the English Cabinet and a member
of Parliament from Ulster, as the
most powerful of the lords of misrule.
"His evident motive in 1914," he
says "was to overthrow liberalism in
order to restore to the House of Lords
its power of veto, using the threat of
the Ulster rebellion in order to for
ward their schemes at Westminster.
"You never find Sir Edward Carson
dodging around," the Chancellor de
clared, "he is always on one side
and that is the side of sin."
Question of Relation
"The question in Ireland is not one
of better government or worse," Dr.
Jordan writes in his autobiography.,
"but lather that of relation of gov
ernment to the people. It may be that
the group of British agerts who fill
"Dublin Castle" know better what is
good for Ireland raid the Irish them
selves. But unless the Irish believe
and fully accept the proposition, and
commission them to carry it out, the
regime cannot be made good.
"The Irish question has long been

aggravated by half measures, by
fawning kindness anil by reckless at
tempts at direct action The very
fact that every move toward allowing
Irish freedom has taken the form of
redress of grievances lias always been
itself a grievance of the first magni
tude. The Irish have said, 'Men will
take injustice standing up; but few
will take justice lying down." To get
justice is to help create it.
No British statesman has ever had
a chance to meet Ireland fairly, for ,
every one who has tried to do it has
been balked by the ultra-conservative I
element. The British Tories have sys-'
tematically played on the prejudices
of Ulster in the interests of the pri
vileged in London.
Economic Aid Needed
"It is along material lines that ilrst
aid to Ireland must be given. Spiritu
al elevation is not rooted in poverty,
squalor, hunger and ignorance. The
exigencies of Imperial politics thrust
Ireland into poverty. The virtues of
self-respect and self-reliance will arise
through self-extrication from long
standing evils. Poverty weakens the
energies of life; it is the cause of
ignorance, unsanitation, unthrift, and
violence with which Ireland has been
so long accursed.
"Ireland can recover in but one
wayâ€”that is by taking hold of her
future herself. No middle ground ex
ists between slavery and freedom.
Ireland belongs to the Irish and her
problems must be solved the Irish way.
The future of the great British Com
monwealth must lie in friendly rela
tions between the whole and self
determination of each of its parts.
