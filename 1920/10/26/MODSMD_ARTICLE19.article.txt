# Stanford Eleven Will Meet Oregon Players in First P.C.C. Game
## STRONG NORTHERN SQUAD WILL PLAY HERE ON SATURDAY Coach Powell's Combination of Players Uncertain, Due to Several Injured Men 
### 
The Stanford football eleven will
play its iirst Pacific Coast Conference
game next Saturday afternoon, when
the Cardinal team will get up against
the University of Oregon team on the
local football turf at 3 o'clock. The
University of Southern California
freshmen will scrimmage with the
Stanford first-year team as a prelimi
nary match, at 1:30 o'clock.
Oregon has one of the strongest
teams in the Northwest this year and
will be a dangerous opponent for the
Cardinal. Last year the University
of Oregon was chosen to meet Har
vard in the "Tournament of Roses."
This season's team lacks only four of
these veterans. Bill Steers, their star
quarterback and punter, returned to
College three weeks ago, and will be
in condition to play against Stanford.
With Templeton exchanging punts
with Steers, spectators are assured
of numerous thrills.
The Cardinal's chances for a vic
tory will depend largely upon the
condition of Coach Powell's men and
what kind of a line-up he will be able
to start. Even though the coach is
able to play a good substitute for some
player the more men out of the game
the weaker the reserve to fall back
upon. Captain "Art" Wilcox, who
was out of the Santa Clara game with
an injured shoulder will probably be
in condition for next Saturday's con
test. Helser will probably be alright
again. Jack Patrick sustained an in
jured shoulder-muscle early in the
Santa Clara game, and although play
ing the entire game, is now 011 the
doubtful list for the Oregon game.
Templeton will undoubtedly know the
varsity signals by Saturday and will
work in his old position.
The game against the Mission Col
lege gave the coach a keener insight
on the playing of the different candi
dates for the team, and he will spend
the remainder of the week drilling t.h<>
backfield in these minor defects.
Coach Carpenter will give his entire
time this week in the building of a
stronger line for the Oregon men to
try to drill through.
Last night the men were only dril
led in a light signal practice and will
probably be given only a light work
out this evening. Tomorrow afternoon
the Coach will have his men buck up
against the freshman eleven in a prac
tice scrimmage, which is being plan
ned both for practice and to keep the
bleachers entertained during a bleach
er rally, which has been called by
Yell Leader Wendell Kinney.
Kinney stated this morning that he
hoped the students â€¢ would make a
better showing before the football
men than they did in the bleacher
rally last week. Only a few hundred
reported for that rally. It is hoped
that the entire student body will show
up tomorrow at 4 o'clock and give the
team a big send-off for the first Con
ference match.
