# AMENDMENT TWELVE
## 
### 
THE University of California places its future in the hands of the State
ne«t Tuesday when it will ask the voters to support the measure ap
pearing as No. 12 on the ballot. This amendment provides a direct ad
valorem tax on all property in the State, excepting that of corporations,
amounting to 1 2-10 mills, which would realize a revenue of approxi
mately four million dollars a year.
At present the University of California is the largest university in
America and is caring for its enormous increase in numbers on funds
provided for about half of its total registration. As a State university
it is the duty of the trans-bay institution to provide educational facilities
for all California students who wish to register there. The university
authorities are doing their best now to accommodate the entire registra
tion, but adequate facilities to handle the students are lacking, and if
the university is to perform its educational obligations properly it must
have more money to make the needed additions and enlargements.
Opponents of the measure have made much of the argument that
control of the university will be taken from the people and that the
Regents of the university will have too much power. In the many years
that the Regents have controlled the policy of the University of California
there has been no question as to their fitness and capability to run the
university. The State Legislature has nominally controlled the institu
tion, but in reality the Regents have exercised the controlling powers,
and they have been successful.
Under the proposed amendment the people will still have a check
over the Regents through the Legislature, for the State will at any
time have the right to investigate the expenditure by the university of
all money raised by the amendment. The Regents' control of funds will
be the same as that vested in the hands of any board' of education for
school purposes. These boards may spend funds subject to investigation
by legislative bodies.
President Barrows of the University of California says in regard
to the measure:
"The various interests of the State are not satisfied with the
quality of the service we are giving. How could they be? Over
and over, new desires and new needs and requirements are raised
by the people. The University cannot meet them with its present
revenue. I attended, recently, a conference of educational people
of the State, and again there was the same complaint, that the
university has not developed its School of Education. It can't do
it. It has not the funds.''
The passage of Amendment Twelve is vital to the future of our
neighboring university, and The Daily Palo Alto strongly urges Stan
ford students to do all in their power to aid the University of California
in this crisis which it faces.
