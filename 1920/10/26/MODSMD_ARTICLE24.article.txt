# FOOTBALL RALLY
## 
### 
second bleacher rally of the football season will be held tomorrow
afternoon, and Yell Leader Kinney has asked the entire student body
to appear at the football field to practice yells for the Oregon game.
Stanford must develop its rooting section this year, and the only way it
can be done is by practice. A very small crowd showed up for the first
bleacher rally, and if the non-appearance of the rooters is a sign, the
Stanford spirit is dead.
Get out tomorrow and demonstrate that the. Stanford spirit is still
alive and kicking.
