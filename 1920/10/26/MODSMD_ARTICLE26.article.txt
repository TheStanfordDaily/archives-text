SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 26.—The
potency and value of moonshine whis
key as a cure for rheumatism was
established in the federal court here.
John Martin testified he was on
crutches when he first set his lip over
a beaker of liquid moonlight, but on
his third drink lie threw away his
crutches and was well.
"Hum," commented the judge as he
contemplated what one might throw
away with four drinks. "What did
that stuff cost you?"
"forty-four dollars a gallon," said
Martin.
"That's far too much, too much,"
meditated the court. "So your fine
will be only $.300."
Martin paid with a declaration that
it was worth $344 any day to get rid
of the rheumatism.
