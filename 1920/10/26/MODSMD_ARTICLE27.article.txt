### R.W. K 
If a rugby trip to Europe is the
training that produces a Patrick or
a Righter for the Santa Clara battle,
Killy thinks that we might well make
the pre-season training of the Varsity
a cource of instruction in the English
brand of ball.

The Professor Has His Little Joke
Professor Townley sprang a mean
one this morning, reports P. S. The
class in estronomy was just getting
snowed under by a succession of
parallaxes and perhelions when the
atmosphere was suddenly cleared by
the following:
An Irishman (of course) was being
shown the wonders of the heavens as
viewed through a telescope. He was
also told the location and size of such
stars and planets as Polaris, Mars,
Jupiter, and the like were ascertain
ed. Wonderment spread over his
features, and he expressed his doubts:
"Oi can see how they've found out
what their size is, and where they're
at, but, b'gorra, Oi can't see how they
found out what their names were!"

"WHOSE DOGS ARE YOU?"
We heard a frosh say last night that
he had gotten a stiff neck from sitting
in the Library and waiting for who
ever was standing on the glass in the
skylight to fall through. He said that
he now walks along the Quad with his
head up as if he were looking for
aeroplanes.—Q. T.

"Ever stop to think what a Bolshe
vist would do if he should suddenly
be precipitated into an Encina court?"
queries Tiny Tom. The only thing
worse for him outside of a shave
wouk' be a repetition of the bath
song from the "Ancient Mariner" ac
companied by a few bars of Ivory.

LET THERE BE LIGHT
Speaking of the H. C. L. and other
disadvantages, what's to stop the
campus from saving a little on the
light bill by having turned off the
other half of the time? —Tiny Tim.
