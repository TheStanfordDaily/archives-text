BERLIN, Oct. 26.—Millions of the
; German population can die for want
J of food, as against thousands during
j the blockade, unlass the nation takes
the strictest measures to meet its food
problems, according to Prof, von Gru
; ber of Munich, speaking before the
[ Scientific Congress at Bay Neuheim.
He contended that Versailles treaty
had robbed Germany of vital food
supply sources and that many were
condemned to death. He counselled
intensive production, greater applica
tion of fertilizers, and as moderate
i consumption as possible.
The idea that Germany could lean
on foreign lands for large food sup
plies, as it lias recently done, is de
; ceptive, he said. This system, he
1 pointed out, must come to an end some
time, due to the inability of the na
' tion to repay under its lowered valua
tion and due to its lowered productive
capacity traceable to decreased raw
materials.
"Will the agriculturist work for pa
per money?" he queried. "Is he will
| ing to put in 12 hours work while the
cities only work eight? Will he be
industrious when he sees the cities
idle —even against their will? If he
is unwilling to meet these conditions,
then hunger, bolshevism, anarchy will
come in Germany, dragging down with
them the 'kultur' of Germany as well
as that of the other lands of Europe."
Other speakers pointed out that the
development of nitrogen from the air
must be furthered to assist in fertiliz
>g the country.
Recent investigations show that
Germany is tending to extensive cul
tivation rather than intensive, due to
lack of fertilizers. That is to say,
farmers are letting some land lie fal
low to restore it, instead of restoring
to use of expensive fertilizers.
Incidentally a serious phase of the
food situation is that considerable
grain, fit for human consumption, is
being fed to cattle, since this is much
cheaper for the landlord than to sell
his grain for bread and then buy fod
der in the Ausland for his cattle at
the prevailing high prices.
