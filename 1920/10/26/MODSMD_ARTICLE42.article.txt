# Campaigning With Cox

With Governor Cox)
Weather men as a rule must be
Democrats. During the first two
months of Governor Cox's vigorous
stump campaign, only twice was rain
encountered, although the nominee
traveled from the Atlantic to the Pa
cific Oceans. Having the weather man
011 his side was a big asset, and ap
proximately 75 per cent of the Demo
cratic candidate's speeches were made
in the open air.
The rain of the first two months
came at Spokane and again at Seattle
and Tacoma, local Democrats there
hastening to explain that the rain sea
son was just beginning. Snow was
encountered in Wyoming, but it did
not interfere with meetings, as all
these were scheduled for indoors.
Not once during all his travels and
speeches has Governor Cox departed
from his practice of wearing a plain
business suit. He has attended
fashionable dinners and receptions
where full dress suits have been in
evidence, but the governor doesn't
have one in his traveling wardrobe.
"And I don't intend to," he said.
The same principle applies to the
food which the Democratic candidate
desires, according to John Stephenson,
chef of the private car, "Federal,"
used by Cox on all his tours.
"He wants plain simple food, and
has told me to leave all the fancy
frills off," the chef said. "Rice pud
ding is one of his favorite desserts,
but the engineers seem to be preju
dized against this dish. Twice I have
lost a pan full of pudding because
the train took a curve too fast. The
Governor's standard breakfast consists
of fruit, cereal, eggs with ham or
bacon, toast and coffee."
Cox attributes his good health in
a large measure to his practice of
eating simple food. When he attended
banquets he invariably passed up the
fancy food.
"As a result," he said, "I felt fine
during all my travels.
If Governor Cox is elected president,
dentists from the Atlantic to the Pa
cific may hang out this sign: "The
President's Dentist."
Just before the Governor started
his western tour, he broke off a tooth
on the seed of a blue plum. It could
not be fixed before his train left, and
as a result "the damage" had to be
repaired bit by bit as he made his big
swing around the circle. Chicago, St.
Paul, Portland, Salt Lake City, San
Francisco, Los Angeles, Omaha, and
Wichita dentists worked on it, and
even then Cox had to visit his dentist
upon his return to Dayton. At Wichita,
his dentist took some of the gloom out
of a dental visit by telling the Gov
ernor that he had "flopped from Hard
ing to Cox."
