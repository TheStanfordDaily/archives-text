# ENCINA MEN WILL HOLD ANNUAL PAJAMA PARADE
## All Old Features of Encina Pajamarino to Form Part of Parade to Roble and Row 
### 
Tomorrow evening the one annual
pee-rade which present day regulations
permit will hold sway on the campus
when the Knights of Encina don their
pajamas or borrow them £roni room
mates and circle the campus for the in
spection of the "500" and the disapproval
of the faculty. Encina Clubmen will
leave the Hall at 7:15 and after express
ing their contempt of the "studes" at the
Library will descend in force upon Roble
Hall. Private information, at present
unverified, states that bleacher space at
Roble is at a premium.
Following the performance before the
secreted gaze of Roble's inhabitants, the
Knights, decorated in directorie sheet
gowns will serpentine up one side of the
Row and coming down the other will
pass the Delta Upsilon house and en
camp at Old Man Sticky's.
"Red" Tauzer, who will head the
Clubmen in their night-shirt adventure,
assures the skeptical that the pee-rade
will lack none of the grotesque features
which have made the Pajamerino fa
mous in past years. A full moon will
reveal the weird costuming of the
Encina men for the gratification of the
campus natives.
Twenty-two previous pajamarinos have
left a rich heritage of tradition around
the sole pee-rade which remains of the
many before the official axe descended
upon initiation performances. The first
night-shirt gathering of the Encina clan
was in 1898 after the initial baseball
scrap with the University of California.
On a vacant lot on Folsom Street in
San Francisco, the Cardinal nine ran a
steam-roller over the Bruin baseballers.
When news of the victory reached En
cina, 220 of the cohorts left for Menlo
Park garbed in pajamas and met the
Cardinal nine with a rally which is
noted in Stanford history. With each
successive pee-rade variations have oc
curred which have transformed the
night-shirt spree into the Pajamarino
which will entertain the campus tomor
row night.
