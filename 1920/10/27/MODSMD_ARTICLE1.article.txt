# COACH POWELL TO HAVE NEW SHIFTS FOR OREGON GAME
## Patrick and McAlpine May Not Be in Condition for Contest on Saturday Afternoon 
### 
Coach Powell gave his players a
hard work-out and scrimmage against
the freshman 'and second varsity
elevens last night, preparing his toien
to meet the University of Oregon
team on the local field, Saturday aft
ernoon. Sevral new combinations
were tried out behind the closed doors
of secret practice. These plans will
be kept dark by the coach until Sat
urday's game.
Nearly a thousand rooters filled the
bleachers this afternoon to practice
Stanford's yells and songs. Yell
Leader Wendell Kinney and assistants
Connolloy and Seib had the rooters
wel in hand, and were pleased with
(lie afternoon's showing. The varsity
and the Babes met in a practice scrim
mage for the benefit of the specta
tors.
Fair weather is needed for a good
game with the northern team, because
of the superior weight of the visitors.
Oregon probably outweighs the Cardi
nal team by several pounds to the
man. Coach Powell is now working
to strengthen his team so that the
superiority in weight can be offset.
The Stanford line-up that will start
the game is somewhat doubtful, and
may remain in the dark for several
days, partly because of the shifting
of combination's and partly because of
the injuries to several of the play
ers sustained in the Santa Clara game.
While "Art" Wilcox is again work
ing out with backfield men, Jack Pat
lick is not reporting for practice in
uniform this week. He may not be

able to play until the game with the
University of Washington. Patrick
has a bad shoulder.
Campbell, Cravens and McAlpine
were given bad noses in the Mission
game. The former two aru reporting
for practice and will probably be in
the lineup against Oregon wearing
nose guards. McAlpine may not be
out for play until after Saturday's
game.
Righter, Pelouze and Templeton are
in fine shape and will undoubtedly be
in the starting lineup. Templeton
will ii 11 the kicking vacancy left by
the absence of Patrick. Punt ex
changes between Steers of Oregon and
Templeton of Stanford should be one
of the features of the game. Oregon
prides in saying that Steers si one of
the best kickers in the West.
The fact that the University of Ore
gon was the Western team to meet
Harvard at Pasadena last New Year's
day, assures Stanford of having a hard
fight before attaining a victory. The
players from the north will be 011 the
campus next Friday, and that after
noon will work out on the football
turf.
Special arrangements have been
made between the Daily Palo Alto
and the Oregon Agricultural College
Daily Barometer to send the results
of the Aggie-U.C. game which is to
be played at Corvallis Saturday. A
direct wire will carry the results to
the football field where they will be
announced to the rooters.
