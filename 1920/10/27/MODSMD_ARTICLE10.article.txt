# BOXING, WRESTLING AND FENCING EVENTS SECURED WITH 0. C.
## 
### 
Communication has been received
from the Olympic Club stating that they
desire a boxing, wrestling, and fencing
tournament in the near future. This
comes as a result of Coacli Malouey's
efforts to secure a tournament with the
club so as to try out his teams.
Although no definite date has been de
cided upon, the tournament will take
place sometime during the week follow
ing the big game. The Olympic Club has
expressed no preference as to where the
meets should take place and as the fenc
ing team went to San Francisco last
year it is very probable that the events
will lie run off in Encina Gymnasium.
If that is the case a slight charge ol
admittance will be made* to increase the
fund used to buy boxing and wrestling
materials.
There have been no boxing tourna
ments as yet, since the large number of
men out have made it impossible for
Coaches Maloney and Murphy to give
the men the individual attention that
they need. From now on the best men
arc to be taken in hand and given the
training necessary to whip them into
shape to beat the Olympic battlers.
