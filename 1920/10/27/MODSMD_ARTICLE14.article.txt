# NEUTRALITY OF POST DISGUISES CAMPAIGN PROPAGANDA; COX
## 
### 
Goxernor Cox referred indignantly
to the Saturday Evening Post as guilty
of spreading pernicious political pro
paganda after deliberately building
up a reputation for disinterestedness,
in a statement issued at the beginning
of the week in New York.
Just before entraining for a tour
of West Virginia, Indiana, Kentucky
and Ohio, Cox issued this statement:
"Propaganda is not effective when
it is labeled, but in the guise of facts
it strangles the truth and molds the
minds into which it is introduced as
fact ....
"1 am just now in possession of a
specimen of propaganda of this very
sort. It is the advance copy of the
Saturday Evening Post, known to a
great public as a disinterested jour
nal. In all its history its stated pur
pose lias been to present facts and
atmosphere of political situations and
to refrain from controversial positions.
In this spirit the Saturday Evening
Post has been admitted as councelor
and friends into millions of Ameri
can homes.
"But the number of this magazine
which is to be distributed next Thurs
day, the last number before the elec
tion, suddenly throws off the cloak
of non-partisanship. For the first
time in its history it resorts to the
devices of partisan editorial and in
siduous cartoons to create a senti
ment for the Republican ticket. In
the cartoons, 1 am represented as a
newsboy, inventing false and sensa
tional happenings for the sale of my
wares. My opponent is depicted as
kindly and wise. The impression is
sought to be created that I am ir
responsible, Senator Harding grave
and reliable.
"Why has the Saturday evening Post
done this' Why has it betrayed its
mission at the last minute of the
eleventh hour of this campaign? The
people know the nnswer. It has done
this thinp because its owner is one
of the plutocratic group which knows
what it wants of the next Administra
tlon, and how to get it from the syndi
cate- which controls Senator Harding.
It has done this because its owner
is head of the movement which lias
sought a subsidy from the Government
for the delivery of national maga
zines.
"The Saturday Evening Post has
imposed on the confidence of the
American people, won by a long re
cord of non-partisanship, and has be
come a Republican journal because
the profiteers who escape Government
taxes by diverting to it millions of
their revenue in advertising, want my
opponent elected."
