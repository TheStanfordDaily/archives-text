# Pajamarino Will Serpentine Campus in Peerade Tonight
## 
### 
Costumed in pajamas, night-sliirts
or bed sheets, the masked Knights of
Encina Club will tonight vend their
way through the highways of the
campus in the annual pajamarino pee
rade. Five hundred clubmen are ex
pected to leave Encina at 7:15 sharp
this evening and start a pajamarino
which will astonish the natives of the
campus.
Tiie clubmen will be marshalled in
front of the Hall according to classes,
and definite instructions will be issued
by "Red" Tauzer for the knights to
follow. Bundles of torches are now
cached and will be brought out at the
appropriate time to illuminate the
grotesque costumes of the pajamarino
erians. According to rumor, cow bells,
pistols and even reminiscent torpedo
es will distract all those who attempt
to study.
Leaving the Hall at 7:15 sharp the
clubmen will pass the Library and
surround Iloble in an enveloping
movement. Whether any stunts are
planned by the pee-raders "Red"
Tauzer will not announce. At least
the Encina men will give a thorough
demonstration as to how Cardinal
songs and yells should be properly
given by true Stanford gents.
The bedecked .knights will circle
through the Row, stopping at the
Delta Upsilon house for the apples
which custom has decreed shall be
given to the pee-raders. Sticky's will
be the final rendezvous for the ser
pentining clubmen who will disband
an hour after the pee-rade leaves En
cina.
