# PRESIDENT WILBUR SCORED BY RADICAL ANTI-VIVISECTIONIST
## School Should be Spurned if President is Not Recalled is Belief of Correspondent 
### 
"Dr. R. L. Wilbur may be educated
but he lacks civilization," according
to one enthusiastic antivivisectionist
who has written him a letter of dis
approbation of his course. This writer
is of the opinion that "this Ray Lyman
Wilbur should be recalled and a
school that would keep him at its l iead
should be spurned." In his reply Dr.
Wilbur suggests that the letter-writer
may not as a matter of fact be as
well informed about animal experi
mentation as he himself is and in
spite of the astonishment of the writer
that, a man brought by such a mother
as he had, could think so low, and in
the opinion of others, according to
this writer, that he ought to be num
bered among those to be burnt alive
or put in prison for life, President
Wilbur stoutly maintains that he
would like tho devote his whole life
to the endeavor to benefit humanity
through this very same animal experi
mentation.
The letter received by President
Wilbur is in part as follows:
"I have intended writing you, ever
since I read a piece in the Los Angeles
Times by you a few weeks ago, de
feuding vivisection, and I have just
lead your defense of the same, in the
Amendments to the Constitution. I
am one that helped get signers, so
we can get this on the ballot. I found
some intelligent people, that would not
believe that such things are being
done, and they said, if it was, the
ones that were doing such things,
should be burnt alive, others said
shey should be put in prison for life.
Hut what astonishes me, is that a
man that was brought up by such a
mother as you had could sink so low,
for what! lam acquainted with your
brother. Judge Wilbur, and he is held
in the highest respect by all that know
him, but what can be said for you?
"I sent your piece to Dr. Francis
Rowley, who is head of the American
Humane Education Society of Boston,
and said, is it any wonder crime is
increasing on every hand, with teach
ers, teaching Atheism, and Bolshevism,
and cruelty. I said, notice Mr. Wil
bur's false statements, that anesthetics
are always used. I said, he is a fine
one, to be at the head of a great col
lege. How can a person teach mercy
when he has none? I said, the first
essential of all education is humani
ty, and without that, education is a
fialure. The world today, is suffer
ing from the crimes of an educated
monster, that was void of every atom
of humanity. Emperor Bill of Ger
many.
"Yours for stamping out of the
devilish work of Vivisection."
President Wilbur's reply to his cor
respondent is as follows:
"I cannot help but wonder whether
it has over occurred to you that you
might be wrong in this matter of anti
vivisection and that some of the rest
of us. who have spent our lives study
ing such subjects, might be right.
"I am enclosing herewith a clipping
from the San Francisco Chronicle giv
ing a statement made by the officers
â€¢of the San Francisco Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
You will note that they have had an
opportunity to study conditions in the
laboratories in San Franc'sco. I do
not know just what experience you
have had in studying the subject *.f
animal experimentation, nor just how
many laboratories you have visited
or worked in. I have spent a con
siderable part of my life in the labora
tories in this country and am familiar
with those of England, France, Ger
many, Austria, and Switzerland. What
I have written in regard to the anti
vivisection act is the truth. There
undoubtedly have been in the past
abuses in the use of animals. I have
never seen them and I know is no
other physician who has. There are
a considerable body of good-hearted
misinformed people who are misled in
this whole subject and who mislead
others as they have misled you.
