# PRESIDENT WILBUR SCORED BY RADICAL ANTI-VIVISECTIONIST
## School Should be Spurned if President is Not Recalled is Belief of Correspondent

but he lacks civilization," according
to one enthusiastic antivivisectionist
who has written him a letter of dis
approbation of his course. This writer
is of the opinion that "this Ray Lyman
Wilbur should be recalled and a

ones that were doing such things,
should be burnt alive, others said

Hut what astonishes me, is that a
man that was brought up by such a
mother as you had could sink so low,
for what! lam acquainted with your
brother. Judge Wilbur, and he is held
in the highest respect by all that know
him, but what can be said for you?
"I sent your piece to Dr. Francis
Rowley, who is head of the American
