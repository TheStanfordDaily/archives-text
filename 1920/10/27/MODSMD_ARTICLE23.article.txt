# THE
						JAPANESE QUESTION
## 
### 
According to a recent dispatch from Washington, negotiations be
tween representatives of the Japanese and American governments over
the Japanese situation in California have come to a standstill, and the
two governments have decided to await the verdict of California voters
on the Anti-Alien Land Bill before they attempt to reach a decision on
the question. The Japanese government holds fast to its contention that
its people shall not be discriminated against, while Washington is equally
determined that Japanese labor immigration shall be stopped.
The California voters will have to make a decision on this important
question Tuesday. Hon. John S. Chambers, State- Controller, says the
issue is:
"Who shall have the economic control of California, the
white people or the Japanese? Agriculture is the basic in
dustry of all industries, and in California it is pre-eminently so,
leading all others in value of production by $500,000,000 an
nually. 'Shall the Japanese dominate, or the white people? One
means, eventually, a brown man's California, the other a white
man's. This is the issueâ€”industrial, and, broadly, political."
The present measure is designed to stop all evasions of the present
Anti-Alien Land Law, which is now on the California statute books.
Under this law, Japanese can lease land for a period of three years, but
the new measure is intended to prohibit all land leasing by Japanese,
and forbids leasing by stock companies, one of the subterfuges nsed
to gain control of land. The new bill forbids the custom said to be in
vogue in foreign-born adults taking out land in the name of their chil
dren, who, born in the United States, arc eligible citizens. In case of a
Japanese child holding land, the parent cannot inherit it, according to the
proposed measure, which provides for sale of the land by the court and
the proceeds turned over to the parents. Lands illegally acquired will
revert to the state.
The proposed law strikes at the many subterfuges employed by the
Japanese to gain control of agriculture lands. These methods have en
abled the Japanese to control almost as much land as if outright sale
were permitted to them. The industrial and agricultural interests re
gard this growing control of California lands so important an issue that
they prophesy that if it is not stopped the Japanese will entirely control
this state in a short time.
Attorneys who have examined the proposed law state that it does
not take away rights guaranteed to aliens under treaties between the
United States and other governments, it is not in violation of the Con
stitution of the United States or that of California, and is entirely legal
in all respects.
An important point is that the measure is not retroactive. It does
not affect Japanese land owned at present. The Japanese now in this
state will be allowed to remain. There is no provision restricting immi
gration, which is a power belonging to Congress. Japanese laborers
will still be available. The bill does not attempt to stop them for work
ing for other people; it simply prohibits land leasing, which is regarded
as a serious menace to the future of California.
