The faculty and their better halfs
gathered in the Clubhouse the other I
evening and decided to two hours just
how to vote on twenty different and
complicated measures on the election
ballot. What's a little thing like
cramming for a final ex. compared
with this stuffing PAR EXCELLENCE,
Killy asks us. Our soms are off to
you profs.
* ♦ *
We've been railing "This Side of
Paradise" lately and haven't had so
much fun since our dog, Hec* passed
liis second birthday. Here is the
cljsing stanza of "In a Lecture-
Room," a satiric poem that appears
in that amazing book.
* * *
"The hour's up—and roused from rest
One hundred children of the blest
Cheat you a word or two with feet
That down the noisy aisle-ways beat.
Forget on narrow minded earth
The Mighty Yawn that gave you
birth."
It's a good bet that the writer of
that didn't get his hours in that par
ticular course.

NETTING A LAUGH
Prof, in German Seminar:—"As
recently, even, as fifty years ago, i
women wore nets over their hair."
Wearie Willie informs us that he
knew it was a long time since the prof,
had a girl in his class, but he didn't
know it was as long as that.
* * ♦
The Holdover Clan gathered from
fa rand near the other day for a
session of secret diplomacy. Killy
wants to know if it will be 275, 27.5,
or 2.75.
* # *
So the song committee is offering
a prize for new Cardinal songs. Evi
dently a cash bonus is necessary,
thinks Kilp, to tickle the muse of the i
campus versifiers as to the mortifying
memory that "Palms of Victory" was
sung, whistled, and cortled for weeks
by Stanford men after the Big Game
last year.
