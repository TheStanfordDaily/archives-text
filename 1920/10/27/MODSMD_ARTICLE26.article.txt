# Committee Decides On New Scholarship Rule
## 
### 
No holder of a scholarship is to re
ceive more than $GOO a year from
University funds hereafter, according
to a decision of the Scholarship Com
mittee made yesterday.
In case a scholarship holder re
ceives a university appointment which
would bring his total income for the
year from University sources up to
more than $600 it is understood that
this appointment cancels the scholar
ship.
In some instances students, through
holding a scholarship and one or two
minor paying positions, have come
into a position where they receive
more than the amount now fixed and
it was felt that this was contrary to
the purpose of scholarships established
for the purpose of assisting students
to pay their way and that it prevented
an equitable distribution of such aid.
