## 
### 
Thrills, suspense, anti-climaxes, and
the final solution of all complications
makj a drama. "Pierre of the Plains,"
to be played by Sword and Sandals,
November 5, brings to Stanford a
play which will satisfy those who love
thrills, please those who cure for
pathos and entertain those who have
a sense of humor. The play grips and
holds the interest throughout, being
full of action and human interest.
Pierre, the sturdy Canadian Indian,
typifies the red man of the north. His
life is that of narrow escapes and
suppressed emotions. Lester Seib,
interpreting this part is expected to
give us the good work we are never
disappointed in expecting. Miss
Dorothy Woodhead, as the fiance of
Tom Redding, the Canadian Mounted
Policeman, and the beloved of Pierre,
is developing a great deal of indivi
dualism into her role. This is the
first time Miss Woodhead has appear
ed in dramatics 011 the Campus and
judging from her work the campus is
due for a very pleasant surprise.
