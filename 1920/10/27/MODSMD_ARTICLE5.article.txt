gregation showed up very well in the
scrimmages against the varsity squad
yesterday afternoon. Several times
the men went through the varsity line
for gains and the work of their own
line on the defensive was more than
satisfactory. This afternoon another
scrimmage is scheduled with the var
sity, for the edification of the students
who attend the bleacher rally.
Seay tried several new combinations
in the line and in the backfield and
expressed himself as being well pleas
ed with the showing made by the
Babes against the more experienced
varsity squad.
