## 'Moral Obligation' of Country Has Become Obscure in This Presidential Campaign 
### United Press 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 27.â€”'The issue
facing the country is "whether we will
make good or quit," President Wilson
said today in an appeal for the League
of Nations issued to "my fellow country
men."
The appeal was read to a deputation
of men and women members of the
Republican party who are supporting the
League of Nations. The President said
the league issue had become obscured
in the present campaign and he told tin
voters of the country the "whole moral
force of right in the world" depends
more upon us than upon any other
nation."
Every candidate, the President said,
should he tested by the question of
whether lie favored redeeming tlu
"moral obligation" of the United States.
The President again held up Article
X as the heart of the league, saying n
"is the specific redemption of the pledge
which the free governments of the world
gave to the people when they entered
tiie war."
President Wilson declared that the
"co-called Americanism which we hear
so much prating about is for party pur
poses only." Hamilton Holt and other
members of the Republican delegation
said they were deeply cut by the physical
appearance of the President, who re
ceived them sitting down. The President
choked, they said, especially when lie
referred to the soldiers who had fallen
in battle.
