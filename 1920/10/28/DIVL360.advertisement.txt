Crowding Our Value Lines with
Finer Clothes At Lower Prices
With our buyers watching the markets closely, we arc crowding our stocks with
finer clothes, bought on the new-price basis—and sold lo you now at prices vast
ly lower than like garments have brought in years.
We're featuring suits and overcoats.that are "far above last year in quality, but
far below last year in price. The most you can expect m value is the "best ' —
and that's the sort you'll get here always. Today we again prove it!
WE SOLICIT CHARGE ACCOUNTS |
Finer Suits Finer Overcoats
*47 and *60 $ 45 and *60
In these four price groups are men's and young men's garments of quality fabrics, the newest styles of fin
ished tailoring. In no instance can the worth be judged by the moderate prices. They're Hart Schaffner
& Marx and Roos-Made clothes, built to sell at higher prices, but brought to you now at lower prices, by
vast buying and minimum profits. That's our idea of V alue!
