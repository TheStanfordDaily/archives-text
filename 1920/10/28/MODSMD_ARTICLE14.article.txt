# CALL TRYOUTEES ON TUESDAY FOR DEBATE WITH BLUE AND GOLD
## 
### 
Debating as an intercollegiate ac
tivity will start Tuesday afternoon at
3:00 when tryouts for the for the
varsity team will be held in the Little
Theater. Only one debate with an off
campus team is scheduled for this
quarter. That, is the big scrap with
the University of California. Decem
ber 1 has been tentatively set as the
date for the contest.
"Resolved, that trade unions are
jistified in their opposition to scienti
fic; management." is the subject which
Debate Manager W. F. Leiser, '21. has
announced for the tryout. As a num
ber of the forensic battles last year
revolved around the labor question,
the experienced tryoutees are well
grounded in the fundamentals of the
topic for the Tuesday contest.
All possible tryoutees are requested
to leave a paper with Dr. Bassett in
the English Building containing their
names, address and the side which
they wish to support in the tryout,
Leiser has named Monday as the last
day on which names will be accepted.
An elaborate debate will not be at
tempted Tuesday afternoon. Five
minutes will be granted for en eh of
the constructive arguments of the
speakers, with an allowance of three
minutes to each debater for a rebut
tal. The ability of the tryoutees in
extemporaneous speaking will be a
large factor in picking the trio which
will meet the California squad.
Leiser is confidnt that j) strong team
will emerge from the Tuesday contest.
Though a large number of seasoned
debatersdebaters have declared their
intention of entering the lists, candi
dates without varsity experience will
stand on an equal footing with the
veterans.
Dan Goodman, '22, a member of the
varsity and .Toffre teams last year,
will be a strong contender for a place
on the. 11)20 trio. A recent, transferee
from Redlands University, T. R.
Green. '21, is reputed to be one of the
most effective speakrs in debating
circles in the state, and will un
doubtedly prove a dangerous man in
the tryout.
Mortimer Cline, '21, is certain to
make a strong bid for (he varsity as
his previous experience well qualifies
him for intercollegiate debating.
