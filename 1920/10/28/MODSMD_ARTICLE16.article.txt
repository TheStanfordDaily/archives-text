# NINETEEN OREGON MEN FORM SQUAD TO MEET VARSITY
## FIRST PACIFIC COAST CONFERENCE FOOTBALL GAME TO BE PLAYED ON STANFORD FIELD WITH LEMON-YELLOW AGGREGATION 
### 
Nineteen Oregon football players will
arrive in San Francisco early tomorrow
morning. The team will make its head
quarters at the Bellevue Hotel, and will
probably be the guests of the Olympic
Club at meals. The squad will use
Ewing Field in the bay city for a prac
tice workout tomorrow afternoon and
Saturday morning's light signal practice.
Coach Powell is working hard with
bis Cardinal gradiron warriors and lias
several surprises to spring on the north
ern team, when Oregon and Stanford
clash on the local varsity turf at 3
o'clock Saturday afternoon. The fresh
men will play a curtain-raising game
against the University of Southern Cali
fornia frosh.
According to the announcement made
by Graduate Manager Ed Martin this
morning the price of admission will be
one dollar and fifty cents. Those pre
senting student body cards will be
charged one dollar.
I n last night's practice "Dink" Temple
ton was the center of interest while
trying out his educated toe. Templeton

is dropping the ball over from the forty
yard line without trouble. His punts
are averaging sixty yards, which should
surpass the kicking of Captain Hill
Steers of Oregon. Steers is said t<> la
able to punt that distance but he will
probably run against an obstacle when
he starts exchanging punts with Temple
ton.
Probably no definite lineup will be
announced by the Stanford coach until
Saturday afternoon. A tentative list of
the men to start the game will appear
in tomorrow's Daily. Several new com
binations and shifts make it practically
impossible to ascertain the positions of
some of the men.
The Oregon men to make the trip are:
"Brick" Leslie, Loughlin, centers;
Maut z, Ward, Vonde Abe, guards;
"Spike" Leslie, Shields, Strachan, tack
les; Howard, J3rown, Moffat, McKen
ny, ends; Reinhart, F. jacobberger.
quarter-backs; Captain Bill Steers, Hill.
Chapman, Meade, halfbacks; King.
Meade, full-backs; "Shy" Huntington.
Bill Hayward and Bart Spellman.
