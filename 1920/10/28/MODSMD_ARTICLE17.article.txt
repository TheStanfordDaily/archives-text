# SCENES OF DRAMA HARMONIZE WITH EMOTIONAL PLAY
## Individual Acting Calls For Good Dramatic Ability In Impersonation 
### 
Sword and Sandals' drama, "Pierre
of the Plains," to be played November
5, involves a most elaborate and com
plicated scenic arrangement. The
lighting plays directly in harmony
with the action of the play. Suspense,
thrill, pathos and laughter are in di
rect contact with the dim or dazzling
lights.
Every detail has been worked out to
grip from the audience an accurate
emotional response.
Coach Gordon Davis and Manager
Homer Mitchell have several of the
most efficient stage managers of the
campus unravelling the threads of
complications.
The society has determined, as usu
al, to set the standard for plays which
are to follow this year. Other dra
matic societies will have a standard
set by Sword and Sandals, November
:"> which is worthy of being reached.
The past reputation of the society's
productions is in itself enough to as
sure the kind of a play to be pro
duced this year.
Last year's drama, "The Frst Born"
might be termed as a heavy tragedy.
The society took a long shot at suc
cess by producing it, but nevertheless,
they met with success through their
ability to put across dramatics. "Pierre
of the Plains" is not as heavy as last
year's success, nor can it be classed
as light. The happy medium marks
well the classification of this sensa
tion.
The true impersonations, the inten
se moods, and the realistic characteri
zations of the individual parts, which
the actor must wholly put himself
into is the keynote to the emotional
qualities of the drama. The cast
picked this year has been chosen be
cause they seem to have that remark
aide ability, to cast of their every-day
characteristics and garb themselves
in the roles whicb have been assigned
to them.
.After the play, November 5, the
Ham's Head Sosciety will give a dance
n f the Women's Clubhouse. Music
will be furnished by the society's
orchestra.
