# COURTESY TO VISITORS
## 
### 
SPIRIT lias always been essential to a successful Univer
sity, and at Stanford, we are especially proud of the Stanford Spirit.
But there are times when the spirit of the rooters breaks over the bounds
of courtesy, and visiting" teams are offended. Booing of visiting teams
occurred here once or twice during the basketball season last year, but
as a whole, Stanford students have lived up to their traditions and have
treated the visiting athletic teams in splendid style.
The six universities forming the Pacific Coast Conference are close
rivals, and every season, each university sends teams either north or
south. If the cordial relations now existing in the Conference are to
be continued, all members of the Conference must ma 1 it a point to
go out of their way to treat the visiting teams well, and force them to
take home a favorable impression.
This fact is emphasized by an affair that happened at the Univer
sity of Oregon recently, and for which The Oregon Emerald apologized
to Oregon Agricultural College. The editorial in the O. A. C. Baro
meter, commenting on the case, is reprinted here in order to help Stan
ford students realize that such an episode must not take place here:
U. of O. CULTURE
(O. A. C. Barometer)
In view of the supposed culture of our sister institution at Eugene,
it is difficult for a student of O. A. C. to conceive of the standard of
courtesy set up at the university, as shown by the way it treats its
visitors. In the popular mind the university is supposed to turn out
polished ladies and gentlemen, while the college tends more to the
practical. In actual practice, however, such does not seem to bo the
case.
The only way of judging the extent of culture in any institution
is by the action of its students. Examples of typical Oregon spirit in
this regard are too numerous to mention. Let a few recent ones
suffice. Last Saturday a number of O. A. C. students, including
several letter men, went over to Eugene to see the university play
Multnomah. Upon their arrival the crowd sang a song, the principal
refrain of which ran "To hell with O. A. C." This hospitable recep
tion was greatly appreciated. It helps toward a friendly feeling be
tween the two institutions. Following this the band started to play
an O. A. C. song, but after a few measures burst forth into one grand
discord. , ' ,
It is hard to reconcile such action with the university's boasted
culture. We at O. A. C. may be trained among the cattle and the
chickens, but we are trained to be courteous to our guests. We
haye been taught that terming visitors "cattle" was not the essence
of hospitality.
We must not now lower our standard by dealing in the U. of O.
method. If Oregon men are present at the game tomorrow, they
will be treated as guests. Perhaps an object lesson will do some
good. I

discord. , ' ,
It is hard to reconcile such action with the university's boasted
culture. We at O. A. C. may be trained among the cattle and the
chickens, but we are trained to be courteous to our guests. We
haye been taught that terming visitors "cattle" was not the essence
of hospitality.
We must not now lower our standard by dealing in the U. of O.
method. If Oregon men are present at the game tomorrow, they
will be treated as guests. Perhaps an object lesson will do some

SPIRIT lias always been essential to a successful Univer
sity, and at Stanford, we are especially proud of the Stanford Spirit.
But there are times when the spirit of the rooters breaks over the bounds
of courtesy, and visiting" teams are offended. Booing of visiting teams
occurred here once or twice during the basketball season last year, but
as a whole, Stanford students have lived up to their traditions and have
treated the visiting athletic teams in splendid style.
The six universities forming the Pacific Coast Conference are close
rivals, and every season, each university sends teams either north or
south. If the cordial relations now existing in the Conference are to
be continued, all members of the Conference must ma 1 it a point to
go out of their way to treat the visiting teams well, and force them to
take home a favorable impression.
This fact is emphasized by an affair that happened at the Univer
sity of Oregon recently, and for which The Oregon Emerald apologized
to Oregon Agricultural College. The editorial in the O. A. C. Baro
meter, commenting on the case, is reprinted here in order to help Stan
ford students realize that such an episode must not take place here:
U. of O. CULTURE
(O. A. C. Barometer)
In view of the supposed culture of our sister institution at Eugene,
it is difficult for a student of O. A. C. to conceive of the standard of
courtesy set up at the university, as shown by the way it treats its
visitors. In the popular mind the university is supposed to turn out
polished ladies and gentlemen, while the college tends more to the
practical. In actual practice, however, such does not seem to bo the
case.
The only way of judging the extent of culture in any institution
is by the action of its students. Examples of typical Oregon spirit in
this regard are too numerous to mention. Let a few recent ones
suffice. Last Saturday a number of O. A. C. students, including
several letter men, went over to Eugene to see the university play
Multnomah. Upon their arrival the crowd sang a song, the principal
refrain of which ran "To hell with O. A. C." This hospitable recep
tion was greatly appreciated. It helps toward a friendly feeling be
tween the two institutions. Following this the band started to play
an O. A. C. song, but after a few measures burst forth into one grand
discord. , ' ,
It is hard to reconcile such action with the university's boasted
culture. We at O. A. C. may be trained among the cattle and the
chickens, but we are trained to be courteous to our guests. We
haye been taught that terming visitors "cattle" was not the essence
of hospitality.
We must not now lower our standard by dealing in the U. of O.
method. If Oregon men are present at the game tomorrow, they
will be treated as guests. Perhaps an object lesson will do some
