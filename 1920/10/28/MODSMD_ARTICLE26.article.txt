# SENTIMENT FAVORS WRESTLING AS MAJOR SPORT AT WASHINGTON
## 
### 
Protests are being registered against
the proposals to reduce wrestling
from a major to a minor sport at the
University of Washington.
Clayton Bolinger, wrestling captain,
declares the number of men turning
out for the sport to be a sufficient
indication of the interest taken in it,
and argues further that no man who,
consistently turns out for wrestling
and makes bis letter can deserve any
thing less than that recognition of
his services to the university. The
period of training for the wrestling
squad is four months long—longer
than for any other sport except crew,
Bolinger said, and the physical con
dition required is as high as that re
quired for any other branch of ath
letics.
The general sentiment of the campus
does not seem to be in favor of wrest
ling as a minor sport.
