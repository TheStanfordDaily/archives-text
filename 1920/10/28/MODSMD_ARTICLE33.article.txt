responsible for the present discouraging
condition of French literature, was the
view expressed by Professor F. Ander
son of the Romanic languages depart
ment in an informal talk given before
the English Club, this week, at the
Sigma Kappa house. According to Pro

crediting schools rather than individuals
lias a sheltering influence on contempor
ary work and is greatly inferior to the
American and British customs of re
warding individual writers. He considers
the recent attempts throughout the East
to have an American academy as an
unwise move and emphasized the fact
that this view is comparatively new and
startling in the contemporary literary
field.
