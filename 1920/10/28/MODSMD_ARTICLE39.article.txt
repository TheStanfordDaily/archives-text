## 
### 
BERKELEY, Oct. 28. â€”Captain
Robert Dollar, veteran shipping mag
nate, is of the opinion that in less
than fifty years the center of the
world's trade will be shifted from the
Atlantic to the Pacific ocean.
"Some provision must be made by
the government to equalize the cost
of production of ships and the cost
of operation, as compared with for
eign costs," said Capt. Dollar, "before
the American merchant marine will
be on a level with the rest of the
world."
