# UTAH PLACES BAN ON FRESHMAN PLEDGING
## 
### 
At the University of Utah, no fresh
man w ill be allowed to be pledged into
a sorority or fraternity hereafter.
The reason given is that first year stu
dents who join fraternities lose the
spirit of the college because their alleg
iance is divided. And students who do
not join are more or less outside of the
activities of the institution.
President Widstoe of tlie university
said in an address to the faculty: "The
discussions of the last year make it very
clear that the time has come to restrict
the activities of our sororities and fra
ternities. 1 cannot believe that they are
a power for evil on the campus in so
far as their own works are considered,
but the incidental effects that How from
Iraternity life may easily become sources
of irritation.
"May I voice the conviction also that
the rushing of students for fraternity
membership during the early weeks of
tlie freshman year gives incoming stu
dents a false idea of college life and
greatly adds to the difficulty of read
justment.
"My own investigations have revealed
that the present system of fraternity
selection and life has lead to much un
happiness, insomuch as 'rushing' pre
vents calm and collected consideration
on the part either of fraternity members
or rushees, and mistakes arc too easy to
make when a student new to university

life and all it implies is required to ox
ercise too hasty judgment in a matter
which is so vital.
