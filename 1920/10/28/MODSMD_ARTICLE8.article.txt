# LEAGUE COVENANT IS DEBATE TOPIC BETWEEN LEADERS
## Cox-Harding Scrap Unraveled Before Clubhouse Audience By Pittman and Gillett 
### [... ] 
"My opponent praises the Republican
Senators who voted for the League as
amended by reservations and criticizes
Democrats who voted against the amend
ed League. Is that right, Governor-"
inquired Senator Pittman, turning to his
opponent in the debate last night in the
Women's Clubhouse between the Ne
vada Senator and ex-Governor Gillett.
"Yes, you are correct," agreed Gillett.
"At the same time he praises Harding
who is against the League, either with or
without reservations, and condemns Cox
who is for it. There is no hope in Mi.
Harding for pro-League Republicans
unless you aVe willing to assume that
lie is dishonorable and will repudiate
after election his present opposition to
the League. That he is' dishonorable.
I can not believe."
Before an audience that crowded the
hall of the Women's Clubhouse the two
noted speakers for two hours and a
discussed the issues of the campaign,
centering their oratorical guns upon the
latest phase of the League of Nations
question. The arguments of Gillett were
of a legal nature, the different articles of
the League Covenant being discussed in
a detailed manner. Pittman, while
answering the arguments of the Gover
nor. relied upon the political and em
otional elements of the issues to arouse
enthusiasm for the Democratic candi
date.
Opening the debate, Gillett referred
briefly to the tariff, declaring that Eu
rope would flood the United States with
cheap products unless a Republican tariff
intervened to protect the home indust
ries. "The question of the campaign
is not pro- or anti- League," asserted
