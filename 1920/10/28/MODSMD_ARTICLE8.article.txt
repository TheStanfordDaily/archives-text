# LEAGUE COVENANT IS DEBATE TOPIC BETWEEN LEADERS
## Cox-Harding Scrap Unraveled Before Clubhouse Audience By Pittman and Gillett 
### [... ] 
"My opponent praises the Republican
Senators who voted for the League as
amended by reservations and criticizes
Democrats who voted against the amend
ed League. Is that right, Governor-"
inquired Senator Pittman, turning to his
opponent in the debate last night in the
Women's Clubhouse between the Ne
vada Senator and ex-Governor Gillett.
"Yes, you are correct," agreed Gillett.
"At the same time he praises Harding
who is against the League, either with or
without reservations, and condemns Cox
who is for it. There is no hope in Mi.
Harding for pro-League Republicans
unless you aVe willing to assume that
lie is dishonorable and will repudiate
after election his present opposition to
the League. That he is' dishonorable.
I can not believe."
Before an audience that crowded the
hall of the Women's Clubhouse the two
noted speakers for two hours and a
discussed the issues of the campaign,
centering their oratorical guns upon the
latest phase of the League of Nations
question. The arguments of Gillett were
of a legal nature, the different articles of
the League Covenant being discussed in
a detailed manner. Pittman, while
answering the arguments of the Gover
nor. relied upon the political and em
otional elements of the issues to arouse
enthusiasm for the Democratic candi
date.
Opening the debate, Gillett referred
briefly to the tariff, declaring that Eu
rope would flood the United States with
cheap products unless a Republican tariff
intervened to protect the home indust
ries. "The question of the campaign
is not pro- or anti- League," asserted
the Republican proponent, "but whether
we shall adopt the Wilson League with
out essential modification or enter a new
association of powers constructed on
lines entirely different from the Versail
les plan."
The former Governor was emphatic
in declaring that the League would en
croach upon America's sovereignty and
that our membership would not mean
peace but would only embroil us in
European and Asiatic troubles. His
declaration that "the League will deny
the United States the right to decide
when to light, with whom to fight and !
for what reasons," met with hearty ap-1
plause from the audience. "We do not j
want a treaty of force," concluded the :
speaker, "any more than a Germany of.
force."
Disregarding the issue of the tariff!
raised by his opponent with the asser- I
tion that it was not a question of the 1920
campaign, Senator Pittman devoted hi;>
entire time to answer the arguments of
the Republican speaker and to explain
the present position of the Cox-Harding
tangle.
"We must disregard the former be
liefs of the candidates," Pittman stated.
"Our votes must be decided upon the
recent declarations of Cox and Harding.
If you favor the League, the late utter
ances of Harding must force you to
vote for Cox. The Des Moines speech
leaves no other alternative." Pittman
pointed out that the opposition of his
opponent to America's entrance into the
League was supported by only three
other men, Johnson, Borah and Harding,
while Root, Taft, and eighty-one of the
ninty-six senators favor our entrance.
"You can not abandon the League with
out abandoning the Peace Treaty," Pitt
man asserted in concluding the debate,
"and the Allies have too much sense to
do that and we have too much honor to
suggest it."
