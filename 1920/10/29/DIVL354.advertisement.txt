I Herbert C. Jones Endorses the t
t *
| Candidacy of Judge Brown $
! I
Judge F. B. Brown possesses all the essentials for the po- £
*sition of Judge of the Superior Court.
* He is a college-trained man. He has had 25 years of di-
+ . versified legal experience. He has been successful in pri- 4.
+ vate practice. He achieved a commendable record as City £
Attorney of San Jose. His administration for the past £
14 years of the office of Justice of the ; Peace of San Jose
township, which gives him jurisdiction over more than half J
4! the population of the county, has reflected credit on him,
+ because of his ability, fairness and impartiality.
Judge Brown has common sense, which some lawyers in J
these days affect to disparage... He has broad, human
+ sympathies. He has always stood for clean government £
% and been to the front in all matters for the progress and J
* up-building of the community. He has independence of *
+ character, which the public should demand of a judge. £
j 4.
Because of his legal experience, his integrity, his judicial <j
mind and his public spirit, I desire to commend his candi- *
% dacy for Judge on the Superior Bench.
