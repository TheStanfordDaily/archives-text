# STANFORD BABES 10 BATTLE U.S.C. FROSH TOMORROW
## Coach Seay Makes Changes in Team Personnel; Flood Replaces Dunbar at Center 
### 
Two new faces will appear in the
lineup of the Freshman football eleven 1
when they trot forth on Saturday after
noon to do battle with the Babes of the!
University of Southern California. Flood ;
will appear at center in place of Dunbar I
who has been riding a mean pair of j
charley-horses for the past two weeks i
and is not in shape to go on. Gonzales
replaces Campbell at right-half. Camp
bell has been one of the most consistent \
men on the first year squad and is a |
trifle stale, so Gonzales, who has been j
showing up well in the scrimmages will
start the game.
The balance of the lineup is composed j
of the same men who started against the
Davis team two weeks ago. Slater anclj
fuller will play ends, Carter and Hart
ranft, tackles, Fullerton and Arthur,
guards, and Flood, center. Woodward j
will play the quarter, Judy and Gonzales {
half-backs, and Hey full-back.
Coach Seay is well pleased with the I
way the men handled themselves in their
scrimmages with the Varsity on Tues
day and Wednesday. The Babes are in j
top condition for Saturday's game and !
rarin' to go. They are not in the least I
overconfident but are prepared to give
the Southerners the battle of their young I
lives.
' The U. S. C. Freshmen arrived on the |
Lark from Los Angeles at 9:15 this f
morning and worked out on the turf
this afternoon. They pack a mighty
nitfy reputation with them and seem de
termined that their long journey from
the village of cafeterias shall not be in
vain.
The game is scheduled to begin at
one o'clock Saturday. Admission for
the afternoon's entertainment will be
1.50 and $1.00 to holders of student
body tickets.
The lineups:
Stanford Freshmen: 1 e, Slater; 1 t, I
Carter; 1 g. Fullerton; c. Flood; rg,
Arthur; r t, Hartranft; re, Fuller; q, j
Woodward; 1 h, Judy; r h, Gonzales; f,
