UNIVERSITY OF OK KG ON, Oct.
29. —(Special to the Daily Palo Alto.)
—Seventeen lemon-yellow football
men in charge of "Shy" Huntington,
head coach; Bart Spellman, line coach,
and Bill Hayward, trainer, boarded
the midnight rattler Wednesday for
California, where they will meet the
Stanford University eleven, at Palo
Alto, Saturday afternoon.
This schedule calls for an arrival
in Palo Alto in time for a stiff signal
practice on the Cardinal field, Friday
afternoon. While enroute, the squad
will utilize all available stop-overs
for limbering-up exercises to avoid any
"car stiffness."
The three workouts held here this
week have been used in the main to
correct the mistakes of the Oregon
fdaho game last week end. This was
the first real game of the season for
Huntington's men and, although it
resulted in a lemon-yellow victory,
there were numerous features which
required a re-touching before the
Stanford ctruggle.
"Shy" is also working up a number
of now plays which he expects will be
used to a good advantage against the
southerners this week. So far team
work has been the chief theme for
practice and only a few shifts have
been employed but, as the season ad
vances, the Oregon mentors are bring
ing into use many new formations for
both defensive and offensive plays.
Trainer Hayward is working over
time this week in putting four of the
Oregon warriors in fighting trim again,
