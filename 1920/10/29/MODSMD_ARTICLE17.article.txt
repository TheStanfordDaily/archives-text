# SEVENTEEN PLAYERS TO MAKE TRIP SOUTH FROM EUGENE
## 
### (By GUY E. SACRE) "Oregon Daily Emerald 
UNIVERSITY OF OK KG ON, Oct.
29. —(Special to the Daily Palo Alto.)
—Seventeen lemon-yellow football
men in charge of "Shy" Huntington,
head coach; Bart Spellman, line coach,
and Bill Hayward, trainer, boarded
the midnight rattler Wednesday for
California, where they will meet the
Stanford University eleven, at Palo
Alto, Saturday afternoon.
This schedule calls for an arrival
in Palo Alto in time for a stiff signal
practice on the Cardinal field, Friday
afternoon. While enroute, the squad
will utilize all available stop-overs
for limbering-up exercises to avoid any
"car stiffness."
The three workouts held here this
week have been used in the main to
correct the mistakes of the Oregon
fdaho game last week end. This was
the first real game of the season for
Huntington's men and, although it
resulted in a lemon-yellow victory,
there were numerous features which
required a re-touching before the
Stanford ctruggle.
"Shy" is also working up a number
of now plays which he expects will be
used to a good advantage against the
southerners this week. So far team
work has been the chief theme for
practice and only a few shifts have
been employed but, as the season ad
vances, the Oregon mentors are bring
ing into use many new formations for
both defensive and offensive plays.
Trainer Hayward is working over
time this week in putting four of the
Oregon warriors in fighting trim again,
as a result of the Idaho contest. No
serious complications have developed
and Hill says that he will have the
men in top shape for the southern
game.
Oregon students are expecting Bill
Steers, the 1920 captain, to perform in
mid-season style in the Cardinal con
test. "Big Bill" had been out for only
a week previous to the Idaho game,
and was in no condition to stand a full
four quarters. The return of Steers
has proven a remarkable single factor
in the development of Oregon's 1920
eleven.
A unanimous choice for all-Coast
quarter last season, and captain-elect
for this year, Bill's return was a strong
psychological factor for the whole
squad, while his power on the team
is undoubtedly a great advantage also.
Besides being one of the best ground
gainers in the conference last season,
Bill is also unexcelled in drop and
place kicks.
It was a popular opinion after the
Idaho game that this year's eleven is
on a par, if not more powerful, than
the 1919 team. The strength of the
line was demonstrated when the un
usually strong Idaho backfleld was
held for four successive downs inside
the shadow of the Oregon goal posts.
This year's backfleld. although light,
bids fair to hold its own with the best
in the conference. The combination
v/hich started the Idaho game, and
which will probably take the field on
Saturday, wa3 easily the equal of
Oregon's 1919 backfleld.
Billy Rinehart, at quarter; Steers
and Frankie Hill, halves, and George
King, at full, are expected to start
the Staafirct game. Three backfleld
subs, Frmci-.. Jacob) eiger, Pete Meade
and Nish Chapman were taken 011 the
southern trip.
Jacobberger, Steers and Chapman
are the only letter men out for the
backfleld this year. Rinehart starred
on the 1916 frosh team but has not
been in college for a football season
since, while Hill, King an 1 Heado are
products of the last year's frosh
eleven. Steers and "Jake" Jacob
Verger are both two-year letter men.
In the line, Huntington has four
"vets" around which be has molded
a formidable combination Mart How
ard, playing his third year on the var
sity at end; "Spr'lte" Leslie, a two
year varsity tackle; Carl Mautz. whh
three years' time at guard; "Brick"
Leslie, a veteran from the previous
varsities at center, are the mainstays
of the 1920 line. Howard and Mautz
played with the S. A. T. C. eleven in
1918, the two Leslie boys bad one
>ea? on pre-war elevens, while all four
played on last year's team.
Rud Brown, end; "Tiny" Shields,
tackle, and Ed Ward, guard, are the
probable fillers in the above line.
Brown and Shields pla\ed with the
1919 frosh team while Ward was a line
sub on the varsity last year. Brown,
in his fiirst conference game against
Idaho, scored both Oregon touchdowns,
one from a recovered Idaho fumble
and one on a pass.
The line subs to make the trip are
Carl Vonder Abe, "Scotty" Straclian,
and Gus McKinney.

This year's backfleld. although light,
bids fair to hold its own with the best
in the conference. The combination
v/hich started the Idaho game, and
which will probably take the field on
Saturday, wa3 easily the equal of
Oregon's 1919 backfleld.
Billy Rinehart, at quarter; Steers
and Frankie Hill, halves, and George
King, at full, are expected to start
the Staafirct game. Three backfleld
subs, Frmci-.. Jacob) eiger, Pete Meade
and Nish Chapman were taken 011 the
southern trip.
Jacobberger, Steers and Chapman
are the only letter men out for the
backfleld this year. Rinehart starred
on the 1916 frosh team but has not
been in college for a football season
since, while Hill, King an 1 Heado are
products of the last year's frosh
eleven. Steers and "Jake" Jacob
Verger are both two-year letter men.
In the line, Huntington has four
"vets" around which be has molded
a formidable combination Mart How
ard, playing his third year on the var
sity at end; "Spr'lte" Leslie, a two
year varsity tackle; Carl Mautz. whh
three years' time at guard; "Brick"
Leslie, a veteran from the previous
varsities at center, are the mainstays
of the 1920 line. Howard and Mautz
played with the S. A. T. C. eleven in
1918, the two Leslie boys bad one
>ea? on pre-war elevens, while all four
played on last year's team.
Rud Brown, end; "Tiny" Shields,
tackle, and Ed Ward, guard, are the
probable fillers in the above line.
Brown and Shields pla\ed with the
1919 frosh team while Ward was a line
sub on the varsity last year. Brown,
in his fiirst conference game against
Idaho, scored both Oregon touchdowns,
one from a recovered Idaho fumble
and one on a pass.
The line subs to make the trip are
Carl Vonder Abe, "Scotty" Straclian,
and Gus McKinney.
UNIVERSITY OF OK KG ON, Oct.
29. —(Special to the Daily Palo Alto.)
—Seventeen lemon-yellow football
men in charge of "Shy" Huntington,
head coach; Bart Spellman, line coach,
and Bill Hayward, trainer, boarded
the midnight rattler Wednesday for
California, where they will meet the
Stanford University eleven, at Palo
Alto, Saturday afternoon.
This schedule calls for an arrival
in Palo Alto in time for a stiff signal
practice on the Cardinal field, Friday
afternoon. While enroute, the squad
will utilize all available stop-overs
for limbering-up exercises to avoid any
"car stiffness."
The three workouts held here this
week have been used in the main to
correct the mistakes of the Oregon
fdaho game last week end. This was
the first real game of the season for
Huntington's men and, although it
resulted in a lemon-yellow victory,
there were numerous features which
required a re-touching before the
Stanford ctruggle.
"Shy" is also working up a number
of now plays which he expects will be
used to a good advantage against the
southerners this week. So far team
work has been the chief theme for
practice and only a few shifts have
been employed but, as the season ad
vances, the Oregon mentors are bring
ing into use many new formations for
both defensive and offensive plays.
Trainer Hayward is working over
time this week in putting four of the
Oregon warriors in fighting trim again,
as a result of the Idaho contest. No
serious complications have developed
and Hill says that he will have the
men in top shape for the southern
game.
Oregon students are expecting Bill
Steers, the 1920 captain, to perform in
mid-season style in the Cardinal con
test. "Big Bill" had been out for only
a week previous to the Idaho game,
and was in no condition to stand a full
four quarters. The return of Steers
has proven a remarkable single factor
in the development of Oregon's 1920
eleven.
A unanimous choice for all-Coast
quarter last season, and captain-elect
for this year, Bill's return was a strong
psychological factor for the whole
squad, while his power on the team
is undoubtedly a great advantage also.
Besides being one of the best ground
gainers in the conference last season,
Bill is also unexcelled in drop and
place kicks.
It was a popular opinion after the
Idaho game that this year's eleven is
on a par, if not more powerful, than
the 1919 team. The strength of the
line was demonstrated when the un
usually strong Idaho backfleld was
held for four successive downs inside
the shadow of the Oregon goal posts.
