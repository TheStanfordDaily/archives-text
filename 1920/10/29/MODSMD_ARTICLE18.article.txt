# SLUE AND GOLD WILL PLAY OREGON AGGIES IN CONFERENCE GAME
## 
### 
"Andy" Smith and twenty-two of
the University of California varsity
football players left Wednesday night
for Oregon for their first conference
game tomorrow with the Oregon
Aggies at Corvallis.
The Blue and Gold warriors have
lost their over-confidence, and are
prepared to meet bona-fide resistence,
Saturday. Infact, "preparedness" is
a word of note in Andy Smith's voca
bulary. The Bruin coach does not
bank on the weather bureau's reports,
and to guard against the surprise of
playing in the mud and rain he ar
ranged an aquatic battle all his own.
The two final practices of this week
saw the Bears scrimmaging on a field
flooded with water to imitate the
probable condition of the field at Cor
vallis. The difference between play
ing on the grass and in a mud puddle
was obvious in the slipping which
made fumbles much easier. The var
sity also ran through some new plays
which are calculated to take the Ore
gon farmers by surprise and count
for some substantial gains.
