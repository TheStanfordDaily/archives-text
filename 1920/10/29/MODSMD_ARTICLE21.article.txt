### 
The Stanford and Oregon elevens will

eqiud chance for a victory in this tirsl

The 1919 Pacific Coast Champions aie
coming down from the northern country
very hopeful. Beyond all question of
doubt Oregon has a powerful eleven this
year with most of their hopes centered
around Captain Bill Steers, last season';
star kicker and All Pacific "Coast hali
back,
Coach Powell has been working hard
to get his men ready for this first
P. C. C. game and has developed a
formidable eleven that will hold its own
against any opponent. The University
of Oregon's hopes in Steers' drop kick
and punts may be shattered when they
watch "Dink" Templeton's foot touch
the pigskin. Football experts are antic
ipating a battle < f punts, with a probable
one or two scores made by the ball be
ing dropped v: r the goal posts.
Both teams are somewhat handicapped
by injuries that may affect their linenp
materially. The northern team is said t >
have live of their men on the injured
list, although these are all mild and may
not hold any of them out of the game.
Stanford has live men on the doubtful
list. Patrick and McAlpine will probab
ly be kept out of play, while Deems,
Cravens, and Campbell may play al
though they were hurt in the Santa
Clara game. Captain Wilcox is again
in condition to play.
Because of the injuries on the team
Coach Powell may have to make several
shifts in the lineup and was unable this
morning to make any announcement ot
tlie men that lie Will start against Ore
gun. Righter at center and Pelouze at
left end are the only positions that can
definitely be picked.
Because it is hard to identify the
different players when 011 the football
field, the spectat rs will find that
a list of this type will be very con
venient to have. The Stanford play
ers in the game tomorrow will be
numbered as follows;

The Stanford and Oregon elevens will
lineup against each other tomorrow
afternoon at .3 o'clock. l?oth have an
eqiud chance for a victory in this tirsl
Pacific Coast Conference game. The
varsity scrimmage will be preceeded by
a battle between the Stanford Babes and

the freshmen team from the University
of Southern California. General admis
sion to the game will be one dollar and
fitty cents while the admission to Card

The 1919 Pacific Coast Champions aie
coming down from the northern country
very hopeful. Beyond all question of
doubt Oregon has a powerful eleven this
year with most of their hopes centered
around Captain Bill Steers, last season';
star kicker and All Pacific "Coast hali
back,
Coach Powell has been working hard
to get his men ready for this first
P. C. C. game and has developed a
formidable eleven that will hold its own
against any opponent. The University
of Oregon's hopes in Steers' drop kick
and punts may be shattered when they
watch "Dink" Templeton's foot touch
the pigskin. Football experts are antic
ipating a battle < f punts, with a probable
one or two scores made by the ball be
ing dropped v: r the goal posts.
Both teams are somewhat handicapped
by injuries that may affect their linenp
materially. The northern team is said t >
have live of their men on the injured
list, although these are all mild and may
not hold any of them out of the game.
Stanford has live men on the doubtful
list. Patrick and McAlpine will probab
ly be kept out of play, while Deems,
Cravens, and Campbell may play al
though they were hurt in the Santa
Clara game. Captain Wilcox is again
in condition to play.
Because of the injuries on the team
Coach Powell may have to make several
shifts in the lineup and was unable this
morning to make any announcement ot
tlie men that lie Will start against Ore
gun. Righter at center and Pelouze at
left end are the only positions that can
definitely be picked.
Because it is hard to identify the
different players when 011 the football
field, the spectat rs will find that
a list of this type will be very con
venient to have. The Stanford play
ers in the game tomorrow will be
numbered as follows;
