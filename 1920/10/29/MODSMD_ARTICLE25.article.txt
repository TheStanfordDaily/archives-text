						TRADITION OF SERVICE
## 
### 
The Sophomore Class is to be commended for its zeal in establishing
a tradition which is of real service to the University. Last Saturday,
eight sophomores appeared at the Stanford Home for Convalescent
Children, which is located in the old Stanford Home, and announced
that they were there to work. They mowed the lawn, pulled weeds,
cleaned up the flower beds and put the grounds in order generally, and
according to the superintendent in charge of the Home, the)- worked
as if they enjoyed it. The class has announced that a similar number of
sophomores will appear each Saturday throughout the year. \ Few
more traditions like this one would be welcomed by the University.
