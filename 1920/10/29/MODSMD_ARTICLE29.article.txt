"I want lo keep talking," said Sena
tor Sorghum, "ut least enough to pre
vent any general reference to me as a (
sphinx."
"But such references imply a certain
degree of compliment."
' 1 don't think so. The sphinx Is
made up of such contradictory ele
ments that he can't be classified, and
the only remark I ever heard- attrib
uted to one largely in the nature
of a joke."
