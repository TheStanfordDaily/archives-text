# CREDIT FOR NORMAL SCHOOL WORK GIVEN
## 
### 
Tt is believed that our connection with
the state normal school at San Jose is
riot fully understood. This school gives
a very complete course of study in the
Home Economics Department. Credit
for this work is given by. Stanford and
may be applied on a Bachelor of Science
degree.
This is a decided advantage to some of
Stanford's women. Arrangements can
easily b< made for taking this work.
Any tfirl who thinks that this might be
a benefit to herself should look into the
matter further.
