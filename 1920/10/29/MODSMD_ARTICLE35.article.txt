### 
BERKELEY, Calif., Oct. 29â€”Amer
icans who are planning to go to China
lor business are advised by R. T.
Rvans, and secretary of the
American chamber of commerce at
Tientsin.
"Wait until after the present fi
nancial stringency is over," says Mr.
Evans, who is visiting friends here.
Evans is soon to return to China.
"Business is bad in North China
now owing to the depreciation in ex
change," he said. "Firms there enter
ed into contracts when money was
cheap and by the time the goods were
ready for delivery silver had gone
up and they simply did not have the
money to pay for the goods.
"Politically the Chinese govern
ment is in good condition, and if the
Japanese do not interfere they will
get established without trouble.
"As soon as affairs become more
settle d there American commerce will
be in a good position. American ma
rhinery gained a high reputation
during the war, and has grown in
favor since the war."
