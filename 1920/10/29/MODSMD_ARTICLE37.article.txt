# Man Who Lost $300 Is Fishing For Trousers
## 
### 
AVALON. Cal., Oct. 29. —Captain L.
Ashbridge is whiling away his spare
moments with a new pastime. He's
f.shing for his sea-going trousers.
These pants, however, are valuable.
The pockets are lined with money—
something over $300 in money, mostly
silver.
Recently while he was fishing for
fish he fell overboard from his motor
boat. The boat kept on going. The
money, a groat deal of it being silver,
weighted him down and in order to
save himself, he slipped off the
trousers and let them sink.
