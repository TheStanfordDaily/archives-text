# ELEVATOR MEN HAVE TALL UPS AND DOWNS

SAN DIEGO, Oct. 29. —Last week
11. 13. Watson, operator of the elevator
in the Campanile at the University
of California, claimed second place
for having covered in ascents and
descents a distance of *3 GoO miler..
The only man who had outdone him,
he said, was the operator of the cage
in Washington's monument.
Now comes George Cooper, pilot of
an elevator in the city hall here, who
rises to remark that 'Watson "hasn't
been anywhere."
Cooper says he lias traveled 8,000
miles up and down in the last ten
years and seven months that he's been
jerking the lever of the city hall lift.
The Washington monument operator
recently passed the 10,000 mile mark.
"I've had a nice trip, anyway," re
marks George. •
