## 
### 
PORTLAND, Ore., Oct. 29.—Mar
riage via the want-ad route wasn't at
all successful for Anthony Doleck. He
has filed a suit for annulment of his
marriage to Marie Dolecki, who, he
asserts, is Mrs. DeSnell, wife of an
architect at Butte, Montana.
The complaint in the case relates
that Dolecki was a bachelor and lone
some. Then a matrimonial paper fell
into his hands and he saw the ad
vertisement of a woman who claimed
to be attractive, to have $17,000 and
a desire to marry for love and com
panionship.
Dolecki claims that the woman, who
came here to wed him, disappeared
the day after the wedding, with his
suitcases, .$lOO worth of war savings
stamps, $250 in cash, and $(5,000 in
mining stock and other articles be
longing to him.
All his wife left him, Dolecki says,
was a note, declaring she had been
called to Chicago on account of the
illness of a sister.
Mrs. Dolecki —or DeSnell —was
brought back to Portland to face three
criminal charges, and was sentenced
to one year in the county jail, but
later paroled.
