# SOCIALIST VOTERS LOOK FOR BIG GAINS
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. indica
tions are that the Socialist vote to be
cast for Eugene V. Debs next Tuesday
will show a big increase over four
years ago.
The socialist leaders claim that this
expected increase will be due to the
imprisonment of the Socialist candi
date, the high cost of living, agita
tion over profiteering, federal control
under war regulations and radical
labor agitation.
Socialist editors have made fore
casts of that party's vote all the way
from one to five millions.
William M. Ferguson of the New
Day Socialist World, Chicago, pre
dicts at least 2,000,000 votes for Debs.
The vote estimated by W. F. Dunn,
editor of the Bulletin, (Socialist)
Butte, Mont., is 2,000,000.
Charles W. Erwin, publisher, of the
New York Call, estimates the Social
ist vote at between two and three
millions. He said the Socialists ex
pected to carry four Congressional
districts, sure, and possibly five. Two
of these are in New York City.
