# D.P.A. to Have Direct Wire on UC-OAC Game
## 
### 
The Daily Palo Alio lias made
ararngements for a special wire to
Corvallis to gut the results of the
California-Oregon game which
will be announced to the rooters,
in the stand here, as they are
flashed over the wire.
Special importance is attached
to this game as it is the first real
competition the Bruins have come
up against this season and a line
on their real strength will be pos
sible. The O. A, C. boys are
noted for fighting strength as well
as football ability, so a real game
of football should result.
