## 
### 
J hike Kahauamoku took the 100 yard
free style yesterday afternoon from
George Drake, '22, in the last ten yards
of the race. Drake and Austin, '23,
started on scratch and the Duke on
seven seconds handicap. Drake looked
like a winner until the last few yards
when the Duke sprinted and finished six
feet in the lead. He* had to make up the
seven seconds handicap in the hundred
yards and completed the three laps of
the tank in 55 seconds Hat.
Mills won the 220, finishing well ahead
of Overacker and Fred l ehren who took
second and third. The time was four
seconds better in the 220 yesterday than
that made in the same race last week,
being three minutes, four and two fifths
seconds.
After a false start in the fifty "Jinnie"
Austin, '23, came over the tape in 2N
and two-fifths seconds with Darling and
George Young a close second and third.
Austin is improving in form every day
and Erny Brandstcn expects to have him
in top notch shape for ft the inter-collcg
iate swims.
The breast stroke went to Charlie
Fletcher, '24, the champion from San
Diego. Fletcher was working in good
shape today and finished well ahead of
Lovell, '23, the time being one minute
19 seconds for 100 yards.
Warren Kaeohle, worlds champion
back stroke swimmer, won that event
from Charlie Watson, '23, in 45 seconds.
Keaohla was handicapped five second on
Watson but the Hawaiian swimmer was
too fast for that time and passed the
local lad at the end of the tank and
swam easily back to the finish. Kaeohla's
form was perfect and his arms moved
with a rhythm that was remarkable.
Mills took the distance plunge with
fifty-eight feet.
The Hawaiian trio consisting of Duke
Kahanamoku, "Stubby" Kruger and Pua
Kaeohla. swam a specialty called the
triple oar. The three men swam with
feet locked around each other and using
only their arms. The resembled three
men in a canoe with double paddles.
1 hen Warren Kaeohla and Kruger
swam a dual back stroke using the same
form. Pua Kaeohla gave a demonstra
tion of the powerful kick that lias placed
him in second place to the Duke in the
100 yard swim. As the closing event of
the program the quartet of Hawaiians
staged a Chinese relay. It was a bur
lesque on the Chinese method of con
ducting a varsity swim. Some fearful
and wonderful contortions were revealed
to the astonished spectators and the
event finished in a riot when Stubby
Kruger finished by treading water in a
manner that brought down the plaudits
of the onlookers and then sank to the
bottom to be hoisted clear of the water
by Duke, spouting water in a stream that
would have made Noah's whale hide for
shame.
