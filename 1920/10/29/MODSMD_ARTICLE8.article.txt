# DEMOCRACY SUBJECT OF DR. HARADA'S LECTURE
## 
### 
Can East and West Meet? Was the
question answered by Dr. Tasuka
llarada in his lecture at the â–  Little
Theatre last night.
"Kipling was right when he said 'Hast
is East and West is West and never the
twain shall meet,," said Dr. llarada,
"But he was more right when he added
but 'there is neither East nor West when
two strong men stand, face to face
though they come from the ends of the
earth."
It is a question whether two types of
culture can meet, continued Dr. flarada.
Human nature is the same the world
over U is conceded but every nation has
its own peculiar characteristics. Japan
is rapidly feeling the effect of Western
civilization and is reacting to it.
Dr. Harada did not touch on the
Japanese question in California. He
stated that his object was not to make
an appeal or in any way interfere with
America's political workings but to pre
sent his subject from an academic point
of view and that his purpose was to
contrast the ethical and religious aspects
of Western and Eastern characteristics.
The four oldest characteristics of I lie
Japanese race are a sense of duty, over
natural feelings, a sense of gratitude, a
sense of disinterestedness in regard to
pecuniary gains, and the virtue of loyalty

and filial piety. The Japanese have hacl J
to struggle against liuddhaism and Con- j
fncianism. Fatalism lias also had a S
powerful influence over the Japanese.!
He gives up too easily and docs not fight!
to the hitter end. said Dr. Harada.
The Japanse are coming to understand j
the Western idea of Christianity and the |
spirit of democracy is afloat. Japan lias
emerged from a state of feudalism dur !
ing last forty years which is only one |
tenth of the time required for the evo- s
lution of other feudalistic nations.
Dr. Harada emphasized the import
ance attached to English aind American
literature in the Japanese educational
institutions. English is the leading for-1
eign laguagc and a knowledge of it is I
required in some Japanese colleges.
The Japanese people have grasped the |
idea of democracy even more rapidly j
than the government leaders. The West-!
ern idea of personal right is the fotinda- j
lion of their new laws. 11 has influedcecl
them in repard to the home and the !
elevation.of women and has brought out
prespects for a healthier and saner na
tional life.
Conservatism and militarism arc still ]
in evidence in Japan but her new hope
lies in the rising liberal movement and i
through it, Or. Harada hopes to see the
Kast brought cL>ser to the West.
