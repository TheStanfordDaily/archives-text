### Unit id Press 
DUBLIN, Oct. 29.â€”Dublin was a city
of silence for ten minutes today in honor
of Terence McSwinev.
At 11:50, just as the religious services
were being (oncluded in the cathedral,
industry halted,
Street cans stopped, police and pas
sengers doffed their hats and bowed their
heads. At the dock and in the streets,
Irish sympathizers stood silent through
the ten-minute period. After the Mc-
Swiney hearse had passed, the roar of
traffic filled the air and machinery
whirled again.
The McSwinev mourning party, in
eluding relatives and Seinn Feinn" lead -
ers, commanded the city's attention
throughout the day. Crowds followed
them when they walked to the cathed
ral to attend the mass for the hunger
st rikers.
