FAIR PL
Fair play for our children means direct action next
If we of Palo Alto and other cities in California , what can
we expect of the United States Government?
We want Congress to restrict Japanese immir forced long ago
to stop Chinese immigration. Therefore we nr je that we mean
business, and that this issue is vital to our coun'
Vote YES on AMENDMENT 1, and back t aid Representatives
in their fight for justice.
MEANWHILE
Ask your real estate dealer, your banker and your neighbor not to assist the
Japanese in acquiring property or leases until adequate legislation can be ob
tained that will insure our great Western States against Oriental domination.
Do you realize that no European is allowed to
purchase one inch of land in Japan?
What complaint therefore have they that we
exercise the same right to protect our land?
Remember
1. We have every admiration for the Japanese, their industry and activity.
2. We are second to none in admitting every other good trait of that enterpris
ing race.
3. We have absolutely no race hatred in the matter notwithstanding statements
to that effect by Japanese propagandists.
4. We wish them a fair deal, but we demand a fair deal for the future children of
California.
ON THE OTHER HAND
We insist that every voter remember the following facts:
1. California is OUR country, not a Japanese colony.
2. It is the heritage left us by the pioneers who made the history of the West.
3. We are determined not to have our State of California lost to our white chil
dren and grandchildren by the steady tide of Japanese development, which
promises to drown white ascendency here as it has already done in Hawaii.
4. If you are an Americanâ€”
If you believe that this is a white man's country,
If you wish your descendants to hold this fair land for the white race,
If you have any California manhood in you,
REMEMBER THE GREAT ISSUE AT STAKE IN TUESDAY'S ELECTION
AGAIN
IF YOU BELIEVE IN A SQUARE DEAL
not only for the Japanese but above all
FOR THE WHITE RACE OF TOMORROW IN CALIFORNIA
