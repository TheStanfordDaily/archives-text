# HOOVER URGES ELECTION OF REPUBLICAN SENATE TO AID NEXT PRESIDENT
## ASKS APPOINTMENT OF SAMUEL SHORTRIDGE TO SUPPORT SENATOR HARDING'S FOREIGN POLICIES 
### 
Emphasizing- importance of support
ing a Republican president witli a Re
publican Senate, Herbert Hoover issued
a statement here at his home yesterday
afternoon urging that the voters of the
nation elect Republican senators and
especially that California elect Samuel
Shortridge as United States Senator.
Mr. Hoover also repeated his state
ment on the League of Nations issue.
The statement was issued to the Stan
ford correspondent for the San Fran
cisco papers and to a representative of
the Daily Palo Alto. It is as follows:
"I consider it vital that we should have
a Republican Senate that will support
the Republican President that we shall
undoubtedly elect. Otherwise we shall
have an administration without party
responsibility and without the possibility
of constructive solution of our pressing
international relations and our other
problems. Mr. Shortridge has repeated
ly and on many occasions undertaken,
that if and when, in the Senate he will
earnestly and to the utmost of his ability
support the policy or policies of Presid
ent Harding in all matters concerning
our foreign and international relations.
In view of this undertaking, I shall vote
for him.
"California is also interested in tariff
protection of her industries and the nec
essity of some action in this matter.
This is made especially by the exchange
situation which is now against us and
presents very bitter competition in some
of the most important state products.
"As to the League issue, this fight as
Senator Harding says, 'is not a fight over
'the' League or 'no' League but over
'the' League or 'a' League or association
of nations.' The Republican campaign on
this question has comprised two parts.
On one side the destructive criticism of
the weak parts of the covenant as writ
ten, and 011 the other hand a pledge of
a constructive program for an effectual
realization of the principle of joint inter
national action for the preservation of
peace.
"The constructive program is the thing
that will interest the American people
after the election, for the Republican
party will undoubtedly come into power.
The constructive program in any event
interests me more than destructive crit
icism. The great majority of the Re
publican party wants such a constructive
program and such leaders of the party
as Root, Hughes, Wickersham, Lowell,

and many others have already indi
cated what that program will have
to be in practical consummation.
We have to seek methods" of
solving this problem in a practical
way that will secure for the League the
good will of the American people. It
must be obvious that as the Republican
ratio in the Senate will not materially
change with the election that the league
as written could never be put over by
Mr. Cox even if elected and a con
siderable modification would need to be
made in it.
"Also the Republican administration if
elected will be confronted with the prac
tical situation of 41 nations comprising
75 per cent of the people of the globe
who have ratified the present covenant.
Twenty-three of these nations are also
vitally interested in maintaining the por
tion:- of the Treaty of Versailles outside
the Covenant. These nations have rati
fied the Treaty on the recommendation
of the responsible leaders of the political
parties that are in power in each country.
These men cannot go boack to their peo
ple recommending the abandoment of
their work as having been bad but they
can go back with modifications that im
prove it and secure the adherence of the
United States. Moreover to re-open the
Treaty of Versailles for re-negotiation
would bring complete choas to Europe
and calamity upon us from it. The
stability of the whole of Europe hangs
upon the maintenance of the Treaty and
the economic situation in the United
States depends upon maintaining that
stability and the gradual recuperation of
Europe's buying power. Therefore the
logic of the situation drives this con
structive program to the necessary modi
fication of the present covenant and the
ultimate ratification of the Treaty with
modification or amendments.
"Senator Harding has pledged himself
to take the leadership in bringing about
the consummation of this vital principle
of definitely organized inter-national
action that will secure the entry of the
United States and the preservation of
peace. He has stated that he will ac
cept all that is good in the present
covenant and that America will perform
her full part in this matter. 1 believe
that the Republican Party should be
thrust with the full responsibility ot
carrying out its pledges. This cannot
be done unless it shall dominate the leg
islative side of the Government as well
as the administrative."
