# VARSITY DEFEATS OREGON IN BEST GAME OF SEASON
## Stanford Babes Defeated by Strong U. S. C. Freshman Eleven in Featureless Contest 
### 
Stanford's freshman football team
suffered its worst defeat of the season
Saturday afternoon, when they were
beaten by the freshmen of the Uni
versity of Southern California, 35 to 0.
The Babes were 110 match for the
southerners who outweighed and out
played the first-year men throughout
the game. From the first pistol it
was apparent that the freshmen were
110 match for the U. S. C. team who
seemed to have a new play to use
every time they lined up and a knowl
edge of using it.
The southerners were Well drilled
in smart plays. They used long passes
and short passes, double and triple
passes, delayed bucks and long end
run plays. The Stanford men seem
ed to be completely mystified by the
attacks of the boys from Los Angeles.
They seemed helpless before the rush
ing style of the opposition.
U. S. C. opened up right after the
first gun with two long passes that
put the ball over the line but they
were penalized for off-side play and
forced to start over. A series of
passes and bucks took the ball to Stan
ford's three-yard line where the Babes
held for downs, in attempting to
kick out of danger the freshmen lost
the ball through poor booting and J.
Hawkins shoved the ball over for the
first U. S. C. touchdown. Milton con
verted.
In the second period Emmons, U. S.
C. right end, broke away on a buck
and carried the ball over. Milton con
verted again. A few moments later
Dolley, Quarterback, went around the
end for the second touchdown of this
period. Milton kicked the goal.
The Stanford freshmen looked dan
gerous in this period when a long
pass from Woodward to Judy carried
the ball to the 11. S. C. fifteen-yard
line where after ineffectual attempts
to buck, the Babes lost the ball.
In the third period Milton recover-

Going into the game on the short
end of the odds, the varsity upset all
dope, Mini shut out the strong Oregon
eleven 011 the Stanford turf Saturday,
tilt' score being 10-0. The game was
full of thrills â€”and fundibles. The
biggest thrill came when the varsity
held the plunging Oregon backs on
the two-yard .'ine after the Lemon-
Yellow players had smashed their way
from mid-fir Id The most costly
fumble occurred just after Templeton
had punted out of danger from behind
i!,e Stanford lino. Jacobberger receiv
ed '.lie ball 011 the Oregon thirty-yard
line, and in running it back, was
dackled so hard by Righter, that he
dropped the ball, Stanford recover
ing.
"Dink" Templeton increased the
strength of the Varsity backfield, his
long punts often placing the Cardinal
out of' dangerous situations. Temple
ton averaged twenty yards on run
ning back punts, and 011 one occasion
got away for a thirty-five yard run.
His drop kick from the thirty-yard
line in the fourth quarter cinched the
game for the Cardinal.
The first quarter was taken up by
the teams see-sawing back and fortn
over the field.
Oregon had two chances to score in
the second quarter, when two drop
kicks were attempted but were unsuc
cessful. The northerners started an
other precession toward the Stanford
goal in tlii.l quarter, and opened up an
aerial attack. Pershing broke through
twjee, however, and nailed Jacobberg
er before the latter could get the ball
off 011 a pass. This stopped tii 5 Ore

and Templeton ran the ball back to the
Oregon 30-yard line. The Lemon-

yard run through the line, and fol

yards. 011 the next play he gained
three yards, and Hill made first down
with a five yard smash through the
line. The ball was now 011 the Stan
ford six-yard line. The varsity line
held, and Templeton punted out of
danger, to the Oregon 40-yard line. It
was at this point that Jacobberger
fumbled, and Stanford recovered.

on the Oregon 5-yard line. Wilcox
