Up to the last ten minutes of the last

Then from mid-field California began
a goal-ward march. A pass from Sprott
to Mtiller advanced the ball to Oregon's
twenty yard line. Sprott shot through
for five yards. Toomey, receiving a de
I laycd pass from Sprott was dropped five

from Hugh McKcnna's arm, and it
California's ball.
