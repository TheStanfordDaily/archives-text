his statemen v afternoon for the benefit of the
voters of the '>f the California electorate. Mr.
Hoover consider he Republicans control both the
ltgislative and adi. government that he urges the
election of Samuel .. 1 grounds that he urges the

I;i an ordinary carnpax t safe to say that Mr.
Hoover would oppose men h , 1 : dge, but he regards
the control of our Governmem - ity so vital at this
time that he, along with Root, . r and others, will go to
almost any lengths to see the Repiu t rol the Government of the
United States. Hoover's position is L .ne Democratic party has failed.
Primarily, it failed to conclude peace, a criminal blunder in statesman
ship. The country must see a resumption of normal business, and, in the
opinion of Hoover and his group, the Republican party is the instrument
by which this condition will be brought about. It is on this account that
Mr. Hoover is urging the nation to give the Republicans control of both
the legislative and administrative sides of the Government.
In touching on the League of Nations, Hoover's statement again
places the party .on record as favoring a modification of the present
league, or a league or association of nations. He makes it clear that the
Treaty of Versailles must not be abandoned as a bad piece of work, but
nations that did sign it can afford to accept modifications that improve it
and secure the signature of the United States to the document.
