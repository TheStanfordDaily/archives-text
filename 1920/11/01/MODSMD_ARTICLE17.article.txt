# AN UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENT
## 
### 
Stanford has always had cordial relations with the University of South
ern California, and the treatment that each University has accorded
the other has never failed to be courteous. But this feeling is some
what strained as the result of the discourteous and childish acts com-,
mitted by the freshmen football team representing the University of
Southern California in Palo Alto on Friday night before the game.
Evidently thinking that they were just out of the nursery and the i
proper thing was to show their delight, the visiting freshmen proceeded
to "paint Palo Alto red" late Friday night. Clad in pajamas, they pa
raded through the hotel, dragging the contents of the linen closets with
them and managing to let the guests of the hotel know that they "were
in town." After soiling the carpets of their rooms with chewing gum
and smearing gum over the phonograph records, the guests of Stanford
adjourned to a restaurant and, after eating, removed all of the silver
vare to their rooms. A policeman was finally called by the hotel pro
prietor, and he managed to recover the stolen articles and to put the
visitors to bed.
Such occurrences do not help to improve the relations between the
universities on this coast, and they are unfortunate. It is hoped that in
the future the hospitality of this University will not be violated by teams
representing the University of Southern California or any other insti
tution.
