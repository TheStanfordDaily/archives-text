We have it on the authority of
Mark Twain that a "cauliflower is a
cabbage with a college education."
Without discriminating against the
lowly cabbage, ye ed. would like to
say that this colvum would appreciate
very much contributions in the form
of the highly educated cauliflower. In
that way can "CABBAGES AND
THINGS" pass from the realm of the
high lowbrow into that of the low
highbrow.

Spring verse is a little out of sea
son, but R. C. S. insists that we print
this. —
1 like the flowers
of the field,
Daisies, poppies and
buttercups.
I'm a nature lover
At heart, too,
But I'll be darned
If I like—
Smokeups.
Not to mention Spring verse.

FRONT AND CENTER, MR. EDISON!
A greater genius has been found,
S. G. T. writes that he has just com
pleted his wonderful invention.
Through it our local Toonerville trol
ley, the Pen. Electric Ry., with its
single-tracked, single-speeded, and
single-manned cars, will be supplanted
by his automatic street car. It works
on the plan of the automatic elevator,
it will start for six cents and stop free
|of cost. We believe it can be done,
for who has not seen our present
singular street car run from the high
way to Encina without a hand on the
controller? One difficulty remains.
Thero might be cheating 011 fares. But
let the passengers take alternate seats
and that danger, too, could be elimi
nated.

The term "rugger", puzzles the
younger generation that came here
after Stanford's Rugby days. A. D. T.
has written in to ask if a "rugger" is
a wrestler or a renovator.

Dopey Dan reports the observation
that the profs, are growing more and
more popular with the fair and good
looking as the time for mid-quarters
rolls around. Go to it, profs.; you're
better men than we are, Gordon gin.

Our attention has been brought by
P. S. to the frosh who throughout his
entire pea-green year thought the
"new-spoil" yell went "C — N — 40;
C — N — 40." That brings to mind
that story in Stewart Edward White's
latest novel, "The Rose Dawn," about
the Englishman who absorbed a lot of
false knowledge, one of the amazing
tales being about bow the pubpkin
growers of California always placed
the pumpkins, while growing, on little
wooden platforms on wheels —you sea,
the vines grew so fast that they drag
ged the pumpkin around over the
ground.

growers of California always placed
the pumpkins, while growing, on little
wooden platforms on wheels —you sea,
the vines grew so fast that they drag

CAULIFLOWERS ALSO
We have it on the authority of
Mark Twain that a "cauliflower is a
cabbage with a college education."
Without discriminating against the
lowly cabbage, ye ed. would like to
say that this colvum would appreciate
very much contributions in the form
of the highly educated cauliflower. In
that way can "CABBAGES AND
THINGS" pass from the realm of the
high lowbrow into that of the low
highbrow.

Spring verse is a little out of sea
son, but R. C. S. insists that we print
this. —
1 like the flowers
of the field,
Daisies, poppies and
buttercups.
I'm a nature lover
At heart, too,
But I'll be darned
If I like—
Smokeups.
Not to mention Spring verse.

FRONT AND CENTER, MR. EDISON!
A greater genius has been found,
S. G. T. writes that he has just com
pleted his wonderful invention.
Through it our local Toonerville trol
ley, the Pen. Electric Ry., with its
single-tracked, single-speeded, and
single-manned cars, will be supplanted
by his automatic street car. It works
on the plan of the automatic elevator,
it will start for six cents and stop free
|of cost. We believe it can be done,
for who has not seen our present
singular street car run from the high
way to Encina without a hand on the
controller? One difficulty remains.
Thero might be cheating 011 fares. But
let the passengers take alternate seats
and that danger, too, could be elimi
nated.

The term "rugger", puzzles the
younger generation that came here
after Stanford's Rugby days. A. D. T.
has written in to ask if a "rugger" is
a wrestler or a renovator.

Dopey Dan reports the observation
that the profs, are growing more and
more popular with the fair and good
looking as the time for mid-quarters
rolls around. Go to it, profs.; you're
better men than we are, Gordon gin.

Take with 1 Gr. Sodium Chloride
Our attention has been brought by
P. S. to the frosh who throughout his
entire pea-green year thought the
"new-spoil" yell went "C — N — 40;
C — N — 40." That brings to mind
that story in Stewart Edward White's
latest novel, "The Rose Dawn," about
the Englishman who absorbed a lot of
false knowledge, one of the amazing
tales being about bow the pubpkin
growers of California always placed
the pumpkins, while growing, on little
wooden platforms on wheels —you sea,
the vines grew so fast that they drag
ged the pumpkin around over the
ground.
