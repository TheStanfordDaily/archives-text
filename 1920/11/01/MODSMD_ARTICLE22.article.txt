# BOTH PARTIES FIGHTING TOR CONTROL OF HOUSE
## 
### United Press 
In the struggle for control of the
next House of Representatives, the
odds are considerably in favor of the
Republicans, owing to their majority
in the present House of 46.
But, notwithstanding this handicap,
Democratic managers, at the close of
one of the hottest Congressional cam
paigns in recent years, are confident
ly predicting a Democratic margin of
from ten to fifteen votes. On the other
hand, the Republicans are hoping to
increase their lead to at least (50 and
possibly 70.
There has been very little Congres
sional courtesy in this campaign. The
Democrats have put up vigorous fights
in districts hitherto considered safely
Republican, and the G. O. P. managers
have boldly invaded traditional Dem
ocratic soil.
Kor example, some of the closest re
sults will likely be recorded in the
Republican states of Massachusetts,
Connecticut and Pennsylvania, where
the Democrats have been especially
active 011 behalf of their Congressional
candidates. In Massachusetts they
are expecting to increase their four
votes to seven; in Connecticut, they
hope to elect four Representatives in
place of the one in the present House,
and in Pennsylvania to make it twelve
instead of seven.
Similarly, the Republicans have
gone into Alabama and North Carolina,
where now they have 110 representa
tion in the House, and expect to elect
at least one from the former and two
|or three from the latter. They are
counting also 011 a gain of two each
in Kentucky and Tennessee.
Republicans generally claim all the
! seats they hold at present east of the
Mississippi, with gains of the one
{Democratic seat in Connecticut, three
j in Pennsylvania, two in New Jersey,
I one in Maryland, three in Ohio and
! one in Illinois. West of the Missis
sippi, without taking into account the
much predicted landslide for the na
tional ticket which they say would
considerably increase the number of
Congressmen, the Republicans are
counting 011 at least the following
I gains: Mississippi 4. Kansas 1, Colo
rado 1, California 2, Nevada 1.
Democratic managers, besides ex
| pressing entire confidence in being
able to hold their own in the South,
and in addition to their hopes in the
Eastern states, above referred to, are
predicting gains of four in Ohio, six
in Indiana, where at present they have
no Congressmen; one in West Vir
ginia, one in Maryland, one in Okla
homa, at least one in Illinois, and one
or two each in Wisconsin and Minne
sota. In the far west they expect to
keep what they have.
In the Congressional campaign inas
much as members of the House have
110 direct voice in the fate of the Ver
sailles treaty, the League of Nations
issue has cut comparatively little
figure. Instead, there has been much
! talk 011 the one side of the failure of
the present administration and 011 the
other of the sins of the present COll
- gress. In many districts the Escli-
Cummins bill has been the .chief issue,
in others the wet or dry question, and
in others soldiers' bonus or labor legis
lation or Mexico or the Yellow Peril.
One of the most interesting fights
has been in the 7th Ohio distrcit,
where the Democrats are trying to
oust Rep. S. D. Fess. The fact that
Fess is chairman of the Republican
Congressional Campaign Committee
has naturally added zest to the Demo
cratic pursuit of his scalp. The main
fight on Fess, however, is because of
his vote for the Esch-Cummins bill and
against the soldiers' bonus.
Other Republican wheel-horses
whom the Democrats have marked for
slaughter, if it can be accomplished,
are "Nick" Longworth, of Cincinnati,
son-in-law of the late Col. Roosevelt,
and Rep. Slemp of Virginia, the only
Republican member from the Old
Dominion.

Connecticut and Pennsylvania, where
the Democrats have been especially
active 011 behalf of their Congressional
candidates. In Massachusetts they
are expecting to increase their four
votes to seven; in Connecticut, they
hope to elect four Representatives in
place of the one in the present House,
and in Pennsylvania to make it twelve
instead of seven.
Similarly, the Republicans have
gone into Alabama and North Carolina,
where now they have 110 representa
tion in the House, and expect to elect
at least one from the former and two
|or three from the latter. They are
counting also 011 a gain of two each
in Kentucky and Tennessee.
Republicans generally claim all the
! seats they hold at present east of the
Mississippi, with gains of the one
{Democratic seat in Connecticut, three
j in Pennsylvania, two in New Jersey,
I one in Maryland, three in Ohio and
! one in Illinois. West of the Missis
sippi, without taking into account the
much predicted landslide for the na
tional ticket which they say would
considerably increase the number of
Congressmen, the Republicans are
counting 011 at least the following
I gains: Mississippi 4. Kansas 1, Colo
rado 1, California 2, Nevada 1.
Democratic managers, besides ex
| pressing entire confidence in being
able to hold their own in the South,
and in addition to their hopes in the
Eastern states, above referred to, are
predicting gains of four in Ohio, six
in Indiana, where at present they have
no Congressmen; one in West Vir
ginia, one in Maryland, one in Okla
homa, at least one in Illinois, and one
or two each in Wisconsin and Minne
sota. In the far west they expect to
keep what they have.
In the Congressional campaign inas
much as members of the House have
110 direct voice in the fate of the Ver
sailles treaty, the League of Nations
issue has cut comparatively little
figure. Instead, there has been much
! talk 011 the one side of the failure of
the present administration and 011 the
other of the sins of the present COll
- gress. In many districts the Escli-
Cummins bill has been the .chief issue,
in others the wet or dry question, and
in others soldiers' bonus or labor legis
lation or Mexico or the Yellow Peril.
One of the most interesting fights
has been in the 7th Ohio distrcit,
where the Democrats are trying to
oust Rep. S. D. Fess. The fact that
Fess is chairman of the Republican
Congressional Campaign Committee
has naturally added zest to the Demo
cratic pursuit of his scalp. The main
fight on Fess, however, is because of
his vote for the Esch-Cummins bill and
against the soldiers' bonus.
Other Republican wheel-horses
whom the Democrats have marked for
slaughter, if it can be accomplished,
are "Nick" Longworth, of Cincinnati,
son-in-law of the late Col. Roosevelt,
and Rep. Slemp of Virginia, the only
Republican member from the Old
Dominion.
In the struggle for control of the
next House of Representatives, the
odds are considerably in favor of the
Republicans, owing to their majority
in the present House of 46.
But, notwithstanding this handicap,
Democratic managers, at the close of
one of the hottest Congressional cam
paigns in recent years, are confident
ly predicting a Democratic margin of
from ten to fifteen votes. On the other
hand, the Republicans are hoping to
increase their lead to at least (50 and
possibly 70.
There has been very little Congres
sional courtesy in this campaign. The
Democrats have put up vigorous fights
in districts hitherto considered safely
Republican, and the G. O. P. managers
have boldly invaded traditional Dem
ocratic soil.
Kor example, some of the closest re
sults will likely be recorded in the
Republican states of Massachusetts,
Connecticut and Pennsylvania, where
the Democrats have been especially
active 011 behalf of their Congressional
candidates. In Massachusetts they
are expecting to increase their four
votes to seven; in Connecticut, they
hope to elect four Representatives in
