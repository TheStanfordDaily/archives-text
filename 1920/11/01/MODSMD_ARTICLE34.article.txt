# Students Urged to Buy Big Game Hats Early
## 
### 
Roos Bros, have been given the
order for Big Game Rooters' Hats.
These hats will be sold for $1.25, 35
cents of which will be given to the
Rally Committee to go towards Big
Game stunts and expenses.
Students have been asked to buy
hats at once so that the committee
will know where their finances stand.
Only wearers of these hats will be
allowed in the Rooters' section so it
is imperative that every one get them.
They will be on sale in a few days.
