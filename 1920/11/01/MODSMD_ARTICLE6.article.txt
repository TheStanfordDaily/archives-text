The production of "Pierre of the
Plains" brings to the campus one of the
most masterful human interest plays
ever written. The worth and popular
ity of the drama was fully demonstrated
in New York when Richard Bennct/
produced it there. It has also been the
hobby of several moving picture corpor
ations and has to its credit a number of
successes which class it among the
masterpieces of English dramatics.
Although the play is chucked with
emotional arousing qualities, pathos and
suspense, it is cleverly rounded with
witty and comic lines. Love also plays
its important part in the plot and is
skillfully handled in the case of Jen
Galbraith.
Like most girls, Jen has in her

life love. She loves Sergeant Tom
Reding of the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police, and cares for Pierre, a Ca- ,
nadian French-Indian. Her care for the
Indian is greatly stimulated by the grat
tude shown her by the Redman. The
care is nearly transformed into a high
feminine affection until the time comes
when positive stimuli grapples with con-]
ventionality. Love for her from Pierre j
is worked to its highest degree, hut
should that be a basic principle for her
to give her life?
Dorothy Woodhead cleverly handles
the part of Jen in "Pierre of the Plains,"
Her ability as an actress is to
have its first opportunity of demon
stration next Friday evening. Miss
Woodlicad's past dramatic experience is
somewhat limited, hut wherever sin
has appeared she has met with success.
Opposite her play Lester Seib as
Pierre, and Hal. Brown as the sergeant.
Moth having had considerable experience
and known on the camtnts for their
dramatic talent. Miss Woodhead will not
ho handicapped in the least from starring.
The abundance of "Human Interest"
chucked in tlie play makes "Pierre nf the
Plains" somewhat difficult to produce by
amateurs. Coacli Gordon Davis feels
that the cast which has been picked has
enough inborn ability and past experience
to make the play a great success.
