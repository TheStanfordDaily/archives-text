# THIRD STRAIGHT WIN FOR VARSITY PREDICTS COACH
## Gridmen and Powell to Leave for Seattle Tomorrow for Saturday Battle With U. W. 
### 
Coach Walter D. Powell will leave for
.the north tomorrow morning accompan
ied by the Stanford football squad en
route to bring home another gridiron
victorj'. Saturday afternoon at Seattle
the Cardinal eleven will match its
strength against that of the University
of Washington team. Football dopsters
have stopped trying to figure the chanccs
of the Stanford team following the way
the dope has been upset in the past two
contests.
The University of Washington squad,
while it lias been thoroughly trained and
has the material for a good eleven, is
said to be the weak team of the Pacific-
Coast Conference this season. Stanford
should have a walk away in the coming
game, according to previous showings,
but Coach Powell is not planning to
start his men feeling that they can't
loose. The Cardinal coach is going to
play his best men and make them work
their hardest through the time of play.
Several of the Cardinal players were
'slightly bangedup in the game against
Oregon last week, but none of the men
were sufficiently hurt to hold them out
of the play against the Sun Dodgers.
The varsity will probably start the play
with the same lineup that started against
the University of Oregon eleven.
The Stanford squad will arrive in
Seattle Friday morning and will have a
stiff workout on the turf that afternoon
and possibly a light signal workout Sat
urday morning of the game.
An alumni rooting section is now be
ing organized by some of the old Stan
ford graduates in the north.
The Cardinal battlers who will ac
company Coach Walter Powell north
to meet the University of Washington
next Saturday are: ends, Pelouse,
Adams, Slaughterman; tackles, Persh
ing. McAlpine DeGroot, Hcsler; guards,
Cravens, Deems. Levy, Stice; center,
Righter, Rice; quarter-back, Bon
