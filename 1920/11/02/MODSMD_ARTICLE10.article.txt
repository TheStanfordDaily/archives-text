# CHAPARRAL APPEARS IN BIG GAME GARB
## 
### 
An excellent prophecy, if we may
draw conclusions from the victory
last Saturday, is the Big Game garb
in which Chappie greeted his friends
011 Quad this morning.
With the exception of a few minor
details, the "Old Boy" is coming back
to what he used to be. Dilettante by
Milt Hagen, '14, and Phoolish Phab
les by H. A. C., '06, whoever he may
be, help along the good work. The
return to the decorative lines at the
top of the pages used by Chappie
editors in the former days is to be
commended.
