NEW YORK, Nov. 2. â€” Appreciat
ing the very great advantage of hav
ing both the legislative and executive
branches of the government of the
same political faith, managers of the
two big parties have devoted much
time and energy and money to the
Congressional campaign.
Inasmuch as the Republicans con
trol the Senate now by only one vote
(exclusive of that of Senator New
berry of Michigan who is awaiting
appeal for a new trial on the charge
of violation of the election laws), with
the chances about even between Re
publicans and Democrats for control
after March 4 next, the managers have
largely concentrated 011 the Senatori
al fights in the various states.
These contests generally have been
waged with more vigor, and in some
instances with more bitterness, than
even tlie Presidential campaign. Al
though the League of Nations has
been the "paramount issue" in the
fight, for the national tickets, it has
been overshadowed in the Senatorial
campaign, in some of the states at
least, by local issues.
1 hirty-four new Senators are to be
chosen today ,from thirty-three states,
Alabama choosing two. According to
the forecasts of political observers
generally, it seems reasonably certain
that the Republicans will return Sen
ators from Vermont, New York, Penn
sylvania, Ohio, Illinois, Kansas, North
Dakota and Washington; while it ap
pears equally certain that the Demo
crats will return their two from Ala
bama, and one each from Virginia,
North Carolina, South Carolina, Loui
siana, Georgia,' Florida, Arkansas and
Oklahoma.
The expected changes, if any, will
come in the following states which
the Republicans are hoping to retain
in their list: New Hampshire, Con
necticut, Indiana, Missouri, lowa, Utah
and Wisconsin; and in the following
which the Democrats are striving to
retain: Maryland, Kentucky, South
Dakota, Idaho, Colorado, Arizona, Ore
gon and California.
In no states of the thirty-three have
the contests for the Senatorship been
conducted with more energy than in
New I'ampsliire and Connecticut,
where Senators Moses and Brandegee
have been subject to a hot Demo
cratic fire 011 account of their "irre
concilability" with regard to the
League of Nations. It was in these
states that the chief irreconcilable,
Senator Borah, made his first appear
ance on the stump in the present cam
paign. While the Republicans pro
fess to be confident of victory, the
Democrats say they are equally sure
of defeating both these Senators,
largely through the woman vote.
Moses and Brandegees were both pro
nounced anti-suffragists, and although
Augustine Lonergan, Brandegee's op
ponent, is also opposed to women's

voting, his- support of the League of
Nations is expected by the Democrats
to attract the bulk of the feminine
contingent in that state.
111 New York state also, which the
Republicans are claiming for the na
tional ticket by at least 400,000 al
though admitting that Senator Wads
worth will probably run slightly be
hind Harding, the Democrats are
counting 011 a heavy woman vote, be
cause of Wadsworth's opposition to
suffrage. They are also expecting
their candidate for Senator, Lt. Gov.
Harry Walker to poll well in the rural
districts where he is said to be especi
ally popular.
The situation in Maryland is gener
all regarded as close, with chances
favoring the return of Senator Smith,
Democrat, against Orvington E. Wel
ler. Republican.
Notwithstanding that the Senator
ship in Ohio is classed by the political
experts as reasonably safe for former
Gov. Frank P. Willis, the Democrats
insist that their candidate, W. A.
Julien, has a good chance, although as
a rule they admit he will run behind
Gov. Cox in that state. v
Fn Indiana, the contest between Sen
ator Watson, Republican, and Thomas
Taggart, Democrat, has been sharp
and lively. The Republicans admit
it is a hard fight, and they generally
concede Watson will run behind the
national ticket. Democrats say that
even if the State should go for Hard
ing, which they say they don't expect,
the latter would have to get a majority
of at least 25,000 to carry Watson
along with his.
The Senatorial result in Kentucky is
likely to be very close. All especially
fierce contest has been fought between
Senator Beckham, Democrat, and
Richard P. Ernst, Republican, in which
the wet or dry has been prominent,
with Beckham 011 the dry end.
Missouri is classed among the doubt
fuls, especially on account of the un
certainty of the reaction following
Senator Spencer's altercation with
President Wilson over what the
President is reported to have told the
Rumanians and Serbs at the peace
conference. Republicans contend that
lie has about an even chance of de
feating Breckenridge Long, the Demo
cratic candidate, while Democrats are
pxnerting Spencer to be cut somewhat
by his own party on account of his
association with Jake Babler, who
was involved in the Lowden pre-con
vention fund inquiry.
Senator Cummins, in lowa, is re
ported to have had some difficulties
in his campaign and Democrats are
freely predicting that unless Harding

and Coolidge carry the state by 100,-
000 they will have a fair chance of
sending Claude R. Porter to the Sen
ate.
The Republicans have found them
selves in some trouble in Wisconsin
because of the entrance into the Sen
atorial fight, of James Thompson, a
La Follette republican, as an inde
pendent candidate against Senator
Lenroot, regular Republican. The
Democrats are counting 011 a split vote
sufficient to let Paul Reinscli, their
candidate, slip across. They say that
nothing less than a majority of 150,-
000 for Harding in Wisconsin, which
they regard entirely unlikely, will re
turn Lenroot to the Senate.
Senator Marc Smith, in Arizona, is
said to have had considerable difficulty
holding the labor support for the
Democrats, owing to the popularity of
his Republican opponent, Ralph Came
ron, with that element. But the
chances seem to favor Smith's return.
In Utah it is generally expected that
Senator Smoot will run ahead of Hard
ing, largely because of his prestige as
a Senate Leader and the influence of
the Mormon church, in which he is a
high official. Prohibition has also
been an issue in this state, the drys
mostly favoring Smoot as against W.
H. Welling, the Democratic candidate.
On account of Smoot's prominence in
the "Senatorial oligarchy," both na
tional committees have given consider
able assistance to the Senatorial cam
paign in Utah, both financial and ora
torical.
There has been much confusion in
the Senatorial situation in Colorado,
Senator Thomas having decided to
run for reelection as an independent
anti-League Democrat, against the
regular Democratic candidate Tully
Scott, and the Republican, Samuel I).
Nicholson. Thomas' action followed
the capture by the Farmer-Labor party
of the Democratic state organization.
In ordinary circumstances Thomas
might have a chance for reelection,
but with two Democratic candidates
in the field the situation looks reason
ably good for Nicholson.
In Idaho the Republicans seem fairly
confident of the electian of Frank
Gooding, and the unseating of Senator
Nugent .Democrat, although it is ad
mitted that a Cox majority in the
state might also mean Gooding's de
feat. They are also predicting safe
Senatorial majorities in both the
Dakotas.
On account of his preat popularity,
even among Republicans, the chances
appear favorable for the re-election of
Senator Chamberlain, Democrat, in
Oregon, regardless of the result 011 the
national ticket. It seems to be the
general opinion that only a majority
of 100,000 for Harding could elect the
Republican senatorial candidate, Ro
bert F. Stanchfield.
Recent defections in the Republican
party in California, headed by Repre
sentative Kent, are believed to have
increased the chances of the Demo
crats reelecting Senator Phelan, as
opposed to Samuel M. Shor.tridge, Re
publican, although the expected heavy
majority for Harding in this state
may overcome what appears to be
Phelan's present advantage.
