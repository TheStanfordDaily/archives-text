# CHARACTER PARIS FEATURE OF SHOW
## Individual Impersonation is Basic Principle for Sword and Sandals' Next Success 
### 
Character impersonations in "Pierre
ol the Plains,' to be produced by Sword
and Sandals next hriday evening are
being developed to the highest degree.
Each and every actor is rapidly forming
his feelings and putting his soul and
body into the .part which lie is handling.
Lester Seib, in the part of" Pierre, a
Canadian Indian, has absorbed the sly
and cunning actions which tvpify the
northwestern Redman. Seib" is" well
known on the campus for bis dramatic
ability. His first appearance came when
lie took a lead in the Ram's Head show
in 1918. Next he carried the heaviest
character part in "Never Say Die," the
Sophomore success of 1919. Seib's abil
ity as a dramatic coach was shown last
year when he coached the Junior opera.
He also took part in this play and a
skit produced by Melba Berry and him
self for Masquers at the lake.
Dorothy Woodhead, makes her debute
in. campus dramatics next Friday, carrv
ing the part of Jen Galbraith a tavern
girl. Miss Woodhead will be a surprise
to teh campus and is expected to be one
of the biggest sensations of the show.
I hat athletes are also good actors is
demonstrated in the case of Hal Brown,
crew captain. Brown has made good in
crew and now changes his energies to
dramatics. The part of Sergeant Tom
Redding of the Canadian Mounted Po
lice is cleverly handled with force and
punch by Brown.
William Slieils, whose appearance was
made in the senior farce, "Good Gracious
Annabelle' and Stoddard Atwood, who
took the heaviest character part in
Sword and Sandal's last year's success,
"The First Born." stacks up with the
rest of the cast as star actors.
Then we find that comedy plays an
important part in the human interest
play. Charles Arnn with his natural
flow of wit and humor, cuts all binding
strings and lets off an original line of
comedy which would tickle the ribs of
any pessimist.
Other new material used in this year's
productions which is bound to come to
the front are, Robert Patten in an
elderly gentleman's part, and Marvel
Donahue who is the "bad man." Dona
hue plays his part with the fine repres
sion, intensity and vitality. Jack Ueffer-■
man is also a new man in campus dra
matics and his part is exceptionally well
handled.
Adelini Selma and Raymond Haizlip,
with splendid character work, typify the
northwestern Indians, while Eugene
Curtis, backed with an excellent "prep,
school" experience is expected to show
up well.
The seat drawing yesterday insured ,i
large crowd. Scats may now be ob
tained at the Book Store or at Crandall's
in Palo Alto.
