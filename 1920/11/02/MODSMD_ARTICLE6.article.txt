### 
Final plans for the entertainment
at the Assembly Hall tonight have
completed by the stunt committee.
During the evening and while the re
sults from the election are being
flashed on the screen, Professor Cot
trell of the Political Science Depart
ment has agreed to discuss and com
pare these results with those of the
last election and to give some idea
of the present attitude of the different
states.
Yell Leader Kinney asks that every
one brings their Freshman Bibles in
case they may be called into use dur
ing the evening.
The Prize Song is promised for the
evening and the Glee Club will sing
it while the words are flashed on the
screen for everyone in the audience
to join in and sing.
An orchestra composed of Filipinos
from the Base Hospital has consented
to give something new and different
in the line of musical selections. This
is the first time this Orchestra has
appeared on the Campus and we are
anxiously awaiting the success of
their "debut."
Miss Helen Whitney will give two
interpretive dances. These costume
dances will be given under difficulties
011 account of the lighting effects and
proper scenery to lend the necessary
atmosphere, but Miss Whitney has
promised to do the best she can under
these conditions if the audience will
make allowances.
Jimmy Ross, '23, has promised to
arrange a boxing match for a few
minutes' entertainment, as the Japa

Jiu Jit.su and fencing stunts due to the
lack of equipment.
Women's Council has made a special
dispensation for the women to stay
out after 10:30 that they may see the
final election returns.
The first two rows will be reserved
for the entertainers so that they may
see the returns between acts. The
entertainment will begin at 7:30 and
as the Assembly Hall will probably
be crowded it is urged that students
come early to get good seats. The
returns will most likely be run until
12 o'clock, according to Shelly
Pierce, the Examiner's correspondent.
The program for the stunts this
evening is as fellows:
