# ELECTION ISSUES OF TODAY DISCUSSED BY DR. JORDAN
## 
### 
"Nobody is going to vote tomorrow
with enthusiasm. There is nothing to he
enthusiastic about." This was one of
the keynote phrases sounded by Dr.
Jordan in his address on the "Present
Political Issues," given under the aus
pices of Nestoria in the Little Theatre
last night. "We are not going to elect
a Lincoln tomorrow," he said, and added
that his owit personal opinion was that
Harding 'would, be elected. Dr. Jordan
spoke to a crowd that filled the Littie
Theatre, and gave a very interesting
resume of the political situation, past
and present. He refrained from arguing
either tor, or against Cox or Harding,
and made no specific allusions as to
how the voter should act <>n the meas
ures which appear on the ballot today,
simply indicating in general terms the
situation and how it has come about.
Mentioning some of the issues of the
present campaign, Dr. Jordan cited llie
issue of individual freedom, meaning
principally not the right to free speech
and writing, hut to a more important
part of individual freedom—the right to
know the truth. Also, he declared,
temperance and privilege arc important
issues, but the tariff has ifo right to any
claim of that sort.

"We do not liavc party government
here," said Dr. Jordan, and went on to
explain how the true party system of
government is developed to a high de
gree in England. He also outlined the
growth of the political powers from the
time of the division between Jefferson
and Adams down to the present time,
and laid emphasis on the growth of the
"system," which he stated, has, during
most of the time since Grant, had a firm
hold on the Republican party —not be
cause the Democratic party is any more
virtuous than its opponent, but because
the "system" has found that, it can get
things accomplished better through the
agency of the Republican party. Dr.
Jordan quoted Hearst's statement that
"the Democrats as well as the Repub
licans have worshipped the Golden Calf,
but have not been able to secure recipro
cal attention from that animal." Wood
and Johnson were defeated by the
"system," he declared, and said that it
was through the influence of the polit
ical game that the Democrats left out
in the cold their strongest man available
for the nomination—Senator Owen of
Oklahoma.

| said Dr. Jordan, and in this connection
spoke of the difference between "bro
mides and "sulphides." 1 lu: former are
the oiks we can always count on, who
always go in the same old rut. while the
latter are the ones that have original
ideas, form their own opinions, and ac
complish something out of the ordinary,
whether it be good or bad. In deciding
how to vote, Dr. Jordan urged upon the
college students especially not to be
"bromides," but to act like "sulphides."
It is your duty not to he a 'bromide.' "
Although the parties today are not at
their best, as they do not represent
definite and contrasted views and pur
poses, "there never was," he said, "a
democracy as corrupt as a monarchy can
he." In a democratic country the great
est need is general education, and the
next greatest need is the training of the
individual."
Several other spicy pieces of comment
livened up his talk. Speaking of the re
sults preference primaries, he remarked
that "the only way to find out what the
people want is to spend so much money
you can't find out after all," and later
on took, notice of the fact that "in this
country, when we are not satisfied, we
form a Progressive party—we split off
and let the other side win." Speaking

of intense partianship, lie mentioned the
l he man who did not claim that "every
Democrat is a horse thief; I only said
that every horse thief is a Democrat."
"If the college boys ruled Santa Claia
county they would run it much better
than those who are running it now —
they would run some people out of
town," said Dr. Jordan.
However unfortunate the particular
situation may look, declared Dr. Jordan,
it is true now as it was before—"The
only way out is forward."
Dr. Jordan was introduced by J.
Hurley, president of Ncstoria, who also
concluded the meeting with words of
appreciation to Dr. Jordan.

growth of the political powers from the
time of the division between Jefferson
and Adams down to the present time,
and laid emphasis on the growth of the
"system," which he stated, has, during
most of the time since Grant, had a firm
hold on the Republican party —not be
cause the Democratic party is any more
virtuous than its opponent, but because
the "system" has found that, it can get
things accomplished better through the
agency of the Republican party. Dr.
Jordan quoted Hearst's statement that
"the Democrats as well as the Repub
licans have worshipped the Golden Calf,
but have not been able to secure recipro
cal attention from that animal." Wood
and Johnson were defeated by the
"system," he declared, and said that it
was through the influence of the polit
ical game that the Democrats left out
in the cold their strongest man available
for the nomination—Senator Owen of
Oklahoma.

| said Dr. Jordan, and in this connection
spoke of the difference between "bro
mides and "sulphides." 1 lu: former are
the oiks we can always count on, who
always go in the same old rut. while the
latter are the ones that have original
ideas, form their own opinions, and ac
complish something out of the ordinary,
whether it be good or bad. In deciding
how to vote, Dr. Jordan urged upon the
college students especially not to be
"bromides," but to act like "sulphides."
It is your duty not to he a 'bromide.' "
Although the parties today are not at
their best, as they do not represent
definite and contrasted views and pur
poses, "there never was," he said, "a
democracy as corrupt as a monarchy can
he." In a democratic country the great
est need is general education, and the
next greatest need is the training of the
individual."
Several other spicy pieces of comment
livened up his talk. Speaking of the re
sults preference primaries, he remarked
that "the only way to find out what the
people want is to spend so much money
you can't find out after all," and later
on took, notice of the fact that "in this
country, when we are not satisfied, we
form a Progressive party—we split off
and let the other side win." Speaking

of intense partianship, lie mentioned the
l he man who did not claim that "every
Democrat is a horse thief; I only said
that every horse thief is a Democrat."
"If the college boys ruled Santa Claia
county they would run it much better
than those who are running it now —
they would run some people out of
town," said Dr. Jordan.
However unfortunate the particular
situation may look, declared Dr. Jordan,
it is true now as it was before—"The
only way out is forward."
Dr. Jordan was introduced by J.
Hurley, president of Ncstoria, who also
concluded the meeting with words of
appreciation to Dr. Jordan.
"Nobody is going to vote tomorrow
with enthusiasm. There is nothing to he
enthusiastic about." This was one of
the keynote phrases sounded by Dr.
Jordan in his address on the "Present
Political Issues," given under the aus
pices of Nestoria in the Little Theatre
last night. "We are not going to elect
a Lincoln tomorrow," he said, and added
that his owit personal opinion was that
Harding 'would, be elected. Dr. Jordan
spoke to a crowd that filled the Littie
Theatre, and gave a very interesting
resume of the political situation, past
and present. He refrained from arguing
either tor, or against Cox or Harding,
and made no specific allusions as to
how the voter should act <>n the meas
ures which appear on the ballot today,
simply indicating in general terms the
situation and how it has come about.
Mentioning some of the issues of the
present campaign, Dr. Jordan cited llie
issue of individual freedom, meaning
principally not the right to free speech
and writing, hut to a more important
part of individual freedom—the right to
know the truth. Also, he declared,
temperance and privilege arc important
issues, but the tariff has ifo right to any
claim of that sort.

"We do not liavc party government
here," said Dr. Jordan, and went on to
explain how the true party system of
government is developed to a high de
gree in England. He also outlined the
growth of the political powers from the
time of the division between Jefferson
and Adams down to the present time,
and laid emphasis on the growth of the
"system," which he stated, has, during
