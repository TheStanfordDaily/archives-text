# ELECTION ISSUES OF TODAY DISCUSSED BY DR. JORDAN
## 
### 
"Nobody is going to vote tomorrow
with enthusiasm. There is nothing to he
enthusiastic about." This was one of
the keynote phrases sounded by Dr.
Jordan in his address on the "Present
Political Issues," given under the aus
pices of Nestoria in the Little Theatre
last night. "We are not going to elect
a Lincoln tomorrow," he said, and added
that his owit personal opinion was that
Harding 'would, be elected. Dr. Jordan
spoke to a crowd that filled the Littie
Theatre, and gave a very interesting
resume of the political situation, past
and present. He refrained from arguing
either tor, or against Cox or Harding,
and made no specific allusions as to
how the voter should act <>n the meas
ures which appear on the ballot today,
simply indicating in general terms the
situation and how it has come about.
Mentioning some of the issues of the
present campaign, Dr. Jordan cited llie
issue of individual freedom, meaning
principally not the right to free speech
and writing, hut to a more important
part of individual freedom—the right to
know the truth. Also, he declared,
temperance and privilege arc important
issues, but the tariff has ifo right to any
claim of that sort.

"We do not liavc party government
here," said Dr. Jordan, and went on to
explain how the true party system of
government is developed to a high de
gree in England. He also outlined the
growth of the political powers from the
time of the division between Jefferson
and Adams down to the present time,
and laid emphasis on the growth of the
"system," which he stated, has, during
most of the time since Grant, had a firm
hold on the Republican party —not be
cause the Democratic party is any more
virtuous than its opponent, but because
the "system" has found that, it can get
things accomplished better through the
agency of the Republican party. Dr.
Jordan quoted Hearst's statement that
"the Democrats as well as the Repub
licans have worshipped the Golden Calf,
but have not been able to secure recipro
cal attention from that animal." Wood
and Johnson were defeated by the
"system," he declared, and said that it
was through the influence of the polit
ical game that the Democrats left out
in the cold their strongest man available
for the nomination—Senator Owen of
Oklahoma.
