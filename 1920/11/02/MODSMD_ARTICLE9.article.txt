DAYTON, Ohio, Nov. 2. â€”Governor
Cox, having presented "his case to
the American jury" in twelve weeks
of constant stump campaigning, ar
rived home today, and cast his vote,
feeling more confident now than dur
ing any time of the long fight, that
the verdict would be in his favor.
In his final day of the campaign
the governor declared that his cam
paign had been based entirely on "a
great moral issue" and for that rea
son would not fail.
Governor and Mrs. Cox waited for
twenty minutes in a little polling place
in order to cast their vote.
With women voting for president in
Ohio for the first time, the doorway
to the store in which the Democrat
ic headquarters were, was jammed
with two lines of men and women
when the governor arrived.
The polling place was a small de
partment store and a one-man bar
ber shop as well.


James M. Cox.
