the men from Fort Miley, except that
they have a light team and are confident
that they can give the first year men a
good workout.
Most of the freshman players are in
good condition from last Saturday's
game with U. S. C.. and are anxious to
turn in a win Saturday to redeem them
selves for the poor showing they made
last week.
"Bud" Woodward, quarter back, has
an abscess on his knee that is causing
him trouble, but he will be in shape by
Saturday. "Scotchy" Campbell is also

was one of the pleasant features of the
game with the Southern freshmen.
The game is scheduled for 10 o'clock
Saturday morning.
