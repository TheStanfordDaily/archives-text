# INTENSE ACTION SHOWN IN PREPARING OF PLAY
## 
### (By S. M. Winklebleck, '23 
The Assembly Hall has been a scene
>f intense activity tiie past few days.
Carpenters, scene painters, electrici
ans and actors have been blended in
the pictuie, industriously preparing
for the "Pierre of the Plains" to be
stagen by Sword and Sandals, next
Friday night.
A conglomeration of noises arose
from the stage yesterday. Actors'
voices competed with the banging
hammers of the carpenters and the
wave of the painter's brush, added to
the scene of action. Far in the back
ground of the stage these painters
worked industriously, wihle at the
mid-way point the carpenters busied
themselves with the construction of
a mountain, pretentious in the third
act. Here and there and everywhere
electieians hurried about connecting
the wires which will show the campus
a system of wonderful lighting effects.
Everybody was on their toes and the
prediction of success bordered the
whole scene.
The dress rehearsals will be needed
preparatory to the production of the
play. Friday. The first dress practice
will take effect tonight and will be
mostly concerned with the lighting
effects. Tomorrow night Davis will
coach the final dress rehearsal which
will smooth over the rough corners
of the acting.
The seat sale is going on exception
ally well, although many good seats
can still be obtained.
To cap the evening Friday, the
Ram's Head Society is preparing to
give a dance at the Women's Club
House after the show. Music for the
dance will be given by the society's
own orchestra.
