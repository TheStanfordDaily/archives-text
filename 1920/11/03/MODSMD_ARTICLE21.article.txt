# REPUBLICAN PLEDGES
## 
### 
RETURNS thus far received indicate that Senator Harding' has been
chosen next President of the United States by a large majority, and
that a Republican majority has been chosen in the Senate. The change
in administration has been accomplished, and now the people will watch
the new government closely when it assumes control to see if the pledges
made by the President-elect and his party platform will be carried out.
Primarily, and through the work of the pro-league Republicans,
Senator Harding is pledged to "a" league, or association of nations. It
will take time, but the pro-league voters look confidently toward Mr.
Harding to make this country a member of either the present league or
a similar organization. If he has a majority of the Senate, as the returns
indicate, a modified plan should be adopted without a great deal of
trouble and presented to the nations of the world for approval.
The Republican party is pledged to ratify the peace treaty and end
the state of war existing between this country and Germany. This Gov
ernment cannot appear before the other nations and declare their work
is bad, as 1 lerbert 1 loover says, but it can submit changes which improve
the treaty and secure the signature of the United States.
The Republican party is pledged to bring the country to a normal
condition as quickly as possible. Ratifying the peace treaty is the first
step, and after this is done, the reforms that Senator I larding has prom
ised are in order. Lower taxation, labor reforms, immigration laws, the
protective tariff, and various other measures have been promised, and in
California Harding has promised aid on the Japanese question.
Senator Harding has straddled the fence on most important ques
tions and he has not promised many things, but he has made the pledges
r.oted above, and they must be kept.
The Republican party will assume control of the country in a short
time, and its continuation as the governing party depends on its answer
to the ultimatum of the people: "Show what you can do."
