# THE 						WASHING TON GAME
## 
### 
THE STANFORD VARSITY is on its way to Seattle to play the Uni
versity of Washington in the second Pacific Coast Conference game.
Upon the outcome of this game depends a good deal. Stanford's chances
against the California Hear will be better known, and if the Cardinal
wins from Washington, Stanford will be in the race for the honors at
Pasadena on New Year's Day. Nothing could be better than to have
Stanford and California decide which eleven should represent the West
against the East. Stanford people who witness the Washington State-
California game should root for the traditional enemy, for if Stanford
can't have the honors, we want California to have them.
