# Women's Service Board Issues Call For Helpers
## 
### 
The Women's Service Board wishes
that all women who have Thursday
afternoons free and who can do play
ground work, teach piano, singing, art,
kindergarten work, or who have ma
chines, would offer their services to
the Convalescent Home.
The main purpose of the Service
Hoard is social service work of various
kinds, but at, present, the work for
the quarter is to take care of the
Convalescent Home on Thursday
afternoons from 2 to 5:30. Women in
terested are asked to sign up with
Edna Wilbur, '21, or if any informa
tion is wanted, to inquire of Dorothy
Sherrard, *22. Those who can not get
away on Thursday afternoons may go
any day from 3 to 5 o'clock. All wo
men are urged to sign up for work for
at least one afternoon a week.
