TRAGEDY IN THE LIBRARY
Heard in ihe Lib: —"My dear! Do
you suppose tie'll get over it?
Un, wny didn't somebody tell me!
And we were having sucii a good time
—aim ju-si imagine what he must have
oeen tmnking of me!"
"What a suame! It's too bad. And
there's NOTHLnG you can do, in a
case like tiiat —it's hopeless. I'm aw
iully sorry!"
"Oil, I WISH I'd known. It would
uave been so EASY to lix —just settled
in a SniCOND —and now I can never,
never do anything that will make any
difference! 'io tnink !"
i liese whispered wails of anguish,
coming unmistakably straight from
tne heart, stirred ye ed. so profoundly
iliat he was on the verge of gallantly
offering his assistance. Then the
cause of the tragedy was revealed and
lie realized that, indeed, nothing could
ever, ever be done that would make
any difference.
The poor girl had gone a-queening,
and her EARS showed! —S. H.

A recent newspaper headline says:
"Edison Working on Machine to Talk
With the Dead." The Kansan thinks
that this ought to be good news to the
profs, who have eight o'clocks.

He'll Be a Landmark. All right!
"To the students who supported me
Tuesday in the election for the office
of Vice-President of the Student's As
sociation, I feel grateful towards you
and also towards the voters who voted
for the Honorable Clyde E. Barnes,
whom I find to be a splendid, gentile,
Christian gentleman.
"I have only been here one year, but
may be a campus land mark before I
leave. I rest the verdict in your judg
ment.
Yours truly,
J. ROSSER VENABLE."
—Daily Texan.

DON'T ASK US
Dollie had a little purse;
She kept it in her stocking;
If I should ask for change for five,
Would it be very shocking?

FREE AMUSEMENT DEPT.
Stanford provides many free things
in ihe way of concerts and like stuff.
F'r instance, the free concerts that
one can hear almost any time of day
while passing the Women's Clubhouse.
Then again there's the race to the Inn
every noon-time. And why go to the
movie show in Pally to see the hungry
peoples of Europe starving, when you
can see. the very same thing in front,
of the Inn for nothing?— Hungry
Harry.

"Remodeling the Dean of Women"
is the title of an article in the "Pic
torial" which will appear next week.
"Romodeling the Inn" could be the
subject for another good article. The
old shack next to the Library has out
lived its time. It remains as a chal
lenge to aesthetic incendiarism.

You tell 'em CABBAGE, you've got
a great head on you.
