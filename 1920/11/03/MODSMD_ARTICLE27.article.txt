# NEW GRIDIRON RULES EXPLAINED BY CAMP
## Most Radical Touches Scoring of Goal After Touchdown. Ball May Be Brought Out in Front of Posts at Distance Thought Most Desirableâ€”One Other Added Advantage Noted. 
### 
Walter Camp, well-known football
critic, In speaking of changes In the
rules for this season in Football Guide,
says:
"The most radical of the changes
made by the rules committee relates
to the scoring of a goal after touch
down. Ever since the introduction of
the game some forty-five years ago
the punt out after a touchdown has
been a part of the rules. This and
all rules relating to It have been
struck out, and hereafter if a touch
down Is made, whether directly be
hind the goal posts or at the extreme
corner of the field, the side making the
touchdown may bring the ball out in

front of the goal such distance as it
thinks desirable and from that point
make the try at goal.
"This means that a large majority
of the touchdowns will result in
goals, but it does not entirely elimi
nate the possibility of missing. In ef
fect, it makes the touchdown very
near equivalent to the seven points
which the rules allowed for a touch
down and its conversion into a kick,
without entirely doing away with the
kick. It has one other added advan
tage in that it tends to greater justice
In the matter of earned touchdowns
and touchdowns coming from flukes or
fumbles, for it is recognized that these
touchdowns are made directly behind
the goal post usually, because the run
ner has a clear field, whereas the
touchdown earned by driving with
scrimmage plays is made wherever the
attacking side can force it over.
This is likely to be much nearer the
side lines."
