### 
Whatever league Muskegon may be
In next year, the fans of the Michigan
town seem united on the point that
they want Doc Harris White to con
tinue as manager. White did not land
his Muskies in front in the Central
league race, lmt his team always put
up a good brand of baseball and that's
what counts. White was a pretty val
uable adjunct as player, as well as
manager, lie pitched and played first
base and did both well.
