# EUPHRONIA TO DEBATE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY AT BERKELEY, DEC. 4
## 
### 
Arrangements have been completed
for a debate between the Euphronia
Debating Society and the Congress
Debating Society of California, to be
held at Berkeley, December 4, accord
ing to an announcement given out last
night by G. W. Burch, president of
Euphronia. The subject will be on
nternational affairs, the definite sub
ject to be announced later.
This debate is an annual affair be
tween the winner of the inter-society
debates at Stanford and California.
As Euphronia and Congress were the
winners last year in Stanford and Cali
fornia, respectively, they are the
mes that will stage the debate this
vear. A hard contest is looked for
ward to, as California has some strong
speakers in the society which will
represent them, but Euphronia is con
fident that when the debate comes off
the Blue and Cold society's team
will meet, defeat. Varsity debaters
are not eligible for this debate, but
"lie local sot'iety has several varsity
transfers from other universities,
which will insure high class material
and may give California an unpleasant
surprise. Tryouts for places on the
team for this debate will be held a
week from tomorrow.
Tentative arrangements have also
been made by Euphronia for a debate
with Santa Clara. This debate will
be held in the winter quarter, and
definite plans for the contest have
not yet been settled.
