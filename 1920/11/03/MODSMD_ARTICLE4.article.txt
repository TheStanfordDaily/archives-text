## 
### 
Al. Carey, '21, left the campus this
niorir'ng with ij-l(X) in his pocket, which
lie will use to defray his expenses while
in the north with the Varsity team. The
money came from the pockets of fifty
other men who had taken a clikncc in
a proposition with hopes of being the
one who could accompany the Cardinal
eleven on its invasion of Washington.
Two dollars were collected from each
of the fifty men, and the drawing oc
curred late yesterday afternoon on the
lawn of the Beta Theta Pi house.
Carey's number was the last to be drawn
and he was proclaimed the lucky man.
