# CARDINAL ELEVEN MAY HOLD FIRST PLACE IN P.C.C.
## Stanford and California Are Now Leading Other Teams In the Conference Standing 
### 
Stanford's football s quad left this
morning for the north, where they will
meet the University of Washington
eleven Saturday afternoon, in an effort
to hold the thousand per cent standing
of the Cardinal in the Pacific Coast
Conference. Nineteen members of the
gridiron squad departed for Seattle, ac
companied by Head Coach Powell and
Line Coach Carpenter.
California and Stanford are now lead
ing the Conference, each having a
thousand per cent standing. Should the
Washington State team defeat the Blue

and Gold eleven when the two oppon
ents line up against each other on the
California field next Saturday afternoon,
the Cardinal will have another compet
itor for the first place* honors. The
game against the Bruins will lie the first
Conference match for the Washington
State this season, which makes it diffi
cult for any definite dope to he formed
as to the outcome of Saturday's game.
However it has been generally conceded
that the northerners have one of the
strongest teams of the Northwest this
year.
Coast Powell feels confident that his
men will come home with another vic
tory, although the men will be in poor
condition for football following the
long, hard trip to Seattle. The squad
will arrive at their destination Frida>
morning and will be put through t
stiff practice in the afternoon. Saturday
morning Coach Powell is planning t<
run the men through a light signa
workout and a short hike to limber up
the player's muscles.
Those traveling to Washington are:
ends, Pelouse, Adams Slaughterman;
tackles, Pershing, McAlpine, DeGroot.
llesler, Cravens; guards. Deems, Levy,
Stice; center, Righter, Rice; quarter
back, Bob Slaughterman; half-back,
