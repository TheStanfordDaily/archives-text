the initiative and referendum mea
sures on the ballot, which were in
complete hut considered representa
tive of the entire state, showed that
eleven out of twenty propositions on
the ballot were turned down.
The anti-alien land law was one
of those which passed. Results which
were scattered showed live to one in
favor. From districts where the Japa
nese question was especially aggravat
ing the vote was as high as six and
seven to one in favor of its passage.
Indications were that the Harris
liquor enforcement act which would
extend to state authority the power
of enforcement of prohibition, now

swamped it four to one.
Results of the vote on Amendment

The Single Tax proposition was
voted down as it has been regularly
in California at every election for the
past, several years.
The Absenteed Viting Measure —and
