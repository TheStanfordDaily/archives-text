SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 3.—Samuel
M. Shortridge, Republican, was lead
ing Plielan, Democrat, for the United
State senatorship in California, by
16,500 votes, at 11 a.m. today. The
count at that time stood Shortride,
144,751; Plielan, 125,000.
The figures at that hour seemed to
settle definitely the victory of Short
ridge while Phelan continued to gain
in San Francisco. His gains were not
sufficient, it was believed, to overcome
the vote which was rolling in for
Shortridge in Southern California and
the outlying precincts of northern
California.
