J You are so used to being asked that j
t question that you wonder if it really can *
* be done. Here is one opportunity for $
X you that will bear investigation.
There is a reason, and a logical one too +
| for this: First, we buy direct from the J
J importer. No broker comes between |
t us to get his fancy profit. Second, our *
| overhead expense is exceedingly low, %
J and that makes it possible for us to sell *
j on a closer margin of profit. And third, j
t we are content to sell and make a fair £
t profit, and thus sell more. This policy £
j will make us many friends, and help to ">
t increase our business. t
t We can and do sell Diamonds for Less! *
