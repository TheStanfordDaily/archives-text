### United Press 
CHICAGO, Nov. 4. â€”William J.
Bryan here today suggested that as
a result of the election President Wil
son should resign immediatly and al
low Vice-President Marshall to as
sume the office. Marshall, Bryan
s.ad, should then allow Harding to
b 'come secretary of state in his cabi
net and then, also, when Congress
meets in December, to resign and al
low Harding to start immediately in
the President's chair. The law of
regular succession would put Hard
ing in the President's chair if the pro
gram was carried out and Marshall
resigned.
"The people voted against the Wil
son League and for the association of
nations endorsed by the Republican
party," said Bryan, in an exclusive
interview willi the United Press. "It
would seem proper that Wilson re
spect that verdict and aid in carrying
it out by resigning at once. He will
surely find no pleasure in combating
a Republican Congress. It would also
enable Vice-President Marshall to be
come President for a short time, an
honor which he has earned.
