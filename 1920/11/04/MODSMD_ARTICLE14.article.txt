# SELWYNS SENSATIONAL PLAY RAGED NEW YORK FOR 400 APPEARANCES
## First Production in 1908 by Richard Bennett; Society to Give Dance After Show 
### 
"Pierre of the Plains" to be pro
duced by Sword and Sandals tomor
row night was first staged by Richard
Bennett in 1908 in New York City.
The drama had an extended run at
this city and packed one of the largest
theatres for over 400 nights. At this
time the play became immensely po
pular and has held up its reputation
for the past ten years.
The play was written by Edwin Sel
wyn, two years before its appearance.
Selwyn had lived in the northwestern
country for years. I lis life had been
affected by the exciting environments
and in his play he embodied a per
fect reproduction of North-Canadian
life.
After "Pierre of the Plains" had
met with unusual success with Ben
nett's Company in New York, it was
readily taken up by stock and road
companies. Later De Mille and other
prominent moving picture corpora
tions featured it 011 the screen. The
drama has had an entirely success
ful career. Its pretentious scenes, its
deep human interest, and its emotion
al arousing qualities, momentarily
lightened by spurts and stings of
comedy, stand responsible for its po
pularity.
The curtain will be raised tomor
row night promptly at S:l5 o'clock.
The shifting of scenes and the com
plete changes from one act to the
other makes this necessary.
After the play, the Ram's Head So
ciety will give its annual dance at
the Women's Clubhouse.
Tickets can be bought at Wilson's, on
the campus, and at Crandall's, in Pal >
Alto. Although the seats have been sell
ing rapidlv, there are several good seat>
left.
