# PELICAN PREDICTS BRUIN WALK-AWAY
## 
### 
The Big Game number of the
PELICAN appeared on the U. C.
Campus yesterday in a cover that
predicts a one-sided affair when Stan
ford and California lock horns on the
20tli of November.
The Golden Bear is showing his
teeth to a red-coated hunter, whose
hair is standing on end, portraying the
idea that the Blue and Gold has the
Cardinal beaten before the game
starts. This differs considerably from
the opinion of "Brick" Morse, the
famous California sport writer, who
says this year's Big Game will be the
best exhibition of football seen in the
bay region since 1899.
