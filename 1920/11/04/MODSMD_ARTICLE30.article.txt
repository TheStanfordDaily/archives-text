### United Press 
TOKIO, Japan, Nov. 4.—While the
Japanese foreign office has refrained
fi om making any statement following
■he passage of anti-Japanese legislation
in California on Tuesday, it was gen
erally understood by those in touch that
.1 formal protest against the program
would he made to the American slatt
leparttnent at Washington.
News of the results of the vote in
California has not been disseminated
throughout the country enough to make
informal popular protest noticeable.
Meetings of protest, however are in
nroject in Tokio. It was considered that
the opposition party would make
siderable attempt to overthrow the pres
ent cabinet on the grounds of the pre..
■Nt status of Japanese-American rela
tions.
Authorities believe that it will be
several days before demonstrations on
the part of the populace will come
about. They do not expect any violence
towards Americans, and apparently the
tenor of the people is less strained than
it was a few weeks ago.
The government, it was understood,
is taking the view that the situation is
already well in hand. It was believed
already that the nature of an agree
ment solving this situation in a manner
acceptable to both countries has been
given consideration.
