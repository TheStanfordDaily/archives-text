# EAST VS. WEST
## 
### 
THE struggle between the East and West for athletic honors has never
been decided to the entire satisfaction of both parties. College track
teams, baseball teams, swimming and tennis teams have invaded the
East, and have been successful more or less. Some Eastern teams have
journeyed West. and some of them have been successful, and some of
them have been beaten, with the result that the question is still
undecided.
The West can produce better men than the East in certain forms of
athletics, such as the sprinting events, where Paddock and Kirksey are
the premier performers; the fancy high diving in which Pinkston of
Stanford"- holds the honors, and in various other events. But the East
can show just as many stars, and the honors are still undecided.
1 lowever, the nearest way the question can be decided is by the
annual football game at Pasadena on New Year's Day, at which the
so-called best team in the East is invited by the athletic committee
representing the Tourument of Roses to meet the champion eleven ol
the West.
In the games played so far. the West has emerged the victor by
two games to one. The Washington State eleven defeated the Brown
University team and the University of Oregon eleven won from the
strong University of Pennsylvania aggregation. Last year Oregon lost
to Harvard by the close score of 7 to 6.
This season the team that wins first place in the Pacific Coast Con
ference race will probably represent the West. At present Stanford
and California are considered possibilities, although the results of the
games Saturday will give a better idea as to which team is going to
play. Both of the Oregon elevens have suffered defeats and the two
Washington teams will meet the California universities on Saturday
Nothing could be better than to see the Cardinal playing at Pasa
dena on New Year's Day, and if the hopes and wishes of the student
body count, the Stanford eleven will continue its onward march Satur
day and keep it up until the day of the East vs. West match.
