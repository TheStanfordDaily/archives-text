auxiliary tanks could bo placed on for
such purposes.

at San Francisco at 4 p.m. Monday
and not come down until she arrived
in New York City on Tuesday evening
at 6 o'clock or thereabouts."
The new airliner, which Lawson
believes will surpass the German type
of Zeppelin and the R33 and R34
turned out by Great Britain, is hav
ing the finishing touches put to it.
It is expected to take the air shortly.
