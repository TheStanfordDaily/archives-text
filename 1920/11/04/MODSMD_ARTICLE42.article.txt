the Advisory Board strongly recom
mends the desirability of a period of
residence in a provincial university, ex
cept under special circumstances.
Applicants must he either graduates
of a college requiring four years of
study for a degree of graduates of a
professional school requiring three years
of study for a degree. If not qualified
in either of these ways, applicants must
be twenty-four years of age and have
spent five years in an industrial estab
lishment in work requiring technical
skill. They must also be of good moral I
character and intellectual ability, and
must have a practical ability to use j
French books.
