BRIGHT SAYINGS OF ADULTS
When one lone U. S. C. frosh got
away down the field on Saturday, just
after the kick-off. before Stanford —
and even most of his own team —
realized he'd started; and carried the
ball across the line lor a touch-down,
a young thing down in front was
heard to remark, regretfully —"That
poor man ran all the way down the
field before he realized that the rest
weren't coming, too!" Such a shame
to tire him all out!

NOCTURNE IN AN ENCINA
COURTYARD
Throgh the night—
A sudden peal of notes.
Somewhere a saxaphone
Softly breathes its song.
A crash —an open window.
The air becomes red
And then the awesome cry—
WATER!
Silence. —R. B. M.

they ring the Roble doorbell and mur
