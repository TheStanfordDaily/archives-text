# COLLEGE NEWS BUREAU TO BE ESTABLISHED
## 
### 
Preliminary plans for the establish
ment of a collegiate news bureau of
all western universities have been
completed, with the selection of the
University of California as the central
office.
Representatives of the various col
leges interested in the scheme will
meet at Eugene, Oregon, on November
11. to discuss the proposal.
It is planned to make the news ser
vice similar to those maintained by
city newspapers, thus enabling the
different colleges to co-operate in pro
curing news of intercollegiate inter
est.
