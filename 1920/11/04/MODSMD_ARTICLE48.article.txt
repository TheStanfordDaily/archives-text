As an antidote for acute melan
cholia caused by gazing at the "lost,"
"misplaced," and "borrowed" notices
on our bulletin boards, Professor E.
W. Smith, chairman of the Stanford
chapter of the American Journalists'
Association, comes forward with an
example of Stanford honesty so out
standing that even a pessimist must
conclude that all is not lost —or mis
placed—or borrowed.
At the Stanford Chapter's first meet
ing, held last night, Chairman Smith
reported that when the finances of the
dinner recently tendered to the presi
dent of the United Press Association
were audited, the chairman found
himself just one dollar short. Smith
despaired of ever getting the dollar,
since he had no record to show from
whence it was missing.
Monday night, out of the Great Un
known came a voice over the wire
asking if this were Professor Smith.
Smith admitted ttie allegation and
the Voice went on to say: "This is
Mr. Man and I have not yet paid my
dollar for the Hawkins dinner. When
and how can I pay it?"
Dumfounded by this unique situa
tion, the chairman struggled to re
gain his senses and finally managed
to give the proper directions for guild
ing the shekel into the Association's
treasury. Today all is clear, includ
ing a man's conscience, a chairman's
finances, and the weather itself.
