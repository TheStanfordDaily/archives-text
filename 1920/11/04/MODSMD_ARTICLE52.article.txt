LONDON, Nov. 4. —London has
adopted the cocktail habit and no
establishment is now considered com- I
plete without an "American Bar."
The habit has especially caught on
with women and in the Ritz, Carlton,
Piccadilly and other well-known West |
End restaurants diners come early and
spend a preliminary half hours chat
ting over an "aperatif."
Nearly every Englishman now has a
particular "shaker" he swears by. At
the American Club, Collins, a colored
man, is declared to be the London
champion shaker, but those who fre
quent the Royal Automobile Club bar
speak reverentially of "Nick," who is
renowned as "a great artist."
