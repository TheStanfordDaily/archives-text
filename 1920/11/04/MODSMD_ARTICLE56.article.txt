# CALIFORNIA INSTALLS NEW PRINTING PRESS
## 
### 
A new press has been installed at
the University of California, which is
::apable of printing five thousand
copies of the Daily Californian an
hour. The press is ot' the flat bed
variety, but the paper is fed mechani
cally off a roll. This will greatly
facilitate the publishing of the uni
versity paper, as the old press re
quired twelve hours to run off the
same size paper as can now be print
ed in an hour on the new machine.
