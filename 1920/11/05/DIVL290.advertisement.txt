Why good students are not
always successful men
IN a certain art school it is said that
no medal man has ever become a
great artist. But it does not follow
that poor students afterward make the
biggest men.
Still this is true: Many good stu
dents are apt to miss the larger truths.
Their very nearness to text-book and
laboratory obscures their vision of the
basic laws which clarify all science and
indeed all life.
Studies are of value not so much as
exercises in the details of technical lore,
but as they help in the search for prin
ciples to use later in life.
Perhaps you will forget your calculus
formulae and the skilful use of the
ruling pen, but the ability to think
straight and to co-ordinate thought
with action — these are essential to
your fullest development.
You may grow to the stature of an
engineer who can sell, an engineer who
can direct other men, an engineer who
tcan build.
Think about your life that way, and
keep this fact before you—
The electrical industry needs men
who can see far and think straight.
Western Electric —an organization
which through half a century has had
a share in bringing the convenience of
electric light, power and communica- J
N __ tion to millions of Americans.
