# HUMAN INTEREST DRAMA READY FOR CURTAIN RAISING
## Suspense Is Keynote of the Drama; Society to Offer Dance in the Club House 
### 
One of the greatest "Human Inter
est" plays ever written in the his
tory of English dramatics will be pro
duced by Sword and Sandals tonight
in tho Assembly Hall. "Pierre of the
Plains," Edwin Selwyn's forceful play
of northwesthern Canada finds its
classification among the highest grip
ping and emotion arousing dramas
ever staged in American theatres.
Suspense is one of the keynotes of
the drama. The unique way in which
l he author compiles complications and
brings them to a climax draws from
the audience the most intense and
stirring emotional responses. His
study of human nature and the stimuli
which affect it is portrayed in each
minor scene of action.
Comedy also adds to the success
of the play. Even in the most serious
parts in the play a sharp spurt of
humor adds that satisfactory touch
which might have been lacking. The
play is not a comedy, nor is it a tra
gedy. It is a happy medium or the
golden mean of the two great ex
tremes of drama' ies.
Like other masterful works of
drama, "Pierre of the Plains" involv
es a love theme. Not the ordinary
theme of hero, heroine and villain,
but one that directly plays on con
ventionality closely bound with racial
differences.
Scenic arrangement is also one of
1 tie great factors in the "northwest
ern drama." Scenes and lighting ef
fects work in harmony with each act
ivity. The society has gone to a
greater expense that year than ever
in order that this detail might not he
slighted.
The curtain will rise promptly at
8:15 o'clock. Due to the elaborate
changes in scenes the show must
start promptly. Tickets will be sold
at the box ofiice.
After the play the Ram's Head so
ciety will give a dance at the Wo
men's Clubhouse. The music will be
given by the society's "own" orchestra,
which has recently been organized.
.Its debute tonight will be in keep
ing with the evening's festivities.
