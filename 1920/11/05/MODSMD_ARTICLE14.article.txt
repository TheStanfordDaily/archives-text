# MOISEIWITSCH CONCERT HERE TUESDAY EVENING
## 
### 
The program with which Moisei
witsch, the noted young Russian pianist,
will open the Peninsula Musical Asso
ciation's season in the Assembly Hali
next Tuesday evening is the one that
he played on his first appearance in San
Francisco two weeks ago.
The Bach Prelude with which the
program opens is based upon the theme
used by Gounod in the "Ave Maria,"
with which everyone is familiar. The
Schumann "Carnival." recently played
at the Little Theater, is a sequence of
short compositions of Schumann,
among them scraps of folk songs. The
"Appassionata" is perhaps the most
famous ot all Beethoven sonatas, and
the group of modern composers is a
representative one. Critics agree that
Moiseiwitsch's interpretation of the
Chopin numbers has seldom been
equaled since De Paehmann and that
the Liszt "Tarentella" should be seldom
attempted except by a master of tech
nique.

a. Prelude in C Bach
