# STANFORD SHOULD HOLD CONFERENCE LEAD TOMORROW
## Freshmen Prepare to Meet Balloon School Eleven Tomorrow Morning 
### 
Will Stanford and California main
tain their lead in the Pacific Coast Con
ference football series? This cutest ion
will be answered tomorrow afternoon
when the Stanford varsity meets the
University of Washington eleven at
Seattle, and the Blue and Gold team

plays the Washington State gridiron
players on California Field.
Stanford and California have 1000
per cent standing in the Conference,
each having won one game and lost
none. All the other members of the
Conference have been defeated with the
exception of the Washington State
aggregation, which will play its lirst
scheduled game in the series against the
University of California.
If Stanford defeats the University of
Washington eleven, tlie Cardinal will be
tied for first place in the Conference
with the winner of the contest which
will be played on the Berkeley turf
Saturday. Should the Sun Dodgers de
feat Stanford, the winner of the U. C.-
Washington State scrimmage will lead
the Conference alone.
Coach Powell's men are in supposedly
perfect trim for the Red's second game
of the P. C. C. Nineteen of the Palo
Alto players were put through a hard
drill and practice this afternoon in
Seattle, according to the announcement
of the plans of the coach before leav
ing for the north. The condition of the
men is probably somewhat still because
of the long, hard journey from Palo
Alto.
A definite lineup of the players cannot
be selected because of the condition of
several of the players. Righter will un
doubtedly fill the position in the center
of the line, while Deems and Cravens
will probably occupy the berths next
to him. At tackles either Pershing,
McAlpine or DeGroot will start play.
Pelouze, K. Schlaudeman o.r Adams wiil
start at ends. Bob Schlaudeman will
work at quarter, while the remaining
backfield positions are in the dark
Woollomes may .start at full instead of
Patrick. Wilcox or Campbell will work
in the right half, while Templeton will
play the first part of the game at left
half.
Special wire returns of the game will
be made in bulletins at the Union Build
ing Saturday afternoon, through the
Daily Palo Alto.
The varsity has arrived in Seattle
safely, according to a telegram from
Graduate Manager Ed Martin, and is in
fine shape. The weather prospects foi
the game tomorrow look good, the pre
dictions being for "fair and warmer."

The Cardinal Babes will meet the
gridiron squad from the Balloon School
at Fort Miley here tomorrow morning
in their last contest preliminary to the
big battle of the season with the Blue
and Gold freshmen. The first-year men
are in good contdition and with a few
new plays expect to put the soldiers on
the defeated list.
"Bud" Woodward, quarterback, will
be back in the game tomorrow after a
short period on the injured list.
"Scotchy" Campbell, who lias been out
of the play for a few nights with an
injured knee, will appear in his old posi
tion at halfback. Coach Duffy Seay has
decided to start Flood at center in place
of Dunbar, who lias been unable to play
his usual game for the last two weeks
on account of a "charley-horse." Fuller,
who has played a consistent game at end
this season, Will be used in tomorrow s
contest.
The strength of the opposing squad is
an unknown quantity. It lias been
rumored that the soldiers have a light
team, but that they are fast and spirited.
At any rate, the best material in the
freshman class will meet them when
they come out 011 the turf tomorrow.
San Jose High Scliuol was originally
scheduled to play the Babes, but the
contest was called off early this week.
Tomorrow's contest will close the season
of preliminary games for the local lirst
year men.
The lineup announced by Coach Seay
is as follows: L. E., Slater; L. T.,
Greenwood; L. G., Fullerton; C., Flood;
R. G., Arthur; R. T., Hartranft; R. K..
Judy; R H., Campbell, F., Hey.
Fuller; quarter, Woodward; R. 1-..,
