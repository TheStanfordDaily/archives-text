# PENINSULAR CONCERT SERIES IS HAVING A LARGE ADVANCE SALE
## 
### 
Plans are moving along with re
markable rapidity toward tho success
of the Sympl ony Concert Series
scheduled for Tuesday, November 30,
and Tuesday, January 5. Five hun
dred scats are being reserved in the
best part of the Assembly Hall for
students of the University. Most of
the tickets for these seats are in the
hands of members of the different
musical organizations, which consist
of the Orchestra, the Choir, Schubert
Club, and the Men'a Glee Club. Those
students desiring certain seats may
obtain them by stating their prefer
erce to any member of these organi
zatinos.
These concerts are given primarily
for the benefit of the students, and it
is hoped that the audience will be
composed chiefly of Stanford men and
women. The public is so eager for
tickets, however, that students should
reserve their seats at once in order
to be assured of a place at the con
certs.
If a person holding a ticket for the
series finds it impossible to attend the
second concert he may return the
ticket after January 1, and have his
money refunded.
