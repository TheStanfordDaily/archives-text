AFTER a six weeks' period of try-out work, the staff of The Daily
Palo Alto has finally been selected. Try-outs for positions on the
staff met with an unusual response this year and make the difficulty of
picking a limited number for the reportorial staff from the wealth of
material which turned out more than doubly difficult. At the same time
that the staff competition was being conducted try-outs for the positions
of news editor were being held, and here again the choice of the three
successful candidates was a hard one to make. As the final selections
stand The Daily Palo Alto staff is now on a working basis for the rest
of the year.
The first announcement to make regarding the staff is the ap
pointment of Jesse E. Thrash, '21. to the position of telegraph editor.
Thrash has served on the paper since his freshman year in the various
capacities of reporter, managing editor, and news editor. His promo
tion to this new position comes as a result of his ability shown as news
editor this year. As telegraph editor, Thrash will have complete super
vision over the United Press news received by The Daily.
The new news editors are H. J. I'orba, '22, C. M. Jenks, '22, and
\V. C. Evans, '22. They were picked following a six weeks competition
for these positions, during which time they proved their right through
their experience and ability for the position. S. N. Pierce, '22, has
earned the ranking place on the reportorial staff.
Twelve new people have been added to the staff, and their names ap
pear in the above staff list. Evidence of their ability is shown by the
fact that they were picked from over sixty tryoutees which reported at
the beginning of the year.
Ratings of the staff this year will be made on merit alone, as op
posed to the system formerly in practice of rating staff members first by
classes and then by merit. The new system of rating gives a good deal
of evidence of working out very satisfactorily.
