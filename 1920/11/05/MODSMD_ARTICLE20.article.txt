# UNIVERSITY DAILY PAPERS
## 
### 
TIIII recent expansion by the University of Southern California Trojan
from a four-column to a six-column paper, and the issue of a Saturday
paper by The Daily Californian mark the latest steps in college journal
ism on the Pacific Coast. The advances have been slow, and have been
hindered by many things but at present all the Pacific Coast universi
ties have excellent daily papers, although each has room for improve
ment.
The University of Washington Daily is one of the best, with six
columns and four pages. It serves a large student body and has always
been a credit to the institution. The Oregon Daily Emerald is a six
column, four-page publication, although smaller than the Washington
paper. The Oregon Daily Barometer is the same size.
The Daily Californian is a seven-column, six-page paper, and with
its six issues, leads the other papers on the Coast.
The Daily Palo Alto expanded last year to the same size as the Uni
versity of Washington Daily, and with the addition of a United Press
telephone service it easily leads the field in presenting outside news and
aiding the University community to keep in touch with world events.
Tt now remains for the other university papers to follow the lead
of The Daily California and of The Daily Palo Alto in their respective
methods of expansion, if their circumstances permit.
