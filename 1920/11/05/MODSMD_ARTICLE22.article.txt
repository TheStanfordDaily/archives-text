We learn from a news item in yes
terday's "Daily" that the only place
that they have American bars at pres
ent is in England.

At the rate contributions are com

our largest contributor eoon will be
the obliging compositor who sticks in
the spaces between CABBAGES.

SLICK DOPE
Gloomy Bus is worried. He pessi
mistically observes that when the
dance advertisement signs are becom
ing so numerous that it is a problem
to find space for a football card, and
when everybody at present is so busy
at the usual afternoon tea dance that
a bleacher rally seems insignificant,
it is time to adopt as our password
the old Latin phrase, "Et tu, Bando
line."

MISERERE
Birds are singing,—
Children laughing.
Bees lie drunken,
Stupid from the fragrance of
The flowers (despite the
Harris Act).
Chorus: "But anyone can plainly see
This doesn't mean a thing to me."
I have a chemistry examination
Tomorrow. —A.D.T.

We read in the papers last Sunday
where some astronomer was handing
himself a lot oil having just discover
ed a new star. That's nothing. Brick
Morse finds one every day in his
write-ups of the California super
eleven.
