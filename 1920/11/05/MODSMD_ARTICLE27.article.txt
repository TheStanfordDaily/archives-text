To insure a better run of pictures,
the Civic League of Palo Alto last year
appointed a committee to report on the
various films as they appear. Tlu' com
mittee early became affiliated with the
National Committee for Better Films,
whose headquarters are in New York.
The committee is striving to crcate a
demand for better pictures in Palo Alto
and to provide a means by which tne
people of the University and Palo A'to
may fiind out the type of play being
shown at the theaters.
Each film as it appears is repoited on
by a member of the committee and the
report is posted at the Community
House and the Public Library.
