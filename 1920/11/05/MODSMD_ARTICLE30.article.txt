# FOOTBALL CROWDS SET NEW ATTENDANCE ALL OVER COUNTRY
## 
### 
Football crowds this season will
easily shatter all records, according to
reports from all over the country. The
surprise has been the outpouring for the
early games. The Harvard-Center Col
lege encounter drew 40,000 people, a
crowd believed impossible for any but
a game with Princeton or Yale. Several
years an attendance of 4.00U or 5,000 for
a preliminary game at New Haven was
considered high, yet the Boston College
battle there on October 16 attracted over
25,1)00 to the huge bowl.
Princeton lias had record-breaking
crowds so far this season, and reports
of larger attendances come from all sec
tions of the country. Twice so far thi
year South Field has been found too
small to hold the number of fans who
went out to see Columbia play.
