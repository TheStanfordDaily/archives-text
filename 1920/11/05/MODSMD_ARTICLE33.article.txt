# ECON. DEPARTMENT SUBJECT OF STORY IN NEW PICTORIAL

"What of the Economics Depart
ment?" is the title of a searching in
quiry into the status of the Economics
departmont at Stanford, written by
Wylie Kilpatrick, '23, in the November
"Pictorial" which will be on sale next !
week. Kilpatrick is of the opinion
that all is not that it should be with
the present department, and goes
deeply into the causes therefore. His
conclusions will be of interest to at
least that 25 per cent of the Univer
sity which majors in the Economics
department.
Politics at Stanford seem to have
as much interest attached to them at
present as a city cafe oyster. Wil
liam F. Leiser, '21, in an article en
titled "Making Politics Interesting"
sees a way out of that situation. He
believes that through means of cer-!
tain stimuli, artificial and otherwise,
the student body can be made to take
an interest in its own affairs.
The new issue of the "Pictorial"
will contain a wealth of unusual action
pictures of the football games played
40 far this season. One picture taken
during the Oregon game has been
pronounced by newspaper photograph
ic experts as being one of the best
Football action pictures ever published
on the coast. The photographer
caught "Bill" Steers unloosing a drop
kick just as DeGroot and Pershing of
the Stanford line have broken through
the Oregon defense to block the kick.
Perfect lighting and a certain amount
of luck in catching the precise mo
ment when the play wa3 at its most
spectacular height combine to make
that photographic rarity, a perfect
football action shot. Besides thus pic
ture, the November "Pictorial" will
contain a two-page spread of foot
hall pictures, along with the usual
features of a "Who's Who on the
Campus" page and a page group of
pictures of "Current Events," includ- j
ing some unusual snaps of the "500"
during the Pan-Hellenic season.
