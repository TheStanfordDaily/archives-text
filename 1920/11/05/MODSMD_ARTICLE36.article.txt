# CARDINAL RUGBY SQUAD PLAYS HERE TOMORROW
## 
### 
The strength of Stanford's Rugby
team will be tested tomorrow afternoon
on the Stanford turf, when the Cardinal
ruggers clash with the champion squad
of Modesto High School. The Modesto
team has won all its games thus far
and is leading the San Joaquin Valley
League.
Harry Maloney has been practicing
his men hard this week, to round off
the rough edges of the squad before
the lirst game. There are over forty
live men out for the English game at
Stanford now, and prospects are good
for a winning team this year.
Although many of the candidates are
new at the game, Maloney is drilling
them carefully in the rudiments and is
hopeful of a good machine by the time
the first California game is due. The
backfield is exceptionally fast and fot
the most part composed of experienced
men. The forwards are fairly heavy,
and, although somewhat new at the
game, are learning rapidly.
The probable lineup for the game to
morrow is: Front rank Holstein and
Tritle; lock, Loomis; breakaway, Far
rish and Loder; rear rank, Mclvinnon
and Dwight; halfback, Grotidona; first
five-eighths, Moore; second five-eighths.
L. Young; center three-quarters,
Wright; wing three-quarters, Kelly and
Rogers; fullback, Rousselot; wing for
ward, Sherman.
