# CARD SOCCER ELEVEN MEETS OLYMPIC CLUB ON TURF TOMORROW
## 
### 
Cardinal soccer fans will have a
chance tomorrow to see their team in
action for tlie first time against a really
strong aggregation. The eleven meets
the men from the Olympic Club, one
of the fastest clubs in this part of the
country.
ihe Stanford team is in tirst-ciass
shape now and will offer a good game
for the spectators. They have not been
defeated so far this season and the
opposition is coming here also with a
clear record, so the two aggregations
will p'.ack up about even, according to
all available dope.
The Olympic team handed down a
walloping to the University of California
eleven last week, so the winner of Sat
urday's game should be the title holder
of the University and Club Soccer
League.
Coach Maloney is devoting most of
Ins time this week to his forwards.
They are the scoring machine, and with
out them the team cannot win. The
defense has worked perfectly in the
past and now the only thing left to do
is to strengthen the offense.
Weller at center forward for the
eleven is a consistent ground-gainer. He
is to the soccer team what "Swede'
lighter is to jJjq,..American varsity, a
tower of strength and after the ball ail
the time. He is at the same time a cool
player and so far has had no fouls
called against him.
Green, Peavy, Strauss and Clark make
up a clever line of forwards, and New
land, Mendonca, Anderson, Wing and
Adams take care of the work in the
backfield.
The lineups for tomorrow's game are:
Stanford: Ncwland, goal; Mendonca
and Anderson, fullbacks; Gorman,
Adams and Wing, halfbacks; forwards
Green, outside right; Peavy, inside
