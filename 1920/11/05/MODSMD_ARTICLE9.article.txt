# CRITICISM MUST YIELD TO CONSTRUCTIVE WORK SAYS HERBERT HOOVES
## 
### WYLIE KILPATRICK, '23 
Declaring that the election marks the
turning point in the Republican party
from an attitude of necessary criticism
to one of responsibility for futui o cor.
structivc work, Herbert Hoover in an
interview yesterday indicated the prac
tical manner in which the G. O. P. cam
paign pledges must be fulfilled.
"Our entry into the League on the
basis of any military obligation is cer
tainly dead," is the outstanding deduc
tion to be drawn from the Tuesday
election, in the opinion of the former
food administrator. Mr. Hoover, how
ever, pointed out that the President
elect has repeatedly committed himself
in favor of some form or other of a
world association and is willing to take
the good features of both the Varsailles
League and the Hague Tribunal in
forming such a league.
"All this points to construction," con
tinued Hoover. "The party in elaborat
ing a league, such that will rest upon
moral pressure and judicial institutions,
will contribute America's part and will
eliminate any possible infringement
upon our sovereignty and will yield to
ns the protection that we ourselves
need."
Serious domestic problems demand
immediate attention and solution in the
judgment of the famous Stanford
alumnus. "We are in a critical need of
wise legislation to meet the problems
pertaining to agriculture, transportation,
foreign commerce, housing and a score
of other pressing issues sadly neglected."
The responsibility for the solution oi
these questions, asserts Hoover, has
been squarely placed upon the Repub
lican party. "Now that the party holds
not only the executive department, but
large majorities in both the House and
Senate, it has the full responsibility of
giving to the American people the
greatest era of construction in half a
century."
