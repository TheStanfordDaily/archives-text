TURKISH
Mrs. Fox was bragging one day about the large
number of her cubs.
"How many cubs do you bring into the world at
one time?" she asked the LIONESS. .
"Only ONE, replied the Lioness —"but it]s a
LION."
MURADS COST 20XENTS for a BOX
of 10—BUT THEY'RE MURADS!
MURADS would be lower priced if we left out
all or part of the 1 00# Turkish tobaccos of the purest
and be& varieties grown —or if we substituted inferior
grades of Turkish tobacco.
But they wouldn't be MURADS —they'd only be
Foxes!
"Judge for yourself—!"
