# LESTER SEIB '22 STARS IN "PIERRE OF THE PLAINS"
## Sword and Sandals Sensation Marks Epoch in Dramatics Scenic Effect Pretentious 
### My S. H. WINKLEBLECK, '23 
The production of "Pierre of the
Plains" by Sword and Sandals last Fri
day night marks an epoch it campus
dramatics, according to the more experi
enced dramatic critics of the campus.
There were those parts which seemed
t ) drag aftimes, like in all di,dints pro
duced by purely amateur talent, hut as
a whole, considering from all angles,
the play was justified in being placed
at the peak* of all past dramatic suc
cesses.
The scenic arrangement, with its har
monizing blend to the action of the play,
was a deciding factor in the success of
the drama. The most pretentious scene,
that which followed the killing of Jap
Dtirkin, was worked out to perfection.
The silhouetted form of Pierre against
a hazy blue sky in the background and
then the glow of a match which lit the
Indian's cigarette and depicted his facial
expression gave an unrestrained force to
the act.
Each actor deserves comment for his
work in the play. Miss Woodhead,
carrying the role of Jen Galbraith. was
very suited for her part. Her first ap
pearance on the stage that evening
showed a slight bit of stage fright, but
she soon warmed to the surrounding
conditions and put herself wholly into
the feeling of her part. She had per
sonality, repression and intensity and
handled her role with great cleverness.
Lester Seib, as usual, put forth his
best. His French dialect in the p-;rt of
Pierre was exceptionally well handled.
The sole workings of his part was full
(if emotions, lightly touched off with
witty lines, and Seib did them justice.
] le was the star actor of the play.
The comic character, Matt Bradly,
played by Charles Arnn, was carried in
iis same old style as lie used in Sin
Sin," the Ram's Head farce last year.
A run's long, lanky body, moved by
diligent gestures, gave a touch to the
part which could only be obtained by
his type of physique.
Then to the more sturdy part of Ser
geant Tom Redding, Hal Brown brought
that reserved militaristic attitude and
high ideal of manhood which binds the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police. He
fitted to his part like a glove and did
well to help make the play a success.
Robert Patten was also fitted to his
part of the father of Jen, as he readily
assumed the characteristics of a con
siderate, but vet deliberate, old gentle
man. William Sheils was good in his
part of the brother, as well as Marvel
Donahue, "the bad man. ,
In fact, Stoddard Atwood, the priest;
lack Hefferman, as Inspector Whitby of
the Mounted Police; Eugene Curtis in
the part of Corporal Tim Kearney, and
Raymond Haizlip and Adelini Selna as
types of the northwestern Indians, all
kept pace with the more principal
actors. . , e .
Overlooking those minor detects
which seem to always show up "i ama
teur productions, the show in itselt was
a great success, but fault can be fomid
bv a certain group of individuals which
were in the audience. Their unapprecia
tive tendencies seemed to loom up at
times, must to the disgust of those who
witnessed the drama with an eye ol
realization. Even in parts which were
most cleverly handled these persons
seemed to show no regard for the actors.
