# PICTORIAL HALL OF FAME DEVOTED TO CAMPUS PROFITEERS
## 
### 
"We Nominate for the Hall of Fame"
is the title of a page of caricatures of
campus business men drawn by George
Hall, '19, for the November issue of
the "Stanford Pictorial," which will be
on sale next Thursday. Hall's drawings
form a splendid black and white satire
on the many profiteers who infest our
local community.
Two women writers have contributed
articles of a sensational nature to the
next issue of the "Pictorial." One of
them, "Where There Is So Much
Smoke," by Florence Hocking, '22, is a
breezy essay on the subject of the col
lege woman and the deadly germ of
"Smokeitis." She- discusses all the
symptoms of the malady brought about
by the bite of this bug and concludes
with a suggestion of a violent form of
treatment for the patient. The other of
these two articles is "Remodeling the
Dean of Women," by Ellen Calhoun,
'20. In it she takes up the attitude of
the woman student towards Dean Brad
ford and gives some valuable sugges
tions to both the administration and the
student body.
In "Alma Mamma Speaks." Lester
Levy, '19, a recent alumnus, has given
some novel suggestions on how the
alumni reunions should be handled.
Saying that the present system of hold
ing reunions at commencement time re
sults in a reunion having as much life as
a City Cafe oyster, he proceeds to give
his own plan.
"A Word for Destruction" is the title
of an editorial by Editor R. W. Kenny,
'21. The "Pictorial" will go on the Quad
next Thursday.
