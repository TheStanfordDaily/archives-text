the Peninsula Musical Association con
cert season tomorrow evening in the
Assembly Hall, is now in San Francisco
and will appear there in a program this
evening presented in conjunction with
the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra
under the direction of Alfred Hertz at
the Civic Auditorium. He will appear as
a soloist and will play two concertos
with the orchestra, although one con
certo is usually consideerd a sufficient
task for a pianist. In addition, Moisei
witsch will play the closing number of
the program, a Liszt fantasia.
The program will open with an.or
chestral arrangement of the prelude to
Wagner's "Lohengrin." Moiseiwitsch
will then play in succession, with the
orchestra, the A minor concerto of
Schumann and the B flat minor con
certo by Chaikovski. Another number
will then be given by the orchestra and
Moiseiwitsch alone will close the pro
gram with a Liszt selection.
Moiseiwitsch is considered by critics
one of the most promising of the
younger virtuosos and has been a fav
orite both in Europe and America ever
since his appearance in England about
twelve years ago. He is now making his
second concert tour in America and is
appearing this season as a soloist with
most of the larger orchestras of the
country, his name being included in the
concert lists of over fifty cities.
