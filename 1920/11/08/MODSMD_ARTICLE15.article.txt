# FRENCH WAR MOONS RECEIVED AT STANFORD
## Collection Presented to Local Museum Through Courtesy of Harvard Club of S. F. 
### 
Stanford has just received a fine col
lection of French War Cartoons through
the Harvard Club of San Francisco.
The collection includes several hundred
items and covers a wide range of sub
jects that are of artistic merit. Some
of the posters designed to arouse public
support for various war enterprises are
of high artistic value, while others are
simple almost to the point of crudcness,
though having that force and strength
behind them peculiar to French War
Posters. There are many cartoons from
newspapers and popular magazines, as
well as reproductions of paintings of
war episodes which were printed in sucn
magazines as "L'lllustration and sim
ilar publications.
The Harvard Club of Paris made the
collection and transmitted it to the
Harvard Club of San Francisco with
the request that it be later transmitted to
one of the local universities. Mr.
William Thomas of the San hrancisco
Club has now sent it to Stanford on
account of the interest which the late
Vanderlynn Stow, who was business
manager of the university, had in the
collection and in Stanford. The San
Francisco Harvard Club had a display
of the collection and it has been turned
over to Curator Pedro J. Lemos of the
Stanford Museums.
