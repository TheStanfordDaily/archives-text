# FRESHMEN DEFEAT FT. MILEY PLAYERS BY 98 TO 0 SCORE
## 
### 
Coach Seay's Cardinal Babes handed
the team from the Balloon School at
Fort Miley a 98 to 0 pasting Saturday
morning. The balloonists showed up
with eleven men in uniform, but they
boasted of very little teamwork. The
Freshmen romped over the goal line
fourteen times during the combat.
In the opening half the first string
players ran up 54 points. The second
string men sarted the second half and
some of them were replaced by the
balance of the squad. Every man on the
squad had a part in the general field day
that developed. It appeared very much
as if the Babes were benefited by early
rising, although there has been a ques
tion raised as to whether the Freshmen
played better than usual or the airmen
played worse.
The game was not interesting to
watch. The Fort Miley men offered
practically no offensive. They did force
the Freshmen to resort to end run plays
by piling them up every time they al
temptqjl a line buck.
