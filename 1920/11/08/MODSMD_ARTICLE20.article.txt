# Stanford Wins First Rugby Game of Year From Modesto High
## 
### 
Stanford could turn out a winning
Rugby team was solved when the
Cardinal fifteen scored a 26 to 10 vic
tory over the strong Modesto High
squad here Saturday. Modesto had a
fast and fairly heavy set of experi
enced players who had defeated most
of the teams in the San Joaquin Val
ley.
Stanford did most of its scoring in
the early part of the game, while the
men were fresh. Lack of the proper
condition was responsible for the slow
ing up of the Cardinal players dur
ing the second half.
Rogers, playing wing for Stanford,
showed lip well. He made two trys,
and got away for several good runs.
