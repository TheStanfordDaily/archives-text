# Sophomores Give Aid To Convalescent Home
## 
### 
A new Stanford tradition is being
established by the present sophomore
class in the aid they are giving every
week to the Stanford Home for Con
valescent Children, which is located here
in the old Stanford home. Every Satur
day the sophomore class sends over
eight of its members to help from 8
to 12 in the morning in repairing and
maintaining the grounds of the home.
This home, which is supported by the
public, takes care of children sent down
from the Lane clinic in San Francisco to
get a chance at living in the open coun
try for a while. The building is rented
to the home by the university for a
dollar a year. Many prominent Stanford
men and women are interested in the
home. President Wilbur taking an active
part in its direction, while Dr. Gardner
is chairman of the board of trustees.
