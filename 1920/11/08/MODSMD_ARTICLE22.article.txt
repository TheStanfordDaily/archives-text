"Dink" did it. Templeton's educated
too kept Stanford tied for the lead in
the Pacific Coast Conference by scoring
a lone three points against the Univer
sity of Washington last Saturday at
Seattle. The Cardinal drop kick came
in the second quarter of play following
an aerial attack which brought the bali
to Washington's 25-yard line. Temple
ton, dropping back to the 40-yard line,
sent the ball sailing over the white bar.
Washington started the game with a
rush, getting the ball in purple and gold
territory and carrying it, by a series of
line smashes and end plays, to the Stan
ford 30-yard line. There the south
erners stiffened their resistance, and
Wilson tried a drop kick from the field.
The ball went wide, and after Templc
ton had punted out of danger the Stan
ford goal was never again seriously
menaced.
After the one Washington offensive
it became apparent that neither side
could gain appreciably through the line,
and the game resolved itself into kick
ing contest between Templeton and
Wilson. The Cardinal halfback, arching
his punts high into the air for gains of
40 to 50 yards, had the advantage, the
ball being played in Washington terri
tory most of the time in the final period.
Twice after he had scored the win
ning points of the game, Templeton
tried for drop kicks, one from tiie center
of the field and once from the 30-yard
line, but both attempts failed. In the
second period Schlaudeman broke away
for a beautiful 40-yard run through a
broken field, but Wilson's tackle
brought him down, and Eckmann, inter
cepting a forward pass on the next play,
ran the ball out of danger. Patrick,
Stanford fullback, several times was
able to gain through the line, but in
every case the Washington forwards
finally held and forced the southerners
to kick.
Coach Powell's men showed tip in
excellent form and kept the ball in the
Sun Dodgers' territory during the
larger portion of the game. The Car
dinal punting and forward passes were
responsible for most of Stanford's
gains. Hoi) Schlaudeman, playing quar
terback, found the Washington line
holding like a stone wall, and early in
the contest he started an attack 011 the
northerners' secondary defense, which
was materially weaker.
Washington's scrimmage proved a
fairly easy struggle for the Palo Alto
team, and let the southern team leave
the field in good condition. With all of
the members of the football squad out
for a heavy practice in the next two
weeks. Coaches Powell and Carpenter
will devote their entire attention to the
correction of all the minor defects of the
Cardinal players.
Because Stanford and California both
stand at the head of the Paci ic Coast
Conference standing, the big game on
November 20 will determine the coast
championship. The Blue and Gold held
their place in the Conference by defeat
ing the Washington State eleven last
Saturday by a 49-0 score.

"Dink" did it. Templeton's educated
too kept Stanford tied for the lead in
the Pacific Coast Conference by scoring
a lone three points against the Univer
sity of Washington last Saturday at
Seattle. The Cardinal drop kick came
in the second quarter of play following
an aerial attack which brought the bali
to Washington's 25-yard line. Temple
ton, dropping back to the 40-yard line,
sent the ball sailing over the white bar.
Washington started the game with a
rush, getting the ball in purple and gold
territory and carrying it, by a series of
line smashes and end plays, to the Stan
ford 30-yard line. There the south
erners stiffened their resistance, and
Wilson tried a drop kick from the field.
The ball went wide, and after Templc
ton had punted out of danger the Stan
ford goal was never again seriously
menaced.
After the one Washington offensive
it became apparent that neither side
could gain appreciably through the line,
and the game resolved itself into kick
ing contest between Templeton and
Wilson. The Cardinal halfback, arching
his punts high into the air for gains of
40 to 50 yards, had the advantage, the
ball being played in Washington terri
tory most of the time in the final period.
Twice after he had scored the win
ning points of the game, Templeton
tried for drop kicks, one from tiie center
of the field and once from the 30-yard
line, but both attempts failed. In the
second period Schlaudeman broke away
for a beautiful 40-yard run through a
broken field, but Wilson's tackle
brought him down, and Eckmann, inter
cepting a forward pass on the next play,
ran the ball out of danger. Patrick,
Stanford fullback, several times was
able to gain through the line, but in
every case the Washington forwards
finally held and forced the southerners
to kick.
Coach Powell's men showed tip in
excellent form and kept the ball in the
Sun Dodgers' territory during the
larger portion of the game. The Car
dinal punting and forward passes were
responsible for most of Stanford's
gains. Hoi) Schlaudeman, playing quar
terback, found the Washington line
holding like a stone wall, and early in
the contest he started an attack 011 the
northerners' secondary defense, which
was materially weaker.
Washington's scrimmage proved a
fairly easy struggle for the Palo Alto
team, and let the southern team leave
the field in good condition. With all of
the members of the football squad out
for a heavy practice in the next two
weeks. Coaches Powell and Carpenter
will devote their entire attention to the
correction of all the minor defects of the
Cardinal players.
Because Stanford and California both
stand at the head of the Paci ic Coast
Conference standing, the big game on
November 20 will determine the coast
championship. The Blue and Gold held
their place in the Conference by defeat
ing the Washington State eleven last
Saturday by a 49-0 score.
