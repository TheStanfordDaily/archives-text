ALTHOUGH the freshman football eleven has not demonstrated itself
to be a wonderful team thus far it will represent Stanford against
the California freshmen here on Saturday, and as a Stanford team the
freshmen should receive the hearty support of the student body.
For some unknown reason Stanford has not produced wonderful
first-year teams in the last few seasons, and the California freshmen
teams seem to have gained in power. This year the freshman eleven
has played the best they know how, and no one has ever accused them
of quitting. They have not excited the Coast with phenomenal work;
but they have played a steady game.
On the basis of scores the California team should beat the Stanford
men, but this comparison does not take into account the Stanford Spirit,
which is such an important factor in the Varsity's success. The fresh
men have been here long enough to become exposed to the Stanford
enthusiasm, and it should tell in their work against the Berkeley team.
The Daily Palo Alto is confident that the freshmen will put up
the fight of their lives against the team from across the bay, and will
not leave the field until they have given their best.

Coach Powell's gang of scrappers came through up north, and at
the rate they are going now, nothing will stop them this side of Pasa
dena.
