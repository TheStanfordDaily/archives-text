# ENGLAND'S 'JILLS' BUILDING HOUSES
## Claim Large Saving Made by Women Working in Building Trade 
### United Press 
LONDON, Nov. 1 (By Mail).—"This
is the house that Jill built."
The Jills of England are competing
with the Jacks in many trades hitherto
monopolized by men and an interesting
adventure into the building trade is now
being made by a firm styled "Women
Builders," which has its offices at 56
Victoria Street.
The women's pioneer in this move
ment is Mrs. Oliver Strackey, who has
just completed the building of her own
house at Haslemere. For this house she
was her own contractor and employed
almost exclusively female labor, women
ramming the walls, shoveling the earth
and distempering the rooms.
However, a mere man bricklayer built
the chimneys and a burly male carpenter
made the doors.
Mrs. Strackey is now busy building
another house and is increasing her
number of women workers. Many ex
farmerettes and others have applied to
her for employment in the building
trade. In the spring the private com
pany which is being formed with Mrs.
Strackey at its head will launch out on
a bigger scale and undertake the build
ing of houses large and small, cottages,
garages, etc., for clients who can, if
they wish, supply their own plans.
On the lirst house she built, Mrs.
Strackey claims she saved at least £200
(about $1,000) and the old-established
male contrators are beginning to look to
their laurels, for the women have proved
themselves just as efficient as men at
the work and quite a lot quicker.
