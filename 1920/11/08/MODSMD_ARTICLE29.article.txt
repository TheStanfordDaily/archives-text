### United Press 
PHILADELPHIA. Nov. B.â€”Terpsi
choreans here were manifesting a greai
deal of interest over the controversy on
dancing thai is raging between the Y. M.
C. A. and the Philadelphia Presbytery.
The Young Men's Christian Associa
tion has announced that it will include
dancing in its varied curriculum, inas
much "as demands have been received
from large numbers of Christian peoples
asking that we organize a dancing
class."
The local Presbytery, however, who
say they represent a large number of
the Christian element, "felt called upon
to object strenuously to a Christian or
ganization conducting a class of dancing
in its wails."
"The youth of today demands danc
ing.'' the Y. M. C. A. countered, "and
it is far safer for young men and
women to receive instruction in the art
under the careful supervision of Chris
tian instructors. The Y. M. C. A. feels
that when this amusement is so con
ducted it is free from evil and helpful
rather than a harmful feature from a
social standpoint."
