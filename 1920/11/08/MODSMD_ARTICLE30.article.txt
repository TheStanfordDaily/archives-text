PARIS, France, Nov. 8. â€”President
Millerand has amazed some of the old
residents of Paris by appearing on the
streets of the city apparently without
a guard. Scores of persons recognized
the French president when he walked
the other day through the Elysee Palace,
through the Champs Elysees, toward the
Seine, and his progress was marked
by a succession of bows. Not a detec
tive wjiS in sight.
This is in sharp contrast to the prac
tice of former presidents. Few of them
ever have ventured fortli alone, and
in most cases they have been surrounded
by a strong guard of detectives and po
lice. M. Millerand's democratic atti
tude in this respect has caused much
comment and increased his popularity.
