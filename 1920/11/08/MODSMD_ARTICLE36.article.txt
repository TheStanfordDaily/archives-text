LONDON, Nov. 8. â€”Sinn Feiners
have secured one of their bloodiest vic

police, according to the London Star.
They were reported to have killed
seventeen police in an ambush near
Ballin Alle. The Star correspondent
said machine guns were used to cut
down the troops.
The reports of the attempt were re
ceived here as Premier Lloyd George
and Sir Hamar Greenwood, Irish secre
tary, were congratulating a party of the
Royal Irish Constabulary on their work
and expressing confidence that they
would end Irish disturbances.
