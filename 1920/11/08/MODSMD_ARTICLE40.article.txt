# Utah Men Go In For Aesthetic Terpsichore
## 
### 
j Aesthetic aspirations are no longer
restricted to the feminine sex. Hith
erto inexpressed yearnings of the out
wardly dispassionate men students of
the University of Utah will be given
an opportunity to make themselves
known in the inarticulate contortions
!of nymphs and elfs. In other words,
I a ( lass in aesthetic dancing for men
baa been started at Utah. There was
a rush for registration as soon as the
c-slass was announced, and according
to indications the Utah gymnasium
will be crowded with fairy princes
every morning.
