# MARSHAL FOCH NOW HEADS INTERALLIED MILITARY COMMISSION
## 
### HENRY' WOOD (United Press Staff Correspondent 
PARIS, Nov. 1 (By Mail). —Marshal
l'och, who two years ago, November 11,
received the surrender of the German
armies at Rcthondes in Compeigne For
est, today holds the theoretically impos
ing position of military adviser to the
world.
His official title is "president of tiie
Interallied Military Commission of
V ersailles." This body is a continuation
of the old Supreme Command of the
war. Its function is to act as general
clearing house for all military affairs
touching the former Allies. It includes
representatives from all the former
belligerents except the United States and
the Central Powers, and holds frequent
meetings in Paris.
Behind the little bleu sign "Etat-Major
de Marechal Foch," at 34 Boulevard de
Courcelles, the conqueror of Germany
sits at his office desk every morning
from 10 until noon and every afternoon
from 2:30 until 5. His aides report he is
busy most of the time—reading tele
grams from military attaches of Allied
nations in various parts of the world,
conferring with military representatives
of various powers, preparing reports for
the Council of Ambassadors when miii
tary counsel is needed, giving advice to
some of the younger Allies now carry
ing on little wars of their own, etc.
From time to time he ijiiits Paris to
accompany the premier of France as
general military adviser at one of the
many conferences of prime ministers
which have been one of the new features
of European diplomacy since the war.
He generally travels in the same rail
way coach in which he was living when
he received the German commander. No
vember 11, 1918. This coach is always
at his personal disposal, whether for
official or unofficial trips. Sometimes his
wife accompanies him—on the unofficial
journeys.
Foch's relation to the French army is
the same as it was during the latter
part of the war. Being head of the

interallied military staff he is barred
from active command in any of the
national armies, but free to give advice
whenever required.
In addition to his professional duties,
Marshal Foch has a secondary but
rather time-consuming "ceremonial" roie
which frequently calls him away from
his family hearth to speak at interallied
or French memorial services, inter
national dinners, cornerstone layings and
the like.
For to the world at large and France
in particular he is still the living per
Bonification of the victory for which it
paid so dearly in human life.
