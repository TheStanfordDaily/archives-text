# Berkeley Takes Action Against Airplane Stunts
## 
### 
Mayor Louis Bartlett of Berkeley has
ordered his secretary, J. H. Kimball, to
prepare an emergency ordinance for
passage at the Tuesday session of the
City Council, forbidding the flight of
airplanes over the football field at the]
big game between Stanford and Caii-1
fornia. The emergency ordinance will
call for a certain number uf feet below;
which no stunts will be allowed over [
the city.
This action was taken following many
protests registered after the game Sat-1
urday between California and Washing
ton State, when an airplane performed
recklcssly above the heads of the spec
tators.
Either Mayor Bartlett or Councilman
Charles D. 11 eywood, Department of
Public Haiti) and Safety, will present
the ordinance. Heywood characterized
the exhibition of Saturday as one of
foolhardincss that was far beyond the
realm of common sense.
Heywood pointed out that an airplane
falling from a distance of 3000 feet
would go through a well-built roof.
Stunt planes usually start their antitcs
at an elevation of SOOO feet, and the re
sults of a fall from that heighth into
a closely-packed grandstand would
doubtless result in the death of hun
dreds of people.
The ordinance lias been classed as an
emergency order so that passage will be
assured on Friday. An ordinary meas
ure takes at least a month in passage.
The circumstances causing the request
for a special ordinance governing the
flight of airplanes is deemed* urgent
enough to place it in the special class !
which wiil permit of immediate passage.
