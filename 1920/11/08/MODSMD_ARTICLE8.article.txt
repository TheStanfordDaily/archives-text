# REFUND WILL NOT BE MADE ON SEATS FOR SECOND CONCERT
## 
### 
It will be impossible to make any
general refund to the holders of season
tickets who are unable to attend the
second of the Symphony Concerts, ac
cording to a statement made by the
Symphony Committee today. The an
nouncement made on Friday that a re
fund would be made on all tickets re
turned after January 1 arose out of a
misunderstanding of an announcement
made to the different musical organiza
tions on the campus.
The cases of students who will not
return next quarter will be given special
consideration. The committee will base
its decision in such eases on the fact,
that the student is to be in some other
part of the State and so cannot attend
the concert on January 25. Since all
tickets are transferable, they may be j
disposed of without consulting the com
mittc at all.
Five hundred seats have been re
served for the Stanford students, most
of which have already been subscribed
for. All applications for seats in this
section must be in before Thursday, |
The price of admission for the two con
certs lias been reduced to $2. All checks
should be made out to the Stanford
Symphony Committee and addressed to
the Committee on the campus. Tickets
may also be obtained through any mem
ber of the musical organizations.
Among the numbers to be given in
the lirst concert are "Peer Gynt Suite,"
by Greig. and the Fifth Symphony of
Tschaikowsky. The Glee Club will sing
some of the compositions by Shubcrt,
Rachmaninoff and Grieg at one of the
concerts.
