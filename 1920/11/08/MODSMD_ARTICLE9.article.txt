# CONSIDER PACT TO NULLIFY NEW CALIFORNIA LAW
## Prepare to Meet Jap Protest Against Land Ownership, by Exemption Says Report 
### United Press 
WASHINGTON, Nov. B.—A plead
ing under which Japanese would be
exempted from American laws dis
criminatory to Asiatics is being consid
ered at the state department, it was re
ported here today.
Such a pact would be one way of
meeting the Japanese protests against
the new California law prohibiting
ownership of land by Japanese and other
Asiatics. Negotiations as a result of
this protest have been in progress for
some weeks.
As now being considered, the treaty
would guarantee Japanese subjects in
this country the same rights that most
foreigners have here^.
The treaties now under consideration,
if passed, would exempt Japanese from
the present California law which pro
hibits ownership of land, and all other
such laws in other states. The amend
ments being drafted to the "Gentlemen's
Agreement," under which Japan volun
tarily undertook to regulate immigra
tion, are now practically completed.
These amendments are understood to
make the restriction of Japanese immi
gration absolute.
Should the treaty now being drafted
be agreed upon by the Department oi
State, the ratification of the Senate
would be necessary. It would probably
be opposed there.
SACRAMENTO, Nov. B.—A treaty
exempting the Japanese from the land
law discriminating against Asiatics will
not be taken seriously here by the state
department, believes John F. Chambers,
former chairman of the Japanese Ex
clusion League.
"The Japanese have the habit of ask
ing for more than they expect to get,
merely as a basis for negotiations." he
said.
