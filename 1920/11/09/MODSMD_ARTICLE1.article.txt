# CARDINAL SQUAD NOW PREPARING FOR BIG GAME
## Two Leaders in Pacific Coast Conference Football Series Will Meet on November 20 
### 
Tied for first honors in the Pacific
Coast Conference with the University
of California eleven, Stanford's foot
ball men started practice this after
noon on the final lap of the 1920 grid-

iron season. Coacli Powell announced
this morning that the men would be
put through a light practice this aft
ernoon on account of their stiff con
dition resulting from the long trip
from the north.
Western football will culminate on
Saturday, November 20', when the
Cardinal and U. C. teams meet on
the California Field to play off the
classic of the West. Although the of
ficials of the Tournament of Roses
selects what they determine the
strongest eleven of the West which
need not necessarily be a member of
the P. C C., it is highly probable that
the winner of the Coast title will be
the squad to meet the Eastern repre
sentative on New Year's day at Pasa
dena.
It is the concetisus of opinion of a
number of football experts over the
Coast that the eleven to play in the
Fast vs. West contest will be either
Stanford, California, or U. S. C. The
lest named team may be eliminated on
Thanksgiving Day. when they buck up
against the University of Oregon.
Should U. S. C. defeat Oregon, how
ever, they will stand in line for the
selection, provided they can defeat
the winner of the Big Game on No
\em her 20.
The Cardinal players have defeated
the University of Oregon and the
University of Washington, while Cali
fornia has defeated Washington State
and the O. A: C. aggregation. This
elimination leaves the two California
teams at the head of the Conference.
Coach Powell has two weeks' time
to bring his men into the prime of
condition, while the Blue and Gold
players have already reached that
stage. It will be the work of Coach
Andy Smith to keep his men in that
condition ,and to see that they do not
become over-trained and stale. The
Stanford Coach probably has the ad
vantage here because the Cardinal
men have been on the up-hill climb
throughout the season and by the
time of the California-Stanford game
should be at the height of their con
dition.
Only time will tell who have the
best chances in the Big Game struggle.
Beyond a question of doubt, the
Bruins have the edge on Stanford ac
cording to all relative dope and early
season showings. But immediately the
question arises, Will the dope come
true or will it fall down at the last
minute like the rest of the dope on
the Stanford team during the first
part of the season.
