MEXICO CITY, Nov. 9.â€”One hun
dred and fifty-eight lives had been lost
to date in the fight between Socialists
and Liberalists in the State of Yucatan.
The government has 600 troops sta
tioned to quell the fight by the Socialists.
The Socialist fighters, though they
were poorly organized and poorly out
fitted, were said to have rushed to the
attack shouting "Vive la republica
soviet."
Conincidentally with the Socialist
fighting, agitation for a general strike
in Mexico was pressed by the Commun
ists' Society.
Government officials today admitted
that the strike situation has assumed
serious proportions.
Vera Cruz laborers who struck and
were suspended for alleged conspiracy
in the fighting refused an armistice.
