# RUSSIAN PIANIST ID PLAY TONIGHT IN ASSEMBLY HALL
## Benno Moiseiwitsch to Offer Good Program in Peninsula Association Performance 
### 
Presenting a program varying from
old masters to the well-known group
of modern composers, Benno Moisei
witsch, the nated young Russian pianist,
wil lappear in concert in the Assembly
Hall under the auspices of the Peninsula
Musical Association at 8:15 this even
iyg-
Moiseiwitsch is considered one of the
foremost pianists no wappearing on the
concert stage, and has been a favorite
in the European music world ever since
his debut in England' in 1908. He first

appeared in America in New York last
season, and since that time has been
favorably received throughout the
United States. He is noted for his mas
tery of technique, as well as for his
appreciative interpretation of bis pro
grams.
The program which Moiseiwitsch has
chosen for this evening is the one in
which he appeared several weeks ago
in San Francisco, and which he also
played frequently during the Australian
tour from which he has just returned.
The opening number, a prelude by
Bach, is familiar, since the theme is that
later used by Gounod in the "Ave
Maria," with which everyone is ac
quainted. The Carneval Scenes are a
series of short sketches including folk
songs, and it is this Schumann number
which has given Moiseiwitsch the title
of "miniature player." The "Appas
sionata" is perhaps the most famous of
all Beethoven sonatas, while the third
group is representative of later com
posers and includes the more modern
movements. The Liszt-Chopin group,
which completes the program, wjll give
the audience an appreciation of the
young artist's technique, as both Chopin
and Liszt are seldom attempted except
by a master of technique. The pro
gram this evening will be as follows:
Prelude in C Bach
Sonata Appassionata, up. 57
Beethoven
Assai allegro
Andante con moto. Presto.
Carneval Scenes, op 9 Schumann
Prelude in B minor Rachmaninoff
Etude in F sharp Stravinsky
Minuet Valse )
Bird Song ) Palmgren
Refrain de berceu )
Toccata Debussy

Nocturne in E minor ) Chopin
