## 
### 
"A Trip Through Post-War Europe"
was the subject of the talk given hy
Bishop Moreland last night at the Little
Theatre. The occasion of his trip was a
meeting in London of English-speaking
Episcopalian bishops. They gather once
in ten years to consider vital problems
of their work and the possibilities of
developing intranational fraternity.
Three Bishops of old Canterbury pre
side dover the meeting.
While in England, Bishop Moreland
accompanied a member of the House of
Lords to a tea at Buckingham Palace.
King George proved very entertaining,
accordin gto the Bishop. He spoke of
leaving soon for grouse shooting in
Scotland. The Bishop invited him to
come and hunt ducks in California, but
the king said he was "afraid it couldn't
be arranged."
Leaving London at 10:30, the Bishop
and his daughter, traveling in an aero
pla ne,arrived in Paris in time for
luncheon.
From Paris the Bishop made frequent
visits to the battlefields of France. The
peasants are gradually reclaiming the
fields. The government helps them by
supplying agricultural implements, but
much of the ground which they attempt
to work is unpromising.
