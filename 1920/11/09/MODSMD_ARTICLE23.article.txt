# BABES COMMENCE PREPARATION FOR CALIFORNIA GAME
## Coach Seay Giving Freshmen Team Strenuous Practice For Saturday's Contest 
### 
Coach Seay put the freshman foot
ball squad through a heavy workout
Monday night in the first practice
preparatory to the game with the Uni
cersity of California Cubs next Satur
day. All of the men reported in good
condition following their easy game
with Ft. Miley last week and went
through their paces with an unusual
amount of energy.
Signal practice was indulged in fol
lowing which two teams were lined up
and a regular battle took place. Seay
is endeavoring to perfect team play
before the junior big game and is
drilling the first eleven on formation
work.
The line last night was composed of
Slater and Fuller at ends, Hartranft
and Ludeke at tackles, Arthur and
Ong guards, and Dunbar at center.
Woodward worked at quarter, Judy
and Campbell played halves, with Cap
tain Hey in the fullback position.
This is probably the way the team
will lineup when they face the Cali
fornia freshmen. Some changes may
be made as several of the men on the
squad are playing at top speed in an
endeavor to make the team. Sco
field continues to show lots of fire at
right end and Flood is still contest
ing for the job at center.
The backfield problem is practacally
settled. Woodward is regarded as a
cinch to start at quarter. Judy and
Campbell are playing good ball in
the halfback positions and Can. Hey
holds undisputed title ;o the full
back position.
Coach Seay expects the Babes to
fight hard Saturday and is confident
that the score of the game will not
run into such figures as in the game
with the Southern California Babes.
