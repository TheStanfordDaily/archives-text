# SYMPHONY CONCERTS
## 
### 
THROUGH the efforts of the Stanford Orchestra, the Stanford mu
sic clubs and Warren D. Allen, University Organist, Stanford people
will have an opportunity to hear a series of symphony concerts by the
San Francisco Symphony Orchestra, under the direction of Alfred
Hertz. The first concert will be held in the Assembly Hall on Tues
day night, November 30.
The concerts have been arranged primarily for the benefit of the
students, and the organizations that planned the series are to be con
gratulated on their work. Students can show their appreciation by
taking the seats that have been reserved expressly for them.
