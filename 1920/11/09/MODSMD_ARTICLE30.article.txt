## 
### 
lhe fourth annual enrollment of
members for the Red Cross will be
opened in San Francisco next week
with the most complete organization
ever effected for a similar campaign. It
is likely that a drive for funds for the
national organization will be started
on the campus later. The call is sched
uled for November 14 to November 17,
during which time every effort will be
made to fill the allotted quotas. The
San Francisco quota has been placed at
