# EUPHRONIA TO PICK TEAM FOR CONTEST AGAINST CALIFORNIA
## 
### 
Members of the team to debate
against the Congress Debating Society
of California on December 4 will be
chosen from among those trying out at
the meeting of Euphronia to be held
tomorrow evening at the usual time and
place. Every member of Euphronia will
probably enter the contest, so the final
selection should reveal some material,
which, when polished up by four weeks'
preparation, should be able to show
enough skill to triumph over the Blue
and Gold entry in the coming battle.
The subject which the tryoutees will
talk on tomorrow night will be, 'Re
solved. that, the United States should
recognize the Soviet government of
Russia." This topic has been prac
tically agreed upon as the one to be
used on December 4. according to a
statement given out by G. W. Burch,
president of Euphronia, and is evidently
one upon which a lively debate can be
held.
The probable outcome of the contest
can not be safely predicted, as both so
cieties have very able artists in the line
of argument, and until the definite
members of each team are announced
forecasts will be useless. However, a
casual resume would seem to indicate
that the Cardinal team will have the
edge, as in last year's intercollegiate
inter-society debate the Stanford society
was the winner, and prominent debaters
transferred from other universities
have joined the Stanford fold and
strengthened it considerably.
