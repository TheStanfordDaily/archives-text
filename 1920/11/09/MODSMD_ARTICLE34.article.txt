Twinkle, twinkle cauliflower,
You are not and yet you are
The cabbage you're supposed to be—
So cauliflower to pin on me.

B. L. T.'s colyum furnishes us the
information that a man loaded to the
gunnels with bombs was found near
the University of Chicago grounds.
He admitted that he was attempting
to blow up the university and offered
as an explanation for his motives the
fact that there were so many profi
teers there. The poor man had been
reading about Prof. Brown, Prof.
Smith, and Prof. Jones and had jump

Ode to a Writer of a Humorous
Column
Ready wit and sparkling humor,
Jokes from writer to consumer;
Printers' breaks and foolish captions,
.Deviltry in queer contraptions—
Such as names with double meanings,
Magazine and paper gleanings,
Clipping what some verdant farmer
Donning literary armor
Wrote about Si Perkins' Chickens;
(Hicks are funny as the dickens!)
Efforts too in verse with freedom
(Kill such writers, we don't need 'em);
Quips about Papa and Willie,
Jests profound and others silly;
Awful puns (I like 'em, damme!),
Trite remarks quite epigrammy;
Little slams at politicians,
Hitting Plebs and eke Patricians;
Satire on a timely topic,
'Squibs with humor microscopic.
Hail to thee, blithe column writer,
Whimsical, amusing blighter;
Hearty Jaughter ad absurdum—•
Things' like your's, I've never heard
'em! —Harvard Lampoon.
