BERLIN, Oct. 20. —Factories which
formerly made the stuff to deal death
on the west front are now turning out
wondrous artificial silk to adorn wo
mankind and mankind.
The artificial silk industry, already
underway before the war, has been
greatly augmented and is now in a po
sition to establish a considerable com
petition not alone with the real silk
industry but with the artificial silk
factories of other lands.
German experts are striving now to
overcome drawbacks attendant upon
the artificial brand, or "Kunstseide,"
as they call it. Dampness has a de
teriorating effect but research work
shows that this disadvantage will soon
be disposed of.
American buyers are manifesting a
strong interest in the new business
and declare that there is a great de
mand for this product.
Herr Geheimrat Hagemann, chief
of the artificial silk branch of the gov
ernment's economic ministry, told the
United Press:
"This silk was made in Germany
even before the war in considerable
quantities. But the demand for it has
increased since the war, since the
spirit of all peoples since the war and
revolutianary period is for a better
life and this is expressed in one way
through the universally prevalent de
sire of the woman's world for gay
colors.
"In addition to the old silk factories
of pre-war times, there are now a
number of former explosive factories
engaged in producing the artificial
product. This is explained by the
fact, that both explosives and arti
ficial silk are derived from cellulose.
Among others, the big explosive fac
tories in Koeln-Rottfeil are being con
verted into silk factories, while the
explosive factory at Zehlendorf, near
here, along with numerous others are
engaged in the same occupation.
•'This industry is especially import
ant for Germany because we do not
need to import the raw material there
for. And, despite the fact that in
recent veeks the industry has been
limited by coal shortage, the nation
is producing a considerable quantity
of the raw silk as well as finished
products like neckties, ribbonsf cords
and so on. We feel that, we are es
pecially in a position to meet compe
tition since we know about dyeing,
and the goods have proven durable
and of manifold variety."
Geheimrat indicated his belief that
the prewar demand for German
"madearticles" would spring up again,
< specially since Germany was in a
position to delived them on the world
market at low prices.
Recently American experts have
been looking over the field, and it
is believed that they are either pre
paring to buy large quantities of the
German product or else to attempt
to acquire German silk factories.
