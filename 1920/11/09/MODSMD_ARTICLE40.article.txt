# RED CROSS TO SPEND VAST SUM IN WAR DEVASTATED EUROPE
## 
### United Press 
PARIS, Nov. 9. —Two years after
armistice, the American Red Cross
today is still Big-Brothering eighteen
war-stricken European nations, help
ing to clean up the human refuse of
the war.
Over a thousand American nurses,
directors and relief workers wearing
Red Cross insignia are scattered
throughout Europe ministering, in
many cases, to the same people
against whom they were fighting in
1918. It is estimated that around 400,-
000 received help last month in
Austro-Hungary and Poland alone.
At the general headquarters in
Paris, the organization holds itself
ready to answer a call for help from
every part of Europe. When thou
sands were rendered homeless by the
earthquake in Italy, the American Red
Cress rushed quantities of provisions
and corps of skilled doctors to the
devastated Carrera district. When
General Denikin's offensive collapsed
in South Russia and some two mil
lion refugees crowded into Crimea,
the Red Cross saw to it that they did
not starve.
In devastated France one and a half
million francs worth of provisions
were distributed free this last year.
An equal amount was handed over to
needy in Eastern and Central Eu
rope.

In fact, all Europe has formed the
habit of looking toward the Amer
ican relief organization to direct "first
aid" measures, no matter where the
catastrophe or suffering may be.
Thanks to it and the Hoover Relief
Commission, America has gained the
reputation of the world's great al
truist and philanthropist.
With a 1921 appropriation of $20,-
000,000 already assured for next year's
work here, Red Cross chiefs are plan
ning to concentrate on child welfare
throughout the continent, thus help
ing to stave off the ill effects of war
—physical and mental—upon the com
ing generation.
The Red Cross plans to put 150
trained units in the field to look after
the physical welfare of the 2,000,000
children whom the American Relief
Association is feeding. Up to the
present the Red Cross has been able
to go into this work on a limited scale
only.
