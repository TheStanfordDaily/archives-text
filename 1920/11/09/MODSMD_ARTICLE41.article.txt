# LONDON LORD MAYOR IS ROYALLY INSTALLED

### United Press 
LONDON, Nov. 9. —With centuries
old civic pomp and pageantry Alder
man James Roll was today inaugu
rated Lard Mayor of London for the
ensuing year. The picturesque "Lord
Mayor's Show" —a two-mile procession
which annually dislocated traffic in
the heart of the most congested dist
ricts of the City of Londan —attracted
the usual masses of sightseers, al
though it is the customary thing for
Londoners to shug their shoulders and
profess to regard it as a tiresime
anachronism, "not worth goint to see,
my boy." However, no Lord Mayor
has yet been bold enough to cut out
this expensive pageant, and it is cer
tain that all true Cockneys would pro
test loudly if the ancient ritual was
dropped.
Lord Mayor Roll is an insurance
company magnate, having been man
aging director of the Pearl Insurance
Company, with which concern he has
been connected for fifty years. The
son of a Norfolk farmer, he came to
London as a boy of fourteen, and —as
he puts it himself —"By hard work
and a little luck" he worked himself
up from the humplest position. He
is a typical Englishman and of the
Dickensian style, rather like the late
King Edward in manners and appear
ance. He is passionately fond of
horses and coaching, and despite his
72 years is still a famous whip.
The office of Lord Mayor is no sine
cure. Nor ts it a profitable one, for
although there is a salary of ten
thousand pounds for the year, the oc
cupant of the Mansion House gener
ally has to spend four or five times
that amount as official "Host" for the
City of London.
