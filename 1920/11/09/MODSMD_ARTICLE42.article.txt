### United Press 
LONDON, Nov. 9. —Fifty-one na
tionß, large nad small, and inhabited
by peoples of every race, color and
creed, will be represented at the first
League of Nations Assembly at
Geneva, November 15th.
Chinese, Japanese and Arabs will
rub elbows with Britoiiß, Latins and
Celts. Frenc hand English will be
the medium of language through
which business will be transacted, kl
though many of the delegates will
onderstand neither tongue.
Of the nations reprsented at Geneva,
eighten, including the five dominions
of the British Group, became mem
bers of the League automatically
through the coming into effect of the
Treaty of Versailles on January 10th,
1920.
Eight other countries ratified the
Pact subsequently and are considered
as character members. Thirteen
states, neutrals during the Great War,
are members through accession under
invitations extended in conformity
with the Annext to the Covenant.
China, alone, drives her membership
rights by virtue of being a signatory
to the Treaty at St. Germain.
Eleven other countries, some of
which have only de facto governments,
have officially applied for member
ship. Their applications will be acted
upon at the Assembly meeting, as will
be those of Germany, Austria, Hun
gary and Bulgaria, if they are received
officially before the date of the meet
ing.
The only nations which will not be
represented at Gneva, either officially
or semi-officially, are the United
States, Turkey and Mexico.
