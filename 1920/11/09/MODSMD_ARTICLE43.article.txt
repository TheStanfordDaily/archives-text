All other expenditures 1,566.78
Total $74,261.80
In connection with the $2,736 excess
of expenditures over receipts noted,
Professor Mitchell calls attention to
the fact that the Board voted an aggre
gate of $1,627.86 for sending track
teams to the 1. C. A.. A. A. A. and to
the Olympic tryouts, although it was
known at the time this was done last
spring that the estimated receipts did
not provide for these expenditures. He
also points out that permanent im
provements totaling $14,354.05 were
made during the year which might have
been considered in part at least as assets,
thus eliminating this deficit. It was
however, to charge these improvements
to current revenue rather than to load
the assets with items which have no cash
value. These permanent improvements
are noted in the tabulation of expendi
tures, including those to the gymnasium,
the portable bleaches, the tennis courts,
and the well and pump which now fur
nish the men's swimming pool with its
own water supply.
In the $4,706.96 expended on athletic
fields arc included the $1,111.48 spent to
prepare the football bleachers for the
game with the University of California,
and part of this was spent for long
benches across the open end of the
field which increased the seating ca
pacity by several hundred and thus
added to the revenue derived from that
game. v
The $4j989.11 noted in the expendi
tures column as "payment on loan" is
the annual payment on $15,000 borrowed
from the University Board of Trustees
by the Hoard of Athletic Control when
it came into existence three years ago
to meet the debt which athletics under
student management had acquired at
that time. The students obligated them
selves to pay off the principal and inter
est on this loan by a fee of $1 a quarter
per stndent. This loan has now been
reduced to a balance of $6,341.09.

prepare the football bleachers for the
game with the University of California,
and part of this was spent for long
benches across the open end of the
field which increased the seating ca
pacity by several hundred and thus
added to the revenue derived from that
game. v
The $4j989.11 noted in the expendi
tures column as "payment on loan" is
the annual payment on $15,000 borrowed
from the University Board of Trustees
by the Hoard of Athletic Control when
it came into existence three years ago
to meet the debt which athletics under
student management had acquired at
that time. The students obligated them
selves to pay off the principal and inter
est on this loan by a fee of $1 a quarter
per stndent. This loan has now been
reduced to a balance of $6,341.09.

Professor Mitchell calls attention to
the fact that the Board voted an aggre

spring that the estimated receipts did
not provide for these expenditures. He

provements totaling $14,354.05 were
made during the year which might have
