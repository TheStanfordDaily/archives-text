# LIBRARIAN WRITES OF THREE VALUABLE BOOK COLLECTIONS
## 
### 
A letter received from George T.
Clark, librarian of the university, tells
of three valuable special collections for
the Library aggregating 5,100 volumes
which he has purchased in the French
capital. Mr. Clark has just completed
a world tour purchasing books for the
Stanford Library. Since writing this
letter he has returned to the United
States, but will not reach the campus
for several weeks.
lii this letter from Paris he tells t>f
several purchases of sets of the pro
ceedings of scientific societies made in
Switzerland and Italy which were
needed to complete the Stanford collec
tions, and writes that in Paris, in addi
tion to the three private library pur
chases mentioned, he had acquired some
1 100 volumes on the Library's "want
list" which he had with him. Of the
three private libraries which he espe
cially mentions he writes as follows:
"The Cluzon library, comprising
3,000 volumes in Latin and the Romanic
languages. The collection evidently had
passed from father to son and been in
process of growth for a hundred years
or more.
"The library of a well-known pro
fessor of political science who does not
wish his name known, including 1,000
volumes on history, political science and
travel, and 500 pamphlets.
"The Edouard Grimaux library pf
chemistry, numbering 1,100 volumes. It
contains some valuable files of journals
and an excellent collection of seven
teenth and eighteenth century works
that will be a desirable addition to our
material on the history of chemistry.
Edouard Grimaux died in 1900 and the
library was purchased from his son,
Georges Grimaux.'
Mr. Clark writes: "I have been able
to obtain here also a good many jour
nals needed to complete the French sets
of the Lane Medical Library, and am
leaving a copy of their "want list" with
Lefrancois, who makes a specialty of
medical works, and who promises to
supply more of the desiderata in the
near future."
