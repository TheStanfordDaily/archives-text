# BULKLEY TO MANAGE DRAMATICS FOR YEAR
## 
### 
Milton Bulkley, '19, was elected to
the position of Business Manager for
dramatic productions at a meeting of
the Dramatic Council yesterday. Mil
ton Bulkley replaces Momer Mitehel,
who was elected at the last meeting
of the Council for that purpose, but
who later resigned from the position.
Bulkley was made Business Manager
temporarily to take over the business
of the Sword and Sandals play. Here
he made good and picked up the loose
threads, showing the Council that he
was well capable of handling the job
permanently. Bulkley also showed
his ability in the way he managed the
Senior Farce last spring quarter.
