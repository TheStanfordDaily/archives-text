# Assembly Hail Stage Undergoes Renovation
## 
### 
According to the Dramatic Council,
the Assembly Hall stage and its equip
ment is about due to undergo a system
of renovating and refitting. There are
many things lacking that the Council
hopes to furnish in the near future,
such as picture frames, lights, scenery,
and the like. The basement, which has
hitherto been the dumping ground for
any excess properties or scenery, is to
be at last put in order and a property
room established where useful property
is expected to be kept for the use of
future plays. This room is to be under
the supervision of the Business Man
