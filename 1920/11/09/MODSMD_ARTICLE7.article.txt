# NEW STUDENTS ARE CONDUCTED THROUGH MEMORIAL CHURCH
## 
### 
All new students were conducted
through Memorial Church yesterday by
Dr. D. Charles Gardner, who explained
the founding of the church, the purpose
which it serves and the meaning of the
various pictures and inscriptions.
The tour started in the gallery at the
front of the building, where the most
comprehensive view of the beautiful
interior may be had. Here Dr. Gardner
gave a short talk in which he explained
the church from both the spiritual and
physical viewpoints, the ideals from
which it had its conception, the purpose
of the church and its non-sectarian or
der. It was in connection with the
latter that Dr. Gardner touched on the
possibility of unity in religion, which
is illustrated by the fact that although
people of all creeds attend the church
its platform is so broad and innoffensive
that not a cross word nor a complaint
of any sort has been heard since its
founding. It was through this neces
sary broadness. Dr. Gardner mentioned,
that difficulty is found in perfecting a
unity and cohesion comparable to sec
tarian institutions. This has, however,
been accomplished.
The visitors were then conducted
around the building and the mosaics
and pictures on the windows explained,
together with the method of construc
tion which has built one of the most
beautiful churches in America.
