# STANFORD MAY HAVE NEW PAVILION FOR BASKETBALL AND GYMNASIUM CLASSES
## Student Assessment for Payment of Interest Will Guarantee Erection of Building 
### (By W. F. Leiser, '21 
Stanford may have a new $75,000
basketball pavilion, large enough to
accommodate an audience of 3,000
people, and with a spring floor greater
in size than the entire site of the
present Encina drill rooms. The
building, if erected, will provide a
dance floor modeled after that of the
St. Francis Motel, and including auxili
aries such as kitchen and cloak rooms
to properly take care of the greater
campus formals such as the Prom and
the Senior Ball.
Stanford may have a new pavilion,
if the Student Body sees fit to take
action that will induce the Board of
Trustees to advance the principal of
$75,000. The facts of the proposal
which grew out of a recent meeting
of the board are as follows.
A provision was made last year to
erect a $15,000 temporary wooden
structure for basketball. But this was
contrary to (he Trustees' decree that
no more temporary structures may be
built on the campus, as they are now
having too much trouble removing
buildings of that type.
When the necessity of a new build
ing became evident again this year,
the Board could see no way of provid
ing for it. Now it is found that a prin
cipal of $75,000 could be taken from
University funds now out at interest,
if any way could be found to pay the
interest and return the principal. The
Board of Control decided that it
could advance $7,500 each year to
ward Uie payment of the debt. Dr.
Wilbur who was at the last board
meeting then stated that he would
give $2,500 each year from his budget,
providing the Comptroller Roth could
advance the same amount, to which
the Comptroller agreed.
This then guaranteed a sum of $12,-
500 to pay on the principal each year.
The student members of the Board

suggested that the students might find
a way to provide the interest. In fact
it was the suggestion that the stu
dents might be willing to help that
prompted Dr. Wilbur to make his offer.
The proposition in its present sta
tus now provides that money will be
advanced and work begun on the pa
vilion, and $12,500 will be set aside
for the payment of the incumbent
debt each year, if the students find a
way to pay the interest until the debt
is removed.
The method considered favorably
by the Executive Committee of the
Associated Students, last night, in
cludes an assessment of $1.00 per
fudent per quarter, to be added to
the regular registration fee, until the
debt is paid, presumably for slightly
longer than four years. A student
body assembly will be held Wednes
day at 9 a.m., to discuss the proposi
tion, and on the same day from 11
until 2 the committee has arranged
to take an all-student body vote on
whether the assessment shall be add
ed to the registration fee or not.
The Board of Control considered the
pavilion favorably because it believes
the building a permanent investment
which guarantees, a permanent in
come, and also because it will give
adequate facilities for conducting of
gymnasium classes and basketball
tournaments. The present gymnasi
um is considered inadequate because
it is too small, and because the floor
is so constructed as to be seriously
detrimental to the men who play up
on it.
Plans for a new football stadium
were also considered at the Board
meeting. Dr. Wilbur indicated that
a stadium must be built in the near
future, and that it could not or should
not be built by appealing to the stu
dents for money.
