# VARSITY ELEVEN COMMENCES HARD WORKOUTS TODAY
## Four of Coach Powell's Live Players Are on Injured List For Next Few Days 
### 
Four varsity first-string linesmen arc
now on the injured list. Pelouze,
Adams, DeGroot and Deems were un
able to report to practice last night be
cause of minor injuries received in the
Washington game last Saturday. Their
absence in the line was hardly noticed
last night, since the coach allowed most
of the regular eleven to rest, giving his
reserve force a chance for scrimmage
against the freshman team. These four
players will probably be out for work
within the next few days.
"Dink" Templeton is spending most
of his practice time in the use of his
talented toe. Templeton was responsible
for the first score against California
last season, and hopes to he accountable
lor another this year. Stanfoid's siai
kicker is lengthening the distance of his
punts and drops with every additional
practice. Patrick is also working ou'
with Templeton, in case that Patrick
should be called 011 to do the Cardinal
punting. Pelouze can be relied upon as
a utility drop kicker. He can easily
drop the ball over from the 25-yard
line.
Heavy practice started this aiiernoon,
according to the plans of Coach Powell
ibis morning. Lights are being .in
stalled on the football field in ordei
that the men will be able to stay out on
the field until their practice is over with
out the handicap of darkness. The foot
ball men are now eating al the training
table, which is being held ai the C!ii Psi
house. According to Conference rules
the football men arc not allowed to ail
live under the same roof, nor can ihey
have more than the evening meal to
gether. The P. C. C.is endeavoring to
do away with training quarrers, but
allows the evening meal because of the
inconvenience of eating after a late
practice.
