# CARDINAL RUGBY TEAM DEFEATS LOWELL HIGH
## 
### 
Stanford scored its second rugby
victory of the season, yesterday,
tgainst the Lowell High School squad,
on the Stanford rugby held, by a score
of 9 to 0. The Cardinal fifteen was
somewhat weakened by the absence
of Rogers and Young from the lineup,
but the condition of the team showed
improvement over that displayed In
the game against Modesto High last
Saturday.
The game yesterday was marked
by frequent off-sides and forward
somewhat. Lynn scored the first
passes, which slowed the game up
touchdown within the first few min
utes of play and the lialf ended 3-0
in favor of Stanford. Touchdowns
by Coplen and Lynn in the second
half brought the score up to 9 to 0,
all three attempts at conversion fail
ing.
Thursday the rugby squad plays the
fifteen from Polytechnic High at Stan
ford, and Saturday the Cardinal team
will go to Modesto for a return game
with the San Joaquin Valley cham
pions.
