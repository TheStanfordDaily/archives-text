# SEAY ANNOUNCES PROBABLE BACKS FOR U. C. GAME
## Woodward, Hey, Campbell, and Judy Figured to Start Against Bears on Saturday 
### 
With the Freshman backfield question
practically settled, Coach Duffy Seay is
concentrating most of his attention on
the line this week. There are one or
two minor weaknesses among the for
wards that must he corrected before the
Babes will be ready to play the Bruin
Cubs 011 the local field next Saturday
afternoon.
Dunbar has entirely recovered from
several small sprains and charley-horses
that have heliT him back during the past
two weeks and is going at a pace that
marks him as a certainty to start the
game. Flood, the other candidate for
the center job, is pressing Dunbar hard,
and though he probably will not start,
it is practically certain that he will get
into the game.
Slater, who has been playing left end
consistently throughout the season, will
play the position in the junior big game.
Right end is still open, with Fuller and
Scoiield battling for the job. Fuller is
the choice to start the game, but Scoiield
will plav part of the game in this posi
tion.
Hartranft and Ludeke have the tackle
positions practically hands down. Both
have been playing good steady ball in
the positions and are big fast men.
Arthur will start the game at right
guard. He has been regarded as a fix
ture in this position since the start of
the season. Ong and Fullerton are both
trying to land the other guard job. Ong
seems to have a slight edge right now
because of his previous experience in
American football. Dick Fullerton'was
a member of the Lowell High Rugby
team last year and this is his lirst \\;ork
in the American game. Consequently
he is handicapped to some exen't. but
as he is rapidly learning the other style
pt football he is expected to break into
the game.
The backfield will line up in the same
way that it has all during the season.
"Bud" Woodward will play the quarter
back position. Woodward is a fiery fel
low and keeps the men 011 their toes all
the time. He is well versed in football
tactics and has shown himself to be
capable in calling plays. Captain Hey
will do most of the kicking from the
fullback position. Hey is a husky young
man with quite a football reputation in
the Middle West. His work in the pre
liminary games played thus far have
sustained bis previous records. Camp
bell and Judy have been working well
in the last two games played and are
sure to go big in the game with Cali
fornia. Both are line plungers of some
ability and are good defensive men as
well. ,
Coach Seay will not announce the
lineup to start the game until later in
the week. He admits that the backtield
will be practically intact from the last
game, but refuses to divulge the identity
of the men who will compose the line.

trying to land the other guard job. Ong
seems to have a slight edge right now
because of his previous experience in
American football. Dick Fullerton'was
a member of the Lowell High Rugby
team last year and this is his lirst \\;ork
in the American game. Consequently
he is handicapped to some exen't. but
as he is rapidly learning the other style
pt football he is expected to break into
the game.
The backfield will line up in the same
way that it has all during the season.
"Bud" Woodward will play the quarter
back position. Woodward is a fiery fel
low and keeps the men 011 their toes all
the time. He is well versed in football
tactics and has shown himself to be
capable in calling plays. Captain Hey
will do most of the kicking from the
fullback position. Hey is a husky young
man with quite a football reputation in
the Middle West. His work in the pre
liminary games played thus far have
sustained bis previous records. Camp
bell and Judy have been working well
in the last two games played and are
sure to go big in the game with Cali
fornia. Both are line plungers of some
ability and are good defensive men as
well. ,
Coach Seay will not announce the
lineup to start the game until later in
the week. He admits that the backtield
will be practically intact from the last
game, but refuses to divulge the identity
of the men who will compose the line.
With the Freshman backfield question
practically settled, Coach Duffy Seay is
concentrating most of his attention on
the line this week. There are one or
two minor weaknesses among the for
wards that must he corrected before the
Babes will be ready to play the Bruin
Cubs 011 the local field next Saturday
afternoon.
Dunbar has entirely recovered from
several small sprains and charley-horses
that have heliT him back during the past
two weeks and is going at a pace that
marks him as a certainty to start the
game. Flood, the other candidate for
the center job, is pressing Dunbar hard,
and though he probably will not start,
it is practically certain that he will get
into the game.
Slater, who has been playing left end
consistently throughout the season, will
play the position in the junior big game.
Right end is still open, with Fuller and
Scoiield battling for the job. Fuller is
the choice to start the game, but Scoiield
will plav part of the game in this posi
tion.
Hartranft and Ludeke have the tackle
positions practically hands down. Both
have been playing good steady ball in
the positions and are big fast men.
Arthur will start the game at right
guard. He has been regarded as a fix
ture in this position since the start of
the season. Ong and Fullerton are both
trying to land the other guard job. Ong
