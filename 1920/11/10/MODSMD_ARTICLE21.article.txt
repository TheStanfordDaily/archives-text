# RUSSIAN PIANIST DELIGHTS WITH MUSIC PROGRAM
## Benno Moiseiwitsch Proves Master of lechnique In Presentation of Concert 
### (By Mary Jane Clark, '22 
In a fortunately selected program
affording opportunity for wide range
of interpretation and a display of
technical mastery, Benno Moisei
witsch, the noted Russian pianist,
played to a large audience in (he As
sembly Hall last Â«yening.
Possessed of a certain refinement
and restraint, which was never lost,
even in the difficult technique of the
more substantial numbers, Moisei
witsch suggested a personality capable
of penetrating and expressing all
types of composition from the intense
ly profound to the most whimsical
and poetic of the lighter selections
and a truly artistic appreciation of
both old and new masters. Even in
the most over-powering moments his
expression only increased the emo
tional intensity of his work. His play
ing never became the more rendering
of sound but had always suggestion
of artistic insight, which was never
incidental to the requirements of
technique.
The opening number, Bach's "Pre
lude in C," was filled with clear pene
trating tones which from the first
characterized Moiseiwltsch's playing.
Beethoven's "Sonata Appassionata,"
was not quite so appreciatively re
ceived, although it formed an intro
duction to the technical powers of the
artist. Popular interest was centered
in the "Carneval Scenes" of Schumann,
in Chopin's "Waltz in G flat major"
and in Palmgren's "Bird Song." This
latter selection, one of the modern
group, 'being especially fine in light
delicate touches and filled with imagi
native suggestion.
The Schumann number, a series of
short colorful scenes, and interpreted
only as it would have been by one
who understands the spirit of Schu
mann music, Moiseiwitsch's exhibition
of technique was especially notable
in the etudes, which also possessed
interest in variety and arrangement of
theme. All of the Chopin numbers
were gratifyingly interpreted, the
"Waltz in G flat major" in particular
being played witli a delicacy of ex
pression and pleasing lightness of
touch.
