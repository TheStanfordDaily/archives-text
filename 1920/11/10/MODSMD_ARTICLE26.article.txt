# THE
						BASKETBALL PAVILION
## 
### 
STUDENTS will show by their vote on the basketball pavilion project
next week whether they are back of Stanford athletics strongly
enough to dig down in their pockets for the necessary money to put the
project across. The pavilion is to be built largely by money paid by
the members of the student body, and it is up to each individual stu
dent to decide whether he can afford and is willing to do his part in
paying for the building.
A permanent building which will seat 3,000 .people will be a val
uable addition to the University and will be a source of revenue for the
Board of Athletic Control. The Trustees have refused to allow a tem
porary structure to be built for the use of the basketball team, and real
izing the importance of having a floor for basketball, the Trustees will
loan the students the money to build a permanent structure for the
use of basketball and other gymnasium teams. Dances can also be held
in the proposed building.
The method of payment, which is explained in the news columns
today, does not place a heavy burden 011 the students. Three dollars
a year will be paid by each member of the student body for a short
period. President Wilbur has shown his willingness to aid the project
by his offer to cut his personal budget $2,500 a year to help pay for the
building, and Comptroller Roth has consented to give a like sum. With
the administration favoring the construction of the building and back
ing it financially, both through the Board of Trustees and through sums
taken from personal budgets, the project is certainly worthy of student
support.
For a long time it has been apparent that Stanford has needed
a regulation basketball floor 011 which to train the teams. The present
floor in Encina gymnasium is built 011 a concrete foundation, and lie
cause of this fact many of the players receive injuries during the season
that bar them from play, or prevent them from taking part in other
forms of athletics, such as track. A championship basketball team was
produced last year under difficulties, and if the same caliber teams are
to be turned out, the squad must have adequate floor accommodations.
The present building is too small to handle crowds for the games,
and is also inadequate to handle the intramural basketball teams.
The need for the structure is apparent, and its erection depends
on the approval of the students as manifested at the polls. In order to
secure the loan from the Board of Trustees, the majority in favor of
the measure must be large.
Get out and support the project with your vote.
