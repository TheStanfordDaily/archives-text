## 
### 
\ S the day of the Big Game draws nearer and the demand for seats be
comes greater there is a temptation for students to enter the ticket
scalping field and offer their seats for sale at a premium. Very little
of this happened last year, but rumors are already current that seats
have been offered and purchased at high prices this early in the season.
Those students who are thinking of venturing into this game
should bear in mind the warning that is printed on the back of the seat
application blanks against ticket scalping. They will be blacklisted
from all future games as far as the Board of Athletic Control is con
cerned. and the Men's Council will take action in the matter also.
The results of ticket scalping in the recent World's Series arc well
known, causing the arrest of one of the players.
Aside from the fact that punishment awaits those who attempt to
profiteer on their seats, the names of Stanford students must not be
dragged before the public as "ticket scalpers." Such occurrences cast
a stigma on the name of the University, and must be avoided.
