# THREE THOUSAND BIG GAME TICKETS MAILED TO STANFORD ALUMNI
## 
### 
Alumni tickets for the Big Game were
mailed out from the Alumni Secretary's
office today in accordance with an agree
ment with the University of California
that lists of applications from alumni
should be completed in both institutions
on November 9 and the tickets out
the following day.
The total number of tickets ordered
through the Alumni Office amounted to
2987. Many of the applications were re
ceived from distant points, including 10
from Seattle, 12 from Portland and 8
from Oklahoma. This is the first year
that application blanks have been sent
to alumni and is also the first time the
sale oi tickets has been handled through
the Alumni Secretary, the Graduate
Manager having taken charge of the
sale formerly.
As a result of this system the num
ber of sales of alumni tickets has greatly
increased this year, according to the
Secretary's report, and it has also as
sisted in the wok of collecting ecords
of addresses for the alumni directory
now being compiled. Cards for new ad
dresses were sent out in April and
May, but some of them obtained in this
way have since been changed, and the
issue of ticket application blanks has
brought in a number of new addresses,
bringing the records up to date. As
another result of the system, from two
to three, hundred ex-students whose
correct addresses were previously un
known have been located. The payment
(if iilumni dues has also been stimulated
by this system.
Many personal letters expressing ap
preciation of the arrangement have been
received both from ex-students and
alumni, especially those living at distant
points.
