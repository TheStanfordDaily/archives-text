# TROJANS CONDEMN ACTION OF THEIR FRESHMAN ELEVEN
## 
### 
To "THE DAILY PALO ALTO":â€”
The University of Southern Cali
fornia has long held Leland Stanford
in high esteem, and friendly relations
have existed between the two for a
number of years. A friendship of this
kind, particularly between Colleges of
the West, where all must stand to
gether for greater recognition in the
past, is a thing to be treasured and
cherished. After receiving numerous
reports concerning the foolish actions
of the Freshman Footbal lteam, while
the guests of a Palo Alto hotel, and
believing Stanford to be our friend
when she referred to that ungentle
manly conduct in the columns of the
Daily Palo Alto, the Southern Cali
fornia Trojan, wishes to apologize for
the actions of that team.
The Trojan has delayed in sending
this ap logy In order that the real
facts in the matter might be thorough
ly investigated, and a proper authori
zation obtained from the faculty, that
al ldamages resulting from the child
ish antics of our Freshman should be
fully mot by the University of South
ern California.
It is to be sincerely regretted that
any such trouble should have occurred,
and though we do not wish to shift
the blame because the men were first
year students, yet we honestly believe,
that the vanity would never have al
lowed the honor of the University to
be so poorly safeguarded. We leave
the matter in Stanford's hands, feel
ing that they will do what is right
and just, and will not allow the friend
ship of the two Universities to be in
any way afTected by the actions of
a few over-grown children, who do not
seem to have been under any definite
authority.
UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN
CALIFORNIA TROJAN,
Charles W. Paddock, Editor.
