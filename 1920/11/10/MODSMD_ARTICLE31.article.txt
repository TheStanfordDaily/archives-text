An example of gold in brick-form is
the attempt to underrate the Stan
ford varsity by several Coast news
papers. "Brick" Morse of S. F. is an
old offender at this game and now we
have the Seattle "Times," which
chronicled the game last Saturday as
—"Dink" Templeton 3, U. of Washing
ton 0. Will they ever learn?

WELL, WE RAN THIS, ANYWAY
Little Mr. Rotten Hunch,
Has come to our house to stay,
To occupy our time and mind,
And chase our thoughts away.
We try to write a little rhyme,
Rut none of them work out,
Oh, the Cabbage Colyum gets you,
If you don't watch out.

PAGE THE PURITY SQUAD
The moral standards of our con
tribs. are doing a hook-slide for the
worse just at present. The other day
one of them clipped the following
"classified" from the Daily and got
a lot of unholy joy out of adding the
comment that the attractiveness of
the offer was simply a matter of
gender, which the frenzied ad-writer
forgot to mention:
WANTED—A ROOM-MATE for small
apartment at (he Kingscote, Cam
pus. An unusually attractive place
to stay at a surprisingly attractive
price. Apply at once to Rox 954,
or Apt. 13.

The most popular man on the cam
pus just now is the man in charge
of the Big Game ticket sale. Yester
day he received an offer through the
mails of two bottles of bonded whis
key for two Big Game tickets.

And then we got another one today,
wrapped up in trick-feminine station
ery. It goes like this —hold on! The
boss is looking over our shoulder and
says we can't run it. He wants to
avoid any postoffic opposition in
sending the "Daily" through the mails.
