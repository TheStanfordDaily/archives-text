# FRENCH PEOPLE WORK MIRACLES IN READJUSTMENT

PARIS, Nov. 10. —Within two years
after the signing of the armistice,
France has worked two veritable
miracles —one of re-adjustment nad
one of reconstruction.
As a result of this miracle of re
adjustment, although France was the
one allied country that suffered most
from the war, and the one country
in which the increase in the cost of
living was the greatest, she is the
only one of the big Allied powers, who
today is entirely free from any strikes
or social unrest of an economic na
ture.
Furthermore, she is the only one
of the big Allied powers who in the
same period of time has been able to
free heiself l'ujly and definitely from
the menace of Bolshevism. The death
knell of the latter was sounded a
month ago when in national conven
tion at Orleans the French Fenera
tion of Labor almost unanimously con
demned the leaders who up until eight
months ago ordered and supported
political strikes amongst the French
workingmen.
Instead of waiting, as much of the
rest of the world has done, for econ
omic life to re-establish itself on the
pre-war basis, France saw at once that
this would never happen and immedi
ately readjusted herself to the new
economic life imposed by the war.
The official statistics of the Allied
countries place the increase in the
cost of living in France as a result
of the war at 300 per cent.
Yet, despite this astounding handi
cap, official figures of the French
Ministry of Public Instruction, show
that salaries generally throughout
France have now been increased from
200 to 300 per cent.
It is this quick readjustment of the
whole economic basis of French life
to the new standard of living created
by the war, that has left France en
tirely free from industrial strikes for
the past nine months and has wiped
out completely the menace of Bolshe
vism.
All France is hard at work today on
a fairly contented basis to repair the
havoc and damages wrought by the
war.
Like all other Allied nations in
Europe, one of the greatest damages
to France from the war was the in
crease of her importations and the
decrease in her exportations result
ing in the frightful decrease in the
value of French money in foreign
countries.
Yet the most astounding progress is
being made to remedy this by in
crease in French production and conse
quently increased exportation and de
creased importation.
During the first seven months of
1919 France exporter only 4,766,402,-
000 francs worth of merchandise and

produce. For the first seven months
of 1920, these exportations were in
creased to 12,006,630,000 francs, a
gain of over 7,000,000i,000 francs.
France's total importations for 1919
were 29,778,000,000 francs against
only 8,713,000',000 francs of exporta
tions.
For all of 1920 it is estimated that
her importations will only be 37,304,-
000,000 francs and her exportations
20,582,000,000, showing a steady pro
gress towards the re-establisliment of
equal importations and exportations
necessary to overcome the present
ruinous rate of French exchange.
As regards commercial relations
with the United States France's im
portations for July from America
which totaled $58,961, 554 were re
duced for the month of August to
$38,321,950, showing how fast French
industries are getting back on a basis
where they can supply the needs of
France without recourse to foreign
countries.
France has kept equal pace in the
reconstruction of her devastated regi
ons.
Of the 2,712,00 French citizens who
were driven from their homes by the
German invasion, 1,533,00 are now
back on the job.
Of the 5,570 kilometers of railway
destroyed during the war 4,070 kilo
meters are back in operation.
Of the 5,760,000 acres of land ren
dered uncultivated because of the
presence of unexploded shells and mis
siles, 5,220,000 acres have been clean
ed and put back into cultivation.
Of the 3,060,000 acres of ground that
were pounded into nothing by shell
fire and other war activities, 2,870,000
have been restored to productivity.
Of the 11,500 factories that were de
stroyed by the war 3,540 are already
back in operation and another 3,842
are under reconstruction.
Of the 379,000 people who were em
ployed in these destroyed factories be
fore the war, 257,831 are back at
work in them.
