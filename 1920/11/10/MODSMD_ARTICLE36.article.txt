# GERMANS PLANNING TO CLOSE UNIVERSITIES
## 
### 
Dispatches from London state that
the German government Is considering
the advisability of closing the Uni
versities of Halle, Griefswald and
Marburg, on account of lack of funds.
This measure would give some relief
to the other universities Cologne,
Heidelberg and Karlsruhe, as the
amount of money is inadequate for
all, out would take care of the neces
sary expenses of the ones permitted
to continue work.
