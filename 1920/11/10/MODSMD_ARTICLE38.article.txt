# INDUSTRIAL WAR IN CHICAGO MAY FOLLOW EMPLOYERS' ACTION
## 
### United Press 
CHICAGO, Nov. 10. â€”Rumors of an
impending industrial war in Chicago
and the Mid West between employers
and union men advocating the closed
shop were prevalent here today when
the former went on record as favoring
the open shop, which gives non-union
men the right to work alongside union
men. This action was taken by the
Manufacturers' Association in a formal
resolution indorsing the open shop.
"It is evident that a great attempt
to kill organized labor will be made
this winter. Labor is prepared to fight
to the limit," said John Fitzpatrick,
president of the Chicago Federation of
Labor.
