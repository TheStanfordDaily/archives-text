# BRUIN BLEACHERS TOO SMALL FOR BIG GAME
## 
### 
Three thousand student applications
fur Big Game tickets have been refused
at the Univcrsily of California, due to
the great demand for seats at the Pa
cific Coast championship contest this
year. All those who applied for seats
in the rooters' section will be accom
modated, however.
The men's rooting section will include
the entire middle section and several
hundred scats of the adjoining sections.
The women's section will be next to the
men's on their right, and will occupy
three and a half sections.
