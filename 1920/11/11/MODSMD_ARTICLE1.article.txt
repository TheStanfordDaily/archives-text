# HOOVER LEAVES TO DEVOTE TIME TO RELIEF WORK
## Intends to Raise Large Sum For Benefit of Children's Welfare Fight in Europe 
### 
Herbert Hoover left for the East this
morning after being on the Stanford
campus about two weeks.
"I am going to devote myself to
raisng the $23,000,000 required to carry
on child feeding work in Europe," he
said. "This will be my occupation and
I shall be occupied with it until the
:fJ3,000 000 is raised."
During his last stay in the East,
Hoover, representing the American Re
lief Administration, was in conference
with other organizations engaged in
child welfare work in Europe, with the
result of a decision for united action on
behalf of the under-nourished children
in Europe during the coming winter. To
carry the under-nourished children of
Europe through until the next harvest
$23,000,000 will be required, most of
which must be raised through public
contributions in this country.
"We have been able to carry on this
work initially," Mr. Hoover said, "by
the assistance of the American govern
ment, latterly by contributions from
vairous sources.-without appeal to the
general public. There is now, however,
no other means for the continued sup
port of these children except the public
■charity of the American people. Con
ferences between the American Relief
Administration, the Red Cross, the Jew
ish Joint Distribution Committee, the
American Friends Service Committee,
the Y. VV. C. A., the Y. M. C. A. and
various church organizations have re
suited in a plan for co-operative action
in an effective organization of American
support to meet the piteous call of
these helpless children.
"The machinery for the work is now
in existence, in Europe. The people of
these nations, themselves, are supplying
food so far as they are able and paying
t!c cost of maintaining the distribution
s stem, but milk, fats, etc., without
which these children cannot survive to
eificient maturity, must come from
America. Until the required $23,000,00(1
is :::scd this effort will be my occupa
tion, '
Incidentally, Mr. Hoover will con
tinue in the movement of the engineer
ing societies of America to organize
themselves for public work. During his
recent Eastern visit he wafe the leader
in taking steps in this direction and has
been made chairman of the Engineering
Council. A meeting in Washington has
been called for November 16 to perfect
a still more complete confederation of
engineering societies to supersede this
Council.
Mrs. Hoover accompanied him on his
trip to the East.

Mr. Hoover has been occupied with a
large number of meetings of special
committees of the Board of Trustees
which have been dealing with particular
problems of the campus.

During hf? recent stay on the campus

problems of the campus.
Herbert Hoover left for the East this
morning after being on the Stanford
campus about two weeks.
"I am going to devote myself to
raisng the $23,000,000 required to carry
on child feeding work in Europe," he
said. "This will be my occupation and
I shall be occupied with it until the
:fJ3,000 000 is raised."
During his last stay in the East,
Hoover, representing the American Re
lief Administration, was in conference
with other organizations engaged in
child welfare work in Europe, with the
result of a decision for united action on
behalf of the under-nourished children
in Europe during the coming winter. To
carry the under-nourished children of
Europe through until the next harvest
$23,000,000 will be required, most of
which must be raised through public
contributions in this country.
"We have been able to carry on this
work initially," Mr. Hoover said, "by
the assistance of the American govern
ment, latterly by contributions from
vairous sources.-without appeal to the
general public. There is now, however,
no other means for the continued sup
port of these children except the public
■charity of the American people. Con
ferences between the American Relief
Administration, the Red Cross, the Jew
ish Joint Distribution Committee, the
American Friends Service Committee,
the Y. VV. C. A., the Y. M. C. A. and
various church organizations have re
suited in a plan for co-operative action
in an effective organization of American
support to meet the piteous call of
these helpless children.
"The machinery for the work is now
in existence, in Europe. The people of
these nations, themselves, are supplying
food so far as they are able and paying
t!c cost of maintaining the distribution
s stem, but milk, fats, etc., without
which these children cannot survive to
eificient maturity, must come from
