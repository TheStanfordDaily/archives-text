# VARSITY WORKS IN SPITE OF RAIN
## Coach Powell's Aggregation Improving Rapidly; Will Be In Shape November 20 
### 
Despite a heavy turf resulting from
j the rain of yesterday afternoon, |
! Coach Powell put the varsity through ;
! a fast scrimmage against the fresh- i
man eleven. Attention was centered
on the offensive and the varsity car- !
l ied the ball. The freshmen played i
a classy game on the defensive and j
! held on several occasions but Powell's
men broke through many times for
: gains.
All of the squad reported with the
exception of Deems who is hobbling
about on crutches as the result of a
! sprained ankle. Pelouze, DeGroot and
I Adams who have been laid up with
bad ankles reported for practice but
I did not take part in the scrimmage.
Practice was greatly facilitated by
the installation of three arc lamps
-which furnished illumination that en
able the team to work the usual
length of time in spite of the dark
ness of the day.
Another scrimmage is on the bill
for today and from now on the varsity
will be put through somo pretty stiff 1
workouts until the date of the Big!
Game.
Reports from Berkeley indicate that j
j Coach Andy Smith is putting the
Bruin varsity over the humps. Smith j
granted them three days of rest fol
i lowing their victory over Washing- j
1 ton State but practice was resumed
i last night.
Coach Powell is undecided as to the
men who will start the game. Un
-1 less Deems' ankle mends rapidly it
J will be necessary to make a change
iln the guard positions. McAlpine and
Pershing are going great guns at,
I tackle and look like certainties to
| start. "Rab" Shlaudeman is still
: battling for tho l ight end job against
| Adams while Pelouze has the left
| end position well in hand.
Fast practices during the next week
I may bring about some changes but
| from indications at present it appears
as if the mei\ will face the California
' varsity in the same array as they did
I Washington at Seattle last week. |
