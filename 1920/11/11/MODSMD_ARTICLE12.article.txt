# Jolly-Up Plans To Be Discussed at Luncheon
## 
### 
La Liana and Commuters' Club will
hold a joint luncheon tomorrow noon at
the Women's Clubhouse. The two or
ganizations, composed of students living
off the campus, will get together at this
luncheon to discuss plans for a jolly-up.
Nothing definite has been decided as
yet, except that the jolly-up will take
place some time during the fall quarter.
