# STANFORD FROSH GO AGAINST BRUIN BABES IN THEIR BIG GAME SATURDAY
## "Dummy" Wells' Proteges Come Down Victorious But Careful CAPTAIN WITTER AND NICHOLS STAR FOR CALIFORNIA 
### (By R. B. Coons, '23) "Daily Californian 
When Stanford's Freshman footbail
team trots 011 the field to meet the
Bruin Babes a real gridiron battle will
ensue, for the Cards will buck a bunch
of undefeated huskies comparable to
the 1923 eleven of last year which easily
won the "Big Game" of the first year
schedule.
For the first time this year the 1924
men will receive the undivided support
ot their respective universities and both
teams are doped to show their best in
the wind-up of the season. California
bxpects her freshmen to win de
cisively, but there is 110 overconfidence
either among the students or the team,
for California has tasted the bitter re
sults of underrating Stanford teams in
the past, and this season's dope
upsetting mania of the Cardinal Varsity
may well cause wearers of the Blue and
Gold to tremble, for it seems that a
victory over Stanford is never cinched
until the final whistle ends the game.
However, the Bruin Cubs have good
claim to the edge in Saturday's contest
011 account of the remarkable showing
of the team throughout the seven games
of the/preliminary season.
In the first game of the season the
freshmen romped off with a 42-6 victory
over University High, which has in
many previous years given the U. C.
beginners close battles. The following
week a strong front opposed the fresh
men in the "gobs" from the U. S. S.
Boston, shutting the sailors out by a
28-o^count.
To retrieve the seamen's lost laurels,
the Marines attempted to take the meas
ure of "Dummy" Wells' eleven, but
fared worse, being defeated 33-0. Then
came some more sailors the next Satur
day, and this time it was a different
matter; the opponents were strong and
the final score showed the freshmen to
have won by the closer score of 14-3.
On October 23 the College of the Pa
ri ;ic fell to the Babes 42-7. A week later
Davis Farm battled the freshmen to a
standstill most of the game, but allow
ing two scores, and the game ended
13-0. Last Saturday U. S. C. freshmen,
doped to defeat the northerners, met a
similar fate by a one touchdown margin.
Score 14-6. »
Much credit for the remarkable show
ing of the U. C. frosh' is due Coach
"Dummy" Wells, who has built a
formidable machine out of less and
more widely varying material than has
been the case in several years. Stanford
will probably remember regretfully the
performance of this "Dummy" in the
"Big Game" last year, when he was the
star and backbone of the Bruin eleven.
This year lie is fighting for California
in a different way, by coaching the
freshmen. So far lie has succeeded, but
Saturday will be the real test.
The stars of the Cub aggregation are
Captain Jack Witter and "Don" Nich
ols, fullback and halfback, respectively.
Witter is a kicker and can plunge
through the stiifest of defense lines.
Last year he starred for Berkeley High
and is keeping his reputation here.
Nichols, younger brother of Graduate
Manager Lute Nichols, was an All-
Southern half'from Pomona, and has all
season been a consistent and even
brilliant ground gainer. The other half
back position will be filled by a fast
and shifty player in Hodges, while
Robinson will call signals and is de
pended upon to exhibit a bit: of the
"football judgment" for which he is
noted.
In the line arc two speedy, hard
; hitting ends in Hufford, former Manual.
j Arts captain, and O'Brien, a newly
| developed wing who is hard to clip. J
Silcr. at center, is another local man. i
He is solid on defense, dangerous when
the ball changes hands and lias a beau
tiful accurate center's pass—swift and
true. Supporting him arc Nicl&ilman
and Heidt. both towers of strength in
defense and skilled in the art of hole
rending. Heidt is from Culver. Finally
is a pair at tackles who rarely fail to
break lip plays and make wide paths
for their halfback runners.
That is the team that will start
against the first year Redshirts in the
"Big Game" for the 1924 eleven. Coach
Wells, however, has plenty of substi
tute material, some of which is con
sidered better than many of this game's
regulars. Dunn, for instance, has
starred for the Babes all season „ nut
will be replaced for the sake of trying
i another combination. Hardy is strong
I at quarter and Powers, Millinowsky and
I Mell are first-rate linemen.
Up to the present time Wells has been
[ able to keep his team always guessing,
and therefore it has been necessary for
every man to keep on liis toes, or no
matter what his potentialities or former
! reputation may be, they have soon
I found places on the bench. In other
1 words, Coach "Dummy" has developed
1 so many men who have won their places
by hard work that lie is independent
and does not need to rely on stars.
Stanford always plays hardest against
California, and consequently the Bruin
i Cubs anticipate a battle regardless of
the edge given the Berkelevans by com
[ partitive victories and defeats of the
opposing teams.
