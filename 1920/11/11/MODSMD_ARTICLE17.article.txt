# FRESHMAN ELEVEN NOW IN BETTER SHAPE THAN EVER
## 
### 
Coach Seay pitted his Freshman
team against the Varsity squad last
night in scrimmage, and they showed to
better advantage than any time this
season. With the Varsity carrying the
nail, the Babes blockcd>and stopped
them time after time. Most of the
afternoon practice was spent in scrim
mage, Seay giving all of his attention
to bolstering up the defense. It ap
pears as if the first year squad is just
rounding into top form, and at the rat.'
they are going now they will surely
give the California Freshmen a mean
tight before the game is won.
A new system of lighting has been
installed on the field. Three big arcs
illuminate the entire field, so it is no
longer necessary to discontinue practice
011 account of darkness.
Seay is still undecided as to the final
lineup to start against the Bruin Cubs.
He will be unable to make a final selec
tion until late Friday, and even then
a shift or two may be necessary before
the eleven takes the field on Saturday.
It was believed that the backfield
situation was cleared up, but along
comes Benninger, a former Rugby
player at Lowell High, playing a classy
article of ball at left half in last night's
practice, and forces the dopesters to
contemplate a change again.
Ludeke, playing left tackle, also got
in some good moments against the Var
sity. He mussed things up 011 several
occasions and his tackling was all that
could be asked for. Fullerton worked
out at right guard and demonstrated
that he is still in the running.
These Cardinal Babes are due to sur
prise a lot of wiseacres who are predict
ing a loss for them by a big score.
While their showing against the Uni
versity of Southern California Fresh
men was admittedly poor, they have
improved wonde*iuHy during the past
week and a half Inul they will look like
a different team when they perform
against the Berkeleyites. Changes will
probably be made both in the line and
backfield before the game. As the team
stands now its work on the defense is
all that can be asked for. With three
plungint? backs of the type of Hey.
Judy and Campbell to carry the ball
the offensive end should be well cared
for. Woodward at quarter has shown
lots of ability at passing, so the spec
tators may look for some open field
plays on Saturday.
