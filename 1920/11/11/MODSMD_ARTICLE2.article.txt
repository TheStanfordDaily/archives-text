### Py Untied Press 
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 11.—The
trend of the Pacific Coast labor market
toward a condition of "more men than
jobs'* was noted here today by both em
ployers and employees. At the same
time employers in particular, ain,l in
some cases labor leaders, expressed a
belief that the situation was not alarm
in S- . . . .
"The situation as 1 see it is not yet
alarming on this coast,' said Paul
Scharrenborg, secretary of the Califor
nia State Federation of Labor. "But for
the future, this winter perhaps, the
situation looks serious."
R. 1. Clancy, assistant to the general
manager of the Southern Pacific Rail
road ,in charge of employment for the
-company, declared that "there is nothing
•to fear. There is a gradual easing up
.of th»' labor market,'' Clancy declared.
•"I believe it is clue more to seasonal
toonditions than to anything else.' »
"Conditions on this coast are much
different than in the East. Here we have
;i variety of industries, agriculture, min
ing. manufacturing, fruit growing and
lumbering. The East is dependent
largely on manufacturing alone. Foreig.i
trade conditions might upset the East
and cause a situation which it would
not affect on this coast."
