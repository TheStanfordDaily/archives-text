MEW STUDENTS are probably unaware of the agreement between
Stanford and the University of California which prohibits students
from either University invading the campus of the other to commit
acts of vandalism prior to athletic contests. Violations of this agree
ment by the student body of either university will cause the Big"
Game to be called off.
This agreement was made, after several unfortunate raids by the
over-enthusiastic students, and which resulted in considerable dam
age. Last year's football game hung in the balance for a few days
while the Presidents of both Stanford and California debated whether
ihey would call the game off.
The Big Game means more than can be realized to both Stanford
and California, and students who attempt to "raid" the Berkeley cam
pus will do nothing to be proud of and will without doubt cause the
Big Game to be called off.
Students who violate this agreement will be subject to discipli
nary action by the Student Council. Conviction would undoubtedly
mean explusion from the University.
