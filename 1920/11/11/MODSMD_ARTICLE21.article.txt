# A 						MEMORIAL PLAQUE
## 
### 
TO carry out the idea of Memorial Court, it might be a worthy act
for the War Memorial Committee to place a plaque on one side of
the Court to contain the names of the Stanford men who fell in the
World W r ar. A similar one is already in the Court for the men who
were killed in the Spanish-American War.
The committee is devoting its efforts to gathering funds for the
erection of a W r ar Memorial Building, but in the meantime a me
morial plaque would not' be out of place in Memorial Court.
