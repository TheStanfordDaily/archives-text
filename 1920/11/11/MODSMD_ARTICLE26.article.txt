### R. W. K 
One of our contribs. just dashed
over to tell us about the prof, in Fresh
man Biology who made a horrible con
fession to his class. He was explain
ing hot and cold sensations and il
lustrated by saying that one would
experience a cold sensation at first
on entering a hot bath. "All authoriti
es claim this, although I have never
experienced the sensation myself."

De Profundis.
Ye ed. lias a- hard-bitten boss who
makes him write Cabbages 011 what
i;i elsewhere a legal holiday, it comes
especially tough when he had laid
aside Armistice Day for an occasion
to try some of the home brew recipes
he had been collecting during the
past month.
* * *
What makes it worse is the type of
poetry like the following that our
contribs. insist on sending us:
Now I lay me down to sleep,
Hoping my homebrew will keep,
If I die before I wake,
Along with me my brew I'll take.
—Prosit.

Being a member of the No Hurry
Club we will still run a little cam
paign propaganda in our colyum. The
Republicans recently discovered that
the late Mark Twain was one of the
group opposed to the President. They
point to a book of his called "Pudd'n
head Wilson" as proof of this.

THANK YOU
' Don't mention it, sir," she said, re
pairing the damage done to her Mar
celle.

Two bright individuals attended the
piano concert last Tuesday evening.
Said one: "What do you think of
Benno's execution." The other: "I'm
in favor of it."
