# FRANCE CELEBRATES END OF WAR AND THE REPUBLIC'S BIRTH
## 
### HENRY WOOD (United Press Staff Correspondent 
PARIS, Nov. 11. —All France is to
day celebrating jointly the fiftieth
anniversary of the republic and the
second anniversary of the signing of
the armistice that ended the late
war.
In commemoration of the joint cele
bration, the above inscription uniting
the two dates has just been perma
nently inscribed on the Arch of Tri
umph at thd Eiole.
In order to give special significance,
however, it was decided not to chisel
the dates on the monument itself
along with the hundreds of thousands
of others, but to engrave it in the
fiagstones directly underneath the
center of the great arch.
While the fiiftieth anniversary of
the proclamation of the French re
public occurred on September 4, the
celebration of it was postponed until
today. The cne celebration marks the
birth of the republic; the other its
salvation.
By far the most striking feature
of today's celebration is the removal
to aim final internment at the Panthe
on of the heart of Gambetia, the
founder of the third republic.
The heart of Gambetta was taken
from his tomb this week at the Villa
of Les Jardis at Ville d'Avray and
placed in a box of wood, made from
the pines of the Vosges, which Gam
betta loved so well. Last night the
sacred relic, placed on an artillery
carriage and escorted by military
ontingents was brought to Paris and
rested for the night, surrounded by
troops and guards under the center
of the' Arch of Triumph and just over
the inscription given above, engraved
in the flagstones.
Then today, for the final escorting
of this relic to the Pantheon, Paris
vitnessed one of the most remark
able processions under the Arch of
Triumph that it has ever seen.
First of all there passed under the
Arch the battle flags of the entire
French army as it exists today—active,
reserve, colonial, as well as all battle
flags taken from the French in past
wars but later returned by their
former victors.
Scores of the flags that passed
under the Arch of Triumph today
were brought especially for the oc
casion from thousands and thousands
of miles of distance.
Each flag-bearer was escorted by two
soldiers from the regiment to which
the flag belonged.
In addition, there also participated
in the procession the survivors of the
war of IS7O and the mutilated of the
present war.
This procession after passing under
the Arch of Triumph continued its
way along streets lined on both sides
with troops holding their bayoneted
rifles at attention, until the square in
front of the Pantheon was reached.
At the Pantheon both a musical and
literary ceremony marked the final
interment of Gambetta's heart in the
great monument where lie remains of
the greatest men of France.
During the afternoon still another
ceremony was held at the Hotel de
Ville for the reception of the delega
tions from Alsace-Lorraine ,as well as
the mayors of all the French cities
and villages.
This evening four great military
processions will leave the Hotel de
ville marching out in four different
directions, one to Place de la Con
corde, one to Place de la Republique,
one to the Lion de Belfort and one
to Place de la Nation.
