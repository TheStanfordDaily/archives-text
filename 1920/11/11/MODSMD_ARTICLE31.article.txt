# AMERICA HAS NOW REPAID HALF OF DEBT FROM WAR
## 
### United Press 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 11—Oil the
second anniversary of the signing of
the armistice that ended the world
war, America's two foremost leaders
in that conflict are making ready to
step back into private life.
Just two years ago today President
Wilson, standing in the House of Rep
resentatives, read to an assemblage of
congressmen, cabinet officials and
diplomats the terms of the document
the Germans had been forced to sign.
Today, the President—a white haired
invalid—a casualty of the great war
he helped end, his friends say— is
making ready to leave the White
House for some quiet home where he
probably will write a history of the
great events in which he stood as a
leading figure.
Gen. John J. Pershing, head of the
American Expeditionary force, soon
will put aside the khaki. The first
full general since Grant, has finished
his reports. His work in connection
with the army reorganization act is
practically over. The general expects
soon to take a trip to South America
as an official representative of this
country. Beyond that his plans are
not known.
Along with President Wilson, there
will retire several cabinet members
who helped carry the burden of
America's war effort. Secretary of
War Baker and Secretary of the Navy
Daniels are two of these. Secretary
of Labor Wilson, who helped keep the
country free from labor troubles dur
ing the days of conflict; Postmaster
General Burleson, who managed the
telephone and telegraph lines, and
Secretary Houston, now in the trea
sury and formerly at the head of the
Agricultural Department, will also
leave the cabinet.
But if the war leaders ar passing
America still has before her sufficient
reminder of the days when the Ger
man hordes were turned slowly back.
Throughout the country on next
Sunday memorial services will be
held for more than 100,000 American
soldiers who were killed or died of
disease —114.465 is the exact number,
according to government statistics.
President Wilson has officially pro
claimed next Sunday as the (lay for
memorial services.
Nineteen thousand five hundred men
wounded and disabled, many of them
crippled for life, are still in govern
ment hospitals undergoing treatment,
according to figures of the War Risk
insurance bureau.
Some American troops are still in
Europe. They constitute the army of
occupation, 15,000 strong at Coblenz,
Germany, where the American forces
were assigned under terms of the
armistice.
And according to all reports, these
soldiers are living a vastly different
life from those who tramped through
the mud an dHved in dugouts. Be
of the decline of Germon monev
the American soldiers with their $30
a months are in the millionaire class.
Germany not being dry, a large glass
of beer can be obtained there for one
cent in American money. Other pri
ces are in proportion.
Nearly half of the cost of the war
to America is actual dollars has been
paid, according to Treasury Depart
ment figures. This, however, is ex
clusive of $10,000,000,000 loaned the
allies.
Exclusive of that $10,000,000,000,
former Secretary of the Treasury
Glass estimated the war cost this
country $26,007,000*,000. Of this $11,-
180,000,000 was paid in taxes during
the course of the war and afterward.
Two and a half billion more has been
paid since the armistice —a total of
$13,680,000,000 paid.
Under present plans of retiring the
debt it will take about twenty-five
years to retire the remainder of the
war debt.
