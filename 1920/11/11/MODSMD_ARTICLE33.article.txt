# FRESHMAN CLASS TOLD SYSTEM OF BON-FIRE LABOR SUPERVISION
## 
### 
Howard Gould, chairman of the
upper-classmen bon-fire committe,
briefly outlined the work expected of
the freshmen in preparation for the
bon-fire. Fifteen hours' work on the
construction of the pile and attend
ance on enough of the three-hour
guards shifts to make a total of twen
ty hours is the minimum requirement.
Time cards will be used to assure fair
dealing all round ,and a sophomore
foreman will be responsible for these
as well as all the work done by the
men under him. Alphabetic lists will
be made and a certain time indicated
as the most acceptable period for the
men to put in the required time.
Orion Clark, freshman president,
asked that the bon-fire be considered
a privilege and a duty rather than
a task, and also that every freshman
turn out to put the venture over
"big." Treasurer Haley called for the
assessment still due from over half
the class and asked for any outstand
ing taxi bills. A "bawl-out" list, will
be posted soon of those still owing.
