# NEW MEMORIAL TO ENGLAND'S DEAD IS UNVEILED BY KING
## 
### WEBB MILLER (United Press Staff Correspondent 
LONDON, Nov. 11.â€”England cele
brated the second anniversary of the
signing of the armistice by an im
pressive demonstation. In London
and most big cities the old air-raid
"maroon" warnings were nred as the
clock struck the hour at which hos
tilities ceased on the Western front,
and foot-passengers came to a halt in
the streets, standing with bowed
heads.
Londoners had a special and most
impressive ceremony, when as the
"maroons" boomed forth the hour,
King George unveiled the permanent
memorial to "The Glorious Dead,"
known as the Cenotaph, on Whitehall.
The monument is the marble replica
of the temporary Cenotaph erected
for the great Victory parade last year,
and which was saluted by the troops
of the Allied nations. Originally it
was intended to erect a much larger
memorial in one of the parks or big
open spaces, but the plaster cast of
Sir Edwin Lutyens' severely 1 plain
yet wierdly and solemnly beautiful
design caught the public imagination
and the spot, where it was originally
erected, almost opposite the Whitehall
end of Downing street, became a na
tional shrine hallowed by the tears of
countless pilgrims.
Unimaginative officials wished to
remove the structure immediately
after Victory parade but there was
such a public outcry that It. was al
lowed to remain until the plaster be
gan to crumble, and the erection of
a more substantial memorial became
imperative. Again officialdom wished
to erect the marble replica elsewhere,
but the British nation expressed its
wishes so definitely that the officials
gave way and the permanent Cenotaph
today rests on the original spot in
Whitehall.
King George with Queen Mary, the
Prince of Wales, Duke of York, and
Princess Mary drove from Bucking
ham Palace attended by a brilliant
staff and a sovereign's escort of Life
Guards resplendant in pre-war scarlet,
gold and steel. Drawn up around the
veiled Cenotaph were detachments
representing every branch of the
army, navy, and air forces. Allied
diplomats and foreign naval and mili
tary attaches were also present, as
were Premier Lloyd George and the
cabinet. A funeral party of the Guards
in pre-war crimson and gold stood
at each corner of the memorial with
heads bowed over their reversed
rifles, and guards of honor of the
King's Company, Grenadier Guards
and the Royal Navy with standards
and bands, stood ready to render
honors.
The formerly dreaded air raid warn
ings boomed out the hour. King
George, standing a little in front of
the royal group, immediately pulled
the silken cord releasing the drapery,
and stood at the salute. The guards
of honor presented arms and the huge
concourse remained absolutely sta
tionary for the prescribed two min
utes.
The silence was only broken when
the trumpets of the Guards sounded
the "Last Post" and "All Clear." Be
fore leaving the Cenotaph King
George placed a large wreath at the
foot of the plinth, an example which
was followed by Lloyd George, and
other prominent British and Allied
representatives. The inscription, "The
Glorious Dead," taught the popular
imagination more than anything else.
During the afternoon floral tributes
of every description, from expensive
hot-house products to Humble bunches
of wild flowers, were piled around the
plinth.
