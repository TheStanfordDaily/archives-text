### United Press 
BERLIN, Nov. 11.—German workers
seized a metal factory here today and
extinguished the fires. Other factories
were raided simultaneously. Police sur
rounded the metal factory, planning an
attack to dislodge the strikers. Other
workers took possession of a gas plant
in the north side of Berlin, establishing
a Soviet there, police reported. ✓
The seizure of the metal factory was
evidently carried out by the workers in
emulation of the Italian strikers who
captured and held the plants In Italy
during the recent labor disturbances
there. 1 his was the first demonstration
of the kind in Germany and the govern
ment immediately made plans to meet
the crisis.
Police reserves and detachments of
troops wore held in readiness for action
in event that the seizure of captives
should result in a fight or develop into
another outbreak.
Ihe agitators arc invading France,
where they hope to have no difficulty
in inducing workers to join in a gen
eral strike.
A general strike is a thing long
planned by the rail workers, who have
a hold on the control of industries of
the country. When the electrical work
ers walked out, demoralizing transporta
tion and industries dependent upon the
electrical power and light, they appeared
to again be urged on by radicals and
agitators.
The government interposed with an
ultimatum that the electrical plants will
be operated by the government if the
men did not return at once. To carry
out this threat large staffs of students
and experts were mobilized with the
view to crushing the strike.
