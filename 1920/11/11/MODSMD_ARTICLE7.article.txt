# FIRST BIG RALLY OF YEAR WILL BE STAGED TONIGHT
## Yell Leader Kinney Calls to All for a Short and Peppy Meeting in Assembly Hall 
### 
One of the biggest rallies of the year
will be Jield tonight in the Assembly
Hall at 7:30 sharp. It will be in prepa
ration for the freshman game Saturday,
combined with a varsity rally. The bal
cony will be reserved for the women,
who are urged to attend in full force.
The freshmen players will be repre
sented by Coach DuiTy Seay and Captain
Cliff Hey, who will say a few words con
cerning Saturday's contest with the
Berkeley team. For the varsity, Coach
Walter Powell and Captain Art Wilcox
will be the speakers.
Yell Leader Wendell Kinney has on
nounced that the meeting tonight will
be short and snappy. It is his desire to
make this rally an annual affair to pre
cede the freshman game with California
each year, something which lias not
been done in the past.
The songs to be used this year will
be sung and the bleacher stunts ex
plained by the yell leader. The winner
in the-song contest which has been con
ducted at the instigation of Sequoia
Club and the prize yell will be an
nounced tonight.
Yell Leader Kinney has called atten
tion to the fact that there have not been
satisfactory turnouts at any of the
bleacher or Encina rallies this year.
The upperelussmen in particular, he
says, have not been appearing as they
should. California has been working
bard on the songs and bleacher stunts
which they will use on November 20,
and Kinney is anxious that the Stanford
rooting section show up as well. He
emphasizes that this will be the last
opportunity to learn the new songs be
fore the Big Game. "This is also the
students' opportunity to show the fresh
men team that we are behind them,"
said Kinney this morning.
The usual parade will start down the
Row at 7 :10 under Assistant Yell Leader
Lester Seib. Bob Connolly will get the
Encina men together. The upperclass
men at Sequoia have been asked to see
that the men from that hall all attend
the rally.
