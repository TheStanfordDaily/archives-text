# NOVEMBER ISSUE OF PICTORIAL INVADES CAMPUS TOMORROW
## 
### 
The table of contents of the "Staf
ford Pictorial." which will be on sale
tomorrow, reveals an amazing group of
titles. "Remodeling the Dean of
Women," "What of the Economics De
partment?", "Where There Is So Much
Smoke," and "What Will Happen on
November 20?" all challenge the inter
est of camps readers. A reveiw of the
advance copy of the magazine shows
that the "Pictorial" is more than living
up to its motto, "The Students' Maga
zine of Opinion," in its first issue.
Of the athletic articles, aside from
the material on Big Game prospects, is
a contribution by Harry Maloney, Di
rector of Minor Sports at Stanford. Ma
loney was trainer of the All-California
Rugby team which toured Europe two
months ago and won for America the
Olympic Games championship. He
writes interestingly in the "Pictfrrial"
of this amazing exploit of the little
band of Americans who sailed across
the Atlantic to beat old Europe's best
at its own game.
A wealth of pictures of events of the
past month is a part of this issue. The
usual four-page illustrated supplement
that accompanies the magazine is added
to by numerous other illustrations in the
body of the magazine. A page feature
of pictures of "Current Events" is one
of these. Cartoons, too, are a part of the
magazine. One, entitled "The Annual
Sorority Tic-Up," accompanies the arti
cle on "Sororities and Stanford," by
Miss Dorothy Hoskins, '19. George
Hall, '19, has contributed a page of
satirical cartoons entitled "We Nomi
nate for the Hall of Fame."
The price of the November "Pictorial"
is 25 cents and will be sale, rain or
shine, tomorrow morning.
