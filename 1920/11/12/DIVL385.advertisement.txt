When was Your (>ar |
Oiled and Greased ?
WE KEEP YOUR CAR OILED
> AND GREASED
I A speedometer record is kept of your car, with a chart
showing the parts that WERE oiled and greased on
I last service.
Parts of your car should be oiled and greased at various
mileages between 750 and 2500 miles. It is reason
able to believe your car will not need complete service
on each visit but the parts that REALLY NEED AT
TENTION should have service when necessary-
It is safe to say that 25 per cent of repair bills can be
traced to improper lubrication. Let us save you this
expense. Costs moderate.
