# BERLIN WORKERS SURRENDER PLANT TO GOVERNMENT
## Prompt Action of Police Saves German Capital from Strike Of All Classes of Workers 
### United Press 
BERLIN, Nov. 12.â€”The German
government was triumphant today in
a clash with radical workmen who
attempted to emulate Italian work
ers in the siezure of plants. Metal
factories, siezed by strikers yesterday
were abandoned when police sud
denly surrounded them. There was
110 opposition on the part of the work
ers. They realized that they would
be stamped out if they did not yield.
The Soviet which siezed a gas plant
on the north side of the city yesterday
withdrew.
Electrical workers returned to their
positions today after a strike of two
weeks. The government had recruited
a staff of students and expected to re
place them. Despite the settlement
offiicials feared this early recklessness
among the workers would result in a
series of strikes later, similar to
those which occurred in Germany last
winter.
Street cars went into service this
morning for the first time in a week
and factories dependent upon electric
power resumed operations.
