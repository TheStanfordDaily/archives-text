# W. J. CROOK, '11, GIVES INTERESTING SPEECH ON IRON METALLURGY
## 
### 
Mr. W. J. Crook, '11, Chief Metal
lurgist of the Pacific Coast Steel Co.,
rat South San Francisco, addressed
! the class* in the Metallurgy of Iron
| and Steel today, on the subject of the
basic open hearth process of making
steel, with special reference to Pacific
Coast practice. The Coast practice
! is of particular interest in that the
scarcity and high cost of pig iron in
this region precludes its use on a large
scale in the manufacture of steel, so
that steel scrap is used almost ex
clusively. It is necessary to add car
bonaceous material, such as coke,
j petroleum coke, etc., to the furnace
j in order that there may be sufficient
carbon in the steel when it is melsed
j to permit the satisfactory working of
1 the process, and the elimination of
' impurities from the scrap.
Through the courtesy of Mr. Crook,
arrangements will be made so that
all members of the class will have an
opportunity t ovisit the plant at South
, San Francisco in order to see the pro-
I cess in operation.
