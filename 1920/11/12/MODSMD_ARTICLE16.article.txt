# VARSITY PLAYERS RESTING UP FOR CALIFORNIA GAME
## Men Injured in Last Contest Report for Daily Practice For Final Fight of Season 
### 
With no schedule game tomorrow,
the Cardinal varsity football squad
will not be handicapped with injured
men next week. At present four of
the first-string players are 011 the
sime-injured list, but are now report
ing to practice daily.
Coach Powell is gradually round- i
ing his men into shape for the Big I
Game, which is only eight days off.
Unless the Coach finds it necessary
to make a last-minute shift, the
eleven to start the contest against the
Bruins will be practically the same
men that commenced against the Uni
versity of Washington.
Bob Shlaudeman will run out 011 the
field at Berkeley 011 November 20
ready to call out the signals for the j
varsity from the "farm." Coach j
Powell made a find when he started 1
using Shlaudeman at quarter. Not
only does he play a heady game, but
can bq accounted for a large share of
the yardage gains.
The other backfield positions are
being strongly contested for by Cap
tain Wilcox, Campbell, Templeton,
Mertz, Patrick, Arnett and Woollomes.
In the two Conference games Wilcox
and Templeton at halves and Patrick
at full have been the favorites. How-!
ever the other players are far from
being out of running and the definite
backfield lineup is uncertain. Camp
bell, who was# the early season star'
for Stanford, is recovering from his j
mid-season slump, and is fighting hadr !
for his old berth at left half. Wool
lomes has showed his worth at full
in the last lew minutes of play of
recent games.
The line can be more easily picked.
Righter, without a question of doubt,
will fill the center position. Cravens
will probably start at left guard, while
Deems will work at right guard if his 1
foot permits. Pershing and McAlpine j
are expected to enter the Big Game 1
as the Cardinal tackles. Pelouze will
start at left end, while Adams and K. j
Shlaudeman are fighting for the other
wing.
Yell Leader Kinney is now trying
to make arrangements for a bleacher ;
rally which will be held next Thurs- j
day night.
