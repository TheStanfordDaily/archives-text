The sopohomores played in luck tliid
year. Through the help of Gordon J
Davis they obtained a play which has :
not yet been touched by any stock or j
road companies. The snappy comedy is
at present {Maying in London and Chi- j
cago, having completed a most success
ful initial run in New York.
Manv stock and road companies have
made attempts to get permits to produce j
the play, but the author, who is a Cali
fornian, has been holding it in reserve.
The author happens to be a friend of |
Coach Gordon Davis, and through
friendship he permitted Davis to pro
duce it here.
"The play," says Davis, "is the best
that could' be found for Sophomore
production. It is a great modern comic;
sensation and vast dramatic material in I
the class of '23 cinches it for a campus
success. We shall announce the name
of the play Monday."
