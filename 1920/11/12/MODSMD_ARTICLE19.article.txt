# STANFORD FRESHMEN PREPARED FOR JUNIOR BIG GAME WITH BRUIN CUBS; SCRAPPY GAME EXPECTED TOMORROW
## Coach Seay's Men to Fight Hard to Win from Berkeley Squad 
### (By Harry J. Borba, '22 
"Fight" is the idea that every member
of the Freshman football squad will
carry to Stanford Field Saturday after
noon when the Cardinal Babes tangle
with the University of California eleven
in the junior big game of the football
season. Captain Cliff Hey has promised

for the team that everyone of them will
be in there to fight until the last gun.
Coach Seay steadfastly refuses to make
any promises as to the outcome of the
game, but declares that the Freshman
team will fight to uphold the honor of
Stanford.
Despite the early season record of
the Berkeley Freshmen, the Stanford
men are certain that they have more
than a chance of annexing the right end
of the scorc. They are determined to
fight every minute of the contest. They
are going into the game determined to
carry the battle to their highly touted
opponents. Having this attitude of mind
on the eve of the game the Babes
should provide the Bruin Cubs with
plenty of opposition and the spectators
with loads of thrills. Everyone likes to
see a winner, but next to a winner a
fighting loser wins the applause. Stan
ford's Freshmen have promised to fur
nish the fight,so everyone should be
satisfied.
A comparison of records shows that
the, edge is all with California. They
have played better football throughout
the preliminary season. In the coming
contest, however, it is not so much a
matter of past records. Records are
lost sight of when the Stanford Red
tangles with the Blue and Gold. Cali
fornia is coming to Stanford confident
but careful, for they have every respect
for Stanford Spirit, that mythical some
thing that is ever evident when Cali
fornia and Stanford meet in competition
of any sort. Seay's men are determined
to show that although they have been
here but a few short weeks, they are
imbued with that same famous spirit
that makes the Cardinal Varsity feared
across the hay. Even though the odds
are against them, the Cardinal Babes
will show they have the stuff of which
Varsities are made.
The first-year men scrimmaged with
the Varsity again last night in practice
and showed once more that they are a
better teamHhan they have been given


CAPTAIN CLIFF HEY
Fullback and one of the best Stanford
Freshman line-plungers
J credit for. Their work 011 the defensive
I was particularly good and their offensive
I worried the Varsity considerably.
Every practice seems to develop a
new man of promise. Wednesday Ben
i ninger, despite a rugby handicap,
started to show a clever line of playing;
last night he was positively good. Time
! alter time he tore through for gains.
His playing during these scrimmages
lias practically cinched a position for
him in the backfield. Avery, a hitherto
unheard of young man on the squad,
shook out several good boots last night
and hopped into the possibility line for
j the big game.
Coach Seay is still undecided as to
the lineup that will open against the
Berkeleyites. The men have been show
j ing so much new stuff this week that
he will be unable to decide until the
1 referee signals for the game to begin.
). Hey will start the game at fullback.
He is the only certainty, and barring
i accident will be in there. A line plunger
i of ability, and toting a mean boot, Hey
is counted on to tear a few yai ds
through the Cubs' line.
Woodward is the choice for the quar
terback position. "Bud" has been call
ing plays all season an dgets away with
the job in approved style. Besides lie
attends to most of the punting and for-
U The'half 11 backs will undoubtedly be
Campbell and Benninger with Judy
and Gonzales in the offing. Judy lias
been regarded as the man for the job
throughout the season but the play
ing of Benningsr in the scrimmages
of the last few days give him the edge
for the job at left half. Campbell will
likely take care of right half. 'Scotchy
is about the scrappiest player on the
squad and it takes a mighty strong
line to hold him when he gets going, (
which is often.
In the line Dunbar will play the 1
center position. Dunbar has perfected
; his backward passes and is adept at
I snapping the ball to the quarterback.
He has also sh wn up well 011 the
defense. Flood is second choice. This
is Flood's first year of American foot
ball and he gives every promise of

developing into a good player but as
yet he is not in Dunbar's class.
Slater will start at left end. Slater
is remembered by a great many Stan
ford students as left end 011 the Stan
ford S. A. T. C. team of 1918. He is
a good heady player with plenty of
experience to draw upon.
Frank fuller, with two years of
American experience at Potter School
in San Francisco, has demonstrated
his ability to care for the right end
of the line, Scofield of Palo Alto High
has been fighting for the job and will
doubtless break into the game during
the latter stages. Fuller gets down
under the punts well and is a crack
erjack defensive man. Scofleld's stunt
is running away 011 forward passes.
Ludeke and Hartranft are the likeli
st candidates for the tackle positions.
Ludeke is a young mountain from
Coalinga where he played one year of
American football. He is a willing
worker and a good tackle with the
advantage of size. Avery may be
counted on to get into the game 011
the strength of his showing during this
week's workouts. Hartranft hails
from Fuller ton where he played on
his high school eleven. He is like
wise a man of size and pairs off well
with Ludeke. Ludeke will start at
left tackle and Hartranft at right.
Greenwood of Los Angeles High has
been running Hartranft closely for the
position and may yet get into the
contest.
"Tubby" Ong looks like the choice
for the left guard position with Arthur
holding down the same position 011
the right side of center. Both are big
men and have been going great guns
in practice. Ong played one year on
the Pasadena High eleven but Arthur
has had 110 pervious experience. Ful
lerton a former Lowell rugby player
is the other candidate who has a
chance. Finley of Palo Alto is in the
field for one of the jobs and may
break into the struggle.
The game will be called promptly
at 2:45 p.m. Student body ticket
holders will be admitted for 75c while
all others will be charge $1.

worker and a good tackle with the
advantage of size. Avery may be
counted on to get into the game 011
the strength of his showing during this
week's workouts. Hartranft hails
from Fuller ton where he played on
his high school eleven. He is like
wise a man of size and pairs off well
with Ludeke. Ludeke will start at
left tackle and Hartranft at right.
Greenwood of Los Angeles High has
been running Hartranft closely for the
position and may yet get into the
contest.
"Tubby" Ong looks like the choice
for the left guard position with Arthur
holding down the same position 011
the right side of center. Both are big
men and have been going great guns
in practice. Ong played one year on
the Pasadena High eleven but Arthur
has had 110 pervious experience. Ful
lerton a former Lowell rugby player
is the other candidate who has a
chance. Finley of Palo Alto is in the
field for one of the jobs and may
break into the struggle.
The game will be called promptly
at 2:45 p.m. Student body ticket
holders will be admitted for 75c while
all others will be charge $1.
"Fight" is the idea that every member
of the Freshman football squad will
carry to Stanford Field Saturday after
noon when the Cardinal Babes tangle
with the University of California eleven
in the junior big game of the football
season. Captain Cliff Hey has promised

for the team that everyone of them will
be in there to fight until the last gun.
Coach Seay steadfastly refuses to make
any promises as to the outcome of the
game, but declares that the Freshman
team will fight to uphold the honor of
Stanford.
Despite the early season record of
the Berkeley Freshmen, the Stanford
men are certain that they have more
than a chance of annexing the right end
of the scorc. They are determined to
fight every minute of the contest. They
are going into the game determined to
carry the battle to their highly touted
opponents. Having this attitude of mind
on the eve of the game the Babes
should provide the Bruin Cubs with
plenty of opposition and the spectators
with loads of thrills. Everyone likes to
see a winner, but next to a winner a
fighting loser wins the applause. Stan
ford's Freshmen have promised to fur
nish the fight,so everyone should be
satisfied.
A comparison of records shows that
the, edge is all with California. They
have played better football throughout
the preliminary season. In the coming
contest, however, it is not so much a
matter of past records. Records are
lost sight of when the Stanford Red
tangles with the Blue and Gold. Cali
fornia is coming to Stanford confident
but careful, for they have every respect
for Stanford Spirit, that mythical some
thing that is ever evident when Cali
fornia and Stanford meet in competition
of any sort. Seay's men are determined
to show that although they have been
here but a few short weeks, they are
imbued with that same famous spirit
that makes the Cardinal Varsity feared
across the hay. Even though the odds
are against them, the Cardinal Babes
will show they have the stuff of which
Varsities are made.
The first-year men scrimmaged with
the Varsity again last night in practice
and showed once more that they are a
better teamHhan they have been given


CAPTAIN CLIFF HEY
Fullback and one of the best Stanford
Freshman line-plungers
J credit for. Their work 011 the defensive
I was particularly good and their offensive
I worried the Varsity considerably.
Every practice seems to develop a
new man of promise. Wednesday Ben
i ninger, despite a rugby handicap,
started to show a clever line of playing;
last night he was positively good. Time
! alter time he tore through for gains.
His playing during these scrimmages
lias practically cinched a position for
him in the backfield. Avery, a hitherto
unheard of young man on the squad,
shook out several good boots last night
and hopped into the possibility line for
j the big game.
Coach Seay is still undecided as to
the lineup that will open against the
Berkeleyites. The men have been show
j ing so much new stuff this week that
he will be unable to decide until the
1 referee signals for the game to begin.
). Hey will start the game at fullback.
He is the only certainty, and barring
i accident will be in there. A line plunger
i of ability, and toting a mean boot, Hey
is counted on to tear a few yai ds
through the Cubs' line.
Woodward is the choice for the quar
terback position. "Bud" has been call
ing plays all season an dgets away with
the job in approved style. Besides lie
attends to most of the punting and for-
U The'half 11 backs will undoubtedly be
Campbell and Benninger with Judy
and Gonzales in the offing. Judy lias
been regarded as the man for the job
throughout the season but the play
ing of Benningsr in the scrimmages
of the last few days give him the edge
for the job at left half. Campbell will
likely take care of right half. 'Scotchy
is about the scrappiest player on the
squad and it takes a mighty strong
line to hold him when he gets going, (
which is often.
In the line Dunbar will play the 1
center position. Dunbar has perfected
; his backward passes and is adept at
I snapping the ball to the quarterback.
He has also sh wn up well 011 the
defense. Flood is second choice. This
is Flood's first year of American foot
ball and he gives every promise of

developing into a good player but as
yet he is not in Dunbar's class.
Slater will start at left end. Slater
is remembered by a great many Stan
ford students as left end 011 the Stan
ford S. A. T. C. team of 1918. He is
a good heady player with plenty of
experience to draw upon.
Frank fuller, with two years of
American experience at Potter School
in San Francisco, has demonstrated
his ability to care for the right end
of the line, Scofield of Palo Alto High
has been fighting for the job and will
doubtless break into the game during
the latter stages. Fuller gets down
under the punts well and is a crack
erjack defensive man. Scofleld's stunt
is running away 011 forward passes.
Ludeke and Hartranft are the likeli
st candidates for the tackle positions.
Ludeke is a young mountain from
Coalinga where he played one year of

is Flood's first year of American foot
ball and he gives every promise of

developing into a good player but as
yet he is not in Dunbar's class.
Slater will start at left end. Slater
is remembered by a great many Stan
ford students as left end 011 the Stan
ford S. A. T. C. team of 1918. He is
a good heady player with plenty of
experience to draw upon.
Frank fuller, with two years of
American experience at Potter School
in San Francisco, has demonstrated
his ability to care for the right end
of the line, Scofield of Palo Alto High
has been fighting for the job and will
doubtless break into the game during
the latter stages. Fuller gets down
under the punts well and is a crack
erjack defensive man. Scofleld's stunt
is running away 011 forward passes.
Ludeke and Hartranft are the likeli
st candidates for the tackle positions.
Ludeke is a young mountain from
Coalinga where he played one year of
American football. He is a willing
worker and a good tackle with the
advantage of size. Avery may be
counted on to get into the game 011
the strength of his showing during this
week's workouts. Hartranft hails
from Fuller ton where he played on
his high school eleven. He is like
wise a man of size and pairs off well
with Ludeke. Ludeke will start at
left tackle and Hartranft at right.
Greenwood of Los Angeles High has
been running Hartranft closely for the
position and may yet get into the
contest.
"Tubby" Ong looks like the choice
for the left guard position with Arthur
holding down the same position 011
the right side of center. Both are big
men and have been going great guns
in practice. Ong played one year on
the Pasadena High eleven but Arthur
has had 110 pervious experience. Ful
lerton a former Lowell rugby player
is the other candidate who has a
chance. Finley of Palo Alto is in the
field for one of the jobs and may
break into the struggle.
The game will be called promptly
at 2:45 p.m. Student body ticket
holders will be admitted for 75c while
all others will be charge $1.
"Fight" is the idea that every member
of the Freshman football squad will
carry to Stanford Field Saturday after
noon when the Cardinal Babes tangle
with the University of California eleven
in the junior big game of the football
season. Captain Cliff Hey has promised

for the team that everyone of them will
be in there to fight until the last gun.
Coach Seay steadfastly refuses to make
any promises as to the outcome of the
game, but declares that the Freshman
team will fight to uphold the honor of
Stanford.
Despite the early season record of
the Berkeley Freshmen, the Stanford
men are certain that they have more
than a chance of annexing the right end
of the scorc. They are determined to
fight every minute of the contest. They
are going into the game determined to
carry the battle to their highly touted
opponents. Having this attitude of mind
on the eve of the game the Babes
should provide the Bruin Cubs with
plenty of opposition and the spectators
with loads of thrills. Everyone likes to
see a winner, but next to a winner a
fighting loser wins the applause. Stan
ford's Freshmen have promised to fur
nish the fight,so everyone should be
satisfied.
A comparison of records shows that
the, edge is all with California. They
have played better football throughout
the preliminary season. In the coming
contest, however, it is not so much a
matter of past records. Records are
lost sight of when the Stanford Red
tangles with the Blue and Gold. Cali
fornia is coming to Stanford confident
but careful, for they have every respect
for Stanford Spirit, that mythical some
thing that is ever evident when Cali
fornia and Stanford meet in competition
of any sort. Seay's men are determined
to show that although they have been
here but a few short weeks, they are
imbued with that same famous spirit
that makes the Cardinal Varsity feared
across the hay. Even though the odds
are against them, the Cardinal Babes
will show they have the stuff of which
Varsities are made.
The first-year men scrimmaged with
the Varsity again last night in practice
and showed once more that they are a
better teamHhan they have been given


CAPTAIN CLIFF HEY
Fullback and one of the best Stanford
Freshman line-plungers
J credit for. Their work 011 the defensive
I was particularly good and their offensive
I worried the Varsity considerably.
Every practice seems to develop a
new man of promise. Wednesday Ben
i ninger, despite a rugby handicap,
started to show a clever line of playing;
last night he was positively good. Time
! alter time he tore through for gains.
His playing during these scrimmages
lias practically cinched a position for
him in the backfield. Avery, a hitherto
unheard of young man on the squad,
shook out several good boots last night
and hopped into the possibility line for
j the big game.
Coach Seay is still undecided as to
the lineup that will open against the
Berkeleyites. The men have been show
j ing so much new stuff this week that
he will be unable to decide until the
1 referee signals for the game to begin.
). Hey will start the game at fullback.
He is the only certainty, and barring
i accident will be in there. A line plunger
i of ability, and toting a mean boot, Hey
is counted on to tear a few yai ds
through the Cubs' line.
Woodward is the choice for the quar
terback position. "Bud" has been call
ing plays all season an dgets away with
the job in approved style. Besides lie
attends to most of the punting and for-
U The'half 11 backs will undoubtedly be
Campbell and Benninger with Judy
and Gonzales in the offing. Judy lias
been regarded as the man for the job
throughout the season but the play
ing of Benningsr in the scrimmages
of the last few days give him the edge
for the job at left half. Campbell will
likely take care of right half. 'Scotchy
is about the scrappiest player on the
squad and it takes a mighty strong
line to hold him when he gets going, (
which is often.
In the line Dunbar will play the 1
center position. Dunbar has perfected
; his backward passes and is adept at
I snapping the ball to the quarterback.
He has also sh wn up well 011 the
defense. Flood is second choice. This
is Flood's first year of American foot
