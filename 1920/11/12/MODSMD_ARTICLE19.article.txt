# STANFORD FRESHMEN PREPARED FOR JUNIOR BIG GAME WITH BRUIN CUBS; SCRAPPY GAME EXPECTED TOMORROW
## Coach Seay's Men to Fight Hard to Win from Berkeley Squad 
### (By Harry J. Borba, '22 
"Fight" is the idea that every member
of the Freshman football squad will
carry to Stanford Field Saturday after
noon when the Cardinal Babes tangle
with the University of California eleven
in the junior big game of the football
season. Captain Cliff Hey has promised

for the team that everyone of them will
be in there to fight until the last gun.
Coach Seay steadfastly refuses to make
any promises as to the outcome of the
game, but declares that the Freshman
team will fight to uphold the honor of
Stanford.
Despite the early season record of
the Berkeley Freshmen, the Stanford
men are certain that they have more
than a chance of annexing the right end
of the scorc. They are determined to
fight every minute of the contest. They
are going into the game determined to
carry the battle to their highly touted
opponents. Having this attitude of mind
on the eve of the game the Babes
should provide the Bruin Cubs with
plenty of opposition and the spectators
with loads of thrills. Everyone likes to
see a winner, but next to a winner a
fighting loser wins the applause. Stan
ford's Freshmen have promised to fur
nish the fight,so everyone should be
satisfied.
A comparison of records shows that
the, edge is all with California. They
have played better football throughout
the preliminary season. In the coming
contest, however, it is not so much a
matter of past records. Records are
lost sight of when the Stanford Red
tangles with the Blue and Gold. Cali
fornia is coming to Stanford confident
but careful, for they have every respect
for Stanford Spirit, that mythical some
thing that is ever evident when Cali
fornia and Stanford meet in competition
of any sort. Seay's men are determined
to show that although they have been
here but a few short weeks, they are
imbued with that same famous spirit
that makes the Cardinal Varsity feared
across the hay. Even though the odds
are against them, the Cardinal Babes
will show they have the stuff of which
Varsities are made.
The first-year men scrimmaged with
the Varsity again last night in practice
and showed once more that they are a
better teamHhan they have been given
