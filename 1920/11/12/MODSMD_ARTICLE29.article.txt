# COME THROUGH, '24
## 
### 
FOR the first time this season the freshman football team
will be the center of interest when they go up against the
freshman team from the University of California tomorrow,
ft may have appeared at times to the 1924 team that they were
not receiving the proper backing of the student body, but they
will find tomorrow that the attitude of the students will be
shown in 110 uncertain terms, when the team lines up for the
kick-off. Stanford does not make much noise about her fresh -
men, but she is behind them solidly. It is not the Stanford!
way to tell the freshmen that they are good and to announce I
publicly that they are unbeatable.
At the same time, Stanford is behind the freshmen, as!
they will discover tomorrow, and she expects the 1924 team
to make good. Freshman teams have been beaten before by
California, and the student body has made no complaint. But
a protest will be made if the freshmen do come out of the game
without having given all that they have, even though the score
is badly one-sided. Stanford teams have gone against Cali
fornia before with the "dope" against them, and they have
come through, simply by a wonderful exhibition of Stanford j
Spirit. Stanford teams do not always win, but the Golden ,
Bear always knows that he has been through a battle.
You have a solid rooting section behind you, so go get
'em, freshmen!
