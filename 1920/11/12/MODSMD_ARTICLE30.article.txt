## 
### 
Early next week a drive for member
ship in the Red Cross will begin on the
campus. From November 14 to No
vember 16 an effort will be made
throughout the country to renew sub
scriptions and increase membership in
the organization. The Red Cross is con
tinuing in peace times much of the
work that it carried on during the war,
and for which funds are necessary.
Last year the campus membership
was 700, but this year an effort will be
made to secure 1000 subscriptions at
$1 apiece. Monday the campaign will
begin in the halls and houses and
Wednesday the drive will be made on
Quad.
