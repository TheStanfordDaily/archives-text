# RULE ON NUMBERING PLAYERS MAY PASS FOOTBALL COMMITTEE
## 
### HENRY L. FARRELL (United Press Staff Correspondent 
NEW YORK, Nov. 12. —Legislation
requiring all football teams to number
players may find its way oil the grid
iron law books when the rules com
mittee meets this winter.
Numerous other reforms are also be
ing agitated. The committee is ex
pected to go on record with a censure
of the "scouting system" and the
practice, becoming more and more
prevalent, of coaxing star players
away from other colleges and univer
sities.
Numbering players, as a concession
to the public, has been the subject
of agitation for several years. The
rules committee had it up last winter
and disposed of the proposal with a
resolution —-"The committee recom
mends that all players be numbered."
Practically all of the major teams
are numbering their players this sea
son except Yale, Harvard and the two
service academies.
Princeton has been numbering the
Tigers in every game and has an
nounced the intention of doing the
same thing in the big games with Yale
and Harvard, although it seems likely
that they will not do it.
Commander Douglas Howard, of the
Naval academy, said after the recent
Princeton-Navy game that the mid
shipmen would not be numbered in
any game. If the Navy takes this at
titude, it is certain that the Army
will do the same thing.
One of the objections is that
"scouts" can pick out star players
and that trick plays are more easily
detected by numbers.
However, this objection will be over
ruled if some action is taken by the
rules committee, or the athletic bodies
of the big universities to discourage
"scouting."
Princeton , the lone member of the
"Big Three" to show any progressive
ideas, has come out against "scout
ing" with the assertion that they will
not do it in the future. A "gentle
man's agreement" is said to have been
reached among the "Big Three" to
discourage the practice.
Last year after losing the annual
game to the Naval Academy, the Army
announced that it was going out and
get players. The Navy howls that the
Cadet management did go out and
rolled rtars by a wholesale distribu
tion of appointments.
Rutgers is also howling about the
same tiling, having had a good team
ruined by Nine staj
players left and went to other uni
versities, where they are starring this
year. French and Stork went to West
Point, Kelly to Yale. Alexander and
Duffy to Fordham, Whitehill to Penn,
Meistrell to Princeton, and Hummell
to Lafayette.
Some very interesting disclosures
about the inducements being offered
to prep school stars is promised for
the winter meeting.
