# CABBAGES and THINGS
## 
### R. W. K 
When the "Pictorial" came off the
press yesterday, the generous manage
ment passed out cigars to the press
force. One of the linotype operators
remarked to ye ed., as he puffed on
one of the "Pic's" cigars: "This is
better than 'Cabbages.'"

Yesterday's United Press service
brought us the information that the
fire department in St. Lambert, Que
bec, had been destroyed by fire... It
was the one smile in the day's news.
It reminded us of the bald-headed
barber who tried to sell us hair tonic
the other day.

Dear Onion: Column Editors are
the same as lions, only they haven't
so much hair on their necks; look at
'em square and they forget to roar.
Our pow-wow with the D. P. A.'s went
something, to wit:
"So you want to make some Cab
bages and Things?" lie says.
"We ain't an architect," we says,
real witty—which he didn't laff at,
which shows that he isn't smart like
us.
"It's hard to write something funny
every day," he says.
"It would be easy," we says. "I
know of 500 funny things right here."
"Won't do, won't do," he says. "Why,
do you know, every one of the '500'
would read 'em, and —"
"Then I'm a wonder, by cricky, if I
can get 500 to read my stuff," we says.
So I guess we're on' the paper be
cause of our smartness, only we
aren't telling everybody how smart
we are like some conceits we know of.
We notice that spats are the rage
with the Co-eds, bless 'em. For Harry
Holdover who thinks spats is a new
type of baby roadster we'll explain
that spats are the same to the legging
as half-socks are to the stockings.
Buttons are regulation instead of
lace.
A lot of fifteen-ball experts that
hound the Union's two lonely tables
would save their Old Gents consider
able jack if they'd drop college and
take a special course in Kelly at
Slade's. The course wouldn't br> any
more intensive than the one they're
taking at the Union, and there'd be
no syllabus fees. And maybe they
could stick their instructor one out of
every two or three games.
Remember me to Mamie.

The rough in the window says:
"Judging from appearence, the 500
get very little for all the money they
put into clothes."
