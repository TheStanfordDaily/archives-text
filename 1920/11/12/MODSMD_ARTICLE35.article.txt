## 
### United Press 
CHICAGO, Nov. 12. —Wage awards
which will affect more than a hundred
thousand men employed on close to
: 00 short lino railroads throughout the
country will be announced within the
next l'e.v weeks, according to United
States Railroad Labor Board officials,
here today.
The wages sought are similar to
those asked by the Big Four Brother
hood and employes cn big roans. These
employes, numbering two million were
i recently awarded approximately 60
per cent of their demands.
Though there are 600 shortline rail
roads in the country, employes on only
}»7 have asked the Board to apply the
recent award to them Originally 115
made application to the board but
officials of 18 of these have volun
tarily applied the award and the ap
plications withdrawn. In addition to
these 18, 35 other roads have applied
the recent award, making a total of
53 roads voluntarily applying the
award.
The decision in the case now being
studied by the board will be of tre
mendous importance to employes on
other shortline roads. What action
is taken in this case is believed al
most certain to be applied to all of
; them. It is considered most probable
that the Board will cover all shortline
roads in its decision.
I The shortline road employes are
i backed in their demands by officials
of the Brotherhoods and tiie Amer
! ican Federation of Labor. Practically
all of them are members of the
Brotherhood or of the Department of
railway Employees of the American
Federation of Labor. Their request
was not included in the earlier de
mands, because short line roads were
i operated under private control. It
was only employes on roads that were
formerly under federal control that
, asked for a raise. The latter origin
ally made their demands when the
government operated the roads and
by the time they obtained the action
sought, the roads were back in pri
vate hands.
The same union officials who pushed
the demands of the 2.000,000 railroad
employes earlier in the year handled
the presentation of the short line road
employes case. President Timothy
O'Shea, of the Brotherhood of Loco
motive Firemen, President L. E. Shep
pard of the Brotherhood of Railroad
Conductors, and B. M. Jewell, Presi
dnt of the roalroad shopmen's union,
were chief counsel for the short line
road employes.
Demands sought by the short line
workers," if granted; would mean an
approximate annual pay increase in
100,000 pay envelopes of $50,000,000, it
is estimated.
