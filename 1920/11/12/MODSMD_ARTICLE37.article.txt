# HIGH CLASS SPIRITS DO NOT USE OUIJA
## 
### 
CHICAGO, Nov. 12. If you would
mingle with the elite of departed
spirits, do not toy with the shades of
those who use the ouija boards as
means of coummunication, because,
under ordinary circumstances, only
the riffraff of spiritdom speak during
sessions of the great American parlor
game, was the warning given today
by Miss Gail Wilson, trustee of the
American section of the Theosophical
Society. She stands high in the coun
cils of the theosophical world.
"Only the low type of soul would
make itself manifest on the ouija
board," said Miss Wilson, who has
given the subject much research. "A
high type of spirit would not use such
a crude and dangerous method. Why
should a highly evolved spirit want to
mingle among earth-beings when they
are on a much higher plane.
"Speaking in the slangy language
of the earth, most of the spirits we
get connected with on the ouija board
lie like circus posters.
"If you are looking for advice, it
is far better to take it from a good
living person than a bad dead one.
No spirit can tell the future better
than an ordinary earthbeing. It's rare
that a respectable spirit raps on the
library table, either."
Miss Wilson holds that there are
just a few cases on record of high
class spirits talking via the ouija
board route, but these' cases are so
rare that they may be discounted.
