AN APPEAL FOR CREW
Newspapers recently have stated that
Stan for dis dropping crew as an inter
collegiate sport. As a Stanford man and
ex-crew participant I wish to voice my
protest an dadd that of hundreds of
other Stanford men who, I know, will
resent such a move.
Since 1909 Stanford maintained row
ing despite its costliness and lack of
convenient training quarters. There was
never a lack of loyal adherents. Foot
ball was the sole support of practically
all other branches of athletic activity;
even baseball did> not support itself
until about 1914. The same condition
probably exists today, and football is
surely no less a profit-maker than it was
: eight years ago.
1 f it is not lack of financial support,
why cannot crew continue? You men
of '21, '22, '23 and '24 are as numerous
and as well equipped as they were a
decade ago. You have better rowing
[ facilities, quicker means of getting to
ilie bay and hack. Surely, there must
J>e some real reason for such a drastic
move. The fact that Stanford crews
! have not been winning crews the past
; year or two should only lead to greater
! exertion, longer training and better
1 support. Instead, we in the outside world
I are simply told "Stanford will drop
i crew." To put it mildly, it does not
1 savor of the real Stanford spirit.
| If the student body cannot and the
athletic treasury will not provide for
j intercollegiate rowing, we on the outside
I should be asked to come to the rescue.
; There arc many besides myself who will
gladly give so that Stanford crews may
| continue to "proudly sweep the water
| and give the Blue and Gold our wash.'
Don't let crew die.
