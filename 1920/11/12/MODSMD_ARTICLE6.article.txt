Kindly permit us through your <g>
columns to' sincerely thank Coach
' Powell and every fellow who ~
® played football in San Jose yes- "f
<$> terday. We realize you did not *
<§> have a holiday and your trip was
<3> made at considerable sacrifice and <S>
4, that under the conditions you had <§>
<§> not a chance to win. To have
. saved us the embarrassment of ~
; failing to give the public footbail
\ which had been advertised, was
; an act of true sportsmanship. It <§>
was Stanford spirit exemplified. <$>
"" November 20th is soon to be here ...
and we wish you every success.
