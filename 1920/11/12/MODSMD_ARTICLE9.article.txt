# VARSITY SOCCER GAME SATURDAY CALLED OFF
## 
### 
Stanford's soccer team will not play
this coming Saturday as was planned,
since the game scheduled with the Chi
nese Y. M. C. A. has been callcd off on
account of the Soccer League meeting
in San Francisco. The game as sched
uled would have given the Cardinal
team a good workout for the game wiln
California which comes off on the 20th.
The dope was for Stanford to win this
week-end. as the local soccerites have
been showing good form lately.
The team is now at the head of the
league as the result of three straight
victories, and chances for copping the
big struggle with California are good.
Captain Harvey Newland's team beat
the Olympic squad last Saturday, and
the Olympics had already defeated
California, so anyone with a mania for
figuring out the dope has something
very encouraging to go on. The Cali
fornia game will be played at Berkeley
at 10 o'clock the morning of the 20tli.
