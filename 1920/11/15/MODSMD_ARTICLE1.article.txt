# PROTEST SENT TO WOMEN'S COUNCIL BY ROBLE HALL
## Pictorial Story on Smoking Brings Complaints From Hall Committee of Five 
### 
Women's Council will act today upon
a resolution presented to it by the Com
mittee of Five, an executive committee
of Hall women, who were authorized at
a spccial Roble meeting last Saturday
to draw up a resolution of protest
against an article by Miss Florence
Hocking, '22, first appearing in the Pic
torial, a-student publication, and from
which liberal excerpts were reprinted in
all the San Francisco newspapers.
The letter to Council is as follows:
"To the Women's Council:
"We, the undersigned, as ap
pointed by Roble Hall, wish to regis
ter a protest 'igainst the article in
the November issue of the Pictorial
t entitled, "Where There Is So Much
Smoke," by Miss Florence Flocking.
"We object to it on the following
grounds:
"(1) It is based on hearsay and
rumors,
"(2) All charges have been exag
gerated and tend to give the outside
world an erroneous impression of
the Stanford women.
"(3) It is disloyal to the Univer
sity as a whole, insulting to the
University women, and particularly
to the freshman class.
"(4) The reference to the stains
of the deadly nicotine oij the fingers
and countenances of the co-cds is
so untrue that it is ridiculous. Most
stains on fingers may be attributed
to the practice of working in chem
istry laboratory or some workaday
place.
"(5) The advice to do 'our smok
ing on the q-t' is contrary to the
University policy.
"(6) The whole article contra
dicts itself, yet it has given the Uni
versity such unpleasant publicity
that we feel some statement or pro
test should be made in behalf of
the Stanford women. The wide
spread notoriety which this article
will briti'* upon the University will
be ind'\ ted by the manifold in
quirie: sent to the Dean of Women
by parents of the present and future
'five hundred.'
"Council is the logical body to
take this action.
"if this article is based on facts
a - ul the author has the true welfare
of Stanford at heart, we wish that
she would place her data before re
sponsible persons, so . that the
charges may be investigated and the
fault corrected. This should be done
in a quiet manner that will not re
fiect on the women as a whole. We
wonder ii the author is not seeking
publicity at the expense on the Uni
versity.
"In sincere protest.
"THF COMMITTEE OF FIVE,
"ROBLE HALL."
