# ART' WILCOX WILL GIVE DOPE ON BIG GAME TO FRESHMEN
## 
### 
J>y what score will the Varsity win
the Big Game? Capiain Art Wilcox,
'21, will answer that question at this
evening's rally for freshmen. The meet
ing to be held in the Assembly Hall at
7:30 is one of the series of Stanford
Standards conducted by the student
body.
The inside of the latest football dope
will be related by the Varsity captain
and the condition of the Cardinal squad
in comparison with the Bruin eleven
will be discussed. Wilcox will explain
first year athletics to the freshmen. The
close of the frosh football season makes
a discussion of the winter sports timely
before active training begins.
Non-athletic activities and the possi
bilities they hold to first year men and
women desiring to participate in student
body activities, will be treated by
William F. Leiser, '21. Leiser as asso
ciate editor of the Daily Palo Alto and
veteran JofTre debater is well qualified to
explain the machinery and purpose of
the various non-athletic activities.
Paul F. Erickson, '21, president of
the Men's Council, will discuss student
control in its relations particularly to
new students. While the Senior Class
is popularly understood to have direct
responsibility for the student control
system, the freshmen have a definite
part in determining whether student
control is a success or failure. The
council president will explain this rela
tion and outline what the upperclassmen
are expecting the new students to do in
aiding student control as adopted by
Stanford last year.
