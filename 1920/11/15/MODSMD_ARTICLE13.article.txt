# DANCE AT FAIRMONT FOLLOWING BIG GAME IS TO BE INFORMAL
## 
### 
Tickets for the Stanford dinner
dance at the Fairmont Hotel follow
ing the Big Game are selling fast to
alumni according to announcement
made this morning by J. E. McDowell,
alumni,secretary in charge of arrange
ments. McDowell announced that stu
dents desiring reservations for the
party should make immediate appli
cation before all are taken by the
alumni.
The Fairmont dance will be strictly
informal according to McDowell, and
those attending will wear the same
clothes worn at the game. There has
been a mistaken impression among
some students on the campus that the
dance would be formal.
