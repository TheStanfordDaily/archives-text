### HARRY J. BORBA, '22 
Fighting, backed to the wall and with a fourteen-point lead staring them
in the face, Stanford's freshman eleven turned California's attempted rout
into a real contest in the second quarter of the Junior big game, Saturday
afternoon. The Bruin Cubs invaded the Stanford campus with a classy ilrst
year team determined to swamp the Cardinal Babes. They won 38 to 7 but
they had to do battle lor every point they made and they fell short one
touchdown of shutting out the Stanford team.
Starting off with a bang, California put over two touchdowns within the
first ten minutes of play. Too much Nichols and Hodges told the story of
Stanford's Borrow in this period. After five minutes of scrimmage in the
center of the field Nichols, California halfback, broke away for a 25-yard run
around right end, placing the ball on Stanford's seven-yard line. Hodges, the
other half bucked the ball over from this point for the first score of the
afternoon.

California kicked and Hey returned
the kick to their twenty-yard line.
California made downs in the center
of the field. Nichols again broke
through the line for twenty yards.
Not content with one twenty-yard gain
he made another around right end
carrying the ball to the shadow of
Stanford's goal, where Hodges again
finished the job by bucking the ball
over. The score at this point was
14 to 0 in California's favor.
Woodward ran the Bruin kick-off
back fifteen yards. Stanford made
first downs near the center of the field
and then cracked things wide open.
For the next few minutes the play
was over California's head, both liter
ally and figuratively. Woodward
snapped a beautiful pass to Slater
that netted 30 yards. The next pass
was intercepted by Nichols who ran
it back twenty yeards. A third pass
Woodward to Judy netted fifteen
yards. California took the ball on a
fumble and kicked out of danger.
Woodward fumbled the kick which
Siler recovered and started to run
back, but he was stopped dead by
Fuller.
The quarter ended with the ball on
Stanford's forty-yard line. Here the
Cardinal Babes got the ball on downs.
Quarterback Woodward then began
his aerial attack in earnest. A throw
Woodward to Slater netted twelve
yards. Fuller was the next recipient
of a pass netting thirty yards. Full
back Hey essayed a pass to Judy and
was successful, gaining twenty more

yards. Stanford looked particularly
dangerous at this point but an inter
cepted pass allowed California ao kick
out of danger. Woodward lost the
kick on the Stanford 30-yard line, and
for a moment it appeared as if Siler
would break into the scoring column
but Judy downed him after ho had
gone twelve yards.
California tried two bucks and a
pass without making any headway.
On the fourth down a place kick exe
cuted by Nichols from the twenty
yard mark netted three more points.
Slater ran the California kick back
twelve yards. California was penal
ized twenty yards for roughing him as
he was taking a pass. Woodward
passed thirty yards to Judy who went
the next twenty 'yards through a
broken field eluding Nichols who was
set to get him, and scored Stanford's
only touchdown. Woodward con
verted.
California kicked to Woodward who
came back twenty yards before he
was downed. Hey went around right
end for fifteen yard!, Woodward ne
gotiated left end for eight yards more.
"Dummy" Wells' outfit bucked up and
refused to permit any more gains
around the ends so Stanford revei'ted
to aerial play again. A double pass
netted the Cardinal more yai;ds. Cali
fornia was penalized heavily for
roughing Woodward on a catch. Two
more passes placed the ball on Cali
fornia's ten-yard line. Here Stan
ford made a mistake in trying to buck
