# CARDINAL BABES FIGHT DESPERATELY BUT LOSE TO CALIFORNIA CUBS ON MUDDY FIELD BY SCORE OF 38 TO 7
## Forward Pass, Woodward To Judy, Nets Touchdown 
### HARRY J. BORBA, '22 
Fighting, backed to the wall and with a fourteen-point lead staring them
in the face, Stanford's freshman eleven turned California's attempted rout
into a real contest in the second quarter of the Junior big game, Saturday
afternoon. The Bruin Cubs invaded the Stanford campus with a classy ilrst
year team determined to swamp the Cardinal Babes. They won 38 to 7 but
they had to do battle lor every point they made and they fell short one
touchdown of shutting out the Stanford team.
Starting off with a bang, California put over two touchdowns within the
first ten minutes of play. Too much Nichols and Hodges told the story of
Stanford's Borrow in this period. After five minutes of scrimmage in the
center of the field Nichols, California halfback, broke away for a 25-yard run
around right end, placing the ball on Stanford's seven-yard line. Hodges, the
other half bucked the ball over from this point for the first score of the
afternoon.

California kicked and Hey returned
the kick to their twenty-yard line.
California made downs in the center
of the field. Nichols again broke
through the line for twenty yards.
Not content with one twenty-yard gain
he made another around right end
carrying the ball to the shadow of
Stanford's goal, where Hodges again
finished the job by bucking the ball
over. The score at this point was
14 to 0 in California's favor.
Woodward ran the Bruin kick-off
back fifteen yards. Stanford made
first downs near the center of the field
and then cracked things wide open.
For the next few minutes the play
was over California's head, both liter
ally and figuratively. Woodward
snapped a beautiful pass to Slater
that netted 30 yards. The next pass
was intercepted by Nichols who ran
it back twenty yeards. A third pass
Woodward to Judy netted fifteen
yards. California took the ball on a
fumble and kicked out of danger.
Woodward fumbled the kick which
Siler recovered and started to run
back, but he was stopped dead by
Fuller.
The quarter ended with the ball on
Stanford's forty-yard line. Here the
Cardinal Babes got the ball on downs.
Quarterback Woodward then began
his aerial attack in earnest. A throw
Woodward to Slater netted twelve
yards. Fuller was the next recipient
of a pass netting thirty yards. Full
back Hey essayed a pass to Judy and
was successful, gaining twenty more

yards. Stanford looked particularly
dangerous at this point but an inter
cepted pass allowed California ao kick
out of danger. Woodward lost the
kick on the Stanford 30-yard line, and
for a moment it appeared as if Siler
would break into the scoring column
but Judy downed him after ho had
gone twelve yards.
California tried two bucks and a
pass without making any headway.
On the fourth down a place kick exe
cuted by Nichols from the twenty
yard mark netted three more points.
Slater ran the California kick back
twelve yards. California was penal
ized twenty yards for roughing him as
he was taking a pass. Woodward
passed thirty yards to Judy who went
the next twenty 'yards through a
broken field eluding Nichols who was
set to get him, and scored Stanford's
only touchdown. Woodward con
verted.
California kicked to Woodward who
came back twenty yards before he
was downed. Hey went around right
end for fifteen yard!, Woodward ne
gotiated left end for eight yards more.
"Dummy" Wells' outfit bucked up and
refused to permit any more gains
around the ends so Stanford revei'ted
to aerial play again. A double pass
netted the Cardinal more yai;ds. Cali
fornia was penalized heavily for
roughing Woodward on a catch. Two
more passes placed the ball on Cali
fornia's ten-yard line. Here Stan
ford made a mistake in trying to buck
the California line insteady of trying
the ends or risking another pass.
Three times they bucked, and were
piled up. A pass on the fourth down
was intercepted and California punted
forty yards out of danger.
The score at half time was 17 to
7 against Stanford .
Thus ended Stanford's last chance
to put the ball over. They certainly
scared the Bruin tossers and outshone
them in every department of the
game during this period.
The last half was a repetition of
the first quarter. California making
long gains on end run plays and then
pushing the ball over by line buck
ing. Captain Witter, California full
back broke into the hall of fame with
a twenty-yards run and Hodges
plunged over again making the score
24 to 7. Hodges then finished his
day's work by staging a twenty-five
yard run and then plunging over for
his fourth touchdown.
At this point Seay sent Scofield in
to replace Fuller. Woodward passed
three times to Scofield who- over-ran
them each time.
Nichols took the ball through for
twenty yards on California's next play.
The first successful pass of the Bruins,
Dunn to O'Brien netted tfelve more.
Dunn then went around end for a
touchdown, making the score 38 to 7.
Nichols and Hodges were the stars
for the Bruin Babes. Four times
Nichols placed the ball in a position
of jeopardy for Stanford, and four
times Hodges bucked the ball over.
Judy was the particular light of
the Stanford team. His twenty-yard
run after receiving Woodward's thirty
yard pass was the most sensational
play of the day. Woodward with his
passing threatened Judy's honors but
several unfortunate fumbles caused
doubtless by the roughing he receiv
ed at the hands of the California
backs detracted from his brilliant
tossing. All of the Stanford backs
played brilliant ball. Hey made gain
after gain around the California ends
and "Scotchy" Campbell messed up
many an attempt of the Bruins.
A great deal of the credit for Stan
ford's showing goes to Qoach Duffy
Seay. The Babes showed the effects of
Seay's teachings of the past two weeks,
and despite the fact that they were out
classed they played a brilliant game of
football.
