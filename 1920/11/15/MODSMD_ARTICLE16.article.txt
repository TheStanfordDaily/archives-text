# STANFORD FRESHMEN PLAY DRAW WITH U.C. IN SOCCER GAME
## 
### 
Stanford's Freshman soccer team held
the California Babes to a 3-3 tic in' a
bitterly contested game played on the
Stanford reserve turf Saturday morn
ing. Rainy weather put the field in bad
shape and handicapped the players, but
despite this the game was snappily
played.
California opened up with a rushing
style of play that gained them a goal,
but Stanford rallied and tied the score
before the half was over, Swayne scor
ing the goal. Coming back with a rush,
the Blue and Gold men upset the Stan
ford ranks with two goals in quick suc
cession, and it was not until Coach Ma
loney made several shifts in the lineup
that the opposing rush was stopped.
From this point on the Stanford Babes
fought desperately, and helped especially
by some good shooting on the part of
Menees, put over two goals and tied the
score. The deadlock was not broken
before the final whistle, and the score
ended in a 3-3 knot. The most consistent
