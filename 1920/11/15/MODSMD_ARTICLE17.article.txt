# POLITICAL ISSUES TO BE FEATURE OF NEXT 'CARDINAL'
## 
### 
"After March 4th, What?" is the
enigmatic title of a series of articles
in the November Cardinal which fore
casts the political horoscope of the
Harding administration. The forth
coming issue, to be placed on sale during
the latter part of the week, contains the
only after-election dope story published
in any campus magazine this month.
David Starr Jordan contributes to the
series in an article entitled "The Polit
ical Outlook." A searching analysis of
present-day conditions is made by the
Chancellor as the basis of determining
what is likely to occur after the inaugu
ration of Harding. "What Will Not Hap
pen After March 4" might more prop
erly be the title of the article of Pro
fessor W. G. Beach, who is not optim
istic over the elevation to power of cer
tain interests inimical to social welfare.
Professors M. S. Wildman and E. A.
Cottrell forecast the next four yeais
from the economic and political aspects.
A notable addition is made in the cur
rent issue to the series of overseas arti
cles published last year by the Cardinal.
The New York Evening Post and other
Eastern journals published many of the
Cardinal articles as representative of
American experience in the war. In
"Mummies of St. Michel," contained in
the November number, a new and un
usual angle of overseas life is pre
sented. George Hall has illustrated this
subtle piece of "doughboy" experience.
