# STANFORD RUGGERS COME FROM BEHIND AND DOWN MODESTO
## 
### 
With the score 5-0 against them in
the early part of the second half, Couth
Harry Maloney's rugby men took a
brace and came out on the long end of
a 6-5 count in the Stanford-Modesto
game Saturday on the latter's field. A
much stronger team ran out on the field
than the one which faced the Cardinal
ruggers the week before in the first
game between Stanford and Modesto.
Several thousand fans were crowded
around the field, confident that their
local team would down the invaders.
The first half ended with the score
()-(). Each team had had several chances
to score, but good defensive work had
prevented the ball crossing the line.
With the opening of the second half,
Modesto took the ball down the field
with short rushes, and finally went over.
Hudelson, the "Dink" Templeton of Mo
desto, converted. Stanford rallied and.
with the ball within striking distance of
the goal, Comstock plunged over. Moore
failed to convert.
At the kick-off the Cardinal started
on another trip to the Modesto line, and
notwithstanding the desperate efforts of
the high school lads to stem the tide,
want over the line for the second touch
down, Holstein carrying the ball.
Moore failed to convert from a difficult
angle.
The Cardinal backfield was consid
erably slowed up on account of the soft
field, but acted as a strong defense
against the Modesto rushes.
Coach Maloney is trying lo arrange
a game with the Polytechnic High
School for some, time next week.
