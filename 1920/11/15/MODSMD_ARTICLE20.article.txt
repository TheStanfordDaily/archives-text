# WOMEN AND CIGARETTES

"Do they, or don't they ?" seems to be the question raised by the article,
"Where There Is So Much Smoke," by Miss Florence Hocking, which
appeared in the November issue of The Stanford Pictorial, and was
used in the city papers. Miss Hocking says that smoking and gambling
goes on amongst Stanford women, while, on the other hand, the women
of Roble Hall deny this in a protest sent to the Women's Council. Miss
Hocking's statement is borne out by information from other sources,
while equally reliable persons say that smoking is confined to a very
few Stanford women. Who are we going to believe?
The fury of the combined "500" is being turned loose on Miss
Hocking for the statements made in her story, and the women of Roble
Hall have asked the Women's Conference to take action.
There is no action that the Conference can take if the question is
one of fact and data. If Stanford women smoke and gamble they have
no complaint coming if the information is made public. It is unfortu
nate that the story has been given such wide publicity, as it will do
an irreparable harm to the name of the University, but that is the in
evitable consequence of violation of University rules. Smoking is not
a crime, but violating the law of the University makes it one, and if the
law is being broken the consequences must be accepted.
Miss Hocking's story warns the women that the practice of smoking
and gambling are not allowed here, and in her words, "You just can't
do it, friends. It doesn't get by." She presumably based her statements
on facts that she possessed. If her statements are untrue, the Confer
ence can take legitimate action. If they are true, the Conference can do
nothing. Its field of action will then be in attempting to eradicate the
evils in question.
