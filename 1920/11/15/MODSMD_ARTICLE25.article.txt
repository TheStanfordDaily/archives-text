Editor Daily Palo Alto:â€”
The cigarette and craps scandal
caught my attention as it did that of
hundreds of others in their perusal of
yesterday's San Francisco Examiner.
While agreeing heartily with Miss
Hocking's viewpoint, her method of at
tack is, in my opinion, decidedly in the
harmful publicity class.
You can not reform the co-ed by giv
ing her a black eye in public, especially
if you strike indiscriminately and hap
pen to hit the wrong co-ed. The article
has served to throw every Stanford
woman under suspicion by making the
cigarette habit the general rule instead
of the wayward exception. The gossipy
public is more than likely to consider
the "500" as typical of the regiment of
regular cigarette smokers who infest
local hotel tea rooms. From comment
I have already heard, I believe San
Francisco people will henceforth pic
ture the Stanford co-ed's life as one gay
round of Chesterfields.
It may be of interest to note that dur
ing all the time I was in college 1 never
saw a Stanford woman smoking a
cigarette. Moreover, 1 heard of only two
or three who were wont occasionally to
stray in the tobocco direction. How
ever, if the conditions described by Miss
Hocking exist now, correction could be
made quietly by an authorized person or
body much more efficiently thn by re
sorting to yellow journalism. Resotft
fully, JEAN FRICKELTON, W.-
