PLEASE ACCEPT OUR HUMBLEST
It turned out the other day that one
of our patient readers was the Sport
ing Editor of the "S. F. Call." We
found that out when he wrote the
"Daily," complaining that ye ed. had
roughly handled "Brick" Morse in one
of his comments in this column. —
Apologies are in order.
Our statement was to the effect that
Mr. Morse was trying to under-rate
the Stanford varsity. It is a fine
distinction but a true one when we
say that this statement of ours was
a misleading one. Mr. Morse's par
ticular brand of partisanship really is
not of that nature. It might lead him
to over-rate U. C. but not to disparage
Stanford's chances. Incidentally, how
ever, and following out Mr. Morse's
own style of making predictions, we
would like to predict that because of
his partisanship, Mr. Morse wins the
brown derby as a sports writer by
three touchdowns.

Make 'Em Wear Ground Grippers
That affable old lady, Dame Rumor,
has just let us in on a story that one
of our well-known sororities called a
meeting last week and passed a rul
ing compellnig its members, or at
least the sophomores in the house,
to keep both feet on the floor. It is
a sane ruling and one that will cut
down lots of business at the oculist's.

A well-known Orpheum act is one
that features the dances our grand
mother used to do. It just occurred to
us that if a similar act is put on fifty
years from now, there will be a lot
of nice old ladies in the audience who
will be blushing violently.

THIS SOUNDS FAMILIAR.
James Montague of "More Truth
Than Poetry Fame," broke into a well
known campus theme the other day.
This is his version of it:
A Cornell professor admits that
pretty girls get the best marks if they
vamp the tutors.
Dollie's marks are never off,
Her standing's always high,
For Dollie always vamps the prof
And that's how she gets by.
A little vamping now and then,
A sly and dimpled smirk,
Goes farther with these learned men
Than good hard honest work.
Dollie cannot write a theme,
She says they're awful stuff,
But Dollie is a little dream
And that's about enough.
The sternest profs will always brook
A world of ignorance
In gills who hand them out a look
Instinctive with romance.
1
If Dollie had a stolid face
And wore a sullen pout
She'd slump into her rightful place
And never could get out.
But girls who are not fair to see
And lack a pleasing wit,
Don't ever garner a degree
Unless they work for it.
So when to classes Dollie goes
She finds it well worth while,
To put some powder 011 her nose
And wear a witching smile.
This world is governed by romance,
And while all profs are male,
There'll never be the slightest chance
That Dollies ever'll fail.

After reading Saturday's "Chron
icle," which was filled up with an
account of the unholy activity of one
of our most popular sexes at Stanford
with the "Alabama Marbles," we have
come to the conclusion that a fitting
Christmas gift for a co-ed would bo a
pair of the vicious ivory cubes.
