SEATTLE. Wash., Nov. 15.â€”Sale of
hops, malt and other ingredients from
which home brew is made will not be
stopped in the State of Washington,
Prohibition Enforcement Officer Mc-

the moonshiners and bootleggers to keep
us more than busy." Unofficial reports

patches that prohibition enforcement
officers at Washington have ruled
against sales of malt and hops to other
