# QUICKWITTED MATRON IDENTIFIES WOULD-BE BURGLAR AT POMONA
## 
### 
The presence of mind of the Matron
of the Girl's Dormitory at Pomona
College, has probably saved the wo
men of the college about $500.00. The
Matron discovered a young man near
the electric light switch, just after
the hall was plunged into darkness.
He ran as she switched the light on,
but she was able in the brief glimpse
to identify him as the young man later
taken into custody at the College Inn.
The sum of money in his possession
vf ry nearly coincided with the amount
lost by the college women. He is be
ing held on a charge of pocket-picking
and suspicion of burglary.
