# FIRST MEETING OF ASSEMBLY OF THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS
## Fifty-Five Countries Represented 
### United Press 
GENEVA, Nov. 15.—Geneva, "cap
ital of the world," was crowded to ca
pacity today when representatives of
fifty-one nations from every corner of
the globe were gathered to attend the
first meeting of the assembly of the
League of Nations.
Of the forty-five powers mentioned in
the covenant of the league, forty-two
have already declared their allegiance to
the league and were expected to avail
themselves of their right to attend the
first assembly meeting. Thirteen others,
not named in the organic document,
have applied for admission and like'y
will have delegates on the ground.
The program to be followed at :!ie
meeting will probably be (1) hearing
reports of various commissions author
ized by the council of the league to in
vestigate international problems; (2)
discussion and adoption of rules of pro
cedure and examination of credentials
of delegates; (3) admission of states
not mentioned in covenant; (4) app™it
ment and ratification of certain com
missions named by the lca o ne council
to carry out provisions of the peace
treaty; (5) discussion of the relations
between the council and the assembly;
(6) report of Sir Eric Diummor.d on
the work of the .secretariat, discussion
and debate on the Root-Piuliniore world
court; and a score of othei important
questions relating to questions of health,
finance, alcohol, traffic in women and
children and the like.
Of the nations attending the Geneva
assembly meeting, eighteen, including
the five dominions of the British group,
derived their membership in the league
automatically through the coming into
effect of the Treaty of Versailles, Jan
uary 10, 1920. Eight other countries
ratified the pact later and are classified
as charter members. Thirteen nations,
neutrals in the world war, were invitei
to become members of the league and
have accepted and already been taken
into membership.
China, alone, derives her membership
by being a signatory to the Treaty of
St. Germain.
Eleven other states have applied for
membership, some of them having only
de facto governments. In addition, it is
believed Germany, Austria, Bulgana and
Hungary will make attempts to gain

admission to full fellowship among the
nations as exemplified in the league.
The only nations that will not be
represented at the first meeting of the
assembly, either officially or semi
officially, are the United States of
America, Mexico, Turkey and Russia.
The assembly will be called to order
at 11 o'clock by M. Paul Hymans of
Belgium. Later a permanent president
will be elected for the period of the
conference.
Advance information is that a num
ber of days will be required merely to
hear the reports of the various com
missions which have been autnerized by
the council to investigate international
questions. Delegates will be quartered at
Geneva's main hotels, and their office
work will be done in the league's new
capital, recently the National Hotel,
which was acquired by Sir Eric to take
care of the offices of the secretariat anJ
commissions.
Among the reports to be heard of
commissions named under provisions of
the treaty are: Appointment of three
members of the Saar Valley Boundary
Commission; the Saar Valley Govern
ing Commission; appointment of the
high commissioner of Dantzig and ap
proval of the constitution of the Free
City; responsibilities of the league aris
ing out of the distribution of mandates
and the enforcement of article XXII
(mandates); appointment of Dr. Frid
jof Nansen, arctic explorer, to investi
gate repatriation of ex-enemy prisoneis
from Russia and Germany to their re
spective homes; the Polish minority
treaty; the resolution regarding the ad
mission of Switzerland; the first and
sccond budgets of the league; relief in
Central Europe and methods of combat
ing typhus; report on the plebiscite in
Eupen and Malmedy.
Probably one of the most tick'fsh
problems the assembly will be called on
to settle is likely to be proposed to the
league by Peru, Chile and Bolivia. It is
the Tacna-Arica boundary controversy.
Both the Peruvians and Bolivians have
made known their intention of submitting
the question to the league for settle
ment. It is expected Chile will acquiesce.
Since the seventies the question of
who owns Tacna-Arica has worried
statesmen of South America. More
than once has war threatened, and in
fact Chile actually declared war on
Peru and in the Treaty of Ancon
gained possession of the disputed
province. A plebiscite was set for ten
years later (1883), but for several
reasons the will of the inhabitants was
never allowed to be expressed. Since
then a crisis has appeared on many
occasions, but, although no diplomatic
relations are maintained between Peru
and Chile, there has been no war.
Of most interest to the United States,
perhaps, in view of the failure of that
nation to enter the league, is the assem
bly's attitude toward the Root-Phillmore
International Court of Arbitration, pro
posed by a committee of world jurists
under guidance of Elihu Root, former
secretary of state under President
Roosevelt.
Inasmuch as several European nations
are opposed to the unlimited powers of
the court, as the United States is to the
unqualified article 10 of the covenant,
considerable debate is expected before
the court's constitution is finally ap
proved.
That the court will certainly be estab
lished is assured by action of the league
council in approving of the plan for
formulation of a permanent court of
international justice. Mainly the mooted
questions are what form it will take and
to what extent nations will adhere to its
decisions.

problems the assembly will be called on
to settle is likely to be proposed to the
league by Peru, Chile and Bolivia. It is
the Tacna-Arica boundary controversy.
Both the Peruvians and Bolivians have
made known their intention of submitting
the question to the league for settle
ment. It is expected Chile will acquiesce.
Since the seventies the question of
who owns Tacna-Arica has worried
statesmen of South America. More
than once has war threatened, and in
fact Chile actually declared war on
Peru and in the Treaty of Ancon
gained possession of the disputed
province. A plebiscite was set for ten
years later (1883), but for several
reasons the will of the inhabitants was
never allowed to be expressed. Since
then a crisis has appeared on many
occasions, but, although no diplomatic
relations are maintained between Peru
and Chile, there has been no war.
Of most interest to the United States,
perhaps, in view of the failure of that
nation to enter the league, is the assem
bly's attitude toward the Root-Phillmore
International Court of Arbitration, pro
posed by a committee of world jurists
under guidance of Elihu Root, former
secretary of state under President
Roosevelt.
Inasmuch as several European nations
are opposed to the unlimited powers of
the court, as the United States is to the
unqualified article 10 of the covenant,
considerable debate is expected before
the court's constitution is finally ap
proved.
That the court will certainly be estab
lished is assured by action of the league
council in approving of the plan for
formulation of a permanent court of
international justice. Mainly the mooted
questions are what form it will take and
to what extent nations will adhere to its
decisions.
GENEVA, Nov. 15.—Geneva, "cap
ital of the world," was crowded to ca
pacity today when representatives of
fifty-one nations from every corner of
the globe were gathered to attend the
first meeting of the assembly of the
League of Nations.
Of the forty-five powers mentioned in
the covenant of the league, forty-two
have already declared their allegiance to
the league and were expected to avail
themselves of their right to attend the
first assembly meeting. Thirteen others,
not named in the organic document,
have applied for admission and like'y
will have delegates on the ground.
The program to be followed at :!ie
meeting will probably be (1) hearing
reports of various commissions author
ized by the council of the league to in
vestigate international problems; (2)
discussion and adoption of rules of pro
cedure and examination of credentials
of delegates; (3) admission of states
not mentioned in covenant; (4) app™it
ment and ratification of certain com
missions named by the lca o ne council
to carry out provisions of the peace
treaty; (5) discussion of the relations
between the council and the assembly;
(6) report of Sir Eric Diummor.d on
the work of the .secretariat, discussion
and debate on the Root-Piuliniore world
court; and a score of othei important
questions relating to questions of health,
finance, alcohol, traffic in women and
children and the like.
Of the nations attending the Geneva
assembly meeting, eighteen, including
the five dominions of the British group,
derived their membership in the league
automatically through the coming into
effect of the Treaty of Versailles, Jan
uary 10, 1920. Eight other countries
ratified the pact later and are classified
as charter members. Thirteen nations,
neutrals in the world war, were invitei
to become members of the league and
have accepted and already been taken
into membership.
China, alone, derives her membership
by being a signatory to the Treaty of
St. Germain.
Eleven other states have applied for
membership, some of them having only
de facto governments. In addition, it is
believed Germany, Austria, Bulgana and
Hungary will make attempts to gain

admission to full fellowship among the
nations as exemplified in the league.
The only nations that will not be
represented at the first meeting of the
assembly, either officially or semi
officially, are the United States of
America, Mexico, Turkey and Russia.
The assembly will be called to order
at 11 o'clock by M. Paul Hymans of
Belgium. Later a permanent president
will be elected for the period of the
conference.
Advance information is that a num
ber of days will be required merely to
hear the reports of the various com
missions which have been autnerized by
the council to investigate international
questions. Delegates will be quartered at
Geneva's main hotels, and their office
work will be done in the league's new
capital, recently the National Hotel,
which was acquired by Sir Eric to take
care of the offices of the secretariat anJ
commissions.
Among the reports to be heard of
commissions named under provisions of
the treaty are: Appointment of three
members of the Saar Valley Boundary
Commission; the Saar Valley Govern
ing Commission; appointment of the
high commissioner of Dantzig and ap
proval of the constitution of the Free
City; responsibilities of the league aris
ing out of the distribution of mandates
and the enforcement of article XXII
(mandates); appointment of Dr. Frid
jof Nansen, arctic explorer, to investi
gate repatriation of ex-enemy prisoneis
from Russia and Germany to their re
spective homes; the Polish minority
treaty; the resolution regarding the ad
mission of Switzerland; the first and
sccond budgets of the league; relief in
Central Europe and methods of combat
ing typhus; report on the plebiscite in
Eupen and Malmedy.

nations as exemplified in the league.
The only nations that will not be
represented at the first meeting of the
assembly, either officially or semi
officially, are the United States of
America, Mexico, Turkey and Russia.
The assembly will be called to order
at 11 o'clock by M. Paul Hymans of
Belgium. Later a permanent president
will be elected for the period of the
conference.
Advance information is that a num
ber of days will be required merely to
hear the reports of the various com
missions which have been autnerized by
the council to investigate international
questions. Delegates will be quartered at
Geneva's main hotels, and their office
work will be done in the league's new
capital, recently the National Hotel,
which was acquired by Sir Eric to take
care of the offices of the secretariat anJ
commissions.
Among the reports to be heard of
commissions named under provisions of
the treaty are: Appointment of three
members of the Saar Valley Boundary
Commission; the Saar Valley Govern
ing Commission; appointment of the
high commissioner of Dantzig and ap
proval of the constitution of the Free
City; responsibilities of the league aris
ing out of the distribution of mandates
and the enforcement of article XXII
(mandates); appointment of Dr. Frid
jof Nansen, arctic explorer, to investi
gate repatriation of ex-enemy prisoneis
from Russia and Germany to their re
spective homes; the Polish minority
treaty; the resolution regarding the ad
mission of Switzerland; the first and
sccond budgets of the league; relief in
Central Europe and methods of combat
ing typhus; report on the plebiscite in
Eupen and Malmedy.
Probably one of the most tick'fsh
problems the assembly will be called on
to settle is likely to be proposed to the
league by Peru, Chile and Bolivia. It is
the Tacna-Arica boundary controversy.
Both the Peruvians and Bolivians have
made known their intention of submitting
the question to the league for settle
ment. It is expected Chile will acquiesce.
Since the seventies the question of
who owns Tacna-Arica has worried
statesmen of South America. More
than once has war threatened, and in
fact Chile actually declared war on
Peru and in the Treaty of Ancon
gained possession of the disputed
province. A plebiscite was set for ten
years later (1883), but for several
reasons the will of the inhabitants was
never allowed to be expressed. Since
then a crisis has appeared on many
occasions, but, although no diplomatic
relations are maintained between Peru
and Chile, there has been no war.
Of most interest to the United States,
perhaps, in view of the failure of that
nation to enter the league, is the assem
bly's attitude toward the Root-Phillmore
International Court of Arbitration, pro
posed by a committee of world jurists
under guidance of Elihu Root, former
secretary of state under President
Roosevelt.
Inasmuch as several European nations
are opposed to the unlimited powers of
the court, as the United States is to the
unqualified article 10 of the covenant,
considerable debate is expected before
the court's constitution is finally ap
proved.
That the court will certainly be estab
lished is assured by action of the league
council in approving of the plan for
formulation of a permanent court of
international justice. Mainly the mooted
questions are what form it will take and
to what extent nations will adhere to its
decisions.
GENEVA, Nov. 15.—Geneva, "cap
ital of the world," was crowded to ca
pacity today when representatives of
fifty-one nations from every corner of
the globe were gathered to attend the
first meeting of the assembly of the
League of Nations.
Of the forty-five powers mentioned in
the covenant of the league, forty-two
have already declared their allegiance to
the league and were expected to avail
themselves of their right to attend the
first assembly meeting. Thirteen others,
not named in the organic document,
have applied for admission and like'y
will have delegates on the ground.
The program to be followed at :!ie
meeting will probably be (1) hearing
reports of various commissions author
ized by the council of the league to in
vestigate international problems; (2)
discussion and adoption of rules of pro
cedure and examination of credentials
of delegates; (3) admission of states
not mentioned in covenant; (4) app™it
ment and ratification of certain com
missions named by the lca o ne council
to carry out provisions of the peace
treaty; (5) discussion of the relations
between the council and the assembly;
(6) report of Sir Eric Diummor.d on
the work of the .secretariat, discussion
and debate on the Root-Piuliniore world
court; and a score of othei important
questions relating to questions of health,
finance, alcohol, traffic in women and
children and the like.
Of the nations attending the Geneva
assembly meeting, eighteen, including
the five dominions of the British group,
derived their membership in the league
automatically through the coming into
effect of the Treaty of Versailles, Jan
uary 10, 1920. Eight other countries
ratified the pact later and are classified
as charter members. Thirteen nations,
neutrals in the world war, were invitei
to become members of the league and
have accepted and already been taken
into membership.
China, alone, derives her membership
by being a signatory to the Treaty of
St. Germain.
Eleven other states have applied for
membership, some of them having only
de facto governments. In addition, it is
believed Germany, Austria, Bulgana and
Hungary will make attempts to gain

admission to full fellowship among the
nations as exemplified in the league.
The only nations that will not be
represented at the first meeting of the
assembly, either officially or semi
officially, are the United States of
America, Mexico, Turkey and Russia.
