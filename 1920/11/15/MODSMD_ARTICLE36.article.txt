# LONDON ARTISTS FORM NEW CLUB; NAMED 'TUBISTS'
## 
### United Press 
LONDON, Oct. 15 (By Mail).—A
new group of artists is forming in Lon
don and they call themselves the "Tub
ists."
A picture painted for advertising pur
poses by Mr. C. R. W. Nevinson, the
famous artist, failed to pass the
Underground Railways' official censor,
who is responsible for all those adver
tising posters which hedeck the plat
forms and carriages. The censor's job is
to see that the advertising designs shall
give no nasty shocks to the moral system
of all those provincial grannies and
country cousins who have occasion to
travel on the subways.
Nevinson's picture was intended to
advertise a new play which was re
cently produced by Miss Viola Tree,
entitled "The Unknown." This play
deals with post-war religious controversy
and the poster advertisement depicted a
crucifixion—but the. figure on the cross,
though somewhat vague and undefined,
was undoubtedly that a nude woman.
"No," said the Underground Railways'
official censor, "this cannot be - " and
Nev :- ison's picture was banned from
"tubes," as the subways here
are "lied.
Such a wealth of coloring and so
nuich good taste is exercised in keeping
the "tubes" decorative, that the plat
forms and passages have become known
as "the people's favorite picture gal
lery."
Hence the "Tubists," who in their new
school are vying with each other to suc
ceed in satisfying the censor and "re
main artistic nevertheless."
