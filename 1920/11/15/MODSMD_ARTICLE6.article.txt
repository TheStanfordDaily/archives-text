### Floyd L. McElroy 
(President Associated Students)
Some time ago the Board of Ath
letic Control drew up plans for the
construction of. a temporary basket
ball pavilion to cost approximately
$15,000>, and appropriated $7,500 in the
1921 budget for that purpose. The
plan was discussed with the Universi
ty authorities who objected to it on
' the ground that (1) temporary struc
tures have proven a failure and an j
eyesore to the University; for it is
only a matter of a few years until j
they are useless and have to be torn j
down or moved away, (2) the policy
of the University is to build perma
nent and substantial structures when
improvements are made.
Toward a permanent pavilion the
Board of Trustees offer to advance a
loan to cover the cost of construction,
but this money will have to be paid
back with interest for the Trustees
will have to convert endowment in- [
vestments ihto a loan to the Board
of Athletic Control since all of the;
University current income is being
1 used to maintain the upkeep of the i
institution. The Board of Athletic
Control is not in a position to meet
both principal and interest on such a
loan. The members of the Associ- j
ated Students of the Board of Ath
letic Control, at the last meeting real
j izinc ihe urgent neod for such a pn-
I vilion, suggested to tho Board that
probably the students would be will- j
ing to help finance the scheme by tax- j
1 inf Miemselves enough to pay the in-,
! terest on the lyan. At that moment
Br. Wilbur spolco up and made the
' whole plan possible by an offer of
$2500 a year to bo taken from the
, President's budget. Comptroller Roth
made a similar offer so that we were
assured of at least $5000 a year from j

the University. The Board of Ath
letic Control offered $7,500 a year.
It then rested with the students on
the Board to express the sentiment
of the student body. They said that
they would take the matter before the
students to see if they wouldr be will
ing to tax themselves $1.00 per quarter
to pay the interest and a small amount
toward the principal each year until
the loan is paid back to the Trus
tees. The loan will be not less than
$75,000 at 5 or 6"per cent interest.
It will take the Student Body about
four yeas and a half to pay their full
share toward this new building.
Proposed Building is Described
The plans for the new structure are
for a combined basketball and dance
hall pavilion. It is the largest of its
kind in any university in the country,
having a seating capacity of 3000 with
a floor ppaco larger than that of the
present gymnasium. The front ent
rance will be to a large lobby with
spacious men's and women's cloak
rooms on each side. To one sido of
the building is attached a complete
kitchen for preparing and serving of
dinners at dance affairs. Tliero will
be a hard wood spring floor modeled
after those of the popular hotels in
San Francisco, so that the best of j
