# Students Will Ballot on New Basketball Pavilion Wednesday
## 
### Floyd L. McElroy 
(President Associated Students)
Some time ago the Board of Ath
letic Control drew up plans for the
construction of. a temporary basket
ball pavilion to cost approximately
$15,000>, and appropriated $7,500 in the
1921 budget for that purpose. The
plan was discussed with the Universi
ty authorities who objected to it on
' the ground that (1) temporary struc
tures have proven a failure and an j
eyesore to the University; for it is
only a matter of a few years until j
they are useless and have to be torn j
down or moved away, (2) the policy
of the University is to build perma
nent and substantial structures when
improvements are made.
Toward a permanent pavilion the
Board of Trustees offer to advance a
loan to cover the cost of construction,
but this money will have to be paid
back with interest for the Trustees
will have to convert endowment in- [
vestments ihto a loan to the Board
of Athletic Control since all of the;
University current income is being
1 used to maintain the upkeep of the i
institution. The Board of Athletic
Control is not in a position to meet
both principal and interest on such a
loan. The members of the Associ- j
ated Students of the Board of Ath
letic Control, at the last meeting real
j izinc ihe urgent neod for such a pn-
I vilion, suggested to tho Board that
probably the students would be will- j
ing to help finance the scheme by tax- j
1 inf Miemselves enough to pay the in-,
! terest on the lyan. At that moment
Br. Wilbur spolco up and made the
' whole plan possible by an offer of
$2500 a year to bo taken from the
, President's budget. Comptroller Roth
made a similar offer so that we were
assured of at least $5000 a year from j

the University. The Board of Ath
letic Control offered $7,500 a year.
It then rested with the students on
the Board to express the sentiment
of the student body. They said that
they would take the matter before the
students to see if they wouldr be will
ing to tax themselves $1.00 per quarter
to pay the interest and a small amount
toward the principal each year until
the loan is paid back to the Trus
tees. The loan will be not less than
$75,000 at 5 or 6"per cent interest.
It will take the Student Body about
four yeas and a half to pay their full
share toward this new building.
Proposed Building is Described
The plans for the new structure are
for a combined basketball and dance
hall pavilion. It is the largest of its
kind in any university in the country,
having a seating capacity of 3000 with
a floor ppaco larger than that of the
present gymnasium. The front ent
rance will be to a large lobby with
spacious men's and women's cloak
rooms on each side. To one sido of
the building is attached a complete
kitchen for preparing and serving of
dinners at dance affairs. Tliero will
be a hard wood spring floor modeled
after those of the popular hotels in
San Francisco, so that the best of j
dancing facilities are assuder.
Faults in the Present Situation
The present floor is laid on a con
crete base which is very detrimental
to the best physical condition of the
basketball players, and especially the
men whom we rely upon for points
in the track season. Since there are
some thousand students taking physic
al exercise in the gymnasium every
week, it is so congested that the
varsity teams are forced to give up
practice during a groat part of the
time when it is essential, and of they
use the floor it is to the detriment
of boxing, handball, and basketball
classes which are held on the floor
every day. Last year forty-six intra
mural basketball teams forced the
vKrsity basketball team to do most
of its practacing at night. The new
pavilion provides three basketball
courts and plenty of room for varsity
practice.
This scheme does riot present a
question between Crew or a Basket
ball pavilion. Crew has been dropped
temporarily for lack of funds. This
money has been promised for the
Dance and Basketball Pavilion. Crew
is a constant outlay of funds with ab
solutely no financial returns. Crew
should be taken up again just as soon
as certain income from some other
source is at hand to finance it. This
pavilion is an investment wihch will
net a constant steady income to the
Board of Athletic Control. The in
come will be from gate-receipts from
basketball games, boxing matches,
etc., and from rentals for class and
student body dances like the Cotillion,
Junior Prom, Senior Ball, etc. This
income might be sufficient to finance
crew to a large extent. The building
could be finished by the middle of the
spring quarter, so that a steady in
come is assured next year.
This plan is now before the associ
ated students for their approval. If
they turn it down no more action will
betaken and we will continue to use
our inadequate and cramped facilities.
If they accept the burden of a small
tax it will not only manifest a splen
did spirit of co-operation between the
faculty, alumni and students for a
common progress at Stanford, but it
will give to the great bulk of the men
athletically inclined an adequate place
to train; to those who enjoy dancing
on the campus it promises a spring
floor to be compared only with those
of the St. Francis, Fairmont and the
Palace hotels; to those who enjoy
watching the fascinating sports of
boxing or basketball, there will always
be plenty of comfortable seats. It is
evident that such a pavilion will give
the greatest good to the greatest num
ber. It will not interfere with the
earliest consummation of any of the
other structural improvements which
are in the minds of Stanford men at
the present time.
I believe that the student body will
deem it a privilege to co-operate with
the faculty and alumni, in erecting
for Stanford such a practical perma
nent improvement. The students will
undoubtedly cast a great majority vote
in favor of the new plan.
