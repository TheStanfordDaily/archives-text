### United Press 
CONSTANTINOPLE, Nov. 15.—
Sebastopol is today the center of wild
rioting and confusion. The harbor is
filled with watercraft of all sizes vary
ing from war vessels to rowboats, all
carrying refugees from the approach
ing Red invasion.
General Wrangel's army was in a
panic and his strength seejned to have
utterly collapsed as the conquering
Bolsheviki troops swept southward onto
the city. Dispatches here reported that
Bolsheviki leaders admit the loss of
30,000 men in hand-to-hand fighting at
Perkop, while White Guards were prac
{ically wiped out in a fierce effort to
defend the narrow neck of the penin
sula.
The Russian coast of the Black Sea
is blockaded and British torpedo boats
have started patroling to prevent the
Bolsheviki troops from spreading into
Turkey on their march of invasion and
destruction. The collapse of General
Wrangel's army is believed to be due
to the overwhelming superiority of num
*l)er#of the Bolshevik, coupled with the
fact that the Reds are led by capable
and clever officers, some of whom are
reported to be foreigners.
It is reported that Czaristic plotters in
General Wrangel's forces have de
moralized his army with their schemes
for the seizure of the government.
