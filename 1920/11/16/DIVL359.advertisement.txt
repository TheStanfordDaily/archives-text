Poor weather conditions have
not hindered the willing work of
the freshmen who have been out
to help construct the bonfire. But
there are a majority of Hall, Row
and Palo Alto freshmen who have
not yet turned Out.
Frosh, this is your bonfire, and
is the best chance of the year to â€¢
show your class spirit in the
building of the biggest bonfire in
the history of the university.
Negligent freshmen desiring to
escape their rightful duties will
be investigated by a vigilant com
mittce.

BONFIRE COMMITTEE.
