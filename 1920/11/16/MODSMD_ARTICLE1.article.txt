With the Big Game nearly at hand,
Coach Powell is putting the finishing
touches on his men. With the exception
of several of the players on the injured
list the remainder of the squad is in the
best of shape. Pelouze and Deems are
now reporting for practice, but it is
still doubtful whether their feet will
permit them to enter the California con
test. The rest of the positions on the
team are nearly certain.
Righter will work in the center of the
line, with Cravens on his left and either
Levy or Deems on his right. Pershing
and McAlpine are ready to start at then
tackle positions. The ends are stiil
doubtful, with Pelouze on the injured
list and Adams and K. Schlaudeman
fighting for the* place at the other end
ot the line. R. Schlaudeman will call
