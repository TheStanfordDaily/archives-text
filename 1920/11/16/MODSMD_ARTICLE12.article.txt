# "WEDDING BELLS" WILL BE GIVEN BY SOPHOMORE CLASS
## Dean Ross, Donaldine Cameron and Florence Pixley to Have Leads on December 5 
### 
"Wedding Bells" will ring on the
campus the night of December 4 and
the Sophomore class will do the ringing.
That is the name of the play to be pro
duced by the class. The cast picked was
carefully sifted from the enormous num
ber of tryoutees and for some parts
there was keen competition. The play
is a cleverly worked out comedy, light
and airy, carrying double leads which
call for skillful work on the part of the
actors. —
Salisbury Field, a noted comic dra
matist, is the author of the play. He
also wrote "Twin Beds," but "Wedding
Bells" is an altogether different type of
comedy. While the former was sort of
a broad farce, "Wedding Bells" stands
out for its sparkling high grade of
humor.
Tracing back the history of Field's
sensation, it made its first appearance in
New York last year, with Wallace Ed
dinger taking the main lead and Mar
garet Lawrence playing opposite to him.
There the comedy met its first success
and its author was flooded with requests
for options by stock companies. He re
fused them all and the original company
took the play to London, where it is
now being produced. Another company,
composed only of the most prominent
actors, is also playing "Wedding Bells"
in Chicago this season. It was only
"strings of friendship" that pulled the
play to the capipus. Coach Gordon
Davis personally obtained the author's
original manuscript and from it is stag
ing the play here.
The way Field has constructed his
comedy is somewhat different from most
plays. He has not slighted any parts
and all of them arc heavy enough to
call for good acting. His cast include-,
four women parts, giving an extra op
portunity to the women in the '23 class.
It is not a one-man play nor a one
woman play. Each actor will have the
best chance ever given on the campus' to
distinguish himself. The parts of Rosalie
and Reggie, to be carried by Donaldine
Cameron and Dean Ross, arc considered
the first leads. Ross and Miss Cameron
luive shown extraordinary talent in the
tryouts and it is expected they will guide
the show to success December 4.
Most of the remainder of the cast
have never before been seen in campus
productions. Arnold Bayley, who is
carrying the part of Fuzisaki, a Japanese
houseboy, and Fred Hughes, who will
take the part of Spencer Wells, are the
only ones who have appeared on the
local stage before. Bayley took a strong
character part in the Masquers play at
the lake last spring. Hughes was a
member of the chorus in last year's
Junior Opera. Miss Pixley, as well as
the rest of the cast, is promising in her
part of the second lead.

best chance ever given on the campus' to
distinguish himself. The parts of Rosalie
and Reggie, to be carried by Donaldine
Cameron and Dean Ross, arc considered
the first leads. Ross and Miss Cameron
luive shown extraordinary talent in the
tryouts and it is expected they will guide
the show to success December 4.
Most of the remainder of the cast
have never before been seen in campus
productions. Arnold Bayley, who is
carrying the part of Fuzisaki, a Japanese
houseboy, and Fred Hughes, who will
take the part of Spencer Wells, are the
only ones who have appeared on the
local stage before. Bayley took a strong
character part in the Masquers play at
the lake last spring. Hughes was a
member of the chorus in last year's
Junior Opera. Miss Pixley, as well as
the rest of the cast, is promising in her
part of the second lead.
"Wedding Bells" will ring on the
campus the night of December 4 and
the Sophomore class will do the ringing.
That is the name of the play to be pro
duced by the class. The cast picked was
carefully sifted from the enormous num
ber of tryoutees and for some parts
there was keen competition. The play
is a cleverly worked out comedy, light
and airy, carrying double leads which
call for skillful work on the part of the
actors. —
Salisbury Field, a noted comic dra
matist, is the author of the play. He
also wrote "Twin Beds," but "Wedding
Bells" is an altogether different type of
comedy. While the former was sort of
a broad farce, "Wedding Bells" stands
out for its sparkling high grade of
humor.
Tracing back the history of Field's
sensation, it made its first appearance in
New York last year, with Wallace Ed
dinger taking the main lead and Mar
garet Lawrence playing opposite to him.
There the comedy met its first success
and its author was flooded with requests
for options by stock companies. He re
fused them all and the original company
took the play to London, where it is
now being produced. Another company,
composed only of the most prominent
actors, is also playing "Wedding Bells"
in Chicago this season. It was only
"strings of friendship" that pulled the
play to the capipus. Coach Gordon
Davis personally obtained the author's
original manuscript and from it is stag
ing the play here.
The way Field has constructed his
comedy is somewhat different from most
plays. He has not slighted any parts
and all of them arc heavy enough to
call for good acting. His cast include-,
four women parts, giving an extra op
portunity to the women in the '23 class.
It is not a one-man play nor a one
woman play. Each actor will have the
best chance ever given on the campus' to
distinguish himself. The parts of Rosalie
and Reggie, to be carried by Donaldine
Cameron and Dean Ross, arc considered
the first leads. Ross and Miss Cameron
luive shown extraordinary talent in the
tryouts and it is expected they will guide
the show to success December 4.
