# Women's Council Backs Protest; Charges Denied
## 
### 
Women's Council unanimously sup
ports the protest of Roble Hall against
the article of Miss Florence Hocking.
We desire to deny the sweeping accusa
tions, as we firmly believe that these
statements were not grounded on facts
and arc an entire misrepresentation of
conditions.
We wish to state that the unfavorable
publicity afforded Stanford women is
a matter of no little consequence. Coun
cil feels that in the best interests of the
University it is our duty to demand an
immediate retraction by the author.
ELISABETH M. McfcEE.
Secretary Women's Council.
