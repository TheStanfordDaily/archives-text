# MURPHY, CROSBY AND BROWN WILL SPEAK TOMORROW
## Proposed Basketball Pavilion Will be Discussed at Student Assembly Before Vote 
### 
J. T. Murphy, '20, manager of the
Mens Union; H. A. Brown, '20, crew
captain, and C. C. Crosby, '20, presideni
of the Inter-Fraternity Conference* will
discuss the proposed $75,000 basketball
â€¢and dance pavilion at the assembly called
for tomorrow morning by the student
body president, F. L. McElroy, '21.
The advantages and faults of the pro
posed system for raising the necessary
funds will be gone over in detail by the
speakers and any misunderstanding on
the parti of the students as to the real
meaning of the proposal will be cor
rected.
Ihe Stanford Board of Trustees has
agreed to advance the money necessary
for the construction of the pavilion if
they are guaranteed a return of the
loan with interest.
In order to meet this requirement,
the Board of Athletic Control agrees to
contribute $7500 a year, and President
Wilbur and Comptroller Roth are will
ing to advance $5000 a year from the
university budget. It is further pro
posed to add a dollar a quarter to the
registration fees, thus bringing the total
yearly contribution to about $20,(XX).
The structure planned will serve for
campus social functions as well as for
athletic purposes. It will have all the
accessories of a ballroom as well as a
kitchen to prepare evening lunches.
Former plans for the erection of a
$15,000 temporary basketball pavilion
were abandoned in favor of the new
proposal. The University authorities,
however, did not approve of the build
ing of any further temporary structures
on the campus, and in view of the fact
that the Encina Gymnasium floor was
unfit for athletic purposes, the Board
strongly favors the adoption of the pro
posed measure.
