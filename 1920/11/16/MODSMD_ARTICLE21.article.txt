## 
### 
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA.
Nov. 16.—"Doping California to win by
five or six touchdowns is absurd," says
"Andy" Smith, head coach of the Blue
and Gold football squad. "Such cock
snreness will reduce our chances againsi
a strong team, for no dub bunch can
trim Oregon and Washington.
"We have a good football team, but
so has Stanford. Next Saturday we will
see the hardest battle of the season.
Tcmpleton is a definite asset to the
Stanford team and his work will show
to good advantage, especially if the field
is wet.
"Ovcrconfidence is California's old
hoodoo, and it is again cropping out.
The Blue and Gold has the best chance
it ever had to play at Pasadena and win
the national title, but an eleventh hour
mishap might turn our dreams of vic
tory into defeat."
Coaches "Doc" Rosenthal and "Nibs"
Price arc expecting a victory over the
Redshirts, but arc not saying much.
They are putting the Bruin squad
through heavy scrimmage and signal
practice this week. Fumbling is causing
the Bear pigskin savants more worry
than anything else, and they are working
hard to iron all ragged edges before
the big day.
Defense drill will be emphasized in
the remaining workouts. Stanford is
expected to spring some trick plays, and
"Andy" and his assistants are making
every effort to forestall any new moves.
The Bruins hope to keep the Cardinal
outside their forty-yard line out of re
spect for Tcmplcton's toe.
