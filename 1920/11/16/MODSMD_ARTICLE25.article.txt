# VOTE FOR THE PAVILION
## 
### 
B Y their vote tomorrow, the students will determine whether a $75,000
basketball pavilion will be erected on the campus. The plan calls for
the money to be loaned by the Board of Trustees and to be paid for in
part by the students by a tax 011 themselves of one dollar a quarter. The
Board of Athletic Control, Comptroller Roth, and President Wilbur com
bined will advance $12,000 yearly toward paying off the debt, and the
students'will pay the rest themselves by the taxation method.
The necessity for the erection of the building is recognized by the
majority of thcstudents. The Trustees have refused to allow the Board
of Athletic Control to build a temporary structure. In order to house
the crowds that attend the Conference basketball games, and in order
to train a basketball team properly, a larger building with a spring floor
must be built. Stanford produced a championship quintet last year un
der a considerable handicap, and if the same kind of varsities are to be
turned out in the future, the teams must have proper playing facilities.
A temporary floor cannot be built, and so the only alternative is to build
a pavilion such as the one that will be voted upon tomorrow.
The method of payment does not place a heavy burden 011 the students.
Three dollars a year for a short period is not a heavy tax, and it will
not be unduly hard 011 the average student to meet this assessment.
A heavy vote must be cast, and the majority in favor of the project
must be large in order to secure the loan from the Trustees. The
Trustees must be assured that the students are strongly in favor of
building the pavilion, and the only way to give them this assurance is
to vote for the project.
