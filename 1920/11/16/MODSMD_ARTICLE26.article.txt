# BIG GAME WEEK
## 
### 
JHIS is Big Game Week, and with rallies, speeches, and the bonfire
scheduled to happen, the Stanford student body should journey to
Berkeley Saturday, overflowing with enthusiasm. Yell Leader Kinney
has announced an impromptu rally for this evening in front of the Chi
Psi house, where the football team is in training, and tomorrow after
noon the rooters will practice stunts, songs, and yells for the game at a
bleacher rally. There is no need to remind the student body of the im
portance of attending these rallies. This is the final week of the foot
ball season, and everyone should by this time be enthused enough to
want to attend all rallies and gatherings, and by their appearance show
the Varsity that it has the solid backing of the Stanford campus.
