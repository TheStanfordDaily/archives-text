# WINTER QUARTER SORORITY RUSHING WILL BE FORMAL
## 
### 
Rushing for the winter quarter will
be formal and a contract similar to that
devised for the fall quarter will be
used, according to a resolution passed
by Pan-Hellenic Association at a meet
ing held yesterday in the Women's
Clubhouse.
All details for the winter rushing
season were not worked out definitely,
but a tentative schedule was arranged.
This provides that rushing shall begin
on registration night, January 3, prob
ably with a dinner date, and will con
tinue until 8 o'clock Sunday night, Jan
uary 9. Bids will be sent in to the
lawyer by 9 o'clock the same, evening
and the new women will state their
preference for the soroities on the fol
lowing day at the lawyer's office.
The number of dates that each house
may- ask for in advance has not been
settled as yet, but it will probably re
main the same as in the fall quarter,
when only one advance date could be
obtained. The same rules laid down in
the fall contract providing that there
shall be no meeting of trains, no calling
for or taking home women who live
on the campus, and, no rushing on
Quad, which includes all communica
tion between freshmen and fraternity
women, with the exception of exchang
ing momentary greeting and answer
forced during the winter season.
