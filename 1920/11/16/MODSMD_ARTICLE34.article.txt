Whittier Wellman, cx-'2O, formei

ford chapter of Sigma Delta Chi, the
national honorary journalistic fraternity,
at the national convention of the fra
ternity which will be held at Norman,
Oklahoma, the last of this week. Well

The selection of a non-active man to
represent the local chapter of Sigma
Delta Chi at the convention was made

anyone now registered in college to get
away for two weeks and make up their
scholastic work afterwards.
Besides being a member of the Daily
staff, Wellman is a member of Ham
mer and Coffin and a frequent con
tributor to the Cardinal. He was one
time manager of the Stanford Sequoia.
Wellman is a Sigma Chi.
