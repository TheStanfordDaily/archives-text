# RED CROSS DRIVE ON QUAD OPENS THURSDAY
## 
### 
A membership drive for the Red
Cross will be held on Quad next Thurs
day. It was to have been on Wednes
day, but due to the election for the
basketball pavilion it has been post
poned. Tt is hoped that everyone will
answer this Red Cross roll call, as it
is the fourth of its kind op the campus
and should bring a per cent
response. A drive will be organized
through the halls and houses tonight.
