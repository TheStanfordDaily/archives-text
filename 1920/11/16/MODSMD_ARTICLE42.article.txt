# Big Leagues to Suffer If Spitball Is Banned
## 
### HENRY L. FARRELL (United Press Staff Correspondent 
NEW YORK, Nov. 16.—Stan Cove
leskie, Cleveland's star Pole pitcher, had
just battled his way through a wild
crowd of jubilant fans into the club
house.
He had just won his third game of
the world's series and pitched the In
dians into their first world's champion
ship.
The fans were acclaiming him the
"greatest of the great."
A fan rose from a scat back of the
press box, stretched and said rather
wisely:
"Well, Cov, they oughta give you a
big hand. It's your last game."
It's true. Coveleskie is through. He'll
never pitche another yame
Neither will Burleigh Grimes, king of
the National League hurlers and another
star of the series.
The yare through unless the major
leagues reverse their ruling abolishing
the spitball this year.
When freak deliveries were put under
the ban last winter, the moguls gave the
spit-baller pitchers a season t<> develop
other deliveries.
Coveleskie tried early in the season to
get along without the "spitter," but lie
was unsuccessful. He wasn't effective
with a curve ball and was forced to go
back to his forte.
Urban Sliocker of the Browns and
Jack Quinn of the Yankees are in the
same boat.
Bill Doak of the Cards, Fillingim of
the Braves and Phil Douglas of the
Giants will have to go along will) Grimes
in the National League, if the rule is
not revoked.
Rather than lose such valuable pitch
ers, it seems probable that the club
owners will seek to have the rule
amended.
President Heydlcr of the National
League has maintained that there isn't
a chance to save the "spit-ballers."
During the last season a campaign
was conducted among the players to
have the rule changed.
It wa ssuggested to bar newcomers
with the "spitter," but to permit those
pitchers now using the moist delivery to
continue it until their career ends.
One club owner in each league is said
to be ready to come to the aid of the
"spittcrs" at the winter meeting of the
major leagues.
