Dear Sir:—
By this time a good many of us
are commencing to wonder who is
getting the most "harmful" publicity
—Miss Florence Hocking, on account
of her article in the "Pictorial," or
the members of the "500" who are
airing what they think is their right
eous fury in the city papers. Miss
Hocking in her article said that smok
ing by Stanford women should be
stopped, the Roble Committee of Five
and the Women's Council, in effect
have said that as there was no smok
ing here, there was no need to stop
it. The statements of both earned
headlines in San Francisco.
After all, who is washing Stanford's
dirty linen in public? It is Miss Hock
ing who frankly stated what she be
lieved was a condition at Stanford and
offered a pretty definite remedy for
it? Or is it the enraged young ladies
wlio have announced to the world
that the stains on their fingers were
the results of working in the chem
istry laboratory and not from the
deadly weed?
It all seems to the writer to be a
case of misdirected energy. If a
charge is made that smoking exists on
the Stanford campus among women,
the attentions of t.iose concerned
should first be directed towards veri
fying the charges or disproving them.
Once that they are definitely disproved
it is time enough to heap abuse on
the head of the writer. The official
representatives of the Stanford wo
men have chosen to take the second
step first, which is, to say the least,
a baffling method of procedure.
There is only one reason, but a very
good one, that the "Pictorial" should
have published "Where There is So
Much Smoke." It is connected with
the very reason for that magazine's
existence. It is the "Students' Maga
zine of Opinion." If an honest and
straightforward opinion is expressed,
it is up to that magazine to publish it,
no matter if it fails to meet with the
approval of a certain group of college
thinkers who prefer suppression to
a decent airing of the affair in ques
tion. If publicity, pitiless, harmful,
and otherwise accrues, it is unfortun
ate, but surely Stanford is a big
enough place to stand the flaring
headlines for the sake of openly clear
ing up one of its problems in its own
publications. Stanford, like every
other college, has had similar pub
licity before and will have it again.
We cannot suppress discussion of our
local problems because of our fear that
we will gain a place in the headlines.

Dear Sir: —
"Washing out our dirty clothes in
public," to quote from one of our well
known campus journalists, does not
enhance the reputation of the Uni
versity. Much as we might wish to
censure Miss Hocking, is she wholly
to blame that the good people of San
Francisco have been properly shocked
by the startling news that Stanford
co-eds smoke and shoot craps?
Is it too much to ask the editors of
our campus publication to use a higher
standard in judging what comprises
"all the news that's fit to print"?
Should not the editor of the Pictorial,
for example, realize more fully the
responsibilities of his position, and re
cognizing the apparent danger to the
reputation of the University in print
ing such an article, refuse to publish
that which cannot but do harm? If
everything which is submitted was j
published, and everything published l
resulted in the same disastrous ef
fects, it would not take so very long)
to ruin the hitherto enviable reputa
tion of Stanford.
No one advocates a censorship or
suppression of student opinion which
may, by discussion, lead to beneficial,
constructive improvement—but when
a "Shavian Puritan less Intent upon
the smart sentence (to quote from last
reform than upon the perpetrating of
night's editorial in the Bulletin)
writeß and submits something, which
will obviously damage the reputation
of the University if printed, then the
editor of the campus publication to
which it is submitted, should see to
it that such an article is never set
up in type.
Can't we solve our difficulties and
our problems on our own campus
without the help of state-wide no
toriety? Won't our campus publica
tions help us to add to, not detract
from, the reputation of Stanford Uni
versity.

stopped, the Roble Committee of Five
and the Women's Council, in effect
have said that as there was no smok
ing here, there was no need to stop
it. The statements of both earned
headlines in San Francisco.
After all, who is washing Stanford's
dirty linen in public? It is Miss Hock
ing who frankly stated what she be
lieved was a condition at Stanford and
offered a pretty definite remedy for
it? Or is it the enraged young ladies
wlio have announced to the world
that the stains on their fingers were
the results of working in the chem
istry laboratory and not from the
deadly weed?
It all seems to the writer to be a
case of misdirected energy. If a
charge is made that smoking exists on
the Stanford campus among women,
the attentions of t.iose concerned
should first be directed towards veri
fying the charges or disproving them.
Once that they are definitely disproved
it is time enough to heap abuse on
the head of the writer. The official
representatives of the Stanford wo
men have chosen to take the second
step first, which is, to say the least,
a baffling method of procedure.
There is only one reason, but a very
good one, that the "Pictorial" should
have published "Where There is So
Much Smoke." It is connected with
the very reason for that magazine's
existence. It is the "Students' Maga
zine of Opinion." If an honest and
straightforward opinion is expressed,
it is up to that magazine to publish it,
no matter if it fails to meet with the
approval of a certain group of college
thinkers who prefer suppression to
a decent airing of the affair in ques
tion. If publicity, pitiless, harmful,
and otherwise accrues, it is unfortun
ate, but surely Stanford is a big
enough place to stand the flaring
headlines for the sake of openly clear
ing up one of its problems in its own
publications. Stanford, like every
other college, has had similar pub
licity before and will have it again.
We cannot suppress discussion of our
local problems because of our fear that
we will gain a place in the headlines.

Dear Sir: —
"Washing out our dirty clothes in
public," to quote from one of our well
known campus journalists, does not
enhance the reputation of the Uni
versity. Much as we might wish to
censure Miss Hocking, is she wholly
to blame that the good people of San
Francisco have been properly shocked
by the startling news that Stanford
co-eds smoke and shoot craps?
Is it too much to ask the editors of
our campus publication to use a higher
standard in judging what comprises
"all the news that's fit to print"?
Should not the editor of the Pictorial,
for example, realize more fully the
responsibilities of his position, and re
cognizing the apparent danger to the
reputation of the University in print
ing such an article, refuse to publish
that which cannot but do harm? If
everything which is submitted was j
published, and everything published l
resulted in the same disastrous ef
fects, it would not take so very long)
to ruin the hitherto enviable reputa
tion of Stanford.
No one advocates a censorship or
suppression of student opinion which
may, by discussion, lead to beneficial,
constructive improvement—but when
a "Shavian Puritan less Intent upon
the smart sentence (to quote from last
reform than upon the perpetrating of
night's editorial in the Bulletin)
writeß and submits something, which
will obviously damage the reputation
of the University if printed, then the
editor of the campus publication to
which it is submitted, should see to
it that such an article is never set
up in type.
Can't we solve our difficulties and
our problems on our own campus
without the help of state-wide no
toriety? Won't our campus publica
tions help us to add to, not detract
from, the reputation of Stanford Uni
versity.

Dear Sir:—
By this time a good many of us

airing what they think is their right

Hocking in her article said that smok
