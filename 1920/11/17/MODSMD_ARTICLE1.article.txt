# STUDENTS RATIFY ATHLETIC BOARD PLAN FOR PAVILION CONSTRUCTION ALMOST UNANIMOUSLY, 1089 TO 70
## More Than Half of Students Go to Polls to Support Measure 
### 
The student body overwhelmingly
adopted the proposal of the Board of
Athletic Control for the new basket
ball and dance pavilion to be built
on a loan of $75,000 from the Board
of Trustees, by a vote of 1089 to 70,
at the Quad election today.
Plans for the proposed basketball
pavilion were placed before the student
body at an assembly this morning by
J. T. Murphy, '20, one of the student
members of the Board of Athletic Con
trol.
Murphy outlined the project as it was
presented in the Daily Palo Alto last
week. He said the crowded condition of
the Encina courts and other undesirable
features about them had led the Board
of Athletic Control to lay plans las.:
year for a temporary structure to cost
$15,000.
Objection was made to this plan by
the Board of Trustees, who declared
that past experience had shown that
temporary structures were not a suc
cess and that they remained an eyesore
on the campus. The Trustees then made
the proposal to loan $75,000 for the
erection of a pavilion if the students
would be willing to tax themselves to
repay the loan.
Plans for the building have been
drawn up, according to Murphy. They
provide for a building with a seating
capacity of 3000 persons in addition to
equipment for a ballroom. There will
be a spring floor in the building. One
of the objections to the Encina court

lias been the hard floor, which has
caused many sore feet among the
basketball players, and made it im
possible for them to come out for track
following the close of the basketball
season, Murphy said.
Murphy said that there had been an
idea among some students that the erec
tion of the pavilion will interfere with
financing the proposed football bowl.
The speaker denied this. He said thac
arrangements are to be made for financ
ing this project without calling on the
student body. â€¢
Prospects for the revival of crew arc
better if the pavilion is built, said Mut
phy, because of the added revenue it
will give the Board of Athletic Control.
Crew Captain Hal Brown urged the
adoption of the pavilion on.the ground
that it is the only sure way to bring
about a return of crew. He regarded
the offer of the Board of Trustees
significant in that it showed that the
university authorities are sanctioning
intercollegiate athletics.
In talking 011 crew, Brown said that 1l
was the sport that has put Stanford on
the athletic map in the East. He de
clared that if it is allowed to lapse for
several years interest will be lost in it
and it will be hard to revive.
Before the assembly a Roughs parade
filed through the building. Yell Leader
Wendell Kinney then held a rally at
which the new Cardinal songs were
sung. The yell leader urged attendance
at the bleacher rally to be held on the
football field this afternoon.
