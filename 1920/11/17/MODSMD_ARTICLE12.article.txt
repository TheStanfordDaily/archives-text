Rough-ophebia! As a certain notori
ous article in a campus magazine has
made the term "smoke-ophebia" famil
iar, so the Stanford student body—
minus 500—today made a spectacular
demonstration of the meaning of
"rough-ophebia." Attired, misattired or
non-attired, every true Stanford gent
today made his appearance on the Quad
in a costume suggesting everything from
a jester in Cleopatra's court to the latest
in Zicgfeld hollies.
"Breakfast, breakfast, have some ham
and eggs!" was the recurring battle cry
of the frosh Rough stationed on the
engineering corner. Miss "500." hasten
ing on the way for a class, was prof
fered a skilletful of omelette by the
decore frosh. Did she cat? '1 lie skillet
was full at noon, but a Score or so of
cameras caught the scene for tue future
delectation of the campus in magazine
f377 QPrtiotis
"We want the basketball pavilion,"
chanted the Rough sin pee-rade forma
tion as they surged against the doors of
the Assembly Hall. The demur of the
doorkeepers kept many of the gents
from entering the hall, but a number
evaded the guards and noisily pro
claimed that Stanford democracy was
on exhibition on this day of all days,
when the dtcorous diletante must hide
behind guarded doors.
"The Sins of the 500!" May the sen
sational newspapers fail to make a front
page story of this exhibition of the de
pravity of the modern college women.
"Little Phoebe," herself, revealed the
practices existent or non-existent among
Stanford women. No mere man was
able to compote with Phoebe in the game
of African Golf.
