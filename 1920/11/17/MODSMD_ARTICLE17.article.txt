# Local Journalists Put Off Wednesday Meeting
## 
### 
The meeting of the Stanford Chapter
of American Journalists' Association,
which was set for Wednesday night,
has been postponed, due to the lack of a
speaker for the occasion. The commit
tee in charge was endeavoring to secure
a well known journalist as speaker, but
have not yet received his acceptance of
the invitation. If it is possible for him
to come to the University soon he will
speak to the journalists.
The Chapter in the future will have
as a speaker W. H. Begbie Fowler, '06,
who was editor of the Daily Palo Alto
while in college and is now Business
Manager of the San Francisco Chronicle.
