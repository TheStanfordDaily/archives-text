# CARDINAL ELEVEN IMPROVES GREATLY AS BIG GAME NEARS
## Fr. Ricard, Well-Known Weather Prophet, Forecasts Clear . Day Saturday 
### 
Father Ricard, S. J., oÂ£ the Santa
Clara University, the famous weather
prophet, assured otic of the Daily Palo
Alto representatives last night that the
Cardinal eleven could he promised a
clear day Saturday to meet the Blue and
Gold team. By the help of the spots
on the sun, Father Ricard is able to
get accurate condition of climatic dis
turbances. He said that the Big Game
day would lie clear, but minor disturb
ances would be in evidence between now
and Friday afternoon. Whether they
would be in rain, wind or clouds, he did
not state.
With a clear day promised for the
annual clash between the rival univer
sity teams, the Stanford eleven's chances
advance 50 per cent. It looked like an
almost helpless proposition to send the
Cardinal players up against the heavier
Bruin aggregation. With forward passes
and kicking made difficult through wet
weather, the team from the farm would
be seriously handicapped.
Last night's secret practice showed
the men all in better shape. The men
reported 011 the injured list were on
the field in uniforms. However, neither
Deems, Pelouze or Adams scrimmaged
with the rest of the Varsity. Coach
Powell is taking 110 chances on having
any of his first string players put out
of play in the last few days before the
Stanford-California game.
"Dink" Templeton was working the
football men hard last night trying to
run down his punts. His toe is sending
the ball out farther than he has ever
been known to punt. On drop kicking

Templeton is up to form and can be
counted upon to send the ball over the
Blue and Gold goal post when the Car
dinal gets within striking distance. Pat
rick is punting further than the most
promising California kicker, and will be
held in reserve in case Dink is forced
out of the play. Several possibilities are
in the field for reserve drop kickers, all
of whom are but cannot compare
with Templeton.
Stanford is having heavy scrimmages
every night in order that the team will
be in the top notch of condition by Sat
urday afternoon. Coach Andy Smith is
putting his men through a light final
week of workout on account of the
Bears reaching their height of condition
several weeks ago.
Last night Yell Leader Wendell Kin
ney held an impromptu rally in front
of the Chi Psi house. Nearly a thou
sand rooters were gathered together in
the parades starting from the Sigma Nu
house and the halls, having as their
destination the Varsity training table.
Pre-Rally enthusiasm was in evidence
throughout the campus today. Roughs
day proved to heighten the enthusiasm
of the student body. Even at the stu
dent body assembly this mornings the
Roughs were unable to hold themselves
back.
Student rooters must get tickets for
the Big Rally from the office of tin-
Registrar before tomorrow afternoon at
4 o'clock. After that time tickets will
be passed out to the general public.
Students are urged to get their tickcts
at once, because the Assembly Hall will
hold only a limited number. The Rally
will start promptly at 7:30 o'clock,
where enthusiasm will reign supreme
for the ensuing two hours. Occasionally
when the rooters run out of breath the
coaches and members of the Varsity
eleven will be called upon to give short
talks. Shortly after 9 o'clock the Hold
overs will set fire to the week's work
of the freshman class.
