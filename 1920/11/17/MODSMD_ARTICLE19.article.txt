To the Women's Council, Stan
ford University, Calif.: —In view
of the extreme publicity given my
recent article in the "Pictorial"
and because of the general ill-im
pression which it has caused I
wish to make a statement of my
purpose in writing this article.
The idea which I Intended to

Therefore Hi wish to state that
the generalities, upon which I
based my statements, were used
as mere journalistic ethics, and
not because smoking is general or
habitual among the Stanford Wo
