# BIG GAME SPIRIT
## 
### 
"Rough's Day" seems to have furnished the necessary powder to
set the Stanford Spirit aflame, and from the amount of enthusiasm
shown today the Berkeley Bear will be forced to hunt a fire-prpof hole
to protect himself from the invading Cardinals. Dignity, once a part of
the Stanford student, has been cast away for Big Game Week, and each
student seems to be trying to outdo the other in devising new forms to
show his enthusiasm. Stanford is fortunate in having a student body
that has always been able to throw itself into the spirit of the game,
and not stand on the side-lines and merely approve.
Stanford Spirit has come to be recognized as an important factor
in the Big Game by the sporting authorities, and even by the Golden
Bear. It is gradually approaching its height, and on Saturday afternoon
the Californians will see Stanford Spirit break forth in its grand climax.
