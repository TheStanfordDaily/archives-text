# A 						CLOSED ISSUE

### 
The "smoking issue" has been given considerable publicity and a
general airing, and both sides seem inclined to let the matter rest.
The Women's Cquncil has taken its stand, and Miss Hocking has ex
plained her object in writing the article. The Daily Palo Alto has
printed several communications on the subject and given an oppor
tunity for all arguments to be presented. Carrying the matter further
will avail nothing, and for the good of the University the subject should
be closed.
