Editor of Daily Palo Alto: —
It certainly hits us members of the
Alumni hard to hear this airing of
Stanford's faults, as well as the oth«r
member of this large Stanford "fam
ily." But when we consider the pro
position from all its viewpoints we
cannot see that this is so bad after
all. If we have faults it is well that
they be given publicity so that the
members of this Stanford "family,"
as President Wilbur has so frequently
called it, who are at fault will see
fallacies of their ways and alter them.
For if they know that they are al
ways before the public eye, they will
no doubt consider the name of Stan
ford more highly, and mend their
ways. This is a lesson to them which
they will not forget. It is needless to
have our faults bared to the world at
large, but it is far better to have it
appear in the papers that the Stanford
family is on its guard and is correct
ing its faults than to have the public
learn through the columnous tongue
of rumor, by which the ever-ready
ears of the public will sooner of later
get the real truth. If we have th»
stain of tobacco on the fair name of

Stanford, let us wipe it out immedi
ately and then let the public know
that Stanford corrects its faults.
We cannot correct faults unless we
know of them. Let us profit by ex
perience, and thank Miss Hocking,
instead of letting the strain remain
until the public would sooner or later
learn of it and are able to say "Stan
ford Women Smoke and Stanford
'Family' Sanctions It."
If anyone is to be blamed for any
undue publicity which has been given
to this affair, it should fall upon that
person who has caused the article
which Miss Hocking submitted to the
student body, for its benefit, to be re
printed in the S. F. papers. The Stan
ford papers are the ways in which
Stanfordites "keep on the boat," and
most of us would not learn of our
faults if they were kept from the
Stanford publications. If we do not
know our faults we cannot remedy
them, and the outcome of "hushing
scandals" would desult in the public
finding out our fauls before the mem
bers of the Stanford family has knowl
edge of them and has a chance to
remedy them. Blame the reporter,
the Judah in our midst, who has done
his best to spread the knowledge of
our faults outside of this immediate
Stanford "family."
