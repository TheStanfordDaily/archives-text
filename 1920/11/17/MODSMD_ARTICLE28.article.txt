# MUSICAL ARTIST WILL APPEAR IN 'QUALITY CONCERTS'

### 
Under the management of Frank W.
Healy, who arranged a number of con
certs here last year, a group of leading
artists will appear in a series of four
"Quality Concerts," to be given in the
Assembly Hall during the present
season.
The first of these concerts will be a
double program by Raoul Vidas, vio
linist, and Charles Hackett, tenor. This
arrangement was due to a mistake in
bookings, by which both artists were
engaged for the same date, and conse
quently they will appear in the same
concert. Charles Hackett is an Amer
ican tenor who was notably received
recently at the La Scala in Milan and
who has been appearing at the Metro
politan Opera House in this country.
Louis Graveure, well-known baritone,
will give the second concert of the
series. He is considered one of the
most promising of the younger artists.
Gravenure will be assisted at the piano
by Eduard Gendron, who is a noted
pianist as well as an accompanist.
Leo Ornstein, frequently referred to
as the "Wizard of the Keyboard," will
present the third concert program. He
recently appeared in Aeolian Hall, New
York, where he was given an enthusi
astic reception.
The closing event of the concerts will
be the appearance of Mine. Frances
Alda, who has just returned from
Europe and who opened her season as
star soloist of the Maine Festival. Hei
only appearance in Northern California
will be in San Francisco and at Stan
ford. The same is also true of Hackett
and Vidas. Mme. Alda will come here
direct from a season at the Metropolitan.
Mr. Healy is arranging so that sea
son ticket subscribers will not only
save a considerable amount in the pricc
of tickets, but will also secure the same
seats for all concerts. On Monday, No
vember 22, the sale of season tickets
will open at Crandall's Book Store in
