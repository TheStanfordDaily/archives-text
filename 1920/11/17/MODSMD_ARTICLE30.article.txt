"Stanford is said to possess a wo
man student who can clean up a whole
corridor at Alabam' marbles or Nu
bian p010... Maybe, but has she tried
the bones with the colored janitor?"
S. F. Bulletin.

Don't Sohut, I Can Hear You
Perfectly
Littl Eva is all excited. She read
in the fashion columns that the girls
are beginning to wear their hair off
their ears. She believes that now
the profs, won't have to talk so loud.
The question is—what are they going
to do with all those stuffings? Eva
moves that they be given to the Frosli
for the bon fine.

Tom K. is troubled. He sent the
November issue of the "Pictorial"
home to his family and then heard
about the "Smokeitis" article that
was in it. He is afraid now that Pa
will drag him away from here and
the winsome, wicked, and wild wo
men.

Cursory Versery
With the weather cleared up and
the sun out again our contribs. are
delving once more into the slushy
sentiment pile. This is exhibit A of
this horrible tendency:
Co-Eds are a frivolous weed
I like them.
They satisfy no human need,
I like them.
I like them fat
I like them lean
I like them every way I've seen,
I can't quite get them through my
bean
But the answer is—
I like them.

Little Eva has descended from her
cake of ice twice in the same day to
inform us that someone in San Jose
is advertising through the Appoint
ment Office for an experienced butch
er. Speaking of smoke-ups, she thinks
that try-outs ought to be held among
the profs for this position.
