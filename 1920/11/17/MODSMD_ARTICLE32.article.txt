# GERMAN COMMUNISTS SUGGEST PRACTICE OF MOSCOW PRINCIPLES
## Extreme Independents Want Moscow Principles in Fatherland 
### CARL D. GROAT 
(United Press Staff Correspondent)
BERLIN, Nov. 17. —Germany's "Neu
kommunisten" —new communists —as
the extreme left of the Independent
party is called since the Halle con
vention —want to start putting Mos
cow principles into practice in Ger
many.
They believe with Sinowjew, Rus
sian agitator and demagogue, that
they can- get a dictatorship of the
proletariat and a soviet regime in
Germany. And, their leaders say, they
are prepared to undertake the fight
at an early date. As this is written,
the new communists are busying
themselves with the task of seizing
Independent party treasuries and try
ing to get control of the party organs.
They started in immediately after the
Halle convention, grabbed the party
paper in Halle, "Das Hallesche Volks
recht," threw out the right-wing edi
tors and put in Moscow principles.
They likewise sent a force of strong
arm youngsters to the central office
of the Independent party here to seize
party documents. A courageous night
watchman drove them off This is
merely the first step in the pro-Mosco
wites fight.
They call themselves Independents
still, just as the right wingers do But
they propose to get the party ma
chinery, especially the party organs
like the influential "Freiheit" here
under their control. Thereafter, ur
co* ding to their ideas, they will be
ready for their battle against their
"enemy, the capitalists."
If one takes the left-wingers' talk
seriously, one can picture a dire and
dieadful winter in Berlin and other
seel ions of Gormany.
But, the .truth of the matter as seen
by careful observers probably is not
as black —or as red —as the new com
munists paint things.
They are regarded as strong enough
to undertake some reign of terror at
various points and times. But, on the
whole their strength is everywhere
estimated as too small to upset the
present order of things. Breitscheid
of the right wing, for instance, fore
sees that the reds will attempt to put
tlitough their terroristic program, but
he adds confidently that the moder
ates will have their inm'ngs directly
afterward.
The creation of a new communist
group in Germany has not the dire
significance that many persons would
attribute to It.
American authorities here are in
clined to take this view fo the situa
tion namely: I—that1 —that the left wing
formation merely separates the sheep
from the goats; 2 —the creation of a
party favoring force and terror is not
a new thing, for the persons who
now cast their lot with Moscow are
the people who have always preached
terror and practiced it when they had
a chance.
And, above all, is the general spirit
of the German worker. He has
reached the point where things go a
little more smoothly for him than for
the last few years. Unemployment
has decreased slightly since the first
of September. The German workers
as a whole want sanity and sound
conditions rather than the doubtful
experiment of Moscowism.
Admissions of even the demagogue
Sinowjew that Russia's internal plight
is bad have given the workers food
for thought.

kommunisten" —new communists —as
the extreme left of the Independent
party is called since the Halle con
vention —want to start putting Mos
cow principles into practice in Ger
many.
They believe with Sinowjew, Rus
sian agitator and demagogue, that
they can- get a dictatorship of the
proletariat and a soviet regime in
Germany. And, their leaders say, they
are prepared to undertake the fight
at an early date. As this is written,
the new communists are busying
themselves with the task of seizing
Independent party treasuries and try
ing to get control of the party organs.
They started in immediately after the
Halle convention, grabbed the party
paper in Halle, "Das Hallesche Volks
recht," threw out the right-wing edi
tors and put in Moscow principles.
They likewise sent a force of strong
arm youngsters to the central office
of the Independent party here to seize
party documents. A courageous night
watchman drove them off This is
merely the first step in the pro-Mosco
wites fight.
They call themselves Independents
still, just as the right wingers do But
they propose to get the party ma
chinery, especially the party organs
like the influential "Freiheit" here
under their control. Thereafter, ur
co* ding to their ideas, they will be
ready for their battle against their
"enemy, the capitalists."
If one takes the left-wingers' talk
seriously, one can picture a dire and
dieadful winter in Berlin and other
seel ions of Gormany.
But, the .truth of the matter as seen
by careful observers probably is not
as black —or as red —as the new com
munists paint things.
They are regarded as strong enough
to undertake some reign of terror at
various points and times. But, on the
whole their strength is everywhere
estimated as too small to upset the
present order of things. Breitscheid
of the right wing, for instance, fore
sees that the reds will attempt to put
tlitough their terroristic program, but
he adds confidently that the moder
ates will have their inm'ngs directly
afterward.
The creation of a new communist
group in Germany has not the dire
significance that many persons would
attribute to It.
American authorities here are in
clined to take this view fo the situa
tion namely: I—that1 —that the left wing
formation merely separates the sheep
from the goats; 2 —the creation of a
party favoring force and terror is not
a new thing, for the persons who
now cast their lot with Moscow are
the people who have always preached
terror and practiced it when they had
a chance.
And, above all, is the general spirit
of the German worker. He has
reached the point where things go a
little more smoothly for him than for
the last few years. Unemployment
has decreased slightly since the first
of September. The German workers
as a whole want sanity and sound
conditions rather than the doubtful
experiment of Moscowism.
Admissions of even the demagogue
Sinowjew that Russia's internal plight
is bad have given the workers food
for thought.
