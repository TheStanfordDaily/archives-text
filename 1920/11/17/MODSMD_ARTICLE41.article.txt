### 
Illustrating his lecture profusely with
interesting slides, Professor Ramirez of
the University of Santiago, in Chile,
gave a talk last night in the Little
Theater upon modern day South Amer
ica. He dealt with the south of Chile
particularly, since it has been little
tuuched by the white men. "The A. B.
C. countries are not countries of ro
mance and revolution," said Professor
Ramirez, "and people should not think
of Mexico when they think of South
America."
Santiago is the Athens of South
America, according to Professor Ra
mirez, because so many students Hock
to the University of Santiago. The ex
treme length of Chile enables it to have
a variety of climates and affords oppor
tunity for varied industries. A railroad
joining Valparaiso to Buenos Aires
crosscs the mountains at a height of
8000 feet. The north of Chile is a desert.
Nitrate, which is used as a fertilizer
and the royalty 011 which pays $25,000,-
000 a year, is exported annually to the
amount of 5,000,000 tons. Chile will have
these riclies for 300 years, cailms Pro
fessor Ramirez.
The early settlers of South America
were the Spanish, and they were unable
<0 fully conquer the Araucanian Indians,
who revolted in Chile as late as 1851.
The resistance to suppression of this
, revolt inspired an epic poem, which has
played a large part in South American
literature.
The slides showed the richness of
the native costumes and dress and fully
bore out Professor Ramirez's state
ments of the increasing development of
the A. B. C. countries.
