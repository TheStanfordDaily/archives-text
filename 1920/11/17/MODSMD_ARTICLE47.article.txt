NEW YORK, Nov 17.—Alien paint
ers whose work endangered American
vessels were hired by the United States
Shipping Board in preference to avail
able Americans, John F. Richardson, in
vestigator, charged before the investiga
tion committee today.
Richardson declared unskilled men
were made foremen and that others who
never before used a paint brush were
put to work. In some cases, he said,
they could not follow lines provided by
camouflucrs. Paint often fell from
vessels before they readied the danger
zone.
