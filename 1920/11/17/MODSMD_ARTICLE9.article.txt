## 
### 
Juniors who have not paid their
Quad assessment are urged to do so
irameditely in order that the Junior
Class section of the Quad may be
closed next month. Manager William
H. Vosburgh requests that the seven
dollar checks be made out to the
1922 Quad and addressed to the Quad,
Box 100, Stanford University.
Commuters from San Jose anri resi
dents in Palo Alto are particularly
urged to remit the class dues at once
as the difficulty of collection of the
assessments by the tryoutees will
causo serious delay. The Quad man
agement expects tlio outstanding dues
to be paid prior to December 7.
