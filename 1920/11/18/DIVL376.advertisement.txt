Mrs. Fox was bragging one day
about the large number of her
cubs.
"How many cubs do you bring
into the world at one time? she
asked the LIONESS
"Only ONE,"replied the Lioness
—' but it's a LION ! "
MURADS COST 20 CENTS
FOR A BOX OF 10
BUT THEY'RE MURADS
MURADS would be lower
priced if we left out all or part of
the 100% Turkish tobaccos of the
purest and best varieties grown —
or if we substituted inferior grades
of Turkish tobacco
But they wouldn't be MURADS
—they'd only be Foxes?
"Judge for Yourself— / "
We call special attention
to Murad 20s in Tin Boxes
