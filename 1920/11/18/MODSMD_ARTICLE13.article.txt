# DR. JORDAN ACTIVE IN WRITING AUTOBIOGRAPHY
## 
### BERTHA VAUGHAN, '22 
David Starr Jordan, Chancellor
Emeritus of the University, is now en
gaged in writing his autobiography, the
first volume of which will soon be in
the hands of the publishers.
The autobiography will consist of two
volumes, the first covering the period
of the author's life from infancy to
1X99. and the second from 1900 up to
the present time. Dr. Jordan expects to
have the books completed within a year.
Dr. Jordan occupies an eminent place
in the scientific, educational and national
life of America. Books that he has writ
ten on these three subjects are well
known and he has been actively engaged
in the affairs of the nation. Besides be
ing of value because of its substance,
the autobiography will lie a distinct con
tribution to American literature.
The chief charm of Dr. Jordan's
work lies in the simple and clear man
ner in which it is written. He writes
directly, as if he were telling the story
to a group of friends, putting in the
humorous touches that are so pleasing to
all who know him.
Dr. Jordan begins with a sketch of
his early life in Gainesville, a New York
country town. It was here that he made
his first acquaintance with natural his
tory. He did not care for the routine
labor of the farm but spent many hours
wandering in the woods, collecting but
terflies and (lowers, and reading poetry.
Dr. Jordan lingers on some of the inter

esting incidents of his childhood in the
delightfully humorous way of which
only he is capable.
He attended the village school and
later the Academy at Warsaw. In 1869
he entered Cornell. Here he continued
to sliow an aptitude for botany and was
made an instructor in the department
during his junior year. Following his
graduation in 1872, Dr. Jordan was pro
fessor of natural history at Lombard
University.
In 1875 he was graduated in medicine
from the Indiana Medical College and
became an instructor in the Indiana Uni
versity. He rose to the presidency licre
and later resigned to become president
of Stanford.
It is in this position and in his later
connections with the University that
Stanford people like to think of Dr.
Jordan. It was a hard position to fill
and it was through the efforts of the
faculty of thirty-eight men, which Dr.
Jordan brought with him, and under
his leadership that the University came
into existence and started toward fame.
In 1913 Dr. Jordan was made Chan
cellor of the University, and in 1917
Chancellor Emeritus.
"The Autobiography of David Starr
Jordan"' will undoubtedly occupy a con
spicuous placc in American literature
because it is the chronicle of the life
of a man who has been active in world
affairs, and it holds an especial interest
for the Stanford people who have the
privilege and pleasure of knowing him.
