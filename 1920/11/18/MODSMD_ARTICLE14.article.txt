# NORTHERN PART OF CALIFORNIA IS IN STORM'S GRIP
## Two Steamers Down and Eel River is Out of Bounds; No Loss of Life Yet in Floods 
### United Press 
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 18.â€”
Northern California was in the grip of
the first real storm of the season today.
Reports from many sections showed
that rivers were swollen by heavy rains
and melting snows. Ships at sea reported
swift winds and high seas.
Although there were instances of
damage reported, no really heavy losses
from the storm occurred except that
two steamers, the Joan of Arc and the
G. C. Lindauer, foundered with con
siderable loss of life. Small damage has
been done to crops in the Sacramento
Valley.
Humboldt County probably suffered
more than any other county in the north
ern part of the state. The Eel River
started rising yesterday and today was
out of its bounds, inundating the low
lands and forcing dairymen to drive
their cattle to higher grounds. Three
lumber camps in Humboldt County were
forced to shut down.
The Sacramento River started rising
yesterday and today indications were
that the river is hising to a higher level
than it has reached at any time in the
last two years. Measurements today
showed a rise of eleven feet at Red
Bluff, ten feet six inches at Colusa,
and the Feather River had risen eight
feet eight inches at Oroville. At Sacra
mento the river had risen, ten feet four
inches.
Reports showed that thus far the
operation of trains on the Southern Pa
cific route out of San Francisco through
the Sacramento Valley was not seri
ously affected.
Weather bureau reports showed the
rainfall to be general throughout the
northern part of the state.
