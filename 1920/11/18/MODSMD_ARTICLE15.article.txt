postponed due to the lac kof satisfac
tory arrangements with the northern

ing to get the mermen down from there
for the last two weeks in order that the
schedule for this quarter might be com
plete, but has been put off until he
thinks that now the season is too far
advanced to pull off the meet.
Last year the freshmen cleaned out
on the northern boys, and Erny ex
pected his new babes to do the same,
