# PRESSLEY '07 AND BRADLEY' 99 TO TALK AT FOOTBALL RALLY
## Coach Powell, Captain Art Wilcox and Trainer "Dad" Moulton Are the Other Speakers 
### 
Tonight at 7:30 when Stanford stu
dents gather in Ac Assembly Hall for
the football rally they will be ad
dressed by two of the most famous
alumni that ever graduated from the
University. George Pressley, '07, and
Chris Bradley, '99, are the men who
will furnish the alumni viewpoint.
Pressley was a rugby player under
Coach James Lanagan, and afterward
assisted him as coach and then suc
ceeded him. He is an advocate of
clean sports and is well equipped to
address a Stanford football rally. He
is now president of the Stanford
Alumni Association.
Chris Bradley is noted as a humor
ist. He was, while in the University,
a boon companion of the Irwins, and
Charley Field, who were the greatest
wits of the day. Bradley will furnish
the funny angles. He was an Encina
man, and edited the '99 Quad.
Captain "Art" Wilcox will talk to
the assemblage as representative of
the varsity. Wilcox is a player of
ability and was chosen captain of the
1920 varsity because of this fact. He
will present the team viewpoint.
Coach Powell and Trainer "Dad"
Moulton will outline the team's

â€¢ chances in the coming struggle.
Powell is expected to furnish the meet
ing with plenty of pepper as he is a
forceful and enthusiastic speaker.
"Dad" Moulton has been at Stanford
in the capacity of training for many
years, and will acquaint the gathering
with the condition of the men and his
views of the coming battle.
The rally will begin at 7:30 and
it is necessary that every student
present a ticket secured from the Ad
ministration offices before admission
to the hall can be gained.
Coach Powell put the varsity
through the last hard workout last
night. All of the first string men were
out in uniform. Pelouze, Adams and
Deems auppeared for practice and al
though limping badly from injuries
are counted upon to start the game
in the respective positions.
"Dink" Templeton and "Art" Wil
cox furnished the bleacher rally at
tendants with a pretty exhibition of
punting. Then "Dink" dropped a few
choice kicks through the posts from
different angles about the field.
Following a scrimmage lasting more
than an hour Powell dismissed the
men. Tonight a light workout is the
I order and tomorrow the men will rest.
