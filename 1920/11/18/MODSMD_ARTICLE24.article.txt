# BON FIRE IGNITED BY TIME BOMB LEFT IN CENTER OF PILE
## 
### 
Two time incendiary bombs placed in
the bonfire nearly caused its destruc
tion early this morning, one of them
going off at 2:45 a. m., while the other
was discovered before the clockwork
had set it in motion. The first explo
sion shot a puff of flame up the entire
height of the stack, and the fire then
settled down to boring its way towards
the center of the pile. No water was at
hand, so members' of the guard tore out
the branches from the burning hole.
Everyone there threw handfuls and
shovelfuls of mud upon the blaze. For
a while it looked as though the con
flagration had gained too much headway
to be checked, but the mud battle staved
its onslaught until the arrival of fire
extinguishers from Encina put the fin
ishing touches to the work.
The bomb which started the fire con
sisted of an ordinary alarm clock in
closed in a small tin case filled with
magnesium and connectcd by wires to
two dry cells. When the time for which
the clock had been set arrived contact
was made and the bomb sent up a puff
of blue flame which quickly ignited the
excelsior and dry leaves that had been
packed around it.
A search was immediately made for
any other bomb that might be lurking
in the pile. Before long another one
was unearthed before it had time to go
off. The bombs were probably placed
many hours prior to the explosion and
set for the desired time.
