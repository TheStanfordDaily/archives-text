JT seems to be a recognized practice among the "dopesters" to forecast
a Stanford defeat and an overwhelming victory for California just
before the Big Game is about to happen. It cannot be denied that they
can always produce sufficient evidence to bear out their statements.
Stanford always seems to be in her poorest shape on the eve of the big
struggle, and California the pinnacle of her form. This year the sport
ing authorities point to injuries on the Stanford eleven, which undoubt
edly will handicap the Cardinal Varsity. They also point to the tremen
dous scores the Bruin Varsity has made in all of its games. St. Mary's
was beaten by an unheard-of score, the strong Oregon Agricultural
team was decisively defeated, and the Washington State combination,
reputed to be the strongest in the Northwest, was literally swamped
by the Bears.
And they can with equal truth, point to the mediocre showing that
Stanford made earlier in the season, when the Olympic Club and the
U. S. C. Trojans defeated me Cardinal. But they pause when they
come to the Oregon and Washington games, where Stanford surprised
them by defeating two of the strongest Conference teams. However,
California's showing against the other Conference universities over
shadows the Stanford successes, and the Blue and Gold emerges as a
strong favorite.
All of these conclusions are correct, and Stanford is content to
accept them. It has never been the practice here to announce to the
public that the Stanford Varsity is the best on the Coast'; that pleasure
is left until after the game. We cannot disprove in print the conclusions
drawn by the football experts from the season's scores, but we do leave
that task to the eleven men who represent Stanford against California,
feeling with the utmost confidence that they will make good.
