# PSYCHOLOGY AND RELIGION DO NOT CLASH IS CLAIM
## Professor G. M. Stratton of U. C. Claims Psychic Work Is Reverent 
### 
"The whole region of reverence and
supreme loyalty which make up the
dimension of appreciation outside the
scientific world is the field of re
ligion," said Professor G. M. Stratton
in answering the question "Where has
psychology left religion?" in his lec
ture in the Little Theater, last night.
Professor Strattion is head of the Psy
chology department at the University
of California, and is the author of a
number of books and articles on psy
chology. His talk was one of the seri
es of World Forum Problem lectures
being given by the Y. M. C. A.
Psychology, by its very nature as a
science is limited and the function
which is left to religion is to fill out
the regions unexplored by science,
Professor Stratton believes. There
are, he said, questions which can be
answered by no branch of science for
there are more things in life than
those with which science deals, and
religion finds its place in the extra
scientific world. Religion is there
fore capable of maintaining a balance
among the conflicting interests of life,
and this is its great contribution to
the life of cultured man. I
"If religion appeals to emotional life
and makes it sounder and more health
ful. then psychology in its study of the
emotions and the training of individu
als by its scientific laws has contri
buted something to the world',' Pro
fessor Stratton said, in explaining the
relation between psychology and re
ligion. One can find the roots of re
ligious life in mental life. The regu
larity of mind and its subjunction to
natural laws does not limit mental
life to scientific treatment, but mere
ly gives the foundation for religious
study, as part of the essentials in the
game of life.
In speaking of the recent activities
in psychic research, especially con
cerning life after death, and communi
cation with the dead, Professor Strat
ton said that although the discoveries
are of great interest to religion, and
the subject has proved worthy of stu
dy, religious life will not be funda
mentally affected even if it can be
proved scientifically â€¢ that there is an
other life. Communication with those
who have died would make a person
religious, he believes. Such a person
would be encouraged, but only if the
rudiments of religion were already in
his mind.
