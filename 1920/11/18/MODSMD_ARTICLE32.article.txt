## 
### 
Frederick Pelouze, met and defeated j
the varsity chess team, consisting of
ten men, simultaneously, last night in
the StanforcLUnion, by winning eight
games and drawing one out of ten
games played. J. P. Mandl, who won
the only game accredited to the var-|
sity team .was able to mate his oppon-1
ent after losing his queen, owing to
a slight miscalculation on the part of
Mr. Pelouze of'which Mandl took ad
vantage. It is conceded that Mr. Pe
louze's victory was assured, and it
was no disgrace to be defeated at the
hands of such a worthy player. An
thony played a draw with Mr. Pelouze
in the longest game of the tourna
ment which took two hours and fifty
minutes.
Mr. Pelouze is the Pacific Coast
Champion in correspondence Chess
and held the Illinois title in straight
chess. The remarkable skill which
he displayed last night shows him to
bo a player of the first rank in simul
taneous chess, for his attacks were
both precisive and decisive, showing
deep planning and analysis of posi
tions. The varsity team consisted of
Anthony, Richter, Mandl, Mueller,
Coblentz, Field, Mcintosh, Sullivan,
Easly, and Cole, all of whom are ex
perienced players. The tournament
was well attended by chess enthusi
asts and President Mueller, of Chess
Club, directed the games.
