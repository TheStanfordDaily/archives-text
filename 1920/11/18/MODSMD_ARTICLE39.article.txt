# DIAZ AND CARRANZA HEROES IN MEXICO
## 
### United Press 
MEXICO CITY, Nov. 18.—Mexico
has no hall of fame in which to display
her heroes—heroes who are never
deemed such until they are dead. But
there are half a dozen vendors of plaster
of paris statuettes, men who wend their
way through the capital's streets, dis
playing their wares on the sidewalks.
Not only do they set the style in heroes,
as they place a new bust on the market
from time to time, but they provide an
interesting insight into the fickle reac
tions of a revolutionary public.
A year or so ago there appeared the
plaster likeness of Don Porfirio Diaz, the
president whose overthrow raised the
nation-wide cry of revolutionary liberty.
Don Porfirio's bust found a ready sale.
He is a hero now. There have been
many revolutions since Don Porfirio's
time. The other day the statue vendors
placed a new bust on the sidewalk. The
face was familiar, as the original had
been one of the best-hated men in Mex
ico. There were whiskers, finally
moulded in the plaster. It was -Venus
tiano Carranza.
