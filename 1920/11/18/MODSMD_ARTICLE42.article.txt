### RALPH H. TURNER (United Press Staff Correspondent 
MEXICO CITY, Nov. 18.â€”Mexico's
newest bid for an increased inter
national commerce, represented by the
creation of "free zones" on both the
east and west coasts, has just become a
law. This movement, sponsored by Sec
retary of the Treasury Alvarado and
enacted into law by a decree over the
signature of President De la Huerta,
provides that Guaymas and Salina Cruz,
on the west coast, and Puerto Mexico,
the east, shall be converted into free
ports.
According to its official backers, the
project will stimulate manufacturing
within Mexico, at the same time pro
moting the country's foreign trade.
During the discussion of the proposition,
heavy opposition was aroused. Many of
the opponents declared the idea was im
practical and simply represented the de
sire of certain government leaders to
promote their private interests. Regard
less of its merits, however, the project
is interesting because of its proposed
relation to the commerce of North and
South America, as well as Europe and
Asia.
The central idea of ihe plan has been
directed toward utilizing the narrow
strip of territory known as the Isthmus
of Tehauntepec, which is traversed
through the. States of Vera Cruz and
Oaxaca by the Tehauntepec Railway,
with Salina Cruz and Puerto Mexica as
its termini. Mexican officials assert that
by converting both of these cities into
free ports, the isthmus can- be made a
center of foreign trade in the Western
Hemisphere, second only to the Panama
Canal. Thus, by the terms of the law,
free zones will be established surround
ing the ports, customs formalities will
be suspended, and merchandise which
is in transit, or which is to be re
exported outside the country, will be
admitted free of duty.
The officials believe that the zones
will then serve as assembling places for
raw materials which may be turned into
manufactured products within the zones,
thus upbuilding national industry. The
Tehauntepec Railway, it is hoped, will
serve as a logical medium for the tran
sit and distribution of merchandise be
tween North and South America and
Europe and the Orient. Bonded ware
he jses will form one feature of the
new program.
Guaymas, it is pointed out, also has
been made a free port because its loca
tion in the Gulf of California, in the
northern State of Sonora, gives it a
position of vantage with respect to
North American and Asiatic commerce.
Guaymas also is the southern terminus
of "the Southern Pacific Railway of
Mexico, which would be expected to
transport raw products from north
western Mexico, developing Guaymas as
a manufacturing and exporting center.
The decree provides that the free
ports of Salina Cruz and Puerto Mexico,
as well as the Tehauntepec Railway, be
placed under the administration of a
single board of directors, to be named
by the government.
