## 
### 
"Mental Hygiene" is the title of a!
book published recently by Dr. Lillien
J. Martin, Professor Emeritus of the
University. Dr. Martin was for years
a professor in the psychology depart
ment tand is at present a consulting
psychologist in San Francisco.
The book is a reflection of "two
years' experience of a clinical psy
chologist." The author writes as a
pioneer, since the profession of a con
sulting psychologist is practically new.
She has been engaged in psychplogic
al work since graduating from Vassar
and receiving degrees from the Uni
versity of Gottingen and the Uni
versity of Bonn. Besides a great deal
of teaching experience, Dr. Martin has
traveled in Europe and has made psy
chological studies there. It was after
receiving a pension from the Carnegie
Fund for Professors that Dr. Martin
retired from active work as an in
structor at Stanford and began the
new work which she has made the
subject of her book.
The most important thing in the
new psychology, according to Dr.
Martin, is not to teach grownups how
to escape their own ills, but to teach
them to train the coming generations.
Dr. Martin devotes a great deal of
her attention to the subject of chil
dren.
The close relation between the phy
sical and the mental is repeatedly em
phasized in the volume. Dr. Martin
makes her subject especially interest
ing by discussing many of her own
cases and explaining how she deals
with them.
