# VARSITY SOCCER TEAM WILL MEET BRUINS SATURDAY
## Captain Harvey Newland Is Confident of Vivtory Over U. C. Crowd 
### 
Soccer's seasonal climax comes on
Saturday morning at Berkeley when
the Stanford varsity team meets Cali
fornia's best men in a fight that gives
indications of being a fiercely fought
and a close one. Captain Harvey New
land will lead his men into battle con
fident that the Blue and Gold war
riors will not be able to stem the
rush of the Cardinals, who have gone
through the soccer season so far this
year with a splendid record, number
ing among their victims the strong
Olympic Club team.
Coach Harry Maloney reports that
the team is in very good shape as far
as condition of the men is concerned,
as the squad has been fortunate so
far in its freedom from injuries. The
team has been faithfully practicing
every afternoon on the local field
under the direction of Coach Maloney,
and if work counts for anything, they
should be in the best possible shape
for the game Saturday.
This year's team is unique in that
from the wealth of material that
showed up, have been found several
capable men for each position.. This
permits of shifting around and trying
a number of different combinations
until the right one is finally hit upon,
and also makes the bugaboo of in
jury to a star player less menacing.
Teamwork has been developed to a
high degree, and every man has rea
lized that he has been holding 011 to
his job only so long as he puts forth
the best that is In him.
With all these favorable conditions
confronting the team, Stanford should
look forward to the coming game not
necessarily with a feeling of sure con
fidence, but with a realization of the
fact that the Cardinal soccer outfit is
just as good, if not decidedly better
than the Blue and Gold team. Sheer
slass, plus, the ever-present Stanford
spirit, should sound the funeral march
for California's soccer hopes Satur
day morning, and finish up the suc
cessful season of Stanford's team with
the best victory of all.
