# TICKET SCALPERS ARE SUSPENDED BY MEN'S COUNCIL
## Students Warned That Drastic Measures Will Be Taken to Stamp Out Any Abuses 
### 
D. H. Riddcll, '23, and E. G. Frost,
'22, were suspended from the University
for a week in accordance with action
taken by the Men's Council this morn
ing for scalping Big Game tickets. They
were also put on probation as to con
duct until June, which means denial
of participation in college activities. The
Graduate Managers of the two universi
ties and the Alumni Secretary have
blacklisted the two men, denying them
the privilege of buying Big Game tickets
any time in the future.
This is the first result of a compre
hensive plan to stamp out scalping. It
has been announced from the office of
the Graduate Manager that in accord
ance with the expressed sentiment of the
student body against scalping of Stan
ford-California football game tickets,
and under the agreement with the Uni
versity of California, which formed a
part of the application envelope system,
a campaign against scalpers has been
launched.
The apprehension of these two stu
dents has led to the discovery of a
number of other men implicated in
scalping operations. Beginning today a
staff of men will work under the direc
tion of the Graduate Managers of the
two universities on both campuses and
in San Francisco in an effort to loeate
further signs of illegal ticket sales.
Warning to ticket scalpers was first
issued by the Executive Committee last
year, when it was announced that dis
ciplinary action would be taken by the
Men's Council in all such cases. The
matter cas given publicity in college
papers and magazines, and was the sub
ject of sufficient public discussion to
give due warning to all college students.
The rules connected with the purchase
of tickets were printed on the applica
tion envelopes this year, and at the time
of purchase each buyer signed a pledge
not to sell tickets for more than the
purchasing price. Graduate Manager E.
R. Martin announces that the publicity
given the matter before the apprehension
of the two students justifies a severe
stand. In years past ticket scalping has
been one of the greatest evils connected
with the Big Game, and Martin hopes
to eradicate it this year for all time.
Professional ticket scalpers have in the
past secured enough admission cards to
enable them to sell at an enormous
profit.
