# COACH POWELL'S STAR ELEVEN ALTHOUGH WEAKENED BY INJURIES "WILL BATTLE WITH BLUE AND GOLD
## Kicking and Forward Passes Will Be Cardinal's Strongest Bet 
### 
Stanford and California will meet tomorrow afternoon for the football classic
of the West during the 1920 season. When the two rival elevens run out on the
California Field thirty thousand rooters will rise to their feet with enthusiasm.
Special bleacher stunts have been arranged for by the yell leaders of the two
universities.

The Blue and Gold team will enter t
of confidence, having gone through thei
Cardinal eleven will commence play in tl
Stanford "fighting spirit," every man re;
has a powerful eleven that will force
ounce of strength and football knowledt
According to all prevalent football
dope, California is picked to win to
morrow's contest. Every piece of sport
ing dope seems to point to a Bruin vic
tory. Stanford has shattered Old Man
Dope's predictions through the present
season. Can the Varsity spring another
surprise in the battle with the Califor
nia team ? Time alone can tell who is
to be the winner of the football scrim
mage.
Both coaches are planning to run their
men through light signal work this aft
ernoon, giving the players a rest before
the battle. Yesterday afternoon the men
were put through a strenuous workout.
Stanford's main hopes will lay in the
strong aerial attack that Coach Powell
has been working on during the past
few weeks. Forward passes and kick
ing will be the special features of the
game that the Cardinal players will pro
duce. The present condition of the
weather will greatly handicap the play
ing of both elevens. Even though the
wet field would hinder the work of the
Blue and Gold team, it would ruin the
chances of Stanford playing a success
ful aerial game.
Kicking will be a Stanford specialty.
"Dink" Templeton is puting over sixty
yards and may do considerably better in
a pinch. Captain "Art" Wilcox is send
ing the ball nearly as far as the famed
kicker.
Then there is Jack Patrick. Jack is
no mean kicker either. He did the
Cardinal kicking before Templeton
joined the squad this season. Powell
will likely start Patrick at full back.
Bob Shlaudemati has been playing a
good game at quarterback all season,
and there is no reason to doubt but that
Powell will start him in the same posi
tion against the Bruins.
Though the coach probably will start
the above backfield he also has Paul
Campbell and Paul Woollomes in re
serve. Campbell has not been in first
rate condition during the past week due
to injuries ,but he can be used in an
Woollomes has shown up
very well in the last few games when he
was sent in to relieve Patrick at full
back.
While the backfield is in fairly good
shape the same cannot be said for the
line. Both Bob Pclotize, left end, and
Fred Adams at right, have been forced
to ease up on the training during the
past week on account of injuries. Pe

there is a strong possibility that he will
be in shape for tomorrow's fray. Adams
is not seriously injured and should get
into the game.
To fill the gaps at end if his regu
lars are unable to play, Powell has
"Rab" Shlaudcman and "Kewpie"
Sproull in reserve. Shlaudcman held
down the right end position early in the
season. Sproull was a member of last
year's freshman team. He has been a
backfield reserve on the Varsity.
Bob Cravens has held down the left
guard job efficiently all season and like

Dick Pershing, as usual, will be found
at right tackle. Dick was out of the
game last week with an attack of boils,

prove a big stumbling block for the
Bruins.
"Red" McAlpine probablv will play left

available for this job.

Righter. Righter is undoubtedly the
best center on the Pacific Coast, and he
has been mentioned for the job on the
all-American eleven. Righter is in good

Dick Pershing, as usual, will be found
at right tackle. Dick was out of the
game last week with an attack of boils,

prove a big stumbling block for the
Bruins.

available for this job.

According to all prevalent football
dope, California is picked to win to
morrow's contest. Every piece of sport
ing dope seems to point to a Bruin vic
tory. Stanford has shattered Old Man
Dope's predictions through the present
season. Can the Varsity spring another
surprise in the battle with the Califor

to be the winner of the football scrim
mage.
Both coaches are planning to run their
men through light signal work this aft
ernoon, giving the players a rest before
the battle. Yesterday afternoon the men
were put through a strenuous workout.
Stanford's main hopes will lay in the
strong aerial attack that Coach Powell
has been working on during the past
few weeks. Forward passes and kick
ing will be the special features of the
game that the Cardinal players will pro
duce. The present condition of the
weather will greatly handicap the play
ing of both elevens. Even though the
wet field would hinder the work of the
Blue and Gold team, it would ruin the
chances of Stanford playing a success

Kicking will be a Stanford specialty.

yards and may do considerably better in
a pinch. Captain "Art" Wilcox is send

kicker.
Then there is Jack Patrick. Jack is
no mean kicker either. He did the
Cardinal kicking before Templeton
joined the squad this season. Powell
will likely start Patrick at full back.
Bob Shlaudemati has been playing a
good game at quarterback all season,

Powell will start him in the same posi
