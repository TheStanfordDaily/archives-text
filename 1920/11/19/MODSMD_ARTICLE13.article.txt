# NOW THE BIG GAME
## 
### 
THE stage is set. The Varsity has finished its training, Coach Powell
has pronounced his men fit, Andy Smith says the Golden Bear will rule
the West, and the Stanford student body has given vent to its enthusiasm
in the rally and bonfire. Nothing is left but the game, and tomorrow
will see the Stanford side filled with expectant rooters, waiting to see
the wearers of the red triumph over the men that carry the Gold and
Blue. Despite all of the gloomy predictions, The Daily Palo Alto is
confident that the end of the big battle will see Stanford the victor.
Whatever the result of the game, tomorrow will see the best team
that Stanford can produce lining up-against the California eleven. It
represents Stanford, and as a Stanford team, it will receive the full
backing of Stanford people. Last night showed beyond doubt what the
sentiment of the student body is. Win or lose, Stanford is behind her
Varsity eleven.
The Varsity will go to Berkeley in a crippled condition, but it will
not be the first Stanford team that has entered the Big Game under
handicaps. Stanford Spirit, which is so great a part of Stanford and
her teams, will be with the Varsity when it lines up against the Bear
team, and its presence will more than offset advantages that California
possesses. 1
