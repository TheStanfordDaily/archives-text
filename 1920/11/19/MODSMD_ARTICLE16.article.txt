# "BEST TEAM WINS" SAYS BOB PELOUZE

### 
"The best team wins. Stanford is
going into that game Saturday, every
man fighting as he never fought before,
and with Coach Powell's excellent
coaching behind them, along with that
famous Stanford spirit, there is no
reason in the world why Stanford
shouldn't be the best team and win."
