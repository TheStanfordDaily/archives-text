"I am an old hand around Stanford,
having been here for thirteen years,
and have seen many teams play," said
Coach Maloney yesterday. "They have
never been found wanting at the crucial
moment. Stanford men always arise to
the occasion. Personally, I think Walter
Powell's coaching will show itself on
the Berkeley Field between 2:30 and 5
o'clock Saturday afternoon, and that the
results will surprise many of us."
