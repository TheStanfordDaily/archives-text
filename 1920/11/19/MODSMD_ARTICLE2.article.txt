# ENTHUSIASM REIGNS SUPREME DURING BONE AND RALLY
## Rooters Give Gridiron Warriors Final Sendoff Before Big U. C. Scrimmage 
### 
Stanford students gave final vent to
all of their pent-up enthusiasms at a
great football rally held in the Assem
bly Hall, and after howling themselves
hoarse proceeded to the huge bonfire
behind Encina, where they serpentined
and continued to yell. It was a wonder
ful demonstration of Stanford enthu
siasm and spirit.
Yell Leader Wendell Kinney and his
assistants, Bob Connolly and Lester
Scib, were in charge of the rally when
ever they could be heard. Their large
job was controlling the mob long enough
to introduce the speakers.
George Pressley, '07, spoke to the as
sembly as the first alumni representa
tive. Pressley told of the days of
preparation and playing in football con
tests during his stay in the university.
He expressed every confidence in the
ability of the 1920 Varsity to down the
men across the bay. He remarked that
the spirit evident in the rally was the
same old spirit that he had known dur
ing his undergraduate days, and said
he was sure that the spirit had grown
some since that time, if SEich a thing
were possible.
Chris Bradley jollied the crowd along
with trse comments on occurrences at
Stanford past and present, and kept the
rooters in good humor for ten minutes
or more. Bradley is a '99 man and was
a former editor of the Quad. He was
a crony of Will and Wallace Irwin and
Charley Field, forming with them a
quartet that was noted for its wit and
pranks during their college days.
Captain Art Wilcox, on behalf of the
team, expressed the opinion that Stan

ford spirit would be the deciding factor
of the game. Believing that Stanford's
ability at passing, together with Temple
ton and his much-touted toe, will more
than offset California's plunging backs,
he expressed a belief that Stanford's
lighting characteristics would decide the
game in favor of the Cardinal.
Coach Powell came through with a
fiery talk in which he eulogized the men
on the team, classing them as the finest
and hardest-working bunch of fellows
that he had ever coached. He expressed
every confidence in the ability of the
men and promised fight every minute.
Powell explained that although three of
the men were injured, they would start
in the contest, and that he would place
a team in the field with the fullest
fighting strength possible.
"Dad"' Moulton, who has been a figure
in Stanford athletics for many years,
and who has probably trained more var
sities than any other man on the coast,
gave his opinion of Stanford's chances.
"Dad" opined that this varsity will put
up the same battle that Stanford teams
have in the past, giving all that they
have, to win from the Bruin team.
Following the rally in the Assembly
Hall the crowd moved over to the field
behind Encina, where a huge bonfire had
been built by the freshmen. The pyre
which supported a huge coffin bearing a
large gold "C" was already a mass of
flames when the students, bent on ser
pentining, reached the scene. It burned
for more than an hoEir, while students,
already hoarse from their workout in
the Assembly Hall, circled the fire and
tried their best to make themselves heard
across the bay.
