Robert Lyman ("Dink") Templeton
needs no introduction to campus read
ers for he has appeared in one or two
Big Game editions before. Temple
ton is the most feared man on the

Stanford varsity. Football fans up
and down the coast formerly regarded
"Dink" as a mighty hooter hut didn't
hand him much in other offensive
lines. This season "Dink" has caused
them all to open their eyes by his
clever open field running in handling
punts and in going around the ends
for gains. "Dink" may be counted
on to drop a couple through the white
posts before the contest with the
Bruins is over. He rates as one of the
greatest "psychological moment" ath
letes in the sport world today. Ho
always comes through in the pinch.
Templeton claims, Downey, Cali
fornia as his home town when he is
at home. He is 2G years old and his
weight is 340 lbs. Dink is a member
of Encina Club and The Breakers. Ho
claims one year of previous experience
in the American game, having played
fullback on tho 1919 varsity.

of his long punts on its way. His
"educated toe" has been a big fac
tor in the success of the Cardinal
this year and should be much in
evidence in the Big Game.
