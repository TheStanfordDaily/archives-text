# J. E. (Jack) Patrick
## 
### 
When Stanford needs yards and
needs them badly, call on Jack Pat
rick. Tn the Big Game last year Pat
rick was largely responsible for the

Cardinal fifty yards of gains in the
last four minutes of play, taking the
ball from the middle of the field to
the Blue and Gold four yard line.
"Pat" is an old rugby star, but play
ed with the Stanford S. A. T. C.
American football team, as well as
last year's varsity. He is a Delta
Upsilon and lives in Palo Alto. He
is 21 years old and weighs 183 pounds.


Jack Patrick is no mean kicker him
self. Jack has been the varsity
mainstay at fullback.
