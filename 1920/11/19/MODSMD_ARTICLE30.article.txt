# Paul Wollomes

### 
Wollomes is a possobility for the
Big Game. He plays a hard bucking
game at either half back or offensive
full. Sometimes during the struggle
tomorrow Wollomes will work against
the Bears. He came to Stanford from
Whittier to study Economics. He is
a Sigma Nu. When Wollomes is
given the ball the opposing team is
made to feel every ounce of the
plunging back fielder's 165 pounds of
weight. He is 24 years old.
