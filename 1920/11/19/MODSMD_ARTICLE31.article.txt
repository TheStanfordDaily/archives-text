# Dave Levy
## 
### 
Dave Levy plays right guard which
is the same position he filled, on the
1919 varsity. Levy is rated as one of
the best guards in this section today.
Running over Levy isn't being done
this season by any of them. He is
a handy man to "Swede" Righter at
center, and stacks up well with "Bob"
Cravens who acts in like capacity on
the ohter side of center. This trio
forms the stonewall defense of the
Cardinal and are not a bit backward
in opening holes for the backs when
offensive play is the order.
Levy comes from Prescott, Arizona.
He weighs 189 lbs., and is 24 years
of age. Levy is a member of Encina
Club, and his major subject is chem
istry.
