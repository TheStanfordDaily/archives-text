# Reserve Players
## 
### 
Frank "Kewp" Sproull, Dudley
"Dud" DeGroot, Charles Helser, "Bob"
Stice, Hawley Mertz, and Larry Rice
form the vanguard of Coach Powell's
reserves. All are players of proven
ability and are counted on to get into
that, combat before i tis many min
utes old.
Sproull plays either end and also fits
into the backfleld. He hails from
Pasadena and is a member of Beta
Theta Pi. DoGroot and Helser play
the goard positions and have taken
part in a number of the preliminary
season games. Both were members
of last year's freshman eleven. Haw
ley Mertz plays in the backfleld and
although a trifle light for these po
sitions is regarded as a comer. Bob
Stice plays goard. He was a member

of last years varsity. Larry Rice is
substitute center and played this po
sition in the first three games of the
preliminary season. Although he is a
trifle inexperienced in this position
lie is regarded as a good prospect and
may be used against California.
Helscr DeGroot, and Rice are Sig
ma Nus. Stice is a member of Phi
Kappa Sigma and Mertz is a Beta.
