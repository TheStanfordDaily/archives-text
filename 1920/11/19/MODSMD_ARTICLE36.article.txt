# JACK JAMES PRAISES COACH POWELL'S WORK
## Examiner Sports Editor Says It Will Take Seven Years to "Make" American Team 
### JACK JAMES 
(Sporting Editor The Examiner)
Whatever space is allotted me I fain
would use in expressing my opinion—
and the opinion of every other San
Francisco newspaper man, I believe —of
Walter Powell.
Stanford—particularly the undergrad
uates thereof—cannot fully realize what
trials and tribulations the varsity coach
has met and hitherto conquered in his
labors down on the Farm this season
of 1920.
Some, lacking this realization, may
howl for his scalp following the game
next Saturday. Some may shout to high
heaven that "the team wasn't coached"
or "a good man would have seen that
the stars weren't hurt," or some such
futility.
But don't overlook this fact: Walter
Powell has taken a small squad of men,
a scant half dozen or so of whom had
ever handled an American football be
fore, and with that small squad he has
fought his way to a win over two north
ern colleges, thereby putting Stanford
on even terms with the conventional
enemy, California, for the championship
of the Pacific Coast Conference. All
this in the second year of Stanford's
American style pastiming.
Folks, that takes craft. That takes
infinite patience. That deserves a heap
of admiration.
Walter Powell is one he-man and a
perfectly capable football coach. Don't
forget that, no matter what the result
of the Large Contest Saturday.
What will that result be? Well, now —
Don't take what follows for Blue and
Gold propaganda. Though it may sound
as such.
In the opinion of yours humbly, Stan
ford has not a chance to beat California.
Coach Powell said as much the other
day. Had it been the coach of 1919, one
might expect some wily and foxy mo
tive behind it all. Something to put the
opposition off guard, so to speak.
But that's not Powell's style. He
comes clean. He talks frankly with a
man —even a newspaper man.
That's the way it stands.
Sons of the Stanford Red, you can't
expect to have a winning football team
two short years after throwing old man
Rugby into the ash heap. It just can't
be clone.
Look at it coolly and logically. Did
California have any shucks of a team
until this year? No. How long has
California been playing the American
game? This is the sixth season.
California has four years' jump on
Stanford. And during those four ycais
high school athletes graduated from
schools where American football is the
main event have been flocking to Cali
fornia. Stanford has been getting the
rugby remnants.
It will take Stanford a few years more
to get into California's class. In every
other particular Stanford is right now.
In football—not.
Stanford alumni must learn to go out
in the highways and byways and look
with critical eye on the high school foot
ball players. No reason why these chaps
should all go to California. California
was lucky to get her share of high
school material in my day. I partici
pated in just one serpentine during my
generation, as I remember. Now Cali
fornia is getting them all.
And until Stanford reaches out and
acquires some, Stanford athletic prestige
will suffer.
The Stanford teams have a habit of
doing the unexpected. The football team
has been doing just that' all season.
But this time the Stanford Varsity
will be unable to get away with the un
expected.
Fight—of course Stanford will fight.
But the fight will be something as if,
say, one of our four-round champions
were to go up against Jack Dempsey—
somewhat abortive. California will catch
most of the punches and then slip over
a right cross and someone will be count
ing up to ten.
This docs look like "Blue and Gold
propaganda," doesn't it? But it's an
honest expression of opinion. Run'it or
throw it out. Mister Editor, and may
you be placed in a similar position some
of these days with the circumstances
reversed".
