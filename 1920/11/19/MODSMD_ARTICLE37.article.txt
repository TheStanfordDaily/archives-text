# STANFORD WILL PLAY BEST GAME TOMORROW IS BROWNE'S BELIEF
## 
### 
"California at the very beginning of
the season had a perfectly working ma
chine through having a large number
of experienced veterans from the last
two years and a strong last year's fresh
man team supplying experienced play
ers. Its large stal'f of coaches went to
work on finished material and a per
fectly running machine is the result.
"In football there is something in
tangible—some call it spirit—that, counts
for more than experience or knowledge.
"Stanford was handicapped at the
start of the season and played several
games under adverse conditions. The
coaches and the whole community have
been trying to make the team more than
a machine—something that won't break
down. A team that gains strength as
the game continues—and ends with a
whirlwind finish, carrying the opponents
off their feet—as happened last year and
other years against California.

Director of Physical Training.
