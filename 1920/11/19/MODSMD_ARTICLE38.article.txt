# CALIFORNIA FAR FROM CONFIDENT SAYS U. C. EDITOR
## Looks For Hard Fight Between Strongest Elevens on Pacific Coast This Year 
### M. F. YORK

California's Varsity, through its last
workout, expectantly awaits the coming
of Stanford and the annual Big Game.
For weeks the Blue and Gold has been
praised to the skies and touted by some
to be the best eleven on the coast, for
weeks the critics have predicted a sure
defeat for Stanford, and it is this that
California faces in the Cardinal tomor
row. There is no optimism on Cali-

fornia's part, it is the realization of the
fact that they must come through and
win.
It is with a clean record that the
Bruin eleven faces Stanford. Coach
Andy Smith, with the assistance of
Rosenthal and Price, has turned out a
strong team and it has had hut little
trouble in turning back Nevada, Utah,
the Oregon Aggies and Washington
State. Stanford only remains.
Smith will send Erb, Sprott. Toomey
and Morrison into the backfield to start
the crucial game. In Erb at quarter he
has a clever tnan on both the offense and
defense and a brilliant field general.
Sprott at half is going in the same form

that characterized his playing in 1918,
and he can be depended upon at any
time for the needed few yards. Toomey,
the other half, has developed greatly
from last year and has starred /all
year, although lie is not the steady, con
sistent player that his running mate is.
Morrison is a new addition to the Cali
fornia squad and has made good from
the very start. He is a capable kicker
and a heavy line-plunger who knows
how to hit the line.
On the line there will he Berkey and
Muller at ends, forming a very strong
combination, especially on the defense.
At tackles there are McMillan and
Dean, who have played all season, and
at guard there arc Cramncr and Cap
tain Majors. Both of these men played
tackle last year, hut this year were
shifted to guard to make room for the
other men. Latham is a veteran and a
fixture at center. For all of these posi
tions there are capable substitutes, sub
stitutes who arc in many cases as good
as the regulars.
There are many obstacles to be faced
in the Cardinal Varsity. "Dink" Tem
pleton has to be overcome, for although
lie has very little chance of making ten
yards at any time through the line, his
toe will always be a source of strength
in time of danger. Then, too, Stanford
is lighter and faster, and with an open
aerial game is exceedingly dangerous.
Finally, but not least, the Cardinal can
always be relied upon for the unex
pected, and no matter what the odds
may be the game cannot be any walk
away on either side.
May the best team win. That team
will play at Pasadena and have the
honor of again meeting the Fast on the
gridironâ€”to avenge the defeat of Ore
gon at the hands of Harvard last year.


Capt. "Cort" Majors of the Bruin
eleven has been one of the best
players on Andy Smith's aggregation
of footballers this year.


"Pesky" Sprott's speed has been one
of the reasons the Blue and Gold
eleven has been successful thus far
this season.
