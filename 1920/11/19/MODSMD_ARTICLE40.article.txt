# STANFORD'S FIGHTING SPIRIT MAY SURPRISE BRUIN 'WONDER TEAM'

With the same grim determination
and bulldog tenacity which marked the
lighting of Uncle Sam's now famous
Second Division along the Paris-Met?:
road at Belleau Wood and Vaux during
the late lamented conflict abroad, Stan
ford's Cardinal gridiron warriors, in
command of Captain "Art" Wilcox, will
swing into brittle formation against the
Blue and Gold Bruins at Berkeley Field
on Saturday afternoon.
Willi "their backs to the wall" the
"Indian-Heads," as they were affec
tionately calkd by their buddies in other
divisions at the front, held "the line'
and followed up with a terrific barrage
and advanced with the Huns in retreat.
Stanford faces the same sort of situa
tion Saturday afternoon when she faces
California's "wonder team." Powell has
given orders to his men "to hold the
line." Will they emulate the famous
Second Division and advance over the
ehalkline instead of into "No Man's
Land," as did the tin-derbied lads over
seas ?
Will the Cardinal's fighting spirit,
coupled with the uncanny kicking of one
"Dink" Templeton, hold the Calif or
nians?
Will a tow-headed youth named
Righter, also known as "Swede," hold
down the pivotal position at center and
pass the leather "egg" with the same
brilliant accuracy that has marked his
playing during the present season ?
And how about the Shlaudeman broth
ers, Boh and "Rab"? Will they, too,
show up as well against the highly
touted Bruins?
While it seems as if a victory for
California is inevitable, Stanford is

sure to put up a fight that will long
be remembered in the annals of the
national college sport on the Pacific
slope. It is traditional with the sons of
the Cardinal Red to fight whether the
odds be in their favor or against them.
And some times, it is said, the Car
dinal gridmen play a more brilliant
game when it's an uphill fight.
Andy Smith, California's head grid
coach, in a recent interview said: "It
is perfectly absurd for one to think
California will win from Stanford by
five or six touchdowns. It will be a
close game."
And so it will.
