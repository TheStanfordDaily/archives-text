# CROSS COUNTRY AND SOCCER ON SPORTS PROGRAM
## Teams Will Leave Campus Early Tomorrow to Enter the Preliminary Contests 
### 
Soccer and cross-country will both
stage their big events of the season to
morrow morning up at Berkeley as the
Stanford teams match their strength and
skill against the best men that Cali
fornia can furnish in opposition. Cap
tain Harvey Newland will lead the Var
sity soccer team tomorrow morning at
10 o'clock on the California soccer field
in the first clash of a two-game series
with California. Cross country hopes
rest on the men that Captain Haskell is
taking up with him to compete with the
Blue and Gold team.
California's soccer team is destined to
taste the cup of defeat tomorrow if
there is anything in the dope, although it
is conceded that they have a well-work
ing combination that will call forth
Stanford's best efforts. Coach Harry
Maloney, however, believes that in the
present soccer varsity, Stanford has the
strongest outfit that has ever been got
ten together under the banner of the
Cardinal since the famous "wrecking
machine" of 1914 that mowed down op
position with grand sweeps. The team
work is excellent, especially because of
the fact that nine out of the eleven were
members of last year's team and un
derstand the erame well. Injuries have
not depleted the ranks, and even in that
case there are a number of substitutes
who should make good if put to the
test.
The men individually have shown
themselves ready for the fray. Captain
Newland, playing goal, is a star player
and is a great source of strength to
the machine that Maloney has developed
since the season started. Gorman and
Robinson playing left half and center
half, respectively, make a good combi
nation. A feature of the team is the
combination work of the forward line,
which has plenty of speed and has shown
comendable accuracy in shooting. Green,
Strauss, Mendosa, Peavv, and Clark are
all men who will cause California's team
a lot of trouble. Adams and Anderson
in the back positions arc players with
a good knowledge of the game, and
Wing. Gorman, and Robinson at right,
left, and center half should give the
Blue and Gold something to worry
about with their smooth teamwork.
Stanford and California soccer teams
have met in ten scries, since the first
agreement to clash, and Stanford has a
big edge, having won six, lost two, and
tied two. There arc two games in each
year's series. The second game of this
season will take place on the Stanford
field on December 4.
The line-up for tomorrow's battle is
as follows:
Captain Newland. goal; Adams, right
back; Anderson, left back; Wing, right
half; Gorman, left half; Robinson, cen
ter half; Green, outside right; Struss,
inside right; Mendosa, center forward;
Peavv. inside left; Geo. Clark, outside
Langford and TTavs, backs; Titus, half
left. Reserves: Masters, goal keeper;
back; Mead, forward.
No less fiercely contested than the
soccer game will be the cross-country
event between Stanford and California.
Fourteen men will form the Stanford
team that will oppose the U. C. outfit.
Captain Haskell, Rousselot, and Elliot
are all in Rood condition, and in all
probability it will be these three men
who furnish the toughest opposi
tion to California. However, there are
several men on the Cardinal squad ca
llable of showing class when the crucial
moment of the race arrives, and Cali
fornia's runners have to face the fear
of a "dark horse" in the ranks of the
enemy who may upset the dope and
come in ahead. The teams seem to be
evenly matched, and a gruelling contest
is expected.
A new course for the event was picked
today by Coach Walter Christie of
California and Addie Westwick of Stan
ford, so the advantage of running over
a familiar course will be eliminated from
California's list of hopes. The Stan,
ford team will leave on the 7:15 train
tomorrow morning, in time to start the
race at 10:15. The finish of the event
will be in front of the bleachers on
California field.
