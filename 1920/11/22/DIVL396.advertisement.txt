Mrs. Fox was bragging one day about the large
number of her cubs.
''How many cubs do you bring into the world at
one time?" she asked the LIONESS.
"Only ONE," replied the Lioness —"but its a
LION."
MURADS COST 20XENTS for a BOX
of 10 —BUT THEY'RE MURADS!
MURADS would be lower priced if we left out
all or part of the 1 00% Turkish tobaccos of the purest
and be£t varieties grown —or if we substituted inferior
grades of Turkish tobacco.
But they wouldn't be MURADS —they'd only be
Foxes!'
"Judge for yourself —!"
