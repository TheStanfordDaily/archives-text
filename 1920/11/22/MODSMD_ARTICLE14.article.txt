# GREAT WAR VETERANS GET MEDALS TOMORROW
## Presentation of Discharges if Necessary to Obtain Victory Medal 
### 
Stanford veterans of the great war
will have a chance tomorrow to obtain
their Victory Medal here at the military
headquarters. All men who were in
service, either army or navy, between
the outbreak of the war on April 6,
1917, and the armistice, November 11.
1918, are eligible for this medal, and
the government is making every effort
to put the emblems in the hands of ail
ex-service men and women.
Up to the present about 2 per cent of
the army and navy have applied for
their medal, and the government is now
sending specially trained men around to
the various centers to interview the ex
service men and distribute the medals
with their appropriate bars.
To obtain the Victory Medal and the
accompanying bars the only thing neces
sary tomorrow is one's discharge, or
special order in case of an officer. If
two discharges arc at hand be sure to
bring the one that bears the latest date
and shows the entire service, because it
is from the data on the discharge that
the campaign bars will be issued for the
medal proper. A field celrk of the army
will be at the R. O. T. C. headquarters
in the gymnasium all day tomorrow and
longer if the number of applications
warrant a longer stay. He is a special
ist in this work and will do all the paper
work incident to the obtaining and dis
tribution of the medals. He is at the
base hospital in Palo Alto today, and
anyone wishing to go down there can do
so before tonight.
