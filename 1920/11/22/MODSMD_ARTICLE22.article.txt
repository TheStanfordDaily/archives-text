# BLUE AND GOLD FOOTBALL TEAM WINS PACIFIC COAST CONFERENCE SUPREMACY BY DEFEATING CARDINAL ELEVEN, 38-0
## Stanford Men Put Up Stiff Battle But Can Not Cope with More Experienced Machine 
### 
California is now the holder of the Pacific Coast Conference football title
by virtue of its decisive victory over Stanford in the "big game" last Satur
day, and is the logical contender to represent the West in New Year's game
at Pasadena. Five times the Blue and Gold warriors carried the ball past
the Stanford goal posts and once Toomey dropped the ball over the posts.
Stanford played a strong defensive game and fought hard to the finish,
but the red-jerseyed eleven was no match for the more experienced Amer
ican football players wearing the Bruin's colors. California is the past six
years after changing from Rugby have gradually been developing a strong
football machine, and at last can present an eleven that should hold its own
against any team.

Several alibis might be offered for
the defeat from the Bears, but Stan
ford is not in the habit of trying to
smother a defeat with excuses.
Throughout the season it was gener
ally admitted that California had the
better eleven, and that the lucky
breaks seems to fall to the other
team.
Coach Powell was handicapped dur
ing the last two weeks of practice
by the injuries to a number of his
first-string players. Then stacked
upon this, Cravens was forced out
of play at the last minute with an
attack of the mumps. But this is
neither here nor there. California pre
sented the strongest team and ran
off of the field carrying the laurels.
Tho breaks of the game seemed to
fall to the Berkeley men. California
fumbled the ball twice but recovered
the pigskin in both instances. Stan
ford fumbled the same number of
times but recovered only one of the
muffs. In forward passing there was
always a California man ready to in
tercept the Stanford pass. Again, a
light wind assisted by the condition
of the field helped to handicap the
kicking of Templeton.
Coach Powell and the Cardinal play
ers are to be commended for the
strong stand that the Stanford team
was able to make against the powerful
scoring machine of California. Every
man on the football field put £very
ounce of his strength into the game
even though it was apparent from the
time California first took the ball that
Saturday was destined as a California
day. The hard and clean cut drilling
of Coaches Powell and Carpenter was
in evidence throughout the play. Stan
ford made the strongest stand against
the Bears of any eleven on the Cali
fornia Field this season.
California depended in the iyiain on
straight football with several open
plays interspersed in the first three
periods. In the fourth period, with
the game won, the Blue and Gold
opened up and several successful long
forward passes paved the way for the
last touchdown, which were made
with many of the California positions
filled with substitutes.
California's most successful play
was a line-buck from a fake kick form
ation. Time after time Toomey,
Sprott and Deeds took the ball for sub
stantial gains through the Stanford
eleven, which seemed unable to
fathom the play.

Repeatedly large holes were opened
in the Stanford primary defense,
throuh which the California backs
plunged. California also gained con
sistently around end with the speedy
Sprott and Toomey carrying the ball.
California made the first kick-off
and Stanford fumbled, giving the
Bruins the ball on the 35-yard line.
Within four minutes the ball crossed
the goal line for the first touch. Later
in the same quarter Toomey made a
drop kick from the twenty-five yard
line.
Stanford held during the second
period of play, leaving the score 10
to 0 at the start of the third quarter.
In the last few minutes of this period
California made their total number
of points seventeen.
The California machine became too
much for the Cardinal eleven during
the fourth when three more touch
downs were added to (he total score.
Following the sounding of the final
gun the Blue and Gold adherents ser
pentined California Field jubilant over
the 38 to 0 victory.

day, and is the logical contender to represent the West in New Year's game
at Pasadena. Five times the Blue and Gold warriors carried the ball past
the Stanford goal posts and once Toomey dropped the ball over the posts.
Stanford played a strong defensive game and fought hard to the finish,
but the red-jerseyed eleven was no match for the more experienced Amer
ican football players wearing the Bruin's colors. California is the past six
years after changing from Rugby have gradually been developing a strong
football machine, and at last can present an eleven that should hold its own
against any team.

Several alibis might be offered for
the defeat from the Bears, but Stan
ford is not in the habit of trying to
smother a defeat with excuses.
Throughout the season it was gener
ally admitted that California had the
better eleven, and that the lucky
breaks seems to fall to the other
team.
Coach Powell was handicapped dur
ing the last two weeks of practice
by the injuries to a number of his
first-string players. Then stacked
upon this, Cravens was forced out
of play at the last minute with an
attack of the mumps. But this is
neither here nor there. California pre
sented the strongest team and ran
off of the field carrying the laurels.
Tho breaks of the game seemed to
fall to the Berkeley men. California
fumbled the ball twice but recovered
the pigskin in both instances. Stan
ford fumbled the same number of
times but recovered only one of the
muffs. In forward passing there was
always a California man ready to in
tercept the Stanford pass. Again, a
light wind assisted by the condition
of the field helped to handicap the
kicking of Templeton.
Coach Powell and the Cardinal play
ers are to be commended for the
strong stand that the Stanford team
was able to make against the powerful
scoring machine of California. Every
man on the football field put £very
ounce of his strength into the game
even though it was apparent from the
time California first took the ball that
Saturday was destined as a California
day. The hard and clean cut drilling
of Coaches Powell and Carpenter was
in evidence throughout the play. Stan
ford made the strongest stand against
the Bears of any eleven on the Cali
fornia Field this season.
California depended in the iyiain on
straight football with several open
plays interspersed in the first three
periods. In the fourth period, with
the game won, the Blue and Gold
opened up and several successful long
forward passes paved the way for the
last touchdown, which were made
with many of the California positions
filled with substitutes.
California's most successful play
was a line-buck from a fake kick form
ation. Time after time Toomey,
Sprott and Deeds took the ball for sub
stantial gains through the Stanford
eleven, which seemed unable to
fathom the play.

Repeatedly large holes were opened
in the Stanford primary defense,
throuh which the California backs
plunged. California also gained con
sistently around end with the speedy
Sprott and Toomey carrying the ball.
California made the first kick-off
and Stanford fumbled, giving the
Bruins the ball on the 35-yard line.
Within four minutes the ball crossed
the goal line for the first touch. Later
in the same quarter Toomey made a
drop kick from the twenty-five yard
line.
Stanford held during the second
period of play, leaving the score 10
to 0 at the start of the third quarter.
In the last few minutes of this period
California made their total number
of points seventeen.
The California machine became too
much for the Cardinal eleven during
the fourth when three more touch
downs were added to (he total score.
Following the sounding of the final
gun the Blue and Gold adherents ser
pentined California Field jubilant over
the 38 to 0 victory.
