Victory and the Pacific Coast Championship for California!
Honor and Glory to Stanford!
So read the opening lines of one of the reviews of the Big Game in
one of the San Francisco papers. In these words the story of the Big
Game is told. California truly earned the victory. She has a wonderful
football machine, and deserved to win.
But Stanford just as truly earns that praise: Honor and Glory. If
ever a Stanford team fought, Walter Powell's men did last Saturday,
and though they were badly defeated, the wearers of the Cardinal jerseys
covered themselves and the name of their University with honor. Going
up against a team that had been perfected in every detail, the Stanford
men never had a chance, but they, as well as the Stanford rooters, re
fused to admit that fact until the final gun sounded.
Stanford Spirit was in evidence. The eleven men fought an in
vincible team every inch of the way, and although outclassed as far as
football goes, the Stanford team outfought their opponents. There was
just as strong a battle going on in the Stanford rooting section. Out
siders claim that the Stanford section outrooted the Blue and Gold sup
porters, even though greatly outnumbered. It was a day of honor and
glory for Stanford, although one of\lefeat by score.
The result of the game showed beyond doubt that Stanford still is
young at American football and that two or three years more is needed
before a good team can be developed. Walter Powell did more than
could be expected with his team, and to him goes much praise for the
showing made by the team all during the season. The fact that Stan
ford was defeated by California does not detract from the season's
showing. Andy Smith has a \Vonderful te.4m, and it is no disgrace to be
defeated by such an eleven.
California justly earns the honor of representing the West at Pasa
dena, and all Stanford will be rooting for the Blue and Gold on New
Year's Day.
