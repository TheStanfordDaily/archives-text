# LARGE CROWD HEARS STANFORD GLEE CLUB IN SAN FRANCISCO
## 
### 
The largest crowd that has ever
gathered for a Sunday morning con
cert at the California theater in San
Francisco heard the Stanford Glee
Club yesterday morning. The men
were enthusiastically received and
were encored five times. The concert
is said to have been easily one of
the most successful ever given by
Stanford singers.
The concert numbers presented by
the men, under the direction of War
ren D. Allen, were "Nature's Adora
tion," by Beethoven; "Rise, Sleep No
More," by Stewart; and the "Viking
Song." They concluded by singing
"Hail, Stanford, Hail."
There were thirty-five voices in the
concert chorus.
