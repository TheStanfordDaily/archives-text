# Many Stanford People Attend Fairmont Dance
## 
### 
The Alumnae dinner dance at the
Fairmont Hotel, given under the aus
p])iccs of the San Francisco Alumnae
and the Men's and Women's
Council of Stanford University, after
the game Saturday night, was a decided
success. The purpose of the dinner was
to have a big reunion of the old and
new Stanford students. The old Spirit
was there in all its glory. Stanford
songs were sung at the different tables
and after the dinner the tables were
cleared away and the orchestra played
the different Stanford songs to
dance to.
The crowd was too large for the
dance hall, so couples crowded the large
porch off the hall and the corridors
around it. The dance broke up about 1
o'clock.
