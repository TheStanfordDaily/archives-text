Editor Daily Palo Alto:
We would like to express our sincere
appreciation of the wonderful hospital
ity and good sportsmanship which was
shown by the California men after the
game Saturday. The newly-found Cali
fornia spirit was first evidenced by a
continual razzing and hooting by the
California men when Stanford was sing
ing its Alma Mater on the fifcld after
the game. It was further shown at the
Varsity Candy Store corner, where a
mass of U. C. rooters crowded the side
walks and streets and by attempts at
underhand physical attacks and unmen
tionable jibes "and jeers heaped unbear
able insults on the passing Stanford men
on their way home, which led to a
greatly one-sided physical combat. Of
course, we understand that the very fact
that it was one-sided is the only reason
that these U. C. men were able to try
to show their new spirit in this way.
Nor did it cease here. Many Stanford
men who spent the night on the Berke
ley campus, because of attending social
functions there, were subject to insult
after insult from even the members of
the houses at which they were staying.
If this is the newly-found "California
Spirit" which "Brick" Morse so loudly
acclaims in his column, we can only sug
gest that a little lesson of true collcge
spirit should be obtained by a visit to
the farm before the fertile soil of Cali
fornia students too strongly absorbs
this new "stuff."
Here, at least, we are proud of our
hospitality which recognizes a guest and
treats him as such; which admires the
fighting spirit of a losing team and the
men who have backed it, and never fails
to show this appreciation by an observa
tion of at least the extension of courtesy
to its guests.
