## 
### 
Extravagances of formal dances held
on the campus at the University of Cali
fornia are being attacked by the Daily
Californian. The paper points out that
the expense of "Junior Day," celebrated
recently, totaled more than $18 for each
man.
The members of the Junior class have
resented the charge and say that only
in a few cases did the expenses go over
$10 a man. There is a general move
ment 011 the campus to cut down the
expense of all social affairs. Flowers
are now barred at all campus dances.
