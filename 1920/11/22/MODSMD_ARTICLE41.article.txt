PARIS, Nov. 22. —Scarcity of farm
labor is but one of the many problems
arising from the war which France
is seeking to solve and as a result food
prices continue high. So serious has
the situation become that large farm
owners have demanded that the Gov
ernment go into other countries in an
effort to secure workers who will re
main on the farms and provide food
for France. Acting on those requests
and with the consent of the Polish
Government this country has recently
established a farm-hand recruiting
mission in Warsaw.
The farmer-soldier of France suffer
ed heavily during the war, forming as
he did the bulk of the French armies.
The percentage of mortality among
the peasants was great, while wounds
rendered other thousands unfit for
service in the fields. Combined with
this was the bringing up the peasant
into contact with the life of the towns
and cities and the wages paid there
all of which before the war was noted
for its laige and industrious peasant
population.
Since the estbalishment of its farm
hand recruiting bureau in Warsaw 500
demands have been made upon the
Government for this imported labor
and it has already begun transport
ing 3,600 farm workers to this coun
try, all of whom sign contracts to re
main on the farm for a certain period.
To further their contentment and ef
ficiency the Government also contracts
to bring their families with them and
to house them.
