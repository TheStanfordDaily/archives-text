# JURYWOMEN ASK LEAVE TO COOK HUSBAND'S DINNER

### United Press 
LONDON, Nov. 22. â€” Women's
waverings between love and duty as
revealed in their service as jurors are
making magistrates scratch their gray
wigs.
At Bath Quarter Sessions, the first
case to be tried by a mixed jury of
men and women progressed splendidly
until the court adjourned for lunch.
The magistrate ordered the trial to be
resumed at 2 o'clock. A woman juror
at once rose and protested: "I cannot
get home and back in time, because I
have to look after my husband."
The magistrate gallantly extended
the interval a quarter of an hour.
At another Quarter Sessions, the
whole court was startled out of its
usual calm when two men arrived at
12 o'clock, interrupted the proceedings
and asked that their wives who were
serving on the jury might be allowed
to "come homi and cook the dinner."
The women, with tears in their eyes,
watched their husbands turned away,
doomed to hunger as an alternative
to bread and cheese, when the magis
trate indignantly ordered them out of
the court and asked them not to make
"frivolous interruptions." One of the
women couldn't understand the word
"frivolous" as applied to her old man's
dinner, because, as she explained, "He
eats summat enormous!" and to her
mind his dinner was a very solid fact.
When women jurors for the first
time sat at Walsall Quarter Sessions,
counsel stated that the opening case
was an unpleasant and indecent one,
which women might not like to try in
company with man.
The Recorder said he could not
graft any new principle on the law as
now framed, and the case was tried by
the mixed jury. This puts an end to
the system which has hitherto obtain
ed of ordering women out of court
whenever any case specially offensive
was on the lists for hearing.
Now that women are learning to
fill the job so nicely, male jurymen
are trying to slip out of their obliga
tions.
In one court, a daring protester,
when his name was read out, replied
in a loud voice "On strike!" He was
not called upon to serve.
Meantime, the women are taking
matters philosophically and placidly.
A number of them bring their knitting.
