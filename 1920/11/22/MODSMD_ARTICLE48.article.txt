PARIS, Nov. 22.—Despite France's
loss of 1,750,000 soldiers during the
war, as well as the fact that her death
/ate always tends to exceed her birth
rate, she is confident that her next
cencus to be taken in March, 1921, will
not show a decrease in population.
However, this will be due exclusive
ly to the fact that there will be in
cluded in her census the population of
the provinces returned to her by the
war, namely the departments of the
Uppen and Lower Rhine and the Mo
selle, or in other words, Alsace-Lor
raine, It is expected that the total
population will thus remain close to
40.000 000.
France's last census was taken in
1911 and showed a population of
France of 39,601,509 and a population
for France and Algeria together of
45,150,337, which included 1,132,696
foreigners.
The French census is taken every
five years, but in March, 1916, when
the next census should have been
taken, France had ten departments
being occupied by the enemy, while
thousand upon thousands of inhabi
tants of other departments in which
fighting was faking place had been
obliged to flee. As a consequence the
census went over until March of next
year.
The last German census of the popu
ations of Alsace-Lorraine placed it
at 1,874,014 which is expected just
about to offset France's loss in popu
lation caused by her dead during the
war, as well as her decreased birth
rate resulting from the same cause.
