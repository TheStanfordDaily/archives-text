# STANFORD-U. C. SOCCER GAME RESULTS IN TIE; FINAL-SCORE IS 1 TO 1
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity soccer team tied
California in Saturday's game at Ber
keley by a 1 to 1 score in a hard
fought battle. Chances of victory for
either side swayed back and forth
throughout the game as the contest
see-sawed from one end of the field
to the other. The field itself was
slippery and slowed up the game con
siderably, but the fair-sized crowd
that was present to watch the game
found it an interesting one.
Stanford opened up the first half
with some good playing, and a series
of attacks enabled Titus to make a
score within the first ten minutes of
play. California rallied at this, and
before the Cardinals could stem their
onslaught, scored, credit for the goal
going to Onions. This tied the score
in a Gordian knot, and neither team
could find the sword to cut it before
the game ended.
The second half held a good many
thrills as Stanford and California see
sawed back and forth across the field.
Stanford was on the offensive most of
this half, but lacked the necessary
drive and accuracy of shooting to get
results. The deadlock was not broken
by the time the half ended, and the
final score stood 1 to 1.
The Stanford soccerites did not
seem able to hit their full stride in
the game, and the fact that they did
not win was somewhat of a disappoint
ment, as on paper they were the
strongest team. The Card forwards
were not shooting the ball as accurate
ly as they have done other
teams this season, and in this respect
were outclassed by the California for
wards, who played a rushing game.
The Stanford backfield showed up in
good form. Wing and Anderson prov
ing especially valuable. Wilson, at
inside left, played a sparkling game
for California.
Roth teams were handicapped by
last minute ineligibilities. California
lost five men and Stanford two by this
fact.
The line-up for Stanford follows:
Captain Newland, goal; Adams, right
back;' Anderson, left hack; Wing, right
half; Gorman, left half; Robinson, cen
ter half; Titus, outside right; Struss,
inside right; Mendosa, center forward;
Peavy, inside left; Geo. Clark, outside
left.
Reserves—Masters, goal keeper; Lang
ford and Hays, backs.
Substitutions—Walther for Mendosa;
Mead for Clark.
