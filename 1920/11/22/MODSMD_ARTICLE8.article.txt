# M. P. DAVIDSON, '22, GIVEN SUSPENSION BY MEN'S COUNCIL
## 
### 
M. P. Davidson, '22, was suspended
from the University until January and
paroled as to conduct for the remain
der ol' the school year, last Friday, by
the Men's Council, as a result of
further investigation of the cases of
D. H. Riddell, '23, and E. G. Frost, '22.
Frost and Riddell, who were suspend
ed from the University for a week and
placed on parole for a year, were
found guilty of scalping tickets, origin
ally purchased from Davidson. The
three offenders have been blacklisted
by the Graduate Manager's Offices of
the two universities, and by the office
of the Alumni Secretary.
Davidson's sentence was more se
vere than those imposed on the other
men because of repeated lying before
the Council.
The action of the Council is the
final result of a campaign that has
been waged against ticket scalping for
the past two weeks.
Although a staff of men, acting un
der the direction of the Graduate Man
agers of the two universities, worked
in San Francisco for three days prior
to the Big Game, no further cases
have been brought to light.
