# CALIFORNIA CALLS OFF WOMEN'S HOCKEY GAME
## 
### 
California called off the women's
hockey game between the Jnnior and
Senior classes of Stanford and Cali
fornia scheduled for last Saturday
morning on the U. C. campus. The
reason was a muddy field at Berkeley.
The Stanford team had been practicing
for a week in the rain and had been
keeping training rules since the first of
the quarter. Last year Stanford beat
U. C. in the inter-collcgiate game. U. C.
will not set another date for the game
to be played, nor will it accept Scan
ford's invitation to come down here.
