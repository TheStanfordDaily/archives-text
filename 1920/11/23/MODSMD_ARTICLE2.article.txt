### United Press 
GENEVA, Nov. 23.—Lord Robert
Cecil today demanded that Poland and
Lithuania be punished according to the
provisions in the League of Nations
covenant for continuing war after ad
mission of their districts into the league.
He demanded that the penalties pro
vided for in article 16 be inflicted. The
article provides that any members of
the league resorting to war in violation
of the covenant shall be deemed guilty
of having committed an act of war
against the other members of the
league.' The punishment provided is the
breaking off of all diplomatic, economic
and commercial relations.
Cecil's motion that the league councd
be compelled to make public all docu
ments in the Polish-Rumanian settle
ment was considered by the assembly.
It is claimed that the two countries
violated the covenant of the league by
renewing warfare within three months
after submitting the quarrel to the
league. He demanded that the penalty
of severed trade and financial relations,
as provided in article 16, be inflicted.
