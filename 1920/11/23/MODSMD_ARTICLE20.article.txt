# Thanksgiving Recital To Be Given Tonight
## 
### 
On account of the Thanksgiving vaca
tion beginning on Wednesday, the usual
Thursday organ recital will be dispensed
with. However, this evening Mr. Allen
will give a Thanksgiving program in
stead of the repetition of the Sunday
program. The recital is entirely com
posed of Thanksgiving and Autumn
pieces and will be veny interesting.
