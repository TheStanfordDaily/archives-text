# Charles Hackett Is Perfect Lover On Concert Stage
## 
### 
No man in public life is ever just
as ha seems. Here is a picture of
Charles Hackett, the American tenor
of the Metropolitai Opera Company,
as he appears on the stage. Mr.
Hackett will bo heard in recital in the
Assembly Hall, Friday night, Decem
ber 3d, at S:l5, in double concert with
Raoul Vidas, the young Roumanian-
French violinist.
He is what might be termed a per
fect stage lover, refined, distinguish
ed, and graceful in bearing, a trifle
sentimental, as opera traditions re
quire, in short an extremely polite
man of the world.
But if he hjid his preference in
operatic roles he would appear as
Cavaradossi in "Tosca," who is a little
lovesick in the first act, but who re
viles the commissioner' of police in
the second act and stands up to be
shot at sunrise in the last without
winking an eyelash.
"Give me a role with life and fire,"
said Mr. Hackett, the other night at
the Metropolitan Opera House. "I
took up colorature tenor roles like
that in "The Barber from Seville,"
in which I made by New York de
but, almost for a joke."
But by some twist of fate or the
ouija board or something, the Metro
politai audiences which for decades
have been known to throw their hats
into the air in ecstasy so to speak,
for a dramatic tenor, has at least
placed the seal of approval upon a
singer with a light voice, and a re
fined graceful style. Mr. Ilackett's
voice is not lacking in beauty of tone,
or in resonance, but he does not spe
cialize in high notes or lound tones.
Incidentally it may be recorded that
one of Mr. Hackett's greatest suc
cesses at the Metropolitan was in the
role of Rolitar Cavaradossi in "Tosca."
Season tickets for the Healy con
certs are now on sale at Crandall's
in Palo Alto.
