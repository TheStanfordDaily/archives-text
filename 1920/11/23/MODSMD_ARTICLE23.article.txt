# CALIFORNIA PLANS NEW STADIUM TO BE BUILT NEXT SPRING
## 
### 
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,
Nov. 23.—Plans for a new stadium are
rapidly taking definite form"here. Now
that the P.ig Game is over, Graduate
Manager L. A. Nichols is giving his
attention to working out a scheme to
raise the $800,000 the structure will cost.
Estimates place the loss in Big Game
receipts, due to inadequate bleacher
capacity, at approximately $90,000. An
other reason for the decision to start
raising money for the stadium imme
diately is that inspecting engineers have
decleared the bleachers unsafe, saying
they must be torn down within the next
two years.
The proposed plan calls for a stadium
rather than a bowl, on account of the
necessity of including a track with a
220-yard straightaway within the struc
ture. There will be 60,000 permanent
seats, with provision for 15,000 tem
porary seats for emergencies. This will
be the largest structure of the kind west
of the Mississippi. The new stadium at
the University of Washington, which
scats 30,000, is its nearest rival.
The stadium will be built on the
northwest corner of the campus, west
of the College of Agriculture. Work
will begin next spring, according to
present plans. The structure will cost
between $800,000 and $900,000.
