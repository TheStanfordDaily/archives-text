# SOPHOMORES START COTILLION TICKET SALE AT BOOKSTORE
## 
### 
Sophomore Cotillion tickcts were
placed 011 sale at the Stanford Book
Store this afternoon. Tickcts will re
main on sale until the limited number
is disposed of. The purpose of only
selling a certain number of tickets,
according to the announcement of
Arthur Austin, chairman of the Cotillion
Committee, is to keep the floor from
being overcrowded. He urges everyone
who failed to get his ticket this after
noon to do so early tomorrow morning
before the quota is sold.
The 1923 annual formal will start with
a grand march in the Encina Gym
nasium at 8:45 o'clock Friday evening,
December 3. Originality is to be the
feature of the evening. Special decora
tions and "jazz music" will be imported
by the sophomores in an effort to outdo
any previous class formal. A nine-piece
orchestra has already been contracted
for, and an interior decorator from San
Francisco is now working on a suitable
design for the walls and ceiling of the
gymnasium.
It is highly probable that an outdoor
effect will be worked around the Encina
swimming pool, but definite plans about
this feature have not been worked out.
This year the tickets will be sold at
$5. Each ticket will admit one coupie.
Programs will be distributed later to
all those holding tickcts.
