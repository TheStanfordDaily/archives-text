The University of Washington has the honor of building the first
football stadium on the Coast. It will be dedicated on the day of the
Washington-Dartmouth game on November 27. Its construction from
the time the ground was first broken has taken six months, making a
record for this kind of engineering. It will seat 30,000 persons, and
will cost in the neighborhood of $350,000. It was financed by the people
of the State of Washington, with the assistance of the student body,
which added $100,000 to the fund.
Washington is to be congratulated on the spirit and energy which
has been shown in financing and building the stadium. The money
necessary to build the structure was raised in a short time, and the
engineers reduced the time needed for construction from four years, re
quired on the Yale Bowl, to six months. Business men of Seattle have
co-operated with the University on the project, and through the com
bined efforts of all interested, Washington has the first stadium on the
Coast.
The University of Southern California has announced plans for
the erection of a similar stadium, and the University of California has
done likewise. Both institutions have started on their campaigns to
raise the necessary money.
The Board of Athletic Control, in charge of Stanford's athletic
affairs, announced a short time ago that it had plans under consideration
for a football stadium. A site was to be chosen, they said, and that is
the last that has been heard from them. It is important that the finan
cial campaign begin immediately, and if the Board intends to push the
project, and put it across as Washington has done, it might be the
logical time to announce its purpose now. Stanford can well afford to
advertise, and a football stadium is a good medium to start with.
