# FRESHMAN CLASS WILL COLLECT UNPAID DUES
## 
### 
Freshman class affairs are being
straightened out, especially in regard to
matters left over from the bonfire and
the collection of class dues.
Treasurer Haley wishes it announced
that although the majority of the Fresh
man class have paid their due of $1,
there is still a minority of the class
who are slackers and who must come
through before long. A list is being
prepared of those who have not yet
paid up, so that the committee will
know how the class members stand.
Class dues may be paid to any one
bf the following: B. E. McCaffery, 20.5
Encina; J. C. Waterman, 305 Encina;
R. E. Lewis, 329 Encina; L. G. Allyn,
27 Sequoia; Virginia Hoppin, 167 Roble,
and Cecil Haley, Theta Delta Chi.
An important point to he amphasized
is that everyone who has any outstand
ing bills in connection with the bonfire
should turn them in to Treasurer Haley
at once, so that all matters may be
straightened out promptly. Most of the
accounts have been settled, but there
are still some bills which should be
turned in immediately so that action
may he taken on them.
