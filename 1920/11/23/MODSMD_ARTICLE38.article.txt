# D. STARR JORDAN OUTLINES HISTORY OF CORDA FRATRES
## 
### 
Development of Corda Fratres from
its earliest beginnings in Germany to
its present world-wide standing was
carefully brought out last night at a
meeting of the local organization in the
Women's Clubhouse by Doctor Jordan.
"In the beginning," said Doctor Jor
dan, "the organization was a reaction
against Prussian militarism; searching
for freedom and justice. While it was
democratic it was not socialistic.
"The International Club, as it was
known in Germany, became Corda
Fratres—a band of brothers—at the
first great convention held in Paris in
1910. From France the movement
spread to the United States, and in 1912
the second convention was held at Cor
nell University."
Organized at Stanford at this time
as the Cosmopolitan Club, organization
developed rapidly, but lapsed during the
war. Now as Corda Fratres the club is
speedily regaining its ore-war position.
The Chinese Club, at the next meet
ing, will have charge of the program
and will appear in native costumes. An
interesting feature of the meeting will
be the refreshments, entirely Chinese.
