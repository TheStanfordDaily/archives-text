# SENIOR-SOPHOMORE HOCKEY TEAMS PLAY THIRD ROUND TODAY
## 
### 
The senior women's hockey team
played the sophomore eleven in the
third of the series of interclass hockey
matches this afternoon on the Roble
field. Both teams have played one
game in the final round so far, the
seniors defeating the freshmen in the
game of last Thursday, by a score of
3 to 0, and the sophomores having
been defeated in their match with the
junior team by a score of 4 to 0.
Due to the Thanksgiving recess no
game is scheduled until December 2,
when the Junior team will compete
against the freshmen. The managers
and captains of the team ask that as
many rooters as possible come out and
support their teams.
