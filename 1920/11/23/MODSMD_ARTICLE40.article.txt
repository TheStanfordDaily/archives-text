### R. W. K 
Ye Cabbage Editor: —
Rules for conduct at the Union.
Before starting to the Union for
noon meals, do one of the following:
(1) Learn to slip out of class un
observed at 11:50 in order to grab a
seat at a table, or
(2) Bribe a Yellow friend to save
you one, or
(3) Eat at the Inn.
Then,
(a) Approach the Union eating
place from the same direction as the
wind is blowing, for the same reason
a homely man never looks in a lock
ing glass just before going to a dance.
(b) Make the descent, keeping a
firm hold on your self-control.
(c) Select a table near the kitchen,
to obviate the necessity of waiting un
til supper for lunch to be served.
(d) Do not, think cheerful thoughts.
The contrast is too great.
Minor points to be observed.
(1) Never call the Oriental waiter
"George." He won't hear you any
way.
(2) Baked popatoes are popular, but
beware of the boiled spud. It is prac
tically impossible to avoid eating part
of the skin.
(3) Remove the skins of prunes,
bananas, baked apples, etc., before
eating. The hospitals are full al
ready.
Walk out with a firm step. The
worst is yet to come, anyway.
"Eat and be Merry, for Tomorrow
You Die."

William Bandoline back five yards.
He came down to the Quad today with
his famous broad beam part off-side.
