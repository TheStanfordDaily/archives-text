Stanford boasts of her spirit. But is
it the Stanford spirit to return from a
visit and criticise our hostess?
Some California rooters, it is true,
behaved last Saturday in a manner that
can reflect no credit to their alma mater.
But there is some excuse.
The Golden Bear has some three
thousand first yearling cubs. She cannot
mother so many. She cannot bring them
up in the straight and narrow path, but
must leave them to grow up according
to nature. So it takes the cubs three or
four years to learn those elements of
sportsmanship that all Cardinal Babes
know by their first Big Game.
Then, too, success is a harder test
of character than failure.
So, though some regrettable scenes
followed the game, the true Stanford
spirit demands that we overlook them,
at least in public comment.
Every barrel of apples contains a rot
ten one. But why hunt for the rotten
one and gloat over it when it is dug up?
There are many good apples at Cal.
One of these that should not be over
looked is the generosity shown by the
Bruin fraternities to Stanford men.
They held open house and invited all
Stanfordites to be their guests, furnish
ing meals to all comers.
Another thing worthy of praise is the
new California custom of saying "Hello"
to all wearers of the Cardinal rooters'
hat. To those who know the frigid con
ventional atmosphere of the Campanile,
this is nothing short of marvelous.
So when we return from a visit to
our sister's campus, let's not put the
Stanford spirit in the closet to keep it
spotless for the next Big Game, but
war it around the Quad. At least, let's
not announce to the world that our
sister's babies are naughty, and ours
are angelic. It isn't the Stanford spirit.
