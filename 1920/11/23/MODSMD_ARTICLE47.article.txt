# COLUMBIA SENDS DEBATE CHALLENGE TO U. OF CALIFORNIA
## 
### 
Columbia University has challenged
California to an inter-collegiate debate.
A telegram was received from the presi
dent of the Columbia Debating Society
last night saying that Columbia Uni
versity would like to arrange to hold a
debate with California this year, and
if it were agreeable, under what con
ditions and on what subject. Columbia
would prefer to hold the debate in Cali
fornia. O
No reply has been sent to Columbia,
and according to H. M. Griffiths, '22, it
is not probable that a definite answer
will be made to the challenge until after
the Princeton-California debate, which
is to be held some time in January.
