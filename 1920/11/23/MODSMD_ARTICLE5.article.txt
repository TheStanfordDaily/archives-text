# 1923 TICKET DRAWINGS WILL BE HELD TUESDAY
## Assembly Hall Will Be Scene of 1923 Play; Seat Lottery 1:00 o'clock Next Tuesday 
### 
Ticket drawings for the Sophomore
play, "Wedding Bells" to be produced
Saturday evening, December 4 in the
Assembly Hall, will be held next Tues
day afternoon at 1 o'clock in the Ad
ministration Building. The price of
admission to the comedy will be 75c
and $1.00 plus war tax.
Seat drawings, the last year and a
half, have been held wherever the
business manager of the show could
obtain a place. Sometime the draw
ings were held at the Book Store, and
sometimes at Wilson's and sometimes
on the Engineering corner. Even
there has been times that the only
available place would be a portion of
the sidewalk near the quad. This
confusion has been done away with
and Business Manager Milt Bulkley
has arranged with the University to
hold all future drawings in the Ad
ministrattbn Building.
The Sophomore play this year
brings to the campus one of the most
sparkling and cleverly worked out
comedies that has invaded the Amer
ican stage. Its author, Salisbury
Field, has cut all binding strings and
made his play a convulsion of mirth
and humor. Witty lines, peculiar cir
cumstances and funny character work
are bold factors whoch stand for
"Wedding Bells' " success. Each mem
ber of the cast is forming to his part
like melted iron to a cold casting pat
tern. "I feel," says Coach Davis,
"that every person in the cast "will
put over one of the biggest hits ever
produced by a Sophomore class. The
play itself is the exact type for this
class of production. It is going to be
good and those that fail to see it will
miss one of the best comedies that has
ever been written in the last three
years."
