# JUNIORS MUST HAVE PICTURES TAKEN NOW
## 
### 
Only three and a half weeks remain
before Christmas vacation and only a
third of the Juniors have had their
pictures taken. Over 320 third year
men and women have paid their dues,
but there seems to be a lack of interest
in the picture taking. Editor Fisher
wants to close the Junior Section of the
year book in December and he cannot
do this without the of all
members of the 1922 class who desire
to have their photograph placed in the
book with the Junior Section.
Quad dues are coming in satisfac
torily, according to Manager Bill Vos
burgh. He and his assistants have col
lected about 30 per cent more dues
than they expected to find members of
the class, and arc well satisfied with
the support given them so far in the
year book. There remain a few mem
bers who do not live on the campus
and whom the manager has not been
able to reach. Vosburgh urges these
few to send him their $7 dues now, or
hand it to one of the tryoutees.
The Athletics Editors want any ex
ceptional action pictures of the late
football season. They have the photos
taken by the official photographers, hut
if anyone has a good action picture and
will loan the negative to the Quad the
editors will be very glad to use it.
