Sea Water Gold.
"What has become of the man who
had a recipe for getting gold out of sea
water?"
"He succeeded in doing it. He gave
up fooling with laboratories and took
over the bathing privileges at an
oceanside resort."
Mistakes.
"Even as close a student as you are
may make mistakes."
"Very true," said Senator Sorghum.
"A man does very well if he only
makes two or three mistakes Instead
of making his entire career look like
a prolonged blunder."
Another Effort to Explain.
"What do you think causes the high
cost of living?"
"Too many obliging dispositions,"
replied Mr. Growcher. "Everybody is
trying to keep enough money on hand
to meet the extraordinary demands of
everybody else."

EVIDENCE.
Mr. Jones —I'm smoking a. terrible
lot of cigars lately.
Mr. White — With conviction.
You're right, if that's one of them.
Trouble.
Trouble travels very fast
No man's swift enough to shake him;
Makes no difference how he runs.
It can always overtake him.
Mixed Varieties.
"Well, what kind of a family tree
did you pet from that expensive
genealogist?"
"I thought I was going to get a
peach, but he handed me a lemon."
A Homeopathic Complaint.
"How is your short-hand depart
ment?"
"Too much like Itself."
"What do you mean?"
"It's short-handed."
The Result.
"Mayme's father heard her young
man tell her he was burning with
love for her."
"What did he do?"
"He put him out."
Immediate Response.
"I asked Mr. Smith to give me a
show that would afford me an opening
for my peculiar abilities."
"Did he do It?"
"Oh, yes. He showed me the door."
The Reason.
"Here's a magistrate reproves a man
severely for using only one arm when
he is driving his car with a girl."
"I suppose the reproof was for let
ting his energy go to waist."
Tact.
She —Tell me in plain terms what
you think of my picture.
He —Madam, to speak of your pic
ture in plain terms is impossible.
His Advantage.
"A butcher Is lucky in these times."
"Why so?"
"Because he can always make both
ends meat."
The Cause.
"Why do actors call a good role a
velvet one?"
"Because they expect a pile from
It."
