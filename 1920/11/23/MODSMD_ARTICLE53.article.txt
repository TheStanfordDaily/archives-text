"Why do you insist that the farmer
Is not properly considered? Everybody
Is talking about the Importance of ag
ricultural production."
"Maybe It's something like profes
sional jealousy," replied Farmer Corn
tossel. "We go to the county fair ex
pectin* to have all kinds of a fuss
over the prize pigs and pumpkins and
find that the whole crowd has rushed
off to the trottin* races and the movin'
pictures."
Indefinite.
"They're engaged."
"When are they going to marry?"
"That's very indefinite. She has
agreed to wait until lie earns enough
to support a wife, and at the present
cost of living that's not what you'd
call a very bright prospect."
Inquiry.
"Which came first, the chicken o*
the egg?" inquired the quizzical per
son.
"Please don't start that!" protested
Senator Sorghum. "We already have
enough Investigating committees figur

The Real Reason.

Try, Try Again.
"Has your wife a sense of humor?"
"I don't think so," replied Mr. Pyn
hed. "1 have told her the same joke
over and over and I don't believe she
has laughed at it more than twice in
her whole life."
A Puzzle.
"This gambling in stocks by trust
ed employees reminds me of the old
beheading puzzles."
"How so?"
"Behead speculation and what re
mains?"
Tyranny of Fashion.
"Do you think your wife will always
want to vote?"
"Yes." replied Mr. Meekton; "un
less, of course, something happens to
make it appear that voting has gone
out of style."
