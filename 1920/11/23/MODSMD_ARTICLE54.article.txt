# INTRAMURAL QUINTETS START SERIES AFTER THANKSGIVING RECESS
## 
### 
Intramural basketball starts next
Monday, when three of the teams in
the intramural league meet in the Eu
cina gym to practice preliminary to
the first series of the basket-ball con
test. Fifty-four teams are entered in
the preliminaries and each will meet
all the others in each league. There
are nine leagues with six teams in
each.
Director H. S. Botsford, head of the
intramural sports, says that he has
some of the finest material he has
ever seen out for practice now and
expects to throw some record-breaking
teams into the fray during the league
contests. Eucina second floor, whose
team took the championship last
year has the same strong aggregation
in the field this year and they are
out for blood again.
Among the freshmen who will play
this year on the intra mural quintets
are men who have played on state
championship teams the past year and
are showing up in great form this
quarter.
There are dark horses galore among
the new fives that have formed this
year, notably among them being the
military detachment from the univer
sity. They admit that they are good
and are raring to get at the student
organizations.
The schedule for the teams that will
meet in the coming week is being ar
ranged now and will be posted on the
intra-mural bulletin board in the gym
nasium either tomorrow or during the
latter part of the week. This next
week's games will be all the time
there is allotted for practice and the
league games starting on the 6th of
December will continue for one week
only on account of finals. The re
mainder of the schedule will be play
ed off right after New Years.
