I wish to express a feeling of
appreciation to tlie men named
below who, as members of the
squad, have trained faithfully
throughout the season without
immediate prospect of reward in
order to give Stanford a better
team. Their work has been fully
as helpful and important as that
of the so-called first string men:
Pollard, Sproull, Mcrtz, Rice,
Kraft, Nelson, Culp, McCombs,
Wayland, Taylor, Kennedy, Ful
lertoti, Larson, Rchfuss, Jameson,
Black, Schlesinger, Koehler, Jar
vis, Monroe, Elwood.
WALTER D. POWELL, Coach.
