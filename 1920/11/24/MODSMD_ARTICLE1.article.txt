# HEALY TO OFFER DOUBLE CONCERT ON DECEMBER 3
## Raoul Vidas, Noted Violinist and Chas. Hackett, Tenor, Will Open Concert Series 
### 
The opening program of this year's
scries of concerts which will be pre
sented here by Frank VV. Healy is an
exceptional offering, according to the
committee in charge. Mr. Healy has
sent artists down here for the past three
years, and each season has proven a
great success. But this year for the
opening concert he has outdone himself.
Charles Hackett, the young leading lyric
tenor of the Metropolitan Opera House,
and Raoul Vidas, the brilliant young
violinist, will be heard in double con
cert in the Assembly Hall, Friday night,
November 3. Mr. Healy's original plan
was to have Mr. Hackett and Vidas
come down and give separate concerts,
as they are doing throughout the coun
try, fo reach artist has a repertoire suffi
cient for three concerts if necessary.
But due to a confusion of dates, it was
found to be impossible to have them
both down here in separate concerts,
and rather than cancel the engagement
of one, and at the same time give the
public an opportynity to hear both these
artists, he has combined them in a dou
ble program, each giving practically his
whole concert intact. The concerts in
San Francisco and here at Stanford are
pasitively the only times throughout
their respective tours that these artists
will appear on the same program.
Season tickets are now on sale at
Crandall's and the series this year is
composed of Hackett- V idas, Louis
Graveure, world-renowned baritone;
Leo Ornstein, the brilliant young pianist,
and Mme. Alda, the noted operatic star.
Single admission tickets will be on sale
at the booth in the Administration Build
ing beginning Monday, November 29.
Tickets for the Hackett-Vidas concert
will be $2.
Another feature of this year's series
will be the deferred-payment system that
will be granted only to students. By
special arrangement with Mr. Healy,
single admission tickets bought at the
time of each concert will go to apply
toward a season ticket, which is only $5,
whereas single admissions for the four
concerts total $7.50. By a system of re
ceipts. if a student attends the first three
concerts, which totals $5 in single ad
missions, he will receive a ticket to the
last one, Mme. Alda, free of charge.
Or, a ticket for the first concert and
one purchased for the second concert,
Louis Graveure, will total $4, and the
student will have only to pay $1 to hear
both Ornstein and Alda. This is cer
tainly a wonderful inducement to the
students to hear these wonderful artists,
and that it will be taken advantage of is
to be expected.
