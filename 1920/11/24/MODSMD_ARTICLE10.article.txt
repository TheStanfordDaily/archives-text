# UNDEFEATED CARDINALS LEAD SOCCER LEAGUE
## 
### 
Stanford's soccer team leads the Uni
versity and Club Soccer League, accord
ing' to the standing as compiled after last
Saturday's game. The Cardinal team
has so far been undefeated, and the only
game they have not won has been the
tie contest that was played with Cali
fornia last Saturday. They are also the
enly undefeated team in the league, all
other teams having lost one or more
games.
The University and Club Soccer
League is made up of six teams â€”Stan-
ford, Olympics, California, Virtus, Chi
nese, and Columbia. Stanford leads
with four victories, no defeats and one
tie; Olympics are second with five vic
tories and one defeat; California third
with four victories, one defeat and one
tie; Virtus fourth with two victories
and four defeats; Chinese lifth with one
victory and four defeats; Columbia last
with five defeats and no victories.
The next game on the soccer varsity's
schedule is with California on Decem
ber, 4. There will be a double-header
furnished to football fans on that date,
as the Cardinal rugby team will meet
the U. C. ruggers on the same day. Both
games will be played at Stanford.
The freshmen soccer team meets the
P.lue and Gold Babes in a return game
December 4, at California. They have
been handicapped greatly by lack of
teams to practice against, the last- game
with California being the only one
played this season. However, games
with the Palo Alto High School and the
Military Academy have been arranged
for, and with constant practice the Car
dinal Babes will have a good chance to
win from their California opponents.
