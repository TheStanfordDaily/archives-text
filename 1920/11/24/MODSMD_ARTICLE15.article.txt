# ANNUAL PLAY CHOSEN BY MASQUERS SOCIETY TO BE MID-VICTORIAN
## 
### 
The annual play presented by the
Masquers Dramatic Society was decided
on at a meeting held yesterday after
noon. The play will be in the nature of
a comedy and will have a wealth of
clever comedy parts. There is a large
cast, so there will be plenty of oppor
tunity for both men and women to show
their skill in characterization. The cos
tuming and scenic effects will be naid-
Victorean, as period plays are customary
for this society. The name of the play
will be announced later.
Open tryouts will be held on Decem
ber 9 and 10 in the Assembly Hall. The
time will be annouhced later. The play
will be under the direction of Coach
Gordon Davis and will be produced Jan
uary 2. It has been decided advisable to
have tryouts early so that the cast may
lie chosen and the manuscript given out
before the Christmas holidays.
