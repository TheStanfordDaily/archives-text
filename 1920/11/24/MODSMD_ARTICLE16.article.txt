# SOPHOMORE PLAY WILL HAVE SINGLE SETTING
## 
### 
Snap is going to be one of the main
features of the Sophomore play, "Wed
ding Bells," to be produced December
4 in the Assembly Hall. The clever
comedy calls for only one stage setting,
as all the action takes place in the
home of Reggie. There will be no de
lays in the shifting of scenes. Pre
cision of the plot and the clever way in
which the cast is learning to handle
their parts will make tlie play go off
without a hitch.
"Wedding Hells" stands high for its
"laugh-snatching" qualities. The mar
riage mix-ups and the final matrimonial
tie-ups arc the work of an experienced
comic writer. Field has instilled into
his play only the highest grade of
humor. He has made an open portrayai
of the humorous side of married life.
Married life in the play seems to be a
disease, but yet no one marries the per
son they intend to.
