# GYMNASIUM WILL BE HUNTING LODGE FOR SOPHOMORE DANCE
## 
### 
Tentative plans for the decorations of
the Sophomore Cotillion, to be held in
Encina Gymnasium, December 3, have
been drawn up by the committee. In
past cotillions the type of decorations
have been along Oriental, Arabian and
Spanish lines, but this year the decora
tions will come closer home.
It is the plan of the committee to
transform the large gymnasium into a
hunting lodge. The interior will be de
signed* with log walls and rough board
ceilings. Numerous skins and those
articles which go to decorate the walk
of any hunting lodge will be used to
cover the rustic sides of the building.
The idea is something new and can'
be cleverly executed. Much work will
be needed to put it across. The com
mittee asks for every sophomore to
come to the gymnasium at 2 o'clock next
Thursday afternoon.
The ticket sale for the cotillion has
been better these first few days than
expected. There are plenty of tickets
left, but if the sale continues as it did
yesterday the supply may fall below the
demand.
