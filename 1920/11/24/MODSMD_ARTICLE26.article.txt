# ON TO THE NEXT SPORT

Stanford has completed the football season and has won second place
in the Pacific Coast Conference, although defeated by California. A
rather gloomy atmosphere has prevailed since the defeat in the Big
Game and considerable pessimism has been heard over the prospects for
the remainder of the year. However, the Cardinal teams have bright
prospects ahead of them, as a survey of the material for the various
teams shows, and there is no cause for pessimism to be the keynote of
campus talk.
Stanford won the basketball championship of the Conference last
year, and from present indications a majority of the men will return
for this season's play. Coach Powell has seasoned men to work with,
and the prospects for another championship varsity appear to be good.
California won from Stanford last year in track for the first time
in eight years, but again a survey of the material shows that Cardinal
will be represented by an exceptionally strong team, and paper pros
pects make the chances for victory very bright.
The baseball varsity will have a large number of veterans from last
year back, and with the addition of new men from the freshman team,
the team will be in strong shape. The chances for victory against Cali
fornia are better than they have been for the last three years, as the
Blue and Gold has lost several of the men who have played with the
varsity since their sophomore year.
Because the final game of the football season resulted in a defeat,
there is no reason why the Cardinal teams should not be successful in
the remaining sports left on the schedule. Pessimism will never improve
Stanford prospects, but liberal doses of optimism will do no harm, and
may result in good.
Get out and boost, anyway.
