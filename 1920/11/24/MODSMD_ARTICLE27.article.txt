For the last two years the Univer
sity of Southern California liaa been
making every effort to be admitted
into the Pacific Coast Conference.
This question is one of particular con
cern to Stanford. It involves the
atneltic ideals for which we have
made such a commendable fight.
Ten years ago it was quite the pro
per thing for western colleges to
make inducements of one kind or
another to athletes to persuade them
to attend certain colleges. It was
common then, all did it, and it had
the sanction of custom. It is done
by all Eastern colUges now. Recent
ly Harvard, Yale, and Princeton
agreed between themselves not to
"scout" each other's players. The
agreement of course left them free to
scout any other college's players. 13ut
vl'.ile this miserable system is now
flourishing in the East, it is to the
great credit of Western colleges gen
eral, y that it ha 4 practically disap
peared. Unfortunately the peti
tioners from the south still practice
this. High school athletic stars are
approached before they graduate from
prep school, and the subject oC col
lege is gone into. If they are in need
of financial assistance to attend col
lege they are offered an "athletic
scholarship" and in case of further
assistance being needed they may be
given a job winding the clock or
something similar, at a salary. Re
peated efforts have been made for
two years to secure one of our varsity
football men. He was told that if ho
attended U. S. C. he could play in
every game this year. The Pacific
Coast Conference rules prohibit trans
fered students from playing for a
year. When the Stanford varsity
went south a list of U. S. C. players
was submitted, all of whim it was
said were eligible to play under the
conference rules. One wonders if
his name would have appeared. But
there are other objections.
Scholastically U. S. C. leaves much
to be desired. T?nits from the south
ern law school are not recognized at
Stanford. A students can graduate in
law there and he would be obliged to
start over again here.
They are ambitious, and great ad
vertisers, and their athletic teams are
an important part of this advertise
ment. They aspire to be the great
university of Southern California. We
have no dispute with them, we wish
them well. But to take them into the
conference would be a blow to the
principles we have so consistently
championed. Whether they are ad
mitted or not is a question for the
offiicials of the conference. But'the
students have an interest in whether
their teams play bona-fide university
teams or whether they play a team
that t oall purposes is professional.
As a student I protest again any ac
tion toward taking U. S. C. into the
Pacific Coast Conference, until there
is satisfactory reason to believe that
they have actually given up the prac
tice of making special inducements to
athletes ,and untij their scholastic
standards are raised to those of a -first
class university.
