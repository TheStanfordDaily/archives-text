BRING IN THE NEXT ONE
"Sticky" Wilson has announced a
reduction of his candy prices. A
young man in Boston has turned down
a million dollar legacy. The day will
be complete when the bootleggers re
vamp ye olde custome of bying back
drinks.

OUR IMMORAL MOTHER TOGUE
That Kingscote adv. is giving ye
ed. lots of trouble. Today Qum Dum,
who is responsible for the ad. flicked
the dust from his newly-sprouter
wings and admonished us that to the
pure all things (even cabbages and
t ) are pure; and gently chiding,
says that though we choose to make
La Vie Parisienne insinuations about
his Kingscote "room-mate" ad. the
kick is due to the English language
and not to any laxity in his own sweet
morals.

Dum Dum further disturbs the nor
malcy of the occasion by remarking
that since the rugged Chappies have
announced a "Co-ed" number, why
don't the local chapter of T. N. E. give
a dansant for their next initiation
party?

Three fingers of neer beer, George!
