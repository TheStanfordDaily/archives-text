# THEFT TO BE PLACED BEFORE EX-COMMITTEE
## 
### 
F. L. McElroy, president of the Asso
ciated Students, is, asked to place before
the Student Executive Committee the
matter of the theft of a clock from the
Women's Clubhouse recently, in a letter
received by him from the secretary ot
the organization. This is the second
move on the part of the Women's Club
to secure the return of the clock, which
was a gift from Mrs. David Starr Jor
dan. An appeal recently published in
the Daily Palo Alto brought no re
sponse.
The letter follows:
"November 22, 1920.
"My Dear Mr. McElroy: I am writ
ing to you as head of the Associated
Students to ask if you will bring before
the Student Executive Committee the
matter of the theft of the clock from
the Women's Clubhouse a few days ago.
"The clock was a present to the house
from Mrs. David Starr Jordan, and was
greatly valued on that account as well
as for its beauty and usefulness. An ap
peal for its return was made through
the Daily Palo Alto, but brought no
response.
"The Clubhouse is constantly serving
the University community in a great
variety of ways, free of any charge,
and it seems a poor return for the
services rendered that one of our most
valued possessions should be taken from
us in this way.
"If you would present this matter to
the Executive Committee and they will
go on record as opposed to the practice
of taking things from the Clubhouse—l
am sorry to say that this is not the only
loss we have suffered—it might be that
the person or persons who took .the
clock would feel impelled to return it.
"The Directors will very much appre
ciate any help you can give us in this
matter. Yours very truly,
"(MRS. E. P.) H. CUBBERLEY,
"Secretary-Treasurer Stanford Women's
Club."
