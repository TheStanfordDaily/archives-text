# Sophomores Give New Chance for Campus Queeners
## 
### 
Unintentionally and unpremeditated,
the Sophomore play and cotillion were
booked on the same week-end this year,
December 3 and 4. We don't know
whether or not it was done by genius'
subconscious mine, but the throwing of
the two together has instituted into the
university a "Sophomore week-end."
The plan of having the cotillion and
play the same week might cause rivalry
in time between Junior week and Sopho
more week. Hut financially, from the
standpoint of the "quecner's" pocket, the
Sophomore w<|ek-end can be classed as
less expensive.
"It's a good idea, don't you think? It
only means two nights of merriment for
the campus frolickers instead of one."
