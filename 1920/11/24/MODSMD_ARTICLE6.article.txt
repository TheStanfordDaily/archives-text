# LARGE AUDIENCE HEARS PIANIST
## Mrs. Elsie Cook Hughes Plays Concert and Popular Selections at Little Theatre 
### Florence V. Hocking, '22 
Playing to a large and appreciative
audience in the Little Theatre last night,
which repeatedly called for encores,
Mrs. Elsie Cook Hughes more than ful
filled the promises which her committee
had made for her. That the Tuesday
lectures and concerts are becoming
more and more popular was evidenced
by the group of students and faculty
members which filled to overflowing the
Little Theatre.
It is rarely the privilege of any audi
ence to hear a pianiste who plays with
the finish given by years of study and
yet with a truly sympathetic under
standing of her themes and a compre
hensive knowledge of what her audi
ence appreciates. The difficult passages
performed with exquisite skill by Mrs.
Hughes impressed one not so much
with the technique which was involved
as with the motif of the whole com
position, much as the intricacies of
mosaic work are lost in the beauty of the
finished pictures adorning the Memorial
Church.
Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata started
with a sweet slow movement, dashed
into the happier allegretto and broke
into a note of alarm at the beginning
of the last movement. The rippling
treble notes gave way to a heavy base
which gathered momentum as the so
nata ends in a final crescendo. This was
one of the happier selections of the
evening, and Mrs, Hughes' rendition of
this favorite composition of Beethoven's
left nothing to be desired.
Four shorter composition of Chopin's,
the Etude, Op. 10, No. 5; The Nocturne,
in E major; the Valese, in C sharp
minor, and The Ballade, in A flat major,
were played in series by Mrs. Hughes
and met with instant applause. The
slow majestic movement of the Nocturne
more than showed the sympathy which
Mrs. Hughes has with her music.
Crohndahl's exquisite Serenade was
one of the best selections which Mrs.
Hughes played. The rest of the pro
gram, all pieces of a classical nature,
were executed with equal intelligence
and appreciation of their motifs.
The Tuesday evening lectures and
concerts are proving more and more
worth while, and the committee in charge,
headed by Professor Barsset of the
English Department, is to be congratu
lated upon the success of their efforts.
It is only to be regretted that the re
mainder of the students have not taken
the time to attend these entertainments.
