# STEWART EDWARD WHITE SPEAKS TO LEGION TONIGHT
## Palo Alto Post Will Hear Former Leader of 144th Field Artillery Division 
### 
Stewart Edward White, who speaks
tonight at the big American Legion
smoker in the Community House at Palo
Alto, is known throughout the country
and the world for his word picturiza
tions of life in the Northwest. He is
known more intimately perhaps to many
of Jiis comrades as the leader of the
Firet Battalion of the 144 th Field Ar
tillery.
Enlisting at the outbreak of the war
with Spain, White served his country
through that struggle and then left the
service. When the great European war
came on and the United States finally
came to blows with the central powers,
Stewart Edward White was among the
first to offer his services again to his
country. With Thornwell Mullaly,
Peter B. Kyne and a few other men of
note he worked out the idea of a volun
teer regiment composed entirely of men
from the Golden State. Mullaly ob
tained his commission as major in the
National Guard of the State of Cali
fornia, and White took over the com
mand of Battery "A," the first battery
to be formed in the new regiment.
When the regiment, now known as the
Second California Field Artillery, or
the "Grizzlies," was sent to Camp
Kearny for intensive training, White
was commissioned a major. As such he
went overseas in the summer of 1918
with the Fortieth Division. When the
"Grizzlies" returned to the United States
a year later to be discharged, Stewart
Edward White left the service to take
up once more his work in the field of
literature. He has spent his time since
then chiefly in the West, and will talk
tonight on some of his recent travels,
as well as relating some of the anec
dotes that members of the "Sunshine,"
"Sunset," and "Wild West" divisions
will remember with a laugh or perhaps
a feeling of regret.
Post 52 of Palo Alto is acting as
host, and extends a cordial invitation
to all the buddies in the vicinity to come
and hear Comrade White "spill a few."
Harry Maloney says the fun will start
about 7:30 and they have plenty of
"Bull" and cigars. After the talk there
will be refreshments for all.
