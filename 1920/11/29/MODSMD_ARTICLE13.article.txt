time this year. With seven Varsity S
men reporting for practice, chances for
developing another such championship
team as last year's arc exceptionally
good. Coach Walter Powell is in charge
of the Varsity men.
Righter, Richmond, Adams, Davis,
Mills and Svvanholm all won their let
ters in former seasons, and are Among
those taking part in the initial practice
today. Austin, who is not in college now,
is expected to return in time for the
beginning of the season. Carver, al
though not an "S" man, played im sev
eral games last year, and may be counted
on this year.
Howell is the best possibility from last
year's freshman five, while Rogers and
Anderson show up well.
The interclass games will start to
morrow and Coach Powell will be given
an opportunity to look over material.
Freshman practice is also starting this
afternoon. Although it is too early to
get a line on the possibilities of the
Frosh, former records of those who are
