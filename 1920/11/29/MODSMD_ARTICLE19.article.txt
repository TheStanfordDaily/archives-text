# SOCCER TEAMS AWAIT CONTESTS WITH BLUE AND GOLD SATURDAY
## 
### 
Stanford and California soccer var
sities will mix on the local field next
Saturday in a game that will be, in a
way, the climax of Stanford's soccer
season, as it will be the second of the
two-game series being played with the
Blue and Gold. The first contest, staged
on the morning of the Big Game, re
sulted in a tie, 1-1, so the Cardinal
soccer men are on their toes and eager
for a chance to clean up on California.
So far the soccer varsity has yet to
taste defeat, having won four games and
lost none. California has furnished the
toughest opposition, and the outcome of
the game next Saturday should show
whether or not Stanford has the strong
est soccer combination since 1914, as
Coach Maloney believes is the case.
The freshman soccerites are also
priming themselves for their return
game with the California frosh Satur
day at Berkeley. Like the varsity, their
first game with the Blue and.Gold repre
sentatives ended in a tie, 3-3, so tliey,
too, are awaiting the chance to complete
the job with a victory, forecasts on
either game cannot be accurately made
as yet, but as the week progresses it
should be possible to get a line on the
probable outcome of the games. If the
varsity plays tip to its early season form,
California should go down on- the short
end, but unless an improvement over the
brand of soccer furnished on the 20th
is achieved, the outcome will be a matter
of doubt.
