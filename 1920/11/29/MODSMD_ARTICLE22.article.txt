next Saturday night in the Assembly
Hall will be held tomorrow at 1:00
o'clock in the Administration Build
ing. Prices for the show will be 75c
and $1.00 plus war tax. Tlie comedy
is a play of matrimonial complica
tions wrapped in convulsions of laugh
ter.
Did you ever have pictures to you
the humorous side of marriage? Many
comic playwriters have construed
humorous stage sensations and used
for their themes "marriage life" after
the parson has tied the knot, but Salis
bury Field, author of "Wedding Bells"
uses pre-marriage life as the founda
tion of his clever comedy.
Marriage, as the name of the come
dy suggests, is the nucleus around
which the plot is formed. Even the
butler of the play wooes and wins
three times and then finds himself
ready for the fourth. Each male
character on the cast wooes and each
fair lady is wooed, but in the end
something goes wrong and all those
who woo, lose, but yet they marry.
The play is most cleverly built up,
one complication upon another and
each with a unique and funny climax.
It is a comedy which can be brilliantly
handled by the sophomore cast. After
the drawing tomorrow tickets will be
placed on sale at Crandall's in palo
Alto.
Tickets for the Cotillion will also
be on sale with the tickets to the
show. Five dollars is the price of
Cotillion tickets, which will admit one
couple to the formal.
