# USELESS DANCE EXPENSES
## 
### 
During - the last few years the practice has arisen of giving expensive
dances among- the fraternities at Stanford, and this practice has reached
the point where several of the houses consider it a matter of duty to
give a dance that will cost in the neighborhood of four or five hundred
dollars. Other houses have been forced to fall in line in order to keep
themselves on the social map, and the result has been that a dance docs
not "get by" any more unless the music comes from off the campus, an
interior decorator is hired, and a caterer employed. These three
requisites make the total that each individual member of a house pays
amount to a considerable sum, and which he s forced to pay on the plea
that the house has to do it, or fall out of the running.
Dances are a necessary part of the social program of each fraternity
and they should be as good as they can be reasonably made. But when
the spirit of competition reaches the point where the members of houses
are forced to pay more than they can afford of the money that is pro
vided them for their education, it is time that the competition, is curbed.
With a little less expenditure, and a little more originality, the fra
ternity social functions can be just as successful as they arc now, and
be made much easier for the men themselves to bear financially. It is a
matter for the Interfraternity Conference to handle, and it properly falls
within the jurisdiction of that lx)dy to place a limit within which cach
house be required to stay.
