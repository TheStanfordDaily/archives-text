# LIBRARY RULES
## 
### 
Tt is one of the claims of Stanford that every student here is a
"Stanford student" from the minute lie first sets foot on the Quad, and
that he quickly catches the Stanford idea, and abides by the Stanford
customs. But lately there has appeared a very small group of students
who have failed to grasp one of the Stanford principles—honor. Every
student registered in this University is on his honor to abide by the
rules of the Library regarding books and magazines, and the restric
tions placed by instructors on the books in certain courses. These rules
are made in order to give everyone a fair chance at all books and sources
of information. Those who take advantage of the fact that they are on
their honor not to take volumes from the Library, or to hide them, or
keep them overtime, are not only preventing other students from doing
their work, but marking themselves as unfit for responsibility and the
name of Stanford students.
It is this group of students that endanger student government in
the eyes of the faculty. They are a detriment to the student body, and
the sooner the Student Council takes action on such cases the better off
Stanford will be.
