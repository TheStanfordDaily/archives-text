# BELGIAN WAR DAMAGED PROPERTY IS REPAIRED
## Government Making Good Its Promise to Compensate People For Their Loss 
### P. H. SHEFFIELD (Written For the United Press 
BRUSSELS, Belgium, November 29.
â€”In virtue of number of degrees is
sued since the armistice, the Belgian
Government has steadily continued
the undertaking it gave a month pri
or to the armistice, to make good war
damage suffered by its peoples. One
of the most interesting categories in
this connection are the "little men,"
those whose loss is covered by a pay
ment of some ten thousand francs (at
par $2,000.) Ten thousand of these
have received sums totalling 36 mil
lion francs. The compensation is
mainly used for repairs to houses and
contents.
Throughout the country there are
societies of war claimants for com
pensation and these, operating in con
junction with the government dele
gates, carry out the formalities of
filing (claims. On satisfactory evi
dence, the government makes an ad
vance of seventy per cent of the 1914
value of the destroyed property, plus
the sum for re-investment which is
calculated on a basis of 2/ 2 in the
whole of the country except West
Flanders (the most devastated pro
vince) where the advance is Sy 3 . Ad
vances under these heads total 81
million francs and 3,300 houses are
thus being either rebuilt or repaired.
Claims under 15,000 are settled by
money payment; over that sum the
government places in the hands of
the above mentioned society or fed
eration securities on which the socie
ty or federation makes advances to
the interested parties.
All of these operations refer to pri
vate property. With regard to claims
made by manufacturers holding war
vouchers for property seized by the
Germans during the occupation, over
two thousand claims have been filed
and in satisfaction of these the gov
ernment han advanced on the security
of the war vouchers over 256 million
francs.
Big concerns of recognized public
utility, such as, for example, the Na
tional Road Car Company, the water
and dock companies, etc., have receiv
ed advances of some 250 mijlion
francs.
Under all heads of war damages
to persons and property, the total of
claims lodged is well over 1,250,000.
The largest number come from Court
rai (centre of fighting region) where
nearly a quarter of a million claims
were filed. To august 31, 1920, the
total number of claims settled ,by all
authorities and for all purposes was
74.714 representing a total amount of
1,893 million francs.
In West Flanders alone, 38,700
houses were destroyed and 8,00 dam
aged so as to be unliamtable. In*the
rest of the country the respective
figures were 25,000 and 3,500. Some
38,000 acres of land had also been
rendered unworkable. Churches, town
halls, schools, public offices, and other
national buildings were down or dam
aged all over the country. The gov
ernment plan in the restoration has
been to help those that help them
selves, by granting special financial
help, and making good any local
deficit.
Before a single brick could be laid,
much preliminary work had to be
done, this including restoration of
communications, restarting of the
water service, supply of temporary
housing accommodation, clearing
away of ruins, and preparing of ruined
land for agriculture. To date two
thirds of the agricultural lands de
stroyed have been restored. Concur
rently with the execution of the pre
liminary works, thousands of houses
and huts are being built, or have al
ready been built.
The Minister cf the Interior reports
that the whole of the government do
main. especially as regards communi
cations, is approaching complete
restoration and that industrial and
commercial establishments ar being
gradually re-formed. Owing to the
complex nature of the matter, the
restoration of private property is
proceeding more slowly.
