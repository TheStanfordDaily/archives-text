### United Press 
BERLIN, November 29. â€”What he
believes to be a cure for cancer of
the stomach has been discovered by
Dr. Rollin, famous Hamburg spcial
ist.
From the fact that this cancer is
found only in persons above 30 years
of age, Dr. Rollin concluded that the
blood and bodies of persons under
thirty contained some substance which
warded off cancer. As a result, he
experimented with blood infusion
from younger persons, and found that
the results were satisfactory and
rapid.
The Hamburg university has taken
up Itollin's work, and has already
concluded that, whether or not the
injection method is a cure, it surely
cfl'ects remarkable improvement. A
man, treated in the Eppendorfen hos
pital, has been released and is now
able to work.
The experiments will be carried on
further to develop whether the
method effects a lasting cure.
