# War Veterans Receive Medals at Gymnasium
## 
### 
Last week a few of the World War
veterans here filled out their applica
tions for their Victory Medals at the
R. O. T. C. headquarters in the gym
nasium. The field clerk with the appli
cations was late in arriving, and when
he came he had only a limited number
of blanks. He will be on the campus in
the near future for a day and will at
that time have enough applications for
the entire service body here.
Arrangements will be made with the
local military unit when the clerk will
be here again and his arrival will be
announced in the Daily Palo Alto.
