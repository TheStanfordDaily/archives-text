# RETIRED LIGHTWEIGHT CHAMPION DISCUSSES RING OF OLDEN DAYS
## Jack McAuliffe Rates Fighters of His Day Higher Than Boxing Artists of Today 
### HENRY L. FARRELL (United Press Staff Correspondent 
(United Prets Staff Correspondent)
NEW YORK, Nov. 29.—"Talk about
being hit a wallop, I'm just about
groggy from readin' a paper. I see
where Willie Jackson wants $50,000
for a chance to win the lightweight
championship."
Jack McAuliffe, retired and unde
feated lightweight champion, was un
burdening himself on the difference
between the old and the new fighters.
"Jackson wants a young gold mine
for a chance at a title that would
bring him a fortune. He wants close
to a $1,000 a minute for meeting
Leonard in a fifteen-round bout. Back
in November 1887, T fought 74 rounds
with Jim Carney in Revere, Mass., and
didn't get a red cent. Early in the
same year I went 28 rounds with
Harry Gilmore in Lawrence, Mass.,
and got $500. And we were fighting
with kid gloves.
"When I see one of these braves
pull up alongside Madison Square
Garden in a limousine and have a sec
retary and a manager announce his
arrival, I think of the old days when
we had to hide away from sheriffs and
sneak out under cover of darkness to
an old barn. When I see these high
financiers of the gloves enter the ring
in a silk dressing robe, with a barber's
art all over their faces and heads, I
gte weak thinking of our days when
a 'prize fighter' could be arrested just
for being found in a town.
"And all this chatter and argument
about weighing in. Why, when we
were roaming around the country, go
ing wild over a $100 purse we used to
agree verbally to a fight, weigh in
and then wait for the promoters to
find a place for the bout. Sometimes
is took forty-eight hours or longer and
we never weighed in again.
"Harry Gilmore, the champion of
Canada, was matched to fight me, on
January 11, 1887. We weighed in at
Boston and waited around two days
in a tavern for the promoters to find
a place. Two sleighs called for us the
second night and hauled us over to
Lawrence where a ring had been
rigged up in a blacksmith shop. We
found about thirty spectators keeping
warm around a big red hot wood
stove. On the floor above some kind
of a religious sect was singing. The
windows were covered with cloth and
we weren't allowed to make the slight
est noise. We fought 28 rounds. Gil
more was knocked out and I gave him
the room I had reserved in the tavern.
We went to three places that night,
but were denied admission. Finally
one of the party with me got a room
in a roadhouse and I sneaked in the
back way with a big coat over ray
head. We had to stay there three
days while the sheriff was hunting
for us.
"On November 16, the same year,
I was matched to fight Jim Carney.
We weighed in at South Farmingliam
and waited over a day until two old
carriages came in at dusk and hustled
us miles over to Revere, Mass. We
fought in a barn. The cows, horses,
pigs and chickens were moved over
to one end to make room for about
thirty spectators. We fought 74
rounds to a draw and then had to beat
it right out of the state.
"They were the days when the go
ing was hard. Look at the light
weights today. Jackson wanting $50,-
000 to box a champion with a pair
of pillows on his hands and Tendler
wanting $30,000 for a chance at a
championship crown.
"No wonder, that about knocks me
out, eh?"

a place. Two sleighs called for us the
second night and hauled us over to
Lawrence where a ring had been
rigged up in a blacksmith shop. We
found about thirty spectators keeping
warm around a big red hot wood
stove. On the floor above some kind
of a religious sect was singing. The
windows were covered with cloth and
we weren't allowed to make the slight
est noise. We fought 28 rounds. Gil
more was knocked out and I gave him
the room I had reserved in the tavern.
We went to three places that night,
but were denied admission. Finally
one of the party with me got a room
in a roadhouse and I sneaked in the
back way with a big coat over ray
head. We had to stay there three
days while the sheriff was hunting
for us.
"On November 16, the same year,
I was matched to fight Jim Carney.
We weighed in at South Farmingliam
and waited over a day until two old
carriages came in at dusk and hustled
us miles over to Revere, Mass. We
fought in a barn. The cows, horses,
pigs and chickens were moved over
to one end to make room for about
thirty spectators. We fought 74
rounds to a draw and then had to beat
it right out of the state.
"They were the days when the go
ing was hard. Look at the light
weights today. Jackson wanting $50,-
000 to box a champion with a pair
of pillows on his hands and Tendler
wanting $30,000 for a chance at a
championship crown.
"No wonder, that about knocks me
out, eh?"

NEW YORK, Nov. 29.—"Talk about
being hit a wallop, I'm just about
groggy from readin' a paper. I see
where Willie Jackson wants $50,000
for a chance to win the lightweight
championship."
Jack McAuliffe, retired and unde
feated lightweight champion, was un
burdening himself on the difference
between the old and the new fighters.
"Jackson wants a young gold mine
for a chance at a title that would
bring him a fortune. He wants close
to a $1,000 a minute for meeting
Leonard in a fifteen-round bout. Back
in November 1887, T fought 74 rounds
with Jim Carney in Revere, Mass., and
didn't get a red cent. Early in the
same year I went 28 rounds with
Harry Gilmore in Lawrence, Mass.,
and got $500. And we were fighting
with kid gloves.
"When I see one of these braves
pull up alongside Madison Square
Garden in a limousine and have a sec
retary and a manager announce his
arrival, I think of the old days when
we had to hide away from sheriffs and
sneak out under cover of darkness to
an old barn. When I see these high
financiers of the gloves enter the ring
in a silk dressing robe, with a barber's
art all over their faces and heads, I
gte weak thinking of our days when
a 'prize fighter' could be arrested just
for being found in a town.
"And all this chatter and argument
about weighing in. Why, when we
were roaming around the country, go
ing wild over a $100 purse we used to
agree verbally to a fight, weigh in
and then wait for the promoters to
find a place for the bout. Sometimes
is took forty-eight hours or longer and
we never weighed in again.
"Harry Gilmore, the champion of
Canada, was matched to fight me, on
January 11, 1887. We weighed in at
Boston and waited around two days
in a tavern for the promoters to find
a place. Two sleighs called for us the
