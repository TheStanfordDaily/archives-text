# CALIFORNIA COACH MAKES HIS CHOICE OF ALL-STAR ELEVEN
## 
### 
Coach Andy Smith, in choosing his
All-Pacific eleven, has accorded all
honor to his own first-string men,
picking the entire elevent as the team
best fitted to deserve the ,Ull<'. Ac
cording to his own explanation of his
choice, Smith considers each man
adapted to the style of play peculiar
to the California team as a whole, and
in order to keep the machine intact,
he keeps them all.
"Swede" Righter is not. given a
place on Smith's team because "most
of the California line gains were made
through 'Swede's' position in the Big
Game," claims the nine and Gold
coach.
Deems, Levy, and Righter were se
lected by Smith as second-string play
ers, and "Dink" Templeton was
chosen as half-back on the third
string.
"The only other possible first-team
choice would be Gillis, Hamilton,
Steers, and Righter," said Smith.
