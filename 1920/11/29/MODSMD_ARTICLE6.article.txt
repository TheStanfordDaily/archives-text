### United Press 
WASHINGTON, D. C., Nov. 29.â€”
That tiie President in his forthcoming
message to Congress may ask for im
mediate revision of the revenue laws
despite the decision of the Republican
leaders to postpone action until after
March 4 was indicated by officials at
the White House. They said that the
President would sign any bill making
a wise revision of the revenue laws.
Officials pointed out that the Presi
dent had twice before recommended
revision but Congress failed to act
on either recommendation.
As reflected in a statement of the
Secretary of the Treasury the Presi
dent believes in the redistribution of
taxes rather than any attempt to
lower them. He also holds that the
excess profits tax which was accept
able as a war measure should now be
repealed.
Whether the President would re
commend reconstruction of the treaty
or appear before Congress in person
was not^dicated.
