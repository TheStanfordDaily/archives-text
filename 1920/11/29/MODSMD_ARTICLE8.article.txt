## British Cabinet in Session Today Formulates Measure to Frustrate Incendiaries 
### United Press 
LONDON, Nov. 29.â€”Plans for the
protection of England against Sinn Fe'n
attacks were formulated today at a
meeting of the British cabinet. Full re
ports of the fires at Liverpool Saturday
night and the alleged incendiary* efforts
were laid before the ministers. Indica
tions that the ministers were concerned
over possibilities of further attempts in
London were given in the attendance of
General Howard, commissioner of po
lice, and Sir Basil Thompson.
Detailed maps of the shipping district
of Liverpool were found in possession of
one of the suspects arrested today in
Liverpool. The maps were marked to
show where fires were planned, accord
ing to the police, who said there Was
evidence that the plans had been laid
with great thoroughness.
One prisoner caught here after a
policeman frustrated a plot to start a
conflagration near the Redilous Market
was believed to have made important
admissions to the' police. He was ar
raigned and held, but officers did not
say in court what the prisoner had re
vealed.
One of the measures decided upon in
the conference of cabinet ministers with
police heads was that the houses of
Parliament would be absolutely closed to
the public. No one will be admitted to
the visitors' gallery and the public lobby
will be barred. .
