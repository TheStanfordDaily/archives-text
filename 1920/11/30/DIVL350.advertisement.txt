Mrs. Fox was bragging one day about the
large number of her cubs.
''How many cubs do you bring into the
world at one time?" she asked the LIONESS.
"Only ONE,'' replied the Lioness —"but it's
a LION."
MURADS COST 20 CENTS for a BOX

MURADS would be lower priced if we left out all
or part of the ]oti% Turkish tobaccos of the purest and

of Turkish tobacco.
But they wouldn't be MURADS —they'd only be
Foxes!
