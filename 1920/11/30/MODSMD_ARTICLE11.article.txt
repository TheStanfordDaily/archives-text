# WESTWICK CALLS FOR CROSS-COUNTRY MEN
## 
### 
Shortage of distance runners for
this year's track varsity has led A. T.
Westwick, '18, cross-country coach, to
issue a call for men to turn out im
mediately for cross-country work.
Competition will commence Thurs
day of this week for the plaque offer
ed last year by Dr. A. D. Browne for
cross country runs twice each week.
Scores are to be kept of the time
made by each runner over the two and
a half mile course and the man with
the best record will win the individual
award. Rousselot, '23, won the con
test last year.
Living group scores will also be
compiled and a suitably award will
be presented to the winning group.
Westwick urges men to turn out for
the contests whether they have been
out for cross country this year or not.
"California has an exceptionally
strong aggregation of distance men,"
he said today, "and the best way to
develop distance runners this year is
to get a large number of men out for
cross-country."
Among the men now out for cross
country are Rousselot, Perkins, Lil
jenstein, ClevelLnd, Beuter, K. Cran
dall. It. Crandall, Strain, McCombie,
Sid way, Kildale, Ely, Kaufl'man,
Booker and Davis.
