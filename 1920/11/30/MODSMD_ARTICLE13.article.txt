# SINN FEIN WAR DECLARED IS IRISH BELIEF
## Forces Renew Attack in London and Ireland; Uniform is Wore by Sinn Feiners 
### United Press 
LONDON, Nov. 30.â€”That tlie Sinn
Fein Parliament has formerly declaied
a slate of war with England was the
belief today of many officials at the Irish
office. The office has no direct informa
tion that war has been declared, but
evidence has been accumulating to indi
cate that such a step lias been taken.
Backed by the formal declaration, Sinn
Fein forces have renewed an attack on
British forces here and in Ireland.
The Dublin murders, the attack on
police control, culminating in the
slaughter of sixteen Black and Tan po
lice were regarded here today as the
work of men who regarded themselves
as carrying on a legalized war. The
soldiers who surrounded the police wore
uniforms and steel helmets, according to
dispatches today. This is regarded as an
attempt to conform to the regulations
of civilized warfare.
Never before have the Sinn Feincrs
appeared in uniform. Documents point
ing to declaration of war were printed
in the Freeman's Journal in Dublin,
which instructed that thirty soldiers
wounded in action should lie cared for.
The London constabulary reserves
were ordered in readiness for scrvice
today in case of further Sinn Fein out
breaks here. The reserves were organ
ized during the war, but have been in
active since the armistice. It is be]i.eved
they will be used for duty in case it L
necessary to patrol some sections of the
city more thoroughly.
