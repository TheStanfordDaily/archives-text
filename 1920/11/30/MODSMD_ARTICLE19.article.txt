# HUNTING LODGE TO BE THEME OF DECORATION
## Minor Factors to Be Carried to Perfection For Making Formal Most Pretentious 
### 
Skins, furs and outfits of the most
daring hunters of the campus will be
big factors in working up the effect of
the decorations for the Sophomore Co
tillion next Friday evening. The decora
tions, which will be something new in
campus social activities, are expected to
be the most pretentious of the year.
The gymnasium will be transformed
into an enormous hunting lodge. There
will be the usual old log fireplace with
its glowing lire. The walls will be built
up with real bark, making the appear
ance of huge logs, and the ceilings will
be boarded with rustic brown-colored
cardboard. The lighting effect, which of
course plays an important part in giv
ing the desired atmosphere, will be
worked out with old-fashioned lamps
and lanterns.
In all large formals the decorations
and music are the foundation of success.
The music is an easy problem and has
readily been taken care of by the com
mittee. Good music is assured, and as
to the decorations, hard work on the
part of the class members fill make the
affair a beautiful event.
Members of the 1923 class are asked
to report to the gymnasium Thursday
afternoon at 2 o'clock for work. Trie
decorations committee will be designated
by ribbons around their arms and will
give every person who comes to work
something to do.
