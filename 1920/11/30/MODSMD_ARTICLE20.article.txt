### 
President Wilbur and members of
the Stanford Faculty have been in
vited by Commissioner P. P. Claxton
of the United States Bureau of Edu
cation to participate in a general con
ference of education for the states of
California, Arizona, and Nevada, to
be held in Sacramento on Monday,
December 6.
This conference is the outcime of
the National Citizens' Conference on
Education held in Washington last
May. This year, however, instead of
having a single meeting twelve regi
onal conferences will be held.
To these conferences are invited
governors, chief school officers of the
States, members of the legislature,
state, county and city school officials,
representatives of the universities,
colleges, and normal schools and rep
resentatives of clubs and organiza
tions interested not merely in school
matters but in the welfare of their
community in general.
Commissioner Claxton in his letter
of invitation to President Wilbur says
that the conferences will be "for the
purpose of discussing the educational
situation at this time, legislation to
be presented to the legislatures of the
several states next year, sources of
income for the support of schools, the
means of continuing to foster such
interest among the people at large
nnd their representatives in legisla
tive bodies as may be necessary to
bring about the needed legislation."
