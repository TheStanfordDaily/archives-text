# SAN FRANCISCO ORCHESTRA WILL APPEAR TONIGHT
## Organist Allen Discusses the Symphony Program to Be Heard in Assembly Hall 
### 
Warren D. Allen, University organist,
assisted by Mrs. Elsie Cook Hughes,
last evening in the Little Theater dis
cussed the program to be played by the
San Francisco Symphony Orchestra at
8:15 in the Assembly Hall, outlining and
playing in duet arrangement selections
from two of the smphonies, Wagner's
prelude, "Die Meistersinger von Nurem
berg," and the "Fifth Symphony" of
Tschaikowsky.
This evening's program is ideal, Mr.
Allen said, since it comprises much fa
miliar music as well as some numbers
which arc very beautiful although not
so well known. Hut these arc of such
a selection that they are also interesting
to those not acquainted with them, as
they are easy to understand. Like a well
arranged dinner, the program chosen by
Alfred Hertz will have all the courses
of a wisely balanced musical feast.
Passing over the more familiar num
bers, such as Greig's "Peer Gynt Suite,"
Mr. Allen explained the various choirs
represented by the four groups of in
struments, string, brass, wood wind and
percussion, the tones of which are easily
discernable in the symphony arrange
ment of the shorter selections.
Musical ideas are always definite, Mr.
Allen said. Those expressed in Wag
ner's music are intensely so, and it is
therefore necessary to know the story
of his compositions. "Die Meistersinger"
describes the competition among aspir
ants for the hand of the daughter of
the leader of a musical guild who has
offered her as a prize for the one who
shall write the best song. The number is
rich in colorful passages and includes
four movements, the musical descrip
tion beginning in the overture, which
affords opportunity for the dramatic
welding of ideas and music and con
tains the themes developed in the later
movements. These reach a triumphant
climax in the finale, and in this last
movement the four themes are played
simultaneously.
Tschaikowsky, the great dramatic
composer, whose "Fifth Symphony" is
to be played tonight, has used a peculiar
device in this composition, making it
different from the usual symphony ar
rangement, which contains four move
ments not ordinarily having much in
common. It is given unusual unity by a
master theme which appears in each
movement, with some variation, and
which forms a link connecting the dif
ferent themes, uniting with that of the
last movement in the closing notes.
The entire program which will be
played by the Symphony Orchestra thio
