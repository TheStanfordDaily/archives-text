# WHY NOT THE FACULTY?

### 
Stanford has developed a remarkable democratic spirit within the
student body, partly because of the "hello" idea. This method is suc
cessful in knitting the student body closer together, but not in bringing
the faculty and students into closer relation. There is need for such a re
lation, and the solution might be obtained by applying the Rotary Club
Idea. Members of the Rotary Club are chosen from among different
professions and businesses, and one of the requirements of the meet
ings is that the members address each other by their first names.
Such a method might bring the faculty and students closer, if the
faculty men would be more cordial to the students when meetfng them
on the Quad, and address them by their first names if possible, or as
"Jones and Smith," not as "Mr. Jones and Mr. Smith." The students
will appreciate it, and it can easily be the means by which the instructor
can become better acquainted with his students and understand them
better. A professor need not sacrifice his dignity, for if he cannot meet
a student or a group of students in an informal way without losing
dignity he is not fit for his place.
The bond could be made closer if the fraternities would invite the
faculty men more to their houses for informal discussion, and the fac
ulty men might reciprocate to some extent.
