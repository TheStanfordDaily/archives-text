# GEOLOGY SMOKER WILL BE HELD TOMORROW
## 
### 
There will be a smoker of the Geol
ogy and Mining departments at the
Union tomorrow night at 7:30. The
committee in charge claims that this
will be one of the best get-togethers
held by these departments in years.
They have arranged to have several
interesting speeches. J. P. Smith will
tell of the "Good Old Doys," "Chief"
Tolman wili give his Milk-Snake story
and Danny Carroll will talk on the
"Geology and Mining" department and
what it stands for hero at Stanford.
Plenty of smokes, stunts, scraps, jazz,
and eats will help to fill out the pro
gram. All Geology and Mining ma
jors are expected to be there. The
smoger is open to Lower Division men
who are expecting to major in these
subjects, and is a good chance for
them to get to meet the professors
and to "get on the boat."
