# CHARLES L. WAGNER IS CONCERT MANAGER
## 
### 
Charles L. Wagner, who has charge of
the Healy concert to he given next Fri
day night in the Assembly Hall, is the
manager of the world's greatest concert
singer, John McCormack. Mr. Wagner
will not send any artist on tour who has
not stood the test in the great concert
halls of the East. The mere fact that
Mr. Wagner will book an artist is ac
cepted by the local managers as a guar
antee of the artist's excellence, there
fore Manager Frank W. Healy antici
pates that a great treat is in store for
all who attend the concert to he given
by Charles Hackett, the American tenor,
and Raoul Vidas, the Rumanian-French
violinist, who are both under the man
agement of Charles L. Wagner.
Raoul Yidas, though hut 18 years of
age, is, according to the critic of the
Musical Courier, a great artist. After
his recital last week in New York the
critic of the Musical Courier declared
he was complete and satisfying in every
degree. He appeared the following day
as soloist for the New York Symphony
Orchestra.
Tickets for this concert are on sale
now at Crandall's, Palo Alto, and Ad
ministration Building, Stanford Univer
sity.
