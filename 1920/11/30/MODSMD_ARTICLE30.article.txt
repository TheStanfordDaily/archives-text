In an effort to aid Stanford men an d women to become better acquainted
with members of the faculty, and to learn of their successes in the educational
world, The Daily Palo Alto has prepared a series of articles on prominent
faculty men, the first of which appears below.—Editor.

Administrator, author and teacher,
Charles Andrews Huston occupies a
unique position in the life of Stanford.
Dean of the Law Department, lie molds
the policy and directs the detail to a
greater extent than any other one man
of Stanford's second largest professional
school. As an author, Dean Huston's
books and articles are authoritative to
students of legal doctrine. To those who
enroll in his classes he is primarily the
teacher who, despite his other duties,
devotes a large portion of his time to
guiding the law student towards the bar
examination.
Born in Eastern Canada, Stratford,
Ontario, on May 5, 1876, Charles Huston
completed his secondary education in
Canadian schools. Entrance into uni
versity being immediately impossible, he
began teaching in the rural schools of
Manitoba in 1894. Five years of teach
ing followed, enabling him to enter the
University of Manitoba, where he spent
the first year of his college course.
The larger opportunities of an Amer
ican university impeled him to enroll in
the University of Chicago in 1900. Dur
ing the following six years, with the
completion of the law training as his
aim, he alternated between study and
teaching. First a Fellow in Political
Economy at the University of Chicago
and later as an instructor of rhetoric,
he maintained his teaching with his class
work and by 1906 had completed the
legal course. -•
Fortunately, teaching did not seriously

interefer with his college life, for he was
elected to three honorary fraternities
and actively participated in intercol
legiate debating. An unusual aftermath
of his college career was his delivery
of the commencement oration at the
University of Chicago in 1916, being the
first alumnus of the university to return
to deliver a commencement address.
A law partnership had been accepted
when Dean Abbott of the Stanford Law
School offered him a position as in
structor of law at Stanford in 1906. For
the last fourteen years Professor Hus
ton has been at Stanford. Given the
chair of Professor of Law in 1911, he
was the choice for Dean of the Law
School vacated five years later by the
resignation of Dean Woodward.
Advance research work in legal
theory has occupied much of Dean
Huston's attention in recent years. In
1913 he was awarded the degree of S. J.
D. by the Harvard Law School follow
ing a year of study in the Eastern uni
versity. "Enforcement of Decrees in
Equity," published in 1915, embodies the
result of several years of research in
vestigation. An interesting illustration
of the recognition accorded to his work
was the advice recently given by Justice
Holmes of the Supreme Court to a law
yer that he should familiarize himself
with the Huston text of 1915.
In 1909 Dean Huston married Miss
Margaret Davidson of Chicago, a fellow
student and instructor at the University
of Chicago.
