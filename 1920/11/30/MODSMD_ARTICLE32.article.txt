# those who plan to HEAR FOWLER ASKED TO TELL COMMITTEE
## 
### 
All persons planning to attend the
meeting of the Stanford Chapter of the
American Journalists' Association at the
Alpha Sigma Phi house tomorrow even
ing have been urged to inform Professor
E. W. Smith,chairman of the committee
on arrangements, immediately. Begbie
Fowler, '06, former editor of the Daily
Palo Alto and now business manager of
the San Francisco Chronicle, will speak
to the journalists.
The Stanford Chapter of the associa
tion welcomes, all persons interested in
newspaper work to its meetings, al
though they may not be technically
eligible to membership.
If, for some reason, anyone inter
ested will not be able to attend the din
ner at 6:15 o'clock tomorrow evening,
they have been invited to drop in later
to hear Fowler speak and to take part in
the discussion. Begbie Fowler is a man
whom anyone at all interested in jour
nalism will want to hear, as he began at
the very bottom, as an errand boy, and
worked up to his present position. His
connection with campus journalism in
former times will also bring what he has
to say closer to Stanford men and
women, lie will take as his subject
"Journalistic Responsibilities."
The dinner will be informal and will
cost 50 cents a plate.
