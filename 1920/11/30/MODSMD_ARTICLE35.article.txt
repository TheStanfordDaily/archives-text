## 
### United Press 
HARRISBURG, Pa., Nov. 30.—Six
important problems confronting the
states at the present time were scheduled
to be taken up at the governors' confer
ence here, December 1, 2, and 3. About
35 governors and from 10 to 15 gov
ernors-elect are expected to be present.
Federal encroachment on state author
ity and functions are to be discussed by
Governors Robert A. Cooper of South
Carolina and Robert D. Carey of Wyo
ming in papers on "The Decentralization
of Governmental Functions and Activi
ties." •
Governor Frank O. Lowden of Illinois
and Governor Percival Clement of Ver
mont have also been asked by Miles C.
Riley, secretary of the conference, to
prepare papers on the same topic.
State railroad commissioners, who are
vitally interested in the question of fed
eral usurpation of state authority on ac
count of the powers granted the inter
state commerce commission, will present
a report through their national organiza
tion. Member sof the commission on
uniform state laws will also have some
thing to say on the subject.
The report of the Lockwood commis
sion in New York State, charging com
bines and intrigues among contractors,
material men, and labor leaders and al
leging the existence of "graft on a royai
scale," will undoubtedly be taken up by
Governor Alfred E. Smith of New York
in a discussion of "Housing Problems
and Ways and Means of Promoting
Hume Ownership." The housing prob
lem is particularly acute in urban dis
tricts, and the revelations made to the
investigators furnish one clue to the
reasons for the crisis.
The rural phase of the houseing prob
lem will be a nimportant part of a dis
cussion on the South Dakota rurai
credits law by Governor Peter Norbcck
of that state. The South Dakota law 1j
deigned to provide state loans to pros
pective farm owners.
The Kansas industrial relations court,
bitterly assailed by Samuel Gompers and
other labor leaders and as ardently de
fended by its authors, will be discussed
by Governor Henry J. Allen. Governoi
Allen was the principal figure in the
enactment of the law, designed to pre
vent industrial disputes and troubles.
The topic will probably pave the way
for a general discussion by the governors
of the entire labor situation.
Governor William C. Sproul of Penn
sylvania wil laddress the conference on
"State Income and Disbursements." He
will take up in his paper means of pro
viding money to meet increases in state
expenses.
"The Budget and State Business
Methods" will be discussed by Gov
ernor John G. Townsend of Delaware.
The sixth topic scheduled for discus
sion will be "The General Agricultural
Situation, 1 * phases of which will be
taken up by Governor John M. Parker
of Louisiana.
