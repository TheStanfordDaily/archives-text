# Blind See With Skins Says French Scientist
## 
### HENRY WOOD (United Press Staff Correspondent 
PARIS, Nov. 30.—"And the blind
shall see" —not with their sightless
eyes, but with their skin.
This is the serious declaration of
Professor Louis Farigoule, noted as a
scientist, and noted almost equally as
well as a poet, under the name of
Jules Romains.
As the result tof a long series of ex
periments made upon hypnotized sub
jects, Professor Farigoule is convin
ced that the skin through certain
nerve ends has the faculty of vision.
He believes that this facutly of the
skin to see existed in the human body
before vision was developed by means
of the eyes. Since then, naturally, the
faculty of the skin to see has been
all but lost through lack of use.
By a proper system of education,
however, Professor Farigoule is con
vinced that these nerve centers and
ends in the skin can be re-educated to
exercise their original functions.
What this would mean for the blind
and especially for those who lost their
vision by means of the eyes during
the war, is the great underlying inspi
ration that is pushing Professor Fari
goule on to further experiments.
He has just published the results of
his first experiments that have caused
him to arrive at the above conclusions.
To date Professor Farigoule's experi
ments have been conducted largely
with hypnotizd subjects reawakened
to a certon "regime of consciousness."
By means of specially made instru
ments and by a method of controlling
the experiments that eliminate all
possibility of either the sense of touch
or the sense of smell playing any part
in the recognition of objects, Profes
sor Farigoule declares he has de
monstrated that the skin can actually
see and recognize both the color and
form of exterior objects. Farigoule
has demonstrated that this vision by
means of the skin takes place through
"ocelles" or microscopic nerve termin
als situated in the skin.
All that is necessary to see by
means of the skin is that several
square inches on any part of the body,
be exposed faco to face with the ob
ject to be perceived together with a
minimum amount of light.
Professor Farigoule in one of his
experiments chose five subjects and
all with the same results. By means
of their skin they were able to read
newspapers, decipher numbers, and
recognize pieces of furniture —and all
equally as well with the skin on their
backs as on their chests or faces.
Professor Farigoule is convinced
that this faculty lies latent with every
human being and that only a proper
system of education is necessary to
restore it to its normal function.
