# JAPANESE WOMEN TAKE POSITIONS IN GOVERNMENT OFFICES

### HENRY W. KINNEY (United Press Staff Correspondent 
TOKYO (By Mail). â€”The inroads
which Japanese women are beginning to
make into various fields of activities
heretofore monopolized hy men, are in
creasing day by day, and even in gov
ernment offices are representatives of
the sterner sex being forced to yield to
their weaker sisters.
Although it is generally said that
women have no head for figures, the
statistical section of the Department of
Agriculture was one of the first govern
ment branches to employ women in cler
ical capacities, although they have for
some time past served as telephone
operators. The experiment has been de
clared such a success that hereafter the
forestry offices will follow the example,
and girls will be allowed to enter the
service as clerks or stenographers. Their
pay as such will run from 35 cents to
65 cents a day, which is not so bar for
Japan.
Women are also being employed re
cently as detectives, as it has been found
that they are particularly useful in cer
tain lines where men fail. "We have
found female detectives very useful,"
says the head of one of the Tokyo police
precincts. "Men cannot be used for
shadowing women, while women detec
tives do this very well. We do not, how
ever, employ women who are too good
looking. We have already a number of
women on our detective force, ranging
in age from 20 to 40 years. One of these
was formerly an actress, while others
come from various other walks of lite."
