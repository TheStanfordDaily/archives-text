### United Press 
SEATTLE, Wash., Nov. 30.—The
bodies of Captain A. B. Jensen ana
Mate P. Hohmann of the schooner VV.
J. Pirrie, lost in last Friday's storm off
the Quillayute river, were found toda>
by Indians, washed up on the beach at
Cape Johnson, according to a message
received here today. Two sailors were
found alive.
Captain Jensen was a native of Den
mark, but had become a naturalized
Chinlean. He was 30 years old. With
him on the ill-fated ship was his wife,
aged 21. and his one-year-old son,
Haakon Jensen. They are both Relieved
to have perished.
The others were probably drowned or
killed when the ship struck James Island.
Besides the commander and sailors,
Frederick J. Breckenridge, 47, purser, a
citizen of the United States, and J. W.
Gerossalnd, 54, chief engineer, perished.
Gerossland has a family and home at
Oakland, Cal., where he has a wife.
Charles Peterson, 21, American, second
engineer, and John Lamplat, boatswain,
and others are known to have perished.
No word of the ship had been re
ceived from Friday until early today,
when a wireless brought hope that she
might be saved. This message reported
a vessel answering her description liad
been sighted at sea. Not an hour later
came a message by wireless from the
Weather Bureau at Calland Bay report
ing that Indians who had been sent out
by W. R. Grace & Co., owners of the
Pirrie, to patrol the shore, had found the
bodies of the captain and mate, together
with two sailors, who were still alive
but near exhaustion, on the beach at
Cape Johnson.
Early advices indicated the sailors
were too near dead to talk. They were
taken by the Indians to Lapush, an In
dian settlement on the bleak Washington
coast, where they arc being cared for
today.
The Pirrie, towed by the Santa Rita,
left Tacoma Wednescday bound for the
west coast of South America with a
lumber cago. She was fully equipped
with sails but was being towed because
of greater speed. The two ships had
passed Cape Flattery and were proceed
ing down the coast when the storm
burst Friday. The southwest gales threw
up immense seas over 30 feet high and
gradually drove the ships toward James
Island.
After battling for hours the Santa
Rita was at last forced to cut the harbor.
The Santa Rita narrowly escaped gohig
on the rocks itself, winning the open
sea only after a Herculean battle.
