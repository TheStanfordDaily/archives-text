# CALIFORNIA PLANS FOOTBALL STADIUM

### 
UNIVERISTY OF CALIFORNIA.
Nov. 30.â€”Specifications for an $800,000
concrete stadium are under considera
tion, according to Graduate Manager
Luther A. Nichols. Approximately $90,-
000 in gate receipts was lost in the
Stanford-California game recently held
here because of the lack of seating ca
pacity offered by the present wooden
bleachers.
Plans for the erection of the stadium
were originally drawn by Professor J.
G. Howard five years ago. The initial
amount necessary to begin construction
will be met by a subscription among the
students and alumni. Graduates will be
canvassed to purchase scats for the foot
ball games a number of years in advance
in order that money may be secured to
aid in building the stadium.
