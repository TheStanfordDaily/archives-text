# MURAL QUINTETS PLAY PRACTICE GAMES
## 
### 
With men from fifty-four organiza
tions practicing in the gymnasium the
intra-mural basket ball league is work
ing hard preparatory to the starting
of the schedule next week. The crowd
ed condition of the courts keeps a
good many of the players on the side
lines but practice is going steadily 011
in most of the aggregations and the
informal games that run through
every afternoon give all the players a
chance to get into the fray at some
time or other during the afternoon.
Last night the Theta Chis played
the quintet from Beta Theta Pi. The
game was a rough and tumble fight
from the start but a lot of good ma
terial showed up in the guard and
center positions. As usual at the
outset of the season there was ragged
basket shooting, the Betas making
four completions out of about twenty
chances. Their guarding was working
well though and the Theta Chi five
was held down to five points, all of
which were made on foul baskets.
Tlogle shooting baskets for the Theta
("his dropped the sphere through the
wires for five out of seven tries.
Managers of the various organiza
tion teams have signed up for one of
the courts every afternoon this week.
Floor space in the gymnasium is at a
premium, and Mr. C. S. Botsford in
charge of the intra-mural sports is
anxious that all managers come to the
gym and make reservations there for
a court upon which they may practice
their team before they play their first
game.
