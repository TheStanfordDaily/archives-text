# ALFRED HERTZ PRESENTS WELL CHOSEN PROGRAM
## Tschaikowsky, Wagner Numbers Brilliantly Interpreted by Symphony Orchestra 
### Mary Jane Clark, '22 
Alfred Hertz, with his eighty mu
sicians, in the opening concert of the
symphony series last evening, pre
sented a program remarkably well
chosen and interpreted with that
masterful artistry of which only the
gifted conductor is capable. The en
tire concert was a revelation of the
powers of the symphony orchestra and
reached its greatest effectiveness in
the two magnificent numbers, Tschai
kowsky's "Fifth Symphony," and the
"Prelude to the Mastersingers" of
Wagner, which began and closed the
program. The other two groups,
Grieg's "Peer Gynt Suite," and the
four shorter selections, brilliantly and
sympathetically played, formed a
pleasing contrast to the two longer
and more profound symphonies.
A concert is rarely given in which
the place of honor in the arrangement
of the program is not given to a sym
phony. The selections last evening,
however, were all equally received
with manifested enthusiasm, each
number played having its own intrin
sic appeal and making the program a
series of master pieces, perfect in
orchestral color and complete in
range.
Tschaikowsky's Symphony, suggest
ive of the melancholy temperament
of its composer, was played with a
boldness which emphasized its varied
contrasts and yet recalled a strain of
passionate melancholy- There ' was
much that was light and joyful, par
ticularly in the second and third move
ments, but these were still pervaded
by a feeling of struggle and revolt.
The finale rose to an almost over
powering motive of the introduction.
Wagner, the greatest musical drama
tist, in his "Prelude to the Master
singers has created a direct and con
sistent drama which proceeds without
a pause through its five themes, in
creasing in complexity of composition,
but still clear in dramatic action.
Even in the strange and bewildering
combinations of movement and har
mony, Alfred Hortz preserved the
story of the "Mastersingers" to the
finale ,in which the principal ideas
return once mere, to combine with
new themes which they suggest.
"Peer Gynt," the beloved incidental
arrangement for Ibsen's drama, was
charmingly interpreted in a purely
lyric manner, emphasizing its melody
and poetic suggestion. The four epi
sodes possess a peculiar, weird kind
of harmony, creating an atmosphere
of melancholy suggestive of the le
gends of the North. This was devel
oped with genuine feeling, touched
with sponeity of interpretation.
In the shorter selections the perfec
tion of the symphony was easily dis
cernable. Luigini's "Aubade," a de
lightful number, played by wood
winds, the French horn and the harp,
was a delicate description of dawn.
The "Evocation" of Massenet, well
known to all music lovers, played
with muted 'cello and string accompa
niment, revealed the purity of style
and truth of feeling characteristic of
Massenet. Horace Britt received en
thusiastic applause in his interpreta
tion of the 'cello solo.
The "Music Box" by Liadow, was
a number which made instant appeal
through its whimsical theme, as well
as the realistic imitation of an old
fashioned music box given by an ar
rangement of two flutes, piccolo, three
clarinets, bells and harp. "Troumerei"
recalled the magic of Schumann's
musical poetry and was played with
quiet simplicity and with careful shad
ings of tone.
