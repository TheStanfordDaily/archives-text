# ARMENIA'S FATE IS IN HANDS OF U.S. PRESIDENT

### United Press United Press 
WASHINGTON, Dec. I.—The fate
of Armenia today lay in the hands of
President Wilson. The President has
undertaken to save the Armenian nation
from the Turkish Nationalists by ac
cepting the League of Nations' invita
tion to act as mediator between the two
countries. He has also before him the
outlining of the boundaries of the new
Armenian nation.
Following the cabinet meeting yester
day the President was described as "be
ing stimulated by the new work he has
courageously undertaken." Senators
who have opposed Wilson's foreign pol
icy were slow today in offering criticism
of the President's acceptance.
In accepting, the President made clear
that his decision must be guaranteed by
the principal powers.
Soviet Russia may prove an obstruc
tion to peace. The Bolsheviki have been
active in spreading propaganda in Aze
reaijan, sister republic to Armenia, and
reports here indicate that Armenia has
leaned toward Russia for protection.
The Turks also may oppose the
boundaries of Armenia set by the Presi
dent, who is known to favor a large
Armenian nation.

GENEVA, Dec. I.—The commission
on membership voted today to recom
mend the admission of Austria to the
League of Nations. The action was ex
pected. The date had been looked for
when the proposal reached the assembly
floor, and as the vote was unanimous
it would appear there will be no opposi
tion to the new member.
An interpretation of the penalty
clause of the league covenant was agreed
upon by the commission, headed by Lord
Robert Cecil. A resolution adopted to
day provided that all members of the
league must discontinue official diplo
matic relations with a state blockaded
because of infractions of the covenant.
It was also agreed to propose that
the inhabitants of the member states
shall break oil all relations with the
penalized state.
President Wilson's acceptance of arbi
tration in America was received with
great enthusiasm in the assembly today.
A note of thanks was ordered prepared
and dispatched to Washington.
