question by means of treaty will en
counter opposition in the Senate where

ready to oppose any treaty the State

citizenship of Japanese in this coun
try are no fit subjects for treaty that
the United States make no concession
to Japan 10 long as Japan holds Mar
shall and Sadron Islands in the Pa
cific..
That a treaty would prove as in
effective as the gentlemen's agree
ment and other understandings of the
two governments in the past is solv
ing the problem.

assimilation of the Japaneso is im

treaty annulling the California alien
land act, was adopted at a mass meet
ing last night. Copies are to be for
