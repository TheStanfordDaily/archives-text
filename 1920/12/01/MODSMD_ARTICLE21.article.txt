# TROJAN PLAYERS NOT ADMITTED TO P.C.C. CONFERENCE
## Membership is Unanimously Refused to University of Southern California 
### 
The University of Southern Cali
fornia was refused membership in the
Pacific Coast Conference by the un
animous decision of the conference
officials yesterday afternoon. The
chief objection to admitting the Tro
jans to the conference was the great
distance of the southern institution
from the colleges now in the associa
tion.
By official statement given out by
the conference heads follws:
"By an unanimous vote the Pa
cific Coast Conference decided
adversely on the application pre
sented by the University of South
ern California.
"The great distance between the
Los Angeles school and the Wash
ington and Oregon colleges involv
ing a great amount of time away
from school and studies together
with the great financial problems
connected with such trips are the
reasons for the denial of the ap
plication.
"The P. C. C. delegates are well
satisfied with the scholastic stand
ing of U. S. C. and its willingness
to abide by the conference eligi
bility rules."
