# VIDAS AND HACKETT 10 GIVE DOUBLE CONCERT
## Both Artists Will Appear In Full Programs In First of Healy Series Next Friday 
### 
Charles Hackett, the lyric tenor of the
Metropolitan, who will appear in double
concert with Raoul Vidas, Friday night,
is now believed to be at the zenith of
his vocal splendor. He has everything
a great singer should have, a beautiful
voice, intelligence, clarity of enuncia
tion, and the ability to interpret in a
masterly manner. When he sings Friday
night he will be representative of the
best that the Metropolitan Opera House
has to offer.
The same is true of Vidas, with the
exception that Vidas is a much younger
artist than Hackett. However, Vidas'
career began earlier. Vidas is one of
the very few artists of the first rank
who now and then approach that state
of perfection of which critics speak so
authoritatively whether they refer to
genius or novice. Vidas is considered a
master at eighteen years of age, only
because he is endowed with a special
talent for the violin.
Tickets for the Hackett-Vidas con
cert, which will be a double concert,
each artist giving as much on this occa
sion as he ordinarily does at a single
recital, are on sale at Crandall's in
Palo Alto and at the Administration
Building.
