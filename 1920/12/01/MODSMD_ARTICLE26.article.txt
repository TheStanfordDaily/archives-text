# THE
						U. S. C. REQUEST
## 
### 
Because of financial reasons, and the distance between the univer
sities on the coast, the Pacific Coast Conference has refused the Uni
versity of Southern California admittance to the Conference. All of the
Conference members were of the same sentiment and no one university
prevented the southern institution from entering, as the report of the
meeting states that the vote was unanimous.
The action of the Conference delegates in refusing the U. S. C.
request is clear, and there is no cause for animosity on the part of the
southerners. The Conference is young, and has yet to prove its com
plete success. It was formed with the idea of incorporating the two
most prominent universities in each of the three states to promote clean
and spirited intercollegiate competition. The association has so far
proven a success, although at times differences of opinion have threat
ened to wreck the organization. The financial end has not been entirely
solved, due to the long jumps between the present members, and the
quarrels between some of the larger and smaller institutions over the
division of gate receipts. The organization is a success in the minds
of the students and the athletic authorities, but there is still a small
group of faculty men in the member universities that do not approve of
their teams leaving the campus to fulfill their schedules. All of these
problems will have to be solved before the Conference idea is a success
here in the West, as it is in the Middle Western and Eastern States.
When success is assured, expansion is in order, and undoubtedly the
University of Southern California will be the first institution to be
admitted. It has earned the right, and it will receive it when the proper
time arrives.
When the success of the movement is finally assured, there should
be nothing to prevent the smaller colleges on the coast, such as Santa
Clara, St. Mary's, Occidental, Whitman, and Willamette to form a lower
division of the Conference, and the winner to play the champions of the
upper division. The smaller institutions produce strong teams in certain
branches of athletics and they should be given a chance to win coast
titles.
