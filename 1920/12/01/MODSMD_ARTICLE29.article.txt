# Sinn Feiners Enlist Army of 300,000 Men

### RUSSELL BROWNING (United Press Staff Correspondent 
DUBLIN, Nov. 18 (By Mail).—The
volunteer "Irish Republican Army" now
numbers over 300,000 officers and men,
according to a statement of a Sinn Fein
brigadier-general to the United Press.
"Lack of munitions and artillery pre
vent this force from actively taking the
field in uniformed combat with the Brit
ish military in Ireland," explained the
Sinn Fein leader, "but the colunteers
will continue to carry out the openly
adopted policy of physical resistance
to the English army of occupation."
The Sinn Fein army is unique in that
its members actually pay to belong to it
instead of receiving any monetary com
pensation for their services. A sum of
sixpence weekly is paid by each man,
officer and soldier alike. No favoritism
is shown in the selection of officers, and
it is said that there is no single incident
of a volunteer refusing to carry out the
orders of his superior.
Decentralized authority for local raids
and minor offensives by company com
manders under the general orders for
concerted action of the brigade com
mander is in effect in all districts, with
the exception of the larger cities, where
the higher leaders direct all activities.
In the recent conflicts in County Kerry,
immediately following the death of Lord
Mayor MacSwiney, a general offensive
was ordered, in retaliation, so a Sinn
Fein leader told the United Press, for a
suddenly intensified activity on the part
of the police and military. Eighteen sol
diers and policemen were killed in the
resultant fighting, and about twenty-five
wounded.
Each company is intrusted with the
task of securing their own arms and in
most cases funds with which to carry
out their various missions. Sinn Fein
has large funds, and in the words of a
prominent business man of Cork, "can
get more where that comes from ' —
namely, popular subscription to the re
cent "Irish Republican Loan" and funds
raised by various Irish societies, but a
big expense is entialed in caring for the
families of men in jail or who are flee
ing from the British authorities.
The system of communications useu
by Sinn Feiners is not officially known,
but is is known that they are surpris
ingly well posted on nearly all events
affecting them and sometimes the news
of an attack on military or police or the
burning of an Irish village by Black and
Tan police in a distant and isolated sec
tion of the country is known to the Sinn
Fein leaders before it has comc over the
telegraph wires to the British authori
ties.
