# Mission Restoration Plans To Be Outlined At Del Monte Meeting
## 
### 
Definite plans for the restoration and
preservation of the old Spanish missions
in the state will he outlined at a meeting
of the California Mission Restoration
Association to be held at Del Monte
next Saturday.
The association is comprised of a
California group of historical, civic, and
commercial bodies and individual men
and women interested in restoring and
preserving the old missions of the state.
It has been pointed out by archeol
ogists and Spanish mission architectural
authorities that the original lines of the
California missions can be restored and
preserved for California and all America
without destroying the pristine archi
tecture and beauty of the mission units
of another California day. The missions
of the old Spanish padre explorers may
again be the Mecca for travelers through
the physical restoration of the mission
groups and the preservation of their
historical and commercial value.
Those attending the conference on
Saturday will be given an opportunity
to learn what the physical restoration
and preservation of the California mis
sions will mean by a trip to Carmel Mis
sion. Here, Raymond M. Mestres, Span
ish diocesan padre, who has devoted
twenty-nine years to the study of Cali
fornia missions, is engaged in restoring
the original Carmel Mission Quadrangle.
These excavations will have reached the
most interesting period by the day of
the conference.
The original records of the old Span
ish padres are kept at Carmel, which is
also the burial place of Father Junipero
Serra, the founder of the missions, and
many of his associate padres who de
voted years of labor and sacrifice to
blazing civilization's way in California
before the thirteen colonies had estab
lished an American Republic on the
Atlantic Coast.
The Del Monte conference will be
attended by scores of prominent and
patriotic California men and women
who are determined that the missions—
the most important factor of early Cali
fornia history—shall not go into further
decline and decay.
The restoration plan to be worked out
at this conference may contemplate
work extending over a period of years
until this chain of landmarks, separated
one day's walking distance along El
Camino Real, again become accessible
and of interest to travelers. For this
reason it is most impprtant that every
historical, civic and commercial and
public-spirited group in California be
represented.
