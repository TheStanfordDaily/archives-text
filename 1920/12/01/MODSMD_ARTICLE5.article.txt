# COACH MALONEY HAS STRONG FIFTEEN TO MEET U. C. RUGGERS
## 
### 
When the Stanford rugby-team goes
on the field against California next
Saturday, it will do so with the idea
of partly avenging the defeat of the
Big Game. Several of the men who
were on the varsity football squad are
now out for rugby, and will probably
get into the game against the* Blue
and Gold ruggers.
Coach Maloney is having practice
games every afternoon now, in order
to fully condition the men, and to
give them an opportunity to make use
of the information he has given them.
Danny Carroll, '16, has been working
out the forwards, and expects to have
a well organized pack by Saturday.
Word has been received from Ber
keley that the California fifteen is
being put through intensive training
during the last few days before the
game with Stanford, Saturday. U. C.
has a large squad to pick from and
can put two or three teams of nearly
equal stnength on the field.
Stanford, during the early part of
the season, was handicapped by a
scarcity of material, and the coach
was unable to make substitutions dur
ing the games without materially
weakening the fifteen. Due to the re
cent large turnouts for the English
game, however, Maloney will have a
set of good men in reserve.
