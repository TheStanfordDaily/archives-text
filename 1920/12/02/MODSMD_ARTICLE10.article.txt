# SOCCER TEAMS HOLD FINAL PRACTICE GAMES
## Coach Maloney's Squad Meeting California Strengthened by American Football Men 
### 
Final practices are being held by the
varsity soccer team in preparation foi
the game with California here Satur
day, and the men who will go on the
field are all in splendid condition. Coach
Maloney is confident that the team will
wipe up the Blue and Gold, unless some
unforeseen accident occurs.
Important changes will be made in
the forward line and these shifts arc
counted on to strengthen the team to a
great extent. The backl\eld will be
practically the same combination that
faced California on November 20. The
complete lineup has hot yet been decided
on, but will be published tomorrow.
Advantage will be gained from the
fact that the game will be played on
the Stanford Turf, so that even with
rainy weather the forward line will not
be so badly handicapped as it was on
the California Field. Lack of teatnwork
is always the result when playing on a
muddy field, and chances for a last
game Saturday look good, especially if
the weather remains clear.
A new source of strength in the for
ward line has been received from the
varsity American football team in Camp
bell, who is playing a good brand of
soccer at inside right. Another change
to be made is the placing of Masters at
goal. Captain Harvey Newland, who
has been playing in this position, has
been moved to center forward. Peavy
and Struss are fighting it out for inside
left. Mendoza will play outside right in
place of Green, who is not eligible fot
thi sseason. Outside left has four claim
ants in Clark, Mead, Titus and Hays.
Strice has recovered from the injury
to his knee and will be in shape for the
game, although Maloney may not use
him for more than one half.
The freshmen will meet the Bruin
in a soccer game Saturday. Cap
tain Todd and his men have been work-
ing hard and have developed a good
team. The game, however, will be cx
ceedingly close, perhaps a tie, as the
squads are nearly of equal strength. If
the freshmen recover from their attack
of "stage fright." which was largely re
sponsible for the tic score in the last
game, they should come out on top.
Few if any changes will be made in
the lineup. Captain Todd has played
soccer in England and has had consid
erable experience in the game. With
this exception, the team has been de
veloped from green material, and re
flects plenty of hard work on the part
of Coach Maloney and the players.
Both games will be played on the
Stanford Turf Saturday afternoon. The
freshman game will start at 2 and the
varsity at 3:15.
Coach Maloney announces the follow
ing lineups for the games :
Varsity—Masters, goal; Adams, right
back; Anderson, left back; Wing, riglu
half; Robinson, center half; Gorman,
left half; Mendosa, outside right;
Campbell, center right; Newland (cap
tain), center forward; Peavy, inside
left ;> Shauss, outside left.
Freshmen—Genereaux, goal; Jordan,
right back; Snell, left back; Todd (cap
tain), right half; Sanders, center half;
Phelps, left half; Swayne, outside right;
Elmore, center right; Mences, center
forward; Bussy, outside left.

tain), center forward; Peavy, inside
left ;> Shauss, outside left.
Freshmen—Genereaux, goal; Jordan,
right back; Snell, left back; Todd (cap
tain), right half; Sanders, center half;
Phelps, left half; Swayne, outside right;
Elmore, center right; Mences, center
forward; Bussy, outside left.
Final practices are being held by the
varsity soccer team in preparation foi
the game with California here Satur
day, and the men who will go on the
field are all in splendid condition. Coach
Maloney is confident that the team will
wipe up the Blue and Gold, unless some
unforeseen accident occurs.
Important changes will be made in
the forward line and these shifts arc
counted on to strengthen the team to a
great extent. The backl\eld will be
practically the same combination that
faced California on November 20. The
complete lineup has hot yet been decided
on, but will be published tomorrow.
Advantage will be gained from the
fact that the game will be played on
the Stanford Turf, so that even with
rainy weather the forward line will not
be so badly handicapped as it was on
the California Field. Lack of teatnwork
is always the result when playing on a
muddy field, and chances for a last
game Saturday look good, especially if
the weather remains clear.
A new source of strength in the for
ward line has been received from the
varsity American football team in Camp
bell, who is playing a good brand of
soccer at inside right. Another change
to be made is the placing of Masters at
goal. Captain Harvey Newland, who
has been playing in this position, has
been moved to center forward. Peavy
and Struss are fighting it out for inside
left. Mendoza will play outside right in
place of Green, who is not eligible fot
thi sseason. Outside left has four claim
ants in Clark, Mead, Titus and Hays.
Strice has recovered from the injury
to his knee and will be in shape for the
game, although Maloney may not use
him for more than one half.
The freshmen will meet the Bruin
in a soccer game Saturday. Cap
tain Todd and his men have been work-
ing hard and have developed a good
team. The game, however, will be cx
ceedingly close, perhaps a tie, as the
squads are nearly of equal strength. If
the freshmen recover from their attack
of "stage fright." which was largely re
sponsible for the tic score in the last
game, they should come out on top.
Few if any changes will be made in
the lineup. Captain Todd has played
soccer in England and has had consid
erable experience in the game. With
this exception, the team has been de
veloped from green material, and re
flects plenty of hard work on the part
of Coach Maloney and the players.
Both games will be played on the
Stanford Turf Saturday afternoon. The
freshman game will start at 2 and the
varsity at 3:15.
Coach Maloney announces the follow
ing lineups for the games :
Varsity—Masters, goal; Adams, right
back; Anderson, left back; Wing, riglu
half; Robinson, center half; Gorman,
left half; Mendosa, outside right;
Campbell, center right; Newland (cap
tain), center forward; Peavy, inside
left ;> Shauss, outside left.
