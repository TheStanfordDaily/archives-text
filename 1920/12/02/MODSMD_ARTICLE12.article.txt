# STANFORD "BOWL" ASSURED; $750,000 DRIVE STARTS
## ACTIVE STADIUM WORK WILL START JUNE I, 1921, WITH EXCAVATION FOR SUNKEN FIELD; WILL SEAT 60,000 Entire Student Body Will Be Organized to Launch Campaign 
### 
The Big Game of 1923 will be fought in a new Stanford b0w1... Follow
ing discussions that have been maturing for a number of years, the Board
of Athletic Control met last night with President Wilbur and definitely ap
proved plans providing for the construction of an athletic stadium seating
at least 60,000 people and costing approximately $750,000.
The stadium will be of the bowl type, having a sunken field surrounded
by an embankment... Bleachers will be arranged on the slope of the excava
tion and the surrounding embankment... The field will accommodate American
and Rugby football and a running track with a 220-yard straightway, bounded
on the north by the State Highway and on the east by the Peninsula Railway.
Active work on the stadium will be initiated June 1, 1921, by excavating
for the bowl. Suspending work during the succeeding winter in order to
allow the embankment to firmly settle, work will be resumed in the summer
of 1922 and carried through to completion during the following year.

A campaign will be at once inaugu
rated to finance the cost of the stadi
um. The entire Stanford student body
will be promptly organized for an act
ive campaign for raising money. Skull
and Snakes has been very active in
promoting interest in the proposed
bowl and has been considering plans
for raising money for several months.
With the announcement of the decisi
on of the Board, Skull and Snakes, in
co-operation with other student or
ganizations, will actively start work
on its plans aiming at the early rais
ing of the sum needed to pay for the
stadium.
Leland Cutler, '06, was appointed
Chairman of the Committee to prepare
a plan for financing the project and
will report back to the Board of Ath
letic control at a meeting to be held
on the campus next Monday evening.
The Stadium Fund of the Athletic
Board provides a small sum which
will be used in the preliminary work
of securing plans and carrying on the
financial campaign. The Engineer
ing Commission, composed of Profes
sors W. F. Durand, C. D. Marx, and
C. B. Wing of the Engineering depart
ments, was requested at yesterday's
meeting to proceed at unce with the
preparation of the final plans of con
struction.
The site selected is peculiarly suit
able for a bowl. It is a level stretch
of ground, permitting the most econ
omical methods of construction. The
location makes it possible for the
crowds to be easily served by the
electric cars between the Palo Alto
depot and the stadium, and permits
automobile triffic to be handled in
such a way that those coming from
different directions may approach the
bowl without crossing each other's
paths.
From San Francisco automobiles
come down the State Highway and
turn into the grounds around the
stadium and return by the same
route. From Palo Alto automobiles
will approach by Embarcadero Road,
from the S6ut.h they will come up the
Highway, and from the campus they
can approach by the road that runs
past Encina Gymnasium.
The action of the Board yesterday
is the decision taken after discussion
for the past several years. The need
for larger bleachers to accommodate
the Big Game crowds was made plain
by the last two gridiron contests with
California. Without doubt the seat
ing capacity of the bowl will be filled
when the 1923 game is staged in the
howl. The fact that the present
wooden bleachers are rapidly apprach
ing the end of their lifetime was an
added reason which led *he Board to
fipride for the ea ly construction of the
new stadium.
