# JOURNALISTS HEAR BEGBIE FOWLER '06
## "Newspaper Responsibilities" Is Subject of Discussion by Former "Daily" Editor 
### 
The necessity lor impersonal judg
ment and the need for a constructive
rather than a destructive viewpoint
in all phases of newspaper work, was
the key-note of the address on "News
paper Responsibilities" given by Beg
bie Fowler, '06, Business Manager of
the San Francisco Chronicle, at a
meeting of the Stanford Chapter of
the American Journalists' Association
last night.
The chief duty of a paper is to
"Print all of the news that is fit to
print," according to Fowler. The tone
of the paper and the policies of the
sheet are judged by the type of news
and the way in which it is handled
by the staff. All the news should be,
as far as possible, of the impersonal
kind and the choise of words should
be an essential point in the make-up
of any article.
The position of the newspaper man,
and newspaper work, has changed to
a great extent in the last fifteen
years. The work has become a re
cognized profession. In place of be
ing some one whom the general pub
lic avoided and before whom conversa
tion became a stilted form, the re
porter and the editor have become one
to whom the most important of con
fidences are entrusted. This has be
come the basis of professional eti
quette in the newspaper world.
The fascination of the newspaper
game lies not only in being in touch
with the affairs of the world, of "Hav
ing one's finger on the pulse of the
world," but also in being in touch
with the heart of the country. Since
a great part of the moulding of pub
lic opinion goes on through the medi
um of the press, one should always
try to be constructive and should use
judgment in the use of words. Inde
pendence is thought to be encouraged,
but not in any extreme form.
Fowkr is a member of the class of
1906. While at Stanford he was editor
of the Daily Palo Alto and did much
work towards establishing the pres
ent system of ideals maintained by
the paper and of instituting many of
the traditions now followed by the
paper. He has been connected with
the newspaper business since start
ing as errand boy with the San Fran
cisco Chronicle and has worked
through the editorial rooms to the
business offices.
In speaking of the value of a college
education as a help for those who ex
pect to enter the journalistic field,
Fowler made the point that, in spite
of many statements to the contrary,
he himself feels that a man retains
at least one thing after four years of
training, the ability to think quickly
and accurately and that although he
started at exactly the same point when
he returned to his paper after four
years, lie was able to go ahead faster
and steadie • than he would have
otherwise.
After the address an informal meet
ing was held during which questions
pertaining directly to campus journal
istic problems were discussed.

print," according to Fowler. The tone
of the paper and the policies of the
sheet are judged by the type of news
and the way in which it is handled
by the staff. All the news should be,
as far as possible, of the impersonal
kind and the choise of words should
be an essential point in the make-up
of any article.
The position of the newspaper man,
and newspaper work, has changed to
a great extent in the last fifteen
years. The work has become a re
cognized profession. In place of be
ing some one whom the general pub
lic avoided and before whom conversa
tion became a stilted form, the re
porter and the editor have become one
to whom the most important of con
fidences are entrusted. This has be
come the basis of professional eti
quette in the newspaper world.
The fascination of the newspaper
game lies not only in being in touch
with the affairs of the world, of "Hav
ing one's finger on the pulse of the
world," but also in being in touch
with the heart of the country. Since
a great part of the moulding of pub
lic opinion goes on through the medi
um of the press, one should always
try to be constructive and should use
judgment in the use of words. Inde
pendence is thought to be encouraged,
but not in any extreme form.
Fowkr is a member of the class of
1906. While at Stanford he was editor
of the Daily Palo Alto and did much
work towards establishing the pres
ent system of ideals maintained by
the paper and of instituting many of
the traditions now followed by the
paper. He has been connected with
the newspaper business since start
ing as errand boy with the San Fran
cisco Chronicle and has worked
through the editorial rooms to the
business offices.
In speaking of the value of a college
education as a help for those who ex
pect to enter the journalistic field,
Fowler made the point that, in spite
of many statements to the contrary,
he himself feels that a man retains
at least one thing after four years of
training, the ability to think quickly
and accurately and that although he
started at exactly the same point when
he returned to his paper after four
years, lie was able to go ahead faster
and steadie • than he would have
otherwise.
After the address an informal meet
ing was held during which questions
pertaining directly to campus journal
istic problems were discussed.
