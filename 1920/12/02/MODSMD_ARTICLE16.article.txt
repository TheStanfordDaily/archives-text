Stanford's football bowl is assured. That is the big
thing. The next problem is to raise the $750,000 needed to
build the structure, and it is here that Stanford men and
women have a specific duty to perform. They are expected
to raise a certain sum themselves, and to work every minute
to help raise the larger portion of the fund, which is to come
from alumni and interested people throughout the state. In
accomplishing these two tasks, the present generation of Stan
ford students have a wonderful opportunity to show what
Stanford enthusiasm and Stanford spirit can do. It is a big
job, but it can and must be accomplished.
Work on the bowl will start this coming summer, and by
that time a considerable portion of the fund must be raised.
The student body of the University of Washington raised
$100,000 in a short time for their stadium, which was just
completed, and campaigned actively for the remainder of the
sum. Stanford can do the same thing, and it must be done
with a rush and a bang. Enthusiasm must not be allowed to
lag, and the project must be pushed without cessation until
the $750,000 is raised.
Skull and Snakes has been promoting interest in the bowl
idea, and it is prepared to take an active part in raising both
the student portion of the fund and in aiding the Alumni
Committee to raise the remainder of the quota.
Each individual student must consider it his job to sub
scribe his share to the bowl fund first, and then do all in his
power to arouse interest elsewhere. The alumni, under the
chairmanship of Leland Cutler, '06, a member of the Board
of Trustees, have direct charge of the fund, and it is their
work to secure the majority of the outside subscription, but
they must have student aid.
The present Stanford students have the privilege of wit
nessing the inauguration of probably the greatest project in
Stanford's athletic history, and it is the work of each indi
vidual to see that the "bowl fund" campaign starts off with
enthusiasm and spirit.
